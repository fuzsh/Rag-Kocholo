        "text": "BEAVER FALLS, New York (WWNY) - Robert “Bob” Giordano passed peacefully at Samaritan Summit Village in Watertown on July 12th. He was surrounded by the love and support of his family.\n\nBorn December 21st,1935 in New York City, Bob was the son of Nicholas Giordano and Florence Mascitelli Giordano. While in New York, his mother passed on her passion for the New York Giants baseball team making Bob a passionate, lifelong fan of what became the San Francisco Giants.\n\nAs a boy, Bob and his family moved to Rensselaer, N.Y. To support his education, and love of basketball, he attended Bishop Maginn high school in Albany. Upon graduation, he was recruited to play basketball at Colgate University where he played for four years and was captain in 1956. While at Colgate, he completed his undergraduate in science and later his master’s degree. In 1983, he and his son, Rob, became the only father-son duo to be captains of the Colgate team.\n\nHe was married to the love of his life, Catherine (Cathy) Meisner, August 19th, 1956. Once married, it was time to decide on a career. Bob had a choice to teach school and coach basketball in Tenafly, N.J. or Beaver Falls, N.Y. He chose Beaver Falls because he wanted to build a basketball program and take advantage of his growing interest in small game hunting and fishing. He made the right choice! He won 416 games in 28 seasons at Beaver River Central School that included 12 conference titles, six sectional championships, and five teams that produced 20-win seasons. Both on the court and in the classroom, “Coach Giordano”/ “Mr. Giordano” demanded excellence and discipline. Players and students throughout the years have never forgotten his style and how his approach prepared them for life.\n\nBob’s interests were many. He loved nourishing his flowers, playing tennis, hunting and fishing, and playing any game including bocce, cards, and darts. Happy hours were a favorite time especially sharing his love of cooking and unique wild game recipes with family. His intensity and passion were infectious and his competitive nature unwavering leading him to be a coach, teacher, and mentor to so many. He will be remembered most for his impact on the local community via the game of basketball. As a measure of that impact, he was inducted into the NYS Basketball Hall of Fame, the Bishop Maginn Hall of Fame, and the Northern NY Basketball Hall of Fame. The basketball court at Beaver River was also named “Bob Giordano Court” as a lasting tribute to his impact.\n\nBob is survived by his wife of 68 years, Cathy, and four children: Karen (Mike) Burkhard, Pipersville, PA; Rob (Novline) Giordano, Fairport, NY; Deborah (Scott) Lucero, Canandaigua, NY; and Nancy (Steve) Giordano-Ramos, St. Augustine, FL. Bob is also survived by eleven grandchildren: Brian, Leah, Eric (Karen); Gabrielle, Danielle, Tyler, Jordan (Rob); Matthew, Kristen (“Peanut”), Lauryn (Deb); and Nic (Nancy). He is also survived by eight great-grandchildren ~ Riley, Vail, Owen, Hudson, Nora, June, Paige and Penelope (arriving in September!)\n\nThere will be a family celebration of his life in the coming days. A community remembrance celebration is being planned for the fall (at a time to later be announced) in Beaver Falls with everyone invited. At that time, he will be buried at the Riverside cemetery of Beaver Falls. Bob was a good father, husband, and mentor. He will be missed but his memory lives on.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider donations in Bob’s name to Double Play Community Center at www.doubleplaycc.com in the interest of developing children’s sports skills.\n\nScanlon Funeral Home, Croghan, has been entrusted with arrangements.\n\nCondolences and shared memories can be registered at www.scanlonfuneral.com."
