        "text": "Summary\n\nThe story is set evocatively in the wilds of Cornwall, in a large country house called Manderley. One of du Maurier’s intriguing devices is her refusal to name her heroine, the first-person narrator, known only as the second Mrs. de Winter. The novel opens with her famously saying, “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.” Much of the story is then told in flashback. A shy, awkward young woman, she is in Monte-Carlo, working for an elderly socialite, when she meets Maximilian (Maxim) de Winter. He is a wealthy widower whose wife, Rebecca, drowned in a sailboat accident. After a whirlwind courtship, the young woman and Maxim marry and later settle at Manderley. The narrator begins to feel progressively inferior to Rebecca, despite receiving compliments from various people. To the second Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca personifies glamour and gaiety, and she does not think that she can compete with this dead paragon to win Maxim’s love. Mrs. Danvers, the sinister housekeeper, especially wounds the narrator by constantly mentioning how much Maxim had loved, and would always love, Rebecca.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, First Lines Quiz\n\nSuspense builds as the narrator grows both increasingly obsessed with the beautiful first wife and insecure in her marriage. At the annual costume ball at Manderley, the second Mrs. de Winter wears a costume at the encouragement of Mrs. Danvers, not realizing it was similar to one worn by Rebecca shortly before her death. The outfit upsets Maxim, who orders her to change. The narrator later confronts Mrs. Danvers, who says that Maxim does not want her and encourages her to jump out the second-floor window. However, just then rockets are set off as a ship strikes a reef in the nearby bay, and the two women part. Divers soon discover a sunken sailing boat that contains Rebecca’s body. Maxim then reveals the truth to his second wife—he was not in love with Rebecca. She was cruel and manipulative, and soon after their wedding she began having numerous affairs. Fearful of scandal, Maxim agreed to her offer: she would outwardly appear as the perfect wife if he allowed her to live privately as she pleased. However, on the night of her death, she had informed her husband that she was pregnant and that the father was one of her lovers. In a fit of anger, Maxim shot Rebecca and put her body in a sailboat that he then sank. (A body had been found weeks after Rebecca’s disappearance, and Maxim had identified it as being hers.)"
