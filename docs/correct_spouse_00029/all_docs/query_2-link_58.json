        "text": "This is the eighty-third entry in an irregular feature where we will report updates on what cast members of Guiding Light are doing now. I’m playing catch up on some soap magazine news. So as a reminder you can buy back issues:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/faq-back-issues-2014/\n\nIn the November 5, 2018 issue of Soap Opera Digest find photos from the 2018 Daytime Stars and Strikes. Read more about the event. Find photos of Elizabeth Keifer (Blake Thorpe Marler), Jerry verDorn (Ross Marler), Lauren B. Martin (Camille Bennett on As the World Turns), Sonia Satra (Lucy Cooper Spaulding, part of terrific LAM pairing, victim of Marian Crane), Elvera Roussel (Hope Bauer Spaulding #7), Grant Aleksander (Phillip Spaulding #2, adult Phillip), Michael O’Leary (Rick Bauer #5, the adult one we know and love), Ricky Paull Goldin (Gus Aituro), Justin Deas (Buzz Cooper), Margaret Colin (Margo Montgomery Hughes #1 on As the World Turns), and Yvonna Kopacz-Wright (Mel Boudreau Bauer).\n\nBethany Joy Lenz (credited then as Joie Lenz) aka (Michelle Bauer Santos #4) was pictured at Lifetime’s holiday party at The Grove. See a gorgeous photo in the January 7, 2019 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth.\n\nRebecca Budig (Michelle Bauer #3, part of the Messe pairing) has a role on the new show LA’s Finest. Read about it in the November 26, 2018 issue of Soap Opera Digest. See a chain of photos showing the Christmas 1997 when Budig’s Michelle was blinded in the December 24, 2018 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth.\n\nJordi Vilasuso (Tony Santos #1 of Marony fame) is fitting in well in his new The Young and the Restless role as Rey Rosales a cornerstone of the newly established Rosales clan. A feature on his character’s romance with Sharon Newman in the November 12, 2018 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth. Vilasuso answers a round up that he recommends the book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho read why in the January 7, 2019 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth. Visit with Jordi Vilasuso (Tony Santos #1) and his family for Christmas in the December 24, 2018 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth. He describes getting his The Young and the Restless role in the same issue. Read all about the new Geona City family in the November 12, 2018 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth. He was also the Take Five focus with an awesome photo in the December 3, 2018 issue of Soap Opera Digest. Vilasuso is featured in the me and him contrasting his style with his character’s in the September 3, 2018 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nIn the August 1973 issue of Afternoon TV Mark Hulswit (Ed Bauer #3) is interviewed. I think of him as 1970s Ed and honestly a lot of the time when someone says Ed I still think of him for a second before I think of Peter Simon (Ed Bauer #4). Here’s the thing though. Ed at the time was written as a twit. I always thought he was a twit even at the time. Apparently lots of people thought of him as a hearthrob. Not to be mean, but I just don’t see it. He was a twit. I think the article “My Wife is as Liberated as She Wants to be…” kind of sums up why I think so. The rest of the article deserves the title. It does include a line about having a dinner every month that “includes Charita [Bauer] (Bert Bauer) or Caroline [McWilliams] (Janet Mason) or Tony or Franny [Myers] (Peggy Fletcher)….I still keep in touch with some of the people who were on the show in the past, but have left. Mike Zaslow (Roger Thorpe), for instance.” An entire paragraph includes talking about how close he is to Stefan Schnabel (Stephen Jackson – Rick’s grandfather). including snow shoeing at “Steve’s cabin in Vermont.” This is kind of cool too, his two daughters were extras one day on Guiding Light “We went on location to a park in New Jersey. Tina and Jenny were supposed to be little children walking home from school. It was raining that day, and they spent five hours walking in the rain.” It seemed to cure them of the desire to be in show business.” So they must have at least occassionally gone on location in the early 1970s. I found the rest of the names he dropped and added last names and character names, but I honestly have no idea who Tony was. I don’t see a match on the cast list I have.\n\nThe September 19, 2018 issue of the CBS Soaps in Depth gives a recap of the 1998 storyline, The Nursery Rhyme Stalker – it was Holly as she fell apart after Fletcher took off with their autistic daughter Meg.\n\nGrant Aleksander (Phillip Spaulding #2, adult Phillip) is returning as Detective Asher in off-Broadway’s longest running play, Perfect Crime. He previously played the role last summer. Robert Newman (Josh Lewis) has also done some time in the role. https://daytimeconfidential.com/2019/01/16/grant-aleksander-returns-to-perfect-crime?fbclid=IwAR28KyXbPurL8E9YQTrmgbiau6DRKw2VX1SfhJW-uo4vpCwmDq-KIxwyBoM\n\nA roundup of costumes in soaps included really nice photos of Reva during the Civil War through the painting episode and Harley and Blake as Irna Phillips and her secretary Rose.
