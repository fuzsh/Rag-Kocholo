        "text": "“General Hospital” (GH) spoilers tease that on next week’s episodes Port Charles residents will be excited on Monday, May 23, about the upcoming Nurse’s Ball. General Hospital spoilers predict a daring rescue, a couple of husbands in trouble, and wedding plans finalized. Check out these spoilers for the next GH episode.\n\nBoth Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) and Julian Jerome (William deVry) are in trouble with their wives – and both might end up in trouble with the PCPD thanks to their angry spouses. Out at Wyndemere, Nikolas is scheming to sell Hayden Barnes’ (Rebecca Budig) diamonds.\n\nNikolas needs money bad but those gems are the only thing keeping Hayden from ratting him to the cops. When Liz Webber (Rebecca Herbst) finds out the depth of trouble Nikolas is in and what he’s planning, she warns him he’s playing with fire. Nikolas asks her to keep quiet about what she knows.\n\nHayden heads to GH to find Dr Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton) and asks if they can talk. Finn already took Hayden to task over her dad Raymond Berlin. Looks like Finn knows some people who were harmed by her dad’s Ponzi scheme, so why is she approaching Finn now knowing that he hates her?\n\nWedding plans are picking up momentum. Brad Cooper (Parry Shen) talks to Felix DuBois (Marc Samuel) about a role in the festivities. Wonder if Felix will be Brad’s best man? The guys find Valerie Spencer (Brytni Sarpy) with Bobbie Spencer (Jacklyn Zeman) and share their exciting news.\n\nThe other troubled hubby in town, Julian, has to deal with his irate spouse Alexis Davis (Nancy L Grahn) and wants to know if this is what their marriage will be like from now on. Alexis is not happy with Julian over the Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey V Parise) murder thing and is seriously reassessing her life choices.\n\nSonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) struck a nerve when he told her that Julian was manipulating her emotionally to get her to cover for him. Alexis has the bloody shirt – she lied when she told Julian she’d burn it. Alexis makes what could be a life-changing decision and then makes an important call.\n\nWho will she call and does it have to do with Julian killing both Carlos and the witness Hale? Has Alexis decided she can no longer look the other way? Lucas also owes his dad a visit to fill him in on the wedding plans and a remark Lucas makes seems to make things worse between Alexis and Julian.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, things are getting dicey for Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) because Carlos’ dirty pal Marcus is about to kill her. He has her at gun point and she begs for her life. Sonny tells Michael Quartermaine (Chad Duell) that he doesn’t want him risking his life for Sabrina.\n\nLooks like Sonny and Michael will bust in just in the nick of time and save Sabrina from being shot. Sabrina then fills Michael in on her troubles since they last saw one another and how hard things have been on the run. Will any of this soften Sonny’s attitude about her running off with Carlos?\n\nAnd, most importantly, did Carlos and Sabrina really get hitched? Since Carlos is dead, she’d still be a widow, but that was a big shocker for Michael to hear, so it will be important to him to know if she said “I do” with the man he thinks shot his father.\n\nAlso coming soon is an appeal to Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen) from Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) to take her to the Nurse’s Ball since Nathan West (Ryan Paevey) is still healing up. Will Nathan endorse the move since Griffin saved his life? Will Griffin ever explain to Nathan why and how he knows him?"
