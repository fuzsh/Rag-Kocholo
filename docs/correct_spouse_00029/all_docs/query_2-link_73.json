        "text": "Fantastic news late last evening from a very proud first time papa! The Bold and the Beautiful’s Adam Gregory (Thomas) and his wife, Sheridan Nicole, welcomed his son into the world … little Kannon!\n\nIn a series of excited tweets on his Twitter account Adam revealed, “Can’t believe my lil Boom is almost here! I feel like I’ve waited eternities to hold my son in my arms. @imsheridanicole is so strong.”\n\nLater. Gregory followed that tweet with the big announcement! “Guess who’s here!! 8 Lbs. 12 ounces of awesome!! #KannonGregory #BOOM @imsheridanicole is the most amazing woman!”\n\nCongratulations to Adam and Sheridan, and their new little bundle of joy, who is one lucky guy to have such wonderful parents to raise him!\n\nThe soap opera world has been in mourning over the weekend, with the news of the death of Esta TerBlanche, who played Gillian Andrassy Lavery on ABC’s All My Children from 1997-2001.\n\nEsta’s leading man during her run in Pine Valley was Cameron Mathison (ex-Ryan Lavery, AMC now, Drew Quartermaine, GH). The love story of Ryan and Gillian was complex. He believed that Gillian was a wealthy princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and the two were eventually married. Later, Gillian was killed when TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to Michael Fairman TV on Sunday, Mathison expressed, “Esta was somebody very, very close to my heart. We both came to New York around the same time and basically started and learned acting together. Ryan and Gillian are such a beautiful sweet couple … and hold a very, very special place in my heart.”\n\nSpeaking on TerBlanche’s love of animals and reconnecting with her in 2023, Cameron recounted, “Esta was literally one of the sweetest kindest people I’ve eve met. When she heard that my dog (Red) was sick and paralyzed last year, she volunteered to take him for a few days to try to care for him to give me a break. We hadn’t really been in touch for a long time so it came out of nowhere and after spending time with her, he learned how to walk again. 🙏”\n\nIn closing Mathison shared, “She was just a beautiful soul and had a healing spirit.” TerBlanche died unexpectedly on Thursday. The cause of death has not yet been determined.\n\nCameron also took to his Instagram Story on Sunday, sharing some images of himself and Esta with one said from All My Children, which read,”RIP my sweet princess.”\n\nWhen All My Children came to its conclusion in 2011, Ryan was reunited with Gillian one more time when he received a ‘heavenly’ visit from his princess. Now with TerBlanche’s death, it makes the scenes all the more poignant. Watch it below.\n\nShare your thoughts on Cameron’s sentiments on the death of his AMC co-star, Esta TerBlanche, and let us know if you were a Ryan and Gillian fan via the comment section below.\n\nEsta TerBlanche who played All My Children’s Gillian Andrassy Lavery died in her Los Angeles home at the age of 51. Her passing was confirmed by her godddaughter, Barbie Ashley to TMZ.\n\nAccording to Ashley, Esta died unexpectedly on Thursday. However, according to a report, medical personnel believe the she has been dead a day before she was found. The cause of death has not yet been determined and is under investigation at this time, according to Esta’s rep, Lisa Rodrigo.\n\nEsta, who hailed from South Africa, began her career early on in her life when she was crowned Miss Teen South Africa in 1991. She later starred in the South African soap opera series, Egoli: Place of Gold, as Bienkie Naudé Hartman from 1992-95.\n\nThe South African news and entertainment blog, TV with Thinnus, reported Esta’s body was found by police after workers couldn’t contact her for a number of days and alerted law enforcement. Police contacted her younger brother Henko who lives in New York, who in turn contacted her family in South Africa.\n\nBurget Mueller, EP of Egoli said of Esta: “She was the epitome of professionalism, always well prepared and brought joy to set. She was beloved under her colleagues and we were very proud of her when she left to go to America and found fame there with All My Children.”\n\nTaking to Facebook, Esta’s PR rep, Lisa Rodrigo added, “I can not believe I am posting this. It’s with a heavy heart that my friend and client Esta TerBlanche passed away Thursday of natural causes. An autopsy report is pending. I am still processing and in shock. Esta was a beautiful soul in and out. I was proud to know her and work with her. More to come in the days ahead. Thank you for the messages so far. If I haven’t gotten to you, I will soon. May she RIP with the angels that she is.”\n\nTerBlanche appeared on All My Children from 1997-2001 and the love story of Ryan (Cameron Mathison) and Gillian was one of the most popular of the day. She later returned for the AMC series finale in 2011.\n\nIn story, Ryan believed that his beloved Gillian was a princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. He was blackmailed into marrying her by Liza, who threatened to report his taking kickbacks from advertisers if he didn’t go through with the wedding. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and they married on, April 9, 2001.\n\nWhen TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa, Gillian was killed-off when an assassin mistook her for Anna Devane and killed her. Gillian’s heart was then donated to save the life of Laura English.\n\nAt the time of her death, Esta was an animal activist, and she told Soap Opera Digest in a very recent interview: “At the moment, I am knee-deep into some animal projects. I grew up on a game farm, and just love animals. I’m working with a rescue project for some prairie dogs. And my Persian cat just had kittens, so there’s a lot of feeding going on around my house.” Esta also shared that she was eager to get back into acting, while also working on her South African cancer foundation Create Your Breakthrough.\n\nMichael Fairman TV sends our condolences to Esta’s family, loved ones and friends during this difficult time.\n\nNow below, share your remembrances and thoughts on the passing of All My Children’s Esta TerBlanche via the comment section. But first, watch Ryan and Gillian’s nuptials below.\n\nThe daytime world learned on Friday that Days of our Lives Daytime Emmy-winning head writer, Ron Carlivati was no longer with the Peacock streaming soap opera effective immediately. That ended Carlivati’s seven-plus year run in Salem.\n\nAs Carlivati’s departure was announced so too were his replacements. The new co-head writing team of Paula Cwikly and Jeanne Marie Ford will now steer the stories on DAYS, although fans won’t see their work for awhile since Carlivati’s shows will stream through April of 2025.\n\nAfter the news of his exit, Days of our Lives star Greg Rikaart (Leo Start) took to his Instagram story and posted, “Thank you Ron Carlivati. What a Great Run.” Many have felt that the character of Leo was Carlivati’s muse, and Rikaart played him to the hilt.\n\nGreg first appeared as Leo Stark in 2018, was was then “killed-off,” but returned by the end of the year. He then exited again in the spring of 2019. The DAYS writing team brought Leo back in 2020 for an episode and then he was part of the antics for Days of our Lives: Beyond Salem, the limited series on Peacock in the summer of 2021.\n\nEventually, Leo returned to the mothership and Days of our Lives in February of 2022 and as of current streaming episodes remains active in story. Leo has been the benefactor of Carlivati’s one-line zingers, comedy hijinks, and shared storylines with other LGBTQ characters at one time or another including: Sonny Kiriakis (Zach Tinker) and Craig Wesley (Kevin Spirtas).\n\nWith the new writers coming aboard, fans are already wondering what does this mean for the fate of Leo and other characters on the soap? When Rikaart, who is married to television writer and producer, Robert Sudduth, got the opportunity to play Leo in the first place and then made an exit in 2019, he shared publicly, “Playing this role has been a gift. An absurdly fun and delicious gift.” Rikaart’s Leo has certainly been a mainstay scene stealer on DAYS for the last several years.\n\nWhat do you think about Greg’s ‘thank you’ to Ron Carlivati? Do you hope that the new writers continue the mischief and story of Leo, and write him in a way that is benefitting the character? Comment below."
