        "text": "Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nThe Guiney family is growing!\n\nBob Guiney headed over to Instagram on Monday to let Bachelor Nation know that he and wife Jessica Canyon are expecting their second child together.\n\n“2021 just got a whole lot better for the Guineys!!” the former Bachelor wrote alongside a photo of himself posing with Jessica and their 2-year-old son Grayson.\n\nBob, who is seen proudly holding a strip of sonogram images in the snapshot, added, “It’s safe to say @graysonguiney is really excited!”\n\nIt wasn’t long before notable “Bachelor” and “Bachelorette” alums shared sweet sentiments in the comments section of Bob’s post.\n\n“Congrats!!” wrote Season 3 Bachelor Andrew Firestone. Meanwhile, Trista Sutter — whom Bob memorably dated during Season 1 of “The Bachelorette” in 2003 — enthused, “So happy for you guys!!!”\n\nAs fans will recall, Trista — who is married to her finalist, Ryan Sutter, with whom she shares two children — broke things off with Bob during Week 3, preventing the mortgage broker and singer from participating in the pivotal Hometown Dates episode.\n\nThough Trista’s rejection shattered Bob’s heart at the time, his love life was resuscitated when he got the call to lead Season 4 of “The Bachelor” in 2003. While his journey didn’t conclude with a proposal, he chose finalist Estella Gardinier. However, they split shortly after the finale aired. Bob married “All My Children” actress Rebecca Budig in 2004 but divorced her in 2010.\n\nBob found his happily ever after with Jessica, though, and the pair wed in 2016. The couple — who live in Seattle, Washington — welcomed their firstborn, Grayson, in December 2018.\n\nThese days, Bob serves as a part-time correspondent for “The Today Show.” Additionally, he still flexes his musical chops as a member of the charity cover band Band from TV, which he formed with “Alias” star Greg Grunberg and “Desperate Housewives” actor James Denton, among other celebrities. (As a solo artist, Bob has released two albums: 2003’s “3 Sides” and 2008’s “Hoggin’ All the Covers.”)\n\n“Life is going very well,” Bob told Us Weekly in 2020, expressing gratitude for all that has transpired since his time on the Bachelor franchise. “Thanks to the show, I’ve had such amazing opportunities come my way.”"
