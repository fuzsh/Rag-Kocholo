        "text": "By Reality TV World staff, 07/07/2004\n\nReality TV World learned yesterday that Bob Guiney, star of ABC's 4, and his fiancee Rebecca Budig, an actress who also hosted repeats and special editions of , were married on July 3rd. An attendee told Reality TV World that the nuptials took place in Hale, Michigan, at his parents' home on Long Lake, at 11:00 AM.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReality TV World spent the day attempting to contact both ABC and Bob Guiney and his representatives for confirmation of the story, only to be rebuffed and stalled while the couple apparently worked a deal to provide People magazine the exclusive news of the event. As of this morning, Bob's representatives were still \"attempting to reach him\" --- while People had already leaked snippets of its story to select mainstream press outlets late last evening. Then again, we already knew Bob had trouble telling the truth.\n\nAbout fifty guests attended the ceremony. \"They were married outdoors by the lake,\" Budig's mother, Mary, told People. \"It was low-key--just family and friends.\" Reading their own vows, the ceremony lasted about twenty minutes and was followed by a barbecue reception. Rebecca wore a white two-piece dress designed by a friend. The couple had become engaged on May 20, 2004.\n\nThe marriage represents the second wedding associated with the series -- and both of the spouses were two-time contestants. The first wedding featured Trista Rehn, who was rejected by Alex Michael in the first series of , but later found love on ette with Ryan Sutter, whom she married in a made-for-TV ceremony. One of her rejected suitors on ette was Bob Guiney, who then starred in 4 but failed to find love with his selection, Estella Gardinier, whom he only gave a \"promise ring\" during the final selection ceremony. However, Bob's involvement with that show led to his relationship with Rebecca.\n\nWhy wasn't Bob interested in Estella? According to People, it may be because he was already in hot pursuit of Rebecca, who stars on the ABC soap opera All My Children. Rebecca hosted ABC's : Aaron and Helene Tell All, the wrap-up show that aired after 's second edition, and the ABC Family Channel rebroadcasts of and ette -- where Bob met her in January 2003, prior to committing to 4, and \"was smitten\" by her charms. However, Rebecca had a boyfriend at the time.\n\nWe admit to wondering whether Bob did 4 simply to spend more time with Rebecca. Perhaps that's why he was \"very confident\" that he'd find love during the show.\n\nPeople reports that Bob and Rebecca admit to getting together in November, which may be the reason that gossip columns reported that Bob and Estella had split as soon as 4 ended, even though Bob kept denying it for another month (in keeping with the pretence of a \"relationship\" that seems integral to , which is actually 0-for-5 in setting up lasting couples).\n\nNow that Rebecca has become part of family in more ways than one, perhaps she can both host and star in a new special with Bob, who (according to Estella) thinks of himself as a \"a big-time star\".\n\nGet more Reality TV World!
