        "text": "A bachelor no more!Bob Guiney married his fiancée, Jessica Canyon, on Friday, November 11, in Punta Mita, Mexico.\n\nGuests shared several Instagram posts from the big day, which appeared to be at Casa Entre Rocas, a luxe beachfront villa. Several attendees congratulated the spouses on tying the knot. The bride stunned in an Atelier Pronovias gown, and the bridesmaids wore long, dark dresses and carried tropical flowers.\n\nCanyon posted a pic of the pair sharing a kiss in front of the beach on Instagram on Monday, November 14. “The perfect end … and the perfect beginning #wedding #Mexico #amazing #pbj16,” she wrote.\n\nA few days before the ceremony, Guiney, 45, shared his excitement over the wedding in a photo from Punta Mita, writing, “The final countdown!!! Only 4 more days away @jescanyon and we’re rolling into #casaentrerocas to make it official!! Here we go!! #Rideofalifetime #PBJ16 #puntamita #iloveus #beautifuldestinations.”\n\nThe TV personality, who regularly appears on the Today show’s popular “Guys Tell All” segment, first revealed his engagement on the morning show. “I’m actually engaged now,” he said in October 2015, explaining that he popped the question over Labor Day weekend.\n\nGuiney appeared on the first season of The Bachelorette in 2003 with Trista Sutter but didn’t find love. (She picked now-husband Ryan Sutter, and they share two kids.) He went on to become the Bachelor in 2003’s season 4 and gave his final rose to Estella Gardinier. While he didn’t propose, he gave her a promise ring indicating that they would continue to date after the show, but their romance was short-lived.\n\nThis is Guiney’s third marriage. He was first married to Jennifer Lantz and second to soap opera actress Rebecca Budig in 2004, but they divorced in 2010."
