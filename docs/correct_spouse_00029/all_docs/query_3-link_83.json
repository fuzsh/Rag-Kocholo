        "text": "At 56, Jack Nicholson may be the most popular, enduring star of his generation. And with his latest film, Wolf, he remains the king of the howl, a man whose rascal heart and private pain fuel his passion as an actor. In a candid interview, the old romantic tells Nancy Collins about his relationship with Anjelica Huston; his breakup with Rebecca Broussard, the mother of his two youngest children; and the family secret that was kept from him for 37 years\n\nJack Nicholson is edgy.\n\nIt’s not just that the big quake has jostled the Picassos at his house on Mulholland, the one he bought for a song 25 years ago—when he was working cheap. That’s the small stuff. It’s the woman thing that’s got him down. Dames. Again.\n\nIt’s been a killer year, the final act in a seven year stretch of too much work and too much love. The work he could handle. It’s the love that did him in.\n\nA year ago last September, Rebecca Broussard, the 31-year-old blonde knockout who mothered Nicholson’s two youngest children, up and quit him after six years. He’d finished The Two Jakes, Man Trouble, A Few Good Men, and the eight-month grind of Hoffa. The news hit him like a right hook to the heart. The rumor went that the young actress had left Nicholson for a younger guy. But Jack doesn’t know and frankly, doesn’t care.\n\nI don’t know about him and I never asked,” says Jack, now 56 and newly skinny, having dropped 50 pound sin the last four years. “You shouldn’t ask me. If I’m weak in any area, it’s ‘I don’t want to know.’”\n\nWhat concerns him most is losing her. Forget his rogue reputation; that’s entry-level perception. This is a guy who never really leaves the women he’s loved. Circumstances may separate them. New loves may join the dance. It can get really complicated up there on Mulholland. But Jack is loyal to his women. In his fashion. He can’t help but play with the rules, but the guy’s romantic. His smooth, seductive charm wafts over a tense, modern gal like a cool breeze from the Jazz Age. And with a broken heart he’s sexy in spades. Still, the question is, after all these crazy years, can the old rascal love again?\n\n“It’s the hardest lesson,” he says, returning to Rebecca. “You’re left. You’re abandoned. And you’re not going to be over it for another year—whatever the fuck you do. . . they do. . . she do. If it takes that long, I’m willing. I don’t think I got the time, but I’m willing to do the time. I’m going to give my need the time.”\n\nIs he still in love with Rebecca, whose pregnancy caused Anjelica Huston, who shared Nicholson’s life for 17 years, to finally throw in the towel? “Of course,” he wails. “I’m still in love with all the women I ever loved.” And, no, he’s not sorry he trusted Rebecca. “I trusted her too much. I’d trust again too much tomorrow night because I like her. She’s great.”\n\nRebecca Broussard hesitates when I ask her about Jack. This is the first and last time she’s going to discuss what happened. But she’s got a few things to clear up. “After I had my kids, I changed,” Rebecca tells me. There is another man now, a 31-year-old-actor. “He is a very important person in my life.” But she says he wasn’t the catalyst for the breakup. “He has nothing to do with Jack and my reality.”\n\nI remember her words as I watch Jack grab another Marlboro from the silver cigarette box on his sleek, low-slung coffee table. “The tough things come to me in such tremendous proportions that they are always cosmically humorous. I went seven years where I didn’t have a minute off from work. And the first minute I did, I got abandoned. As a literary person, I have to see the humor in it. But if this don’t fill you with a sense of disqualification, then, Jack, you are overly self-confident.”\n\n“It takes a long time for Jack to allow a female into his life,” explains Helena Kallianiotas, a Nicholson pal. “You can actually see it click when it happens. And then he’s completely open. So when there’s a breakup, the roots are so deep in him—like a tree, really—that it takes years to pull them out.”\n\nThough he and Broussard are no longer an item, they’re not strangers. “We have a relationship,” he says, “because of the children, but we have no other relationship.” The children are Lorraine, almost four, and two-year-old Ray (“My man Ray,” says a beaming Nicholson, who is cuckoo about the kid). They travel easily between Jack’s house and Rebecca’s place—the one Jack bought for her after Lorraine was born—10 minutes away.\n\nThey had always kept separate houses, a necessity for Nicholson, a man who has made no secret of his war on fidelity, a man who after a quarter-century of trying “every form of living together” realized he just wasn’t good at cohabitation of the traditional variety. “Yeah,” he now says dryly, “I was going to try and improve on the form.” He stops, still sorting out his confusion. “One of the sentiments I have about my current, ah, breach. . . so to speak,” he begins, staring out the huge sliding glass doors that form an entire wall in his living room, “is that, whether true or false, I really felt happy there for awhile. I don’t know how I got there, didn’t know anything about it, really, but there it was. I also didn’t have—which I always have—this superstitious ‘If I feel happy, it’ll go away’ thing hanging over my head. I wasn’t thinking that way.”\n\nLorraine Smith, who helped raise Jack, remembers when he showed up on her doorstep in Neptune City, New Jersey, with Rebecca on his arm. “They’d been in Europe,” Lorraine recalls. “She was three months pregnant with Ray and I’d never seen Jack happier. She couldn’t take her eyes off him and he seemed to be younger, more carefree, loving.”\n\nNicholson says he has never had a problem reconciling his yearning for family with his itch for independence. He fervently believes that a man can have it all without anyone getting hurt. Call it the dream of a guy who can’t say no. Call it Irish idealism in its finest form. Call it an invitation to heartbreak, this time his own.\n\nMike Nichols is sitting in his tasteful, antique-appointed New York office trying to resist the urge to sneak a Marlboro. Unlike Nicholson, he succeeds. He has agreed to show me a rough cut of Wolf, his new movie, with Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicholson. The director begins to tell me all the things that are wrong with the print: the color isn’t corrected, scenes and music are missing; he has yet to pull the full moon over Jack’s face here, the shadow over Michelle’s eyes there. But it doesn’t matter. Wolfis a dazzle. Stunningly directed, it is winsome, witty, and scary—the classic love story of a girl and her wolf.\n\nNicholson’s performance is crafty and subtle, the latest tour de force in a career that was recently celebrated by the American Film Institute when the actor became the youngest recipient of the Life Achievement Award. In Wolf, he plays a genteel, erudite editor at a prestigious publishing house who, bitten by a wolf, finds himself turning into one. He does so just in time to save his company from a conglomerate takeover and the ravages of a hotshot sellout played by James Spader. (“It’s heat! It’s gossip! It’s what I think publishing is all about,” the Spader character gushes in one of his most extraordinarily offensive moments.) The reward for all this inconvenience is that Michelle Pfeiffer—splendid as a thoroughly modern rehab grad—falls in love with him.\n\n“It was not happy-go-lucky Jack hanging out on the set,” says Nichols, who has previously directed the actor in Carnal Knowledge, The Fortune, and Heartburn. “He spent lot of time alone in his trailer.” So the performance is an example of the positive effect on pain on creativity?\n\nJack would never say this,” says Nichols, “but he works off some kind of reactor, and the little pellets of plutonium which are pain have to keep going into the reactor. So he allows pain, real pain, into his life because it goes into the reactor and keeps it cooking.\n\n“And he doesn’t try to make his pain go away,” he continues. “ I remember when Mama Cass died. After lunch I found him in the makeup chair weeping. I said, ‘Nick, do you want to go home? Would you feel better? And he said, ‘I don’t want to feel better.’ And he said, ‘I don’t want to feel better.’ And that’s the key to part of him. He knows he has to go through it. He’s not trying to feel better when he feels bad.”\n\nTo its director, Wolf is about “men getting older and their sexuality—the uncontrollable part, the id, whatever the hell that is. It’s about loss of power, edge, and combativeness,” muses Nichols. “If you don’t lose your combativeness with age, then you’re a shit. But if you get all peaceful and mellow, people stampede right over you. You’ve got footmark son your neck. Wolf is pertinent to Jack’s life now because, though he’s getting on, his passion is unstilled. He’s not suited to being supercivilized.\n\n“When I worked with Jack on Carnal Knowledge,” Nichols recalls, “we were both very young. But it became clear to me right away why Jack was so successful with women. All the rest of us were two guys: one, as it were, by day, and another when we were thinking about or near women. Jack is always the second one.”\n\nThis may explain Nicholson’s long commitment to the project, which began when his friend Jim Harrison, the novelist who wrote Wolf‘s screenplay with Wesley Strick, told him of his own lycanthropic experience. Harrison, a naturalist given to prowling alone through Michigan forests during full moons, happened one night upon a female wolf whose back was broken. Harrison tried to pick her up and “she went into my mouth,” as he retells it over the phone from his winter home in Arizona. “Later that night, I suddenly awoke and leapt up to touch a chandelier that I’d never been able to reach. Then I tore down the cabin door and ran out to howl at the moon.”\n\nNo stranger to midnight howling himself, Nicholson encouraged Harrison to write about it, and committed to the film three hours after Harrison dropped the third draft of the script on his lap five years later.\n\nNicholson, of course, envisioned a sexy wolf. “What this film says about male sexuality is that no matter how much men may want to suppress their sexuality, they will not be able to do it. Se, a wolf, don’t have no psychology. We’re always looking at things psychologically that are glandular, and glands are a body system meant to overpower. That’s how we got ourselves twisted around,” he says, sounding more like Iron John than Wolfman Jack.\n\nNicholson flashes a seductive grin as he stealthily circles his smoky, cavelike living room, greeting the night by switching on the Art Deco Floor lamps with coiled-snake bases and shades of Gallé glass. Behind Nicholson’s brawny shoulders, a Soutine woman stares down at me from a painting, looking astonished at her owner’s audacity.\n\nThe sensitive-guy pose, according to Nicholson, is kaput. Wolves are having a comeback. Women are running with them, and men are turning into them—again. The wolf archetype—strong, shrewd, and certainly sexual—has long crawled through myth and popular culture. But feminists declawed the beast, turning hot-blooded he-men into sniveling pups. The re-emergence of the wolf, confirmed by Nicholson’s performance, may well signal a re-endowment of American manhood—a crusade right up Nicholson’s alley.\n\nIn the battle between the sexes, Jack Nicholson has always been on the front—a scout, a warrior, a casualty. And the last two decades have been hell. “Men always want to please women,” he says, “but these last 15 years, women have been hard to please. If you want to resist the feminist movement, the simple way to do it is to give them what they want and they’ll defeat themselves. Today you’ve got endless women in their 20s and 30s who don’t know if they want to be a mother, have lunch, or be secretary of state.”\n\nNicholson is rolling now, recumbent in an elegant chair covered in blue velvet. The fabric seems to suit him perfectly; you can’t imagine him allowing anything less than sensual to touch any part of his body. Even at his most intellectual, Nicholson is incurably hedonistic.”\n\nI’m no better off than any other guy,” he continues. “What have I done to try and adjust? Everything from ‘Who’s going to cook dinner? No one, I’m buying it’ to ‘I want to be a movie star. I’m sorry I had a baby.’\n\n“Listen, I’m out there right now. I’m looking around with a very dispassionate eye, since I’m not looking to hook up with nothing. And, in a month’s time, you hear the same sentence 5,206 times in a row: “Women have it tough; you men are only interested in teenagers.’ That is not true. The women who raised me—Mud, Lorraine, and June—never went around saying, ‘Women got it tough.’ They said, ‘Look what this prick did to me in the business.’”\n\nThese days, Nicholson, who keeps rock-star hours despite his penchant for early-morning golf, prefers to go out alone or with pals such as Alan Finkelstein, owner of the Monkey Bar. “Women won’t come up to me,” Nicholson says, pacing past two paintings—a Maxfield Parrish and a William Merritt Chase—propped against his Ruhlmann leopardskin settee. “It’s easier if I encourage them,” he says, his eyes darting back and forth between the paintings, sent by a hopeful retailer. He tells me he doesn’t date, doesn’t plan, and won’t commit further than dinner that night. He tried the dating thing once a few years ago, and it wasn’t until he made “the date” that he realized he’d never had one before. He won’t say with whom or when this historic outing occurred because “the person would know she had the only date I ever had.\n\n“Anyway, it was the worst week of my life, waiting for this goddamned day. When I called her, I really wanted to see her. By the time it happened, I didn’t, but I didn’t know the person well enough to cancel. I would have felt stupid.”\n\nInstead he spent the seven days before “in a frenzy,” he says. “In her mind, it was a simple, casual thing. She didn’t know I was having a literary experience on my side of the table. I’m sure she thought I was just strange.\n\n“I’m very shy,” he sighs. “I’m not that easy to fuck, you know. It’s a natural discernment. I’m certainly free enough for it. I don’t have any theory about fucking in a phone booth with a total stranger, but I believe in intimacy and privacy. In today’s world, that makes you a little withdrawn.” Nicholson shrugs, temporarily resigned.\n\n“My type of man is not attracted to society at this moment,” he mourns. “The fun is gone. There is a quiet desperation in it all. I’ve been a very social person all my life. So, if I’m backed off, if all my type is backed off, then the fun quotient, in my opinion, is going to drop . . . You know? All this flat-belly bullshit is killing the country. It didn’t matter to the great thinkers of our time. Reich said a long time ago that the flat-bellied male martinet is the main problem with our entire culture. The guy was better than Nostradamus.”\n\nNicholson moans, starts nervously pulling up the tops of his expensive argyle socks, and begins to talk about books. A voracious reader, he reads everything, even The Bridges of Madison County, “a beautiful little book.” “The guy in the book feels his kind of guy is the problem—too much testosterone for society to control. His kind of male is going to become obsolete, and I can identify with that. I know what he was talking about.”\n\nHe rolls his eyes and turns irascible, back to the feminist thing. “This is so far below where I had hoped the battle would be pitched that I’m not interested.”\n\nThe problem is this: Jack Nicholson just wants to tell the truth about all the women he loves to all the women he loves. But he can’t. And it makes him feel penned in and put out. “I’m forced by the nature of life,” he says, “to lie in public. Say you’re going with someone and seeing someone else. Eventually, the woman you’re seeing makes the same accusations as the primary person. But the last thing I’m going to do is lie to the other woman, because I don’t have to.”\n\nDid he ever lie to Anjelica Huston? “I lived with Anjelica,” he roars. “Of course I lied to her. It’s the other woman I would never lie to. You only lie to two people in your life: your girlfriend and the police. Everybody else you tell the truth to.”\n\nNicholson makes no secret of his rapscallion nature. “Women have no emotional shelter, because it comes with the package,” he storms. “Don’t come in, baby, if you don’t know that. Don’t think you’re going to have a free ‘Oh, he’s all mine,’ because I cannot provide it.”\n\n“Don’t believe all of it,” Nicholson’s old pal Alan Finkelstein tells me. “He’s not as tough as he’s going to make himself out to be.” He chuckles. “Jack will change. He’ll bend. In fact, he’ll probably be the first in the relationship to compromise because of who he believes he is.” Which is? “A nice guy.”\n\nNicholson, for all his bluster, does admit to “intermittent monogamy. I can go the other way,” he adds. “It’s a matter of communication.”\n\nMoments later, there’s no problem in communication. When I ask him why all the famous guys in Hollywood had to visit Heidi Fleiss for a good time, he unfurls his old wily-scamp smile: “Pe-cu-li-ar-i-ties,” he says, caressing each syllable of the word, sucking the juice out of every voluptuous vowel. “I don’t know why a guy goes to a hooker. I’ve confessed that as a limitation. I’m too Calvinist. And besides,” he adds, mimicking himself, “I’m Big Jack. I don’t have to pay for it, and I need to know the person is there.” Then, baring his soul, the wolf changes the subject abruptly to intone a solemn confidence: “Men don’t leave,” he tells me, and I sense that his thoughts have re-turned to Rebecca. “Women leave and when they end the relationship the other guy is already there. They always know where they are going.”\n\nThis one’s all soul,” Jack used to say about Rebecca Broussard, a Kentucky blonde with a direct, down-to-earth manner. You expect a stunning Hollywood starlet, a wild girl who can keep up with her barely housebroken near-husband. But Rebecca Broussard is now a baby-on-the-hip kind of gal, different from the would-be actress who once paid her rent by appearing in TV commercials and waiting tables at Helena’s. (“She was a hard worker,” Helena told me with respect in her voice.)\n\n“The first time Jack Nicholson touched my hand, I almost blacked out,” Rebecca remembers. “I saw flashes of light. The minute I was introduced to him, I knew something was there.”\n\nShe did not meet Nicholson through his daughter Jennifer, who is also 31. Some gossips have implied that she used her friendship with Jennifer to meet the actor. But there’s a sense of righteous indignation in her voice when she tells me just how much that story galls her. She and Nicholson met through a mutual friend when she was in her mid-20s.\n\n“I told myself, ‘Stop, Rebecca, he’s a movie star,’ but Jack was very smart and very odd . . . exciting and yet insecure, very vulnerable and sensitive. All the things you wouldn’t think he’d be.” The attraction, she says, was so strong that Broussard was willing to put up with Nicholson’s long-term relationship with Anjelica Huston.\n\n“Rebecca seemed less affected by how Jack was,” says Alan Finkelstein. “That’s the first barrier women come across—who Jack is and how to deal with it. I thought she had a sense about him.” When Broussard tells me that 10 minutes after the earthquake Jack Nicholson was at her door, checking on her and the kids, there is a sense of loss in her voice, a lingering sadness and affection. You sense certain regrets in her about the past and old choices. “Jack is a fantastic man. He’s been very instrumental in all the things I know about today. This is a terrific father. He sees the kids even more than he did before.\n\n“It’s difficult breaking up a family,” she continues. “Each day, when I look at my children, I’m reminded that it didn’t work out as a relationship. But as two parents, it will always work out. Jack will always be in my life. We will always have each other and our children. Lorraine and Raymond are crazy about him.”\n\n“A very interesting guy,” she calls Jack, speaking rather quietly. “He always made me feel very much like a lady.” In the background, I hear little Ray negotiating shrewdly for “a red pop,” then “a white pop.” Like his father, he cannot seem to choose.\n\nExperience has not robbed Jack Nicholson of his innocence. But it has tried. “Could I fall in love again?” he repeats when I ask the question. “I’m thinking I’m not going to, behaving as if I’m not, and my life has been very different as a result. I’m not as open. I’d never say it can’t happen, nor that I hope it might.” Could he love Rebecca again?\n\n“Half our problem is trying to define what in the name of God we’re doing,” he says, beginning a response that is—in typical Nicholson fashion—elliptical yet revealing. “The minute you think you can see the track all the way to the horizon, you trip over your own feet. I don’t like to define something, because it’s a-ways wrong. You wind up hearing, ‘But didn’t you say that?’ Yeah, I said that last year. But here we are this year, laughing, warbling, and howling. All I want to make clear is this: I’m on our side. I’m not against anything human.”\n\nIt is six o’clock and Nicholson has just gotten home from the set of The Crossing Guard, which is being directed by Sean Penn. His co-star is Anjelica Huston. They play—get ready—a divorced couple who loathe each other. “Anjelica wanted to do the movie, which surprised me, but I’m not about to say I don’t want to work with Anjelica Huston. I was more surprised that she wanted to. As long as she did, that’s good by me. She’s got a lot of hideous things to say to me in the movie,” Jack laughs. “I’m sure that’s why she wanted to do it. I’m only kidding. But our scenes are all vicious.”\n\nI ask if he and Anjelica are in touch. “I saw her in passing at the inaugural. She was with Bob [the sculptor Robert Graham, her husband]. . . . She’s a married woman.”\n\nGrinding out one Marlboro as he fires up its successor, Nicholson allows that maybe his priorities need rearranging. “I’ve always wandered around thinking, How did I ever get in this lucky position? It’s only in the last year or two,” he says, pausing, “that I suddenly thought, You give your life to this job. No joke. You give your total fucking life.” Clearly, Nicholson is rethinking what he wants to do on every front. He doesn’t have to work; he’s worth around $50 million, thanks to the back-end deal he worked out on Batman. After Crossing Guard, he has no commitments—except to his children.\n\nNicholson beams audibly when he talks about Ray, his only son, whom he had wanted to name Landslide Nicholson. Rebecca, however, held out for sanity. “Ray may have a problem with being a little too good-looking,” Nicholson says. “Looks exactly like Rebecca. When he was born, he looked like one of the farmers in The Magnificent Seven. He does move like me. There’s a lot of body language on him. You don’t miss them Nicholson legs. Somebody’s got to get them, poor thing. They’re useful but short. Most infants pretty much don’t have chins. But Ray always had a jaw. You can’t wait to get him into a collar or a shaving commercial.”\n\nHis daughter already has Nicholson baffled. “Lorraine is one of the great people, a totally unique human being,” he says of the pretty little girl with her father’s eyebrows, who refuses to wear any-thing but dresses. “She’s already got her own theories, her own philosophies.” He begins to tell me about going to school with Lorraine, a scene I can barely imagine: visualize, if you will, walking into your pre-schooler’s classroom and finding Big Jack sitting in the front row. Smiling.\n\n“I loved it,” he tells me. “I liked being around a bunch of three-year-olds at a time when I was emotionally three years old myself. I was having a few separation and abandonment anxieties of my own. So watching them get formed kind of muted my response. I wasn’t as free to self-dramatize. It had a very good effect on me. I’ll miss it this year. She’s in the morning group, you know. Morning ain’t my deal.”\n\nHe begins to moan over his Tang vases, broken in the earthquake, a piddling natural disaster that feels almost like an aftershock next to his personal dilemmas. His voice, the suggestive slur that snakes like a thick, salty stream through his confessions and innuendos, is beginning to sound fatigued. He brightens as he starts to tell me about the friends who have seen him through the wars. Newly excited, he describes his favorite Christmas present, a poem which cheered him at a low moment. “I hadn’t seen Meryl Streep in years and years and one day she just shows up with it. How does she know what I’m going through? Wait a minute. I’ll get my glasses and read it to you.” Momentarily he returns with “The Meaning of Birds,” from Charlie Smith’s book Indistinguishable from the Darkness:\n\nOf the genesis of birds we know nothing, save the legend they are descended from reptiles: flying, snap jawed lizards that have somehow taken to air.\n\n...But what does it matter anyway how they got up high . . . ?\n\n...We are often far from home in a dark town, and our griefs are difficult to translate into a language understood by others.\n\n...But still, it is morning again, this day.\n\nIn the flowering trees\n\nthe birds take up their indifferent, elegant cries.\n\nLook around. Perhaps it isn’t too late to make a fool of yourself again.\n\nPerhaps it isn’t too late\n\nto flap your arms and cry out, to give one more cracked rendition of your\n\nsingular, aspirant song.\n\n“Says it all, don’t it?” he concludes, smiling, his eyes turning toward the door. The kids are due for dinner. Jack Nicholson is no lone wolf."
