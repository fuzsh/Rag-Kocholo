        "text": "Please join us in congratulating THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS star Greg Rikaart (Kevin) and his husband, Robert Sudduth, on their sixth wedding anniversary! “In the desert celebrating six years of wedded bliss with my bae,” he posted on May 12 (although their actual anniversary was on May 9). “Well, Sunday was six years, but we didn’t wanna take away from you muthas!” he added.\n\nRikaart is best known to soap fans for playing Kevin Fisher on Y&R, a role he originated in 2003, though he also had a brief stint as Leo Stark on NBC sudser DAYS OF OUR LIVES in 2018. Sudduth is also in show business, starting off as an actor before segueing behind the camera as a writer and producer of series like CGB, THE REAL O’NEALS, and ZOEY’S EXTRAORDINARY PLAYLIST.\n\nRikaart went public with his romance with Sudduth in June 2013 and the couple tied the knot in a beautiful beachside ceremony in Maui in May 2015. Then, on June 12, 2016, their son, Montgomery Argo Rikaart-Sudduth was born via surrogate. They also have an adorable little puppy, and Rikaart’s pal Rebecca Budig (ex-Hayden, GENERAL HOSPITAL) joked that the dads should take advantage of their little mini-vacation! “Enjoy that bliss,” she teased, “because it will come to a screeching halt when you are back with that dog!”\n\nSome of Rikaart’s other Y&R castmates also joined the fans in wishing the pair a happy anniversary, including Melissa Ordway (Abby), Lachlan Buchanan (ex-Kyle), Lauralee Bell (Christine), Michelle Stafford (Phyllis), and Bryton James (Devon). “Are you serious?” Doug Davidson (Paul) marveled. “Time flies!”\n\nAll the best to Rikaart and Sudduth for a lifetime of happiness!"
