        "text": "Born on August 13, 1988, in Boulder, Colorado, USA, Rebecca Liddicoat is an American housewife who is busy doing house chores and raising her beautiful child.\n\nHow come a housewife is so popular? Let us update you that she gained fame and recognization because of her former husband's popularity. She is known for being the ex-wife of Robert Griffin III, an American NFL football player.\n\nHas An Amazing Family\n\nLiddicoat comes from a very intellectual family, as her parents are highly educated. She was born to Edward Liddicoat and Laura Liddicoat. Her mother, Laura, is a toxicologist, whereas her father, Edward profession is still behind the curtains.\n\nBesides her lovely parents, she also has an adorable sibling with whom she spent her childhood and went to school. She is the younger sister of Lindsey Liddicoat. She is currently working as a maid of honor.\n\nIn addition, some stories say that Edward holds a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. However, it has not been confirmed yet.\n\nLiddicoat Is The Ex-Wife of Robert Griffin III\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Rebecca Liddicoat became prominent after she tied the knot with American footballer Robert Griffin III. The former couple exchanged their vows on July 6, 2013, with a grand celebration at the Denver Four Seasons Hotel.\n\nBefore tying the knot, Liddicoat and Robert had been dating for four years. They first met at Baylor University as they used to study there. After the first meeting, they became closer and started feeling for each other.\n\nSoon after graduating from university, the former lovebirds announced their engagement and exchanged rings in October 2010. They waited for three years for their wedding ceremony.\n\nUnfortunately, the happy and prosperous married life ended on September 7, 2016, due to misunderstandings. They got apart after staying together for three years.\n\nBlessed With One Lovely Child\n\nIt is no surprise that Liddicoat shares a beautiful daughter with her beloved former spouse Robert. They first got an opportunity to become parents after they welcomed Reese Ann Griffin on May 21, 2015.\n\nFurthermore, Griffin was only one year old when her parents parted ways. Since then, she has not been able to see their parents together. The family of three lived prosperous life for only seventeen months.\n\nCurrently, Griffin is enjoying her childhood and residing with her lovely mother. This is because her mother, Liddicoat, got custody of her after the divorce.\n\nWhat Happened After The Divorce?\n\nLiddicoat and her former husband Robert made their separate way after the divorce. But the question is, where are they, and what are they doing now? To know about their current life activities, stay tuned with us.\n\nRegarding Liddicoat, she decided to remain single and spend the rest of her life raising her daughter. As a result, she is currently enjoying her solo life to the fullest.\n\nHowever, the scenario mentioned above does not apply to Robert as he moved on from his relationship and married another woman named Grete Ã… adeiko, an Estonian heptathlete. They have been living together since March 10, 2018.\n\nWithin these four years, Grete and Robert are already blessed with two beautiful children, Gloria Griffin, and Gameya Griffin. Some news says that Robert was the reason behind his previous unsuccessful married life.\n\nIs Rebecca Liddicoat A Millionaire?\n\nWell, it is still a mystery whether Liddicoat lives a wealthy life. However, online tabloids say she is a millionaire with a massive fortune of $2 million in her bank account just like Chelsea Kilgore.\n\nShe earned most of that money from her former husband as alimony. After the divorce, the court granted her $1.1 million and full child custody. Since then, she has become a millionaire.\n\nDid You Know? The divorce settlement agreement amount was half of Texa's home value. At that time, the mansion had a market value of $2 million. On top of that, Robert has to pay $36,000 as a child's support allowance monthly.\n\nHow Tall Is Liddicoat? Know Her Height\n\nThe celebrity ex-wife Liddicoat stands at a decent height of 5 feet 10 inches (177 cm), weighing around 59 kg (130 lbs) which is suitable for her size. She has a slim and slender body.\n\nFurthermore, she has fair skin with beautiful brown eyes. People in the US admire her shining brown eyes, which makes her more attractive. Talking about tattoos, she has not done it. It appears she loves her natural skin.\n\nGraduated From Baylor University\n\nTalking about Rebecca Liddicoat's academic background, she completed her high school at Cooper's Cove High School, a public school in Texas. She finished high school with good grades.\n\nSoon after completing, she chooses Baylor University for her higher studies. She studied there for four years and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biology just like Tayshia Adams.\n\nWhat Is Liddicoat Currently Doing?\n\nAforesaid, Liddicoat is currently spending her life doing house chores and raising her lovely daughter Ann Griffin. Since she likes to keep things low-key, there are no further details.\n\nHowever, some US people say she is presently working as a biologist. After the separation, she resumed her career and worked hard for her daughter's better livelihood.\n\nThe news mentioned above is just a conspiracy, as it has not been officially confirmed yet. Some rumors also say that Liddicoat has been dead as she has not been seen onscreen for several years.\n\nOut of all these, she is likely to become a housewife with full responsibility for her child. The shocking fact is she does not allow her daughter Griffin to meet her father.\n\nSocial Media Presence\n\nRebecca Liddicoat is not found on any social media platforms as she does not have a profile. It appears she loves enjoying her own space without any disturbance. Therefore, it is not easy to tell about her daily activities.\n\nHowever, IMDb consists of her profile with one self-credit.

As per IMDb, she has appeared in a TV documentary named RGIII: The Will to Win.\n\nFor more exciting biographies of celebrities, stay tuned with MarriedCeleb.\n\nncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqucm52TmK5uuMidm6Kbn5bB"
