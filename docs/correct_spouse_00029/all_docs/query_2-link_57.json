        "text": "Congratulations to Haley Erin on her marriage to Adam Fergus! The actress, best known for playing GENERAL HOSPITAL’s Kiki and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS’ Abby, dropped the surprise announcement in an Instagram post wishing her new hubby a happy birthday! “Had to pop in and wish my husband a happy day of birth,” she wrote. “I f***in’ love you, man. And many thanks to the incomparable Sheen Falls Lodge for our honeymoon!”\n\nNaturally, Erin’s GH castmates flooded the comments with well-wishes along with her fans. “Look how life unfolds!” marveled Laura Wright (Carly). “So beautiful! Congratulations!” Kristen Alderson, who played Kiki before Erin took over, wrote: “Husband?! Yay! Congratulations! You two are beyond amazing together, so happy for you!”\n\nMichelle Stafford (Phyllis, Y&R; ex-Nina, GH), Tamara Braun (ex-Kim, GH), and Rebecca Budig (ex-Hayden) all offered congratulations and Eden McCoy (Josslyn) joked, “Is the bachelorette party information to follow?”\n\nErin’s husband is an Irish actor who starred in BEING ERICA, appeared on SUPERNATURAL in its twelfth season, and most recently in the film The Call of the Wild. He also commented on her Instagram post with: “You’re simply the best” followed by a heart emoji. The couple honeymooned at the luxurious five-star hotel Sheen Falls Lodge in Kerry, Ireland where they enjoyed the gorgeous scenery, some Guinness, and even did some skeet shooting!"
