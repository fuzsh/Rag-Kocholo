Following the rejection, the popular contestant was offered the bachelor position on season four of “The Bachelor.” Instead of marrying the woman he proposed to at the end of the series in 2003, Estella Gardinier, he ended up finding romance with established soap star Budig. Budig and Guiney met in early 2003 while Budig began hosting “The Bachelor XYZ” (repeats of the original series) on the ABC Family network. Guiney and Budig married on July 13, 2004. The marriage marked Budig’s second. Budig married Daniel Geller on June 1, 2001, the marriage ended in divorce four months later.\n\nIn a joint-statement given to People Magazine, the pair simply states: “We love each other very much. We are best friends and don’t know what the future holds.”\n\n“All My Children” airs Weekdays on ABC. Weeknights on SOAPnet. Check local listings. “AMC” now also airs online at ABC.com and can be accessed 24/7."
