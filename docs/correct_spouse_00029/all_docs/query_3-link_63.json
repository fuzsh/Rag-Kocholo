        "text": "By Carrie Pitzer\n\nIt was a cold, dreary spring day. But the laughter still echoed through the Page United Methodist Church.\n\nBob and Shari Ickes erupted in laughter often as daughter Rachael Cheatum started yet another story about her little sister, “Remember when Bec . . . .”\n\nIt’s been just eight months since Rebecca Ickes Hausmann lost her battle with colon cancer, leaving behind five young children, a husband and countless family and friends who adored her. Sitting at a table in the fellowship hall, it was one story after another, all with the same message — strength, love, faith. But most of all faith.\n\n​“Two days before she went to heaven she was so tired,” Bob remembered. “I walked her back to the couch, and she said, ‘Dad, this healing is really taking a lot out of me.’ She called it healing because she never faltered in her faith.”\n\n​\n\nNo Symptoms of Cancer\n\nRebecca made having five children look easy, Rachael recalled. She balanced motherhood perfectly as she and Joey raised Ashton, Cooper, Alivia, Kiffin and Beckett in Lincoln.\n\nLife seemed to be going so smoothly that even Rebecca had a feeling that she would soon be tested.\n\nThen it happened. Just days before Rebecca’s 35th birthday she went to the doctor in O’Neill due to abdominal pain. A CT revealed a blockage in her colon and spots on her liver. Surgery and tests followed, revealing the unthinkable - Stage 4 colon cancer.\n\nRachael said her sister was the picture of good health. She exercised daily and ate well. But cancer knows no boundaries. Rebecca blamed some stomach issues on gluten and changed her diet, which seemed to help.\n\nThere were no typical symptoms of colon cancer, which made the diagnosis shocking. But Shari said her youngest daughter didn’t waiver.\n\n“She had been working on her faith. Once she was diagnosed, she kicked it into high gear,” Shari said. “She never faltered from the day she was diagnosed. She was amazing. Never once said, ‘Why me?’ ”\n\nRebecca was just a sophomore in high school when Shari was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer, so Shari could relate to Rebecca’s illness, at least the idea of having cancer. Just a teen, Rebecca took over the household duties, never complaining. She cooked, cleaned, whatever was needed.\n\nWith the tables turned, Shari watched her daughter in awe, battling a disease that was 100 times worse than hers ever was. Still, she only saw Rebecca cry once.\n\nOne day Shari asked her son-in-law what Rebecca was like when no one was around. After all, she had to break down at some point.\n\n​“You see what I see,” Joey told her.\n\n​\n\nUnlikely Blessings\n\nCancer took Rebecca in less than 7 months. Bob said he thought up until the last couple of days that Rebecca was going to beat the cancer.\n\n“We prayed for a miracle,” Bob said. “It wasn’t looking good, and we prayed for a miracle. We agreed the next day that God did show up. He just didn’t show up the way we wanted him to. He showed up and took her home, and that was a miracle.”\n\nThe family admits it sounds odd to call those last months blessings, but they were. After all, Bob said, how many people can truly live like they’re dying? Rebecca did.\n\nThe Hausmanns took trips with their children, all while Rebecca was being treated. They said the things people should say but rarely have the opportunity. During her last week, she wrote cards and letters for her children’s future birthdays, graduations, weddings.\n\nThey recorded her speaking to them about not using cancer as an excuse and what she hoped and knew her children could become. She was a mother, preparing them for their future, even as she was dying.\n\n​“I was so amazed by her,” Shari said. “After kids leave the nest, they have a tendency to walk, and you hope they come back. You’re ultimate goal is to get them to heaven. She got to go a little sooner than we hoped, but we know she’s there. We’ve done our job and she’s back in God’s hands.”\n\n​\n\nLook For Me In Rainbows\n\nDuring the last few days, Rebecca asked her mother to find a specific poem for the funeral. She ran across “Look For Me In Rainbows,” and Rebecca immediately responded. “That’s the one,” she told her mom.\n\nHer family quickly discovered how right Rebecca was. After her death, they saw rainbows on nearly every special day - the first day of school, athletic events, open houses, rainbows arching over their own home.\n\n“There were so many times rainbows appeared when they were needed,” Rachael said. “We had signs.”\n\nDriving through Columbus on Christmas Day, Shari, Joey and the kids saw a rainbow. “How often do you see that in the middle of winter? Look for me in rainbows,” she said while nodding.\n\n“We all saw it,” Rachael said. “I saw it in Orchard, Dad in Page, Matt saw it in Lynch.”\n\nAnd there have been other signs. Just a couple of days after the funeral, Bob was sitting outside in a chair all alone. There was no wind, but still a feather floated down from a tree. He looked up; there were no birds.\n\n​\n\n“I said, ‘Bec, if that’s really you, show me again.’ It wasn’t very long and another feather floated down in the same spot,” Bob said. “That’s not a coincidence for me. I believe. That’s my story of Rebecca.”"
