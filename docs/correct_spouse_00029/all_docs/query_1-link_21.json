        "text": "Rebecca “Becky” Lynn MacDonald, 60 of Frederic, passed away on Thursday, May 30, 2024 at her home surrounded by family.\n\nBorn on May 17, 1964 in Port Huron, MI to William and Meredith (Rutkofske) Brown, she graduated from Davison High School in 1982. A year later, she married her lifelong-love Robert “Bob” MacDonald on May 27, 1983.\n\nShe held various positions outside of the home, which included supporting military families through an in-home daycare for many years. Her most coveted role was being a mother to her three children. As a military spouse, she called many places home, ultimately settling in her cozy, wooded cabin in Frederic, MI in 2015.\n\nBecky enjoyed staying active and supported cancer research and military relief efforts through participating in 5k events. She cherished spending time with her grandchildren, crocheting, and being outdoors, amongst nature. She would often share beautiful photos taken on her long walks with her family and friends.\n\nShe is survived by Bob, her husband of 41 years; her three children, Breanne MacDonald (Alex Sanchez), William (Jessica-Raye) MacDonald, and Jessica (Ryan Daly) Haight; her eight grandchildren, Parker, Ashlyn, Paityn, Kaidyn, Kynnslee, Charlee-Ann, Oaklynn, and Jaxon; her father William Brown; brothers Thomas (Karla) Brown and Scott (Debbie) Brown. She is preceded in death by her mother.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 1:00 pm Friday, June 7, 2024 at Gaylord Community Funeral Home & Cremation Service, 850 N Center Ave, Gaylord, MI 49735 with Pastor Allen Ballard officiating. The family will visit with friends at the funeral home beginning at 12:00 noon on Friday, and a luncheon will follow at the Eagles, 515 S Wisconsin Ave, Gaylord, MI 49735.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that those who wish may make memorial contributions to 22 2 None through Gaylord Community Funeral Home & Cremation Service, P.O. Box 249, Gaylord, MI 49734.\n\nPlease share your memories, personal messages and photos with her family on the guestbook below."
