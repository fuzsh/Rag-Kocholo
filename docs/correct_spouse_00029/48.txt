Bob Guiney, the fourth season's "The Bachelor" and a contestant on the first season of "The Bachelorette," and wife Rebecca Budig, who plays Greenlee on "All My Children," are calling it quits.

A source close to the couple tells People Magazine, "They've been on the rocks for a long time, and lately it's become clear that nothing is going to save this. They've grown apart and are no longer the people they were when they got married."
