“Bachelor” Bob Guiney’s wife has officially handed in her final rose.

After five years of marriage, “All My Children” actress Rebecca Budig filed for divorce from the former reality star in Los Angeles Superior Court, according to People.

As previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, the couple has been on the outs for quite some time.

“Lately it’s become clear that nothing is going to save this,” a friend of Budig told People in January, when rumors of a split first surfaced. “They’ve just grown apart and are no longer the people they were when they got married… They’ve been on the rocks for a long time.”

In her recent filing in LA, Budig has asked the court to deny granting Guiney any spousal support.

The couple, who tied the knot in 2004, has no children. They reportedly met while Budig was hosting repeats of “The Bachelor” for ABC Family.

Guiney appeared on the first season of “The Bachelorette” as a suitor for Trista Rehn (who is now Trista Sutter).

Budig plays Greenlee Smythe on the long-running soap “All My Children.”
