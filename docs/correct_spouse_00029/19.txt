People Magazine is reporting that reputable sources have indicated that “All My Children” star Rebecca Budig and her husband Bob Guiney have decided to call it splits.

Bob Guiney climbed to fame on the first season of the reality-series “The Bachelorette,” where he was rejected by the series star Trista Rehn (Stutter). Following the rejection, the popular contestant was offered the bachelor position on season four of “The Bachelor.” Instead of marrying the woman he proposed to at the end of the series in 2003, Estella Gardinier, he ended up finding romance with established soap star Budig. Budig and Guiney met in early 2003 while Budig began hosting “The Bachelor XYZ” (repeats of the original series) on the ABC Family network. Guiney and Budig married on July 13, 2004. The marriage marked Budig’s second. Budig married Daniel Geller on June 1, 2001, the marriage ended in divorce four months later.

In a joint-statement given to People Magazine, the pair simply states: “We love each other very much. We are best friends and don’t know what the future holds.”
