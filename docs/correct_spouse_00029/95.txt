The Bachelor star Bob Guiney and his actress wife Rebecca Budig are to divorce after five years of marriage.

Budig, who stars as Greenlee Smythe on All My Children, filed for legal separation from Guiney at Los Angeles Superior Court, says People.

The actress is thought to be asking the court to deny Guiney spousal support. The couple have no children.
