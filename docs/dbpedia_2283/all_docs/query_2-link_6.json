        "text": "“As I stood at the foot of the cross, this pure white garment became saturated with the streams of crimson blood which gushed from His precious body!”\n\n—Our Lady to Saint Anselm\n\nThere is no human person who loved Christ more than Mary. And there is no greater act of love than Christ’s sacrifice on the cross.\n\nIn these pages, you will find two of the most stirring revelations of Christ’s passion and death ever recorded by Doctors of the Church—Saint Anselm, the Magnificent Doctor, along with writings attributed to Saint Bernard, the Mellifluous Doctor. These private revelations given by Our Lady will enhance one’s prayer life while drawing one deeper into the passion narratives of the Gospels. But what makes this book unique is the heartfelt dialogue between Our Lady and her spiritual sons. Those who read this book will be profoundly moved to not only weep for their sins but to weep for Him whose Blood was completely emptied for our salvation.\n\nThe Mother of Sorrows is the woman of the interior life who leads us to the Master of the interior life, the Man of Sorrows. There is no better way to contemplate the passion of Christ than through the eyes of Mary, she who loved Him above everything, she who loved Him with a mother’s heart, and she who stood firmly when everyone else fled."
