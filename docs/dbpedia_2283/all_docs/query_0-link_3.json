        "text": "Learning Objectives\n\nLearn what strategic management is.\n\nUnderstand the key question addressed by strategic management.\n\nUnderstand why it is valuable to consider different definitions of strategy.\n\nLearn what is meant by each of the 5 Pâs of strategy.\n\nWhat Is Strategic Management?\n\nBoiled down to its simplest, strategy is basically about making choicesâ¦ For you, which career interests you, who to marry/partner, whether to have children, or car and house ownership, and even whether investing in post-secondary education is to your advantage or not. For corporations, which product/service to sell, the right balance of labour (people) and capital (machines) to use in producing the product/service and where to physically locate among the hundreds if not thousands of strategic choices. Choices.\n\nStudying strategic management is the combination of learning about various models which can assist us on how and why to make these strategic choices, coupled with lots of case studies on the results actual companies and people achieved â case studies.\n\nIn our first case study, issues such as those currently faced by BlackBerry and Apple are the focus of strategic management because they help answer the key question ââWhy do some firms outperform other firms?â More specifically, strategic management examines how actions and events involving top executives (such as Steve Jobs), firms (Apple), and industries (the wireless market) influence a firmâs success or failure. Formal tools exist to help us better understanding these relationships. Many of these tools will be explained and applied in this book. But formal tools are not enough; creativity is just as important to strategic management. Mastering strategy is therefore part art and part science.\n\nThis introductory chapter is intended to enable you to understand what strategic management is and why it is important. Because strategy is a complex concept, we begin by explaining five different ways to think about what strategy involves (the Five Pâs). Next, we journey across many centuries to examine the evolution of strategy from ancient times until today. We end this chapter by presenting a conceptual model that maps out one way that executives can work toward mastering strategy. The model also provides an overall portrait of this bookâs contents by organizing the remaining nine chapters into a coherent whole.\n\nDefining Strategy: The Five Pâs\n\nDefining strategy is not simple. Strategy is a complex concept that involves many different processes and activities within an organization. To capture this complexity, Professor Henry Mintzberg of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, articulated what he labelled as âthe 5 Pâs of strategy.â According to Mintzberg, understanding how strategy can be viewed as a plan, as a ploy, as a position, as a pattern, and as a perspective is important. Each of these five ways of thinking about strategy is necessary for understanding what strategy is, but none of them alone is sufficient to master the concept (Mintzberg, 1987).\n\nUnderstanding different ways of thinking about strategy is the first step toward mastering the art and science of strategic management. The five Pâs of strategy developed from the work of Henry Mintzberg help to provide an overview of the most commonly used definitions of strategy.\n\nPlan: A carefully crafted set of steps that a firm intends to follow in order to be successful. Virtually every firm creates a strategic plan to guide its future. If you are reading this, you probably have a plan that requires a college degree or diploma.\n\nPloy: A specific move designed to outwit or trick competitors. An inquiry in Quebec discussed links between the construction industry and organized crime involving payoffs to be assured of getting profitable contracts.\n\nPattern: The degree of consistency in a firmâs strategic actions. Apple responds to competitive challenges by innovating. Some of these innovations are complete busts, but enough are successful that Appleâs overall performance is excellent.\n\nPosition: A firmâs place in the industry relative to its competitors. Loblaw Companies Ltd. offers Zehrâs, a higher-end grocery store, as well as No Frills, Extra Foods and SuperValu, which are positioned at different pricing levels.\n\nPerspective: How executives interpret the landscape around them. In the mid-1990s, the Internet was mainly a communications tool. Jeff Bezos of Amazon saw it as a sales channel for selling books online. Now Amazon.comâthe business he createdâis a diversified consumer products store.\n\nStrategy as a Plan\n\nStrategic plans are the essence of strategy, according to one classic view of strategy. A strategic plan is a carefully crafted set of steps that a firm intends to follow to be successful. Virtually every organization creates a strategic plan to guide its future.\n\nWhile Apple had been a very successful computer company in the early days of the micro computer, by 1996, Appleâs performance was not strong, and Gilbert F. Amelio was appointed as CEO (chief executive officer) in the hope of reversing the companyâs fortunes. In a speech focused on strategy, Amelio described a plan that centred on leveraging the Internet (which at the time was in its infancy) and developing multimedia products and services. Appleâs subsequent success selling over the Internet via iTunes and with the iPad can be traced back to the plan articulated in 1996 (Markoff, 1996).\n\nA business model should be a central element of a firmâs strategic plan. Simply stated, a business model describes the process through which a firm hopes to earn profits. It probably wonât surprise you to learn that developing a viable business model requires that a firm sell goods or services for more than it costs the firm to create and distribute those goods. A more subtle but equally important aspect of a business model is providing customers with a good or service more cheaply than they can create it themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, large chains of pizza restaurants such as Boston Pizza and Dominoâs.\n\nBecause these firms buy their ingredients in massive quantities, they pay far less for these items than any family could (an advantage called economies of scale. Meanwhile, Boston Pizza and Dominoâs have developed specialized kitchen equipment that allows them to produce better-tasting pizza than can be created using the basic ovens that most families rely on for cooking. Pizza restaurants thus can make better-tasting pizzas for far less cost than a family can make itself. This business model provides healthy margins and has enabled Boston Pizza and Dominoâs to become massive firms.\n\nStrategic plans are important to individuals too. Indeed, a well-known proverb states that âhe who fails to plan, plans to fail.â In other words, being successful requires a person to lay out a path for the future and then follow that path. If you are reading this, earning a college degree is probably a key step in your strategic plan for your career. Donât be concerned if your plan is not fully developed, however. Life is full of unexpected twists and turns, so maintaining flexibility is wise for individuals planning their career strategies as well as for firms.\n\nFor firms, these unexpected twists and turns place limits on the value of strategic planning. Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson captured the limitations of strategic plans when he noted, âEveryone has a plan until I punch them in the face.â From that point forward, strategy is less about a plan and more about adjusting to a shifting situation. For firms, changes in the behaviour of competitors, customers, suppliers, regulators, and other external groups can all be sources of a metaphorical punch in the face. As events unfold around a firm, its strategic plan may reflect a competitive reality that no longer exists. Because the landscape of business changes rapidly, other ways of thinking about strategy are needed.\n\nStrategy as a Ploy\n\nA second way to view strategy is in terms of ploys. A strategic ploy is a specific move designed to outwit or trick competitors. Ploys often involve using creativity to enhance success.\n\nThink of Mark Twainâs Tom Sawyer, where main character Tom is stuck whitewashing a fence instead of playing or going to the swimming hole. His one attempt at bribery didnât work. He managed to convince his friends that he enjoyed painting: âLike it? Well, I donât see why I oughtnât to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?â He maneuvered his friends into gladly paying him for a chance to whitewash Aunt Pollyâs fence (Twain, 1876).\n\nPloys can be especially beneficial in the face of much stronger opponents. Military history offers quite a few illustrative examples. Before the American Revolution, land battles were usually fought by two opposing armies, each of which wore brightly coloured clothing, marching toward each other across open fields. George Washington and his officers knew that the United States could not possibly defeat better-trained and better-equipped British forces in a traditional battle. To overcome its weaknesses, the American military relied on ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, and other guerilla moves. It even broke an unwritten rule of war by targeting British officers during skirmishes. This was an effort to reduce the opponentâs effectiveness by removing its leadership.\n\nCenturies earlier, the Carthaginian general Hannibal concocted perhaps the most famous ploy ever. Carthage was at war with Rome, a scary circumstance for most Carthaginians given their far weaker fighting force. The Alps had never been crossed by an army. In fact, the Alps were considered such a treacherous mountain range that the Romans did not bother monitoring the part of their territory that bordered the Alps. No horse was up to the challenge, but Hannibal cleverly put his soldiers on elephants, and his army was able to make the mountain crossing. The Romans were caught completely unprepared and most of them were frightened by the sight of charging elephants. By using the element of surprise, Hannibal was able to lead his army to victory over a much more powerful enemy.\n\nPloys continue to be important today. In 2011, a pizzeria owner in Pennsylvania was accused of making a rather unique attempt to outmaneuver two rival pizza shops. According to police, the man tried to sabotage his competitors by placing mice in their pizzerias. If the ploy had not been discovered, the two shops could have suffered bad publicity or even been shut down by authorities because of health concerns. Although most strategic ploys are legal, this one was not, and the perpetrator was arrested (Reuters, 2011).\n\nStrategy as a Pattern\n\nStrategy as pattern is a third way to view strategy. This view focuses on the extent to which a firmâs actions over time are consistent. A lack of a strategic pattern helps explain why distillery giant Seagramâs deteriorated into massive losses and became the target of a takeover. The company was started in the mid-1850s as a distiller in Montreal. After Prohibition in the United States ended in 1933 (which itself was a boom for Seagramâs through sales to bootleggers), Seagram Co. Ltd. was ready for the pent-up demand for alcohol from U.S. consumers. At the firmâs peak in the mid-1950s, one out of every three distilled-alcohol drinks consumed by Americans was made by Seagram (Slater, 2013).\n\nCash-rich, the company began to diversify, first buying other beverage companies â wine, champagne, cognac, and even orange juice with the purchase of Tropicana Products. One of Seagramâs most profitable investments was a large minority share in chemical giant DuPont. However, in 1994, Edgar Bronfman Jr. took over at Seagramâs, and continued a diversification strategy, pushing into the entertainment business, an area that Seagrams did not know much about. Things went so poorly, in 2000, Seagram sold their profitable DuPont holdings to Franceâs Vivendi SA, a European telecommunications giant. The deal ended up destroying much of the Bronfman family fortune (Slater, 2013).\n\nIn contrast, Apple has very consistent in its strategic pattern: it always responds to competitive challenges by innovating. Some of these innovations are complete busts. Perhaps the best known was the Newton, a tablet-like device that may have been ahead of its time. Another was the Pippin, a video game system introduced in 1996 to near-universal derision. Apple TV, a 2007 offering intended to link televisions with the Internet, also was slow to attract customers. However, in 2014, the $99 box is selling pretty well: Tim Cook (Apple CEO) just told shareholders that the company generated more than $1 billion in Apple TV sales in 2013 â which implies sales of more than 10 million units. There are risks to following a pattern too closely. A consistent pattern can make a company predictable, a possibility that Apple must guard against in the years ahead (Kafta, 2014).\n\nStrategy as a Position\n\nViewing strategy as a plan, a ploy, and a pattern involve only the actions of a single firm. In contrast, the next Pâstrategy as positionâconsiders a firm and its competitors. Specifically, strategy as position refers to a firmâs place in the industry relative to its competitors. McDonaldâs, for example, has long been and remains the clear leader among fast-food chains. This position offers both good and bad aspects for McDonaldâs. One advantage of leading an industry is that many customers are familiar with and loyal to leaders. Being the market leader, however, also makes McDonaldâs a target for rivals such as Burger King and Wendyâs. These firms create their strategies with McDonaldâs as a primary concern. Old Navy offers another example of strategy as position. Old Navy has been positioned to sell fashionable clothes at competitive prices.\n\nOld Navy is owned by the same corporation (Gap Inc.) as the midlevel brand the Gap and upscale brand Banana Republic. Each of these three brands is positioned at a different pricing level. The firm hopes that as Old Navyâs customers grow older and more affluent, they will shop at the Gap and then eventually at Banana Republic. A similar positioning of different brands is pursued by General Motors through its Chevrolet (entry level), Buick (midlevel), and Cadillac (upscale) divisions.\n\nFirms can carve out a position by performing certain activities in a different manner than their rivals. WestJet Airlines Ltd., based in Calgary, Alberta, is able to position itself as a price leader. WestJet offers the lowest price and lowest cost structure, has an excellent service, and delivers a superior experience. WestJet pioneered paper-free ticketing, consumer phone bookings, and the snack and bag lunch. They use Boeing 737 airplanes exclusively, stocking parts and training staff based on one model of plane. WestJet uses an A to B model rather than a web and spokes model, which is common with airlines such as Air Canada. Air Canada accumulates people in hub cities to get them to the spokes, which are smaller centers. There is a higher cost structure to support the 1-2 hours between flights for the hub and spokes model. It should be noted that Air Canada â designated as Canadaâs national airline â is legislated to provide services to hubs and spokes. WestJet can âcherry-pick,â flying only the most profitable routes, which is an obvious major advantage not available to Air Canada (Business in Vancouver, 2003).\n\nIn addition, Westjet has equipped many of their airport gates with two airplane bridges (a second one connects to the door at the rear of the plane), enabling them to off-load and re-load passengers twice as fast as Air Canada. This quicker turn-around time directly supports higher profits â an airplane on the tarmac is simply a cost item! The only time airplanes generate income is while they are flying.\n\nWhen firms position themselves through unique goods and services that customers value, business often thrives. But when firms try to please everyone, they often find themselves without the competitive positioning needed for long-term success. Thus deciding what a firm is not going to do is just as important to strategy as deciding what it is going to do (Porter, 1996). To gain competitive advantage and greater success, firms sometimes change positions. But this can be a risky move. Zellers became a successful department store by targeting moderate-income customers. When the firm abandoned this established position to compete for wealthier customers and higher margins, the results were disastrous. The firm was forced into bankruptcy and closed many stores. Zellers eventually sold many of its locations to Target, a new entrant to the Canadian marketplace. In contrast to firms such as Zellers that changed positions, Apple has long maintained a position as a leading innovator in various industries. This positioning has served Apple well.\n\nStrategy as a Perspective\n\nThe fifth and final P shifts the focus to inside the minds of the executives running a firm. Strategy as perspective refers to how executives interpret the competitive landscape around them. Because each person is unique, two different executives could look at the same eventâsuch as a new competitor emergingâand attach different meanings to it. One might just see a new threat to his or her firmâs sales; the other might view the newcomer as a potential ally.\n\nAn old clichÃ© urges listeners to âmake lemons into lemonade.â\n\nA good example of applying this idea through strategy as perspective is provided by Newfoundland and Labrador Tourism. Ads played up the charming and old-fashioned place names such as Tickle Cove and Cupids, along with spectacular photography to create a perception of a charming, quiet, and exotic destination â compared to Disneyland. These strategists were willing to take a possibly negative situation and see the potential upside.\n\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In the mid-1990s, the Internet was mainly a communication tool for academics and government agencies. Jeff Bezos looked beyond these functions and viewed the Internet as a potential sales channel. After examining a number of different markets that he might enter using the Internet, Bezos saw strong profit potential in the bookselling business, and he began selling books online. Today, the company he createdâAmazonâhas expanded far beyond its original focus on books to become a dominant retailer in countless different markets. The late Steve Jobs at Apple appeared to take a similar perspective; he saw opportunities where others could not, and his firm has reaped significant benefits as a result.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nStrategic management focuses on firms and the different strategies that they use to become and remain successful. Multiple views of strategy exist, and the 5 Pâs described by Henry Mintzberg enhance understanding of the various ways in which firms conceptualize strategy.\n\nExercises\n\nHave you developed a strategy to manage your career?

This manager was fortunate to be in charge of a venture whose services are desperately needed by shipping companies and that offers the only simple route linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canalâs current success will be challenged with this second goes into operation. With the current increase in globalization, the additional boat transportation make both canalsÂ appear to be guaranteed to have many customers for as long as anyone can see into the future.\n\nWhen an organizationâs environment is stable and predictable, strategic planning can provide enough of a strategy for the organization to gain and maintain success. The executives leading the organization can simply create a plan and execute it, and they can be confident that their plan will not be undermined by changes over time. But as the consultantâs experience shows, only a few executivesâsuch as the manager of the Panama Canalâenjoy a stable and predictable situation. Because change affects the strategies of almost all organizations, understanding the concepts of intended, emergent, and realized strategies is important (Figure 1.5 “Strategic Planning and Learning: Intended, Emergent, and Realized Strategies”). Also relevant are deliberate and nonrealized strategies. The relationships among these five concepts are presented in Figure 1.6 “A Model of Intended, Deliberate, and Realized Strategy”Â (Mintzberg & Waters, 1985).\n\nFigure 1.5: Strategic Planning and Learning: Intended, Emergent, and Realized Strategies\n\nStrategic planning, usually in the form of a business plan, is a key aspect of creating a new venture. Many well-known firms, however, owe their success more to their ability to adapt than their original plan. Most firms begin by pursuing their plans (also known as intended strategy), but unexpected opportunities that arise over time can lead firms in much different directions than could have ever been anticipated (emergent strategy). Ultimately, the intended and emergent strategies each contribute to a firm’s realized strategy. In the cases below, the original intended strategy can barely be detected within today’s strategy.\n\nExamples of Intended, Emergent, and Realized Strategies Intended Strategy Emergent Strategy Realized Strategy Dave McConnell aspired to be a writer. When his books weren’t selling, he decided to give out perfume as a gimmick. The perfume McConnell gave out with his books were popular, inspiring the foundation of the California Perfume Company. The company changed its name to Avon in 1939, and it’s direct marketing system remained popular for decades. Avon is now available online and in retail outlets worldwide. When father and son team Scott and Don Rasmussen were fired from New England Whalers, they envisioned a cable television network that focused on sports events in the state of Connecticut. As the network became successful, ESPN branched out beyond the local softball games and demolition derbies that were first broadcasted. ESPN is now billed as the worldwide leader in sports, owning several ESPN affiliates as well as production of ESPN magazine, ESPN radio, and broadcasting for ABC. In 1977, a cash-strapped advertiser gave a radio station managed by Lowell Paxson 112 electric can openers to pay off an overdue bill. The can openers were offered over the air for $9.95 and quickly sold out. An idea emerged. Soon the radio station featured a regular show called “Suncoast Bargaineers.” In 1982, Paxson and a partner launched the Home Shopping Club on local cable television in Florida. Today the Home Shopping Network has evolved into a retail powerhouse. The company sells tens of thousands of products on television channels in several countries and over the Internet.\n\nIntended and Emergent Strategies\n\nAn intended strategyÂ is the strategy that an organization hopes to execute. Intended strategies are usually described in detail within an organizationâs strategic plan. When a strategic plan is created for a new venture, it is called a business plan. As an undergraduate student at Yale in 1965, Frederick Smith had to complete a business plan for a proposed company as a class project. His plan described a delivery system that would gain efficiency by routing packages through a central hub and then pass them to their destinations. A few years later, Smith started Federal Express (FedEx), a company whose strategy closely followed the plan laid out in his class project. Today, Frederick Smithâs personal wealth has surpassed $2 billion, and FedEx ranks eighth among the Worldâs Most Admired Companies according to Fortune magazine. Certainly, Smithâs intended strategy has worked out far better than even he could have dreamed (Donahoe, 2011).\n\nEmergent strategy has also played a role at Federal Express. An emergent strategyÂ is an unplanned strategy that arises in response to unexpected opportunities and challenges. Sometimes emergent strategies result in disasters. In the mid-1980s, FedEx deviated from its intended strategyâs focus on package delivery to capitalize on an emerging technology: facsimile (fax) machines. The firm developed a service called ZapMail that involved documents being sent electronically via fax machines between FedEx offices and then being delivered to customersâ offices. FedEx executives hoped that ZapMail would be a success because it reduced the delivery time of a document from overnight to just a couple of hours. Unfortunately, however, the ZapMail system had many technical problems that frustrated customers. Even worse, FedEx failed to anticipate that many businesses would simply purchase their own fax machines. ZapMail was shut down before long, and FedEx lost hundreds of millions of dollars following its failed emergent strategy. In retrospect, FedEx had made a costly mistake by venturing outside of the domain that was central to its intended strategy: package delivery (Funding Universe).\n\nEmergent strategies can also lead to tremendous success. Southern Bloomer Manufacturing Company was founded to make underwear for use in prisons and mental hospitals. Many managers of such institutions believe that the underwear made for retail markets by companies such as Calvin Klein and Hanes is simply not suitable for the people under their care. Instead, underwear issued to prisoners needs to be sturdy and durable to withstand the rigors of prison activities and laundering. To meet these needs, Southern Bloomers began selling underwear made of heavy cotton fabric.\n\nAn unexpected opportunity led Southern Bloomer to go beyond its intended strategy of serving institutional needs for durable underwear. Just a few years after opening, Southern Bloomerâs performance was excellent. It was servicing the needs of about 125 facilities, but unfortunately, this was creating a vast amount of scrap fabric. An attempt to use the scrap as stuffing for pillows had failed, so the scrap was being sent to landfills. This was not only wasteful but also costly.\n\nOne day, cofounder Don Sonner visited a gun shop with his son. Sonner had no interest in guns, but he quickly spotted a potential use for his scrap fabric during this visit. The patches that the gun shop sold to clean the inside of gun barrels were of poor quality. According to Sonner, when he âsaw one of those flimsy woven patches they sold that unraveled when you touched them, I said, âMan, thatâs what I can doââ with the scrap fabric. Unlike other gun-cleaning patches, the patches that Southern Bloomer sold did not give off threads or lint, two by-products that hurt gunsâ accuracy and reliability. The patches quickly became popular with the military, police departments, and individual gun enthusiasts. Before long, Southern Bloomer was selling thousands of pounds of patches per month. A casual trip to a gun store unexpectedly gave rise to a lucrative emergent strategy (Wells, 2002).\n\nRealized Strategy\n\nA realized strategyÂ is the strategy that an organization actually follows. Realized strategies are a product of a firmâs intended strategy (i.e., what the firm planned to do), the firmâs deliberate strategyÂ (i.e., the parts of the intended strategy that the firm continues to pursue over time), and its emergent strategy (i.e., what the firm did in reaction to unexpected opportunities and challenges). In the case of FedEx, the intended strategy devised by its founder many years agoâfast package delivery via a centralized hubâremains a primary driver of the firmâs realized strategy. For Southern Bloomers Manufacturing Company, realized strategy has been shaped greatly by both its intended and emergent strategies, which centre on underwear and gun-cleaning patches.\n\nIn other cases, firmsâ original intended strategies are long forgotten. A nonrealized strategyÂ refers to the abandoned parts of the intended strategy. When aspiring author David McConnell was struggling to sell his books, he decided to offer complimentary perfume as a sales gimmick. McConnellâs books never did escape the stench of failure, but his perfumes soon took on the sweet smell of success. The California Perfume Company was formed to market the perfumes; this firm evolved into the personal care products juggernaut known today as Avon. For McConnell, his dream to be a successful writer was a nonrealized strategy, but through Avon, a successful realized strategy was driven almost entirely by opportunistically capitalizing on change through emergent strategy.\n\nDemographics\n\nOne often overlooked source of strategic information is demographics, which includes data on population, age, and sex. WhenÂ we stop and think for a minute, we realize that age has a direct and obvious link to consumptionâ65-year-old men buy few disposable diapers, and teenage women buy few new cars! Similarly, if you examine the students in your class, the majority are probably between the ages of 18 and 24, the traditional age range when people acquire their post-secondary education. While today, the percentage of older students is low, demographic analysis tells us that this number will grow, if only because there will be fewer traditional-aged students in years to come. How do we know? Because we know the number of people aged 13 to 17 currently in your local high school.\n\nDemographics analysis has a high degree of predictability.Â Someone who is 23 years old this year will predictably be 24 next year, and 25 the year after. Age data is often combined with a wide variety of economic and lifestyle information as well, dramatically increasing its strategic value to companies.\n\nCanadaâs baby boomersÂ (born between 1946 and 1965) have had an incredible impact on everything from education and housing to health as they aged. This cohort,Â the earliest of which are now well into theirÂ 60s, are and will be purchasing products and services appropriate for newly retired seniors at record levels. However, those baby boomers are not having babies now (too old). In fact, Canadaâs low birth rate of 1.61 children per womanÂ in 2011 (Statistics Canada, 2013) will have a profound long-term effects on society; it takes 2.1 children per womanÂ to sustain a nationâs population over time. Economists are asking, “What will happen when the population, especially the working-age population starts to fall?” (Statistics Canada, 2013).\n\nThis trend is observable in most countries around the world. With the United StatesÂ reporting birth rates of 1.89 and China 1.58, immigration is unlikely to make up for these missing children. Interestingly, in Canada, Aboriginal peopleÂ are an exception with a much higher birthrate. In fact, if this trend continues, Saskatchewan would becomeÂ the first Canadian province with a majority Aboriginal population.\n\nUnderstanding various demographic aspects of current consumers (from sales data) and analyzing how this might change over the medium-to-long term can be of real strategic importance to firms.Â Demographic data is readily available, usually free from government (Statistics Canada, U.S. Census Bureau, etc.), and customized data sets can be purchased to delve deeper into details of your relevant consumer population and population trends.\n\nStrategy at the Movies: The Social Network\n\nDid Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg set out to build a billion-dollar company with more than 600 million active users? Not hardly. As shown in 2010âs The Social Network, Zuckerbergâs original concept in 2003 had a dark nature. After being dumped by his girlfriend, a bitter Zuckerberg created a website called âFaceMashâ where the attractiveness of young women could be voted on. This evolved first into an online social network called Thefacebook that was for Harvard students only. When the network became surprisingly popular, it then morphed into Facebook, a website open to everyone. Facebook is so pervasive today that it has changed the way we speak, such as the word friend being used as a verb. Ironically, Facebookâs emphasis on connecting with existing and new friends is about as different as it could be from Zuckerbergâs original mean-spirited concept. Certainly, Zuckerbergâs emergent and realized strategies turned out to be far nobler than the intended strategy that began his adventure in entrepreneurship.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nMost organizations create intended strategies that they hope to follow to be successful. Over time, however, changes in an organizationâs situation give rise to new opportunities and challenges. Organizations respond to these changes using emergent strategies. Realized strategies are a product of both intended and realized strategies.\n\nExercises\n\nWhat is the difference between an intended and an emergent strategy?\n\nCan you think of a company that seems to have abandoned its intended strategy?

The deliberate strategy is what you put into action, and the realized strategy is often a combination of your deliberate strategy and any emergent strategies that develop.\n\n[Return to Figure 1.6]\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nConsider how strategy in ancient times and military strategy can provide insights to businesses.\n\nDescribe how strategic management has evolved into a field of study.\n\nThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\n\nâGeorge Santayana, The Life of Reason\n\nSantayanaâs quote has strong implications for strategic management. The history of strategic management can be traced back several thousand years. Great wisdom about strategy can be acquired by understanding the past, but ignoring the lessons of history can lead to costly strategic mistakes that could have been avoided. Certainly, the present offers very important lessons; businesses can gain knowledge about what strategies do and do not work by studying the current actions of other businesses. But this section discusses two less obvious sources of wisdom: (1) strategy in ancient times and (2) military strategy. This section also briefly traces the development of strategic management as a field of study.\n\nStrategy in Ancient Times\n\nOne of the earliest-known discussion of strategy is offered in the Old Testament of the Bible (Bracker, 1980). Approximately 3,500 years ago, Moses faced quite a challenge after leading his fellow Hebrews out of enslavement in Egypt. Moses was overwhelmed as the lone strategist at the helm of a nation that may have exceeded one million people. Based on advice from his father-in-law, Moses began delegating authority to other leaders, each of whom oversaw a group of people. This hierarchical delegation of authority created a command structure that freed Moses to concentrate on the biggest decisions and helped him implement his strategies (Figure 1.8 âStrategy in Ancient Timesâ). Similarly, the demands of strategic management today are simply too much for a chief executive officer (the top leader of a company) to handle alone. Many important tasks are thus entrusted to vice presidents and other executives.\n\nIn ancient China, strategist and philosopher Sun Tzu offered thoughts on strategy that continue to be studied carefully by business and military leaders today. Sun Tzuâs best-known work is The Art of War. As this title implies, Sun Tzu emphasized the creative and deceptive aspects of strategy.\n\nOne of Sun Tzuâs ideas that has numerous business applications is that winning a battle without fighting is the best way to win. Appleâs behaviour in the personal computer business offers a good example of this idea in action. Many computer makers such as Toshiba, Acer, and Lenovo compete with one another based primarily on price. This leads to price wars that undermine the computer makersâ profits. In contrast, Apple prefers to develop unique features for its computers, features that have created a fiercely loyal set of customers. Apple boldly charges far more for its computers than its rivals charge for theirs. Apple does not even worry much about whether its computersâ software is compatible with the software used by most other computers. Rather than fighting a battle with other firms, Apple wins within the computer business by creating its own unique market and by attracting a set of loyal customers. Sun Tzu would probably admire Appleâs approach.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of strategy in ancient times revolves around the Trojan horse. According to legend, Greek soldiers wanted to find a way to enter the gates of Troy and attack the city from the inside. They devised a ploy that involved creating a giant wooden horse, hiding soldiers inside the horse, and offering the horse to the Trojans as a gift. The Trojans were fooled and brought the horse inside their city. When night arrived, the hidden Greek soldiers opened the gates for their army, leading to a Greek victory. In modern times, the term Trojan horse refers to gestures that appear on the surface to be beneficial to the recipient but that mask a sinister intent. Computer viruses also are sometimes referred to as Trojan horses.\n\nA far more noble approach to strategy than the Greeksâ is attributed to King Arthur of Britain. Unlike the hierarchical approach to organizing Moses used, Arthur allegedly considered himself and each of his knights to have an equal say in plotting the groupâs strategy. Indeed, the group is thought to have held its meetings at a round table so that no voice, including Arthurâs, would be seen as more important than the others. The choice of furniture in modern executive suites is perhaps revealing. Most feature rectangular meeting tables, perhaps signaling that one personâthe chief executive officerâis in charge.\n\nAnother implication for strategic management offered by King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table involves the concept of mission. Their vigorous search to find the Holy Grail (the legendary cup used by Jesus and his disciples at the Last Supper) serves as an exemplar for the importance of a central mission to guide organizational strategy and actions.\n\nLessons Offered by Military Strategy\n\nKey military conflicts and events have shaped the understanding of strategic management (Figure 1.9 âClassic Military Strategyâ). Indeed, the word strategy has its roots in warfare. The Greek verb strategos means âarmy leaderâ and the idea of stratego (from which we get the word strategy) refers to defeating an enemy by effectively using resources (Bracker, 1980).\n\nA book written nearly 500 years ago is still regarded by many as an insightful guide for conquering and ruling territories. NiccolÃ² Machiavelliâs 1532 book The Prince offers clever recipes for success to government leaders. Some of the bookâs suggestions are quite devious, and the word Machiavellian is used today to refer to acts of deceit and manipulation.\n\nTwo wars fought on American soil provide important lessons about strategic management. In the late 1700s, the American Revolution pitted the American colonies against mighty Great Britain. The Americans relied on nontraditional tactics, such as guerilla warfare and the strategic targeting of British officers. Although these tactics were considered by Great Britain to be barbaric, they later became widely used approaches to warfare. The Americans owed their success in part to help from the French navy, illustrating the potential value of strategic alliances.\n\nNearly a century later, Americans turned on one another during the Civil War. After four years of hostilities, the Confederate states were forced to surrender. Historians consider the Confederacy to have had better generals, but the Union possessed greater resources, such as factories and railroad lines. As many modern companies have discovered, sometimes good strategies simply cannot overcome a stronger adversary.\n\nTwo wars fought on Russian soil also offer insights. In the 1800s, a powerful French invasion force was defeated in part by the brutal nature of Russian winters. In the 1940s, a similar fate befell German forces during World War II. Against the advice of some of his leading generals, Adolf Hitler ordered his army to conquer Russia. Like the French before them, the Germans were able to penetrate deep into Russian territory. As George Santayana had warned, however, the forgotten past was about to repeat itself. Horrific cold coupled with excessively long (and vunerable) supply lines eventually stopped the German advance. Russian forces eventually took control of the combat, and in 1945 Hitler committed suicide as both Russians and Allied forces approached the German capital, Berlin.\n\nFive years earlier, Germany ironically had benefited from an opponent ignoring the strategic management lessons of the past. In ancient times, the Romans had assumed that no army could cross a mountain range known as the Alps. An enemy general named Hannibal put his men on elephants, crossed the mountains, and caught Roman forces unprepared. French commanders made a similar bad assumption in 1940. When Germany invaded Belgium (and then France) in 1940, its strategy caught French forces by surprise.\n\nThe top French commanders assumed that German tanks simply could not make it through a thickly wooded region known as the Ardennes Forest. As a result, French forces did not bother preparing a strong defense in that area. Most of the French army and their British allies instead protected against a small, diversionary force that the Germans had sent as a deception to the north of the forest. German forces made it through the forest, encircled the allied forces, and started driving them toward the ocean. Many thousands of French and British soldiers were killed or captured. In retrospect, the French generals had ignored an important lesson of history: Do not make assumptions about what your adversary can and cannot do. Executives who make similar assumptions about their competitors put their organizationsâ performance in jeopardy.\n\nStrategic Management as a Field of Study\n\nUniversities contain many different fields of study, including physics, literature, chemistry, computer science, and engineering. Some fields of study date back many centuries (e.g., literature), while others (such as computer science) have emerged only in recent years. Strategic management has been important throughout history, but the evolution of strategic management into a field of study has mostly taken place over the past century. A few of the key business and academic events that have helped the field develop are discussed next (Figure 1.10 âThe Modern History of Strategic Managementâ).\n\nThe ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu made it clear that strategic management is part art. But it is also part science. Major steps toward developing the scientific aspect of strategic management were taken in the early twentieth century by Frederick W. Taylor. In 1911, Taylor published The Principles of Scientific Management. The book was a response to Taylorâs observation that most tasks within organizations were organized haphazardly. Taylor believed that businesses would be much more efficient if management principles were derived through scientific investigation. In The Principles of Scientific Management, Taylor stressed how organizations could become more efficient through identifying the âone best wayâ of performing important tasks. Implementing Taylorâs principles was thought to have saved railroad companies hundreds of millions of dollars. Although many later works disputed the merits of trying to find the âone best way,â Taylorâs emphasis on maximizing organizational performance became the core concern of strategic management as the field developed.\n\nAlso in the early 20th century, automobile maker Henry Ford emerged as one of the pioneers of strategic management among industrial leaders. At the time, cars seemed to be a luxury item for wealthy people. Ford adopted a unique strategic perspective, however, and boldly offered the vision that he would make cars the average family could afford. Building on ideas about efficiency from Taylor and others, Ford organized assembly lines for creating automobiles that lowered costs dramatically. Despite his wisdom, Ford also made mistakes. Regarding his companyâs flagship product, the Model T, Ford famously stated, âAny customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black.â When rival automakers provided customers with a variety of colour choices, Ford had no choice but to do the same.\n\nIn 1912, Harvard University became the first higher-education institution to offer a course focused on how business executives could lead their organizations to greater success. The approach to maximizing performance within this âbusiness policyâ course was consistent with Taylorâs ideas. Specifically, the goal of the business policy course was to identify the one best response to any given problem that an organization confronted. By finding and pursuing this ideal solution, the organization would have the best chance of enjoying success.\n\nIn the 1920s, A&W Root Beer became the first franchised restaurant chain. Franchising involves an organization (called a franchisor) granting the right to use its brand name, products, and processes to other organizations (known as franchisees) in exchange for an up-front payment (a franchise fee) and a percentage of franchiseesâ revenues (a royalty fee). This simple yet powerful business model allows franchisors to grow their brands rapidly and provides franchisees with the safety of a proven business format. Within a few decades, the franchising business model would fuel incredible successes for many franchisors and franchisees across a variety of industries. Today, for example, both Subway and McDonaldâs have more than 30,000 restaurants carrying their brand names.\n\nThe acceptance of strategic management as a necessary element of business school programs took a major step forward in 1959. A widely circulated report created by the Ford Foundation recommended that all business schools offer a âcapstoneâ course. The goal of this course would be to integrate knowledge across different business fields such as marketing, finance, and accounting to help students devise better ideas for addressing complex business problems. Rather than seeking a âone best wayâ solution, as advocated by Taylor and Harvardâs business policy course, this capstone course would emphasize studentsâ critical thinking skills in general and the notion that multiple ways of addressing a problem could be equally successful in particular. The Ford Foundation report was a key motivator that led U.S. universities to create strategic management courses in their undergraduate and master of business administration programs.\n\nIn 1962, business and academic events occurred that seemed minor at the time but that would later give rise to huge changes. Building on the business savvy that he had gained as a franchisee, Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas. Relying on a strategy that emphasized low prices and high levels of customer service, Walmart grew to 882 stores with a combined $8.4 billion dollars in annual sales by 1985. A decade later, sales reached $93.6 billion across nearly 3,000 stores. In 2010, Walmart was the largest company in the world. In recent years, Walmart has arguably downplayed customer service in favor of cutting costs. Time will tell whether deviating from Sam Waltonâs original strategic positioning will hurt the company.\n\nAlso in 1962, Harvard professor Alfred Chandler published Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise. This book describes how strategy and organizational structure need to be consistent with each other to ensure strong firm performance, a lesson that Moses seems to have mastered during the Hebrewsâ exodus from Egypt. Many people working in the field of strategic management consider Chandlerâs book to be the first work of strategic management research.\n\nTwo pivotal events that firmly established strategic management as a field of study took place in 1980. One was the creation of the Strategic Management Journal. The introduction of the journal offered a forum for researchers interested in building knowledge about strategic management. Much like important new medical findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine, the Strategic Management Journal publishes pathbreaking insights about strategic management.\n\nThe second pivotal event in 1980 was the publication of Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors by Harvard professor Michael Porter. This book offers concepts such as five forces analysis and generic strategies that continue to strongly influence how executives choose strategies more than thirty years after the bookâs publication. Given the importance of these concepts, both five forces analysis and generic strategies are discussed in detail in Chapter 3 âEvaluating the External Environmentâ and Chapter 5 âSelecting Business-Level Strategies,â respectively.\n\nMany consumers today take web-based shopping for granted, but this channel for commerce was created less than two decades ago. The 1995 launch of Amazon by founder Jeff Bezos was perhaps the pivotal event in creating Internet-based commerce. In pursuit of its vision âto be earthâs most customer-centric company,â Amazon has diversified far beyond its original focus on selling books and has evolved into a dominant retailer. Powerful giants have stumbled badly in Amazonâs wake. Sears had sold great varieties of goods (even including entire houses) through catalogs for many decades, as had Eatonâs. Neither firm created a strong online sales presence to keep pace with Amazon, and both eventually dropped their catalog businesses. As often happens with old and large firms, Sears and Eatonâs were outmaneuvered by a creative and versatile upstart. Eatonâs went bankrupt in 1999, and in 2014 Sears is under bankruptcy protection in the United States.\n\nEthics have long been an important issue within the strategic management field. Attention to the need for executives to act ethically when creating strategies increased dramatically in the early 2000s when a series of companies such as Bre-X and Enron Corporation were found to have grossly exaggerated the strength of their performance. After a series of revelations about fraud and corruption, investors in these firms and others lost billions of dollars, tens of thousands of jobs were lost, and some executives were sent to prison.\n\nLike ethics, the implications of international competition are of central interest to strategic management. Provocative new thoughts on the nature of the international arena were offered in 2005 by Thomas L. Friedman. In his book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century, Friedman argues that many of the advantages that firms in developed countries such as the United States, Japan, and Great Britain take for granted are disappearing. One implication is that these firms will need to improve their strategies if they are to remain successful.\n\nLooking to the future, it appears likely that strategic management will prove to be more important than ever. In response, researchers who are interested in strategic management will work to build additional knowledge about how organizations can maximize their performance. Executives will need to keep track of the latest scientific findings. Meanwhile, they also must leverage the insights that history offers on how to be successful while trying to avoid historyâs mistakes.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nAlthough strategic management as a field of study has developed mostly over the last century, the concept of strategy is much older. Understanding strategic management can benefit greatly by learning the lessons that ancient history and military strategy provide.\n\nExercises\n\nWhat do you think was the most important event related to strategy in ancient times?\n\nIn what ways are the strategic management of business and military strategy alike? In what ways are they different?\n\nDo you think executives are more ethical today as a result of the scandals in the early 2000s? Why or why not?\n\nReferences\n\nBracker, J. (1980).

Academy of Management Review, 5(2), 219â224.\n\nImage descriptions\n\nFigure 1.8 image description: Strategy in Ancient Times.\n\nStrategic management borrows many ideas from ancient uses of strategy over time. The following anecdotes provide a few notable examples of historical actions that remain relevant for the study of modern strategy. Indeed, the Greek verb strategos means âarmy leaderâ and the idea of stratego (from which we get the word âstrategyâ) refers to the idea of destroying oneâs enemies through the effective use of resources.\n\n1491 BC: Moses uses hierarchical delegation of authority during the exodus from Egypt. Dividing a large set of people into smaller groups creates a command structure that enables strategies to be implemented.\n\n500 BC: Sun Tzuâs The Art of War provides a classic handbook on military strategy with numerous business applications, such as the idea to âwin without fighting is best.â This type of approach was used by businesses, suh as Gap Inc. when they decided to create their own stores rather than competing for shelf space for their clothing within traditional department stores.\n\n70 BC: Roman poet Virgil tells the story of the Trojan horse, a classic strategic ploy where the Greek forces hid a select number of soldiers in a large wooden horse that the Trojan army took into their heavily guarded city gates. Once inside the city, Greek soldiers were able to open the gates and allow in reinforcements, which eventually led to the end of the war.\n\n530 CE: King Arthur rules Britain. Legend says he make his famed round table so that no one, including him, would be seen as above the others. His mission to find the Holy Grail serves as an ememplar for the importance of the central mission to guide organizational objectives.\n\n[Return to Figure 1.8]\n\nFigure 1.9 image description: Classic Military Strategy.\n\nStrategic management often borrows lessons as well as metaphors from classic military strategy. For example, major business decisions are often categorized as âstrategicâ while more minor decisions (such as small changes in price or the opening of a new location) are referred to as âtacticalâ decisions. Here are a fre select examples of classic military strategies that hold insights for strategic decisions today.â\n\n1532: Machiavelliâs book The Prince offers clever recipes for success to government leaders. Some of the bookâs suggestions are quite devious, and the word Machiavellian comes to refer to acts of deceit and manipulation.\n\n1775: The American Revolutionary War between the United State and Great Britain begins. Weaker American forces win the war in part by relying on nontraditional tactics such as guerilla warfare and the strategic targeting of British officers. They also depend on hep from the French navy, illustrating the potential value of strategic alliances.\n\n1815: Napoleonâs defeat at Waterloo demonstrates how spreading resources too thin can result in defeat of even one of the most famed militaries of all time.\n\n1865: The American Civil War ends. Historians consider the Confederacy to have had better generals, but the Union possessed greater resources. Sometimes good strategies simply cannot overcome a stronger adversary.\n\n1944: Following a series of deceptions designed to confuse and fool German forces, the Allies launch the D-Day invasion in an effort to liberate Europe from Nazi control.\n\n[Return to Figure 1.9]\n\nFigure 1.10 image description: The Modern History of Strategic Management.\n\nAlthough strategy has been important throughout history, strategic management as a field of study has largely developed over the past century. Below are a few key business and academic events that have help the field evolve.\n\n1909: Ford first produces its classic Model T.\n\n1911: Frederick W. Taylor publishes The Principles of Scientific Management.\n\n1912: The precursor to the modern strategic management course was created as Harvard Business School under the title âBusiness Policyâ\n\n1925: A&W Root Beer becomes USAâs first franchised restaurant chain.\n\n1959: The Ford Foundation recommends that business school curricula include a âcapstoneâ course that integrates knowledges across business fields in order to help solve complex business problems.\n\n1962: Alfred Chandler publishes Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise.\n\n1962: Sam Walton opens the first Walmart in Arkansas. Relying on a strategy that emphasized low price and high levels of customer service.\n\n1980: The Strategic Management Journal is created.\n\n1995: The launch of Amazon.com by founder Jeff Bezos is perhaps the pivotal event in creating Internet-based commerce.\n\n1997: Bre-X declares bankruptcy after an investigation revealed that ore samples were salted and the inflated share prices were a result of fraud and corruption.\n\n2005: Thomas Friedmanâs book The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century suggests that many advantages that firms in developed countries like the United States take for granted are disappearing.\n\n2010: Walmart becomes the largest company in the world.\n\n[Return to Figure 1.10]\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nDefine vision and mission and distinguish between them.\n\nKnow what the acronym SMART represents.\n\nBe able to write a SMART goal.\n\nThe Importance of Vision\n\nGood business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to completion.\n\nâJack Welch, former CEO of General Electric\n\nMany skills and abilities separate effective strategic leaders like Howard Schultz from poor strategic leaders. One of them is the ability to inspire employees to work hard to improve their organizationâs performance. Effective strategic leaders are able to convince employees to embrace lofty ambitions and move the organization forward. In contrast, poor strategic leaders struggle to rally their people and channel their collective energy in a positive, focused direction.\n\nAs the quote from Jack Welch suggests, a visionÂ is one key tool available to executives to inspire the people in an organization (Figure 2.2 “The Big Picture: Organizational Vision”). An organizationâs vision describes what the organization hopes to become in the future. Well-constructed visions clearly articulate an organizationâs aspirations. Googleâs mission is to organize the worldâs information and make it universally accessible and useful (Edwards, 2012). Google expands on its mission by listing âTen things we know,â including “Focus on the user and all else will follow,” “Itâs best to do one thing really, really well,” andÂ Â “Fast is better than slow” (Google Inc., 2014).\n\nThis brief but powerful statement emphasizes several aims that are important to Google, including excellence in customer service, and setting high standards for employees and Googleâs products. McDonaldâs brand mission is “to be our customersâ favourite place and way to eat. Our worldwide operations are aligned around a global strategy called the Plan to Win, which centre on an exceptional customer experience â People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. We are committed to continuously improving our operations and enhancing our customersâ experience.”Â To be effective, this mission statement must filter down to all employees and inspire them to adopt that mission. (Edwards, 2012).\n\nOne limitation of such all-encompassing goals is that front line and operational employees will not relate or connect with the goals, and will disengage from the process â flavour of the monthâ¦. The CEO/management team who can effectively translate the high-level objectives to on-the-ground activities will have good success in engaging staff!Â Of course, a strong element of walk-the-talk is required by management as well.\n\nThe results of a survey of 1,500 executives illustrate how the need to create an inspiring vision creates a tremendous challenge for executives. When asked to identify the most important characteristics of effective strategic leaders, 98 percent of the executives listed âa strong sense of visionâ first. Meanwhile, 90 percent of the executives expressed serious doubts about their own ability to create a vision.Â Not surprisingly, many organizations do not have formal visions. Many organizations that do have visions find that employees do not embrace and pursue the visions. Having a well-formulated vision that employees embrace can therefore give an organization an edge over its rivals.\n\nMission Statements\n\nAt WestJet, Clive Beddoe and his team developed its mission statement: âTo enrich the lives of everyone in WestJet’s world by providing safe, friendly and affordable air travel.â A mission such as WestJetâs states the reasons for an organizationâs existence. Well-written mission statements effectively capture an organizationâs identity and provide answers to the fundamental question âWho are we?â While a vision looks to the future, a mission captures the key elements of the organizationâs past and present.\n\nOrganizations need support from their key stakeholders, such as employees, owners, suppliers, and customers, if they are to prosper. A mission statement which engagesÂ stakeholders will help develop an understanding of why they should support the organization and Â make clear what important role or purpose the organization plays in society â also called a “social license to operate.” Googleâs mission, for example, is âto organize the worldâs information and make it universally accessible and useful.â Google pursued this mission in its early days by developing a very popular Internet search engine. The firm continues to serve its mission through various strategic actions, including offering its Internet browser Google Chrome to the online community, providing free email via its Gmail service, and making books available online for browsing.\n\nIn ancient times, Aesop said, “United we stand, divided we fall.” This provides a helpful way of thinking about the relationship between vision and mission. Executives ask for trouble if their organizationâs vision and mission are divided by emphasizing different domains. Some universities have fallen into this trap. Many large public universities were established in the late 1800s with missions that centered on educating citizens. As the 20th century unfolded, however, creating scientific knowledge through research became increasingly important to these universities. Many university presidents responded by creating visions centered on building the scientific prestige of their schools. This created a dilemma for professors: Should they devote most of their time and energy to teaching students (as the mission required) or on their research studies (as ambitious presidents demanded via their visions)? Some universities continue to struggle with this trade-off today and remain houses divided against themselves. In sum, an organization is more effective to the extent that its vision and its mission target employeesâ effort in the same direction.\n\nPursuing the Vision and Mission through SMART Goals\n\nAn organizationâs vision and mission combined offer a broad, overall sense of the organizationâs direction. To work toward achieving these overall aspirations, organizations also need to create goalsânarrower aims that should provide clear and tangible guidance to employees as they perform their work on a daily basis. The most effective goals are those that are\n\nSpecific,\n\nMeasurable,\n\nAchievable,\n\nRealistic, and\n\nTime-bound.\n\nAn easy way to remember these dimensions is to combine the first letter of each into one word: SMART (Figure 2.4 “Creating SMART Goals”). Employees are in a much better Â position to succeed to the extent that an organizationâs goals are SMART.A goal is specific if it is explicit rather than vague. WestJetâs vision is that âBy 2016, WestJet will be one of the five most successful international airlines in the world providing our guests with a friendly caring experience that will change air travel forever.â\n\nA goal is measurable to the extent that whether the goal is achieved can be quantified. WestJetâs goal of being one of the five most successful international airlines in the world by 2016 offers very simple and clear measurability: Either WestJet will be in the top fiveÂ Â by 2016 or they will not.\n\nA goal is aggressiveÂ if achieving it presents a significant (as opposed to easy) challenge to the organization. A series of research studies have demonstrated that performance is strongest when goals are challenging but attainable. Such goals force people to test and extend the limits of their abilities. This can result in reaching surprising heights.\n\nWestJet committed to growing responsibly and ensuring that it is an environmentally sustainable airline, and supports the IATA goal of carbon neutral growth in its industry beyond 2020. WestJet already operates one of the most modern and fuel-efficient fleets in North America.\n\nAchieving carbon neutral growth will be a challenge for WestJet requiring the combined efforts of the airline and its supplier partners such as aircraft manufacturers, airports and government.Â In 2012, WestJet reported that âOur significant investments in fleet and technology have greatly improved our aircraft fuel efficiency and ability to operate our business more cost effectively. Between 2000 and 2012, we improved our fuel efficiency by 44.8 per cent per revenue tonne kilometre. The resulting fuel savings are equivalent to the amount of fuel that would have been used to fly a Boeing Next-Generation 737 from Calgary to Toronto and back approximately 44,135 times (based on our 2012 fuel usage).â (Quigley, 1994)\n\nIt is useful to know that Â easily achievable goals are not only easy, but they tend to undermine overall motivation and effort by employees, Michelangelo said, âThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.â Consider a situation in which you have done so well in a course that you only need a score of 60 percent on the final exam to earn an A for the course. Understandably, few students would study hard enough to score 90 percent or 100 percent on the final exam under these circumstances Similarly, setting organizational goals that are easy to reach encourages employees to work just hard enough to reach the goals.\n\nIt is tempting to extend this logic and thinking to conclude that setting nearly impossible goals will encourage even stronger effort and performance from staff. However, people act rationally and tend to become Â discouraged and give up Â when faced with goals that realistically have little chance of being reached. If, for example, Starbucks had set a time frame of one year to regain a share price of $35, it would have attracted scorn. The company simply could not be turned around that quickly. Similarly, if WestJetâs fuel efficiency goal was 100 percent improvement, WestJetâs employees would probably not embrace it. Thus goals must also be realistic, meaning that their achievement is feasible.\n\nMost of us have Â found that deadlines are motivating and that they help you structure your work time. The same is true for organizations, leading to the conclusion that goals should be time-bound through the creation of deadlines. WestJet has set a goal to achieve a cumulative 45 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency for our 737 fleet by 2020, as compared to the 2000 base year. (WestJet, 2012)\n\nThe period after an important goal is reached is often overlooked but is critical. Will an organization rest on its laurels or will it take on new challenges?Â Starbucks provides an illustrative example. Â In 2011, after a revamp of the companyâs stores and services, the stock price was around $35.Â In early 2014, the price was in the $70 range.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nStrategic leaders need to ensure that their organizations have three types of aims. A vision states what the organization aspires to become in the future. A mission reflects the organizationâs past and present by stating why the organization exists and what role it plays in society. Goals are the more specific aims that organizations pursue to reach their visions and missions. The best goals are SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound.\n\nExercises\n\nTake a look at the website of your college or university. What is the organizationâs vision and mission? Were they easy or hard to find?\n\nAs a member of the student body, do you find the vision and mission of your college or university to be motivating and inspirational? Why or why not?\n\nWhat is an important goal that you have established for your career? Could this goal be improved by applying the SMART goal concept?\n\nReferences\n\nEdwards, A.Â (2012).

Visions highlight the values and aspirations that lay at the heart of the organization. Although vision statements have the potential to inspire employees, customers, and other stakeholders, vision statements are relatively rare and good visions are even rarer. Some of the visions being pursued by businesses today are offered below.\n\nAlcoa – to be the best company in the world â in the eyes of our customers, shareholders, communities and people.\n\nAvon – to be the company that best understands and satisfies the product service and self-fulfillment needs of women â globally.\n\nChevron – to be the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance.\n\nGoogle – to develop a perfect search engine.\n\nKraft Foods – helping people around the world eat and live better.\n\nProctor and Gamble – be, and be recognized as, the best consumer products and services company in the world.\n\n[Return to Figure 2.2 ]\n\nFigure 2.3 image description: Missions.\n\nWhile a vision describes what an organization desires to become in the future, an organization’s mission is grounded in the past and present. A mission outlines the reasons for the organization’s existence and explains what role it plays in society. A well-written mission statement captures the organization’s identity and helps to answer the fundamental question of “who are we?” As a practical matter, a mission statement explains to key stakeholders why they should support the organization. The following examples illustrate the connections between organizations and the needs of their key stakeholders.\n\nHarley Davidson: we fulfill dreams through the experience of motorcycling, by providing to motorcyclists and to the general public an expanding line of motorcycles and branded products and services in selected market segments.\n\nWestjet: to enrich the lives of everyone in Westjet’s world nu providing safe, friendly and affordable air travel.\n\nStarbucks: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighbourhood at a time. It has always been, and will always be, about equality.\n\nMountain Equipment Co-op: we help people enjoy the benefits of self-propelled wilderness-oriented recreation.\n\nFender Musical Instrument: to exceed the expectations of music enthusiasts worldwide.\n\n[Return to Figure 2.3]\n\nFigure 2.4 image description: Creating SMART Goals.\n\nWhile missions and visions provide an overall sense of the organization’s direction, goals are narrower aims that should provide clear and tangible guidance to employees. The most effective goals are those that are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound). SMART goals help provide clarity, transparency, and accountability. Westjet’s goal is “to enrich the lives of everyone in Westjet’s world by providing safe, friendly and affordable air travel. By 2016, we strive to be one of the top five airlines in the world as measured through key metrics such as on time performance, safety, profitability and guest satisfaction.\n\nWestjet’s goals fit the SMART acronym.\n\nSpecific: Westjet strives to be among the top five international airlines. In contrast, “the best” would be vague, making it difficult to decide if a goal is actually reached.\n\nMeasurable: Westjet identifies the key metrics: on-time performance, safety, profitability and guest satisfaction. Westjet is able to measure its progress relative to its targets.\n\nAchievable: Westjet lists achievements to date in working towards the goals. A series of research studies show that performance is strongest when goals are challenging but attainable.\n\nRealistic: Westjet states support for the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) goals of a cumulative global average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5 per cent per year through to 2020. Reaching a goal must be feasible for employees to embrace it.\n\nTime-bound: Westjet’s timeline is “By 2016.” Deadlines are motivating and they create accountability.\n\n[Return to Figure 2.4]\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the complexities associated with assessing organizational performance.\n\nLearn each of the dimensions of the balanced scorecard framework.\n\nLearn what is meant by a âtriple bottom line.â\n\nOrganizational Performance: A Complex Concept\n\nHave you ever been to an archery range and shot arrows at the target?Â If you have, you already understand the basics of organizational performance!Â You aim at the centre of the target â bulls-eye. But the most important part of each shot is the assessment of whether you are high, low, too far left or too far right â feedback on your performance.Â For businesses, organizational performance refers to how well an organization is doing in reaching Â its vision, mission, and goals. Assessing organizational performance is a vital aspect of strategic management. Executives must know how well their organizations are performing to figure out what strategic changes, if any, to make. Performance is a very complex concept, however, and a lot of attention needs to be paid to how it is assessed.\n\nTwo important considerations are:\n\n(1) performance measures and\n\n(2) performance referent.\n\n(Figure 2.5 “How Organizations and Individuals Can Use Financial Performance Measures and Referents”)\n\nPerformance measures are Â a metrics along which organizations can be gauged. Most executives, investor and stakeholders watch and examine measures such as profits, stock price, and sales in an attempt to better understand how well their organizations are competing in the market, as well as future predicted results. But these measures provide just a glimpse of organizational performance.\n\nPerformance referents are also needed to assess whether an organization is doing well. A performance referent is a benchmark or standard used to make sense of an organizationâs standing along a performance measure Suppose, for example, that a firm has a profit margin of 20 percent in 2011. This might sound great on the surface. But suppose that the firmâs profit margin the year before, in 2010, was 35 percent and that the average profit margin across all firms in the industry for 2011 was 40 percent. Viewed relative to these two referents, the firmâs 2011 performance is cause for concern.\n\nUsing a variety of performance measures and referents is valuable because different measures and referents provide different information about an organizationâs functioning. As well, many commonly used measures, including accounting ratios, are highly past-focused.Â These indicators show stakeholders the end-results of past decisions, but do little to predict future firm performance.Â Strongly managed organizations must develop a deep understanding of what events or actions support strong(er) performance (i.e., increased product training for sales force leads to increased sales the following quarter), and then ensure these measure these as well.\n\nThe parable of the blind men and the elephantâpopularized in Western cultures through a poem by John Godfrey Saxe in the 19th centuryâis useful for understanding the complexity associated with measuring organizational performance. As the story goes, six blind men set out to âseeâ what an elephant was like. The first man touched the elephantâs side and believed the beast to be like a great wall. The second felt the tusks and thought elephants must be like spears. Feeling the trunk, the third man thought it was a type of snake. Feeling a limb, the fourth man thought it was like a tree trunk. The fifth, examining an ear, thought it was like a fan. The sixth, touching the tail, thought it was like a rope. If the men failed to communicate their different impressions they would have all been partially right, but wrong about what ultimately mattered.\n\nFigure 2.5 Financial performance measures and referents for organizations and individuals\n\nHow Organizations and Individuals Can Use Financial Performance Measures and Referents Types of Measures Key Measure for Organizations Key Referent for Organizations Key Measure for Individuals Key Referent for Individuals Liquidity measure: Helpful for understanding if obligations can be paid when due. Current ratio (Current assetsÂ Ã· current liabilities) A ratio of less than 1.0 suggests the firm does not have enough cash to pay its bills. Cash in your checking account. Do you have enough cash to cover your monthly debts? Leverage measures: Helpful for understanding if debt level is too high. The termÂ leverageÂ refers to the extent to which borrowed money is used. Debt-to-equity ratio Competitors’ debt-to-equity ratios. The use of debt varies across industries. Auto companies, for example, tend to have high debt-to-equity because they must build massive factories. Debt-to-income ratio (Monthly debt payments Ã· monthly income) If you have a debt-to-income ratio higher than 40%, you may be on the verge of becoming a credit risk. Profitability measures: Helpful for understanding how much profit, if any, is really being made. Net income (income after taxes) Last year’s net income. An increase shows the firm’s profits are moving in the right direction. Net income (income after taxes) Are you making enough money to cover your yearly expenses and save for retirement?\n\nThis story parallels the challenge involved in understanding the multidimensional nature of organization performance because different measures and referents may tell a different part of the overall story about the organizationâs performance. For example, the Fortune 500 list namesÂ the largest U.S. firms in terms of sales. These firms are generally not the strongest performers in terms of growth in stock price, however, in part because they are so big that making major improvements is difficult. During the late 1990s, a number of Internet-centred businesses enjoyed exceptional growth in sales and stock price but reported losses rather than profits. Many investors in these firms who simply fixated on a single performance measureâsales growthâabsorbed heavy losses when the stock marketâs attention turned to profits and the stock prices of these firms plummeted.\n\nThe number of performance measures and referents that are relevant for understanding an organizationâs performance can be overwhelming, however. For example, a study of what performance metrics were used within restaurant organizationsâ annual reports found that 788 different combinations of measures and referents were used within this one industry in a single year.Â Thus executives need to choose a rich yet limited set of performance measures and referents to focus on.\n\nThe Balanced Scorecard\n\nTo develop a more predictive set of Â organization performance measures, Professor Robert Kaplan and Professor David Norton of Harvard University developed a tool called the “balanced scorecard.” Using the scorecard helps managers resist the temptation to fixate on financial measures and instead monitor a diverse set of important measures (Figure 2.7 “Beyond Profits: Measuring Performance Using the Balanced Scorecard”). Indeed, the idea behind the framework is to provide a âbalanceâ between financial measures and other measures that are important for understanding organizational activities that lead to sustained, long-term performance. The balanced scorecard recommends that managers gain an overview of the organizationâs performance by tracking a small number of key measures that collectively reflect four dimensions:\n\nfinancial focus,\n\ncustomer focus,\n\ninternal business process focus, and\n\nlearning and growth focus.\n\nFinancial Measures\n\nFinancial measures of performance relate to organizational effectiveness and profits. Examples include financial ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, and return on investment. Other common financial measures include profits and stock price. Such measures help answer the key question âHow do we look to shareholders?â Such measures have long been of interest to senior management and investors.\n\nFinancial performance measures are commonly articulated and emphasized within an organizationâs annual report to shareholders. To provide context, such measures should be objective and be coupled with meaningful referents, such as the firmâs past performance. For example, Starbucksâs 2009 annual report highlights the firmâs performance in terms of net revenue, operating income, and cash flow over a five-year period.\n\nCustomer Measures\n\nCustomer measures of performance relate to customer attraction, satisfaction, and retention. These measures provide insight to the key question âHow do customers see us?â Examples might include the number of new customers and the percentage of repeat customers.\n\nStarbucks realizes the importance of repeat customers and has taken a number of steps to satisfy and to attract regular visitors to their stores. For example, Starbucks rewards regular customers with free drinks and offers all customers free Wi-Fi access.Â Starbucks also encourages repeat visits by providing cards with codes for free iTunes downloads. The featured songs change regularly, encouraging frequent repeat visits.\n\nInternal Business Process Measures\n\nInternal business process measures of performance relate to organizational efficiency. These measures help answer the key question âWhat must we excel at?â Examples include the time it takes to manufacture the organizationâs good or deliver a service. The time it takes to create a new product and bring it to market is another example of this type of measure.\n\nOrganizations such as Starbucks realize the importance of such efficiency measures for the long-term success of its organization, and Starbucks carefully examines its processes with the goal of decreasing order fulfillment time. In one recent example, Starbucks efficiency experts challenged their employees to assemble a Mr. Potato Head to understand how work could be done more quickly.Â The aim of this exercise was to help Starbucks employees in general match the speed of the firmâs high performers, who boast an average time per order of twenty-five seconds.\n\nOne key aspect for organizations producing physical goods (as compared to services) are supply-chain management indicators.Â Both Walmart and GM are examples of the increased profits that can result from effective management of the supply chain through initiatives such as “just-in-time”â supply-chain management.Â Of course, to reduce supply inventory, data must be both timely and accurate (or else you run out of key parts and the production line stopsâ¦).Â In the 1990s (pre-Internet) Walmart acquired their own satellite system that allowed them to collect sales by item and ordered replacement to restock their shelves every eight hours, while GM kept only enough tires forÂ four hours of car assembly at any one time!\n\nLearning and Growth Measures\n\nLearning and growth measures of performance relate to the future. Such measures provide insight to tell the organization, âCan we continue to improve and create value?â Learning and growth measures focus on innovation and proceed with an understanding that strategies change over time. Consequently, developing new ways to add value will be needed as the organization continues to adapt to an evolving environment. An example of a learning and growth measure is the number of new skills learned by employees every year.\n\nOne way Starbucks encourages its employees to learn skills that may benefit both the firm and individuals in the future is through its tuition reimbursement program. Employees who have worked with Starbucks for more than a year are eligible. Starbucks hopes that the knowledge acquired while earning a college degree might provide employees with the skills needed to develop innovations that will benefit the company in the future. Another benefit of this program is that it helps Starbucks reward and retain high-achieving employees.\n\nMeasuring Performance Using the Triple Bottom Line\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson once noted, âDoing well is the result of doing good. Thatâs what capitalism is all about.âÂ While the balanced scorecard provides a popular framework to help executives understand an organizationâs performance, other frameworks highlight areas such as social responsibility. One such framework, the triple bottom line,Â emphasizes the three Ps of people (making sure that the actions of the organization are socially responsible), the planet (making sure organizations act in a way that promotes environmental sustainability), and traditional organization profits. This notion was introduced in the early 1980s but did not attract much attention until the late 1990s.\n\nIn the case of Starbucks, the firm has made clear the importance it attaches to the planet by creating an environmental mission statement (âStarbucks is committed to a role of environmental leadership in all facets of our businessâ) in addition to its overall mission.Â In terms of the âpeopleâ dimension of the triple bottom line, Starbucks strives to purchase coffee beans harvested by farmers who work under humane conditions and are paid reasonable wages. The firm works to be profitable as well, of course.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nOrganizational performance is a multidimensional concept, and wise managers rely on multiple measures of performance when gauging the success or failure of their organizations. The balanced scorecard provides a tool to help executives gain a general understanding of their organizationâs current level of achievement across a set of four important dimensions. The triple bottom line provides another tool to help executives focus on performance targets beyond profits alone; this approach stresses the importance of social and environmental outcomes.\n\nExercises\n\nHow might you apply the balanced scorecard framework to measure performance of your college or university?\n\nIdentify a measurable example of each of the balanced scorecard dimensions other than the examples offered in this section.\n\nIdentify a mission statement from an organization that emphasizes each of the elements of the triple bottom line.\n\nReferences\n\nJargon, J.

Pilots must be on track in terms of altitude, air speed, and oil pressure and make sure they have enough gas to finish their flight plan. For tracking organizational performance, assessing how the organization is doing financially is just a starting point. The “balanced scorecard” encourages managers to also monitor how well the organization is serving customers, managing internal activities, and setting the stage for future improvements. This provides a fast but comprehensive view of the organization. As shown below, monitoring these four dimensions also can help individuals assess themselves.\n\nFinancial measures: such as return on assets and stock price – relate to effectiveness and profits. You could ask yourself: How can I improve my personal wealth? Measures might include cash, savings account, and retirement.\n\nCustomer measures: such as number or new repeat customers and percentage of repeat customers – relate to customer attraction and satisfaction. You could ask yourself: how strong is my social network? The number of new contacts you make overtime might reflect this dimension.\n\nInternal business process measures – such as speed at serving a customer and time it takes to create a new product and get it to the market – relate to organizational efficiency. You could ask yourself: am I getting better at my current job? Tracking improvements in personal efficiency such as the time needed to complete a task can helpful.\n\nLearning and growth measures – such as the average number of new skills learned by each employee every year – relate to the future and emphasize that employee learning is often more important than formal training. You could ask yourself: what skills should I develop now for the future? Although the acquisition of new skills is hard to measure, the attainment of specialized licenses or earning of a graduate degree are tangible benchmarks.\n\n[Return to Figure 2.7]\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the benefits and costs of CEO celebrity status.\n\nList and define the four types of CEOs based on differences in fame and reputation.\n\nBe able to offer an example of each of the four types of CEOs\n\nBenefits and Costs of CEO Celebrity\n\n“Fame is other people’s perception of who you are,” said Oprah Winfrey. “In order to remain true to who you are, you have to be aware of it, but you can’t buy into it.”\n\nThe word celebrity quickly brings to mind actors, sports stars, and musicians. Some CEOs, such as Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Martha Stewart, and Donald Trump, also achieve celebrity status. Celebrity CEOs are not a new phenomenon. In the early 20th century, industrial barons such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, and Cornelius Vanderbilt were household names. However, in the current era of mass and instant media, celebrity CEOs have become more prevalent and visible. Ryerson University and McGill University were named after benefactors (Egerton Ryerson and James McGill) who established those schools which now serve as their legacies.\n\nBoth benefits and costs are associated with CEO celebrity. CEO celebrity can serve as an intangible asset for the CEOâs firm and may increase opportunities available to the firm. Hiring or developing a celebrity CEO may increase stock price, enhance a firmâs image, and improve the morale of employees and other stakeholders. However, employing a celebrity CEO also entails risks for an organization. Increased attention to the firm via the celebrity CEO means any gaps between actual and expected firm performance are magnified. Further, if a celebrity CEO acts in an unethical, inappropriate or illegal manner, chances are that the CEOâs firm will receive much more media attention than will other firms with similar problems.\n\nThere are also personal benefits and risks associated with celebrity for the CEO. Celebrity CEOs tend to receive higher compensation and job perks than their colleagues. Celebrity CEOs are likely to enjoy increased prestige power, which facilitates invitations to serve on the boards of directors of other firms and creates opportunities to network with other âmanagerial elites.â Celebrity also can provide CEOs with a âbenefit of the doubtâ effect that protects against quick sanctions for downturns in firm performance and stock price. However, celebrity also creates potential costs for individuals. Celebrity CEOs face larger and more lasting reputation erosion if their job performance and behaviour is inconsistent with their celebrity image. Celebrity CEOs face increased personal media scrutiny, and their friends and family must often endure increased attention into their personal and public lives. Accordingly, wise CEOs will attempt to understand and manage their celebrity status.\n\nTypes of CEOs\n\nIconsÂ are CEOs possessing both fame and strong reputations. The icon CEO combines style and substance in the execution of their job responsibilities. Mary Kay Ash, Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett are good examples of icons. The late Mary Kay Ash founded Mary Kay Cosmetics Corporation. The firmâs great success and Ashâs unconventional motivational methods, such as rewarding sales representatives with pink Cadillacs, made her famous. Partly because she emphasized helping other women succeed and ethical business practices, Mary Kay Ash also had a very positive reputation.\n\nSimilarly, Richard Branson has created an empire with more than 400 companies, including Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Records. Bransonâs celebrity status led him to star in his own reality-based show. He has also appeared on television series such as Baywatch and Friends, in addition to several cameo appearances in major motion pictures. Bill Gates, founder and former CEO of Microsoft, also has fame and a largely positive reputation. Gates is a proverbial âhousehold nameâ in the tradition of Ford, Rockefeller, and Vanderbilt. He also is routinely listed among Time magazineâs â100 Most Influential Peopleâ and has received ârock starâ receptions in India and Vietnam in recent years.\n\nWarren Buffett is perhaps the best-known executive in the United States. As CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has accumulated wealth estimated at $62 billion and was the richest person in the world as of March 2008. Buffettâs business insights command a level of respect that is perhaps unrivaled. Many in the investment and policymaking communities pay careful attention to his investment choices and his commentary on economic conditions. Despite Buffettâs immense wealth and success, his reputation centers on humility and generosity. Buffett avoids the glitz of Wall Street and has lived for fifty years in a house he bought in Omaha, Nebraska, for $31,000. Meanwhile, his 2006 donation of approximately $30 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was the largest charitable gift in history.\n\nGalen Weston is perhaps the best-known executive in Canada.Â As Executive Chairman of George Weston Limited, a leading food processing and distribution company. W. Galen Weston and family, with an estimated net worth of US$8.9 billion, are listed as the second wealthiest in Canada and 147th in the world by Forbes ma"
