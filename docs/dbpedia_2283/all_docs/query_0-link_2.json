        "text": "MR-guided focused ultrasound with continuous sonication along a spiral trajectory of the focal point has the advantage to deliver a uniform thermal dose within the treated volume. The question of the thermal safety in neighbouring tissue behind and in front of the focal point is addressed here. In-vivo experiments were performed on twelve rabbits. Elliptical regions of different size and aspect ratio were treated under automatic temperature control based on real-time PRF MR-thermometry . Post-treatment MR-follow-up data (Gd enhanced images) confirmed the theoretical prediction. The lesion size and shape were predictable and reproducible.\n\nPURPOSE To assess the diagnostic usefulness of textural features derived from standard Gd-enhanced MRI in paediatric posterior fossa tumours to differentiate classical medulloblastma (MB), anaplastic MB, ependymoma (EP) and anaplastic EP. METHODS T1-weighted Gd-enhanced preoperative MRI data from 26 children with infratentorial brain cancer (12 males, 14 females, 17 MB, 9 EP) were included into this retrospective study after parental consent. There were 4 anaplastic tumours in each group. Enhancing tumour and normal white matter were manually outlined. Shape, histogram and texture (Grey-level Co-occurrence Matrices; GLCM) features were computed and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier for each tumour type and subtype. RESULTS The best MB classifier trained by a 10-sample training set using a combination of shape, histogram and GLCM textural features yielded 91 % accuracy in discrimination from EP. Using a 6-sample training set, a classic MB classifier was found to..."
