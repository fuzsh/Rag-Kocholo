        "text": "First Native American Woman Saint\n\nTo watch the YouTube video, click on the arrow in the thumbnail below:\n\nAround 1656 in the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, located in what is now northeastern New York State, a baby girl was born. Little did anyone know that this child would grow up to become a significant figure in both Native American and Catholic history. Her parents named her “Little Sunshine,” because she was born at sunrise and had a cheerful disposition. Her father, Kenneronkwa, was a Mohawk chief of the Turtle Clan, one of the three separate extended family networks of the Mohawk nation, the other two being the Wolf clan and the Bear clan. Her mother was an Algonquin woman named Kahenta, who had been captured by Mohawk warriors and brought to their homeland. She was eventually adopted and assimilated into the tribe, but with one important difference: before her capture, Kahenta had been baptized as a Catholic and educated by French missionaries. Kenneronkwa wished to maintain peace between the Mohawk nation and the French, and was tolerant of the spread of the Catholic faith. Kahenta likely introduced Little Sunshine to Jesus, Mary, and the Christian faith as she grew up in a fully Mohawk culture, although Kenneronkwa did not consent to the baptism of his children.\n\nTheir village was a melting pot of cultures and traditions. Because the Mohawk had lost so many of their people to warfare and disease, they actively absorbed captured natives from other tribes, particularly their rivals, the Huron. This diversity would have exposed the children of the village to a rich tapestry of Native American cultures from an early age.\n\nFour years later, a devastating smallpox epidemic swept through the village, claiming the lives of Kenneronkwa, Kahenta, and their baby boy. Little Sunshine survived, but the disease left its mark – her face was scarred, her eyesight impaired. She was adopted by her father’s sister, and her aunt’s husband, who had succeeded Kenneronkwa as the new chief of the Turtle Clan. In their Haudenosaunee culture, this adoption meant that they treated her exactly as if she were their own biological child. Haudenosaunee parents typically gave their children names later in life, after observing unique traits about them. The little girl’s adoptive parents renamed her ‘Tekakwitha,’ which in English means ‘she walks groping for her way’ or ‘she puts things in their place.’ This name reflected both her physical reality—having to feel her way around due to her impaired vision—and her personality traits. Little Tekakwitha, now an orphan, indeed had to navigate her way through her new life while dealing with the physical and emotional scars of her ordeal.\n\nTekakwitha’s childhood and teenage years were set against a backdrop of considerable upheaval. The Mohawk were caught between French and Dutch colonists competing for control of the lucrative fur trade. In 1666, when Tekakwitha was about 10 years old, a significant French military campaign targeted the Mohawk territory. The Mohawk, facing overwhelming odds, strategically withdrew from their settlements rather than engage in direct conflict. The French resorted to destructive measures by burning Mohawk towns and destroying food supplies, thus creating a severe threat of famine. But the Mohawk people, including young Tekakwitha, managed to survive, aided by the support of the other Haudenosaunee nations and their traditional practice of maintaining substantial food reserves. In the aftermath, the Mohawk rebuilt their communities, with each clan establishing new primary settlements.\n\nIn 1667, when Tekakwitha was 11, three Jesuit missionaries arrived in her village. She was fascinated by these strange men in black robes, speaking of a God she had never known. Her uncle did not want Tekakwitha to convert. He was wary of Christians and often opposed them, which created tension when she began showing interest in Christianity. But this encounter with the Jesuits eventually would prove to be a great turning point in Tekakwitha’s life.\n\nDespite her interest in Christianity, Tekakwitha continued to grow up immersed in Mohawk culture. Over the years, her eyesight had improved somewhat, and she became skilled in the traditional women’s arts of learning to make clothing, weave mats, process animal pelts, tend crops, and prepare food. But there was something different about Tekakwitha – she was described as a modest girl who often avoided social gatherings.\n\nDespite the turmoil around her, Tekakwitha’s strength of character shone brightly. In the summer of 1669, when she was around 13, she shocked everyone by refusing to consider marriage. In a bold statement to her confessor, she declared, “I can have no spouse but Jesus,” and even went as far as to say, “I have the strongest aversion to marriage.”\n\nThat same year, Mohican warriors attacked her village. Instead of hiding, Tekakwitha joined other girls in helping a priest named Jean Pierron tend to the wounded, bury the dead, and carry food and water to those in need, demonstrating her compassionate and caring nature.\n\nAs Tekakwitha grew older, the pressure to conform to traditional expectations intensified. When she was about 17, her adoptive mother and another aunt tried to arrange her marriage to a young Mohawk man. But Tekakwitha stood her ground. In a dramatic turn of events, she fled from her cabin and hid in a nearby field to avoid the marriage. Her determination was so strong that eventually, her aunts gave up their efforts to marry her off.\n\nIn the 1600’s, the Haudenosaunee men and women donned cloth garments, adapting their attire to various occasions, much like we do in our modern world. The women’s fashion, in particular, was a vibrant tapestry of colors, adorned with intricate beadwork that told stories of their rich culture. Unmarried Mohawk women of that era had a unique custom of leaving their hair loose and unbraided, a symbol of their status and freedom. Tekakwitha, however, stood out from the crowd with her distinctive choice of attire. While her peers favored the popular red shawl draped over their shoulders, Tekakwitha opted for a Marian blue shawl that she wore over her head. This wasn’t merely a fashion statement; it served a practical purpose, shielding her sensitive eyes and partially concealing her scarred face. Although self-conscious about her smallpox scars, she embraced them with true humility, viewing them as a blessing that allowed her to focus more on her spiritual life rather than receiving attention for her appearance.\n\nIn the spring of 1674, when Tekakwitha was 18, she met Jesuit priest Jacques de Lamberville, who was visiting her village. In a brave move, Tekakwitha openly shared her story with him and expressed her desire to become a Christian. This marked the beginning of her formal Christian education as she started studying the catechism with Lamberville.\n\nTekakwitha’s journey to Catholicism was significantly influenced by Mohawk converts who had embraced the faith. These role models lived out their faith in a way that made a deep impression on her. Their commitment to Jesus Christ and their ability to integrate their Catholic faith with their Mohawk culture showed Kateri that she could do the same. However, her decision to convert was not an easy path, as it sometimes led to tensions within her family and community, particularly given the complex political landscape of the time. Even before her religious conversion, her refusal to marry and start a family – values deeply ingrained in Mohawk culture – strained her relationship with her adopted parents. Her embrace of Catholicism in 1676 only increased the tensions.\n\nTekakwitha’s baptism on Easter Sunday of 1676 marked a significant milestone in her spiritual journey. The choice of her baptismal name, “Kateri,” which means “Catherine” in English, remains a topic of speculation. Some biographers suggest she named herself after St. Catherine of Siena, the contemplative mystic, while others propose St. Catherine of Alexandria, who was martyred for her faith. It’s possible that Kateri identified with both the mystic and the martyr, adding profound meaning to her chosen name and identity. Her baptism marked the beginning of her deep and personal relationship with God. Her faith was not just a set of beliefs but a way of life that influenced every aspect of her existence.\n\nHoly Mohawk Catholics played a significant role in Kateri’s conversion. Many lay Catholics bore witness to their faith, sharing their testimonies of life in Jesus Christ and inviting their fellow Mohawk to follow Him. While Jesuit priests were involved in her instruction, it was the evangelization by Mohawk Catholics, living out their faith within their culture, that deeply impressed her. By this time, some of the Mohawk Catholics advocated for re-establishing themselves at the St. Francis Xavier du Pres settlement at Caughnawaga — now known as Kahnawake. It was situated on their traditional northern frontiers in what is now southern Quebec. Known as “the praying village,” it was founded by a devout Oneida married couple, in conjunction with the Jesuits. Migrating to Caughnawaga would allow Mohawk Catholics to live their faith intentionally and position them to dominate a trading route with the French, while also guarding the southern approach to Montreal.\n\nKateri Tekakwitha found herself at the center of a cultural and spiritual storm. Her adopted father took a very harsh approach to maintaining unity and keeping people rooted in Mohawk territory. This stance, largely supported by the influential clan mothers, led to severe consequences for those who chose to leave. But rather than convincing them to stay, the chief’s stringent policies actually encouraged Mohawk Catholics more than ever to migrate to Caughnawaga. Kateri, as the daughter of a Turtle clan chief, was in a quandary further complicated by her adopted sister’s conversion and subsequent move to Caughnawaga with her husband.\n\nAs a devout Catholic, Kateri’s decision to observe Christian practices, such as refraining from work on Sundays and holy days, was perceived by many as shirking her duties to the Mohawk nation. Yet, despite facing opposition from her tribe and even her own family, Kateri remained steadfast and courageous in her faith. She endured escalating hostility, including being insulted and ostracized, harsh labor, having stones thrown at her, and being denied food, yet she persevered in her Christian beliefs. Even as she faced persecution from her own people, Kateri prayed for their conversion and forgiveness, showing a remarkable capacity for love and understanding. In a particularly cruel attempt to prevent her departure, one of her aunts falsely accused Kateri of incest with an uncle, figuring that this would make her unwelcome in the praying village.\n\nAided by the encouragement of a Jesuit priest, Kateri’s unwavering faith led her to Caughnawaga in 1677, a year after her conversion. In this welcoming community, she could fully embrace her identity as a Mohawk Catholic woman. Kateri showed exceptional devotion to her faith, particularly to the Blessed Sacrament, which she visited frequently throughout the day. She attended daily morning Mass and was often the first to arrive at the chapel, even in harsh winter conditions. At Mass, the priests would pray in Latin, while the congregation sang in their native language. The sermons were preached by Haudenosaunee catechists. Kateri participated in Vespers and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in the evening, and received the sacraments regularly. She spent many hours in prayer, both in the chapel and in nature. Along with the other residents, she prayed the Rosary as she worked in the fields. She also worked alongside the Jesuits in caring for the sick, wounded and elderly. Because of her personal sanctity and exemplary virtue, Kateri was soon invited to join the Holy Family Confraternity, a spiritual community at Caughnawaga dedicated to living out Gospel values. They would meet every Sunday afternoon and prayed a special form of the rosary. Her profound spirituality attracted a group of devout women, known as “Kateri’s band,” with whom she contemplated establishing a culturally-aligned religious order, but was discouraged from doing so by the Jesuits, probably because of her poor health. She formed close bonds with Marie-Thérèse Tegaiaguenta, an Oneida convert about her age, and Father Claude Chauchetière, who became her spiritual advisor. Throughout her time in Caughnawaga, St. Kateri’s guiding principle was reflected in her motto, “Who will teach me what is most agreeable to God, so that I may do it?\n\nStill experiencing pressure from her relatives to marry, on March 25, 1679, at the age of 23, she made her consecration of virginity, framing her commitment in matrimonial terms. Instead of getting married in the traditional sense, she decided to become a “bride of Christ.” In this way, St. Kateri demonstrated that she was not rejecting the traditional Mohawk values of marriage and family. Instead, she chose to live out these values spiritually through her union with Jesus. Making a private vow of perpetual virginity was unusual for a young woman in her culture. Her biographer, Fr. Claude Chauchetière, described her chastity as “the most beautiful flower in her crown”.\n\nHowever, even in this rose garden of spirituality that was Caughnawaga, she wasn’t immune to the thorns of human nature. A painful incident arose when a woman in the community, driven by jealousy and misunderstanding, falsely accused St. Kateri of seducing her husband during a hunting trip. This accusation was particularly hurtful, as it echoed similar false claims made against her in her homeland. Despite the pain this caused, Kateri’s response was one of grace and restraint. She denied the accusation, as did the woman’s husband, but chose not to retaliate. Instead, she made the personal decision to abstain from future hunting trips, wanting to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Eventually, the the woman realized her error of rash judgement and repented. But the shadow of this accusation lingered, prompting a Jesuit priest to seek confirmation of St. Kateri’s innocence on her deathbed. While this questioning was undoubtedly distressing for Kateri in her final moments, it served a greater purpose. The priest’s intention was to secure a deathbed testimony that would silence any future detractors and preserve Kateri’s legacy of purity and devotion. This poignant episode highlights Kateri’s unwavering faith and character in the face of adversity, further cementing her status as a model of Christian virtue.\n\nKateri Tekakwitha’s relationship with nature and creation was deeply intertwined with her faith and cultural heritage. She had a profound connection with the natural world, which was a significant part of her Mohawk heritage. The Haudenosaunee people, including the Mohawks, held a deep respect for nature, seeing it as a gift from the Creator. This respect was reflected in their daily lives, rituals, and spiritual practices. For Kateri, nature was not just a backdrop for her life but a living testament to God’s presence and creation. She often found solace and inspiration in the natural world, which she saw as a reflection of God’s beauty and handiwork. This connection with nature was evident in her prayer life and her contemplative practices.\n\nKateri would often retreat to the woods to pray, finding in the quiet and solitude of nature a perfect setting to commune with God. The forests, rivers, and fields around her were not just physical spaces but sacred places where she could feel closer to the Creator. Her deep love for the natural world was a way for her to express her gratitude and reverence for God’s creation. She saw the land as a sacred trust, something to be cared for and preserved for future generations. Her relationship with nature resonated with the Haudenosaunee belief in responsible stewardship of the earth, and also was in harmony with her Catholic faith, which teaches respect for God’s creation and the importance of caring for the environment.\n\nKateri’s devotion manifested in intense ascetic practices that often surpassed the expectations and comfort levels of her Jesuit mentors. These penances, driven by an ardent love for Christ, included extreme fasting and bodily mortifications, which she often concealed from the concerned Jesuits and shared only with close confidantes like Marie-Therese. The severity of Kateri’s self-imposed disciplines reflected a 17th-century Western Catholic theology that emphasized Christ’s suffering. Another intention behind her penances seemed to be reparation: Kateri took on her own body the punishments due to sin that might otherwise fall on the Mohawk nation, whom she loved deeply. Kateri’s asceticism also incorporated traditional Mohawk practices designed to prepare individuals to display their orenda, or “greatness of spirit,” in the face of extreme pain, such ritual torture and death at the hands of enemies. When Marie-Therese informed the Jesuit father that Kateri was lying on a bed of thorns, he ordered her to stop out of obedience.\n\nAfter a painful illness that left her bedridden in the longhouse, Kateri died on Holy Wednesday, April 17, 1680, softly repeating her last words, “Jesus, Mary, I love you,” in her native language. She was buried according to her people’s traditional customs. The Haudenosaunee Catholics of Caughnawaga honored her with the highest praise they could give: “She died as she lived. That is, a saint.” Upon drawing her last breath, her skin became clear and smooth, with no sign of smallpox scars. Her face radiated a smiling beauty and serenity which remained until her burial.\n\nImmediately following her death, Kateri appeared in visions to some of her loved ones, assuring them that she was going home to God. These apparitions held a deeper meaning in traditional Haudenosaunee culture than might be apparent to Catholics accustomed to European culture. According to Haudenosaunee beliefs, the souls of the dead would visit their loved ones before departing to the village of the dead.\n\nOne night, one of the Jesuits had a dream in which St. Kateri appeared to him. In the dream, their chapel was overturned, and one of Caughnawaga’s Catholics was burning at the stake. This prophecy seemed to come true when a powerful windstorm flattened the church, nearly killing the Jesuits inside. They prayed to Kateri for protection and credited their survival to her intercession. This event, along with the eventual martyrdom of Caughnawaga’s Haudenosaunee Catholics, reinforced their belief in her protective presence. This vision of the overturned church and the persecuted indigenous Christian might have multiple fulfillments. Further south, the La Florida Mission Martyrs, primarily Appalachee and Timucua Catholics, were killed for their faith during an invasion and persecution led by the English. The vision’s fulfillment has likely repeated itself in more recent times, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nAlthough St. Kateri did not experience martyrdom herself, her witness and prayers had a profound impact on the Haudenosaunee Catholics of Caughnawaga, deepening their commitment to the Catholic faith.\n\nKateri Tekakwitha’s journey to sainthood is a fascinating tale that intertwines Native American and Catholic traditions. The first written account of her life didn’t appear until 1715, decades after her death. Her commitment to chastity earned her the title “Lily of the Mohawks,” drawing on the flower’s symbolism of purity in Christian iconography. Artistic depictions of Tekakwitha often feature a lily and cross, with feathers or a turtle added to acknowledge her Mohawk heritage. She acquired several other poetic titles, including “the Mohawk Maiden,” “the Pure and Tender Lily,” and “the New Star of the New World.” Her gravestone bears the inscription “the fairest flower that ever bloomed,” reflecting how she was viewed by both her tribal community and European settlers.\n\nTekakwitha’s legacy sparked an increase in Native American participation in Catholicism. In the 1730s, a convent for Native American nuns opened in Mexico. By the 1880s, Indian Catholic missions and bishops were petitioning for her official veneration alongside Jesuit martyrs Isaac Jogues and René Goupil.\n\nOver the centuries, devotion to Kateri Tekakwitha grew, and numerous miracles were attributed to her intercession. Her reputation spread across North America, with French Canadians reporting miraculous recoveries. People would take dirt from her grave and touch it to their bodies. Many personal miracles were attributed to St. Kateri, and among the French, she was known as the “Genevieve of Canada” for her aid during times of conflict and famine. Native communities across the continent heard of Kateri Tekakwitha long before any Catholic missionaries arrived there.\n\nThe path to Tekakwitha’s canonization began in earnest at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1885. Support came from both U.S. and Canadian Catholics, with 906 Native Americans signing letters advocating for her sainthood. Her cause progressed steadily: her spiritual writings were approved in 1936, she was declared Venerable by Pope Pius XII in 1943. There were so many reports of miracles that St. John Paul II waived the first miracle requirement for her beatification in 1980.\n\nThe miracle that led to St. Kateri’s canonization was the healing of a five-year-old boy, Jacob Finkbonner, a descendant of the Lummi nation in Washington state. He was cured of a fatal flesh-eating disease that had attacked his face. Doctors had given up all hope of his recovery. Interestingly, one of Finkbonner’s ancestors had signed a petition to canonize Kateri back in the 19th century.\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2012, Kateri Tekakwitha was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI. Although St. Juan Diego is considered the first indigenous saint of the Americas, Kateri Tekakwitha is the first Native American woman saint. Along with St. Francis of Assisi, she is the patron saint of ecology and the environment. Her patronage also includes Native Americans, orphans, people in exile, those ridiculed for their faith, and World Youth Day. She is also one of the patron saints of Canada. Her feast day in the United States is July 14; in Canada, it is celebrated on April 17.\n\nSt. Kateri Tekakwitha’s canonization has sparked a renewed interest in the Native American roots of Catholicism in North America, fostering a deeper appreciation for indigenous contributions to the faith, and has reinvigorated efforts to recognize other Native American holy figures, such as the Martyrs of La Florida Missions, Nicholas Black Elk, and Rose Prince. These emerging stories of Native American saints and martyrs are enriching the Catholic Church’s understanding of its diverse heritage in North America.\n\nSt. Kateri Tekakwitha was a remarkable figure whose life bridged Indigenous and European cultures during a tumultuous period in North American history. Her life was a powerful witness to the transformative power of faith. Despite the challenges she faced, including the loss of her family, physical ailments, and cultural pressures, St. Kateri remained committed to her spiritual path. Her ability to integrate her Catholic beliefs with her Mohawk identity, her devotion to prayer and the sacraments, and her unwavering commitment to purity and holiness all highlight the central role that faith played in her life. Her legacy remains complex. She is viewed by some as a symbol of religious transformation. Others regard her as a victim of colonization, even though Christianity was never forced upon her; she willingly chose it and embraced it with her entire being. Regardless of interpretation, her story continues to inspire many, showing that true sanctity is possible even in the face of great adversity.\n\nPRAYER TO ST.

Her name was St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, and her powerful visions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus left a lasting impact on the entire Church. If you’re ready to be inspired by the remarkable journey of this visionary saint – her profound faith, incredible supernatural encounters, and the great spiritual legacy she left behind – then keep reading as we explore the extraordinary life and mission of St. Margaret Mary, the Visionary of the Sacred Heart.\n\nMargaret Mary Alacoque was born on July 22, 1647 in Verosvres, a small town in Burgundy, France, a region surrounded by a chain of jagged mountain peaks. She was the fifth of seven children born to Claude, the royal notary of the town, and Philiberte Lamyn Alacoque. Margaret had three older brothers and one younger brother, and two sisters, one older, one younger than she. Both sisters died young, leaving Margaret as the only surviving daughter of the family. The house of her birth consisted of two large buildings separated by a courtyard. The first house, called the cabinet house, was where Margaret was born and today is a chapel devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\nDuring the 1600’s, the Catholic Church in France was plagued with schisms and heresy, especially Jansenism, a strict, puritanical interpretation of morality with a very limited view of salvation. The dogma of God’s infinite love for man was looked upon with coldness, indifference and doubt. Despite this, Margaret Mary’s family were devout Catholics, and Margaret was devoted to Jesus Christ from early childhood. To make her behave, all an adult had to tell her was that her behavior was offensive to God, and she altered her conduct immediately. When she was 4-1/2, Margaret went to live with her godmother, Mademoiselle de Fautrieres de Corcheval, who was childless and greatly wanted Margaret with her. Since her godmother’s castle was near Margaret’s home, and her father often traveled and would be able to visit regularly, her parents consented.\n\nThe Château de Corcheval was an imposing castle, surrounded by mountains and forests. Margaret deeply appreciated its air of solitude. Just outside the gates of the castle was a chapel shaded by trees, where she often went to pray. Two of Mme. de Corcheval’s lady companions taught Margaret to pray, read and write, and als0 taught her catechism. She developed a great and tender devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nWhenever her friends couldn’t find her in prayer at home, they looked in the church, where she usually was found in deep prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. This great love of prayer helped to make her one of the greatest contemplatives of the Church. Margaret wrote in her autobiography, “I was constantly urged to repeat these words, the sense of which I did not understand: ‘My God, I consecrate to Thee my purity! My God, I make to Thee a vow of perpetual chastity!’…I did not know what I had done nor what the words ‘vow’ and ‘chastity’ signified.” She only understood them as giving the complete gift of herself to God.\n\nIn 1655, when Margaret was eight, her godmother died, and Margaret returned to her family. At the end of that same year, her father, Claude, who was only 41, died of pneumonia. Though an honest, devout Christian, he was a poor businessman who did not pay his debts nor collect his fees, leaving his family only a modest amount. Margaret’s mother was determined to remedy their financial situation, which caused her to have to travel frequently. So, her two eldest sons were sent to Cluny and the other two went to their Uncle Antoine Alacoque, a priest and the cure’ of Verosvres. Margaret was sent to the Poor Clares of Charolles. Her time there made such an impression on her that she realized this was the kind of life God wanted her to have, even though the Poor Clares Order was not hidden enough to suit her. The nuns prepared her for First Holy Communion at the age of nine. She was a lively little girl who loved playtime and amusements, but after her First Communion she no longer found them as attractive.\n\nShortly thereafter, she became seriously ill and had to return back home, where she was tenderly cared for by her mother and brothers. Despite their excellent care, she did not seem to be getting better. In Margaret’s own words, “They could find no cure for my malady till they gave me to the Blessed Virgin. They promised her if I were cured, I should someday be one of her daughters. They had no sooner made the vow than I was cured. I ever after experienced the Blessed Virgin’s protection…as of one belonging entirely to her.” During her long hours of convalescence, Margaret felt strongly attracted to prayer. She was more determined than ever to belong unreservedly to God.\n\nIt was only after she recovered from her illness that Margaret noticed all the unfortunate changes that had come over the household. Her mother’s efforts to reestablish the family fortune had not succeeded. A new lease of the land was made in the name of her Uncle Touissant Delaroche, who took over its management. His wife became the absolute mistress of the home, where Margaret’s grandmother Mme. Alacoque and her unmarried daughter Catherine were already living. Margaret’s mother was pushed aside, divested of any influence in the household, and treated very unkindly.\n\nOf this Margaret wrote: “God permitted my mother to be deprived of authority in her own house and forced to yield to others. Those in charge so lorded it over her that both she and I were soon reduced to a state of captivity….We had no freedom in our own house, everything was under lock and key, so that I could not even find my apparel when I wished to go to Holy Mass. I was even obliged to borrow clothes. It was at this time that with all my strength I sought my consolation in the most Blessed Sacrament.” But because they lived in the country, far from the church, Margaret could not go to church without the permission of the family. This often was withheld with an absurd accusation that Margaret was covering up a secret rendezvous under the pretense of going to Mass or Benediction.\n\nHurt and frustrated, Margaret would hide in a corner of the garden, in the stable, or in some other secluded place, where she knelt and poured out her heart in tears to the Blessed Virgin. She remained there for days without eating or drinking. The other people in the village, pitying her, would come in the evening to give her some food. She would finally return to the house fearful and trembling, where she then was accused of neglecting the house and children, and was not allowed to speak in her own defense. God was her only refuge from all her trials. She prayed continuously, and began to practice austere penances.\n\nBut the greatest cross to Margaret at this time was her inability to help her mother in any significant way. When her mother became ill, she was left entirely in Margaret’s care. Margaret was unable to obtain from the head of the household the necessary nourishment for her mother, so she had to beg for eggs and other nutritious food from the people in the village. This was a great trial to Margaret, who was naturally timid and often was received very rudely. One time, her mother was gravely ill, and the doctor said that nothing short of a miracle could save her life. Margaret ran to the church and begged God to heal her mother. When she returned home, her mother was much improved and was completely healed within a few days.\n\nEnduring her relatives’ cruelty was heroic for Margaret. She had a tender, sensitive nature and blossomed under attention and affection, which was sorely lacking in her present environment. Aside from church, her favorite spot was a little wooded area in a valley right outside the gardens that surrounded the house. This would become Margaret’s chosen refuge, where she liked to pray and where she had her first visions. From there she could see the main altar of the church, which was less than half a mile away. Leaning on a rock, she would spend hours in contemplation. At night from her window she could see the little lamp burning before the tabernacle.\n\nIt was during this difficult period that the Lord Jesus began to appear to Margaret. In her innocent way, she thought that everyone was favored with such visions, so she did not think it out of the ordinary. She usually saw Jesus crucified or carrying His cross. These visions allowed her to regard her malicious relatives as instruments through whom God would accomplish His holy will, and she was able to treat them with charity.\n\nWhen Margaret was 17, her circumstances dramatically changed for the better. Her eldest brothers, who were now of age, took charge of the business affairs. Her mother was once again in a position of authority in the household. During the previous 10 years, their Uncle Toussaint, who had most likely died by this time, had regained the fortunes of the family. This meant that now Margaret and her siblings were free to enjoy their lives once again. Since most of them were of marriageable age, there was much social activity at the house. Margaret herself was attracting a lot of attention, and had already received a few good offers of marriage. In appearance, Margaret is said to have been a little above average height and of a delicate constitution. She had an expressive face with soft, clear eyes. Her personality was agreeable and vivacious, her manner cheerful and graceful, yet with keen intelligence, solid judgement, a noble soul and a great heart.\n\nAlthough she maintained her pure, innocent nature, once released from her previous adversity, she now delighted in parties and amusements, cut her prayers short, and stayed away from confession. Lively and bright, she was so fond of fun that it could have led her astray, had she not constantly sought the guidance of Our Lord. At times she would be pierced by remorse, beg God for forgiveness and undertake severe penances. “In spite of all this,” she said. “I fell once again into vanity, and again I offered the same resistance.” One day, during Carnival time, she returned from a masked ball to find the Lord waiting for her. She wrote of this encounter: “My Sovereign Master presented Himself before me all disfigured as He was during his flagellation. He reproached me saying that…I was losing infinitely precious time, of which he would demand of me a rigorous account.” After this experience, Margaret wept bitterly and again subjected herself to severe penances.\n\nShe had not forgotten her vow of chastity, and did not want to marry. She felt great pressure to do so by her family, however, especially her mother, who seemed to feel that her own future would be more secure once Margaret was married and settled. On the other hand, Margaret strongly felt God’s urging to honor her earlier vow. Torn between love for God and love for her mother, Margaret suffered much mental anguish for the next several years. She wondered whether she was truly bound by her childhood vow, since she had not fully understood it at the time. She also felt that she was not worthy of a religious vocation. She decided to devote herself to the service of the poor, giving whatever extra money she had to needy children. She also taught them prayers and catechism in a large room within the Alacoque home. She visited their families and nursed the sick ones, despite the fact that she had a horror of blood, wounds and disease.\n\nWhen Margaret was 20 years old, and still torn between loyalty to her mother and loyalty to God, her two older brothers died within a short time of one another. Her brother Chrysostom then became sole proprietor of the estate and head of the family, and married at the age of 22. James, her youngest brother, was preparing for Holy Orders. Her mother, remembering her past sufferings at the hands of relatives, did not want to live in a household ruled by a daughter-in-law. She tearfully begged Margaret to make a decision to marry and bring her to live with her and her husband. Chrysostom told Margaret it was high time she got married, and James offered her half of his inheritance as a dowry, to further persuade her.\n\nIn the midst of all this pressure, God came to the rescue. One day, after Holy Communion, He said to her, “If you are faithful to me, I shall never leave you. I will render you victorious over all your enemies….If you are faithful to me, I shall teach you to know me and shall manifest myself to you.” Arriving home from church, she told her family of her decision. Her mother, convinced that Margaret really meant it, no longer insisted that she marry. In her memoirs, Margaret wrote, “After this, my mother shed no more tears in my presence, but she wept before all with whom she spoke on the subject. Those persons never failed to tell me that if I left her, I would be the cause of her death.”\n\nDespite Margaret’s resolve, her family was not yet convinced. But now she was sure of what she was going to do and lived in peace about her decision. While visiting some relatives in Macon, she learned that her cousin, a pious young woman, was preparing to enter the Ursuline convent. She urged Margaret to come with her. But Margaret preferred to enter a convent where she knew no one, so that her only motive would be the love of God.\n\nAround this time, her brother Chrysostom arrived to take her home, because her mother was very sick and not expected to live. Margaret wrote, “They made me understand that my mother could not live without me, and that I should have to answer to God for her death. This was told to me even by ecclesiastics, which caused me cruel suffering, as I tenderly loved my mother. The devil made use of this ruse to make me believe that my mother’s death would be the cause of my eternal damnation.”\n\nIn this state of mental torment, Margaret poured out her tears and prayers at the foot of the crucifix. God answered her prayers by gradually changing the hearts of her family members. A visiting priest of the Order of St. Francis became friendly with the family and had a serious discussion with Chrysostom about his opposition to Margaret’s vocation. Fearful of offending God, Chrysostom had a long talk with Margaret and realized how determined she was about her vocation. He immediately arranged for her departure and accompanied her to the Convent of the Visitation in Paray-le-Monial, which she had decided upon. No sooner had she crossed the threshold than she heard an interior voice whisper, “Here it is that I wish you to be.” She returned home to say her last, heart-rending farewells. Upon leaving her mother, she was swept with a terrible wave of bitterness. “It seemed to me,” she said, “that my soul was being torn from my body.”\n\nShe entered the convent of the Visitation on May 25, 1671, at the age of 23. Shortly thereafter, she asked Mother Thouvant, the Mistress of Novices, just what she could do to give herself entirely to God. MotherThouvant answered, “Go place yourself before God like canvas before a painter.”\n\nOn Aug. 25, 1671, Margaret received her habit. Almost immediately afterwards, she began to sense the constant presence of the Lord. As one witness at her canonization described, “She was so united to God that, whether working, writing, or reading, she was always on her knees with such recollection as one might expect to see in church.”\n\nThe Lord appeared to her in visions from time to time, encouraging and consoling her, and sometimes reproving her for her faults. The other nuns, not knowing about this, were baffled by her behavior. As one biographer put it: “What most astonished the Sisters was not only the long hours that she passed on her knees in the choir or in her cell, her face radiant, her eyes full of tears, but the state of constant abstraction from which it was necessary to arouse her. Her work fell from her hands, and she forgot everything. The poor child’s soul was in heaven, and she did not know how to conduct herself on earth.”\n\nThe Mistress of Novices told Margaret that her behavior was not in accordance with the spirit of the Visitation Order, and if she did not change it she would not be allowed to profess her final vows.\n\nOf this Margaret wrote: “I made every effort to follow the method of prayer taught me, along with other practices; but my mind retained nothing of all those teachings. The beautiful points of prayer vanished, and I could neither learn nor retain anything but what my Divine Master taught me. This made me suffer greatly, for His operations in me were frustrated as much as possible, and I had to resist Him as much as I was able.” To help her overcome her state of absorption, Margaret Mary was assigned as an aide to the Mistress of the Infirmary, who was told to keep her constantly employed. Margaret swept floors, cleaned the nuns’ cells, weeded the garden, and other such tasks. Not being allowed time for prayer, she went to the Mistress and asked if she could resume it. She was reprimanded sharply, told she needed to learn how to unite prayer and labor, and sent on to other numerous and demanding tasks.\n\nIt was now August 1672, and Margaret was not yet called to her final vows. She was admired for her humility, obedience, and charity, and although not skillful in domestic ways, she was so willing and eager that the other nuns were touched by her goodness of heart. Yet, as one witness at her canonization attested, “I heard from the Superioress and Mistress of Novices that she would one day be a saint, but that she was so extraordinary that perhaps she was not intended to live out her life at the Visitation.”\n\nAround this time, 52-year-old Mother Marie-Francoise de Saumaise became the Superior of the Visitation convent. She possessed good judgement and fairness, was extremely kind, and had a perfect understanding of the rules of the Visitation Order. She immediately recognized in Margaret Mary the workings of the Spirit of God, and decided she should be allowed to take her final vows on Nov. 6, 1672. Following this, Margaret rapidly increased in virtue to the point that the whole community was astonished. She entered into a state of entire absorption in God. The other Sisters constantly were having to rouse her from this absorption, and they found her often in the chapel, where she knelt motionless for hours with closed eyes and joined hands, seeing and hearing nothing. But if she was asked to do something in the name of obedience, she responded immediately.\n\nAnother Sister once asked her, “My dear Sister, how can you remain kneeling so long?” Margaret replied, “At such times I do not even know that I have a body.” In today’s terms, it would seem that these were out-of-body experiences, where her spirit resided in the heavenly realm while her body remained on earth. The Sisters called her an “ecstatic.” Other saints who were considered ecstatics were Francis of Assisi, Catherine of Siena and Teresa of Avila, to name just a few.\n\nIt was during such ecstatic episodes that Margaret received the grand revelations of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. There were four distinct revelations in all, each separated by a considerable period of time. The first occurred on Dec. 27, 1673. As Margaret Mary knelt before the Blessed Sacrament, she felt entirely filled with the Divine Presence. The Lord said to her,\n\n“My Divine Heart is so passionately in love with humankind that it cannot contain itself within the flames of its ardent charity. It must spread them abroad by your means, and manifest Itself to them.”\n\nHe told Margaret Mary nothing more at this point, except that He was going to use her to make this known to the world, but did not tell her when or how. Then Jesus asked for her heart, which she willingly gave, and placed it within His Sacred Heart.\n\nThe second revelation took place on July 2, 1674. Margaret wrote: “The Divine Heart was presented to me in a throne of flames, more resplendent than a sun, transparent as crystal. It was surrounded with a crown of thorns, signifying the punctures made in it by our sins, and a cross above.”\n\nDuring the third revelation, Jesus appeared brilliant with glory, His five wounds shining like five suns. He revealed to Margaret His wish to be known, loved, and honored by all, and to draw them away from damnation. He said that the ingratitude He received from humankind in return for His great love was much more painful to Him than all He had suffered during His Passion. He promised that if an image of His Heart was venerated and worn over a person’s heart, He would “imprint His love on their hearts and destroy all unruly inclinations.”\n\nShortly after this vision, Margaret Mary came down with a fever that resisted every remedy. The Mother Superior commanded her to ask God for healing, saying that she would recognize such a healing as a sign of the genuinely supernatural character of Margaret’s visions. After Margaret Mary obediently said a short prayer, her fever vanished, her pulse steadied, and the physician pronounced her cured. Now Mother de Saumaise was faced with a dilemma. The instantaneous cure seemed an acknowledgment of Sr. Margaret’s sanctity. But although Margaret’s visions were extraordinary, she was only 26 and had been a nun for merely two years. After seeking counsel, the Mother Superior concluded that Margaret Mary’s case might involve an overactive imagination and maybe some cleverly disguised illusion of the evil spirit.\n\nWhen she was told this, Margaret Mary did not know what to do. She tried to resist the interior attractions, fearing that she was in error. “But I could not succeed,” she wrote. “It was impossible for me to resist the spirit that moved me.” One day, while pouring out her heart in prayer, she heard a voice say to her: “Have patience, and await My servant.” She didn’t know what the words meant, but felt comforted knowing that she would receive God’s assistance when the time was right.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Margaret Mary met this foretold “servant of the Lord,” who would become her spiritual director, invaluable friend and ally. He was Claude de la Colombiere, a 32-yr.-old Jesuit priest who arrived at the convent to give a conference to the Sisters. When Margaret Mary arrived at the conference, she naturally had no idea he was. But she distinctly heard an interior voice say, “Behold him whom I send to you.” When Fr. de la Colombiere later heard Margaret Mary’s confession, he spoke as if he knew everything that was going on in her soul. Although hesitant at first, before the priest left Paray, Margaret Mary confided everything to him. She emerged from this conversation enlightened and consoled. Father de la Colombiere had told her not to fear the guidance of the Spirit, as long as it did not interfere with her religious obedience. He advised her to follow Its instructions, and that she should make continual thanksgiving for such great favors.\n\nOn June 16, 1675, the last of the four Sacred Heart revelations took place, during which Jesus showed His Heart to St. Margaret Mary, saying “Behold the Heart that has so loved men…Instead of gratitude, I receive from most only ingratitude.” He made known to Margaret His requests for devotion to His Sacred Heart, and also made 12 promises of graces that would be bestowed upon all who follow the devotion.\n\nFor more about the Sacred Heart devotion and promises, check out my post, “Unlock the Power: The Sacred Heart Devotion”.\n\nThen Jesus charged her with her great public mission to make devotion to His Sacred Heart known throughout the world. Margaret Mary asked, “Lord, how can I?” But Jesus told her to address herself to that servant of God who had been sent to her expressly for the accomplishment of this task — meaning, of course, Father de la Colombiere. When Margaret Mary confided all this to the priest, he asked for a written account that he could study. After examining it carefully and seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit, Father de la Colombiere told Margaret that she could rely on it, for it indeed came from Heaven. On June 21, Margaret Mary and Father de la Colombiere solemnly consecrated themselves to the Divine Heart of Jesus.\n\nAfter the last revelation, Margaret fell into a period of intense physical and mental suffering. Her health failed, and she became an object of speculation and suspicion to the other Sisters, who could not comprehend her strange mystical behavior. This is understandable, since they did not know about her visions and revelations. Only her Superiors and Father de la Colombiere knew of these. The Community was divided in opinion about her. They acknowledged her virtue, but her conduct was baffling to them. Some of the Sisters wondered if she were possessed by the devil, and some even sprinkled holy water when they passed her.\n\nIn June 1678, Mother Greyfie was elected Superior in place of Mother de Saumaise. She was an austere, rigorous character who had “an extreme distrust for the guidance of extraordinary souls.” It seems that God brought her to the convent to prove beyond a doubt the authenticity of Sister Margaret Mary’s mission. Mother Greyfie, who had heard from Mother de Saumaise about the four Sacred Heart revelations, resolved to ignore them and to see that Margaret adhered in all things to the common life of the Community. She called Margaret Mary to account for whatever went wrong in the convent, and began to take away the permissions that Margaret had previously been granted. One of these was the Holy Hour every week on the night between Thursday and Friday that our Lord had requested of her. Margaret obeyed, but when the Lord in a vision appeared irritated, she feared that a terrible punishment would come upon the community. She told this to Mother Greyfie, who paid no attention. But one day shortly thereafter, one of the youngest and most likable sisters died suddenly and unexpectedly. Mother Greyfie took this as a sign of the Lord’s anger, and quickly restored Margaret’s permission to resume her Holy Hour.\n\nMother Greyfie still enforced the rest of her orders upon Margaret Mary, however, and paid no attention to Margaret’s physical maladies. Even when Margaret was sick with a high fever, she was obliged to follow every exercise of the Community. Mother Greyfie did not act this way to be cruel; she was responsible for the souls of the Sisters in her charge, and did not want to be a victim of deception. To rise above her doubts once and for all, she resolved to demand a miracle that would have many witnesses. She commanded that Mary Margaret should follow all the Community exercises for five months without once returning to the infirmary due to illness. She told Margaret Mary to ask the Lord to grant her the health to be able to carry this out and not be a burden to the Community, until the the feast day of the Presentation of Our Lady, 5 months in the future. Margaret Mary proceeded to follow these instructions to the letter. There occurred an instantaneous cure, followed by perfect health. But at the end of the five months, on the day designated by Mother Greyfie, Margaret Mary’s condition relapsed so severely that God’s intervention seemed evident.\n\nShortly thereafter, Father de la Colombiere returned to France and once again visited the Convent in Paray. He had long conversations with Mother Greyfie about Margaret Mary, whom he had always held in high esteem. He told Mother Greyfie that he truly believed that “what passed in this dear Sister came from God.” Upon meeting with Margaret Mary again, it appeared to him that Mother Greyfie’s severity had served to increase Margaret’s virtue and the divinity of her revelations. Father de la Colombiere was by this time extremely ill, and spent his last 6 months of life in Paray. His final wish was to be buried near the altar where Jesus had appeared to Margaret Mary. He died on Feb. 15, 1682. Today he is known as St. Claude de la Colombiere, having been canonized by Pope John Paul II on May 31, 1992.\n\nMother Greyfie’s six years of being Superior were ending, and Mother Marie-Christine Melin took her place. She was exceedingly kind, and her personality was directly opposite from the severity of her predecessor. She understood the workings of Margaret’s soul and shared with her all the new devotions. She appointed Sister Margaret Mary Mistress of Novices. The novices loved her, because Margaret enkindled the fire of Divine love in their hearts, animated them with her words, and inspired them by example to emulate her. Without disclosing her part in the revelations, she spoke to them of the beauty and treasures of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the graces they could obtain through devotion to it.\n\n“The Divine Heart is an ocean full of all good things, wherein poor souls can cast all their needs,” she said. “It is an ocean full of joy to drown all our sadness, an ocean of humility to drown our folly, an ocean of mercy to those in distress, an ocean of love in which to submerge our poverty.”\n\nUp to now, none of the Sisters except the Superiors knew that Margaret was the recipient of the Sacred Heart apparitions. But this secret was revealed one day by accident. Mother Melin asked one of the Sisters to read to the Community some notes written by Father de la Colombiere during a retreat. Towards the end of these notes, he described a conversation he’d had with the person who had received the Sacred Heart revelations. Although he did not mention Margaret Mary by name, the nun who was reading suddenly discerned that it was Margaret Mary. As she later said, “When I came to what concerned the revelation of the Sacred Heart, I looked at the venerable Sister. She was sitting with her eyes lowered and looking profoundly annihilated…The Community, feeling the same emotions, understood then that it was Margaret who had made these predictions.”\n\nDevotion to the Sacred Heart slowly began to spread from convents and monasteries to the faithful public.. On Feb. 4, 1689, on the First Friday of the month, the first Catholic Mass in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus took place in the chapel of the Convent of the Visitation, in the presence of only the Community. The first public Mass in honor of the Heart was celebrated on the Feast of the Sacred Heart, 19 days after Pentecost, in the Church of the Visitation.\n\nIn 1690, Margaret Mary felt her life was drawing to a close, and she begged the Mother Superior to destroy everything that she had ever written, so that no attention would be given to her after her death. Of course, this request, made out of humility, was ignored. She was regarded by all the Sisters as a holy and privileged soul, and they privately looked upon her as already a saint. Despite her angelic and pure expression, her clear gaze seemed to penetrate one’s very soul, and she often had the ability to read hearts. But this was not intimidating, because of her sweetness and modesty. Small miracles seemed to follow her. One day, another Sister wounded herself while splitting wood with an axe. Not wanting to create a fuss, she hid the wound, but when Margaret passed nearby, she secretively touched her wound to Margaret’s garment. The next morning, there was no trace of the wound.\n\nMargaret spoke often of her impending death, but since she was only 43 yrs. old and relatively healthy, no one took it seriously. But she sweetly and humbly insisted that it would be that year, and even told them how it would happen at a time when they were least expecting it. She even named the two Sisters whose arms would hold her as she died.\n\nIn the Fall of 1690, the day before she was to begin her retreat she came down with a slight fever. The doctor reassured the Sisters that it was nothing serious, and to all outward appearances, this seemed to be the case. But Margaret Mary, knowing better, asked for a particular Sister, saying that she wanted her nearby when she died. To this Sister, she looked to be suffering, not so much physically, but from inner, spiritual pains that were difficult to discern. Margaret Mary told the other Sister of her all-consuming desire to be with God in Heaven, but said she would remain on earth as long as God willed it.\n\nOn Oct. 16, she begged to be given Last Rites, but as she did not appear to be dying, it was refused. So she asked at least to be given Holy Communion. When the Host was brought to her, she opened her arms wide and fervently thanked Jesus for coming to her. She then received what was to be her last Communion on earth.\n\nThe next day, she had some fainting spells and again asked for Last Rites, and was again refused. The doctor said he did not feel she was near death, but Margaret replied, “You’ll see!” That evening, she had a slight convulsion, and the Sister tending her ran to call the Mother Superior. When she came, and mentioned summoning the doctor, Margaret said, “Mother, I no longer need anyone but God alone, and to be buried in the Heart of Jesus.” All the Sisters gathered around her bed, weeping. Margaret Mary rallied enough to tell them all to love God without division or reserve. She then asked once again for the Last Rites. As the priest administered the Sacrament, she tried to raise herself up for the anointing. Two Sisters went spontaneously to support her in their arms. Though no one remembered until later, these were the same two Sisters that Margaret had predicted would be holding her when she died.\n\nMargaret Mary passed from this life to the next at 7:00 p.m. on Oct. 17, 1690, with the name of Jesus on her lips. At that moment, the cry “The saint is dead!” was proclaimed throughout the town. For two days, the townspeople came to view her body, and touched it with chaplets, medals and crucifixes to obtain a blessed relic. She was buried near the spot upon which she had knelt when the Lord appeared to her.\n\nIn 1824, the cause for the canonization of Margaret Mary Alacoque was begun. Two extraordinary cures followed. She was beatified on Sept. 4, 1864 and canonized on May 13, 1920. St. Margaret Mary is the patron saint of devotees of the Sacred Heart, those suffering from polio, and those who have lost parents. Her feast day is celebrated on October 16.\n\nPRAYER OF ST. MARGARET MARY TO THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS\n\nLord Jesus, let my heart never rest until it finds You, who are its center, its love, and its happiness. By the wound in Your heart, pardon the sins that I have committed, whether out of malice or out of evil desires. Place my weak heart in Your own divine Heart, continually under Your protection and guidance, so that I may persevere in doing good and in fleeing evil until my last breath. Amen.\n\n– St. Margaret Mary Alacoque\n\nTo watch the video (which contains Pts. 3 & 4 of the blog posts), click the arrow on the thumbnail below:\n\nThe visionaries who followed Catherine Laboure´ into the Marian Age would be at the center of the attention surrounding the phenomena of their apparitions (i.e., St. Bernadette of Lourdes, the three children of Fatima), but not Catherine. She adamantly insisted to Fr. Aladel that Our Lady had told her to “speak only to her confessor” about the visions. Catherine would not budge from this position for 46 years. We can well imagine the sense of excitement and intrigue in the convent when the news leaked out that one of the Sisters had been privileged to see the Blessed Virgin. The endless conjecture, the sly questions intended to unearth the seer in their midst, could well have tripped up Catherine, but she was more than equal to the task of protecting her secret. Over time, she became quite adept at deflecting suspicion, and probably even enjoyed this challenge to her cleverness and wit.\n\nThere is no doubt that the humility, discretion, and courage it took for Catherine to keep her secret until shortly before her death in 1876 were of such a heroic nature that it remains one of the most significant acts of her life. She truly is a role model for those who lead hidden but fruitful lives in God’s service. At Catherine’s Beatification service, Pope Pius XI said with dry humor, “To think of keeping a secret for 46 years — and this by a woman, and a Sister!”\n\nNot that Catherine adopted a standoffish attitude to protect herself. Quite the contrary — although she had a quiet nature, she was lively and even merry as a novice, spending many happy hours with the other Sisters during recreation. There is little doubt, however, that keeping her secret was the right thing for her particular soul, as she was shy and did not like the limelight. For her, obscurity was the road to sanctity. She knew she was only an instrument of God’s grace, and that her visions were a gift to the world and not for herself alone.\n\nCatherine’s life in the years after the great Apparitions of 1830 is beautifully summarized in the words of her dear friend, Sr. Sejole: “Later on, when they speak of her who saw the Blessed Virgin, you will be happy to have known this beautiful soul, living such an ordinary life and keeping herself hidden behind her duties.”\n\nLike all of us, Catherine had her own particular faults to overcome. Throughout her life she was given to flashes of temper and a sharp tongue. She also had a very strong will, which is obvious in the way she overcame so many obstacles in the early years of her life. But once the mission of the Medal was accomplished, Catherine’s life took on a different tone. Now she had to live in complete submission to her superiors, who were sometimes unreasonable, even wrong, in their judgment. Yet because of her vow of obedience, Catherine had to conquer her natural impulse to do things her own way.\n\nFor instance, although Catherine had been the very competent mistress of her father’s household from a young age, she was now often forced to accept a superior’s way of doing things, despite the fact that Catherine was far more capable than her superiors of the task at hand. Having strong ideas herself about how things should be done, she often found it difficult being contradicted. But she rose above this by developing the virtues of patience and humility to the extent that she was able to graciously defer to the other Sister and be charitable to her above and beyond what was required.\n\nAlthough Catherine took her vow of poverty so seriously that upon her death the Sr. Servant was shocked to find so few belongings in Catherine’s possession, she was generous in her consideration of others. One day, she saw a Sister return from laundry duty with her habit soaking wet. Concerned that the Sister should not become chilled, Catherine went hastily to the Superior to get some warm flannel so the Sister could change her clothes.\n\nCatherine’s superiors definitely recognized her extraordinary capabilities and common sense, because in 1836, at the age of 30, she was given the important position of being in charge of the elderly men at Enghien and running the little farm attached to the Hospice. Catherine loved this because it reminded her of her childhood on the Laboure´ farm, and she enjoyed feeding the chickens and milking the cows. Though not officially given the title, she was Assistant Superior of both the Hospice d’Enghien and the nearby House of Charity of Reuilly, which shared a common Superior and chapel.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Catherine’s daily routine remained virtually unchanged. She cared for the aged residents in her charge — irascible and difficult as some of them were — with unflinching devotion, patience, compassion, and kindness. She already had experience dealing with these sorts of men at her brother’s restaurant, and it must have occurred to Catherine that the time she had spent as a waitress had served a Divine purpose after all, in preparing her to deal with the men at Enghien. As she had done for most of her life, Catherine served meals, mended clothes, nursed the sick, comforted the dying, and kept everyone content and everything running smoothly. For those who are caregivers to the elderly, Catherine serves as a shining example and steadfast source of help and inspiration.\n\nCatherine followed St. Vincent’s own counsel that no religious exercise, not even Mass, should come before the needs of the sick or poor. She was so devoted to her charges that she would turn down invitations to festivals and other diversions, saying, “These are good for the young Sisters, but I have to care for my old men.” She always took time out, however, for spiritual conferences and retreats, knowing she needed these to feed and sustain her soul.\n\nShe insisted that “her old men” receive the best of food in generous quantities. On her feast day, one of the men stood up at the end of the meal and announced, “Sr. Catherine, you are very good to us, and at table you always ask, ‘Have you had enough?’ “ Yet she did not spoil her charges — she ruled the house with a firm but loving hand. Some of the old men would return drunk after their weekly day out. Catherine would put them promptly to bed, carrying away their clothes and hiding them for the next three days, and these men would not be allowed their next day out. But when another Sister once reproached her for not being stern enough with a particular offender, Catherine replied, “I can’t help it. I keep seeing Christ in him.” She did, however, dutifully reprimand him the next morning.\n\nThe one virtue that seemed to shine most brightly in Catherine was her purity. Her sister Tonine once said of Catherine, “she did not know evil.” Many who knew her believe that it was because of her extraordinary chastity that Mary chose her to be the recipient of the apparitions. Thus, the greatest trial Catherine faced was caring for those men in her charge whom she knew to be impure. Revulsion would engulf her, and it took a supreme effort of will, made possible by prayer, for her to see Christ in even the foulest of her charges. In this way, she was able to control her feelings and care for them with tenderness and compassion. With great charm and grace she was able to melt the hearts of even the most hardened sinners.\n\nEven though she had entered the religious life, Catherine never lost her deep love of family and warmly welcomed the frequent visits of her brothers and their families, who lived in Paris. Tonine married in 1858 and also moved nearby, renewing with Catherine the close sisterly relationship they had shared in earlier years. When Tonine later died after a long and painful illness, Catherine was at her bedside. Catherine was also able to be at the deathbed of her brother Jacques, lovingly placing a Miraculous Medal around his neck.\n\nAt the request of Fr. Aladel, in 1841 Catherine wrote out her first complete account of the apparitions. She also entreated Fr. Aladel to have an altar built on the spot of the apparitions and to have a commemorative statue made of Our Lady with the globe in her hands (the first phase of the Apparition of Nov. 27), to be placed on the altar. Although Fr. Aladel made a tentative start on this matter, he did not follow through, much to Catherine’s perpetual dismay.\n\nIn 1842, the dramatic and well-publicized conversion, attributed to the Miraculous Medal, of Alphonse Rattisbonne, a vehemently anti-Catholic banker, resulted in Rome’s official recognition of the Medal. There is no doubt that the Apparition of 1830 and the subsequent outpouring of devotion to the Immaculate Conception because of the Medal, had a great bearing on the solemn declaration by Pope Pius IX in 1854 of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. When in 1858 news reached Catherine about the apparition of Our Lady to Bernadette Soubirous at Lourdes, she exclaimed, “You see, it is our own Blessed Mother, the Immaculate!”\n\nAlthough Catherine had told Fr. Aladel in 1830 that the Blessed Virgin wished to establish a Confraternity of Children of Mary, he did not act on this until 1835, when he petitioned Rome about it. In 1847, the Children of Mary was officially established, soon spreading worldwide. Although for reasons of secrecy Catherine did not connect herself with the Confraternity, she welcomed and encouraged each new member of the Children of Mary in Reuilly. Always concerned with the souls of the young, she often spent time with the neighborhood children.\n\nIn 1860, 37-yr.-old Sr. Jeanne Dufes became Superior of Reuilly and Enghien. Because she and Catherine were alike in many ways — practical, capable, but stubborn and quick-tempered — there was a natural antipathy between them from the start. But, as Sr. Dufes herself was to later admit, Catherine was able to conquer her flashes of temper immediately, while Sr. Dufes had to struggle long and hard with hers. Because there was always the suspicion among the community that Catherine was the Sister of the Apparitions, Sr. Dufes may have felt it her duty to keep Catherine humble. Sr. Dufes did not dislike Catherine, but usually neglected her, treating her with indifference and little appreciation. She often reprimanded Catherine unfairly for trivialities, even in front of the other Sisters. Yet Catherine always held her tongue, remaining humble and obedient which, given her natural tendencies, required great strength of character.\n\nOn April 25, 1865, the 35th anniversary of Catherine’s first vision of St. Vincent’s heart, Fr. Aladel died of a stroke, and Fr. Etienne succeeded him as Catherine’s confessor. Five years later, France once again suffered terribly from yet another change in government following the Franco-Prussian War. Our Lady’s prediction in 1830 of the horrors that would occur “in 40 years” now came to pass, and the houses of Reuilly and Enghien were caught in the thick of it. But once again they were protected, as Our Lady had promised.\n\nWhen peace returned to France, peace settled also upon Catherine’s soul in these, her final, years. She no longer had to dread the dire events prophesied by Our Lady, as she had for the past 40 years. Her country and her religious community had come through it safely. Catherine was now growing old and her body was beginning to wear down. Although she certainly did not fear death, and no doubt looked forward to seeing the Virgin again in the next life, she did not have the great desire for death that some other saints had. Despite severe arthritis of the knees, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, she carried out all her duties to the best of her ability, knowing in her wise way that this was all God expected of anyone. But gradually, her Superiors eased her workload and assigned assistants to her, some of whom, ironically, caused Catherine more trouble than the work itself had. One lay helper, being mentally unstable, was so difficult that Catherine was the only one who would tolerate her. Despite the woman’s cruel attitude toward her, Catherine refused to have her dismissed, because she knew the woman would not find employment anywhere else.\n\nIn 1874, Catherine was relieved of her position as Custodian, and Sr. Tanguy was chosen to succeed her, receiving the title of Assistant Superior of Reuilly and Enghien — a title Catherine had never been granted, despite having done the job for 38 years. This was hard for Catherine, especially since she did not particularly like Sr. Tanguy. Catherine, however, not only practiced charity toward her, but when asked her feelings about Sr. Tanguy’s appointment, she replied, “Our Superiors have spoken, and that should be sufficient for us to receive Sr. Tanguy as an angel from heaven.”\n\nIn May of 1876, perhaps realizing that she had not much longer to live, Catherine decided to make a last attempt to have the statue of “Our Lady of the Globe” made. Her failure to accomplish this task all those years was one of the greatest crosses of her life. But now she needed the help of both Fr. Bore, current Superior General of the Community, and of Sister Superior Dufes. This meant that Catherine had to break her silence of 46 years and reveal to them her identity as the Sister of the Apparitions. She did this after praying and receiving Our Lady’s permission.\n\nSr. Dufes set the wheels in motion by hiring a sculptor, Froc Robert, to begin work on the statue. Not surprisingly, upon seeing the finished plaster model, Catherine exclaimed in disappointment, “Ah — the Blessed Virgin was much more beautiful than that!” Nevertheless, Catherine had finally accomplished her one remaining mission, and now she told everyone that she would not live to see the New Year. Despite their disbelief, she insisted with a smile, “You will see!” Throughout her religious life, Catherine had predicted many events which later came to pass, but oddly enough, none of her fellow nuns seemed to recognize the significance of this extraordinary gift.\n\nAs the year wore on, she became sicker and weaker. Although she still went out occasionally, she found herself confined to bed with increasing frequency. It was at this time that Fr. Chevalier, her new confessor, requested that Catherine write once again a full account of her visions. This last account agreed in every detail with the accounts of 1841 and 1846.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 1876, Catherine was feeling well enough to receive a visit from her niece Marie, during which she gave Marie a Miraculous Medal — the last of her supply of the original ones. When Marie left, she told Catherine she would stop by in the morning to wish her a Happy New Year, but Catherine replied, “I shall not be here.” Shortly after 6:00 p.m., she took a turn for the worse. The Sisters gathered around her to say the prayers for the dying, and at 7:00 p.m., Catherine Laboure´ went peacefully to join her beloved Heavenly Mother.\n\nAt supper that evening, Sr. Dufes read to the enthralled Community Catherine’s account of the Visions. The exciting news that Catherine had indeed been the Sister of the Apparitions (as many had suspected) soon spread beyond the convent to the whole city. Catherine’s funeral was held on Jan. 3, 1877, and she was laid to rest in a vault beneath the chapel at Reuilly, as she herself had predicted several weeks earlier. A few days after the funeral, the first cure attributed to Catherine Laboure´ occurred. A 10-yr.-old boy, who had been paralyzed since birth, was totally restored to health after touching Catherine’s tomb.\n\nIn 1895, a petition was submitted to Rome for a feast day in honor of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, and shortly thereafter the Cause for the Beatification of Sr. Catherine Laboure´ was also begun. After a long period of research into Catherine’s life, she was beatified on May 28, 1933. As is customary, at this time the body of Blessed Catherine was exhumed. It was found to be as fresh and incorrupt as on the day she was buried.\n\nCatherine Laboure´ was canonized on July 17, 1947. At the close of the ceremony, Pope Pius XII said of her:\n\n“Favored though she was with visions and celestial delights, she did not advertise herself to seek worldly fame, but took herself merely for the handmaid of God and preferred to remain unknown and to be reputed as nothing. And thus, desiring only the glory of God and of His Mother, she went meekly about the ordinary, and even the unpleasant, tasks that were assigned to her….And while she worked away, never idle but always busy and cheerful, her heart never lost sight of heavenly things: indeed she saw God uninterruptedly in all things and all things in God.”\n\n***\n\nAuthor’s Note: I have always had a particular interest in and devotion to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, having attended church and school as a child in the parish of that name (nicknamed “OLMM”) in Ridgewood, NY. I now live near Philadelphia, where the Shrine of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal has its home in Germantown. It seems that Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal is never far from me! Although I had learned the story of the Miraculous Medal as a child from the nuns who taught at OLMM school, I didn’t know much outside of the basic facts about St. Catherine Laboure, to whom the medal was first revealed. Always fascinated by mystics and visionaries, I wanted to find out more about her, and that’s how I came to write this series. I hope you found it interesting.\n\nYou’ve lost your wallet with your driver’s license, credit cards, and money just withdrawn from the ATM. Quick — who ya gonna call? Chances are, if you’re like most Catholics, you’ll enlist the aid of St. Anthony of Padua, renowned for his ability to recover everything from a missing child to a misplaced set of house keys. But this is only one of the many powers attributed to this extraordinary saint, acknowledged as one of the greatest miracle workers of all time.\n\nHe began his remarkable life at Lisbon, Portugal in 1195 and was christened “Fernando.” Little is known of his early years. Experts cannot even agree on his parents’ names, but it is generally believed they were wealthy members of the nobility. He was educated at the Cathedral school in Lisbon, and at the age of 15 joined the Canons Regular of St. Augustine. In 1212 he was transferred to Coimbra in order to devote himself more fully to prayer and study, away from the distraction of frequent visits by family and friends.\n\nIn 1220 Don Pedro, Crown Prince of Portugal, brought from Morocco the relics of the first Franciscan martyrs. Seized with a new zeal to be a missionary and martyr, he left the Augustinians to join the Franciscan Order, founded about a decade earlier in Assisi by Francesco Bernardone (who would become known as Francis of Assisi). He took the name Anthony after Antony of Egypt, founder and father of organized Christian monasticism. Shortly thereafter, he was permitted to go as a missionary to Morocco, but God had other plans for him.\n\nImmediately upon his arrival, he became so ill with malaria that he was forced to return to Europe. The ship on which he booked passage was diverted off course by severe storms and docked in Sicily. He recuperated there for several months, then went to Assisi, where he was assigned to the hermitage near Forli, a town outside Bologna. Although a brilliant scholar with a profound knowledge of Scripture, his great humility caused him to say nothing of his scholastic achievements. He lived quietly, serving the other Brothers and working in the kitchen.\n\nOne day, he accompanied some other Friars to Forli for an ordination. At the last minute there was no one available to preach, and in desperation the Superior asked Anthony to speak whatever the Holy Spirit prompted. Things would never be the same again! Although timid at first, Anthony was soon preaching so eloquently and fervently that everyone was amazed. Thus began the aspect of his public life for which he would become the most renowned: preaching. “When the Holy Spirit enters a soul,” he wrote, “He fills it with His fire and lets it enkindle others.” He had all the qualities of a successful preacher: a charismatic presence, clear, resonant voice, attractive appearance and magnetic personality. Although the Franciscans were guarded in their attitude toward book learning, Francis was so impressed by Anthony’s newly-discovered ability that he appointed him as teacher of theology to the Franciscans.\n\nDuring the remainder of his short life, Anthony’s achievements were astounding. Crowds numbering over 30,000 flocked to hear him speak. He preached so forcefully against heresy, he became known as malleus hereticorum, “Hammer of the Heretics.” Thousands of conversions followed his compelling sermons, and miracles abounded wherever he went. Many of these miracles are legendary: Along the coast of Rimini, fish rose out of the water as he preached. Poisoned food offered to Anthony by his enemies was rendered harmless after he made the sign of the cross over it. A young man’s amputated foot was miraculously restored at Anthony’s touch.\n\nIn 1226, after the death of Francis of Assisi, Anthony eventually made his home in Padua, where he was greatly revered. During Lent in 1231, he preached a powerful series of sermons that were to be his last. Shortly after Easter he became fatally ill with edema, and died in Vercelli on June 13, 1231, at the age of 36. Immediately after his death he appeared to Thomas Gallo, the Abbott at Vercelli. Numerous miracles followed, and he was canonized on May 30, 1232, less than a year later — one of the fastest canonization processes in the Church’s history! Pope Gregory IX, who had known him personally, called Anthony the “Ark of the Covenant,” because of his prodigious knowledge of Holy Scripture.\n\nThirty years later, Anthony’s body was exhumed and his tongue found to be perfectly preserved. It remains uncorrupt to this day. When St. Bonaventure beheld this miracle, he exclaimed, “O Blessed Tongue, that always praised the Lord and made others bless Him, now it is evident what great merit you have before God!”\n\nSo how did he come to be regarded as “Finder of the Lost?” It all began with a cherished book of Psalms belonging to Anthony, in which he kept written notes for use in teaching theology to the friars. One day a novice suddenly deserted the monastery, taking with him, for reasons unknown, Anthony’s precious Psalm book. Anthony pleaded with Heaven for its return. The novice soon had a change of heart and not only returned the book, but rejoined the Franciscan Order. After Anthony’s death, people invoked his help in finding lost and stolen things, and so many of these were recovered that he became known as the patron saint of lost articles.\n\nHis patronage also includes: amputees, animals, barrenness, boatmen, donkeys, the elderly, expectant mothers, fishermen, harvests, horses, mariners, Native Americans, the oppressed, the poor, Portugal, the Tigua Indian tribe, travelers, against shipwrecks and starvation.\n\nIn paintings St. Anthony is often depicted holding the Child Jesus. This custom dates back to a 17th-century legend which says that while staying at a friend’s house, Anthony was spied on by his host, who found him in a state of rapture with the Christ Child in his arms.\n\nToday, more than 750 years after his death, Anthony of Padua is one of the most popular and powerful saints of the Church, the many miracles attributed to him over the centuries earning him the title of “The Wonder-Working Saint.” His Feast Day is June 13th.\n\nWHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM ST. ANTHONY\n\nSo, what are some lessons we can take from St. Anthony’s example? In thinking about his life, here are a few I came up with:\n\nFOCUS. No doubt Fernando (later to be called Anthony) greatly loved his family and friends, but even as a teenager, he understood the value of avoiding distraction, so that he could stay focused on his studies and spiritual growth. How often do we let distractions keep us from doing things that are vital to our future and our development as a person? Distractions are much more rampant than they were in Anthony’s day, but we can still learn to be disciplined enough to know when to say “no” and keep ourselves focused on what is most important.\n\nHUMILITY & INDEPENDENCE FROM THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHER PEOPLE: Not only were Anthony’s dreams thwarted by illness and other difficulties, but he was reassigned to a new location and given the most menial of tasks to perform. He probably could have asserted himself and insisted that, with his superior education, he should be given more prestigious work to do. But he honored his vow of obedience to his superiors, and accepted with grace and humility the tasks he was assigned. He placed his future in the hands of God, who knew his abilities and how to use them. In today’s world, it seems that everyone is vying for attention and approval from others. Spending just a few minutes on social media makes this apparent. Many times, people are trying to get attention for the most superficial reasons, instead of earning it by actual achievements. Anthony knew that, in time, he would fulfill his potential according to God’s plan, and he was patient and humble enough to wait.\n\nLEAVING OURSELVES OPEN TO THE PROMPTING OF THE SPIRIT. Anthony was probably terrified at the prospect of suddenly being called upon to preach publicly, without any preparation. He could have refused, but again, he cooperated with his superiors and trusted in God – with the most amazing results! When we open ourselves to the Holy Spirit, He will do amazing things through us as well.\n\nGOD’S PLAN DIFFERED FROM ANTHONY’S, BUT HE ACCEPTED THIS WITH GRACE AND COURAGE. Anthony dreamed of doing great things for God, to be sent as a missionary to Morocco and maybe even die for his Faith. He almost made it to his first goal, but God knew that Anthony’s destiny would be best served by staying close to home. This is a perfect example of “thriving where you are planted.” We don’t know how Anthony would have fared had he stayed in Morocco, but it’s doubtful that he could have achieved more greatness than he did by by following God’s will and doing his best to thrive where he was planted in Italy. This is a reminder to us to not get discouraged when our plans don’t work out, because God sees the big picture and will lead us to our destiny, if we trust in Him.\n\nGUARDING THE TONGUE. Because Anthony was so renowned as a preacher, and the Holy Spirit infused him with such great wisdom in his speech, it’s not surprising that after Anthony’s death, the part of his body that God preserved from corruption was his tongue. St. Paul wrote in his letter to the Ephesians: “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful in building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.” Ephesians 4:29. Anthony perfectly exemplified what St. Paul meant, and it’s a heads-up to us that our words can build up or destroy, edify or corrupt. Anthony’s incorrupt tongue is a symbol that his words were never used to corrupt, but only to spread God’s Light and love to everyone who heard him speak.\n\nWE DON’T ALWAYS KNOW FOR WHAT WE WILL BE MOST LOVED AND REMEMBERED. Many Catholics know the little prayer, “Something’s lost and can’t be found. Quick, St. Anthony, look around!” It may seem strange that, given all of Anthony’s remarkable achievements during his lifetime, today most people know him best as “Finder of the Lost.” But I think God allows this because it makes St. Anthony so relatable to all of us ordinary people, to whom losing something necessary or precious is a very real concern. He, too, had lost something precious and was so upset that he pleaded with God to help him recover it. St. Anthony is one of the best-loved saints, and I think that’s because so many of us have called upon his help when we’ve lost something important, and when we found it, we were so grateful to him for interceding on our behalf, it made him seem like a good friend. This makes him seem more accessible than if he were known just as a great preacher and miracle-worker.\n\nNone of us truly knows, until we die, which deeds or characteristics we will be most remembered for, or which touched other people’s lives the most. Like St. Anthony, we can only do our best to live our lives with love and kindness.\n\nTRADITIONAL PRAYER TO ST. ANTHONY\n\nHoly Saint Anthony, gentle and powerful in your help, your love for God and charity for His creatures, made you worthy, when on earth, to possess miraculous powers. Miracles waited on your word, which you were always ready to request for those in trouble or anxiety. Encouraged by this thought, I implore you to obtain for me (request). The answer to my prayer may require a miracle. Even so, you are the Saint of miracles. Gentle and loving Saint Anthony, whose heart is ever full of human sympathy, take my petition to the Infant Savior for whom you have such a great love, and the gratitude of my heart will ever be yours. Amen.\n\nTO WATCH THE YOUTUBE VIDEO (PARTS 1 & 2 COMBINED), CLICK THUMBNAIL BELOW:\n\nPart One summarized Bernadette’s life, highlighting the apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes to Bernadette in 1858 and the miraculous healing spring which Bernadette unearthed at Our Lady’s direction. We took a look at some of her virtues and struggles. In Part Two, we continue to explore Bernadette’s characteristics and the many challenges she faced throughout her life.\n\nSense of Humor\n\nBernadette had a quick wit and a merry, sometimes mischievous, personality. At the convent, she often entertained the other sisters during recreation with her amusing stories and talent for mimicry. But her wit was always good-natured, never malicious or hurtful. Her sense of humor no doubt kept her from taking herself too seriously and becoming overwhelmed by the extremes of adulation and ridicule that came with being a public figure.\n\nPeople often used any excuse to make her touch objects so they could have a blessed relic. Knowing their intentions, she would quip, “And after I touch it, how much more will it be worth?”\n\nCharity\n\nBernadette loved nursing the sick and excelled at it. “She always had the kind word that relaxed, reassured, and got them to take their medicine,” said one of her patients. In November 1872 she was made Head Infirmarian at Nevers, a position she held until October 1873. Friendly and affectionate, she was a compassionate and understanding listener, who always had an encouraging word for the troubled or homesick novices her superiors often sent to her.\n\nIn the words of one of her fellow teachers: “I never heard her say an unbecoming word, nor fail in charity.”\n\nPrayer\n\nAdmittedly incapable of lengthy recitations, Bernadette often repeated short prayers throughout the day, such as: “My God, I believe in You, hope in You; I love You.”\n\nShe loved common prayer but did not practice many private devotions, except the ones she considered most important: Mass, Communion, and the Stations of the Cross. She placed a strong emphasis on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and had a profound respect for priests. “The priest at the altar is always Jesus on earth,” she often said. “If you encounter a priest and an angel, the priest should be acknowledged first.”\n\nDeluged with endless prayer petitions, she always agreed, on one condition: “I also need prayers. I don’t give something for nothing!” She was faithful to the Virgin’s message of prayer and penance given at Lourdes, and offered her prayers and sacrifices to Our Lord each day for the conversion of one sinner.\n\nAlthough she had some initial difficulty learning the Rosary, it remained a favorite devotion throughout her life. She often recommended it to others, saying, “You will never say it in vain. Go to sleep reciting it…like little children who fall asleep saying ‘Mama’.” She also was devoted to St. Joseph and her Guardian Angel, and told a novice, “When you pass the chapel and haven’t time to stop, tell your Guardian Angel to take your messages to Our Lord in the tabernacle.”\n\nSilence\n\nAlthough vivacious and talkative by nature, when it came spiritual matters, Bernadette found God in the practice of recollection. She had difficulty with formal meditation, but loved the Congregation’s rule of silence during specified times and would break it only for the most urgent reasons.\n\n“Silence was one of Bernadette’s fundamental traits,” said Bishop Forcade of Nevers. “Although people delight in attributing to her countless beautiful sayings that I, for my part, have never heard, I have always observed that she suffered, like everything else she did, simply and without words.”\n\nDevotion to Mary\n\nBernadette never referred to the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, except when giving an account of the apparition of March 25 in which the Lady identified herself by that title. When speaking of the Blessed Virgin, she usually called her “my Good Mother,” or “my Mother in heaven.” Ironically, Bernadette’s earthly mother, Louise, died on December 8, 1866 — the feast of the Immaculate Conception! Of this Bernadette said, “The Blessed Virgin wanted it that way to show me that she would replace my mother, whom I had lost.”\n\nBernadette’s piety towards Mary was simple, trusting, daughterly, and like everything else about her, without ostentation. She always urged others to “love her very much,” exclaiming, “If you only knew how good the Blessed Virgin is!” When asked if the Virgin was beautiful, Bernadette replied, “So beautiful that when you’ve seen her once, you can’t wait to die see her again….When you’ve seen her, you can’t love this world anymore.”\n\nMost of the time, however, Bernadette spoke of the Lady of Lourdes only when asked, and then her answers were brief, objective and reserved. Over time, Bernadette’s memory of the apparitions grew dimmer, and she could no longer see a clear image in her mind’s eye. But she didn’t need a picture, because it was forever engraved in her heart.\n\nOur Lady’s Promise\n\nAlthough Bernadette rarely spoke of the Virgin’ s words, “I cannot promise to make you happy in this world, but in the next,” she accepted them fully as her own personal penance. She did not consider the second part of the promise to be a guarantee of heaven, but conditional upon her doing what was required. Throughout her life, she suffered illness, frustration, separation from family, and every public reaction to her from veneration to curiosity to harassment and ridicule. “Oh, how tiresome this is!” she would sigh. “When will they stop treating me like a strange animal?”\n\nA considerable amount has been written, much of it exaggerated, about the complex relationship between Bernadette and her superiors at Nevers, particularly Mother Marie-Therese Vauzou. It’s true, however, that this situation was one of Bernadette’s heaviest crosses. Mother Vauzou, despite her initial excitement at having the visionary of Lourdes join the Order, was often cold and severe with Bernadette, subjecting her to frequent humiliation and testing her almost beyond endurance.\n\nOne likely explanation was the problem presented by the entrance of so extraordinary a figure as Bernadette into the Order. The Sisters recognized the challenge of trying to treat her like any ordinary novice. Most likely, in their zeal to protect Bernadette’s soul as well as the dignity and integrity of the Congregation, her superiors sometimes carried their efforts too far.\n\nAnother factor was the basic difference in personality between Mother Vauzou and Bernadette. Mother Vauzou wanted the sisters in her charge to openly confide in her, and hoped to be privy to the innermost thoughts and soul-stirrings of the chosen one of Mary. Bernadette’s disinclination to analyze or verbalize about the spiritual life must have greatly frustrated and disappointed Mother Vauzou.\n\nMoreover, being somewhat of a snob regarding class distinctions, Mother Vauzou was probably resentful and jealous of the graces and attention that had been showered upon Bernadette, a mere peasant girl. For Bernadette’s part, although she felt somewhat reserved and uneasy around Mother Vauzou, she loved and admired her, and suffered greatly when she didn’t receive the same affection as the other nuns did.\n\nWhether a warmer relationship with her superiors would have jeopardized Bernadette’s sanctity is impossible to say. But she eventually attained a state of detachment that allowed her to endure such psychological suffering without complaining or harboring grudges. During a retreat, she wrote in her notes: “Work on becoming indifferent to everything my superiors or companions say or think about me….To live for God only, for God everywhere, for God always.”\n\nPatience and Fortitude\n\nFrom the age of six, Bernadette was plagued with various physical illnesses, including stomach and spleen ailments and asthma. At Nevers, she developed tuberculosis of the bone. An enormous tumor on her right knee caused her excruciating pain, and she suffered attacks of coughing so severe they nearly choked her. Eventually, disease ravaged her entire system. Agonizing sores erupted all over her body, including abscesses in her ears that affected her hearing.\n\nIn addition to physical afflictions, Bernadette experienced a “dark night of the soul,” during which she was tormented with demonic attacks and temptations of doubt and despair. She told her good friend Julie Garros in 1873: “It’s really painful not to be able to breathe, but it’s much worse to be tortured by interior distress. It’s terrifying.”\n\nSister Marthe once found Bernadette crying and inquired if she was feeling sick. Bernadette replied, “If you only knew everything that’s going on inside me…Pray for me!” At the heart of this inner torment were her deeply disturbing, though unwarranted, doubts about the apparitions and the fear that she “might have been mistaken” about them.\n\nThroughout all her sufferings, Bernadette remained cheerful and patient. Her first thought was always for others rather than herself. Although she accepted her afflictions with tremendous grace and courage, she did not love suffering for its own sake or voluntarily seek it out. Despite her devotion to St. Bernard, her patron saint, she admitted, “I don’t imitate him very much. St. Bernard loved suffering, while I avoid it as much as I can.”\n\nDuring the final phase of her life, Bernadette’s spirituality evolved into a state of complete abandonment to God. She removed all the holy pictures with which she had surrounded her sickbed, keeping only the crucifix. When asked why, she said, “This is enough for me.” In the throes of her deepest agony she would clutch it and say with resignation, “Now I am like Him.”\n\nIn a letter to the Pope, she wrote: “My weapons are prayer and sacrifice, which I will grip firmly to my dying breath. Only then will the weapon of sacrifice fall, but prayer will come along with me to heaven where it will be much more powerful.”\n\nAn “Exquisite Soul”\n\nThe essence of Bernadette’s sanctity is beautifully expressed in the words of Pope Pius XI, who called her “a simple miller’ s daughter, who possessed no other wealth than the candor of her exquisite soul.” In his homily at Bernadette’s canonization Mass, he said: “When one considers Bernadette’s life…[it] can be summed up in three words: Bernadette was faithful to her mission, she was humble in glory, she was valiant under trial.”\n\n*\n\nAuthor’s Note: I have loved St Bernadette and the story of her life and the apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes since I was a child and first saw the beautiful movie, “The Song of Bernadette,” based on the best-selling novel by Franz Werfel. Although the novel and movie contain some fictionalized or romanticized elements, they are based on historical fact and give a wonderful overall picture of the marvelous events at Lourdes and the life of St. Bernadette Soubirous. I highly recommend both the book and the movie. Jennifer Jones gives a glowing and poignant portrayal of Bernadette, and the movie is worth watching for her performance alone, which won her the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1943. It’s hard to watch the ending without being moved to tears.\n\nInterestingly, Franz Werfel was a German-spea"
