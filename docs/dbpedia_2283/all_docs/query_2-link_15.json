        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe practice of translating into a non-mother tongue (outward translation) is as old as the art of translation itself, but today a strong bias exists against it in many countries. Outside of academia, however, the common assumption is that translators work in both directions, and my research shows that this is in fact the practical reality in many parts of the world. It is clear that the quality of any translation depends on the abilities and strategies of the individual translator, not on the mother tongue or the directionality of the translation.\n\nThe translation of doctrinal or apologetic texts is a specialized undertaking where accuracy is more important than style, and the original message must be carefully preserved. For this type of translation, consideration should be given to experienced outward translators with comprehensive theological knowledge, as they are more likely to recognize biblical expressions in the source text and correctly interpret difficult passages.\n\nThe reluctance of a religious organization to use outward translators, coupled with the necessity of using volunteers due to lack of funding, restricts the amount of apologetic materials it is able to produce in other languages. I chose to do an outward translation into French of In the Name of Jesus by David K. Bernard, a book that represents a core teaching of the United Pentecostal Church International. With this endeavour, I will make an additional doctrinal book available to French UPCI constituents, and hopefully play a role in counteracting the bias against outward translation."
