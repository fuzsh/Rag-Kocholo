        "text": "Since this page is catching a lot of search engines, I guess I should put up an intro blurb...\n\nWelcome. This is a collection of Lion Kimbro's thoughts for about a year now. (Written sometime in 2001.) No, this isn't a silly blog; This is a categorized selection of thoughts, most directed towards some end, rather than a \"Oh, I woke up and saw a pretty bird; I'm feeling... grouchy!... today.\" sort of thing.\n\nRecommended use? Search this doc (Control-F for the internet explorer folk) for the word that interests you. If nothing shows up, wait a couple moments; this file is probably still loading.\n\nSome day I'll divide this up into a bunch of database entries. Until then, you have this enormous flat file.\n\nIf you are curious about the thought database itself, search for \"ThoughtDB\".\n\nList Virtues Yang\n\nSelf Sufficiency\n\nLove\n\nBenevolence\n\nUnderstanding\n\nCommunication Writing Editorial StateOfOpenSource\n\nOpenSource software continues to do well. It's like MicroPayments. Finally we have PayPal. But there were several attempts earlier to do micropayments. They all failed. It wasn't that micropayments were a bad idea, or that there was something fundamentally wrong with it; it was just that there wasn't enough infrastructure in place to provide for them. They jumped the gun. They saw too far with their intellect, but not far enough with their wallet. It's okay- these were good attempts. They probably seeded the public with much needed, good interest. I think it's the same with OpenSource software. I have a feeling that it's a bit pre-mature right now to say, \"OpenSource will take over the world.\" Actually, that's probably not premature; I think it's true. I think it's obviously true. OpenSource software is a lower energy state. It takes less energy to support it. Naturally, in an almost physical sense, it must be what we move to using. It's just not there yet. We need a lot of groupware and standard methods of working to be done. Studies, analysis, a lot of technology work has to be done before we get there. But get there we will. OpenSource software will be one of the greatest things to have hit the world, along with micropayments. It's like the invention of money.\n\nThe Japanese like Linux, too. =^_^= . o O ( Our secret ally. )\n\nArt Visual Drawing\n\nGetting the frames for human drawings is really hard work. I think, rather than getting a human subject to draw for me, which requires a lot of synchronization and is time consuming, it might be more useful to lift the designs from the \"How to Draw Anime & Manga Characters\" book.\n\nI think the reason the neck is frequently mistakenly drawn just immediately beneath the head, rather than back a little, is because we think \"Oh, the neck is under the head. I should draw it under the head.\" Which makes sense, except that the neck is sort of slanted away, generally speaking, from non-straight forward angles.\n\nTerminology\n\nUrban Science\n\nMostly trying make sense of the weird landscape we find ourselves in, and, with collaboration and repeatable experiments, figure out how to do some interesting and fun things with it all.\n\nUrban Chemistry\n\nAn idea of taking common household chemicals, figuring out how to reduce them to their elementary components, and recombine them in useful ways.\n\nBasically consider urban landscape to be a wasteland environment, and scavange up what we can.\n\nGames Companies * Economics\n\nThe company is a low energy state configuration of people. In a very real sense! The motivations in our life and what not are manifest through electrochemical reactions within our brains; In a very real sense, a relationship between people, either romantic or economic, is a chemical low-energy state.\n\nArt Story Warmth\n\nHow to write a useful, en-livening, warm, comic or other piece of written work: Identify something that you are nervous about, that worries you, or otherwise bothers you. Write a comic showing the situation from a higher perspective. I'm immediately thinking of Fujishima's Ah-Megamisama, in which Keichi is hired by the company on the basis of having dirt under his fingernails. The helps allays our fears about the world, that the job market it incredibly intense, and that people who are better at marketting themselves are the ones who will get the good jobs. We are bombarded with these fears day in and day out, and it sways us to behave in strange ways. These comics are really useful, and life-affirming. Takahashi.\n\nOne-Shot\n\nAt the end of all great people and things and powers is Name. Trace all the rivers to their source, and you find Name. In the opposite direction, there's nothing. It's like a fire in the middle of a very dark and dangerous jungle. The fire provides warmth and life for even the smallest dwellers of the jungle.\n\n\"Everything's Pre-School\" - Joseph Laureno, referring to how most good ideas and life comes from a pre-school childlike mentality. Specifically, we were talking about designing games by taking out the lego sets, drawing things on paper, and using dice, rather than building enormous engines and what not, and haggling over interfaces and rendering tools. Make it fun from the beginning when it's easy to build things, and then scale up, and everything should come out all right.\n\nPriority Life Style\n\nDie hair yellow, just for fun.\n\nPriority Life Catch\n\nGet a laptop to serve as my catch. Make sure I have a wacom with it.\n\nPriority Computers OS\n\nMake it so that when you get a handle to a file, you get much more than that. You also get events and what not from the system. Fro example: Read only toggled on a file? Youg et a message saying so.\n\nPriority LongTerm\n\nReturn to Mudd. Study lots. Also study business. You are going to start a school.\n\nPriority FledgingUnixProgrammers\n\nMake a kinetic book for the fledging unix prorgammers.\n\nImmediately, here are some things that you can write:\n\nArrays - Diagram out how they are layed out. Label the pieces of an array. (On a drawing) Identify types. Lay out some memory.\n\nPointers - Make the friendly packet for pointers, just like I learned from the old beautiful borland documentation..!\n\nMake the book on how to learn kinetic. Have people draw the elements of learning, and what not.\n\nI have a dream of books on all topics, from which it is easy to learn and study. Where people recognize that I have a dream of a study of education driven by the market, rather than the slow and sad progress of conflicting and fad funded psychologies. I have a dream of enlightened public schools where children can persue their interests and are encouraged to make a better world for one another; where they are not talked down to. Where students are not forced to learn something they don't want to (the \"UniBomber\" provision), where students learn to read and write because they recognize that they want to. These ideas can't be realized because of a myriad of reasons, but they are good ideals, I think.\n\nCommunication Education Books\n\nMake Kinetic Books. Each point should have understanding confirmed by leaving a space for the reader to write in a response, reply, draw a map, whatever. This is not unlike children's aeroplane books. People are active, and thinking/learning(constructing) is an active process!\n\nWays to improve books:\n\nProvide a Granger - this is Kinetic Engagement, it also provides higher utility as a customized book.\n\nProvide Kinetic Exercises such as maps to draw, things to fill in, etc., etc.,. - this is Kinetic Engagement\n\nProvide Pictures - Visual Engagement (High Bandwidth communication)\n\nCommunication Education Teaching\n\nCommunication Education Mechanics Kinetic\n\nCommunication Education Books\n\nI had three observations:\n\nTeacher just telling us stuff that was written in the book. (Ben Crowell used class time for discussion of book material, Wrote his own books to emphasises material over other material.)\n\nKinetic books are possible. They utilize writing on the readers part to ensure that understanding occurs. Creative (Constructivist, Constructionist) map making and utility.\n\nDocument writing at work- include all, like a reference or comprehensive work, or focus on just a few simple understandings. (Phil G. Lecture) \"If they must come away with something, what would that something be?\"... vs. the waterhose theory of education.\n\nI don't know that the \"teach them one skill\" approach, emphasised by Gerry Sussman and popularized by Philip Greenspun, applies so well towards Chemistry. Very kinetically oriented. Well, I suppose you could say, \"You should be able to calculate how much energy it takes to convert an ice cube at 250 K to steam at 400K.\" Yah, that's reasonable. And the concepts that you learn along the way- they would be tought. LEarning would happen. And the lecture would have focus.\n\nCategorization Catch\n\nI'm remembering when I was back in the Centenial Towers Apartment, and how I had diagrams on the wall that were quite nice and fun and interesting.\n\nThe current Catch is not faring so well- mostly scribbled notes, no order or what not.\n\nThe current catch functions very well as a categorization scheme, utilizing the tags and hierarchies, that is, as a collection of data, and it works well as a presentation of the collected data- I can see in 2 dimensions, the various pieces of data and their corrolations to other pieces of data (although there are a few wormholes/links between disparrate pieces). It's definitely been helpful (I noted the key conceptual links between communication and education, and games and governments).\n\nSuccesses:\n\ncollection of data - (categorization)\n\nrepresentation of data - (links between topics visible, though there are some wormholes)\n\nBut there have also been failures. Putting ideas together still takes too long (though it does work!- a definite improvement over before, when ideas were lost completely). I believe that a technical solution is ideal here. I will lose the nice 2d representation of data- this is *VERY* unfortunate, but I will gain better notes (I can type faster than I can write), they will be easily retrievable. I will lost pictures unless I have a wacom tablet attached to the picture, or scan in images (UG.). This is terrible. I'll probably need to hand scan a few.\n\nNow back to the walls: What to do with my surfaces? Scrawled notes have no sticktivity to my mind. They do not attract my attention, nor are they easily interpreted (hard to read, no pictures, etc.,.). I believe I need to take it all down, and then use it as I used it at the Centennial Towers: As a location for artistic expression, and visual maps of subjects and topics that I am learning. As the collage of learning.\n\nThis has three benefits:\n\nIt is fun. Art is nice to look at, and interesting. The fun factor is critically important: After all, if it isn't fun, what good is it?\n\nIt will attract my attention. It will be pretty.\n\nIt will help me find answers and memorize maps.\n\nThe number one loss is that relationships among subjects will not be as apparent as it was before. I'm not sure this will be lost as I convert the Catch to computer notes, though..!\n\nCommunication Education College\n\nPrinciples WhitsPrincipleOfEducation\n\nI question the educational values that our colleges are bringing us. They focus on teaching skills, rather than teaching thought.\n\nThey are bringing us people who know how to read text, apply it to solve simple problems, and follow the routine. I would call this teaching a skill. It is incredibly useful and important.\n\nBut it is not the whole story. When I'm in Chemistry, and they tell us that there are Redox reactions, Acid Base Reactions, and Precipitation Reactions. We're just told that. Well?! Are those all of them? Okay, so we have Comp./Displace/Decomp/Combustion(combustion? doesn't that seem rather non-orthogonal?) in there. Okay- why? What's going on here? Are there ever redox reactions that are also acid-base reactions? (Turns out: Yes). How's this: Maybe redox is transfering electrons, and maybe acid-base is transferring protons, and precipitation is doing neither. Okay, so that's kind of orthogonal; I feel like I've learned something, though I had to do all the thinking- the book gave no indication, and fellow students give the cold shoulder if you pester the teacher with your annoying questions. I cannot get a map of all reactions, or a compendium, or tools of the trade. When I ask about these things, the teacher either doesn't know, or doesn't have the time to teach me. Other students are annoyed by the questions. I'm just trying to make sense of what's going on. I'm astonished that so few others are. Most are begging for equations->grades->survival. <sigh> The system is set up for that.\n\nIs there anyone with a general knowledge of Chemistry, the profession, etc., etc., etc.,..? If so, why aren't these people teaching? Is duplicating quality information too expensive? Too little supply, even though there is a high demand? Or perhaps, there is neither supply, nor demand. That's likely, which is dissapointing to me. (Whit's Principle of Education: Lion, if people asked the kinds of questions you ask, the answers would be in the books...)\n\nRant Psychologists\n\nRant Women\n\nRant NewAge\n\nDon't you all ever stop healing? Don't you stop healing, when you're healed? With all the healing going on, you'd think that there'd be a healed person or two. Heal-> No sharp constonants in the word.\n\nRant Programming\n\nGoddamnit I hate all these m_'s and LongReallyLongJustSoYouKnow variable names all over the place. I can't tell what the fuck's going on in the flurry of over-non-informative-information..! Like I really wonder about whether or not begin_vel is a global variable or not, in the midst of a giant engine. Now I have to call it m_BeginVelocity, in order to match the rest of the style. Oh yeah, we REALLY needed that m_ because... IT MIGHT be a global variable..! What was once easy to understand and clear is now massive and uncomprehensible..! RRRRrr!\n\nStory InventionMethodology\n\nThoughts Life\n\nAn interesting way to write a story:\n\nThink about how you wish that you lived.\n\nWrite a story about a character living in such an arrangement. What does the character think in respons to various situations? How does the character react to various situations? What are the systems in the characters to handle or react to the situations? How does the character work?\n\nI recall Michael saying something similar to this; Did he say that it was futile to come up with an ideal response to every arrangement? Was it futile because it's a terrible effor in the first place, or due to the uniqueness of all people? Or, perhaps because these are mental ponderings, and simran knows nothing of them.\n\nPeople Ursula Le'Guin\n\nThoughts Books WizardOfEarthSea\n\nUrsula Le'Guin said: \"Listen\". But to what? Should I be listening to my mind, the news, simran, nature, everything, anything, WHAT? Just what should we be listening to? On what channels? Physical, emotional, causal, mental, intutive, the Voice of Love? Or perhaps the patterns of life? What? There are 9 wizards at Rokh, if I recall correctly.\n\nOne-Shot\n\n\"Shit; I don't know anything anymore...\" (Forgot where I heard that, or even if I heard it somewhere.)\n\nGames World GettingHired\n\nMost Important: What do you do, What are you interested in doing?\n\nThe 1st stage of employee selection is fairly random.\n\nThe 2nd stage of employee selection isn't random at all.\n\nSubmit repeatedly (1/month or 2/month) to places that you'd really like to go to, just so that you're in the \"recent\" part of the database.\n\nIf you carry on a conversation, it will enter the database. People will probably read it and you will be noticed.\n\nIf I had to teach someone about how to get hired, I'd show them the mass of resumes that a company receives, say, \"Which of these resumes is the company going to pull someone out from, knowing that they want someone who can do XY and Z and be happy doing it?\"\n\nI'd be sure to show the numerous shiny looking, but not necessarily interesting, resumes that temp agencies bring us, and discuss the tradeoffs (generally $5,000) that comes with hiring from the agencies.\n\nThen again, the agencies ARE really good about bringing us a lot of candidates. Generally it's easier when looking for a job to hook up with an agency, because you don't have to do a lot of work.\n\nCommunication Education Studentship\n\nLearning Studentship\n\nAs you are learning stuff, you will want to understand information deeper. This is right and good. If you are in a class though, you are not given time for deep comprehension; the class is pushing you along to give you a broad overview. (This is almost universally true. Deeper thought is almost always possible.) The purpose becomes to give you overview and certain key ideas, not depth and foundation. If you can wing on your own without a teacher and institution, you'll need to meet their grades. (Not to deter from winging on your own; I believe there is a time and place for each, and it's not necessarily what society tells us.) There will be a desire to learn deeply. This can lead to deeper reading. It is important to remember to do homework first, with minimal late-binding comprehension. THEN, after you are done establishing the key ideas that the teacher wanted you to get, you can dive in after deeper questions, and ask the teacher those questions. But get what the teacher wanted you to get FIRST. THEN go after deeper materials.\n\nComputers OpenSource\n\nWork OpenSource\n\nIn an opensource project, you need to seed locations with interest.\n\nIt can be far from perfect, and it can be incomplete, It just needs to be seeded. After that, things can/will(?) flower out.\n\nOne-Shot Life\n\nOne-Shot Seriousness\n\n\"Life's too important to be taken seriously.\" - author unknown to Lion\n\nPriority Catch\n\nWrite an entry about how the catch evolved.\n\nNotes on Pages, Folder Indexing\n\nNotes on Pages, NO INDEXING (oops)\n\nNotes on Pages, To the Wall\n\nTagging Up Notes, To the Wall\n\nTagging Up Notes, Into the Computer\n\nPriority FledgingUnixProgrammers\n\nChange name to \"Seattle Unix Learning\".\n\nPriority Computers Software\n\nCommunication Visualization 3D\n\nComputers Programming Editors 3D\n\nComputers Programming Emacs\n\nArt Comics BeanWorld\n\nArt Creativity\n\nComputers Programming Tools\n\nThought Creativity\n\nWrite \"Emacs3D\": A programmable 3D editing environment, using Lisp or Python.\n\nYou could make it so if you typed, \"heli\", you'd get a helicoptor view. If you type, \"persp\", you get a perspective view. \"worm\" for a worm view. Make it so that typing the names of common objects will make them appear.\n\nIf you want something to be yellow, you type, \"yellow.\" \"green\" for green, \"blue\" for blue, \"purple\" for purple, etc., etc., etc.,. We'll be getting a lot of bright colers, I guess then..!\n\nIt'd be a fun project, to make a pretty goofy 3D editor, but one that would allow you to creatively make all kinds of interesting shapes and things.\n\nThink Slats, Hoops, Tinks, and Chips.\n\nPriority Computers Databases Sounds\n\nPriority Computers RiverOfHope\n\nGames RiverOfHope\n\nWe need to make a database of free sounds; Sounds that are either public domain, or covered by some sort of free license.\n\nChallenges include:\n\nA sound quality rating system\n\nDeciding on a \"median\" volume\n\nArchiving formats and encoding details\n\nInitially, we should go for things such as footsteps, Doors opening and closing, etc., etc.,.\n\nThis can be rolled into the River Of Hope idea.\n\nLater note (May 1st, 2001): Someone's started one: http://www.adelaide.net.au/~xandrews/clangfx/index.html\n\nArt Story Idea Scene\n\nThis takes place in the far future. A professor is teaching some physics to a class of students. He says, \"And this is the Slagerforth Equation, from 1959.\" The class bursts into laughter, and the professor, with a \"Oh God, here we go again,\" look on his face, waits for the juvenile laughter to cease.\n\nPriority Life Letters\n\nLion, when you write letters to people, have fun with it. Write as if you were writing back from an expedition, or write as if you are in a dungeon or on the high seas. Be dramatic and fanciful and everything.\n\nThought Games\n\nGames Motivation\n\nIn a sort of modern day version of the Catholic \"If it hurts, It's good for you, if it feels good, It's bad for you,\" belief, people frequently believe that the sole reason why playing games is fun is because games are a distraction.\n\nI don't think that's the case at all. I can think of plenty of other distracting things that we could do besides playing games. For example, knitting. You could say that the reason people like knitting is because it keeps them \"distracted\".\n\nDistracted from what? From the basic pains of the world. Whatever you are \"supposed\" to be doing.\n\nI do think that it is common to use games as a way to distract ourselves from the world, but I don't think it is why games are fun/interesting.\n\nA model that might be useful is the model of chemical bonding. There are lower energy states, where the molecules like to be. You have to apply some sort of external energy to turn the bonds back into Joules (Energy/money), and then you can form something else.\n\nPlaying games can be a relatively low energy state; one that the mind prefers. Thus, by looking at games, we can look at the sorts of things that the mind likes- low energy states for minds.\n\nI'm not certain that this is a viable/valid description, but I do feel that it is a good description of *habits* and how they work.\n\nThoughts Progress\n\nThoughts WesternPhilosophy-Yang\n\nGovernments Progress\n\nI don't think it's so much that a focus on Progress is the only way to live. Rather, it only takes one culture to believe in progress in order to \"spoil the bag\". Indeed; I don't understand what's so bad about progress. I mean, if you think it's bad, then you'd like us to PROGRESS to a state of non-progress. I don't get it; maybe a better explanation of what you mean by \"progress\" would make it a little clearer to me.\n\nGames StarFlight\n\nGames Theory\n\nOne cool thing in StarFlight is that to win the game, you have to make a number of risky decisions.\n\nIn the game, you have places that are very safe- you can get lots of supplies, minerals, what not. You could practically live there forever, building up your strength, etc., etc., and what not.\n\nBut then you get this clue. This clue that says, \"If you go this way, to this place, and look around a bit, you will find something that will change the course of your life.\" (Or at least, this game, but, the game is so cool, it may as well change your life as well! The author has hidden some goodies for life within this game, which your mind is apt to find..!)\n\nYou look that way, and... All you see is DEATH and NOTHINGNESS.\n\nI mean, you look ANY which way, and all you see is your ass getting kicked. In your crew, you have some members of various races, and the people to the south don't like those people. You could get different people, but then the people to the north won't like them either! You look north east, and there's a bunch of robots ready to make mince meat of your ship if you answer one of their questions wrong. Southwest, there are aliens who don't even talk to you, all they want to do is turn you to scrap. To the west are fluxes which will throw you some random place in the universe.\n\nAll in all, it's not very pretty.\n\nUntil you get this note, and this note says: If you go to some system really really far away, so far you barely have fuel for it, and then if you go there and look around, you might find something cool.\n\nWell, you can stay, build up, and eventually be destroyed by solar flare, ...\n\nOr, you can gear up and undertake... ...what promises to be... ...a very... ...very... ...dangerous... ...Journey.\n\nAnd that's why StarFlight is so cool. =^_^=\n\nThere is this feeling of imminent mortality, There are \"safe\" places and \"very not safe\" places, and then clues, like in those games where you follow clue after clue after clue.\n\nAnd THAT's a hell of a lot of fun..!\n\nIt's very Leiji- the Leiji who did Galaxy Express 999 and Star Blazers.\n\nContrast with the Final Fantasy series- It's just WAY too safe. It's too easy just to stay in one place, build up, build up, build up, etc., etc.,. You're never in any danger; If in doubt, just build up.\n\nThus, there is no tension to the game. You just stay in one place, gaining strength. You fight monsters, but it's not scary. If they beat you, just buy more potions or something. There's no economy on potions, like there was on Endurium in Star Flight.\n\nAlso, in Star Flight, you could go anywhere.\n\nIn FF, you're directed to go here first, then there, then there, etc., etc.,.\n\nStarFlight managed to pull off a pretty nifty and involved story amidst the freedom to explore.\n\nOh, and in Star Flight, you never attain mastery over the world. Resources are finite. You have to choose your flights carefully. There's no point at which you have some much weapons and fuel that you are invincible. (Actually, is this true? I seem to remember doing rather well with 5th Class everything...)\n\nArt Story Idea\n\nA company appears and says that they will exchange $2 million for souls. For each person that signs a paper saying that they promise their eternal soul, the company will award $2 million dollars. People may buy their souls back for $3 million dollars.\n\nPeople of all types wonder, \"What is the trick?\" There are some violent reactions. People line up to sell their souls.\n\nArt Story Character\n\nA girl who treaters her ex-boyfriends extremely poorly. (Based on Brandy). When a boy comes to visit, the family informs him at the door, \"Oh, oh, we're so happy to see you, and we just want to tell you: Whatever happens, we Love you, and we are sure that you are very nice.\"\n\nArt Story Character\n\nA girl who can freeze time: The world around her.\n\nShe has a hard time relating with people some times, and once, she stopped time for a very long time, and was quite dissociated with the world when she finally unfroze it.\n\nShe knows quite a lot; she's read many books, and learned many things.\n\nStory Element Vehicles\n\nGames Vehicles\n\nVehicles are really important to stories. A lot of pride and care goes into vehicles, and it has a lot of symbolic meaning. Just think of the Grinch's sled, with all the lights on it, poking in all directions. Or the Explorer's sled. Or the Edelin. Or a sailors boat.\n\nThese vehicles are really important, and people have more pride in their synthetic bodies than their actual bodies..! (Since people had no say in how their body came out, but their vehicle represents their mind.)\n\nThe more customized the vehicle is, the better. The more it was built from the ground up, the more meaningful it is.\n\nIndeed, I would be surprised if you couldn't make a complete game solely around the construction of a vehicle.\n\nLeiji Matsumoto used the vehicle this way to now end, what with people merging into their vehicles, and the Queen Emeraldas (a spaceship). He had right vision. =^_^= A vehicle is an extension of a person- an exoskeleton that they wear, that means a lot to them.\n\nArt Story Question\n\nWhy do people read Mystery Books, Stories..? Why do we like them? What's going on there?\n\nThought SuratShabdaYoga\n\nPerson AlbertEinstein\n\nI think that the Western Surat Shabda Yoga paths are good. I think that the Eastern \"Thou Shalt Pay Attention Solely To Shabda, Thou Shalt Devote Attention to Naught Else\" can be really harmful, and is even western (in the negative sense) in Spirit- in that it is *not* holisitic, and it's a one-size-fits-all sort of deal.\n\nIn attaching metaphysics to the Surat Shabda Yoga, I think that Paul Twitchell did a good thing.\n\nI can draw a line: Eastern SSY paths devote entirely to Spirit but in an ungrounded way that does not concede any territory to the mind and the world around it, and Scientology on the right which pays attention almost entirely to thought forms and mental developments, byt pays almost no attention to the Spirit. (When it refers to the spirit, it does so in a very Mental way; It is a mental current, for the most part.)\n\nWe should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has powerful muscles, but no personality.\n\n-- Einstein\n\nI think Paul Twitchell did good work in paying attention to the world, but keeping the focus predominantly on the spirit. Give unto Ceaser that which is due Ceaser, Give unto God that which is due God.\n\nOn to the essence of the spirit vs. the mind: I think that it is true, as the eastern SSY paths will tell you, that the Shabda will in fact harmonize our lives and make everything bethat we do NOT need the mind in any degree for the Shabda to help us.\n\nBut I think that that teaching itself is a Mental form, and that it can be, and has been, abused, as is possible with all other mental forms. I think that mentality has been pushed aside so strongly, that communication along mental lines has been completely hampered, so as to obstruct the natural flow of the spirit..! Dislike the mental regions as the eastern SSY paths do, it is still a valid channel for the Shabda to take. To deny mental validity is just like the monk who hides himself from the world to find God. Any truth found thereof is a LIMITED truth- there is NOT a completion of the circuit of life.\n\nIn particular, I had a problem: My life was against the grain of the shabda, and whereas a simple mental realization of metaphysical nature (surely a Paul Twitchellian type of realization) could have alleviated muych pain, and provided inspiration and a return to the shabda, The teaching that we should rely wholey and solely on \"pure shabda\" has been a NEGATIVE and obstructing one.\n\nThe ability to provide new forms of life for ourselves, using the light of the mind, is important and right.

There were 5 levels to this amusement park in the astral plane. I went to the bottom level, because it was easiest. It was the world of sleep. It was very dark. There were two sections: The place where you land down (just remembered a dream I had many nights back, where I was in a city in the middle of a cast desert looking like the surface of mars, but sand colored, not red, and the city was a gigantic maze with little tribes living in it) from the elevator was the \"hospital section\", roughly rectangular in shape. There, in the back hall, adam and eve (or people dressed like them: kids) greet you and say hello. They challenge you to ask them a question; I asked something about the brotherhood/sisterhood of all peoplekind. After a while, I went to the challenge section: It was a dark garden with paths, but someone had placed string between various posts to make the relatively simple path into a rather complex maze; you just had to go with the fantasy that you aren't supposed to cross a string in order to play the maze. But there was a very real threat: A wind spirit. The wind spirit would chase you (you could see it some time because the wind rippled around and leaves flew up in the air and stuff) and try to strangle you, so you had to go through fast.\n\nAt the end of the \"maze\", there were a bunch of tall palm trees, and then you go on to this dock where there's a de-briefing boat and congradulations. (Remember, this is a sort of amusement park; an etherial strange amusement park, but an amusement park none the less.)\n\nBUT, if you climbed up the palm tree like Joel did, you could see that if you embarked on the boat, and then disembarked on the other side, there were all kinds of goodies (teddy bears and other plushes) - a secret zone..! We were going over there, but on the way, just before you enter a boat, there is a sort of tent, and I saw a (living) plush monkey scurrying about the tent, and I went up and caught it for myself.\n\nWeird Dream.\n\nGames MarioBrothers\n\nIt recently occured to me how much Mario Brothers is like pinball.

The goal is sort of to really impress these people, and, you know, they'll tell their friends, \"wOw! I saw this REALLY awesome web page- you gotta check it out!\"\n\nSo, they jelously guard any control that they can exhibit over their content. They want it to look on their clients browsers exactly like they envisioned it.\n\nWebTV and text browsers be damned- they aren't important! It's all about the multi-media CDROM Wonder!

Raymond Interview\n\nThought Action\n\nThought Interest\n\nMy current model for interest, motivation, getting stuff happening.\n\nI believe that it works like this. \"Interest\" is like this magical fairy dust. It sort of appears in this act of almost-not-quite mental effort. I would really rather call it an attitude adjustement, or a slight change in how we view things, or a perceptual adjustment. I believe that interest is really important. The way to open the doors to interest is to be absorbed in mystery and/or wonder. But anyways, back to the interest. Interest appears, and it appears like this fairy dust. (include picture here. Interest is *blue*/mental & *white*/spirit. Sort of etheric, probably.) When sufficient interest forms, it starts to gravitate together. Interest is like dust; it has this very very very faint gravitational pull to it. When a bunch of it's together, like a giant glob of Hydrogen (electrically neutral; 1 + 1 -) floating out in space, it collects together. It starts to compound together. The subject of our interests starts to appear in our mind now and then, like a very faint pattern or spider webs. Or like, there's a section of a room that is warm, verses another section of a room that is cold. If we then turn our attention to the interest some more, more and more of this fairy dust appears (probably stemming from the raw force of attention), and enough collects that it can turn into a stable mass. (Draw picture of collection, and place here.) Once it becomes a stable mass, it can start to do things. For example, if it gets large enough, it can make the jump from \"distraction\" status to habit. (I'm being fecetious about the distraction part; I believe that distractions are, overall, basically, very very good.) When it forms into a habit or an act of some sort, it can start to take on physical energy and mass, as you perform actions and make things. A certain amount of mental and physical rearranging occurs to help accomodate as well; This new mass that you've built in your brain starts to interact with all the other various massese in your brain/mind.\n\nThought Action InfoSeek\n\nI'm making up a term, \"InfoSeek Mode,\" to describe a state that people get in. In this state, I go looking around for information from various sources, and on myriad topics. Generally, it is a *distracted* state; One in which there is a predominant alternative thread (which I do *not* want to follow), and then several splintering off in all sorts of strange directions. These other directions twist and gnarl.\n\nThe end result is an alert and stressed person. You have to constantly have that predominant alternative thread in view, and say, \"Uh... No, don't want to go there... No, that' no good at all.\"\n\nNow, several things can happen here. The #1 people thing will say is, \"OH, you 'just' have to do that thing,\" and then they go on to not practice what they preach. Obviously, that's not the Way. Phil G. & Co. takes a view of looking at the mental obstacle, and rearranging the situation in light of the obstacle. (One thing I really like about Phil G.)\n\nOne thing that can happen is that we just naturally grow to a point where the obstacle isn't all that big compared to us, and it's surpassed. This may be best exhemplified by the \"Just stare at it for a while\" approach.\n\nOne thing that can happen is that we realize that the obstacle is there for a good reason, that we're trying to do something stupid, and go on to do something entirely else. (This solution has a bad rep, because in our Western society, we believe in THE RAMP and have a \"Just Get Better\" attitude; sad but true. We'd rather blow logs up that are in our path; the stronger TNT we can get, the better.)\n\nAnother thing that can happen is that as a deadline approaches, or some other external stimuli approaches, we hold our breath and jump in. (I generally haven't seen this to do too much for us as people though; and seems to be merely a short term solution; another favorite of our Western society.)\n\nI've said a lot of negative things about our Western society. Western society is great. It's good that we're going places. I don't think that Eastern complacency is at all the ideal state. I just thing that we're being way too Western. As Ursula Le Guin said, we're on a path that is too Yang. \"This is Taoism of the Duhhh variety.\"\n\nPossible causes: A stressful state itself can lead to InfoSeek. (But then is it really InfoSeek? The item of interest is the item that causes stress.) Having a boring task. Having a really difficult task.\n\nIt could be just a task that's too difficult. A better ramp-up schedule could be precicely what is needed.\n\nThought Motivation\n\nNAME->MYSTERY->INTEREST->LEARNING\n\nSURVIVAL->NEED->LEARNING\n\nComputers Programming Decyphering\n\nComputers Programming Analysis\n\nComputers Decyphering\n\nPrinciples:\n\nLook at functions, and turn them into pseudocode.\n\nLook at patterns and recurrances, and try to construct the larger picture.\n\nDon't work at memorizing the meaning of each piece of data, just try to get the basic scheme of things.

The program could pick up function signatures for you, and other such stuff.\n\nFunctions:\n\nFunction Signatures\n\nPseudocode Description\n\nEnglish Description\n\nDescribed in File\n\nHyperlinks appear wherever there is a function name.

You can hyperlink to it's place in the code.\n\nActually, I could easily conceive that there should be no code written that does not have an associated database. The associated database would describe how the code functions, include discussion amongst programmers about the code, any ICQ transcripts, etc., etc.,.\n\nRose from Rational Software\n\nC-web Literate Programming Knuth http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html http://www.literateprogramming.com/\n\nComputers Programming Debugging\n\nLife DifficultIssues\n\nWhen you find out a bug, look for other such instances of the bug; you've probably made it before as well.

I didn't add much to the project, but I *did* contribute, and it was worthwhile. Even that small bit added a lot to morale and development; he was so happy that someone had added, that he pretty much matched my effort in triplicate..!\n\nSo, I guess I would say: If you are complaining about people not helping one another, go help someone!\n\nRant Republicans\n\nSomeone said, \"What moral right does the government have to take my money away from me, and spend it how it pleases?\"\n\nThat's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

Or make it so that every object has a bool delete() function call, that is called at the end of each turn. If it replies \"true\", then it is deleted.\n\nThey are probably going to want to delete themselves at some point. The system needs to know that it can delete the object. That way, for an object to self destruct, it just sets its own \"self destruct\" flag, and then the engine will destroy it.\n\nThere should probably be a notification to observers as well that the destruction is occuring, so that they can react accordingly.\n\nPerhaps use this simple targetting system:\n\nA sim targets another sim, and sends it a \"TARGETTING\" message, with a link back to self.\n\nThe second sim's self-destruction component perks it's ears, and adds the targetter to a list.\n\nEventually, the targetee is destroyed. I looks through it's list of targeters,\n\nWhat if the targetter forgets about the targetee? It should send, \"TARGETTING_OFF\" to the targetee, and the targetee destructor component should remove the targeter from it's list.\n\nYou can play sounds and animations in response to target on and stuff like that. {;D}= Pretty cool.\n\nShoot... Augh! One more thing. You have to make sure that targetters exist before you send a message back to them, informing them that you no longer exist...

What I cannot easily do is say, \"7 > 3 AND 2.\" That is, it takes effort for me to draw the the data together, and to see it from the big picture.\n\nOne thing you could do if you want to trick someone, is to show them the metaphysical equivelent of 2 and 3, and then expouse the virtues of 2, knowing full well the advantages of 3 over 2.\n\nHowever, you can hold in your hand the *7*, and the person viewing the 2 and 3, unless they take care to hold a 7 in their hands (outside of the metaphor: in their thoughts), will be so happy to have distinguished their 3 from a 2, will be incapable of realizing that there may be a 5, a 7, or a 13, or whatever.\n\nCollecting the data together takes work.\n\nGames Economics OpenSource\n\nGames Economics Donations\n\nComputers Software Free\n\nCommunication Editorial Freshmeat\n\nI was thinking of writing an article for FreshMeat along the lines of, \"Let's all donate $10.00/week to our favorite OpenSource project, whether it's well known or not.

They pretty much follow the standard way of saying things.\n\nMy conclusion is that insane people are just people that talk. As in: If you got a sane person talking, you'd rapidly find that they were insane. And As in: If you got an insane person to shut up, you'd rapidly find that they were quite sane.\n\nOccasionally an insane person has ideas that went through the cycle of beinging ignored, then attacked, and then having their ideas taken as obvious. That kind of person, we call brilliant, if not insane for have insisting on the obvious.\n\nI think we all just need to talk more.

LISP has been doing just fine for decades without strong type.\n\nComputers Programming OOP Encapsulation\n\nComputers Programming Encapsulation\n\nComputers Programming OOP ButIsItDifferent?\n\nThe deep meaning of Encapsulation is this:\n\nFunctionality is organized, and each chunk of code, whether the chunk is an \"object\" or a component or a function or whatever, regardless, each chunk of code does just it's piece of functionality, and nothing else. Very minimalistic.\n\nHere is a well encapsulated ammunition box: When a player or creature touches the ammo box, it replies with, \"I provide ammo.\" Then, the creature or player respond with \"I'll take it.\" (If the thing that touched it was not interested in ammo,the thing that touched has deaf ears to the ammo box.) When the ammo box receives, \"I'll take it,\" it replies with, \"Here you go,\" and turns itself off, or something like that.\n\nHere is a poorly encapsulated ammo box: Something touches the ammo box, and the ammo box checks to see if the thing that touched it was a creature or a monster. If it was, then it tells the creature or monster that they have ammo. What is gained in speed is lost in organization and flexibility. Code that allows creatures to pick up ammo should obey principles of encapsulation and appear in the creature's code, not in the ammo boxe's code. This example \"breaks encapsulation\" when the ammo box \"knows about\" things called creatures and players.\n\nEncapsulation is generally bad for performance and good for abstraction.\n\nFor example, lets say I have an ammo box. When it's touched,\n\nThe two weaker senses of encapsulation follow:\n\nCode and Functions are bundled together.\n\nPrivate, Protected, and Public access levels are assigned to code, and various compiler errors will arise if access is not granted for particular code.\n\nThus, we have 3 meanings to the word \"encapsulation\":\n\nCategorized Code with Minimalist Scope\n\nThe Bundling of Code and Functions\n\nCode with levels of access rights (ex: public, protected, private).\n\n(Later note: I was talking with someone and found a 4th differentiation; but I've forgotten what it was...)\n\nGenerally, if you read a book about object oriented programming, you'll get the 2nd or the 3rd definitions.\n\nBut the deep meaning of the word \"Encapsulation\" comes from definition 1, and transcends object oriented programming.\n\nYet another meaning of the word encapsulation: The state of code that has been \"Interfaced Off\". That is, functionality has been put into a function or an object, and then has been given an interface, so that you don't have to think about how it works.\n\n4 Definitions!\n\nDo \"Interface\", \"Interfaced Off\", and \"Encapsulation\" need entries in the Hacker's Dictionary? I suppose so (They aren't in there today: Wed Jan 17 14:36:54 PST 2001). No. They don't; They are defined, albeit poorly, in computer science literature, and thus don't have a place in the New Hacker's Dictionary.\n\nLater note Mon May 7 17:58:12 PDT 2001: COHESION is the complementary force of COUPLING. Strong Cohesion is the deep meaning of encapsulation. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics121-SQ99/lecture/seven/tsld014.htm\n\nI was working on code with a linked list, and a count. As you added things to the linked list, you were supposed to increment the count. As you removed things from the linked list, you were supposed to decrement the count. No naming overlap existed between the count and the linked list; you could not tell that they were directly related. If you added to the list w/o changing the count, you got a crash later on. This was an example of poor encapsulation: We want the count to increase whenever you add to the list. Turn the add/remove into a function call. When you want to add an element, call the function. When you want to remove an element, call another function. The function will encapsulate the connected functionality. There will be a strong cohesion. I learned the word \"Cohesion\" from a book on \"Structured Design\". Structured Design seems to be the 70's/80's word for what is now called Object Oriented Programming. The name for \"programming well\" just keeps on turning...\n\n\"In this paper, we have shown that the cohesion of a class or an object can be described in terms of classical (module-based) cohesion taxonomies, and similarly for the coupling between classes and objects. There can be no category of cohesion or coupling that is specific to the object-oriented paradigm. Accordingly, it makes little sense to talk about object-oriented cohesion or object-oriented coupling unless it is made clear that what is meant is the application of classical cohesion and coupling to the object-oriented domain.\n\nThe results are special cases of a result regarding metrics in general: When inheritance is not involved, the metric is always a classical metric that has been applied to the object-oriented domain. Furthermore, even when inheritance is involved, the metric may still correspond to a classical one. The use of metrics in the object-oriented paradigm is no less vital than in the classical paradigms. Most of the metrics used in conjunction with the object-oriented paradigm are, in fact, classical metrics. There is nothing wrong with this, provided we acknowledge that they are classical; claiming that classical metrics are object-oriented is, at best, a cause of confusion.\n\n-- A classical view of object-oriented cohesion and coupling Aaron B.

The Wizard of Speed and Time included one.\n\nCommunication Education Exercises\n\nCommunication Education ProblemSets\n\nIf you had enough money, it'd be interest to incent students by giving money to the first person to solve a given problem.\n\nThought MetaThought\n\nScattered..?\n\nCategorization TheCatch\n\nHow we solve problems.\n\nThis is basically what I was teaching my students about how to construct algorithms, and I think it's true for much more than constructing algorithms; I'd very well say it's how we construct ALL our thoughts, and even our lives!\n\nIt's like those Wave Patterns that come out when you release electrons one at a time through a dual slit, or whatever. The pieces appear one at a time, but distant from one another. Then they collect together, and a complete focused image appears. This happens for stories, it happens for programming, and I dare say it's probably how the Enlightenment and Realization of The Eternal God will happen as well, whenever God blesses us to meet Him. (I could be wrong; this could be a merely mental conception of the God-realization experience.)\n\nWe don't work linearly, and we shouldn't *TRY* to make ourselves work linearly. This very catch (this doc) itself is a nonlinear, but progressive, work in progress.\n\nWe should harness our non-linearity, and work with it, rather than trying to cram ourselves into the pants of discipline.\n\nMath Quaternions\n\nQuaternions are also called Hamilton #s because Rowan Hamilton discovered them. They extend the complex numbers.\n\nQuaternions consist of 4 components:\n\n1\n\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\nq = w + xi + yj + zk\n\nThey add like vectors. They multiply like polynomials. 1's, i's, j's, and k's interconvert according to the following rules:\n\ni*i=j*j=k*k=-1\n\ni*j*k=-1\n\nYou can fill out a complete Cayley Diagram based on that. Note that quaternions don't commute. ij != ji.\n\nQuaternions avoid \"Gimbal Lock\".\n\nWhat is Gimbal Lock and Why Does It Occur?\n\nQuaternion Powers\n\nGimbal Angles, Gimbal Lock, and a Fourth Gimbal for Christmas\n\nAngle Axis Representation- You give an XYZ unit vector, to describe an axis, and then give an angle that rotates about that axis. One motion, to fit all your rotation needs..! (I read that this causes a rough interpolation? Not sure I understand why...)\n\n???\n\nJournal Sun Jan 14 18:51:56 PST 2001\n\nArt Comics Games OurPrincessIsInAnotherCastle\n\nGames Comics\n\nArt Story Mechanics\n\nSmall stories might be pleasurable because they are so limited in scope, like games. There is a closure to them..?\n\nPeople PhilipGreenspun\n\nCommunication WhatILikeAboutPhilG\n\nCommunication Tone Artifice\n\nWhat I like about Philip Greenspun is that he doesn't resort to high-language to weild authority, and prove that he knows what he is talking about.\n\nRather, he speaks directly from experience.\n\nA lot of times, he gets on people's nerves. He's not very diplomatic to the readers state of mind. This has good aspects, and bad aspects. The good aspects are that he gets his point across clearly and rapidly. The bad aspect is that people who disagree feel insulted.\n\nBut they shouldn't disagree. Because he's right. (There's no shame in being wrong.)\n\nPersonally, I like his writing style a lot.\n\nHe's a smart cookie. Whatever he has that's so special, I wish he'd tell me what it is, and I wish I had it.\n\nArt\n\nVice Prejudice\n\nCommunication SocialUnderstanding\n\nWhat do you think is the place of intellectual gathering places such as universities in the gay-rights movement? -- Marian Chen, March 17, 1997 Answers First, I don't think we can take for granted that a university is an intellectual gathering place. We have students who come for a credential so that they can get a job (Business and Economics are the most common majors these days, not English and Philosophy). We have professors who publish in journals that nobody reads just so that they can pad out their vitae and get tenure. We have administrators hiring sub-assistants and milking the students, parents, and destitute PhDs. Not that I'm cynical.... Second, I'm not sure that we can assume that intellectuals will make significant contributions to the gay rights movement. I personally believe that prejudice stems from lack of understanding others' experiences. I can't understand what it is like to be gay from reading a Harvard sociologist's paper. I can only understand it by reading literature. It is the poet, not the professor, who is going to educate me about the reality of being gay. (Remember the famous poet who asked \"What's the difference between an ape and a professor of English Literature?\" (the professor of English Literature thinks that he can write poetry).) If we accept that only art can give people an insight into experiences that they haven't personally had then it is Hollywood more than Harvard and the starving Bohemian authors of Greenwich Village more than the complacent tenured faculty who will play a significant role in the gay rights movement. -- Philip Greenspun, March 18, 1997\n\nPriority\n\nQuestion\n\nTell Philip Greenspun that I am teaching Fledging Unix Programmers. Tell him that I am currently a computer programmer. That I am attending college. That I want to teach full time. Should I hire on with someone else that teaches (such as RedHat), or should I open a school of my own. I am not a business expert; Should I become one?\n\nComputers UserInterface\n\nIt would be cool if, generally, wherever a filename is written to the screen, you could click on it and be taken to the file, local or remote. This requires some meta-information be provided, so that not every word is considered to be a file name.\n\nCommunication Editorial Freshmeat\n\nComputers Programming Architecture\n\nPublish all my loopy ideas under the title, \"BAD\": Bizarre Architecture Docs.\n\nThen I can write for FreshMeat without shame.\n\nStory Idea Scene\n\nPlane Causal\n\nCharacters must visit the world constructor in the Causal Plane. 2 minute trance/psychadelic sequence, Dr. Who music, as approaching the Lord of the Causal Realm. Exchange occurs, and then the characters leave as the universe they saw dissolves.\n\nIt's a show, or a story... It is an experiental thing. Treat the story as a story that people listen to, We're not aiming for apparent realism, we're aiming for the realism of experience. A simulation, not just a plot.\n\nPriority\n\nComputers Programming Python\n\nFledgingUnixProgrammers\n\nUse the Python Imaging Library to make some simple sprite stuff for the class. I think they'd get a kick out of that.\n\nPython Imaging Library for Windows\n\nComputers Programming Attitude\n\nChase down interesting stuff and nail it.\n\nI was working on this project, and all the bugs and stuff were bothering me. I didn't like not understanding how the layers below me worked. \"Oh, don't go down there; that's not the place you are paid to be.\" So, I'd sort of meander at the top levels.\n\nThen one day, I grabbed a bug and tracked it down, day and night. (Actually, for about 5 hours.) It was exhilerating. \"Too hell with what I'm paid to do, I'm tired of moping. I want to fix this!\" I dove in...\n\nHours later, I came out, having fixed a fairly huge bug, that had been causing several other problems as well..!\n\nI'm wondering if I should devote myself to improving the object architecture, rather than working on GameObjects...\n\nGUARANTEED to be appreciated by all users of LithTech.\n\nGUARANTEED to be successful...\n\nHmm... I'm going to think about this...\n\nCommunication Story Idea\n\nArt Story Idea\n\nCommunicate how we see structures as we program. A boy dreams, and find himself inside a programmers vision of debugging a program. (He's investigating an enormous file tree, or something like that.)\n\nGames BushidoBlade\n\nGames Mechanics Danger\n\nBushido Blade's fighting system was set apart and defined, more than anything else, by the absence of life bars, of any measured progression towards victory or defeat, or any quantitative indication of who had the advantage. When one of you fell to the ground and stopped moving, you knew who was winning. That was what made the game realistic, individual, and interesting, since one stroke could win the fight, one mistake could lose it, and any disadvantage could be overcome with one desperate attack. --IGN reviewer of KenGo\n\nGreat description. {;D}= So great, it looks like they've taken it off the record..!\n\nThought SuratShabdaYoga\n\nThought Philosophy IAM\n\nThought Mind\n\nThere is a great article called Flow with Tao which is good because it explains the I AM very clearly. It also unites several practices together, explaining how they are various manifestations of the true light of Mind.\n\nThe mind is like a hollow shell. It is empty and lifeless. The author has cleared the mind, and seen it for what it is, the everchanging kalediascope of states of mind that is our world, but I believe that he has confused his life with the mind.\n\nThe Eternal Spirit, or the Eternal Tao, is to be focused on next, as it leads outside of the mind, and even outside the center of the mind.\n\nThe way to follow the Tao beyond the mind is not through more realization of mind, but through following the Soun"
