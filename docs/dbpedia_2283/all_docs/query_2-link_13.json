        "text": "About St. Anne\n\nTradition holds that St. Anne, or Ann, is the mother of the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus. There is no mention of Anne in the bible. Non-biblical books from the early Christian centuries acknowledge Mary’s parents as Joachim and Anne. These sources claim that Joachim and Anne were childless for many years of their marriage. The angel Gabriel appeared to them separately and declared that they would in fact bear a child who must be dedicated to God. Hence, Anne became the mother of our Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nMade universal by Pope Gregory XIII, the church celebrates her feast day along with Joachim, on July 26th. St. Anne, Hebrew for Hannah, meaning “grace”, eventually became the patron saint of married women and childless couples. Artistic representations show St. Anne with her child Mary on her lap holding Christ Jesus.\n\nShop St. Anne Medals and Rosaries\n\nAs the woman chosen by God to be the Mother of His Son, the Virgin Mary is known around the world as a good, holy, and exceptional woman. Certainly she must have had extraordinary parents whose example of faith and trust in the Lord impacted her in a way that would change the course of history forever! These parents, named Joachim and Anne, have been honored throughout the ages for their dedication to raising their daughter, Mary, to be a woman fully devoted to God.\n\nThere is very little known about the parents of the Virgin Mary. St. Anne and St. Joachim are not mentioned in the canonical gospels; however, their story has been told in a document known as the “Gospel of James.” This document is not to be read for its’ historical or factual accuracy, nor is it the inspired Word of God (which is why it is not included in the bible). Yet, the legend included in this document that tells of St. Anne and St. Joachim is the first mention of Mary’s parents and has been a catalyst for Christians to honor and celebrate Mary’s parents. Whether the names and dates in the “Gospel of James” about St. Anne and St. Joachim are correct or not is unimportant, for instead, we should look to the truth that we do know: that the Virgin Mary was born of a man and woman who raised her in a way that brought glory to God.\n\nSt. Anne is often depicted as a seated woman with a book upon her lap and the child Mary leaning against her, eager to learn. This image tells us what we know of St. Anne, as well as the reason St. Anne is honored to this day. St. Anne had a unique position in which God entrusted to her the task of bringing up Our Lady in a holy and virtuous way. While teaching Mary to cook, take care of her home, and look after her family and neighbors, St. Anne modeled for the Virgin Mary a life of prayer, love, and humility. In doing so, St. Anne prepared Our Lady to receive Our Lord not only into her heart, but into her very body, becoming the Mother of God.\n\nOn December 8, Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. This teaching has been a belief held by Catholics for ages; however, it became official dogma in 1854 by Pope Pius XI. On this day, Catholics recognize that the Virgin Mary was conceived in the womb of St. Anne free from original sin. This prepared her as a pure and holy vessel to become the Mother of God.\n\nInformation about St. Anne’s death has been lost to history. She has been honored as a saint from the days of early Christianity, and her relics have been the cause for pilgrimage in several countries. They were brought to Constantinople in 710 and remained there until 1330, when they were relocated to several places, including Apt, Ghent, Provence, and Chartres. In 1506, Pope Julius II declared that St. Anne’s relics would stay in Duren, Germany. Also, there are small relics that are located at various churches and monasteries throughout the world that have placed themselves under her patronage.\n\nShop St. Ann Medals and Rosaries\n\nPatronage of St. Anne\n\nSt. Anne is the patron saint of unmarried women, housewives, women in labor, grandmothers, childless people, equestrians, lacemakers, miners, the poor, and seamstresses. The most well-known patronage of St. Anne is that of grandmothers. Certainly as the mother of the Virgin Mary and the grandmother of Jesus Christ, St. Anne was a woman of great virtue and love.\n\nSt. Anne in Art\n\nSt. Anne is often shown seated with a book on her lap. The child Mary stands against her, eager to listen. This depiction of St. Anne is a small explanation of what we know of this holy woman. God entrusted to St. Anne the task of raising Our Lady in a holy and virtuous home, and from a very young age Mary looked to St. Anne to learn about God and how He works in the lives of those who love and serve Him.\n\nPrayers of St. Anne\n\nLet Saint Anne be your partner in prayer as you say one of the prayers below or as part of your rosary devotion.

Pray that we may enjoy a long life together and after our death be united again for all eternity in the Kingdom of Heaven. Amen.\n\nSt. Anne, Bless Our Families\n\nSt. Anne, like all grandmothers, you care for your grandchildren. You are concerned for the happiness of all families. You know our joys; you accept our pain and suffering; you support and encourage our endeavors, and you comfort our hearts. With all the uncertainty and anguish that weigh down upon our world, you do not abandon us. With your blessing, we grandmothers will continue the mission of your grandson, Jesus. As we begin this third millennium, remind us that the future of our world lies in the path of love. Help us to foster the good values in life and to avoid all that may be harmful to our families. St. Anne, please gather all your children, young and old, to work together in building a world of justice and peace. Amen."
