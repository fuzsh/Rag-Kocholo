        "text": "A tabular register of the days in a year, usually arranged by month and within each month by week, sometimes indicating the dates of important events such as national and religious holidays. To learn about the history of calendars, see Calendars through the Ages. Also, an almanac listing days of the year significant to a particular culture or political entity. The calendar of forthcoming library events, provided in Library and Book Trade Almanac, includes state, regional, national, and international association meetings. Compare with chronology. See also: calendar year and perpetual calendar.\n\nIn medieval manuscripts used in Church services and private devotion, a calendar section often preceded the text, identifying the feast days celebrated in the region. The most important were highlighted in red ink (\"red letter days\") with other colors used to indicate degrees of importance. The Julian calendar (365 days with an extra day every four years) was adopted from the Romans, but the Roman civil year (beginning on January 1) was replaced by the Christian year in the 7th century. Click here to page through the liturgical calendar in the Burnet Psalter (University of Aberdeen Library, AUL MS 25), and here to see the complete calendar from a 15th-century book of computus texts (Celebrating the Liturgy's Books). Other examples can be seen in the SchÃ¸yen Collection (Oslo and London). The illumination of medieval calendars often depicted the labors of the month (largely agrarian) and the signs of the zodiac (see Les trÃ¨s riches heures du Duc de Berry, courtesy of WebMuseum). For an early printed calendar, see this example published in Venice in 1482 by Erhard Ratdolt (Special Collections, Glasgow University Library, Euing BD7-f.13).\n\nAlso refers to a chronological list of the documents included in an archival collection (rolls, charters, state papers, etc.), usually annotated to indicate the date, place, contents, and other characteristics of each item--a type of finding aid that can be comprehensive or selective.\n\nA unique code printed on a label affixed to the outside of an item in a library collection, usually to the lower spine of a book or videocassette (see these examples), also printed or handwritten on a label inside the item. Assigned by the cataloger, the call number is also displayed in the bibliographic record that represents the item in the library catalog, to identify the specific copy of the work and give its relative location on the shelf.\n\nIn most collections, a call number is composed of a classification number followed by additional notation to make the call number unique. This gives a classified arrangement to the library shelves that facilitates browsing. Generally, the class number is followed by an author mark to distinguish the work from others of the same class, followed by a work mark to distinguish the title from other works of the same class by the same author, and sometimes other information such as publication date, volume number, copy number, and location symbol.\n\nIn Library of Congress Classification (LCC), used by most academic and research libraries in the United States, class notation begins with letters of the English alphabet (example: PN 2035.H336 1991). In Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), used by most public and school libraries in the United States, class notation consists of arabic numerals (example: 480.0924 W3). U.S. federal government documents are assigned SuDocs numbers (example: L 2.2:M 76).\n\nAn early photographic process patented in 1841 by William Henry Fox Talbot, who found that by treating high-quality writing paper with light-sensitive chemicals and exposing it to light in a camera, a latent image resulted from which prints could be developed on similarly treated paper. Strictly speaking, the term \"calotype\" refers only to the paper negative from which positive prints were made on salted paper. Because the negative was embedded in the paper, rather than on a surface coating, the texture of the fibers and any imperfections in the paper tended to make the prints appear mottled or sketchy (see this example).\n\nAccording to Robert Leggat (A History of Photography, 1999), the calotype was not as popular as the daguerreotype due to patent restrictions and because the materials used were not as sensitive to light, requiring longer exposures. The two-step process took longer and the prints tended to fade. However, the process had significant advantages over the daguerreotype: (1) retouching could be done on either the negative or the print, (2) multiple prints could be made from a single negative, (3) paper prints were easier to examine and handle, and (4) the tones of a calotype were warmer. Introduction of the collodion process and albumen prints in 1851 made the calotype obsolete, but the negative-positive process invented by Talbot has become the standard in modern photography. Click here to see other examples, courtesy of the Getty Museum. Click here to learn more about the calotype process (Special Collections, Glasgow University Library). Synonymous with Talbotype.\n\nFrom the Latin word for \"capture\" or \"seizure.\" A brief title, explanation, or description appearing immediately above, beneath, or adjacent to an illustration or photograph on a page, sometimes indicating the source of the image. Synonymous in this sense with cut line or legend. See also: overleaf.\n\nIn cartoons, the line of text printed at the foot of the illustration, indicating the humor in the image (see this example). The New Yorker magazine sponsors a weekly cartoon caption contest.\n\nAlso refers to a heading printed at the beginning of a chapter or other section of a book and to the headline at the beginning of the text of a periodical article or section of it. See also: hanging caption.\n\nIn microforms, a title or brief line of description in a type size large enough to enable the viewer to identify the photographed document without the aid of magnification. In films and filmstrips, a line of text at the bottom of a frame or sequence of frames identifying or explaining the content. A continuously moving line of text at the bottom of television screen is called a crawl. Compare with subtitle. See also: closed caption.\n\nThe first Latin script to introduce small letters, Carolingian minuscule may have evolved from Luxeuil minuscule, a script developed at the monastery in Corbie in France. It was adopted in the late 8th century by Alcuin of York, Abbot of St. Martin at Tours, in response to Charlemagne's desire for a standard alphabet in which books of the Catholic Church could be copied throughout his realm. Also influenced by English half uncials, the script Alcuin learned in his youth at the cathedral school in York, Carolingian minuscule quickly became the dominant book hand in Europe, where it was used through the 11th century and adopted in England following the Norman Conquest, replacing Insular and Anglo-Saxon scripts.\n\nIts letterforms are wide and curved, with ligatures sparingly used, each letter written separately. Carolingian style systematized punctuation and the division of text formerly written in scriptio continuo into words and sentences. The practice of beginning each sentence with a single majuscule and completing it in minuscules was also standardized. Marc Drogin notes in Medieval Calligraphy: Its History and Technique (Allanheld & Schram, 1980) that the development of Carolingian minuscule made possible the copying of thousands of early manuscripts that would otherwise have been lost to history. Interest in Carolingian minuscule revived in the late 14th century in Italy, resulting in a humanistic script that became the basis for the lowercase letters of many modern typefaces. Click here to see a page from the 12th-century Italian Life of Mathilda of Canossa written in Carolingian minuscule (Library of the Medieval Institute, University of Notre Dame), and here to see more examples from the SchÃ¸yen Collection (Oslo and London). Synonymous with Caroline minuscule.\n\nA symbolic or representational drawing in one or more panels intended to caricature a person or institution or to satirize, with wit and imagination, an action, event, or situation of current popular interest. Usually published in a newspaper or magazine, cartoons may be captioned or contain monologue or dialogue in balloons. Political cartoons usually appear on or near the editorial page of a newspaper. Successful cartoonists are often syndicated. For examples, see Herblock's History and Oliphant's Anthem, two online exhibitions of political cartoons provided by the Library of Congress. See also the Cartoon Library and Museum at Ohio State University and the Center for Cartoon Studies in Vermont. A searchable database of New Yorker cartoons is available at Cartoonbank.com. See also: comic book, lampoon, and manga.\n\nAlso refers to an animated film created by photographing a series of drawings done as individual cels, then editing the images into a sequence of frames which, when viewed in rapid succession, create the illusion of continuous motion. To locate commercially produced cartoons, try The Big Cartoon Database.\n\nIn art, a full-size preparatory drawing done on paper as a working draft for transfer (sometimes in sections) to the surface of a fresco, tapestry, stained glass window, or other large work.\n\nA frame or panel, often in the form of a scroll, drawn or printed on a map or chart, usually as an inset, enclosing the title or subject of the work, name of cartographer, scale, and other descriptive information (legends). On older maps, the cartouche often includes decorative elements, ranging from simple ornamentation to elaborate embellishment. The presence of a coat of arms signified land ownership. Click here to see an example on a 17th-century map of Pennsylvania (Library of Congress). Click here to see a cartouche in the form of a medallion, and here and here to see draped examples (University of Wisconsin, Green Bay). Some decorative cartouches are very elaborate (University of Southern Maine). To see other examples, try a keywords search on the terms \"cartouche and map\" in Google Images. Also found on engravings and older bookbindings.\n\nIn a more general sense, a decorative element in the form of a scroll, often used in the Islamic decorative arts (click here to see cartouches used in the border of an 18th-century Turkish illuminated manuscript, courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art).\n\nIn Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions, a group of characters representing a divine or royal name or title, enclosed in an oval or oblong frame, often identifying a figure in a painting or sculpture. Click here to see examples carved in stone at Luxor, here to see examples in painted relief, and here to see a cartouche included in a jeweled pectoral (Metropolitan Museum of Art).\n\nA completely enclosed physical housing, usually made of hard plastic or metal, designed to store and facilitate access to a roll of film or tape, usually wound on a single core, for example, a light-tight, factory-loaded roll of photographic film designed to be placed in and removed from a camera in full daylight without risk of accidental exposure. A cartridge is distinct from a container in being integral to, rather than separable from, the item. Cartridges may be constructed with the recording medium in a continuous loop. Some libraries use cartridge microfilm in which the ends of a length of film are permanently attached to two take-up reels for playback and rewinding. Compare with cassette.\n\nIn computing, a removable electronic storage medium (disk, memory chip, magnetic tape, etc.), as opposed to a medium that is not removable, for example, a hard disk. Some computer printers are made with slots into which font cartridges can be inserted to load a variety of fonts. By extension, any self-contained removable module used in computing equipment, for example, the toner and ink cartridges commonly used to resupply laser and ink-jet printers.\n\nAlso, a removable electro-acoustic transducer, usually encased in hard plastic, designed to hold the needle in the arm of a phonograph record player. Click here to learn how a phonograph cartridge works, courtesy of MicroPhone Solutions.\n\nIn machine binding, a cover made completely before it is attached to the body of a book, consisting of two boards and a paper inlay covered in book cloth or some other protective material (see this diagram). The edition binder submits a specimen case to the publisher for approval showing the size, boards, covering, lettering, and squares. The process of attaching the case to the text block by pasting down the endpapers is called casing-in (see this result). See also: case binding and recased.\n\nAlso refers to a container used by a typesetter to hold movable type. The words uppercase and lowercase are derived from the relative positions of the compartments used to store the two kinds of type (see this example).\n\nAlso, a small, flat container hinged to open like a book, in which one or two daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, or tintypes were preserved, allowing them to be carried conveniently and safely. Early examples were made of wood covered in leather or cloth, often decorated on the outside, with fabric lining and metal hinges and fasteners. The photograph(s) fitted snugly into the rear of the front and/or back half of the case, protected under a sheet of glass and a brass mat. Thermo-plastic began to replace leather in 1854. Click here to see two closed examples, courtesy of Lost & Found: Rediscovering Early Photographic Processes, an online exhibition hosted by the University of Southern California. Click here to see one open (Metropolitan Museum of Art). Similar cases were used to protect portrait miniatures during the medieval period.\n\nAlso refers to a small, flat plastic container, hinged to open like a book, in which media items, such as VHS tapes and DVDs, are stored (see this example). A clear plastic case for storing CDs and CD-ROMs is called a jewel case (example). Locking cases are available to protect media against theft.\n\nA comprehensive list of the books, periodicals, maps, and other materials in a given collection, arranged in systematic order to facilitate retrieval (usually alphabetically by author, title, and/or subject). In most modern libraries, the card catalog has been converted to machine-readable bibliographic records and is available online. The purpose of a library catalog, as stated by Charles C. Cutter in Rules for a Dictionary Catalog (1904), later modified by Bohdan S. Wynar in Introduction to Cataloging and Classification (8th ed., 1992), is to offer the user a variety of approaches or access points to the information contained in the collection:\n\nObjects:\n\n1. To enable a person to find any work, whether issued in print or in nonprint format, when one of the following is known:\n\na. The author\n\nb. The title\n\nc. The subject\n\n2. To show what the library has\n\nd. By a given author\n\ne. On a given and related subjects\n\nf. In a given kind of literature\n\n3. To assist in the choice of a work\n\ng. As to the bibliographic edition\n\nh. As to its character (literary or topical)\n\nThe preparation of entries for a library catalog (called cataloging) is performed by a librarian known as a cataloger. British spelling is catalogue. Abbreviated cat. Compare with bibliography and index. See also: classified catalog, dictionary catalog, divided catalog, and online catalog.\n\nIn a more general sense, an enumeration of items systematically arranged for a specific purpose, usually with brief descriptive information included in each entry, for example, an exhibition catalog, auction catalog, catalogue raisonnÃ©, course catalog, publisher's catalog, or film rental catalog. Sales catalogs are often heavily illustrated (see these examples, courtesy of the University of Delaware Library).\n\nA word or part of a word printed in boldface or uppercase at the top of a column or page in a dictionary or encyclopedia that repeats the first and/or last heading appearing in the column or on the page. Synonymous with guideword. Compare in this sense with catch letters.\n\nIn medieval manuscripts and early printed books, a word or part of a word appearing in the lower margin of the last page of a quire that duplicates the first word on the first page of the following quire, enabling the binder to assemble the gatherings in correct sequence. In hand-copied books, the sequence of catchwords is unique to a specific copy. Michelle Brown notes in Understanding Medieval Manuscripts (Getty Museum/British Library, 1994) that the practice was probably introduced into Europe by the Moors. Click here to see an examples in a 14th-century English psalter (British Library, Harley 2888), Columbia University), and here to see a decorated example in a late 14th-century Book of Hours (Syracuse University Library). Click here to see catchwords in a printed book, courtesy of the University of Pittsburgh Libraries.\n\nAlso refers to a word or phrase repeated so frequently that it has become a motto or slogan. Compare in this sense with clichÃ©.\n\nAn official count and statistical analysis of the living population of a species (human or nonhuman) in a given geographic area (city, county, state, province, country, etc.) taken at a particular point in time. A census is distinct from a sampling in which information obtained about a portion of a population is used as the basis for generalization about the whole. The earliest known census of taxpaying households was recorded in China in the 3rd century B.C. More complete enumerations were conducted for military and tax purposes in ancient Rome by special magistrates called censors. The development of the modern census began in Europe in the 17th century and today includes questions concerning age, gender, ethnicity, income, housing, etc., formulated to generate data used in social planning, political redistricting, business marketing, etc. In most countries, participation in the census is compulsory, but the information collected on individual households and businesses is confidential.\n\nIn the United States, the national census, mandated by the federal Constitution, is conducted every ten years by the U.S. Census Bureau, which reports the detailed results in statistical form by state. Census data is used to apportion seats in Congress and to gather demographic and economic information about citizens and other residents, later compiled and analyzed in federal statistical publications. U.S. census data is available in the government documents collections of larger libraries and online at: www.census.gov. Summary tables are published in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, prepared annually since 1879 and available in the reference section of most libraries in the United States. See also: census tract, Domesday Book, and TIGER files.\n\nIn archives, the formal act of attesting to the official identity and nature of an original document or its reproduction. Compare with authentication.\n\nAlso, the process by which a state agency, or a nongovernmental agency or organization authorized by a state government, evaluates the qualifications of an individual, organization, or institution to perform a specific service or function for the purpose of granting a credential. In June 2007, the Board of Directors of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) reaffirmed its Statement on Certification & Licensing of Academic Librarians opposing certification or licensing in lieu of the master's degree as the appropriate professional terminal degree for academic librarians. However, National Board Certification of library media specialists is encouraged by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL). Compare with accreditation. See also: approved program.\n\nAny mark, sign, or symbol conventionally used in writing or printing, including letters of the alphabet, numerals, punctuation marks, and reference marks. In indexing, the smallest unit used in the arrangement of headings. See also: loan character and nonfiling character.\n\nIn data processing, a sequence of eight binary digits (one byte) representing a letter of the alphabet, numeral, punctuation mark, or other symbol. See also: character set.\n\nAlso, a fictional person in a novel, play, short story, or other literary work. A character study is a work in which the primary theme is the inner development of a person or group of persons (example: Hamlet). In Library of Congress subject headings, \"Characters\" is a standard subdivision used in personal name headings for writers of fiction, particularly playwrights (example: Shakespeare, William, 1546-1616--Characters--Falstaff). Well-known characters may be given a separate heading, followed by a parenthetical qualifier, as in Jeeves (Fictitious character). See also: stock character.\n\nAn informal, collegial gathering of librarians and library administrators, publishers and vendors of library materials, and other interested persons, held annually since 1980 (usually in November) in Charleston, South Carolina, to discuss issues of mutual interest. Conceived by Katina Strauch, head of collection development at the College of Charleston Libraries and editor of Against the Grain, the Charleston Conference does not include exhibits and is not associated with any professional organization.\n\nDiscussions at past Conferences have focused on the escalating cost of materials (particularly serials subscriptions), the effects of electronic publishing on libraries and vendors, licensing and access to digital content, the impact of journal aggregators on institutional subscriptions, e-journal archiving, the need for reliable and consistent usage statistics for digital resources, and the impact of market forces on scholarly communication. Attendance has grown to over 500, with librarians accounting for about one-half of the attendees. Most of the librarians represent academic libraries, many at large research institutions. Click here to learn more about the Charleston Conference.\n\nFederal legislation passed in 1998 imposing civil and criminal penalties on commercial Web publishers who allow persons under the age of 18 to access material deemed \"harmful to minors\" under prevailing community standards. An injunction won by free speech advocates prevented enforcement of COPA. In September 1999, the Freedom to Read Foundation of the American Library Association (ALA) filed an amicus curiae brief in support of 17 online content providers, plaintiffs in a successful challenge (American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft) in which the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the community standards clause in the law overly broad.\n\nIn May 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the application of community standards to the Internet but remanded the case to the lower court for examination of unresolved free speech issues. On March 6, 2003, the federal appeals court in Philadelphia again ruled COPA unconstitutional on grounds that the law deters adults from accessing materials protected under the First Amendment. On August 11, 2003, on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), the Bush administration filed a new appeal asking the Supreme Court to reconsider COPA on grounds that other methods of protecting children from exposure to sexually explicit materials, such as filtering software, are inadequate. In June 2004 in a 5-4 decision the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Philadelphia court, blocking enforcement of COPA, but stopped short of declaring the law unconstitutional and, for a second time, sent Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union back for a new trial, which began on October 25, 2006.\n\nOn March 22, 2007, U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed, Jr. struck down COPA, finding it in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. On July 22, 2008, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 2007 decision, and on January 21, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear appeals of the lower court decision, effectively killing COPA. See also: Communications Decency Act.\n\nLegislation passed by Congress in 2000 that makes the E-rate discount on Internet access and internal connection services provided to schools and libraries under the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 and eligibility for Library Services and Technology Act funds contingent on certification that certain \"Internet safety policies\" have been put in place, most notably technology designed to block all users from accessing visual materials that depict child pornography or are considered obscene or harmful to minors. Filtering of text is not required. In March 2001, the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed separate suits challenging CIPA on grounds that filtering restricts access to constitutionally protected information.\n\nIn May 2002, a three-judge panel in federal district court unanimously ruled CIPA unconstitutional, agreeing that current Internet filtering software blocks speech protected under the First Amendment. In June 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court and on June 23, 2003, by a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision, ruling that First Amendment protections are met by the law's provision that filtering software is to be disabled by the library without significant delay at the request of an adult user. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that public libraries and schools wishing to retain federal technology funding must certify by July 1, 2004 that filtering software is installed and in use on all computers providing Internet access, including those used only by staff. CIPA provides no funds for libraries to implement filtering. Some libraries and library systems have decided to forgo federal library funds in order to maintain local control over Internet access.\n\nIn a statement of objectives regarding CIPA issued on July 25, 2003 by ALA president Carla Hayden and the ALA executive board, the ALA pledged to identify technological options that minimize the burden on libraries, continue to develop and promote viable alternatives to filtering, and gather and disseminate authoritative information and research on the effects of CIPA and filtering on libraries and library users, including evaluative information for use in selecting filtering software.

See also: Child Online Protection Act and Communications Decency Act.\n\nLiterary works created specifically for children, as distinct from works written for adults and young adults, including drama, poetry and prose, fiction and nonfiction. Children's literature began with the oral transmission of nursery rhymes, songs, poems, fairy tales, and stories. During the early 17th century, the horn book came into widespread use in Britain and the American colonies, but it was not until the late 17th century with the publication of the popular Tales of Mother Goose by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) that written literature for children emerged as a separate genre.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, the British writer, printer, and publisher John Newbery (1713-67) perceived that a market existed for children's books and began publishing illustrated works intended to be morally instructional (Little Goody Two-Shoes). Not until the 19th century did children's literature break away from didacticism, first with the publication of the fairy tales of Hans Christian Anderson (1805-75) and the brothers Grimm, and later with Edward Lear's Book of Nonsense (1846) and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and the sequel Through the Looking Glass (1871).\n\nThe illustrations in most early children's books were printed in black and white, but by the 1860s the English printer Edmund Evans (1826-1905) began issuing picture books in color, illustrated by artists such as Walter Crane (1845-1915), Kate Greenaway (1846-1901), and Randolph Caldecott (1846-86). The publication of the children's classics Little Women by Louisa May Alcott in 1868 and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain in 1876 marked the beginning of realism in juvenile fiction. Today, children's literature has earned a place in the hearts of millions of readers, and a worldwide market exists for books and periodicals for children of all ages.\n\nRecently published children's books are reviewed in Bookbird, Booklist, The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, The Horn Book Magazine, The Lion and the Unicorn, and School Library Journal (SLJ), and reviews are excerpted in Children's Literature Review, a reference serial published by Gale. Click here to view a sample of 19th century children's literature, courtesy of the Thomas Cooper Library, University of South Carolina, and here to connect to the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection site maintained by the University of Southern Mississippi Libraries. See also Kay Vandergrift's Social History of Children's Literature. Synonymous with juvenile literature. See also: children's book award and juvenile collection.\n\nOriginally, a detailed chronological record of contemporary events, usually recorded year by year over an extended period of time, with little or no interpretation or analysis and no pretense of literary style. The first examples, world histories beginning with Creation, relied largely on biblical sources. Local chronicles began in the 9th century during the reign of King Alfred with the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, eventually covering the history of England from 60 B.C. to the 12th century. In the 13th century, vernacular chronicles began to emerge.\n\nTwo later examples are the 14th-century Grandes Chroniques de France and Jean Froissart's 15th-century Chroniques, the latter representing a fusion of the traditional chronicle with medieval romance (both are in the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale de France). The Royal Library of Denmark provides images from the manuscript Chronique Martinienne (\"Martian Chronicle\"), a French translation of a Latin world chronicle written at the end of the 13th century, and from the Book of Chronicles published in 1493. Also known as The Nuremberg Chronicle, the latter work was edited by the humanist historiographer Hartmann Schedel.\n\nIn modern usage, a list of events described and recorded in the order in which they occurred. The treatment is fuller and more connected than annals.\n\nA notice from a library informing the publisher or subscription agent that a specific issue of a newspaper or periodical on subscription, or item on continuation order, has not been received within a reasonable time, with a request that a replacement copy be sent. Claimed items are noted in the check-in record attached to the bibliographic record that represents the publication in the library catalog. See also: claim report.\n\nAlso refers to the process used by a depository library in the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) to inform the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) that an item number on its list of selections was included on a shipping list, but the document was not received. Claims must be filed by the depository within 60 days of receipt of the shipping list, except when a raincheck was issued. Claims can be filed online using the Web Claim form available on the FDLP Desktop.\n\nA hinged fitting made of ornamented metal, ivory, or bone attached to the fore-edge of the boards of a book, used from the 14th to the early 17th century to keep the leaves pressed firmly together and to prevent the covers from warping. Prior to 1200, leather strap fastenings were used for this purpose. Greek-style bindings sometimes had a clasp at the head and tail and two on the fore-edge. Michelle Brown notes in Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts (Getty Museum/British Library, 1994) that in English bindings the catch or pin was attached to the lower board, and in most Continental bindings to the upper board.\n\nClick here to view a 16th-century leather binding with two plain brass fore-edge clasps, tastefully aligned with bands of blind tooling across the back cover (Special Collections, Glasgow University Library, Ah-y.11). On luxury bindings, clasps of precious metal were sometimes engraved with a name, date, motto, or religious phrase, as on this example of a late-15th-century panel-stamped binding (Koninklijke Bibliotheek). Ornate clasps might feature cameo portraits, sometimes added later (Wellesley College Library). To see other examples, try a keywords search on the term \"clasps\" in the British Library's Database of Bookbindings. Today, clasps are used mainly on personal diaries and albums, sometimes with lock and key.\n\nFrom the Latin caudex, meaning \"tree bark.\" Originally an ancient manuscript written with a stylus on hinged wax-covered tablets made of wood, metal, or ivory, called codices. From the 1st century on, a manuscript written on sheets of papyrus, fastened at one side to allow the leaves to open and close like a book, a format used for law books in ancient Rome, also popular among the Christians because of its portability (scrolls were difficult to carry and had to be unrolled to locate a specific portion of text). Parchment replaced papyrus in about the 3rd century, and paper came into widespread use with the introduction of printing in the mid-15th century.\n\nThe oldest vellum codex known to exist is the Codex Sinaiticus, a Greek Old and New Testament of the mid-4th century written in scriptio continuo in four columns per page, currently in the British Library, although some scholars consider the Codex Vaticanus in the Vatican Library to be older. Click here to see a selection of contemporary models of early codex bindings, courtesy of the University of Iowa Libraries. The term also refers to the form of the modern book, consisting of individual leaves of writing material bound together along one edge and enclosed in a protective cover. See also: pugillaria.\n\nAgreement between two or more libraries to share the expense of collection development and management by allocating strengths in certain subject areas among the participating libraries, with the understanding that resource sharing will make materials accessible to users of all the libraries, providing a collectively richer and more useful whole than if the collections of the participants had been developed separately in response to purely local needs. The Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) in North Carolina is a successful example.\n\nA standard model for CCD in the print environment divides the information sphere into \"core\" and \"specialized\" materials. A research library has a basic responsibility to maintain a core collection on-site to serve immediate needs, especially those of undergraduates. At the same time, a commitment is made to develop collections of specialized materials in selected areas, not only to meet local priorities but also to serve consortial needs. Specialized collections are supported by the collections of consortial partners built through distributed responsibility for complementary fields. Effective delivery is essential to the success of complementary collections. Synonymous with cooperative collection development.\n\nTo determine, usually by close examination of signatures, leaves, illustrations, and other characteristics, if a copy of a book is complete and perfect, or to compare it with descriptions of ideal copies found in bibliographies for the same purpose. Also, to compare two printed works page by page and line by line, to establish whether they are identical copies or variants of the same text.\n\nAlso, to check a book for completeness before binding, and to make sure the signatures are gathered in correct sequence, a task is made easier by collating marks printed along the back fold or in the tail margin to make misplaced sections easier to spot. The marks are removed in trimming or concealed when the lining is applied to the binding edge.\n\nAlso, to merge two or more ordered sets of documents, records, pages, or data into a single desired sequence. High-end photocopiers usually have collating capability.\n\nIn codicology, a complete description of both the current and the original structure of a manuscript or book, especially the arrangement of its leaves and sections. Separate descriptions may be given of current and original structures or information about both states may be conveyed in a single collation.\n\nIn binding, a list of the signatures of a book, indicating the number of leaves in each. Also, the process of checking the physical make-up of a book for correct sequence and completeness before binding, particularly the presence of all illustrations, plates, and maps not printed with the text.\n\nIn analytical bibliography, the comparison of two texts of the same work to determine which is the first edition or the definitive text.\n\nIn library cataloging, a synonym for the physical description area of a bibliographic record, now disused.\n\nAlso refers to the merger of two ordered sets of documents, records, pages, or data into a single desired sequence.\n\nA Greek word meaning \"finishing touch.\" A statement appearing at the end of the text of an early manuscript, usually giving details of production (name of scribe, illuminator, and binder; date and place of production; etc.). The colophon may also include an expression of gratitude to the patron or client commissioning the work, a warning against unauthorized copying, or a brief comment by the scribe (often an expression of relief at having completed the task). Colophons occur sporadically in medieval manuscripts, sometimes decorated or embellished with flourishes. Click here to view an elaborate colophon in humanistic capitals, Greek capitals, and gothic book hand in a 15th-century copy of the Nicomachean Ethics (SchÃ¸yen Collection, MS 111). Early printed colophons followed the manuscript tradition, giving the name and emblem (imprint) of the printer, date of printing, number of copies printed, and sometimes an apology to the reader for any errors in the text. Click here to see the colophon in the early 16th-century Aldine edition of Dante's Divine comedy and here to see modern example (University of Pittsburgh Libraries). Synonymous with explicit. See also: impensis.\n\nIn modern printing, a statement printed at the end of the text, or on the verso of the title page of a book, especially in private press and artists' books, giving the name of the printer, typeface, grade of paper, materials used in binding, and sometimes the names of those responsible for producing the edition (click here to see an example). Also refers to a printing device, usually an emblem, used to represent a publisher's imprint (click here to see the colophon of William Morris' Kelmscott Press).\n\nA survey of a topic or body of literature that takes a general or comprehensive view of the subject. Also, a summary or digest that retains the basic pattern or structure of a larger work but condenses the content considerably.\n\nIn libraries, a method of uniform collection assessment developed in North America in 1979 to facilitate resource sharing. The system uses codes to survey strengths, levels of difficulty, linguistic and geographical coverage, etc., recorded on worksheets in subject areas based on Library of Congress Classification. In 1982, the Research Libraries Group initiated the RLG Conspectus Online to provide electronic access to data on the collections of research libraries in the United States. The system was subsequently adopted by the Association of Research Libraries for its North American Collection Inventory Project (NCIP). It has also been adapted by Library and Archives Canada and is used in the UK, Australia, and some European countries. In the 1990s, after the Western Library Network (WLN) developed PC software that enabled libraries to develop and maintain local collection assessment databases, use of RLG Conspectus Online dwindled, and the files were removed from the Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) database in 1997. Click here to view the collecting levels of the RLG Conspectus, used in Library of Congress policy statements to define the extent of its collections.\n\nA labeling system that uses ranks, grades, or classes to index media content, primarily as a means of controlling access by minors to material considered suitable for adults only. In the United States, most motion pictures produced for theatrical distribution are rated by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) according to a voluntary system introduced in 1968, using five categories to indicate age-appropriate content: G: General Audiences; PG: Parental Guidance; PG-13: Parents Strongly Cautioned; R: Restricted (anyone under 17 must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian); and NC-17: No One 17 and Under Admitted.\n\nIn response to evidence that viewing television violence can have negative effects on the psychological development of children and adolescents, Congress included a provision for \"Parental Choice in Television Programming\" in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), giving parents greater control over content available on their home television receivers. TCA required manufacturers to include a V-chip in new TV sets and recommended that the television industry develop a voluntary rating system readable by the V-chip. In January 1997, entertainment industry executives began implementing \"TV Parental Guidelines,\" a controversial four-level rating system based on the MPAA movie ratings. Many child advocacy organizations preferred ratings modeled on the premium channel system, designed to indicate the amount of sex, violence, and vulgar language by such labels as: SC: Strong Sexual Content; MV: Mild Violence; AL: Adult Language; etc. In July 1997, the industry and public advocacy groups agreed on a compromise that adds content indicators to age-based guidelines. Compare with filtering. See also: British Board of Film Classification and Motion Picture Production Code.\n\nTo make a duplicate of a document or other work by hand or any other process. Many early books were produced in only one copy. In medieval Europe, devotional works and the classics were laboriously hand-copied by monks and copyists known as scribes. Modern methods rely on printing and reprography. Compare with original. See also: copying press, photocopy, and polygraph.\n\nAlso refers to a single specimen of a manuscript or printed document. Libraries sometimes purchase heavily used items in multiple copies. Copy number is indicated in the catalog record and at the end of the call number, beginning with the second copy. In limited editions, the total number of copies printed and the number of each copy are recorded in the certificate of issue, usually on the verso of the leaf preceding the title page. See also: aberrant copy, advance copy, association copy, author's copy, blind copy, complimentary copy, desk copy, distribution copy, examination copy, last copy, review copy, and secondary copy.\n\nIn publishing, matter that is to be typeset in preparation for printing or incorporated as text into a hypertext document. See also: fair copy and printer's copy.\n\nIn data processing, to reproduce data stored in memory from one file, location, or storage medium to another without alteration and without erasing it from memory. Compare with cut-and-paste.\n\nThe exclusive legal rights granted by a government to an author, editor, compiler, composer, playwright, publisher, or distributor to publish, produce, sell, or distribute copies of a literary, musical, dramatic, artistic, or other work, within certain limitations (fair use and first sale). Copyright law also governs the right to prepare derivative works, reproduce a work or portions of it, and display or perform a work in public.\n\nSuch rights may be transferred or sold to others and do not necessarily pass with ownership of the work itself. Copyright protects a work in the specific form in which it is created, not the idea, theme, or concept expressed in the work, which other writers are free to interpret in a different way. A work never copyrighted or no longer protected by copyright is said to be in the public domain. See also: copyright compliance, copyright depository, copyright piracy, digital rights, infringement, intellectual property, international copyright, and Public Lending Right.\n\nIn 1710, the first copyright law in England (Statute of Anne) gave protection to the author for 14 years, renewable for a second period of equal length. In the United States, the first federal copyright law, passed in 1790, also provided protection for 14 years, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term. Congress extended the term in 1831 and 1909, then changed the duration of copyright to life of the author plus 50 years, effective January 1, 1978. In 1998, the controversial Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) lengthened the period to life of the author plus 70 years for works published on or after January 1, 1978, the same as in Europe. For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works for hire the period is 95 years from year of first publication or 120 years from year of creation, whichever expires first. Library and consumer groups including the American Library Association (ALA) filed amicus briefs in support of a challenge (Eldred v. Ashcroft), but on January 15, 2003 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the CTEA by a 7-2 vote. Copyright is controlled by Congress and administered by the U.S. Copyright Office of the Library of Congress (click here to see the U.S. Copyright registration of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). International copyright is governed by the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention.\n\nNotice of copyright usually appears on the verso of the title page of a book in the form of a small \"c\" inside a circle Â©, the abbreviation \"Copr.,\" or the word \"Copyright\" followed by year of publication, name of the owner of copyright, and the phrase \"all rights reserved.\" Because copyright law is highly complex, accurate interpretation often requires the advice of a legal specialist.

See also: abandonment of copyright, Copyright Clearance Center, Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and International Copyright Information Centre.\n\nIn bookbinding, especially of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a decorative element tooled or stamped on each of the four corners of a cover, sometimes as part of an ornamental design that includes a matching centerpiece. Click here to see a 15th-century example in gilt, here to see an 18th-century example with no centerpiece, and here to see stylized foliate cornerpieces on a 20th-century Doves binding (Princeton University Library). Cornerpieces can also be inlaid or onlaid, as in this 18th-century example (British Library). To see other examples, try a search on the keyword \"cornerpiece\" in the British Library's Database of Bookbindings.\n\nAlso refers to metal corners attached to the binding of a book to protect it from wear. Click here to see a 16th-century blind tooled leather binding with decorative metal cornerpieces and a matching centerpiece and clasps (Special Collections, Glasgow University Library, BD7-e.26). Metal cornerpieces are sometimes jeweled, as in this 19th-century example (British Library). In modern usage, a temporary guard made of metal, plastic, or some other hard material, attached to the corners of a book to protect against damage in shipping. Compare with boss and shoe.\n\nAlso refers to an ornament or flourish printed or drawn by hand at the corner of a border around a portion of printed or handwritten text.\n\nA long cabinet top, shelf top, or other horizontal work surface of sufficient height to accommodate a person standing in front of it who wishes to transact business with the person standing or sitting behind it. In most libraries, the circulation desk is a long counter near the entrance to the building. In the children's room of a library, countertops (and furniture) are usually lower than normal to accommodate persons of small stature.\n\nAlso, an automatic feature built into the HTML code of a Web page, or into the software running some other type of online resource, that allows the number of visits or uses to be counted for statistical purposes.\n\nIn typography, the space enclosed by the strokes of a unit of type, for example, the center of the \"p\" or the space between the vertical strokes of the \"h.\"\n\nThe quality of being in progress, recent, or up-to-date. In information retrieval, the extent to which the content of a document or source reflects the existing state of knowledge about the subject. In research, the importance of currency varies, depending on the discipline. Medical and scientific information can become outdated in less than five years, but in the arts and humanities, materials decades old may be just as useful as recent information.\n\nBecause newspapers and periodicals are issued at regular intervals, they provide more current information than books, which must be updated in supplements and revised editions. Some online catalogs and bibliographic databases allow the user to limit search results by publication date to retrieve only recently published materials. The opposite of noncurrent and outdated. See also: current awareness service, current bibliography, current contents, and current issue.\n\nIn archives, newly acquired records usually remain current for a designated period of time, after which their status is changed to semicurrent, and they are moved to a temporary holding area to await final disposition."
