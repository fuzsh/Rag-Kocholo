With a memorial website, you’re given extra space, but you’re still tasked with delivering important information about the entirety of a life someone lived. This is no small feat and can feel like an overwhelming task. Reading through obituary samples can sometimes feel formulaic or cold and can be difficult to envision when filling in for someone you love. Below are some great obituary examples of well-written, well thought out obituaries that do a wonderful job at describing the person who passed away and highlighting what made them unique and special.\n\nBefore you get started, here’s an obituary sample that outlines the typical obituary format. When reading through the obituary examples, notice how the obituary format is still there in some form, but how many of these obituaries expand on information you’d find in a typical obituary and include additional information that describes the personality and unique life lived by that individual.\n\nA standard obituary usually includes the following information:\n\nFull name\n\nDate of birth\n\nDate of death\n\nAge\n\nCause of death (if desired)\n\nEducational history\n\nProfessional history\n\nPersonal relationships (spouses, children, etc.)\n\nHobbies\n\nList of surviving family members\n\nList of predeceased family members\n\nEvent information\n\nA standard obituary template is formatted as follows:\n\n[Full name], [age], of [place of residence], passed away on [date of death] after a [cause of death].\n\n[First name] was born on [date of birth] to [parents] in [birthplace]. After [name] graduated from [name of high school] in [year], [he/she] went on to study [college major] at [college name].\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in [field], [he/she] started [his/her] first job at [company name] as a [job title], kickstarting a [number] year career in [field].\n\nIn [year], [name] met [spouse’s name] at [location]. [Deceased’s name] and [spouse’s name] went on to have [number of children] children, [list of children’s names].\n\nIn [year], [first name] retired and spent [his/her] time [list favorite activities and hobbies].\n\n[First name] was predeceased by [list of family members who have passed away]. [She/He] is survived by [list of family members who are still alive].\n\nServices will be held at [location] on [date] at [time]. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to [cause], an organization [name] felt strongly about.\n\nA standard obituary does not necessarily have to include all of that information, nor does it have to be organized as such, but that is the typical obituary format one would see. For more examples of obituaries, especially funeral obituary examples, read this article. For ideas and inspiration on customizing, tweaking, or improving upon this template, keep reading for some examples of excellent obituaries that have been posted on Ever Loved.\n\nStandard obituary examples\n\nWriting a standard obituary that accurately and skillfully delivers biographical information, descriptions of personality and accomplishments, while being a pleasure to read is a difficult task. Obituaries can sometimes come across as a list of factual information that can overlook the life, personality, and impact one had on those around them.\n\nBetty Jane Callahan's obituary is a beautifully written obituary that strikes a delicate balance between providing factual information and capturing the essence of Betty's life.

Visit Paul's memorial website to learn more about his life.\n\nRead his full obituary below:\n\nPaul Douglass Iverson went to dance with abandon on the streets of heaven on November 2, 2023.\n\nHe was born in 1961 in Lewistown, Montana. Above all, Paul’s life was defined by sharing joy in Christ.\n\nPaul exhibited a thirst for knowledge and modeled the wonder of knowing. He eagerly studied philosophy, English, linguistics, math and computer science, earning two Master’s degrees and a PhD in Math. A lifelong learner, he earned recent certifications in cloud computing and perpetually acquired new skills and perspectives to make his professional teams more effective. Suffice to say, his nose was frequently in a book - on just about any subject.\n\nHe was highly active throughout his entire life, from childhood baseball to tennis, racquetball, lacrosse, volleyball, and ultimate frisbee (including several 24-hour-long games). He was also passionate about experiencing God’s creation outdoors, spending much of his life hiking, backpacking, climbing, kayaking, wakeboarding, skimboarding and camping across the world with family and friends. At the age of 58, he discovered another new passion in mountain biking and was zealous about sharing its joys with those who joined him on the trails.\n\nPaul loved music, poetry, and the short-lived early ’90s Saturday morning cartoon The Tick. His ubiquitous sense of humor bordered on zany (but after all, isn’t sanity just a one-trick pony anyway?) He was never satisfied with \"that's the way it's always been done”. With his indomitable positive attitude, sheer muck power, and unwavering patience, he handled the hard stuff well. You wanted him on your team - and there are many teams out there who will feel his absence.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Lori, his children, Luke (Anne) and Rachel, his grandchildren, Noah and Willow, his parents, Thomas and Diane, and his brothers, Philip and Mark.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at a future date at Sky Hook Ranch in central Montana. As Paul prioritized finding joy in life and sharing it with others, the family asks that you do the same - go out and do something that brings you real joy and share it with those around you. If you feel so moved, reach out and tell us about it - or another joyful time shared with Paul!\n\nIn lieu of flowers:\n\nWycliffe Bible Translators\n\nAndy and Kimber Iverson\n\nhttps://tiny.cc/wbtgive (account # 200495)\n\nMusella Foundation for Brain Tumor Research\n\nVirtualtrials.org/iverson\n\nTuberous Sclerosis Complex Alliance\n\nhttps://give.tscalliance.org/give/268812/#!/donation/checkout\n\nCory Daniel Olson's obituary serves as a great model for others to follow due to its heartfelt portrayal of Cory Olson's life.

He was given many opportunities for advancement and was proud of his accomplishments, for that, our family would like to sincerely thank everyone at Raymond P. Cattell.\n\nCory enjoyed fishing, fast cars and Seinfeld but his claim to fame was his massive collection of PEZ. His large PEZ collection included many collectors’ items, the largest PEZ and the smallest PEZ in the world. Even a PEZ Halloween costume. With his collection alone he could have started his own PEZ museum. Collecting those items were his pride and joy until 2013 with the birth of his first child.\n\nJazzmyn, his oldest daughter, Jordan his only son and Jayda his baby girl, were his entire world. His children gave him strength during the rough times and laughter and joy all of the time. Cory’s artistic eye found beauty in everything around him and created beauty in his three children. He was so proud of his kids and, his family and friends will hold dear the stories we will be privileged to tell them one day of their funny, loving father.\n\nCory loved his family and would make a point to tell them that he loved and appreciated them as often as possible, sometimes with a hug but most frequently with a text and a nickname. Cory is survived by his parents, Dan and Jill Olson who raised him with unconditional faith, love and support; older sister, Amanda (Brian) Winge, younger sister, Becky (Justin) Blair, and younger brother, Sam (Debra) Olson whose memories, adventures, inside jokes and nicknames will hold special places in their hearts. His six nephew, James, Donovan, Nathan, Johnathan, Lincoln and Weston; along with many aunts, uncles, cousins, close friends; and the mother of his three beautiful children.

She embodied the best of qualities: unconditional love, strength of spirit, and an unending generosity that could be seen in her care for her mother, husband, children (including Vicki, her daughter in law), grandchildren (Diya & Jeev), entire family and countless others.\n\nShe worked as an administrative assistant at several companies, most recently the Evanston School District in accounting. Renuka was a stout devotee of the Swadhyay Parivar and carried out the divine messages of Rev Pandurang Shasthri Athavale. Renuka was big hearted and vibrant, and radiated light. She accepted everyone with an open heart, open arms, and a perpetual smile. She had immense passion for her family, spiritual work, singing, and the natural world. Renuka was adventurous, often exceeding the limits of what one might expect a 70 year old to be able to do.\n\nHer departure comes as a great shock and a deep wound, and it is gravely felt by her entire family and countless others who loved her deeply in her wide-network of community.

She passed away on December 29, 2022 after a very sudden decline in her health. Susan was only 73 years of age.\n\nSusan is survived by her loving partner Neil Stover, her brother Frank Murphy and his wife Pat and their children, cousin William Murphy, her three cats Virginia, Clarence \"CC\" Clemons and Gracie and many loyal friends and extended family members. Susan was predeceased by her father Francis Murphy and mother Mildred Murphy. Neil and Susan originally met in middle school in Middletown, New Jersey, but their lives took them on different paths until many years later in their 60s when they reconnected and chose each other as life partners.\n\nSusan studied English at Rutgers University graduating in 1975. In 1976, she earned her Master’s in Legal Studies also at Rutgers. In 1981, Susan moved to Tallahassee, Florida and began working at Florida State University as an Associate University Librarian, where she also received a Master’s in Historical Administration in 1985. From 1988 to 1994, Susan lived in Virginia working an Archivist at Virginia State Library and Archives followed by Manuscripts Cataloger at the University of Virginia and the Virginia Historical Society. She received her Doctorate of American History from Florida State University in 1995 while working at Penn State University as a Manuscripts Cataloging Librarian where she continued to work for 20 years. She was a published author. She was awarded the Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives Conference Distinguished Service Award in 2015 for her significant contributions to the success of MARAC and contributions to the archival profession. Most recently, Susan was a part-time Research Assistant at University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.\n\nIn 1994, Susan moved to Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. She bought her first home in 2000, reconnected with Neil in 2011 and learned to ride a motorcycle in 2013. A lover of life and new experiences, she said, \"I finally got my ears pierced the day before my 61st birthday! And just after my 63rd, Neil bought me my first motorcycle.\" Sue was an avid kayaker and steward of the environment. In 2022 alone, Susan was a Florida Master Naturalist and President of the Florida Chapter, was on the Fort Pierce County Parks Commission, was Treasurer of the Friends of Savannas Preserve State Park and took local water samples for the county. To merely say that Sue cared deeply for the earth and the creatures that inhabit it would be an understatement, as she proved this day in and day out through countless hours in the field-- counting local bird populations, cleaning up Florida's precious ecosystems by measuring and reporting garbage she collected, or by guiding visitors on educational tours through the local rivers and parks. When not out in nature, Sue could be found at rock and roll concerts with friends and Neil or listening to Bruce Springsteen in her home surrounded by pink flamingos. In addition to her passion for music and dancing, Sue liked to tend to her organic garden, read, hike, and feed the stray cats in the neighborhood (like Jasmine, Pumpkin and Socks, among others) who thought of her front porch as their own personal diner.\n\nEven at the end she found a way to smile and laugh, by mooning Neil in her hospital gown as he followed her down the hall. Sue will be remembered for her wild hair, her wild laugh and her fervor for life and all its opportunity. We love you Sue.\n\nA memorial for Sue will be held in the spring and we will notify all friends and family.\n\nCapt.

Early that morning, the clouds lifted and the Aurora Borealis ushered him to heaven.\n\nTom and Cindy married in 1988 and for twelve years resided in Ohio on Ten Mile in New Richmond and in Terrace Park with sons Matthew and Rob. In 2000 they moved to Wasilla, Alaska, in the Matanuska Valley, which they have called home for more than twenty years and at which they have enjoyed unparalleled views of Chugach’s Pioneer Peak.\n\nSeveral times Tom flew the Cessna “outside” of Alaska with Cindy and solo. In his truck camper, he logged thousands of miles on the Alaska Highway and across the lower forty-eight to visit with family, friends, and colleagues. There were trips to see Matthew, Rob, Alan, Karen, Gail, and Sharon and their families, including twelve grandchildren and one great granddaughter, and his parents and eight siblings, twenty-seven nieces and nephews, and forty grands! Some visits were about sorrows, such as the passing of his parents, but others were to celebrate weddings and new life as little ones arrived, or to celebrate family by spending time being Bubba with Adele and Jim, joining in on Francy’s famed family Christmas parties, and visiting kindred-spirit nephew, Nathan, in Montana. The Facetime, phone calls, letters, cards, and visits Tom received during the final weeks of his life were a tremendous source of joy, peace, and comfort to him.\n\nTom, the eldest of nine children was born on May 10, 1942, to Harry and Ruth Gastrich in New Richmond, Ohio. His early jobs, which he held down while in school, included working a muck fork, running a paper route, and working construction. In 1960, he graduated from New Richmond High School and went on to serve in the Ohio National Guard from 1962 to 1965, and in 1966, graduated from their basic engineering course. In 1964, he worked as a machinist at Cincinnati Milacron. Years later, he returned to school, and in 1976, he earned a Bachelor's of Arts degree in Communication at The Ohio State University.\n\nAviation was Tom’s vocation and first love. At Lunken Airport, with Bill Pinson and ten others, they formed the Kamikaze Club; they pooled their money to buy a Citabria, learned to fly, and later became ground and flight school instructors. Tom worked for TAS Aviation with John Shultz where they covered the Thursday-Sunday shift teaching ground and flight schools all over the United States. Tom’s career at Airborne Express (ABX) spanned twenty-four years, 1978 to 2002, where he flew and instructed on a Nihon YS-11 Turboprop. He traveled to Denmark in 1979 to train on his first jet, the Caravelle SE-210, which he flew as a first officer. Later as Captain he piloted the DC-8-63 (over 5000 hours), the DC-9 (seven years) and the B-767 as he closed his career at ABX.\n\nIn a word, Tom was curious and his inquisitiveness and keen intellect drove all his pursuits. His passion was aviation-be it piloting gliders, planes, helicopters, or balloons, or putting his skills as a master mechanic to work maintaining, building, and restoring planes. Tom was driven; he wanted to understand the intricacies of each part, machine, movement, and to master the requisite tool(s) for each task. Whatever he did, he was all in! He started his journey paddling a canoe and finished it in a sailboat. When he took up knitting, he learned to clean and card wool, then spin it into yarn, and then knit. Learning Spanish called for immersion in the language and culture via homestays in Mexico. He did not just volunteer to learn the art of sled dog care and mushing from Iditarod athletes, he mushed! When the master farriers at the Oklahoma State Farrier School took bets giving him a week, he proved his mettle.\n\nFor most of his life, Tom was a man of the \"simple dairy products\" (ice cream, cottage cheese, real cheese, a.k.a., not so-called cheese products, etc.); however, though initially skeptical, he became curious after witnessing Cindy’s plant-based transformation. He read up and plunged in. Sugar, dairy, meat, and oil became an anathema, and he lost nearly 80 pounds, was in the best shape of his life, and not on a single prescription.\n\nHis canine companions were dear to him. Meagan and Ellie girls have stayed behind with Cindy, but Ali, Reagan, and Max are on a long walk with him now.\n\nTom’s spiritual journey was fraught, and therefore hard-won. As a young person, he made a profession of Christian faith and was active in the church and Youth for Christ. He later parted ways with organized religion, but he never left behind the teachings of Christ—he was a principled man of integrity always in search of the truth. In his final years, he deeply contemplated his faith, and he came full circle in his beliefs and recommitted himself to Christ.\n\nFamily Who Went Before\n\nTom was predeceased by father Harry Frederich Gastrich, who died February 1, 2012 and mother Ruth Anna Marie (Haidle) Gastrich, who died July 15,2013.\n\nFamily He Left Behind\n\nHe is survived by wife Cynthia (McGinnis) Gastrich, Matthew Clay Wright (Tabitha Dawn), and Robert Joseph Wright and grandsons Johnathon Joseph Wright, Jacob Robert Wright, and Michael Jason Wright.\n\nHe is also survived by four children from his first marriage, their spouses, nine grandchildren, and one great granddaughter. They include his son Alan Gastrich Murph (Michelle), granddaughter Rachel Murph Michaud (Clayton), grandson Derek Murph (DeeDee), granddaughter Moriah Murph Childress (Skyler), and great granddaughter Sarah Hope Childress, and grandson Benjamin Roy Murph; daughter Karen Sue Gastrich Murph (Jen), daughter Gail Anne Gastrich Murph Lewis (David) and grandson Andrew Anthony Lindenblad; daughter Sharon Kay Gastrich Murph Miller and granddaughter Abigail Joanne Miller, granddaughter Anna Kate Miller, grandson James Alan Miller, and grandson Jonathan Denver Miller.\n\nAs mentioned, Tom is the eldest of nine children. He leaves all eight siblings, their spouses behind, twenty-seven nieces and nephews, and forty-one grands. They include sister Adele Cheryl Mincey (James), and children Michael, Brian, Rebecca and Paul; brother Develyn Gastrich (Donna), and children Rob, Tony, Jeremy, Shane, and Kimberly; brother Dennis Gastrich (Ginger) Aaron, Jennifer, Heidi, Justin, Adrienne; sister Jenny Harrison (John), John and Amy, sister Frances Johnson (Wayne), Bethany, Nathan, Seth, Ethan; brother Harry Raymond Gastrich (Greta), Jeanie Gastrich; brother Frank Gastrich (Sherry), Brent, Ryan, and Ashley, and brother Kevin Gastrich (Jenny), Joe, Beth, and Rachel.\n\nFrederick Paul Joyce Jr.'s obituary is a well-written example as it honors the life of the deceased in a loving and respectful manner, while also providing a glimpse into his personality, accomplishments, and relationships.

It was there that he and Cynda Warren Joyce had their two children Melissa Joyce and Frederick Paul Joyce III. Forever proud of his children, touting them as “his greatest accomplishments,” they both found their own families in Dream Joyce and Ian Demers, respectfully. Fred was joyfully “Poppy” to Fred III and Dream’s two beautiful girls Magnolia and Callalily, loving them greater than he ever imagined possible.\n\nFred was strong willed and stubborn at times, but he also had an enormous heart and wonderful sense of humor. He was generous, loyal, and brave. He was clever and full to the brim with knowledge gained through all of his life experiences: mechanic, firefighter, fisherman, contractor- he could fix or build anything.\n\nHe will be remembered for all the heart he shared with his friends and family. He truly loved each of them- and if you knew him, you knew it. When his time came, he carried himself with dignity, strength, and full of love for those who went before him. He will be missed dearly.\n\nIn typical Fred fashion, there are no services planned, certainly no pomp and circumstance. A celebration of life will occur with details to be determined.\n\nJose Colcol Quiban's obituary is a wonderful example to follow for people who are trying to write an obituary and aren't sure where to begin.

In her childhood, Traci was an adorable, curly-haired spitfire. Traci became a nationally-ranked swimmer at age 10, and continued to excel in club and high school swim teams (at Wayzata High School and Park Center Senior High School). Swimming has always been her passion and freestyle was her best stroke. She attended college and studied Graphic Design and American Sign Language (ASL). She periodically worked as a swim coach at FoxJets, NHCP Lifetime, and Great Wolf, and loved teaching family and friends how to swim.\n\nEarly in life, Traci met Josh Coryea, her fiancé and partner in life. They have been together for 18 years. Josh was Traci’s rock, and his personality perfectly complemented Traci’s. They lived in Brooklyn Park with their two dogs, Odie and Otto, and their tortoise, Floyd.\n\nTraci will be greatly missed by her fiancé Josh, their pets, Cathy and Dan (parents), Olivia (sister), Amanda (sister), Tim (brother-in-law), her nephews (Wyatt and Brooks), her “nieces and nephews” on Josh’s side of the family, and grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins.\n\nTraci had the biggest heart and the most beautiful smile. She was a private and quiet person, but also very witty and fun! She was fearless and independent, yet sensitive and incredibly compassionate. She loved the beach, vacations, swimming, art, cooking, coaching, video gaming, true crime podcasts, Harry Potter, her dogs, and gardening. She was strong-willed and stubborn, but those traits defined Traci. They were part of who she was, and her strength undoubtedly helped her deal with life’s challenges. From age 12, Traci suffered chronic medical issues, including Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) and severe autoimmune disorders.\n\nTraci was a strong fighter, but she is now sailing on a journey to shores that we cannot see. We know that she is free from pain and is floating peacefully with her sea turtle friends in the crystal-clear turquoise waters of her dreams. Just keep swimming…\n\n“Seeing death as the end of life is like seeing the horizon as the end of the ocean.\"\n\nJeffrey Max Hamner's obituary perfectly captures the essence of Jeffrey's life in a loving and celebratory way.

Zinner, Nowotny, Smith). Born in Budapest in 1948, Suzanne (Zsuzsanna) was eight years old when she and her mother escaped Hungary on foot in the dead of night, following a brief and, unfortunately, unsuccessful revolution. Her heroic journey to freedom took her from Austria to Germany before finally arriving in America, a dream come true forever immortalized on a postcard (see boat image).\n\nOnce in America, Suzanne’s second dream came true with the birth of her sister, Dr. Andrea (Nowotny) Hass, to whom she lovingly dubbed the nickname, Kookie. Suzanne spent many afternoons doing exactly as she was told, but also sneaking in as much play time with her baby sister as much as possible.\n\nSuzanne remained at home with Kookie while attending Temple University, where she met her future husband, Eric. The two were married in 1969, enjoying many years filled with fencing classes, motor biking, How to Host a Murder parties and welcoming their two children, Timothy and Caroline. After 19 years of marriage, Eric was unable to overcome his substance abuse disorder, but as their lives changed, Suzanne committed herself to maintaining a sense of normalcy, protection and care for her children, spending many years prioritizing their needs well above her own.\n\nEven in the face of her own tragedy, Suzanne remained a steadfast friend and confidant to everyone she knew. Over her nearly 40 years in Weston, CT, Suzanne became a well-known fixture in town, highly involved in Norfield Church, the Girl Scouts, each of the 80 sports Tim wanted to see if he’d enjoy, and - of course - everything WHS Company related. She even sat through ten years of Beverly Hills 90210 episodes without complaining.\n\nFollowing decades of kinship, Suzanne married her most dedicated friend, partner and confidant, Donald H Harris, in 2002. The Harris & Harris detective agency/Blue Spruce Inn proprietors created countless unforgettable happy memories for their newly expanded family, including Don’s daughter and son-in-law, Whitney and William Goetz and their children Hannah and Harry. As their blended family continued to grow, Don and Suzanne provided their children and grandchildren with all of the love, comfort, hospitality, humor and stability a family could ask for.\n\nZsuzsanna/Suz/Suzie/Zsuzsika/Mom/Nama/Schmoopie leaves behind six adoring grandchildren - Hannah Goetz, Harry Goetz, James Moore, Enzo Douglas, Andrew Moore and Mikey Moore -, three children - Whitney Harris Goetz, Timothy Andrew Douglas and Caroline Ilona Moore, three children in-law - Will Goetz, Lori Ann Salmeri and David James Moore - an adoring sister, Dr Andrea Hass and her loving family Brian, Brett and Brandon Hass and Hillary and Mitra Veerammasuneni - countless friends, colleagues and acquaintances and the most life changing partner, caretaker, confidant, father and friend we could have asked for her to have, her husband Don.\n\nIn light of public health concerns, a Celebration of Life will be scheduled in Spring of 2023. Should you feel so inclined, you are welcome to make a contribution to Regional Hospice Danbury, whose incredible staff consistently went above and beyond to make sure her final days and weeks were, in her words, “The most spoiled she has ever been her entire life”.\n\nMichael “Mike” Palmer's obituary is a wonderful obituary detailing the life and dedication of a life-long farmer.

He was born in Harvard, Illinois, to Allyn and Jane (Heyer) Palmer on February 13, 1947. He grew up in Zenda with his three brothers, working on the family farm, having fun with cousins and neighborhood friends, and riding his horse, Wimby. He attended Zenda Grade School and Big Foot High School (class of 1965), where he developed lifelong friendships and an appreciation for learning. His childhood was an idyllic time in his life, which he recalled fondly.\n\nHe attended Blackburn College in Carlinville, IL, where he played basketball and was a hurdler and pole vaulter on the track team. He held the school record in pole vaulting for several years and was nicknamed “Pit.” He met more lifelong friends, including Elizabeth “Libby” Bean, his wife of 53 years (married August 16, 1969).\n\nHe taught math and computer science at Wilmot High School for 33 years. He loved his students and fellow teachers and created the good-natured underground faculty newspaper, The Backstabber, which by most accounts provided witty and hilarious observations of life at Wilmot. The students frequently voted him “teacher of the year.” He also coached basketball for a few years and track for many years.\n\nWhile he enjoyed teaching, he was always a farmer at heart. He took pride in living on the family farm in Zenda. He loved working outdoors, baling hay, improving his farm buildings, and restoring tractors. He owned a dozen old tractors - twice as many as his wife knew about. His gardens were legendary, and he planted hundreds of trees in his lifetime. His hobbies included buying and selling coins, playing poker, and collecting antiques. He served as a Linn Town Board Supervisor for ten years. He was a longtime member of Linn Presbyterian Church and spent many years managing the rummage shed.\n\nHe was a devoted father and grandfather who created a nickname for everyone. His children were affectionately known as Big Squid, Dirt, and Buzzer Bee. He looked forward to visits from his grandkids and instilled in them a love for farm life and a tolerance for algebra. He had an amazing memory and told entertaining stories, sometimes with a hint of exaggeration. Even in his last few days, he told stories from throughout his life, and he had a dream where he was driving a stagecoach with 100 horses. He liked that dream.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife, Libby; children, Amanda (Jeff) Felbab of Windermere, FL, Alex (Gustie) Palmer of Zenda, WI, and Anne (Brent) Smith of Chicago, IL; grandchildren: Dylan and Elizabeth Felbab; Lahni, Lishi, and Mia Palmer; Leo and Julia Smith, three brothers: Jon (Sandy) Palmer, Gord (Sandy) Palmer, and Mark (Denise) Palmer; his Aunt Nancy (Bob) Schroeder as well as beloved cousins, nieces, nephews, and dear friends.\n\nFamily and friends are welcome to attend a celebration of life, which will be held at the family farm on October 9 from 1:00-5:00 p.m. Visit https://everloved.com/life-of… for more details.

She graduated from the Paul B Smith Academy in 1983 as class valedictorian and went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in linguistics (cum laude) in 1991 from York University. Subsequently, she worked as a corporate trainer for Automatic Data Processing and Hewlett-Packard.\n\nGwenda’s children from her marriage (1984-2007) to Gary Schmidt, Eric and Corinna, brought her much joy. With her family she enjoyed traveling, especially to national parks, camping, hiking, biking, and home decorating. She found much pleasure in reading broadly, and in sharing books with her children. Especially memorable are family trips to Pennsylvania/New York, Western Canada, Nova Scotia/Prince Edward Island, and Arizona/Utah/California.\n\nGwenda also treasured trips with Corinna in later years to Scotland, New Zealand, and Costa Rica. With Eric she enjoyed reading Euclid and Sherlock Holmes and playing computer games (remember Lemmings?).\n\nAfter a move to Loveland, Colorado, Gwenda obtained her MS (2003) and PhD (2006) degrees from Colorado State University in psychology - cognitive neuroscience.

They created many memories while enjoying trips as a family. Visiting Mount Rushmore, Florida, and camping all over Manitoba and Ontario. He volunteered as a coach for soccer and hockey and attended many of their activities.\n\nHe took an active role in the lives of his grandchildren.Teaching Austin how to play skip-bo and always sharing advice on life skills and caring for him like a son. He loved to spend afternoons with Marley and Nico going to Ghost Lake, playing mini golf, taking them camping, or for ice cream treats. He would have special ‘campfires’ with Everett, and this summer he was able to experience Eddie catching his first fish while taking Everett and Eddie fishing.\n\nJoseph had many professions throughout his life. He worked in coal mine, farmed, was a co-founder of JO-VI-AL farming co-op, was a foreman for a few home builders, drove feed and fuel trucks, and owned and operated River City Pizza with wife and two sons. After moving to Alberta he found his place at the Tool Rental in Home Depot where he made many friends.\n\nJoseph had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. He was often spending his spare time researching topics of interest or reading books. He enjoyed watching the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and was an avid Winnipeg Jets fan. He enjoyed doing puzzles and whenever surrounded by company you could be sure he would seize the opportunity for a game of canasta. You could be sure he is playing canasta in heaven with his family. Joseph loved driving and never turned down a good road trip. He really enjoyed his trips to Hawaii, Yuma, Victoria, and Florida. Recently he purchased an RV and made many good memories this past summer camping with his wife.\n\nJoseph was never scared to take on new opportunities and did everything with honesty and integrity. He had very strong values and was well liked by everyone, mostly due to his positive energy. Joseph had incredible patience, and always made time to help others. He would say it all comes back to us.\n\nHis legacy will carry on forever reminding us that we control our attitudes. We choose to live a life of meaningful acts of love and service, like Christ modeled for us.\n\nThere are no words that can express how grateful and blessed we are to our neighbors who were there for us on the night of his passing. Also a heartfelt thank you to the Cochrane EMT, Firefighters, and RCMP for doing everything they could.\n\nJane R. Westerfield's obituary does an excellent job at following a standard obituary format, while expanding on the type of information that's typically included in an obituary. Her lifelong accomplishments (such as publishing her very own book of poetry) and her warmth as an individual (carrying dog biscuits around for each home visit!) is apparent throughout her obituary. Jane's obituary is thoughtful, well-written, and a great example for those who want to follow a standard obituary format but also want to invite readers to experience the personality of the person who has passed. Visit Jane's memorial website to learn more about her life.\n\nRead Jane's full obituary below:\n\nJane R. Westerfield, born Jenny Jane Robertson in March of 1944, was the daughter of the late Bishop Frank and LuReese Robertson and was the older sister of the late F. Lewis Robertson, Jr. She departed this earthly life on Tuesday, August 23, 2022 at the age of 78.\n\nShe is survived by her three children: Jenna Jackson of Brunswick, GA (son Parker), Mark Westerfield of Spring, TX (wife Loren and sons Caleb and Cameron) and Laura Campbell of Atlanta, GA (husband Bill, daughters Lorelei and Gloria, and son Asa); as well as her cousin Bill Robertson and some extended family.\n\nAfter earning her Bachelor of Music degree from Wesleyan College in Macon, GA, she married Jim Jackson and had her first daughter, Jenna. She then moved to Kentucky to work on her Masters degree in Church Music from Southern Baptist Seminary. It was there she met and married Larry Westerfield, later having their son, Mark, and daughter, Laura. She later earned her Doctor of Arts degree from Ball State University. As a lifelong learner, she often said she would have stayed in school all her life if she could have.\n\nJane was also a freelance writer, authoring many books including her own original set of children's books about death and grief. She created a poetry book, collaborating with authors on \"\"This One's for the Birds\"\" - a book to raise awareness about an oil spill affecting coastal wildlife. Another book she authored is The Colors of Hope. It follows the story of a young man who is diagnosed with cancer but is not supported by his family through his battle with the disease, because he is a gay man with a devoted partner.\n\nJane was most recently employed as a Hospice Chaplain at Bridgeway Hospice in Athens. She was a natural with patients and many families have expressed their fond memories of her and her visits to their family members. It was routine for her to carry dog biscuits with her to every home visit in case she met a good doggie to have some smiles and pets.\n\nAs a woman of faith, Jane wished to have a celebration of the immortality promised to all by Christ. She would love to be remembered with funny, strange, or silly stories that celebrate what was good and blessed in her life.\n\nDr. Rachelle Anne Scott's obituary is a great example of highlighting both the importance of one's career aspirations and achievements (as well as the journey to get there) and the importance of one's personal life and accomplishments. Dr. Scott's journey towards becoming an MD is beautifully described and includes quotes from her life, letting the audience get a better glimpse into how impactful Dr. Scott was to her community and family. The author of this obituary goes one step further by including descriptions and quotes of Dr. Scott from others, which helps each reader understand just how special Dr. Scott was. Visit Rachelle's memorial website to learn more about her life. )\n\nRead Rachelle's full obituary below:\n\nOur beloved, Rachelle Anne Scott, MD, passed away on August 30, 2022 at her daughter’s home in Herndon, VA. She was 71.\n\nRachelle was born in St. Louis, MO on March 31, 1951 to Dorothy Mae (Bates) Lee and Robert Dicks. Shortly thereafter, Dorothy, Rachelle, and twin sister, Rochelle, moved to Erie, PA where she spent her early childhood. Dorothy married Robert Lee and in 1958, younger sister, Katherine, was born. When Rachelle was a teen, the family moved to Indianapolis, IN where she attended Arsenal Technical High School.\n\nThough she was a true midwesterner, as she would tell anyone who asked, in 1969 she left her familiar roots behind for the big city, choosing to complete her undergraduate degree at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY. There, she met some of her dearest lifelong friends, as well as her future husband, Franklin Scott. By the time she graduated in 1973–with an acceptance to New York Medical College in Valhalla, NY, in hand–Franklin and Rachelle were married and they welcomed a daughter, Makeba, in 1974. In 1982, a daughter, Keenya was born and in 1992, a son, Jamal.\n\nAfter earning her medical degree, Dr. Scott continued to thrive academically and professionally. She completed a residency in pediatrics at the University of Chicago and served as an attending pediatrician at Harlem Hospital before she decided to complete a second residency, in dermatology, at New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical College (NYH-CUMC) in New York City, studying under the guidance of her mentor, George W. Hambrick, Jr., MD. She began the residency program with a two-week-old infant at home and finished it as chief resident, thus commencing a stellar and illustrious 30-year career at NYH-CUMC.\n\nOnce, a younger classmate from Vassar, wondering how she accomplished so much, described her as “brilliant.” Ever humble, Dr. Scott responded, “That’s not true, I just work hard.” But, it was her sister, Katherine, who accurately surmised, “You’re both brilliant AND you work hard.”\n\nAnd that combination seemed to work for her, coupled with her warmth, charm, humor, grace and talent. Within the halls of NYH-CUMC and throughout the streets of the Upper East Side, Dr. Scott was a rock star. Her patients, colleagues and staff all adored her, and would call out to her, “Dr. Scott! Dr. Scott!” wherever she went. And she would take the time to talk to every single person, from the university president to the janitor because she genuinely cared.\n\nRichard Granstein, chairman of the department of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical Center describes her as follows: “Dr. Scott was the heart and soul of our department. She was one of the hardest working, smartest, and best clinicians I have ever worked with in my professional life,” “She had real heart, cared deeply about her patients and gave them excellent care, loved her family and friends and was a great colleague in every way.”\n\nIn 2001, Dr. Scott suffered a stroke which greatly impacted her ability to communicate and compromised her ability to fully practice medicine. She subsequently struggled with other health issues including brain surgery which resulted in a seizure disorder. Although deeply saddened by that turn of events, Dr. Scott never gave up on herself, her ability to heal, or her ability to meaningfully contribute to the field of dermatology. She continued to participate in medicine; remained certified, attended meetings, counseled young physicians, and stayed involved in the study and practice of dermatology until her last days.\n\nDr. Scott loved her family dearly. Her children were the light of her life and her relationship with her sisters was cherished. She was an amazing mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, cousin, colleague and friend. She touched the lives of so many people. She will truly be missed and will never, ever, be forgotten.\n\nDr. Scott is survived by her three sisters, Rochelle Lee of Providence, RI, Katherine Lee Kasberg (Robert) of Attleboro, MA, and Ramona Dicks (John) of Madison, WI; two daughters, Keenya Scott of New York and Makeba Scott Hunter of Herndon, VA; son, Jamal Scott of Herndon, VA; and twin granddaughters, Jozi and Jaeda Hunter of Herndon, VA, in addition to a host of nieces, nephews, and cousins. She is preceded in death by her husband, Franklin Scott, and father Robert Dicks (Alvira).\n\nFor those looking for an excellent obituary, full of stories, anecdotes, and important information on the character and life of a loved one -- look no further than Richard Sheridan's obituary.

Visit Richard's memorial website to learn more about his life.\n\nRead Richard's full obituary below:\n\nRichard Sheridan, born in New York City on July 17, 1946, passed away on August 21, 2022, in his home off Live Oak Street in Dallas, Texas.\n\nRich was born to Paul Sheridan and Marion Gentile and raised in the New York City borough of The Bronx. As if his thick east coast accent was not enough of a giveaway, he proudly wore a cap which read “The Bronx” for nearly a quarter of his life, a badge of sorts announcing the area from which he was proud to hail. This was one of the many personal \"\"props\"\" which added to and defined his character, and which was bound to elicit a series of stories for those meeting Rich for the first time.\n\nHe grew up with his two siblings, older sister Marion and younger sister Gerry. While he struggled with the divorce of his parents, he eventually received a great gift in his stepfather Harry Baehr, who was a hardworking man of strong character and exceptional sense of humor, something Harry no doubt passed along to his stepson. Rich was a diligent student who excelled in academics and enjoyed choir, theater, and, of course, the New York Yankees. In fact, after idolizing Mickey Mantle as a kid, he later met the baseball great at the August Moon restaurant in Dallas and shared some of his childhood memories.\n\nAfter graduating from Cardinal Spellman High school in 1964, he attended Manhattan College and earned a bachelor's in civil engineering followed by a master's in environmental engineering in 1970. Shortly after graduation, in 1971 he married Pamela Riccio. Thereafter, the pursuit of his career in environmental engineering – wastewater treatment specifically - took the couple from east coast to west coast; or, as he would like to joke, \"\"I ran in the opposite direction of my mother-in-law (who they lived with at the time), and the only thing that stopped me was the Pacific Ocean.\"\"\n\nDuring the years spent working with Hydroscience Engineers in the San Francisco Bay area, Rich realized some of the most profound success in his life. He was chosen among his peers back east to open the west coast office due to his engineering acumen as well as communication skills rare in those with a technical background. His creativity was allowed to take hold in the various projects he led, and some of the inter-office shenanigans – which he apparently also led - can be more fully understood to this day via the handwritten comic strips he created (even though the inside jokes are nearly indecipherable by anyone who didn’t work there).\n\nBut while in California, he had a hand in creating what he would, in his later years, consider his \"\"greatest accomplishment”: his two boys. Michael Paul was born in 1977 in Berkeley, and Nicholas Scott was born three years later in Walnut Creek, CA. Not long after welcoming his second son into the world, he joined Celenese Corporation, this time moving the family to the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.\n\nAnyone who knew Rich from an early age would note that he underwent some fundamental changes from the time he left New York to the time he arrived in Dallas. Speculation as to the reasons for this is futile at this time, but suffice it to say that, as everyone experiences at some point in his or her life, Rich faced significant challenges, perhaps the most profound of his life. How he dealt with these challenges was an abrupt pivot in focus to political and social issues, and it was these issues in which he devoted the majority of his time henceforth and in which he derived much of his identity and meaning.\n\nOver the years, there were number of issues he took a stand on, at times taking a self-proclaimed \"\"over the top\"\" or \"\"outrageous\"\" approach of expression, with the philosophy \"\"reaction equals change.\"\" While many did not agree with all his opinions, no one can deny he was unafraid of speaking up on what he believed in, and no cause was greater on his list of political agendas than addressing the issue of homelessness in Dallas.\n\nIn remembrance of Rich Sheridan and his efforts to help fight the battle against homelessness, we ask that donations be directed toward Our Calling, a local organization in which he had extensive involvement. Our Calling works tirelessly to clothe, educate, and feed the homeless, and it is charitable actions such as these which kept Rich going in his later years.\n\nThroughout his life, Richard Sheridan was referred to in many ways. He was a son and a brother. He would go on to become a professional engineer and, in the words of his co-workers, and “enlightened” manager and leader. He would become a husband and a father and a grandfather, and it’s reasonable to say he considered himself a follower of the teachings of Christ. However, it’s highly likely that he would prefer to be known in perpetuity by the moniker affixed to him during his engagement with the local politics of Dallas: a gadfly.\n\nBrian A Hanson's full spectrum of interests and career paths is wonderfully laid out in this well written obituary that gives us insight into what Brian was like when he was younger, his varied skills and his dedicaton to pursuing his interests.

Visit Brian's memorial website to learn more about his life.\n\nRead Brian's full obituary below:\n\nBrian A Hanson, 72, died at home in Bloomingdale, IL on July 3, 2022. He was the third son born on January 23rd, 1950 to Harland Gordon Hanson and Mermon Cosby Hanson in Saint Louis, Missouri.\n\nHe was involved in many activities during his school days in Downers Grove including drama, band, track, wrestling and was senior class president. His wrestling experience would later help him win a participation trophy at the “Old Timers” tournament at son Brendan’s high school wrestling meet in 2004.\n\nHe attended University of Illinois where he considered pre med study. (His parents will be so proud to know he will finally find himself in anatomy lab as he donated his body in death). After graduation he went into the family business of Hear Muffs and would later find success in sales of the first car phones, cellular phones and helped refine home theaters. His sales career introduced him to many interesting people and places. He became a Registered Nurse in 2006 and found his niche in rehab and hospice nursing.\n\nBrian loved an adventure; his travels included Uganda, Europe, and Australia but perhaps his favorite destination was the Huzzah Creek for floating, camping and quality bonding time (QBT) with the family. He also served many terms as Chief Boiling Water for both Indian Princesses and Indian Guides and made sure his tribes ate well during the campouts. Some of the best meals spent together were around a campfire and he was always ready for any opportunity to put on a pig roast!\n\nIn the last four years, Brian endured many health issues including a cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury in 2018 and was involved in The Bison Project, where he found community with others with brain injuries. He was an eternal optimist and always looking to make the “big comeback” and speak on his experiences of surviving 2 cardiac arrests. Despite his challenges, music continued to be a lifelong comfort and he enjoyed singing in choir at his multiple church homes over the years as well as playing around on his keyboard or piano for brain exercises.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and best canine companion Boomer. He is survived by brothers Gordon Hanson and Stephen Hanson. He said his greatest joy was being a dad to children Julia (Dan) Craig, Geoffrey Hanson and Brendan Hanson. He “found hope in the future” with grandchildren Henry Craig, James Craig and Madelyn Hanson. He was Uncle Brian to many who surely all have a story to tell of his shenanigans. The family is forever grateful to Rosie Reiter for her invaluable support and surrounding Brian in love in his last months.\n\nIn lieu of a traditional memorial service, Brian has requested to “have a big party” which will take place on August 1st, 2022 at\n\n299 Edgewater Drive\n\nBloomingdale, IL 60108\n\nOpen House Reception from 5pm to 8:30pm with Remembrance Ceremony at 7pm.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests spending some QBT in the great outdoors with your loved ones in his memory.\n\nHis heart of this world may have failed but his spirit was stubbornly strong:\n\nWhen peace, like a river attendeth my way\n\nWhen sorrow like sea billows roll;\n\nWhatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,\n\nIt is well, it is well, with my soul.\n\nManuel “Manny” Bustillo's obituary is a wonderful example to follow for those who want to provide factual and biographical information woven alongside insight into one's personality.

Married in 1989, Connie and Manuel welcomed two sons together, Marshall in 1992 and Mitchell in 1995.\n\nThrough the years, Manuel enjoyed fishing with his brother and sons, cooking for his family, and making friends wherever he went. Manuel was a stranger to no one and found great purpose sharing in the successes, joys, and challenges of those around him. Manuel was authentically and wholeheartedly there for those in his life.\n\nAfter retiring from Lockheed Martin, Manuel pursued a quieter life closer to nature with a property on Cedar Creek Lake in Malakoff, TX where he and Connie enjoyed most weekends.

It can be difficult to get a clear picture of the type of person someone was through an obituary, but this obituary does an excellent job at painting just that type of picture. Visit William's memorial website to learn more about his life.\n\nRead William's full obituary below:\n\nWilliam H. Kingkiner, Jr, of Kunkletown, PA, passed away unexpectedly on May 03, 2022. He was only 53 years old. The family is both devastated and shocked by his death. William was born on March 03, 1969 in Philadelphia, PA to William H. Kingkiner, Sr and Anne (Slater) Mays.\n\nWilliam graduated from LaSalle College High School in Wyndmoor, PA in 1988 and over the course of his life he worked in various areas of farming and construction that included building, carpentry, roofing and landscaping. Ever since he was a little boy, William had always dreamed of building his own house in the mountains. The skills he had acquired enabled him to make his dream a reality and in 2017 he completed the construction of a house in Kunkletown, PA with beautiful views of Blue Mountain in the Poconos. William loved to hunt and fish and was a member of the Wissahickon Crick Anglers. William's door was always open, on Ritchie Street in Manayunk and in Kunkletown. The cast of characters coming through and the banter that followed would give any TV sitcom a run for their money.\n\nWilliam's antics were legendary and those who knew him have their own stories to tell. He said what he meant and meant what he said. Although known as \"\"Bad Billy\"\" to many, there was another side to him. William had compassion. Those that had nowhere to go, to stay, to sleep or to eat have reached out to say how grateful they were that he took them in when no one else would. Some he helped to detox, going as far as tying them to a tree or locking them in a trailer in the woods. And when they cried out, his response was \"\"You're not dying, it just feels like you are. You're gonna get thru it.\"\" And they did.\n\nIn addition to his parents, William was predeceased by his sister, Maryann. He is survived by sisters Lori, Miriam, Kelly and brothers Alfred and James. He leaves behind daughters Gabrielle, Ashley, Kaitlyn, Makayla and Emme as well as three grandsons and four granddaughters. There are several nieces, nephews and extended family members that will miss him dearly.\n\nServices are being held for William on Monday, June 13, 2022 at St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church, 119 Rector St., Philadelphia, PA 19127. Visitation will be at 9:30AM followed by a Funeral Mass at 10:30AM. Interment will be private.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that a memorial donation be made to offset funeral costs and allow his daughter's to lay their father to rest.\n\nhttps://everloved.com/life-of/william-kingkiner-jr/\n\nKevin P.
