        "text": "1) THE PRESIDENT'S CORNER (by Tom Steichen)\n\nAfter the bits and pieces here in my \"Corner,\" I begin the main articles with yet another piece based on the book \"Proper Peasants.\" This month's Article 2 is the fourth article from the book and speaks to Personal Social Networks.\n\nArticle 3 starts a new (but short) sequence of three articles that provide Translations of Long-Form Hungarian Civil Records, those used from 1895 until 1906 The first will be for an example Birth Record.\n\nArticle 4 derives from material shared by BB member Andreas Shoredits, of Cape Town, South Africa. He sent photographs of the Draßburg War Memorial Monuments... I transcribed the data and offer it here and have added it to the BB Draßburg village thumbnail history.\n\nThe remaining articles are our standard sections: Historical Newsletter Articles, and the Ethnic Events and Emigrant Obituaries sections.\n\nBurgenländische Gemeinschaft Anniversary Celebration:\n\nDr. Walter Dujmovits recently sent me a letter:\n\nDear Tom!\n\nWe intend to celebrate our anniversary \"60 years Burgenländische Gemeinschaft\" in an impressive and worthy way this year. It is to be a thanks for all who established that work and to you who currently make a useful contribution to keep and strengthen the solidarity with Burgenland. I'd like to cordially invite you and your family, your friends and members of the Burgenland Bunch to take part. I ask you to print this invitation in the BB-Newsletter.\n\nHighlights of the event will take place at the beginning of July.\n\nSaturday, July 9th:\n\nExtended board meeting with participants from abroad in Mogersdorf.\n\nSunday, July 10th:\n\nMorning: Holy mass with the Bishop of Burgenland Dr. Ägidius Zsifkovics in the basilica in Güssing.\n\nAfterwards: Morning pint in Güssing with live broadcast on the radio.\n\nAfternoon: Picnic in Moschendorf.\n\nTuesday, July 12th:\n\nMorning: Reception Governor Niessl and Bishop Zsifkovics in Eisenstadt. Afterwards we visit the city of Rust.\n\nEvening: Wine christening in the name of \"Miss Burgenland\" in Moschedorf.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWalter Dujmovits\n\nSo, know that you are invited and do attend if you are able.\n\nRootsWeb Problems: You may have noticed that the our prior BB Newsletter Notice did not arrive until March 15th, rather than the February 28th date you might have expected it. This was because our Notice is sent using the Rootsweb mailing list service... and that service was not available.\n\nAncestry.com is the host of Rootsweb and, late in February, they reported a Rootsweb hardware failure, one severe enough that the site was expected to be nonfunctional until March 15th. I'm presuming that new equipment had to be ordered, installed and programs and data reloaded. Ancestry promised a March 15 restart and it was back up on that date. And our BB Notice, slightly altered, was sent out on that date.\n\nThe Rootsweb site still carries a notice about the issue:\n\nIn late February 2016, the RootsWeb site experienced hardware failure. Our development and web operations teams have worked diligently and carefully to restore much of the functionality and we're currently performing a site audit. If you see any issues you'd like to report please reach out to Member Services through our support form.\n\nYou can see that there remains work to be done and that they are requesting reports on any remaining issues... so, if you see a problem on Rootsweb, please report it to them.\n\nGEDmatch / FTDNA Dispute: In mid-month March, a dispute arose between GEDmatch and FTDNA, apparently over some potential for a security/privacy breach of DNA data held on the FTDNA site based on information posted on the GEDmatch site.\n\nAs you may know, DNA data generated by FTDNA is owned by the person submitting the sample for analysis. Thus that owner has the right to export their data and upload it wherever they choose, GEDmatch being an obvious choice for atDNA (autosomal DNA). FTDNA acknowledges this. GEDmatch, being they exist to allow DNA owners to widely compare their data with like-minded individuals, has slightly fewer security constraints than other sites. GEDmatch acknowledges this and simply says that, if this situation is a concern to you, do not upload your data and, if you have uploaded it, remove it (it is easy to do so).\n\nGiven this dispute and the fact that uploads of FTDNA data to the GEDmatch site are currently suspended, there have been strident opinions posted on forums and other media by individuals bashing both organizations (depending on the bent of the writer). Some have threatened to stop using FTDNA and to ask for their money back and some want to sue GEDmatch.\n\nTo allow you BB readers to be fully informed, I'll repost below the official notices about the dispute:\n\nIn mid-March, GEDmatch posted a bright red notice on their website saying:\n\nNOTICE: We are no longer accepting FTDNA DNA kit uploads. We have been asked not to say why. Please Contact FTDNA if you have any questions.\n\nA few days later, FTDNA posted a note on an FTDNA forum about the issue that read:\n\nWe have reached out to GEDMatch expressing our concern that their website could potentially lead to a breach in privacy of our customers. Given this, we proposed to discuss the subject with them, but in parallel we suggested that until further clarification and assurances that the privacy of our customers' records are protected, Family Tree DNA uploads should be suspended. We hope that with the cooperation of GEDMatch we can reestablish the uploads in the near future.\n\nThis led to an updated notice on GEDmatch:\n\nWe regret we had to make the decision to stop accepting FTDNA DNA uploads. FTDNA has threatened to sue GEDmatch over claimed privacy issues. We have been asked not to discuss the details, because it would be to FTDNA's disadvantage. Suffice it to say that FTDNA's own site seems to currently violate these same issues.\n\nWe would prefer to work closely with FTDNA in solving this problem to everybody's benefit, but we have not received a response to any of our suggested compromise solutions. The technical obstacles to satisfying FTDNA current demands are significant. It appears that our only alternative may be to remove all FTDNA DNA match results from GEDmatch. The issues raised by FTDNA do not apply to kits from other testing companies.\n\nThen FTDNA posted a longer message on their FaceBook page:\n\nWe are reaching out to our customers to make some important clarifications to what is being published regarding GEDMatch stopping the upload of Family Tree DNA results.\n\n1. Let it be clear: the DNA test results, including any raw data available to the customers through their personal page, belongs to the owner of the DNA record, and not to Family Tree DNA.\n\n2. The owner of the DNA record, consequently, can voluntarily submit his/her results to any other outfit, so long as by doing so, the customer does not compromise the privacy of any of his/her matches, or any records in the Family Tree DNA database.\n\n3. More than one customer that has uploaded their FamilyTreeDNA data to GEDMatch has contacted us about a way for people to breach the privacy of a person's Family Tree DNA record, when uploading their information to GEDMatch.\n\n4. At the time of the publication of this note, GEDMatch does not have Privacy Terms, nor General Terms & Conditions published on their home page, or on their registration page prior to registering, and thus, customers are not aware of the potential privacy risks associated with uploading their data to GEDMatch\n\n5. FamilyTreeDNA has tried to reach out to GEDMatch to discuss this subject to find ways to eliminate the risk of potential data breach. We were surprised by their unilateral note on GEDmatch about the discontinuation of the uploads in lieu of a fix, and the new note about supposed threats of lawsuits from us.\n\n6. It is regretful that GEDMatch, who has been a long time business associate and whose owners tested with FamilyTreeDNA, misrepresented our concerns and precipitated a chain of events that could have easily being solved through dialogue.\n\n7. Nevertheless, and always thinking about what is best for customers, we are open to discuss with GEDMatch ways to avoid the risks to privacy that they recognize to exist in their system and we encourage those that would like the upload to be reestablished and privacy issues being taken care of to reach out to GEDmatch.\n\nAs always, we thank you for your continued support.\n\nAs of March 19th, a joint message was posted reading:\n\nFamily Tree DNA and GEDmatch jointly announce that we are in serious conversations regarding issues that have resulted in GEDmatch discontinuing uploads of FTDNA data. Both companies recognize the importance of these talks to their customers and are committed to quickly resolve differences. We regret any inconvenience that may have been caused and assure our users that our primary focus and efforts are geared toward your benefit.\n\nSo this is where things stand as I write this note.\n\nNow for a personal opinion (and it is just a personal opinion!):\n\nBeing that FTDNA and GEDmatch are independent organizations and that DNA owners have the right to share their own data, my initial reaction is that FTDNA is overstepping by telling GEDmatch what to do and that GEDmatch is overreacting so there is room on both sides for compromise and a fix. It is my opinion that in the best interests of both organizations to do so, so I expect that it will happen.\n\nHopefully by the time this newsletter is published, the dispute will be resolved (but I'll keep you informed).\n\nGood News? As of March 25th, the angry red notice on GEDmatch was gone and this (gentle blue) notice replaced it:\n\nNote that existing 'F' (FTDNA) kit numbers on GEDmatch will be changed to 'T' followed by a random kit number. This will probably happen in the next few days. This change does not affect Ancestry or 23andMe kit numbers. If you need to make copies of your results with the old kit numbers, please do so now. Name and email information for matches will stay the same, and can be used to retain continuity in your records. Thank you for your support.\n\nIn addition, a new note appeared in the \"Raw DNA file Uploads\" section saying, \"We are ready to receive FTDNA raw DNA files as soon as the new file format becomes available for download from the FTDNA site.\"\n\nCorrespondingly, over on the FTDNA site in the \"Download Raw Data\" section of FamilyFinder, this note appeared:\n\nRead before you download: We are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. By downloading any raw data or reports, you hereby indicate that you are the owner of that data or have permission to download the data, and you further indicate your understanding that Family Tree DNA cannot in any way guarantee the security or privacy of your downloaded data. Furthermore, you understand that by uploading your raw data to a third party application and linking it to your name, Family Tree DNA kit number, email address, or any other identifying information, the security of your raw data and record is further put at risk and may lead to the violation of Family Tree DNA Privacy Policy. By downloading your raw data, you assume the liability for any breach of privacy and release Family Tree DNA from any privacy violation that results either directly or indirectly from the downloaded raw data and/or upload to a third party application.\n\nApparently the \"new file format\" is not yet available, though from an examination of my previously downloaded files, it appears that the FTDNA Kit Number appears only in the name of the wrapper file for the compressed data file.\n\nFor example, if 000000_Autosomal_o37_Results_20160325.csv.gz is the filename of the wrapper file for the \"old format\" downloaded compressed data file, then the first 6 digits, \"000000\" (in this made-up example) is the FTDNA Kit Number, \"o37\" is the file format version number, and \"20160325\" is the date the file was produced. Inside this compressed wrapper file is the actual data file (the name of it does not include the Kit Number, at least for my files) and the actual uncompressed data inside that file also does not include the Kit Number... so the fix seems to be to change only the wrapper file name. Shouldn't take more than a few months, right?\n\nBurgenland's Uhudler Wines: Speaking of disputes, the producers of Burgenland's Uhudler wines recently faced a court order by the Landesverwaltungsgerichts, the Regional Administrative Court, requiring that all vines of the Ripatella grape variety (a primary grape in modern Uhudler wines) had to be removed (uprooted) by March 15. This variety was first planted in 2003 by a number of southern Burgenland vineyards, being added to the traditional Uhudler varieties: Concord, Isabella, Elvira, Clinton and Noah. However, the argument was put forth that it was not a \"noble\" European vine (it was \"just an American import\"), and therefore should be banned. The EU and courts agreed, thus the order to remove the vines.\n\nA little background is appropriate here...\n\nUhudler originates from the time of the phylloxera aphid infestations in Europe (1860 to 1900), which led to the nearly complete loss of the traditional European grape varieties, despite many attempts to exterminate the pest or develop alternative, non-traditional viticultural practices.\n\nAt first, disease resistant North American vines (including some used in Uhudler wines) were imported to Europe and used to produce wine, but then it was discovered that a \"European\" solution to the phylloxera problem was to graft the old European varieties onto the North American rootstocks. Then, in order to allow European wine to regain its place, North American vines (including those used in Uhudler) were forbidden to be planted under the wine regulations of Europe and any wines produced from existing vines could not be sold (though production for private consumption was still permitted).\n\nHowever, prohibition led to rising popularity and the Austrian Wine Law was eventually changed to allow Uhudler to be marketed in 8 communities in southern Burgenland... which was fine until some of the vineyards planted the Ripatella variety, which wasn't approved, even for Uhudler.\n\nOnce the order came down to rip out the Ripatella vines (sorry, I couldn't resist phrasing it that way), the Burgenland Agricultural Ministry and the producers started to fight back and had a genetic analysis performed by the Geisenheim University in Germany, a school that specializes in basic and applied research serving the wine, beverage and horticulture industries and offers degrees only in those fields. Their analysis showed that the Ripatella variety is identical with the long-approved Concord variety. Thus, the State Administrative Court overruled the Regional Administrative Court and withdrew the order to remove the vines (even though that occurred two days after the original deadline to remove the vines).\n\nIt appears the crisis is now over, so enjoy a glass of Uhudler should you be in southern Burgenland!\n\nPhylotree.org Releases mtDNA Tree Build 17: In Newsletter 261 (30 Nov 2015), Article 3, I discussed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and noted that:\n\n\"...the 'keeper' of the most up-to-date version of the mtDNA tree is the Department of Forensic Molecular Biology at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, via their website www.phylotree.org and their database called Phylotree. Updates are released frequently and Phylotree is now on Build 16.\""
