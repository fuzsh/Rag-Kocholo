Cullen328 (talk)\n\nWhy should 'the' be removed from the piped link? GiantSnowman\n\nI believe it is called style as very few truncated links in football national teams have the \"the\" include in it. It could be said that by default as it is not the usual style it has become the style of WP. The only example universally that i see of truncated links including \"the\" in it is for the Netherlands. In many other truncated football related links \"the\" forms part of the sentence outside the truncation such as |the Summer Olympics]]?2603:8000:D300:D0F:A4A9:1E1:30A5:4340 (talk)\n\nI’ve just recently noticed that I haven’t added anything “fun” to my user and talk pages, and to be fair I honestly think they appear boring compared to other users. I don’t know a whole lot of knowledge for “hypertext mark up” on Wikipedia pages. Any suggestions + WP:articles that explain the CSS/HTML? Wolfquack (talk)\n\nHi @Wolfquack, welcome to the Teahouse. This may give you some tips and ideas: Wikipedia:User page design center. It's inactive, but there's still plenty to explore. 199.208.172.35 (talk)\n\nHey I want to left align some contents in a Template:Sidebar but not all. I found these \"heading{{{n}}}class\" parameters in the documentation. But I've got no idea how to find out what values these can take. Talpedia (talk)\n\nHi @Talpedia, welcome to the Teahouse. You might get more answers if you asked at Module talk:Sidebar (or whichever talk page belongs to the template/module whose documentation you were looking at). 199.208.172.35 (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nAfter submitting the Draft Draft:Dylan O'Donnell for review, two references (10 and 11) show now a Cite error.\n\nHow can I fix the problem?\n\nAny help is accepted. Thanks. LIUC.Camilla03 (talk)\n\nIn the error messages, the word \"help\" is in blue, indicating that it is a wikilink, in this case to Help:Cite errors/Cite error references no text. - David Biddulph (talk)\n\nAt those locations you inserted ref numbers 1 and 6 with a backslash, indicating you are reusing a reference created elsewhere, but it appears that nowhere in the text have you created refs with 1 and 6 in the name. David notMD (talk)\n\nI believe that the reference definitions existed previously, but were removed in some of the edits to the draft. The OP probably needs to look (with WikiBlame) for the removal of the definitions, and add them back in the place where the ref is reused. - David Biddulph (talk)\n\n@David Biddulph, David notMD: Indeed. I can't fix it right now as I am on mobile and copy/paste in recent chrome mobile versions is an absolute pain, but this old revision seems to contain the definitions of both named references (not sure if they are reliable though). Victor Schmidt mobil (talk)\n\nThe \"Cite error\" in red has nothing to do with reliability, but do check that before fixing the ref problem. David notMD (talk)\n\nThere is a user who is repeatedly replacing information on an article. They keep saying they want to write an article, but they won't let me direct them to the Article Wizard.

Professor Penguino (talk)\n\nCould someone direct me to where the style of these two words is accepted by WP. Some articles have the two words separated yet a couple article titles have it combined?2603:8000:D300:D0F:A4A9:1E1:30A5:4340 (talk)\n\nHello, and welcome to the Teahouse. If this has been discussed (and there is no guarantee that it has been discussed) I would look on WP:WikiProject Football/Matches; or failing that ask at the Project talk page WT:WikiProject Football. ColinFine (talk)\n\nAs far as i can tell it has not been discussed.2603:8000:D300:D0F:A4A9:1E1:30A5:4340 (talk)\n\nNot listed at Glossary of association football terms. GiantSnowman\n\nAnd it should not need clarification because it is not included in the glossary, or is it best to make it a free for all adding to potential confusion? Is it not the point of grammar to follow some rule. And why would such a term that is very straightforward need a glossary definition? It is not special jargon?2603:8000:D300:D0F:A4A9:1E1:30A5:4340 (talk)\n\nIf anybody is confused by this, simply use the term \"scorer\" and all will be well. An example of this would be -\"Maradona was the scorer, but he cheated by handling the ball\" !!! Roxy the dog\n\nOr just use the single word goal? \"Maradona made the most goals in the league.\" Unless the thought was phrased: \"Maradona was the highest goal scorer in the league.\" — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2603:8000:D300:D0F:A4A9:1E1:30A5:4340 (talk)\n\nWhat is this \"potential confusion\"? I don't see why anybody should be confused, just because in one place they see \"goalscorer\" and anothr place \"goal scorer\". ColinFine (talk)\n\nNot everyone reading and editing WP iss a native English use person or have the same level of understanding of what is either correct or acceptable. I can understand that the point is lost with some as they may not encounter the situation or understand under which circumstances one or more forms of a word could possibly be acceptable. Remember that there is not a test one need take before they use WP for consultation.2603:8000:D300:D0F:A4A9:1E1:30A5:4340 (talk) — Preceding undated comment added\n\nI don't know the exact rules of Wikipedia,For which I tried to use by studying on Wikipedia.So that I don't get any wikipedia rules regulation wrong.So I have been practicing on wikipedia's sandbox since 5 days ago.I thought I would publish the article after writing it properly.But today I open and see that my sandbox has no data, it seems that it has been deleted by you.So I request you to return my Wikipedia sandbox to me.I will use my Wikipedia profile by following your rules and regulations. RashidulHoque (talk)\n\nThe notice on your user talk page at User talk:RashidulHoque#Speedy deletion nomination of User:RashidulHoque/sandbox explains the reason for deletion of your user sandbox page, & tells you to contact the administrator who deleted it if you want it undeleting. - David Biddulph (talk)\n\nHi, I made a wiki article about a week ago but it doesn't appear at all via Google Search. Any idea on why this is the case and when it may be able to appear. Jattlife121 (talk)\n\nJattlife121 Hello and welcome to the Teahouse. It needs to be marked by a new pages patroller as reviewed, or when 90 days have passed. 331dot (talk)\n\nIt says reviewed but still doesn't appear. It is the Jagraj Singh article. Jattlife121 (talk)\n\nOops, I looked at a different one. It takes time for Google to index pages, even if the criteria on our end permit it. 331dot (talk)\n\nThank you. Will keep on the lookout. Jattlife121 (talk)\n\n@Jattlife121 and 331dot: The noindex rules are complicated and sometimes change. I'm not sure of all the details myself. The only reliable way to see whether an article disallows indexing is to look for <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex in the HTML. That's what search engines do and Jagraj Singh currently says it. I think it's because it's both new and nominated for deletion. This combination overrules the review per Wikipedia:Controlling search engine indexing#Indexing of articles (\"mainspace\"). There are also different types of review but this article has the right type. Even our own software cannot be trusted. \"Page information\" in the left pane says \"Indexing by robots Allowed\" but that's false (reported in 2017 at phab:T157747, still no fix). PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nJust to add on, it has been patrolled by New Page Patrol(standard for an AfD by NPP as the community will decide notability), so if the article remains after the AfD discussion, it will be indexed by search engines, though we do not have any control over their timetable. Slywriter (talk)\n\nWhat does it mean on this article, Hunter Biden laptop controversy that one cannot even make a basic copy edit or other edit, it just says \"F\" in the upper right hand corner? Is that \"Full\" protection? Only admins can edit the page? TY — Moops ⋠T⋡\n\nHi Moops. That article appears to have been WP:GOLD protected due to persistent disruptive editing. The protection is scheduled to expire sometime in a day or so, but you may use the article's talk page to make edit requests until then. -- Marchjuly (talk)\n\nUnderstood. I think I'd heard about such a protection, but never actually seen it before. TY — Moops ⋠T⋡\n\nCan someone please upload https://digital.sou.edu/digital/collection/p16085coll7/id/334/ to Wikipedia? It's non-free, but its license should allow use without having to rely on fair use. I'm going to use it in Draft:Silver Fire (1987 Oregon wildfire). 184.21.204.5 (talk)\n\nWP:NFCC#9 says that non-free images can only be used in article namespace. Can't be used in drafts. - David Biddulph (talk)\n\nHi IP 184.21.204.5. As David Biddulph points out, non-free content can only be used in articles. So, if you feel the photo's non-free use can be justified per Wikipedia's non-free content use policy, you should wait until the draft becomes an article and then upload the file as explained here. If you or anyone else tries to do so now, the file would end up being removed from the draft by a WP:BOT and then most likely end up deleted per speedy deletion criterion F5. Finally, just for refrence, fair use and non-free content use aren't the same thing when it comes to Wikipedia. Wikipedia's non-free content use policy is much more restrictive as explained here and here; so, you need to image to meet relevant Wikipedia policy for it to be considered OK to use. -- Marchjuly (talk)\n\nIs it possible, or has it ever occurred, where a source that on the RS list (is that what it is called, 'RS list'?) was previously deprecated became un-deprecated? I would love to see many more sources treated as at least the yellow color, I think no sources should truly be red or gray in my view, but even so, has it ever happened where a source was once deprecated and now is considered to be better? Management changes, editorial shifts that made it considered more reliable or trustworthy etc.? — Moops ⋠T⋡\n\nHello, Moops. I know that there have been several unsuccessful attempts to \"un-deprecate\" the Daily Mail. I am unaware of any successful efforts about any deprecated sources. Any such effort would need to take place at Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, and you would need to furnish convincing evidence that \"the leopard has changed its spots\". Cullen328 (talk)\n\nIs that to assume that any past discussions were exhaustive and definitive? And that the editors involved are all the same now, or that socks were not involved? I see some sources deprecated nearly a decade ago, and it just makes me think that it is interesting that these deprecations do not automatically have some kind of \"sunset provision\" for the deprecation. It would seem to me to be prudent to have a clause or provision of that type so that new consensus would need to be had every 5 years on each source from the date of deprecation or something. :) — Moops ⋠T⋡\n\n@Moops: This type of thing would probably be better off furhter discussed at WP:RSN or even perhaps WT:RS/P than here at the Teahouse. -- Marchjuly (talk)\n\nMakes sense. TY — Moops ⋠T⋡\n\nMy article Draft:ESPNcricinfo Awards was declined for not containing required reliable sources. But, my article already had required references at Draft:ESPNcricinfo Awards#Awards by Year that's why, I couldn't figure out the actual reason. May I know what was the actual reason for which it was declined.? Perfectodefecto (talk)\n\nIs this about Draft:ESPNcricinfo Awards?Special:Diff/1127743368 is the version declined. Which has one source and wass the award itself be cited. So there is no independent sourcing to establish notability. The current version may pass as it does have additional references, though I have not reviewed them.Slywriter (talk)\n\n@Perfectodefecto Your article draft is mainly about who has won the Awards, which is clearly important BUT not as important for Wikipedia's purposes as first showing that the Award itself is notable. Your could highlight those sources that are WP:INDEPENDENT of the rewarding body and themselves reliable by using the {{AfC comment}} template at the top of your draft to highlight the (say) WP:THREE sources that best illustrate this. Making the reviewer's work as easy as possible is the best way to go. Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\n@Perfectodefecto The decline notice actually says \"This draft's references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article (emphasis added). The blue text in the original notice, which I repeated here, discusses Wikipedia's concept of notability, which Slywriter and Mike Turnbull also discussed in their comments. Any of the similarly formatted blue words or phrases are clickable links, with lots more information. David10244 (talk)\n\nWhy did you CENSOR Robert Malone and his truth revealing information. You scrubbed his book. Because of that, I will NOT contribute and I do NOT trust you and I will not visit anymore. CENSORSHIP is NOT constitutional, helpful and is very damaging. ( Reference the amount of harm being discovered with regard to the shoved on us shots). Maybe you don’t want our constitution. Then go find a better country. 67.214.28.210 (talk)\n\nWelcome to the Teahouse, IP editor. I'm not sure who your comments are supposed to be addressed to and I don't know who Robert Malone is, but please remember that most Wikipedia editors don't live in the US and telling us to \"find a better country\" doesn't make much sense. Cordless Larry (talk)\n\nI expect that the original thread starter meant Robert W. Malone. I assume it because it's now a hot topic in social networks. I don't understand however what the editor calls \"censorship\" because the article about the person exists and reflects the person's opinion. Philip Torchinsky (talk)\n\nCordless Larry \"Find a better country\": quick, everybody shift one country to the west... David10244 (talk)\n\nSince I have no idea which Robert Malone or WP-article you are talking about, I have no idea. And per your statement you will not read this, but Merry Christmas anyway! Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nI think he's talking about Robert W. Malone, because he's the only one who's dead. QuickQuokka [⁠talk • contribs]\n\n@QuickQuokka, \"In December 2022, Malone was reinstated on Twitter\". Are we talking about the same guy? Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nWhoops, sorry, I got confused. QuickQuokka [⁠talk • contribs]\n\nRobert W. Malone has had some edit-warring, and there are extensive discussions at Talk (including archives), so not clear where you see or suspect censorship. Any article pertaining to COVID and vaccination is hotly debated. Again, not censorship. David notMD (talk)\n\nWikipedia doesn't follow any country's constitution, and it is not required to. But presumably the OP won't see this either. David10244 (talk)\n\nHi All, I tried to create a new article about an Indian composer I admire. He composed close to 5000 songs. But he does not have wikipedia page. I created Draft:Sai Madhukar and asked for review. Feedback is all the sources I quoted are not reliable. I can only quote the sources where something is written about this person. He published hundreds of songs in YouTube, but youtube is not reliable source. Same thing with Spotify which is not reliable as well. Honestly, I am not sure how else I can proceed with this article. Any advice is helpful. Thanks. Waimea92 (talk)\n\n@Waimea92: Being prolific doesn't necessarily equate to being notable. Exactly which criteria in WP:MUSICBIO or WP:COMPOSER does Sai Madhukar meet?\n\nSee also Wikipedia:Golden rule. We need reliable sources that are independent of him, not associated with him, and those sources need to cover him in some depth, not giving trivial mentions. ~Anachronist (talk)\n\nThank you Anachronist for the details. I will keep this in mind. Waimea92 (talk)\n\nI've been asked to clarify why the draft was deleted. The deletion had nothing to do with the reliability of sources or the noteworthiness of the subject.\n\nThe draft was deleted because the bulk of the text was a direct copy of one of the sources (https://nettv4u.com/celebrity/tamil/music-director/sai-madhukar). You can't just paste material like that, it's a violation of copyright. That material was present from the first revision, and its removal wouldn't have left much of an article behind. — Cyrius|✎\n\nThanks Cyrius for the clarification. I spent a good amount of time researching and creating the page. Is there a way to recover the content of the deleted page so that I can create a better version? Waimea92 (talk)\n\n@Waimea92 - try Category:Wikipedia administrators willing to provide copies of deleted articles, but do note that the copyvio deletion likely affects whether an admin will recover it. (You must not copy text directly from sources. That's plagiarism and copyright infringement.) casualdejekyll\n\nGot it, Thanks for your response. Waimea92 (talk)\n\nI recently inserted links to some of the pages on Wiki and someone with an obvious slant, bias or whatever did not like what we posted. Everything I linked was in context and from a credible news website. I follow Florida Politics and always follow several state-centric news sites—Florida politics, florida daily, the floridian, the capitolist. This person below stuck his opinion where it didnt belong and undid the work that I have done for an apparent biased reason. How do I get my work to be linked again, and is there a way to prevent this from happening again?\n\nSee below:\n\nHello, I'm Squared.Circle.Boxing. I wanted to let you know that one or more of your recent contributions have been undone because they appeared to be promotional. Advertising and using Wikipedia as a \"soapbox\" are against Wikipedia policy and not permitted; Wikipedia articles should be written objectively, using independent sources, and from a neutral perspective. Take a look at the welcome page to learn more about Wikipedia. Thank you. — 2.O.Boxing 13:44, 16 December 2022 (UTC)\n\nIf (big IF) you're not trying to promote the writers of the articles or the publication itself, the links you added are still absolutely pointless. The content is already adequately cited. I also noticed you use we in your edit summaries. How many people use your account? – 2.O.Boxing 13:44, 16 December 2022 (UTC)\n\nYes, your \"big if\" has been realized. I follow Florida Politics, particularly DC-related officials, and read a couple of Florida-centric news websites —Florida Daily, Florida Politics, The Floridian, and The Capitolist. So what you are saying is that I cannot link to any of these websites because YOU feel I am promoting them? Tell me again how I benefit from this?\n\nI am the only one adding to the pages. The links I have added are not pointless, they give complete context. As far as using \"we,\" I edit and contribute with my 2 and 4-year-olds who sit next to me on the couch. So, \"we\" did some contributing. Just curious. It appears you may have an agenda. Your \"soapbox\" comment speaks to a hidden or biased agenda. Micheller1202 (talk) 03:56, 20 December 2022 (UTC)\n\n— Preceding unsigned comment added by Micheller1202 (talk • contribs)\n\nMicheller1202, you may want to slow down. Don't accuse other editors of bias or agendas without evidence. There is nothing particularly harsh about the comment left on your talk page. Pretty standard for someone only posting one source across multiple pages, which looks like spam to other editors.\n\nAdditionally that one source seems to fail at being a reliable source and looks to be a glorified partisan blog. :Also, stop using \"we\" as it will cause you trouble every time. Slywriter (talk)\n\nUnderstood. The source in question is very reliable and credible news source in Florida. I wouldn't follow them if they weren't. There are other sites that i will be using that are more and less credible than the one i started with. As far as using \"we\" I got that. Micheller1202 (talk)\n\nMicheller1202, it may be read by a lot of people you know. It may be read by many resident of Florida. That is very different from being a reliable source on Wikipedia. You said you read The Capitolist, you may want to also read their wikipedia article. This source gives off a similar vibe. Slywriter (talk)\n\nInteresting. I didn't know about the Capitolist. Thanks for pointing it out. Micheller1202 (talk)\n\n@ Someone undid your work because they are biased? How, exactly, did you determine that? David10244 (talk)\n\nMicheller1202, you simply cannot use glorified blogs promoting fringe concepts like nonexistent nuclear microreactors. You cannot refer to yourself as \"we\" just because your toddlers are nearby. Wikipedia accounts are for one person and one person only and there is no toddler exception. Most importantly, you cannot accuse another of having an obvious slant, bias without presenting rock solid evidence, which you have failed to do. The other editor has made over 32,000 edits and you have made 27 edits. Admittedly, edit count does not always equal competence, but you should ask yourself whether or not you really know what you are doing, and whether or not it is wise of you to be so aggressive. Cullen328 (talk)\n\nAnd I've just reverted more of this editor's work (as have a couple others). As I said in my initial message...even if not for promotion, your edits are still utterly pointless. You're adding citations to content that is already cited. Folks can scream AGF at me if they like, but I do find it funny how the user shares a name with somebody who writes for the website that this editor loves citing. Might explain the \"we\" part a bit better. – 2.O.Boxing\n\nI'm trying to present the text of a Linear B inscription (User:UndercoverClassicist/PY Ta 641). The inscription is over four (long) lines - epigraphic conventions mean that it's important that each line is clearly presented as it is (i.e., you can't just break onto a new line arbitrarily like you can in prose), and ideally that such features as the relative spacing between characters are preserved. For example, the first line doesn't 'start' until the far right of the tablet, and it's conventional to display these characters physically above the ones in the line below that they sit over.\n\nThe source for the inscription (https://damos.hf.uio.no/just/4972) seems to just scale the font down - I don't think that's an option here?\n\nWhat's the best way to handle this - ideally preserving those requirements, but at a minimum just a) making sure that the original lines are clear to the reader and b) not looking hideous?\n\nThanks in advance! UndercoverClassicist (talk)\n\nThis is a weasel answer: do you really need to quote the transliterated text? I'm guessing that the number of Wikipedia readers who can read linear B is rather small, and this is ultimately an encyclopaedia for general users. Unless the actual linear B text is of critical concern to the reader, it might be better to summarise what's important about this particular clay tablet, and direct the reader to the original source if they want to look at the text? The main job is to explain why this tablet is a notable part of Cretan archaeology. Remember, we're a tertiary source, not a secondary. It's our job to say that a text has been important in the deciphering of an ancient language, not to describe in detail how the deciphering was done (in my personal opinion!). Elemimele (talk)\n\nI see your point - I think it is important, or at least beneficial. The reason the tablet was significant to the decipherment is that it contains the Linear B (=Greek, =English) words for things like 'tripod', followed by pictures of the selfsame tripod - and so proved almost beyond doubt that Linear B was indeed Greek. Most English speakers will be able to see that from a transcription, especially as LB is conventionally transcribed in Latin characters (so e.g. 'tripod' comes out as 'ti-ri-po-de') - it's not essential for them to be able to see how the argument worked for themselves, but it would be nice. The inscription is also rather short (four lines).\n\nMy point of comparison was this article (IM 67118) which translates a 25-line inscription - that translation does add significantly to the article, and I think the same would be true here. UndercoverClassicist (talk)\n\nEDIT: see also Dialogue between a Man and His God, which transliterates and translates a rather long Akkadian inscription - though here I'm less convinced that the whole thing is of massive value. UndercoverClassicist (talk)\n\n@UndercoverClassicist You are already using an image thumbnail to show the tablet, which any reader who is interested in the detail will click on to view at full scale. Why don't you edit that picture to include the text as well? Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\nThat might work!

The Bestagon (previously Quantum XYZ) (chat)\n\nI am very confused with this article because some reliable source says that she was born in 17 September and some other reliable source says she was born in 20 September.\n\nSources which says she was born in 17 September - Jagran Josh,[1] Moneycontrol,[2] Greater Kashmir (Press Release),[3] Hindustan Times[4] and FHM (India).[5]\n\nSources which says she was born in 20 September - The Chenab Times (Press Release).[6]\n\nAnd as of The Chenab Times, \"As per different media reports, her birthdate was different, while confirming her birthday to The Chenab Times, Sargam Koushal said that she was born on 20th September 1990 to GS Koushal and Meena Koushal in Jammu.

The Bestagon (previously Quantum XYZ) (chat)\n\nReferences\n\nFortunately it's not our job to decide which is correct. If multiple sources disagree, then assuming we can't neatly divide them into reliable sources saying X and unreliable ones saying Y, we have to say that sources disagree, and her birth date might be any one of the alternatives. Elemimele (talk)\n\nLordVoldemort728, I've had the same problem with the article Teikō Shiotani. A pile of what look like reliable sources confidently give one date; another pile of the same confidently give a date that differs by two days. I have never come across any source that notes that there has been any disagreement, let alone any source that attempts to refute the claim that it was this or that date. I've dealt with this matter briefly in the article; and, mostly in order to avoid confusion among future editors, I've dealt with it at much greater length in the article's talk page. -- Hoary (talk)\n\nSlightly off topic: I recently learned from Tom Scott that one can simply, given enough money, hire a researcher to answer weird hyperspecific questions themselves.

Although the article was accepted, I saw that a proposal for deletion on the basis of non-notability now appears on the page. From my understanding of the notability standard, the most important consideration is that \"it has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.\" My bibliography for Mr. Gigger lists nearly fifty articles from national and regional newspapers over nearly as many years. I have not cited all of them in the article itself but could certainly add a bibliography section to the article to demonstrate compliance with the standard. I'm confused about how this process works and what I should do to prevent deletion. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Iguana0000 (talk)\n\nYou seem to misunderstand what \"significant coverage means\". IT does not refer to being mentioned in many sources, it refers to being covered in detail in a few sources. ― Blaze WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545\n\nIn that case I definitely do not understand. The majority of the articles I am referring to are articles ABOUT the subject, not articles where a minor reference to him is made. In a plurality of cases the subject's name appears in the title of the article. Can you clarify your comment in light of this? I am still confused. Iguana0000 (talk)\n\nI have asked the person who PRODed your article for further explanation as well as the person who accepted it from AFC. ― Blaze WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545\n\n@Bkissin and Kershatz: Pinging PRODer and AFC accepter (since those who accept it via AFC think it has a >50% chance of surviving AFD/PROD). ― Blaze WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545\n\nWhile I was originally tempted to decline this article for the same reasons Kershatz mentioned (high school band directors are rarely considered notable, and the Conflict of Interest here made me concerned that the article could be written in a neutral point of view), there are enough in-depth secondary sources about the subject to meet the general notability guideline, hence the reason I accepted. I think the original author did a good job at finding sources to bolster the notability claim. Bkissin (talk)\n\nI disagree. I have no doubt that Mr Gigger was a wonderful person and educator, and clearly he was locally renowned , but that’s just it. The coverage is mostly local and some of the article is original research. I don’t think “the record for the most victories in the Los Angeles Unified School District Annual Band and Drill Team Championships” is a notable thing, and the article looks like a tribute page. Kershatz (talk)\n\n@Iguana0000: Offline sources are allowed but it's best if you can link the source to a site which doesn't violate copyright (links to copyright violations are disallowed). For example, I googled your first reference \"Popular Retired San Fernando High School Band Director Dies\" and found https://sanfernandosun.com/2016/11/16/popular-retired-san-fernando-high-school-band-director-dies/. It can be linked in the citation with |url=https://sanfernandosun.com/2016/11/16/popular-retired-san-fernando-high-school-band-director-dies/. Advantages include that it's easier to check that the source supports the article claims, easier to find additional material (both for interested readers and editors looking to expand the article), and in this case easier to estimate notability. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThanks! Can you clarify what you mean by \"it's best if you can link the source to a site which doesn't violate copyright (links to copyright violations are disallowed).\" What is meant by a source that violates copyright? Iguana0000 (talk)\n\nHello, Iguana0000, if someone has a personal website or blog and uploads scans of contemporary newspaper articles, that is a copyright violation, and links to such web pages are not permitted. Cullen328 (talk)\n\nOK thanks is there some suggestion that this was done in this wikipedia article? Iguana0000 (talk)\n\nI think that was generalized advice to avoid doing something that new editors do from time to time when trying to support offline sources. Cullen328 (talk)\n\n@Iguana0000: Yes, it was general advice for possible future links. Most works are copyrighted, meaning that others aren't allowed to publish copies of the work without permission, or they have to satisfy certain license conditions to publish it, or only publish a tiny excerpt of the work. Some websites violate copyright, meaning that they publish copyrighted works illegally. Wikipedia does not allow links to such illegal copies. See Wikipedia:Copyrights#Linking to copyrighted works. The official website of the original publisher like https://sanfernandosun.com/2016/11/16/popular-retired-san-fernando-high-school-band-director-dies/ can be assumed to not violate copyright so it's fine to link them. In theory they could have copied the article illegally from somewhere without saying it but Western commercial companies don't want to be sued so they rarely do that. Some non-Western countries don't enforce copyright much in practice, and many private websites don't know or care about copyrights. By the way, Wikipedia itself is strict about not violating copyright in our own articles and images. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nOK I added |url= tags to all of the (more recent) articles for which there is online access. LA Times is a little tricky I guess as it gives you X number of free articles per Y so if someone wanted to access all the citations they'd hit a paywall at X+1. Is there anything else I should be doing for the articles for which no online version exists? Iguana0000 (talk)\n\nIguana0000, for offline newspaper articles, you want to include the article title, author(s) if known, name of the newspaper (wikilinked), date of publication, page number and city if it is not part of the name of the newspaper. Cullen328 (talk)\n\nOK thanks have made additional edits along the lines suggested here. Still confused though regarding Proposal for Deletion. If the subject of this article has not \"received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject\" then ... I'm not sure who has. The proposal for deletion notice says \"You may remove this message if you improve the article or otherwise object to deletion for any reason\" but I'm not clear on what is actually meant by that. Iguana0000 (talk)\n\n@Iguana0000 I believe you can ignore the paywall. Sources need to be accessible, not necessarily free. A source that requires a trip to a specific library to view, for example, is allowed (as long as it is properly cited). David10244 (talk)\n\nOK, I read the comments by @Bkissin and @Kershatz above and remain confused. As I understand the notability standard, \"A topic is presumed to be suitable for a stand-alone article or list when it has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.\" AND does not \"violate what Wikipedia is not\". I believe those two conditions have been met. If they have not I am curious as to why.\n\nThere is a section in \"what Wikipedia is not\" that states \"Memorials. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must satisfy Wikipedia's notability requirements. Wikipedia is not the place to memorialize deceased friends, relatives, acquaintances, or others who do not meet such requirements.\" This seems a bit circular but again does not appear to apply as the topic has received significant coverage etc. etc. I am happy to prepare a full bibliography and perhaps I should; there are many more articles about the subject than I have included in the article thus far.\n\nIf in fact the actual standard in use is subjective judgements by individuals that's fine but then it really should be more clearly stated. For instance, saying I don’t think “the record for the most victories in the Los Angeles Unified School District Annual Band and Drill Team Championships” is a notable thing seems inconsistent with the notability standard as written. I imagine that the word 'notability' itself is a bit of a misnomer and the source of some confusion; it would be clearer to call the standard 'extensively documented' or something of the sort as that lends itself less to subjective judgements. In any case I would appreciate any clarification of and reconciliation between the policies as written and the discussion above.

That website states A portion of our content is sponsored by advertisers and we cover music released by the record labels with which we partner. In other words, it is a \"pay to play\" scheme, not independent, and reviews like that are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia.

Humulator (talk)\n\nIt would help if you could provide the article and the source, as people on here can often work wonders when they're given the full facts, but they're abysmal at mind reading. - X201 (talk)\n\nSpecifically Toronto Pearson International Airport#Public transit, the sources(look at 145 for specific) are outdated, but they are already archived. There's no triple archive option as far as im aware. Humulator (talk)\n\nA website can be archived an unlimited number of times, but only one of those archived versions (often referred to as \"captures\" or \"snapshots\") can be the target of a link from a reference at any given time. When you click on the archive link in the citation, you'll see near the top-left corner of the page a line saying that that particular page has been captured 352 times by that archiving service. If you click that line, you'll be shown a calendar allowing you to select a capture from a different date. Find one that has the updated information, and edit the citation in the article to put the relevant data from the new version into the |archive-url= and |archive-date= fields.\n\nIf there is no archive capture that is sufficiently up-to-date, you can force a new one to be taken at this page.

Twintwinkle (talk)\n\n@HitroMilanese: COuld you explain to this user why you declined their draft? (not meaning to be rude) ― Blaze WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545\n\nA sufficient reason for declining the draft is that it fails to establish its subject as notable.

There is guidance at Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Guide#Revival. The most important part is finding other editors to help revive the project - the first step gives suggestions of where to look. If you can't find other people to help, the project will most likely fall inactive again. 199.208.172.35 (talk)\n\nJanosabel, you asked on the project talk page, \"Why did the community of advocates abandon it?\". Members of the project aren't necessarily advocates of UBI, if that's how you're thinking WikiProjects work. As explained at Wikipedia:WikiProject, WikiProjects bring together editors to improve encyclopedic coverage of a topic area, which is different from advocating for the topic itself. Cordless Larry (talk)\n\nThanks, Larry, for pointing out the distinction between editors of a project and advocates.\n\nBy the way, I find your Wikipedia name funny. Any \"story\" behind the choice? Janosabel (talk)\n\nYes, there is a story but it's not very interesting. See the answer to question 4 at Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cordless Larry#Questions for the candidate, Janosabel. Cordless Larry (talk)\n\nHi all! I'm pretty new to this so this may be a stupid question, but I was wondering if list articles require citations, and if so, for what kinds of information? I wasn't sure if citations are required on the list article itself, given that the other articles linked within the list may have their own citations. Do the items in a list require a citation to prove that they belong in the list (eg. if I wanted to include a species in a list article about organisms from a given region, do I need to add a citation proving that species is present in the region to justify it being added to the list)?\n\nMy question was prompted by this article, which links extensively to other well referenced articles but has no citations of its own, though several items in the list have no wikipedia articles of their own nor any citation to prove they exist. Moving beyond the items on the list, the sentence \"The FC Andorra not play in Andorran leagues, but played in the Spanish leagues\" [sic] strikes me as requiring some kind of citation - am I correct in thinking this? Would this be an appropriate time to use the more citations required message box and/or mark the article as a stub?\n\nI apologise if I'm not making much sense, my written language skills can be a little wonky sometimes, but hopefully you can understand what I'm talking about :) I'm just not quite sure what is warranted in these kinds of situations and don't want to go around marking articles as stubs or needing further citation if it's not needed. Ethmostigmus (talk)\n\n@Ethmostigmus Welcome to the Teahouse. The general advice on stand-alone lists is at WP:STAND. Specifically, where there are red-linked entries (so no associated article), citations are required: see WP:CSC, which is part of that page. Of course, not all list articles are perfectly inline with the guidelines! Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\nHi, it seems that Wikipedia caches the image of Wikimedia Commons on their own systems. However, sometimes this only partially updates, such as the resolution increase of an image. I know that you can purge the cache of Wikipedia articles by using action=purge as an URL parameter, which is also possible on Commons, but not for cached images of Commons on Wikipedia. How can I do this? PhotographyEdits (talk)\n\n@PhotographyEdits I'm not sure if I've understood your issue correctly but I know that there can be problems related to your own browser not showing an updated image when you view articles, even after the image has changed on Commons.

Shantavira|feed me\n\nHello, Nesoul, and welcome to the Teahouse. I echo Shantaviraj in asking what it is you need help with. But I would point out that, as well as lacking proper references, the draft is written in a completely inappropriate style for an encyclopaedia, which is what this is. An article speaks with Wikipedia's voice, not the voice of the subject or people connected with the subject. An article should summarize what people wholly unconnected with the subject have published about it: that's all.\n\nI also observe that your user name Nesoul, is close to the name of the proprietor, Nnamdi E.S. Okoye; which leads me to ask: are you Okoye? If you are, you should declare this fact on your user page (see WP:COI), and bear in mind that this makes the already difficult task of writing an article much more difficult, because you are likely to find it hard to write with a sufficiently neutral point of view for Wikipedia. ColinFine (talk)\n\n@Nesoul Did you take that picture of yourself? It's listed as \"own work\".

Do you mean you’ll edit the sources to be listed correctly?\n\n3. I don’t believe Sagittarius A can properly be used in the article because it’s not the same type of black hole. Astronomical472 (talk)\n\n2. I have already changed the citations. I noticed that you are using source editor, so next time do <ref></ref> to do citations.\n\n3. I wikilinked those two articles as those were the first black holes that came to mind. (Rest is a bit of a rant) What I was trying to say was that you should look through and see how they are formatted. Generally, when I write articles, I go around other articles to see if I missed anything or if I did something weird. Two articles I did this with was Bee Branch Creek (Iowa) and Manuma, reading through creek and bird articles respectively. The Bee Branch article is a pretty odd-ball creek as it was daylighted, but even then I found it useful to read other river articles.\n\n✶Mitch199811✶\n\nFor next time you want to do this, I would go to WP:Peer review or the wikiproject's page (in this case wp:astronomy). ✶Mitch199811✶\n\nThanks so much! Can it be published to Wikipedia yet under the Black Hole’s name, or should I wait? Astronomical472 (talk)\n\nI am going to put in an AfC template, and when you click a button on it the article is submitted. After that someone will come by and make sure that it is ready for the mainspace. Currently, there is a 4 month backlog so it might take a bit. ✶Mitch199811✶\n\nThanks so much! Just to make it clear: it hasn’t been submitted for review yet? Astronomical472 (talk)\n\nNo, the box would be yellow and say review pending. ✶Mitch199811✶\n\nAlright, thank you! Astronomical472 (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nI have already contributed some articles till now(currently, these articles are awaiting for review), I'm enjoying it.

My advice would be to read WP:BACKWARD first and judge which ones to take on based on your interests and the available sources. Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\n@Mike Turnbull Thank You so much for suggesting these... I will try to cover them. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Perfectodefecto (talk • contribs)\n\nI would amend the forward method that WP:BACKWARD suggests slightly, Mike Turnbull. From what I've seen, most drafts and new articles fail on two grounds: Either they fail to assert notability, or fail to have adequate sources. While the forward method described *should* take care of the adequate sources portion, it is expecting that the notability assertion will happen automatically. So I would add to the suggestion: Read the notability policy that applies to the article you select from WP:RA. Find an assertion of notability in the appropriate sources. Start writing the draft with the assertion of notability, then continue as per BACKWARD's suggestion. UtherSRG (talk)\n\nHello, Perfecto and welcome to the Teahouse. The other thing to say is that we have thousands and thousands of existing articles which are seriously deficient, and would benefit from some TLC. ColinFine (talk)\n\nUtherSRG Now, I got it. Thank You so much for these suggestions.\n\nThis draft always gets denied but, I'm trying to figure out what this artist does not have. Does Wikipedia need more sources on the artist? or Billboard charting records?

Which criteria of WP:MUSICBIO does this artist meet? GoingBatty (talk)\n\nThe first criteria about articles. Thank you so much by the way. TheFirstLyricGeek (talk)\n\n@TheFirstLyricGeek I looked at the first few sources in your draft. They were all based on interviews with the rapper, which is no use for demonstrating he is notable, since they are not WP:INDEPENDENT of him. The reviewers are not looking for what he has managed to pump out as PR but what people not connected with him have said, unprompted. Re-structure the draft so the best independent sources are highlighted by being the first citations and it may succeed. Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\nThank you! I will do that and see how things go. Very much appreciated. I like this job. Trial and Error. TheFirstLyricGeek (talk)\n\nso, I just moved the article Løren to its current name but when I did, there was a message saying I have to clear some redirects etc. What are these and how do I do it? Also, I don't want it as a redirect, so how do I make it a main article? Thank you in advance - fenia🖤tellmehi\n\nHello, Fisforfenia, and welcome to the Teahouse. If you go to Løren (musician), and pick \"What links here\" from the sidebar, it will give you a link of articles and other pages that contain links to that article. It shows you that nearly all of them, unsurprisingly, link via Loren (musician). Since that redirect will remain, it is not essential to correct those links, but it is neater if you do so.\n\nOne by one, you go to the articles that link via the redirect, and edit each to make the link point directly to the new name, rather than via the redirect. I don't know if there is a tool or a bot that can help. ColinFine (talk)\n\nHiya fenia! Welcome to The Teahouse. Each article has on it sideboard a link for \"What links here\". In this case, that would be Special:WhatLinksHere/Løren_(musician). Hitting that, you can see all the incoming links to the article.

Universalsunset (talk)\n\n@Universalsunset Different people do not have different sourcing requirements. Many of the English Wikipedia's 6.5 million articles were written when standards were looser, and may have never been reviewed. Please see other stuff exists which should help. David10244 (talk)\n\nUniversalsunset, if a source merely has a single datum about a subject but is reliable, then the source can be cited for that datum. But a congeries of such sources doesn't add up to notability. (Please read and digest WP:PERSON.) Thank you for pointing out that the article Papa John Creach cites IMDb. It shouldn't do so. -- Hoary (talk)\n\nUniversalsunset, mentions (or more-than-mentions) in Wikipedia are worthless for this purpose. So is an IMDb entry.

Please read and digest WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS (primarily about deletion debates, but relevant here too).\n\nYou ask: \"Is there a reason that different people have different requirements?\" They do not.

I’m new here and tried to get rid of a redirect from Naked black hole -> Naked singularity, plus add some content. After writing an entire (short) article on a Naked black hole, my article was automatically reverted and I got an automated message from LilianaUwU saying it was reverted because it (pretty much) wasn’t useful. I worked on the article for a while, how can I get this back? Astronomical472 (talk)\n\nFixed it, I just reverted the reversion! Still might be a programming glitch though. Astronomical472 (talk)\n\n@astronomical472 (cc @lilianauwu):\n\nyou may retrieve it from here. however, this article would not be suitable for wikipedia as it was incorrectly formatted and had only one reference. you need at least two or three independent, reliable sources that cover these black holes significantly. make sure to read help:your first article for further advice. lettherebedarklight晚安\n\n2 independent sources and it’s acceptable? Astronomical472 (talk)\n\nYeah, @Astronomical472, the article is mostly unsourced. I've put your work at User:Astronomical472/Naked black hole so you can work on it. LilianaUwU (talk / contribs)\n\nthis is not a programming glitch, this is an intentional revert. i have reverted your edits again,as your article is not up to wikipedia standards. lettherebedarklight晚安\n\nHello, Astronomical472. In theory, an astrophysics topic could be notable and eligible for a Wikipedia article with just two sources, if for example there was an entire book published about the topic by a major academic press, and a detailed article published about the topic in a prestigious physics journal. This thought experiment leads to the obvious question: Why would such a book and such a journal article be ignored by other notable academics? The whole scenario is highly implausible. Cullen328 (talk)\n\nAre you suggesting I shouldn’t make the article? Slightly confused. Astronomical472 (talk)\n\nAstronomical472, I've had a look at your sandbox, and it's unclear to me whether the intended subject is the concept of \"naked black hole\", or a particular such black hole named \"VB3 1715+425\". Maproom (talk)\n\nAre you suggesting I should make an article for the specific naked black hole? Astronomical472 (talk)\n\n@Astronomical472, Not to put words in Maproom's mouth, but I believe the question is which one you intend, rather than suggesting anything. David10244 (talk)\n\nAh, I see.

This line has no scholarly interpretation, only a copy paste from primary source Brahma Vaivarta Purana. Is it following the wiki rules? Thanks. Sigmaron (talk)\n\n@Sigmaron The link your supplied was to the guidance that Wikipedia must not include original research, by which we mean something that only the editor adding the material knows, or thinks they know, and cannot be verified from published sources. The BvP is a published source, so it can be verified and it is not original research to use material cited to it. While Wikipedia does prefer WP:SECONDARY sources, we also use primary ones as well and it is not forbidden to do so. Indeed, when explaining the history of some thinking, an article may cite the primary source and then move on to cite the secondary ones that have discussed it, thereby showing that it had a notable impact. Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\n@Michael D. Turnbull thanks for your comment. BvP is an old scripture. The writer has mentioned BvP but has not commented on the justification of BvP calling baidya as shudra. I mean no interpretation of this is provided. The writer has just mentioned that BvB mentioned Baidya as shudra. So the main source is BvP. Is BvP a scholarary source or peer reviewed. So is it reliable? Sigmaron (talk)\n\n@Sigmaron, my interpretation is that Wikipedia is not saying \"X is so because the BvP says so\". Rather, Wikipedia is saying that \"the BvD says X is so\", leaving the reader to decide what reliance they place on the BvD. Moreover, the article is contrasting this with another old source (Bṛhaddharma Puraṇa) that says something different, and does not assert which (if either) is \"correct.\" Similar considerations apply to most ancient texts. {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 51.194.245.235 (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nI found that Baita Huli article already exists on Wikipedia, which is written in Cebuano language.\n\nI'm native to this place and, I have sufficient independent sources to create an article on Baita Huli mountain.

Hard to mention you since I'm only using a phone, but thank you.Bmjc98 (talk)\n\nThis article Chinese honorifics had the best and most complete information gathered and organized until less than three hours ago. Many people used this as reference or to study, the content was perfectly correct. Almost everything was erased on 21 December 2022, at 16:56 (UTC). There's something that can be done to recover the previous content? 179.127.106.32 (talk)\n\nHi IP editor, welcome to the Teahouse. The content was removed as a result of a talk page discussion. Here is a link so you can read it yourself: Talk:Chinese honorifics#Sources missing. If you want to see the content restored, I would recommend making a new post in that discussion, offering to help find sources for the information. 199.208.172.35 (talk)\n\nThe requirement that Wikipedia content be referenced to reliable published sources is a core content policy and is non-negotiable. Please read Verifiability. Since that content has been challenged as unreferenced, it is the obligation of anyone who wants to add it back to properly reference it. Perhaps it could be posted on some other website in the interim. Cullen328 (talk)\n\nFYI - The removal and restoration and removal and restoration and removal of about 95% of the article has been going on since March 2021. Most of that content had been added by User:Wikilucki in 2019, editor no longer active since 2020. David notMD (talk)\n\nI recently had my first article rejected for citing IMDB, but the IMDB citing guidlines indicate that it is a valid source for writing credits (though there are no WGA badges on the IMDB cite anymore). But then I've noticed that crediting tables are simply unsourced? So I suppose I am a bit confused - the guidelines say you can use IMDB for writing credits, but my article was rejected for that, and I have observed that many crediting tables are unsourced. Anyone have any thoughts? Should I just use Template:Cite_AV_media? If that is the case, maybe the IMDB sourcing should be moved to wholly unacceptable? MEQCallaghan (talk)\n\nWP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS is not a valid argument here. Sungodtemple (talk • contribs)\n\n@Sungodtemple: The OP was not complaining that other articles exist while theirs was declined... they are asking for advice on how to proceed. UtherSRG (talk)\n\n...and that the guidelines don't seem to be in alignment with current actions. UtherSRG (talk)\n\nSorry, it's hard to keep up sometimes since I'm new to this - should I be typing out replies or just linking to pages without providing any context? MEQCallaghan (talk)\n\nWelcome to the Teahouse, @MEQCallaghan:! Yes, this is definitely conflicting messaging. I suggest asking the declining reviewer politely about the discrepancy between the guidelines their actions, and offer the suggestions you proffered here. You can also post a query on Wikipedia talk:Citing IMDb to see if they have any advice, too. UtherSRG (talk)\n\nCheers @UtherSRG, I will do that! MEQCallaghan (talk)\n\n@MEQCallaghan: I think your focus with this draft should be finding and adding more reliable sources, rather than the edge case of whether IMDb is passable as a source here. Whether reliable or not, it won't contribute towards notability. The Hollywood Reporter is a good source and I haven't properly assessed the others, but I know with a couple more of that calibre I would be confident as a reviewer to accept the draft whether IMDb was cited or not. Since we have a backlog of several thousand drafts and only a couple of dozen reviewers who haven't burnt out, reviewers have very little time to give nuanced feedback, but here the reviewer has provided a general reason for the decline with a separate comment that IMDb is not generally reliable. If a rationale confuses you, you can ask the reviewer directly. As an additional note, Wikipedia:Citing IMDb is an essay, not a guideline (which would carry more weight). Essays vary in status among the community from uncontroversial and widely accepted all the way down to the viewpoint of just one volunteer. This one is somewhere in the middle. — Bilorv (talk)\n\nI agree. I often give the following advice: First, read the appropriate notability policy, which in this case is WP:FILMMAKER. Understand the criteria and see if you can find one that is supported by appropriate sources. Then, ensure that the draft asserts that notability. All the rest will follow from here. UtherSRG (talk)\n\nOh, even better... this is the quote from WP:IMDB: WP:Citing IMDb describes two exceptions, both of which do not require citations because the film itself is implied to be the primary source... so you are fine the leave the IMDB citations off and probably use the {{cite AV media}} instead like you suggested. UtherSRG (talk)\n\n@UtherSRG: for credits, as the essay says, the primary source is taken implicitly as the reference and is rarely cited explicitly. You do not need to use {{cite AV media}} in this case. — Bilorv (talk)\n\nI am currently trying to make the wikipedia article on the Kennemer Opstand look better, and I just added an infobox. However, I would like to add some flagicons, but seeing as this is quite a niche subject, they do not exist. Can I add my own? How do I do this? Any other tips on the article are greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! GeneralCraft65 (talk)\n\nHi GeneralCraft65! First, note that MOS:INFOBOXFLAG indicates that flag icons are not normally used in infoboxes, but military/political conflicts are an exception, so some flagicons might be welcome here. You can upload images to Wikimedia Commons for use in Wikipedia, but they have to be freely licensed—easiest if it's your own work and you're happy to freely license it. For flags specifically, they're often public domain (so freely licensed) as they're not complex enough to be copyrighted e.g. File:Flag of Turkey.svg. If you can make an image of the flag and upload it, I think you could just embed it in the infobox at the right pixel size as you would add any other image to an article (see Help:Pictures). You might get more expert help if you ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Flag Template or Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Heraldry and vexillology. — Bilorv (talk)\n\nHow do you add the major intersection (exit list) section to a page? 2601:244:4081:500:2533:DB97:798B:6ADE (talk)\n\nHello. I have been a Wikipedia editor for over 13 years and I have never heard of \"major intersection\" or \"exit list\" before. Please clarify. Cullen328 (talk)\n\nPossibly a reference to articles such as Interstate_93#Exit_list. Shantavira|feed me\n\nYou may want to read MOS:RJL. If you have trouble with the seemingly rather complicated guidelines there, the folks at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Highways are probably best positioned to provide you with useful assistance. Deor (talk)\n\nI've recently discovered them; one wouldn't unless one looks at those particular articles. I see two types. To take an arbitrary example, see the article on U.S. Route 50. You'll see that there's a outline-type list (indented as it gets more specific). But now, follow a link from that article to US Route 50 in some state--again, an arbitrary example, U.S. Route 50 in Missouri, and there's a rather more elaborate table. The handful I've seen do seem to follow a standard pattern. Uporządnicki (talk)\n\nI do transcribing for Wikipedia's sister project Wikisource, and right now I'm working on transcribing CIA intelligence surveys of selected countries from the early 1970s.\n\nRight now, the portal is set up sorting the surveys by topic (ex. Armed Forces, Government and Politics, Science, Economy, etc.) but I'm not sure whether it would look better that way or displaying it by country (ex. Spain's surveys, then Sweden's surveys, and so on.)\n\nWhat is the general consensus on this? Should I sort by topic or country? Which would be easier to read and be more visually appealing?\n\nPlease feel free to take a look: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Portal:Central_Intelligence_Agency JoeSolo22 (talk)\n\nHello, JoeSolo. Most people here have little experience of WikiSource. I see you have already asked at s:WS:Scriptorium: I doubt if you will get any useful answers here. ColinFine (talk)\n\nThank you, I was unaware that existed until after I posted here. My bad, have a good day!\n\nJoeSolo22 (talk)\n\nHey Wikipedians, I have a concern about the screenshots of Mallard and Watercolor screenshots on Windows XP visual styles as it features Windows Whistler which is back then, a confidential OS project. Is it fine to be left there or not? Paowee (talk)\n\nPaowee, I looked at File:Windows-XP-build-2419-Watercolor.png, which I think is one of the files you're asking about. I read there that the copyright holder (Microsoft) expressly permitted its hosting by Wikimedia. Do you suspect that the permission notice is bogus? -- Hoary (talk)\n\nNo, it looks valid to me, but I'm just asking if it's bogus to others just to double-check if it's using a bogus permission or not. I was also gonna update the screenshot as the image was taken from BetaWiki. Paowee (talk)\n\nI'm not a copyright person, but looking at the Microsoft permissions box, this jumps out: you may not use screenshots of Microsoft product boot-up screens, opening screens, \"splash screens\", or screens from beta release products. Since several of the screen-shots in that article are specifically stated as belonging to beta-release versions, or \"leaked source code\" (which implies lack of authorisation by Microsoft) the copyright ice does look somewhat thin. Given Wikipedia's generally rather strict interpretation of copyright rules, I'm surprised there isn't a bit more explanation of why these are okay. Elemimele (talk)\n\nYeah, I find it the same situation for the Windows Neptune screenshot. Although it's a MS beta software but also leaked, the copyright ice kinda looks somewhat thin for that too. Paowee (talk)\n\nIt seems to me that the permission notice in File:Windows-XP-build-2419-Watercolor.png is an irrelevant distraction, because the page claims that the image is being used according to Wikipedia's non-free content criteria, which does not require consent of any kind from the copyright holder. --ColinFine (talk)\n\nBut that file does not have a WP:NFUR for use on Windows XP visual styles. The NFUR on the file is for use on a different article. - David Biddulph (talk)\n\nThe page WP:RS says that websites whose content is largely user-generated is unacceptable and is not considered as reliable sources. But OEIS is an atypical example: Although its content is user-generated, there is a peer review process and experienced editors accept or reject items; OEIS is an academic website and most of the users have sufficient experience. However, I am still uncertain about this. Thanks! IntegerSequences (talk | contribs)\n\n@IntegerSequences, not my area at all, but if you check for example the refs at 2, OEIS seems to be rather liked. Try asking at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nIf the peer reviews perform fact checking and other editorial control(i.e. it's not a rubber stamp), it would probably be okay. 331dot (talk)\n\nThanks. I also need to check the citation format of OEIS. IntegerSequences (talk | contribs)\n\n@IntegerSequences: OEIS is indeed an atypical example, particularly because of how respected it is in the mathematical community, as well as the fact that mathematical information is much less likely to be controversial or unreliable than other fields. Wikipedia:Notability (numbers), a guideline, actually names OEIS in a few places as indicative of whether something is notable. We link to it quite often in the prose of articles, like at Perfect number. I believe it is a reliable source, though am not 100% confident. — Bilorv (talk)\n\nWow, you EL-use it like the Bible is sometimes used in religious articles. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nquetta Pakistan 103.35.211.88 (talk)\n\nWelcome to the Teahouse! Did you have a question about Wikipedia? GoingBatty (talk)\n\n@103.35.211.88, Welcome to Teahouse! However, Teahouse is a place for asking question related to editing Wikipedia, if you want to find a job, maybe is not what Teahouse for. Why not try Wikipedia:Reference desk Lemonaka (talk)\n\nJust asking, Because editing an article on Wikipedia can be a little bore sometimes. 2600:1700:4092:2D50:199B:6DE2:64AF:94A (talk)\n\nIn short, No. We are trying to create a serious encyclopedia. --Bduke (talk)\n\n@2600:1700:4092:2D50:199B:6DE2:64AF:94A: No. But if you have a user account you can put limited joke articles in your userspace. Wikipedia also has WP:HUMORous essays. See also WP:-D. Psiĥedelisto (talk • contribs) please always ping!\n\nNo. And do not \"put limited joke articles in your userspace\". Editing articles in Wikipedia can indeed sometimes be a little boring. Before it becomes boring, simply do something unrelated to Wikipedia, perhaps even do something unrelated to the internet. -- Hoary (talk)\n\nYou might find Encyclopedia Dramatica or Uncyclopedia more accommodating, or at least more amusing. Shantavira|feed me\n\n@2600:1700:4092:2D50:199B:6DE2:64AF:94A welcome to teahouse. However, Wikipedia is a serious encyclopedia, creating jokes may not appropriate. Lemonaka (talk)\n\nI recently prepared some text in Sandbox and wished to save it. In no way did I wish it to become published to the public. I pressed Publish hoping to find a method to save. Quite rightly the text has bee assessed as unsuitable. How can it be deleted so that I can continue to use my Sandbox. Many Thanks Stevepem (talk)\n\n@stevepem: simply delete the text. lettherebedarklight晚安\n\n(edit conflict) Hello Stevepem and welcome to the Teahouse. As you will now realise, anything saved in Wikipedia is \"published\" in the sense that it can be found if people know where to look. That's why the button is called \"Publish changes\" rather than \"Save changes\". If you don't want the current contents of your sandbox any more, then just go back and edit again: you could even \"blank\" it (see WP:Blanking): the page is yours to use to edit as you wish when testing out new material for use later in articles. I suggest you also read WP:YFA for general advice. Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\npsst, @michael d. turnbull, wikipedia:blanking is a disambiguation page lettherebedarklight晚安\n\n@Lettherebedarklight Yes, I was nagged about that as I was editing in source mode. I deliberately used that page as it has link"
