        "text": "In late 2020, I published a short, limited-scope article on academia.edu titled “Is the Turin Shroud Compatible with a First Century Jerusalem Burial?--Some Jewish Perspectives” (https://www.academia.edu/s/bd79ff27f9?source=link), which included a discussion group. I was hoping that the comments by others might help me to decide how to proceed from that article. I received some remarks that helped me to decide that the most useful route to take would be to produce several separate follow-up articles consisting of pertinent bibliographic entries. See on academia.edu the companion article “The Shroud of Turin in Light of First-Century CE Jewish Burial Practices According to Non-Jewish Sources – a Bibliography.” I have not supplied a direct link because there will likely be multiple revisions. I want to make few comments about ancient and modern Jewish sources. The Mishnah, complied about CE 200, recounts details of the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period (536 BCE – 70 CE). (“CE” stands for “Common Era” and is equivalent to designation “AD.”) The Code of Jewish Law was written in CE 1563. It is not known whether any of the norms applied in the first century CE when Jesus lived; some authors discussing the Shroud mention it so it will be included here. Chapter CXCVII (197) deals with “Laws Relating to Purification (Tahara) and the Shrouds; also the Prohibition to Enjoy Anything Belonging to the Dead.” Chapter CXCVIII (198) deals with “Laws Concerning the Removal of the Dead, the Funeral and the Burial Service.” Chapter CXCIX (199) deals with “Laws Concerning the Interment and the Cemetery.” Chapter CCI (200) deals with “Laws Concerning a Suicide and a Wicked Person’s Death.” (I included because in some people’s eyes, Jesus was considered a wicked person.) It’s also a matter of debate if the norms discussed in modern Jewish sources about burial customs applied in the first century, but those will be included, as well. Some of the sources listed don’t specifically address the Shroud, but have relevant material that is pertinent to making judgments about the Shroud’s authenticity. Other background information: Semahot (or Semahoth), not part of the Mishnah, is generally referred to by the euphemistic title Sema-Hot (\"Rejoicings\"), this tractate, dating probably from the third century, is the oldest known Rabbinic text that sets forth the laws governing death, burial, and mourning. “Qumran” refers to a First-Century Jewish group that lived at Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea and produced the Dead Sea Scrolls. “Jason's Tomb is a rock-cut tomb dating to the first century BCE in the Hasmonean period, discovered in the Rehavia neighborhood in Jerusalem. One will find in some of the entries, “Second Temple Period,” which spans the late sixth century BCE and ends with the Roman destruction of the Jerusalem temple in CE 70. “Abba Cave” is the name given to a rock-cut burial cave found in the north of Jerusalem in 1970. The cave dates to the 1st century BCE and is famous a having a highly-decorated bone box (ossuary), and an inscription alluding to the burial of the last Maccabean king, Matithyahu Antigonos II. One entry has both a Jewish author (Zias) and non-Jewish author (Charlesworth). Since Zias is listed as the primary author, I have included it here. Several entries have the term “ossuaries,” which is a container or room in which the bones of dead people are placed, a prevalent practice during the Second Temple Period.\n\nIf the Turin Shroud (TS) is authentic, i.e., the burial cloth of the historical Jesus, it would have had to originate in first century Jerusalem, all the time and place of Jesus’ death. Oceans of ink have been spilled explaining how the Shroud matches (or doesn’t) to the gospel accounts of the burial as well as the known Jewish burial customs at the time. However, there have been several key problems: 1) the Synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) conflict somewhat with the gospel of John; 2) it is not exactly clear what the Jewish burial customs were at the time and 3) most of the authors are usually Christians and/or skeptics with less-than-ideal knowledge of both the gospels and Jewish burial customs in general and specifically in the First Century. There have been a few specifically Jewish sources that have addressed this. In this paper, I will look at three different sources, two Jews with one work each and one Jew that converted to Catholicism (three works). There are no doubt other Jewish authors that could be consulted, but these sources make for useful self-limiting parameters, insofar as the sources are not widely accessible -- one Jewish source is from a somewhat obscure theological journal, one is from an audio presentation recorded on cassette tape, and the third source with three different works are only found in written conference proceedings. The three authors cited, of course, relied heavily on other ancient and modern Jewish sources.\n\nAny discussion about the authenticity of the Shroud encompasses detailed analysis of the Gospel texts. All four gospels mention Jesus’ burial cloths. Matthew (27:59-60), Mark (15:46) and Luke (23:53) use the Greek word sindon, normally interpreted as “shroud,” when describing what Joseph of Arimathea provided for Jesus, whereas John uses the Greek word othonia, usually interpreted as a plural term for burial cloths. John also mentions, to the exclusion of the other three gospels, a napkin or face cloth (20:7). However, Luke, when describing what Peter found in the tomb, does not use his original term, sindon, but rather, othonia (24:12). In recent years, some researchers have come to believe that even the Pauline letters may have references to the Shroud, the most notable one being Galatians 3:1, in which Paul says, “You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.” These researchers argue that the word “portrayed” (per the original Greek) fits very well with the possibility of having seen the cloth known today as the Shroud of Turin. I have previously written two other bibliographical articles (accessible on academia.edu) that cover Jewish burial customs as they relate to the Shroud: “The Turin Shroud in Light of First-Century CE Jewish Burial Practices According to Jewish Sources – a Bibliography” and “The Turin Shroud in Light of First-Century CE Jewish Burial Practices According to Jewish Sources – a Bibliography.” Since the burial customs aspect is inextricably intertwined with the exegesis of the gospel texts, there will be some overlap between those articles and this article. This article will be updated as needed.\n\nAbstract. In 1989 EDICES (Spanish Sindonology Research Centre Team) started researching about the Sudarium of Oviedo, developing the pioneer research started in the sixties by Monsignor Giulio Ricci, who was a member of the Papal Curia and President of the “Roman Centre of Sindonology”a, and furthermore, he was a scholar of the Gospel of Saint John, the reading of chapter 20, Bible verses 4-8: “4 They were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and was the first to arrive at the tomb.5 Bending down to take a look, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he didn’t go in.6 Following him, Simon Peter entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there.7 He also saw the face cloth that had been on Jesus ’ head. It wasn’t with the other clothes but was folded up in its own place.8 Then the other disciple, the one who arrived at the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. ” This made him look for a second funerary linen used to wrap the corpse of Jesu...\n\nAccording to ancient tradition, the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus. To determine whether this could be true, more historical and scientific research has been done on the Shroud of Turin than on any other ancient artifact. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the results of the scientific research on the Shroud of Turin. This summary is based on the opinions of most Shroud researchers and on research by the author. Research on the Shroud is summarized using nine summary statements. A multi-step argument is given that the image on the Shroud is that of Jesus of Nazareth. Two objections to these conclusions are considered – that they violate the laws of science and that the authenticity of the Shroud is disproven by the 1988 C14 dating of the Shroud, which concluded that the Shroud dates to 1260 to 1390 AD with a 95% probability. Four reasons are discussed which indicate that this conclusion is not justified by the evidence. This includes consideration of 14 indicators of the Shroud’s date and 6 indications that the 1988 statistical analysis of the C14 dating results was inadequate. The neutron absorption hypothesis is used to explain the apparent C14 date to 1260 to 1390 AD."
