        "text": "Images of enclosed and inaccessible spaces, serving as locations for secret amorous encounters between the soul-bride and the divine bridegroom, recur throughout Bernard of Clairvaux's Sermons on the Song of Songs. Perhaps the most striking of these images is that of the bed chamber (cubiculum), which is exposed in detail in Sermon 23. What are the secrets of the bedchamber? Why are they secret? This paper explores embedded meanings in the notions of secrecy and spatial intimacy, arguing that Bernard, speaking \" in our words \" to express \" wisdom hidden in mystery \" (Sermon 74), uses secrecy as a rhetorical strategy to both establish and to breach the boundaries between the spiritual and the literal meaning of the eroticism in the Song of Songs.\n\nBernard of Clairvaux's letter to his young cousin Robert, written in the early 1120s CE, ignited a public controversy between the powerful Cluniacs and the upstart Cistercians over proper monastic practice and recruitment that smoldered throughout the twelfth century. This article examines how Cistercian polemics arose out of this new monastic competition to form Cistercian identity. Bernard of Clairvaux and the Cistercians under his influence employed a rhetoric that drew on notions of space, age, and gender to present their rivals as worldly, feminine, and immature and themselves as mature and masculine warriors on the front lines of ascetic battle against the vices. In doing so, the Cistercians deployed a gendered concept of \"childhood\" and \"youth\" that shaped their understanding of monastic conversion and progression as maturation from a worldly, feminized child to a mature and masculine monk. By centering \"childhood\" as a category of analysis, this article demonstrates the importance of age to Cistercian constructions of monastic masculinity. The gender-crossing martial, nuptial, and maternal imagery for which the Cistercians are famous relied on constructions of the \"child.\" This article shows that \"childhood\" and \"adulthood\" are mutually constitutive, gendered categories and reveals that \"childhood\" is as important to constructing Christian masculinities as notions of \"woman.\"\n\nA study of the exegetic commentaries on the Biblical Songs of Songs up through the fifteenth century, with a focus on the image of human nuptial love as a symbol of the love between God and the human being: the spiritual betrothal and spiritual marriage -- a trope central to many traditions of world religion.
