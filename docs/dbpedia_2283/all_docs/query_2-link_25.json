        "text": "Let your goodness, Lord, appear to us, that we, made in your image, may conform ourselves to it.\n\nIn our own strength we cannot imitate your majesty, power, and wonder nor is it fitting for us to try. But your mercy reaches from the heavens through the clouds to the earth below.\n\nYou have come to us as a small child, but you have brought us the greatest of all gifts, the gift of eternal love. Caress us with your tiny hands, embrace us with your tiny arms and pierce our hearts with your soft, sweet cries.\n\n—St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nJesus, the Light of the World, as we celebrate your birth, may we begin to see the world in the light of understanding you give us. As you chose the lowly, the outcasts, and the poor to receive the greatest news the world had ever known, so may we worship you in meekness of heart. May we also remember our brothers and sisters less fortunate than ourselves in this season of giving. Amen.\n\n— Karen L. Oberst\n\nRound this table, here to pray. First, we thank you for the day. For our family and our friends. Gifts of grace that heaven lends. Living water, daily bread. Countless blessings our God sends. Thank you, Jesus, for them all. For the great ones and the small. When we're happy, when we're sad. On the good days and the bad. We are grateful, we are glad. Amen.\n\n— Mary Fairchild\n\nIn a world where worry, not peace, prevails, stir up that good news again. This Christmas, make it real in our hearts. Never have we needed Your joy and peace more than now. Thank You for the gift of Jesus, our Immanuel, the Word made flesh. Forgive us for forgetting—that Your love never changes, never fades, and that You never abandon the purpose for which You came: to save us from our sinful condition, and to give us life eternal, the joy of relationship with a holy God. Your birth—and Your death—sealed Your promise to us forever.\n\n— Rebecca Barlow Jordan\n\nLove came, held safely within a gentle womb\n\nAll the truth, majesty, and creativity of a living God\n\nPoured into a tiny heart\n\nMaking a quiet entrance in a dark and uninviting shack\n\nJust one star shone anew as a handful of people were brought\n\nLed by angelic voices, and open hearts\n\nA young mother\n\nA faith-filled father\n\nMen of wisdom who searched for truth\n\nAnd a group of humble herdsmen\n\nThey came to bow before a new life\n\nAnd acknowledge that the rescuer had arrived\n\nThat the Word of God had come alive\n\nAnd that the extraordinary transformation of heaven and earth\n\nHad begun\n\n— Julie Palmer\n\nDear Lord, Don't let us miss You this Christmas season. Help us to simplify our activities and traditions so we can focus our celebration on Your birth. Thank You for being the Prince of Peace, and I ask You for that supernatural peace to reign in our hearts. Thank You for the simple but life-changing message of Your love for us. In Jesus' name, Amen.\n\n— Melanie Chitwood\n\nLoving Father, Help us remember the birth of Jesus,\n\nThat we may share in the song of the angels,\n\nThe gladness of the shepherds,\n\nAnd worship of the wise men.\n\nClose the door of hate\n\nAnd open the door of love all over the world.\n\nLet kindness come with every gift\n\nAnd good desires with every greeting.\n\nDeliver us from evil by the blessing, which Christ brings\n\nAnd teach us to be merry with clear hearts.\n\nMay the Christmas morning make us\n\nHappy to be thy children\n\nAnd Christmas evening bring us\n\nTo our beds with grateful thoughts\n\nForgiving and forgiven\n\nFor Jesus sake\n\nAmen.\n\n— Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nLord, in this holy season of prayer and song and laughter, we praise you for the great wonders you have sent us: for shining star and angel's song, for infant's cry in lowly manger. We praise you for the Word made flesh in a little Child. We behold his glory, and are bathed in its radiance. Be with us as we sing the ironies of Christmas, the incomprehensible comprehended, the poetry made hard fact, the helpless Babe who cracks the world asunder. We kneel before you shepherds, innkeepers, wise men. Help us to rise bigger than we are. Amen.\n\n— Author Unknown\n\nAlmighty God, grant that the new birth of your Son in the flesh redeems us from the old slavery under the yoke of sin, so we may receive him with joy as our Redeemer, and that when when he comes to judge we may see Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen.\n\n— Wilehelm Loehe\n\nGod, our Creator, we offer this humble prayer on Christmas Day. We come to worship with a song of thanks in our hearts—a song of redemption, a song of hope and renewal. We pray for joy in our hearts, hope in our God, love to forgive, and peace upon the earth. We ask for the salvation of all our family members and friends, and we pray your blessings on all people. May there be bread for the hungry, love for the unlovable, healing for the sick, protection for our children, and wisdom for our youth. We pray for the forgiveness of sinners and abundant life in Christ. Holy Spirit, fill our hearts with your love and power. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.\n\n— Rev. Lia Icaza Willetts\n\nDear God, we give thanks for this time when we can all be together. We give thanks for this food which is bountiful and delicious. We give thanks for this joyful holiday when we can celebrate our Savior and his love for us. With joy we pray, Amen.\n\n— Beth McLendon\n\nO sweet Child of Bethlehem, grant that we may share with all our hearts in this profound mystery of Christmas. Put into the hearts of men and women this peace for which they sometimes seek so desperately and which you alone can give to them. Help them to know one another better, and to live as brothers and sisters, children of the same Father. Reveal to them also your beauty, holiness, and purity. Awaken in their hearts love and gratitude for your infinite goodness. Join them all together in your love. And give us your heavenly peace. Amen.\n\n— Pope John XXIII\n\nLord and Giver of all good things, the magi travelled for miles to bring the Christ child the first Christmas presents. So may we, too, remember with thankful hearts the love that comes with each present we open. We also thank you for the love you have for each of us, and we thank you for the many gifts that you give us, especially the gift of live itself. Amen.\n\n— Author unknown\n\nMy prayer for you this Christmas\n\nIs like a special gift\n\nI choose to ask for peace and joy\n\nAnd there's more on this list!\n\nI know you need both hope and love\n\nTo fill your life anew\n\nAnd so I take these precious things\n\nAnd wrap them up for you.\n\nI ask that you would know how much\n\nYou're loved and held so dear\n\nAs I take a ribbon of grace\n\nAnd tie a bow this year.\n\nAnd on the label I will write\n\nMy promise new to you:\n\n“You're in my prayers this Christmas time and the whole year through.”\n\n— Author Unknown"
