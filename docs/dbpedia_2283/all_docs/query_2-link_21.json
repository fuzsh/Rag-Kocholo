        "text": "Bernard Gilpin (born 1517, Kentmere, Westmorland, Eng.—died March 4, 1583, Houghton-le-Spring, Durham) was an English cleric, one of the most conscientious and broad-minded upholders of the Elizabethan church settlement, which recognized the English sovereign, rather than the pope, as head of the English church.\n\nGilpin was educated at Queen’s College, Oxford, and was ordained in 1542. He defended Roman Catholic doctrines against the Protestant bishop John Hooper and Peter Martyr and in 1552 preached a sermon, before the ailing adolescent king Edward VI of England, denouncing the expropriation of church property.\n\nGilpin became vicar of Norton, Durham, that same year and obtained permission to preach throughout the kingdom. Just before Mary’s accession he went to study on the European continent, returning in 1556 to be rector of Easington, Durham, and archdeacon of Durham. He frankly refused to accept either Calvinism or the anti-Reformation decrees of the Council of Trent. He was defended on a heresy charge by his great-uncle, the Catholic bishop Cuthbert Tunstall of Durham, a leading conservative during the English Reformation, who endorsed royal supremacy. Gilpin succeeded in avoiding a royal warrant for his apprehension in London and was spared further harassment after the death of Mary (Nov. 17, 1558), whose persecution of the Protestants he had abhorred."
