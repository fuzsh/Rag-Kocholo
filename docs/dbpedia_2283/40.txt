1 O sacred Head surrounded

By crown of piercing thorn!

O bleeding Head, so wounded,

Reviled and put to scorn!

The pow'r of death comes o'er you,

The glow of life decays,

Yet angel hosts adore you

And tremble as they gaze.

2 I see your strength and vigor

All fading in the strife,

And death with cruel rigor,

Bereaving you of life;

O agony and dying!

O love to sinners free!

Jesus, all grace supplying,

O turn your face on me.
