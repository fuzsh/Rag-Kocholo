        "text": "Alright. I know I will probably have this forum taken down due to it not being 'constructive', or not giving EA a standing ovation for their game. I simply want to point out a fact that has gone unnoticed. Battlefield 5 is, in its attempt to make a World War 2 setting more socially acceptable, promoting stolen valor. I have one major point to this claim. The Norwegian mission of Battlefields 5s mini-campaigns. Where a freedom fighter and her mother destroy an entire facility and undersea fleet of heavy water, which was originally being used in an attempt by the Germans to make a nuclear device. This story is false from the get go. It was not two women that took down an entire Nazi compound and fleet. It was the co-operation of Norwegian soldiers and British soldiers, through various bombings and attacks on the facility and fleet. Forty-one commandos were initially captured and killed during its first attempts. In the end, ten troops of mixed origin found a way to sneak into the facility via a ravine, destroying it and escaping despite approximately 3,000 Germans attempting to find and kill them before, during, and after the mission. In the end, the ten men were given the highest war honors, and became heroes. But still at the cost of the forty-one mentioned earlier. There was no rag-tag freedom fighter too big for her boots. There was no undercover mom. And the two didn't somehow escape the entire German deployment and take out the entire supply on their own. It was the effort of true soldiers. Who fought and died to stop a nuclear threat. But, I guess not having anyone of color, or anyone who is not a male is not good enough. In fact, I haven't seen anything saying that they were all straight, white males, either. So, because the truth wasn't enough of a shining tale of an underdog social construct rising against the oppressive norms, it was instead chosen that they would be replaced. Because looking good in front of a social movement is more important than respecting people who suffered and died for our safety. Its an attempt to piggyback off something you had no part in. Its stolen valor.\n\nVery true, however you're forgetting one crucial thing here:\n\nBattlefield V is a work of fiction, based on the second world war.\n\nIt's not a documentary.\n\nIt's (at the end of the day) a video game. In order to make that game sell to the widest audience, regrettably they have to cater for a variety of crowds. If their actions get an extremely negative response they'll tweak it, but making a completely accurate experience that still doesn't play or sell well costs big bucks. Sure, there are masses of historical inaccuracies within the campaign and multiplayer, however no single world war 2 game or film has ever been historically accurate. Even The Great Escape wasn't completely accurate.\n\nAlso, no Battlefield game has been accurate going right back to the start of the franchise, nor has any war game for that matter. Verdun came close and even promoted itself as being accurate, yet it still wasn't to a high extent a true representation of the events in that particular battle in the great war.\n\nSure, the presence of female soldiers has been exaggerated, however within the bounds of WW2 fiction it's plausible. The film Inglourious Basterds was completely inaccurate, and still had elements based on truth mixed with heavy doses of fiction, and still had stellar reviews.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game has many problems to iron out and plenty of areas for improvement, however the argument for the title pandering to being more \"socially acceptable\" simply isn't the case. It's merely diving heavily into the routes of player customisation and exaggerating the true story.\n\nIf i'm honest, it's hilarious you've gone to the extreme of calling it \"stolen valour\". How exactly does one steal courage and bravery? It's a little extreme a view.\n\nI think sacrificing some historical accuracy is necessary to make the game fun to play.\n\nIf it was \"accurate\" you would have to sit in the snow for 2 days straight and listen to bombing non-stop (just to give you an example).\n\nI didn't mind playing the Norwegian campaign with this Mom-and-Daughter spinoff, it gave the game some variety, a chance for emotional connection.\n\nFirst I felt weird about the female soldiers in multiplayer (which is historically very inaccurate) but the game can get away with it as long as sexuality and gore are not overly expressed.\n\nI think there is a very good reason why you don't see female solders being gunned down by an MMG and blown up in Hollywood movies.... it could turn gross real quick."
