        "text": "Coding is much more than just mathematics, algorithms, computer science, and programming itself. Coding is a discipline, a way of thinking, and a methodology that enables people who learn it to turn into the most creative individuals the planet has ever seen.\n\nIt can enable your kids to grab their wildest dreams, ideas, and projects and turn them into breathtaking realities and applaudable solutions. Coding is related to almost every industry today; coding is related to arts, astronomy, and your kids’ self-esteem. As we’re going to present in the following paragraphs, it is related to movie making.\n\nWhen we say that programming and coding are related to movie making, we don’t necessarily mean special effects. Instead, we are talking about a new way of thinking. When your kids strengthen the multiple tools, they can gain when learning how to code. They will be more than ready to solve any issues they might face in the near future, including successfully facing some struggles they might encounter.\n\nCoding is related to movie-making in several aspects: creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, and even leadership. Are you ready to see how coding and movie-making are connected in full detail? Let’s cut to the chase!\n\nWhy do filmmakers need to learn how to code?\n\nFilmmakers need a variety of tools to feel empowered to create anything. When writing or directing a movie, filmmakers need to truly believe that whatever they have in their heads is doable and can be translated into something concrete that others will watch on a screen.\n\nIn simple terms, coding is the ultimate tool that kids can use today to understand that anything is possible. If they dedicate their lives to movie making, that statement is a pillar they’ll always have to remind themselves about.\n\nBut, how can movie makers use coding in their everyday lives? Here are some examples.\n\nCreating a website\n\nNowadays, every filmmaker needs a website. They need it not just for themselves but also for their projects and future films. Knowing how to code will assist in developing stunning websites that will resonate with the audiences and contribute to the fundraising of any crowd-funding initiatives young directors might have in the future.\n\nCoding will enable future filmmakers to create a website with no problem. Since coding boosts the creativity of those who learn it, those websites will be fully functional and charming, and captivating.\n\nSo, do your kids love creating films and video content for YouTube? Maybe it is time for them to learn a little bit of coding!\n\nProblem-solving\n\nThe world of movie-making is full of unexpected accidents and issues that directors encounter with no prior warning. When your kids learn to code, they acquire multiple tools to better deal with problem-solving.\n\nLearning how to code in an environment that contemplates mistakes as purely valuable learning experiences gives learners a positive perspective. They understand that things are fixable and that we can take thousands of paths to solve the same problem.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is extremely important in show business, movie making, and filmmaking. For example, when your kids are planning how to record new viral content for their TikTok profiles, they’ll need to consider the potential unforeseen events that might occur. That doesn’t mean to be pessimistic, but rather to be like a boy or girl scout: Always ready!\n\nTeamwork: You don’t make a film on your own!\n\nIn fact, films are not done by a single person. Directors and screenplay writers need to work with various professionals such as actors, performers, special effects specialists, movie editing professionals, makeup artists, etc. But, which field can teach our kids to work together and consider different perspectives and professionals? Yes, you guessed it right: Coding!\n\nWhen your kids create an app -or when you program complex software- they need to test it with different kinds of people to evaluate their reactions. On the other hand, they need to take people’s expectations very seriously, so whatever they create in their app is useful and enjoyable. They also need to ask different questions to many people to comprehend if whatever they’ve created solves an existing problem or not.\n\nMovie making is not too different from this, and if your kids learn how to code first, then creating a movie won’t be as difficult for them.\n\nCoding is just around the corner. Movie making too.\n\nIn the live and online courses offered by Tekkie Uni, your children will get to choose between several classes, instructors, and curricula. In the coding course, your kids will learn everything they need to know to create their very own app and gain endless future-ready tools that will assist them along the way.\n\nThere’s also the extraordinary opportunity to enroll your kids in a course entirely focused on movie making, YouTube creation, movie editing, and boosting their creativity levels. If you’d like your children to strengthen this skill-set, check out the courses we have for them.\n\nAre you ready to empower your kids with the ultimate tools they need? The time is now! Give power and knowledge to your children."
