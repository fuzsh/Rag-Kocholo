        "text": "Day of the Dead, also known as Día de los Muertos, hasn’t yet made the jump from holiday to movie genre (see: Halloween movies and Christmas movies). However, that might change soon, as the number of Day of the Dead movies continues to grow, with movies focusing on the holiday, like Coco, making it all the way to the Academy Awards.\n\nTo be clear: A Day of the Dead movie is not the same thing as a Halloween movie, though the two may overlap (especially in Hollywood). Día de los Muertos is not the same thing as Halloween, and it’s important not to conflate the two despite their similarities. Day of the Dead, typically celebrated on November 1 and 2, is a time to honor family members or loved ones that have passed with altars, or ofrendas. These altars are often adorned with marigolds, food, candles, water, and other offerings meant to help spirits in their journey through the afterlife.\n\nBinge-watching Day of the Dead-themed movies is not a traditional part of the festivities, but don't let that stop you from checking out these 21 Day of the Dead-inspired films to learn more about the holiday and its traditions and roots in Mexican culture.\n\nLa Leyenda de la Nahuala\n\nThis animated movie is equal parts cute, silly, and adventure-packed. It takes you way back to the Day of the Dead in 1807 in what was then called New Spain. Leo, a scaredy-cat introvert (can relate) has to muster up the courage to rescue his brother from the haunted Nahuala house. If you like this movie, you can also check out its four sequels: La Leyenda de la Llorona, La leyenda de las Momias, La Leyenda del Chupacabras, and La Leyenda del Charro Negro.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nSugar Skull Girls\n\nThis horror film incorporates the Day of the Dead into its supernatural plot as three demonic sisters are accidentally conjured up from the other side during an attempt to raise a little girl from the dead that goes horribly wrong.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nDía de Muertos\n\nIf time is of the essence, this lil' four-and-a-half-minute short will get you ready for the holiday in a snappy manner. The animation is simplistic but beautiful in telling the story of a child who travels to the world of those who have left us, and it has an ending that'll leave you feeling emotional.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nCoco\n\nThis Pixar instant-classic is a gorgeous, colorful celebration of Mexican culture and traditions. The story is uplifting and will make your soul feel as good as the animation will make your eyes feel. And if you didn't realize the power of looking at beautiful things, then you clearly have not seen Coco yet and should rectify that immediately.\n\nThe Book of Life\n\nAnother animated movie that draws on the rich culture and tradition of the holiday, but with a distinctly beautiful animation style and carefree tone that set it apart.\n\nDay of the Dead: A Celebration of Life\n\nIf you're up for a documentary (and you want to learn more—which, why wouldn't you?), check out this comprehensive, stunning, educational but also riveting film. Warning: It'll make you want to experience the festivities immediately.\n\nThe Aztec Mummy\n\nThis 1957 cult classic is appropriately dated (see also the special effects), but is the first of three movies featuring the fascinating Popoca the Aztec Mummy. Great news, you can watch the whole movie for free below.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nThe Big Wish\n\nMexican orphan Salma has been told her parents abandoned her, so she takes the holiday as an opportunity to maybe meet them for the first time. Adventures ensue!\n\nA Night in Old Mexico\n\nThis movie stars Robert Duvall as a guy hoping to connect with his grandson. Amidst the celebrations in Mexico, there's some plot shenanigans about stolen money, a romance, and so on.\n\nEl Muerto\n\nThis adaptation of a comic book series stars Wilmer Valderrama as a young Mexican-American sacrificed and returned to Earth by Aztec gods. Also—a local Día de los Muertos festival features.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nDe Un Jalón Hasta el Panteón\n\nThis sweet hand-drawn short is all about appreciating life (and truly remembering those we lost). And, at seven minutes long, it's something the whole family can watch together without getting antsy.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nHasta Los Huesos/Down to the Bone\n\nAnother short, Hasta Los Huesos has gorge stop-motion animation and has kind of a Nightmare Before Christmas meets Day of the Dead feel to it, which I can appreciate!\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nDía de los Muertos\n\nDon't sleep on this 3-minute short, which is all about a little girl who lost her mom and is briefly reunited with her in the afterlife (sniff). Again—watch the whole thing right now if you want, but be absolutely ready to cry.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nMacario\n\nThis amazing movie is a bit of everything—fantasy, drama, supernatural. The film, which takes place on the eve of the Day of the Dead, was also the first Mexican movie to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nThe Halloween Tree\n\nBased on the Ray Bradbury novel of the same name, The Halloween Tree follows four friends as they embark on a magical journey on Halloween to save their friend, Pip. Their adventure includes stops in different times and places throughout history that explain the cultural origins and significance of the costumes each child is wearing—including a stop in Mexico to learn about the significance of skeletons in the Day of the Dead festival.\n\nAssassins\n\nHello Antonio Banderas!! Joined by Sylvester Stallone, the actor stars in this fairly silly film that has a pivotal scene take place during a Day of the Dead parade. Is it about the holiday? Not really. Will we still accept it into the Day of the Dead movie canon? You bet!\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Mexico\n\nThe final movie in Robert Rodriguez's Mexico Trilogy, this modern western stars Antonio Banderas as the iconic El Mariachi and also stars Salma Hayek and Johnny Depp. The movie features an amazing Day of the Dead sequence.\n\nUnder the Volcano\n\nThis drama, based on English writer Malcolm Lowry's semi-autobiographical 1947 novel, follows the last 24 hours in the life of an alcoholic British former consul named Geoffrey Firmin. Its setting: A small Mexican town called Quauhnahuac on the Day of the Dead in 1938.\n\nSuper Monsters: Dia de los Monsters\n\nIf you're looking for another family-friendly Day of the Dead watch option, there's always Super Monsters: Dia de los Monsters on Netflix. In it, the Super Monsters visit Vida's hometown to celebrate Día de los Muertos with her fam.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n3 From Hell\n\nThis sequel to The Devil's Rejects features a lot of Rob Zombie-gore—oh yes, and a whole action set piece around Day of the Dead. Do not watch this one if you don't do on-screen violence.\n\nThe Night Crew\n\nThis 2015 action/horror movie doesn't have a full plot revolving around Día de Muertos, but it does includes a pivotal scene set during a Day of the Dead Parade that will help set your mood for the holiday."
