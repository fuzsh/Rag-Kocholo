If proper credit does not appear on your activity statement, you should contact us via the Site and then provide any requested documentation to verify your purchase. We reserve the right to determine whether Points should have been posted to your Account and to adjust your Account accordingly.\n\nWe may refuse to record or honor Points in your Account, or if already recorded, we may cancel them, if we cannot confirm that they were properly issued or obtained.
