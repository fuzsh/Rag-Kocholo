        "text": "In this article, we argue that non-hegemonic Turkish German masculinities are deployed at a new sociocultural frontier in German and European discourses of migrant belonging. This frontier is still conceived of in terms of an encounter between ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ cultures. While portrayals of oppressed Turkish German women and brutal Turkish German men are familiar to German audiences, they leave little room for non-hegemonic Turkish German masculinities. The recent advent in popular culture of Turkish German gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and questioning characters, however, points to the redeployment of established discourses on gender and Turkish German cultural difference. Just as Turkish German women have been portrayed as victims of a traditional culture, Turkish German queer men are now being posited as victims of the same traditionalism and in need of help to ‘come out’ into German modernity. We argue that popular portrayals of alternative Turkish German masculinities further the nationalist narratives of tradition and modernity that underpin debates about the integration of Muslims in Germany. Using Jasbir Puar’s central concept of ‘homonationalism’, we critique how non-hegemonic Turkish German masculinities and alternative sexualities are portrayed in 21st century German film, television soaps and ethno-sitcoms, and stand-up comedy.\n\n(Contact author for info) Images of covered women, together with stories of honor killings and forced marriages, continue to retain their currency in media representations of Islam. Moving beyond staid stereotypes, Gender and Violence in the \"New\" Europe draws new conclusions about the role of violence in determining Muslim women's participation in German public life. Combining cultural studies with theory, Beverly Weber contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion about Islam in the West in two key ways. First, she demonstrates how current thinking about gender violence prohibits the intellectual inquiry necessary to act against a range of forms of violence. Secondly, she analyzes ways in which Muslim women participate in the public sphere by thematizing violence in literature, art, and popular media. By examining how violence is imagined, portrayed, and challenged, this timely book provides new strategies for action. \"Weber's insightful engagement with literary theorists is outstanding. In the context of German-language and English-language research about Muslims, feminists, popular culture, politics, and criticism in post-Cold War Germany, this is a major contribution.\" - Claudia Koonz, Peabody Family Professor Emeritus of History, Duke University, USA \"Ranging from dominant discourses on honor killings and headscarves to self-representations and artistic interventions in literature as well as performance, Weber's study undertakes a much-needed comprehensive investigation of the contemporary 'regime of gender violence,' that is, the key role violence has played in defining the position of Muslims in the German public sphere (in the larger European context). Through nuanced theorizing as well as careful historical contextualization, Weber develops an intersectional framework for analyzing gendered violence in a way that does not reinforce racialized discourses of cultural and/or religious difference. In demonstrating how the contemporary German public sphere is constituted through differential regimes of visibility - which, for example, invisibilize racism in foregrounding headscarves - Weber's analysis paves the way for imagining Muslim women as active participants, rather than victims, in the democratic process.\" - Claudia Breger, Associate Professor of Germanic Studies and Adjunct Associate Professor of Communication and Culture and Gender Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA \"This is without doubt one of the most thorough and original analyses of the charged European debate around gender, violence, and Muslim minorities. Importantly, Weber does not only carefully unpack the problematic racing of gender and religion in German liberal multiculturalism, using a variety of familiar and unfamiliar sources, but she also points to the agency of Muslim women so frequently denied by those claiming to 'save' them. A must read for anyone interested in understanding contemporary Europe.\" - Fatima El-Tayeb, Associate Professor of Literature and Ethnic Studies, UC San Diego, USA and author of European Others \"Beverly Weber does not shy away from making thorough and politically engaged arguments about a range of complicated topics - the connections between sexuality, race, and religion. Gender and Violence in the 'New' Europe offers the perfect model for how German Studies research can remain relevant in today's globalized world.\" - Maria Stehle, Assistant Professor of German, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA\n\nW.B.E Du Bois ([1903] 2013), in his classic book, Souls of Black Folk, developed the concept of “double-consciousness” for problematizing the racial identity of Blacks in the US, requiring African Americans to balance between being Negro and an American. Özyürek operationalizes this concept to deconstruct the identity of German converts to Islam in a context that increasingly marginalizes and racializes Muslims. With her ethnographic research conducted in various cities of Germany in 2006–7, 2009–11 and half of 2013, Özyürek explores the contradictions and challenges in the lives of the converts while they are trying to be Muslim and German at the same time. The rich data pulled from three and half years of participant observation, regular mosque visits, in-depth interviews and document analysis aim to examine how the German converts try to open up a legitimate space for Islam.\n\nSterphone’s article engages with the relevance and consequentiality of ‘Muslim’ as a social category for everyday Germans during the 1970s and 1980s. Specifically, it examines commonsense knowledge about the characteristics and actions bound to the category ‘Muslim’ and (re)produced in newspapers and speeches. It demonstrates that the German essentialization of ‘Turks’ following the end of the guest worker programme in 1973 deployed and (re)produced their simultaneous categorizability as ‘Muslims’. Thus Germans employed ‘Muslim’ as a resource for (re)producing category-tied knowledge about irreconcilable civilizational difference. Sterphone’s analysis combines discourse analysis with an ethnomethodological approach to studying categories and categorization practices. Since categories are ‘inference rich’ and act as storehouses for commonsense knowledge about the social world, they constitute resources for a variety of social actions. This paper demonstrates that not only did politicians and news journalists demonstrably orient themselves to the relevance of ‘Muslim’ as a means for (re)constructing and emphasizing incommensurable social difference, they also called on readers to participate in seeing these traits and behaviours as the kind of thing done or embodied by Muslims. Such practices produced the category ‘Muslim’ as mutually exclusive with ‘German’ long before the influx of refugees in the 1990s or the post-9/11 securitization. Thus Sterphone’s paper contributes to studies of German nationhood and its intersections with race, ethnicity and religion. Specifically, it highlights Germany’s post-war movement towards alignment with ‘the West’ and, consequently, the Muslim Turk’s position as a salient Other in Germany’s westernizing project. It therefore contributes to both theoretical and empirical discussions of anti-Muslim racism that demonstrate how Germans employ and (re)produce ‘Germanness’ (Deutsch-Sein) and ‘Muslimness’ (Muslimisch-Sein) so that they preclude one another."
