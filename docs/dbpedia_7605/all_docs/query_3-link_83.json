        "text": "Have you got what it takes to capture your vision on film? What ideas are driving cinema? Our film course gives you the skills you need for success and places you at the heart of these conversations.\n\nFilm can be a magical experience. It offers us representations of worlds real and imagined. It is both a social and cultural mirror, and a blank canvas on which we can project new visions of what it is to be human. At Edge Hill, we’ll help you discover how the myths and tales created for cinema make it such a powerful medium.\n\nThis BA (Hons) in film combines craft, creativity, and critical analysis. All essential skills for producing and analysing film. You’ll discover how to work with, and challenge, existing forms. You’ll develop a critical eye.\n\n“You shouldn’t dream your film, you should make it,” says Steven Spielberg. Our team of dedicated teaching staff will equip you with the essential skills you’ll need to realise your dreams.\n\nPlease note, the above examples may differ from actual offers made. A combination of A Level and BTEC awards may also be accepted.\n\nIf you have a minimum of two A Levels (or equivalent), there is no maximum number of qualifications that we will accept UCAS points from. This includes additional qualifications such as Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), AS Levels that haven't been continued to A Level, and General Studies AS or A Level awards."
