        "text": "Together with Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa, Michelangelo Antonioni is credited with defining the modern art film. And yet Antonioni's cinema is also recognized today for defying any easy categorization, with his films ultimately seeming to belong to their own distinctive genre. Indeed, the difficulty of precisely describing their category is itself the very quintessence of Antonioni's films. Among the most-cited contributions of Antonioni's cinema are their striking descriptions of that unique strain of post-boom ennui everywhere apparent in the transformed life and leisure habits of the Italian middle and upper classes. Detecting profound technological, political and psychological shifts at work in post-WWII Italy, Antonioni set out to explore the ambiguities of a suddenly alienated and dislocated Italy, not simply through his oblique style of narrative and characters, nor through any overt political messaging, but instead by tearing asunder the traditional boundaries of cinematic narrative in order to explore an ever shifting internal landscape expressed through architecture, urban space and the sculptural, shaping presence of objects, shapes and emotions invented by camera movement and depth of focus.\n\nAntonioni deftly manipulates the quieter, indirect edges of cinematic structure, often so discretely that his existential puzzles are felt before they can be intellectualized. The negative space is as prominent as the positive, silence as loud as noise, absence as palpable as presence, and passivity as driving a force as direct action. Transgressing unspoken cinematic laws, Antonioni frequently focuses on female protagonists while refusing to sentimentalize or morally judge his characters and placing them on equal footing with the other elements within his total dynamic system, like sounds or set pieces. And he violates spoken rules with unconventional cutting techniques, fractured spatial and temporal continuity, and a camera that insistently lingers in melancholy pauses, long after the actors depart, as if drifting just behind an equally distracted, dissipating narrative. Leaving questions unanswered and plot points irresolute, dispensing with exposition, suspense, sentimentality and other cinematic security blankets, Antonioni releases the viewer into a gorgeous, densely layered fog to contemplate and wrestle with his characters' imprecise quandaries and endless possibilities. Culminating in tour de force endings that often reframe the narrative in a daring, parting act of deconstruction, Antonioni's rigorously formal, yet open compositions allow his great, unwieldy questions to spill over into the world outside the cinema and outside of time.\n\nBorn into a middle-class family in the northern Italian town of Ferrara, Antonioni studied economics at the University of Bologna where he also co-founded the university's theatrical troupe. While dedicating himself to painting, writing film reviews, working in financial positions and in different capacities on film productions, Antonioni suffered a few false starts before expressing his unique directorial vision and voice in his first realized short film, Gente del Po, a moving portrait of fisherman in the misty Po Valley where he was raised. Uncomfortable with the neo-realist thrust of Italian cinema, Antonioni directed a series of eccentric and oblique documentary shorts that, in retrospect, reveal his desire to investigate the psyche's mysterious interiors. In his first fictional feature, Story of a Love Affair, Antonioni immediately subtly challenged traditional plot and audience expectation in ways that anticipate the formal and emotional expressionist dynamic that would fully flower within the groundbreaking Die mit der Liebe spielen (1960).\n\nReversing its raucous 1960 premiere to an infuriated Cannes audience, L'Avventura was rapturously lauded by fellow artists and filmmakers and awarded a special Jury Prize \"for its remarkable contribution toward the search for a new cinematic language.\" It also presented the controlled ambivalence of Monica Vitti, who would become his partner, muse and psychological constant throughout his famed trilogy of L'Avventura, Die Nacht (1961) and Sonnenfinsternis (1962) in addition to the exquisite Rote Wüste (1964), a film that marked another significant shift toward expressive color, male leads and working with soft focus and faster cuts. After the phenomenal commercial success of the MGM-produced Blow Up (1966), Antonioni was devastated by the anti-climactic box office disaster of Zabriskie Point (1970) and returned to documentary. Invited to make Chung Kuo China by the Chinese government, Antonioni delivered a mesmerizing yet unsentimental four-hour tour of China which was vehemently rejected by its solicitors. A few years later, Antonioni returned to fictional form in his last masterpiece, Beruf: Reporter (1975), an enigmatic fable of vaporous identity that offers a bold companion piece to L'Avventura. Aside from the thematically retrospective Identifikation einer Frau (1982) and a period film made for television, Das Geheimnis von Oberwald (1980) in which he conducted unusual experiments with color and video, Antonioni closed out his career with mostly short films, many of which were made after he suffered a stroke in 1985.\n\nTremendously influential yet largely taken for granted, Antonioni made difficult, abstract cinema mainstream. Embracing an anarchic geometry, Antonioni turned the architecture of narrative filmmaking inside-out in the most eloquent way possible, with many of his iconic scenes eternally preserved in the depths of the cinema's psyche. Observing modern maladies without judgment - sexism, dissolution of family and tradition, ecological/technological quandaries and the eternal questions of our place in the cosmos - Antonioni's prescience continues to resonate deeply as we find our way in the quickly moving fog.\n\nErnst Ingmar Bergman was born July 14, 1918, the son of a priest. The film and T.V. series, Die besten Absichten (1992) is biographical and shows the early marriage of his parents. The film Sonntagskinder (1992) depicts a bicycle journey with his father. In the miniseries Enskilda samtal (1996) is the trilogy closed. Here, as in 'Den Goda Viljan' Pernilla August play his mother. Note that all three movies are not always full true biographical stories. He began his career early with a puppet theatre which he, his sister and their friends played with. But he was the manager. Strictly professional he begun writing in 1941. He had written a play called 'Kaspers död' (A.K.A. 'Kaspers Death') which was produced the same year. It became his entrance into the movie business as Stina Bergman (not a close relative), from the company S.F. (Swedish Filmindustry), had seen the play and thought that there must be some dramatic talent in young Ingmar. His first job was to save other more famous writers' poor scripts. Under one of that script-saving works he remembered that he had written a novel about his last year as a student. He took the novel, did the save-poor-script job first, then wrote a screenplay on his own novel. When he went back to S.F., he delivered two scripts rather than one. The script was Die Hörige (1944) and was the fist Bergman screenplay that was put into film (by Alf Sjöberg). It was also in that movie Bergman did his first professional film-director job. Because Alf Sjöberg was busy, Bergman got the order to shoot the last sequence of the film. Ingmar Bergman is the father of Daniel Bergman, director, and Mats Bergman, actor at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater. Ingmar Bergman was also C.E.O. of the same theatre between 1963-1966, where he hired almost every professional actor in Sweden. In 1976 he had a famous tax problem. Bergman had trusted other people to advise him on his finances, but it turned out to be very bad advice. Bergman had to leave the country immediately, and so he went to Germany. A few years later he returned to Sweden and made his last theatrical film Fanny und Alexander (1982). In later life he retired from movie directing, but still wrote scripts for film and T.V. and directed plays at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre for many years. He died peacefully in his sleep on July 30, 2007.\n\nWriter, director, and producer Nicolas Winding Refn was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1970 to Anders Refn, a film director, and editor, and Vibeke Winding (née Tuxen), a cinematographer. At the age of 8, NWR moved to New York with his parents, where he would stay for the rest of his youth. The grandeur and grit of 1980s Manhattan left a deep impression on the young NWR, who then only spoke Danish. Calling the city home ever since, he would devote his career to exploring the filmic legacy of this iconic cityscape, developing a distinctive, neo-noir cinematic style.\n\nIn 1987, NWR returned to Copenhagen to complete his high school education, but upon graduation, he swiftly returned to New York, where he attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. NWR's college years were cut short when NWR threw a desk at a classroom wall and was expelled from the Academy. Instead, he applied to the directing program at the distinguished Danish Film School and was immediately accepted. However, this education was also to be short-lived, as NWR dropped out a month before the start of the semester.\n\nDuring these educational bouts, NWR experimented passionately with the short film format, writing, directing, and starring in his own productions. In 1993, an obscure Danish cable TV channel offered to air his short film Pusher, which led to the offer of a lifetime. NWR was given 3.2 million kroner (roughly USD 306,000) to transform the short into a feature. At 24 years old, NWR used the funding to write and direct the feature film Pusher (1996), a brutal portrayal of the criminal underworld of Copenhagen. Notorious, violent, and uncompromising in its social themes, Pusher won NWR instant national and international critical acclaim and remains a cult title amongst film aficionados. The success of his debut opened doors and spurred him to push the boundaries of filmmaking further, resulting in the similarly gritty Bleeder (1999), which portrayed a network of Copenhagen's working-class denizens living and working at the edge of the law. Highly stylized and focused on introverted emotional reactions to epic situations, this film was a turning point for shaping NWR's future career. Bleeder was selected for the 1999 Venice International Film Festival and won the prestigious FIPRESCI Prize in Sarajevo.\n\nNWR's third feature, the much-anticipated Fear X - Im Angesicht der Angst (2003), was his first foray into English-language movies. Starring the award-winning actor John Turturro, Fear X premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was highly divisive to critics, and its release was a massive financial disaster that left NWR broke and in debt. In dire desperation and needing to pay off his debt, NWR returned to Denmark to revisit his first feature film, the successful Pusher. NWR was reluctant to return to his past success but decided he could make commercially viable and artistically pleasing films in the Pusher franchise. Over the short course of two years, NWR managed to write, direct, and produce the two sequels, Pusher II (2004) and Pusher III (2005). The films' box office performance validated the success of the internationally renowned Pusher trilogy. In 2005, the Toronto Film Festival held a Pusher retrospective showing all three features, cementing its worldwide phenomenon. Around this time, while still looking for financial stability following his Fear X experience, NWR took a quick gig directing an episode of the iconic UK television mystery series Agatha Christie's Agatha Christie's Marple (2004).\n\nWith such critical acclaim from the newly released Pusher II and Pusher III, NWR's reputation as a writer, director, and producer was solidly reaffirmed in the film industry. NWR and his wife, Liv Corfixen, were the subjects of an acclaimed documentary, Gambler (2006), which premiered at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in 2005. In addition, NWR received two lifetime-achievement awards: one from the Taipei International Film Festival in 2006 and the second from the Valencia International Film Festival in 2007. Gambler won the Emerging Master Award from the Philadelphia International Film Festival 2005.\n\nLongtime UK based distributor and friend of NWR, Rupert Preston, urged him to accept an offer to write and direct Bronson (2008), an ultra-violent and stylistically surreal film following the real-life landmarks and self-entrapment of Charles Bronson, Britain's most notorious criminal. Even before the film was released, Bronson made waves inside and outside the film industry. The 2009 Sundance Film Festival selected the film for its World Cinema Dramatic Competition, and Bronson soon became the talk of the festival. With such a prestigious premiere, Bronson was chosen for other major international film festivals and reaped substantial box-office results. But even with such a buzz surrounding the film, no one could predict how the British press would bite at Bronson's bit. The content was close to the knuckle, the subject matter controversial, but NWR's take on this was even more inspired, leading him to be labeled by the British media as the next great auteur of European cinema. The film won Best Film at the 2009 Sydney Film Festival. Tom Hardy also won a Best Actor award at the 2009 British Independent Film Awards for his portrayal of Charles Bronson.\n\nFollowing the highly successful Bronson, NWR embarked on another English-language, and his first digitally shot, feature film, Walhalla Rising (2009), inspired by a story his mother would read to him at the age of five, about a father and son who embark on a trip to the moon. He creatively embraced not recalling the ending of this story, solidifying his longtime fascination with the unknown. The film, starring frequent collaborator Mads Mikkelsen, premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival and led the world media to coin his distinctive filmic style as \"Refn-esque.\"\n\nIn 2011, NWR directed the American neo-noir crime drama Drive (2011), starring rising Hollywood star Ryan Gosling. It premiered in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation, with NWR winning the award for Best Director. The film was praised for its direction, cinematography, actors' performances, visuals, action sequences, and musical score. However, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence, finding it potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Nonetheless, the film was still a commercial success, grossing $81 million against a production budget of $15 million. Several critics listed Drive as one of the best films of 2011, including the National Board of Review. Its honors include a nomination for Best Sound Editing at the 84th Academy Awards. Shortly after the massive success of Drive, Nicolas signed a two-picture deal, which led to the feature films Only God Forgives (2013) and The Neon Demon (2016).\n\nThe incredibly anticipated follow-up to Drive, Only God Forgives (2013), was a crime thriller set in Bangkok starring Ryan Gosling (now a top name in Hollywood) and cinematic veteran Kristin Scott Thomas, premiering in competition at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. It was shot on location in Thailand and was dedicated to Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky, a longtime friend of Nicolas. The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The film won the Grand Prize at the Sydney Film Festival. Nicolas's experience making the Only God Forgives was documented by his wife, Liv Corfixen, in the film My Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (2014). Corfixen's documentary, in turn, premiered at Fantastic Fest in Austin, TX, and at Beyond Fest in Los Angeles, CA, to positive reviews.\n\nIn November of 2014, NWR, alongside co-producers Gaumont Film Company and Wild Bunch, announced that his next film would be titled The Neon Demon (2016). The Neon Demon would be filmed in Los Angeles, CA, in early 2015. The film featured a cast of some of Hollywood's greatest names, including Elle Fanning, Karl Glusman, Keanu Reeves, Christina Hendricks, Abbey Lee, Jena Malone, and Bella Heathcote. On April 14, 2016, it was announced that the film would compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, marking it as the third consecutive film directed by NWR that had competed for the Palme d'Or. After The Neon Demon, Nicolas decided to take a turn and explored the path of the long-form narrative streaming series, starting with Too Old to Die Young (2019) and ending with Copenhagen Cowboy (2022).\n\nIn 2019, Nicolas created his first television series, Too Old to Die Young (2019), which premiered on Amazon Prime 2019. The thirteen-and-a-half-hour, ten-episode streaming neo-noir series was written by NWR and legendary comic book author Ed Brubaker, with NWR directing all ten episodes. The series starred Miles Teller alongside William Baldwin, Jena Malone, John Hawkes, Cristina Rodlo, Augusto Aguilera, Nell Tiger Free, Babs Olusanmokun, and Callie Hernandez, as well as Hart Bochner. The series features NWR's fourth collaboration with composer Cliff Martinez, whose original score for Drive had become an instant classic. Episodes four and five of the series premiered out of competition at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on May 18. The full series was released on Amazon Prime Video on June 14 of the same year.\n\nNWR followed up Too Old to Die Young with yet another limited streaming series, Copenhagen Cowboy (2022), produced by Netflix. The series follows enigmatic young heroine, Miu (Angela Bundalovic), who after a lifetime of servitude and on the verge of a new beginning, traverses the ominous landscape of Copenhagen's criminal netherworld. Searching for justice and enacting vengeance, she encounters her nemesis, Rakel, (Lola Corfixen) as they embark on an odyssey where the two young women discover they are not alone, they are many. It was shot in NWR's native Copenhagen, where he hadn't filmed since completing his Pusher trilogy. NWR created and directed all six episodes. The six-episode supernatural noir-thriller first premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2022. The series was released on the Netflix platform on January 5, 2023. A documentary entitled Copenhagen Cowboy: Nightcall with Nicolas Winding Refn (2023) and directed by Nicklas Kold Nagel, was released on Netflix detailing the limited series production.\n\nAfter Copenhagen Cowboy, NWR was contacted by Prada to create an installation as a backdrop for their SS23 women's collection fashion show in addition to directing a 30-minute short film, Touch of Crude (2022). The short film follows three different women, played by NWR's wife, Liv Corfixen, and daughters, Lola Corfixen and Lizzielou Corfixen, who discover a mysterious entity and unearth its enigmatic secret. The film marked the first collaboration with Prada, which simultaneously premiered at the León Film Festival in 2023.\n\nConsidered to be one of the most pivotal stars of the early days of Hollywood, Charlie Chaplin lived an interesting life both in his films and behind the camera. He is most recognized as an icon of the silent film era, often associated with his popular character, the Little Tramp; the man with the toothbrush mustache, bowler hat, bamboo cane, and a funny walk.\n\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born in Walworth, London, England on April 16, 1889, to Hannah Harriet Pedlingham (Hill) and Charles Chaplin, both music hall performers, who were married on June 22, 1885. After Charles Sr. separated from Hannah to perform in New York City, Hannah then tried to resurrect her stage career. Unfortunately, her singing voice had a tendency to break at unexpected moments. When this happened, the stage manager spotted young Charlie standing in the wings and led him on stage, where five-year-old Charlie began to sing a popular tune. Charlie and his half-brother, Syd Chaplin spent their lives in and out of charity homes and workhouses between their mother's bouts of insanity. Hannah was committed to Cane Hill Asylum in May 1903 and lived there until 1921, when Chaplin moved her to California.\n\nChaplin began his official acting career at the age of eight, touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads. At age 18, he began touring with Fred Karno's vaudeville troupe, joining them on the troupe's 1910 United States tour. He traveled west to California in December 1913 and signed on with Keystone Studios' popular comedy director Mack Sennett, who had seen Chaplin perform on stage in New York. Charlie soon wrote his brother Syd, asking him to become his manager. While at Keystone, Chaplin appeared in and directed 35 films, starring as the Little Tramp in nearly all.\n\nIn November 1914, he left Keystone and signed on at Essanay, where he made 15 films. In 1916, he signed on at Mutual and made 12 films. In June 1917, Chaplin signed up with First National Studios, after which he built Chaplin Studios. In 1919, he and Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith formed United Artists (UA).\n\nChaplin's life and career was full of scandal and controversy. His first big scandal was during World War I, at which time his loyalty to England, his home country, was questioned. He had never applied for American citizenship, but claimed that he was a \"paying visitor\" to the United States. Many British citizens called Chaplin a coward and a slacker. This and other career eccentricities sparked suspicion with FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), who believed that he was injecting Communist propaganda into his films. Chaplin's later film Der große Diktator (1940), which was his first \"talkie\", also created a stir. In the film, Chaplin plays a humorous caricature of Adolf Hitler. Some thought the film was poorly done and in bad taste. However, the film grossed over $5 million and earned five Academy Award Nominations.\n\nAnother scandal occurred when Chaplin briefly dated 22 year-old Joan Barry. However, Chaplin's relationship with Barry came to an end in 1942, after a series of harassing actions from her. In May 1943, Barry returned to inform Chaplin that she was pregnant and filed a paternity suit, claiming that the unborn child was his. During the 1944 trial, blood tests proved that Chaplin was not the father, but at the time, blood tests were inadmissible evidence, and he was ordered to pay $75 a week until the child turned 21.\n\nChaplin also was scrutinized for his support in aiding the Russian struggle against the invading Nazis during World War II, and the United States government questioned his moral and political views, suspecting him of having Communist ties. For this reason, HUAC subpoenaed him in 1947. However, HUAC finally decided that it was no longer necessary for him to appear for testimony. Conversely, when Chaplin and his family traveled to London for the premier of Rampenlicht (1952), he was denied re-entry to the United States. In reality, the government had almost no evidence to prove that he was a threat to national security. Instead, he and his wife decided to settle in Switzerland.\n\nChaplin was married four times and had a total of 11 children. In 1918, he married Mildred Harris and they had a son together, Norman Spencer Chaplin, who lived only three days. Chaplin and Harris divorced in 1920. He married Lita Grey in 1924, who had two sons, Charles Chaplin Jr. and Sydney Chaplin. They were divorced in 1927. In 1936, Chaplin married Paulette Goddard, and his final marriage was to Oona O'Neill (Oona Chaplin), daughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill in 1943. Oona gave birth to eight children: Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Chaplin, Josephine Chaplin, Victoria Chaplin, Eugene Chaplin, Jane Chaplin, Annette-Emilie Chaplin, and Christopher Chaplin.\n\nIn contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a great deal. He also had an \"un-millionaire\" way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations. In 1921, Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972, he was honored with an Academy Award for his \"incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century\". He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year's Honours List. No formal reason for the honour was listed. The citation simply reads \"Charles Spencer Chaplin, Film Actor and Producer\".\n\nChaplin's other works included musical scores that he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, \"My Autobiography\" (1964) and its companion volume, \"My Life in Pictures\" (1974).\n\nChaplin died at age 88 of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. His funeral was a small and private Anglican ceremony according to his wishes. In 1978, Chaplin's corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement.\n\nSix of Chaplin's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: The Immigrant (1917), Der Vagabund und das Kind (1921), Goldrausch (1925), Lichter der Großstadt (1931), Moderne Zeiten (1936), and Der große Diktator (1940).\n\nCharlie Chaplin is considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp's positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.\n\nVincent Gallo. American-born, Buffalo, New York, 1961. Left home, moved to New York City in 1978, and began playing in the experimental musical group, Gray, with artist Jean Michel Basquiat. After leaving Gray, he formed the band, Bohack, and recorded the highly regarded avant-garde industrial noise album, \"It Took Several Wives\".\n\nDuring the same period, Gallo also became known in New York City for his very unusual street performances, which were spontaneously executed in public and also witnessed by invited guests in the know. The One-Armed Man, The Man with No Face, Sandman, Boy Hit by a Car, and Boy Cries in Restaurant Window, to name a few. These radical public performances were upsetting and disturbing and were meant to provoke thought, self-reflection and consciousness. Gallo's invited guests could witness his performance's impact in this larger public context.\n\nOne invited guest, New York Underground filmmaker, Eric Mitchell, cast Gallo as the lead in his film, So wie es ist/Eurydice in den Avenuen (1985), alongside newcomer Steve Buscemi. So wie es ist/Eurydice in den Avenuen (1985) was Gallo's first appearance in a feature-length film, though previously he had directed himself in several short films, including If You Feel Froggy, Jump (1980), The Gunlover (1986) and Rocky 10, as well as the collaborations with filmmaker Michael Holman, Vincent Gallo as \"Jesus Christ\" (used in Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996)) and Vampire LeStat.\n\nSince his early performance art days, Gallo has continued to create very conceptual performance pieces. Examples are a series of protesting of protests. Gallo has also created his own website, which upon closer examination, is actually a highly conceptual artwork resonating with his early performance work.\n\nOn his website www.vincentgallo.com in the merchandise section, Gallo is selling his sperm and sexual fantasies as conceptual works. Gallo's Internet art questions celebrity, procreation, ego, social agenda, and views of religion, race and sexuality. These public offerings are motivated by extreme sensitivity, concept and thoughtfulness, however their presentation appears crude and offensive. Misinterpretation of this work is common and Gallo is often incorrectly categorized as a racist, sexist, homophobe. Gallo has had over 25 one-man shows of his paintings, including several with famed New York art dealer, Annina Nosei, and 4 museum shows including one at the Hara Museum in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nGallo has also released several musical albums including 2 on the prestigious Warp Records label-When and Recordings of Music for Film. Gallo wrote, composed and performed the original music for the films Buffalo '66 (1998), The Agent (1990) and Promises Written in Water (2010).\n\nIn the 1980s, Gallo reached the professional level of Grand Prix motorcycle racing, though he did not win a national championship. Gallo is one of the actual motorcycle riders in his feature film, The Brown Bunny (2003).\n\nFor many years, Gallo has been known and highly respected in hi-fi and music recording circles and is considered by many professionals in the field as having world-class knowledge and experience. He has been published many times by specialty magazines focused on high fidelity designs and equipment as well as music recording techniques and equipment. His collection of vintage hi-fi and recording gear, as well as musical instruments, is amongst the largest and most refined in the world. Gallo is also a fanatic record collector, owning over 35,000 vinyl LP's.\n\nGallo has no agent, manager, assistant or intern and he makes his films without producers, and with extremely scaled down crews. He has self-distributed his movies and is directly involved in his films' sales for distribution. Gallo has also created all of his films' trailers and posters.\n\nGallo is one of the most misunderstood, misquoted, misrepresented talents in the past 25 years and a brief review of his IMDb page suggests he has also been incredibly prolific."
