        "meta_description": "Mental health issues depicted on the big screen can resonate deeply with audiences, fostering dialogue and understanding. Paul Jerndal, an award-winning Swedish filmmaker and passionate advocate for mental health, chose to channel his activism through film early in his career. On 6 June, he was announced the winner of the 2023 Health for All Film Festival (HAFF) Very Short Film category for his compelling short film “Mirrors”.“Through the medium of film, we have the power to illuminate the complexities of mental health conditions, initiate meaningful conversations and contribute to destigmatizing the challenges faced by countless individuals,” said Jerndal. “Films and other artistic expressions can serve as catalysts for dialogue and genuine support, truly breaking down barriers. Accepting this esteemed award is a tremendous honour, but above all, my hope is that it further amplifies the significance of mental health, reminding people that they are not alone in their struggles with negative thoughts.”With his powerful short film featuring Swedish celebrities Anis Don Demina, Cecilia von der Esch and Danny Saucedo, Jerndal dives into the depths of self-criticism and introspection. As the protagonists encounter their mirror images, confronting their worst thoughts but also finding their inner friend, the viewer is taken on a journey through striking visuals and evocative storytelling.“Anyone can experience mental ill health at any point in their life – this has become particularly clear to all of us over the past few years, especially during COVID-19. Despite that, there is still a great deal of stigma attached to having a mental health condition,” emphasized Ledia Lazeri, Regional Adviser for Mental Health at WHO/Europe. “That’s why film is such an important medium – it can help us see ourselves and our loved ones in those who are suffering from mental ill health.”Lazeri continued, “Films can also have a lasting impact on policy-making and public perception. When a well crafted film successfully tackles mental health issues, it has the potential to generate public interest and influence policy-makers to prioritize mental health in their agendas. It’s great to see the Health for All Film Festival contributions that have had the courage to take on this important topic, and among them, ‘Mirrors’.”Jerndal explained, “‘Mirrors’ was made with support from a Swedish non-profit organization called 29k, which has previously collaborated with Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet to feature online psychologist chat services. It’s a great example of what art, partnerships and different actors in society can achieve when they come together.” Throughout his career in film, Jerndal has worked with national campaigns and non-profit associations in Sweden. He produced the award-winning film on suicide prevention “Steps for life” in 2017. Together with the Swedish Red Cross, he is currently spearheading a 3-year campaign called “How are you?” (Hur mår du?) for youth in challenged areas.“Young people’s openness, drive and natural way of talking about how they feel, if given the space, is both inspiring and encouraging. My dream is that friends, families, classmates, teammates – everyone – should dare to talk more with each other about how they feel,” Jerndal expressed.  “One of the girls in the project said: ‘Somewhere in this world, right now, there’s someone who feels exactly the same as you are feeling right now. You are not alone.’ That’s the exact line actress Cecilia von der Esch says in ‘Mirrors’, and I think it is so comforting and helpful for everyone struggling with their mental health.” Mental health conditions are very common, affecting about 1 in 6 individuals in the WHO European Region. Most people affected do not receive treatment, in part because of stigma. Increasing social contact with people with mental health conditions is one of the best ways of reducing negative preconceptions and increasing empathy, awareness and access to care.  For the fourth consecutive year, HAFF received hundreds of submissions from all over the world, competing in the categories of Universal Health Coverage, Health Emergencies, Better Health and Well-Being, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, Climate Change and Health, and Very Short Film.Since 2020 HAFF has gathered more than 4300 submissions from 110 countries, illustrating health challenges and opportunities people face across the globe.-----------------------The headline of this article was amended on 07 June 2023.
