A Brief History Of Film Genres

Film genres have evolved significantly since the early 20th century. Silent films of the 1910s and 1920s, such as comedies and dramas, set the foundation. The advent of sound in the late 1920s introduced new genres like musicals. The Golden Age of Hollywood (1930s-1950s) saw the rise of iconic genres, including film noir, westerns, and screwball comedies. In the latter half of the 20th century, genres like science fiction, horror, and action gained prominence. Today, genres continue to evolve, blending elements to create sub-genres and hybrid films.
