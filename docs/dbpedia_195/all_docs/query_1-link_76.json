In 2020, the Bulldogs will field its 148th team and the venerated Yale Bowl celebrates its 106th anniversary. The first football team on any level to reach 800 wins, Yale has won recognition as national champion or co-champion in 27 seasons from one or more of the selection systems listed by the NCAA Record Book. From 1872 until 1909 Yale was the scourge of college football. The Elis sat atop Mount Olympus as a national football power with a mind-numbing 324 wins against 17 losses and 18 ties. The impregnable Yale dynasty piled up wins like cordwood. Walter Camp, who played and coached at Yale, is the high priest of Yale football. And many consider him the father of college football. John Heisman said, “What Washington was to his country, Camp was to American football: the friend, the founder and father.” College football began as an upper-class Ivy League endeavor. The sons of the rich and famous experimented with this new game which was an amalgam of rugby and soccer. It was Camp’s rule revisions that helped modernize a game that was viewed as crude and barbaric. Yale has had a cascade of talented players. More than 100 AllAmericans, including two Heisman Trophy winners, Larry Kelley (1936) and Clint Frank (1937), have worn the Blue uniform. And a total of 26 players and four coaches are enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. Yale has launched 34 players to the NFL including such stars as Calvin Hill (Cowboys), the NFL Rookie of the Year in 1969, Mike Pyle, who captained the Chicago Bears and others like Gary Fencik (Bears), Dick Jauron (Lions), Eric Johnson (49ers) and more recently, Tyler Varga (Colts), Foyesade Oluokun (Falcons), and Jaeden Graham (Falcons). 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Yale football program has won or shared 16 Ivy League titles since the Ancient Eight began formal play in 1956. Entering the 2020 season, the Bulldogs have a lifetime 915–380–55 record. Yale ranks nationally in the top ten in lifetime wins. A forfeit win against Penn in 1997 is not recognized by the NCAA. In addition to their traditional Ivy League opponents, Yale has played and defeated Notre Dame, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maryland, Georgia, Virginia, Virginia Tech, North Carolina, Villanova, Rutgers, Boston College, Penn State, Army, Navy, Air Force, Hawaii and others. The Bulldogs are the only team that has played and defeated all of the United States military academies. The Yale Bowl, constructed in 1914, defines tradition. It was declared a National Historic Landmark and was chosen by the Sporting News as one of the 40 best college football stadiums in its 2005 book, Saturday Shrines. The Bulldogs have played 631 games in the historic Bowl where their mark stands at 397–213–21 entering the 2019 season. George “Papa Bear” Halas, the legendary Chicago Bears coach was honored at the Walter Camp annual dinner in 1981 at the Yale Commons. While in New Haven, he said, “Do you know what the greatest football program in America was? It wasn’t the Chicago Bears; it wasn’t the New York Giants; it was Yale!” Knute Rockne, the iconic Notre Dame football coach, had deep respect for Yale football as well. When asked where he got the idea for the famed Notre Dame shift, he is said to have replied, “Where everything else in football came from—Yale!”\n\n2\n\nThe highlighTs 1872 (1–0) Captain: David S. Schaff From 1872 to 1887 the team captain assumed coaching duties and was empowered to appoint ﬁeld coaches. Oct. 1: David schley schaff, elliot s. Miller, samuel elder, and other members of the class of 1873 called a meeting of the Yale student body. From it emerged the Yale Football Association, the ﬁrst formal entity to govern the game at Yale. schaff, who attended the Rugby school in england where he played football, was elected president and team captain. Nov. 16: With faculty approval, Yale met Columbia and won, 3 goals to 0, in the ﬁrst (so-called) football game ever played by a Yale team. According to The New York Times, “some of Columbia’s team arrived on the morning’s boat and some of them on the eleven o’clock train.” The contest, that started at 2:45 p.m. at hamilton Park in New haven, drew 400 to 500 fans, mostly Yale students who paid a 25-cent admission fee. it was a time when patrons rode in their carriages from Whalley Avenue to hamilton Park, a fairgrounds with a trotting track on the edge of town. schaff did not play because of an injury incurred the day before in practice. Tommy sherman booted the ﬁrst Yale goal and lew irwin the other two. The team that scored ﬁve goals ﬁrst was to be the winner, or if darkness prevented the game from going further, which it did, the team with the most goals would be the winner. The New York Times referred to the contest as “the match game of foot-ball.” Although it has been recorded as a football game, it was not the football we know today. instead, it was a soccer match with 20 players on a side played on a ﬁeld 400 by 250 feet. The game was played with a rubber \n\n187–1875 The highlighTS\n\nball. Players were allowed to be more physical than in today’s typical soccer style. Batting the ball with the hands and arms and pushing other players with the body were permitted. goals as they still are scored were executed by kicking the ball between two posts. A crossbar was added to the goal 15 feet off the ground. After the game both teams enjoyed dinner together at lockwood’s Restaurant. According to the New Haven Register, “The contest excited considerable applause,” and what’s more, “Yale discipline prevailed over Columbia muscle.”\n\n187 (2–1) Captain: William halstead Yale was led by captain William halstead, who became one of the most prominent surgeons in the history of the United states. Dr. halstead was a pioneer in various surgical techniques and is credited for introducing surgical rubber gloves in the United states. Nov. 15: led by captain Cyrus Dershimer, the Princeton Tigers beat Yale, 3 goals to 0, at hamilton Park to inaugurate Yale’s oldest rivalry. A Yale player, george M. gunn, and a Princeton player both kicked the ball at the same time and the ball rose into the air about 20 feet and fell with the stuﬃng kicked out of it. A half-hour delay was necessary until another ball could be obtained. in 1926 gunn turned the ball over to Princeton University. On May 23, 1944, ﬁre destroyed the University gymnasium at Princeton. Reportedly lost in the ﬁre were many athletic trophies including the relic ball from the 1873 Yale-Princeton game.\n\n187 (–0) Captain: hugh J. McBirney Yale played a three-game schedule at hamilton Park, defeating stevens institute and Columbia twice. There were 20 players to a side.\n\n1875 (2–2) Captain: William Arnold Arnold was photographed in front of the original Yale Fence which has since become a landmark for every Yale captain in each sport. The Yale Fence used today and located in the Ray Tompkins house is not the original that inexplicably escaped the university after 1952 and at this writing is in the hands of a Connecticut resident. \n\nThe highlighTS 1875\n\nFrom 1872 to 1875 goals were earned by kicking the ball “into the net” as we know in soccer with the exception of the 1875 Yale-harvard game when a goal was earned only after a successful kick “over the crossbar” following a touchdown. Field goals were given equal weight (one goal). This was the method of scoring from 1876 to 1882. A goal was kicked over the crossbar from a point in front of where the touchdown had gone over the line. Yale played a four-game schedule from November 6 to December 4 that included Rutgers, harvard, Wesleyan and Columbia, ﬁnishing 2–2. The wins came against Rutgers and Wesleyan. Oct. 20: Yale defeated Wesleyan, 6 goals to 0, launching a series in which the Blue piled up 46 wins without a loss in a 38-year span. The overmatched Cardinals scored just 12 points in the series: two ﬁeld goals and one touchdown. Nov. 1: The dawning of the storied Yale-harvard rivalry began when the two schools played at hamilton Park in New haven on a slightly overcast day with no wind. The game was triggered by harvard captain Nathaniel Curtis who challenged Yale captain William Arnold. it was advertised as a “Foot Ball Match” with the starting time at 2:30 p.m. in the morning the Yale men gave the harvard team a tour of New haven. The harvard players wore crimson shirts, stockings and knee britches setting them off in vivid contrast to the dark trousers, blue shirts and yellow caps of the Yalies. The elegantly designed four-page game day program measured 5.5 × 4 inches in size. Yale reportedly promised harvard $75 for its visit. A total of 15 men comprised a side and it was agreed that the game would be divided into three 30-minute periods. Because each team had its own notion of football, it was known as a “concessionary game,” a hybrid form of today’s game with the teams using a combination of soccer and rugby rules. it was agreed that the players would be allowed to use their hands to carry the ball as harvard preferred. Yale football resembled the sport of soccer whereas harvard played a more physical rugby style. Tutored by Mcgill in Canada from its two games played the year before, harvard played Canadian rugby that some called “Boston Football.” A player was allowed to run with the ball, pass it and dribble it. Also, the man with the ball could be tackled. it was reportedly the second “ball carrying” contest 5\n\n1876 The highlighTS\n\nof football ever waged. Touchdowns only counted if they were followed by goals that were kicked over a crossbar. The ﬁeld measured 140 by 70 yards. The Crimson won the inaugural, 4 goals to 0, in front of an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 fans who paid a 50-cent admission price, twice the normal charge of a Yale game. Walter Camp, who would enroll at Yale the following year, reportedly attended the contest. h.C. leeds, W.s. seamans, A.C. Tower, B.s. Blanchard and h.W. Cushing ﬁgured in the harvard scoring. harvard scored four touchdowns but was not credited with a score because the kick after was not made. The elis had to familiarize themselves with the oval rugby ball that was a bit rounder than the one in use today, still a contrast to the round soccer ball. During the course of the contest the ball collapsed and had to be re-inﬂated on the ﬁeld. Although the ﬂedgling, rugged elis lost in battle, they learned their lesson well and reportedly enjoyed the harvard rugby style better than their soccer style. “in the evening the teams were entertained at supper and representatives of the two colleges sang in the college yard,” wrote Thomas Bergin in The Game: The Harvard-Yale Football Rivalry, 1875–1983.\n\n1876 (–0) Captain: eugene V. Baker For the ﬁrst time Yale played rugby football with 11 players on a side. Only goals counted in scoring. A goal was earned if the kick was made after a touchdown. Field goals were given equal weight to a goal that was scored by a TD and followed by a successful kick. Nov. 18: For the only time in Yale football history, Yale opened the season against harvard, a 1 goal to 0 victory at hamilton Park. There were 11 players on a side, a rule that Yale ﬁrmly requested. Only goals counted in scoring. harvard scored four touchdowns, but no goal followed. Thus, it did not register any goals (points). Yale won on a 35-yard ﬁeld goal kick over the crossbar by Oliver Thompson. This ignited the Yale following to enter the playing ﬁeld and carry the Yale combatants on their shoulders, delaying action for 20 minutes. Nov. 0: Yale edged Princeton, 2 goals to 0, in hoboken, New Jersey, the ﬁrst time a Yale football team played on the road. The Tigers wore their colors for the ﬁrst time showing up with black shirts and an orange 6\n\nThe highlighTS 1877–1879\n\nP on the chest. Walter Camp reportedly threw a forward pass to teammate Oliver Thompson. The referee, apparently perplexed by this unorthodox tactic, tossed a coin to make his decision and permitted it to stand. Camp, however, could not be credited with throwing the ﬁrst forward pass because it was illegal until 1906. Dec. 9: Yale beat Columbia, 2 goals to 0, in a rugby-style game with 11 players on each side. it was the latest date in the season that the Yale football team ever played.\n\n1877 (–0–1) Captain: eugene V. Baker Baker captained the Yale team for the second straight year. Yale beat Tufts, Trinity and stevens institute in games with 11 players on a side. harvard and Yale did not meet because harvard opposed Yale’s insistence on playing with an 11-man team. The debate over 11 players or 15 players on the ﬁeld was the source of controversy for the ﬁrst several years of Yale football. Dec. 8: Yale and Princeton played a scoreless tie in hoboken, New Jersey. Yale acquiesced to playing with 15 players to a side in that contest.\n\n1878 (–1–1) Captain: Walter Camp Walter Camp captained the 1878 and 1879 Yale teams. An 1880 graduate, he also played in ’81 and ’82 since postgraduates were allowed to participate at the time. Camp was elected captain again in 1881 but had to stop playing because of his medical school studies. All games in 1878 were played with 15 players on a side. Touchdowns were used as tiebreakers. Nov. 2: Yale beat harvard, 1 goal to 0, on the Boston National league Baseball grounds, home of the Boston Red stockings baseball team. Again, it was Oliver Thompson’s ﬁeld goal that proved the difference. During the game the ball rolled off the ﬁeld into a pool of water in which players from both sides ﬂung themselves. “After some competitive wallowing Camp emerged with the ball, soaked but triumphant,” wrote Parke h. Davis in Football, The American Intercollegiate Game. Nov. 28: Yale’s only loss of the season came at the hands of Princeton, 1–0.\n\n1879 (–0–2) Captain: Walter Camp From 1879 to 1884 Yale went 36–0–5. 7\n\n1880 The highlighTS\n\nNov. 8: Yale and harvard played to a scoreless tie. There were 15 players on a side and only goals were counted in scoring: Touchdowns were used as a tiebreaker. Camp, the Yale captain, kicked the only ﬁeld goal of the game but it was nulliﬁed because the ball was touched by a harvard player. The game day program from that game sold for nearly $1,500 in 2010. The week after the Yale-harvard game, Camp refereed the harvardPrinceton game in hoboken. Nov. 27: Yale and Princeton also played to a scoreless tie.\n\n1880 (–0–1) Captain: Robert W. Watson Walter Camp successfully advised a rules committee in springﬁeld, Massachusetts, that teams should consist of 11 men on the ﬁeld, rather than 15. Camp, who was a guiding spirit of Yale football through most of its ﬁrst 50 years, is credited for the 11-man team and the line of scrimmage instead of the rugby scrum. The line of scrimmage allowed both teams to deploy their forces in contrast to the continuous style of rugby. The purpose was to increase scoring. The quarterback position was now able to use spoken signals and numerical scoring was introduced. The ﬁeld was reduced to 110 by 53 yards. The snap from center to quarterback was also instituted. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass. From this season on, teams were composed of 11 players. Nov. 20: After shutting out CoWalter Camp is considered by many lumbia, Brown and Penn, Yale beat to be the father of college football because of his many rule innova- harvard, one goal to zero, at the tions. Boston National league Baseball 8\n\nThe highlighTS 1881–1882\n\ngrounds. Camp scored the only goal of the game, a 35-yard drop-kick penalty goal. The game was played under the rules that Camp had argued for: 11 men to a side and the replacement of the scrum by the scrimmage. Yale captain Robert Watson returned a kickoff 100 yards but because the kick following the TD failed, Watson’s record run was nulliﬁed. Touchdowns were used as tiebreakers.\n\n1881 (5–0–1) Captain: Franklin M. eaton Camp was central to several more signiﬁcant rule changes that came to deﬁne American football. The ridiculous rule that allowed a team to control the ball an entire half remained because there was no provision for making the possessing team give up the ball. There was no “downs” system as we know today. Blocking the opposing team from gaining possession of the ball allowed a team to control the ball for long periods of time. Nov. 12: The oddity of winning a tie game occurred as Yale and harvard played to a scoreless ﬁnish but Yale was declared the winner on “fewest safety touchdowns,” a quirky rule that was used that season. Yale attempted the ﬁrst onside kick ever in front of an estimated 1,500 at hamilton Park in New haven on a rainy day. Nov. 2: Five days after Princeton and harvard played to a scoreless tie, Yale and Princeton played to a scoreless stalemate in a game that extended into two overtimes. This was known as the “block” game. Princeton held the ball the entire ﬁrst half and Yale did likewise in the second half. The Tigers used stalling tactics which led Camp to create a downs system in the rules for 1882. Camp recommended that a team must gain ﬁve yards in three downs, retreat 10 yards, or give up the ball.\n\n1882 (8–0) Captain: Ray Tompkins The “down” system was introduced by Camp. if on three successive downs a team did not advance the ball ﬁve yards or lost ten, it was required to give up the ball to the opposing team at the spot of the fourth down. This became the heart of the modern game and necessitated the linear markings (grids) on the ﬁeld parallel to the goal lines for the measuring of the distance advanced with the ball. The term gridiron was born from the grid markings. This was also the last year that a touchdown counted only if the kick following the TD was good. Yale began using voice signals before the ball was snapped. 9\n\n188 The highlighTS\n\nThe Ray Tompkins house, next to the Payne Whitney gymnasium is the headquarters for Yale’s athletic oﬃces. The facility is named in honor of Tompkins, who captained the 1882 and 1883 national championship Yale football teams. Funds for the facility were provided by the bequest of sarah Wey Tompkins, wife of the former Yale captain. Also in his memory, Mrs. Tompkins gave the Athletic Association more than 750 acres west of the Yale Bowl on which was built the Yale golf Course. Oct. 28: Yale blanked Rutgers in New Jersey, 5–0. This was the last game Camp ever played before he suffered a knee injury in practice a few days later. Nov. 25: Yale edged harvard, 1–0, at holmes Field in Cambridge before an estimated 3,000. The Blue made three touchdowns but converted only one goal kick after the TD, thus the 1–0 score. Touchdowns by Yale’s louis hall, Charles Beck and Arthur Farwell were erased because the goal kick failed following the TDs. Yale’s only score was registered in the second half by Beck, who recovered a fumble and ran it for a TD which was validated by eugene Richards’s kick. A scathing report from the Hartford Herald read, “harvard cannot defeat Yale at football unless she consents to place on her team men who would substitute toughness for skill and professional enmity for amateur courtesy. But such a team will never represent harvard and may never bear its honored name.” [Yale won the next six games that the two teams played.] Nov. 0: led by Tompkins, Yale ﬁnished 8–0, beating Princeton, 2– 1, in the Polo grounds, then located at Fifth Avenue and 110th street in New York City. The Tigers’ James haxall provided the highlight of the game when he drop-kicked a jaw-dropping 65-yard ﬁeld goal.\n\n188 (8–0) Captain: Ray Tompkins Thanks to the innovation of Camp, a touchdown was now valued at two points, the goal after the touchdown four points, a ﬁeld goal ﬁve points and one point for a safety. No longer was a goal validated by the kick following the TD. Proper blue uniforms were worn by the Yale team. Nov. 6: Yale waxed Rutgers, 98–0, in Brooklyn. Wyllis Terry kicked ﬁve ﬁeld goals. Nov. 17: Yale demolished Columbia, 93–0, its largest margin of victory ever against the lions. 10\n\nThe highlighTS 188\n\nNov. 29: Yale downed harvard, 23–2, on Thanksgiving Day at the Polo grounds in New York before an estimated 10,000 fans. The two points were the only points the elis gave up the entire season\n\n188 (8–0–1) Captain: eugene l. Richards A touchdown now counted for four points until 1898. A goal after the touchdown was worth two points and a safety was valued at 2 points while the ﬁeld goal stayed at ﬁve points. The two points after touchdown goal was kicked from a spot in front of where the touchdown had gone over the line. it wasn’t until 1922 that the ball was spotted directly in front of the goalposts for the try for point following the touchdown. Because Yale wanted a ﬁeld of its own, two members of the class of 1881—Adrian s. Van de graaff and henry s. White—spearheaded the purchase of land on the south side of Derby Avenue which became the new site of Yale Field, the current site of the baseball ﬁeld. The football team played on that ﬁeld starting this year. The ﬁeld ran from center ﬁeld to right ﬁeld on the baseball ﬁeld. The author has designated this as Yale Field i. Oct. 1: The elis defeated Wesleyan, 31–0, to inaugurate Yale Field i on Derby Avenue. That season the elis shutout the Middletown, Connecticut, liberal arts college three times (31–0, 63–0 and 46–0). The two teams played three games in a season seven different years. Oct. 25: Yale met a neophyte Dartmouth team for the ﬁrst time in a game that was played at hanover, New hampshire. halfback Wyllys Terry and Alex Coxe, a 290-pound guard, each scored four touchdowns as Yale rolled, 113–0. it was the ﬁrst time that Yale scored 100 points in a game. Despite the lopsided score, The Dartmouth headlined, “Dartmouth eleven Acquit Themselves Very Creditably.” The news story began, “The money which was spent to bring the Yale Rugby team up here seems to have been well invested. Our men have gained much practice, which it would be impossible for them to obtain from any picked eleven.” Nov. 5: Wyllys Terry set a record that still stands by running the length of the ﬁeld—110 yards—in Yale’s 46–0 win over Wesleyan. it wasn’t until 1912 that the ﬁeld was shortened to 100 yards. Nov. 22: Yale scorched harvard, 52–0, in New haven. Many years later, Red smith wrote, “it tied the track record for cruel and unusual punishment.” henry Flanders’s 100-yard run was the highlight play of the 11\n\n1885–1886 The highlighTS\n\ngame. sophomore QB Nervy Bayne scored three TDs for Yale. Bayne’s extracurricular activities outside the playing ﬁeld eventually resulted in his leaving Yale. in 1893, he organized lsU’s ﬁrst football team made up of former college men from Tulane and the southern Athletic Club.\n\n1885 (7–1) Captain: Frank g. Peters Per Camp’s recommendation, the offside penalty was determined to be ﬁve yards. harvard did not compete in football that season, a decision by the harvard faculty, who viewed the game of football as dangerous and degrading. “At the time a player could hack throttle, butt, trip, tackle below the hips, or strike an opponent with closed ﬁst three times before he was sent from the ﬁeld,” wrote Thomas Bergin in The Game: The HarvardYale Football Rivalry, 1875–1983. Nov. 21: Princeton’s henry “Tillie” lamar picked up a teammate’s fumble of a punt and ran 95 yards for a touchdown and a 6–5 victory over Yale in New haven. lamar’s feat broke a 47-game (42–0–5) Yale unbeaten streak. Yale would not lose again until the ﬁnal game of the 1889 season. And again, it was Princeton who rained on Yale’s parade.\n\n1886 (9–0–1) Captain: Robert N. Corwin Oct. 6: Yale whipped Wesleyan, 75–0, and three days later slammed the Cardinals again, 62–0. Yale counts 46 games vs. Wesleyan, but Wesleyan only 40. Oct. 0: Yale won by its highest score ever, embarrassing Wesleyan, 136–0, as QB henry “harry” Beecher, grandson of the famous preacher and abolitionist of the same name, scored 11 touchdowns. During his three-year career he scored a record 66 touchdowns. The modern record for most touchdowns is held by Mike Mcleod, who reached the end zone 55 times from 2005 to 2008 (54 were rushing TDs). Nov. 20: Yale and harvard renewed their annual joust at Jarvis Field in Cambridge with Yale prevailing, 29–4, over a harvard team that registered 765 points that season. Yale entered the game undefeated, untied and unscored upon. Beecher, the athletic Yale QB, scored on the ﬁfth play of the bone crushing game. harvard’s A.F. holden scored the only TD against Yale that season. Nov. 25: Yale was leading Princeton 4–0 when the game was stopped 12\n\nThe highlighTS 1887–1888\n\nby darkness, resulting in a scoreless tie. Yale suffered a similar fate in the 1884 Princeton game.\n\n1887 (9–0) Captain: henry W. Beecher game length was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Two paid oﬃcials, a referee and an umpire were mandated for each game. Yale’s hegemony over its opponents continued. The Bulldogs were undefeated and unscored upon the ﬁrst six games of the season. Nov. 5: Billy Bull, Yale’s left-footed kicker, booted 12 conversions without a miss in Yale’s lopsided 74–0 romp over Rutgers. Nov. 19: Yale beat Princeton in New York, 12–0. Nov. 2: Yale defeated harvard, 17–8, on Thanksgiving Day at the Polo grounds in New York in front of an estimated 15,000. Pa Corbin scored with a recovered kick and Billy Bull, who booted a 25-yard Fg, followed with a successful kick. Billy Wurtenberg’ s 35-yard TD run followed by a Bull kick completed the scoring.\n\n1888 (1–0) Coach: Walter Camp; Captain: William h. Corbin Walter Camp became Yale’s ﬁrst head football coach. in Camp’s ﬁrst season, Yale went 13–0, outscoring their opponents, 698–0. Camp coached the team from 1888 to 1892, compiling an unmatched record of 67–2–0. Three of his ﬁve teams did not give up a point the entire season. Camp also coached at stanford in December 1892 and from 1894 to ’95, compiling a record of 12–3–3. Tackling was now allowed below the waist. This led to mass formations with linemen and backs grouped closely together to power their way at the point of attack. The violent wedge formation resulting is serious injuries evolved from the rule. Yale won the harvard game by a forfeit because harvard refused to play the game in New York, which had been mutually agreed on by both schools. it was probably unfortunate for the Cantabs that the game was never played because harvard ﬁnished 12–1 that year. however, Yale does not include the forfeit as one of the all-time wins in their record book. Sept. 29: Camp coached his ﬁrst game and led the elis to a 76–0 win against weak sister Wesleyan. Yale’s 24-year-old captain, William “Pa” Corbin, who sported a handlebar mustache, unoﬃcially named Mrs. Walter Camp co-coach of the team. “sir Walter” was chairman of the Board 1\n\n1889 The highlighTS\n\nof Directors of the New haven Clock Company and his time was occupied by business. Because his boss would not allow him to leave to attend practices, Camp’s wife, Alice, volunteered to go to the ﬁeld every afternoon, bringing her husband’s instructions. Mrs. Camp, who paced the sidelines during practices, jotted down notes for her husband and became an expert in her analysis. she even monitored the diets of the players. Oct. 16: Unheard of by today’s standards, Yale played the ﬁrst of three road games over a period of ﬁve days facing Wesleyan, Amherst and Williams. The Amherst and Williams games were played on back-to-back days (October 19 and 20). Yale outscored those opponents, 115–0. Nov. 17: Yale beat its ever-obliging sparring partner, Wesleyan, 105– 0. it was the fourth time that the elis scored over 100 points in a game. Three of the four times the opponent was Wesleyan. Nov. 2: Yale upended Princeton, 10–0, in a game played at the Polo grounds in New York. Billy Bull kicked two ﬁeld goals, each worth ﬁve points. The 698 points scored during the season did not include the six points gained by Yale in the harvard forfeit.\n\n1889 (15–1) Coach: Walter Camp; Captain: Charles O. gill Yale twice played a 16-game schedule. The ﬁrst time was this season. The elis were led by Captain Charley gill, who played ﬁve varsity seasons and never missed a game or called for a substitute. his iron man streak is unmatched in eli annals. Oﬃcials were given whistles and stop watches to use on the ﬁeld. The center rolled the ball back, and it had to be touched by two of the players before it was in play. handsome Dan, the Yale bulldog mascot, arrived. The dog was owned by Yale student Andrew B. graves. The dog followed his master to classes and to games and tradition says it barked whenever Yale scored. handsome Dan was befriended by the players and students and is believed to have been the ﬁrst live college mascot. it was at this time that Yale became known as the Bulldogs. graves returned to his native england but Dan stayed on the Yale campus with graves’s brother, who, prior to baseball and football games, would lead the Yale mascot across the ﬁeld, drawing applause from the crowd. A ﬁne specimen, the popular Yale bulldog won many awards at dog shows including a ﬁrst prize at the Westminster Kennel Club show. 1\n\nThe highlighTS 1890\n\nin 1897, handsome Dan i was reunited with his master in england and died the following year. graves had him stuffed by a taxidermist and returned him to Yale where he remains in a sealed glass case on display in the lobby of the Payne Whitney gymnasium. Nov. 2: Yale beat harvard at hampden Park in springﬁeld, 6–0. Thomas lee “Bum” McClung scored on a 1-yard run when he reportedly was pushed and pulled over the goal line by the whole Yale team. McClung then kicked the goal. Nov. 28: Yale entered the game 15–0 before losing to Princeton, 10–0, at the Polo grounds, ending their 48-game (47–0–1) unbeaten streak. This was the ﬁrst game Camp lost as Yale’s head coach. At the conclusion of the season, Walter Camp picked an All-America team for the ﬁrst time. it is speculated that it was a collaborative effort between Camp and Caspar Whitney, the manager of The Week’s Sport. Camp picked or collaborated on an All-America team every year through 1924.\n\n1890 (1–1) Coach: Walter Camp; Captain: William C. Rhodes The Yale football machine rolled on in the 1890s going 116–7–5. Of Yale’s seven losses, four came at the hands of Princeton. Yale reportedly introduced cheerleaders for the ﬁrst time. While records from this era are unoﬃcial, it is believed that hall of Fame back lee “Bum” McClung scored 510 points from 1888 to 1891. he scored 63 touchdowns when a touchdown’s value was four points. “Bum” also kicked 129 goals after a touchdown (two points each). in 1909 McClung was appointed the 22nd Treasurer of the United states by President howard Taft, a Yale alum. Nov. 22: harvard’s undefeated, untied team ruined Yale’s perfect season by defeating the Bulldogs, 12–6, in springﬁeld, Massachusetts, before an estimated 15,000. Jimmy lee (40-yard sweep) and D.s. Dean (70-yard run with a recovered fumble) were the TD heroes for the Cantabs. McClung scored Yale’s only TD on a 6-yard run. This was the only other loss Camp suffered as head coach. some consider the victory the greatest in the history of harvard Crimson football and Arthur Cumnock, team captain, harvard’s greatest football player. Nov. 27: Yale beat Princeton, 32–0, at eastern Park in Brooklyn, New York, to ﬁnish the season 13–1. McClung scored four touchdowns in the rout. Yale’s share of the gate was $11,185. This brought the football revenue 15\n\n1891 The highlighTS\n\nfor the year to $18,392 (value about $474,000 today), enough to pay for the entire athletic program. Before the start of the game, tragedy struck when 2,000 spectators were thrown to the ground because a movable grandstand that stood 20 feet high and 150 feet long collapsed. An estimated 50 fans were injured, two reportedly were likely to die. The game was immortalized in art by former Yale player Frederic Remington whose classic work, Foot-Ball—A Collision at the Ropes, appeared in Harper’s Weekly.\n\n1891 (1–0) Coach: Walter Camp; Captain: Thomas l. McClung The 1891 team went 13–0 and was unscored upon. Frank hinkey, an exciting 5-foot 9, 20-year-old freshman end, surfaced that year. hinkey, who captained the 1893 and 1894 squads, saw his Yale teams suffer defeat only once in his career, a 6–0 setback to Princeton in 1893. he played the game with reckless abandon, hurling his body at opponents with disregard for its consequences. Pop Warner called him “the greatest player of all-time.” hinkey reportedly stayed up late, smoked cigars despite having a lung condition and drank the worst brands of whiskey. Walter Camp referred to him as the “disembodied spirit.” Yale’s head football coach in 1914 and 1915, he was elected to the College Football hall of Fame in 1951. Nov. 21: Yale beat harvard, 10–0, at hampden Park in springﬁeld, Massachusetts, before an estimated 25,000 fans. stan Morrison (1-yard run) scored in the ﬁrst half for four points but the kick failed. in the second half laurie Bliss ran to paydirt on a 25-yard run with a recovered fumble for four points and McClung made the kick for two more points. Players on both teams played the entire game as substituting was rare at the time. An oﬃcial Yale-harvard scorecard was issued as well as a game day program. The trend for cigarette advertising in college football programs began with this program with the advertising of such cigarette brands as egyptian Deities and Pall Mall. For many years Chesterﬁeld sponsored color centerfolds in college football programs. Nov. 26: Yale ended its perfect season with a 19–0 win over Princeton in a game that was played at Manhattan Field in New York in front of 40,000. Manhattan Field, the ﬁrst sports stadium with all-iron grandstands, was the second Polo grounds, home of the New York giants National league baseball team. it was located just south of the Polo grounds iii that was built in 1890 and renovated after a ﬁre in 1911. Then it became known as 16\n\nThe highlighTS 1892–189\n\nPolo grounds iV, the one generally indicated when the Polo grounds is referenced. Manhattan Field was known as Columbia Field in 1899 and 1900.\n\n1892 (1–0) Coach: Walter Camp; Captain: Vance McCormick Research indicates that Yale Field ii was ﬁrst used for football. it is the current site of the Dewitt Cuyler Athletic Complex that includes Clint Frank Field and is a practice ﬁeld for the Yale football team. The ﬁeld ran perpendicular to Yale Field i and route 34 (New haven Avenue). This was also Walter Camp’s ﬁnal season as Yale’s head coach. The undefeated Bulldogs were not scored upon for the second straight season. (From here on, the author will refer to Yale Field ii as Yale Field.) Nov. 19: Frank hinkey, a ferocious tackler, is said to have neutralized harvard’s ﬂying wedge ﬁrst used in Yale’s 6–0 win in springﬁeld. The invention of harvard assistant coach lorin Deland, the Crimson ﬁrst used the brutal mass formation in the second half. A total of 10 players would lock themselves together in a V formation to protect the ball carrier using their hands and arms and rush forward. Pop Bliss scored Yale’s TD on a 1-yard blast and fullback Frank Butterworth, a two-time All-American, made the kick. Nov. 2: Walter Camp coached his ﬁnal game at Yale, a 12–0 win over Princeton at the Polo grounds.\n\n189 (10–1) Coach: William C. Rhodes; Captain: Frank A. hinkey Bill Rhodes, the captain of the 1890 Yale team took over the head coaching duties. As the story goes, his motivation to become the Yale head football coach resulted from oﬃciating the 1891 Yale-Amherst game, a contest he believed Yale played substandard football. he reportedly took over the team the remainder of that season but is not credited for any Yale wins. Nov. 11: Yale beat Penn in New haven, 14–6. it was the ﬁrst time a team had scored against Yale in 35 consecutive games dating back to the 1890 harvard game. Nov. 25: Yale won their 37th straight game, beating harvard, 6–0, at springﬁeld in front of a crowd of 25,000. Yale’s six points came on a touchdown by Frank Butterworth, followed by a “Wild Bill” hickok kick. Betting appeared heavy, ranging from $10 to $1,000 at places like the Massasoit house, Cooley’s hotel, shean’s exchange and other places. harvard appeared on the ﬁeld in knickerbockers and vests made of leather. 17\n\n189 The highlighTS\n\nThe failed idea was that the leather breeches would hinder Yale’s tackling. But the elis blanked the Crimson for the third straight year. handsome Dan, the Yale mascot, was on the ﬁeld. One of the harvards made a big dog out of red cloth, stuffed with rags. he was displayed with the placard, “Where’s Dan?” After the game, handsome Dan tore the dummy to pieces. Nov. 0: Undefeated Princeton was poison to Yale. led by three-time All-American Phil King, the Tigers spoiled Yale’s perfect undefeated, untied season and Yale’s 37-game winning streak with a 6–0 win at the Polo grounds before 50,000.\n\n189 (16–0) Coach: William C. Rhodes; Captain: Frank A. hinkey For the second and last time, Yale played a 16-game schedule. Two-time All-American guard and hall of Famer William Orville hickok, known as “Wild Bill,” and All-Americans Frank hinkey (end), george Adee (QB), Frank Butterworth (FB), and Philip stillman led the team to an undefeated 16–0 season, the most wins in a season by any team in college football history. Under coach Bill Rhodes, the elis outscored their opponents, 485– 13. Yale’s record 16-win season was noted during the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship game played between Clemson and Alabama, the ﬁnalists in the Division i Football Bowl subdivision for the 2018 season. in this era, it was not uncommon for teams to play lengthy schedules. The University of Chicago under coach Amos Alonzo stagg played 22 games (14–7–1) in 1894. Nov. 2: in what has become known as the “springﬁeld Massacre” and the “Bloodbath in hampden Park,” Yale beat harvard, 12–4, led by hinkey and hickok. The Yale scores came in the ﬁrst half when Phil stillman ran across the goal line on a blocked punt followed by a hickok kick. sam “Brinck” Thorne scored on a 5-yard run supported by a hickok kick. The game that was played in springﬁeld, Massachusetts, was so violent, the series was suspended for two years. hinkey had allegedly broken the collarbone of a harvard player following a fair catch. Yale tackle Fred Murphy broke the nose of harvard’s Bob hallowell during an oﬃcials’ conference; in turn, Murphy absorbed a hard hit later in the contest that hospitalized him. False rumors circulated postgame that he died in a local hospital. Violence ensued among fans in the streets of springﬁeld. 18\n\nThe highlighTS 1895–1896\n\nMany years later Red smith wrote in the New York Post, “No father or mother worthy of the name would permit a son to associate with the set of Yale brutes on hinkey’s football team.” Dec. 1: Yale completed a 16–0 season by defeating Princeton in New York, 24–0.\n\n1895 (1–0–2) Coach: John hartwell; Captain: Sam Thorne Nov. 2: Yale ﬁnished its undefeated season with a 20–10 win over Princeton. hall of Famer and All-American halfback samuel Brinckerhoff Thorne proved to be a one-man wrecking crew as he scored two touchdowns, set up a touchdown with a 45-yard punt return, kicked two conversions and blocked a punt.\n\n1896 (1–1) Coach: Sam Thorne; Captain: Fred T. Murphy Frank Merriwell, Yale’s ﬁctional hero, who excelled in multiple sports, made his debut in Street and Smith’s Tip-Top Weekly. Brought to life by gilbert Patten, who wrote under the pseudonym, Burt l. standish, the Merriwell stories sold at a rate of 200,000 copies per week. The character appeared in more than 200 dime novels between 1896 and 1930. subsequently, there were numerous radio dramas and a book that centered on the alpha male. Oct. 2: Yale beat the Carlisle indians, 12–6, in east Orange, New Jersey, in a game that was marred by a quick whistle from former Yale AllAmerican “Wild Bill” hickok, one of the oﬃcials on the game. The incident occurred in the second half, robbing a touchdown run by Carlisle’s isaac seneca, Jr. seneca, the ﬁrst American indian to be selected as an AllAmerican in 1899, busted through the center of the line. he squirmed and shook off the Yale tacklers, dodged a man or two, and, made an apparent spectacular TD run down the ﬁeld. But hickok prematurely blew the whistle, calling the play dead before seneca broke loose. When seneca broke away, hickok realized that he had made a mistake and wanted to change his decision and allow the touchdown. Fred Murphy, the Yale captain, objected, claiming that the whistle had been blown and the ball was down. The indians, of course, objected, and a wordy war followed. hickok told Murphy that if the touchdown was not allowed the indians would leave the ﬁeld. Murphy was obstinate and would not give in. With the inﬂuence of Josh hartwell, the umpire, hickok concluded that 19\n\n1897–1898 The highlighTS\n\nhe ought not to change his ruling and ordered the ball down on the 35 yard line. he then he had a long talk with the indians, and ﬁnally persuaded them to continue the game, which they did. Nov. 21: The men from Old Nassau did it again. This time Princeton stopped a 44-game (42–0–2) unbeaten Yale streak and a perfect season with a 24–6 victory at the Polo grounds.\n\n1897 (9–0–2) Coach: Frank Butterworth; Captain: James O. Rodg ers grandstands were put up at Yale Field, increasing the seating capacity to 15,000 fans. Oct. 2: Yale beat the Carlisle indians at the Polo grounds in New York, 24–9. The New York Times wrote, “There were 22-men in perfect condition … meeting in equal numbers, man against man, on equal terms.” Nov. 1: After a two-year armistice, thanks to the efforts of Walter Camp and W.A. Brooks (harvard), Yale and harvard resumed their rivalry and played a scoreless tie at soldiers Field in Boston. The stalemate that was played in two 35-minute halves was witnessed by approximately 24,000. Yale used the same 11 players the entire game. soldiers Field, which subsequently became harvard stadium, was donated by philanthropist henry lee higginson, an oﬃcer in the Union Army during the Civil War. higginson, who was also the founder of the Boston symphony orchestra, donated the 33 acres of land as a memorial to his friends who died in the Civil War. Nov. 20: Yale beat Princeton in New haven, 6–0. The highlight play of the game was executed by Yale QB Charles de saulles’s zig-zag 55-yard run.\n\n1898 (9–2) Coach: Frank Butterworth; Captain: Burr Chamberlain Yale won its ﬁrst nine games by a combined 146–11 score then was shut out by rivals Princeton and harvard the ﬁnal two games. Touchdowns and ﬁeld goals both counted ﬁve points and a goal after touchdown was valued at one point. A safety was two points. Nov. 12: in front of ex–President grover Cleveland and his wife, Frances, Princeton continued to haunt Yale, again ruining an undefeated season with a 6–0 win at Brokaw Field in New Jersey. The Tigers’ consensus All-American end Arthur Poe’s electrifying 95-yard game-winning 20\n\nThe highlighTS 1899\n\ntouchdown was the highlight of the game. Poe picked up the ball on the Princeton 5 yard line after Yale back Alfred Durston failed to catch the snap from center. he fumbled and thought the ball was “down,” according to The New York Times, who also reported that Poe’s race to the goal line was “one of the most sensational ever witnessed on a football ﬁeld.” The Times added, “Pandemonium broke loose on the Princeton side. Flags were waved, women took off their bouquets of chrysanthemums and waved them in the air.” Benjamin Ayres kicked the extra point. it should be noted that Poe was the second cousin twice removed of the American author edgar Allan Poe. A 100-page game day program was produced with player photos, ornate Victorian ads and much more. The cover of the program pictured three-time Yale All-American Burr Chamberlain and Arthur hillebrand, a Princeton player who was later inducted into the College Football hall of Fame. Nov. 19: harvard beat Yale, 17–0, at Yale Field in heavy rain before 17,500. Crimson sophomore fullback Bill Reid, known as “William the Conqueror,” charged into the end zone twice on runs of 5 and 12 yards. he became the ﬁrst harvard player ever to score two touchdowns against Yale in one game. Because of a leg injury, Reid did not play his senior year. instead, he became the team’s head cheerleader.\n\n1899 (7–2–1) Coach: J.O. Rodgers; Captain: Malcolm l. McBride Oct. 21: Yale remained undefeated, untied, and unscored upon after the ﬁrst ﬁve games, blanking the Wisconsin Badgers in New haven, 6–0. The two teams would not play again until 1947. Nov. 18: Yale and harvard played to a scoreless tie at harvard. The game was witnessed by 36,000 spectators, including governor (and future U.s. President) Theodore Roosevelt of New York and governor Roger Wolcott of Massachusetts, both harvard graduates. Yale stopped harvard on the goal line when harvard fullback s.g. ellis ran straight into the arms of Malcolm McBride, who was braced against the goal post which was on the goal line at the time. Nov. 25: Despite Albert sharpe’s 50-yard drop-kick ﬁeld goal, Yale lost to Princeton, 11–10, in New haven to close out the 19th century in which the storied Yale football program produced an astonishing record of 223–13–13. 21\n\n1900–1901 The highlighTS\n\n1900 (12–0) Coach: Malcolm l. McBride; Captain: F. gordon Brown Jr. The era of four-time All-American and hall of Fame guard Francis gordon Brown ended with the Bulldogs going 37–5–3. The national champion 1900 team, called the “Team of the Century,” included seven ﬁrst-team All-Americans. Yale outscored their opponents, 336–10 with the 10 points divided between Columbia and Princeton. Nov. 17: Yale waltzed by Princeton, 29–5, at University Field in New Jersey. Nov. 2: Yale and harvard both entered the contest undefeated. The Bulldogs won the game, 28–0, in New haven to ﬁnish a perfect season. harvard would win their next 23 games. The big play of the game came in the second half when sherman Coy recovered a fumbled pass in the Crimson backﬁeld and ran 75 yards. Yale played the entire game using 12 players. All Yale starters except for All-American center herman Olcott played the full game. “Boola-Boola” was sung for the ﬁrst time. it appears that three Yale students, Allan M. hirsch, F.M. Van Wincklen and A.h. Marckwald, wrote the words to ﬁt the tune of “la hoola Boola”—a song African American entertainers Bob Cole and Billy Johnson performed in New haven in the 1890s.\n\n1901 (11–1–1) Coach: george S. Stillman; Captain: Charles gould Two-time All-American tackle (1899–1900) george schley stillman was handed the coaching baton for the 1901 season. stillman subsequently entered the banking business and died at age 27 after contracting typhoid fever. Jan. 1: Century Milstead, an All-American tackle at Yale in 1923 who also played in the NFl with the New York giants, is born on this date. he got his unusual name for being born on the ﬁrst day of the twentieth century. Of course, the debate as to the ﬁrst year of a century rages on. Nov. 16: The Bulldogs tripped Princeton, 12–0, before 19,000 at Yale Field. Nov. 2: Yale entered the harvard game 11–0–1 but the Crimson spoiled the elis’ undefeated season winning, 22–0. it was the worst shellacking a Yale team had ever received. All three Crimson TDs were scored on 1-yard runs by Crawford Blagden, Albert Ristine and Thomas graydon. 22\n\nThe highlighTS 1902–190\n\nMidway through the season, harvard oﬃcials raised the issue that Yale All-American guard edgar “Ned” glass had played at syracuse prior to coming to Yale and because Yale transfers were required to sit out one year, he should be ineligible. Yale sat him for the Princeton and harvard games, beating the Tigers but losing to the Crimson. The Yale and harvard glee clubs had a joint concert as part of the Yale-harvard weekend, a tradition that has endured.\n\n1902 (11–0–1) Coach: Joseph R. Swan; Captain: george B. Chadwick Nov. 1: Yale battled Army to a 6–6 tie before a then-record crowd of 8,000 at West Point. Time ran out on a Yale drive that had gone from the Blue’s 10 yard line to the Army 20. Nov. 22: Ned glass returned and helped Yale break harvard’s 23game winning streak with a 23–0 victory at Yale Field. it was harvard’s ﬁrst loss since Yale beat the Cantabs, 28–0, in 1900. in this game a Yale player faked an injury so a teammate could get a letter. in an article by 1902 Yale captain george Brewster Chadwick for the November 15, 1958, Yale-Princeton game day program, Chadwick wrote, in my time, men could not get a “Y” unless they played in the Princeton game or the harvard game…. A few days before the harvard game, george goss one of our guards, came up to me and said, ‘if all is going well toward the end of the game, i’ll pretend i’m hurt, so that Chan hamlin can take my place. No one needs to know about it except you and me. Toward the end of the game all indeed was going well; we led harvard 23–0. After a certain play, i saw goss lying on his back. i ran over to him, and knelt beside him, fearful that he had been really hurt. But he winked at me and then i remembered. Thus, hamlin got into the game not knowing the why of it. i kept that incident a secret until a 25th anniversary dinner of the team. hamlin appreciated the gesture.\n\n190 (11–1) Coach: g.B. Chadwick; Captain: C.D. Rafferty stands were increased at Yale Field to hold 29,000. A rule change allowed a running back to run with the ball between the 25 yard lines as long as he was ﬁve yards on either side of the center when he crossed the line of scrimmage. The next season the rule was extended for the entire ﬁeld. The ﬁeld was thus marked with longitudinal lines. Nov. 1: The Yale-Princeton game in New haven, won by Princeton, 2\n\n190 The highlighTS\n\n11–6, was ﬁlmed by Thomas edison Films using a Kinetograph motion picture camera. The big play in the game occurred when Yale’s ledyard Mitchell was attempting to drop kick a 41-yard Fg when he was hit by two Tigers. After he was hit, Princeton’s Ridge hart gave the ball impetus toward the Yale goal. Tigers All-American John DeWitt picked up the ball, which was technically a fumble, and ran for a 26-yard touchdown. DeWitt also kicked a 53-yard ﬁeld goal following a fair catch. The length of the Fg remains open to question. There is no evidence that edison attended the game. The ﬁeld was marked in a checkered gridiron. harvard stadium opened on the same day, but Dartmouth spoiled the party defeating the Crimson, 11–0. its U-shaped architecture resembles Panathenaic stadium in Athens, greece. Nov. 21: Yale won the inaugural Y-h appearance in the new stadium, winning 16–0. The game was played in two halves, a practice that continued until 1909. The elis scored in the ﬁrst half on a 3-yard run by Ralph Kinney that was set up by a long harold Metcalf run. in the second half, two blocked kicks were downed by Jim hogan behind the Crimson goal line. harvard stadium was the nation’s ﬁrst sports venue to use the term Stadium. The next oldest was the original Yankee stadium that opened in 1923.\n\n190 (10–1) Coach: C.D. Rafferty; Captain: James J. hogan The team was noted for Yale’s “irish line” that was led by three-time All American tackle James hogan. A native of glenbane, Tipperary, hogan was elected to the College hall of Fame in 1954. he was joined on the line by tackle Ralph Kinney, guard Ned glass, center henry holt, guard george goss, and end Tom shevlin. This was the last year that Yale played more than 10 games in a season. Two-time All-American quarterback Foster Rockwell helped the Bulldogs go 32–2–1 between 1902 and 1904. Oct. 22: Army edged Yale, 11–6, at West Point to give Yale their only loss of the season. Army and syracuse were the only teams to score against the elis during the season. Nov. 12: Yale beat Princeton at Princeton University Field, 12–0. “Down the Field” was sung for the ﬁrst time. The song was composed by stanleigh Friedman (’05) and written by C.W. O’Connor. Nov. 19: Yale shut out harvard for the third straight year, this time, 2\n\nThe highlighTS 1905–1906\n\n12–0. sammy Morse (from 2 yards) and Rex Flinn (1 yard) crossed the goal line for the Bulldogs. Flinn’s score came on a blocked harvard kick by Roswell Tripp that was carried over the goal line by Flinn. One of harvard’s reserves was William Clarence Matthews, the ﬁrst black to play in the Y-h series.\n\n1905 (10–0) Coach: J.e. Owsley; Captain: Thomas l. Shevlin Nov. 25: harvard lost to undefeated Yale, 6–0, before an estimated 43,000 in Boston, ﬁnishing 8–2–1. Yale scored in the second 30-minute half after Bob Forbes recovered a fumble on the harvard 30 yard line before crossing the goal line on a 4-yard run several plays later. The game had a violent tone to it. Yale’s Tom shevlin, the alpha male All-American end, ignored harvard’s Francis Burr’s fair catch signal and tackled him low. The elis’ Jim Quill then broke Burr’s nose. Quill claimed it was retaliation because Burr had bitten him earlier in the game. When referee Paul Dashiell failed to penalize shevlin, the harvard crowd became boisterous. Before the Burr incident, Yale’s sammy Morse was banished for punching Jack Wendell, who he claimed had been repeatedly holding him without being penalized by Dashiell. harvard coach Bill Reid saw to it that Dashiell would never oﬃciate another harvard game. The violent play prompted the delivery of a note from henry lee higginson, a Civil War veteran, who was wounded at the First Battle of Bull Run. higginson, a benefactor who donated to soldiers Field, sent the note to Reid, requesting the withdrawal of the Crimson team from the playing ﬁeld. Reid ignored the request.\n\n1906 (9–0–1) Coach: Foster Rockwell; Captain: Samuel F.B. Morse in this era of mass formations such as the ﬂying wedge, the casualty football list for 1905 was fearful. There was a total of 18 to 26 gridiron fatalities reported by various sources, including 11 in high schools and three in colleges. There were 149 serious injuries, 47 on the college level. Columbia, Northwestern and Union gave up the game. stanford and Columbia replaced it with rugby. Jan. 27: President Theodore Roosevelt had called upon representatives of college football to make the game safer. The football rules committee comprised of 14 members including three Yale men, Walter Camp, 25\n\n1906 The highlighTS\n\nAmos Alonso stagg (coach at the University of Chicago) and Dr. henry Williams (coach at Minnesota) agreed to legalize the forward pass. A rule was also established requiring teams to gain 10 yards in three downs. There were several restrictions, however, regarding the forward pass. One rule read, “if a pass hit the ground before it was touched by a player of either side, the ball automatically went to the opponent on the spot where the pass was thrown.” Also, passes over 20 yards were illegal. Camp, who reportedly was initially against the forward pass, devised the “statue of liberty” play, according to writer Tim Cohane. Oct. : Yale defeated Wesleyan, 21–0. One source credits the birth of the forward pass to this game when sam Moore of Wesleyan threw a pass to irwin Van Tassel that gained 18 yards for the Methodists. According to writer Dan Parker, “this marked the dawn of the aerial era.” however, most sources credit the birth of the forward pass to saint louis University’s Bradbury Robinson when he tossed a 20-yard pass to Jack schneider on september 5, 1906, 28 days earlier when slU, coached by eddie Cochems, defeated Carroll College, 22–0. Oct. 20: Yale clipped Penn state in New haven, 10–0. From 1899 to 1906 the two schools played seven times with Yale winning every game. The elis outscored the Nittany lions, 148–0, in the series. Nov. : in a game in which Yale failed to record a ﬁrst down and both teams each used only one sub, Yale pulled out an unlikely 10–6 victory over Army at West Point. The Cadets became the ﬁrst (and only) team to score against Yale all season. Trailing, 6–0, at the half, Clarence Alcott recovered a blocked punt for Yale’s touchdown worth ﬁve points. Alcott was reportedly all over the ﬁeld and recovered several fumbles. Paul Veeder made the extra point to tie the score. lucius horatio “Ray” Biglow (often spelled Bigelow) made the deciding ﬁeld goal (worth four points then) in the last two minutes on a free kick after a fair catch by William Knox. The New York Times bannered, “Yale Field goal earns luckiest of Victories.” The NCAA eliminated the free-kick Fg following a fair catch in 1950 but it is still legal under high school and NFl rules. There have been six such documented free-kick ﬁeld goals in NFl history, the last being in 1976 when Ray Wersching of the san Diego Chargers booted a 45-yarder against the Buffalo Bills following a fair catch. Nov. 17: For the seventh time, Yale and Princeton played to a scoreless 26\n\nThe highlighTS 1907–1908\n\ntie. The stalemate nets undefeated seasons for both programs and a co– national championship. Nov. 2: Yale blanked harvard, 6–0, to spoil harvard’s 10–0 season. A fumbled punt set up Yale’s only TD scored by howard Roome on a 3yard run. This was the ﬁrst Y-h game that was impacted by the forward pass when Paul Veeder connected on a 30-yard toss to Clarence Alcott, a substitute end who brought the ball to the harvard 4 yard line to set up Roome’s TD.\n\n1907 (9–0–1) Coach: William Knox; Captain: l.h. Biglow Yale’s only loss from 1907 to 1909 came against harvard in 1908. Ted Coy, an All-America fullback in each of those years, was elected to the College Football hall of Fame. Nov. 16: led by Coy, the indomitable sophomore fullback, Yale edged Princeton, 12–10, in New haven. With the Tigers leading, 10–0, Coy ran roughshod over the Tigers, scoring two touchdowns and kicking both extra points. Nov. 2: Yale beat harvard, 12–0, in a dogged battle at harvard stadium. it was the Bulldogs’ sixth consecutive shutout win over the Crimson. Coy scored Yale’s two touchdowns on runs of 4 yards and 1 yard. hamilton Fish iii, captain of the 1909 harvard team (and acting captain in 1908 when that year’s captain was injured) was a mainstay at tackle from 1907 to 1909.\n\n1908 (7–1–1) Coach: l.h. Biglow; Captain: Robert B. Burch in its ﬁnal addition, stands at Yale Field were constructed to hold 35,000. Oct. 17: Thanks to Coy’s punting and plunging, Yale defeated Army, 6–0, at West Point before 10,000. Coy scored the only TD late in the game. Nov. 1: in one of the most amazing ﬁnishes in Yale football history, the elis trailed Princeton, 6–0, in the ﬁnal minutes on a blustery, snowy day in New Jersey. The Tigers’ diminutive captain eddie Dillon delivered an onside kick. The idea was to let Yale kill the remaining time with an ineffectual offense. But Coy, also known as “Terrible Ted,” shot through the snow and brought the ball down to the Princeton 10. Triggered by the crowd who were chanting, “Coy, Coy, Coy,” the Yale QB trotted over and pulled Coy from his end position into the backﬁeld where he crashed 27\n\n1909 The highlighTS\n\nthrough for a touchdown. Because of the rule at the time that allowed the team that scored to receive the kickoff, Coy received the ball and ran to the Princeton 30. On the next play he tore across the goal line, leading Yale to an unlikely 11–6 win. Nov. 21: Yale’s six-year hex over harvard ended when left-footed drop kicker Vic Kennard booted a 25-yard ﬁeld goal in the ﬁrst half to give harvard a 4–0 lead which proved to be the ﬁnal score. The harvard win also ended Yale’s 42-game (39–0–3) unbeaten streak. Percy haughton, harvard’s ﬁrst year coach, gambled by putting Kennard in the game in the ﬁrst half. The rules at the time stipulated that once a player was removed from the game, he could not re-enter. Kennard remained in the game for a time until he was injured after tackling Coy, Yale’s All-American fullback. Despite fears that his leg was broken, Kennard’s mother, who was in the stands dismissed the injury. “i don’t care,” she said. “he stopped Ted Coy.” According to legend, haughton strangled a bulldog during a ﬁery pregame speech. Contemporary research concludes that at worst haughton “strangled” a papier mâché bulldog and tied another such creation to the back fender of his automobile. When told the score, President Theodore Roosevelt, a harvard alumnus, interrupted a doubles tennis match at the White house with the French ambassador to dance an impromptu jig. At the end of the season it was discovered that ham Andrus, Yale’s All-American guard, had played the game with a broken arm.\n\n1909 (10–0) Coach: howard h. Jones; Captain: edward h. “Ted” Coy Former Yale player howard Jones, who gained fame as the longtime head coach at southern California, coached his alma mater to an undefeated, untied and unscored-upon 10–0 season. Yale outscored its opponents, 209–0. it would be the elis’ ﬁfth such trifecta season. Periods were changed from two halves of 35 minutes to four quarters of 15 minutes. Field goals now counted three points instead of four. Five Yale glee Club undergraduates decided to spend Monday evenings at Mory’s on Temple street in New haven and assumed the name “Whiffenpoof.” The origin of the name is generally traced back to a Broadway actor named Joseph Cawthorn who, during a sequence of dialogue in a musical entitled Little Nemo, claimed to have caught a Whiffenpoof ﬁsh. 28\n\nThe highlighTS 1910\n\nThe typically 14-member senior-only gentlemen rankers group was pictured in formal attire in the October 25, 1969, Yale-Cornell game day program standing on the crossbar of the south end goal post in the Yale Bowl. Oct. 2: Yale beat syracuse, coached by howard Jones’s brother and former Yale player T.A.D. (Thomas Albert Dwight) Jones, 15–0. it marked the ﬁrst time that two brothers coached against each other at the major college level. (They would again coach against each other in 1922 when howard’s national champion iowa hawkeyes beat Yale.) Nov. 20: in a “Battle of the giants,” Yale defeated harvard, 8–0, for the national championship. entering the game, Yale had not allowed a point the entire season while harvard, on an 18-game undefeated streak, had outscored their opponents, 103–9. Coy kicked two ﬁeld goals and Yale scored a safety when Wayland Minot recovered a punt blocked by Carroll Cooney. Coy was the team’s leading scorer despite missing four games because of an appendectomy. Yale coach howard Jones would coach at Ohio state in 1910, leading the Buckeyes to a 6–1–3 record. he then spent the next several years in private business before returning to Yale in 1913. Jones subsequently coached at the University of iowa, Duke University and the University of southern California. At UsC, howard’s teams went 121–36–13 and won ﬁve Rose Bowls. his overall coaching record is 194–64–21 and includes ﬁve national championships, one at Yale and four at UsC. From 1872 until 1909 Yale went 324–17–18.\n\nAll-American fullback Ted Coy led Yale to an undefeated, untied and unscored on 10–0 team in 1909. Notice the players are participating without helmets.\n\n1910 (6–2–2) Coach: edward h. “Ted” Coy; Captain: Fred J. Daley Yale lost its role as lords of the college football oligarchy. in the 10 29\n\n1911 The highlighTS\n\nprevious seasons the elis went 80–4–5. in the next decade the Bulldogs recorded 59 wins against 20 defeats with ﬁve ties—impressive by today’s standards but perhaps, not dynastic. Passes over 20 yards were illegal and the rules stipulated that the offense had to have seven men on the line of scrimmage. Backs were allowed to cross the line of scrimmage at any point. Ted Coy replaced howard Jones as head coach but did not enjoy the success he had as a player. The Yale Corporation appointed and incorporated the Committee of Twenty-One to study ways of improving the athletic facilities. it was this committee that spearheaded the Yale Bowl project. Nov. 5: Brown beat Yale, 21–0, for the ﬁrst time in the history of their series that began in 1880. After this game, henry holt took over the Yale coaching duties for the ﬁnal two games of the season. Nov. 12: Yale beat Princeton, 5–3, in New Jersey. Junior quarterback Art howe’s touchdown pass to John Reed Kilpatrick accounted for the decisive score. The Bulldogs employed the “Minnesota shift,” designed by Dr. henry l. Williams at the University of Minnesota and brought to Yale by former Yale great Tom shevlin, who served as an assistant under Williams and was a coaching advisor at Yale late in the 1910 season. shevlin taught it to the Yale team in one week. Nov. 19: Despite shevlin’s teachings, Yale and harvard played to a scoreless tie in New haven. several ﬁres broke out under the wooden stands at Yale Field.\n\n1911 (7–2–1) Coach: John Field; Captain: Arthur howe Cole Porter, a junior at Yale, wrote Yale’s ﬁght song, “Bulldog.” The song continues to be played when the team enters the playing ﬁeld and after every Yale score. Yale’s two losses came at the hands of Army and Princeton. Nov. 18: Yale and Princeton set a record that may stand forever, punting 64 times (36 by Princeton) as the Tigers defeated the Bulldogs, 6–3, in a downpour at Yale Field. Art howe, Yale’s quarterback and future hall of Famer, returned a collegiate record 17 punts (some accounts say 18) for 130 yards. The Tigers featured hobey Baker, “the blond Adonis of the gridiron.” Because of the ﬁres the previous year during the harvard game, 0\n\nThe highlighTS 1912\n\nsmoking was prohibited. in this era, cigar ashes were the cause of many ﬁres. Nov. 25: For the second straight year, the Yale-harvard game ended in a scoreless tie. The stalemate was highlighted by a kicking duel between Walter Camp Jr., and harvard’s sam Felton. John Field coached his last game for Yale.\n\n1912 (7–1–1) Coach: Arthur howe; Captain: Jesse Spalding The value of a touchdown was stabilized at the current six points, a conversion one point, a ﬁeld goal three points and a safety two points. The ﬁeld was reduced from 110 to 100 yards and downs increased from three to four to make 10 yards. Oct. 19: Yale beat Army, 6–0, at West Point. Yale sophomore guard Theodore York broke two ribs that would lead to his death. Nov. 2: The Yale-Colgate game was cancelled when York died in New haven hospital. he developed blood poisoning and pneumonia set in. This was one of four games cancelled in Yale football history. The October 1, 1949, contest against Fordham was never played because Yale oﬃcials feared a polio epidemic on campus. Dale liechty, an end on herman hickman’s team, was diagnosed with polio along with two other cases on campus. The 1985 Yale–UConn contest scheduled for september 28, was cancelled because of hurricane gloria and the september 15, 2001, YaleTowson game was cancelled because of the events of 9/11. Nov. 16: Yale and Princeton played to a 6–6 tie in New Jersey. With Yale trailing, 6–3, with one minute remaining in the game, Yale’s harold Pumpelly, a substitute player, drop-kicked a 49-yard ﬁeld goal to tie the game. “Pump” always claimed that the ball traveled 52 yards and three inches. Nov. 2: in keeping with tradition, it was common for Yale and harvard to have special songs for The game. One of the classics was a Yale song that appeared in the 1912 program called “The Undertaker song.” The lyrics read: Oh! More work for the undertaker Another little job for the casket maker in the local cemetery they are very, very busy on a brand-new grave. No hope for harvard.\n\n1\n\n191–191 The highlighTS\n\nBut it was the Crimson who buried the elis, 20–0. For the third straight year, Yale failed to score against the sons of John.\n\n191 (5–2–) Coach: howard h. Jones; Captain: henry h. Ketcham howard Jones returned to Yale to coach the Bulldogs for one season. he was paid $2,500, making him the ﬁrst salaried Yale coach. Two-time Pulitzer Prize poet Archibald Macleish was a center on this team. June 2: At 5:00 p.m., Yale University President Arthur Twining hadley led the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Yale Bowl. The name “Bowl” was ﬁrst suggested by Noah h. swayne Jr. (class of 1893), a member of the Committee of Twenty-One, a group appointed by the Yale Corporation in 1910 to study ways of improving Yale’s athletic facilities. Aug. 1: Construction of the Yale Bowl began with a crew of 145 men hired by the sperry engineering Company of New haven. The Bowl was designed by architect Charles Ferry, an 1871 Yale alum. The architectural features of the Bowl were worked out by Donn Barber (Yale 1893). Yale grad everard Thompson directed the construction details. The construction process was called “cut and ﬁll.” The plan was to dig a giant hole or crater, then use the 320,000 cubic yards of soil to build the surrounding walls or berm. From ground level an excavation was made about 27½ feet to the ﬂoor (playing ﬁeld) which was the “cut” process. The earth that was dug-up was used for building the surrounding berm to a height of 26 feet. This was the “ﬁll.” Therefore, the top of the Bowl to the bottom measures 53½ feet. When a spectator walks into the Bowl, they are 27½ feet from the playing ﬁeld and 26 feet from the top. The Rose Bowl that opened in 1922 was patterned after the Yale Bowl. Nov. 22: harvard’s Charley Brickley, known as the “da Vinci of the drop kick,” kicked ﬁve ﬁeld goals for all of harvard’s points in the Crimson’s 15–5 win in Boston to cap off an undefeated season.\n\n191 (7–2) Coach: Frank A. hinkey; Captain: Nelson S. Talbott The opening of the Yale Bowl on November 21 ushered in a new era. Oct. 17: Notre Dame, with their great fullback Ray eichenlaub, carried a 27-game winning streak and were favorites to defeat Yale in New haven following a 103–0 win over Rose Polytechnic the week before. But the undaunted elis staged an upset by defeating the irish, 28–0. That game 2\n\nThe highlighTS 191\n\nwas targeted to open the Yale Bowl but it was not yet completed so it was played at Yale Field. Knute Rockne was an assistant coach for the “irish” under head coach Jesse harper. he later would call the defeat “the most valuable lesson Notre Dame ever had in football. it taught us never to be cocksure.” Rockne later wrote in his autobiography, “i sat on the sideline at New haven that saturday and saw a good Yale team captained by Bud Talbott with a crack halfback named harry legore leading the attack. They made Notre Dame look like a high school squad.” it is believed that this game launched Notre Dame into the era of modern football. Nov. 1: in a numerological oddity, the 1914 Yale-Princeton game is won by the elis, 19–14 at the new Palmer stadium. For a time, Palmer stadium was the largest college stadium in the country behind the Yale Bowl. Nov. 17: The Bowl was reported as completed. Oddly, however, there were no rest rooms in the Bowl, an apparent oversight. in 1916, Ferry wrote a report to the American society of Civil engineers that stated, “The cost of permanent toilets was not included in the original estimate of the Bowl.” Portable toilets were used until the current eight exterior rest rooms that surround the Bowl were added in 1931. Nov. 21: The Yale Bowl, the largest stadium yet built in America, opened with an estimated crowd of 70,000 as harvard beat Yale, 36–0. it was the worst defeat in the history of Yale’s 42-year-old football program. A writer quipped, “Yale had the Bowl but harvard had the punch.” in attendance was eight-year-old Al Ostermann, a New haven resident, who would attend 499 of the ﬁrst 500 games played in the Bowl. The only game he missed was on November 8, 1930, when Yale beat an inferior Alfred team, 66–0, the same day Army had a date with illinois at Yankee stadium. Ostermann chose to attend the big intersectional contest in the Bronx. harvard’s Tack hardwick scored the ﬁrst touchdown ever in the Bowl on a 5-yard pass from Packy Mahan. The highlight play of the game occurred in the second quarter when harvard’s Thomas Jefferson “Jeff ” Coolidge picked up a Carroll Knowles fumble on the harvard 5 yard line and raced 95 yards for a touchdown. When the game ended, the harvard crowd lit ﬁrecrackers on the goal posts and did a snake dance around the ﬁeld. During the game the Yale undergraduate Red Cross relief committee \n\n1915 The highlighTS\n\ncollected $7,463.91, the equivalent of $187,000 today. Following the game that ended at 4:17 p.m., seven harvard students were ﬁned $5.29 apiece for disturbing the peace in the streets of New haven. The harvard team dined at the hotel Taft in New haven before most departed for New York City where they were the guests of the harvard Club for the evening. ironically, football was not the ﬁrst athletic event ever staged in the Bowl. On the day the Bowl opened, a cross-country meet, won by Cornell, started and ended in the Bowl long before the start of the game.\n\n1915 (–5) Coach: Frank A. This ticket is for the ﬁrst game ever played in the Yale Bowl (courtesy John hayden).\n\nhinkey; Captain: Alex D. Wilson\n\nYale suffered the ﬁrst losing season in the 44-year history of the their football program. The new Bowl was open weekdays for public inspection. Sept. 25: Yale opened the season with a 37–0 victory over Maine in a game played before only 7,000 fans in the Bowl. it was still the largest number ever present at a Yale opening match. Yale scored 21 points in the ﬁrst quarter, all within a minute, helped by the former rule that the team scoring would get the ball back by receiving the ensuing kickoff. Beverly V. Thompson, the QB in the single wing, scored the ﬁrst Yale touchdown ever in the Bowl on a 10-yard run in the opening quarter and added another. Because of excessive heat, the game began at 4:00 p.m., one hour after the scheduled start. A popular feature of the contest was the public address announcer who was positioned on the ﬁeld with a megaphone. he announced the names of players who scored touchdowns. At the time, players were not numbered. Nov. 6: Brown’s Fritz Pollard became the ﬁrst African American to play in the Yale Bowl. Pollard led the Bears with long runs and exciting punt returns in defeating the Bulldogs, 3–0. Pollard was received with racial animosity from the Yale side. For security reasons, he was instructed to enter the ﬁeld through a separate gate. \n\nThe highlighTS 1916\n\nNov. 1: Otis guernsey drop-kicked a 54-yard ﬁeld goal to help the elis beat heavily favored Princeton, 13–7, in front of 50,000 at the Bowl. The New York Times reported, “Princeton came here today to take part in the obsequies of Yale’s misfortune, but the ﬂowers and condolences were wasted, for there was no Yale funeral.” The 54-yard ﬁeld goal is still an ivy league record for Yale, duplicated by Tom Mante in 2009. Nov. 20: harvard’s captain, eddie Mahan, crossed the goal line four times as the Crimson whitewashed the elis for the second straight year, this time, 41–0. Mahan, a three-time ﬁrst team All-American, also kicked ﬁve conversions accounting for 29 of harvard’s 41 points.\n\n1916 (8–1) Coach: T.A.D. Jones; Captain: C.R. Black Jr. Yale players wore numbered jerseys for the ﬁrst time in the Princeton and harvard games. Oct. 1: Former United states President and Yale alum William howard Taft attended Yale’s football practice. Taft’s son, Charley, a junior center, was scheduled to start his ﬁrst varsity game at Yale the following day against lehigh. Charley captained the Yale basketball team the previous year. Oct. 1: Because the Yale Bowl was being used as a rehearsal for an elaborate pageant involving a cast of 8,000 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Yale’s move from saybrook, Connecticut, to New haven in 1716, Yale played a home game outside the Bowl at Yale Field across the street and beat lehigh, 12–0. Oct. 20: Yale beat Virginia Polytechnic institute, 19–0, in the only Friday game ever played by the Yale varsity in the Bowl. The Friday game was scheduled because of the 200th anniversary pageant the following day in the Bowl. Nov. 18: The sons of two former United states presidents were in opposing uniforms—Charley Taft (Yale), son of William howard Taft and Richard Cleveland (Princeton), son of grover Cleveland. A green and crippled Yale team emerged victorious in the elis’ 10–0 win over the Tigers at Palmer stadium in front of 42,000, the largest crowd ever to see a game at Princeton. The scoring came from halfback harry legore’s touchdown and Jim Braden’s 25-yard ﬁeld goal. Prior to the game, former Princeton great hobey Baker, in a Curtiss 5\n\n1917 The highlighTS\n\n“Jenny” ﬂown by Cord Meyer (a Yalie), joined a squadron of New York National guard Jennies led by Captain Raynal Bolling, the most to have ever ﬂown in military formation, and ﬂew to Palmer stadium. The planes performed several maneuvers to the delight of the crowd, and Baker landed on the ﬁeld, becoming the ﬁrst person to reach a football game by air. Nov. 25: Yale bounced back from the previous year’s humiliating 41–0 defeat to edge harvard, 6–3, in the second matchup ever of the ancient rivals in the Bowl. Following the game, a large number of Yalies went by train to grand Central station in New York City where the contingent made its way to the Yale Club on Vanderbilt Avenue. it was the ﬁrst Yale victory celebration over harvard commemorated at the 22-story clubhouse. The euphoric Blues, numbering 1,200, partied into the morning. “A brass band of six sturdy performers was worn to a frazzle before midnight because it tried to play Boola Boola every time a grad called for it,” wrote Fred lieb in the New York Sun. At 9:00 p.m. the band led a procession of 600 club members through Vanderbilt Avenue to West 44th street. When they reached the harvard club, they serenaded the crestfallen men of John harvard.\n\n1917 (–0) Coach: T.A.D. Jones; Captain: Artemus l. gates Because so many athletes were in the military in World War i, Yale played a three-game schedule with an informal assemblage of ROTC students. They defeated loomis institute, New haven Naval Base and Trinity. America mobilized its National guard forces after the United states declared war against germany on April 6. The 1st Connecticut from the hartford area and the 2nd Connecticut from the New haven area were sent to Camp Yale in the vicinity of the Yale Bowl for encampment and training. The 1st and 2nd combined to become the 102nd infantry and was made part of the 26th “Yankee” Division of Massachusetts. The reason why they were called the “102nd” is because of the numbers 1 and 2 and nothing (zero) in between. Military tents spread out over the current site of the Coxe Cage, lots B, C and D where the Armory and lacrosse ﬁelds are located. The oﬃcers were quartered in tents across the street at the now Dewitt Cuyler Field, adjacent to the Yale baseball ﬁeld. in the beginning of the war, Yale trained 6\n\nThe highlighTS 1918\n\nAmerican artillery oﬃcers. France sent four 75mm howitzers, one of which is on display at the West haven Veterans Museum and learning Center. Although there was no handsome Dan during this time, a mongrel named stubby wandered into the encampment and befriended the soldiers. in October 1917, the unit shipped out for France and stubby was smuggled aboard the troop ship s.s. Minnesota by private J. Robert Conroy and became the oﬃcial mascot of the 102nd Division. stubby, who served in 17 battles, provided morale lifting visits up and down the line and occasionally early warning about gas attacks by waking a sleeping sentry to alert them. his sensitivity to poisonous gas resulted from his exposure in France. later in the war he was injured in a grenade attack, receiving large amounts of shrapnel in his chest and leg. The war dog also saved lives by leading paramedics to wounded soldiers when he heard the sound of the english language. stubby was honored by three United states presidents and was the ﬁrst dog to be promoted oﬃcially on orders to the rank of sergeant. Conroy returned to the United states with stubby and when Conroy studied law at georgetown University, stubby became the mascot of the hoyas. At halftime of football games, he would nudge a football around the ﬁeld to the amusement of fans. he died in Conroy’s arms in 1926. in 2018 a movie titled Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero, was released.\n\n1918 (no games—war year) Because of the great War, this would be the only year that Yale did not ﬁeld a team from 1872 to the present. Yale’s 1915 football captain, Alex Wilson, who was an infantry captain, died in combat on september 29 in the Battle of Argonne Forest in France. Other players never to return included Joseph stillman, James e. Miller and Andrew Ortmayer. Nov. 1: A trio of ex–harvard and Yale players participated in a unique fundraising drive on New York’s Wall street for the United War Fund. in front of thousands of spectators, Charley Brickley, harvard’s great drop kicker, was successful in booting a football from the steps of the sub-Treasury building across Wall and Broad streets and into the hands of Yale man Jack gates. Brickley kicked while standing on one of the balconies in front of the stock exchange. 7\n\n1919–1920 The highlighTS\n\n1919 (5–) Coach: Albert h. Sharpe; Captain: J. Timothy Callahan Former eli great running back Albert sharpe, a medical doctor, returned to Yale as athletic director and football coach. Following the 1919 season, he was replaced by T.A.D. Jones, who had coached the team before entering government service during World War i. sharpe remained to coach the basketball team for two more years. June 1: Three military planes were ﬂying over the area of the Yale Bowl when two collided 1,000 feet in the air. lieutenant Melvin B. Kelcher and Corporal Joseph Katzman were instantly killed when their plane crashed in a sandy terrace in front of the property of C.e. libbey on Westwood Avenue near Yale Avenue. Oct. 11: Yale defeated North Carolina, 34–7. This would be the ﬁrst of six consecutive years that the teams would play. in this game, Fred “Chuck” Pharr, a 5-foot-6, 150-pound running back, scored the only touchdown for the Tar heels. it would be the only TD that North Carolina would score in the six-year series dominated by Yale. Nov. 15: Princeton got by Yale, 13–6, in the Bowl in front of more than 60,000. Perhaps the most interesting spectator was Mrs. Mary Callahan, the mother of the rival centers, Tim and Mike. she reportedly sat on the Yale side. Tim captained the Yale team in both 1919 and 1920. Mike captained the Tigers in 1920. Tim is one of ﬁve players who captained the Yale football teams for two years. The others were eugene Baker (1876– 77), Walter Camp (1878–79), Ray Tompkins (1882–83) and Frank hinkey (1893–94). Nov.22: Coach Bob Fisher’s harvard football team concluded an undefeated regular season with a 10–3 victory at harvard stadium before an estimated crowd of 50,000. Arnold horween, who would later coach the Crimson, kicked a ﬁeld goal and eddie Casey scored on a reception in the ﬁrst half. Only one touchdown was scored against harvard during the season. Yale’s Jim Braden drop- kicked a series record 53yard Fg.\n\n1920 (5–) Coach: T.A.D. Jones; Captain: J. Timothy Callahan Yale went 58–20–5 in the “Roaring Twenties” and enjoyed its winningest decade in the Yale Bowl, going 54–13–5. Opponents who walked into the gauntlet of the Bowl felt like Christians on their way to the Roman 8\n\nThe highlighTS 1921\n\nColosseum. Because of the size of the Bowl and economic advantage for Yale and its opponents, the elis only played 11 away games in the entire decade. Attendance soared in this era when the average attendance at Yale games was 37,405. it was a time when radio broadcasts reached coast-to-coast and newspapers created sports legends. Many of the gilded writers covered games in the Bowl. Yale alum Rudy Vallee, a saxophonist and arguably the ﬁrst crooner and ﬁrst mass media pop star, would play a solo with the Yale band on occasion and sit with the Yale cheerleaders on the bench. it was decided in November that the Yale players would wear numbered jerseys for the Princeton and harvard games. Captain Tim Callahan was given uniform No. 1. in general, the rest of the Yale team was numbered in alphabetical order from John Acosta to leon Walker. Nov. 1: Princeton spanked Yale in New Jersey, 20–0. in what may have been a ﬁrst in major college football history, brothers Tim (Yale) and Mike (Princeton) Callahan served as opposing captains. This time Mrs. Callahan sat on the Princeton side with her daughter, eunice. Before the game she said that she might sit on the Yale side for a time. Nov. 20: The largest crowd (reportedly 76,000 to 80,000) in the history of sports in the United states jammed the Bowl and saw harvard edge Yale, 9–0. To accommodate the large throng, temporary wooden seats were erected on the lower rim of the Bowl and a tier of temporary seats was completed around the top of the enclosure. All the scoring occurred by virtue of three harvard ﬁeld goals, two by Charley Buell (32 and 15 yards) and the other came from captain Arnold horween (38). Fido Kempton, Yale’s tawny-haired QB, and harvard end John gaston were banished for ﬁghting. Unlike the Yale eleven, the harvards remained unnumbered. Crimson coach Bob Fisher was quoted as saying, “football is a team game and not a game of eleven individuals.” harvard would go on to beat the Oregon Webfoots, now known as the Ducks, 7–6, in the east–West Tournament Bowl, now known as the Rose Bowl.\n\n1921 (8–1) Coach: T.A.D. Jones; Captain: Malcolm P. Aldrich This was the ﬁrst year the Yale team wore numbered jerseys for every game. 9\n\n1922 The highlighTS\n\nOct. 22: Yale beat Army, 14–7. The entire Army Cadet Corps traveled by train to New haven where they were met by the Yale Reserve Oﬃcers Training Corps and escorted to the Yale Commons. Following lunch, the Cadets marched to the Bowl and gave a dress parade at 1:45. Nov. 12: Thanks to two fourth quarter ﬁeld goals by Yale All-American halfback Mac Aldrich, Yale downed Princeton, 13–7. Among those in attendance was Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the Commander of the Allied forces in World War i. Foch, dressed in his gray-blue uniform, received a “soul-stirring” ovation from the 75,000 fans. Before the game the eli band played the famous French marching song, “la Madelon” before marching to a point in front of Foch’s box on the Yale side where the band broke into “la Marseillaise,” France’s national anthem. At the end of the ﬁrst quarter, Foch crossed the ﬁeld to the Princeton side accompanied by Yale President James Rowland Angell and Connecticut governor everett J. lake. Princeton President John grier hibben greeted Foch on the visitors’ side. speculators (scalpers) in an apparent attempt to beat the law, sold tickets at face value if fans purchased “a very ﬁne fountain pen” for $25. Nov. 19: The Bulldogs again walked away licking its wounds after suffering a 10–3 defeat at the hands of harvard in front of 55,000 in Boston. Yale drew ﬁrst blood in the opening frame when captain Mac Aldrich booted a 12-yard Fg. The Crimson were held scoreless until the fourth quarter when they scored 10 points. The damaging play was Charley Buell’s punt return from midﬁeld to the Yale 12 yard line before george Owen crossed the goal line two bucks later. Owen subsequently added a 30-yard Fg to complete the scoring.\n\n1922 (6––1) Coach: T.A.D. Jones; Captain: Ralph e. Jordan starting this season, the “try for point” rule (run, pass or kick) following a touchdown was made from the 5 yard line. A team could either kick an extra point after a touchdown as usual, or place the ball anywhere beyond the 5 yard line and try to score either by touchdown or by a kick and receive the one point if successful. On the try for a point, any foul by the defense awarded the offense the point, and any foul by the offense made the try no good. This was the last time that Yale played a 10-game season until 1980. Sept. 0, 1922: Charles O’hearn booted a 52-yard ﬁeld goal as the elis beat Carnegie Tech, 13–0. 0\n\nThe highlighTS 1922\n\nOct. 1: The Jones brothers, howard and Tad, renewed their coaching rivalry that dated back to 1909 when howard’s Yale eleven blanked Tad’s syracuse team. Again, howard came out on top when his undefeated national champion iowa hawkeyes edged Yale in the Bowl, 6–0. iowa’s lone touchdown came on a 9-yard run by quarterback leland Parkin in the second quarter, capping a 59-yard drive. “he was too fast for his interference,” wrote the New York Times. “seeing an opening directly ahead, Parkin cut for it like a frightened rabbit making for his hole.” it was the hawkeyes’ 12th straight victory in a streak that reached 20 games. The game was carried on WOR Radio (Newark, New Jersey), marking the ﬁrst professional broadcast of a Yale football game. Nov. 18: Coach Bill Roper’s Princeton Tigers, labeled the “Team of Destiny” by writer grantland Rice, ﬁnished a perfect season with a 3–0 win over Yale at Palmer stadium. The Oﬃcial NCAA Division I Records Book listed Princeton, along with California, Cornell, iowa and Vanderbilt as national champions. The Tigers were led by captain Mel Dickenson, consensus All-America herb Treat, and the legendary Pink Baker. Nov. 25: harvard defeated Yale, 10–3. The harvard scores came on a 1-yard plunge by george Owen and a 34-yard ﬁeld goal by Karl Pfaffman. The elis’ only tally was a 20-yard ﬁeld goal by Charles O’hearn. harvard dominated the series from 1909 to 1922, earning an 8–2–2 record. For the ﬁrst time in the history of the harvard football program, the Crimson wore numbers on the backs of their jerseys. Among the 78,000 in the Bowl was French premier georges Clemencau, the prime minister of France in World War i. like Foch the year before, he diplomatically switched sides at halftime while both bands played the Marseillaise. Clemencau’s presence did not impress Damon Runyon, the celebrated short story ﬁctional writer, who covered the game for the Washington Times. he wrote, “The possibility of a break in the football relations between harvard and Princeton recently attracted more serious attention and discussion than the purpose of Clemencau’s visit.” in ﬁnishing the season with losses to Princeton and harvard, some of the old Blues were getting restive with Yale coach T.A.D. Jones. Undaunted, he said grimly, “i will not be driven out by a crowd of tailorshop gamblers. Nor will they dictate Yale’s athletic policy.” 1\n\n192 The highlighTS\n\n192 (8–0) Coach: T.A.D. Jones; Captain: William M. Mallory The 1923 Yale team, augmented by talented transfers, ﬁnished 8–0, and is considered one of the greatest in the modern era. They outscored opponents, 230–38. since 1920, only the 1923 and 1960 teams have enjoyed undefeated and untied seasons. Captain Bill Mallory (fullback) and Century Milstead (tackle) earned All-America honors. March 1: Thanks to the generous $350,000 donation of henry g. lapham, a wealthy Boston investment banker and president of the Boston garden–Arena Corporation, ground was broken for the lapham Field house on Derby Avenue. The ﬁeld house has been used by athletes since that time. Oct. 1: in the ﬁrst meeting ever between the two schools, Yale blanked the University of georgia in the Bowl, 40–0. in the battle of the “Bulldogs,” georgia won six of the eleven contests that were played between 1923 and 1934. Nov. : Yale overwhelmed Army, 31– “Memphis Bill” Mallory, an 10, in front of an estimated 80,000 fans in All- American fullback, led the 192 Yale team to an unde- the Bowl, the largest crowd to ever attend feated season. a game in the historic saucer. Of the 10 largest crowds to see a game at the Yale Bowl, ﬁve have come against Army. The Cadets led at the intermission, 10–7, thanks to the dazzling 80-yard run by QB george smythe in the second quarter. But the elis turned it around in the second half. lyle Richeson twice picked off smythe and Mal stevens added another interception. Ted Blair, Richard luman, and Newell Neidlinger crossed the goal line for the elis. The win gave Yale a 15–3–5 mark in the 23 games played since their ﬁrst meeting in 1893. Nov. 2: Yale completed a perfect undefeated and untied season, beating harvard, 13–0, in Boston under a pelting rain on a muddy ﬁeld. legendary writer grantland Rice wrote, “The game was played on a gridiron of seventeen lakes, ﬁve quagmires and a water hazard.” Raymond 2\n\nThe highlighTS 192\n\n“Ducky” Pond, future Yale head coach and All American for the season, returned a fumble 67 yards for a touchdown, Yale’s ﬁrst touchdown versus harvard since World War i. Fittingly, Ducky scored the only touchdown. it’s a myth, however, that Pond earned his nickname because of his sure-footed running in the harvard stadium goo. he carried that moniker with him when he entered Yale from his native Torrington, Connecticut. it was reported that Babe Ruth provided broadcast commentary during the contest.\n\n192 (6–0–2) Coach: T.A.D. Jones; Captain: Winslow M. lovejoy starting this season, the try for point (run, pass or kick) following a touchdown was made from the 3 yard line. Christy Walsh, Babe Ruth’s agent, established the All-American Board of Football. The plan was most likely intended to replace Walter Camp’s annual All-America teams. such football luminaries as Knute Rockne, howard Jones, glenn “Pop” Warner and Yale coach T.A.D. Jones were recruited to offer their opinions in ghostwritten columns by Walsh. Oct. : North Carolina’s abject failure against Yale continued as the Bulldogs defeated the Tar heels, 27–0, in the Bowl. Oct. 18: Yale and Dartmouth played to a 14–14 tie. Yale was on an unbeaten streak that would reach 18 games and Dartmouth was embarked on a 22-game run. Oct. 1: The Yale and Army elevens both practiced in the Bowl. Because the Army squad did not arrive on time, Yale under the direction of coach T.A.D. Jones, took the ﬁeld ﬁrst. Army then drilled until after dark before returning to their headquarters at the hotel Clark in Derby. Nov. 1: A sold out crowd that paid three dollars each stood as an Army bugler played, “last Call” and the Yale band played “Fair harvard” in memory of Percy haughton, the famed ex–harvard coach who had died on October 27. Then Yale and Army engaged in a 7–7 tie in front of 78,000 including secretary of War John W. Weeks. Yale’s only score came in the ﬁrst quarter on Ducky Pond’s dazzling 47-yard run into the south end zone. harry Wilson’s last-quarter TD pulled the Cadets even. The New York Times wrote, “For in addition of seeing a football game that was as hard fought as Chateau-Thierry and as thrilling as a boy’s ﬁrst \n\n1925 The highlighTS\n\nlong trousers, the great crowd witnessed a demonstration of rhythmic grace and military precision such as only West Point cadets can give.” good tickets were scalped for $50. Nov. 22: Yale completed an undefeated season (6–0–2) by downing harvard, 19–6, in a chilly, persistent downpour in the Bowl. Bill Kline scored two of Yale’s TDs on 1-yard plunges. Pond scored on another 1yard run. harvard’ s points were scored by erwin gehrke’s two Fgs. Both captains, Win lovejoy (Yale) and Malcolm greenough (harvard), both played center and faced each other head-to-head.\n\n1925 (5–2–1) Coach: T. A.D. Jones; Captain: John h. Joss March 1: Walter Camp, the “Father of American Football,” was found dead in his room at the hotel Belmont in New York City between sessions of a football rules committee meeting. Accounts in the New York Times indicated that Camp was not visibly ill when he turned in for the night. Because Camp never showed for a morning meeting, Princeton coach Bill Roper and committee member W. s. langford were dispatched to the hotel but got no response after calling his room. The manager of the hotel then supplied a carpenter to go to Camp’s room. A panel was removed from the door and Camp was found dead. scores of Yale students and New haven residents paid their respects at Camp’s home on 460 humphrey street in New haven. he is buried at the grove street Cemetery in New haven alongside his wife, Alice, and son Walter Jr., who lettered in football at Yale"
