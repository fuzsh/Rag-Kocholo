I even hate simEugenio Suarez. Argh.\n\nYeah, the simCubs lost on an eighth-inning moonshot by Suarez after a slightly shorter drive by Freddie Galvis tied the score earlier in the inning. Tyler Olson gave up both dingers and his spot in the bullpen. Anthony Rizzo extended his league lead with his 24th home run, so at least there’s that highlight to see.\n\nAfter the game a couple of deals went on, elsewhere in the league. Details will be in the Friday Brandon Palmer interview, your source for all things simCub.\n\nColin Rea rejoined the Iowa rotation as he returned from wherever he’s been, and Mills will be stretched out as a starter.\n\nToday, the simCubs start a weekend series at Yankee Stadium. Al will have more about the game in the game post at 2:30 p.m. CT, and then I’ll post the actual URL to the stream at 3 p.m. CT. Or you can catch the game at the BCB Media Center and also catch past games and game videos, if you want the full #simCubs experience.\n\n... on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue brings a you a lighthearted Cubs-centric look at baseball’s past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow along as we review hand-picked scenes from the rich tapestry of Chicago Cubs and Major League Baseball history*.\n\nToday in baseball history:\n\n1906 - In an Iowa State League game at Waterloo, IA, Herbert Whitney, catcher for the Burlington Pathfinders, is beaned by a pitch from Fred Evans and his skull is fractured. He will die from the injury, becoming the first professional baseball player to die as a result of being hit by a pitch. (1,3)\n\n1916 - The Indians became the first major league club to field a team with numbered uniforms when they take on Chicago at Cleveland’s League Park. Jack Graney, leading off for the Tribe, is the first batter to wear a number in the 20th Century. However, the use of large numerals on the players’ left sleeve and corresponding scorecards last just a few weeks, and, after a brief trial next season, the concept will be abandoned. (1,3)\n\n1920 - Lou Gehrig gets his first national mention when, as a high school junior for New York City’s School of Commerce, he steals the show in a high school championship game against Lane Tech in Chicago. His grand slam home run in the 8th gives the New York team a 12-8 victory. Scouts sit with open mouths as the ball sails out of the National League park (later known as Wrigley Field). (1,3)\n\n1938 - Carl Hubbell wins his 200th game, as the Giants beat the visiting Cubs, 5 - 1, and stretch their lead over the second-place Reds to two games. Larry French takes the loss. Newly-acquired Bob Seeds, up from Newark, leads the way with a 470-foot inside-the-park homer to the Eddie Grant memorial in dead center. (1,3)\n\n1960 - With the help of Ron Santo, making his major league debut, the Cubs sweep a doubleheader from first-place Pittsburgh, 7-5 and 7-6. The rookie third baseman, who will be elected into the Hall of Fame posthumously by the Veterans Committee in 2012, goes 3-for-7, driving in five runs during the twin bill at Forbes Field. (1,3)\n\n1960 - Hoping to speed up the election process, the Hall of Fame changes its voting procedures. The new rules allow the Special Veterans Committee to vote annually, rather than every other year, and to induct up to two players a year. The BBWAA is authorized to hold a runoff election of the top 30 vote getters if no one is elected in the first ballot. (2,3)\n\n1966 - Chicago’s Ron Santo singles in the 1st and his next time up is struck in the face by a Jack Fisher pitch that fractures his cheek. Before Santo’s at bat, the Mets’ Ron Hunt and the Cubs’ Adolfo Phillips had both been hit by pitches. Santo will be operated on the following day but will return to action in a week. The injury ends his consecutive game streak at 390, but his 27-game hitting streak continues. (1,3)\n\n1968 - The major league Executive Council decides that both the A.L. and N.L. will play 162-game schedules in 1969 and operate two six-team divisions. (2)\n\n1985 - At Jack Russell Stadium, the organist is ejected by umpire Keith O’Connor from a Class A Florida League game for playing Three Blind Mice following a close call which goes against the Clearwater Phillies. After NBC’s Today show weatherman Willard Scott and syndicated radio host Paul Harvey report the incident, the self-taught musician becomes famous, signing autographs, “Wilbur Snapp, Three Blind Mice organist.” (1)\n\n1985 - The Cubs beat the Mets, 7-3, ending a club-record-tying losing streak at 13 games, their longest loss streak since 1944. (3)\n\n2015 - Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg resigns in his third season with his team in last place. (3)\n\nCubs birthdays: Topsy Hartsel, Elmer Ponder, Elmer Yoter, George Milstead, Babe Herman, Elmer Singleton, Howie Pollet, Dave Rosello, Manny Seoane, Mike Griffin, Rodney Myers, Jason Kendall. Also notable: Willard Brown HOF, Derek Jeter HOF.\n\nSources:\n\n(1) — The National Pastime.\n\n(2) — Today in Baseball History.\n\n(3) — Baseball Reference.\n\n(4) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n\n(5) — Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n(6) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\n*We try to vet each item.
