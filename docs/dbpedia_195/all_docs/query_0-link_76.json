        "text": "On Saturday night, I stood in a basement space in the East Village, holding hands with a man who was attempting to regurgitate a bean, possibly cannellini. The bean, he promised, would have a number on it that matched a slip of paper I’d chosen from a plastic bag. The man was red-faced, groaning and coughing and retching. (I’m still not sure why he had to hold my hand.) Finally, he ejected the numbered bean from an unlikely orifice. Everyone applauded.\n\nEither I was having a very peculiar nightmare or I was back at the New York International Fringe Festival.\n\nThe festival, which sprawls across the Village for a couple of weeks in August, is in its 19th iteration. Every year, parents, friends and co-workers help fill the venues. Every year, talent and skill glint amid the amateurism and malfunctioning air-conditioners.\n\nThere are arguments to be had over whether New York, with its wealth of performance spaces, really needs a Fringe. But the Fringe participants seem to need New York. Walking the streets around the venues, you sense so much ambition, so much hope, so many maxed-out credit cards. A lot of the offerings aren’t very good, but the total event is wonderful and terrible and heartbreaking.\n\nOn the opening weekend, which started Friday, I saw 10 shows, a sampling of the 185 on offer. Until word of mouth starts circulating, there is little to go on, just a title and a few sentences in the program guide that I study intently, trying to pick shows I’ll like. For example, I do like magic shows. Or I used to.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
