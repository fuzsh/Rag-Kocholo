        "text": "Providence Cycledrome\n\nJohn Spellman, wrestling Gold Medal\n\nwinner at the 1924 Olympics\n\nThe Providence Steam Roller played their home games in an unusual stadium, the Cycledrome.\n\nBuilt primarily for bicycle racing by Peter Laudatti, one of the team owners, the arena seated 10,000 in bleachers surrounding an wooden banked cycle track. The oval track, steeply banked around the turns but flatter on the straightaways, barely left enough room inside it for a football field. In fact, it wasn't quite enough.\n\nThe players' benches and some seating for fans rested on the track, which ran right up against the sidelines. As a result, players tackling or being tackled near the edge of the field frequently wound up in the first row of seats. Also, the track cut off the last five yards of one end zone. The goal posts were on the goal line, as they were for many more decades in the NFL.\n\nFans had a great view of the action whether they bought $2, $1.50, or $1 tickets.\n\nThe stadium included only one dressing room, built to accommodate a few bikers and not the Steam Roller squad, who had to take turns using the two showers. But at least the home team had a locker room. The visiting team had to dress at its hotel before coming to the stadium, then return in dirty, smelly uniforms to shower.\n\nThe field had a simple scoreboard and press box and a small area for parking, which was adequate for 1928 when few owned cars.\n\nMany of the Steam Roller's 18 players hailed from New England.\n\nBrown University, the hometown school, contributed three players: Curly Oden who had been with Providence since 1922 and excelled as a kick returner and pass receiver; lineman Orland Smith; and another lineman, John Spellman, who also worked as a professional wrestler. Rookie Pop Williams came from Connecticut Agricultural College.\n\nThe Cronin brothers, Bill and Jack, had starred for Boston College. Another wrestler, Gus Sonnenberg, who played without a helmet, came from Dartmouth.\n\nOther players came from further away.\n\nPlayer-coach Jimmy Conzelman had played at Washington of St. Louis. His star was TB George \"Wildcat\" Wilson, a 1925 All-American at another Washington, in Seattle. Three good players came from the Cleveland Bulldogs, which had folded after the 1927 season: back Jim Simmons and linemen Clyde Smith and Milt Rehnquist. Smith had made All-Pro at C in 1927 while the 230-pound Rehnquist was among the largest players in the league.\n\nVeteran ends Norm Harvey and Duke Hanny excelled more as blockers and defenders than as pass receivers, which was typical of terminals in that era. Other linemen included 5'6\" Jack Fleischman, veteran Jim Laird, and Abe Wilson, Wildcat's brother.\n\nThe lineman with the most interesting story called himself Perry Jackson. Conzelman had heard of a star lineman by that name playing in Oklahoma and sent him a cable inviting him to tryout for the Steam Roller. Since the real Jackson was ill that summer, his teammate Arnold Schockley came for the tryout under Jackson's name and made the team, playing three years under the alias. The real Jackson later played one season under his buddy's name on a pro team in Boston!\n\nThis was the team that began its 11-game slate that included neither Chicago team, the Bears or the Cardinals."
