Less than a month later, on Sept. 17, they gathered again, this time joined by representatives of other teams from the Midwest and East Coast.\n\nThey reached an agreement and settled on the American Professional Football Association as the name of their organization.\n\nThe name lasted only two years. But the organization survives today as the National Football League.\n\nIt is now a national obsession every autumn, the most popular sports entity in the world with annual revenues of more than $8 billion.\n\nAnd the Quad-Cities was in on the ground floor. The Rock Island Independents were a charter member of the league and hosted the first NFL game.\n\nThrough the years, more than 70 Quad-Citians have played in the league, including 12 All-Pros, a Hall of Famer and two almost Hall of Famers.\n\nThe area also produced the NFL's first full-time commissioner, two highly respected officials and a defensive mastermind.\n\nA look at 100 connections between the Quad-Cities and the NFL as the league prepares to embark on its 101st season ...\n\n1. The Rock Island Independents were one of 14 charter members of what originally was known as the American Professional Football Association. Owner Walter Flanigan represented the team at that Sept. 17, 1920 meeting in Canton, Ohio, at which the league was formed.\n\n2. The Independents hosted the first NFL game on Sept. 26, 1920, at Douglas Park in Rock Island, defeating the St. Paul Ideals 48-0. Davenport’s Waddy Kuehl scored two touchdowns, on an 82-yard interception return in the third quarter and a 27-yard run in the fourth quarter.\n\n3. Kuehl, who attended both St. Ambrose and Dubuque University, ended up playing five seasons in the NFL with Rock Island (1920 and 1923), Detroit (1921), Buffalo (1921-22) and Dayton (1924).\n\n4. Kuehl was one of at least seven local residents who played at least one game for the Independents in their debut season in 1920. Others were Moline’s Pudge Wyland and George Magerkurth, Rock Island’s Jerry Mansfield, Loyal Robb and Paddy Quinn, and Wilton’s Charlie Mockmore.\n\n5. The Independents and the Chicago Bears, who were the Decatur Staleys for their first two years, had a ferocious rivalry. They played one another 13 times in the first six years of the NFL with only one of those games being decided by more than a touchdown. The Indees were 1-8-4 against the Bears/Staleys and lost only six other games in those six years.\n\n6. The Moline Universal Tractors, who were not a member of the NFL, were the Decatur Staleys’ first opponent after the new league was formed. The Staleys defeated the Tractors 20-0 in an exhibition game on Oct. 3, 1920 in Decatur.\n\n7. The Staleys’ second game was a 25-7 victory over the Walworth Unions, a semi-pro team based in Kewanee. The Unions scored one of the three touchdowns Decatur allowed that season when Hub Shoemake returned an interception about 50 yards for a score. The Staleys signed Shoemake to play for them the following year.\n\n8. Burt Ingwersen, who was born in Fulton and grew up in Clinton, started at tackle for the Staleys in 1920 before going into coaching. He later served as the head coach at the University of Iowa.\n\n9. Halfback Sol Butler, who attended Rock Island High School, was one of the first Black players in the NFL. He played in 23 games from 1923 through 1926 with Akron, Hammond, Canton and Rock Island.\n\n10. Former Notre Dame player Forrest \"Fod'' Cotton was a 190-pound tackle for the Rock Island Independents in 1923 and 1925 while also serving as the football and basketball coach at St. Ambrose.\n\n11. Former St. Ambrose player Les Hearden played in two games with the Green Bay Packers in 1924 and scored a touchdown on a pass from coach/quarterback Curly Lambeau in a 19-0 victory over the Minneapolis Marines.\n\n12. Jim Thorpe, considered by some to be the greatest all-around athlete in American history, played for Rock Island in 1924. Thorpe actually served as the first president of the NFL while playing for the Canton Bulldogs in 1920.\n\n13. Among the Independents’ best players was center Lou Kolls, a former Rock Island High School and St. Ambrose player, who was with them from 1921 through 1926 after beginning his career with the Hammond Pros. Two other Rocky alums, Vince McCarthy and Paul Anderson, saw brief action with the Indees in 1924 and 1925.\n\n14. Kolls was one of two Independents players who became major league baseball umpires. He worked in the American League from 1933 to 1940 and Magerkurth was employed by the National League from 1929 to 1947. He was behind the plate for Babe Ruth’s famed ‘’called shot’’ in the 1932 World Series.\n\n15. Former St. Ambrose player Frank DeClerk played 20 games at center for the Independents from 1923 through 1925.\n\n16. Other St. Ambrose alums who briefly played in the NFL in the 1920s included fullback Mark Devlin (Rock Island, Cleveland and New York, 1920-21) and halfback David Zuidmulder (Green Bay, 1929-31).\n\n17. After six years in the NFL, the Independents jumped to the American Football League and played their games at Browning Field in Moline. The new league, which lasted only one season, was built around Red Grange, who played for the New York Yankees at Browning on Oct. 3, 1926.\n\n18. Howard \"Cub '' Buck moved to the Quad-Cities after a lengthy NFL career. He played for the Canton Bulldogs in 1920, then spent five seasons as a two-way tackle, kicker and punter with the Packers (1921-25). He later opened a car dealership in Rock Island.\n\n19. Former Iowa All-American Fred \"Duke '' Slater, from Clinton, was the first African American lineman to play in the NFL, spending time with the Milwaukee Badgers (1922), Rock Island Independents (1922-25) and Chicago Cardinals (1926-31). He was named first-team All-NFL four times and made the league’s all-decade team for the 1920s.\n\n20. While still playing in the NFL, Slater earned his law degree and began a practice in Chicago. He served as Cook County municipal court judge from 1948 until his death in 1966.\n\n21. Slater became the first Quad-City product to be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year in conjunction with the league’s 100th anniversary. His induction ceremony has been postponed until next year.\n\n22. Slater and Thorpe were two of five Pro Football Hall of Famers who played for the Independents during their six years in the NFL. The others are Jimmy Conzelman, Joe Guyon and Ed Healey.\n\n23. Moline’s Chet Widerquist played six years in the NFL as a 6-foot-1, 219-pound tackle and was named to the Collyers Eye Magazine all-pro teams in 1925 and 1926. He spent time with the Milwaukee Badgers, Rock Island Independents, Chicago Cardinals, Detroit Wolverines and Minneapolis Red Jackets.\n\n24. Rock Island graduate Century \"Wally '' Milstead started 24 of 30 games with the New York Giants (1925, 1927-28) and made All-Pro teams in 1925 and 1927.

Blue Grass native Ralph Claypool, a 5-9, 191-pound center, started 28 of 30 games with the Chicago Cardinals from 1925 through 1928. He made All-Pro teams in both 1925 and 1926.\n\n26. The Cardinals later had another starting center from the Quad-Cities. Moline’s Mickey Erickson started 19 games for them from 1930 through 1932, then finished his career later in 1932 with the Boston Redskins.\n\n27. Davenport’s Gus Mastrogany played one game at end with the Bears in 1931.\n\n28. After starring at quarterback for Northwestern, Moline’s Walt Holmer played five seasons in the NFL from 1929-33 with the Bears, Cardinals, Redskins and Steelers. He later served as the head coach at Boston University and Colby College.\n\n29. Moline native Marvin “Swede’’ Ellstrom played halfback from 1934 through 1936 with four different teams: The Philadelphia Eagles, Boston Redskins, Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cardinals.\n\n30. Long before Brett Favre made jersey No. 4 famous with Green Bay, Rock Island’s Herb Schneidman wore that number as a blocking back with the Packers from 1935-39. He helped them win NFL titles in 1936 and 1939.\n\n31. Offensive lineman Forrest Burmeister of Davenport played for the Cleveland Rams in their first two years in the NFL (1937-38), playing in 12 games.\n\n32.

He also played for the New York Yanks of the AFL in 1940.\n\n34. Davenport native Elmer Layden, a highly successful head coach at Columbia (now Loras), Duquesne and Notre Dame, became the first full-time commissioner of the NFL in 1940. He held the job until 1945 and implemented several innovations, including improved officiating, the requiring of all players to wear helmets and the idea of free substitution.\n\n35. During World War II, Layden instituted the routine of playing the national anthem prior to each game. Upon leaving the league in 1945, he insisted that the practice continue.\n\n36. Former St. Ambrose athlete Nick Keriasotis played nine games at guard for the Chicago Bears in 1942 and one game in 1945.\n\n37. St. Ambrose alumnus Ted Lapka played in 19 games with the Washington Redskins (1943-44, 1946), catching 9 passes for 128 yards. His first touchdown came on an 11-yard pass from Hall of Famer Sammy Baugh in a 1943 playoff victory over the New York Giants.\n\n38. After finishing third in the Heisman Trophy voting at Minnesota in 1940, Davenport native George \"Sonny '' Franck played four seasons with the Giants (1941, 1945-47).

Moline’s Edsel \"Ed'' Gustafson was a center and linebacker with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC in 1947 and 1948, starting 17 of 27 games.\n\n42. Davenport native and long-time East Moline resident Bob Austin spent 22 years as an NFL official, from 1941 to 1963, and worked NFL championship games in 1948, 1949 and 1958. Austin, who also served in the Illinois House of Representatives, worked as a technical advisor for the AFL after retiring as an official.\n\n43. Davenport resident John Lujack was a first-round draft choice of the Chicago Bears and enjoyed four highly successful pro seasons (1948-51) before having his career ended by a shoulder injury. Lujack then moved to the Quad-Cities and opened a car dealership with his father-in-law.\n\n44. Lujack, who won the Heisman Trophy at Notre Dame in 1947, starred on both sides of the ball. He had eight interceptions on defense in 1948, then led the NFL in pass completions and attempts, passing yards (2,658) and passing touchdowns (23) in 1949. In the final game of the season, he passed for an NFL record 468 yards and six touchdowns. He also ran for 11 TDs in 1950.\n\n45.
