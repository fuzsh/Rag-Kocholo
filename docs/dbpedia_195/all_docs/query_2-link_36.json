        "text": "By Natalie Covher\n\nThe last Kiwanis meeting before the vote on proposed changes was held Thursday, Sept. 8 at the NSU recreation complex.\n\nMembers were given a preliminary October calendar to show how the month would look if the I-Plan vote passes. The calendar included several service projects and clearly mapped out how the club would meet under the I-plan.\n\nDavid Waskom expressed concern over casting his vote and wondered how the board will hold future presidents accountable to upholding the proposed changes. Sighting that not all past presidents continued the work of their predecessors and wondered if the club would lose traditions if the cycle continued.\n\n“I have had a front row seat to watch this club go from a 160-member club to a 30-member club,” said Waskom. “I’m not saying that it is a bad thing but I am wondering if we should be having exit conferences with parting members to see why they are leaving. I also don’t buy in to the ‘get more members to do more service’ idea. I believe that if we build it they will come.”\n\nDion Boyett responded by reiterating the basis of the I-plan.\n\n“This is not a problem unique to our club,” said Boyett. “The I-plan helps get members involved from bottom to top. Going and getting 20 new members so we can do something doesn’t work. If we want to grow our group, we have to get out there and do service projects to help the community. Then incoming members that have seen the work we do will want to be involved because they want to make a difference. Hopefully this format will help disperse the work amongst the entirety of the club.”\n\nDuring the meeting, the date for this year’s Kiwanis Kid’s Day was set for Oct. 29.\n\nGuests included Sandra Foster and Caroline Miller of Legacy Hospice.\n\nWe are living through an information revolution and life will not be the same when the dust settles. If you are a history buff, take comfort this revolution happened once before. It is summed up in a silly story.\n\nA man loved old books. He met an acquaintance who had just thrown away a Bible that had been stored in the attic of his ancestral home for generations. “I couldn’t read it,” the friend explained. “Somebody named Guten-something had printed it.” “Not Gutenberg!” the book lover exclaimed in horror. “That Bible was one of the first books ever printed. Why, a copy just sold for over two million dollars!” His friend was unimpressed. “Mine wouldn’t have brought a dollar. Some fellow named Martin Luther had scribbled all over it in German.”\n\nGutenberg’s printing press and the changes connected with it led to the Renaissance and then the Protestant Reformation. Many of the struggles the church and society have with each other are the mature plants of seeds sown during the printing revolution of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. If you are member of a Protestant or Free Church you can trace your church, not back to John the Baptist or to Jesus but to Johannas Gutenberg a German blacksmith.\n\nThe printing press freed knowledge and spirituality from the University and Cathedral. The masses could freely consume information.\n\nThe revolution today is similar. We call it the digital revolution. Rather than the masses consuming the information, we now produce it.\n\nIn this revolution knowledge, opinion, and even spirituality have become what you make it. In the digital world, you can be your own guru, monk, publisher, scholar, philosopher, talking head, fantasy sports expert, day trading broker and political insider. The first information revolution moved knowledge from public institutions to private consumption. One did not need to attend a lecture or a sermon; one could read in the privacy of their own dwelling. This second revolution is ironically retrograding in nature. In the digital world we have moved from private back to public.\n\nEverything in our lives is made public. Our public exhibitionism is all done from the privacy of our desktops or devices. We can anonymously and without accountability express any opinion, weigh in on any debate and publish our opinions for the world to see. The town square, the barber and beauty shop have been replaced by the WiFi Hotspot. We now sit in a room filled with people on our devices ordering our world, while the big world keeps on spinning. This revolution is personal and private, yet we share the results without filters in public ways. Some newspapers and blogs have seen the danger of unfiltered opinion and removed the public comment sections of their electronic editions. Bubba sharing his opinion with Bambi over a beer is one thing, publishing it for public consumption another.\n\nWe are fire away at the ignorance of “them” while waxing eloquent about “our” virtues. “We” can do it better than “they” can. Just ask us.\n\nAfter forty years of doing this, here is the truth. “Some people are saying,” means “The other day my wife said to me.” “Lots of people think,” means, “I think this and need to bolster my opinion with the notion that other people share my opinion.” When a politician says, “My constituents tell me.” That is simply a damn lie! Some people and lots of people are concerned about them and what they are doing. If they were more like us then we would be happy with them. This digital revolution has allowed the inmates to comment on and shape the public view of the asylum. And because no one wants to rock any boat these days, guess who is now running the asylum? No longer is the scholar, scientist, philosopher, or wise person the shaper of ideas. Bubba and his high speed bandwidth can get in the mix now! If lots of loud people get on public media they can fix the LSU offense.\n\nRevolutions are messy and leave casualties. They are also the seedbed for great change.\n\nJesus started a revolution that is still going on. It is a revolution that can save our current revolution from leading us to self-centered disaster. Jesus calls his people to transformation and to be agents of transformation. He called us to be saved. Here is my uncomfortable thought for the article. How would Christians live differently if we believed that Jesus needs to save the world from us?\n\nThe British writer G.K. Chesterton gave a famous two word response when a newspaper asked its readers to share what they thought was wrong with the world.\n\n“I am,” he wrote back.\n\nMe too!\n\n“Graduates of Northwestern State University’s Engineering Technology programs are equipped to understand, design, analyze and work effectively in industrial settings utilizing product/process control systems and electrical power systems,” said Bill Fontenot, chief operating officer for Cleco Power. “Cleco is proud to support NSU’s Engineering Technology programs as we are dependent on graduates who understand local, national and global issues related to the electrical power industry.”\n\nAs a show of support for NSUs’ Engineering Technology program, Cleco recently completed three years of funding $15,000 in scholarships that are awarded to five students each academic year. Three are for entering freshmen focused on Electronics Engineering Technology (EET) or Industrial Engineering Technology (IET). Preference for the entering freshmen scholarships is given to residents of Allen, Avoyelles, Grant, Rapides and Vernon parishes. Two scholarships are awarded to senior students with preference to students from Avoyelles and Rapides parishes.\n\n“I was brought to this program by my love for structure and system,” said Shane Perkins, a freshman from Leesville. “I have always love creating things since I was young.”\n\nPerkins said that uncertainties in the oil and gas industry left his father worrying about paying for Perkins’ tuition and expenses. Being awarded a Cleco scholarship made a big difference.\n\n“This scholarship means more to me than most would assume,” he said. “It’s things such as this scholarship that mean the world to me.”\n\nNSU’s Engineering Technology programs have a long history of providing workforce training and qualified graduates to meet the demands of employers such as Cleco. Students in the Electronics Engineering Technology concentration learn to analyze, build, test, operate and maintain electrical systems. The programs were designated an Area of Excellence by the University of Louisiana System Board of Supervisors and are accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.\n\n“I love how open and willing the professors are not only to teach in front of an entire class, but also work side by side with you to find solutions and acquire your goals,” Perkins said. “To any future student interested in joining the engineering program, I encourage you to take this opportunity and dive in head first. These professors are some of the smartest men I know, and I am certain that they share the same vision as any of their students and will do whatever it takes to see you reach your goals.”\n\nCleco is a regulated utility company headquartered in Pineville. In business since 1935, the company has approximately 1,200 employees serving approximately 287,000 customers from Mansfield to Patterson through its retail business and supplies wholesale power in Louisiana and Mississippi. Cleco owns 10 generating units with a total nameplate capacity of 3,333 megawatts, 11,830 miles of distribution lines and 1,300 miles of transmission lines.\n\n“We are extremely grateful to Cleco for their outstanding support of our Engineering Technology programs,” said Dr. Ali Ahmad, department head. “Enrollment continues to grow in our programs which is helping to meet the demand for technologists capable of using appropriate theory, mathematics and computational technology in support of the electrical power industry.”\n\nFor information on NSU’s Engineering Technology program, visit engrtech.nsula.edu.\n\nCleco Power COO Bill Fontenot, left, presented scholarship funds to Dr. Ali Ahmad, head of Northwestern State University’s Department of Engineering Technology.\n\nBy Nico Van Thyn\n\nFootball people in the state knew Jim Bruning in 1969 when he was the Class AA “Coach of the Year” after guiding a talented, dedicated team.\n\nLed by a talented backfield — All-State quarterback Gene Knecht Jr., tailback Rand Dennis and junior fullback Jim Knecht — that was as big as the Red Devils’ linemen, the team just kept winning.\n\nIt survived a close call in the season opener (7-6 vs. Mansfield), routed its next seven opponents (scoring between 28 to 42 points each week), then survived five close games in a row (the first three playoff games) to reach the state championship game vs. Tallulah at Northwestern’s old Demon Stadium.\n\nTallulah also came in 13-0 and ranked No. 2 in the state poll — behind Natchitoches. The Trojans had a strong football tradition and powerful running game, led by fullback Larry Cox.\n\nBut the game wasn’t close. Bruning’s guys dominated it — and won 27-7.\n\nNatchitoches scored in every quarter, controlling the ball with drives of 7l, 78 and 84 yards — three TDs in its first five possessions.\n\nGene Knecht, soon to be named All-State, was 12-of-15 passing in the three scoring drives. He sneaked two yards for the first TD, then threw TD passes of 11 and 10 yards to Joe Beck Payne.\n\nDennis had 55 rushing yards in 15 carries, with an 8-yard run for the final TD.\n\nLinebacker Ricky Whittington set that up with an interception, one of five Tallulah turnovers (two fumbles, three interceptions).\n\nCox ran for 94 yards on 25 carries, but Tallulah managed only one long drive (75 yards, 18 plays). Its longest drive other than that was 29 yards, and it had only 49 rushing yards after halftime.\n\nJoining Knecht (18 TD passes for the season) on the All-State team were center Steve McCain (also the next season), Whittington and Payne (as a defensive back).\n\nDennis and Jim Knecht went on to play at LSU, starting together as defensive backs; Gene Knecht also signed with LSU, but after a year there, transferred to NSU, which Gene Knecht Sr. was the longtime defensive backs coach.\n\nBruning “was an exceptional coach,” said Jim Knecht. “A good motivator. He motivated you to go beyond what you thought you could do.\n\n“He expected you to do your best. If you didn’t, he’d let you know. He got the best out of his players.”\n\nDennis said Bruning was “a figurehead type head coach” who let his assistants handle the details, such as Levi Thompson devising different offensive schemes each week.\n\n“We had kids who had brains,” said Jim Knecht, “… who were smart, fast and strong. We lined up in slots and trips (formations); no other teams had seen those then.”\n\nIn the state-title game, the Red Devils threw in an unbalanced line and a couple of tackle-eligible passes, both caught by Jerry Sherrill (who’d never caught a pass in a game before.)\n\n“We had good players across the board,” said Dennis.\n\n“Smartest group of kids I ever coached,” said Dan Poole, for a decade the school’s defensive backs and track/field coach until — in his words — he was “demoted” to school principal. “It was the whole team, and they were also very competitive, adjusted to changes very quickly.”\n\nAnd he credits Bruning for this: “I don’t know how he could read the kids so well. We had kids who didn’t look very good in practice, but Jim would play them. He knew which ones would come through in critical situations; he would pick the right ones. He was just great at picking personnel.\n\n“He grew up here, so he knew the families and the kids.”\n\nThe connection started early. Stuart Wright, Natchitoches-Central’s starting quarterback for three seasons (1970-72) and as a freshman the backup to Gene Knecht in 1969, remembers that “what made a difference in our program (in high school) was that he was at every one of our junior high games. He knew us better than we knew him.”\n\nTo be continued…Read PART 3 Sept. 16\n\nNico Van Thyn was a sports writer/editor for more than 45 years, including stints in his hometown with The Shreveport Times and Shreveport Journal. He finished his career with a decade at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He is retired, living in Fort Worth with his wife Bea. They have two children and four grandchildren.\n\nBy Joe Darby\n\nI’ve been doing my best to ignore the presidential race. As I’ve written previously, it’s pretty clear that we have nominated the two worst candidates for president in the history of our country.\n\nBut Mary and I were eating at a restaurant Tuesday night that had CNN on television and all of the talk was about the race. So, as much as I would like, it’s not something I can ignore all the time. So I decided to write another political column.\n\nAlmost every week there are new reasons to not vote for Hilary Clinton or Donald Trump.\n\nNew allegations surface almost daily about Hilary’s email scandal, showing that both her veracity and her good character are almost non-existent. Just this week, it was revealed that one of her aides had coached one of the Democratic senators with soft ball questions to feed her during the hearings on Libya some time back. That tells a lot about character doesn’t it?\n\nAnd what can we say about “The Donald” that hasn’t been said before? Well, there was one thing that came up a few weeks back that just about stunned me. In an interview he said that since we have nuclear weapons, we should use them. What’s the use of having nukes if we’re not going to use them, the good man wanted to know.\n\nDoes he not know what affect using a nuclear bomb would have on this planet, both environmentally and politically? What kind of sensibility, or lack of it, must this man have to even suggest such a thing?\n\nOf course, we have the Libertarian Party and Mary is thinking of voting for the Libertarian candidate. I tell her that, it’s good to stick to principles, but that in fact she would be wasting her vote, because that party does not really have a chance.\n\nSo, what are we to do?\n\nWell, here’s my secret plan, although after this column is posted, I suppose it won’t be secret any more.\n\nI’d like to see all the good, sensible Republican and Democratic members of Congress have a secret meeting and vow that no matter who wins the election, they will immediately impeach the president. It should be no difficult matter to find high crimes and misdemeanors of which Clinton and Trump are guilty, as called for in the Constitution.\n\nSurely, with all their shenanigans, Congress could find crimes to meet the standards of impeachment.\n\nThen, once Hilary or Donald, as the case may be, are kicked out of office, the vice president would take over. Now I’ll admit that I don’t know a whole lot about Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia or Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. But, gosh almighty, either one of those gentlemen would be so much better than the two No. 1’s on the tickets.\n\nHeck, you or I would be better than them. As long as we’re sane and relatively honest, we could be a better president.\n\nSo, there’s my plan. You may take this idea as being tongue in cheek. Or should we really start a phone-in campaign to our Congress members to be brave and save the country?\n\nMary Ann Nowlin introduced Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser at the Chamber Luncheon Wednesday afternoon, Sept. 7 in Natchitoches.\n\nNungesser spoke to Chamber members about the flood in South Louisiana, cuts to the budget, upcoming opportunities for tourism and arts programs. After the state was hit with two floods, the one in March and the most recent one in August, Nungesser is working with Volunteer Louisiana.\n\nIn 1993, Volunteer Louisiana was established in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor to rekindle the spirit of service and citizenship in the state. Nungesser continues the commitment to service in Louisiana. Because over 80 percent of people had no flood insurance because their homes weren’t in flood zones, “If it rains on your home, your in a flood zone.”Nothing is sacred when the flood waters begin to rise.\n\nWith $11 million in cuts to his budget this year, Nungesser said the Lt. Governor’s budget has been cut 50 percent over the last 10 years. He’s sat with Governor John Bel Edwards two weeks after the election and told him there’s a need for them to work together for what’s in the best interest of the state.\n\nWhat’s in the best interest of the state is taking advantage of opportunities for economic development and finding self-sustaining streams of income to take the burden off the backs of the tax payers.\n\n“We have think outside the box,” he said.\n\nA few ways to do this that he mentioned include:\n\n•Open a coffee shop in the state library, which could cover the costs of operating the library\n\n•Form a foundation to raise revenue for cultural recreation, historical sites and state parks\n\n•Build a conference center on a 500 acre tract of land next to Lake Pontchartrain near Fontainebleau State Park, which would bring millions to the foundation\n\n•Sell building in French Quarter for development, which would pay into the foundation\n\n“There isn’t anything we won’t consider,” said Nungesser. “But we’ll make sure it won’t affect local businesses negatively.”\n\nSomething near and dear to his heart is the arts programs in the state. They’ve been zeroed out in the past, but he said his office will continue to fund programming out of the tourism budget.\n\n“Our arts programs across the state are hurting,” he said. “It’s a crime not to nourish and grow the talent we have here.”\n\nOverall, Nungesser said it’s the people that make visitors to Louisiana feel like they’re welcome here.\n\n“It’s the people that sell Louisiana,” he said. “It’s their love and passion that makes the state so unique.”\n\nBorn December 1948, Bryan (67) was raised on a rice farm in Church Point, Louisiana. From early on and throughout his life, he was a tough, focused, driven, multi-skilled and strong man with an engineer mind and incredible work ethic. Bryan received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Agricultural Engineering from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL) in Lafayette. His education did not end there as he continued throughout the rest of his life acquiring training, education and specialties for his many career and volunteer positions.\n\nAt the time of death, Bryan was a devout catholic and member of The Minor Basilica of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church. He also wore many hats. He served as the Director of Utilities for the City of Natchitoches, Chief of Natchitoches Parish Fire District 6, and served on the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff’s Office Reserve Unit and Rescue Team. Bryan also enjoyed horses, team roping and the sport of scuba diving; becoming a specialties diver, rescue diver, and master dive instructor. He left us doing what he loved on a dive in the Dry Tortugas off the coast of Florida on September 3, 2016.\n\nAlthough often perceived as a strong silent type, Bryan had a soft side for this family. He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Donna Hanks Wimberly; one daughter, Laura Wimberly Davis and husband Donovan Davis of Alexandria, Louisiana; six grandchildren, Anna Chelette, Emma Davis, McKenzie Davis, Kendall Davis, Asher Davis and Carson Davis all of Alexandria, Louisiana; one brother, Elliott Chuck Wimberly and wife Judith of Clifton, Virginia.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Harold Joseph Wimberly and Elsie Rita Johnson Wimberly.\n\nPallbearers will be friends and coworkers from Natchitoches Parish Fire District 6 and the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff’s Department; Ralph Hernandez, Michael Sesvold, Chuck Stoker, Doug Rachel, and Sammy Ragan.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nSunday, September 11, 2016 – Wake 5pm to 9pm at Blanchard – St.Denis\n\nMonday, September 12, 2016 – Funeral 10am at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church\n\nInterment will be held at Alexandria Memorial Gardens in Woodworth, Louisiana.\n\nIt’s a lot easier planning to mix team meetings and a pep rally in Turpin Stadium the night before a game, than following an itinerary from a hotel hours away from home.\n\nThat makes a short work week a lot better for Northwestern State football coach Jay Thomas, his staff and team. The Demons kick off their home and Southland Conference schedule Thursday evening at 6 in Turpin Stadium hosting Incarnate Word.\n\nWhile the Cardinals will travel from San Antonio Wednesday, the Demons will be attending class, going through a light walk-through, then into position meetings in the evening before heading outside at 8 to soak up the energy of The Inferno, the NSU student section, at a high-energy pep rally in Turpin Stadium.\n\nThomas and his squad are counting on The Inferno and other Demon fans to provide a boost for the White Out Game Thursday, while the team dons white helmets and white uniforms at home. In his first three seasons as the NSU coach, Thomas’s teams are 11-4 at Turpin Stadium.\n\n“Our student section, our band, they’re just awesome, and that’s a big part of it,” he said. “Our guys take a lot of pride playing in front of their peers, their professors, their friends in town, and the tradition we have here. It makes a difference doing the Demon Walk through the tailgaters, touching the Link monument walking out on the field to warm up, running out of the locker room through the purple smoke right before kickoff.”\n\nNo Demon enjoys playing in Turpin more than senior running back De’Mard Llorens, who has done it for the last eight years, four with NSU after four with Natchitoches Central High School.\n\n“I never wanted to play anywhere else,” he said. “Being a Demon like my brother (Kendrick) was my goal. Now that this is the start of my last season, it’s bittersweet, but right now mostly it’s very exciting.\n\n“I can’t even count how many people from the town come fill the stands, watch me play, watch the Demons play,” said Llorens. “It’s amazing, a really good feeling.”\n\nLlorens savors the novelty of the White Out Game.\n\n“It’s fun. Watching my brother play here (1999-2001, before a year in the NFL at cornerback with the New York Giants), I never saw him wearing white jerseys at home. This is something our generation has started,” he said, starting to grin. “The girls come to the games wearing white, everybody is looking sharp, and it gets us hyped up.”\n\nSenior safety Ralph Green, who wore an all-white tuxedo to one of his high school proms, is completely on board with the special wardrobe.\n\n“It does hype up everybody, a lot. It brings a great vibe to the game for us,” he said.\n\nLlorens has a very simple key to success for the Demons Thursday night.\n\n“Score. Our defense will do its job, and offensively, we just need to put points on the board.”\n\nBy Edwin Crayton\n\nChildhood is supposed to be a time of joy and promise. But statistics show it is becoming much less so. Every day in America, 2,857 high school students drop out of school. An alarming 75% of our young people between the ages of 18 and 25 cannot get into the military because of inadequate literacy, poor health of some sort of criminal history. The percentage of children living in single parent homes more than doubled. Those bleak statistics, gathered from Children’s Defense Fund and personal experience, were shared by Liza Behrendsen, Executive Director of the local El Camino Real chapter of the Boys and Girls Club. Behrendsen spoke at a noon day Rotary Club Luncheon at the Recreation facility at Northwestern, Tuesday, September 6.\n\nBut Behrendsen had good news too: the right mix of attention, love, and parental and community involvement can turn things around and is doing so nationally and here in town. She shared how the Natchitoches chapter of the Boys And Girls Club is doing its part to help. Behrendsen added, “The door to our children’s futures is often crowded with temptation and misdirection, making it difficult for them to reach their own potential. Opportunity is not always given a door to knock on so we built one.” That door she referred to is the door to the Boys and Girl Club where kids are given “hope and opportunity” as she put it.\n\nLocally some kind of door of opportunity is certainly needed when you consider that as much as 30% of children in Natchitoches Parish live below the poverty level. More than 25% of our children have either been suspended or been assigned after school suspension. 60% of club members are from single parents homes—16% higher than all other regions. And 77% of our children are unable to read at grade level. A majority of the local children affected are African American. Yet Behrendsen made it clear that every child regardless of race or family income is really “at risk” because of trends in society.\n\nThe club responds with practical help and compassion. Kids get help from a range of services and character building programs. Among those are mentors, guidance from caring adult volunteers, a computer lab, meals and snacks. There is also a vegetable gardening project. The club provided 15, 812 meals in 2015. Kids went on 38 field trips and the club served over 861 children. But despite the impressive numbers, when she thinks of local children, Behrendsen obviously sees faces instead of numbers. She envisions the children those stats represent. She recalled through personal testimonies, the pleasure of seeing how people benefited years after being members in the club. Behrendsen said, “The statistics make it clear that our work is of the greatest importance and purpose. But she acknowledged that the statistics also show that the “we still have much work to do.” She thanked the Rotary Club for its support.\n\nRotary International was established in 1922 as an association of civic -minded professional people who use their resources support community organizations like Boys and Girls Club. The name “rotary” is said to have come out of the practice of rotating meeting locations. Past Rotary Club members have included prominent people such as Thomas Edison, Sir Winston Churchill, former presidents George W Bush and Jimmy Carter and James Cash Penny, founder of J.C. Penney Stores.\n\nLeading Americans who benefited from being in the Boys and Girls Club include: Denzell Washington, Jennifer Lopez, Usher and Shaquille O’ Neal.\n\nReprinted with permission of Real Views"
