All I can hope for is that they come out swinging and show they belong on the national stage. 20-0 until we’re not. roar13 | 18:48 EDT Giants My stomach is in knots. It's already been a crazy day of NFL football. You gotta love week 1. lovemygmen | 18:53 EDT Giants Dear Zeus… it’s me again. Please don’t let our offensive line get abused. roar13 | 19:18 EDT Giants It's time to put this league on notice!!!! I feel a Danny statement game coming in 5....4....3....2....1 BigBlueBallaz | 20:04 EDT Giants It would be really fun if the Giants announce themselves as a legit threat in the division this year by smacking Dallas in the mouth in Week 1. ClutchPass | 20:08 EDT Steelers I nominate Daniel Jones as the most overpaid player in the NFL. Let's see if he backs me up tonight. oldiowasteel | 20:15 EDT KICKOFF Giants Nobody is talking about us ... they will be tomorrow tho! AL_Joe.NY | 20:25 EDT Giants Parsons is a demon LegionofBlue14 | 20:27 EDT Giants Holy crap... Is it me or is our offense simply DICTATING to Dallas here? ClutchPass | 20:28 EDT Giants Jones is killing them EvergladesUgly | 20:29 EDT Giants Ok time to get past one of the final bosses: red zone offense. selftitled85 | 20:30 EDT Giants Good run Jones..... phatdaddy44 | 20:32 EDT Giants Jones is running for his life. These aren’t planned runs. Moon Bars | 20:33 EDT (8:14) NYG field goal is BLOCKED, RECOVERED by DAL, N.Igbinoghene for 58 yards, TOUCHDOWN.\n\nDAL 6 - NYG 0 Giants What a disaster Brady's Bane | 20:34 EDT Giants UNREAL!! sexyscottish | 20:34 EDT Giants And then OMG. A 10 point swing. Inexcusable Treeamigo | 20:34 EDT Giants And what a bizarre momentum shift there. Bad luck, but whatevs. We just have to come right back. ClutchPass | 20:35 EDT Giants Nothing freaking changes with team. Goodnight! Moon Bars | 20:35 EDT Jets Daniel Jones took like four hits already. He’ll never stay healthy doing what he does. razmataaz | 20:35 EDT Eagles Play the wah wah trombones MustbeaVulcan | 20:35 EDT Giants At least we’re keeping Dak off the field Rocketsci1 | 20:36 EDT Giants We still gonna punish these clowns BigBlueBallaz | 20:36 EDT Giants At least their defense will have to come right back out onto the field so we can keep tiring them out. sexyscottish | 20:36 EDT Giants The 6pts off this drive will be something you look back on in the 4qtr when you are chasing points LegionofBlue14 | 20:36 EDT (7:54) (Shotgun) D.Jones sacked at NYG 15 for -10 yards (M.Parsons) Giants My goodness this blocking SUCKS right now. Do0msday | 20:39 EDT NYG punts Giants Dallas defense has insane speed. This looks exactly like last year game one. roar13 | 20:40 EDT Giants Giants are starting to look overmatched. Wayward_Son | 20:40 EDT Giants Pass blocking on a scale 0-10: -2 Sheldor6086 | 20:40 EDT Giants OMG Micah is becoming LTish. dg27 | 20:40 EDT Eagles Dak does not scare me. The Cowboys defense does. kabphillie | 20:40 EDT Giants The projected starting oline plays full qtrs next preseason. LegionofBlue14 | 20:41 EDT Eagles Giants drive brilliantly all the way down the field and finish the drive with a Dallas Cowboys TD. Sad. kknight5282 | 20:41 EDT Eagles Parsons is a beast Joey0210 | 20:41 EDT Giants Best dline in the NFL, it's going to be tough but our Oline will get better as the season progresses. EdwardMonix | 20:42 EDT Jets I’m worried about Rodgers against Parsons with this oline. The Giants have a much better OL than we do. joeb10361877 | 20:42 EDT 49ers Very early prediction but I think it’s between us and Dallas for the No. 1 seed. ninersSB6 | 20:42 EDT 49ers I've been higher on Dallas the last two years than most. I expect to see them in the NFCCG and not Philly. bignerd | 20:42 EDT Giants Parsons just whisked that double team off to the side like they didn't exist. danielhart64 | 20:43 EDT Giants Settle down Giant faithul...the game is 60 minutes BluSwarm | 20:43 EDT Giants I hate the Cowboys so much, I’m seethin! RussellStringerBell | 20:44 EDT Giants We do not look good at all Giantstep | 20:45 EDT Giants Game is going to be over by the end of the quarter. This team isn’t even close to Dallas. roar13 | 20:45 EDT Giants The Eagles are going to massacre us again. LegionofBlue14 | 20:46 EDT Giants Wow, it feels like they have us on the ropes. ClutchPass | 20:48 EDT Giants If only we could play Washington 16 times a year..... sexyscottish | 20:48 EDT Giants This game is far from over. Metalgarn | 20:48 EDT Jets Micah Parsons is the best defensive player in football IMO J-Cubed | 20:49 EDT (3:24) B.Aubrey 21 yard field goal is GOOD\n\nDAL 9 - NYG 0 Giants Look, as bad as we look, it's just 9 points and Eagles looked very beatable today against NE. Giantstep | 20:50 EDT Giants Who isn't blocking Parsons this series? Fran10 | 20:50 EDT Jets Leaving CeeDee uncovered is a bold strategy NYJ1127 | 20:50 EDT (3:21) D.Jones sacked at NYG 16 for -9 yards (D.Lawrence). Giants Line is atrocious right now. Trey1254 | 20:53 EDT Giants The Dallas D-line is special. That much is obvious. NorCalBlue | 20:54 EDT Giants They're running right past the blockers... hp b | 20:54 EDT Steelers Week 1 doesn’t count. Except that it does. FearTheBeard5559 | 20:54 EDT Giants Dallas D Line is just absurd. ToadLicker | 20:55 EDT Giants We waited all year for this. Do0msday | 20:55 EDT \" (2:30) D.Jones INTERCEPTED by D.Bland, D.Bland for 22 yards, TOUCHDOWN\n\nDAL 16 - NYG 0 Giants This is a nightmarish start. LegionofBlue14 | 20:55 EDT Giants LOL!! shankapotamus | 20:55 EDT Giants Of course I am playing against the Dallas D in fantasy. selftitled85 | 20:55 EDT Eagles Giants are pretenders, story at 11. DarkSide830 | 20:55 EDT Giants Can we possibly play any worse?? Dahema | 20:56 EDT Sadly. I think the answer is yes. Ughagain | 20:56 EDT Giants This is really not what I expected. I thought we were gonna blow Dallas out. Real talk AL_Joe.NY | 20:56 EDT Bills Yeah. See? That’s why I was worried the G-men couldn’t make this game interesting. podunkowego | 20:56 EDT Team with no name Gonna be a much uglier opener for the NYG than it was for Wash... by alot. BillyBigBeer | 20:56 EDT Giants Who is coming out in the draft. Let’s start the mocks. Moon Bars | 20:57 EDT Giants Still plenty of time left for us to give up more points Giantknickmets | 20:58 EDT 49ers I hate the Cowboys, but it's hard not to laugh at the Giants. marktastic86 | 20:58 EDT Giants Wow. All off season to become the 2021 or 2020 team again? paulnewton | 20:59 EDT Giants This team is playing so bad. I hope they didn't go on some sort of boat trip before this game. Do0msday | 20:59 EDT Giants We may have to restart all over again. This game is showing us we aren't prepared and we have a MASSIVE talent deficit jerseynetz | 20:59 EDT According to BBV we are clearly better than the Cowboys in terms of talent on offense and defense. And especially coaching. Treeamigo | 21:10 EDT Giants We score on this drive, and I’ll have hope. MrBenks | 21:00 EDT NYG punts Giants This better be some diabolical plan lure the Cowboys into being overconfident, then come back at the end... Scepter | 21:21 EDT Giants 3rd and 2, a designed QB sweep? Seriously? Fran10 | 21:21 EDT Giants It’s not even 9pm in week 1 and we’re running designed qb runs on 3rd and short because we can’t block???? Bkrol4 | 21:21 EDT Giants Our defense might still be good, haven't really seen them much yet Giantknickmets | 21:02 EDT There's the jinx LegionofBlue14 | 21:02 EDT Giants Hope Jones has a good life insurance policy behind that pop Warner line Tea With Miss McGill | 21:02 EDT Giants Never saw this coming. Still early. But never saw this coming AL_Joe.NY | 21:04 EDT Giants This looks inept, like Joe Judge-Dave Gettleman level inept. Wayward_Son | 21:05 EDT Second Quarter Giants Are we typically low on fan attendance in MetLife? Never been to a live game before but it seems like Dallas got some serious presence RussellStringerBell | 21:06 EDT Giants Everyone needs to relax, it's early. Let's see if the coaching can out coach McCarthy Ravenfire | 21:06 EDT Giants I'm so tired of the Cowboys making us look like a High School Team Doctor Al | 21:06 EDT Giants I cannot stand defenders hitting someone and then boasting and celebrating. You let up a first down. You look like a damn clown. Do0msday | 21:09 EDT Giants WTH is Hawkins celebrating? They got a first down jerseynetz | 21:10 EDT (11:00) B.Aubrey 38 yard field goal is GOOD\n\nDAL 19 - NYG 0 Giants Anyone else tired of opening with the Cowboys? Brady's Bane | 21:12 EDT Giants No panic...give them 3, score a td and we're right back in it BigBlueBallaz | 21:12 EDT Giants Damn he can kick Giantknickmets | 21:12 EDT Giants Will Jones get one clean pocket the entire game? Gintdiehard | 21:14 EDT Giants Every year, on national TV, we get embarrassed by the Cowboys. Twice. Daitong | 21:15 EDT (10:55) D.Jones INTERCEPTED by S.Gilmore Giants Even in my nightmares, it wasn’t this freking bad Ughagain | 21:17 EDT Giants You’ve got to be kidding me DeacNJ1 | 21:17 EDT Giants LOL a TD!??! Yall are absolutely crazy jerseynetz | 21:17 EDT Giants Annnnnd there it is.. hp b | 21:17 EDT Giants Ok back to doing my laundry... Scepter | 21:17 EDT Giants This team is a joke TraumaHawk94 | 21:17 EDT Jets Danny Dimes might get into positive posting yards before halftime... maybe Rampantjet22 | 21:17 EDT Giants We could have had Micah Parsons...I'd take him anyday over Darren Waller and Aaron Robinson TraumaHawk94 | 21:19 EDT That Brandin Cooks trade was beautiful no gonna lie. Begiant | 21:19 EDT And the Gilmore trade…. ToadLicker | 21:20 EDT Bills Giants and their overpaid QB stink. Daboll going from coach of the year to the toilet bowl. BuffaloBS2022 | 21:19 EDT Giants Dallas' D has been so opportunistic tonight. They're playing lights out, making every big play they can. It's crazy. ClutchPass | 21:20 EDT They’re the best D in football ToadLicker | 21:20 EDT Giants Good night everyone!! I'll be in to dump on the team tomorrow smfh they are trash trash trash BigBlueBallaz | 21:22 EDT Steelers We weren’t this bad Yinzer. | 21:22 EDT Steelers At this point in our game we had -3 yards of offense and 3 punts. Toronto Steeler Fan | 21:22 EDT Steelers We were only down by 20 though Yinzer. | 21:24 EDT (8:07) T.Pollard right end for 2 yards, TOUCHDOWN.\n\nDAL 26 - NYG 0 Giants I think I’m gonna move to South America and herd Llamas. Somewhere without TV reception or internet connections. Get back to the land, you know? Century Milstead | 21:23 EDT Giants There is no way you can argue anything but McCarthy 100% outcoaching the Giants. This was literally what he said he was going to do when he fired Kellen Moore. He said he was going to do exactly this. Begiant | 21:23 EDT Giants I couldn’t have dreamed up a worse start to the season. Utterly disgusting. DeacNJ1 | 21:23 EDT Eagles Giants on pace for -57 net yards passing . I hate when Cowboys have any measure of success, but this is just too funny. fareastfan | 21:24 EDT Giants Thibideux and Neal are both busts. Maybe our GM isn’t so smart after all. These are 5th and 7th overall picks respectively. And they are both undeserving of even a second day pick. Moon Bars | 21:25 EDT Giants I get that everyone is due for an ass whoopin every once in a while, but damn, first game of the season? Ascherr82 | 21:25 EDT Chiefs Dallas defense is really good. If Dak get his things together they might be better than Philly this season Mcmanam | 21:25 EDT Eagles I hope that the Giants are just that bad, if not, that Dallas defense looks scary good. Parsons in beast mode already. Nectir | 21:25 EDT Giants Not even with Ben Mcadoo and Pat Shurmur did I see this clown show. DarkSideBlue | 21:26 EDT Giants They have to get the ball out in 1.5 seconds Fran10 | 21:28 EDT Giants So they putting in the backups already no wonder we moving the ball Giantstep | 21:29 EDT Giants Cowboys are already resting starters lol Polsdofer | 21:29 EDT Giants Say what u want about the OL. But Jones is rattled and looks horrible ToadLicker | 21:30 EDT Lol. For running for his life. There are 2-3 pass rushers in his face before he can plant his foot on drop back Ughagain | 21:30 EDT Giants Every single dropback is a pressure situation. Fran10 | 21:31 EDT The Communards Look like Dallas may be good this year…Giants DL is pretty good WashNDUNC | 21:31 EDT Giants Remember....we turned our back on a HOF QB and not only wasted the SIXTH pick in the draft on this freaking bum but we gave him 40 million because of his \"best season\" of 15 TD passes in 16 games. sexyscottish | 21:32 EDT Giants I know it's against the law to criticize Jones but maybe, just maybe, it would have been a good idea to get a QB you could describe with better than \"Probably okay, I guess\". Bellomy150 | 21:32 EDT Giants Getting laughed out of our own building. Again. Danny Dimes | 21:33 EDT Giants They are preparing the participation trophies for the Giants players for after the game. Moon Bars | 21:34 EDT Giants Did the cowboys really just pull Parsons to rest him towards the half -- against these Giants?! LOL ugh...this is laughable NYJG | 21:34 EDT Two Minute Warning Giants After all the \"improvements\" This offense actually looks worse than it did last year. Doctor Al | 21:36 EDT Giants Commercials are better than the game, so there's that. BubbaSatori | 21:36 EDT Giants I hope the NFL really starts to investigate why they put a crime show on prime time TV. GiantBeing | 21:37 EDT (2:00) D.Jones sacked at DAL 19 for -5 yards (D.Armstrong). Giants Evan Neal just got manhandled by *checks notes* DORANCE ARMSTRONG?? TraumaHawk94 | 21:38 EDT Giants Armstrong has beat both tackles. He is a backup footballbizzybody1 | 21:38 EDT Giants Least we'll get 3 AL_Joe.NY | 21:40 EDT (1:10) NYG field goal is No Good Giants Honestly, just invoke the mercy rule and cancel the game TraumaHawk94 | 21:41 EDT Giants Okay, I yield, we aren't winning this game. Metalgarn | 21:41 EDT Giants Brian Daboll might have an aneurysm before this game ends. Century Milstead | 21:42 EDT Might be a group event Blues | 21:42 EDT Jets Giants look like dog excrement. Huge Jets Fan | 21:42 EDT Giants The Eagles are gonna look past us. To like, three seasons from now… Realist-Optimist | 21:43 EDT Giants Jones is getting pressured nearly 70% of dropbacks....why is it so hard for us to find offensive lineman whereas the Cowboys get all pro after all pro.....ugh Ravenfire | 21:44 EDT The Commodores Our O-line will not hold up to Dallas' front 7 FanInKY | 21:46 EDT DAL punts Giants DJ a 12.2 rating. That has to be an NFL record Doctor Al | 21:47 EDT Giants Finally forced a punt GiantIrishFB | 21:47 EDT Giants Team just looks so slow compared to Dallas. Fran10 | 21:47 EDT Jets Merciless boos incoming for big blue Perpetual.Disappointment | 21:48 EDT Giants The Cowboys know the Giants are a soft and mentally weak team and the Giants know it too. Begiant | 21:50 EDT Giants Maybe I’ll take up needlepoint. I’ve always admired needlepoint. Century Milstead | 21:50 EDT Giants Even with blocking Jones is terrible. sexyscottish | 21:51 EDT (:37) (Shotgun) D.Jones sacked at NYG 22 for -7 yards (O.Odighizuwa) Giants That sack is on Jones. Get rid of the ball bro Begiant | 21:52 EDT Giants 0 completions to a WR. $40 million well spent GiantIrishFB | 21:52 EDT Giants Boos are raining down from the stands shankapotamus | 21:52 EDT End Of Half Giants That commercial just told me that 80% of NFL players choose the Sleep Number bed. The other 20% must play for the Giants. rocketcoe | 21:53 EDT Giants The Jones defenders are really out in full force. It’s apparently everyone else’s fault but his. Blame the janitors while you’re at it. Griddy313 | 21:58 EDT Did you see the bathrooms?! Talk about an offense Knightof11 | 22:00 EDT Giants DANIEL JONES, GET READY TO LEARN CHINESE BUDDY JerryReesesPieces | 22:00 EDT Giants In the OL’s defense, not everyone likes touching other men who are running at them. rocketcoe | 22:22 EDT Giants The Cowboys have an UDFA at RT who is wildly outplaying our top 10 pick at RT. blusky4days | 22:22 EDT Giants Who knew our week 2 game vs the lowly Cardinals would be the \"tank for Caleb\" game?? sexyscottish | 22:03 EDT Giants I like the Giants’ commitment to the old 16-game season, but the fans thought this was Week 1. rocketcoe | 22:03 EDT Giants It is all made worse by the number of Cowboy fans. Season ticket holders should be ashamed JurisDoctor81 | 22:05 EDT The Commandos Soooo glad we don't see Dallas until Thanksgiving. gusbus9000 | 22:06 EDT Third Quarter Giants For the sake of consistency, let’s give up an 80-yard TD drive here. rocketcoe | 22:07 EDT Giants Look at what a good O-line does JudgeIsMyFavoriteOgre | 22:08 EDT Pollard untouched for 20 yards. That play looked like a scrimmage play. blusky4days | 22:09 EDT It was so well blocked JudgeIsMyFavoriteOgre | 22:09 EDT Giants @Ed, don’t even write an article about this game tomorrow. Take the day off, fans will be here commenting anyway. You can’t write anything that’ll truly sum up WTF happened. Deliguy | 22:11 EDT Jets Recovered that too, lol. Boy, Miami and the Cowboys are going to be trouble for us. razmataaz | 22:11 EDT Giants There were people here who were convinced that Jones>>>>Dak BrooklynBlue | 22:12 EDT Giants Cowboys O-line moves like elephants, our O-line are hamsters. LegionofBlue14 | 22:12 EDT (10:05) T.Pollard right end for 1 yard, TOUCHDOWN.\n\nDAL 33 - NYG 0 Giants Way to come out and play for pride. DeacNJ1 | 22:12 EDT Giants Absolutely dominated IronGiant18 | 22:12 EDT Giants I actually convinced myself we were going to win this game. I legitimately believed that. Century Milstead | 22:13 EDT Steelers Biadasz is a free agent at the end of this year. He will only be 26 years old. And the Steelers should absolutely target him. Steel34Defense | 22:13 EDT Eagles The NY Giants should just burn the film of this game after it's over. A Graham Short | 22:13 EDT Giants Defense is putting the Cowboys kicker under a lot of pressure making him kick all this XPs. This will wear him out of the course of the season.\n\nChess not checkers. rocketcoe | 22:14 EDT Giants Maybe the Cowboys are just the best team in the league Giantknickmets | 22:14 EDT Giants Thibs can't even hold the shoe of Parsons.
