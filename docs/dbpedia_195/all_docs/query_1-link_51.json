        "text": "Head Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nThe Roster\n\nCode:\n\nDetmer, Koy 15 QB 3 24 41 7 yrs McNabb, Donovan 11 QB QB 1 16 64 7 yrs Pederson, Doug 13 QB 7 27 27 1 yr.\n\nThe thing about Detmer's 7 year contract? None of it's in bonus money, so he'll get cut, probably as soon as this season, because he's making way too much dough. Pederson's also the better looking backup. What worries me is that we have no mentor for Donovan, so that's going to be our first order of business.\n\nLuckily, there's one veteran QB in the free agent pool and he's a mentor, so say hello to Mark Rypien, our new 21/21 QB mentor for Donovan McNabb. Seems hilarious to have a former Redskin mentoring the Eagles franchise QB. Koy Detmer gets cut immediately. He'll make a solid #2 QB for some teams and who knows? Maybe he'll grow into a starting role someday. But for now, our QB situation is set for this next year: McNabb the starter, Pederson the backup, Rypien #3. I like that I've got two guys on one year deals as well, since it'll allow me the opportunity to get my own guys next year.\n\nCode:\n\nBieniemy, Eric 26 RB 9 38 38 1 yr. Staley, Duce 36 RB RB 3 34 44 5 yrs Watson, Edwin 21 RB 2 16 27 1 yr. ##Bostic, James 23 FB 6 28 28 1 yr. ##Martin, Cecil 24 FB 1 17 37 4 yrs Turner, Kevin 28 FB FB 8 54 54 1 yr.\n\nOur RB situation's looking a little weak, I'm afraid. I remember Duce being pretty decent, but ideally I'd like him to be a #2 and receiving back, not our featured runner. Bieniemy's a terrific power runner and special teams guy, but he won't be back next year. Turner's the FB and Martin's our FB of the future... if he develops. If he doesn't, I'll just cut him. I also sign RB Darnell Autry (22/27) off the street. He played for the Eagles in 2000, but that's not why I signed him. I signed him because I loved watching him play at Northwestern and we frankly could use some more depth.\n\nCode:\n\n##Broughton, Luther 84 TE 3 21 30 2 yrs Dunn, Jason 81 TE TE 4 39 50 1 yr.

Sadly, T.O.'s playing opposite Jerry Rice in San Francisco and is 73/73, so good luck getting him. Because our WR situation is so poor, I'm going to start Weaver at TE and have Dunn as the strong-blocker backup. Johnson's a Red Flag player, which will be interesting as I've never had one of those before. None of these guys excite me and I'll be making wholesale changes ASAP. In fact, since we've got 60 players, let's go ahead and cut Na Brown's no bonus, no talent ass right now. Nothing exciting out there in the unemployment line either.\n\nCode:\n\nDellenbach, Jeff 59 C 15 53 53 1 yr. Everett, Steve 56 C C 7 57 57 1 yr.

Everett is a run-blocking beast, so I switch him to RG, where he drops to 36/50. Not as bad a hit as I thought he'd take and he's still infinitely better than Mayberry. Brzezinki has far more upside than Diaz-Infante and D-I has a conflict with Dellenbach, our O-line captain, so they switch spots on inactive/active. Schau gets cut and that's when I execute my first trade.\n\nTaylor, 6th Rounder to Jacksonville for Searcy, 4th Rounder\n\nCB Bobby Taylor takes his game to the Jaguars\n\nBig man T Leon Searcy will start for the Eagles\n\nNew Philadelphia Eagles GM Izulde Jestor executed a stunning trade today, sending 5th year CB Bobby Taylor and the team's 2000 6th round draft pick to the Jacksonville Jaguars for 8th year RT Leon Searcy and the Jaguars' 2000 4th round pick. Searcy then signed a new contract that will keep him in Philadelphia through the 2000 season.\n\n\"We just felt like it was a move we had to make\", Jestor said. \"We weren't happy with our right tackle situation and we have a star rookie quarterback to protect in Donovan McNabb. Leon gives us a big, experienced, balanced tackle who will start on the right side for the next two years. We also get move up two rounds in next year's draft, where we can get ourselves a better shot at a steal.\"\n\nTaylor, known as one of the best zone defenders and kickoff returners in the game, immediately becomes the Jaguars' #1 CB. Dealing him will cost the Eagles a significant amount of dead money and they now have $2.74 million in lost cap space next season, although they appear to have more than enough money to absorb it. According to Eagles insiders, Jestor was not impressed with Taylor's inability to create interceptions or deliver hard hits.\n\nHis departure also means CB Al Harris, a hard-hitting third year player, will get his chance to start opposite star CB Troy Vincent and get much-needed development time.\n\n***End Article***\n\nOkay, so that's our RT spot out of the way and we have a Thomas-Wellbourn-Dellenbach-Everett-Searcy offensive line. Not the best in the league, obviously, but a lot better than what we started with.\n\nCode:\n\nLandeta, Sean 3 P 15 51 51 5 yrs Akers, David 1 K 1 38 85 7 yrs Johnson, Norm 6 K 18 33 33 1 yr.\n\nLandeta and Akers, obviously.

I'll try him as a starter in preseason and see how it goes. Overall, not much to choose from here. Lot of prime opportunity for cuts. I eat a lot of dead cap space and am up to almost $4 million in dead cap next year by the end of these slices. So what? The cap's $78.4 million.

S Brian Dawkins has 2 interceptions, CB Troy Vincent picks up 2 pass defenses and SLB William Thomas gets 1.5 sacks, a pass defense and an INT.\n\n.....\n\nQB Donovan McNabb has Knee Tendinitis and is Questionable for 5 weeks.\n\nWell... that's just flipping great. The guy this whole dynasty's about and he gets hurt his very first game. Needless to say, he's staying out until he's fully healed.\n\nCarolina 24 Philadelphia 10\n\nThe whole team played like crap, basically, although QB Doug Pederson has looked awesome so far. 181 yards and 2 TDs with 0 picks in Week 1 and in this game, he's 5/6 for 55 yards before letting Mark Rypien have some time. Might be a good thing, no?\n\nQB Donovan McNabb is back up to Probable, but I'm not risking him being lost for the year.\n\nPhiladelphia 24 New England 17\n\nHome cooking continues to taste sour for everyone. 7 tackles, 1.5 sacks, 3 hurries and a knockdown for SLB William Thomas. He looking good in preseason.\n\nNew York Jets 17 Philadelphia 41\n\nWay to pour it on in the preseason finale, guys! ILB James Darling returns a pick 25 yards for a TD, CB Troy Vincent has a 69 yard punt return for a TD, plus an INT and a sack. S Brian Dawkins picks up 3 pass defenses but the real story is SLB William Thomas, who has 2 interceptions, a sack, and a pass defense. This guy is just straight up ON FIRE!\n\nRegular Season\n\nQB Donovan McNabb is still Probable and isn't due back for a few weeks. QB Doug Pederson looked really good in preseason, probably good enough to start so we don't risk losing McNabb for the year, so we'll go with that. We're projected to finish last in the NFC East anyway.\n\nSt. Louis 20 Philadelphia 13\n\nNot a bad outing at all by Doug Pederson, who was 24/38 for 244 yards with an INT. The only problem is that pick was returned 95 yards by Mike Jones for what was the differencemaker in this game. SILB Mike Caldwell tore it up with 11 tackles, an assist and a pass defense and CB Al Harris had a good first game with 2 pass defenses and a forced fumble, but it wasn't good enough.\n\nRT Leon Searcy sprains his knee and is Questionable and FB Cecil Martin also is Questionable, but with shin splits. Play on, boys, play on.\n\nPhiladelphia 18 Dallas 31\n\nNothing playing NFL royalty to start the season. Sheesh! Good presence by DE Hugh Douglas with 3 tackles, 4 assists, a sack, and 4 hurries, but Aikman, Smith & Co. owned us by an even bigger margin than the score indicates.\n\nPittsburgh 13 Philadelphia 9\n\nUnbelievable. We can't even beat the Steelers. 12 tackles, 2 assists by SILB Mike Caldwell and S Brian Dawkins is great with 10 tackles, 2 assists, a pass defense and an interception, but QB Doug Pederson loses 2 interceptions and a fumble to send us to a disheartening 0-3.\n\nNow it's time for the Donovan McNabb Show to begin earnest!\n\nPhiladelphia 30 Chicago 10\n\nThe Bears were 3-0, but now they're 3-1 as Donovan McNabb goes 21/30 for 325 yards, a TD and an INT in his first NFL start. Player of the Game goes to WR Torrance Small, who attracts instant chemistry with McNabb, catching 8 passes for 166 yards and a TD. S Tim Hauck highlighted the defense with 2 pass defenses. Nice way to enter the NFL, McNabb!\n\nWashington 13 Philadelphia 23\n\nMcNabb's first Monday night game of his career and what does he do? 23/33 for 252 yards, a TD and INT as Player of the Game en route to going 2-0 as a starter. Wow! S Tim Hauck has another 2 pass defenses and he's joined by SLB William Thomas in that number and category. Solid all-around game, although our run game remains very weak.\n\nPhiladelphia 27 San Francisco 17\n\nFor the second time this season, we take down an undefeated team, ruining the 5-0 49ers hopes of besting a certain 1972 squad. RB Duce Staley rips off a 67 yard TD run on his way to our first 100+ rushing game of the year, 23 carries for 116 yards and a TD. But it's Donovan McNabb who wins Player of the Game again - 21/26 for 237 yards and 2 TDs. Looking a lot more polished than 16/64, that's for sure. I guess those weeks off with injury allowed him to prepare mentally with Mark Rypien. WR Charles Johnson catches 4 balls for 108 yards and a TD as the main beneficiary.\n\nAtlanta 21 Philadelphia 24\n\nWe were down 21-0 at the half before QB Doug Pederson took over and went 19/26 for 255 yards, 2 TDs and 2 INTs, winning Player of the Game for leading the comeback. WR Torrance Smalls had 5 catches for 130 yards and a TD and SILB Mike Caldwell rang up 10 tackles, 6 assists and a half-sack. We move to over .500 for the first time this season, despite Donovan McNabb going 4/11 before being replaced by Pederson.\n\nPhiladelphia 34 Seattle 29\n\nThis one was a wild back and forth affair, but Donovan McNabb atoned for his poor outing against the Falcons with 188 yards and 2 TDs on 16/24 passing. He also had a 4 yard rushing TD, his first NFL score on the ground. Great game by our RBs today. RB Eric Bieniemy had 96 yards on just 9 carries, while Duce Staley ground out 76 yards on 22 attempts.\n\nWe'll take a look at the tale of the tape tomorrow, but right now we're 5-3, in second place in the NFC East behind 6-3 Dallas. If the playoffs happened today, we'd make it.\n\nBut the triumph over the Seahawks didn't come without cost. DE Hugh Douglas separated his shoulder and is Out an estimated 5 weeks.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nPerfect in Philadelphia: McNabb 5-0 In Rookie Season\n\nEarly season knee tendinitis hasn't affect rookie QB Donovan McNabb's play\n\nConventional NFL wisdom says that you don't start your rookie quarterback right away. The Philadelphia Eagles followed convention, but not entirely intentionally, as first round pick Donovan McNabb developed knee tendinitis during the team's second preseason game. Although McNabb could've come back after missing one week, the Eagles' coaching staff decide to keep him out until he was fully healthy.\n\nAnd after McNabb led the Eagles from 0-3 to a 5-3 mark and playoff positioning halfway through the season, it appears to have been the right. Other than a short-lived outing against the Atlanta Falcons, the rookie's been on form in five starts. Through Philadelphia's 34-29 victory over the Seahawks, McNabb's thrown for 1,043 yards and 6 touchdowns to 2 interceptions. He also boasts an impressive 68.8% completion rate, good for 5th in the league.\n\nIt hasn't taken long for WR Torrance Small to develop a rapport with McNabb\n\nWide receiver was one of Philadelphia's biggest concerns heading into this season, but WR Torrance Small has been quick to bond with McNabb and QB Doug Pederson. He's on pace for a 1,000 yard receiving season with 35 catches for 626 yards and 5 TDs at the halfway point.\n\nSILB Mike Caldwell has been playing much bigger than this tiny picture of him\n\nThe Eagles' defense hasn't been the most stellar by the numbers, except for the following stat: They rank #1 in stopping opponents on third down, allowing just 28.8% of third downs to be converted. A big reason for Philadelphia's success is SILB Mike Caldwell, on pace for a 100 tackle with 65 tackles, 20 assists, a half-sack and 2 pass defenses to his credit thus far.\n\nBut it's FS Brian Dawkins who's arguably been the best player on defense, accumulating 40 tackles, 13 assists, 3 interceptions and 5 pass defenses for an 83.5% pass defense in the first half of the season.\n\nCode:\n\nFront Office Football 2007 1999 Summary for Philadelphia Eagles Philadelphia Eagles Team Rank Rushes per Game 24.8 23 Rushing Yards 97.5 23 Yards Per Carry 3.94 20 Pass Attempts 34.1 20 Completions 21.9 17 Completion Pct. 64.1 9 Passing Yards 253.4 7 Yards Per Attempt 7.42 4 Yards Per Catch 11.58 5 Total Yardage Gained 335.1 11 3rd Down Conversions 35.2 23 Points Per Game 22.3 10 (T) Pass Rush Pct. 21.5 14 Pass Defense Pct. 43.1 24 Turnovers 11 9 (T) Turnover Margin 0 16 (T) Opponents Team Rank Rushes per Game 26.9 16 Rushing Yards 121.8 25 Yards Per Carry 4.53 31 Pass Attempts 35.6 15 Completions 22.5 25 Completion Pct. 63.2 20 Passing Yards 244.8 24 Yards Per Attempt 6.87 21 Yards Per Catch 10.88 21 Total Yardage Gained 354.5 28 3rd Down Conversions 28.8 1 Points Per Game 19.3 16 Pass Rush Pct. 20.5 16 (T) Pass Defense Pct. 46.5 16 Turnovers 11 26 (T) Week Team Versus Oppnt 1 13 STL 20 2 18 at DAL 31 3 9 PIT 13 4 30 at CHI 10 5 23 WAS 13 6 27 at SFO 17 8 24 ATL 21 9 34 at SEA 29 Passing Pos Att Comp Yards Y/Att TD Int Rate 11 D.

Wheeler DT 17 9 1.0 5 0 1 81.4\n\nAs we look ahead to the second half of the season, the biggest question will be how the Eagles deal with the loss of DE Hugh Douglas, who will miss at least one game, if not more, a separated shoulder.\n\nThe offensive line has been performing reasonably well together as a unit, but LT Tra Thomas could surrender double-digit sacks by the end of the season and has converted just 3/30 of key run block attempts. The best lineman has been, interestingly enough, RT Leon Searcy, with 9 key run blocks in 23 opportunities (39.1%) and 3 sacks surrendered. Clearly it seems that GM Izulde Jestor knew what he was doing when he made the deal.\n\nK David Akers is having an excellent season, with 17/19 FG attempts, including 9/10 from 40+ range and 3/4 from 50+ yards out. He's also a perfect 17/17 in extra points and projects as the Eagles' kicker for a long, long time to come.\n\n***End Article***\n\nSo yeah, losing Douglas sucks, but at least it's not for the whole year. I really don't like our lack of pass rush and to be honest, I prefer the 4-3, though the 3-4's been interesting. TE Luther Broughton gets his walking papers and an ancient DE Trace Armstrong, who has an added bonus of being a Mentor. He takes over for Douglas as the starting LDE, because I don't trust DE Greg Jefferson to be any good.\n\nNew York Giants 24 Philadelphia 27 (OT)\n\nDonovan McNabb is fast building up legendary status. He executes a late fourth quarter drive and hits reserve WR Brian Finneran from 14 yards out with 1:05 left in regulation to tie it up at 24. Then K David Akers blasts a 30 yard field goal in OT to preserve McNabb's unbeaten streak to start his career.\n\nI'll let McNabb's line speak for itself:\n\nPassing: 28/45, 311 yards, TD\n\nRushing: 12 rushes for 75 yards, TD\n\nThat's right. Donovan McNabb combined for 386 yards of offense... BY HIMSELF.\n\nAnd in anti-climatic news, FS Brian Dawkins and SILB Mike Caldwell had 2 pass defenses a piece.\n\nPhiladelphia 7 Cincinnati 14\n\nDonovan's 6-0 start ends here. Crazy game. The only scores in this game were on 35+ yard plays and two of them were on interception returns.\n\n8:52 1st qtr: Rodney Heath 67 yard INT return (Cin: 7-0)\n\n13:08 3rd qtr: CB Troy Vincent 79 yard INT return (7-7 tie)\n\n1:46 3rd qtr: QB Jeff Blake 35 yard pass to WR Carl Pickens (Cin: 14-7)\n\nIt was the first truly bad game of McNabb's career: 25/43 for 174 yards and 2 interceptions. Bengals RB Corey Dillon rushed 20 times for 112 yards to take home Player of the Game, but it could've just as easily gone to our rookie CB Al Harris, who had 3 interceptions!. Wow!\n\nWe're now 6-4, tied with the Dallas Cowboys for the NFC East and with the Atlanta Falcons for the top NFC wildcard.\n\nIt's looking a season that'll go down to the wire.\n\nOh, and the Packers are 10-0. Boo.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nPhiladelphia 14 Baltimore 24\n\nDespite a 26/39 for 305 yards, 2 TD, 2 INT outing from Donovan McNabb, we lose this one as RB Priest Holmes runs us over for 109 yards and a TD. Way to spoil WR Charles Johnson's 6 catches for 102 yards and a TD and our first multi-sack of the year game. NT Mark Wheeler picked up 4 tackles, 2 assists, and 1.5 sacks and SILB Mike Caldwell grabbed 8 tackles, 3 assists and 2 pass defenses. We're now on a two game skid.\n\nDE Hugh Douglas is back to Probable and I can't get him back in the lineup fast enough.\n\nArizona 17 Philadelphia 10\n\nTime of possession killed us in this game: 41:46 for Arizona, 18:14 for us. SLB William Thomas racked up 14 tackles and 2 assists as a result of it, but we just could not get it going this game. Terrible, just terrible.\n\nPhiladelphia 13 New York Giants 37\n\nA must-win game against the Giants and they kill us. Our losing streak is now at 4. We got schooled in every single aspect of the game and what was once a promising season has now evaporated as we're 6-7 and headed to a mediocre finish.\n\nCleveland 3 Philadelphia 27\n\nWe finally stop the bleeding as Donovan McNabb is 18/27 for 279 yards and 2 TDs through the air and goes for 300+ multipurpose yards with 8 carries for 41 yards. WR Torrance Small catches 7 passes for 157 yards and DE Mike Mamula erupts for 5 tackles, 4 assists, 2.5 sacks, a block, a hurry and a knockdown. CB Troy Vincent defends 3 passes and nabs an interception, while S Brian Dawkins has 2 pass defenses of his own.\n\nPhiladelphia 14 Washington 34\n\nAnd just like that, we drop out of all hopes of a playoff appearance at 7-8. RB Skip Hicks batters us for 143 yards and 2 TDs on 26 carries and Donovan McNabb's 361 passing yards and ruined by 3 interceptions and 2 fumbles. WR Torrance Small has 9 catches for 144 yards and the only Eagles defender worth a damn is S Brian Dawkins with 2 pass defenses.\n\nDallas 29 Philadelphia 28\n\nWe lose our chance to play spoiler when QB Troy Aikman unleashes an 87 yard TD pass to Michael Irvin in the fourth quarter. Donovan McNabb was near perfect on a 23/27 for 239 yards and a TD night and he ran 7 times for 41 yards in the bargain. RB Duce Staley broke the century mark with 112 yards and a TD on 12 carries, but we're still going to look for an upgrade in the offseason.\n\nThe real kicker of it all? Both wild card spots went to the NFC East, the second going to 8-8 New York.\n\nI'm so irritated I don't pay much attention as the Giants upset the 49ers 13-10 or when they shock the heavily favored 15-1 Packers 24-21 to set up an All-NFC East NFC Championship with the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nIn fact, it's All-East as the Jets and Bills square off in the AFC Championship.\n\nDallas ends the Giants' miracle run with a 37-21 squashing and the Bills, led by Doug Flutie of all people, beat the Jets 20-13 to set up a Super Bowl of Aikman and Co. vs. Flutie Flakes.\n\nSuper Bowl\n\nIn a game that's nowhere near as close as the score indicates, the Cowboys win 21-20 in a game dominated by defense. DE Alonzo Spellman wins the MVP with 6 tackles, 3 sacks, a hurry and 2 knockdowns. A pretty dull game, if you want to know the truth, but it's always nice to see a defensive MVP for a change.\n\nCode:\n\nFront Office Football 2007 Philadelphia Eagles Team Rank Rushes per Game 24.9 23 Rushing Yards 102.3 20 Yards Per Carry 4.11 10 Pass Attempts 35.6 15 Completions 22.8 12 Completion Pct. 63.9 9 (T) Passing Yards 254.3 10 Yards Per Attempt 7.14 7 Yards Per Catch 11.18 10 Total Yardage Gained 342.0 10 3rd Down Conversions 36.7 23 (T) Points Per Game 19.8 23 Pass Rush Pct. 18.1 25 Pass Defense Pct. 39.0 30 Turnovers 24 10 (T) Turnover Margin -1 17 Opponents Team Rank Rushes per Game 29.2 26 Rushing Yards 127.4 30 Yards Per Carry 4.36 27 Pass Attempts 32.8 6 Completions 21.8 17 Completion Pct. 66.6 29 Passing Yards 244.6 26 Yards Per Attempt 7.47 29 Yards Per Catch 11.21 25 Total Yardage Gained 359.8 31 3rd Down Conversions 40.2 24 Points Per Game 20.9 21 Pass Rush Pct. 17.7 5 Pass Defense Pct. 50.0 14 (T) Turnovers 23 26 (T) Week Team Versus Oppnt 1 13 STL 20 2 18 at DAL 31 3 9 PIT 13 4 30 at CHI 10 5 23 WAS 13 6 27 at SFO 17 8 24 ATL 21 9 34 at SEA 29 10 27 NYK 24 11 7 at CIN 14 12 14 at BAL 24 13 10 ARI 17 14 13 at NYK 37 15 27 CLE 3 16 14 at WAS 34 17 27 DAL 28 Passing Pos Att Comp Yards Y/Att TD Int Rate 11 D.

We definitely need a front-line pass rusher and I'd like to see us be able to switch to a 4-3 next season. There's actually a lot of holes to be filled on this team, but we'll get there eventually.\n\nLT Tra Thomas didn't allow a single sack the entire second half of the season, which is great news. Our offensive line overall played pretty well, all things considered and K David Akers hit 26/29 FGs, 10/12 from 40+ range and 4/5 from 50+ range.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles Season Awards\n\nNone\n\n...What a damned ripoff. McNabb should've won Rookie of the Year and Dawkins should have at least been a second team All-Pro safety. Oh well, bulletin board material for next year, I guess.\n\nSending McNabb to France would be cheating, so I send S Damon Moore instead, in hopes that he'll make a good pairing with Dawkins as a starting safety next season.\n\nFree Agency\n\nThere's none of our RFAs I have any real interest in bringing back, so I'll let them all hit free agency.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nQB x 2, RB, TE x 2, WR x 2, C, G, T, DE, DT, OLB x 2, CB, S\n\nWeek 2 Signings\n\nG Steve Everett - 3 years, $5.21 mil. (Re-signing)\n\n-Did well enough as a starter for us last year, so I'd like to keep the cohesion going.\n\nSLB Quentin Coryatt - 3 years, $5.05 mil. (Dallas Cowboys)\n\n-Injury-prone, but when healthy, he's an All-Pro caliber player who will provide an immediate boost to our defense. I can't wait to see this guy play and I loved watching him in his NFL days.\n\nWeek 3 Signings\n\nCB Deion Sanders - 2 years, $12.83 mil. (Dallas Cowboys)\n\n-We continue to raid the NFC East champions of 1999's defense. I love Prime Time and even though he's old as hell now, he and Coryatt will give our D serious pizzazz, not to mention a stellar returner, something we sorely lacked.\n\nWeek 3 Losses\n\nT Roman Oben - 5 years, $14.21 mil. (New York Giants) (Re-signing)\n\n-I had visions of lining him up at RT, but he spurned a lot of money from other teams to stay with the G-men.\n\nWeek 4 Signings\n\nC Jeff Dellenbach - 2 years, $1.87 mil. (Re-signing)\n\n-I'm intent on keeping my entire offensive line together for at least one more season.\n\nWeek 4 Losses\n\nSLB William Thomas - 2 years, $6.9 mil. (New York Jets)\n\n-Had a pretty solid season for us last year, but he was expendable after we signed Coryatt.\n\nWeek 5 Signings\n\nQB Mark Rypien - 1 year, $630k (Re-signing)\n\n-Brought back strictly to keep mentoring Donovan.\n\nT Earl Dotson - 1 year, $510k (Green Bay Packers)\n\n-He'll fight Leon Searcy for the starting RT spot and the loser will be our backup T for both sides.\n\nWeek 5 Losses\n\nDT Sam Adams - 4 years, $22.79 mil. (Seattle Seahawks) (Re-signing)\n\n-Everyone was throwing a ton of money at Adams, who was far and away the best available player in the entire free agent class. In the end, though, he gave a hometown discount to the Seahawks and elected to stay in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWeek 6 Signings\n\nTE Troy Drayton - 1 year, $550k (Miami Dolphins)\n\n-Nothing special, to be honest, but a lot better than what we had before.\n\nDT Eric Swann - 3 years, $5.42 mil. (Arizona Cardinals)\n\n-Way overpaid for him, but I really want to be able to switch to a 4-3 if I can and Swann, despite being old, is still good enough to be a starter in that kind of scheme.\n\nWeek 7 Losses\n\nDE Greg Jefferson - 1 year, $410k* (Denver Broncos)\n\n-Didn't stand a chance of making our roster next year.\n\nWeek 8 Signings\n\nRB Errict Rhett - 1 year, $410k* (Baltimore Ravens)\n\n-Elusive runner with great hole recognition and blitz pickup. Averaged 4.87 yards a carry last year with only 2 fumbles as the Ravens' #2 back. If we don't find anybody in the draft, he's a strong bet to be our #1 runner next season.\n\nWR Michael Westbrook - 1 year, $540k (Washington Redskins)\n\n-He'll be in the fight for a starting spot. Just hope he doesn't punch any of his teammates. A little too drop-prone for my tastes, but he's another 1,000 yard receiver to pair with Torrance Small.\n\nWeek 8 Losses\n\nNT Mark Wheeler - 1 year, $530k\n\n-Best suited to a 3-4 and I'd like a 4-3 at some point.\n\nWeek 9 Signings\n\nDT Tim Bowens - 1 year, $510k (Miami Dolphins)\n\n-Can't run defend worth a lick, but he's a very, very scary pass-rusher, perfect for our nickel and dime packages if nothing else.\n\nWeek 11 Signings\n\nDE Chris Mims - 1 year, $490k* (San Diego Chargers)\n\n-Got a great pass-rusher at vet min-sal deal because he was unhappy with the Chargers using him so little. He'll form a nice bookend with Hugh Douglas and he's a mentor to boot.\n\nOLB Lemanski Hall - 1 year, $410k* (Arizona Cardinals)\n\n-Good friends with Eric Swann and joins his old teammate on his new team. Strictly a reserve for both sides, though could see time in the goal-line set as well.\n\nWeek 11 Losses\n\nDE Trace Armstrong - 1 year, $590k (Detroit Lions)\n\n-Don't ask me how Armstrong got such a sweetheart deal from the Lions when Detroit could have gotten him cheaper if they'd gone after Mims. Especially since Mims is a far better player than Armstrong at this point in their careers. Then again, it's the Lions.\n\nAll in all, some major improvements this free agency, especially on the defensive side of the ball, despite missing out on Adams.\n\nWe'll have to see what the draft brings us.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\n2000 NFL Draft\n\nWe hold the 11th overall pick and I think we've got a darn good shot at landing an impact player, but we'll see what happens. The big chatter is about MLB Brian Urlacher, RB Shaun Alexander and QB Tom Brady.\n\n1. MLB Brian Urlacher - Houston Texans\n\n2. QB Tom Brady - Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\n3. RB Shaun Alexander - Cleveland Browns\n\n4. RB Mike Anderson - Chicago Bears\n\n5. RB Thomas Jones - Arizona Cardinals\n\n6. DT Darwin Walker - New England Patriots\n\n7. QB Chris Redman - Atlanta Falcons (via Cincinnati Bengals)\n\nHeh. I'll check the trade results later.\n\n8. OLB Keith Bulluck - Minnesota Vikings\n\n9. DE Shaun Ellis - Denver Broncos\n\n10. RB Jamal Lewis - New Orleans Saints\n\nIt would've been really nice to land Lewis, but there's still two players remaining who were #1 on my wishlist at this spot. One position, I think I can still find somebody worth grabbing in the second round. The other, I'm taking him now while the getting's good.\n\n11. DE John Abraham - Philadelphia Eagles\n\nHugh Douglas, say hello to your new best friend.\n\n12. OLB Lavar Arrington - Detroit Lions\n\n13. DT Brian Young - San Diego Chargers\n\n14. OLB Jeff Ulbrich - Seattle Seahawks\n\n15. QB Chad Pennington - St. Louis Rams\n\n16. QB Anthony Wright - Baltimore Ravens\n\n17. WR Darrell Jackson - Atlanta Falcons\n\n18. RB Ron Dayne - Kansas City Chiefs\n\n19. DT Steve Warren - Miami Dolphins\n\n20. DT Cornelius Griffin - New York Giants\n\n21. S Mike Brown - Jacksonville Jaguars\n\n22. DT Cedric Woodward - Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nI can't take it anymore. I send our 2nd, 3rd and the worst of our two 4th round picks to the Indianapolis Colts to move up and take the best WR in this draft, who never should've gotten past the Falcons.\n\n23. WR Plaxico Burress - Philadelphia Eagles\n\n24. WR Peter Warrick - Washington Redskins\n\n...And not a moment too soon, it appears. Wow. Burress and Warrick's careers will make for interesting comparisons.\n\n25. G Brad Bedell - Tennessee Titans\n\n26. DE Alvin McKinley - Oakland Raiders\n\n27. T Todd Wade - San Francisco 49ers\n\n28. CB Deltha O'Neal - Carolina Panthers\n\n29. DT Robaire Smith - New Jersey Jets\n\n30. CB Ahmed Plummer - Green Bay Packers\n\n31. ILB Shannon Taylor - Buffalo Bills\n\n32. OLB Julian Peterson - Dallas Cowboys\n\nIt's a long, long wait until the early 4th round when we pick again. As it turns, I could've selected a couple of my secondary WR targets in the 2nd and 3rd rounds, but that's okay. I would've been pissed if I'd had to go up against Plaxico twice a year. TE Anthony Becht is the pick here, as he fills a need area and I think he's got good enough all-around skills to someday become a starting, if not a pretty decent, TE.\n\nI was hoping to steal QB Marc Bulger in the 5th, but the Chicago Bears took him late in the 4th. Boo. So I take QB Joe Hamilton instead, who was a blast to watch at Georgia Tech.\n\nNo 6th round pick because of my first trade, so it's G Al Jackson, a very raw project out of LSU in the 7th round.\n\nLate Free Agency\n\nOh look. S Tim Hauck and SILB Mike Caldwell are holding out. They can hold out as long as they want. I'm not paying Caldwell the kind of money he's demanding. Well, okay, I'll sign Hauck. I need the mentor for our young safety.\n\nWeek 2 Signings\n\nTE Brian Kozlowski - 1 year $430k (Atlanta Falcons)\n\n-Nasty blocker and terrific long snapper. Real reason he was signed, was to be a mentor, but those bonus points make him well worth paying above min-sal for.\n\nWeek 2 Losses\n\nRB Eric Bieniemy - 1 year, $490k* (St. Louis Rams)\n\n-Saw the writing on the wall and got out while the going was getting good. We'll miss his power running and special teams work, but won't miss his production.\n\nWeek 3 Signings\n\nQB Jarious Jackson - 1 year, $200k (UDRFA)\n\n-I couldn't believe Jackson went undrafted. If we had a RB mentor, I'd be tempted to switch him over there. He'll fight it out with Hamilton for an active roster spot.\n\nG Rod Milstead - 1 year, $490k* (Washington Redskins)\n\n-And so we continue our NFC East poaching theme. But Rod's just a mentor for our ultra-raw 7th round pick.\n\nWeek 3 Losses\n\nFB Kevin Turner - 1 year, $560k (Baltimore Ravens)\n\n-Well, there goes our starting FB. Not that it matters.\n\nWeek 4 Signings\n\nFB Tommy \"Touchdown\" Vardell - 1 year, $490k* (Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n\n-Awesome! We snag Vardell who's not only a better blocker than Turner ever was, he's a FB mentor who has affinity with a couple guys.\n\nTraining Camp\n\nThe New York Jets make me the interesting offer of SILB James Farrior and a 4th round pick for G John Welbourn. I'm very tempted, but Welbourn's a Fan Favorite and besides, we've got a mentor for the second year player now. And if the AI won't trade a Fan Favorite, then I won't either.\n\nCode:\n\nDE John Abraham 1.11 31/72 32/63 +1/-9 FL Plaxico Burress 1.23 33/47 38/49 +5/+2 TE Anthony Becht 4.8 22/47 26/48 +4/+1 QB Joe Hamilton 5.7 7/21 10/26 +3/+5 G Al Jackson 7.13 15/50 18/46 +3/-4 QB Jarious Jackson UDFA 12/29 15/30 +3/+1 Draft Grade: A-\n\n...Ouch! on Abraham. Still, I'm very pleased with the rest of the class, all things considered. The battle for the 3rd string spot between Hamilton and Jackson is going to be fun to watch, though Hamilton had a terrific camp that'll give him the inside track.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\n2000 Season Looks Promising For McNabb, Eagles\n\nQB Donovan McNabb is hoping for a better sophomore season\n\nAn 0-3 start last season gave way to a 5-3 midway mark and the hopes of playoffs, only to have it all come crashing down as the Eagles lost four straight on their way to going 2-6 in the second half and 7-9 on the year, just barely missing the playoffs.\n\nNow, with some bold free agent acquisitions and an equally daring trade up in the draft, Philadelphia's front office and fans are hoping for a more successful result this year.\n\nQuarterback\n\nIt's Donovan McNabb's team, of course. He showed major strides in training camp and should have an even better second year than his rookie season, where he just missed the 3,000 yard mark. The competition for backup quarterback will be a three-way battle between 15 year vet Mark Rypien, 5th round draft pick Joe Hamilton and undrafted rookie free agent Jarious Jackson. Hamilton wowed the coaching staff in training camp, showing more stuff than people thought he would and might well be the favorite, with Rypien as the #3 man.\n\nRunning Back\n\nErrict Rhett was brought in via free agency to challenge Duce Staley for the starting spot, but all indications are that Staley will again serve as the team's #1 back, with Rhett #2 and a blocking back on passing downs. FB Tommy \"Touchdown\" Vardell will be in a intense battle with Cecil Martin for the FB spot and it's hard to say who will win that one.\n\nWide Receiver\n\nPlaxico Burress had a camp just as impressive as Hamilton's and the late 1st round pick appears to be worth the huge amount of draft picks Izulde Jestor used to acquire him. He'll serve as the starting flanker, bumping Charles Johnson to the #3 spot. Torrance Small will have his hands full fending off free agent newcomer Michael Westbrook at split end, but given McNabb's rapport with Small last year, we'll give the vote to Small. TE Troy Drayton is the new starting TE, but keep an eye out for 4th round rookie Anthony Becht, who showed in his first camp that he has the goods to eventually be the starter.\n\nOffensive Line\n\nC Jeff Dellenbach vs Bubba Miller will be an interesting battle, but look for Dellenbach to stay the starter. 2nd year LG John Welbourn looked terrific in camp and is a lock to keep his spot as well and the same is true of LT Tra Thomas, who built on his phenemonal second half with a stellar camp. RG Steve Everett will return as the starter, as will RT Leon Searcy, meaning that the Eagles return the entire same starting five as last year. Earl Dotson will be the backup tackle and Jermaine Mayberry will duke it out with 7th round pick Al Jackson and second year Doug Brzenki for the reserve guard spot.\n\nKicker\n\nK David Aker and P Sean Landeta are as good a pair as any in the league, although Landeta is very close to retirement and could be replaced next season.\n\nDefensive Line\n\nThe Eagles are sticking with a 3-4 and it'll be interesting to see how new starting NT Eric Swann handles the transition from a 4-3. Tim Bowens just barely edges out Hollis Thomas as Swann's backup and will spell him in the dime package. LDE Hugh Douglas returns as the starter and RDE features a tough fight between the incumbent Mike Mamula and 11th overall pick John Abraham, who had a disastrous training camp. We'll go with Abraham to win and Mamula and DE Chris Mims as backups in a deep rotation.\n\nLinebackers\n\nSILB Mike Caldwell continues to hold out, so look for Jeremiah Trotter, who showed off huge improvement in camp, to switch over there and line up alongside Quentin Coryatt, who takes the SLB spot. Ike Reese will man WLB again, leaving James Darling to move to WILB and get the starting job he's been so vocally auditioning for. Barry Gardner and Lemanski Hall are the ILB and OLB backups respectively.\n\nSecondary\n\nBad news for the Eagles as both CB Troy Vincent and high-priced signing Deion Sanders appear to have lost a step. They're still very much an above-average starting duo, though and fourth year Al Harris's starting experience last season gives Philadelphia a good nickel corner. The team needs to get some youth in here fast, though. FS Brian Dawkins was the defense's biggest star last year and second year SS Damon Moore looks set to unseat Tim Hauck as the starter after an excellent summer league showing.\n\nCode:\n\nPlayer # Pos Start Exp Current Estimate Future Estimate Cntrct McNabb, Donovan 11 QB 2 32 70 6 yrs Rypien, Mark 10 QB 15 20 20 1 yr.

According to most preseason polls, though, both wildcards will belong to the East, with the Giants building on last year's Cinderella playoff run to take the division this year and the Redskins and Eagles as the NFC's wildcard spots. The defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys may be just a bit too long in the tooth for the rest of the division's rising power.\n\n***End Article***\n\nWe signed CB Steve Jackson off the street after the article was published, just so we could have someone other than Primetime to return kickoffs.\n\nI like how this team looks, to be honest. I wouldn't call us a Super Bowl contender just yet, but the playoffs are a very real possibility.\n\nPreseason\n\nPhiladelphia 24 Kansas City 17\n\nThe running game is going to be a problem again this year, but SLB Quentin Coryatt looked great, winning Player of the Game with 9 tackles, 3 assists, 1.5 sacks, a hurry and 2 knockdowns and CB Deion Sanders had 2 pass defenses.\n\nBuffalo 14 Philadelphia 7\n\nWe lost because QB Joe Hamilton simply isn't ready to be a starting NFL quarterback. He's thrown under 50% in both exhibition games. SLB Quentin Coryatt continues to impress, with 10 tackles, 3 assists, a sack, a hurry and a knockdown. WILB James Darling forced 2 fumbles.\n\nPhiladelphia 13 Denver 27\n\nQB Jarious Jackson threw over 50% (16/31) and a TD. Not bad, kid. The Golden Domer might beat the Yellow Jacket after all. Other than that, not much to write home about.\n\nNew England 16 Philadelphia 27\n\nI like to close out preseason with a win, so this was good to see. QB Jarious Jackson was 11/19 for 204 yards, a TD and an INT, outplaying Mark Rypien, who was 1/7 and included a pick in that total. Guess we know who's the #2 QB in Philly. WR Plaxico Buress caught 4 passes for 107 yards and SLB Quentin Coryatt was again Player of the Game with 9 tackles, 3 assists, 2 sacks, 2 hurries and 4 knockdowns. CB Deion Sanders picked up 4 pass defenses and an interception and CB Troy Vincent and SS Damon Moore had 2 pass deflections a piece.\n\nDE John Abraham hyperextends his elbow and will miss the season opener and TE Anthony Becht is Doubtful with a pulled groin. Talk about a rookie injury curse that's developing here in Philly.\n\nRegular Season\n\nPhiladelphia 20 Washington 24\n\nEvery divisional game is huge this season, so it's disappointing to lose the season opener to the Redskins. No real standout performances for us, and Redskins RB Skip Hicks was just barely over 100 yards rushing.\n\nCincinnati 52 Philadelphia 13\n\n...How the hell did the Bengals hang 52 points on us?! Donovan McNabb and Jarious Jackson combining for 5 interceptions for starters. Throw in Corey Dillon bashing us for 122 yards and 2 TDs and QB Dave Brown of all people going for 243 yards and 2 TDs passing. What's happened to our defense this season? What's happened to McNabb?\n\nDE John Abraham is back to Probable at least.\n\nChicago 6 Philadelphia 19\n\nWell, it's ugly, but we'll take it. RB Duce Staley erupts for 130 yards on 14 carries, K David Akers hits 4/5 field goals and DE Chris Mims gets Player of the Game with 2 tackles, 2 assists, 2 sacks and a forced fumble. CB Deion Sanders has 2 pass defenses. QB Donovan McNabb throws for a season high 191 yards, but has an interception on top of it.\n\nGood news: TE Anthony Becht is Probable.\n\nBad news: NT Eric Swann breaks his clavicle and is Out an estimated 5 weeks. Tim Bowens takes over and Hollis Thomas comes off the inactive list to be the backup.\n\nAtlanta 16 Philadelphia 17\n\nK David Akers hits a 31 yarder with 7 seconds left on the clock to bail us out against a Falcons team that always plays us tough. Donovan McNabb finally breaks the 200 yard passing barrier with 290 and 2 TDs, but he also throws 3 interceptions and nearly costs us the game. RB Duce Staley rushes 11 times for 113 yards and WR Torrance Small gets 8 catches for 142 yards and a TD. The defense is led by CB Deion Sanders with 2 pass defenses.\n\nNew Orleans 10 Philadelphia 34\n\nFinally, our first convincing win of the year, one that puts us over .500. Sure, the Saints suck and very stupidly drafted Jamal Lewis when they already had Ricky Williams, last year's Offensive Rookie of the Year, but it's still good to see Donovan McNabb go 18/28 for 266 yards and 3 TDs. TE Troy Drayton had his best game to date in an Eagles uniform, leading all receivers with 5 catches for 93 yards and 2 TDs. RB Duce Staley is on a mission this year, racking up 105 yards on 17 carries. Oh, and our pass defense combined for 4 interceptions.\n\nPhiladelphia 14 Carolina 31\n\n...And right back down the crapper. Here's another sub-200 yard game from Donovan McNabb with 2 picks and I don't care about FS Brian Dawkins's 10 tackles, 3 assists and pass defense. RB Tim Biakabutuka rocks us for 172 yards and 2 TDs. FML.\n\nSILB Mike Caldwell ended his holdout in preseason, but screw him, I say. I'll develop the linebackers I have, especially since I want that 4-3 D.\n\nPhiladelphia 26 Tampa Bay 7\n\nDonovan McNabb ensures the Bucs stay winless with an 18/27 for 257 yards and 2 TDs outing, the bulk of the work going to WR Charles Johnson, who has 5 catches for 101 yards and a TD. K David Akers was a perfect 4/4, including a 55 yarder and CB Troy Vincent blows up for 5 pass defenses.\n\nAnd of course, right when we get back NT Eric Swann, SLB Quentin Coryatt decides it's time to break his ankle and go Out for 7 weeks. All right Mike Caldwell. You win, asshole. Move to the strong side, pronto.\n\nNew York 23 Philadelphia 17\n\n...Ugh. Bright spot - WR Plaxico Burress with 8 catches for 129 yards and a TD. Dark spot, everything else. Including RB Duce Staley carrying the ball 11 times for a grand total of 19 yards. This was a must-win game and we didn't.\n\nWhich means we're 4-4 and in third place in the East. We'll be lucky to even get the #2 playoff spot, because somebody forgot to tell the Arizona Cardinals they're supposed to suck for a few more years and they're 5-2, tied with the 49ers atop the NFC West.\n\nMight as well crown the Redskins' asses now. They're the best team in the NFL at 7-1 and the Giants are 4-3 behind them. But at least I can take solace in the Cowboys being last and least at 3-5.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nSearching For Answers\n\nA frustrating first half isn't what QB Donovan McNabb or the Eagles expected\n\nA season that brimmed with playoff promise has become mired in 4-4 mediocrity for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe reasons for this are numerous and start with second year QB Donovan McNabb himself, who has yet to have a 300 yard game this season after posting four as a rookie, and in fact has just half his games of even 200 passing yards this season. He's also been extremely erratic in his TD to INT ratio and his 13 TDs to 11 INTs matches exactly what he had in 13 games last season.\n\nRB Duce Staley, although on pace for a 1,000 yard season with 0 fumbles, also has not scored a single rushing touchdown this year. For the receivers, WR Torrance Small looks set to reprise his 1,000 yard receiving season, but has only 2 touchdown catches and McNabb has had trouble establishing a rhythm with his other receivers. On the other hand, TE Troy Drayton has 14 catches for 216 yards and is quickly becoming one of McNabb's favorite safety valves along with Staley, who has 24 receptions for 114 yards and 4 TDs.\n\nBut the biggest reason the Eagles are failing season expectations is because their defense is failing them. Yes, CB Troy Vincent has 10 pass defenses already an 85.8% pass defense rating, and yes, Philadelphia is #1 against the pass in terms of yardage, but they're also 31st against the run, surrendering 131.8 yards a game on the ground and give up 21.1 points a game, which ranks them 24th in the league.\n\nThe 3-4 defense has handicapped DE Hugh Douglas as an effective pass rusher and on top of it, SLB Quentin Coryatt, the Eagles' best all-around defender after Vincent, recently broke his leg and is out for most of the second half. GM Izulde Jestor has talked for a year and a half now about getting the 4-3 in place and it's something he needs to do as soon as this offseason.\n\nWe've seen good, solid performances out of the offensive line, including greatly improved run-blocking, which has been a key to Staley's success. McNabb has been sacked just 13 times, which ranks him in the upper third of the most well-protected quarterbacks in the league. K David Akers is in a bit of a sophomore slump, hitting just 16/21, including 8/13 from 40+ and 1/4 from 50+ yards out.\n\nThere's still time to rebound in the second half, but it'll take McNabb finding his first year form and some more toughness against the run on the defense's part if the Eagles hope to see the playoffs.\n\nCode:\n\nRecord 4-4 Philadelphia Eagles Team Rank Rushes per Game 26.8 15 Rushing Yards 129.3 4 Yards Per Carry 4.83 2 Pass Attempts 31.9 22 Completions 20.3 21 (T) Completion Pct. 63.5 13 Passing Yards 226.4 19 Yards Per Attempt 7.10 12 Yards Per Catch 11.18 13 Total Yardage Gained 346.0 10 3rd Down Conversions 34.4 24 Points Per Game 20.0 16 Pass Rush Pct. 23.4 6 Pass Defense Pct. 54.8 12 Turnovers 15 23 (T) Turnover Margin -4 24 (T) Opponents Team Rank Rushes per Game 31.4 30 Rushing Yards 131.8 31 Yards Per Carry 4.20 23 Pass Attempts 28.0 1 Completions 16.5 1 Completion Pct. 58.9 6 (T) Passing Yards 183.4 1 Yards Per Attempt 6.55 16 Yards Per Catch 11.11 21 Total Yardage Gained 297.5 8 3rd Down Conversions 42.6 24 Points Per Game 21.1 23 Pass Rush Pct. 18.7 9 Pass Defense Pct. 56.9 24 Turnovers 11 22 Passing Pos Att Comp Yards Y/Att TD Int Rate 11 D.

Donovan McNabb throws for just 157 yards on 15/30 passing with 2 interceptions and the whole team plays like absolute garbage. Crown their damn asses!\n\nWR Michael Westbrook strains his deltoid muscle and is Out roughly 4 weeks. We sign Willie Jackson off the scrap heap to be the 4th WR.\n\nDallas 31 Philadelphia 17\n\nWe're just completely off-kilter right now. Our run game has turned absolutely horrible, Donovan McNabb throws another 2 picks and I'm officially declaring this season a loss.\n\nWR Michael Westbrook is back up to Probable after the bye week.\n\nPhiladelphia 45 Cleveland 7\n\nWhen in doubt, there's always the Browns to beat up on. Donovan McNabb has his best game of the year: 21/26 for 275 yards and 3 TDs. DE Hugh Douglas gets 5 tackles, 2 sacks and 5 knockdowns and CB Troy Vincent and S Damon Moore each defend 2 passes.\n\nPhiladelphia 3 Arizona 31\n\nThere's just no consistency in our offense and it's frustrating as hell. Best Eagle of the game: WLB Ike Reese with 5 tackles, 1.5 sacks, a hurry and a knockdown.\n\nFB Tommy Vardell hyperextends his elbow - Out 3 weeks and DE Hugh Douglas pulls a calf muscle and is Out 6 weeks. Douglas missed 3 games last year too, so I think it's safe to call him injury prone.\n\nOn the bright side, I get to sign another Mentor and one of my fave players FB Larry Centers, to take Vardell's spot. DE Chris Mims takes over for Douglas as the starting LDE.\n\nBaltimore 17 Philadelphia 26\n\nDonovan McNabb leads a 4th quarter comeback and wins Player of the Game with his 23/37 for 286 yards, 2 TDs and an INT outing and CB Deion Sanders has 2 pass defenses and an INT. Sadly, all this win does is push more towards 8-8 or 7-9 territory and a bah humbug pick.\n\nPhiladelphia 6 New York 38\n\nWorst.outing.ever. Donovan McNabb throws 4 interceptions and goes 8/17 for 81 yards. We just got our asses handed to us through and through. On the bright side, Jarious Jackson did go 14/20 for 139 yards in relief.\n\nTE Anthony Becht hyperextends his knee and is out 3 weeks and I don't care that FB Tommy Vardell is Probable. Let's just get this season over with.\n\nPhiladelphia 44 Pittsburgh 10\n\nSo we're now 7-8 and are guaranteed to at least match last year's record. Donovan McNabb gets his first 300+ yard game of the season at 24/35 for 348 yards and 3 TDs. WR Plaxico Burress, who's very quietly had a pretty darn good second half, catches 5 passes for 116 yards and a TD. DE Chris Mims gets 1.5 sacks, 3 hurries and 2 knockdown to go with 3 assists and 2 tackles and SLB Mike Caldwell defends 2 passes.\n\nSLB Quentin Coryatt is able to come back for our last game, but then S Tim Hauck injures himself, leading us to cut CB Jason Bostic and sign S Chris Oldham off the street.\n\nPhiladelphia 31 Dallas 9\n\nOn the bright side, we improve on last year's record and keep the 'Boys out of the playoffs. That does make me happy, considering I intensely dislike the Cowboys of the '90s. Emmitt Smith is the most overrated damn RB in the history of the game. Great outing by Donovan McNabb with 277 yards and 4 TDs to 1 pick on 19/28 passing. WR Plaxico Burress continues his strong second half with 7 catches for 127 yards and a TD and CB Deion Sanders records 10 tackles and an assist.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nA Slim Improvement\n\nFirst round pick WR Plaxico Burress turned it on in the second half of the year\n\nAnother frustrating year ended in an 8-8 record for QB Donovan McNabb and the Philadelphia Eagles, their second straight finish in the bottom of the NFC East.\n\nAlthough the team failed to make the playoffs, despite their own expectations and those of preseason magazines, there were some bright spots to highlight the year. McNabb stayed healthy all season and racked up 3,706 yards and 26 TDs to 21 INTs. He found particular rapport with 23rd overall pick WR Plaxico Burress in the second half, allowing the rookie to break the 1,000 yard mark in his first season, with 1,034 yards and 8 TDs on 71 catches. He'll definitely get Rookie of the Year consideration. Last year's #1 WR, Torrance Small, had 63 catches for 847 yards and 4 TDs, giving hope that the Eagles might just have two 1,000 yard receivers down the road.\n\nBut the run game was simply putrid, and the quest to replace RB Duce Staley as the #1 back will continue. The defense was also horrible against the run, allowing a 27th worst 117.6 yards a game. Beefing up the run will certainly bea point of emphasis on both sides of the ball this offseason.\n\nPhiladelphia will also need to work on ball security, especially the starting QB, as McNabb's 21 interceptions and 7 fumbles played a major role in the Eagles' 25th worst -8 turnover ratio. And of course, there is the long-wished for conversion to a 4-3, which, after some shocking defensive meltdowns this season, will almost certainly be in the plans for next year.\n\nCode:\n\nYear 2000 Record 8-8 Winning Pct. .500 All-Time 15-17 Winning Pct. .468 Playoffs 0-0 Playoff Visits 0 Bowl Wins 0 Philadelphia Eagles Team Rank Rushes per Game 27.1 16 Rushing Yards 111.1 11 Yards Per Carry 4.10 7 Pass Attempts 32.4 23 Completions 20.6 22 (T) Completion Pct. 63.7 16 Passing Yards 242.6 16 Yards Per Attempt 7.49 7 Yards Per Catch 11.76 5 Total Yardage Gained 341.9 10 3rd Down Conversions 34.9 24 Points Per Game 20.8 16 (T) Pass Rush Pct. 21.1 9 (T) Pass Defense Pct. 48.4 18 Turnovers 34 29 Turnover Margin -8 25 (T) Opponents Team Rank Rushes per Game 29.7 27 (T) Rushing Yards 117.6 27 Yards Per Carry 3.96 21 Pass Attempts 30.8 6 Completions 19.1 2 Completion Pct. 62.1 12 Passing Yards 212.7 5 Yards Per Attempt 6.90 15 Yards Per Catch 11.12 18 (T) Total Yardage Gained 312.3 10 3rd Down Conversions 34.4 4 Points Per Game 20.7 19 (T) Pass Rush Pct. 19.5 14 (T) Pass Defense Pct. 51.6 24 Turnovers 26 19 (T) Passing Pos Att Comp Yards Y/Att TD Int Rate 11 D.

(Re-signing)\n\n-Could stay the starting RT or, more likely, will be the top reserve. But he's a mentor and a guy I traded for, so I'm keeping him.\n\nWeek 3 Losses\n\nWILB James Darling - 1 year, $540k (Indianapolis Colts)\n\n-We're planning on switching to a 4-3, so we weren't inclined to fight too hard for our inside linebackers, especially not ones who don't live up to expectations, fan favorite status be damned.\n\nTE Troy Drayton - 1 year, $540k (Dallas Cowboys)\n\n-Very solid player for us last year and I kind of hate to see him go, but I really, really want Becht to be the starter next year.\n\nWeek 4 Signings\n\nWR Torrance Small - 3 years, $5.86 mil. (Re-signing)\n\n-It's way overpaying for a guy in his 10th season, but he's been a key part of this offense and he's a mentor to boot. Between Burress, Small and Westbrook, McNabb will have a trio of WRs he has experience and rapport with. Cohesion FTW.\n\nWeek 5 Signings\n\nC Bubba Miller - 1 year, $460k (Re-signing)\n\n-Will start next year, because Jeff Dellenbach hung it up.\n\nWeek 5 Losses\n\nDE Mike Mamula - 1 year, $520k (Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n\n-Had absolutely no intention of re-signing with us, as he was very angry that he got passed up as a starter by Hugh Douglas and John Abraham. Funny thing is, he won't start with the Bucs either.\n\nDT Tim Bowens - 1 year, $600k (Minnesota Vikings)\n\n-Fascinating. Bowens was only a half-time starter with us and gets a significantly above min-sal deal from the Vikings. Good luck, Tim!\n\nWeek 6 Signings\n\nDE Chris Mims - 2 years, $1.7 mil. (Re-signing)\n\n-Slight overpay, but he had 6.5 sacks in just 5 starts last year and he's a mentor. Good insurance in case Hugh Douglas gets hurt yet again.\n\nCB Phillipi Sparks - 1 year, $1 mil. (New York Giants)\n\n-Had a lot of interest around him, but he'll be a solid corner for us, even if he's in his 10th season. A one year rental, no doubt.\n\nWeek 7 Signings\n\nWR Andre Hastings - 1 year, $660k (New Orleans Saints)\n\n-A sure-handed mentor, he was a two year starter for the Saints and now slots in what is an increasingly deep receiving corps. McNabb's happy to have more help.\n\nWeek 7 Losses\n\nRT Earl Dotson - 1 year, $500k* (Pittsburgh Steelers)\n\n-Very good backup tackle for us, but we just wanted to go in another direction. In other words, we're hoping to find an heir apparent to Searcy at RT in the draft.\n\nWeek 8 Signings\n\nTE Jackie Harris - 1 year, 570k* (Baltimore Ravens)\n\n-Mentor who looks good enough to be the backup, but not so good he'll wrecks Becht's chances at starting.\n\nDraft is up next.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\n2001 NFL Draft 1st Round\n\nThis draft class is stacked at RB. LaDainan Tomlinson is the biggest and best, but Deuce McAllister and Lamont Jordan are drawing interest as well. WR looks good too, headlined by Steve Smith and Chad Johnson and there's also quite a few good defensive linemen, notably DEs Derrick Burgess and Kyle Vanden Bosch and DTs Chartric Darby and Marcus Stroud.\n\nWe hold the 14th pick.\n\n1. QB Todd Bouman - Cleveland Browns\n\n...Wow! The guy who wasn't even the top-rated QB on most draft boards in an extremely weak class goes #1 overall. But then again, this is the Browns.\n\n2. QB Drew Brees - Oakland Raiders (through Houston Texans)\n\nAnd there goes the draft's best QB. The Houston Texans get Oakland's 2003 1st and 2nd round pick and their 3rd round pick in this draft for the #2 overall pick. Defensive Rookie of the Year Brian Urlacher will have to wait another couple seasons for help.\n\n3.

The Bears give up their 2003 1st rounder and their 3rd round picks this year and in 2003 to grab this impact defender. Anderson, Smith and Burgess.. that's a group that can make Chicago better in a hurry.\n\n11. DE Kyle Vanden Bosch - New England Patriots\n\n12. CB Jerametrius Butler - Cincinnati Bengals\n\n13. DT Chartric Darby - Oakland Raiders\n\nAnd so now it's our turn. The pick's a no-brainer as we need to commit ourselves to the 4-3 and the player I had my eye on for this spot all along fell here.\n\n14. DT Shaun Rogers - Philadelphia Eagles\n\nSay hello to our DT anchor in our new 4-3!\n\n15. T Leonard Davis - Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n16. RB Lamont Jordan - Dallas Cowboys\n\n17. RB Travis Henry - Buffalo Bills\n\n18. ILB Kendrell Bell - New York Giants (through San Diego Chargers)\n\n2002 1st, 2003 1st -and- a 2003 2nd? The Chargers just made out like bandits.\n\n19.

WR Reggie Wayne - New York Giants\n\nI -am- not happy. I was hoping Wayne would drop a little more and for him to go to the Giants double-hurts. The G-men may have mortgaged their future to get Bell, but they amended that with their steal here. First they screw me out of the playoffs in McNabb's rookie year, now they get a player I really wanted.\n\n24. RB Reuben Droughns - Tennessee Titans\n\n25. G Rick De Mulling - San Francisco 49ers\n\n26. ILB Antonio Pierce - Carolina Panthers\n\n27. G Kevin Garmon - Cincinnati Bengals\n\n28. DE Adewale Ogunleye - Arizona Cardinals\n\n29. RB Dominic Rhodes - Green Bay Packers\n\n30. RB Benjamin Gay - New York Jets\n\n31. DE Richard Seymour - Washington Redskins\n\n32. RB Jason Brookins - Indianapolis Colts\n\nThere's a CB I really like in the second round, but I'm going to gamble that he's there in the third. We really need help at RB, so I go with a Badger in RB Michael Bennett, one of a long, proud line of Wisconsin backs.\n\nI get nervous the CB I want will be taken before my pick in the 3rd, so I trade my 3rd and 5th round picks to the Seattle Seahawks to draft CB Will Allen.\n\nIt's not an area of need, but to see C Hank Fraley, a 2nd round, maybe even a 1st round talent still sitting there in the 4th makes it an easy pick, especially with fantastic combines.\n\nWe don't have a 5th, so in the 6th we take LT Kenyatta Jones, who actually projects better at RT. Not saying he'll ever be a starter, especially with suspected low endurance, but at this stage, he's worth the flyer.\n\nFS Adam Archuleta is our 7th round pick, thanks to his terrific run defense upside, which could earn him a spot in the goal-line package.\n\nLate Free Agency\n\nWeek 1 Signings\n\nQB Mark Rypien - 1 year, $560k* (Re-signing)\n\n-Mentor.\n\nC Brian Williams - 2 years, $1.67 mil.

We'll cut him if he sucks.\n\nDT Keith Traylor - 1 year, $570k* (Tennessee Titans)\n\n-Mentor who still has some run-stopping ability.\n\nWeek 5 Losses\n\nMLB James Willis - 1 year, $590k (Dallas Cowboys) (Jacksonville Jaguars)\n\n-Realized too late that we needed another ILB and so missed out on him. That means a scrubby backup named Pete Monty, signed after training camp.\n\nCode:\n\nLDT Shaun Rogers 1.14 36/72 42/73 +6/+1 RB Michael Bennett 2.13 47/55 48/54 +1/-1 RCB Will Allen 3.7 20/39 24/42 +4/+3 C Hank Fraley 4.16 46/81 53/78 +8/-3 RT Kenyatta Jones 6.14 16/43 19/43 +3/+0 FS Adam Archuleta 7.13 13/32 14/32 +1/+0 Draft Grade: A- (#4 draft)\n\nWhat an absolutely fantastic class. Rogers, Bennett and Fraley figure as Day One starters, Allen should be the dime corner and Jones will serve as the main backup T.\n\nIt's going to be an interesting year next season.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nEagles Expected To Earn East Title\n\n4th round pick C Hank Fraley turned heads in training camp\n\nTwo straight last places in the tough, competitive NFC East haven't prevented some preseason pundits to predict a division title for the Philadelphia Eagles over the defending NFC champion Washington Redskins. QB Donovan McNabb has arguably his best supporting cast in his young career and, much like the Eagles made a slow improvement from first year to second year and are expected to soar this season, so too, is he expected to breakout.\n\nQuarterback\n\nThis will again be McNabb's team and many are forecasting this is the year he truly becomes one of the upper division quarterbacks in the league. But the depth's thin behind him, with 2nd year man Joe Hamilton and old man Mark Rypien fighting it out again for the backup spot.\n\nRunning Back\n\nGM Izulde Jestor finally has a shiny new #1 back, 2nd round pick Michael Bennett. There's some scouts who believe that Duce Staley is the better pure runner, but Bennett has much better hole recognition and third down running ability. Cecil Martin is the lone FB on the roster.\n\nReceivers\n\nSecond year FL Plaxico Burress is set to build on his 1,000 yard rookie season. The starting split end spot will be a neck and neck fight between Torrance Small and [b]Michael Westbrook, but McNabb's comfort with Small should see the veteran win out. Andre Hastings gives the Eagles a great third receiver after coming in from free agency. At TE, second year man Anthony Becht has been handed the starting spot, even with Troy Drayton's success last year. Jackie Harris will be the backup and likely the 5th receiver.\n\nOffensive Line\n\nUnlike last season, when all five of the Eagles' o-line returned, there'll be at least one new face blocking for McNabb and Bennett. While a new center was certain after Jeff Dellenbach retired, what no one could have anticipated was that Hank Fraley would fall to the Eagles in the 4th round, or that the Robert Morris product would amaze the coaching staff with the best rookie camp of the Jestor regime, stealing the starting spot from former heir apparent Bubba Miller. In fact, the coaches are so high on Fraley, they think he could be an All-Pro, 10 year or more starter. The tackles will stay the same, with Tra Thomas manning the left side, Leon Searcy the right, and John Wellbourn will remain at left guard, but right guard is an open battle between incumbent Steve Everett, Jermaine Mayberry and last year's 7th round pick, Al Jackson. Miller, the losers of the right guard fight, and 6th round pick Kenyatta Jones will be the reserves.\n\nDefensive Line\n\nPhiladelphia's switch to a 4-3 defense is highlighted by 1st round pick Shaun Rogers, an expected impact rookie at left defensive tackle. Eric Swann moves from NT to RDT, with the defensive end spots taken by oft-injured Hugh Douglas and sophomore John Abraham, who hopes to rebound from a disappointing rookie campaign. Pass-rush specialist Chris Mims will back up the end spots, while Hollis Thomas and Keith Traylor will rotate at DT.\n\nLinebackers\n\nAlthough the linebacking corps isn't the strength it once was, as players have been allowed to leave via free agency or trades, SLB Quentin Coryatt, MLB Jeremiah Trotter and WLB Ike Reese form as capable a set of three as any in the league. Coryatt needs to corral his injury-proneness, though and Reese is probably best suited to a 3-4. Barry Gardner and Mike Caldwell are the backups, Caldwell good enough to start for most teams in the NFL.\n\nSecondary\n\nPick any pair from Troy Vincent, free agent pickup Phillipi Sparks and Al Harris. That's how close the Eagles' top three cornerbacks are. Unfortunately, none of them is a shutdown corner, but together, they make a very solid backbone of a nickel package. 3rd round rookie Will Allen has upside enough to reach the level of those above him and figures in as the dime back this season. Damon Moore and Brian Dawkins return as the starting safeties, with Tom Hauck and 7th round pick Adam Archuleta as the reserves.\n\nPotential Issues\n\nIn a word: Depth. The starting units on both sides of the ball are worthy of the division title billing the Eagles are getting in some press, but an injury at the wrong position, such as quarterback or offensive tackle, will devastate Philadelphia's playoff hopes. Right guard could also use an upgrade and a few areas on the team, such as offensive tackle and cornerback, need more quality in their youth.\n\nSeason Predictions\n\nThe Eagles are slightly favored to win the East overall, though almost as many predict the Redskins to repeat as division champs. Indianapolis is the prohibitive favorite to repeat as Super Bowl champions and the St. Louis Rams are slight favorites over the Green Bay Packers to win the NFC title.\n\n***End Article***\n\nSimply put, we have to avoid injury woes.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nPreseason\n\nPhiladelphia 23 Houston 14\n\n2.5 sacks and 3 knockdowns by DE Hugh Douglas earn him Player of the Game, but the exciting part was Joe Hamilton going 17/25 for 144 yards, 2 TDs and an INT. Maybe he can be a capable backup after all.\n\nBoom! Injuries hit. RDT Eric Swann breaks his foot and is Out approximately 10 weeks, LDT Shaun Rogers sprains a knee ligament and is Questionable for 9 weeks and CB Will Allen hyperextends his knee and is estimated Out 3 weeks.\n\n3rd year DTs Sherman Gregoire and Dixon Cassidy are signed off the street along with 3rd year CB Charles Fisher. Gregoire and Hollis Thomas take over at LDT and RDT respectively. Fisher becomes the backup RCB and inserts into our goal line package.\n\nCleveland 15 Philadelphia 29\n\nCB Phillipi Sparks returns a kickoff 92 yards for a TD and grabs 2 interceptions, but to counter that happy news, RB Michael Bennett fumbles 3 times. Not good.\n\nIndianapolis 23 Philadelphia 14\n\nA not unexpected loss to the Colts. CB Troy Vincent's 2 pass defenses are the lone highlight.\n\nInteresting side note: All of the NFC East teams started 2-0 in preseason and after the third game, only the Giants are still unbeaten in exhibition play.\n\nCB Will Allen is back to Probable, but then DE Hugh Douglas comes in to say that he's been suffering from depression after his injuries the last two seasons and his underachieving performance. He said it's been getting worse and worse and he just can't bring himself to play football right now. I tell him to take as much time he needs to recover and sign 9th year DE Ty Parten to be the backup end, Chris Mims taking over at the LDE spot.\n\nPhiladelphia 20 Pittsburgh 13\n\nIt's only preseason, but a road win over the Steelers always satisfies. QB Joe Hamilton had the game of his life: 23/31 for 304 yards and 2 TDs on a night when Donovan McNabb went a perfect 7/7 for 121 yards, a yard less than WR Torrance Small got on 7 catches. One of Small's grabs was good for a 2 yard TD reception. DE John Abraham had 2 sacks, thus bettering in one game his whole total for all of last season. The sweetest part of this fun game? Hamilton led the 4th quarter comeback.\n\nIn fact, the game was so enjoyable, DE Hugh Douglas said afterwards that he's ready to play again and help lead this team to the playoffs. I'll definitely take it, especially since it's just in time for the regular season.\n\nRegular Season\n\nPhiladelphia 28 New York Giants 27\n\nWith 49 seconds left on the game clock, Donovan McNabb hit WR Torrance Small for a 10 yard TD pass and the thrilling comeback victory! McNabb won Player of the Game on 26/42 for 281 yards, 3 TDs and 1 INT and CB Troy Vincent headlined the defense with 3 pass defenses and an interception.\n\nDE Hugh Douglas sprains his knee and is Questionable for the next game. We'll sit him. But the most devastating injury is LT Tra Thomas, who dislocates his elbow and is Out roughly 8 weeks. We put Leon Searcy at LT, sign 3rd year T Jerry Wisne, and make Kenyatta Jones the starting RT. But on the whole, I'm thinking our season is sunk.\n\nDenver 16 Philadelphia 23\n\nNo final heroics in this one, although Donovan McNabb wins Player of the Game again with 276 yards and a TD on 23/30 passing. RB Michael Bennett had the first 100 yard game of his NFL career with exactly that on 18 carries and Torrance Small had 7 catches for 116 yards. K David Akers nailed 3/4 field goals, including a 55 yarder and the defense had a couple stars as well. CB Phillipi Sparks recorded 10 tackles and 2 assists and DE Chris Mims showed why he was so deadly a rusher last year, with 4 tackles, 2 sacks, 5 hurries and 3 knockdowns.\n\nRDT Hollis Thomas continues the revolving door at DT, as he'll miss a game with a strained Achilles tendon, which means Keith Traylor will get a start and DT Dixon Cassidy gets in on passing downs.\n\nPhiladelphia 34 Seattle 13\n\nEven with all the injuries, we blow out the Seahawks, despite Donovan McNabb's 2 picks to go with his 2 TDs and 280 yards. RB Michael Bennett won Player of the Game despite the mundane statline of 25 rushes for 89 yards and a TD and 5 catches for 31 yards. CB Troy Vincent and CB Al Harris shut down Seattle's passing game with 3 and 2 pass defenses respectively.\n\nDT Hollis Thomas is back to full health, but the bigger news is that DT Shaun Rogers is finally Probable, along with DE Hugh Douglas. Hello, instant D-line upgrade!\n\nMinnesota 28 Philadelphia 31\n\nA game that threatens to go into overtime is won with 5 seconds left on the clock when K David Akers hits the 44 yard FG to send us to 4-0. Donovan McNabb had a great game - 30/39 for 309 yards, 3 TDs and an INT to win PotG and Hugh Douglas awoke with a venegance at 6 tackles, 2 sacks, 4 hurries and 2 knockdowns. CB Phillipi Sparks and S Brian Dawkins had 2 pass defenses a piece.\n\nDT Eric Swann is back to Probable, giving us a comparatively full-strength d-line for the first time this season.\n\nDetroit 26 Philadelphia 41\n\nDonovan McNabb records another 300 yard outing in this one with 309 on 23/33 passing. He also threw for 4 TDs and 2 INTs. But he wasn't Player of the Game. That honor went to CB Troy Vincent, who had an astounding 6 tackles, 1 assist and 3 interceptions. One of my favorite Badgers of all-time has still got it going on in his 10th season, fo' sho.\n\nPhiladelphia 10 Green Bay 30\n\nWell, we knew a perfect season wasn't likely, but it's still disappointing to get blown out this badly by the Packers, who move to 6-0 on the year in this battle of the unbeatens. No highlights, as you might expect.\n\nPhiladelphia 38 Washington 24\n\nSo much for the Redskins repeating. With the loss, they drop to 2-4. Coolest play of the game: Duce Staley returning a fumble 27 yards for a TD. Player of the Game: {b]Donovan McNabb[/b] throwing for 269 yards and 3 TDs. Best defender: CB Al Harris with 3 pass defenses.\n\nWe get a bye week and that's good enough to make LT Tra Thomas Probable, much to Donovan McNabb's relief.\n\nPhiladelphia 31 Chicago 29\n\nThe game wasn't as close as it looked. The Bears added a late touchdown just outside the two minute warning and couldn't stop us on the final drive. WR Torrance Small had 105 yards and a TD on just 4 catches and MLB Jeremiah Trotter just went off - 15 tackles, 3 assists, 2 sacks, a forced fumble and a hurry, while DE Hugh Douglas shot through for 6 tackles, 3 assists, 3 sacks and 3 knockdowns.\n\nHow good is our 7-1 mark? So good that we won as many games in a half season as we won all of McNabb's rookie year. We're also #2 in the NFC, behind 8-0 Green Bay. Baltimore's the 8-0 team in the league. But we're only a game behind 6-2 Dallas, while New York and Washington are slumming in 3-5 territory.\n\nThe usual midseason report next.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nLast edited by Izulde : 12-27-2009 at 09:17 PM.\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nA Beautiful First Half\n\nAlthough QB Donovan McNabb is known for his running talents, he's focused on passing this season\n\nWhat a difference a year makes. A season removed from 8-8 and the Philadelphia Eagles have flown to the top of the NFC East, boasting an impressive 7-1 midpoint mark that all but guarantees them a playoff spot after falling short the last two years.\n\nMuch of the magical turnaround can be attributed to third year QB Donovan McNabb, who has far surpassed even the most optimistic preseason prognosticators with a blistering first half: 192/274, a 70.1% completion rate, for 2,213 yards, 21 TDs and 10 INTs. To put that more in perspective, McNabb had just 26 TD passes all of last season.\n\nWhile WR Plaxico Burress is on pace for another 1,000 yard season and has 7 TD catches, it's a deep and balanced receiving corps that deserves a lot of the credit for McNabb's evolution into one of the NFL's best signalcallers. A small nod deserves to be given to RB Michael Bennett as well, as the rookie is on track to crack 1,000 rushing yards, a mark never achieved by Duce Staley, who never even reached 900 in the last two seasons.\n\nThe offense as a whole is a firecracker unit, second in the league in scoring at 29.5 points a game and #1 in third down conversion at 51.5%, helped greatly by an offensive line that's done a superlative job of protecting McNabb, despite missing LT Tra Thomas for most of the first half.\n\nAlthough the defense hasn't been as sterling as the offense, a few Eagles are having standout seasons on that side of the ball. MLB Jeremiah Trotter is on pace for 100 tackle season with 53 tackles, 13 assists, 3 sacks, a hurry and 3 pass defenses. DE Hugh Douglas, despite missing two games, already has 6 sacks, besting his previous two seasons and CB Troy Vincent looks five years younger, with an impressive 4 interceptions and 8 pass defenses already to his credit.\n\nCode:\n\n2001 Summary for Philadelphia Eagles Philadelphia Eagles Team Rank Rushes per Game 27.5 12 (T) Rushing Yards 109.9 12 Yards Per Carry 4.00 16 Pass Attempts 34.3 17 Completions 24.0 4 Completion Pct. 70.1 3 Passing Yards 276.6 5 Yards Per Attempt 8.08 5 Yards Per Catch 11.53 11 Total Yardage Gained 378.1 4 3rd Down Conversions 51.5 1 Points Per Game 29.5 2 Pass Rush Pct. 22.5 5 (T) Pass Defense Pct. 47.1 19 Turnovers 15 19 (T) Turnover Margin -5 24 (T) Opponents Team Rank Rushes per Game 23.1 5 Rushing Yards 110.1 17 Yards Per Carry 4.76 31 Pass Attempts 40.4 31 Completions 24.6 30 Completion Pct. 61.0 10 Passing Yards 262.5 28 Yards Per Attempt 6.50 7 Yards Per Catch 10.66 10 Total Yardage Gained 356.8 28 3rd Down Conversions 39.0 20 Points Per Game 24.1 26 Pass Rush Pct. 13.7 1 (T) Pass Defense Pct. 36.9 5 Turnovers 10 26 (T) Week Team Versus Oppnt 1 28 at NYK 27 2 23 DEN 16 3 34 at SEA 13 4 31 MIN 28 5 41 DET 26 6 10 at GBY 30 7 38 at WAS 24 9 31 at CHI 29 10 NYK 11 at DAL 12 KCY 13 TBY 14 at OAK 15 DAL 16 at SDO 17 WAS Passing Pos Att Comp Yards Y/Att TD Int Rate 11 D.

Donovan McNabb's Player of the Game with a modest 208 yards and 2 TDs on 20/28 passing, while DE Hugh Douglas racks up another 2 sacks and CB Phillipi Sparks picks up 2 pass defenses.\n\nPhiladelphia 34 Dallas 17\n\nSo much for the Cowboys threat. We clinch a winning record and guarantee that we'll improve on last year's mark as Donovan McNabb rips loose for 375 yards and 4 TDs on 24/34 passing, the best outing of his career. WR Torrance Small grabs 6 balls for 116 yards and WR Plaxico Burress has 5 catches for 99 yards and a TD.\n\nKansas City 14 Philadelphia 42\n\nCB Phillipi Sparks returns an interception for a 17 yard TD, but the game's real story is RB Michael Bennett ripping up the Chiefs for 124 rushing yards and a TD on 21 carries. DE Hugh Douglas officially becomes the first player of my regime to hit double-digit sacks in a season as he tallies 2 sacks, 5 hurries and 3 knockdowns. Three defensive players deflect 2 passes: Sparks, CB Troy Vincent, and, of all people, DT Shaun Rogers.\n\nTampa Bay 10 Philadelphia 24\n\nDonovan McNabb goes 25/32 for 306 yards, 2 TDs and an INT, the bulk of the yardage going to WR Torrance Small on 6 catches for 106 yards. DE Hugh Douglas continues his nonstop motor with 5 tackles, an assist, 2.5 sacks, a block, 5 hurries and 3 knockdowns and CB Troy Vincent defends 2 passes.\n\nPhiladelphia 17 Oakland 14\n\nThe Raiders throw a scare into us, but we overcome 3 interceptions by Donovan McNabb thanks to our defense. CB Phillipi Sparks piles on 11 tackles and 2 assists, but it's MLB Jeremiah Trotter who wins PotG with 6 tackles, 3 assists, 2 sacks and a block.\n\nThe good news? We clinch the NFC East with the narrow win.\n\nThe bad news? The effing Packers are 13-0.\n\nSLB Mike Caldwell strains his knee and is questionable for 4 weeks. We cut MLB Pete Monty and sign OLB Scott Gaylon, who not only takes a spot as reserve linebacker, but earns gunner duties on special teams.\n\nDallas 24 Philadelphia 51\n\nFun game if you like lots of scoring, and I do. RB Michael Bennett carries the ball 29 times for 139 yards and 3 rushing TDs and QB Donovan McNabb puts up 329 yards and 2 TDs on 20/28 passing. WR Plaxico Burress and WR Torrance Small post matching 94 yard games, with Small bettering Burress by a TD catch. CB Al Harris provided the defensive fireworks with 2 interceptions.\n\nOur linebacking injuries mount, as MLB Jeremiah Trotter strains his Abdomen and is Doubtful for 3 weeks. DT Dixon Cassidy gets a late-season pink slip to give us the free space to ink veteran MLB Rob Holmberg, who becomes the backup to MLB Barry Gardner and fills in the goal-line package.\n\nPhiladelphia 21 San Diego 6\n\nThe Chargers are terrible, and WR Plaxico Burress ignites for 101 yards and 2 TDs on 5 catches. But what gives me the biggest smile is DE John Abraham winning Player of the Game with 2 tackles, 3 assists, 2.5 sacks, a hurry and fumble recovery. Way to start earning your first round status, John! CB Phillipi Sparks continues his stellar season in an Eagles uniform with 4 pass defenses and S Damon Moore deflects 2 attempts of his own.\n\nSLB Mike Caldwell is back to Probable, but C Hank Fraley hyperextends his elbow and will miss the last regular season game. We've clinched at least a #2 seed, but the bleeping Packers are 15-0 and will be the #1 seed because they beat us, even if they lose.\n\nC Bubba Miller finally gets to start, with C Brian Williams the backup.\n\nWashington 6 Philadelphia 32\n\nThe Redskins came into this game with every incentive to beat us, in hopes of getting to the playoffs. Donovan McNabb has other ideas, completing 22 of 29 passes for 252 yards and 2 TDs to go with S Brian Dawkins's 3 pass defenses.\n\n...Wow. The Packers tied the Vikings 14-14 to technically go undefeated, but they don't have a 1.000 record either.\n\nBut that's not the biggest wow. The biggest wow is...\n\nLT Tra Thomas breaks his clavicle and is done for the year.\n\nNot a good way to go into the playoffs.\n\n__________________\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Nominee\n\n2006 Golden Scribe Winner\n\nBest Non-Sport Dynasty: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nRookie Writer of the Year\n\nDynasty of the Year: May Our Reign Be Green and Golden (CK Dynasty)\n\nHead Coach\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nHearst's 49ers To Battle Eagles In Divisional Round\n\n49ers RB Garrison Hearst rushed for over 1,500 yards in the regular season\n\nDefense and turnovers led the San Francisco 49ers to a 20-3 wildcard victory over the NFC South champion Carolina Panthers, but they'll have a much stiffer test against in Philadelphia against the Eagles, who have a much higher octane offense and deeper all-around talent.\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nJeff Garcia had his second straight 3500 yard season in his third year in the league. Not a good touchdown generator, though, and his 17 TDs to 14 INTs in the regular season was merely ordinary. Has the grittiness to engineer a comeback, though, with 5 4th quarter come-from-behinds in 36 games. 4th round rookie Marques Tuiasosopo is the backup.\n\nDonovan McNabb exploded this season, throwing for 4,383 yards and 40 TDs to just 15 picks. Most importantly, he cut down his fumble numbers from 7 in his first two seasons to just one this year. There's no question he's one of the league's elite. Second year Joe Hamilton has yet to throw a pass in the regular season.\n\n[i]Advantage: Eagles\n\nRunning Backs\n\nGarrison Hearst ran for 1,534 yards and 12 TDs and caught 57 passes for 476 yards during the regular season, but also coughed the ball up 7 times and was largely contained by the Panther defense. Backup Charlie Garner just missed the 500 yard mark with 495 and has been a lock for 4 yards a carry on the button this year and last since losing his starting spot to Hearst.\n\n2nd round rookie Michael Benntt proved a pleasant surprise with 1,184 yards and 10 TDs to just 2 fumbles. #2 man Duce Staley was rejuvenated by taking the backup role and ran for 549 yards and 6 TDs.\n\n[i]Advantage: Draw\n\nWide Receivers\n\nThe 49ers have one of the top wideouts in the league in WR Terrell Owens, who extended his 1,000+ yard season streak to three with a 91 catch, 1,227 yard, 7 TD regular season effort. They'll need T.O. to step up even more, because starting SE Tai Streets and #3 WR Curtis Conway will both miss this game with injuries. That means a likely start for 2nd round pick WR Drew Bennett and TE Gary Clark, who had a career-high 38 catches for 321 yards in the regular season.\n\n2nd year WR Plaxico Burress showed no sophomore slump, catching 67 balls for 1,150 yards and 10 TDs to just 3 drops. Although not as illustrious as Owens, he's got a better QB throwing to him. WR Torrance Small just missed the 1,000 yard mark with 58 receptions for 962 yards and 6 TDs. WR Andre Hastings was an absolute free agent steal as the third receiver, picking up 725 yards and 9 TDs on 52 catches. TE Anthony Becht had a season virtually identical to Clark's, with 35 receptions for 326 yards.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\nOffensive Line\n\nLT Todd Wade gave up 9 sacks in his second season, his first as the starter, but RT Derrick Deese bounced back after a poor season last year. C Jeremy Newberry is solid, but not spectacular. First round pick LG Rick De Mulling had a great rookie campaign, converting 32.9% of his key run blocks and giving up just 1 sack with a pancake block thrown besides. RG Jeff Buckey is a major overachiever who plays far beyond his limited talents.\n\nThe big story for the Eagles, of course, is that they'll be without LT Tra Thomas, although he may make it back for the Super Bowl, should Philadelphia get that far. In his place will be T Leon Searcy, who filled in well for Thomas earlier in the season. 6th round pick RT Kenyatta Jones surrendered 3 sacks in 6 starts but showed flashes of becoming a legitimate run-blocker. 4th round steal C Hank Fraley will be back for this game and he'll provide a major boost to the line. LG John Welbourn is one of the more underrated players in the league and RG Al Jackson would be better off on the left side.\n\nAdvantage: Draw\n\nDefensive Line\n\nSan Francisco runs a 3-4 and feature a great DT in NT Bryant Young, a 1st Team All-Pro last season. LDE Chike Okeafor was slowed by injuries this season, but has some pass rush ability. RDE Martin Harrison, now in his 12th season, is too old to be an effective starter anymore.\n\nThe Eagles' 4-3 is powered by its defensive ends. LDE Hugh Douglas broke out for 51 tackle, 18 sack, 34 hurry, 24 knockdown season despite missing 2 games with injuries and RDE John Abraham also blossomed with the change in defenses, rebounding from an awful rookie year to rack up 8 sacks and 36 hurries. 1st round pick LDT Shaun Rogers is raw, but should be solid if he can avoid injuries, while RDT Eric Swann is a talented pass-rusher, when he's not hurt.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\nLinebackers\n\nA pair of very good OLBs in SLB Marcus Washington, a late 3rd round pick a year ago, and WLB Jeff Posey, headline the 49er linebacking corps. Washington and Posey both had 60 tackle seasons, with Washington grabbing 8 sacks and 2 picks besides and Posey sacking the QB 10 times. SILB Winifred Tubbs tore his patellar tendon and will likely miss all of next year in addition to the rest of this season, which means SILB Chris Draft and WILB Corey Widmer, roster fillers both, will have to take up the slack.\n\nSLB Quentin Coryatt has been a huge disappointment in an Eagles uniform, but MLB Jeremiah Trotter is developing a reputation as a tackle machine after 81 tackles and 5 sacks in 14 games as the key cog in the new defensive scheme. WLB Ike Reese lost his sack numbers due to the scheme switch, but he's still good for 50+ tackles a year.\n\nAdvantage: Draw\n\nSecondary\n\nSS Reggie Tongue just missed his third straight year of 100+ tackles with 97, but made up for it with 5 interceptions. FS Zack Bronson is solid as well, but the corners leave something to be desired, as neither [b]CB R.W. McQuarters[/b or CB Nate Clements, nor nickel back Monty Montgomery impress.\n\nFS Brian Dawkins had his third straight 80+ tackle season, but he forced just one fumble during the regular season. SS Damon Moore picked off 4 passes, but he was beaten out for the team lead by ageless CB Troy Vincent, who had 5 interceptions and 12 pass defenses. RCB Al Harris had a solid season, while nickel CB Phillipi Sparks led the team in tackles with 89 and also had 3 interceptions to his credit.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIt's hard to see an area where the 49ers can legitimately shut down the Eagles. Terrell Owens is an elite talent of course, and so is Garrison Hearst, but the Eagles we"
