        "text": "January 1, 1902 - Tournament Park, Pasadena, California - The first bowl game was played. According to an NCAA.com article, it started as the centerpiece of the \"Tournament of Roses,\" a yearly festival by the Valley Hunt Club that began in 1890. Before the advent of the football game, the parade staged events like tugs-of-war, polo matches, and even greased-pig catching. The game's name was changed to the Rose Bowl Game starting with the 1923 Rose Bowl when it moved to the newly constructed Rose Bowl Stadium. In the contest, the Michigan Wolverines blew out the Stanford Cardinal 49-0. Wolverine standout and future Hall of Fame inductee Willie Heston rushed for 170 yards in the contest, setting a record that lasted for 57 years. Michigan only had 12 points scored against it all season long, including this game!\n\nJanuary 1, 1919 - 5th Rose Bowl Great Lakes, US Navy beats Mare Island, USMC, 17-0 per the Onthisday.com website. The game’s Most Valuable Player was a US Naval player named George Halas.\n\nJanuary 1, 1926 - Pasadena, California - The first game was officially called the Rose Bowl when it entered its new stadium venue of the same name. Remember that the Rose Bowl was the only Bowl game back in this era, and it was a big deal for Alabama to get the invite; in fact they were the first southern to play in the Rose Bowl. The University of Washington was a powerhouse as they were led by their star halfback, George Wildcat Wilson. In the game, it was Wilson's dominant performance for much of the first half of the \"Grand Daddy of them All\" had opponent Alabama on their heels and down by a couple of scores. The Crimson Tide got a break late in the second quarter when George Wilson left the game due to injury. The Tide rolled, led by Johnny Mack Brown, with 20 unanswered points and were driving down the field to score again when the banged-up Wildcat Wilson re-entered the contest and was significant in shutting down the 'Bama drive at the Husky 12-yard line. Wilson then guided the Washington offense down the field and capped off the drive with Wilson throwing a 20-yard scoring strike to John Cole. It was not enough as the Tide held on to win the game 20-19. The stat line of the game showed that with Wilson on the field, the Washington Huskies gained 317 yards and put up 19 points. When he was out, they mustered a mere 17 yards and were shut out, while the Crimson Tide scored all 20 of their points in that 22-minute absence of Wilson from the contest. It put Alabama football on the map as a major power in the college football landscape. The game was good as upstart Alabama defeated the favorites, Washington, 20-19. This game is often referred to as the Game that Changed the South. Many gridiron history experts recognize it as the most crucial game in southern football history.\n\nJanuary 1, 1935 - 1st Sugar Bowl: Tulane beats Temple, 20-14\n\nJanuary 1, 1935 - 1st Orange Bowl: Bucknell beats Miami (FL), 26-0\n\nJanuary 1, 1937 - La Tropicale Stadium, Havana, Cuba - Auburn University plays in its first post-season bowl appearance. The Bacardi Bowl in 1937 saw the Tigers lock up with the good Villanova team as the game ended in a 7-7 stalemate. The Bacardi Bowl took place on seven different occasions throughout history. The games were also referred to as the Rhumba Bowl and were the climaxing event of Cuba’s annual National Sports Festival. The first five Rhumba Bowls pitted one of the US teams of the south against a Cuban university squad.

Oregon State College surprised everyone as they won the Pacific Coast Conference champion­ship. The Golden Rankings website details how the Beavers won their final five games to earn their first-ever trip to the Rose Bowl. As was the custom at the time, the PCC champion picked its opponent for the game in Pasadena. The Golden Gophers of Minnesota was the logical choice as they were tops in all the polls, but they were prohibited from playing in a bowl game by the predecessor of the Big 10, the Western Conference rules at the time. So Oregon State chose the next best team, Duke, who was second in most rank­ings. Many Duke fans booked their travel plans as they got a sweet deal of round-trip train fare, accommodations in California, tickets to the big game, and a free stop at the Grand Canyon for under $182. Sign me up! However, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 launched the U.S. into World War II. Not even a week later, fearing Japanese attacks on the West Coast, the military leaders shut down all major sporting events, including the Rose Bowl. That was when the teams and the Rose Bowl committee got their heads together and decided the game must go on, and they switched the venue to Wallace Wade Stadium, Durham, North Carolina. This contest was the only Rose Bowl Game ever played outside Pasadena (until 2020). It was a pretty good game too, but we will let Golden Rankings fill you in on that part.

According to the American Football Database it was USC who would end up the victors in a high scoring affair, 42 to 37 over the Badgers.
