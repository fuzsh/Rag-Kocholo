        "text": "BARI\n\nThe city of Bari, a place that flies under the average tourist’s radar, is much more than a capital city of the gorgeous Puglia region, or just a departure port for ferries crossing the Adriatic. I first thought I would visit Bari for a few hours, then want to quickly descend into the rest of Puglia to enjoy the quaint coastal towns and to escape urban hustle. Following an exciting first afternoon exploring Bari, I decided to stay a few additional days to soak it all up. Below are some takeaways from this recent stay.\n\nJust The Right Size For Walking\n\nBari is a lovely medium-sized city (approx 300k); large enough to support excellent culinary and cultural options (including Teatro Petruzzelli, an ornate Theater-Opera house!), but also small and flat enough you can do it all on foot. The city sits directly on the Adriatic Sea, and is so pedestrian friendly they have even preserved and converted their ancient fortress/sea wall into the easily accessible pedestrian walkway, Via Venezia. This elevated pedestrian path allows you to encircle the old town while also looking out at the sea. You will find locals walking here and enjoying the dolce vita at all hours, but especially in the evenings where even on the most random weeknight, you will find thriving local life enjoying their gorgeous city.\n\nMemorable Food\n\nWe know Italy has some of the best food around. This is true in Puglia and well-on-display throughout Bari. If you’re really interested in Italian pasta, you may have heard about the famous Pasta Grannies. Bari has a bunch of these internationally celebrated women who spend their days opening up their homes, setting out tables, and allowing pedestrians to sample and purchase freshly formed pasta like the famous Apuglian ear-shaped orecchiette.\n\nThere are several other special foods found easily directly from these street vendors: Fried polenta (sgagliozza), warm Barisian foccacia bread with cherry tomatoes, crispy rolled taralli bread, or deep-fried panzerotti (similar to a calzone), and others.\n\nClassic Coffee & Pastry Bars\n\nSomething I love to do when visiting any new town is to figure out a list of all the best coffee shops. Sometimes that can look like sitting down with a colorful mug of 3rd Wave filtered coffee, delivered by hipsters in over-sized sweatshirts. But in Italy, I prefer to go where the old-timers go: an classic cafe or pastry shop. Bari is no exception to the Italian cafe stereotype you may be imagining, and you can easily discover these atmospheric cafe counters, where sharply-dressed baristas efficiently serve a line of locals, standing confidently with an espresso cup in hand. You have little choice but to join in on the tradition and leave your comfort zone behind.\n\nMy favorite spot in Bari is Pasticceria Rex dal 1960 with a close second going to Boccia Pasticceria (both pictured below).\n\nLocal Street Culture\n\nI touched on in the city’s walkability, but something you pick up on as you cross town multiple times are some unique aspects of a city’s street culture. In Bari, the city isn’t yet taken over by tourism. There are still old Italian families living on the small streets of the ancient city’s interior. And those people live out on the streets in a way I haven’t often seen in a capital city. You will see families extending their living rooms out onto the city streets. They use mops to clean the gorgeous stone streets, placing out dining and card tables, leaving children’s toys out, and of course decorating the walls outside their front doors with personal and local items such as flowering cactus leaves, religious figures, ribbons, and balloons.\n\nHistory\n\nAs a port city on the Adriatic sea, Bari has a long history, touched by many cultures, but mainly that of old Greek and Roman rule. Bari is currently home to the giant 11th-century Basilica di San Nicola, a key pilgrimage site, that still holds the remains of St. Nicholas. The old town is full of reminders of the past, all on open public display: from incredibly narrow streets, to countless ancient chapels and unmarked hefty columns preserved in place after old roofs and walls proved less sturdy. Also, you can find reused stone relics from these lost walls, like a carving of Mother Mary placed randomly on its side to construct a back alley stairwell. Even a section of ancient Roman road sits unearthed. So many opportunities to reach out and touch history.\n\nLocation Location Location\n\nPuglia may seem a little isolated when you look at the map, but don’t let that discourage you. Located southeast from most of Italy’s major tourist spots, it could be considered a trek when compared to other accessible tourist zones throughout Italy. But, if you are coming from Rome, there are frequent fast trains to Bari, and in just 4 relaxing hours (I suggest reserving the quiet train car), you will walk out into another world that is Puglia, and the zany crowds of Rome will quickly fade into memory. Bari and Brindisi also host small airports if you’re hoping to Puglia from another city in Europe, but I came directly by train from Florence and found the trip enjoyable. I suggest using Bari as a base for exploring the smaller coastal and mountain towns of Pulgia. Day trip-worthy hot-spots include Monopoli, Polignano a Mare, Alberobello, Ostuni, Lecce, and Matera.\n\nWhen to Visit Puglia\n\nI found a way to make this wonderful place even better: visit in October. After two weeks of exploration around Italy by train this October, I don’t think I will ever return in any another season. Olives are starting to drop from the trees, weather is ideal, and it’s noticeably less crowded. Unless you’re a fan of sweating through multiple shirts a day or are searching for holiday markets, just trust me on this one and book your next trip in October.\n\nI spent a summer studying in Italy as a college student, and I recall the pleasure — and also the absolute need— for mid-day naps. This wonderful Italian tradition serves as a cool escape from the intimidating strength of the southern summer sunshine. While naps are fun, sunny days that don’t absolutely destroy your energy levels are infinitely better when you actually want to explore all that Italy has to offer. I would gladly trade long, scorching summer days for 70 degree comfort. This is what I found all over Italy in October, but especially in the southern area of Puglia, where the beaches were still gorgeous and warm, but didn’t make me want to nap under the shade of the nearest beach cave.\n\nSeattle, famous for its coffee obsession, offers a shocking number of excellent spots to grab a cuppa. My sister lives in Seattle and during my visits, I carve out plenty of time for coffee-sampling across town. On a recent visit to the Emerald City, I arrived determined to discover only the best-of-the-best in Seattle’s modern coffee scene.\n\nI’m happy to report that I returned to New York on quite the caffeine buzz, and really excited to publish these findings.\n\nCoffee and a Snack\n\nIf you’re like me, you head to a coffee shop to experience both coffee and a nibble. More often than not, that equation involves fresh pastry.\n\nBelow are my favorite coffee shops in Seattle that serve up both excellent coffee and house-made pastry options, too!\n\nCoyle’s Bakeshop: 8300 Greenwood Ave N, Seattle, WA 98103\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts, with an impressive history as a lasting academic center in United States higher education, has long attracted intellectuals and artists from around the world. As English America’s first planned village, founded in 1630, and home to America’s oldest University (Harvard), the area deserves a visit for anyone interested in American history or fantastic bookstores (shout-out to Harvard Bookstore!).\n\nFortunately, Harvard Square, the area of Cambridge that surrounds Harvard University, has an appeal that far surpasses a typical college town. After living within the bounty of New York City for several years, I still think fondly of the 6 years I lived in Cambridge. Balancing both its fascinating history and now, a quality food scene, Harvard Square is an enriching place to spend a few days.\n\nPinocchio's Pizza & Subs - Best Slice\n\nYou may find yourself just hungry enough to indulge in a slice of pizza on the go. If this occurs during your stay in Cambridge, you should absolutely head to Pinocchio’s. You’ll be met by hilarious painted wall murals and an eclectic selection of old photographs. Local celebrities Mark Wahlberg, Ben Affleck, and Matt Damon apparently stop here, so if that convinces you to try it, then cool! For the rest of you, you’ll just have to trust me.\n\n74 Winthrop St, Cambridge, MA 02138\n\nTatte Bakery & Café - Best Pastry\n\nI didn’t want to include Tatte on this list, as they started opening in the Boston area after I moved away, but after just a couple visits, I was won over. Stepping into their Harvard Square cafe, you will notice a buzz that can only come from serving up the very best. Just try walking past their cases full of fresh-baked pastries and pies — you won’t make it out of here the same weight as you walked in.\n\n1288 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138\n\nNew York City offers just about everything in the area of baked goods. Finding the perfect spot for a sweet, bready treat should not be a hard task, but there are a many mediocre places to sift through before finding the true gems.\n\nThis list below names not only my favorite shops that produce their own baked goods, but also places that have one or two specialty treats that I deem go above and beyond the competition.\n\nBourke Street Bakery - Ginger Brûlée Tart\n\nThis bakery is a relatively new competitor to the NYC scene. However, back in Sydney, Australia, the quality of Bourke Street is well known. Located just north of Madison Square Park, between Flatiron and Koreatown, this bakery is central, as well as spacious. I was surprised to see how much quality seating they provide for the bakery visit when you absolutely cannot wait another minute to eat your treats.\n\n15 E 28th St, New York, NY 10016\n\nWilliam Greenberg Desserts - Black & White Cookie\n\nThere’s been a lot of attention given to the traditional New York cookie known as the “black and white”. And while everyone may have their go-to spot, I can say I’ve tried more than most and the only ones I keep coming back to are the cookies at William Greenberg. I’ve made it a tradition of sorts, each visit I pay to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I swing by William Greenberg to grab a B&W. Special shout out to their red velvet variety.\n\n1100 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10028\n\nBreads Bakery - Babka\n\nBreads sure did its best to turn me off at first. Located next to Union Square and The New School, every visit was annoyingly crowded with students and made me wonder what the appeal was all about. Then, thankfully, I was pointed in the direction of their chocolate babka. I stopped by one morning before the students were awake, and ate some of the best babka in existence. Now I get it. And thankfully, they’ve opened a few additional locations.\n\n18 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003\n\nThe Hungarian Pastry Shop - Napoleon Pastry\n\nThis shop makes my top 10 list for so many reasons: 1) Nerdy Columbia students who sit here wishing they were studying abroad in Europe. 2) Producers of desserts you don’t find in most other bakeries. 3) Old-school service with white takeaway boxes and red string. 4) Located across the street from the massive Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. And finally, 5) a baked creation called a Napoleon pastry. Beige in color, you might not understand the appeal of this mille-feuille creation at first, but once you get a bite of the frosted, crunchy layers with an overflowing custard middle, you will begin planning more weekend excursions to Morningside Heights.\n\n1030 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10025\n\nFirst of all, it must be said that the recipe for Pastéis de Nata originates in Lisbon’s Belém neighborhood, as a centuries-old creation by Catholic monks at the beautiful Mosteiro dos Jerónimos. It’s rumored the monastery created these crispy-custard tarts seeking a way to use discarded egg yokes, using the egg whites to starch their clothing. The egg pastry creation became popular in Portugal, then spread to other places worldwide, notably in parts of Japan, India, and Brazil. The Fábrica de Pastéis de Belém cafe was first opened in 1837 by direct descendants of the original monastery producers, and has baked top-notch pastry on-site ever since.\n\nMaking the trip to Belém, an easy 20-minute bus ride west of Lisbon center, is a must on any Lisbon itinerary. The breathtaking Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, Padrão dos Descobrimentos, Torre de Belém, MAAT and Museu Nacional dos Coches are all essential sites worthy of your consideration. Since you’ll already be in Belém, you have no excuse to skip the historic Pastéis de Belém cafe. Unless you’re deterred by the inevitable line of tourists. Fear not; the line moves fast and you’ll have a hot pastry in hand in no time.\n\nThe Pastéis de Belém tarts are delicious, but does the pioneer producer still bake up the best pastéis in Lisbon today?\n\nIn the lively Chiado neighborhood of central Lisbon, you will find a relatively new producer of pastéis de nata, Manteigaria. The cafe is small, but visiting promises to be both educational and fun. There is seldom a line, and after ordering with the cashier, you can step into the cafe and eat while watching pastry chefs making the coveted tarts up close. While Belém keeps their process in a shroud of mystery, Manteigaria kindly lets you in on the secret. And it’s this confidence and immediate access to the chef’s kitchen, not to mention a central city location that stays open until midnight, that pushes some pastry connoisseurs towards Manteigaria as the winner of the tart rivalry.\n\nWe are all influenced by an excellent customer service experience, but this rivalry should probably come down to the flavor experience, right? Both producers of pastéis de nata have a wonderful crispy pastry crust, but there is a subtle difference in the custard. In my opinion, Manteigaria is ever-so-slightly more flavorful. I have a hunch that this rivalry will never have a clear winner due to the high quality and distinct customer experiences at both producers, but there is plenty of room for competition in this booming tourist town. I’m pleased to let them both share the stage.\n\nWhy not do your very own taste test and let me know which pastéis de nata producer wins over your taste buds in the comments below!\n\nPASTRY SHOP LOCATIONS\n\nManteigaria: Rua do Loreto 2, 1200-108 Lisboa, Portugal\n\nPastéis de Belém: R. de Belém 84-92, 1300-085 Lisboa, Portugal\n\nOTHER ATTRACTIONS MENTIONED\n\nMAAT: Av.
