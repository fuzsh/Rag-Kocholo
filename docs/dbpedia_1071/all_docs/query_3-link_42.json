        "text": "Last spring, shortly before Paul Simon began rehearsing his band for a tour of Europe, he wrote three fragments of music—the first to occur to him in a year and a half. It was as long a dry period as he had ever been through. I went one night to a baseball game with him, and, going home in his car, he said, “The melodies have started to come. It’s a relief.”\n\nSongwriters sometimes describe the sensation of songs arriving nearly intact. Simon has had this experience (the shower, “Still Crazy After All These Years”), but not often. His talent is more the patient and painstaking kind than the ecstatic. Songwriting, he says, is “trial and error repeated almost endlessly.” A song usually takes him three months to finish. Typically, when he concludes a body of work, he thinks that he has depleted his resources, and that they won’t be replenished. “I always feel that the situation is serious,” he said in the car. “I’m in a vacuum, it’s a dearth, and then there’s something—a few notes, a phrase—and I say, ‘I guess there’s something,’ but it’s so small that I don’t even know whether to count it.”\n\nSimon regards writing songs as the effort to find form for sounds he hears in his head. “Maybe ten, fifteen years ago,” he said, “I realized that what I was fascinated with, couldn’t explain, was *sound—*that you can’t really say why a combination of sounds is moving or feels really good and right—and the whole game was: Can I get the sounds in my head on tape?” His driver brought the car to a stop at a light. Simon looked out the window. “I should get ready to work,” he said softly. “You go into training—you play more, think more, listen more—instead of fretting over why you’re not hearing the melodies.”\n\nTo rehearse, Simon put the new work aside. The last time he did that, three years ago, he had five songs under way when he left them to prepare for a tour with Bob Dylan. Several months passed, the tour was over. Visiting a friend in New Mexico, he listened to recordings of the songs—he hadn’t yet written any words—and was very pleased. Then he realized that he no longer felt any vestige of the impulse that had supplied them.\n\n“I thought they had come from an inspired place,” he said, “and I was just furious with myself for interrupting the work. What a fool I’d been, I thought, because I had just arrogantly assumed that the inspiration would return when I wanted it to. Then I thought, God, I have to get the rest. Because five tracks is only half an album. Of course five songs is half an album, but what if the point was: This was a level of joy in creating that you always hoped to attain. You think the experience involves ten because you need ten for the marketplace. Maybe you should just appreciate the experience, maybe that was the point, and there won’t be any more.” He sighed. “Anyway, another couple of months went by. I just had to wait.”\n\nThe feeling of joy eventually returned. Many of the lyrics uncharacteristically came to him so quickly that he felt as if he were “taking dictation.” After he had recorded the songs (on “You’re the One,” his latest CD, released in 2000), he took the tapes to Los Angeles and played them for the executives at his record company. “They were nice, respectful—it’s a great honor and so on—but they didn’t actually understand,” he said. “Or at least I thought they didn’t understand. That record was hypnotic, in its way, and they were thinking more about ‘speed and impact.’ ”\n\nOn his way home, Simon stopped at his friend’s house in New Mexico, and while he was there the company’s response began to unsettle him. “I thought, Why am I so desperately wanting to enter the marketplace? And then I said to myself, with a couple of synaptic leaps that I’m leaving out, ‘You’re just a big liar. And I know what the lie is.’ ” The voice reprimanding him had the tone of an Old Testament figure. “ ‘This is Judgment Day, and there’s no defense,’ it announced. ‘I’m going to tell you a deep truth, and you’re going to listen.You made this thing that you received partly as a gift, and you took it immediately to the marketplace without sufficiently appreciating it. And when you intuited that the marketplace wasn’t going to accept it you knew right away that you had no business taking such a thing there. The gift was the point.’ ”\n\nSimon paused. “It got worse,” he went on. “ ‘You don’t like that?’ the voice said. ‘Then atone. Be a better person. You’re lucky that this didn’t occur on your deathbed, so that it would be the last thought you had.’ ’’\n\nSeveral weeks went by before something in him relaxed, and he thought, You exaggerate. You were born with a talent and you worked hard at it, and the result gave people a lot of pleasure, and no matter what you did that was wrong you can’t throw that out. You didn’t do it to give people pleasure. You did it to see if you could make the sounds in your imagination come out on tape.\n\nThe insight was followed, even so, by the year and a half of drought, during which Simon couldn’t listen to anyone’s music, especially his own, and he felt that he might not write any songs again.\n\nSimon is less nomadic than musicians often are. What keeps him mostly at home is his wife, the singer Edie Brickell, who is from Texas, and their three young children. Nevertheless, he travels frequently. Last spring, he and his family spent ten days in Jamaica; he went to London for a week to visit Harper, his oldest son, from his first marriage, who plays guitar in a rock-and-roll band; he went to Memphis to meet Joseph Shabalala, the leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Zulu singing group that appears on Simon’s 1986 album “Graceland”; he went a few times to his house by the ocean at the eastern end of Long Island; he made trips to Connecticut to see how the contractors were doing in renovating a house that he was moving to in the fall so that his children could have a life in the country; and he and his wife went to Venice to celebrate ten years of marriage. The rest of the time, he kept to a fairly regular schedule. He took the kids to school, then came home and worked with a physical trainer for two and a half hours; then he played guitar, then sometimes he picked up the kids. He has, of course, no material incentive to work. His offspring will be prosperous for generations. He is like the rich painters who have ranches or islands or palazzi and spend their days looking at sketches and patterns of clouds out the window or reading and staring at canvases. The time passes in a manner that is both leisurely and anxious. Eventually, he tells himself, “You’ve got to go to work. Try this, try that—it’s not fun. Who said it was going to be fun? Go to work.”\n\nWhen Simon went to Memphis in May to meet Shabalala, I went, too. Shabalala wants to build a museum devoted to South African music, especially the kind he heard as a child on a farm; he is now sixty. Ladysmith Black Mambazo was performing near Memphis, and Simon thought that visiting the Delta Blues Museum, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, about an hour and a half south of the city, might suggest to Shabalala a plan. Simon also wanted to visit a health clinic in Clarksdale to which he gives a lot of money through the Children’s Health Fund in New York, a charity he started with his friend Dr. Irwin Redlener.\n\nIt was raining when Simon and I left New Jersey in a small jet he had rented. When we got to Memphis, one of those jeeplike cars that make you feel as if you’re seeing everything from the perspective of a man on horseback had been delivered to the terminal for us, and Simon drove. Leaving the airport, he took a wrong turn, and we wandered briefly before finding the tall buildings on the horizon.\n\nHeading toward downtown, Simon described his last trip to Mississippi, some years back. “When I was recording with the Muscle Shoals rhythm section,” he said, “we did this song called ‘Take Me to the Mardi Gras,’ and we wanted to get a Dixieland marching band for it, but we didn’t want to go all the way to New Orleans. We were in Alabama, so we found this band and decided to meet them halfway, in Jackson, Mississippi, at a studio called Malaco Sound. When we get to Jackson, no one knows where Malaco Sound is. I pull into a gas station and ask ‘Does anyone know where Malaco Sound is?’ and a guy leaning on the register with a toothpick in his mouth says slowly, ‘Tell you what. See that there road?’ I turn around, look at the road, say, ‘Yeah, O.K., I see the road.’ ‘Take that there road till you reach a golf field,’ he says. ‘Go past the golf field about a quarter mile, then turn left and come back.’ ‘O.K.,’ I say. ‘In a quarter mile make a right turn,’ he says. ‘That’s the road for Malaco Sound.’ I said, ‘Why don’t you just make a left turn after you pass the golf field?’ And he took the toothpick out of his mouth slowly and started nodding and said, ‘You could do that, too.’ ”\n\nWhen we got to our hotel, Shabalala was sitting in the lobby, at a table by a fountain. He was drinking tea. He is a small, sturdily built man, with a round, open face. He and Simon hugged each other, then the three of us went out and got in the car. Shabalala had brought a tape of South African women singing traditional farm music, without accompaniment. For several of the songs, he had written parts for Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whose ten members are men. The first song, a hymn, was sung in Zulu. Instead of progressing in the stately manner of a Protestant hymn, it advanced like a spiritual, with hesitations in the phrasing and silences between the verses. Six or eight women took part. Their voices were pure and unadorned, and the singing was deeply felt. The men’s voices entered unexpectedly after what I took to be the first verse, answering the women’s, and the contrast between the two registers and textures was thrilling. “I don’t know what I can do with it,” Shabalala said. “I hope I can do something. I’m still working on it.”\n\nWe passed shabby little shopping malls with discount stores and stores selling car parts, several pawnshops, a burial ground next to a junk yard, the Crystal Palace roller-skating rink, and then, as if a piece of stage scenery had been pulled into the wings, we were driving among crop rows that ran on either side of us to the horizon. The road was so straight that it seemed to have been taped onto the fields. The next song was a work song, Shabalala said. Along with the singers, he whistled sharply now and then, like a man calling cattle. “I never heard you do that,” Simon told him. “It’s a good sound for you.”\n\n“There was a young man on the farm where I made the recording,” Shabalala said. “He was playing a five-string guitar, and whistling like that, and he reminded me that I did that when I lived on a farm.”\n\nWe arrived at the museum—a warehouse beside some railroad tracks—around lunchtime. The director, Tony Czech, led us past glass cabinets with guitars and photographs, walls with displays of records, and a room that contained the shack in which Muddy Waters was born. Simon is often regarded uncharitably by musicians who don’t know him. The impression they have is that to make “Graceland” he went to South Africa, bought some records, came home and wrote lyrics, cheated the South African musicians out of royalties, paid up only when called to account, and finally walked into the sunset with boxcars of cash. Anyone who had the idea could have made a fortune from it, they think, and Simon just had it first. I wanted to know what Shabalala thought, so, at a moment when Czech had Simon’s attention, I asked Shabalala when he and Simon had first met.\n\n“Paul came to South Africa in 1985,” he said. “I was on tour. When I called home, my wife tell me that Paul Simon want to talk to me. ‘Are you kidding?’ I say. ‘How can I go to New York? He’s a New York guy.’ She say, ‘No, he’s in Johannesburg. He’s waiting for you.’ But I was in doubt. How does he know me? So I take a car to Johannesburg and somebody lead me to the studio, and I find many people waiting and Paul leading an audition. When I come in, he stop everything, and he say, ‘Joseph, I hear that you are on tour. I’m Paul Simon.’ And I think, Is this him? There are people supposed to talk to Paul, but not me. He say, ‘I love to work with you. I am a fan of Ladysmith Black Mambazo,’ and the way he say it, it was like music, like he was singing it. I discovered in his eyes this man is full of music. And I say, ‘To work together, what is it about, are there songs?’ And he say yes. I say that we should work together, but I didn’t know how. ‘Are we going to blend together? The accent is so different.’ ”\n\nOn “Graceland,” the song “Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes” begins with Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s voices. I asked whose idea that had been. “Paul ask me, ‘Joseph, can you please bless this song?’ ” Shabalala said. “He play it for me, and I listen and said, ‘This song is O.K.’ He say, ‘I still need your blessing,’ so I write five lines in Zulu.”\n\nI asked what they are in English.\n\n“He sing, ‘She’s a rich girl, she don’t try to hide it, diamonds on the soles of her shoes.’ So I answer what he said. ‘It’s not usually so,’ I say, ‘but now we see girls that can afford to maintain themselves.’ ”\n\nTony Czech brought us to a stop in front of a glass cabinet that had in it a National steel guitar—a guitar, that is, with a body made of steel. He opened the case and took the guitar out and handed it to Simon. Simon stood on one foot and balanced the guitar on his raised knee and played a couple of simple blues figures, the way any kid in a guitar store would, and then he moved his hand high up on the neck and played a descending line, a succinct, self-contained remark. He gave the guitar back and had his picture taken with Czech and the cashier at the gift shop; then he bought some CDs—among them one by the blues singer and guitarist Robert Johnson, because Shabalala had never heard him.\n\nFrom the museum, we drove to the health clinic, where we walked through the halls with the director, a woman named Aurelia Jones-Taylor, and doctors and nurses came out of doorways to look at Simon, and a little girl in the waiting room raised her head from her mother’s lap to see what the fuss was about. Then Jones-Taylor took us to lunch at a place called Abe’s BBQ. After lunch, Simon and Shabalala and I made the trip back to Memphis listening to Robert Johnson. I drove and Shabalala sat in the back seat, humming along and every once in a while shouting softly, “Yeah!”\n\nThe next morning, Simon and I flew home through turbulence, and neither of us felt very well when we landed. That night, Simon was travelling to London to visit his son. As Angel Aponte, his driver, was taking us back to the city, I asked about some lines in “Darling Lorraine,” a song on “You’re the One” in which a man and a woman meet, court, marry, squabble, make up, and then the woman falls sick and dies. The narrator, whose manner is evasive, is named Frank. “All my life I’ve been a wanderer,” he sings. Then, “Not really, I mostly lived near my parents’ home.” Describing Lorraine’s death late one night in a hospital bed, Simon sings, “All the trees were washed with April rain/and the moon in the meadow took darling Lorraine.” The lines are the song’s emotional peak, and so mysterious and poetic that I wondered how they had occurred to him.\n\n“It could have been the heavens, I guess, but I used the moon,” he said. “My apartment’s across from the Sheep Meadow, in Central Park, so that’s there. ‘Trees being washed,’ a ritual of death—washing the deceased—but because it’s April it gives you a feeling of the sadness. ‘April is the cruelest month,’ sadness. It wasn’t winter trees—it was the moon in the meadow that had a kind of hopefulness to it that seemed to work.”\n\nA few years ago, Simon was on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” to promote his Broadway musical, “The Capeman,” and Winfrey tried to coax him into saying that he regarded himself as a genius. (She failed.) I asked if the exchange had felt awkward. “I never thought of myself as an artist until I was in my forties,” he said, “and then it was only as a personality type. I thought I was a bright guy, real smart. I could figure stuff out. I was good at things. That’s what I thought, but there were periods when I couldn’t explain what I wrote. I don’t think I’m special, and I never did—I didn’t think, I’m twenty-one and I’ve written ‘The Sound of Silence.’ When I wrote ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water,’ I thought, That’s better than I usually write. As decades go by, you’re grateful for the talent you have, but there’s a time when you just put away your feelings and work. Whoever is sitting at the top of the heap, that’s a genius,” he said disdainfully. “Anyway, I wasn’t ever sitting at the top.”\n\nHe continued, “As you get older, you’re looked at differently. Now I’m ‘legendary.’ It means that kids don’t listen to you as much as you might like, you’re not talking about what they’re interested in, and even if you were they wouldn’t be listening to you any more than kids want to listen to their parents.”\n\nHe shrugged. “Actually, these observations form an internal dialogue of very little consequence, because you’re going to do what you’re going to do anyway. The question I have, though, is when you can create something as complicated rhythmically and thematically as ‘Darling Lorraine,’ how do you measure the quality, especially since the earlier work was enormously popular? I can still put together ‘Darling Lorraine’ or ‘You’re the One.’ It won’t mean as much as ‘Graceland’ or ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water.’ Those songs had an effect on people’s lives. ‘Mrs. Robinson’ or ‘Still Crazy After All These Years,’ or ‘50 Ways’—they’re in the culture. If the work isn’t part of the popular culture, is it as meaningful? Even though there are examples of posthumous recognition, for the most part a song’s a hit or it’s gone.”\n\nThe phone in the car rang, and Simon answered it. He listened for a moment, and then, his voice full of affection—he was speaking to his wife—he said, “Ten minutes. We’re on the West Side Highway.”\n\nAbout a week after Simon got back from London, and shortly before the rehearsals began, I met him at his office in Times Square, where he played a CD he had made of the two fragments he had written—he hadn’t yet written the third. One of the tracks was a slow shuffle, based on the descending line he had played at the Blues Museum, and the other was a briskly rising arpeggiated figure, a series of simple chords—a guitar practice pattern that he had adapted. The playing was skillful and intricate, and I asked why when he performed he let other guitarists play the more complicated parts. “I can’t play and sing,” he said. While I sat and listened to the shuffle, Simon stood behind me and sang nonsense syllables and every once in a while added a line. “Hell, yeah, I’m angry at myself, can’t blame no one else, so I’m angry at myself” is the only one I heard clearly.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he turned off the disk and sat down. “That’s the beginning,” he said. Then he asked, “Do you mind if I play the guitar? I feel more comfortable with a guitar in my hands.” From a closet, he got one and sat down and again played the figure he had played at the museum. “It could go a lot of ways,” he said. “If I added a blues harp, it would sound blues. I could add an acoustic bass. My son Harper thought it might sound good without a bass at all—a guitar record, which I haven’t made in years.”\n\nHe put the guitar down. “A lot of it anyhow is just slogging away,” he said. “The first tracks, when I came out of the studio, I was ambivalent. I went through, first, denial—I don’t think it’s good, but maybe it’s good and people will like it. Then I get to, I don’t care what people think, it’s no good. I have to find somebody to help me fix it, because I don’t know what to do.” He leaned forward and put his elbows on his knees. “I was thinking, I don’t know who’s going to help,” he said, “and when I get over being annoyed I’ll take out everything that I don’t like, then I’ll revise it. I worked with Vincent Nguini, the guitar player in my band, and Steve Gadd, the drummer, and we fixed the guitar part and the drums, and now it’s right. There’s still a section that needs to be improved, and I could easily fool with the bass and play with the sounds of the record, making the arrangements richer, which at least I have a theory about how to do, but since I’m going out on the road again, and the rehearsals are about to start, I’m going to leave it.”\n\nI asked if I could hear the songs once more, and he said sure. “Do you like it with the singing, or no singing?” he asked.\n\nI said I liked the singing.\n\nHe turned the disk back on and began to sing quietly. From the corner of my eye, I watched him dancing, with his feet in place and his arms and shoulders moving in an angular way, as if he were a figure in a hieroglyph.\n\nSimon is the size of a jockey, except that instead of being wiry he is barrel-chested and muscular. His hands are small and thick; they look like paws. His expression is habitually solemn, and it always has been. As a toddler, he smiled so rarely that his parents called him Cardozo, after the Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo, whose manner was pointedly grave. When he went as a child to candy stores to buy comic books, people would say “What’s the matter?” and he always thought, Why do they ask me that? His gestures are minimal and understated, and so is his manner. His sentences trail off and are completed by a slight extension of the chin, a mild widening of the eyes, a delicate shrug. His band members know that the remarks “I don’t think so” or “Yeah, but . . . ,” delivered with no special inflection, amount to an emphatic dismissal. The extravagant subtlety of his manner and movements must once have been a refinement, an awareness that a small man making flamboyant gestures or talking too loudly might look comical. Onstage, he is subdued. He tends to raise his arms and wave his hands wanly—and he probably shouldn’t. He has never been very comfortable with his appearance. A friend of his told me that he won’t look at a photograph of himself. When I asked Simon if this was true, he said, “Yeah,” then added, “Actually, it’s better if you do look, because then you can do something about it.”\n\nHe prefers reading poetry—especially Blake, Yeats, and John Neihardt—to fiction. Fiction writers “are in the world of the imagination,” he says, “and I’m in the world of the imagination, so it’s too much.” He also likes to read “science for the layman, because I was never any good at science, and I’m curious about it now.” Growing up, he was a good baseball player, and is surprised that even though he no longer takes part in the sport he sometimes dreams that he is drawing a walk, or can hit major-league pitching, or that he is standing in the outfield and can’t pick up his feet. “It can go either way,” he says.\n\nFifteen or twenty years ago, he realized that he could recall nearly every piece of music he had heard as a child, and that some of it had found its way into his songs, however obscurely. John Lennon once told him that the BBC didn’t play rock and roll when he was young, but Radio Caroline, the pirate station in the English Channel, did. “It was so far away,” Simon told me, “that the signal would come and go, and the texture of it was something he said he always tried to get into his records.” The rhythms of Elvis Presley’s version of “Mystery Train” turn up again and again in his own writing, he said, each time differently.\n\nAs a singer, Simon is an adept and imaginative phraser, an ability he developed to compensate, he says, “for not having a big voice.” What limits most songwriters’ melodies, he believes, is the reach of their voices, so he takes singing lessons to extend his range. He says that he knows intuitively when a melody is right, but that he is less confident of his lyrics, which he sometimes asks friends to review. Among his contemporaries in popular music, perhaps only Paul McCartney is his peer as a writer of melodies, just as Bob Dylan and, maybe, James Taylor are his only peers as a lyricist. Writing, as John Cheever somewhere remarks, is not a competitive sport, and songwriting isn’t, either. When Simon observes that he wasn’t “at the top of the heap,” he means that no one ever made a fuss over him the way people did over Dylan and the Beatles. The greatest difference among them, as far as I can tell, is that they matured at different times of their lives. Dylan and Lennon and McCartney did most of their memorable work as young men. Also, as young men they were innovators. Simon became an innovator as an older man. The careers of Dylan and McCartney seem circular, in that they both return to forms they have already made use of. Simon’s career seems linear, in that he takes up styles and genres, then discards them, a pattern that he says he learned by observing the career of Miles Davis, with whom he was friends.\n\nAll of these artists are musical opportunists. Dylan used Nashville-style country music to present a startling version of himself in the same way that Simon later made use of South African music. As a younger man, Simon sometimes felt overshadowed by Dylan’s larger reputation. Dylan’s hobo persona, his subversive quality, and his contempt for authority were charismatic. A lot of people made fun of his voice, but nearly everyone agreed that the songs were compelling. Next to him, Simon and Garfunkel seemed polite, studious, and eager to please—college boys. The best of their music was pretty to listen to and sometimes, as with “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” had emotional force. Dylan’s songs made a person feel powerful. Since “Graceland,” though, comparisons between Simon and Dylan no longer sensibly apply or take into proper account the distinctive merits of two maverick artists.\n\nSimon’s close friend Lorne Michaels, who has known him for thirty years, told me, “Since I met Paul, he’s been saying that he’s getting out of show business.” When I asked Simon if that was so, he said, “I always ask myself when I start something, ‘Is this what you want to do?’ I recorded when I was fifteen or sixteen, and the record was a hit. So I was in show business. I was in the world of records at a very young age. I was already becoming what I am. Basically, what I’m doing is an idea conceived by a thirteen-year-old. And I often think, You can review that idea, because it was a thirteen-year-old who thought it up. And I do review it, but I still like it.”\n\nSimon is sixty-one. He was born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, but he grew up in Kew Gardens, Queens. He lived with his father and mother and younger brother in an attached house in a row of identical houses. His father, Louis, who is no longer alive, sometimes drove into the wrong driveway. “How you supposed to tell these places apart?” he would ask. Simon’s mother, Belle, was a schoolteacher, who quit working to bring up Simon and his younger brother, Eddie, a former musician; he now helps handle his brother’s business. Louis Simon was a professional musician; he played the upright bass. For a while, he was a member of studio bands that worked for the television personalities Arthur Godfrey and Garry Moore. Simon and his brother would occasionally stay up late so that they could see their father when the camera showed the band. Louis also led his own bands, and for twenty-five years he had a job on Thursday afternoons at Roseland, where the other band on the bill played Latin music. When he was in his fifties, he grew tired of the musician’s life and went back to school. He got a doctorate in linguistics and became a professor at City College.\n\nIn grade school, Simon heard Arthur Garfunkel, the son of a travelling salesman, sing at a school assembly. Observing the impression that Garfunkel’s performance made on everyone, he decided that he wanted to be a singer, too. In the sixth grade, they were in “Alice in Wonderland” together—Garfunkel was the Mad Hatter, Simon was the White Rabbit. Simon’s father gave him a guitar and showed him some chords. Simon used to sit in the bathroom with the lights off and turn on the water and play; he liked the reverberation against the tiles. The first lines of “The Sound of Silence” (“Hello darkness my old friend/ I’ve come to talk with you again”) invoke the experience. By the time Simon was twelve or thirteen, he was writing songs, and he and Garfunkel were singing together. They were fourteen when they began looking up record companies in the Yellow Pages and trying to arrange auditions. Most of the companies were boss-and-a-secretary outfits in the Brill Building, at 1619 Broadway, where Simon now has his office. One day in 1956, when they were fifteen, they were recording a demo and a man named Sid Prosen, standing in the hallway outside the studio, heard them and signed them up. As Tom & Jerry, they recorded a song they had written called “Hey, Schoolgirl,” and Prosen released it on the Big Record label, with a song of Simon’s called “Dancin’ Wild” on the B side. The magazine Cashbox picked “Hey, Schoolgirl” as its Sleeper of the Week, and said, “This debut by the vocal duo looks as if it is going to make a strong bid to give the boys and the Big Label an initial high chart run. On the ‘Hey, Schoolgirl!’ session, the stuff of which hit teen pressings are made, the up-tempo ‘Hey, Schoolgirl’ has its setting in the classroom. Tom & Jerry, with some vocal resemblance to the Everly Brothers, get the tune off invitingly. ‘Dancin’ Wild’ is a lively issue highlighted by the twosome’s bright harmony.”\n\nProsen paid Alan Freed, the most popular disk jockey in the city, to play the record, and it sold a hundred thousand copies. For nine weeks, it was one of Billboard’s Top 100, and in New York it was in the Top Ten. Tom & Jerry performed “Hey, Schoolgirl” on “American Bandstand,” and the show’s panel of three couples gave it a score of ninety-five, saying that it was great to dance to. (Simon: “Actually, I noticed when they said that, it wasn’t.”) He and Garfunkel were sixteen when the record came out and, because both had skipped grades, they were seniors in high school. “American Bandstand” ’s other guest was the manic rockabilly singer Jerry Lee Lewis. When Garfunkel and Simon went into the dressing room, Lewis was leaning into the mirror and combing his hair. He ignored them, and they found him daunting. “I think it was the tough blondness of it,” Simon told me. “All the tough guys I knew were Italian. He looked dangerous.” Some of the money Simon made he saved, and with the rest he bought a red convertible.\n\nAfter “Hey, Schoolgirl,” Tom & Jerry released “That’s My Story,” which went nowhere. Neither did the two or three records that came after that. They stopped recording. Using names such as Jerry Landis and Tico and the Triumphs, Simon continued to make demos. He also made a record by himself, without telling Garfunkel, which Garfunkel regarded as a betrayal, and for several years they didn’t speak to each other.\n\nSimon went to Queens College, where he had a teacher who persuaded him to major in English. (“Otherwise,” he says, “I wouldn’t have known what to do.”) He graduated, in 1962, and went to Europe and sang on the street. After a few months, he came home, and the next fall he went to law school at Brooklyn College, and more or less flunked out. Crossing a bridge in Kew Gardens, he met Garfunkel, who was now an architecture student. They began singing together again and eventually, in 1964, made a record called “Wednesday Morning, 3 a.m.” On it are some folk songs, a Dylan cover, and five songs that Simon wrote, including a version of “The Sound of Silence” on which Simon plays acoustic guitar and another musician plays the upright bass.\n\nThe record sold only a few thousand copies, and Simon went abroad again, this time to England, where he worked as a folksinger. While he was there, a producer added electric guitar, electric bass, and drums to “The Sound of Silence,” without telling Simon. A few weeks later, performing in Denmark, Simon came across a copy of Cashbox. The record was No. 59 on the magazine’s chart, with a bullet, meaning that it was rising quickly. Simon told himself, “My life is irrevocably changed.” He went back to America. Garfunkel was living with his mother and father. Simon moved into his old room in his parents’ house. There wasn’t really anything for them to do. In those days, musicians toured mostly with revues, and they weren’t members of any. One afternoon, they were sitting in Simon’s red convertible, listening to the radio, when the disk jockey played “The Sound of Silence” and said, “No. 1, Simon and Garfunkel,” and Simon said, “That Simon and Garfunkel, they must be having a great time.”\n\nThey made five albums and then, in 1970, they split up, partly because Garfunkel wanted to act in movies. In 1981, they played a reunion concert in Central Park that was attended by half a million people. They considered making another album. Simon was recording the songs for what became “Hearts and Bones.” Garfunkel wanted a copy when Simon was done so that he could add his own parts, but Simon wasn’t willing to allow him that much control. They gave up the project, and the record, which was released in 1983, became Simon’s first commercial failure. When he went to South Africa a year later, to pursue an enthusiasm for African music, he felt that no one was paying any attention to him at all.\n\nThe mature period of Simon’s work—the songs that use more complicated structures and rhythms, and are written without regard for whether they will be hits—began with “Graceland,” the record he made in South Africa. During this time, he stopped writing songs in a conventional manner—that is, by using a guitar or a piano to compose a melody to fit lyrics, or to write lyrics while he played the melody. He abandoned it partly because what he knew about music theory had outgrown what he knew about the guitar. “The amount of information I had as a player hadn’t kept up with the melodies and chord structures I could think of,” he told me. Also, he said, “what I discovered while making ‘Graceland’ was a deeper understanding of rhythm. With most music, I just knew it wasn’t there—this doesn’t have a groove, there’s no pocket, it doesn’t make you want to move. It could be loud and fast, like punk, but it doesn’t make you want to move. The big learning experience from the African musicians, and especially the guitarists, was how do I break down a rhythm and understand its workings, what its effects are derived from, how I might reproduce them, instead of writing something and thinking, That’s a good groove. I hope I get another one.’’\n\nWith “Graceland,” Simon decided that he would make rhythm the most important consideration, and that he would handle one element of a song at a time. He would begin with what he calls “a rhythmic premise,” find music on the guitar to accompany it, record the combination, and, while listening to it, come up with a melody. Finally, he would write words to fit the melody. “If I have the guitar down on a track,” he told me, “I can sing a counterpoint to it, I can sing in syncopation. Along the way, I’m going to compose partly intellectually and partly intuitively. I’ve had people say to me over the last few years ‘Why don’t you write the way you used to?’ and I don’t know what they mean. They imagine me sitting in a room with a guitar, strumming a melody.”\n\nSimon’s next album, “The Rhythm of the Saints,” which was made partly in Brazil, was the result of a conversation he had with the Latin musicians Eddie Palmieri and Tito Puente. “I met them at a club downtown called S.O.B.’s,” Simon told me. “I went to hear some African bands, it was ’87, and they said, ‘Well, look, you can’t just make one album and leave and turn away. You have to go on now. You’ve gone to South Africa, which is for voices, but now you have to go where the drum is, to West Africa and Brazil.’”\n\n“Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,” the last song written for “Graceland,” ends with the South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo singing to the accompaniment of West African drums. By putting them together, Simon had made a bridge, unconsciously or not, to “The Rhythm of the Saints.”\n\n“The other thing that contributed to my going to Brazil was that Milton Nascimento”—the Brazilian musician—“asked me to do a duet. He said he’d send me a couple of songs he was working on—he wanted me to write the words. This was 1988. He sends me two songs, and I pick one. I didn’t know what to do, though, because I don’t know who I am. He just gave me the ‘la la la.’ I couldn’t imagine what to say, because am I speaking as Milton or am I me? He’s Brazilian. If I’m speaking as me, then what am I doing with someone else’s music? He sings in a higher register than I do, so to get the sense of it I began to sing a line of harmony underneath his. Anyway, I’m getting nowhere.\n\n“The days go by, so now here comes the week we go to L.A. I’m at the hotel. Milton says, ‘What have you got?’ I say, ‘All I got is I sing along with you on the harmonies.’ So I know I’m never going to get it. I think, I’m just going to get on a plane and go home. Then I think, You can’t, you have to at least go to the studio and say, ‘I’m sorry.’ At the studio, Milton writes me out the words phonetically, and I sing them in Portuguese. They say it sounds good. And, well, anyway, there it is. It’s done.\n\n“After the session, we’re standing in the parking lot, and I say, ‘I’m thinking about doing an album about drums, drumming as it goes from West Africa to Brazil to the Caribbean to Cuba and into New Orleans. Milton says, ‘I’ll help. You come to Brazil, and I’ll set you up with musicians.’ So I go, in 1989.”\n\nThe idea that he might write a Broadway musical came to Simon while he was touring in South Africa to promote “Graceland.” As he performed with Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, he felt that the pattern of their duets resembled the comings and goings of characters in a show that didn’t necessarily have a story but had a theme, and that if he saw such a performance in a theatre he might like it.\n\n“The Capeman” involves two murders committed in New York in 1959. A sixteen-year-old Puerto Rican named Salvador Agrón stabbed two Irish boys in a gang fight. The people who saw the fight said that the killer wore a black cape. The newspapers called him the Capeman. It took the police three days to find him, and when he was arrested he was defiant. A photograph of him in custody appeared on the front page of the News, with the headline “don’t care if i burn, sneers slayer of two.”\n\n“The Capeman” is written as if it were meant to be heard on the radio. Instead of the action’s unfolding through exchanges among characters, the plot is conveyed mostly through songs. One of them begins, “It was the morning of October 6th, 1960 / I was wearing my brown suit / Preparing to leave the house of D.”—D being detention. Simon wrote the story and some of the words with the poet Derek Walcott. Simon feels that he probably wrote the story as if it were a song, and Walcott wrote his part as if it were a poem. The difficulties that the show experienced are well known—it was one of the more prominent Broadway failures of the decade—but they unfortunately overshadowed the music, which is superb. One way of thinking about “The Capeman” is that neither Paul Simon nor Derek Walcott is the equal as a dramatist of Paul Simon the songwriter. Another is to acknowledge the problematic nature of the material. The murders take place in the first act. Nothing that happens after—what became of the Capeman, whether he had an encounter with St. Lazarus or only thought he did, whether he was cursed from childhood, whether his joining the Church was sincere—is as dramatic.\n\nThe Times reviewer described “The Capeman” as a “sad, benumbed spectacle,” which “registers as one solemn, helplessly confused drone.” The show closed after sixty-eight performances. My own feeling is that the evening contained one compelling moment—an exchange in a church, during which the Capeman’s mother meets the mothers of the victims, asks to be forgiven, and is rebuffed—but that otherwise the narrative was too dreamy, surreal, and diffuse for Broadway. The production probably would have been better received had it played at, say, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where it wouldn’t have had to satisfy Broadway expectations. Simon thought that in order for the show to have the authority he wanted it to have he needed the Latin stars Marc Anthony, Ruben Blades, and Ednita Nazario, who were happy to put their other work aside to appear on Broadway, but who he thinks would not have responded to the enticement “Play in Brooklyn!”\n\nSimon was among the investors who lost money on the show. His face during rehearsals was ashen, and his expression was grim. He put on weight from eating out on so many nights, and Marc Anthony, who played the young Salvador Agrón, got him smoking, which he hadn’t done since he was a teen-ager. When he sat across from Oprah Winfrey, he could see in her eyes that she thought he looked a lot older than he had the last time she’d seen him.\n\nThe rehearsals for the European tour were held in a room above a rim-and-tire store near the West Side Highway. Simon had engaged eleven musicians—a drummer, a percussionist, a bass player, two guitarists, two keyboard players, a trombone player, a saxophone player, a trumpet player, and a singer to sing in his stead when he needed to listen closely to the band. A second percussionist would be joining them in Europe. Simon has a very intelligent band: there are no charts, every musician remembers his parts, even though since the last tour, a year earlier, he may have worked with dozens of other musicians playing music from all over the world. (For example, Jamey Haddad, one of the percussionists, had just returned from a festival of sacred music in Morocco.) Simon’s band is so accomplished, he says, that leading it is like “driving a really expensive race car: if you have the touch, it responds, and if you don’t it goes everywhere.”\n\nThe band’s first chair is occupied by the drummer Steve Gadd, who has recorded and performed with Simon for roughly twenty-five years. He is responsible for the strutty little military figure on “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,” which, after the drum part in “Wipeout,” is perhaps the most widely recognized piece of percussion in popular music. A year ago, Gadd was touring with Eric Clapton, so Simon had to make do with another drummer; he was an excellent drummer—no one gets through the door without having superlative chops—but Simon felt that the band missed Gadd’s authority. To compensate, the musicians augmented their parts until the arrangements became too elaborate for Simon’s ear. As a tour progresses, musicians, either from enthusiasm, nerves, or inclination, tend to play more. A lot of what Simon hoped to do in rehearsals was strip away parts. “There’s always a lot of clutter,” he said. “After a while, it gets a little rococo.”\n\nThe rehearsals began at noon. The room was large and painted black and had windows on two sides. Simon would run through a song from “You’re the One” called “Old,” which starts with his playing a briskly repeated pattern of simple chords, and the band would join him, and almost immediately he would wave his arms and say, “Does it start like that, with everybody?” Someone would sheepishly say no, actually it starts with the drums, and they would begin again. Or he would address one of the horn players: “You don’t have to play the whole phrase. Leave out notes. It’s that thing of tricking the ear into hearing what’s not there.” Or say to a keyboard player, “Drop two notes now and then. Play the shadow of it, so that we don’t get too accustomed to it.” Or tell the saxophone player, “Growl it, but stick it into the blend. Let’s see if it works,” and when the horn player did what Simon wanted Simon shrugged and said, “Too staccato. Lazy it up.”\n\nOne day, he had an idea for a section toward the end of “The Coast,” from “The Rhythm of the Saints.” The lyrics describe a funeral in “the harbor church of St. Cecilia.” On the record, the section passes without any elaboration, but a part for a brass trio had lately suggested itself to Simon. After he taught it to the horn players by singing it to them, and they played it a few times without satisfying him, he said, trying to be helpful, “My original idea was that it was supposed to sound like a Salvation Army band. Or maybe New Orleans.” He sat down on a folding chair and tipped the front legs off the floor. He was wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap, and the gesture made him look like a testy schoolboy. The horns played the section again. It still didn’t strike him as apt. He walked over and sang into the ear of the trombone player. The musician, who was taller, bent to him as if he were listening to a secret. The musicians tried again, and this time Simon told them, “That sounds fine to me.” The entire band played the song from the beginning, but when they came to the new part Simon waved his hands and said to the trombone player, “I think you come in too soon. And you should come in with a big slide.”\n\n“Go Dixieland, man,” someone said.\n\nSimon shook his head. “It’s a funeral procession,” he said.\n\nThe band had been at work, with a short break, for about six hours. “You’re actors at this point,” Simon told them wearily. “You’re playing guys in a funeral procession. You’re not you, you’re just guys.”\n\nThen he sat down. “I don’t know what’s happened,” he said. “Everything seems to have fallen apart.” The musicians offered explanations. Simon stood up and listened to them. Then he turned his back to them, sat down again, and began absently playing his guitar.\n\nTo the last rehearsal I attended Simon brought his nine-year-old son, Adrian, a skinny little bristly-haired, red-headed boy. Adrian went around the room talking to all the musicians and having them show him things. His father stood at the front of the room, drinking coffee. The band worked through “The Coast” again. Simon had written a new guitar part for himself and wanted to try it out. “Fourteen years I’ve played this song,” he said, “and I finally figured out the guitar part.” Then they moved on to “Slip Slidin’ Away,” which has a part for a vocal quartet. Simon collected Jay Ashby, the trombone player, Tony Cedras, one of the keyboard players, and Mark Stewart, the second guitar player, to run through it with him. The three of them stood in a half circle, facing Simon, to sing. Cedras is a tall, thin South African with dreadlocks to his waist. He held a cardboard coffee cup in one hand and tapped time on the bottom of it with the fingers of his other hand. Stewart has long red hair, which he piled on top of his head and held in place with a chopstick, like a geisha. The other musicians sat in a lounge outside the room, having the conversation they always seemed to have, about computers. Adrian sat among them.\n\nTwo and three at a time, the musicians filed back into the room. Simon was at the microphone, ready to begin. When Adrian appeared, Simon said, “Adrian, what are you doing? You O.K.? You’re not smoking, are you? ’Cause that is the smokers you’re hanging with.” Adrian grinned and went off to sit next to Jamey Haddad, the percussionist. The song took quite some time to work out. Adrian came over and lay down on the floor by his father, his head resting against a speaker. He sang along, grimacing like a blues shouter on the high notes. “Slip Slidin’ Away” includes the lines “I know a father who had a son / he longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he’d done.” When it arrived, Adrian fell silent and looked up into his father’s face. Haddad knocked over a cymbal, which fell to the floor. Simon stopped singing, and the band came to a halt. “That’s nice,” he said. “It’s different. It’s unusual.” He took a sip of coffee. “Keep it,” he said, putting down the coffee cup, “but make it sound like an accident.”\n\nLater that evening, I talked to Simon on the phone. “I didn’t get much sleep last night,” he said. “The words are starting to come—they woke me up at six. Usually, when the words come in the middle of the night, I think, I’ll remember that, but I thought this time it was important to get up and write them down. And when I actually woke up I didn’t remember any of them. I don’t know what they are, probably not important.” I could hear him turning pages.\n\n“After I put the pen down and went back to bed, more came,” he said. “In fact, the story came. I don’t know the whole thing, and I don’t know if it fits anything I’m writing. To me, it’s an example of nothing but that the process has taken hold. It’s waking me up—which is a good sign.”\n\nThen he said that he had written a third piece of music. “It feels like it has fallen into a title,” he said. “The rhythm of the notes is exactly ‘Once Upon a Time,’ a slow, descending line. Whether it’s called that later, I don’t know. It’s usable now. The story had a guy like the guys I knew when I was growing up in Queens. So my mind is going click, click, with these rhymes, and I can see every scene.”\n\nHe paused and then he said, “Anyhow, I wake up and I say, ‘So I was born in the city of Newark, but as soon as I could talk I expressed a preference for New York’—Newark, New York, a rhyme. ‘So I’m a talker-slash-New Yorker. I’m meeting a guy from Queens. Not a borough with a great name, blah, blah, blah.’ I don’t know what this is all about. ‘Terrorists and tumors,’ I don’t know, terrorists and tumors and I have rumors, tumors—I became stuck for a rhyme—and then I thought, Oh, no, no, no, I have baby boomers. I figure, this guy’s going to get on the cell phone, and he’s going to hear a voice—it’s going to be the voice of God—so the language will have to change. I’m not sure how I’ll do it, but it’s an interesting story. Maybe it won’t be an interesting story, who knows?”\n\nThe extension he keeps for his family and his closest friends began to ring. “I have to take this,” he said. “It might be my wife calling.”\n\nWhile I waited, I thought about the man hearing the voice of God on his cell phone, and the reprimand that Simon had received from the Old Testament figure.\n\nWhen Simon came back on the line, he said, “Anyway, it involves that device of letting the mind go effortlessly into a character and then turning at an unexpected point. So it’s begun.”\n\nBecause I asked him to, he read some entries from his lyric book. “This is from my books for ‘You’re the One,’ ” he said. “Here’s a line: ‘The ocean and the atmosphere, clouds on fire, pay dirt, dancing DNA, wake up, don’t sleep, get out of the way.’\n\n“ ‘Star quilt,’ ” he continued. “That became ‘quilt of stars.’ ‘If I was a guitar I wouldn’t play that song’—didn’t use it. ‘Sage and sweet grass’—used it. ‘Guru in the morning, bored by the afternoon, fool by sunset’—nope.”\n\nI asked what kind of book he wrote in.\n\n“A loose-leaf binder,” he said, “so I can tear the pages out. People always give me these handbound leather books, and I can’t ever write in them. They’re too perfect. It’s a presumption to try.”\n\nWhen Simon and his wife got back from their trip to Venice, he and I and Angel Aponte went to the game, at Yankee Stadium. Simon seemed subdued. In the car, he handed Aponte a CD, a recording of him playing a slow and spare chordal figure—the third fragment.\n\n“It’s beautiful,” I said.\n\n“It took me all day.”\n\n“It’s so clean.”\n\n“That’s what took me all day. Anyway, I wanted to get one more tune started before I went out on tour, and this is the one.”\n\nIt was a cool, windy evening and every now and then programs and newspapers blew across the infield. Simon took a liking to a little Latino boy who was sitting with his mother in the row in front of us. She looked to be about twenty-five. When Simon heard the boy ask for some ice cream and his mother say that she didn’t want to leave the game, Simon told her, “I’ll go.” She appeared not to know who he was; at least, she hadn’t paid much attention to him earlier, except to give him the smile a mother gives a mild-looking guy who is being nice to her child. They left and were gone longer than the errand seemed to require. The mother turned in her seat to look for them. Aponte said, “It’s all right,” and she, not especially reassured, said, “I only have the one.” When they got back, Simon told her that the ice-cream machine closest to our seats was broken, so they had gone to another. A few people approached Simon and asked if he would sign their programs or let them take his picture, and he said, “Can we do it after the game?” At the end of the game, the crowd pressed in upon him so avidly that no one could get a picture anyway. When someone asked for one, he said, “Oh, I don’t really like pictures. Do you?”\n\nOutside the stadium, Simon’s car had been delivered to the curb. While we were waiting on Frederick Douglass Boulevard for a light to change, I turned to ask Simon a question and was brought up short when his arm shot to his armrest and his tinted window began lowering. He stared straight ahead, his face composed in its customary deadpan expression. I had no idea what he was doing. Next to us was a small car with all the windows open. The driver was a man who looked West Indian; at least, he had long dreadlocks, and so did the man next to him. Each of them had an unlit cigarette between his lips and neither of them moved. They paid no attention to us, and Simon appeared to be paying no attention to them. Then I realized that he was listening closely to the music coming from the speakers in their car. It sounded like single-chord reggae in a minor key, but the singer chanted more than sang, and the melody was mournful and Eastern-sounding.\n\n“Jamaican,” Simon said. Then, “Maybe it’s not Jamaican. It’s almost Arabic-sounding.” His head moved slightly with the rhythm. The light changed, and the other car took off ahead of us. Simon hummed the melody. “It really had an African sound to it,” he said. He raised his window. Then, his tone downcast, “I understand that sound—the pulse—you got to go out and dance. More people probably want to do that than listen to me explore the further ranges of my songwriting.”\n\n“Well, anyway, you’re past the crisis point,” I said. “The work’s under way.”\n\n“I would say so,” he said. He hummed the melody softly. He looked out the window. “There’s nothing you can do if you don’t have the confidence,” he said. “You really have to believe it. And when you believe it’s extraordinary—well, even if it isn’t, just the pleasure of belief . . .” He completed the remark with the slightest of shrugs. ♦"
