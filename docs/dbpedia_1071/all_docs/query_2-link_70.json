        "text": "General Information\n\nThe School of Music\n\nAs a vital professional school within Baylor University, the School of Music has been a member in good standing of the National Association of Schools of Music since 1930. Degrees offered in the School of Music satisfy all requirements of this accrediting agency. Degree programs leading to the Bachelor of Music Education degree also conform to certification requirements of the Texas Education Agency.\n\nRegulations and requirements not specifically described in this section will be governed by University rules listed elsewhere in this catalog.\n\nOur Mission\n\nThe Baylor University School of Music provides transformational experiences that prepare students for careers in music. Our students thrive in a Christian environment characterized by a nurturing resident faculty, an unwavering pursuit of musical excellence, a global perspective, dedication to service, and devotion to faith. They investigate the rich musical and cultural heritage of the past, develop superior musical skills and knowledge in the present, and explore and create new modes of musical expression for the future. While preparing for future leadership roles, our students join with the School of Music faculty in enhancing the quality of community life, enriching the larger culture, and making Baylor a place in which heart, mind, and soul coalesce.\n\nBuildings and Equipment\n\nThe School of Music currently is housed in two facilities, the Waco Hall complex and the Glennis McCrary Music Building. The Waco Hall complex contains 500-seat Roxy Grove Hall, 120-seat Recital Hall II, as well as classroom, rehearsal, practice, and storage spaces. The Waco Hall complex also includes office and studio spaces for vocal and keyboard studies, music history, music theory, music education, composition, church music, and a suite devoted to piano pedagogy.\n\nHoused within the multi-level 70,000 square-foot Glennis McCrary Music Building is the 1,000-seat Mary Gibbs Jones Concert Hall, the 200-seat Meadows Lecture/Recital Hall, and an organ teaching and performing hall. The building features seventy-eight practice and rehearsal rooms, a recording studio, technology lab, choral and instrumental rehearsal halls, special areas for chamber music and seminars, instrumental and choral music libraries, and studio and office spaces for the division of instrumental studies and ensemble directors.\n\nIn addition to the McCrary Music Building and the Waco Hall complex, the School of Music utilizes classrooms and rehearsal space in the Weithorn Building and the Moody Library. The Dunn Center for Church Music studies offices are located in historic Harris House.\n\nBaylor University has one of the largest collections of organs in the country, six instruments for performance and teaching and numerous practice organs. The School of Music maintains an inventory of over 200 pianos including six Steinway concert grands and two electronic keyboard labs. A large variety of instruments for the study and performance of Renaissance and Baroque music, as well as electronic music laboratories, provide for a wide range of musical experiences.\n\nLibrary Resources\n\nThe Arts & Special Collections Research Library (Arts Center), located on the third floor of Moody Memorial Library, is an integrated unit that supports the research and teaching goals of Baylor University through outreach, education, curating, preserving, providing access to collections, and teaching how to successfully engage with these creative and unique collections. Art, music, theater, and special collections in all disciplines are the areas of collections and services brought together on the third floor of Moody Memorial Library. Recognized as one of the most distinguished fine arts collections in the Southwest, the Center boasts a collection of approximately 116,000 printed music scores, 54,000 print fine arts books, and 75,000 audio and video recordings. In addition to these general collections, the Arts Center holds over 48,000 rare and unique items in a variety of disciplines. Listening/viewing stations are available for all media types, and the Moody 311 Creative Lab provides music software and MIDI keyboards as well as productivity applications. The Arts Center has a variety of study spaces for individuals and groups, and a seminar room equipped with a piano, computers, projectors, Internet access, and high-quality speakers. Staff members are available to assist students and faculty members. More information is available from the website at baylor.edu/library/arts.\n\nArtist Attractions\n\nEach year, large numbers of professional artists perform and teach in the School of Music and serve as role models and mentors for students. The School of Music also presents visiting musicians of distinction as part of the Distinguished Artist Series (DAS) and the Lyceum Series. The DAS is a premier concert series funded by Baylor University. The Lyceum Series offers lectures, master classes, and workshops by outstanding artist teachers and is supported, in part, by a grant from the Meadows Foundation, Inc., of Dallas. Other special events include the Hearn Innovators in Christian Music Series and the Northcutt Lectures in Church Music and the Joy Vee Davis Lecture Series in Music Education.\n\nMusic Societies and Clubs\n\nThe following national groups have chapters in the School of Music: Mu Phi Epsilon, national music fraternity; Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, national professional music fraternity; Kappa Kappa Psi, national honorary band fraternity; Tau Beta Sigma, national honorary band sorority, and Pi Kappa Lambda, national music honor society. There are student chapters of the Music Educators National Conference, the Music Teachers National Association, the American Choral Directors Association, and the Baylor Association of Church Musicians.\n\nThe Dunn Center for Christian Music Studies\n\nEstablished in 1984 as the Institute for Church Music and Worship, the Dunn Center for Christian Music Studies is an integral part of the School of Music. The Center strives to prepare Christians to serve and worship God through music and the arts.\n\nPerforming Ensembles\n\nThe School of Music offers a full array of bands, choirs, orchestras, and smaller ensembles, such as jazz and early music ensembles. Any Baylor student in any major may audition for and perform in one of these ensembles and, in doing so, can experience one of the joyous experiences in Baylor campus life. To participate, students should contact the School of Music or the office of the ensemble of interest.\n\nEntrance Requirements in Music\n\nIn addition to admission to the University, an applicant for any music major must apply to the School of Music and audition on their principal instrument for acceptance in the school. Please note, the music application is separate from the Baylor University application. Students accepted as music majors are notified by the Office of the Dean. Detailed information about audition expectations and repertoire are available on the School of Music website. Applicants for a major in church music, music history and literature, music theory, or composition must, additionally, be approved by the faculty of that program. Students who wish to major in music history and literature or music theory are required to submit a sample of their research or writing.\n\nTests\n\nCandidates applying for entrance into any applied music or music theory class must give evidence of being prepared for the work therein, as demonstrated by placement tests.\n\nPlacement Tests – Piano\n\nIn addition to admissions auditions in their applied major, all freshmen and transfer students entering a music degree program will take a piano placement test prior to initial enrollment in a piano course. At the placement, each student's level of competency (in repertoire, technique, reading, and skill activities) will be assessed, and the student will be placed at the appropriate level within the curriculum. Students with preexisting keyboard skills may test out of one or more semesters of piano instruction.\n\nPlacement Tests – Theory and Musicianship\n\nAn entrance test in music theory to determine the student’s background and readiness for admission to Music Theory I and either Introductory Musicianship or Musicianship I is given prior to initial enrollment in a theory course. Transfer students must take a transfer theory diagnostic exam prior to enrollment in a theory course.\n\nAchievement Tests – Applied Music Juries\n\nAll students taking applied music for credit toward a music degree must take an achievement test in applied music at the end of each semester.\n\nBarrier Placement Juries – Applied Music\n\nStudents may register for upper division courses in applied music only after successfully completing the sophomore barrier placement jury.\n\nCredit in Applied Music\n\nMajors in all applied music areas except keyboard will receive two semester hours credit for an hour of instruction at the lower division (freshman-sophomore) level, and two to four hours at the upper division and graduate levels. Piano and organ majors will receive three or four semester hours credit for an hour of instruction throughout their entire degree programs. All other students will receive one semester hour credit per half-hour lesson. The maximum amount of credit that can be earned in one applied music subject in any one semester is four semester hours. No student may be registered for more than one section of a given applied music subject in a semester.\n\nIn a summer-session term, five hours of private instruction are given for one hour of credit, and ten hours of instruction are given for two hours of credit. The maximum credit that can be earned in a summer term in one subject of applied music is two semester hours. The maximum total applied music credit that can be earned in one summer session term is three semester hours. Applied music courses are only open in summer sessions to B.M., B.M.Ed., or B.A. Music-Applied students in their primary applied concentration with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.\n\nApplied Music Credit on Non-Music Degrees\n\nA maximum of ten semester hours of applied music and/or ensemble is accepted on the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Business Administration degrees as elective credit.\n\nTransfer Credit\n\nCredit in music courses earned in accredited institutions is accepted for transfer subject to the following provisions:\n\nThe minimum grade accepted for transfer is “C.”\n\nCredit in applied music toward a major in applied music is accepted only after a test to determine the actual accomplishment of the student in technique and repertoire.\n\nCourse Numbers for Applied Music\n\nAll applied music subjects (private instruction) have four elements. The first digit indicates the level as follows:\n\nMusic Course Numbers Digit Family 1 Undergraduate 3 Advanced Undergraduate 5 Graduate\n\nThe second digit indicates the amount of credit in semester hours. It is followed by a letter indicating the instrument “family”:\n\nMusic Course Numbers Digit Family V for voice B for brass P for percussion K for keyboard S for strings H for harp W for woodwinds\n\nThe last digit identifies the instrument within the “family” as follows:\n\nMusic Course Numbers Digit Family K1 for piano K2 for organ K3 for harpischord K4 for carillon K5 for accompanying W1 for flute W2 for oboe W3 for clarinet W4 for bassoon W5 for saxophone B1 for trumpet B2 for horn B3 for trombone B4 for euphonium B5 for tuba S1 for violin S2 for viola S3 for cello S4 for bass P1 for percussion P2 for timpani V1 for voice H1 for harp\n\nApplied class instruction subjects are:\n\nCourse List Code Title Hours MUS 1131Class Piano, Grade Level I (For Music Majors) (grade level Is)1 MUS 1132Class Piano, Grade Level II (For Music Majors) (grade level IIs)1 MUS 1133Class Piano, Grade Level III (For Music Majors) (grade level IIIs)1 MUS 1124Class Voice (generally for non-performance majors)1 MUS 1125Beginning Class Piano (instruction for non-music majors)1\n\nStudent Load\n\nThe maximum credit load for an average student seeking the degree of Bachelor of Music or Bachelor of Music Education is nineteen semester hours.

Superior students (who average the grade of \"B\" on all previous work as well as on the work of the preceding term) may carry up to twenty-two semester hours with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.\n\nRecitals\n\nJunior and Senior Recitals\n\nA senior recital is required of every degree candidate in applied music. It must be completed no later than two weeks before commencement. A junior recital is required of every prospective graduate in applied music as prerequisite for senior work. Junior or senior recitals may be given only by students of junior or senior standing (sixty or ninety semester hours, respectively).\n\nAll B.M.E. candidates are required to give a public solo performance demonstrating their ability in their applied major. A hearing must be passed prior to the performance. The performance must be a half-recital to be given in a formal recital setting.\n\nThe student must be enrolled for applied music during the term in which the recitals are given.\n\nAll composition majors will present a recital of their works while enrolled in MUS 40C1 Degree Recital - Composition.\n\nRecital Attendance\n\nAll B.M., B.M.E., and B.A. Music majors must successfully complete six semesters of MUS 1001 Recital Attendance (0 hours credit, graded Pass/Fail). MUS 1001 Recital Attendance requirements for secondary music majors and music minors are listed in the sections outlining the requirements for that program. Specific regulations concerning satisfaction of the MUS 1001 Recital Attendance requirement may be found in the course syllabus.\n\nEnsembles\n\nAll students pursuing a B.M. or B.M.E. degree must be enrolled in a large ensemble every semester of residence, except for the student teaching semester for B.M.E. students. Large ensembles include: Instrumental – Baylor Symphony, Campus Orchestra, Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Concert Band, and Marching Band; Vocal – A Cappella Choir, Concert Choir, Chamber Singers, Bella Voce, Men's Choir, and Women's Choir. Upon completion of two semesters of large ensemble participation, ensemble requirements for Keyboard majors may be fulfilled by Studio Accompanying, Chamber Music, and Piano Ensemble. See individual keyboard degree programs for details.\n\nCourse Repetition Policy\n\nStudents enrolled in music degrees (B.M., B.M.E., B.A. Music) may not repeat a course in the Music Core or in their major after receiving a grade of F in that course for the second time.\n\nClass Attendance Policy\n\nSchool of Music policy requires that to earn credit in a course a student must be officially enrolled by the end of the second full week of the semester and attend at least 75% of all class meetings. Faculty members may establish additional attendance requirements as outlined in course syllabi. Any student who is not present for at least 75% of the scheduled class sessions for any course will automatically receive a grade of \"F\" in the course. Any University-related activity necessitating an absence from class will count as an absence when determining whether a student has attended the required 75% of class meetings.\n\nHonors Program\n\nSchool of Music students participate in many of the programs offered by the Honors Program within the Baylor Honors College. For detailed information concerning these opportunities, consult the Honors College section of this catalog.\n\nSpecial Music Scholarships\n\nNumerous music scholarships are awarded annually to music majors. These are in addition to any financial aid a student may receive from the University through the Student Financial Aid Office. Qualifying for a music scholarship is by the audition process. Scholarships are awarded for one academic year (unless otherwise specified) and are renewable contingent upon sustaining a satisfactory grade point average, enrollment as a fulltime student in the School of Music, and other participation expectations and requirements. Students are recommended for scholarships to the Office of the Dean by the School of Music Scholarship Committee each year. Detailed information about the audition process and for receiving music scholarships may be found in the Student Handbook on the School of Music website.\n\nEndowed Scholarships\n\nSchool of Music scholarships are funded by generous gifts from donors.
