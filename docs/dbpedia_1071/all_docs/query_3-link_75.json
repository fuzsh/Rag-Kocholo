        "text": "Do You Recall? (Trombone Solo with Brass Band - Score and Parts) - Wiffin, Rob\n\nA slow, bluesy solo for trombone with band accompanimentLike many people, I took the opportunity offered by the COVID lockdown in Spring of 2020 to sort through old paperwork. I discovered a lot of songs that had not seen the light of day for many years and were mostly written with just the melody and chord symbols. Some offered the potential of becoming instrumental solos with a combination of heart-on-the-sleeve melodies the like of which I would not write now, together with maybe a greater sophistication in the instrumental writing. I had the notion in the back of my mind that Do you recall?; would work as a trombone solo but it seemed to fight me all the way. However, once finished it has proved to appeal to trombonists and has already been recorded by Brett Baker. It is not intrinsically difficult but needs a sense of the appropriate slow swing style and good control throughout the range.- Rob WiffinDuration: 4.15\n\nEstimated dispatch 7-14 working days\n\nView Music\n\nBass Trombone Concerto (Bass Trombone Solo with Brass Band - Score and Parts) - Brubeck, Christopher\n\n\"As a bass trombonist, I spent many years of my adolescence playing in youth orchestras, engaging in musical daydreams. I would visualize myself jumping up from the back of the orchestra to unleash improvisations much to the conductor's horror. The resultant three-movement, thirteen-minute work has enjoyed a robust life with performances by notable orchestras all around the world. Happily, the concerto works well as a recital piece, with many accomplished college players having won concerto competitions performing it. Jazz elements were inescapable, and realizing my old nightmare/dream, quite a bit of the trombone solo is meant to be improvised. I made a recording of the concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra, which was included on a CD called Bach to Brubeck released on Koch International Classics. Having already become popular as a bass trombone work with orchestra accompaniment, renowned British Bass Trombonist and publisher Roger Argente suggested he release a special Brass Band arrangement of my concerto. Roger knew the piece well because years ago he played the European premiere of the concerto with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall.\" - Chris Brubeck. Duration: 13.00. Suitable for 1st Section Bands and above.\n\nEstimated dispatch 7-14 working days\n\nAtlantic Zephyrs (Trombone Solo with Brass Band - Score and Parts) - Simons, Gardell - Wilkinson, Keith M.\n\nSoloist, composer and teacher Gardell Simons (1878 - 1945) achieved national prominence as trombone soloist with the Sousa Band. He later successfully made the transition to the orchestral world and became principal trombone in the Cleveland Orchestra as well as being professor of trombone at the Curtis Institute Of Music in Philadelphia.This solo dates from 1915 and describes the soft, gentle breezes of Summer. Maybe the atmosphere surrounding the many outdoor concerts in which the composer performed were his inspiration. This brass band arrangement was prepared at the request of Brett Baker for his visit to perform with Brass Band Of The Western Reserve, musical director Dr Keith M Wilkinson, in May 2010.\n\nEstimated dispatch 7-14 working days\n\nView Music\n\nAtlantic Zephyrs (Trombone Solo with Brass Band - Score and Parts)\n\nSoloist, composer and teacher Gardell Simons (1878 - 1945) achieved national prominence as trombone soloist with the Sousa Band.

This version for brass band was commissioned by Nicholas Childs, Music Director of the Black Dyke Band, specially for Brett Baker, the then principal trombone of the band. He has recorded it on the Doyen label with the Black Dyke Band.The work falls into three main sections, played without a break, but conforming to the traditional pattern of concerto structure. After a slow introduction, containing most of the motivic and rhythmic ideas used in the work, there follows the main fast section which is itself divided into three parts and concludes with a fierce climax (timpani and gong). The slow and rather intense middle section is linked to a cadenza for the soloist, at first unaccompanied but leading to accompanied references to earlier material. The final section is a scherzo which ends dramatically with a re-statement of the opening slow introduction. A brisk coda concludes the work. The interval of a fourth (and its augmented form) provides melodic and harmonic unity for the work, whilst the tonal juxtaposition between E minor and B flat major throughout the concerto is an important element of the structure.The writing for trombone is virtuosic, encompassing the whole range of the instrument, but it also exploits the rather beautiful lyrical sound of which this instrument is capable.\n\nEstimated dispatch 7-14 working days\n\nView Music\n\nTrombone Concerto (Trombone Solo with Brass Band - Score only) - Gregson, Edward\n\nThe Gregson Trombone Concerto was originally written in 1979 to a commission from Bedfordshire Education Service, for a new work for Michael Hext, winner of the first BBC Young Musician of the Year competition.
