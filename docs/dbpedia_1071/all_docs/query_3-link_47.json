The Count has his eye on his wife’s maid Susanna, who is about to marry the Count’s servant, Figaro. Much to Figaro’s dismay, the Count plans to seduce Susanna on the night of the wedding.\n\nMeanwhile, Cherubino, the Count’s young page, has a crush on the Countess, but has just been dismissed after being discovered with Barbarina, the gardener Antonio’s daughter.\n\nFigaro decides he must foil the Count’s attempt to seduce his wife-to-be and enlists the help of the Countess, Susanna and Cherubino – the latter disguising himself as a woman. A series of mistaken identities, misunderstandings and thwarted plans ensue, with all members of the household participating as each tries to get what – and who – they want.\n\nMozart’s comic opera is packed with plot twists, forbidden desires and unforgettable melodies, combining laugh-out-loud comedy with moments of breathtaking beauty.\n\nCourtyard Theatre\n\n£16\n\nRunning time: 240 minutes, one interval\n\nRoyal Opera & Ballet's website\n\nX Royal Opera House\n\nInsta RoyalOperaHouse\n\nFb Royal Opera House\n\n10 Sep from £16\n\nM\n\nmusic\n\nC\n\nclassical\n\nImaginary Landscapes - Poetry and Harp\n\nMagical and mesmerising...

Thoughtful, interpretive concerts devoted to the writing of visionary Songwriters and Poets who he has always admired.\n\nThe success of these concerts has been such, that it has somewhat eclipsed Keith’s own material (which has mostly been heard on his 12 Album releases) so the writing and release of this new and significant body of work Word Paintings has given Keith, and those alongside him the confidence to open a door and let this treasure chest of original songs be heard.\n\nThe songs from Word Paintings, a stand-alone, much championed, new collection, are at the heart of this concert, set amongst the characterful and fearless songs from Can You Imagine? (2020), the vital commentary of Paradise Lost (2019) and the poetic imagery of Message from the Gods (2017), even some songs that date way back through his music year career.\n\nThe best collection of Keith’s original material in one concert – which is by no means just music.
