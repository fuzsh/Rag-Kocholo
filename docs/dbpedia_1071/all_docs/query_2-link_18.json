        "text": "Both Series I and II are arranged alphabetically according to CARP's original office filing system.\n\nSeries I, ADMINISTRATIVE FILES, consists of documents pertaining to the administration of the organization. Files on the \"Board of Directors,\" \"Executive Director,\" \"Funding Sources,\" and \"Reports\" comprise the majority of the series.\n\nFor those interested in the organizational history of CARP, the collected minutes and correspondence of the board of directors, contained within the \"Meetings\" files, offer an inside perspective, and span from 1973 to 1982. There is substantive information on CARP's working concerns: casework, funding, solicitation, personnel, organizational health, and budget. The minutes also offer important insight into CARP's founding and eventual demise.\n\nOther documentation of CARP's case load and organizational life can be found in the \"Reports\" files and in the proposals to the New Haven Foundation and United Way, under \"Funding Sources.\" The reports present in all of these files provide regular summaries of personnel and budgetary matters, pending cases, new clients, various events arranged or attended by CARP, and a (typically quarterly) financial statement. Other folders in \"Funding Sources\" include materials that document the extent of CARP's quest for outside monies. In particular, the correspondence with the Aetna Insurance Company and Southern New England Telephone reveals the complexity of the relationship between CARP and its corporate sponsors.\n\nFleming Norcott's final report as executive director provides a concise summary of CARP's activity through 1979. Other \"Executive Director\" files include some of the correspondence that flowed in and out of the CARP office from 1980 to 1982. It should be noted that the majority of CARP's correspondence (from 1973 to 1983), is scattered throughout the collection; correspondence with particular organizations/projects is often located in the organization/project file; and other correspondence is found in the \"Meetings\" files of the board of directors. \"History\" and \"Publicity\" files contain items which explain how CARP presented itself to the public and how CARP was regarded by the local media. Most of the cases and topics described in Series I can be explored in further detail in Series II.\n\nSeries II, TOPICAL FILES, documents CARP's working concerns, ranging from general issues like affirmative action to specific cases like the bid by the Silver Shields (an African American police organization) for fair treatment by the New Haven Police Department. In addition, there is considerable documentation on CARP's ongoing relationship with dozens of community groups, city and state commissions, and national membership organizations. CARP's standing as a significant player in the New Haven minority community is best represented in the substantial number of files on \"Black Organizations,\" \"Community Action Groups and Community Matters,\" and \"New Haven Economics and Development.\" Among the materials on neighborhood organizations are extensive files on the Hill Central Community, the Newhallville Neighborhood Corporation, and the Dixwell/Newhallville Neighborhood Revitalization Program. There is material on several of CARP's major projects, including a proposed business/technical academy for the area (under \"Education\") and the organization of a minority economic development conference (under \"New Haven Economics and Development\"). For those interested in the concerns of African-American professionals, there are folders on the National Bar Association (a minority lawyers' organization), under \"Bar associations and legal societies\"; several files on individual professional organizations under \"Black Organizations\"; and folders on the Economic Development Conference, under \"New Haven Economics and Development.\"\n\nEvidence of CARP's presence in city and state politics can be found throughout Series II, particularly in such files as: \"Commissions and Committees,\" \"Community action groups and community matters,\" \"Education,\" \"Housing,\" and \"New Haven Economics and Development.\" Under Clarance Jones in the early 1980s, CARP became increasingly involved in media concerns. CARP's participation on the WTNH-TV Minority Advisory Committee and its high profile response to a 1980 cross burning are documented in the \"Media\" files.\n\nSeries III, PHOTOGRAPHS, is comprised of one folder of 8x10 black and white photographic prints. They are undated and unidentified, but appear to be prints of CARP staff members and New Haven neighborhoods."
