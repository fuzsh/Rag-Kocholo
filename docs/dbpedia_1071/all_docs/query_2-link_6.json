        "text": "LENNON, John (1940-1980) + McCARTNEY, Paul (1942- ) + TCHAIKOVSKY, Pyotr Ilych (1840-1893)\n\nBEATLECRACKER SUITE (arr.Arthur Wilkinson)\n\nConcert Originals Series GMCO049\n\nCatalogue Number: GMCO049\n\nDifficulty level: E What's this?\n\nISMN: 9790222235960\n\nView Score\n\nPlay Audio\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a link to the audio instead.\n\nDIGITAL DOWNLOAD\n\nAs an alternative to having a lovely printed copy sent to you, for this title you can buy it as a DIGITAL DOWNLOAD which you can print out yourself. This is in the form of a PDF file which you will be able to download to your computer or device immediately after purchase together with a licence authorising the use of the file for one copy only. You will have 14 days to download the file, after which it will no longer be accessible to you online. Should you need more than one copy (such as for a choir or orchestra) then you must purchase as many \"copies\" as you need; you will still only have one file to download but the licence will authorise the number of copies purchased. If you buy multiple copies you are allowed to print only up to that number of copies. Alternatively, you can share the file electronically instead; but the total number of prints and shared electronic copies must not exceed the number purchased.\n\nLevel of Difficulty\n\nAttributing a particular level of difficulty to an orchestral piece is awkward!\n\nA piece may be easy for the strings but difficult for the brass; it may feature a tricky instrumental solo but the other parts may be relatively straight forward. A number of the arrangements listed are designed to simplify works to some extent but composers of many original works featured did not consider difficulty when writing them. What our levels mean:\n\nA = for players up to UK Grade 3\n\nB = Grade 3 to 5\n\nC = Grade 4 to 6\n\nD = Grade 5 to 7\n\nE = Grade 6 to 8\n\nF = Grade 7 and over\n\nOur gradings should be taken only as a rough guide.\n\nTo be sure if a piece is suitable for you, take a look at the score.\n\nOrchestration\n\n3 Flutes (3rd db.piccolo), 2 Oboes (2nd db.Cor Anglais), 2 Clarinets (2nd db.Bass Clarinet), 2 Bassoons\n\n4 Horns in F, 2 Trumpets in Bb, 3 Trombones, Tuba, Timpani, Percussion (Triangle, Side Drum, Bass Drum, Cymbals, Suspended Cymbal, Finger Cymbals, Glockenspiel, Tambourine), Harp, Celeste db.Piano\n\nStrings (Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello, Bass)\n\nIn the mid 1960s, the late Roy Castle had a series of variety shows on BBC Television and Arthur Wilkinson (1924-1968) was his musical director. On one of the shows, the celebrity guest was ballet star Doreen Wells who asked if she could dance to music of the Beatles. It fell to Arthur Wilkinson to arrange Lennon/McCartney for use by a ballerina. He hit on the idea of using part of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite as a model; it was so popular that further movements were added for an EP recording and the complete Beatlecracker Suite is the result. All eight movements of the original Nutcracker Suite are here albeit with themes by Lennon and McCartney - just imagine the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy to Can't buy me love . . . . .\n\nThe movements are:\n\n1. Miniature Overture (Help!)\n\n2. March (When I'm 64)\n\n3. Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy (Can't buy me love)\n\n4. Arabian Dance (It's for you)\n\n5. Chinese Dance (Ticket to ride)\n\n6. Dance of the Reed Flutes (She loves you)\n\n7. Waltz of the Flowers (From me to you)\n\n8. Pas de Deux (All my loving)\n\nThis Suite was prepared by Gavin Sutherland for a recent CD recording which is available on an ASV CD entitled \"British by Arrangement\" played by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Gavin.\n\nDuration: 14 minutes\n\nNot for sale in USA or Asia\n\nA PACK comprises one full score, string parts 4/4/3/4/2 and all wind, brass and percussion parts.\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Pack (Orchestra) Lennon/McCartney 9790222235960 GMCO049\n\n£90.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Score (Orchestral Score) Lennon/McCartney 9790222235977 GMCO049-00\n\n£15.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Violin 1 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222235984 GMCO049-01\n\n£2.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Violin 2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222235991 GMCO049-02\n\n£2.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Viola (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236004 GMCO049-03\n\n£2.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Cello (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236011 GMCO049-04\n\n£2.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Bass (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236028 GMCO049-05\n\n£2.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Flute1+2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236035 GMCO049-06\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Flute3/Picc (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236042 GMCO049-07\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Oboe1+2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236059 GMCO049-08\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Clarinet 1 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236066 GMCO049-09\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Clarinet 2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236073 GMCO049-10\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Bassoon1+2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236080 GMCO049-11\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Horn1+2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236097 GMCO049-12\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Horn3+4 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236103 GMCO049-13\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Trumpet1+2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236110 GMCO049-14\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Trombone1+2 (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236127 GMCO049-15\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Trombone3+Tuba (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236134 GMCO049-16\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Timpani (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236141 GMCO049-17\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Percussion (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236158 GMCO049-18\n\n£1.50\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Harp (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236165 GMCO049-19\n\n£2.00\n\nBeatlecracker Suite Celeste/Piano (Orchestral Part) Lennon/McCartney 9790222236172 GMCO049-20\n\n£1.50"
