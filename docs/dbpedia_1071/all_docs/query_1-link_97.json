        "text": "Little musical gems\n\nAPRIL 2020\n\nEach day during the lockdown in France, I decided to publish a short musical anecdote, an assortment of musical tales relating to recordings that hold either a personal resonance or is a particular favourite. Some you may know, others perhaps not. Either way I hope you enjoy discovering or rediscovering these works.\n\nLittle musical gems #122\n\nMonteverdi often composed music of emotional intensity and strove to create unprecedented passion and dramatic contrast in his works. Poppea was composed in 1642 and the performance took place at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the Carnival season in 1643.\n\nThis work was rightly regarded as one of the pivotal and milestones in operatic history and the first known opera which Monteverdi was inspired by actual historical events to publish it, rather than drawing on mythology. It takes its cue from Roman history: the relationship between the Roman aristocrat Sabina Poppea and Emperor Nero and relies heavily on the decidedly human failings that drove them. It was not only becoming the driving force behind a new and unique form of entertainment, but Monteverdi also took opera in a whole new direction.\n\nThe plot gave Monteverdi a long-awaited opportunity to demonstrate the developments and changes in characters and the libretto (composed by Gian Francesco Busenello), promoted Monteverdi’s adoption of Marinist musical techniques and idiom. He rose to meet the challenge with every devices and subtlety in his artistic armoury. Ground basses, balanced forms, key themes, arioso-recitatives, vocal embellishments, contrasting ritornels – these and many more are deployed with all the art of a mature musician intent on raising opera to a new level of emotional experience.\n\nThe seeping of blood as the tragedy ensues makes a powerful point and above all, the Shakespearean quality of Monteverdi’s imagination, that was unparalleled in opera before Mozart.\n\nNero and Poppea were treasured to one another, and sing one of the most beautiful and intimate of all Monteverdi’s duets for they were clear that his music itself is the treasure and shining brilliantly through no matter what arrangement, orchestration, or adaption might be foisted upon it.\n\nThis aria sung here by Sonya Yoncheva (Poppea) and Kate Lindsay (Nero) is one of the most seductive interpretations where the two voices contain a richness and variety that lends to the drama of this dangerous liaison.\n\nLittle musical gems #121\n\nEarlier this month, we lost the greatest jazz composer since Thelonious Monk. Observing the outpouring of tributes that followed demonstrates just how influential Wayne Shorter was to every generation of not only jazz, but also pop, world and classical music artists.\n\nShorter led a musical life that spanned a panoply of styles and configurations, all suffused in his own idiosyncratic melding of sounds and sensibilities which seemed to reach from the heat-center of the earth to the infinite expanses of the cosmos. He was simply, “beyond category” not only for his unique instrumental style and compositions but for his perspectival brilliance.\n\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey on August 25, 1933, Shorter had his first great jazz epiphany as a teenager seeing Lester Young when he was 15 years old. The whole scene impressed him so much that at 16, he decided to pick up the clarinet.\n\nSwitching to tenor saxophone, Shorter formed a teenage band in Newark called The Jazz Informers. While still in high school, Shorter participated in several cutting contests on Newark’s jazz scene, including one memorable encounter with sax great Sonny Stitt. He attended college at New York University while also soaking up the Manhattan jazz scene by frequenting popular nightspots like Birdland and Cafe Bohemia. Wayne worked his way through college by playing with the Nat Phipps orchestra.\n\nUpon graduation and just as he was beginning making his mark, Shorter was drafted into the US army. During the two years of service, he practised assiduously and played for weekend sessions. Recruited on his release by the trumpeter Maynard Ferguson, he was soon poached by Blakey to become a member of the Jazz Messengers. Four years with Blakey gave Shorter a significant presence on the jazz scene, resulting in a series of well-received albums under his own name for the Blue Note label.\n\nIt was no surprise when, in 1964, he accepted an invitation to join Davis’s quintet. After Coltrane’s departure four years earlier, the trumpeter had hired and fired a succession of saxophonists before finding the voice he really needed alongside his own. Shorter’s sensibility was perfectly attuned to the riddles with which Davis shook his sidemen out of established patterns of thought. When he was asked, “Wayne, do you get tired of playing music that sounds like music?”, Shorter understood.\n\nAlthough regarded throughout his career as a nurturer more than a leader, Shorter said he believed from his earliest days as a player that music was an act of personal assertion and investment in one’s inner being. “Jazz for me,” he said, “is, ‘Do you have the guts to do it ?’ ”\n\nThis post is dedicated to my dear friend Nicholas Snowman who died tragically on March 2 of this year. He enjoyed reading these musical vignettes.\n\nLittle musical gems #120\n\nFranz who ? Franz Schreker was a child of the fin de siècle and as such, his lush, expressive and sonorous music corresponded entirely to the indulgent attitude to life of the time.\n\nHe was born in Monaco in 1878. With the sudden death of his father in 1888, the family to Vienna, where his musical journey began. It was the city of Brahms and Bruckner, and was one of the most important, if not the most important, music centre in Europe. Everyone was dancing to the waltz sounds of a certain Johann Strauss.\n\nDuring Schreker’s studies at the Vienna conservatory, Alexander Zemlinsky and Gustav Mahler became influential musical figures in Vienna, and a new generation of composers formed around Arnold Schoenberg. They all knew each other, met in the city's coffee houses and discussed the new cultural ideas. With the premiere of his opera Der ferne Klang in 1912, Franz Schreker rose to become one of the leading composers of his time.\n\nHis subsequent stage works, Die Gezeichneten (1915) and Der Schätzgräber(1918), made him the most frequently performed opera composer of his day, even ahead of Richard Strauss. Again and again he emphasised that he drew inspiration from the subconscious – entirely in accordance with the new insights of Freudian psychoanalysis. Dreams, illusions, and the sensuous but simultaneously destructive play between man and woman determined the subjects of his operas.\n\nDuring this particularly productive period of his career, Schreker continued to concentrate on opera but also gave plenty of thought to his instrumental music. In fact, it was during the mid-1910s that he wrote what is probably his most famous work, the Chamber Symphony.\n\nSchreker’s work is now overshadowed by many pieces with the same name, such as the famous examples by Schoenberg. However, it is by no means inferior to any of the more renowned works that surround it. Lushly orchestrated despite its minimal instrumentation and full of incredibly compelling moments throughout its 24 minutes, Schreker’s Chamber Symphony is a forgotten masterpiece of the 20th century.\n\nFor years, Schreker’s music faced restrictions as a result of Nazi ideology, and suppression of his works rendered him virtually forgotten in music history. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, revivals of his operas generated new interest, and since that time performances of his instrumental and operatic music have been steadily increasing.\n\nLittle musical gems #119\n\nSt. Valentine's Day is around the corner. It is time for \"Fêtes Galantes\".\n\nFor the English, \"Fêtes Galantes\" is one of those glorious French phrases that sounds so wonderful but is nigh on impossible to translate. It originates from Watteau’s first picture for the Academie des Beaux Arts 'L'Embarquement pour Cythère', depicting this imagined mythological land where courtship parties take place and where humans supposedly lived in leisurely harmony with nature. His painting shows charming bucolic scenes with a hint of theatricality, with a group of lovers seemingly departing for the island of Cythera. Cythera was the birthplace of Venus and the lovers departing for her island is taken as emblematic of the transience of love. It is the land of amusement by flirting, dancing and celebrating\n\nDebussy frequently drew inspiration from contemporary sources, but for “L'Isle Joyeuse”, he turned to the past, specifically to this painting by Watteau. L’Isle joyeuse is surely his happiest, his most overtly exuberant and thrilling work. Debussy successfully reproduces through music the spirit of the fêtes galantes displaying obvious affinity between his tonal-schemes in “half-tints of pearl-gray mists, violet twilights and sunshine the hue of pale primroses” and the atmospheric colour of Watteau’s canvases.\n\nIn the original piano version (Molinari, with Debussy's approval, made an orchestral arrangement), the sound seems to give us the idea that the performer is one of the characters in the painting - at first seeming superficial, but then conveying a deeper sensibility. Each listener can make the character himself or herself. There’s dancing, there’s a pause for thought, there’s the joy in being on the Isle of Love. Details from Debussy’s own life - at the time of composing this work, he too was escaping to an island with his new found love Emma Bardac - are also surely responsible for inspiring this spirited music.\n\nL’isle joyeuse is a spectacular work for the piano, themes are tossed about in a rush of increasing gaiety and gradually building exhilaration, slipping easily between tonal centres in a bright tonal world brimming with melodic major thirds, augmented chords and whole tone scales. After a bustling march builds up to a sonorous fanfare of triumph, the lyrical second theme reaches its apotheosis in an explosion of orchestral thunder that issues into a luminous vibration of shimmering tremolos, to end the piece with a plunge from the top to the very bottom of the keyboard.\n\nIts proud creator wrote to his publisher: “This piece seems to embrace every possible manner of treating the piano, combining as it does strength with grace, if I may presume to say so.”\n\nLittle musical gems #118\n\nThe German word « Sternstunde » literally translated as «hour of the stars», in musical terms equates to a concert that reaches celestial heights of brilliance and revelation. It's hard to describe what it feels like to hear one of these cosmically powerful performances, but you know one when you hear it and I recall Claudio Abbado achieved it during a performance with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra and Mahler’s second Symphony.\n\nAbbado epitomised elegance, and in his youth he had the charisma and style of a Fellini or Antonioni star driving an Alfa Romeo convertible through the streets of Swinging Sixties Rome. That he would become an important conductor was never in doubt. But what made him so great ?\n\nBorn into a family of musicians and academics in Milan in 1933, Abbado studied composition, piano and conducting in Milan. Following graduation, he won a conducting competition in America, and made important debuts in Vienna and La Scala. But Abbado shunned the limelight and honed his musicianship by teaching chamber music in Parma for three years. After this self-imposed isolation, his career took off, and he quickly became one of the most important musical presences in the world. He was in charge of the opera of La Scala in Milan for nearly two decades, from 1968-86, was with the London Symphony Orchestra from 1979 until 1988, and after a stint with the Vienna Staatsoper, came his nomination succeeding Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nAbbado had a special connection with Mahler. It was with Mahler's Second Symphony that Abbado made his debut with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1965 and the same Symphony was the climax of his inaugural programmes with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, which he founded in 2003.\n\nAbbado talked of the choral finale of the Second Symphony - Mahler's coruscating vision of spiritual rebirth - as a metaphor for his own musical experience. Among Mahler's text for that movement are the lines : What was created, must pass away - what passed away, must rise ! - Cease to tremble ! - Prepare yourself ! - Prepare yourself to live !\n\nAbbado saw this as meaning that music is both destroyed and redeemed by its temporality it exists and is extinguished in a moment, but has the endless possibility of being created anew in time. But in the context of Abbado's journey through illness (he was diagnosed with stomach cancer), it's impossible not to hear the personal resonance : it was his own rebirth he was celebrating in those performances, in the company of the players he handpicked to play in the Lucerne Festival Orchestra's first concerts.\n\nAs to what makes him so great ? During an interview he once said « My grandfather used to take me for walks in the mountains, and he didn't say very much. I learned from him to listen to silence. And for me, listening is the most important thing: to listen to each other, to listen to what people say, to listen to music ».\n\nLittle musical gems #117\n\nIt’s a chime that we recognise instantly. Constructed simply of four notes - G sharp, F sharp, E and B - this sequence known as the « Westminster Quarters » is struck in various permutations to mark the quarter hours on Big Ben, the clock in Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe Quarters had actually originated, not in London, but as a peal written in 1793 for St. Mary the Great, the university church in Cambridge. It is not known who composed the chime, though it is often attributed to William Crotch, an undergraduate at the time. Others suggest in the initial four-note motif an echo of the aria ‘I know that my redeemer liveth’ from Handle’s Messiah, but the link is not conclusive.\n\nBy the time the French musician Louis Vierne arrived in England for a short recital tour in January 1924, he was already a well-known figure. Titular organist at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris since 1900, Vierne was also a celebrated composer, with four organ symphonies and a host of other works to his credit.\n\nOne of the recitals Vierne played in England was at Westminster Cathedral in London, where a new organ was being built in stages. Its designer, Henry Willis III, was at the concert and at one point he apparently hummed a tune to Vierne. The tune in question was the Westminster Quarters and as a reponse, the organist masterfully weaved and improvisation on the tune.\n\nThere is no precise record of how Vierne expanded on the Quarters theme at his Westminster Cathedral concert, but its potential clearly interested him, and three years after the 1924 recital, Vierne returned to the Quarters again, in a swirlingly flamboyant work entitled « Carillon de Westminster ».\n\nIt is a relatively short piece, but includes a large variety of colour and incident into its six-minute span. Vierne gradually builds an imposing edifice of sound from the four basic Westminster Quartiers motifs (including, for some reason, a slightly misquoted second « quarter »), drawing on the massive tonal and technical resources of the French symphonic organ tradition.\n\nVierne dedicated the published score ‘to my friend Henry Willis, organ builder in London’, and played it at the inauguration of the restored Notre-Dame organ in 1932.\n\nOne day this organ will once again be heard, and with it who knows, perhaps this piece !\n\nLittle musical gems #116\n\n“A happy smile lit up the face of every listener, caused by the musical excitement of the wonderful waltz rhythms”. The reviewer’s comments refer to a « special concert » performed by the Vienna Philharmonic in the famous Golden Hall of the city’s Musikverein on the morning of 31st December 1939, a Sunday.\n\nAnnounced as a « New Year’s Eve Concert », the event switched to 1st January in 1941, generating an unbroken run of over 80 Vienna New Year concerts which continues to the present.\n\nThe music of the Vienna New Year’s Concert is dominated by the Strauss family - Johann Strauss I, Johann Strauss II, Josef Strauss and Eduard Strauss. It occasionally includes other composers, for example, in 2009, the fourth movement of Haydn’s Farewell Symphony was performed to mark the 200th anniversary of his death.\n\nThe encores usually begin with a fast polka, followed by Strauss II’s The Blue Danube and Strauss I’s Radetsky March, during which the audience claps along under the direction of the conductor. Dance is also incorporated into the musical offerings as pairs of ballet dancers from the Vienna State Opera Ballet usually appear in the second part of the program, adding an elegant touch to the concert.\n\nOriginating around the World War period, the Vienna New Year’s Concert was initially conceived for the local Austrians as a source of hope for a better future. Nowadays, it encourages millions of music lovers around the world by bringing joy and optimism for the New Year ahead. However, the formative phase of the New Year’s Concert - the Nazi era - went unexamined in Austria and abroad until the past decade. Today, those years are extensively documented on the Philharmonic’s website.\n\nInternational music history in particular can make an important contribution to a critical assessment of Austria’s role in National Socialism, World War II and the Holocaust. Josef Krips, who conducted the January 1st 1946, concert noted succinctly: “I began 1946 with the first New Year’s Concert in peacetime.”\n\nIn 1980, Lorin Maazel became the first non-Austrian conductor of the concert and became one of the most frequently appeared conductors in this major event. In 2005, Lorin Maazel omitted the Radetzky March to pay tribute to the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The practice of choosing a different conductor every year began in 1987, after seven consecutive appearances by Maazel. Members of the VPO vote for the conductor of the following year and the result is usually announced at the end of each year’s New Year Concert. The 2024 Concert will as announced be conducted by Christian Thielmann.\n\nHappy New Year to you all and I look forward to sharing more Little Musical Gems in 2023 !\n\nLittle musical gems #115\n\nIn light of Christmas approaching, I thought it would be appropriate to contemplate the beauty and meaning in an ancient Christmas text, O magnum mysterium. The origin of this Nativity poem is in itself a great mystery. It is not a biblical text. The poem was incorporated in mediaeval times into the Divine Office as the fourth of the nine Responsories for Matins on Christmas Day. This dates back to one of three periods of major reform of Catholic liturgy : either those of Pope Gregory VII in the eleventh century or less possibly the Carolingian reforms of the eighth-ninth centuries or even as far back as those of Pope Gregory I.\n\nO magnum mysterium has an associated plainchant melody, and has been sung in this form since the middle ages. However, the text has appealed to many composers over the years. Some of the earliest settings were published in the mid 1500s.\n\nMany of the most notable composers of the renaissance period include William Byrd, Jacob Clemens non Papa, Cristóbal de Morales, Palestrina and Tomás Luis de Victoria. Victoria went on to publish a mass based on his motet in 1592.\n\nI adore Byrd’s account. It is delivered in glorious choral counterpoint. A warm, subtle blend of ethereal voices with deep, resonant harmonies that relay the text :\n\nO great mystery,\n\nand wonderful sacrament,\n\nthat animals should see the new-born Lord,\n\nlying in a manger!\n\nBlessed is the Virgin whose womb\n\nwas worthy to bear\n\nChrist the Lord.\n\nAlleluia!\n\nHe evokes the mystery and wonderment of the nativity story. It’s music which seems poised somewhere between terror and exultation and the voices imitate one another, gradually unfolding in soaring waves of sound.\n\nA searing intensity characterizes this performance by conductor John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir. We hear a powerful, almost lamenting quality of the rising and falling tenor line just before the final, serene resolution.\n\nSeason’s greeting to all !\n\nLittle musical gems #114\n\nRepertoire to dazzle your friends with – and play “guess the composer !“\n\nNikolai Kapustin has remained largely obscure until recent decades, thanks to Marc-André Hamelin’s recordings in the early 2000s. Since then, his works have continued to charm listeners and pianists, especially the younger generation. Known for his energetic and virtuosic music, Kapustin amalgamated the harmonic language of jazz music with forms from classical music, creating surprising synergy.\n\nClassically trained in both piano and composition, Kapustin was bitten by the jazz bug but could never improvise with the ease of his idols. Considering this, composition seemed a natural step forward for him and furthermore he was far too interested in the jazz style to consider competing with his peers such as Richter, Gilels and Oborin for a place among the top Soviet classical pianists.\n\nDuring the course of the 1950s, Kapustin began acquiring a reputation as a jazz pianist, arranger and composer, devoting himself almost exclusively to piano and developing a style that fuses classical approach to form with jazz approach to harmony and rhythm, characterised by an unparalleled richness and zest all his own. Kapustin created jazz piano music teeming with energetic spontaneity and bristling with the kind of creative immediacy one associates with improvisation (although the music is fully and meticulously written out).\n\nIn 1961 he formed a jazz quintet, played with Juri Saulsky’s band in Moscow, and toured extensively in Russia and abroad with Oleg Lundstrom’s Jazz Orchestra. There is a rare video clip of Kapustin playing piano with the Lundstrom band on the Russian TV program Goluboj ogonek in 1964.\n\nKapustin was eagerly seizing on all the new music that was beginning to come in from America – Oscar Peterson, Art Tatum, Herbie Hancock, Bill Evans. By the time the wall came down it was not so much a question of Russia suddenly being flooded with jazz in real time but of the western world suddenly discovering him.\n\nIn terms of their stylistic breadth, formidable technical challenges and audacious invention, the Eight Concert Études (1984) hold their own against the celebrated benchmarks in the genre, from Liszt and Lyapunov to Godowsky’s re-worked Chopin. The Five Études in Different Intervals (1992) begins with a madcap study in minor seconds recalling the bouncy demeanor of Zez Confrey’s Kitten on the Keys and ends with an octave study to end all octave studies. Throughout, Kapustin’s bottomless well of thematic resoursefulness works overtime and Hamelin’s technical prowess and his exceptional affinity with jazz fuse to create one of the most sparkling, infectiously foot-tapping interpretations you could wish to hear.\n\nLittle musical gems #113\n\nThere are very few recordings that exist of this baker’s dozen of miniatures. Evocatively titled and often sounding deceptively simple, they come from a similar impulse to that of Schumann’s Kinderszenen or Grieg’s Lyric Pieces.\n\nLetters to his friends indicate that Dvořák composed them to be performed together as a collection and they work well this way, not just because they tell an extended story but because each fits into the sonic context of what comes before.\n\nThe Poetic Tone Pictures were written in 1889 and comprise 13 vignettes. Despite their relative obscurity, they are significant as they show the composer’s willingness to diverge from more conventional forms (like his symphonies) to explore a more scenic and atmospheric world of sound. The opening “Twilight Way” is under 5 minutes but contains an amplitude of variety, including some unexpected twists and turns. The way Andsnes (who incidentally is one of my favourite living pianists), plays, evokes reflections of the setting sun on the water and lets us appreciate Dvořák’s lovely harmonic color changes.\n\nRanging in mood from profound to playful, the other movements include evocations of magic and mystery (“The Old Castle”), rustic dances (“Furiant” and “Peasant Ballad”), and a solemn reminiscence (“At a Hero’s Grave”).\n\nDvořák said : “Regrettably, precious few pianists will have the courage to play them all one after another, but only thus can the listener form the right picture of what I had in mind.” When he first approached the cycle, for a competition at the age of twelve, Andsnes himself only performed selections, and it was not until the recent pandemic lockdowns that he delved deeper into the Poetic Tone Pictures and committed to performing and recording the set in its entirety.\n\nLet us appreciate Twilight Way in this ethereal interpretation by Andsnes.\n\nLittle musical gems #112\n\nSchubert’s electrifying musical account of Goethe’s poem about a father with an ailing child in his arms, racing towards help but being thwarted by the illusions of the Erlkönig has always generated dramatic performances.\n\nThe singer has to project 4 different voices (the narrator, the father, the child, and the Erlkönig), conveying the worry of the father, the fretting of the child, and the temptations of the Erlkönig. But it’s the piano that established the urgency through its first pounding entrance. When we finally draw up, it’s that final, fatal pause before the last two words, ‘war todt’ that shines a light on the futility of the journey.\n\nInteresting then to read that it is the contention of the American composer George Crumb that Schubert’s setting of Goethe’s poem was an inspiration to the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca’s poem “Song of the Rider, 1860,” which Crumb used in two of his works, Madrigals, Book II (1965), where he just set 4 lines, and in Songs, Drones and Refrains of Death (1968) where he set García Lorca’s entire poem.\n\nMuch like Erlkönig, Crumb’s version starts at a dead run with the instructions: ‘breathlessly, with relentlessly driving rhythm!’. The work, for baritone, electric instruments, and percussion, carries the motion of the black horse through the wild, hammered rhythms played on lujon, crotales, drums, mallet instruments, and electric harpsichord.\n\nCrumb’s music is far removed from Schubert, but with the help of the horse, we can see how Crumb’s madrigal set only 4 lines of the orginal poem because of the basis of his longer and more dramatic setting.\n\nLittle musical gems #111\n\nI often write about lesser known works and artists for these « Little Musical Gems », but in attending a concert recently of the complete Bach Cello Suites, I shall break the trend, and discuss this well known work, but perhaps conclude with an interpretation you might not have considered.\n\nBach wrote six beautiful suites for solo cello. The cello is probably the closest instrument to the human voice in terms of range and pitch. The sound of solo cello is compelling and the sonic architecture of Bach makes it even more special.\n\nThese suites may have been lost to the dustbin of history, had Pablo Casals not discovered them in a Barcelona music store. He had to transcribe it in order to adapt for the modern cello - Bach wrote it for a five or six string instrument. Casals felt it was a spiritual experience playing these six suites, which he did most of his life first thing after morning coffee. He truly opened the book for all cellists who followed him, and we owe him a debt of gratitude for all the great versions that came after him.\n\nInterestingly, Bach didn’t indicate tempo markings, so the cellists are able to choose their own phrasing and time. No two versions, fortunately, of these suites are alike. Einstein once commented on the perfection of nature reflected in the symmetry of a chambered nautilus. I would add to this the symmetry of Bach, is honoured and celebrated by many terrific recordings that are available. Those who love this repertoire, has I am sure, one preferred version of this timeless work. For me I leave you with this powerful interpretation from the great, late Janos Starker.\n\nLittle musical gems #110\n\nI’ve particularly enjoyed reflecting on this week’s « Little Musical Gem » and discovering the music of Carlos Chávez. I stumbled upon him whilst making research on a contemporary of his, Aaron Copland.\n\nCarlos Chávez is revered as one of the most influential composers, conductors, and music educators in Mexican history. His family often visited regions where the rich culture of indigenous peoples deeply influenced him. After the Mexican Revolution, Chávez became one of the first composers to create Mexican nationalist music inspired by the Aztecs. He excelled as a conductor, leading Mexico’s top orchestras as well as ensembles around the world.\n\nAs a composer, Chávez is often associated with Copland. Both composers worked to create a distinct musical sound world that spoke to their home countries at a time when Europe was seen as the only serious and legitimate contributor to classical music. They wrote each other regularly, and when Chávez sent Copland a letter in 1931 expressing his annoyance at “self-important” and “prima donna” attitudes in Europe, Copland responded by saying, “All you wrote about music in America awoke a responsive echo in my heart. I am through with Europe, Carlos, and I believe as you do, that our salvation must come from ourselves.”\n\nWhere Copland embraced a populist Americana sound, Chávez was a Modernist, and composer Belá Bartók might be a more apt comparison for his musical styling than Copland. Just as Bartók collected and immersed himself in the folk music of his native Hungary, Chávez absorbed native Mexican music in his youth to such an extent that his own compositional voice was thoroughly imbued with its essence, which he fused with modernist techniques, such as Stravinsky or Schoenberg.\n\nBut Chávez was not simply a “Mexican composer” – other works may sound more closely related to Shostakovich, Britten, or Prokofiev. Or he can sound like no one else, as in his impressive Piano Concerto. Sadly no recording exists of Claudio Arrau, who premiered the concerto at a performance in Mexico in 1943, but I leave you with this recording to discover the work yourselves.\n\nLittle musical gems #109\n\nIt’s hard to imagine but the first Parisian retrospective devoted to the Austrian artist Oskar Kokoschka (1886–1980), is currently showing at the Musée d’Art Moderne (MAM).\n\nKokoschka emerged out of the Art Nouveau movement in Vienna but his energetic and spontaneous painting style reveals the influence of Van Gogh and the Berlin art scene on his work rather than the more decorative style of his Viennese compatriots Kustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.\n\nIn 1920, the Viennese art historian Karl Swoboda sponsored concerts at his home and of those present was Kokoschka himself. As he listened, he drew 20 chalk portraits of two women in the audience, one of whom was Kamilla Swoboda, wife of Karl. In 1921, 10 of the images were issued as a portfolio called Variationen über ein Thema.\n\nWe are faced with a conundrum – Kokoschka has given us the listener’s reactions but to music that we can no longer hear. We can only imagine what music was actually played at the concert in 1920.\n\nIn 1928, the composer Hans Erick Apostel answered this problem with « Variationen über ein Thema von O. Kokoschka ». He sent them to the artist, who thanked him and who told him that the work ‘had received well-deserved applause.’\n\nApostel took the implied music and the psychological effect this had on the women in the images and worked backward to create the music that he thought they were listening to. He wrote, for the unheard concert, music that combined both the tonal language of pure Viennese classicism with a heightened expressionist style. We have Viennese tonality with chromaticism, classical pianism with explorations of the various registers of the piano, and get, in the end, a very modernist work.\n\nIt is, as always, up to the listener and art viewer to decide if Apostel captured Kokoshka’s intentions. In any case, when you see the portraits, the listeners in the images seem to have all been particularly attentive, listening with cocked head and often in pensive positions.\n\nLittle musical gems #108\n\nDuring her 70-year reign, Queen Elizabeth II garnered many contributions from some of the best classical composers of our age.\n\nTraditionally, the British monarchy has employed a composer known as Master of the Queen's (or King's) Music since 1626, a position equal to the Poet Laureate and although the Queen reigned over vast swathes of the Commonwealth, her early years were marked by musical contributions from British composers.\n\nOrb and Sceptre by William Walton, composed in the style of coronation marches, was commissioned for Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the throne in 1952. Walton didn't hold the post Master of Queen/King's music, but he was the go-to composer for these marches, having also composed Crown Imperial for the coronation of the Queen's father, George VI.\n\nOther British composers also contributed to the new monarch's reign, the most significant being a collection called A Garland for the Queen. The collection was inspired by a 1601 publication of madrigals called The Triumphs of Oriana, which celebrates the reign of Elizabeth I. A notable song from this book is Dance, Clarion Air by Michael Tippett.\n\nSince her accession in 1952, there has been four composers to the post of Masters of Queen's music : Sir Arthur Bliss, Malcolm Williamson, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and Judith Weir.\n\nMaxwell Davies dedicated his Symphony No. 9 to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012. It was premiered on June 9, 2012. He also oversaw the publication of the Choirbook for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, a collection of 44 contemporary choral anthems. Maxwell Davies's contribution, Advent Calendar, was based on a poem by Rowan Williams, who was the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time.\n\nSo as we turn a page in British history, I leave you with this interpretation of Advent Calendar.\n\nLittle musical gems #107\n\nHello to everyone after the summer break for this new season of \"Little Musical Gems\".\n\nDuring the car journey back from our holiday getaway, the series \"Un été avec Jankélévitch\" was playing on the airwaves. I have always been intrigued by his philosophies on music. Readers are graced to his interdisciplinary prose of unbound originality, at once intellectually stimulating and asthetically alluring.\n\nJankélévitch is one of the few twentieth century scholars who contributed to the field of philopsophy and music with equal zeal. He was a talented pianist, a sensitive listener and a virtuosic intellectual polymath. In his 1949 monograph on Debussy, Jankélévitch begins by drawing the distinction between the mystery and the secret of the composer’s music. Debussy is a core staple in my repertoire, and it is true, the more one learns about Debussy, the more the enigma grows.\n\nDebussy’s compositional inspirations often come from nature : La mer, Le vent dans la plaine, Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l’air du soir (Baudelaire), Brouillards, to name a few, and also this work that resounded with Jankélévitch \"Des pas sur la neige\" from his first book of Préludes.\n\nThis piece is a study in suspended time. A certain forlornness, even despondency becomes apparent, although not altogether without hope. The title translates as ‘footsteps on the snow’, not ‘in the snow’. What a sublime poetic image of treading ever so carefully…\n\nI leave with you this wonderfully ethereal interpretation by Michelangeli.\n\nLittle musical gems #106\n\nSummer is here and in this last post before taking a seasonal break,I shall let you discover this work that concertgoers at Symphony Hall in 1948 in Boston listened as Eleanor Steber sang for them of summer evenings:\n\nIt has become that time of evening when people sit on their porches, rocking gently and talking gently and watching the street…\n\nThe words are James Agee’s, excerpts from a portrait of his boyhood in Knoxville and set to music by Samuel Barber. They are poignant words that spoke convincingly to Steber and Barber both of their own upbringings in small-town America.\n\nSteber had commissioned the work for soprano and orchestra a year earlier, and when Barber showed her the finished score she was thrilled beyond imagining. She wrote in her memoir that “It was Sam’s discerning eye and ear which enabled him to cut and lift bits of Agee’s text faultlessly and set them to unforgettable music.”\n\nBarber’s own father was dying at this time, and the composer was overwhelmed by the similarity of his and Agee’s childhood memories and fears. He wrote this rhapsody for soprano and orchestra in three weeks.\n\nSteber was a fearless singer, as adept in Mozart, Verdi and Strauss as she was in Rodgers, Gershwin and Kern. At the Met she sang 427 performances of 34 roles, including the leads in Met premieres of Arabella, Die Entfűhrung aus dem Serail, and Wozzeck. She appeared there often and long enough to be taken for granted by Met audiences, but her many recordings attest to the versatility and beauty of her singing.\n\nHer home town of Wheeling, West Virginia, is only a few hundred miles from Knoxville, and Steber was close enough in age to both Agee and Barber to understand and share their memories of the joys and terrors of a small town American childhood. She sang the 1948 premiere of “Knoxville” with Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra; this recording was made two years later, with William Strickland and the Dumbarton Oaks Chamber Orchestra. A truly exquisite orchestral lieder with the most sincere pathos imaginable.\n\nI wish you all a wonderful summer and look forawrd to returning in September for more \"Little Musical Gems\".\n\nLittle musical gems #105\n\nA recent visit to Rome reminded me of Ottorino Respighi. A composer that falls into that unenviable category whose reputation rests unduly on a particular work, or group of compositions. In his case it is the so-called ‘Roman Trilogy’ with which he is perennially associated, three separately conceived orchestral pieces penned between 1916-1928, his prime creative period.\n\nThe popularity of the Trilogy has often been attributed to Respighi’s undeniable brilliance as an orchestrator, his ability to conjure a kaleidosocopic range of crowd-pleasing colours and impressions from his instrumental palette. Closer inspection however, and more sensitive interpretations of it, reveal a composer of refined sensibilities, capable of exquisite delicacy of expression, a man deeply interested in and temperamentally attuned to both the music of the past and the immense richness of his nation’s historical and artistic heritage.\n\nRespighi had in fact already been writing impressively for more modest forces earlier in his career. Shortly after Fountains of Rome he had produced the first of what would become three suites for smaller orchestra of Ancient Airs and Dances, elegant pieces based on lute music of the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThese compositions are symptomatic of Respighi’s deep and abiding interest in the (mainly Italian) music of bygone eras. Inspired by his studies with Torchi and Martucci at the Liceo Musicale in Bologna, he was an ‘early music’ specialist avant la lettre, and wearing his musicological hat an indefatigable editor of at that time little-known composers such as Monteverdi, Frescobaldi, Tartini and Vitali. He also produced transcriptions of works by Marcello, Boccherini, Pergolesi, and Cimarosa.\n\nLittle musical gems #104\n\nRossini can name claim to at least ten dishes dedicated to him. If he had not been the composer he was, perhaps he might have been a famous chef or food critic !\n\nIn his biography of the composer, Stendhal wrote that the aria of Tancredi, \"Di Tanti Palpiti,\" known throughout Europe, was not only the most popular opera aria of its time, but was familiarly refered to as the \"rice aria\" because Rossini composed it while waiting for his risotto to cook in Venice one day.\n\nOne of the greatest Rossini interpreters, in her prime, Marilyn Horne was a star singer, singing with Pavarotti and Sutherland, Sills and Domingo, under the batons of Bernstein, Karajan and dozens more.\n\nHorne had significant influence as a singer, in part due to her choice of repertory but she is also remembered for her range of music repertoire, starting out as a young singer in Los Angeles, when she hobnobbed with Stravinsky (whose “Oedipus Rex” was the vehicle of her La Scala debut in 1969) through to the voice-over for Dorothy Dandridge in the film of “Carmen Jones.”\n\nSome of the works she championed, like Handel operas, have become opera-house staples to a degree no one could have imagined as late as in 1984, when she got the Metropolitan Opera to put on “Rinaldo,” the first Handel opera the company had ever staged.\n\nRossini was another, even greater, calling card. Horne seems born to sing this repertoire: her combination of agility and dramatic heft yield thrilling results and she is noted for the seamless quality and exceptional range and flexibility of her voice, especially in coloratura roles where Horne had her greatest successes in such “trouser roles” as Rossini’s Tancredi and Handel’s Rinaldo. Because of her ability to sing roles that had been originally written for the castrati (who had both an upper range and great vocal power), Horne was known for resurrecting seldom-performed operas. Horne’s efforts were rewarded in 1982, when she was awarded the first Golden Plaque of the Rossini Foundation, honouring her as “the greatest Rossini singer in the world.”\n\nLittle musical gems #103\n\nOne man’s gimmick is another man’s innovation : Kodály fundamentally altered the cello’s tuning to achieve the effect of his solo sonata, a characteristically veering work that has many champions in the cello world. This is truly a cellist’s cello piece.\n\nIn 1915, when Kodály wrote a substantial Sonata for Solo Cello, Bartók commented : \"This is not a mere imitation of Bach's polyphonic style\". That was praise in several ways. His friend's sonata had nothing to do with what was old and German, but rather it was contemporary and Hungarian. And it was new.\n\nWith this Sonata Kodály was one of the first composers to enrich the repertoire for solo cello, since the Bach Solo Suites for cello composed two hundred years earlier.\n\nHad Starker left us with no other performance on vinyl, then his interpretation of the Kodály sonata stands out for its impetuous, impassioned sweep in the outer movements and the vocal quality of the central Adagio’s long, sustained lower-register passages.\n\nHe was one of the most accomplished and proficient cellists of modern times, and among all of the various compositions that he performed and recorded over his long career, the Sonata for Unaccompanied Cello must take pride of place.\n\nStarker performed this work for the composer in 1939 when he was just 15 years old, first privately and then in concert in Budapest. Starker was the first to record it (at 78 rpm), in Paris in 1948, and he received the Grand Prix du Disque award for that recording. When the two met shortly before Kodály's death in 1967, the composer told Starker \"If you correct the ritard in the third movement, it will be the Bible performance\".\n\nLittle musical gems #102\n\nClair de Lune, the third movement of Suite Bergamasque, is one of Debussy’s best loved works. Its origins are complex and fascinating, combining influences from poetry, the music of the Baroque period and Impressionism.\n\nThe title comes from a poem of the same name, published in 1869, by the Symbolist poet Paul Verlaine. Debussy had already set this poem for voice and piano twice before, along with 18 other Verlaine poems. The poem speaks of “au calme clair de lune triste et beau” (the still moonlight sad and lovely). It also describes “charmante masques et bergamasques”, which may have inspired the name of the whole suite.\n\nSuite Bergamasque is one of a number of works by Debussy and his French contemporaries that paid homage to the “style ancien”, which referred to the French Baroque period in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Referencing this style was popular after the mid-19th century.\n\nThe stillness and meditative calm of these lines are evoked with great beauty at the opening of the piece.\n\nThe vagaries of the breeze waft gently in the following passage with the instruction “tempo rubato”, a musical term allowing the performer to speed up and slow down the music at their discretion. This builds to an intense moment perhaps recalling a later passage in the poem:\n\n« Where the vague mist conjured up some vast\n\nDespairing milky ghost With the voice of teals crying As they called to each other, beating their wings ».\n\nClair de Lune is treasured for its ethereal beauty and sense of mystery. In the immortal words of Debussy himself :\n\n« We should be constantly reminding ourselves that the beauty of a work of art is something that will always remain mysterious; that is to say one can never find out exactly “how it is done”. At all costs let us preserve this element of magic peculiar to music. By its very nature music is more likely to contain something of the magical than any other art ».\n\nLittle musical gems #101\n\nFranz Liszt once said, “Mournful and grand is the destiny of an artist.” Could he have been referring to the seemingly large proportion of artists that suffered from some sort of mental disorder ?\n\nSergei Rachmaninov was one. He dealt with depression his whole life, but not only did he manage to overcome these difficult moments, his management of it fueled his composing.\n\nAfter the disastrous premiere of his First Symphony, Rachmaninov was plunged into a depression that lasted three years. He suffered insomnia and loss of confidence which halted any creativity. In desperation and on the advice of his aunt, he sought help from Dr. Nikolai Dahl, a hypnotherapist who also employed cognitive therapy techniques.\n\nRachmaninov recalled that at the end of each session, Dahl would place him in a trance and thus “you will begin to write your concerto…the concerto will be of excellent quality” were the mantras he heard ringing in his ears.\n\nAs the treatment progressed, Rachmaninov noticed his depression lift and he began work on a piece that would seal his reputation : the second piano concerto. The work is dedicated to Dr Dahl.\n\nAmong the many recordings I admire, I find John Ogden’s performance has a poetic vision of exquisite sensibility and compelling narrative.\n\nOgden was no stranger to the turmoils of psychiatric problems, the bouts of violence that would explode as a result of the cocktail of drugs that he was taking. His playing would be unpredictable - I recall Ruggerio Ricci recounting such incidents with Ogden whilst he was touring with him - but when he was on form, there was the transcendence of his playing, performances that could inspire and change the lives of musicians and audiences who heard him. This is why Ogden is a unique figure in the pantheon of 20th century pianists.\n\nLittle musical gems #100\n\nAs much of my musical identity is linked with Steinway pianos, it seemed appropriate to write my 100th « Little musical Gem » with an extraordinary tale about how Steinway kept music alive with their Victory Verticals.\n\nPianos dropping from the skies ? It is almost like a scene from a cartoon, yet this is precisely what happened with the Steinways that were built specifically for troops in World War II.\n\nDuring the war, the U.S. government essentially shut down the production of musical instruments in order to divert vital resources such as iron, copper, brass, and other materials to the war effort. Yet the government also determined that the war effort should include entertainment that could lift soldiers’ spirits. Music was deemed to be such a powerful morale boost and played an important role in this front providing soldiers with hours of entertainment, enrichement and outreach.\n\nHowever, the pianos needed to be adapted to withstand the trying conditions out in the field, including being packed into a crate and dropped out of a plane. An estimated 2,500 pianos were dropped to American soldiers fighting the war in three continents.\n\nMyra Hess a name we associate as one of the heroic wartime pianists recorded very little Chopin but this interpretation of the Nocturne evokes nostalgia and warmth like no other. Enjoy and thank you for continuing to read and listen to these little musical gems.\n\nLittle musical gems #99\n\nOlivier Messiaen was a towering figure in 20th century European music. His highly personal musical language drew heavily on the natural world, the music of Eastern cultures and, above all, his devout Catholicism. A talented pianist, Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1919 at a remarkably early age, and in 1927 joined Marcel Dupré’s organ class. In 1931 he was appointed Organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité (La Trinité) in Paris, where he would remain for more than sixty years, until his death.\n\nComposed in 1939, Les Corps glorieux represents one of these aforementioned distinct style in Messiaen’s music. A successor to the composer’s Christmas cycle for organ, La Nativité du Seigneur (1935), Les Corps glorieux concerns resurrection. It develops textures, harmonic modes and Hindu rhythms similar to those in La Nativité, but its movements are more rigorously interlinked. For many years Messiaen considered it his favourite work - perhaps a summation of his first compositional period.\n\nLes Corps glorieux was completed in late August 1939, shortly before Messiaen was called up for military service at the outbreak of the Second World War. Captured in June 1940, he was transported to the Görlitz prisoner-of-war camp in Silesia. The enforced separation from the organ loft stimulated Messiaen’s interest in birdsong which, significantly, he incorporated into the Quatuor pour la fin du temps, composed in the camp. He later stated “It is an instinctive passion. Birdsong is also my refuge.” In his weekly organ improvisations at La Trinité he began experimenting with more abstract music, incorporating birdsong and mathematical procedures and this can be heard in the opening of Les Corps glorieux with a flowing single-voiced (monodic) movement - Subtilité des Corps glorieux - reflecting the suppleness of resurrected bodies. Messiaen’s first monody, it is an elaboration of the opening phrases of the plainsong Salve Regina, applying rhythmic additions and chromatic alterations, and is played on the organ’s diverse and luminous cornet registers. Elements of the theme reappear in the final movement.\n\nRather amusingly, Messiaen always vehemently denied that there was any jazz influence in his music; it is most likely that he never heard any jazz, other than to satisfy an academic curiosity. Detractors of his music labeled this movement especially as jazz-inspired to provoke the composer. In fact, the main source for the rhythmic expansions and contractions stem from his very early days at the Paris Conservatoire where he was introduced to Greek rhythms by one of his composition professors, Maurice Emmanuel.\n\nThe joy and brightness of the resurrected is demonstrated in “Joie et Clarté” by the unashamed use of jazzy harmonies. An improvisatory solo trumpet melody dominates the movement - it alternates with the reflective sections, but concludes with an exuberant flourish.\n\nLittle musical gems #98\n\nThe piano piece “Für Alina” is one of the most petit, yet one of the most significant works in all of Arvo Pärt’s output. It was conceived in February 1976, the first work in a number of years, with which Pärt emerged from a prolonged creative crisis - it is also his first piece to be written in the tintinnabuli style (like the sound of a bell) a term coined by Pärt himself to describe his minimalist and meditative compositions.\n\nIn musical analysis, it is defined as the application of various inversions of a certain chord. Also, it is a word which evokes the pealing of bells, the bells’ complex but rich sonorous mass of overtones, the gradual unfolding of patterns implicit in the sound itself, and the idea of a sound that is simultaneously static and in flux.\n\nPärt goes further to say : Tintinnabulation is an area I sometimes wander into when I am searching for answers – in my life, my music, my work. In my dark hours, I have the certain feeling that everything outside this one thing has no meaning. The complex and many-faceted only confuses me, and I must search for unity.\n\nThe emotions evoked in this work come from the introspective dimension and the call that emerges from it. The performer must have faith to let the music speak for himself.\n\nOne of the most hypnotic performances I have heard comes from the sublime Sergei Babayan. He has often been dubbed “the magician of the piano sound”, not only because of his incomparable touch, consummate phrasing or breathtaking virtuosity. Rather, it is his carefully wrought and highly sensitive interpretations of any and all music from Rameau to Pärt.\n\nThe meditative focus and rare stillness of his artistry prompted the Hamburger Abendblatt to liken him to “one of those Japanese calligraphers who contemplate the white page before them in silence until, at the exact right moment, their brush makes its instinctive, perfect sweep across the paper”. Babayan himself has observed that making music should be open to surprises and spontaneous insights, allowing unexpected emotions to emerge and subtle shadings to evolve naturally.\n\nIn this interpretation of Für Alina, he seems to recreate in music that he expresses in words.\n\nLittle musical gems #97\n\nOne of the aspects I have enjoyed about writing these musical vignettes has been to discover artists I would otherwise never have thought to explore.\n\nToday’s “Little Musical Gem” is a good example of this.\n\nHazel Scott was a pioneering jazz pianist. She even hosted her own tv show, but when she stood up against racial segregation and stereotyping, the industry blacklisted her – and her name was all but erased from the history books.\n\nThroughout the mid-20th century, Hazel Scott was the toast of the New York jazz and popular music scene. She was a phenomenally gifted pianist and improviser, known for ‘jazzing up’ classic works by Bach and Mozart and had the most high-profile fans you could wish for, from Frank Sinatra to Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday.\n\nHazel was beguiling to watch onstage. One of the great images of her legacy today is the ‘double piano’ trick – Scott would sit on a single stool with a piano either side and play both instruments simultaneously\n\nBy 1945 she was one of the most well paid musicians of the time, fame followed her, but importantly, she also used her incredible influence to help make the arts a richer, more inclusive place. So what happened for her to disappear into almost oblivion ?\n\nWhile on the set of The Heat’s On (1943), Hazel noticed that for a scene in which wives were waving their husbands off to war, the black actresses had been dressed in grubby aprons. Hazel kicked up a fuss, left the film and wouldn’t come back until the costumes were changed. After three days, the director gave in, and Hazel returned. The aprons were replaced by floral dresses.\n\nBut Hazel’s strike had cost the studio and by 1945, the whole industry knew about it. Hollywood pulled the plug on any new offers and even her concert dates suddenly became very limited.\n\nIn Europe her music was starting to make a reappearance and in 1957, she left New York to settle in Paris. She recorded new albums and had a second wave of success. She appeared in French film ‘Le désordre et la nuit’ (1958).\n\nHowever her popularity never matched the one she has tasted in New York in 1967, Hazel decided to return home and settle. By this time however, the Civil Rights Movement had led to new legislation ending racial segregation and protecting black citizens. Scott went back to playing in New York nightclub, but by then, rock n’ roll was the new jazz and jazz artists in the US were struggling.\n\nThe erasure of Hazel Scott’s name from the jazz catalogue is tragic but fortunately for us, there are still a few videos available in which she treats us with her musical interpretations.\n\nLittle musical gems #96\n\nOn watching this video, you will I am sure, immediately recognise the melody. For many it is a tune associated with Christmas. It has been used in films, advertisements and even as a track arranged by the group Pink Martini - but it is in fact originally an Ukrainian folksong.\n\nWritten by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovich and titled “Shchedryk,” the haunting four-note melody was a song written as a winter well-wishing song. The song tells the tale of a swallow flying into a household to proclaim the plentiful year that the family will have. The song’s title is derived from the Ukrainian word “shchedryj,” which means “bountiful.”\n\nThe full composition was first performed in Ukraine on the eve of January 13th 1916. Although this date is 12 days after New Year’s Day on the Gregorian calendar, Shchedryk's premiere was not a belated New Year’s celebration because whilst the Gregorian calendar is the most used calendar internationally, Orthodox Churches in Ukraine continue to use to Julian calendar. According to the Julian calendar, January 13th was considered New Year's Eve in the year 1916.\n\nThe swallow is a herald of spring coming, referring perhaps to its pre-Christian origins. The original lyrics describe the swallow calling out to the master of the home and telling him about all the wealth that he will possess, healthy livestock, money and a beautiful wife.\n\nSung in the original language, it brings even more shivers down your spine and as we watch in desperate helplessness of the current events in Ukraine, let us listen and spare a thought for the victims of this war.\n\nLittle musical gems #95\n\nFEBRUARY 2022\n\nI had already intended to write about Barbara Hannigan for this week’s “Little Musical Gem” when I stumbled accross today’s Sunday Times article with the title \"Is there anything Barbara Hannigan can't do ?\"\n\nHannigan is totally “the real deal”, someone who is truly deserving of all her accolades. She has the ability to combine a gorgeous voice, musicality, intellect, mixed in with unbridled fearlessness.\n\nWho else could pull off a performance of Ligeti's \"Mysteries of Macabre\" in the way that she does but her ? Sir Simon Rattle is, incidentally, an excellent wing man in this performance but it is Hannigan who steals the show.\n\nHannigan's repertoire is extensive and varied, ranging from the celebrated works of Mozart to 20th century Stravinsky, and when it comes to tackling new repertoire, she is second to none. She has premiered over 80 works, many of them written specifically for her.\n\nBut her talents do not stop there. Recently, Hannigan has started to perform in concert as both soprano and conductor and and to top it all off, she is devoted to mentoring young artists through her acclaimed work with Equilibrium Young Artists, a programme conceived to help musicians at the cusp of their own careers. Hannigan is ready, not just to inspire but to share her experience and her approach with other musicians. RESPECT !\n\nEnjoy the magic of Barbara Hannigan.\n\nLittle musical gems #94\n\nFEBRUARY 2022\n\nWhen all thoughts turn to love, and lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts, it must be Valentine’s Day. That very special day for lovers falls annually on February 14, because it is named after a Christian martyr by that name. I guess, there are actually a number of Christian martyrs named Valentine, and they all have their own sad stories. But the one I like involves the Saint sitting in prison and restoring the sight of the blind daughter of his jailer. Just before his execution, he supposedly wrote her a letter signed “Your Valentine.”\n\nShakespeare said \"If music be the food of love...play on !\" so how could we imagine a Valentine’s Day without the soundtrack to accompany the romance ?\n\nSchumann most certainly had a gift for pouring his feelings into his music, and his Romance in F-sharp is perhaps one of my preferred but which is the soundtrack to your heart ?\n\nLittle musical gems #93\n\nJANUARY 2022\n\nPrepare yourself for some Baroque grooves this week but beware, this tune will whirl in your mind for hours !\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau made his reputation as a harpsichordist and theorist, and then at age 50 he did something that sent his career (and life) in an entirely new direction - he wrote an opera.\n\nHyppolyte et Aracia may have been a commercial failure, but at this point Rameau had been bitten by the bug. Over the rest of his life he wrote 20 more operas, in the process becoming France’s leading opera composer.\n\nIf Rameau’s first opera was a failure, his second was a striking success. “Les Indes galantes”, produced in Paris on August 23, 1735, was an opéra-ballet, a form that combined singing and dancing. That title has been variously translated as “The Amorous Indies” or “The Courtly Indies,” and in its final form Les Indes galantes consisted of a Prologue and four entrées (essentially they are like acts), each of which has an individual name, is set in an exotic foreign location and tells a different love story.\n\nFeaturing Rameau’s powerful music, spectacular settings and lavish sets, Les Indes galantes proved a great success: it was given 64 times in Paris in the two years after its premiere.\n\nThe opera is rarely staged today, but many have felt that Rameau’s music is too good to lose. French composer Paul Dukas was the first (1925) to draw a suite of orchestral excerpts from Les Indes galantes, and since then conductors have felt free to assemble their suites of excerpts.\n\nLittle musical gems #92\n\nJANUARY 2022\n\nWhen a story is as heartwarming as this, how could I resist sharing it with you this week ?\n\nRuth Slenczynska has just celebrated her 97th birthday and signed a new record deal nearly 60 years since her first deal with Decca. The album entitled « My Life in Music » applauds her remarkable life and performing career which began as a child prodigy in the 1920s and continues nine decades later.\n\nRuth Slenczynska was Rachmaninoff’s last pupil and the album contains pieces by her fellow student and friend Samuel Barber, Chopin (whose music she played at the memorial service for another friend, Vladimir Horowitz, and which has run like a thread throughout her career), Debussy, Grieg and Bach.\n\nFor me, Slenczynska has a most human quality when she plays. That rare gift of being able to astonish you with a virtuoso technique and move you with the beauty of her phrasing.\n\nSlenczynska was friends with Shura Cherkassky and Jorge Bolet and her pianism is one of the last living links to that golden era.\n\nBorn in 1925 in Sacramento to Polish parents, Slenczynska made her debut aged four, appeared on television for the first time the next year and, at six, gave her European debut in Berlin. As a child, she was taught by some of the century's piano legends including, E. Petri, Alfred Cortot and Josef Hoffman. Still an active performer, Slenczynska played at the 2021 Chopin International Festival in New York.\n\nWatch and listen to this video in which she talks about Rachmaninoff and interprets his works.\n\nLittle musical gems #91\n\nJANUARY 2022\n\nA New Year and a new « little musical gem ». Many of you have kindly expressed how much you enjoy reading these musical anecdotes so I shall continue posting fortnightly starting with this evening, music marking Epiphany.\n\nAs with many festivals in France the French mark the feast of the Epiphany with nourishment. Whereas Christmas Eve is all about oysters and foie gras, January 6th is all about the Galette des Rois (King’s Cake).\n\nBut the pleasure brought by a galette des roisisn’t merely due to its delicious taste – it’s also the anticipation of wondering whether you will be the lucky one to discover la fève, a tiny charm, buried inside one of the slices. If you are, you’re “king for a day” and take your place in a 700-year old French tradition.\n\nThe history of the Galette des Rois dates back to the 14th-century. Traditionally, it’s served on January 6th – the 12th day of Christmas – to celebrate the Epiphany, a religious feast day commemorating the arrival of the Three Kings to the manger where Jesus was born. Today, it’s eaten throughout the month of January and is simply a festive way to celebrate the new year with family and friends, regardless of religious background.\n\nGustav Holst’s unaccompanied Nunc dimittis, was written in 1915 and remained in manuscript form until 1979 when a published edition appeared, revised by the composer’s daughter, Imogen Holst. For soprano and tenor soloists and unaccompanied eight-part choir, the piece was written for Richard Terry, then organist of Westminster Cathedral. It was first performed liturgically on Easter Sunday, 1915, after which it was totally forgotten. The first performance of the revised version was given by the BBC Singers under Stephen Wilkinson on 11 June 1974 in Framlington Church.\n\nHolst was passionate about the music of Byrd and Palestrina, which is clearly shown here in the modal writing, and the way the male and female voices of the choir answer each other antiphonally as, for example, at the words ‘Lumen ad revelationem gentium’.\n\nThe words of this liturgical piece are in Latin rather than the well-known Thomas Cranmer translation from The Book of Common Prayer. This reflects it use for the late-night service Compline in the Roman Catholic Book of Hours.\n\nLittle musical gems #90\n\nDECEMBER 2021\n\nIn my last “Little Musical Gem” before a break for the festive season, let us listen to this rather unknown composition by Arnold Schoenberg appropriately entitled « Weihnachtsmusik »\n\nThose who usually cover their ears at the mention of this composer’s dissonant modernist scores have nothing to fear from this beautiful arrangement of a classic carol by Praetorius. He even weaves Silent Night in as a countermelody at one point.\n\nSchoenberg takes a break from stark serialism for the more convivial pleasures of Christmas. It was a long-standing tradition, it seems, in the composer’s household for the family to make music together, particularly during the Christmas period. In 1921, the year when he was well on the way to formulating his system of composition with 12 notes, the great man decided to take time off from these rigours by composing a work with a specifically festive theme. The result was the enchanting « Weihnachtsmusik » for two violins, cello, harmonium and piano.\n\nIn stark contrast to the tortured chromaticism of the « Fünf Stücke für Klavier », which he was writing during this period, Weihnachtsmusik is conceived in the key of C major. It is essentially a somewhat idiosyncratic fantasia on Christmas carols which opens with a beautiful harmonisation of the Praetorius carol « Es ist ein’ Ros’ entsprungen » and the aforementioned Silent Night.\n\nIndeed, the way in which he manages to combine these two melodies later on in the work in contrapuntal dialogue is ingenious and deeply affecting.\n\nLittle musical gems #89\n\nDECEMBER 2021\n\nThe tune of “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel” was derived from a 15th-century French processional chant for burials. The text for the song originated in the eighth century O Antiphons. The most popular version of this hymn came from the Hymns Ancient and Modern in 1861.\n\nThe modern text is appropriate for the Advent season, discussing the coming of Christ while recognizing the longing that is present in the season (juxtaposed with “Joy to the World” or “Hark the Herald Angels Sing”)–congruous with the minor key of the song.\n\nFor those looking for hidden meaning in the text, the second word of each verse of the Latin O Antiphons, when read backwards reads “ero cras” – which means “Tomorrow, I will be there.”\n\nLittle musical gems #88\n\nNOVEMBER 2021\n\nThe celebration of music’s patron saint, St. Cecilia, has provided an occasion for composers from Purcell to Britten to celebrate their art. Ever since the Restoration, the English have taken the lead in celebrating November 22, the feast day of the ‘”harmonious Saint,” and Henry Purcell’s Te Deum and Jubilate, was his third ode written for that occasion.\n\nIt was to become the most popular of Purcell’s works in the 18th century, as Tudway attests :\n\nThere is in this Te Deum such a glorious representation, of ye Heavenly Choirs, of cherubins, & Seraphins, falling down before ye Throne & singing Holy, Holy, Holy &c As hath not be Equall’d by any Foreigner, or Other… This most beautifull, & sublime representation, I dare challenge, all ye Orators, Poets, Painters &c of any Age whatsoever, to form so lively an Idea, of choirs of Angels singing, & paying their Adorations.\n\nWhether or not Purcell had written this work in anticipation of the opening of Wren’s new St. Paul’s Cathedral, as Tudway claims, its festive opulence was to be heard there many times after its consecration in 1710. Purcell, however, never was to hear it there, as he died on St. Cecilia’s Eve, 21 November 1695. The signed and dated manuscript for this masterpiece now resides in the rare book collection of the Stanford Library.\n\nLittle musical gems #87\n\nNOVEMBER 2021\n\nToday I return to a great favourite with the Goldberg Variations, but not in a version you might expect, because when we transfer this composition to brass instruments, the sound changes entirely and become more like a Gabrieli work for San Marco !\n\nWritten, as related by Bach’s biographer Johann Forkel, for the ill and often sleepless Count Kaiserling, who wished for some night music that was both smooth and lively enough to engage his attention during his insomniac periods, Bach produced his variation set for the Count and it was published in 1741.\n\nBoth Bach’s composition and Glenn Gould’s famous 1955 recording still makes a great impression. Before Gould recorded it at the age of 22, it was less prolific in the repertoire and Bach was by many viewed as a bit old-fashioned. The young Canadian turned all this around. He managed to portray Bach in a reformed way, producing fine nuances in phrasing and making the many layers in Bach’s music more transparent than anyone before him. Thus plunging both himself and Bach (back) onto the international music scene.\n\nWith this version for brass, the challenge to both performers and arrangers is to render Bach’s keyboard-specific textures with results that are technically plausible and musically convincing.\n\nThe slower variations acquire an attractive ceremonial dimension in this medium, benefiting from a brass player’s ability to change dynamics on a single note (which you cannot naturally achieve on piano or harpsichord). The double keyboard cross-handed variations are deployed to splendid antiphonal effect although the neccesarily slower tempos weaken Bach’s original bravura intentions. The Canadian Brass achieve a blend that’s akin to the dark smoothness of aged Scotch whisky, purring out rounded legato lines in which no breath seems to transpire.\n\nLittle musical gems #86\n\nNOVEMBER 2021\n\nJosef Haydn is perceived at times as a paradoxical figure ; a truly innovative composer who maintained what might have been seen as an archaic notion of loyalty and service, remaining in the employ of four different Prince Esterhazys for 48 years ! Yet it was the life that Haydn carefully chose and one which offered him a great many advantages. Nor should it obscure his towering genius.\n\nIt was Haydn who developed the modern symphony from the genial but unsubstantial three-movement style galant. It was Haydn who invented the string quartet. When the impresario Johann Peter Salomon attempted to recruit both Haydn and Mozart to London in 1790, it was the sixty-year old Haydn who accepted the offer and went on to compose some of his greatest works during his six years in London. It was the seventy-year old Haydn who revived an art form dormant since the days of Handel, the oratorio, and created one of the most stunningly original works in The Creation. And it was Haydn more than anyone else who developed the concert mass as a musical form.\n\nIn 1796, when Haydn was composing this first of his six late masses, Europe was in turmoil. Napoleon's army was winning one battle after another in Italy and now threatened the entire continent. In August, the government in Vienna ordered its troops to be mobilized and prepared for war.\n\nWhile Haydn seldom expressed political views, his title for this mass, « Missa in tempore belli » (Mass in Time of War), as well as its music reflect a sense of foreboding as Austria and its allies were about to face Napoleon.\n\nThe famous timpani solo near the beginning of the Agnus Dei creates a tone of apprehension, \"as if one heard the enemy approaching in the distance,\" as one of Haydn's associates remarked. This passage, which was imitated by Beethoven in the Agnus Dei of his Missa Solemnis, gives the Mass in Time of War its popular nickname, the Paukenmesse, or Timpani Mass. The timpani solo is followed by terrifying trumpet fanfares, and military music then leads into an unusually forceful and urgent setting of \"dona nobis pacem\" (\"grant us peace\").\n\nThis recording is from a performance given by Leonard Bernstein on January 19 1973, on the eve of the second term inauguration of President Richard Nixon. Entitled “Concert for Peace” a performance of Haydn’s \"Mass in Time of War\" was held at the identical hour in which the inaugural concert was being played at the The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nLittle musical gems #85\n\nNOVEMBER 2021\n\nPeter Ilyitch Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades is a perfect example of great literature that's further enlightened when set to first class music.\n\nThe opera is based on a groundbreaking story by Alexander Pushkin. In it, he wrote that \"two obsessions can no more exist in the same mind than two bodies can exist in the same space.\" Any doubt that unfolds from this statement, or think that it’s just best to read the story — then have a listen to Tchaikovsky's bleak, operatic version of the tale, and then think again.\n\nPushkin's unfortunate hero is Hermann, who seems to have a dysfunctional soul. He observes the social lives of his friends, but stays to himself and won't participate. When a beautiful woman (Liza) offers him love and companionship, he brutally exploits her for personal gain. Pushkin's Hermann was certainly not created to draw laughs and yet his ultimate fate seems like a natural byproduct of his flawed personality.\n\nTchaikovsky's take on this story is every bit as grim as the original — and maybe grimmer, thanks to an extra layer of sentiment. Tchaikovsky also fills Pushkin's protagonists with fire and tension, as they struggle against, and are consumed by, Fate, the same menacing theme that overshadows the Pathétique Symphony, but this time in the notes.\n\nLiza burns with desire for Herman, but the latter is gradually devoured by his passion for gambling, obsessed with a magic formula that will bring him fortune. In this race against the clock, where the music swells with rage as the hero's pathology deepens, Tchaikovsky introduces the audience to the court of Catherine the Great. While elegantly depicting Russian aristocracy, he devotes his finest skills to the terrible figure of the Countess, the infamous Queen of Spades. But that love gets tangled up with obsessive greed and, in a way, the opera becomes even more tragic than Pushkin's story.\n\nLittle musical gems #84\n\nOCTOBER 2021\n\nThe most memorable performance I attended of Haitink was at a BBC Prom in 2009. Haitink had just led the London Symphony Orchestra through the first three movements of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony and then the music melted in the generosity of the embrace that followed. “He held 5,000 people mesmerised” were the words of one critic.\n\nThe key of D flat is often warm and poetic. I can still feel the ambiance Haitink drew that evening from the orchestra’s strings near the start of Mahler’s concluding Adagio. The resolve and serenity Haitink found in that movement sang with empathy and it seemed to sing the truth.\n\nIn a career that spanned over six decades, Haitink carved his own identity. He was not the literalism of Toscanini, nor the uncanny subjectivity of Furtwängler and certainly not the eccentricities of Mengelberg ; the conductor he grew up hearing at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, where he was himself chief conductor from 1961 to 1988.\n\nWhat Haitink had was a sound. Players often spoke of an “unmistakable ability to change the sound of an orchestra with his mere presence,” an ability that even the musicians who adored him could hardly explain. The sound imbued weight and gravity that was never portentous or heavy.\n\nHis association with Mahler and Bruckner are well known but he also excelled in the French repertoire with his characteristic careful seriousness of purpose that drew clarity and beguiling transparency.\n\nIn the third movement of Debussy’s Nocturnes, Haitink paints an ethereal world of Sirènes with the orchestra faithfully executing the outer world Haitink conveys through his baton.\n\nLittle musical gems #83\n\nOCTOBER 2021\n\nThe violin concerto is one of the most extensive of the musical genres, so is not surprising, when considering the large number of compositions from which to choose, that only a few have been included in what is considered the standard violin concerto repertoire.\n\nIt is in the Romantic period, however, that the violin concerto rises above simply being a composition that features the violin to being a true showpiece for the virtuoso artist. The concertos of Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Sibelius, Mendelssohn and Bruch are among the best-known examples of the genre but there are also many works from the Romantic period that have fallen into relative obscurity.\n\nThe violin concertos of Glazunov, Vieuxtemps, and Goldmark are among the concertos which were popular in their day but have been eclipsed by their more popular counterparts. Another such work, popular in its day but now relatively unknown, is the Violin Concerto in E minor, by the Russian violinist and composer, Jules Conus.\n\nPremiered in Moscow in 1898, the Conus violin concerto was long popular in Russia and was championed by such violinists as Fritz Kreisler and Jascha Heifetz. It was performed a number of times in the early part of the twentieth century, but, like the concertos of Vieuxtemps, it has become primarily a vehicle for teaching.\n\nThis recording by Heifetz demonstrates his prowess as a violinist and the the tonal qualities of the cantabile playing are especially beguiling. He revived this concerto during his time but despite many artists listing the Conus concerto in their repertoire, it still remains rarely programmed.\n\nLittle musical gems #82\n\nOCTOBER 2021\n\nHearing Spem in Alium is an overwhelming experience : forty voices circling between heaven and earth. Tallis’ Spem in Alium is a one-off masterpiece that stands out in musical history like Beethoven’s 9th or Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring.\n\nAlthough it was by no means the only piece written for 40 parts in the high Renaissance, and was perhaps inspired by a piece for these forces presented in England by the Italian composer Striggio, it takes a totally different approach to those continental composers who wrote occasionally for massed forces.\n\nTallis gives every single line its own individual personality, and the counterpoint is driven right through the piece with astonishing complexity. The effect is one of shifting kaleidoscopic colour, a feeling not just of looking up at the stars on a clear night but of being able to get closer to them, surrounded by light and activity.\n\nThere seems most certainly to be a connection to the Dukes of Norfolk, Catholic recusants, though scholars argue over whether it is a piece written during the reign of Mary (often associated with the biblical figure of Judith, the source of the text), or whether it was an answer to the virtuosic challenge of Striggio in the 1570s. It is certainly a piece which rings out the insistent argument of Catholic Tallis, that God’s people should seek his mercy.\n\nThe idea that someone 500 years ago could have written a motet for 40 individual voices to be performed in really grand cathedrals is quite overwhelming.\n\nLittle musical gems #81\n\nOCTOBER 2021\n\nOn Easter Sunday, 1939, contralto Marian Anderson performed one of the most significant concerts in American history.\n\nAnderson was originally scheduled to perform in Washington D.C.'s Constitution Hall, but the Daughters of the American Revolution enforced segregationist policies of the day and refused to allow her to hold her concert at the location. Instead, Howard University and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for Anderson to hold the concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. This concert, which became an iconic moment in the fight for civil rights, was performed before an audience of more than 75,000 people and broadcast by radio to countless more.\n\nAnderson concluded this legendary concert with an arrangement of the spiritual, 'My Soul Is Anchored in the Lord' written for her by her friend, the composer Florence Price.\n\nAlthough this premiere brought instant recognition and fame to Florence Beatrice Price, success as a composer was not easily gained and despite breaking many barriers in the field of classical music throughout her career, Price's music was largely overlooked on the concert stage for over half a century.\n\nPrice's musical style reflects both the European classical tradition of the late Romantic era of her formal musical training, as well as the traditional and popular music of her African-American heritage. The rhythms and harmonies of popular music, blues, jazz, and folk tunes make their way into her compositions. Devoutly religious, she also made much use of the sacred musical styles of spirituals, gospel music and hymns.\n\nThe Mississippi River Suite replicates a boat cruising down the Mississippi River and experiencing life along its banks. The opening section, like Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 1, depicts the awakening of dawn, but in this case, along river banks. Section 2 introduces a Native American theme scored for Indian drum, timpani, marimba, and other percussion instruments. In section 3, four Negro spirituals Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen, Stand Still, Jordan, Go Down, Moses and Deep River and original work by Price are mixed with traditional tunes of the day, River Song, Lalotte, and Steamboat Bill. The suite concludes with a layering of the melodies, alternately stacked one upon the other, with the spiritual Deep River the most dominant of all.\n\nLittle musical gems #80\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\nI was too young at the time to realize that it was the great Tatiana Nikolayeva who was performing and speaking in front of me #entertainment and would only understand later the significance of this encounter.\n\nNikolayeva was one of the great pianists of the twentieth century. She had a wonderfully warm tone reminiscent of Shura Cherkassky, and this was coupled with a piercing intelligence and a delightful generosity of spirit.\n\nHer great love of music was transmitted in every performance she gave, and her recitals were always greeted with enthusiasm by her army of ardent admirers.\n\nOne of the greatest Bach players of her generation, an undisputed authority on the music of Shostakovich and a musician of the highest capabilities. Nikolayeva’s repeetoire ranged from Bach to Bartók but\n\nShostakovich's cycle of 24 Preludes and Fugues always held a special place in her vast repertoire. She inspired and premiered the work in Leningrad in 1952 and it was also the piece she performed when she died in concert in San Francisco in 1993.\n\nThe lifelong friendship between the composer and the performer started when the 26-year-old Nikolayeva won first prize at the 1950 Bach Piano competition organized in Leipzig for the bicentennial of the German composer's death. As a member of the jury, Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) was immensely impressed by her playing and inspired by the experience, he returned to Moscow to compose his own set of Preludes and Fugues in 1950/51.\n\nIn the preludes there is in each one a sense of experimentation, of compressing a single idea into a few pages of music to see where it will go. Each one has a “message.”\n\nWatch Nikolayeva as she performs and reminisces about Shostakovich.\n\nLittle musical gems #79\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\nIn France she was, and still is, a legend. Alongside Jacques Brel and Georges Brassens, she was one of the pillars of chanson française in the 1960s, as well as the first woman singer to perform her own material. Yet, she is barely known outside of her native country.\n\nDressed in black, she performed on the biggest stages in Paris, playing the piano and singing. Barbara possessed remarkable breath control, for her voice seemed to float on a minimum of the air required by mortal men, and her lips hardly moved.\n\nHer music and lyrics are never intellectualised: they speak directly to and from the heart, expressing feelings of desolation, but also of hope and humour. Barbara was beloved in France due to her melancholy musical style, her pathos as a suffering artist, and her unique non-conforming attitudes.\n\n« A little cantata » by Barbara is a biographical feat. In just under two minutes of song, we find almost half of the themes of Barbara's repertoire : the notion of memories, the past, loss, the pain of absence ... the song is structured on the economy of a few piano notes which proves Barbara's evocative genius.\n\nListen to this delectable interpretation with Ivry Gitlis and you will be seduced.\n\nLittle musical gems #78\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\nDespite the war, concentration camps, police harassment and physical injury, Cziffra - a battered survivor of war-torn Europe - went on to become one of the 20th century’s greatest keyboard artists, displaying fingerwork and musical insight that still attract hundreds of thousands of admirers. The range of his recorded repertoire – Couperin, Rameau, Bach, Scarlatti, Liszt, Chopin, Brahms, Schumann, Ravel, Bartòk – is impressive.\n\nVideos and remastered DVD recordings of his performances reveal a joy rarely seen. He smiles serenely and his eyes sparkle as his huge hands attack, tease and caress the keyboard. Pieces such as La Campanella, Islamay, Le Grand Galop Chromatique, and his own transcription of Flight of the Bumblebee are exhilarating in their reckless abandon. He made a virtue of being, as he put it, “far away from the rigors of intellectual and musicological correctness”.\n\nCziffra’s career won him superstar status in France, Italy and Japan. Critical opinion always remained split among the experts, with purists faulting him for interpretive flights of fancy and for his unbridled enthusiasm. “By playing the great virtuoso pieces of the Romantic repertory in my own manner,” Cziffra wrote in his memoir, “I divided the profession. I became its Antichrist due to my improvisations, which multiplied the difficulties ten times over.”\n\nIndeed, his ample use of rubato and variable tempi might not be considered as conforming to traditional tastes, but I have always maintained that “one is not taught how to play well but how to become a part of one’s instrument until the soul of the interpreter, visible to all, becomes the messenger of music”.\n\nHere is a wholly individual and breathtaking interpretation of Rameau.\n\nLittle musical gems #77\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\n« La rentrée », there is no real translation for this expression in English, other than « it’s back to school time» after the summer break.\n\nFor my rentrée, I shall resume writing these weekly musical anecdotes, starting with Jean-Michel Damase. Why him ? Because during the summer, I was invited to prepare for a recording this autumn of his piano and trumpet concerto with the BBC Concert Orchestra. Not knowing anything about this composer, I set about making my research and discovered a neglected catalogue of works and couldn’t help think how wonderful that this project of a French composer’s music is championed by British musicians.\n\nDamase started his career as one of the most promising French composers of his generation, but ended up apparently spending his career more or less at the fringes of the serious music scene. Perhaps this was due to the fact that Damase paid no heed to the avant-garde trends of the time - his music is steadfastly tonal and melodic. He stands in the tradition of Poulenc and Françaix, two composers whom he hugely admired.\n\nThe 1952 Symphonie is an early work written when Damase was 24 years old. The first movement is a captivating journey from darkness to light opening with a shadowy, ominous, chromatic theme in the woodwinds which eventually gives way to a gloriously simple, “rolling” theme in the violins, accompanied by an undulating horn figure. These “dark” and “light” episodes keep interrupting each other and a little more than halfway through the movement, it seems like darkness is going to prevail. The music builds to a grinding, dissonant climax when out of nowhere the horns burst through the texture with a glorious, major key version of the opening chromatic theme.\n\nI leave you to discover this movement in which the last few minutes reveal one of the most gloriously uplifting finales with a warm sunset glow that comes to rest on a c major chord.\n\nLittle musical gems #76\n\nJULY 2021\n\nMy last post for these little musical anecdotes before the summer break is dedicated to Julius Katchen, the pianist renowned for his assured, big pianism and his daring recordings of Brahms – but who tragically died aged 42.\n\nIn many respects, his full-bodied pianism contrasted with the more literally orientated, anti-sensual approach generally favoured by his contemporaries. At the same time, his erudition extended beyond music, from his youthful studies in philosophy and English literature to his avid and canny pursuit of fine Japanese netsuke.\n\nKatchen’s traversal of Brahms’s complete solo piano works may have been the most meaningful and fulfilling. He nearly always managed to reconcile this composer’s intellectual and structural rigour with the music’s underlying lyrical impulses and sometimes underrated pockets of humour. In Brahms, Katchen’s propensity for daring was a double-edged sword, as cogently borne out in the second Concerto in B flat. His muted restraint in the slow movement’s long chains of trills defines the untranslatable Spanish word duende. Conversely, in the finale, at the coda’s outset, listen to Katchen start the right-hand octaves at a deliberate trot, while he slyly speeds up to a devilish sprint towards the finish. It’s not what Brahms wrote, yet it works, and one could imagine the composer winking in approval.\n\nThe pianist’s vivacious and crisp Prokofiev Third from his last recording session belies any notion of terminal illness (he was to die from cancer in April 1969). As the famous music critic Distler once wrote, « The Argerich version smokes. But Katchen’s inhales ! ».\n\nKatchen made the pioneering recording of Ned Rorem’s Second Piano Sonata, which for many years was the sole interpretation available on disc. The composer admired the interpretation as well as his friend’s prodigious capacity for both work and play: ‘I remember him going on tour without his music,’ recalled Rorem. ‘But not because it was all photographed in his brain: it was photographed in his fingers.’\n\nLittle musical gems #75\n\nJULY 2021\n\nLes trois Gymnopédies, and instantly we cry out Erik Satie, but the man, like his music, remains something of a mystery. \"Mr Precursor\", as Debussy liked to call him, he led the way with his surrealistic scores and repetitive music. Ravel and Stravinsky also cited Satie as an important influence, and his currency with the leading artists and poets of his day was high.\n\nFrom 1899 to 1911, Satie lived on his earnings as a cabaret pianist at the Chat Noir, but detested the job. However, it brought him into contact with the leading figures of the Belle Epoque period : Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul Verlaine, Patrice Contamine and Guy de Maupassant. This music also left a lasting mark on Satie's musical personality.\n\nEmbryons desséchés (Desiccated embryos) is a neo-classical work but what strikes the modern listener first is actually its proto-minimalist qualities. The opening of the first movement is pure Philip Glass !\n\nThis work finds Satie engaging in a bit of musical biology, with each movement named for an obscure marine organism.\n\nThe first entitled d'Holothurie (Sea cucumber), the second d'Edriophthalma (a type of crustaceon), quotes the third movement of Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 and the last Podophthalma (another type of crustaceon) is a sort of hunting song.\n\nWith titles like these, one also gets the feeling the composer is testing the limits of his own absurd sense of humour.\n\nLittle musical gems #74\n\nJUNE 2021\n\nA visit to the Louvre today made me reflect on inspiration and transmission from the great masters. Without Haydn, where would the inspiration have stemmed from for Mozart or Beethoven ?\n\nHaydn realized the full bounty of his exploration with Op. 20, six masterpieces conceived as an integrated set immediately regarded as a towering achievement, the very first crucial landmark in the history of the string quartet. The cover of the first printed edition featured an illustration of the sun and they have been known as the \"Sun\" quartets ever since. This burst of creative effort might well be regarded as the most important in the history of the string quartet.\n\nThe set of six quartets, Op. 20, finds the composer delving deeper, intensifying the music's emotional expression and adding layers of complexity not found in his previous quartets. (Beethoven made a copy of one of the Op. 20 quartets during his student days in Vienna.) This is the moment when the string quartet leaves the traces of its lighter origins behind and becomes a full-fledged genre of serious instrumental music to rank alongside the classical symphony. As the great musicologist Donald Tovey put it, \"With Op. 20 the historical development of Haydn's quartets reaches its goal; and further progress is not progress in any historical sense, but simply the difference between one masterpiece and the next.\"\n\nThe second quartet in C major is perhaps the finest of the set, a diamond among its fellow precious jewels. Every movement, possibly offers something to admire. Throughout this quartet, the cello is finally emancipated from its humble role as a keeper of the base line to become a fully independent voice in a four-part texture.\n\nThe cello sings the first theme of the opening movement in its higher register initiating a brief three-part fugato for a sonata exposition that is uniquely and strikingly contrapuntal. As if a signature of the quartet, the cello renews its featured role at least three times more: the first solo theme in the second movement, the lead in the minuet's trio, and an equal voice in the elaborate fugal finale.\n\nLittle musical gems #73\n\nJUNE 2021\n\nEvery now and again, I stumble across artists that I have never heard of, but am absolutely enchanted to discover. This is the case with Bella Bellow, Togo’s best loved musician. Although she died in 1973 at the tender age of 27, she continues to influence the country and its musicians, even today. The Bella Bellow choir in Togo is made up of 100 young women dedicated to keeping her songs alive.\n\nBella Bellow’s voice is sublime, akin to the early Miriam Makeba. She had a rather extraordinary life. Her talent was discovered when she was at school, and at 21 she was invited to perform at the Festival of Black Arts (Festival Mondial des Arts Nègres, 1966) in Dakar - an event of great cultural significance which made her a household name across West Africa, where she went on tour.\n\nShe also performed in Brazil and Paris and was poised to become an international superstar when she was tragically killed in a car accident. The songbird of Togo and my choice ahead of « la fête de la musique » tomorrow, listen to her in this extract and discover her talent for yourselves.\n\nLittle musical gems #72\n\nJUNE 2021\n\nSergei Taneyev (1856-1915), whose music is perhaps the least known of any great Russian composer from this period. Although a brilliant pianist, he opted for a career as a composer and teacher and soon became a professor at the Conservatory. Among his many students were Gliere, Rachmaninov, Gretchaninov, Scriabin and Medtner. In Russian concert halls, one always finds a bust of Taneyev alongside those of Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms and Tchaikovsky. The fame of this outstanding composer unfortunately has not spread beyond his homeland.\n\nThe Piano Quintet in g minor was composed in 1910-11. It is a colossal chamber music work. The massive opening movement, which by itself lasts more than 20 minutes, begins with a very lengthy, pensive and slow introduction, Mesto, which while melancholic also gives off air of mystery, a feeling that something is impending. The character of main part of the movement, Allegro, is by turns vigorous, resolute and lyrical, but overall the mood remains dark. The second movement, Presto, is a march-like scherzo. The sparkling percussive nature of the rhythms is very impressive. The trio section could not present a great contrast with its slow, almost languid, lovely, lyrical melody. In the third movement, a Largo which is essentially a passacaglia with variations, Taneyev demonstrates why he was universally regarded as one of the great musical architects of all time. The main theme is a tragic tone poem which is supported by a never varying ostinato in the cello. Above it, Taneyev produces a constantly changing set of images and emotional contrasts. The huge finale, Allegro vivace, is filled with dramatic tension from its opening measures to its thrilling conclusion.\n\nSuperlatives do not do justice to this masterpiece from the Romantic Russian chamber music literature. It is an extraordinary work by any standard.\n\nPletnev and his dream-team string colleagues are passionate advocates in this recording of the piano quintet.\n\nLittle musical gems #71\n\nJUNE 2021\n\nThere has been much conjecture about the relationship between Erich and Carlos Kleiber. Erich, the famous but strict father, and Carlos who conducted from his father’s scores and only performed works that Erich Kleiber had also conducted. So what do then we know about the music making of this older, other great Kleiber ?\n\nDespite his early enthusiasm for twentieth century music, Erich Kleiber is best remembered for minutely rehearsed and finely balanced interpretations of Beethoven, Mahler, and Bruckner. Even when in Berlin, where much of the Classical and Romantic repertory was familiar to the performers, he usually called five rehearsals before a concert. A perfectionist by nature, he insisted on complete faithfulness to the score. In his words, \"[t]here are only two enemies of good performance: one is routine and the other improvisation.\"\n\nKleiber's recorded performances are confined mainly to the last 10 years of his life when under contract to Decca. His Beethoven Fifth Symphony has been called the fi"
