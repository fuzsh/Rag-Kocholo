        "text": "BMJ. 1999 Jan 9; 318(7176): 129.\n\nPMCID: PMC1114594\n\nPMID: 9880305\n\nLord Smith of Marlow · John Aitken · James (“Jimmy”) George Ledingham · Robert (“Bob”) Murray · Arthur Salmon (“Sam”) Wigfield · John Frederick Wilkinson\n\nLord Smith of Marlow\n\nFormer consultant surgeon St George’s Hospital, London (b London 1914, the only son of a general practitioner and coroner in south London; q St Thomas’s 1937; MS, FRCS; KBE), d 1 July 1998. Rodney Smith had a remarkable career as a surgeon, teacher, and administrator. After a distinguished time as a student at St Thomas’s, where he also excelled at cricket (playing for the Surrey County 2nd XI), he embarked on a surgical career, training partly under the formidable and eccentric Philip Mitchener. Appointed surgical registrar at the Middlesex Hospital he was greatly influenced by (Lord) Webb-Johnson and (Sir Gordon) Gordon-Taylor. From 1941 to 1945 he served as a surgical specialist in the Royal Army Medical Corps, working in field units in Palestine, Egypt, and north Africa and being wounded at Anzio. In 1946 he was appointed to the staff at St George’s, at a time when, like several other London teaching hospitals, that hospital did not usually fill its posts with outsiders.\n\nHe built an international reputation: At St George’s he built up an international reputation in abdominal, particularly hepatobiliary and pancreatic, surgery. His skill in dealing with difficult cases of pancreatic cancer, postoperative biliary fistulae, retained calculi, bile duct strictures, and so on became legendary, and he devised mucosal hepatico-jejunostomy for hilar biliary strictures. He was that surgical precious rarity: a surgeon who could make a difficult operation look easy. To watch him dissect with apparent effortlessness an abdomen that had been subjected to several laparotomies was a sight that no surgeon could forget. His lectures and writings were models of clarity, and with Charles Rob he edited the multivolume Operative Surgery, which soon became a standard reference.\n\nRodney Smith devoted much of his energy to the Royal College of Surgeons, serving as Penrose May Tutor and dean of the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, and being elected a councillor in 1965. On the sudden death of Sir Edward Muir in post he became president of the college, and subsequently was granted a special three years and nine months rather than the usual three years in office, and there were even proposals that (unconstitutionally) he should stand for a further term. Here his abilities as a wise and skilled administrator became fully apparent. It was a time of heated arguments between the profession and the secretary of state, Barbara Castle, about private hospital beds and supportive strikes by hospital domestic staff.\n\nControversy over brain death diagnosis: Rodney Smith was also a skilled bridge player, with Harold (now Lord) Lever as a partner, and through him he was able to negotiate about the crisis behind the scenes with members of the government, and particularly the conciliator Lord Goodman. His skills were also shown as chairman of the medical royal colleges. Provoked by a BBC Panorama programme alleging that not all organ donors were dead, a serious shortage of cadaveric organs had arisen and the number of transplant operations had fallen. Smith’s committee was able to allay public disquiet by issuing criteria for the diagnosis of brain death, and ensuring that these were given equal publicity to the untrue claims.\n\nA year after the end of his presidency of the Royal College of Surgeons Smith was appointed a life peer and became president of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1978-80, where he helped solve an internal crisis. In 1981 he was appointed president of the BMA, but was unable to take up this post because of a devastating stroke. Left aphasic, with the help of his second wife, Susan, and the Stroke Association (whose president he subsequently became) he made a remarkable recovery—enough both to resume operating and to speak in the House of Lords. Rodney Smith was also a musician, who had seriously considered a career as a professional violinist in his youth, and in later years he took up painting. He leaves a wife and three sons and a daughter by his first marriage.\n\nJohn Aitken\n\nFormer consultant paediatric surgeon Glasgow (b 1912; q Glasgow 1935; FRCS, ChM (commendation)), d 26 September 1998. He held junior posts in Glasgow and London and in 1939 volunteered for the Indian Medical Service and worked on hospital ships in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, in Lebanon, and across north Africa and Sicily. After bouts of dysentery he was invalided out and appointed assistant surgeon at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. In the 1950s he suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and underwent a lobectomy. His illness and the hierarchical system of hospital practice constrained his creative and artistic skills, but these emerged through his interest in reconstructive surgery, in particular the correction of cleft lip and palate and treatment of burns. He was innovative in using the small bowel to reconstruct the alimentary tract in infants with oesophageal atresia. He leaves a wife, Bill; two daughters; four grandchildren; and a great grandson.\n\nby D G Young and J Carnduff\n\nJames (“Jimmy”) George Ledingham\n\nFormer general practitioner Edinburgh (b 1929; q Aberdeen 1953), d 3 May 1998. Within a few years of setting up in practice Jimmy had a full list. Between 1972 and 1992 he was a hospital practitioner at the Eastern General Hospital working in the care of the elderly unit. Always interested in sports medicine he was the doctor to the Scottish and British athletic teams for several years and a doctor to the Hibernian Football Club until his death. Jimmy had a knack of diagnosing rare diseases and serious conditions at an early stage. A visitor to Edinburgh who went to the surgery to collect a repeat prescription for his wife was instructed to strip to the waist because Jimmy had noticed a prominent neck pulsation that he correctly thought indicated severe, although asymptomatic, aortic incompetence. Jimmy was also adept at dealing with emergencies. When a patient ran amok with an axe, chopping up the furniture, her daughter called Jimmy, who resolved the crisis by saying, “Hello Mrs X. Do you know why your daughter called me out? It seems that it is a joiner that you will be needing not a doctor.” Jimmy gave all his patients what seemed to them special attention. His support to the bereaved and the terminally ill was exceptional. About a week before a patient with a pancreatic malignancy died Jimmy took him fishing though it required two people to lift the patient into the boat.\n\nWith a sense of humour that was often outrageous but never misplaced, Jimmy once had a repressed medical student attached to his practice. A consultant’s wife brought in her daughter. Jimmy turned to the student and said, “This girl is a victim of her family background. Her father is a vagrant and an alcoholic; her mother is a sex maniac.” “No, no, Jimmy,” replied the mother, “I’m the alcoholic.” Intolerant of insincerity and pomposity, Jimmy was a free agent. Students would be amazed by him berating a consultant for some aspect of the care of one of his patients. His aim was better care, particularly in communicating with patients, their relatives, and other doctors. Spurning personal glory, he achieved much, particularly in breaking down the barriers between primary and secondary care. This is not to say that he was not competitive, especially when it came to fishing and gardening. When a colleague boasted about his vegetables, Jimmy left a decoy pigeon in his brassicas. He leaves a wife, Barrie; his mother; three sons and a daughter; and six grandchildren.\n\nby John Munro\n\nRobert (“Bob”) Murray\n\nConsultant occupational physician (b 1916; q Glasgow 1939; DSc, FRCP; OBE), died from bronchial carcinoma on 27 October 1998. Bob entered university at the age of 16 and gained a BSc before studying medicine. Soon after qualification he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, and served in Nigeria, where he learnt Hausa and discovered a linguistic talent. On detachment to the Chindits in Burma he was mentioned in dispatches. After demobilisation he joined the Medical Inspectorate of Factories in Manchester. He taught, researched into the effects of work with asbestos, aromatic amines, isocyanates, and trained as a medical inspector. In 1956 he moved to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva, where his influence on international standards of occupational health relied more on his skill in persuading people to implement the spirit of the law rather than in drafting detailed legislation. He rapidly became fluent in French, and his memory for faces and names gained him innumerable friends. At the ILO Bob found that although employers and government representatives had access to medical experts the trade union representatives did not. When he returned to Britain he joined the Trades Union Congress as its medical adviser, a post he held for 13 years. He established a reputation for fearless criticism of employers who hazarded the health of their workers. He helped to establish the TUC Centenary Institute of Occupational Health at London University. Bob played a major part in the International Commission of Occupational Health, as part time secretary general and president, both for six years. After he retired he continued as an expert witness in courts and around the world. He was visiting professor at the University of Bradford and honorary professor at Kitakyushu, Japan. I and many others will remember Bob as a great travelling companion, an indifferent golfer, and a wonderful raconteur. His absorbing hobby was industrial archaeology and he was fascinated to discover the last flint knapper in England. Predeceased by his wife, Noreen, he leaves a daughter (a general practitioner) and three grandchildren.\n\nby W M Dixon\n\nArthur Salmon (“Sam”) Wigfield\n\nConsultant physician and venereologist Newcastle upon Tyne 1969-77 (b Skelton 1912; q Cambridge/UCH 1936; MD), d 16 May 1998. He was the youngest of four brothers who all entered the medical profession. As a house physician he developed an interest in the neurological manifestations of syphilis and worked in the venereal diseases department of University College Hospital and with the Emergency Medical Service blood transfusion unit. During the war he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in India, becoming major and officer commanding the British Military Hospital at Juppalpore. From 1950 to 1969 he was consultant venereologist in Birmingham before moving to the north east. Sam lectured, published widely, and edited several journals related to his specialty. He championed the cause for improved sex education and the understanding of human sexuality. He was not averse to using the media and entered debates with the clergy and government ministers, but it was not until a decade after his retirement that the arrival of AIDS emphasised his beliefs in sex education. He came out of retirement as a part time assistant physician to the University of East Anglia and the University of Aston in Birmingham. Sam’s favourite pastimes were painting and sketching, playing bridge, talking cricket, and listening to Beethoven. He leaves a wife, Daphne; a daughter and three sons; and seven grandchildren.\n\nby Crispin Wigfield\n\nJohn Frederick Wilkinson\n\nDirector department of haematology Manchester Royal Infirmary, 1947-62 (b 1897; q Manchester 1928; MD (gold medal), FRCP), d 13 August 1998. Dr Wilkinson was one of the founders of haematology as a clinical specialty in Britain. Initially trained as a chemist, his undergraduate studies were interrupted by the first world war. He was balloted (unsuccessfully) for the Victoria Cross after a daring raid on the German submarine bases at Zeebrugge and Ostend in 1918. Within a year of graduation he was a lecturer in medicine at the University of Manchester and director of the new department of clinical investigation at Manchester Royal Infirmary. He held honorary posts at the Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute. He carried out much early research into pernicious anaemia and malignant blood diseases and was a pioneer of the use of nitrogen mustards in treating lymphomas and chronic leukaemia. He wrote many original papers, was cofounder of the British Society of Haematology, a president of the European Haematology Society, and a life councillor of the International Haematology Society. He had a large private practice. On working days his Rolls-Royce would be parked outside his consulting wing adjacent to the private wing of the Royal Infirmary so that he had easy access to his hospital department, NHS wards, and private patients. He retired from the NHS in 1962, but patients were still being referred to him in his 90s. Outside medicine his interests were scouting, animals (he was a director and vice chairman of Chester Zoo), and old pharmacy jars, which are now housed in a special gallery in the Thackray Medical Museum in Leeds. Latterly he had walking difficulties but he enjoyed his 100th birthday celebrations. He was separated from his wife, Marion.\n\nA musical celebration of the life of Dr Donald Bruce Scott, who died on 2 November 1998, will be held in the Queen’s Hall, South Clerk Street, Edinburgh, at 8 00 pm on Friday 15 January.\n\nby C D R Pengelly and C G Geary"
