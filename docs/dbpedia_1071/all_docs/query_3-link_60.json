        "text": "Noted author Elizabeth Kostova will be on campus Sept. 9 and 10 as part of the Cooper Living Arts Series.\n\nThe first of her three novels, The Historian, holds the distinction as the first debut novel in U.S. publishing history to open at No. 1 on the New York Times Bestseller List, has been translated into 40 languages, and won Quill and Independent Bookseller Awards.\n\nHearing is believing when it comes to the vocal range of Harrison Bieschke ’26.\n\nThe Greenie was chosen through selective audition from other students across his home state to take part in last month’s Tennessee Governor’s School for the Arts at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nLose your inhibitions and feel the magic of sound and rhythm.\n\nNo boy who lets their singing voice be heard or takes up an instrument at Christ School needs to be self-conscious. Artistic growth and expression are gleefully encouraged in a music program made up of students from every musical background and grade level.\n\nMonday night’s Spring Applied Recital in St. Joseph’s Chapel kicked off Arts Week at the school and showcased the musicianship of 27 Greenies, either solo or as a duet. The majority of the pieces were classical or traditional.\n\nCongratulations to our Greenie artists for having 14 pieces of their work be part of this year’s Western North Carolina Regional Scholastic Art Awards.\n\nJudging was open to every student in grades 7 through 12 across the region.\n\nPosters line the walls of Pingree Theater, one for every play that Mary Dillon has directed since 2001. Her 40th is a timely holiday gift to the Christ School community the weekend before Christmas Break.\n\n“ALL IS CALM – The Christmas Truce of 1914” will be presented Friday and Saturday in Pingree at 7:30 each night. Admission is free.\n\nFriday is a big day for one Christ School alumnus as it is the opening of the “Kindred Worlds: The Priscila and Alvin Hudgins Collection” art exhibition at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, N.Y.\n\nAlvin graduated in 2005 and was a key contributor to the first Greenies state championship in basketball his senior year. He was also a Senior Leader in Noland House and sang in the Choir.\n\nNo local art gallery could offer boys from Christ School the same level of exposure.\n\nAsheville Regional Airport is the third busiest airport in North Carolina, having served a record 1,838,793 passengers in 2022, a 29 percent increase over the previous year.\n\nChrist School art students will never look at an empty plastic container the same way again.\n\nTryon, N.C., sculptor David Edgar was on campus Friday, leading a hands-on demonstration in the Kennedy-Herterich Art Studio at the invitation of his friend, Greenie alumnus Stan Gibson ’58.\n\nArtistic expression will always be encouraged and nurtured at Christ School, whatever form it takes.\n\nFrom poets to painters, illustrators to sculptors, no exhibit or show could possibly show off the collective talent of the school community better than the Struan magazine. More than 50 pieces from students and faculty are in this year’s journal of art and writing, which was published shortly before the boys left for Summer Break.\n\nFine Arts instructor Erin Price begins every school year with a blank canvas, meaning there is an innate joy in seeing each new group of students push their boundaries.\n\nThe quality of work and variety of mediums offered by Christ School is reflected again in this year’s Western North Carolina Regional Scholastic Art Awards.\n\nArt is subjective, but judges with the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers have specific criteria in mind when it comes to the annual Scholastic Art & Writing Awards.\n\nExcellence in originality, technical skill, and emergence of a personal voice or vision were all used to pick this year's national winners out of nearly 230,000 submissions. Only 1 percent of pieces were deemed worthy of a National Medal Award, with a Christ School senior's painting included in that exclusive group.\n\nAsheville and the surrounding areas have long been known as an artistic mecca. Christ School students are doing their part to maintain this reputation with their painting, photography, and mixed media work.\n\nSix Greenies have been recognized in this year’s Western North Carolina Regional Scholastic Art Awards.\n\nFine Arts students at Christ School might not know Ian Wilkinson personally, but they probably know his work.\n\nThe Asheville muralist has been involved in projects all over town – from an iconic water tower in the River Arts District to a re-creation of Catawba Falls splashed across some downtown stairs. And perhaps the piece most recognizable to Greenies? A scene painted on the side of the 12 Bones Smokehouse South restaurant.\n\nOnly about 7 percent of the pieces submitted for the Western North Carolina Regional Scholastic Art Awards were considered worthy of Silver Key recognition.\n\nChrist School students William David ’21 and Ethan Park ’23 have made the cut for a February 9 awards ceremony at the downtown Asheville Art Museum.\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption 2\" was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon when it was released in October 2018. The western-themed video game generated $725 million in worldwide sales the first three days it was out. As of May, more than 24 million copies have been shipped, and along with commercial success, critics have showered the game with praise for its story, characters such as gun-toting outlaws Arthur Morgan and John Marston, its open world, and detail. Look closely in the credits for \"Red Dead Redemption 2\" and you will find a Greenie. Christ School alumnus Judson Eley '06 has been an Environment Artist for Rockstar Games for the past five years.\n\nOftentimes, the most memorable submissions for Christ School's arts and literary magazine come from unlikely sources. Such is the case again this year. The Struan, a 64-page annual collection of works from Greenie students and faculty, was published last week."
