        "text": "Southern Gospel Music has no greater ambassador than The Kingdom Heirs. They have introduced thousands to their music through their daily shows at Dollywood for the past 36 years. The group has been excellent over those years, with minimal personnel changes.\n\nThe current nucleus of Lead singer Arthur Rice, Bass vocalist Jeff Chapman, and Loren Harris on Baritone added Tenor Vocalist Jacob Ellison last Year and I believe this is their best lineup to date.\n\nThe project kicks off with the title cut, which is the first single. The group takes the first verse and chorus and are joined by The 3 Heath Brothers on the second verse and chorus. The song gets up and goes, with some nice horns on the arrangement. Next is up is a nice mid tempo number, “The Gospel Truth“, which features Chapman on the verses and Ellison and Chapman on the chorus. Ellison is a newcomer to SG, and I love his tones on this song, very similar to Kirk Talley in certain tones, especially the last key change after the bridge.\n\nThe pace picks up on “He’s Making Good”, which features Rice. It’s hard to believe that Arthur has been the lead singer of the KH for 27 Years! But believe me when I say he sounds better than ever, and he absolutely crushes this song. Things slow down a bit for “A Heaven Frame of Mind”, which features Harris. I really enjoyed this bluesy song, penned by the late great Dianne Wilkinson, and the first of 4 songs she penned that you’ll find on the project.\n\nNext up is another Wilkinson song, “God Knows How Much Mercy I Need”, which features Rice. Some fans may remember this one from when Mark Trammell Quartet recorded it back in 2010, but this is a great cut that the group changed up a bit, and I love the ending they put on this with Ellison. Speaking of Jacob, he’s featured on the next song, the up-tempo “Jesus Is Enough”, written by the groups drummer Dennis Murphy. Jacob takes the verses while Chapman leads the chorus.\n\n“Tell Me Again” is a mid tempo tune, that features Rice. Harris is featured again on the uptempo “Never Changing God” and what a great song. Loren has been a home run for the KH, an awesome addition who gives has given the group another dimension vocally. Things slow down for the next cut, “What You Could Never Get Over”, which features Ellison. When I initially heard this song, I thought the group was covering a Black Gospel/CCM song. When I got my physical copy, I was shocked and amazed to see the song was written by Rodney Griffin. There is so much I want to say about this song, in fact I have another post dedicated to this song that I will post this weekend, but I want to include my thoughts here as well. Jacob Ellison is a breath of fresh air to SG Industry, this guy is awesome. He’s got the power to sing high but he also can sing a lyric like this with the tenderness the arrangement calls for. I mentioned earlier that some of his tones reminded me of Kirk Talley, while on this song his tones reminded me of the great Steve Perry from Journey. He put so much soul into this performance and it shows. Both the lyrics of the song and the performance are MUST HEAR! I really hope Crossroads sends this song to radio, it’s a message that will connect to folks. Stay tuned for my next post, you won’t want to miss it. Now, back to the review.\n\nThe pace picks up a bit with a shuffling mid tempo quartet tune, “He Worked It Out”, which features Chapman and Ellison. I cannot go any further in this review without complimenting Jeff. It’s also hard to believe Chapman has been with the KH for 20 Years, singing bass. Jeff is without a doubt in my mind, the best bass singer in our business. He can sing lower than anybody you can think of, past or present, in the history of our Genre, but he can also sing in his upper register as good as anyone too. He may not win the fan awards, but there is no doubt in our industry that Jeff Chapman is THE Best bass singer in our industry. The project comes to a close with a great energetic song, “What My God Can Do”, which features Ellison. It’s an enjoyable song, but then the encore comes in, and Jacob goes into the stratosphere. All I could say is, “wow”. I write this review, letting my “worldly musical influences” come out a bit, but I can only compare the high note Jacob hits to one song I’ve heard in my life, “The Great Gig In The Sky” by Pink Floyd. If you know, you know.\n\nThe Kingdom Heirs are one of the most solid and dependable groups in our genre, you know when you listen to their music you will hear a great quartet recording. As always, the song selection, vocals, and performances captured on this project displays what I as a Gospel Music fan love about the KH and what keeps me listening. I believe they are the strongest they’ve ever been vocally, this lineup has no weak links. One of the most refreshing things about this project, in my opinion, is to have a group of the stature of The Kingdom Heirs, bring in a guy that is fresh blood, a new name and face in our industry, who is obviously talented. THIS is what we need in SG! We’ve got too many groups bringing back the best guy they know that retired 2-3 years ago and keeping the pool of talent small and relative to a few names. But getting some young people who are talented, excited about this music, and want to minister in this capacity is what SG needs and I’m glad to see it in Jacob and The Kingdom Heirs.\n\nIn closing, I really enjoyed listening to “I Feel A Good Day Coming On” and believe it to be the best album released in 2021. Please be sure to pick up a physical copy of the cd, stream it or download it, whatever you do. If you’ve heard this project already, share your thoughts with me, I’d love to hear from you!\n\nA review copy was not provided.\n\nWhen it comes to quartet singing in Gospel Music, The Kingdom Heirs have been the standard bearers of excellence for our industry many years. The nucleus of lead singer Arthur Rice, bass vocalist Jeff Chapman, and tenor singer Jerry Martin have done nothing but benefit from the addition of baritone Loren Harris in 2016. This lineup is arguably the best ever been in the history of the KH. They’ve virtually done it all, but their latest project “Everything In Between“, released on Sonlite Records/Crossroads, presents a new concept the group has never tried before on a mainline project. This time around, the group decided to try a different approach with 6 songs recorded with studio musicians, 3 songs recorded acapella, and 3 instrumentals performed by the Award Winning Kingdom Heirs band of pianist Andy Stringfield, bass player Kreis French, and drummer Dennis Murphy.\n\nThe project kicks off with an acapella song, Just Drink The Water, which is a new song, that has a great tempo and is done well. Next up is an uptempo song, “Come To The Well, which is the first radio single and features Rice. These songs are straight up Arthur’s alley and he knocks it out of the park as always. Chapman is featured on the next track, “Everything In Between“, which is a wonderful straight up, quartet tune. The band makes their first instrumental appearance on the Elvis favorite, “Cryin In The Chapel“. Loren Harris steps up to take his first feature on “I Have Overcome“, which is the first of four songs written/co-written by Dianne Wilkinson. One of my favorite songs on the project, it’s a great lyric written from the perspective of Jesus that tells the believer there is nothing we can’t overcome because of the finished work of Calvary.\n\nAnother Wilkinson track and the second acapella tune “Nothin’s Gonna Keep Me Down“, features Chapman. Jeff Chapman is not just one of the best bass singers going today, but he’s one of the most versatile singers in Gospel Music today, he can sing as low as anyone but also has the range to sing like a baritone. His features are always one of the highlights of a Kingdom Heirs recording and this song is no exception.\n\nReady For Glory is another great new song with the old time sounding quartet sound done to perfection. The band is featured on another instrumental, a red back classic, “He Set Me Free“. Harris featured on another song, “I’ll Never Get Over The Blood That I’m Under“, which was co-written by Dennis Murphy. The group brings another acapella song, “Holy, Holy Is What The Angels Sing“. The project comes to a close with another Wilkinson song, “High On Zion’s Mountain“, which features Jerry Martin. This songs reminds me of something the Blackwood Brothers of the 60’s & 70’s would have recorded, I can easily hear Bill Shaw or Pat Hoffmaster in my mind singing this song. Martin does a fine job and with only piano and orchestration, the arrangement fits this songs to a tee. The perfect closing track for the project.\n\nWhen I first heard the concept of this recording, I was skeptical that it would work and I had my doubts. But the Kingdom Heirs know what their audience likes and they deliver, every time. This project is no exception Normally, I cannot listen to a cd all the way through, but I have listened to Everything In Between multiple times without skipping a song. That is the mark of a quality recording. Everything In Between truly does offer everything that Gospel Music fans have come to expect from the Kingdom Heirs, and more. This was one of my favorite recordings of 2019 and if you don’t own it yet, I would highly recommend downloading/purchasing this cd!\n\nReview copy provided by Crossroads Music, a positive review was not required."
