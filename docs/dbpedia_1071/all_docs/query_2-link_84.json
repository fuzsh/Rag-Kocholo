        "text": "WELLS - WELLS - J. Norman Wilkinson, 81, died Friday, Dec. 23, 2011, at Maine Medical Center with his family at his side. Norman was born May 14, 1930, in Liverpool, England, son of Arthur and Matilda (Fowler) Wilkinson. He grew up in England and served as a radio operator for the British Merchant Marine. He met his future wife, the former Dorothy Ann Midgley aboard ship. They were married Jan. 31, 1958, and were blessed to share nearly 54 years together. In the early 1960s, Norman became a citizen of the U.S. He earned his bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees from the University of Michigan. For 35 plus years, he taught performing arts at the University of Maine, from where he retired as professor emeritus. He and Dorothy moved to Wells in the 1990s, where Norman remained active in Ogunquit Rotary Club, Wells Library Committee, the Congregational church and numerous other organizations. Norman loved animals, especially his cats, Emma and Parthia; and walking along the beach with his beloved Dorothy. He was predeceased by two brothers, Arthur Vernon Wilkinson and Lewis Wilkinson. Survivors include his loving wife, Dorothy of Wells; son, Norman Wilkinson and his wife, Debbie, of Groton, Mass.; daughter, Dr. Susan Wilkinson and her husband, James Schultz, of Omaha, Neb.; sister, Esther Joyce Godsell of Liverpool, England; two grandchildren, Brandon and Nicole Wilkinson; and stepgrandson, Adam Schultz. There are no calling hours. A memorial service will be held 1 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 29, at Congregational Church of Wells, 1695 Post Road, U.S. Route One, Wells, with the Rev. Charles Whiston officiating. Norman would be honored by donations made in his memory to American Alzheimer's Association - Maine Chapter, 383 U.S. Route One, Suite 2C, Scarborough, ME 04074; or The Rotary Club of Ogunquit, P.O. Box 2338, Ogunquit, ME 03907. Arrangements are in care of Bibber Memorial Chapel, 111 Chapel Road, Wells."
