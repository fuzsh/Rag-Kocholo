        "text": "Q: I have a water pitcher and bowl set that I bought 40 years ago for $85. The set includes a second, smaller pitcher and a soap dish that has an insert with drainage holes. All the pieces are decorated with green vines and pink flowers surrounding images of a woman and of a child with wings. The mark on the bottom of the pitcher has a crown above the words \"Wilkinson Ltd., England.\" Is the set worth much?\n\nA: Arthur J. Wilkinson (Ltd.) was in business in Burslem, Staffordshire, England, from 1885 until the factory was sold in 1964. The company made earthenware, ironstone, and white graniteware. Sets like yours were popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s before indoor plumbing was common. A set was placed on a small table or washstand in the bedroom. Value of a four-piece set is about $150."
