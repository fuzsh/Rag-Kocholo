        "text": "Beatles Covers and Beatlemania\n\n1963 - International creative cover versions\n\n1964 - Beatlemania\n\nIn 1964 the Beatles released their LP A hard day's night.\n\nIn the US the LP was released as Original Sound Track and in this format it has some poppy orchestral Beatles Cover Versions. All performed by the George Martin Orchestra.\n\n1964 - George Martin Orchestra\n\nThe George Martin Orchestra released also an LP with all tracks of A hard day's night. Later followed by other full Beatles song material.\n\n1964 - Hollyridge Strings\n\nBesides the George Martin Orchestra, 1964 was the start of many other orchestral Beatles Covers.\n\nIn the US the popular Hollyridge Strings Orchestra released their first Beatles Cover LP. It was the start of an extending series.\n\n1964 - Other poppy orchestrations / Chorus singers\n\n1964 - Humor and Parody\n\n1964 - Jazz and personal interpretations\n\n1964 - Chipmunks\n\nItems from 1964 (in this collection)\n\n1965 - Yesterday\n\n1965 saw the release of the most covered popsong. In the UK Yesterday was just a song on the LP Help!, in the US and several European countries it was released as a single.\n\nIn the same year Yesterday was covered in very different styles. James Last had his poppy orchestration, Marianne Faithfull had a hit with her version and Mary Wells created a soul (Motown) version.\n\nIn The Netherlands Jazz singer Rita Reys (and the Pim Jacobs Combo) released a very Jazzy version and in Spain Emi Bonilla released his translatation of the song in the Spanish flamenco style.\n\nIn 1966 more translations followed. In The Netherlands Ria Valk released Beste Kees, a parody text about a missing dog, or cat, called Kees. And comedian / actor Rijk de Gooyer released Yesterday with a humoristic Dutch text about a man who meets a woman in a bar.\n\n1965 - Classical and Ballet\n\nIn 1965 the orchestrated cover versions of Beatles songs got more classical. Eine Kleine Beatlemusic, Help... Mozart and Cracker Suite (music for a ballet) by Arthur Wilkinson did their entry.\n\nSee more items with classical covers\n\n1966 - Band of the Irish Guards\n\n1967 - Beatles Arias\n\nIn 1967 the classical interpretations went on and well known mezzo-soprano Cathy Berberian added operatic style to cover versions of songs by the Beatles to the wide range of Beatles covers.\n\nAnd so on, and so on, Items of 1968...\n\nBeatles songs given away\n\nAlready starting in 1963 several Beatles songs that were not officially recorded by The Beatles were given away to other artists.\n\nBeatles manager Brian Epstein was also manager of some other local artists.\n\nAt first they were the Liverpool Fourmost, the London Rolling Stones and the local Billy Kramer & the Dakotas. Liverpool singer Cilla Black followed in 1964 just as Peter & Gorden (Peter Asher & Gordon Waller). Peter Asher was the brother of Jane Asher who was at that time Paul McCartney's girlfriend.\n\nSeveral of these given away songs became hits and some of them became even big hits. Of course the composer Brand Name 'Lennon & McCartney' seemed to help with this success.\n\nTo prove that it was not only the composer name Lennon-McCartney that was important, Paul McCartney gave his song Woman to Peter & Gordon under the pseudonym Bernard Webb (and in the US: A. Smith).\n\nWoman became a hit.\n\nNew Cover Versions\n\nAll new cover versions keep Beatles songs and Beatles history alive for new generations!!"
