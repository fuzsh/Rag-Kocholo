        "text": "Hi all!\n\nIt's well known that many of the most beloved rock and pop classic songs have been orchestrated over the decades\n\nWhat are your favourite orchestrations?\n\nI'll start with what's arguably the most poingnant and finest ever Beatles orchestration to me: 'All My Loving'\n\nFor ages, when I watched the Magical Mystery Tour film, the only scene that truly moved me was when the old man and 'Ringo's aunt' Jessie where loving and enjoying each other at the beach.\n\nThe music was Arthur Wilkinson's arrangement, based on Tchaikovsky's 'Pas de Deux'.\n\nHere it is. Simply wonderful.\n\nSuch a shame it has never been released on CD. Enjoy\n\nA few years ago, I attended to a local classical guitar concert @ Valparaiso\n\nAmong the program, it was a Beatles suite for guitar and orchestra, arranged by the famous guitarist and composer Leo Brouwer.\n\nI was really moved by the quality of the orchestrations. 'Yesterday' in particular is awe-inspiring. Also 'She's Leaving Home', 'Eleanor Rigby' and 'Here, There and Everywhere'\n\nSit, listen and enjoy"
