        "text": "Her extensive musical focus is a formidable exercise in stylistic variety which is evident in her concerts and recordings that encompass the great music of the Baroque, works for fortepiano from the18th and 19th centuries, harpsichord repertoire of the Americas, as well as contemporary works, among which she has premiered over 50 new works and many of them were dedicated to her. Chenlo has also been engaged in important studies involving the transcription and research of various 18th and 19th century keyboard works, and has taught courses in the aesthetics and interpretation of music from these periods at festivals and conservatories in Spain and the Americas.\n\nCollaborations with prestigious conductors are numerous and include Howard Mitchell, Stanislav Wislocki, Héctor Tosar, Arturo Tamayo, Pierre Colombo, Antal Dorati, Kiril Kondrashin, José Luis Temes, Antonio Ros Marba, Miguel Patron Marchand, Jordi Bernàcer; and she has worked with recognized performing artists such as Enrico Gatti, John Halloway, Sharon Gould, Christian Baude, Paul Esswood and Claire Powel among others. As a renowned soloist, Chenlo has performed in international music festivals such as Prague Spring, the Festivals of Navarra, Autumn Festival of Paris, the Contemporary Music Festivals of Alicante, Music of the 20th Century of Bilbao, International Festival of Segovia, Festival Bach, Claremont-Ferrand Festival and others. She has often collaborated with the Orquesta Camerata Española directed by Victor Martin, with the group LIM of Jesús Villa Rojo, and was a founding member of the Madrid Camerata conducted by Luis Remartínez.\n\nHer career is marked by numerous awards and recognitions such as the Jacques Antoine Prize of the Monte Carlo Festival, three-time winner of the Premio Nacional de Disco in Spain, and honorable distinction at the TRIMALACA 2000 of UNESCO. She has recorded for ETNOS, TIC-TAC, DIAL DISCOS, VIENNA MODERN MASTERS, URTEXT, VERSO, FACTORIA AUTOR, RADIO NACIONAL and TELEVISION ESPANOLA, TELEVISION de EE.UU. and the BBC in London. Her latest recording is for NIBIUS of the excellent score, Las Indias Olvidadas-The Forgotten Indies, by Sergio Cervetti. This concerto is dedicated to her which she plays with the instrumental ensemble of the National Youth Orchestra of Spain (JONDE) conducted by Jordi Bernácer.\n\nAs an example of what critics have written about her interpretative playing, the reviewer of the Czech newspaper Lidova Demokracie wrote the following about her performance at the Spring Festival of Prague: “María Teresa Chenlo is an artist who is a skillful interpreter. Her recital was an exposition of virtuoso technique and rhythmical precision along with a beautiful phrasing and musical elegance…It was a concert of total, genuine emotion.”"
