        "text": "An intimate epic that puts in perspective our current era, The Warmth Of Other Suns follows Ida Mae Brandon Gladney, George Swanson Starling, and Robert Joseph Pershing Foster over the tumultuous decades of the 20th century as they join the six million African-Americans fleeing southern repression in what would come to be known as the Great Migration, a watershed in American history.\n\nThis deeply researched book interweaves their stories with the larger forces that triggered one of the largest migrations within the borders of this country.\n\n“Absolutely revolutionary,” Ta-Nehisi Coates said of The Warmth of Other Suns. “I always felt like it was the spiritual mother of ‘The Case for Reparations.’”\n\nThe Great Migration was a leaderless quest for freedom, lasting from World War I to the 1970s, and became one of the biggest underrecognized stories of the 20th Century. It changed the country, North and South. It brought us John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk, Toni Morrison, August Wilson, Bill Russell, Motown, Denzel Washington, Michelle Obama -- all children or grandchildren of the Great Migration. It changed the social, cultural and political landscape of the United States, with consequences that persist to the current day.\n\nThe Warmth of Other Suns became an instant New York Times bestseller upon publication and has reappeared multiple times since its release. It has been named to TIME’s 10 Best Nonfiction Books of the Decade and to The New York Times Magazine’s Best Nonfiction of All Time.\n\nVisit The Warmth of Other Suns website ▷\n\nThrough her writing, Wilkerson brings the invisible and the marginalized into the light and into our hearts. Through her lectures, she explores with authority the need to reconcile America’s karmic inheritance and the origins of both our divisions and our shared commonality.\n\nHer debut work, The Warmth of Other Suns, won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Heartland Prize for Nonfiction, the Anisfield-Wolf Award for Nonfiction, the Lynton History Prize from Harvard and Columbia universities, and the Stephen Ambrose Oral History Prize and was shortlisted for both the Pen-Galbraith Literary Award and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize.\n\nShe is a native of Washington, D.C., and a daughter of the Great Migration, the mass movement that she would go on to write about. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing in 1994, as Chicago Bureau Chief of The New York Times, making her the first African-American woman to win a Pulitzer Prize in journalism. She then devoted fifteen years and interviewed more than 1,200 people to tell the story of the six million people, among them her parents, who defected from the Jim Crow South.\n\nAs for her new book, Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, the venerable U.K. bookseller, Waterstone’s calls it an “expansive, lyrical and stirring account of the unspoken system of divisions that govern our world.”"
