        "text": "After living the past couple years between the pages of comic books directing two \"Avengers\" films and reshaping \"Justice League,\" Joss Whedon will return to television with the HBO series \"The Nevers.\"\n\n“The Nevers is maybe the most ambitious narrative I’ve created,” Whedon said in an HBO press release. “It’s been too long since I created an entirely new fictional world.”\n\nBefore film, Whedon had a prolific television career creating critical darlings that were often canceled before their time like \"Firefly\" and \"Dollhouse.\"\n\n\"The Nevers\" will tap into Whedon's most prolific creation \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" which ran for seven seasons in the late 90's. An epic science fiction drama featuring powerful female characters, the series will revolve around a gang of Victorian women with unusual abilities who fight opposing forces on a mission to change the world.\n\n“We have long been fans of the incredibly talented and prolific Joss Whedon and we can’t think of a better project than The Nevers with which to welcome him to the HBO family,” Casey Bloys, president of HBO programming, said in the press release. “We look forward to meeting the strange, multifaceted characters, to learn their stories, see them in action and share them with our viewers.”\n\nWhedon will serve as an executive producer, showrunner, writer, and director on the series.\n\nIf you love television and love talking about it even more, USA TODAY Life’s Yes, I'm Still Watching is here for you.
