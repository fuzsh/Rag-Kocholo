        "text": "And the winner is...\n\nReady for it?...\n\nAt No.1...\n\nNo.1- HUSH!\n\nWith a 7.5 lead, Hush won by quite a margin.\n\nComing up is the write up, but first, here is the commentary for outstanding episode that is The Body...\n\nNo. 2- The Body\n\nAn extremely respectable 2nd place for this incredible episode. As @Hudweiser puts it: \"I don't want to think about this episode because it's still painful, but this is beautiful television.\"\n\nIt wouldn’t have been appropriate, in my mind, for this episode to have won, simply because it isn’t representative of Buffy the series- the fight in the morgue does jar quite roughly- but it’s simply brilliant on all levels. A truly harrowing but expertly observed piece of television that often feels apart from the rest of the series. I was a HUGE fan of Six Feet Under, yet I’d go so far as to say that Joss manages to top even that series’ best moments in terms of how brutally realised death is in this one single hour.\n\n@Shockbox : \"OMG this episode is awful. It's just so painful. After 5 seasons, Joyce feels like your own mother. Sometimes I skip this episode and pretend Joyce just went on a well deserved holiday.\"\n\n@sfmartin : \"So difficult to watch. Astounding dramatic performances. Should have won all the awards. So well written, Anya’s speech.\"\n\n@SushiJoe : \"This has my 11 - even though its neither my favourite episode, nor one that I can ever rewatch. Sometimes an hour of television goes beyond its medium to deliver on a level that can't quite be put into words or described. This is that. In a show full of death, a genre that relies on bodies, this is one that can never matched.\"\n\n@vague : \"The biggest fear I have in life is losing my mom, and The Body just really hits it home that someday, no matter what, it's going to happen. I've watched this episode probably a dozen times, and I still cry every single time. Sarah Michelle Gellar gives her best ever performance here in this episode; right from the first second she sells every emotion so perfectly.\"\n\n@Asmgz : \"A non-surprisingly critically-lauded episode, which is perfect in every frame and feels more like an art film than an episode of US Television - on a “teenage” network-show furthermore. SMG gives one of the great performances of her life and the framing of the episode, as well as the long takes highlight that, unmistakingly. Anya’s monologue is classic already and was a great way to thwart existential human pain with her (former) demonic world-view. Alyson Hannigan’s sweater-searching-scene was also brilliantly acted in all it’s warm, confused willow-ness. All in all a genuine, heartbreaking moment of stillness, before the outwardly tumultuous final run of episode’s closing this season.\"\n\n@One Stop Candy Shop : \"So many great moments in this episode: that long 1-take scene at the start, that 'fantasy' bit where Joyce is revived by the paramedics, Anya's speech, Willow searching her sweater and Anya sitting on it a while later. The lack of soundtrack was also an excellent choice.\"\n\n@P'NutButter : \"Deserved all awards - Emmy's should be ashamed!\"\n\n@Lost In Japan. : \"Say it loud, say it proud: HOW DID SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR NOT GET AN EMMY NOMINATION FOR BUFFY. A tour-de-force performance here, and great showings from the rest of the cast too. A completely unexpected episode (from a show which always dealt with real life issues through metaphor and allegory, rather than straight on) and I think that is why it has gone down in history. Incredible.\"\n\n@DJHazey : \"If I could give another 11, it might go here. Everything about the entire hour is a punch to the gut, I remember my Mom and I never having a dry eye throughout. It's a tough watch, but a necessary one. Watching each member of the Scooby Gang deal with Joyce's death in their own way made everything so much more affecting. Buffy, going into 'numb autopilot' mode because of the situation; having to deal with the responsibilities that come when a loved one dies. We could've heard Buffy tell Dawn what had happened, but instead we are left to our imaginations as we watch Dawn collapse to the floor through the lens of a window. This definitely made it even harder to watch and was all the more incredible for it. Then Willow not being able to think straight and Tara being a rock to both her and later Buffy. Then of course one of Anya's finest moments on the show. I can't even talk about it because it's too much. If someone posts the video I refuse to watch it. For a long time, I was never able to get \"Mom?...Mom?...Mommy?\" out of my head. Something so simple and so innocent when you realize this powerful Slayer was also someone's child. The world literally stops at this moment and we begin a journey of grieving and healing together as if the characters on the show are now part of our family.\"\n\nI wish I could write like you DJHazey!\n\n@VicePresidentJocasta : \"For me, this is the best hour of television of all time. Having lost a parent at a young age, I don’t recall a film or television episode that so accurately depicted the sort of numbing monotony that follows the death of a loved one. The opening moments are absolutely heart-breaking, and I maintain that Sarah deserved an Emmy for what she did in the scene where Buffy finds Joyce. Anya’s speech is such a moment; it’s something that only a series as wonderfully weird as Buffy could pull off while feeling totally relatable.\"\n\n@New Flame : \"Special episode and makes you think about that horrible idea of your parents dying and what to do. It numbs the soul. It doesn’t get a 10, because I think they went a bit too far in the morgue. The whole episode feels so human and real, except for that moment and battle.\"\n\n@Presibrent : \"Such a heartbreaking episode. I teared up seeing Joyce on the couch. The moment when Buffy throws up and all we hear is wind chimes captures the moment perfectly, there’s an odd stillness in the air when someone passes away. Amazing episode.\"\n\n@AstronautMikeDexter : \"What a doozy. Who expected this outcome for Joyce? The false hope that her tumor had been removed and she was recovering and then she ended up dying from a brain aneurism. I remember back in season 2 when Angelus was waiting for Joyce outside of her home and she dropped her groceries. I thought she was a goner then, it was so tense. For her to quietly depart was so unexpected and raw and real. The acting from everyone in this episode was Grade A excellent. I tear up just thinking about it – from Buffy’s frantic “Mom, Mom, Mommy…” to Anya’s breakdown questioning why people die. It’s one of the most emotional episodes of television I have ever seen.\"\n\nNot an episode I go back to often- I found myself in Buffy's exact position when I was 12- but anyone who tries to deny this episode's simple genius should be forced to rewatch it again. But where on earth do you start when you're trying to deconstruct an episode with so many unexpected but weirdly on-point moments?\n\nThe way in which Joss and Sarah convey the weird, intense, overwhelming (insert appropriate/ any adjective) mix of emotions you experience when you encounter the death of a loved one is totally authentic. The numbness, the hopelessness, the sheer pain. Buffy pathetically telling the paramedic 'good luck' is exactly the dumb thing I can imagine myself calling out all those years ago.\n\nBuffy suddenly retreating to a warm memory of Thanksgiving, only to lurch back as the pie hits the floor- sublime. And oh so fucking cruel- for a minute, we too are tricked by even Anya's positivity at the dinner table; by the sweet moment Buffy shares with her mother as only an eldest daughter could get away with such teasing. Equally effective is the delusion that Joyce gets saved in the ambulance, as well as Buffy hearing what she wants to hear as the doctor tries to comfort her in vain.\n\nA thoroughly strong ensemble means that this is not just Buffy's episode (though SMG surely deserved an Emmy?). The scene at Dawn's school is painful, not least when Dawn valiantly tries to save face in front of a Mean Girl- it's Joss showing us that there will always be other pain to experience, as well as death. The teacher's resemblance to Kristine Sutherland is surely not just a coincidence either?\n\nMuch gets said about Emma Caulfield's performance in this episode- it is brilliant- though it isn't just her performance. Alyson Hannigan is equally great, as is Amber Benson- Tara and Buffy's awkwardness in the hospital with each other is tangible. Buffy is at her most vulnerable and she's letting someone who is still almost an outsider witness it.\n\nDespite this not being a huge favourite of mine- I did nominate it, but only reluctantly- I still feel as though I cannot do its brilliance justice with any kind of write up.\n\nStats:\n\nScore: 311.5\n\nAverage: 9.73\n\nMe: 10, @Maria 11, @BTG 10, @LPMA 11, @VicePresidentJocasta 11, @silkandskin 10, @ladylloyd 10, @SushiJoe 11, @P'NutButter 10, @Mikl C 10, @Shockbox 10, @Joe. 10, @One Stop Candy Shop 9.5, @Hudweiser 10, @Presibrent 10, @GhettoPrincess 10, @DJHazey 10, @New Flame 8, DJHazey's Dad: 5, DJHazey's Mom: 5, @Lost In Japan. 10, @Asmgz 10, @vague 10, @Spiderwebs 10, @playboy69 10, @sfmartin 10, @Robsolete 10, @Animalia 10, @kalonite 10, @unnameable 10, @JamesJupiter 10, @AstronautMikeDexter 10\n\nHighest scorers: @Maria , @LPMA , @VicePresidentJocasta , @SushiJoe\n\nLowest scorers: DJHazey's Mom, DJHazey's Dad (though it must be pointed out that, despite most voters giving this episode a 10 or 11, they weren't the only ones not to!)\n\nWrite up for Season 5 coming, then your scores and AMAZING commentary for Hush!\n\nR.I.P. Season 5!\n\nAnother season which seems to be regarded by most as a particularly strong one, even a favourite in a lot of cases, Season 5 benefited greatly from an almost ‘reset’ feature with the introduction of Dawn. After a somewhat predictable story arc in Season 4, Season 5’s entire premise sounded exciting, fresh, yet also as if it was returning to its roots more. Rather than proceeding down an avenue which some might deem a little too military, Season 5 felt a lot more mythological, what with monks, gods and even Dracula featuring. Not only did the tone feel more familiar, interesting and comfortable, but the team of scoobies themselves, as a solid unit, felt like a much greater focus. And that there is one of the reasons why this is such a popular season. Family may have been the first episode to leave this rate, but it is very representative of this incredible season. The scoobies drawing closer together in the face of a seemingly unbeatable foe (okay, I’m reaching a bit with the unbeatable aspect for Family- the demons were only invisible- though facing down her own family was likely a lot more challenging for Tara than a vampire).\n\nJoyce’s sickness was a thoroughly depressing arc, as was Buffy relationship angst, though it was what was borne out of those arcs- Buffy’s strengths and the scoobie’s support- that made this season soar. There were times during this season, e.g. Listening to Fear, The Body, Triangle, that Buffy could easily have lost the plot and crumbled- imagine if any of this had happened to Faith?- yet she ultimately overcame everything and was able to face off valiantly against a god on several occasions. She stood her ground well during Blood Ties and Tough Love, and then truly served Glory a can of whoop-ass (both physically and verbally) in The Gift.\n\nStrength thy name be Buffy.\n\nI’m not sure I can think of a more polarising villain (perhaps with the exception of Dark Willow) than Glory. A great many fans I’ve spoken to (and non-fans interestingly) regard Glory as the greatest Big Bad. Sadly, a lot of fans (including some around these parts) weren’t too fussed by her. I personally loved her- she’s my favourite Big Bad, and you can’t imagine my excitement when I met Clare Kramer in 2002. She was funny and gracious, and it comes as no surprise to me that she’s now incredibly popular at the Comic Cons where she’s regularly asked to host and compere.\n\nThen we have Dawn. It takes a great deal of creativity and skill to be able to rewrite a show in such a way; to do so in such a way that Dawn felt as if she truly had always been there again shows great talent on the actors’ parts. I still found her as irritating as Hell, and it’s only really Season 7 where I began to fully tolerate the petulant, sassy cow.\n\nI can fully understand those of you who favour this season as your favourite, particularly when you have such a strong collection of episodes- with Season 5, it’s easier to choose the bad episodes rather than the good, simply because there’s so few of them that they stand out a mile.\n\nA truly iconic season, which ends with a narration by the eponymous hero that still, sadly, resonates with the state of the world now.\n\nThank goodness our winning episode is a much more light-hearted affair!"
