Whedon added, “I’m grateful to Geoff and Toby and everyone who was so welcoming when I arrived, and so understanding when I… uh, is there a sexier word for ‘failed’?”\n\nAlso Read: Joss Whedon Is a 'Hypocrite Preaching Feminist Ideals,' Ex-Wife Kai Cole Says (Guest Blog)\n\nBatgirl made her debut in the Batman mythos fifty years ago as Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner Jim Gordon. Since then she has become one of the most popular superheroines in the world. When Barbara Gordon was paralyzed by a gunshot from the Joker in the controversial classic graphic novel “The Killing Joke,” other crimefighters, like The Huntress and Orphan, took up the Batgirl name while Barbara became Oracle, a tech-savvy aide to Batman. Barbara later returned to the Batgirl role, while her assault in “The Killing Joke” was retconned.\n\nWhedon has served as a core creative force behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe as director of “The Avengers” and its 2015 sequel, “Age of Ultron.” He also had a hand in Marvel’s expansion to television by co-creating the ABC series “Agents of SHIELD” in 2013.\n\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n\nLindsay Lohan Wants to Star in Joss Whedon's 'Batgirl' Movie\n\nJoss Whedon's Batgirl Movie: Twitterverse Votes on Who Should Play Lead Role (Photos)"
