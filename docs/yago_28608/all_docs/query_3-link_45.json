        "text": "Joseph \"Joss\" Hill Whedon (born 23 June 1964) is an American screenwriter, film and television director, film and television producer, comic book author, composer and actor whose works have emphasized themes of feminism, anti-authoritarianism, existentialism and absurdism.\n\nSee also:\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer (1992 film)\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer (1997 - 2003)\n\nAngel (1999 - 2004)\n\nFirefly (2002 - 2003)\n\nAstonishing X-Men (2004 - 2008)\n\nSerenity (2005 film)\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods (2012)\n\nThe Avengers (2012 film)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first thing I ever thought of when I thought of Buffy, the movie, was the little...blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed, in every horror movie. The idea of Buffy was to subvert that idea, that image, and create someone who was a hero where she had always been a victim. That element of surprise … genre-busting is very much at the heart of both the movie and the series.\n\nWelcome to the Hellmouth (1997) DVD Commentary\n\nI think there's a lot of people out there who say we must not have horror in any form, we must not say scary things to children because it will make them evil and disturbed... That offends me deeply, because the world is a scary and horrifying place, and everyone's going to get old and die, if they're that lucky. To set children up to think that everything is sunshine and roses is doing them a great disservice. Children need horror because there are things they don't understand. It helps them to codify it if it is mythologized, if it's put into the context of a story, whether the story has a happy ending or not. If it scares them and shows them a little bit of the dark side of the world that is there and always will be, it's helping them out when they have to face it as adults.\n\nSaid to Michael Silverberg of NPR; quote featured in the Buffy Monster Book (2000)\n\nI believe we are the only sentient beings in the universe, and I believe that 500 years from now, we will still be the only sentient beings around. … Aliens are something everyone else is doing.\n\nAs quoted in \"Whedon creates space cowboys in 'Firefly'\" in Post-Gazette (22 July 2002)\n\nVery occasionally, if you really pay attention, life doesn’t suck.\n\nLiner notes to the cast album Once More, with Feeling (2002)\n\nYou can either watch TV or you can make TV.\n\nUnderground Online, interview by Michael Patrick Sullivan\n\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I took the road less traveled by and they CANCELLED MY FRIKKIN' SHOW. I totally shoulda took the road that had all those people on it. Damn.\n\nBronze Beta web message board, (14 February 2004) [1]; after Whedon's discovery that The WB had cancelled Angel. Compare: \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference.\" Robert Frost, \"The Road Not Taken\" (1916).\n\nThe network called up and said 'We piggybacked you on the deal for another show,' I'm like 'Okay, so what you're saying to my writers is that they weren't picked up when they thought they were and now that they are it was because of something that has nothing to do with them. Okay. Great. Stop calling'.\n\nUnderground Online, interview by Michael Patrick Sullivan\n\nNote: This is in reference to the WB network announcing that Angel had been confirmed for a full fifth season of 22 episodes, when Mutant Enemy Productions had already assumed that to be so.\n\nMy visions of the future are always pretty much standard issue. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer... and there are flying cars.\n\nTV Guide (27 December – 2 January 2004), and Foreword to Fray\n\nThe English Language is my bitch.

I've actually taken a huge amount of flack for that.\n\n\"Joss Whedon: Atheist & Absurdist\", comments made in a Q&A-session in Australia, while promoting his movie Serenity (2005)\n\nI believe the only reality is how we treat each other. The morality comes from the absence of any grander scheme, not from the presence of any grander scheme.\n\n\"Joss Whedon: Atheist & Absurdist\", comments made in a Q&A-session in Australia, while promoting his movie Serenity (2005)\n\nIf I made a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\n\n\"We Don’t Say Indian\" in Slay Age (2005); also quoted in Ink-stained Amazons and Cinematic Warriors: Superwomen in Modern Mythology (2010) by Jennifer K. Stuller\n\nStay crunchy, even in milk.\n\n\"Joss to never learn how to work site! Man is complete Melvin! Mock him!\" at Whedonesque.com (9 November 2005)\n\nI know there's been some debate about the DVD art. Just remember it's what's INside that counts, as I used to remind girls in high school constantly. CONSTANTLY — until I realized that I was empty inside. Empty and homely. Man, that's a rough combo.\n\n\"Joss to never learn how to work site! Man is complete Melvin! Mock him!\" at Whedonesque.com (9 November 2005)\n\nThe actors can make up their dialogue. I'm bushed, and they're all funny, and the hell with it. Maybe I'll give them a premise to work off of, like \"You're all in trouble\" or \"Wash has a thing\". They could maybe light it too.\n\n\"This explains Joss perfectly.\" at Whedonesque.com (15 February 2006)\n\nPeople love a happy ending. So every episode, I will explain once again that I don't like people. And then Mal will shoot someone. Someone we like. And their puppy.\n\n\"This explains Joss perfectly.\" at Whedonesque.com (15 February 2006)\n\nPeople with real power never fear of losing it.

She makes her big hurt eyes, there's nothing you can do. She just kills you.\n\nDVD commentary for Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode 2-14 \"Innocence\"\n\nI think that people need two kinds of fulfillment — one in which you give and one in which you hold back. Part of fulfillment is need, is longing, is being unfulfilled, that’s the nature of tragedy and a lot of drama. Very often, what the fans want, they get. But very often, what they want, they can’t quite have, because we want them to feel the way our characters felt...\n\n\"Joss Whedon on life, love, and leaving 'Buffy' behind\", Stanford Daily (16 May 2003)\n\nHello, I'm the writer and director. Now take your clothes off and get on top of Morena.\n\nReportedly said on the set of Serenity to Phillip Sternborg on his first day of filming, as quoted in the DVD commentary of Firefly boxset (2003).\n\nQ: So, why do you write these strong female characters?\n\nA: Because you’re still asking me that question.\n\n\"American Rhetoric: Joss Whedon - Equality Now Address\" (15 May 2006)\n\nI have had a dream my whole life... and it was not this good.\n\nOn being attached to direct The Avengers at the San Diego Comic-Con 2010\n\nAll worthy work is open to interpretations the author did not intend.

Puffy and pinched with sunken piggy eyes. The Germans have a word, Backpfeifengesicht, a face in need of a fist. Just looking at a picture of Whedon and any normal man feels his fingers instinctively start to clench.\n\nArkhaven Comics, The Gamma Boss: Joss Whedon February 13, 2021\n\nWhedon as man appears to have inspired no loyalty at all from the people that worked for him.\n\nArkhaven Comics, The Gamma Boss: Joss Whedon February 13, 2021\n\nJoss Whedon abused his power on numerous occasions while working together on the sets of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. While he found his misconduct amusing, it only served to intensify my performance anxiety, disempower me, and alienate me from my peers. The disturbing incidents triggered a chronic physical condition from which I still suffer. It is with a beating, heavy heart that I say I coped in isolation and, at times, destructively. Last summer, when Ray Fisher publicly accused Joss of abusive and unprofessional behaviour toward the cast and crew during reshoots on the Justice League set in 2017, it gutted me. Joss has a history of being casually cruel. He has created hostile and toxic work environments since his early career. I know because I experienced it first-hand. Repeatedly.\n\nCharisma Carpenter, twitter, 3:20 AM · Feb 11, 2021 (part one)\n\nJoss intentionally refused multiple calls from my agents making it impossible to connect with him to tell him the news that I was pregnant. Finally, once Joss was apprised of the situation, he requested a meeting with me. In that closed-door meeting, he asked me if I was \"going to keep it\" and manipulatively weaponized my womanhood and faith against me. He proceeded to attack my character, mock my religious beliefs, accuse me of sabotaging the show, and then unceremoniously fired me the following season once I gave birth.\n\nIt is abundantly evident that Joss has persisted in his harmful actions, continuing to create wreckage in his wake. My hope now, by finally coming forward about these experiences, is to create space for the healing of others who I know have experienced similar serialized abuses of power.\n\nCharisma Carpenter, twitter, 3:20 AM · Feb 11, 2021 (part two)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nJoss Whedon on IMDb"
