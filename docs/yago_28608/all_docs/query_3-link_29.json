        "text": "Joss Hill Whedon was born in New York on June 23, 1964. He attended Winshester College in England, and in 1987, Whedon earned his degree in film from Wesleyan University. His first writing assignment in Los Angeles was for the TV series Roseanne, after which he worked as a script doctor on a number of feature screenplays, including un-credited rewrites of the 1994 action hit, Speed.\n\nWhedon then made his return to television, creating three original TV series of his own. His genre classic Buffy the Vampire Slayer became a cult-hit with critics and fans alike, prompting the conception of Angel in 1999 as a spin-off starring one of the characters from Buffy.\n\nIn 2002, Fox put his third series, Firefly, on the air, but to the dismay of many a viewer, the show was cancelled after only eleven episodes. Whedon went on to write a feature screenplay based on Firefly, and thanks to the showâ€™s exceptional DVD sales, the script was produced by Universal, with Whedon attached to direct. The film became 2005's Serenity."
