        "text": "by Kerri Anne-McNally\n\nAvengers Assemble was a massive success. We all know that. It was a gamble but it forever changed cinema with the innovative idea of interconnectivity that other studios are now scrambling to copy. It’s the most successful comic book film in history and the sequel is set to follow in its footsteps. So where does Joss Whedon, the director of that billion dollar behemoth, go from there?\n\nFor the most part, the general movie going audience would only recognize Whedon’s name because he’s guy that directed Avengers Assemble. For those a little more savvy on their comicbook heroes they would know him for his part in creating the Marvel Universe that we know and love/adore/cherish/obsess over today. But, to those really in the know, this level of “quasi-celebrity” (as he likes to call himself) and responsibility has been a long time coming for Whedon.\n\nFrom Buffy The Vampire Slayer to Angel, Firefly to Dollhouse, he has been an icon of cult TV (despite the fact Firefly and Dollhouse were cancelled prematurely and, some might say, harshly). He was an auteur, constantly subverting the cultural clichés and was unafraid of bold, challenging storytelling. For example, when Buffy was commended (quite rightly) for its witty and engaging dialogue, Whedon decided to create a 42 minute episode wherein the characters couldn’t speak for the majority of the run time. That’s what he did. What he still does, just on a bigger scale.\n\nGiven his success on the little screen and his devoted fanbase, you’d be forgiven for thinking he made a splash in the big screen Hollywood pool before Marvel came aknocking. That wasn’t the case. His feature directing debut, Serenity – an effort to resurrect Firefly for a larger audience – tanked. His 2008 web series Dr Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog was well received by his fans and critics but ask the majority of people who hadn’t watched Buffy about Dr Horrible and they’ll stare at you blankly until you change the subject.\n\nWhedon has been quite vocal this time around about the process being incredibly draining and exhausting. The last five years have been dedicated solely to Marvel – apart from two weeks between projects where he indulged himself with writing and directing (and financing) a modern retelling of Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing with some of his regular collaborators. As much as it pained us to hear he was stepping down from any future Marvel projects (Captain America’s Russo Bros. have been drafted in to direct the two part Infinity Wars) maybe now he can indulge himself in something different. Challenge himself with something brand new or something that he’s always wanted to do. Despite his protests to the contrary in recent press, its most likely that other studios will pit him in the same leagues as James Cameron, Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan whereby they pretty much let them do whatever the hell they feel like.\n\nIts been bandied around for some time that Whedon would like to do ‘Goners’, which was sold to Universal quite a while ago but has never got off the ground. A mystical fantasy thriller with a female lead, it would be something Whedon could do in his sleep. It’s an intriguing prospect and one that wouldn’t take anyone by surprise. What would be interesting to see, however, are his takes on, and subsequently the subversion, of other genres. What about an action thriller? A romantic comedy? A romantic action thriller comedy with nuances of horror? He has the balls and now the exposure to make that happen and make it happen well!\n\nLet’s not also forget he is an incredible writer. He doctored many Hollywood scripts back in the day including some big well-known films without credit. Speed, Toy Story, Twister! His writing is incredibly distinctive and arguably his best skill – great director as he is. He has a knack for writing emotion and humour in a very refreshing way. Recently, he co-wrote Cabin In The Woods which, given it’s genre, was surprisingly critically acclaimed. He could have some time off to just write a script rather than helm the whole process.\n\nKnowing what we know of Whedon though, its doubtful either of those will be options for him. He does love to push himself, even if he hates himself for doing so. Will he go back to television perhaps – his original calling card? His brother Jed took over the creative processing of Agents of SHIELD when it was obvious Whedon’s commitments to the films were going to cause a few logistical issues. Can we look forward to a couple of Whedon -helmed episodes? Or maybe NETFLIX will do us all a sound and snap him up for one of their edgier Marvel TV shows? Again, this doesn’t feel exactly right for him though.\n\nIt’s difficult, because after making a billion dollars on one of your movies, what project could you move on to that felt like you were moving forward with your career? Surely everything from this point will feel, even if it’s judged successful, somehow LESS than what you did before? This decision is a big one, and one that we’ll all be waiting excitedly for.\n\nWhat Do You Think?"
