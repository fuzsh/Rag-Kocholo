        "text": "Editor's note: The buzz around Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is that she let slip that a character will die in book six, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\" due out on Saturday. Our own Germain Lussier, film critic and knower of all things pop culture, called a friend, Melissa Anelli, who works for Potter fan site The Leaky Cauldron and was invited to Scotland to interview Rowling at her house the day of publication. Anelli's take: \"You can be the first paper to correctly report that she has said no such thing. (Rowling) has only said there will be more deaths, period. Not specifying whether that is in book six, book seven or both.\"\n\nHere are our guesses on the seven likeliest characters to head to that big wizard school in the sky.\n\nBy Laura Dolce\n\nFor the Times Herald-Record\n\nladolce@verizon.net\n\nWhen Harry first meets Minerva McGonagall she's frowning down on him from a landing at Hogwarts the night he arrives there.\n\nImposing, tough and shrewd, McGonagall makes a formidable first impression. Turns out, though, she's a Tootsie Roll lollipop kind of a person â€” hard on the outside, but with a soft, sweet center. But is she tough enough to survive book six?\n\nWhy she's a goner: McGonagall, like Dumbledore, is one of the all-time good guys. Unafraid to speak her mind and stand up for what's right, she might find herself in harm's way with a wizard war erupting. While she seems likely to put herself between Harry and danger, she doesn't seem as invincible as Dumbledore's been up to now. This vulnerability could lead to her downfall. Also, Rowling might find it refreshing to let a woman be the hero for a change. Remember, she wrote that it was the love and sacrifice of Harry's mother Lily that saved him from Voldemort and gave him his power. It's possible another woman would sacrifice herself for Harry as well.\n\nShe won't go because: Like Hermione, Professor McGonagall is one of the few strong female characters in J.K. Rowling's books. She's also somewhat of a surrogate mother figure to Harry, and since he's lost one mum already, we don't see Rowling stripping him of another so soon. Also, there are rumors that Dame Maggie Smith, who plays McGonagall in the films, has agreed to appear in all seven movies. Meaning that if she died in book six, she'd still be appearing (in the mirror of Erised? In flashback scenes? In the shower with Bobby Ewing?) in the final movie.\n\nThe final word: We like both McGonagall and Maggie Smith and don't want to see them go. We suspect J.K. Rowling feels the same way, so she's probably safe for now.\n\nSaturday: Ron\n\nSunday: Harry\n\nMonday: Hermione\n\nTuesday: Snape\n\nWednesday: Hagrid"
