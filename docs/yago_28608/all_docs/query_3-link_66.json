        "text": "What did you do during your last vacation? Between the production and post-production of The Avengers, Joss Whedon decided to direct an adaptation of the Shakespearian rom-com-dram Much Ado About Nothing. Using a hand-picked cast from nearly every production he has ever been a part of, such as TV shows Dollhouse, Firefly, and Angel to name a few, he invited everyone over to his home, picked up a digital camera and some local cupcakes, and made a film. When we asked him about his Five Favorite Films, their influence on his work added another nuance to his numerous projects.\n\nNext, Whedon talks about his goals in tackling the work of The Bard.\n\nRT: I see so many elements of these movies in your films.\n\nJoss Whedon: Probably, it’s not like I’m not trying to steal from everybody all the time.\n\nRT: You mentioned opera, and particularly in the spirit of your stuff, Firefly goes in movements too, kind of like Once Upon a Time in the West.\n\nJW: Right. And even the fact that Fonda’s theme and Bronson’s theme come together at the end, that they all meld, it’s something they’re doing deliberately and gorgeously.\n\nRT: It happens in Avengers too, and even Much Ado, where you handle a lot of characters at once but it ends up feeling like one big coherent thing. It feels like one thing that makes sense.\n\nJW: Thank god. Much Ado being a romantic comedy drama, in a way, it’s the least florid of my movies, including any episodes of TV I’ve ever done. But the confidence I have in the people I’m working with and the text I am working from all calm me. Shakespeare is someone that I believe lived by a motto that I strive for, which is “subtlety is for little men.” There’s tons of subtlety for texture, but he’s go big or go home. If you’re gonna cry, you’re gonna cry hard, if you’re gonna laugh, you’re gonna laugh hard, and if I want you to do both of them at once, I’ll do that too. He’s got the control of a master. So in his hands, my job is so much easier.\n\nRT: But it’s big language and big emotions set against the simple backdrop of your house. As someone who isn’t well-versed in Shakespeare — sorry about that pun — it helped me focus in better and pick it up.\n\nJW: That was the idea. The intimacy and the casual sort of identifiability of the readings that we did were a big part of our mission statement. This doesn’t have to be something the audience isn’t in on. I want it to feel like, “Oh, Clark [Gregg] came to the house and did this,” and not [in his best classical Shakespeare voice] “And now he enters.” It is not a stately home movie.\n\nRT: But it was nice to see some Sprinkles cupcakes at the wedding reception.\n\nJW: Oh good."
