        "text": "It wasn't long ago that Joss Whedon's last TV series \"Dollhouse\" aired its final episode, but it looks like Whedon and \"Dollhouse\" star Eliza Dushku will be reteaming again for another feature project. Found on the gossip site Hollywood Life (via SlashFilm) is a quote from Dushku talking about a new project. \"I would say that we would [be working on something new very soon]!\" Dushku said. \"I think we're going to work on a kickass feature together that we've been thinking about for a few years.\" Well that sounds pretty cool - but exactly what is it? SlashFilm thinks it's a horror project called Goners that's been around since 2005.\n\nGoners is a supernatural horror thriller of some kind, but Whedon has been very secretive about it and we don't know really know what it's about. One quote says that \"it's the story of a young woman's journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics.\" Whedon describes it another time as \"a fantasy thriller, it is pretty dark and it's all me. So people will pretty much know what that means if they look at my body of work.\" That's not much help. He adds that \"it's a new universe set in the present day with a new concept for me and a new bunch of characters. It's been a long time since I got to do that, so that's really fun.\" It does?\n\nIt could always be some other new project that isn't Goners, but I don't think so. Even though I didn't watch \"Dollhouse\", I'm still a fan of Joss Whedon and want him to direct another movie, since it's been a long time (Serenity in 2005) and his feature projects all keep falling apart. Goners is listed as \"on the backburner at Universal,\" so let's hope it doesn't fall apart before we find out if it was the one she was even talking about."
