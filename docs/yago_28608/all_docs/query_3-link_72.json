        "text": "Not many movies can claim to possess a worldwide legion of fans immediately after debuting at a film festival . . . but Joss Whedon, and his army of Whedonites, play by different rules. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Avengers mastermind wrote and produced the Tribeca Film Festival entry In Your Eyes, and immediately after the film’s premiere on Sunday made the surprise announcement in the video above. If you missed the movie at Tribeca, you can watch it right now. Anywhere. For five measly bucks, via Vimeo.\n\nA film going from festival premiere to video on demand is not new—many, many independent films now find broad audiences without ever playing inside a theater. But a surprise VOD announcement, from the director of the third-biggest movie of all time, is still news. Whedon spent years as a cult phenomenon, struggling to keep his shows on the air and get his movies seen; he still may consider himself an indie director, spending his non-Marvel time adapting Shakespeare and shepherding small movies like In Your Eyes .\n\nThat combination of name-brand recognition and rambunctious spirit makes him the perfect person to experiment with a surprise VOD release—his name alone will get people to download a movie they know nothing about, requiring zero advertising dollars and maybe inspiring those viewers to check out another tiny title they can download directly to their laptops. The Tribeca Film Festival even has a few suggestions—festival premieres Beneath the Harvest Sky, The Bachelor Weekend, and Bright Days Ahead are all available now on iTunes.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe BlackStar Film Festival Has a Mission, and Plenty of Ambition\n\n“We always want to be at the vanguard,” says founder Maori Karmael Holmes. “We don’t want to replace the bigger festivals. We want to be nipping at the heels.”\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice Film Festival’s Artistic Director on the Boldest Films and Biggest Stars of the 2024 Lineup\n\nAlberto Barbera reveals how he made the Italian festival the hottest spot to debut a film—and how it will juggle having both Brad and Angelina on the carpet.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Trumpworld Is Coping With the Kamala Harris Boom\n\nIn just days, the vice president has raked in more than $100 million, scored countless endorsements, started a social media phenomenon, and secured enough delegates for the nomination. “She has been totally dominating,” marveled one GOP strategist.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nNews\n\nWhat Kamala Harris Means for Democrats’ Chances in Battleground States\n\n“She’s been like a defibrillator to the Democratic Party in this race.”\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry’s Calls to King Charles “Go Unanswered”\n\nThe monarch is reportedly no longer speaking to his younger son over Harry’s ongoing battle to secure enhanced security when he visits the UK."
