        "text": "\"Danny Says\" is a documentary about Danny Fields. That name may not ring a bell, but the names of Danny's associates ring enough bells to drown out a megachurch hand-bell choir.\n\nNot that you'd expect to hear many of these names during a congregation roll call: Danny Fields' associates have included Iggy Pop, Andy Warhol, Jim Morrison, Divine, Nico and the Ramones.\n\nDirected by Brendan Toller, \"Danny Says,\" which premiered in March at the South by Southwest Film Festival, will make its Memphis debut at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 22, at the Malco Studio on the Square, in a screening hosted by Goner Records. The event is free, but tickets should be picked up in advance at the Goner store at 2152 Young.\n\nThe screening was organized by Goner co-owner Zac Ives, who, before his association with Goner, worked as a young Rhodes College graduate in public relations and advertising in Washington. His clients included such movie production and distribution companies as Miramax, Fine Line Features and Sony Pictures Classics, and Ives has remained friends with some folks in the film business. His connections with Magnolia Pictures — the company that also distributes \"Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me,\" about the cult Memphis power-pop band, and Jim Jarmusch's new \"Gimme Danger,\" about Iggy and the Stooges — led to the Memphis booking of \"Danny Says.\"\n\n\"We just love being able to bring something like this into the Memphis market, and show people a really good movie,\" said Ives, 41. \"The role Danny Fields has had in all kinds of amazing bands in the '60s and '70s and '80s, and he's such a character, it just dovetails with all the things we love about music that's goofy and strange and loud and in your face.\"\n\nFields, who turned 77 on Nov. 13, is a sort of rock-and-roll Zelig, \"hippie yenta\" and punk-rock midwife whose decadeslong career in the music business encompassed everything from the avant-garde decadence of Andy Warhol's Factory to the manufactured innocence of the teenybopper magazine industry (he was editor at one time of \"16\").\n\nA straight-A student in Brooklyn as well as a Jewish homosexual attracted to artistic and \"outsider\" types, Fields — born Daniel Henry Feinberg — abandoned Harvard Law School for the arts scene of downtown New York, where he befriended such Warhol associates as Edie Sedgwick and the Velvet Underground and began writing about popular music, which gave him access to \"the smart and sexy and famous and brilliant and talented,\" as he says in the film.\n\nWorking for Elektra as the \"company freak,\" Fields fed LSD to an otherwise antagonistic Jim Morrison of The Doors, and was responsible for a coup (if not much of a recoup in the way of record sales) when he convinced the label to simultaneously sign two Detroit bands, the MC5 and the Stooges. Later, he was manager for the Ramones, who in 1979 recorded the tribute song \"Danny Says,\" which gives the movie its title.\n\nThe documentary is filled with vintage footage (including a brief bit with the late Leonard Cohen) and new interviews with the self-deprecating and amusing (for all his \"existential despair\") Fields, plus Iggy, Alice Cooper, Judy Collins, Lenny Kaye and others. It also touches on Memphis (complete with a relatively impressive animated rendition of the Downtown skyline, circa 1966) during a section about Fields' role in the infamous Beatles brouhaha that erupted after John Lennon's \"more popular than Jesus\" quote became known in America. According to the film, it was Fields who brought this previously overlooked comment to public attention when he pulled the quote from an old interview and splashed it across the cover of Datebook magazine, which he helped edit. The movie mentions that the quote inspired Klan protests of the Fab Four in \"the beloved city of Elvis and Sun Studios.\"\n\nFor more information, call 901-722-0095.\n\nJust a little 'Loving'\n\nI generally hesitate to make such pronouncements, but here goes:\n\n\"Loving\" may be just the movie America needs right now.\n\nOpening Friday on two screens at the Malco Ridgeway Cinema Grill, \"Loving\" is a drama about Richard and Mildred Loving (played, beautifully, by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga), a white man and black woman whose marriage — illegal in their home state of Virginia — led to a landmark 1967 Supreme Court decision that invalidated \"miscegenation\" laws forbidding interracial marriage and \"co-habiting.\" (And yes, \"Loving\" really was the surname of the reluctant heroes in this real-life love story.)\n\nThe film is the fifth feature in a decade from Arkansas-born writer-director Jeff Nichols, brother of Ben Nichols, the frontman of the Memphis-based rock band Lucero. A collaborator on most of his brother's projects, Ben Nichols wrote and performs the title song heard during the new movie's end credits.\n\nSimple and direct in its storytelling and emotional impact, \"Loving\" lacks the sense of the uncanny found in such past Nichols films as \"Taking Shelter\" and \"Midnight Special\" (released just eight months ago), but it may be Nichols' most assured and effective work to date. The mysteries here are mysteries of human nature.\n\nUnlike most movies about civil rights battles, \"Loving\" lacks violence, emotional outbursts and aggressive displays of racism; a brick is found, and it's a threat, but a brick is never thrown. The menace is mostly systemic, the courage mostly internal. The focus is on the monosyllabic Richard, a construction worker, and the patient Mildred, a mother of three by the time the couple's case comes to court, following their arrest and brief imprisonment in Virginia. They are presented as people of intelligence (if not scholarship) and dignity. They do not seek attention, much less celebrity; they are photographed by Life magazine, but they don't try to \"monetize\" their minor fame. \"I know we have some enemies, but we have some friends, too,\" Mildred says. \"We may lose the small battles but win the big war.\" These are inspiring words to hear at a moment in American history when racists are emboldened and bullying seems to have a seal of approval.\n\n\"Loving\" also reminds us that the federal government should be the champion of all its citizens — the underdog and the oppressed, not just the privileged. The Lovings get their day in court after Mildred Loving writes, by hand, a letter to then-Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy, who turns the case over to the American Civil Liberties Union. This is federal \"interference\" with moral as well as legal authority.\n\nFox gets more 'Feral'\n\nCreated by writer-director Morgan Jon Fox, the made-in-Memphis series \"Feral\" has been renewed for a second season on Dekkoo, a digital network and subscription streaming site (dekkoo.com) dedicated to content of special interest to gay audiences that launched in October 2015.\n\nFox said the second season episodes likely will shoot here in late spring or summer. He said he has an \"outline\" for the next eight episodes but has not scripted the programs yet. The original cast is expected to return, along with what Fox calls \"some prominent new characters.\"\n\nShot on a low budget, \"Feral\" follows several gay and straight young characters — artists, actors and other Midtown types — as they search for career and romantic fulfillment in and around Memphis while also battling the demons of drugs, jealousy and so on. Influenced in part by such HBO programs as \"Girls\" and \"Loving,\" the series is intended to be Dekkoo's addition to the exponentially expanding world of quality serial online content, and it has received appreciative attention, mostly in the gay press and in online publications dedicated to independent film. More important, that attention brought eyes to the Dekkoo platform, according to Brian Sokel, the company's chief operating officer.\n\n\"One we launched 'Feral,' we had a huge cycle of subscribers sign up,\" Sokel said. \"We actually saw an increase of our subscriber base of 30 percent because the show hit so well.\"\n\nIn other \"Feral\" news, the program's first season will be issued on DVD next year on the TLA Releasing label. A date has yet to be set, but it probably will appear in the spring."
