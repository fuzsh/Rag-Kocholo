The drug brings out their darkest fears and inner-demons as well as making one of the five unfortunate individuals homicidal and another suicidal as well as a father and daughter having their worst

in the bathroom of the Kendra Peters residence where her thoughts are told as a narrative before the film goes onto her, her Salesman boyfriend Gary Clarke, Accountant friend Jamie Mankara,his girlfriend teacher Miranda Noorm and Advertising Agent Clairboyant Darnvell.\n\nWe see them head off to their jobs and then the nights following their happy work day drinking up in a bar.\n\nThey are then informed the following day that they are to be fired, each one of them.\n\nRosaline upon being informed she is to be let go has her co-worker friend Kendra Peters up and quit accompanying Rose to the elevator to head out of the building.\n\nShe tells Rose she has been looking for an excuse to up and leave their horrible workplace for years.\n\nShe tells she is going to throw a party to celebrate her resignation and invites Rose to come along, bring her boyfriend and even some friends if she wants.\n\nRose then asks Gary, Jamie, Miranda and Clairboyant if they would like to come along to a party a co-worker friend of hers that up and quit work is having.\n\nGary states if Rose wishes to go he'll come along, Clairboyant says yes being the party one, Jamie at first says no however Miranda states why the hell not being in a drunken state already which makes Jamie decide to come along, on her behalf.\n\nThe group then come to the party and are befriended by Kendra's boyfriend Tate Hope and a strange man named Azrael.\n\nThe group also comes to meet a college professor Harold Lockwood and his 19 year old daughter Jennifer who are family friends with the Hopes.\n\nAzrael eventually is approached by Kendra who demands to know who he is claiming he wasn't invited to the party and isn't someone she knows.\n\nAzrael states he can explain and upon staring into Kendra's eyes hypnotizes her.\n\nHe then produces a white tablet and places it in her hand.\n\nAs he walks away Tate comes up to Kendra and asks who that was.\n\nShe answers dazily no idea and then as Tate turns to shake hands with two party-goers Kendra takes the tablet with a martini.\n\n19 year old Jennifer is then approached by Azrael as she is stealing alcohol from the bar and is given the tablet which she is told is ecstasy, she initially goes to refuse but as her father approaches quickly downs the tablet.\n\nAzrael then by means of hypnotism makes Harold take the tablet as well.\n\nWe then come to Rose and the others who come to Kendra to tell her they have really enjoyed her party and are gracious for the invitation but are going to leave who upon telling Kendra this are approached by the mysterious man Azrael.\n\nHe introduces himself and tells them he has something Kendra would like to leave them with before they depart.\n\nKendra then tells them it's a present for each of them for attending.\n\nMiranda drunk yells happily in regards to the presents but Rose says thank you but no thank you to Azrael.\n\nKendra grabs Rose's arm and says please, i spent the rest of my money from quitting work on these presents.\n\nRose then agrees as Miranda ushers her over to Azrael who tells them he left it in the house in the upstairs bedroom bathroom.\n\nThey go up there and are presented with five white tablets.\n\nRose and Gary seem repulsed and tell them that none of them are drug users.\n\nClairboyant agrees but looks guilty.\n\nJamie angrily tells Azrael that he is not giving his girlfriend drugs.\n\nMiranda calls Jamie a killjoy and wants one.\n\nHe tells them that the drug is ecstasy and Azrael attempts to hypnotize them into taking it.\n\nThe hypnosis works upon Gary and Jamie but not Rose to his astonishment.\n\nMiranda and Clairboyant take it voluntarily and Rose has it pushed down her mouth as Azrael hypnotizes Miranda into forcing the drug into Rose's mouth.\n\nAzrael then tells them to enjoy as the lights go out in the bathroom.\n\nWhen the lights come back on he is nowhere to be seen.\n\nFrom there the group and Kendra begin to hallucinate out their darknest phobias, inner-demons and problems.\n\nKendra is the first to succumb to the effects of the supernatural drug as she was the first to take it.\n\nShe sees her former neighbour who murdered his wife right in front of her.\n\nShe seems him as a ghastly black figure with yellow eyes out to get her.\n\nShe also sees hordes and hordes of large spiders everywhere representing the very spiders which surrounded her in the cupboard she was in when she witnessed her neighbour's murder.\n\nEventually she dies of a heart attack before the eyes of boyfriend Tate believing the ghastly monster form of her murderous male neighbour attacking her.\n\nStanding in front of their living room's glass coffee table she slips backwards and collapses upon the table, smashing it and having glass shards embedded into her back as she dies of cardiac arrest. visage of Kendra Peters.\n\nFollowing Kendra's funeral where the group freaks out they are brought in for questioning about a businessman who apparently attended the party, a shifty caucasian man mentioned as being seen by Tate Hope approaching Kendra, UCN Professor Harold Lockwood and his daughter and her and her friends.\n\nRose and the others describe the businessman and a sketch is made which shortly suddenly combusts and burns away.\n\nThe sketch artist and officers as well as the group can't seem to remember such a businessman by description and they are all let go for the time being.\n\nRose convinces Gary for the following day to go and see Professor Lockwood and his daughter as she has a really bad feeling something bad is going to happen to them.\n\nJamie with an agitated Miranda on heavy psychosis medication follow Rose and Gary to UCN and Clairboyant happens to have already came to the university himself and struck a flat outside.\n\nThere it is revealed that Professor Lockwood and his daughter Jennifer have been experiencing strange delusions.\n\nProfessor Lockwood of water as he almost drowned when he was his daughter's age swimming in a college race and Jennifer of loud noises as her sister who passed due to cancer would always wake her up in the morning by putting headphones on her turned up at full volume on music.\n\nJennifer is having an argument with her father and upon shoving him falls back into traffic and is run over by Tate Hope's car as she slides under and is hit by the front left tyre and back right tyre.\n\nThat night the seperate and do not speak, a news report tells the death of Kendra Peters and how her fiance Tate Hope had just earlier that day ran down 19 year old college youth Jennifer Lockwood.\n\nMiranda over the course of the day to that night becomes more rampant with her delusions of the insects burrowing beneath her skin and begins her horrific attempt at removing them.\n\nRose, Gary and Clairboyant come to see Professor Lockwood at his home and resusitate him from drowning on alcohol.\n\nThey discover he had attempted to drink himself to death as what he sees won't stop and now even worse his daughter is gone, it's his fault and now with the water drowning him all he sees is his daughter all broken swimming amongst it.\n\nJamie awakens to find Miranda missing and Clairboyant, Rose and Gary then witness Professor Lockwood die as he falls in his shed (they come into to get his car) onto a saw table and is cut through the chest.\n\nClairboyant then begins to break down and flees the scene.\n\nRose begins to hallucinate of blood, Professor Lockwood, Jennifer and Kendra as well as the rest of them dying.\n\nWe then come to Clairboyant and learn that he possessed an abusive father he killed in self-defence at age 11.\n\nHe succumbs to the supernatural drug and begins to hallucinate that everyone around him is his father out to get him.\n\nAt the same time he succumbs completely as does Miranda who is revealed to have lost an older sister Jessica many years ago who saved her from a chasm she fell into whilest on holiday with her family at age 6 in Norway.\n\nThe chasm contained starved scarab like insects which attacked her and attacked and killed her sister.\n\nShe begins to hallucinate that the insects which attacked her and killed her sister are beneath her skin eating away at her from the inside.\n\nShe begins to frantically scratch at her skin and then attempt to cut them out.\n\nShe comes to Clairboyant to have him kill her after she has disfigured herself and he hallucinates her face to be that of his father's. He then bashes her horribly and the hallucination she is his father fades and he realizes what he has done.\n\nClairboyant then heads to the top of his apartment as Rose, Gary and Jamie arrive at the building upon Miranda calling them.\n\nMiranda then after the call imagines a bug ripping forth out a wound and crawling up her bloody arm which leads her to scream which captures the attention of Jamie who runs forward to the apartment building as Clairboyant jumps forth off the apartment building roof and comes crashing down to his death before the eyes of Rose, Gary and Jamie.\n\nMiranda then stumbles out of the apartment into Jamie's arms covered in blood as sirens wail ahead signalling the police and paramedics are coming.\n\nWe then see paramedics take Miranda into an ambulance accompanied by Jamie and the body of Clairboyant being taken away on a stretcher.\n\nRose and Gary are interviewed by the police once again as reporters are being fended off by other officers in the background.\n\nThey demand to know what's going on, Kendra Peters who they attended the party of is approached by some man they can't describe, as was them, Professor Harold Lockwood and his daughter and now Miss Peters, Mr. Lockwood, his teenage daughter and their friend are all dead, under bizarre circumstances.\n\nThey recite the fact that Kendra Peters suddenly falls atop a glass coffee table after entering cardiac arrest and dies, Jennifer Lockwood begins to have a breakdown and steps into the path of Tate Hope's car and is smashed into, her father Harold Lockwood whilest there with him falls in his shed atop a table saw and their friend Clairboyant just decides to take a dive off a building.\n\nThey after having garnering no reply from Rose or Gary tell that their friend Miranda is in critical condition, that not only did she receive a severe beating from their swan dive friend Darnvell but she had a couple of hours pre Clairboyant's death hacked away at herself with a kitchen knife from Jamie Mankara's apartment.\n\nRose and Gary are told they won't be brought down to the station for questioning and are instead advised to go to the hospital and be there for their friend and should they find out anything, or better remember what the businessman looked like they contact them.\n\nRose tells she's a former co-worker of hers and a friend and Gary tells he met her at a party that Rose was invited to.\n\nThe officer informs she died last night before the eyes of her boyfriend Tate Hope of an apparent heart attack and only a day prior was suffering horrible hallucinations and disillusions of an old neigbour of hers out to get her along with hordes of spiders.\n\nWe then come to Miranda in hospital who is left unattended for awhile by her doctor and nurses who discuss Miranda's injuries and delusions she's having with Jamie outside.\n\nMiranda then has hallucinations of the bugs pouring out of her wounds again in her hospital bed.\n\nHer screaming summons Jamie, The Doctor and nurses back to the room.\n\nUpon Jamie apporaching her she tells him to take her out of here.\n\nThe doctor and nurses restrain and transquilize Miranda.\n\nWe then see Rose and Gary track down the man Azrael who gave them the strange drug which has caused Clairboyant and Kendra to die.\n\nHe is occupying a small apartment within a close radious to all of them: including Kendra.\n\nThey confront him about the drug and demand to know what they gave him and threaten him with going to the cops.\n\nHe tells them that mere mortal officers won't be able to stop him which confuses Rose and Gary.\n\nGary then furthermore threatens Azrael and then by telekinesis they are flung back and forth across the apartment: destroying nearly all the furniture inside.\n\nAzrael then reveals to the two he is a demon and the little drug he provided them with is indeed a supernatural ampthetamine designed to bring out their inner-demons and prompt a grisly demise so he may claim their souls.\n\nHe then tells how them and their little group of friends are definitley the juiciest souls he's got as of yet.\n\nHe then tells them that they might want to focus on the pretty blonde friend of their's and her little boyfie.\n\nWe then come to Jamie who begins to succumb to the drug and steals Miranda and her hospital bed rushing it out of the hospital out to his van.\n\nHe drives off her with her to his fishing cabin in the woods outside of the city.\n\nRose and Gary then come to the hospital to meet them where they meet with the detectives from before who tell they have fled.\n\nGary then tells Rose of a fishing cabin which has been in Jamie's family for about 30 years and is in the woods on the outskirts of town.\n\nWe then go through three days of Miranda's further advancing insanity as Gary and Rose assemble with her and Jamie at the cabin and Jamie succumbs completely to the drug which makes him take on the traits of his schitzophrenic murderous brother.\n\nThe film ends with Jamie coming to kill Rose, Gary and Miranda and Miranda asking him to kill her after she once again cuts herself up trying to get to the insects inside.\n\nHe kills her by splashing boiling water from a kettel in the cabin's kitchen upon her which makes her face and upper torso melt away.\n\nJamie then fatally stabs Gary in the throat with a butcher's knife rendering him to the ground and knocks Rose to the ground of a doorway where he proceeds to bash a door against her head until he believes she's dead.\n\nShe however springs up and seizes Gary's gun which she uses to shoot Jamie in the back and chest killing him.\n\nShe then holds Gary as he bleeds to death in her arms.\n\nShe leaves by canoe before the paramedics and police come and heads to the Peters residence where she comes to the upstairs bathroom.\n\nWe then see Azrael walking outside Rose's business building where he comes across a man who has been fired leaving a building with his work-stuff.\n\nHe drops his stuff after cursing and then is approached by Azrael who extends a hand and then walks him away.\n\nThe man comes to an intersection and Azrael parts ways leaving in his hand a single white tablet, as the man opens his hand and looks down at it we see Jennifer Lockwood's group of college friends opening their hands and looking down at their own individual white tablets, Rose's sister Viviene and damaged Tate Hope finding in their mailboxes envelopes containing the white tablets with a note reading \"Don't You Want To Know What Happened To Her?\"\n\nThe film then ends.\n\nCast\n\nVanessa Ferlito as District Attorney Rosaline Watson\n\nAlex Pettyfer as Salesman Gary Clarke\n\nShia LaBeouf as Accountant Jamie Mankara\n\nEd Helms as

In The Woods, which he penned the screenplay of along with fellow Buffy The Vampire Slayer writer Drew Goddard who directed the Cabin in The Woods.\n\nWishing to helm the director's chair and the screenplay himself for a horror film he bagn to spitball ideas for another horror film.\n\nIdeas came of a haunting movie came to mind, but wishing to come up with something which was as different and genre bending as the Cabin.\n\nHe then deliberated and settled on August 11th, 2012 with Goners; a film dealing with protagonists who become maddened by a demonic virus of sorts which bends with their minds and corrupts them with their own buried own psychological demons.\n\nThe film's draft script was completed on September 4th, and the film went into immediate greenlight production on September 10th and began shooting in Toronto, Ontario on September 16th, 2012.\n\nFilming wrapped on March 24th, 2013 and Post-Production closed on March 30th, 2013.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on April 10th to critical praise and audience acclaim.\n\nThe film's high budget went towards to central costumes, hiring out the large locations and areas for shooting and highest of all to the effects which were more practically done then visually.\n\nThe only visual sequences were done in the climatic hotel kitchen sequence with the death of Miranda Noorm.\n\nCasting\n\nJoss Whedon had auditions held for each character apart from Clairboyant Darnvell, which was a closed audition reserved for actor Kal Penn upon ultimatley deciding on the said character's ethnicity.\n\nThe other characters which had actors in mind were contacted to audition and came in, nearly every single one securing the role that Whedon had envisioned them in.\n\nFor the role of Rosaline Watson Whedon not only had voluptous Death Proof actress Vanessa Ferlito in mind but also Shailene Woodley, Emma Stone and Nina Dobrev.\n\nPremiere\n\nA premiere screening for the film was held at the Los Angeles Film Festival attended by the following collective of celebrities and the cast and crew of Goners:\n\nAmanda Plummer\n\nAnna Hutchison\n\nJesse Williams\n\nChad Michael Murray\n\nElisha Cuthbert\n\nKristen

Mabley\n\nNina Conti\n\nChristopher Guest\n\nBehind The Scenes\n\nActress Amanda Seyfried was instructed in all her scenes apart from the party and climax scenes to have her hair up and not down, as under Whedon's instruction a way of promoting her intelligence, maturity and virtue\n\nThe character of Clairboyant Darnvell in early pre-production was the only character not given a direct ethinicity, Whedon had it jotted down as he would be either an African-American, Indian or Asian character. He first decided on an African-American character hoping to call in actor Jesse Williams for the part but scrapped that idea after realizing audiences would associate him with Whedon's previous popular horror debut The Cabin In The Woods. He in consideration of making the character asian thought of Harold & Kumar star John Cho but then quickly on thought of the film remembered actor Kal Penn whom he worked with on Buffy the Vampire Slayer & it's spin-off Angel. The character was then scripted as a fast talking Indian American character.\n\nDespite the character Clairboyant Darnvell being the comic relief for the film he is the fourth character to be killed under the blood infection of the demon Azrael\n\nJoss Whedon went through the Kings Of Hell, Dante's Inferno and Purgatory and Paradise Lost in search for the ideal demonic antagonist behind the character's insanity drives. He had originally even settled on the concept of making Satan the antagonist but thought that to be too stereotypical and the fact that the antagonist is just a mere demon of hell makes the idea of Satan more menacing and frightening.\n\nWhedon originally thought Helms was not right for the part of the demon Azrael but after four auditions over a span of three months he saw a belayed charm similiar to the one Wolf Creek antagonist Mick Taylor bestows and that lures victims into the sheer, cruel horror he inflicts.\n\nThe idea of the climax was originally scripted for an abandoned warehouse which was meant to be renovated into a restaurant and had the restaurant set-up at the back but this didn't work in with the film's storyline so Whedon changed the ending locale to a cabin in the woods, an idea he strongly not wanted to do but after doing so had no regrets.\n\nActors Pettyfer and Kendrick were chosen after being seen in particular films which Whedon immensley enjoyed: Pettyfer for Beastly and Kendrick for her Oscar Nominated role in the film Up In the Air (despite the fact her character has striking personality similiarities to her character Stacy Pilgrim in Scott Pilgrim Vs.
