        "text": "“Wolf Creek” is a good horror movie, not nearly a great one.\n\nBut the first 50 minutes of this Outback outrage, released on DVD this week for $29.95, offer an intriguing primer on the rules horror films often follow to mesmerize willing audiences.\n\nFirst, we have young, beautiful people with too much privilege and not enough responsibility. In “Wolf Creek’s” case, an Australian guy (Nathan Phillips) and two British gals (Cassandra Magrath and Kestie Morassi) are partying on the beaches before embarking on a road trip across western Australia.\n\nSecond, we must have threatening locals. At their first stop on the trip, our young victims are taunted in a cafe, and when the huge yokel snarls, “See you later, sweetheart!” he’s talking to the guy, not the girls. Slasher-movie fans know these locals may show up later, or may simply be a red herring meant to increase tension.\n\nLocal legends should come into play. Here, Wolf Creek is a hike to an ancient meteorite crater in an arid national park, said to hold mysterious powers. When the rambunctious kids get back to their car after the hike, two of their watches have stopped at the same time.\n\nA threat from nature usually enters at this point. Though this Outback stretch is dry as a bone, a chilling rain makes our campers anxious for shelter.\n\nWe must be manipulated into fleeting feelings that our victims may deserve whatever fate they are in for, by being stupid, incompetent or ungrateful. People who can’t fix their own cars rarely do well in “Wolf Creek,” or any other terrifying neighborhood.\n\nFinally, it always helps for some of the action to take place at a location or in a building long since abandoned by “regular” people. This lends an underlying dread: If others couldn’t make a go of it on this spot, what in Crocodile Dundee’s name are we doing here?\n\nWriter-director Greg McClean does a nice job of touching the bases of these rules through nearly an hour. His characters’ wandering through alluring but desolate Australia has a pace that brings to mind Peter Weir’s spooky “Picnic at Hanging Rock.”\n\nMcClean’s work is amplified nicely by John Jarratt as a gregarious bushman who offers the stranded hikers his help. “Mick” plays to the audience’s natural affection for hearty Australian stereotypes, then stands those assumptions on their (detached) heads. Now that’s a knife.\n\nThe delicious mood deteriorates into more pedestrian slasher fare, but the long setup is worth watching. It’s fun to see a director play by the pop-culture rules, and win.\n\nStaff writer Michael Booth can be reached at 303-820-1686 or mbooth@denverpost.com.\n\nNEW ON DVD\n\nBreakfast on Pluto *** Kitten Braden isn’t naive. She simply chooses to ignore all the meanness, in the form of “serious, serious, serious” people, and live her life in a parallel world of golden trinkets and sugary pop songs. That she is actually a he is almost beside the point. Played with astonishing confidence and touching openness by Cillian Murphy, Kitten was never meant to be “Patrick.” Doubt, anger, indignation and shame are alien words, and Kitten will have none of them. This is the fully formed world of “Breakfast on Pluto,” Irish director Neil Jordan’s return to transvestites and Irish terrorism. In Murphy’s and Jordan’s smooth hands, Kitten is a wonder to behold. R; 135 minutes (Michael Booth)\n\nHostel * It’s hard not to wonder about the homonym implied in the title. Hostel. Hostile. Seeing Eli Roth’s flick about two young, fairly ugly Americans in an Eastern European hostel, this echo no longer feels accidental. This second feature from writer-director Roth, who gave us the visually impressive “Cabin Fever, takes us someplace cruel – and deeply unfunny. Just because that’s Roth’s intention doesn’t mean his movie is any good, though it is stylish. “Hostel” briefly looks like it may become an interesting if brutal fable: a Hansel-and-Hansel journey into a malevolent wood. Yet Roth discovers in the thicket of scary gypsy kids, duplicitous hotties and winsome Japanese tourist gals a film of sadistic gestures. R; 105 minutes (Lisa Kennedy)\n\nMrs. Henderson Presents *** Judi Dench can summon a glare that could sink a thousand ships. How wonderful, then, to see Dench smile, giggle and cackle her way through this pleasing British bauble set in the London theater. The great Bob Hoskins is her foil, and the pleasure of this movie is watching two of the grandest British lions taking their talents for a long walk. R; 102 minutes (Michael Booth)"
