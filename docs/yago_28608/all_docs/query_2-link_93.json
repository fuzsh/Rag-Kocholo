        "text": "Conflicting work schedules would always be the bane of Izuku’s and Katsuki’s existence. It’d been too many patrolling night shifts or early-morning class prep for either of them to find the time to care for each other as intimately as they used to. It went from hardcore, hour long lovemaking to quick touches and too short orgasms in the span of three months as Izuku returned back to teaching after the summer break and could no longer accommodate Katsuki's frantic pro-hero schedule.\n\nIt was, quite frankly, the worst torture Katsuki had ever felt in a long time and that was saying a lot considering he’d been tortured countless times. Both physically, mentally and emotionally and now, at the lovely age of twenty five, sexually . And not in the fun, haha, BDSM, choke me way but the ‘oh fuck, I want you inside me so bad but I can’t have you’ way that made his nerves grate and teeth grind as he tried to get off all by himself and failed. His hand, though warm and more than capable, felt nowhere near as good as Izuku’s large, knobbed hands with their rough callouses and scars despite how frigid they sometimes were due to his terrible circulation. His fingers weren’t as thick as Izuku’s, just a bit longer and it made him just all the more desperate when doing it alone to have him there. To bend him to the point his body could take the sensitivity and pleasure he gave him.\n\n“Kacchan, I’m marking papers here baby, c’mon.” Which led Katsuki to his current predicament, trying to get his hot teacher of a boyfriend to fuck him the one time he had an afternoon free on a Saturday. Izuku had been mulling over test scores Friday night, and now papers all morning, on the one day Katsuki was able to stay at home before his shift the following Sunday. Wrapping his arms around his shoulders from behind, he pressed soft kisses behind his ear. “Kacchan..”\n\n“C’mon, mark them later, I want you.” Katsuki mumbled, sliding his hands down Izuku’s abdomen and then back up his chest, gripping beneath his pecs even through the shirt, wrinkling it between his hands. His lips trailed down the back of his neck, curving up into a smirk at the quiet hum Izuku let out, tipping his head back in content. Izuku’s rough hand tangled into his spiky hair, softly brushing it back down the nape of his neck before lacing his fingers through it. He almost thought he was getting what he wanted until there was a light pull, taking his lips away from that skin he so very desired to claim.\n\n“I said no, Kacchan. We can do that later, I need to finish this if you want me to patrol with you and the others tomorrow, I can’t fall behind.” He let him go, picking up the pen he’d dropped as he re-situated himself into his seat.\n\n“Fine, sensei, mark your papers instead of me.” Katsuki sassed, voice dripping with displeasure as he pulled away from him. But not before he felt his skin heat and watched as freckles popped out against now reddened cheeks. Izuku went stiff, a subtle inhale breaking through the shot of silence. In the time it took Izuku to formulate an answer, Katsuki was already making a plan to get what he so desperately wanted out of him.\n\n“What was that?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n༺ ♰ ༻\n\nIt had to be timed perfectly. Over the span of the next few weeks, Katsuki tested out his little theory by using that name every now and then to see how Izuku reacted. If he were coming on patrol, he’d tease, “Hey Sensei, we need hero Deku right now.” and watch how he nearly stumbled over his own cape. Or, before he went off to UA, when giving him his goodbye kiss and adjusting his tie he’d whisper “have a good day, sensei.” before ushering him outside and locking the door to their apartment.\n\nHe could tell it did something to him, it itched something in Izuku’s brain that made him blush so madly. Katsuki knew he liked it, which was lovely because he started to like saying it to tease him. It was a sinful thing, hell they used to call Aizawa sensei and they still did but this was different. Something about calling Izuku that, a name of prestige, elder and power, made butterflies swarm in his stomach. An embarrassing fact, but true.\n\nKatsuki never wanted to fuck his teachers let him be clear, he never found them attractive like that so he never really liked the student x teacher dynamic until Izuku became one and something dark in his brain wanted to be seventeen again, asking Sensei Midoriya to help him with his papers. It was depraved. It was wrong. It was sexy . And he knew Izuku had a similar thought as him, because just a day earlier he’d seen him fawning over Katsuki’s old UA uniform.\n\nKatsuki thought he’d left that at his mothers, or put it in storage amongst his old costume prototypes, so how Izuku got a hold of it was beyond him but he could tell he brought it up for a reason. He knew his brain, how Izuku obsessed over something until it spiraled out of control, so it would make sense this new kink or fetish or whatever the hell this was dug into his thoughts and he couldn’t let it go either. He’d said so innocently. “Hey, Kacchan, do you think this would still fit you?”\n\nAnd though Katsuki shot him down, barking something about “of course not, that was seven years ago!” He did think about wearing it. And he had worn it, when Izuku wasn’t home of course. It barely fit him, he’d grown a lot after all, but it fit him enough to do what he wished in it which was getting Izuku Midoriya, hero Deku, and Sensei-Deku of UA to fuck him in it.\n\nSo, he’d waited for a day he knew Izuku worked overtime, when all the students and most of the teachers would be gone from the school and near the dorms, or their own homes. It took everything in him to not initiate contact before then, using the nickname sparingly or not at all after confirming his suspicions and stringing Izuku along all the while. He wanted to make sure he was extra pent up.\n\nIf Izuku nearly slamming him into a wall with his hands trying to shove up his shirt when he kissed him served as any indication, it was working, and Katsuki would continue to bat him off saying he had work and they couldn’t do anything that’d hinder his performance until finally he got a weekday half-off; leaving early.\n\nDisguised, he’d made his way into UA, nodding at the teachers he’d seen leaving and even greeting Aizawa on his way through the halls. Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight was always welcome, after all. “Looking for the problem child?”\n\nAdjusting the collar of his hero suit, far too hot in all these layers to disguise the true purpose of this meeting, Katsuki nodded. “Yeah, the idiots been working too many long hours, I’m here to take him to dinner so he doesn’t starve himself trying to mark those shitty papers.”\n\nMore like serve him dinner, but Aizawa looked disgusted at even this simple form of intimacy between his old students as if he didn’t have a husband himself. “Well, while you’re here try and get him to be a little stricter with his students.” He pat Bakugou's shoulder, forever proud of his and Izuku’s development as individuals and partners nonetheless.\n\nIt was a shame Aizawa was praising him when he was about to defile one of UA’s precious desks and prized alumni, it almost made Katsuki feel guilty as he murmured. “Of course I will.” Because he knew the only strictness Izuku would be giving his students would be what he’d give Katsuki once he bent over his desk. Dressed as one of his students.\n\nBidding farewell soon after, Katsuki found himself outside of Izuku’s classroom. Like he’d hoped, no other staff was inside as they went to get dinner or see kids, or do other things unlike his perfectionist Izuku who wanted his marking to reflect how highly he thought of his students with the right amount of constructive criticism and ensure that his classroom was impeccably clean (something he’d learned from Kacchan). Even the shitty kids got told five things they did well before being obliterated in the final two points on how shit they were; but that was just Katsuki paraphrasing what he’s seen.\n\nQuietly, he closed the door behind him and peeked back. There was a narrow little window that let people see into his class through the door but, considering the halls were empty save for a stray teacher or two, Katsuki was willing to risk it. It was late, nearing golden hour and within an hour it’d be dark outside.\n\nLight bled in through the windows and cast a shine over Izuku’s room and his desk, illuminating where he stood wiping his chalkboard. He looked heavenly in that suit, the blazer thrown over his chair but the white dress-shirt clinging to his back and highlighting every shift of muscle in those broad shoulders. Even after losing his quirk he never skipped out on training, often following Katsuki or Ochako (or sometimes the both of them, considering the two had an odd but sweet friendship) to the gym. He’d grown into a fine young man, shedding some of his baby fat but still holding that young face, with his chipmunk cheeks and messy nest of green hair. His body was primed as if he still held One for All and his pure raw strength alone could get Katsuki weak in the knees.\n\n“Sensei Midoriya?” He called out as he shed off his hero suit, placing it aside on one of the desks by the door, but leaving his combat boots on beneath the half-raised slacks of his old UA uniform pants. They were a bit tight on him, his pecs pushing up against the buttoned fabric and the red tie done loosely at his neck, his pants raised up a bit near the ankles and tight on his hips and thighs. He was aware he’d had slimmer legs as a teenager, they’d filled out more now in muscle and height but didn’t compare to the beast of thighs that were his boyfriends.\n\nIzuku could crush goddamned watermelons between those thighs. But at the moment, he merely looked up at Katsuki and choked . The cloth he’d been using, to clean up the residuals of the chalk after using the eraser, dropped from his hands and he didn’t even bother stumbling for it. Wide emerald eyes bore into Katsuki as he floundered like a goddamn fish, heat rising to his face so fast as he staggered back. “Kacchan?”\n\nHiding a smirk, he smiled, walking forwards. His boots seemed to echo in the empty classroom at the silence that ensued, Izuku seemingly holding his breath as he gripped the side of his desk for some semblance of balance. He couldn’t take his eyes off of him. No matter how much older Katsuki was, he still looked young and nearly identical to how he had as a teenager, his blond hair falling into his eyes and his uniform hanging off of him as if he were too cool to wear it properly. He was stunning, gorgeous, everything and more and Izuku felt a rush go straight to his dick when he bent down to pick up the cloth he dropped and said in the sweetest voice he’d ever heard him use. “Need help, Sensei?”\n\nA breathy groan stifled in Izuku’s throat, tilting his head to him as he looked him over once then again, slower. The heat of his gaze wasn’t lost on him, he could practically hear the gears in Midoriya’s brain working overtime. “What?”\n\n“Well, you were looking at me all of class, I figured you wanted to talk? But you’re busy, so I wouldn’t want to interrupt.” He grinned somewhat, leaning a hip against the side of the chalkboard as he dropped the cloth back into his hands. Izuku glanced at it as if it offended him, he’d rather be touching warm, smooth skin that he knew was hidden beneath that uniform. Katsuki had even worn the blazer and it was fitted over him but left unbuttoned. Loosening his own tie somewhat, the action making the latter blush as thick fingers unbundled the fabric at his neck in a manner that shouldn’t be sexy but was, he played along.\n\n“You seem to know every answer but weren’t participating. You mouthed off with all the other students during my lesson and caused a distraction, Bakugou, of course I was looking at you. Your grades were impeccable but now suddenly they’re dropping in my class. All your other teachers say that you're passing theirs with flying colours and yet, in mine, you’re nearing the edge of failing.” Izuku needed to sit down, feeling light headed. Not only was he pent up, as per Kacchans plan, but now he was in unfamiliar waters with a kink he didn’t even know he had until his hot childhood friend dared to utter that name. Midoriya Sensei, Sensei .\n\nLet it be clear, with his students it was a way to address him, did nothing but make him raise his head especially since they all mostly used Deku -sensei but with Kacchan it felt sinful . It felt like he’d called him something so high in power, placing him above himself, and liked it. With Kacchan it was like he was put in charge, and that was a rare thing with his childhood friend to do. And, simply, with Kacchan everything just felt the more good. He could call him a litany of deprecating things but if it were his voice, came from his mouth, with that perfect smile he made when he looked at him then Izuku was a goner.\n\n“It’s not like your class is hard, I just find it difficult to focus.” Katsuki rolled his eyes, and he committed wholly to the role after hearing his surname that it just made that flame in Izuku’s stomach burn brighter as he sat down in his desk-chair, unbuttoning his cuffs before rolling up his sleeves slowly. Bakugou felt his throat run dry at the action, each slow roll exposing more of scarred and well defined forearms. If Izuku felt a flame, Katsuki felt a goddamned forest fire with how he wanted those hands on him, arms around him with that goddamned forearm pinning his neck down like a wild animal.\n\nHe was already hard and it was painfully obvious with the tightness of his slacks but Izuku didn’t draw attention to it, keeping his eyes raised to Katsuki’s own as he articulated slowly. He was choosing his words carefully to play into whatever act they were doing. And, subconsciously or not, he was using his teacher's voice and that just made Katsuki all the more hot. He wanted to loosen his collar, or get on his knees, or- or- “Bakugou, that is no excuse. You evade any type of help, avoiding me and your peers' attempts to aid you, it’d be endearing if it weren’t hindering your skills. Your pride to do it all on your own is setting you back, group assignments are even more subpar than your individual ones in other classes. If you keep this up I’d have no choice but to get Principal Nezu or your parents involved. Mrs.Bakugou didn’t seem to enjoy your last report.”\n\nNow it was Katsuki’s turn to blush, heat rising up the back of his neck. Izuku was using a similar problem he actually had in first year: peer collaboration. God, that was embarrassing as was his sudden mention of his parents; he almost felt as if it were real in the serious tone he was using. Resting his palm against the desk, he leaned over where he sat, shrugging his other arm. “The hag gets it, dealing with extras ain't exactly easy especially when they’re so far below me. I don’t like working with others, Midoriya-Sensei, let alone with some old man who just got this far due to connections with All Might.”\n\nLike he wanted, Izuku’s eyes darkened at the jab, the insinuation he hadn’t rightfully earned his place by some student who could barely pass his class. Infuriating. “You shouldn’t speak so low of others, Bakugou.”\n\n“And you shouldn’t think so highly of yourself, you old pervert.”\n\n“W-what?!” Izuku’s eyes widened and he nearly broke character at those words alone, cheeks turning a darker red. Smirking, Katsuki leaned forwards, grabbing him by his tie and resting one leg up on his chair, knee between Izuku’s thighs as he yanked him forwards.\n\nNose to nose, he murmured. “Don’t think I don’t know you ain’t marking me hard cause you want me to stay after class to look at me more. Even during class your eyes are all over me. I don’t see why you’re calling me Bakugou as if you haven’t been yapping Kacchan, Kacchan behind my back to Aizawa-sensei and the others. You think I’m dumb?”\n\n“N-no! Of course not, Ka- Bakugou but what exactly are you insinuating?” He waved his hands in front of himself, grabbing his wrist to try and pull away but Katsuki tugged him forwards again. Izuku hunched forwards, glancing down at the knee pressed dangerously close to his crotch and then up at him. Katsuki wound the fabric of his tie slowly around his hand, shortening the space between them with each roll as he spoke.\n\n“Say it, you can say Kacchan. I know that's the name you’ve been jerking off to. You think I don’t watch you too? You’re obvious as hell, Sensei .” Izuku’s hips canted forwards on instinct and he could feel his erection pressing against his leg, eyes lidded as he gasped softly. He was so close Izuku could smell caramel, the brown sugar and smokey scent that always permeated off of his skin. He could practically taste it with how close their lips were. “You want me?”\n\n“Want.. you?” He whispered, fingers twitching as he skimmed his hand up Katsuki’s calf, earning a soft smack on his hand to get him off before he roughly gripped Izuku’s chin.\n\n“Yeah, want me. Wanna fuck me, you dirty old pervert? Let's say it’s to make up for my grades if it makes you feel better but you and I both know my grades are goddamned perfect and you don’t care if I play well with others. You just needed an excuse for us to talk.” He swung a leg over Izuku’s lap, straddling him as he sat down. Izuku fucking jolted , grabbing the arms of the office chair and throwing his head back with another heady gasp, breaths hitching as he met his eyes with so much desire it almost made Katsuki fold. Almost.\n\nFeet skimming the floor, he moved back and forth a bit in his lap to get comfortable, smirking at how Izuku tipped his head back against his chair and closed his eyes, trying to bite his tongue. It felt good, it felt so good having him grind down on him, resting all his weight on his thighs, his ass pressing against his dick firmly as he felt Katsuki’s own arousal against his stomach. And it felt wrong in this context, in his fucking classroom of all things. “We shouldn’t be doing this, Ba-”\n\n“Kacchan. Say it, call me Kacchan.” Katsuki brushed their noses, smiling at how Izuku tilted his head into it easily, not once taking his eyes off of him. “You wanna kiss me, then call me by the name you gave me, old man.”\n\n“Kacchan..” He murmured.\n\n“Good Sensei, now you can kiss me.” He grinded slowly on top of him, his free hand sliding down Izuku’s chest, bunching in his shirt as he brushed their lips. His thighs squeezed around his sides when those large hands finally found their place onto his body, holding beneath his ass to lift him up more against him. Tugging on the loose, practically open fabric of Katsuki’s red tie, Izuku pulled him down into a kiss.\n\nIt was warm, searing, and holding that love that he knew Izuku was dying to communicate even when playing a role. His lips moved slowly against his own, fingers lacing into the soft baby hairs at the nape of Katsuki’s neck as he lightly pulled, guiding him into deepening the kiss. Warmth bloomed from his lips, down his neck into his very fingertips until Izuku nipped his bottom lip and tugged lightly. “Mm~ Getting ahead of yourself, sensei.”\n\nHe pulled back, unbuttoning Izuku’s shirt to skim his hands down his chest, his abdomen, whispering. “All that protest and you’re down after a kiss? After your student gets in your lap? That’s fucking pathetic .” He undid his belt, reaching into Izuku’s pants to free his prize: his dick. Wrapping his hand around it, he slowly stroked upwards, thumb skimming the head and smirking at the pre that already dribbled up the tip and tried leaking down the shaft.\n\n“N-no.. you’re- Kacchan-” He stammered, arching up as he held his thighs tightly now, stuck between pulling him closer and pushing him off. He throbbed in his hands at the degradation, heated and leaking and desperate . Katsuki was grinding against his thighs slowly, rocking back and forth as he jerked him off at a painful pace of barely there touch. His palm glided up and down the hard length of his dick, thumb rubbing soft circles into the veins of his shaft and each time he got to the tip he gave a light squeeze that made Izuku feel light headed.\n\n“C’mon sensei, touch me. You have me where you want me, so touch me. Don’t act like you’re above this. You wanna fuck your student so goddamn bad it hurts, doesn’t it? How much have you thought about bending me over your desk and taking me?” He moved his hand a little faster, lips seeking the bare and exposed skin of his neck when his head tipped back. He nipped softly at the unmarred, freckled skin, tongue laving up to his jawline before sucking softly against it.\n\nHis hands were everywhere, all at once, pulling Katsuki in by his hips, gripping his ass, kneading the muscles in both hands and dragging his fingers over the seam of his pants. Then his fingers were at his chest, ripping off the offending red tie and cupping beneath those plush pecs which were almost spilling out of his shirt. He muttered quietly, burying his face between them and inhaling deeply. “So much. So, so much you don’t understand, Kacchan. Wanted to press you down on my- hah.. On my desk, under it even. Have you tend to me there, stay there as I- I-”\n\nA broken, shuddering breath left him when Katsuki grinded forwards, pressing his chest up against Izuku’s face as he gave a particularly hard twist of his hand around the base of his cock. He impossibly felt him thicken even more in his grasp, already eight inches and heavy in his hands. Izuku’s always been a grower and a shower, much to his chagrin. “As you get your rocks off? During class? Have you no shame, sensei.”\n\n“I do.. I- God~” He groaned, bucking up when he spit lewdly over his dick before slicking it up the sides, pumping him at a faster, firmer rhythm to get him bucking up into his touch. “God, fuck, Kacchan- Kacchan, let me-”\n\n“Not yet.” He murmured. He kissed down his chest, biting rough and possessive at his collarbone, his pec. “Use your hands on me. I got ready for you, sensei~”\n\nAnother stifled, hitched groan rumbling deep in his throat as his hands dipped into the waistband of Katsuki’s pants, fingers hitting the jeweled base of a plug that he’d bought for him. “You’re perfect.” He groused, lips brushing his ear as he whispered. “Perfect, hot, god Kacchan, you’re so fucking hot.” He eased two fingers around the plug, circling slowly before tugging lightly, feeling how Katsuki drew in a breath, wrapping his free arm around his neck as he pushed his hips back as the other hand continued to pump at his dick. “Did all this for me?”\n\n“Yes, sensei.” His voice sounded so innocent it was downright debauched with the way his thighs trembled, squeezing again at his sides as he began rocking into the shallow thrusts of the plug in and out of him. Twisting it gently, Izuku pulled it out, feeling the slick wetness of the lube he’d used coating his fingers, making a mess of the inside of his boxers and soon those cute little pants. Midoriya was at his limit within minutes of sinking his fingers into him, grinding two of them in slowly, feeling how Katsuki trembled so deep inside when he rubbed his prostate, breathes hitching and body rocking desperately back against his hand. It’d been too long for them both. Every push of his fingers felt like a goddamn lightning bolt.\n\n“Please, please-” Izuku mumbled, babbling suddenly, voice low as his brows furrowed. He tossed his head back slowly, grasping at Katsuki’s waist with a strength that felt almost bruising to his hips even now with his power gone; having to look up at him due to their height difference even now, his pro hero forever the taller of the two. Yet, obediently he kept his hips in place on his office chair, waiting to be allowed. “Hah~ fuck, fuck, please I can’t take it anymore. Katsuki- I need to fuck you. Let me fuck you. Please.”\n\nIzuku whined quietly when Katsuki took his hand away, dark evergreen eyes staring up at him. He was holding back, letting him be in charge but he was close to his limit. Smirking, he got off of his lap, kicking his chair back so he skidded away from him a bit before bending over Izuku’s desk, resting his chin in hand casually as he looked back at him. “Nasty old pervert, come on then. Fuck me.”\n\nHe surged forwards so fast the chair knocked back against the wall as Izuku finally got his hands on him, shoving his pants down his thighs carelessly and lifting him up more onto his desk. “I’m not that old, Kacchan.” He mumbled, but it was all that more arousing.\n\n“You are to me, Deku. You’re my teacher.” He pressed back, groaning with a faint laugh tacking onto the end as he felt him finally, finally press the tip of his cock against him. Pressing his hands flat onto the table, forearms bracing themselves he murmured. “And you’re about to fuck me on the desk you use to teach. No use playing the moral card~”\n\n“Shut up, Kacchan.” He teased as he wasted no time in easing forwards, wrapping a hand around Katsuki’s neck to tilt his head back, pressing their lips together in a softer, more deliberate kiss, swallowing the hitched gasps and breathy moan he made when he sunk in fully. He could see his own hands turning white at the knuckles as he gripped the edge of the table, his lips trembling against Izuku’s own as that addictive rush and searing heat at being completely filled overtook him. His thighs pressed together, the tips of his boots pressing against the floor as he grinded back against him, only for the latter to jerk forwards roughly.\n\n“Oh- Fu-uck. Yes. Fuck, yeah, fuck me sensei. Fuck me.” Katsuki buried his face into his own arms, hiding the flush of arousal on his own face as he bit into his bottom lip.\n\n“Can’t do that with your legs closed, can I?” Izuku murmured, holding beneath one of his knees as he slid forwards, resting one arm around his partner's trim waist as he hooked the other beneath his leg. He reared back before bucking up roughly, earning a strained cry that tapered off into a content hum, Katsuki’s hands sliding down his forearms to grip his wrists. His back arched up against that perfect chest, throwing his head back against Izuku’s shoulder. “That’s it, let me see that face. Let me see how you’re reacting. You can call me all the names you want if I can see that pretty face, Kacchan.”\n\n“Fuck, baby..” He inhaled sharply when Izuku bucked up again, holding onto his wrists tighter, lacing their fingers with the hand against his waist, feeling it graze up his chest. His lips dragged over his jaw, up his cheekbone then down his neck before pressing hot open-mouthed kisses to his jugular, wet and hot, before his next exhale blew cool air over drying spit. “C’mon sensei, please.” He mumbled. “More, fuck, I need more, it’s been so long. Need you to.. To take your frustration out on me, you naughty fuckin’- Ah fuckin’ perv. You like being put in power over me so, hah, please Izuku-”\n\nHis words died down when Izuku, amazing as a lover he was, slammed him down against the desk and rut upwards hard. He tugged both of Katsuki’s arms behind his back, pinning his wrists in place as he panted. “Fuck, Kacchan, you have a mouth on you. I missed it, I’ve missed you so much. You keep saying that name -” He punctuated his words with a particularly hard thrust, rocking him up against the desk which creaked beneath their movement.\n\n“Ah fuck, oh shit, Izuku-” His voice pitched higher the harder his pace became, large, thick hands encircling his waist and squeezing tight before flipping him over onto his back. He was back over him, between his legs, within seconds and driving his hips down at the same time he dragged Katsuki’s hands up above his head. A soft, languid stretch eased down Katsuki’s body, bringing a subtle arch in his back as he wound his legs around Izuku’s waist, bucking down eagerly to get him closer. “You like it? Like being called sensei and fucking your student?”\n\n“If it were you? Oh, Kacchan, gods, if it were you I’d have no way of holding back.” He said, as if Katsuki was what tethered his morals. He knew Izuku would never, but it was amusing to see him so lost in his own pleasure, in Katsuki that he didn’t seem to care. His hands were everywhere and his hips were practically rutting into him with abandon as he muttered. “You take me so well, fucking look at you, pulling me in like that. You’re so fuckin’ hot, so sexy, I- Hah~ Kacchan, you’re perfect. You’re fucking perfect.”\n\nFaster and faster, Izuku fucked into him, keeping his thighs pinned down as his curls fell into his eyes, tie thrown over his shoulder and shirt stretched over his muscles as it remained open at his chest to expose tanned, scarred and freckled skin, fabric sticking to him with sweat. He was a wet dream in the making, especially when he threw his head back to the ceiling with a bitten off groan, abdomen seemingly tensing and twitching as his voice pitched silky and straight into Katsuki’s veins. He didn’t usually curse, but when fucking him he seemed to have the filthiest mouth. “I’m gonna cum and you’re going to take it for me, right Kacchan? Gonna let me do this again until I make a mess of that pretty uniform?”\n\n“Yes, sensei.”"
