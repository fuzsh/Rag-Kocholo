        "meta_description": "A third-generation television writer (both his father and grandfather wrote for the medium), Whedon grew up in Manhattan and spent his high school years at an all-boys school in England. Following higher education at Connecticut&rsquo;s Wesleyan University, he spent a year mired in creative and career frustration, an ordeal that ended when he was hired as a writer for the sitcom&nbsp;Roseanne. Whedon stayed with the show for a year, quitting when he sold his first film script. The resulting movie,&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&nbsp;(1992), was a disappointment, and Whedon subsequently found work writing (often in an uncredited capacity) for a number of high-profile films, including the lavishly praised and hugely popular&nbsp;Toy Story(1995). In 1997, Whedon resurrected his story of a teenaged vampire-slaying valley girl, creating the much more popular TV version; within a short time, the series was hailed as one of the best on television, and it had accumulated a large and loyal fan base. That same year, Whedon wrote the script forAlien Resurrection. In 1999, as a measure of&nbsp;Buffy&rsquo;s&nbsp;success, Whedon created&nbsp;Angel, a spin-off of his original show. LikeBuffy, it soon boasted a loyal fan base, as well as largely favorable reviews. The next year, he co-wrote the script for the animated sci-fi adventure&nbsp;Titan A.E.&nbsp;He was also nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the almost entirely silent&nbsp;Buffy&nbsp;episode&nbsp;&ldquo;Hush&rdquo;, a considerable achievement given the show&rsquo;s supernatural/fantasy bent and the fact that it did not air on a major network. In 2002, Whedon created yet another TV series, this time a &ldquo;sci-fi Western&rdquo; called&nbsp;Firefly. The showed was short-lived, lasting only 12 episodes before being canceled (three more episodes were unaired but eventually released on DVD). The next year saw the final season of Whedon&rsquo;s much-loved&nbsp;Buffy, which had lasted seven seasons, with&nbsp;Angel&nbsp;quick to follow suit. Though fans rallied to keep the series on the air,&nbsp;Angel&nbsp;was canceled in 2004 after five seasons. With fans mourning the end of the &ldquo;Buffy-verse&rdquo; and amidst rampant speculation of more spin-offs, Whedon surprisingly announced that his next project would be a movie version of his failed television show&nbsp;Firefly. He quickly had a script ready, and the film, entitled&nbsp;Serenity&nbsp;(after the spaceship from the series), went into production that same year and was released in 2005. Whedon had a similar experience with&nbsp;Dollhouse&nbsp;in 2009, which was cancelled due to low ratings after a two season run. 2012 would prove a much better year for Whedon, who produced the hit horror comedy&nbsp;Cabin in the Woods, and directed the summer blockbuster&nbsp;The Avengers. &mdash;Rebecca Flint Marx,&nbsp;Rovi",
