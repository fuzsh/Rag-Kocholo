        "text": "In prime time, as elsewhere, it’s good to be king.\n\nLast week CBS rewarded ‘The Big Bang Theory,’ television’s reigning comedy, with not a one or a two, but a highly unusual three-year extension. That’s how much faith the network has in that band of merry nerds.\n\nMost TV shows don’t enjoy that kind of luxury. In fact, plenty of dramas and sitcoms are perched on the proverbial ‘bubble,’ wondering if they have a future.\n\nYes, the TV Death Watch has begun.\n\nThis is the industry’s pilot season, which means network programmers are busy evaluating fresh shows for the fall lineups they’ll announce in May. To make room for newbies, some existing shows have to go.\n\nSo is your fave in trouble? To help you find out, we’ve whipped up this handy status update covering all five of the major networks. Keep in mind that things are constantly shifting and that just because a show is listed as a ‘possible goner,’ it doesn’t mean the plug has been pulled. Yet.\n\nABC’Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,’ a superhero saga from revered filmmaker Joss Whedon, was the biggest, buzziest, shiniest, coolest-looking show coming into the fall. But ratings haven’t been so super, and it is not a lock to return.\n\nBetter call in Iron Man and Thor.\n\nOther possible goners: ‘Trophy Wife,’ ‘Super Fun Night,’ ‘The Taste,’ ‘Last Man Standing,’ ‘Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,’ ‘Betrayal,’ ‘Mind Games,’ ‘Mixology.’\n\nAlready dead: ‘The Assets,’ ‘Killer Women.’\n\nCBSYes, ‘Big Bang’ rules, but on the other hand, CBS is losing one of its comedy linchpins in ‘How I Met Your Mother,’ which ends its nine-season run on March 31. So prepare to say goodbye to Barney, Robin, Ted and that whole gang.\n\nStill, CBS is the most stable of networks. Last week, the network gave early renewal notices to a whopping 18 shows, in addition to ‘Big Bang.’\n\nOther possible goners: ‘Hostages,’ ‘The Mentalist,’ ‘Intelligence,’ ‘The Crazy Ones.’\n\nNBCWhere is the love for Michael J. Fox? NBC thought it had a sure thing when it signed up the popular sitcom star to head an art-imitates-life comeback project. But after the show started with solid ratings, viewers fled in droves, and it was yanked from the schedule in February.\n\nDon’t expect Fox’s sitcom to return next fall, but NBC has said it will air the remaining episodes.\n\nOther possible goners: ‘Community,’ ‘Dracula,’ ‘Revolution,’ ‘Hannibal.’\n\nAlready dead: ‘Sean Saves the World,’ ‘Welcome to the Family.’\n\nFOXApparently, Fox has become a safe haven for sitcoms with soft ratings. ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine,’ ‘New Girl’ and ‘The Mindy Project’ generate nothing-to-brag-about numbers, but all three already have been renewed. The extension for ‘Mindy’ was especially surprising.\n\nNot as fortunate was ‘Raising Hope.’ The Chance family ran out of chances, and the show will finish up with a one-hour finale April 4.\n\nOther possible goners: ‘Dads,’ ‘Almost Human,’ ‘Enlisted,’ ‘Rake.’ (Note: ‘American Dad’ is moving to TBS).\n\nAlready dead: ‘The X Factor,’ ‘The Cleveland Show.’\n\nTHE CW’Sex and the City’ may have enjoyed a nice long run on HBO, but ‘The Carrie Diaries,’ a teen-centric drama about Carrie Bradshaw in her younger years, never managed to fill its predecessor’s stilettos. If it somehow returns, we’ll buy cosmos for the house.\n\nOther possible goners: ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ ‘Hart of Dixie,’ ‘The Tomorrow People,’ ‘Star-Crossed.’\n\nAlready dead: ‘Nikita.”PSYCH’ OUT\n\nSpeaking of departing shows, over on cable, ‘Psych’ (9 p.m. March 26, USA) will bring its highly successful eight-season run to a close next week.\n\nThe series finale will be followed by the ‘Psych After Show’ (10 p.m.), which will have James Roday, Dule Hill and the rest of the cast – as well as creator Steve Franks – on hand to answer questions from a studio audience and reminisce about the series.\n\n‘Psych’ is one of the rare cable series to crank out more than 100 episodes. Along the way, it forged a strong connection with its fans via multiple Comic-Con appearances and a 10-city college tour. One of the highlights of its long run was a two-hour musical episode that aired last December."
