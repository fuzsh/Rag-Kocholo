        "text": "Joss Whedon’s ‘The Nevers’ On HBO Is Getting Skewered By Critics And Fans Alike\n\nJoss Whedon is not exactly in many people’s good graces these days, and it’s hard to know if any of that has factored into analysis of The Nevers, his high-profile HBO series that does not seem to be landing with eith...\n\n‘Justice League’ Star Ray Fisher Says WarnerMedia Probing Charges Of Mistreatment On Set\n\nRay Fisher previously said director Joss Whedon’s on-set treatment was ‘gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable.’\n\nRonaldo’s $105 Million Year Tops Messi And Crowns Him Soccer’s First Billion-Dollar Man\n\nSoccer’s two biggest names have been dueling for a decade over who’s the best—and highest-paid—in the sport. The battle is far from finished.\n\n'Batgirl': Replacing Joss Whedon With Female Writers And Directors Is A No-Brainer\n\nWith Joss Whedon no longer involved, hiring women to write and direct 'Batgirl' is the obvious call for making this one into a genuine event movie.\n\nCyborg is Undergoing A Tonal Shift In Joss Whedon's 'Justice League' Reshoots\n\nJoss Whedon is lightening up the gloomy Cyborg.\n\nZack Snyder Leaves 'Justice League,' Joss Whedon To Help Finish The Film\n\nSnyder will step away from the movie after a family tragedy, while Whedon has been tasked with finishing the picture.\n\nTop 10 Best Casting Picks For Joss Whedon's 'Batgirl' Movie\n\nWarner Bros.' plans to expand the bat-corner of their DC Comics shared cinematic universe got another boost this week, as word broke that writer-director-producer Joss Whedon is in negotiations to bring his immense talents to a Batgirl movie project.\n\nCOUNCIL POST | Membership (fee-based)\n\nThe Strong Female Standard: An Interview With Joss Whedon\n\nIt could be decades until the wage gap between men and women is finally equal.\n\nMillionaire Joss Whedon Says Marvel Short-Changed Him On 'Avengers'\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon this weekend said he has made more money from Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, an independently-financed 2008 musical series, than from Marvel's 2012 The Avengers, which grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\n'The Avengers: Age of Ultron' Honest Trailer Wants You To Feel Sorry For Joss Whedon\n\nScreen Junkies' latest honest trailer takes a look at the big Marvel movie crossover of 2015, 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron.'\n\nCheck Out Joss Whedon's Hilarious Mitt Zombie Spoof\n\nAvengers director Joss Whedon gives Romney a boost just in time for the Zombie Apocalypse.\n\n'Avengers' Director Joss Whedon on Trying to Be More Like Buffy\n\nJoss Whedon has the kind of credibility that only comes from repeated failure. To his intensely devoted fans, Whedon is nothing less than a genius, the hyperliterate auteur who created the cult hit \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and would have minted a half-dozen other self-aware genre franchises by now if it weren't for the eternal obtuseness of network and studio executives. Which is why they're all the more frenzied about this week's opening of \"The Avengers.\" After years of treating Whedon like a cog, one of those corporate behemoths -- Disney's Marvel Entertainment -- has finally cottoned to the obvious: that there's no one in Hollywood better cut out to make a superhero flick that hardcore nerds will embrace and civilians won't be embarrassed to see.\n\nJoss Whedon Hangs Out With Vampires\n\nThe Geek Picture of the Day is hanging out at Sunnydale High."
