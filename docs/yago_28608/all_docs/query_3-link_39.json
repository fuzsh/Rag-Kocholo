        "text": "You know him for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Serenity, and of course The Avengers, but did you know that Joss Whedon was integral to so many Hollywood films, both good and bad? You'll be surprised by just how many he has worked on that you've seen, but didn't realise that your favourite prince of geekdom had a hand in getting out the door and into our willing hands.\n\nPerhaps no other modern filmmaker has been called up to fix as many troubled movies as Joss Whedon - he's been a go-to \"script doctor\" for years, from Waterworld to Thor 2 to name just a couple from this list, and he's also written full movies such as Alien: Resurrection.\n\nWe bet you anything that you've seen at least one of the movies on this list, but you'll be surprised to know that Whedon played a part in getting them into theatres, even if it was less than we are used to seeing from him today.\n\nBeing the writer and director of two of the most successful entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it will come as no surprise that Joss Whedon has been involved in several other MCU titles. It isn't just directing post-credit scenes that tie directly into his own films however.\n\nWhedon's history as a script doctor and enthusiasm for the MCU characters made him a natural choice to help Thor: The Dark World's director Alan Taylor tweak the script to ensure it represented the wider vision of the universe.\n\nTaylor said of Whedon's help, \"Joss came in to save our lives a couple of times,\" and joked that he was airlifted into London to help with a difficult scene, \"like SWAT or something\". Whedon was also involved in additional scenes that added more Loki to the film, and helped with an emotional scene with Thor and Jane to help them be \"much better and lighter on their feet\".\n\nAlthough not a momentous contribution, his tweaking was paramount to the finished film."
