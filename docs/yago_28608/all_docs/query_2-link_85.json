        "text": "STARTUP.COM —*** — Documentary on the rise and fall of an Internet-based business, featuring interviews with Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, Tom Herman, David Camp, Jose Feliciano, Dora Glottman and others; rated R (profanity); exclusively at the Tower Theatre.\n\nFrankly, the idea of a feature film about one of those so-called \"dot-com\" businesses sounds only marginally more exciting than one with extensive shots of drying paint.\n\nPerhaps that's why \"Startup.com\" comes as such a pleasant little surprise. This feature-length documentary takes what could be a sleep-inducing concept and makes it as compelling as almost any movie currently playing on the big screen.\n\nOf course, part of that is because the film plays out more like a dramatic thriller than a straight drama. And the filmmakers are smart to train their cameras on real-life characters and their struggles, instead of getting bogged down in technical jargon and complex explanations of e-commerce.\n\nThe characters are former high-school classmates Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman, who — having worked in the corporate world after college — tried to put their respective marketing skills and computer know-how to work.\n\nSo, in 1999, the two helped found govWorks.com, a Web-based company intended to facilitate interaction between the public and local government — such as providing a way to pay parking tickets online.\n\nNot too surprisingly, their idea was received warmly, though the two were then faced with a whole new set of challenges, including how to find funding, fighting off other like-minded businesses and actually getting the site up and running. And as their fledgling dot-com continued to make progress, the once-friendly relationship between the two former schoolmates became hostile, leading to a fight for control of the company.\n\nKudos to co-directors Chris Hegedus (1993's \"The War Room\") and Jehane Noujaim (Hegedus' former cinematographer) for making this as enthralling as it is. And it helps that they have such compelling subjects.\n\nTuzman — whose resemblance to WWF-wrestler-turned-actor the Rock is uncanny — may emerge as one of the story's heavies, but he's also charismatic (refreshingly, the filmmakers never demonize him for that). And Herman comes off as likable, though probably a bit naive.\n\n\"Startup.com\" is rated R for occasional use of strong profanity and some other crudities. Running time: 103 minutes."
