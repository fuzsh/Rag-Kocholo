The film is '...the story of a young woman's journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics,' Whedon told Variety. It's unclear when Whedon will start work on Goners, since he's slated to write and direct Wonder Woman (see 'Buffy Scribe Tapped for Wonder Woman').\n\nWhedon also told Variety that he has been thinking about a new TV series based on Spike, the vampire from the Buffy universe played by James Marster."
