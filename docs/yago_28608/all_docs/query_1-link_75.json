        "text": "Joss Whedon, 47, was born in New York. He graduated with a film studies degree from Connecticut's Wesleyan University, and became a screenwriter, working on the films Toy Story, Speed and Alien: Resurrection. His script for Buffy The Vampire Slayer was made into a movie in 1992; he then turned Buffy into a cult television series that ran from 1997-2003. The new Marvel blockbuster, Avengers Assemble, which he wrote and directed, is out now. His latest project is a film of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, which he made at his home in Santa Monica, California.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nFilming Much Ado About Nothing. In my home, with my family and my besties and the bard all around. Pure joy.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nThat I'll run out of things to say and not have the courage to shut up.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nStepping on glass.\n\nAside from a property, what's the most expensive thing you've bought?\n\nA digital camera that wasn't nearly as good as the cheapo model I had.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nThat's not really my style.\n\nWhat would your super power be?\n\nSpeak every language. Lame for comics (the X-Man who had it got super-killed), but awesome in life.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nHow much time do you have?\n\nWho would play you in the film of your life?\n\nA young, svelte Ned Beatty.\n\nWhat is your favourite smell?\n\nTruffles.\n\nWhat is your favourite word?\n\nToday, \"Diaphanous.\" Today's runner-up: \"Balls.\"\n\nCat or dog?\n\nCat! Dog: need need, poop, chew, need, lick, need. Cat: whatev. Meow, yo. Here's a mouse.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nKilling drifters.\n\nWhat do you owe your parents?\n\nThey made me who I am. It's not necessarily a compliment.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nMy wife, for not knowing how to live as abundantly as she does.\n\nWho would you invite to your dream dinner party?\n\nHitler. And I'd serve meat! In your face! It would be rude not to eat it!\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\n\"I'm sorry, were you talking?\"\n\nWhat is the worst job you've done?\n\nI once was a Hollywood writer.\n\nIf you could edit your past, what would you change?\n\nAre you kidding? My past would be, like, eight minutes long.\n\nIf you could go back in time, where would you go?\n\nTo the 20s, where I'd invent modern comic books and be like, \"No, I totally thought of this stuff myself. Let's Charleston!\"\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nReading a friend's obit. Dude was 100, but still… he lived.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI do not understand your earthworld questionings.\n\nHow often do you have sex?\n\nWhat is this, Cosmo? Eight days a week, baby – matinees on Wednesday. Seriously, eew.\n\nWhere would you most like to be right now?\n\nOn the Great Wall, smoking a doobie and breaking a story.\n\nTell us a joke.\n\nYour life has meaning.\n\nTell us a secret.\n\nYour life has meaning."
