        "text": "Listen in / It’s in Warner Music’s interests to encourage consumers to subscribe to a paid streaming service. According to the 2020 Global Music Report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, in 2019 paid streaming accounting for 42% of all recorded music revenue. As such, it makes sense for the company to direct some of its marketing at streaming platforms.\n\nA helping hand / Sometimes the best advertising isn’t advertising, it’s anthropology. This is what Contagious co-founder Paul Kemp-Robertson and lead strategist Chris Barth advocate in The Contagious Commandments: Ten Steps to Brand Bravery. In the book Kemp-Robertson and Barth write: ‘Any brand with a bank account can be generous…[but] Sometimes the best and most enduring solutions come from being supremely consumer-centric, by studying human society in order to solve pain points or to facilitate moments of joy in people’s lives.’\n\nWarner Music is helping parents and children with speech impediments in a fun and engaging way while solving a pain point: the price of therapy. Despite some child-focused speech therapy services charging around £50 ($70) for a 30-minute session (after a $280 assessment), parents and kids can now access the necessary treatment for just $9.99 (the price of an Apple Music subscription). For brands, being generous towards society and helping alleviate problems is a tried and tested way to achieve consumer loyalty. Quite simply put, it’s good business."
