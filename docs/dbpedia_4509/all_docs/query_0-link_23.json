        "text": "5 Ways Nutrition Coaching Can Transform Employee Wellbeing Ever heard of nutrition coaching for employees? Well, it‚Äôs one of the easiest ways to help transform your workforce. This year The Good Nutrition Co. (https://lnkd.in/gWrKPzcZ) is collaborating with HR Managers, CEOs and Workplace Wellness leads to build nutrition education programming that upskills and empowers. Here are 5 ways we‚Äôre helping organisations deliver‚Ä¶ o Supporting mental health through food and avoiding burnout o Understanding the impact of hunger on learning and social skills o Improving sleep through nutrition o Supporting feeding busy families o And, guiding employees on how to boost metabolism and support a healthy weight. We‚Äôll be available over the next couple of weeks to meet with more organisations as they look to firm up their workplace wellbeing plans for 2024. You can book your time via the link‚Ä¶. https://bit.ly/3NPiQJ6 #workplacementalhealth #workplacewellbeing #corporatenutrition\n\nPrioritizing Employee Wellness DVS Advisory Groupüåüüåø We are Excited to share insights from our recent wellness session led by Dr.Umanath and moderated by Mr.VISWANATH D. The active participation and positive feedback from our team reaffirm our commitment at DVS to the health and well-being of our members. Here are key takeaways to help us all nurture our digestive health and vision: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Timing Matters: Just like a well-timed train schedule, our meals should follow a rhythm. Missing meal timings can disrupt the entire digestive process. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Early Dinner Benefits: Optimal digestion starts with an early dinner‚Äîbefore 6.30 PM on weekends and 1.5 hours before bed on other days. It's about giving our bodies ample time to digest before rest. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chew, Don't Rush: Slow down, savor each bite. Proper chewing aids digestion and can lead to transformative changes in our overall health. 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Golden Rules: Remember, it's not just what we eat but also when and how we eat. Avoid large water intake post-meals, opt for small sips an hour later, and choose your food wisely. üëÄ Additionally, let's not overlook the significance of vision health: 5Ô∏è‚É£ Screen Breaks: Take regular breaks from screens to prevent eye strain. Shut off gadgets 1.5 hours before bed for better sleep quality and eye health. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Protect Your Vision: Consider investing in blue-light-cut lenses and follow simple exercises to maintain good vision. üí¨ Wellness is a journey, and these small adjustments can make a big difference in our overall well-being. Let's commit to prioritizing our health, one mindful choice at a time. #EmployeeWellness #HealthIsWealth #dvshealth #dvsa #dvsadvisorygroup #dvs #dvsemployeehealth #dvstraining\n\nCorporate Wellness advocates,If you are looking for a new approach to encourage employees to participate in Wellness challenges, try this with your staff. We recently launched this initiative and didn‚Äôt know what to expect. Participation and has been incredible. We created a chat group for participants to talk about their experiences and it has been filled with positivity and enlightenment. Some times we just need to slow down, and do what we can. Elevate Your Well-Being: Join My Personal Two-Week Slow Eating Challenge! In a society that often rushes through meals, I'm taking on a personal challenge ‚Äì the Two-Week Slow Eating Challenge from January 17th to 31st. Many embark on the journey to lose weight by trying to adhere to a new eating plan. Perhaps the best way to start out is just by slowing down and being mindful of what you are eating before changing your nutrition. You might find that you eat less, feel more satisfied, and bring overall enjoyment to your day. Key Highlights: Enhance digestion, hydration, and weight management through mindful eating. Set an attainable personal goal for the number of meals to practice slow eating. Invite a friend to share this personal journey for mutual support. Journal Your Journey: After each slow eating practice, I'll be journaling my feelings, observations, and any changes I notice. This personal reflection is the key to understanding the impact of slow eating on my overall well-being. Individual Recognition: This challenge is about celebrating personal victories and acknowledging the positive changes in daily life. It's not a competition but a journey towards mindful living. Ready to Transform Your Meals? Join me on this personal journey of mindful eating. Let's make these two weeks about savoring each bite and embracing positive changes in our lives. #PersonalChallenge #MindfulEating #wellnessjourney #EmployeeWellness, #WorkplaceWellbeing, #CorporateWellness, #EmployeeHealth, #WellnessAtWork, #HealthyWorkLife, #TeamWellness, #WorkplaceBalance, #EmployeeFitness, #WellnessProgram #healthyhabitsforlife #HealthcareWellness, #MedicalWellbeing, #HolisticHealthcare, #PatientWellness, #ClinicalWellness, #HealthProfessionals, #WellnessInHealth, #HealthyHospitals, #NurseWellness, #MedicalWellness Kat Remner\n\nMy Functional Wellness Planning Session is a 2 Part, comprehensive session designed exclusively to create a personal individual wellness support plan for you.
