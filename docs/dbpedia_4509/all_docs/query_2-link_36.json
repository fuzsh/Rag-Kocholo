        "text": "Like their clients, Warner Music Group’s employees are also artists, so the company’s new headquarters showcases the enduring legacy of their creative output. While honoring the unique characteristics and independent nature of each individual WMG label, the workplace presents one cohesive, overarching brand statement. Each music label enjoys its own reception space, while the main reception area visually conveys the essence of the company as a whole. The new offices include a boardroom and executive area, coffee bar pantries, copy and mail rooms, conference spaces, and wellness rooms. Overlooking an open terrace, the commons serve as a comfortable setting where employees can work, dine, socialize, and entertain. The new “house of brands” reinforces WMG’s commitment to new and existing artists through an expressive environment that promotes their future, even as it celebrates the work of entertainers past."
