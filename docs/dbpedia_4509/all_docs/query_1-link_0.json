        "text": "First Alliance Between SoundCloud and Major Music Company Across Recorded Music and Music Publishing\n\nDeal Monetizes Existing Service and Licenses Planned Subscription Offering\n\nWarner Music Group (WMG) and SoundCloud today announced that WMG is the first major music group to forge a partnership with the audio platform which is currently used by 175 million unique listeners every month. The deal covers SoundCloud’s ad-supported, creator partner program, “On SoundCloud”, and its subscription streaming service that is due to launch in the first half of 2015.\n\nThe landmark partnership will create new commercial and promotional possibilities for WMG’s roster of established and emerging recording artists as well as songwriters signed to WMG’s music publishing arm, Warner/Chappell Music. Further, the deal includes innovative licensing terms that will provide WMG and its artists greater ability to manage the availability of content, while providing a path towards delivering additional revenue from user-generated mixes and mash-ups of WMG music.\n\nRob Wiesenthal, Chief Operating Officer/Corporate, WMG, said, “This leading-edge partnership reflects WMG’s commitment to establishing new and alternative business models that recognize the value of music for our artists. SoundCloud is a platform built on music innovation and it has a rare ability to drive music discovery while enhancing the connection and collaboration between an artist and their following. Our deal will foster that relationship, while providing a powerful range of income opportunities for WMG’s artists and songwriters.”\n\nJonathan Dworkin, EVP, Digital Strategy & Business Development, WMG, said, “SoundCloud is a distinctly artist-driven service, with a highly engaged global fan community at its heart. This deal will enable SoundCloud to further develop its product as well as its massive user base, and will deliver multi-tiered monetization while preserving the elements that have made the service so popular. It’s a win for artists, for rights-holders and for consumers.”\n\nAlexander Ljung, SoundCloud’s founder & CEO, said, “We’re thrilled that Warner Music Group will be the first major label to join our new creator partner program. We expect to generate significant revenue for Warner and its artists in the months and years ahead as we roll out an ad-supported offering and subscription service that delivers real value to the industry.”\n\nThis pioneering deal with SoundCloud is the latest in a series of innovative moves by Warner Music Group, including forming a ground-breaking partnership with music discovery app Shazam and building the first strategic alliance between a major music company and Clear Channel, the world’s largest radio group.\n\nABOUT WARNER MUSIC GROUP\n\nWith its broad roster of new stars and legendary artists, Warner Music Group is home to a collection of the best-known record labels in the music industry, including Asylum, Atlantic, Big Beat, East West, Elektra, Fueled by Ramen, Nonesuch, Parlophone, Reprise, Rhino, Roadrunner, Rykodisc, Sire, Warner Bros., Warner Classics, Warner Music Nashville, and Word, as well as Warner/Chappell Music, one of the world’s leading music publishers, with a catalog of more than one million copyrights worldwide.\n\nSource: Warner Music Group\n\nRelated News\n\nFeatured / August 14, 2024\n\nHEADLINER: INSIDE THE LATIN MUSIC EXPLOSION: WARNER MUSIC LATIN AMERICA PRESIDENT ALEJANDRO DUQUE\n\nPress Release / August 7, 2024\n\nWARNER MUSIC GROUP CORP.
