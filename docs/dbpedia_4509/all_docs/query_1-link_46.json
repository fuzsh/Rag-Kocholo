        "text": "In 2004, Edgar Bronfman Jr., the enfant terrible of the family of Canadian liquor magnates, engaged in the third major entertainment multinational restructuring of his career. As with the PolyGram/Universal merger he engineered in 1998, and the disastrous acquisition of Universal by the French waste management corporation Vivendi in 2000, in which Bronfman participated, the establishment of the Warner Music Group (WMG) in 2004 mobilized a process of financial leverage that imposed onerous conditions upon the new company's corporate subsidiaries.Footnote 1 The end result was the downsizing of thousands of employees and the slashing of artist rosters across each of the company's major divisions.\n\nThe corporate restructuring that accompanied the acquisition of Time/Warner's music division by a Bronfman-led private equity consortium had decisive implications for jazz artists located throughout the Warner Music corporate umbrella. One casualty of the leveraged buyout (LBO) was the Warner Jazz subsidiary, a unit under the direction of accomplished producer and artist-and-repertory executive Matt Pierson, with a well-regarded roster of both “straightahead” and “smooth jazz” artists. While the formation of Warner Brothers’ jazz division dates to 1978, Warner Jazz saw dramatic growth under Pierson, who joined Warner as director of A&R in the early 1990s and whose stewardship of Warner Jazz through the following decade saw the subsidiary signing prominent artists such as Joshua Redman, Brad Mehldau, and Kenny Garrett.Footnote 2 The 2004 WMG restructuring saw the shuttering of Warner Jazz and the relocation of its most prominent jazz artists to Nonesuch Records, a distinctive classical subsidiary of Elektra under the direction of Bob Hurwitz. The Warner Jazz transplants would find themselves in the company of a singularly eclectic and “arty” label roster, comprising such disparate artists as Steve Reich, the Kronos Quartet, Wilco, the Buena Vista Social Club, k.d. lang, David Byrne, Emmylou Harris, and Youssou N'Dour.Footnote 3\n\nThe question that interests me here is a deceptively simple one. Why were these jazz artists moved to Nonesuch? In what sense did Hurwitz's boutique label provide a more congenial ecology for Warner Music's jazz roster, at a moment of turbulence brought on by the financial restructuring of Warner's music holdings? At stake is our understanding of how longstanding label subsidiaries navigate the corporate volatility that has become a central feature of the era of financialization. The LBO of WMG reflects a contemporary market logic in which value extraction has become the overriding goal of corporate restructuring.Footnote 4 Whether through share repurchase programs, issuing of special dividends, or the debt accrued via LBOs, financial deals enacted at the uppermost reaches of major label corporate hierarchies pass along significant costs to label subsidiaries, installing precarity at their very core.\n\nThe Bronfman WMG acquisition demonstrates how logics of financialization shape the conditions of possibility for creativity in a capitalist society. As Marianna Ritchey has argued, the field of musicology, despite having produced sophisticated close readings of the structures of feeling through which dynamics of gender, sexuality, and race are imbricated in musical practices, has until recently been somewhat inattentive to the material conditions in which these structures of feeling are brought into being.Footnote 5 But even as musicologists have come to devote sustained attention to political economy, there is more work to be done on the financialization of the music industry.Footnote 6 Our analysis here must extend beyond music scholars’ laudable recent focus on the dynamics of distribution, marketing, and consumption at independent and major labels.Footnote 7 In the early twenty-first century, these concrete, front-line determinations of which music makes it to what audience, of who has access to and/or ownership of music, are all directly shaped by the music industry's intimate alignment with the structural contours and cultural logics of the financial markets. In this context, our understanding of the financial stability of an entity such as Nonesuch Records has to be as attentive to its efficacious navigation of its parent corporation's culture of financialization as it is to its branding, A&R, and distribution strategies. As I hope to demonstrate, Nonesuch accomplishes this successful navigation through its deft balancing of the neoliberalized fiscal demands of its parent corporation, on the one hand, and its thoughtful approach to the curation of its artist roster, on the other.\n\nI speak here of a “neoliberalized” music industry, and yet, as I hope the following discussion makes clear, the reach of neoliberalism is not always as totalizing as the scholarship on the subject may imply. Our assessments of neoliberalized institutions in contemporary scholarship are perhaps indebted to a picture of the ruthlessly dehumanized, metrics-driven practices at work on the shop floor of an Amazon fulfillment center or the trading floor of the Wall Street investment bank.Footnote 8 By contrast, this case study of Nonesuch and Warner Jazz indicates the extent to which human relationships continue to mediate many aspects of the day-to-day operations of the music multinationals, shaping and in some cases mitigating the worst aspects of capital's ethos of “creative destruction.”Footnote 9 As Eduardo Herrera reminds us in a different context, the large institutions that we scholars habitually treat as faceless monoliths are in fact peopled, their actions and strategies together constituting “an [ever-]emerging domain of complex entanglements and webs of relations and ideas, all being mediated and enacted as the result of human, institutional, discursive, and even material actors.”Footnote 10 Such entanglements, shaped by the decisions of human actors, must be understood as complicating our picture of the ubiquity of neoliberalism's instrumentalism, as I hope to demonstrate here.\n\nMy discussion here will also complicate our sense of how jazz is positioned within the twenty-first century music industry. Jazz historiography tends to have us look at the jazz record business through the lens of the “jazz label,” whether that label is an independent (Verve or Blue Note, in their original incarnations) or major label subsidiary (such as Columbia Records's jazz division). The genre homogeneity overseen by A&R executives at such labels leads to a certain set of assumptions, specific to that genre space, about how best to recruit artists, develop repertory, produce recordings, and market albums.Footnote 11 We can see this, for instance, with Blue Note's strategy of paying artists to rehearse the hard bop arrangements on its midcentury recordings, or CTI Records's cultivation of a cohesive house “sound,” at the intersection of jazz and pop, in the 1960s and 1970s.Footnote 12 By contrast, we might see Nonesuch's incorporation of the former Warner Jazz artist roster into its eclectic genre space as a manifestation of a different model, more appropriate to twenty-first century music industry priorities, where the assembly of a more diversified portfolio of artists serves as a strategy of risk management.Footnote 13"
