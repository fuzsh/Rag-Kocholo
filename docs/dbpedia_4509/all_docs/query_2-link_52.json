However, please note that our record labels do not accept unsolicited materials. Join Today!\n\nCreate a free account\n\nNo Credit Card\n\nWarner Music does not accept unsolicited material\n\nWarner Music explicitly states that they do not accept song demo submissions.\n\nPlease read the disclaimer below to better understand their policies.\n\nDemos should only be submitted to Warner Music Group’s record labels (e.g., Atlantic, Elektra, Warner Records, Parlophone) for consideration, not directly to Warner Music Group. However, please note that Warner Music Group’s record labels do not accept unsolicited materials. This means that your demo must be recommended to our labels by an established industry professional (manager, agent, lawyer, journalists, one of our artists, etc.). Industry professionals that understand the creative goals of our record labels are best suited to make these recommendations.\n\nWe strongly suggest you seek out the assistance of one of these individuals.\n\nThe best way to submit music to Warner Music\n\nRemember that music submission processes can vary, and it’s essential to stay updated with any changes or new features offered by AvenueAR. Always ensure that your music is professionally produced and ready for consideration by major labels like Warner Music.\n\nSteps to submitting to Warner Music\n\nSubmitting your music to Warner Music, one of the major record labels, typically involves following industry-standard practices. Here’s a general guide on how to submit your music to Warner Music:\n\nCreate an AvenueAR Account:\n\nSign up for an AvenueAR account if you haven’t already. Ensure that your profile is complete with accurate information about yourself and your music.\n\nNavigate to the Submission Section:\n\nLog in to your AvenueAR account and look for a section or feature related to music submissions. This section may be labeled as “Submit Music” or something similar.\n\nChoose Warner Music or A&R Executive:\n\nWithin the submission section, you may have the option to choose Warner Music as your desired destination or select a specific A&R executive affiliated with Warner Music.\n\nFollow Submission Guidelines:\n\nAvenueAR may provide specific guidelines for music submissions. Follow these guidelines carefully, which may include details on file format, song selection, and a brief introduction.\n\nUpload Your Music:\n\nPrepare your music files and upload them to AvenueAR as per their instructions. Ensure that your music is of high quality and represents your best work.\n\nSubmit Your Music:\n\nSubmit your music through AvenueAR’s platform. Make sure to double-check that all required information and files are included before finalizing your submission.\n\nWait for Response:\n\nAfter submitting your music, be patient and wait for a response. It may take some time for Warner Music or the affiliated A&R executive to review your submission.\n\nFollow Up:\n\nIf you receive a positive response, follow any instructions provided for further communication or potential collaboration. If you receive a rejection or no response, continue to work on your music career independently and consider submitting to other opportunities."
