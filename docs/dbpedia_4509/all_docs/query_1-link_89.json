        "text": "Endel is an app that creates music to help you relax, focus and sleep.\n\nA Berlin-based music app has entered into an album distribution partnership with Warner Music Group.\n\nEndel, a “cross-platform audio ecosystem and iOS app”, has already released five albums this year as part of its “sleep soundscapes” collection designed to reduce anxiety – Clear Night, Rainy Night, Cloudy Afternoon, Cloudy Night and Foggy Morning.\n\nAccording to a press release, Endel creates “personalized, adaptive sound environments” based on personal user inputs including circadian rhythms, weather, heart rate and location. The app is expected to release another 15 albums this year that correspond with its other modes, including Focus and On-the-Go.\n\nJapan’s Avex Inc, Major Lazer’s Jillionaire and The Alexa Fund are all investors in Endel. The company has already launched a feature with Amazon’s Alexa Skills Store this week that allows users to receive custom sounds through Alexa-enabled devices. The app is currently available on smartphones and via the Amazon Echo.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Endel signed a record deal with Warner Music Group, due to incorrect information from a press release. Endel’s partnership with WMG applies to distribution only."
