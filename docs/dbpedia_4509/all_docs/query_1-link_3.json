Built around exclusive access to superstars, celebrities and breaking talent, ‘The Warner Sound’ YouTube channel will offer an eclectic mix of specially-produced programs, all with music at their core. The digital destination will embrace a broad spectrum of genres and formats, from artist interviews, back-stage documentaries and live events to animated series, scripted comedy and experimental concepts that take advantage of YouTube’s unique technology. Select programs will give fans the chance to decide the direction of the action, interact with artists or offer feedback. Accessible world-wide, ‘The Warner Sound’ will also feature rare films from Warner Music’s vaults as well as material from artist channels.\n\nThe launch of the channel will be celebrated with a live-stream of performances at ‘The Warner Sound Captured By Nikon’ showcase at the South by Southwest® Music & Media Conference (SXSW®) in Austin, Texas. From March 13th through March 15th, this will include gigs by T.I., B.o.B, Dr.John, Ed Sheeran, Gary Clark, Jr., Kimbra and Theophilus London, among many others. Once the channel is live, show production will gather pace, with further compelling features and personalities unveiled in the proceeding weeks.\n\nUnveiling the channel, Lyor Cohen, Chairman & CEO, Recorded Music, Warner Music Group said “The Warner Sound will be a unique opportunity for artists to further their creativity, excite their fans and diversify their careers. Collaborating with an array of talent from across our labels, we will produce highly original music programming and digital entertainment. Our channel will be home to a wide variety of must-see, exclusive shows, made by people who love music, for people who love music.”\n\nOcean MacAdams, a highly respected television executive, has been named as General Manager, The Warner Sound, overseeing the channel and its programming. Phil Botti, formerly VP of video content for Atlantic Records, will serve as the executive producer of the channel.\n\nMacAdams said “The Warner Sound combines imaginative programs featuring extraordinary artists with YouTube’s technology and vast global audience. We have everything ready to create premium on-demand entertainment, viral hits and unmissable internet events. On this channel, every show will have a love of music at its heart, but beyond that the possibilities are endless.”\n\nUpcoming exclusive content that can be revealed at this stage includes:\n\n• CeeLo Green Presents ManTazia: From the minds of multiplatinum-selling artist CeeLo Green and renowned filmmaker Mikael Colombu comes an experimental film series that explores the life, times and music of CeeLo. Directed, shaped and cut in 2D Jankyvision, each episode of this short-form series will take you on an adventure into the lush imagination of CeeLo Green. Produced by Mikael Colombu Films.\n\n• Untitled: Hot on the heels of his award-winning ‘A Tribe Called Quest’ documentary, actor and director Michael Rapaport presents this documentary series featuring different WMG artists. Produced by Michael Rapaport, Kenya Barris, Jason Bergh from UX Entertainment and Principato-Young Entertainment.\n\n• ‘Staged’: This show takes the famous lyrics of top stars and re-imagines them as the script of a drama. Each episode will be in a different style and feature recognizable lyrics from a WMG artist. The first episode is due to feature the songs of Gym Class Heroes. Produced by Koda Pictures and Principato-Young Entertainment.\n\n• ‘The Live Room’: Intimate performances shot in legendary recording studios around the world. Artists will perform their own music alongside covers of iconic songs recorded in that very space. The premiere will feature B.o.B at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta, with Regina Spektor also scheduled for a future episode, shot in New York. Produced by Michael Thelin Productions.\n\n• ‘Countdown To…’: An up-close look at the last frenetic days before a hotly-anticipated album comes out. In the first instalment, teen rap sensation Diggy criss-crosses the country headlining tours, shooting music videos, meeting fans and even doing homework. A new episode will appear every day for a week leading up to the release of ‘Unexpected Arrival’ on March 20th.\n\n• ‘Finding Cody Simpson’: Using YouTube’s annotation technology, fans will be able to create their own Cody Simpson movie. In a scripted, “choose your own adventure” series, viewers will drive the action as they follow along one fan’s journey to meet Cody Simpson. Produced by Studio 13 Productions (Dan Fogler, Michael Canzoniero, Thomas Sullivan).\n\nThe Warner Sound team is working with a variety of production agencies, in particular Mighty Fresh (www.mighty-fresh.com), an award-winning new media production company, led by Richard Frias and Marc Schrobilgen, which specializes in creating interactive entertainment and live shows. Mighty Fresh is responsible for the day-to-day editorial on The Warner Sound and helping produce an original slate of content tailored to the YouTube community.\n\nMacAdams joins WMG from Current TV, where he was SVP, Programming. Until 2009, he was SVP, MTV, leading editorial operations at MTV News and executive producing numerous series, specials and live events.\n\nSource: Warner Music Group"
