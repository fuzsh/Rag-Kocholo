        "text": "Warner Music Group Corp. (d.b.a. Warner Music Group, commonly abbreviated as WMG) is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" recording companies and the third-largest in the global music industry, after Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME). Formerly part of Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery), WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2011, when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries. It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in 2020, once again becoming a public company. With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs more than 3,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\n\nThe company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world, including Elektra Records, Reprise Records, Warner Records, Parlophone Records (formerly owned by EMI), and Atlantic Records. WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music, one of the world's largest music publishers.\n\nSince August 2, 2018, WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx.\n\nThey collaborated with Big Idea and Warner Home Video for reprints and releases of VeggieTales, 3-2-1 Penguins!, and LarryBoy: The Cartoon Adventures.\n\nList[]\n\nVeggieTales[]\n\nWhere's God When I'm S-Scared?
