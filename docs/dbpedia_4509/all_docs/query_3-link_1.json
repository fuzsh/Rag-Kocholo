We strive to bring together diverse perspectives that enhance innovation, and to ensure that WMG’s offices provide a safe and nurturing environment for everyone.\n\nOur Global DEI team, alongside our Global DEI Council and DEI Executive Committee, works to educate and involve our people around the world, providing the tools and resources for business leaders to uphold DEI values within their teams.\n\nWith the support of our Global DEI Institute, we regularly host events for the global company and organize initiatives that drive the delivery of our Global DEI Commitments. We also partner with a variety of organizations to diversify our candidate pools and develop talent, in addition to empowering more than 40 Employee Resource Group chapters.\n\nENVIRONMENT & SUSTAINABILITY\n\nWe’re taking steps to help accelerate urgent changes needed for our planet.\n\nIn December 2021, we became a founding member of the Music Climate Pact, endorsed by the United Nations. Through the Pact, we’re committed to a science-based target to reduce our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science.\n\nWe are measuring our full global GHG footprint, reducing energy use in our offices, and promoting more environmentally friendly products and packaging. By doing this, we also hope to leverage our wider cultural influence to drive positive change globally.\n\nSocial Impact\n\nThrough WMGives, we’re committed to powering positive change and investing in a variety of philanthropic initiatives.\n\nLarge-scale, meaningful progress can only happen when everyone does their part in their own backyard, and we encourage our people to support causes that are most pressing at a local level, as well as those that affect society at large. Through volunteering, in-kind donations, and monetary contributions, we focus our efforts on Community Support, the Environment, Equity & Social Justice, Wellbeing, and Youth. We also weave giving back into other aspects of our operations, including through benefit concerts, company events, and using our global network.\n\nThe $100 million Warner Music Group / Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund was established in June 2020 to support organizations doing outstanding work on the front lines of education, criminal justice reform, and cultural and performing arts.\n\nEthics & Compliance\n\nOur Code of Conduct (CoC) ensures that we are properly equipped with the tools and resources needed to understand and uphold the highest business standards, practices, and behaviors. We share common values, exercise good judgement, and act ethically in all our business dealings.\n\nOur CoC is a reflection of who we are and what we stand for. It also outlines the proper action to take in the unlikely instance we are placed in a suspect or ethically questionable business situation.\n\nWe have a robust compliance training program that covers topics such as anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, antibribery and anti-corruption, sanctions, money laundering, conflicts of interest, ethical decision making, and ways to speak up if an employee recognizes non-compliance with WMG’s CoC or other behaviors that could make them uncomfortable.\n\nOur collective commitment ensures that we maintain our reputation as a leader not only in the music industry, but in the global business community."
