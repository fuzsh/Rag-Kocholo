        "text": "Project Intro – WMG.com\n\nWhen Warner Music Group (WMG) came to us with the opportunity to redesign their corporate website, it was music to our ears. The international entertainment company and record label had just completed an extensive rebranding process, and they needed to express their visual identity through a new website. Our challenge was to take the new collateral and design a digital system that reflected both the brand’s deep history and their focus on the future.\n\nHighlights – WMG.com\n\nThe new site’s homepage is the centerpiece of the design. Through a continuous scroll, we explore WMG’s brand narrative through their core tenants and highlight the artists, labels, and people that make WMG such a special place.\n\nBold typography reinforces these key messages, while animated design elements and embedded rich media showcase their global reach.\n\nA key component of WMG’s new branding is the 67-degree motif, the precise angle at which the “W” of the corporate logo forms. So we created a digital design system used throughout the website that leverages this visual cue to showcase all visual content, including motion graphics, imagery, and typography. The result is an unconventional and surprising interface that feels exciting, energetic, and forward-thinking.\n\nAnother important consideration for the platform was designing a back-end that allows WMG to update and curate media across the site. The music industry is constantly changing with new music, emerging artists, and tech, so the ability to replace videos quickly was built into the content management strategy.\n\nWhat we crafted is a compelling and energetic site that will engage music lovers and prospective employees alike. Our design and storytelling techniques are intended to celebrate music and the people who make it.\n\nThe site was awarded as an Honoree for Best Music Website by the Webby Awards.\n\nProject Intro – WMGATHERING\n\nBut WMG.com was just the beginning of our partnership. WMG needed to announce the updated brand and effectively communicate new initiatives to their staff and stakeholders around the world. As experts in video production & digital broadcasts, CMYK was a natural partner to help achieve this goal.\n\nWATCH\n\nWATCH\n\nPlaylist\n\nMUSIC IS EVERYTHING + SPEAKER INTROS\n\nVideo\n\nProject Highlights – WMGathering\n\nCMYK produced an epic brand reveal video featuring candid interviews, celebrity cameos, eye-popping animation and, of course, LOTS of music. The hour-long, star-studded presentation was then successfully broadcast to WMG employees around the world.\n\nCMYK managed all aspects of this production, capturing and editing footage into an impactful and cohesive final product. Additionally, our post production team leveraged new brand guidelines to create stylized motion graphics to enhance transitions, introduce speakers, communicate narrative elements, and introduced new logos, design collateral, elements, and exciting new applications of color."
