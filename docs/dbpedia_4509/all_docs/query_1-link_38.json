        "text": "Access accompanying images here.\n\nCambridge MA, USA, June 27, 2024 – Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Environmental Solutions Initiative (MIT ESI), with the support of Coldplay, Warner Music Group (WMG), Live Nation, and Hope Solutions, has announced the assembly of an advisory committee as it enters the next phase of its Assessment Report of Live Music and Climate Change in the US and the UK.\n\nThis newly selected advisory committee will be made up of over 50 members with assorted, specialized expertise in live music and the event industry, as well as academia.\n\n“As I’ve been saying for many years, we urgently need data-driven action on climate and nature breakdown in every area,” said Ellie Goulding, Artist & Advisory Committee member. This is the first time a study like this has taken place at this scale, including all the different parts of the industry ecosystem, from artists and promoters to management and labels and I’m really pleased to support that level of collaboration.”\n\nMembers of the committee were selected based on their individual areas of expertise across core areas which include, but are not limited to, venue management, tour management and production, artist relations, and sustainability. Their insights, data and expert perspectives will bolster the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the overall report, ensuring that the proposed strategies are relevant and practical in implementation, thereby enhancing the potential to drive meaningful change across the live music industry.\n\n“With the participation of the advisory committee and contributions of data from various sources, we are well on our way to producing a significant contribution to knowledge that can support meaningful actions to address climate change,” said Prof. John E. Fernandez, Director, MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative.\n\nAdditional contributions will come from various organizations, NGOs and charities that work within the live music ecosystem including REVERB, Support+Feed, Julie’s Bicycle, Global Citizen and Client Earth.\n\nThe report, which was initially anticipated to be complete in July 2024, has been extended to allow for more comprehensive data collection and analysis. It is now expected to be released in the Fall of 2024. The aim remains to:\n\ndevelop a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between live music and climate change.\n\nidentify key areas where the industry and concert goers can make tangible improvements to reduce emissions and drive planet-positive outcomes.\n\nprovide a detailed analysis of the latest developments in technology and practices that industry players can tap into.\n\nThe report will seek open contributions of data from those with field-specific knowledge that will ultimately be used to suggest sector-specific and industry-wide decarbonization solutions.
