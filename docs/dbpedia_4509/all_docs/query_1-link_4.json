        "text": "FAQ\n\nCan’t find the answer to your question? Contact us.\n\nWhere is Warner Music Group located?\n\nWe are a global music company operating in more than 50 countries through various subsidiaries, affiliates and non-affiliated licensees. Our headquarters are located in Manhattan at 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019.\n\nHow can I find out about employment opportunities within Warner Music Group?\n\nTo view current our employment opportunities, click here.\n\nHow can I submit my demo to Warner Music Group?\n\nDemos should only be submitted to our record labels (e.g., Atlantic, Elektra, Warner Records, Parlophone) for consideration, not directly to Warner Music Group. However, please note that our record labels do not accept unsolicited materials. This means that your demo must be recommended to our labels by an established industry professional (manager, agent, lawyer, journalists, one of our artists, etc.). Industry professionals that understand the creative goals of our record labels are best suited to make these recommendations. We strongly suggest you seek out the assistance of one of these individuals.\n\nHow can I get an internship at one of Warner Music Group’s companies?\n\nWe’ve curated the WMG Classroom Series, an educational opportunity for college students to get an inside look at our industry, labels, and business operations through interactive lectures and panels facilitated by our leaders. Check out WMG Classroom Series’ opportunities below:\n\nI want to use a song by a Warner Music Group artist in my project. How do I obtain the necessary rights?\n\nIf you are interested in using the actual sound recording by an artist on a WMG record label, a good place to start is by calling our licensing division at Rhino Entertainment (818) 238-6100. If you are interested in using a musical composition that is published or administered by our music publishing company, Warner Chappell Music, you should visit the Warner Chappell website where you will find a useful song search tool as well as tools to request mechanical and print licenses.\n\nI have been contacted by someone claiming to work for WMG or an affiliate label requesting a fee, is this a valid request on behalf of the company?\n\nIt has come to our attention that individuals impersonating employees of Warner Music Group or one of our affiliates have been contacting artists with fraudulent schemes in an attempt to scam them out of money. Although these emails and social media accounts may look like they are from someone at WMG, please note that it is against our policy for employees of WMG to accept or to ask for any type of fee in exchange for submitting your demo or signing a contract. If you have been contacted by someone who claims to be an employee of WMG and who requests a fee, please email us at [email protected].\n\nI’ve been asked to invest in cryptocurrency or a pyramid scheme on behalf of a Warner Music Group affiliate or someone claiming to work for Warner Music Group. Is this a valid request?\n\nScam artists are misusing the Warner Music Group brand to defraud people. They’re enticing people to invest cryptocurrency to join a pyramid scheme. We’ve filed a complaint with prosecutors and are talking to law enforcement about the scheme. Please don’t share your details with these people, attend their meetings or pay them money.\n\nI am a royalty participant concerned about receiving payments for my work. How can I update my contact information or verify the status of my account?\n\nOver the years, some recording artists, songwriters and producers affiliated with us and our companies have moved without notifying us of their new addresses. This means that royalty payments and/or royalty accountings are occasionally returned to us without forwarding information.\n\nIf you are a royalty participant and believe you are entitled to an accounting or have moved without notifying us, please visit our artist royalties page for more information.\n\nHow do I solicit Warner Music Group for a donation to a charity or charitable event?\n\nFor more information on WMGives click here or email [email protected].\n\nWhere can I submit a press or media inquiry?\n\nFor press and media inquiries, please reach out to our Corporate Communications team directly. If you do not already have a direct contact, please send an email to [email protected].\n\nWhat is WMG’s COVID-19 response plan?\n\nOur top priority is the safety and wellbeing of our team members, artists and songwriters across the globe. We are fully committed to helping our people balance their home and life commitments with flexible working options, virtual wellness sessions, and more. We strive to maintain a COVID-free workplace. To that end, being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is a condition of employment for all US employees, subject to our legal obligation to make reasonable accommodations in certain limited circumstances."
