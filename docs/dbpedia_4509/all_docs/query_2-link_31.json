        "text": "The Warner Music Group will see CEO of Recorded Music Max Lousada step down at the end of September, the company announced today.\n\nLousada has run the recorded music operation for eight years and will remain an adviser until January 31. However, Lousada’s role will cease to exist moving forward, as will the post of President of International.\n\nVeteran Atlantic Records and Atlantic Music Group chairman/CEO Julie Greenwald will become chairman of Atlantic Music Group, reporting directly to WMG CEO Robert Kyncl.\n\n10k Projects founder Elliot Grainge will become CEO of Atlantic Music Group effective October 1, also reporting to Kyncl.\n\nGrainge has been with Warner for less than a year, after bringing 10K from Universal to Warner in a joint venture in September. Grainge is the son of Universal Music Group chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at WMG, I’d like to thank Max for his extraordinary achievements over the last 20 years,” Kyncl said in a statement. “Max is a true artists’ champion, who created a culture that puts artistry first, growing our global reach and building a roster of incredible talent and an outstanding team. I’m grateful that he’ll be helping to ensure a smooth transition.”\n\nLousada said in a statement: “Over the past two decades, we created something special together at Warner: a music company built for artists, where original voices are championed, where their creativity is honored and protected, and where superstar careers are ignited. I’m proud to have grown a world-class team who share that vision and whose enterprise and energy have brought in new labels, rebuilt iconic brands, expanded our global network, and pioneered new fan experiences. The music business has always been about evolution, and the time has come for me to build something new. I’ll be helping the team through this transition, and I have no doubt they’ll continue to develop artists who move the world.”"
