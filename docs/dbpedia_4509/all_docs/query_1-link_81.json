        "text": "WILLIAM BRANGHAM: More than one billion users around the world may find that TikTok is a bit less fun than it was just yesterday.\n\nAs John Yang tells us, it's tied to a major showdown between TikTok and the world's biggest record label.\n\nJOHN YANG: One of the world's most popular video sharing apps is suddenly a lot quieter without some of the world's most popular music.\n\nStarting today, songs licensed by Universal Music Group are being removed from TikTok, including some of the biggest names in music like The Weeknd or Ariana Grande, also disappearing, songs that have become viral trends, generating millions of views on the platform, like Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off,\" Rihanna's \"If it's Lovin' That You Want,\" or Olivia Rodrigo's \"Bad Idea Right.?\"\n\nNow users say scrolling through the app could soon look and sound like this.\n\nThe takedown has already begun.\n\nSearch for Taylor Swift's account, for example, and some of the videos featuring her music are muted, and the sounds tab on her profile is empty.\n\nIt's all because Universal and TikTok haven't been able to agree on a new licensing agreement to replace the one that expired Wednesday.\n\nUniversal says it's pushing TikTok on three issues, compensation for artists and songwriters, protecting artists from harmful effects of A.I.\n\nmusic creation, and protecting users from hate speech and harassment.\n\nIn a statement, the company said: \"TikTok attempted to bully us into accepting a deal worth less than the previous deal, far less than fair market value, and not reflective of their exponential growth.\"\n\nTikTok fired back, saying it \"has been able to reach artists' first agreements with every other label and publisher.\n\nClearly, Universal's self-serving actions are not in the best interest of artists, songwriters, and fans.\"\n\nCompletely removing Universal licensed music from TikTok will likely take several days to accomplish.\n\nBen Sisario covers the music industry for The New York Times.\n\nBen, we have heard this is -- they're trying to negotiate a rights deal to play Universal licensed music on TikTok.\n\nWhat are the sticking points?\n\nWhat's keeping them apart?\n\nBEN SISARIO, The New York Times: Well, Universal has said that there's basically two sticking points.\n\nThe first one is money.\n\nThey have asked TikTok to pay more for the music, and they say that TikTok has refused to pay what they consider an adequate royalty.\n\nThe other has to do with concerns over A.I.\n\nin music, artificial intelligence.\n\nUniversal says that TikTok has allowed its platform to be flooded with A.I.-generated music, which crowds out music by real people and also dilutes the royalty pool.\n\nJOHN YANG: So, Universal says they're doing this for the artists, but what do the artists feel about this?\n\nAre these things the artists want?\n\nBEN SISARIO: Well, if you ask an artist if they want more money from digital music, the answer will always be yes.\n\nBut artists are a bit conflicted in this.\n\nAnd some of them have started to speak out.\n\nNoah Kahan, who is nominated for a Grammy for best new artist this year, he made a short video talking about it.\n\nAnd the indication was TikTok is a good thing for an artist like him.\n\nIt's the place where songs become hits now.\n\nIt's a very vibrant social platform that's popular with young people.\n\nAnd the way that a song can spread and go viral there is really key to the way the music industry works these days.\n\nSo artists like TikTok.\n\nThey like how it works.\n\nThey like that that's the place where their audience is.\n\nThey may not even know some of the details about the rights disputes, the copyright issues, the royalty issues.\n\nThey -- I think that they are generally behind Universal in trying to get a better deal from them, but they're very worried about being kicked off the platform and what impact that will have on their careers.\n\nJOHN YANG: Look at it from TikTok's point of view.\n\nHow important is it to TikTok to have this music on their site?\n\nBEN SISARIO: It's very important.\n\nAnd Universal is the biggest record company in the world.\n\nThey have Taylor Swift.\n\nThey have Olivia Rodrigo's.\n\nThey have Billie Eilish.\n\nThey have Drake.\n\nThey're not the only record company in the world, but they're a very, very big one.\n\nThey're very powerful.\n\nAnd they happen to have a lot of artists who do very, very well on TikTok.\n\nAnd part -- if you're TikTok, part of what you're pitching to consumers is the ability to get pretty much any song you want and use it in your own video.\n\nAnd users expect this.\n\nThey want this from TikTok.\n\nThat's part of the reason they use it, is that the proposition is they're going to have this material.\n\nSo they certainly want it.\n\nBut unlike something like Spotify, whose main purpose is simply just to have the songs, TikTok is a different kind of service.\n\nIt's one where users create their own content and they use music as part of that.\n\nSometimes, it's just in the background.\n\nSometimes, they're dancing, lip-syncing.\n\nSo there's a lot that people can do on TikTok even without these artists' music.\n\nBut I think TikTok is going to be concerned about pushing the limit of that and whether -- if this drags on for a long time, whether its users will start to get frustrated.\n\nJOHN YANG: If this does drag on for a long time, which side stands to lose the most, Universal or TikTok?\n\nBEN SISARIO: That is the big question.\n\nI mean, Universal says that TikTok's -- that revenues from TikTok only make up about 1 percent of their total.\n\nAnd I will bet it's actually a pretty small fraction of 1 percent, because TikTok generally doesn't pay a huge amount of money.\n\nTheir exact deals are confidential.\n\nBut it's well-known in the industry that this is a platform that provides tremendous exposure, can help a song become a hit that then makes more money elsewhere, but that TikTok itself is not the biggest generator of revenue.\n\nBut nobody wants to lose that promotional outlet.\n\nNobody wants to be out of the arena.\n\nI think Universal does stand to lose quite a bit in terms of access to the marketplace.\n\nI think it will hurt them with their artists if their stance winds up costing artists the promotion that they want.\n\nOn the other hand, TikTok relies on these kinds of deals with media companies to have the content there so that their users can play with it.\n\nI think both sides have a lot to lose here.\n\nJOHN YANG: TikTok was able to make a deal with Warner Music last year.\n\nWhy is it difficult now with Universal?\n\nBEN SISARIO: Well, we don't know all the terms of these deals.\n\nWe know that Warner said at the time they were very pleased with it.\n\nBut Universal has come out very aggressively.\n\nThey posted a public statement two days ago talking about how the terms were just unfair, unacceptable.\n\nAnd neither side here, neither Universal nor TikTok, will divulge any numbers.\n\nBut we know that Universal says that what TikTok was offering was unacceptable.\n\nI think control is another part of it.\n\nIt's not just dollars and cents.\n\nIt's control over the content, control over what can be done.\n\nThat's always a very big part of negotiations with digital services like TikTok.\n\nJOHN YANG: Ben Sisario of The New York Times.\n\nThanks very much, Ben.\n\nBEN SISARIO: Thank you."
