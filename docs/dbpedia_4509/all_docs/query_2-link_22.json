        "text": "It’s one of the most famous record label brands in the world, synonymous with classic recordings from the likes of Prince, R.E.M and Madonna – but from today (May 28), Warner Bros. Records is no more.\n\nInstead, the company formerly known as WBR – run by CEO & Co-Chairman Aaron Bay-Schuck and Co-Chairman and COO Tom Corson – has been rebranded simply as Warner Records, with a new logo (pictured).\n\nThe reason for the historic change?\n\nWarner Bros. Records was founded in March 1958 as an arm of Warner Bros. Pictures, whose “shield” logo was adopted by the label and has been used by the company ever since.\n\nIn 2004, when Warner Music Group was sold by Time Warner, splitting from the Warner Bros. movie company, it was agreed that Warner Bros. Records could continue to use the Warner Bros. name and logo for 15 years – a deal term which has now expired.\n\nToday’s name change arrives soon after Warner Bros. (now Warner Records) moved its HQ to a fancy new building in downtown LA’s Arts District.\n\nWarner Records now takes its place in a WMG frontline label family which also includes Atlantic Records, Parlophone and Elektra Music Group.\n\nWarner Music Group said today that Warner Records’ new circular icon – ‘suggesting a record, a sun, and a globe’ – is a ‘nod to the label’s past, present, and future.’\n\n“For the first time in the label’s history, we’ve had the opportunity to create a distinct, modern identity entirely of our own,” said Corson and Bay-Schuck.\n\n“The timing couldn’t be better, since we all feel the label is at a moment of reinvention that builds on our legacy, while moving into a future driven by fearlessness and creativity.\n\n“We have a growing roster of world-class artists, a rejuvenated team, and an incredible new location. It’s a new day for Warner Records, an iconic label that was born in the California sun, and is at home everywhere on earth.”\n\n“It’s a new day for Warner Records, an iconic label that was born in the California sun, and is at home everywhere on earth.”\n\nAaron Bay-Schuck and Tom Corson, Warner Records (Formerly Warner Bros Records)\n\n“We’re signing and developing the next generation of British artists to move global culture, so we wanted the Warner Records brand to have the power and freedom to mean different things to different people around the world,” said Warner Records UK President, Phil Christie.\n\n“A new logo isn’t meaningful on its own, and our label will always be defined by the originality of our artists, our music, and our people.”\n\nThe new Warner Records brand identity and logo were developed in partnership with Emily Oberman and her team at Pentagram, the world’s largest independently owned design studio.\n\nPentagram has worked with many prestigious companies and events such as Rolls Royce, London Fashion Week, Rotten Tomatoes, and Sundance Institute, and Sotheby’s, as well as music projects for the likes of The Rolling Stones and The National, among many others.Music Business Worldwide"
