The write up is brief, temple-wise, in a very easy to understand language to enable the readers to get a glimpse of the temples’ details as per Kashi Khand and Ling Puraan. The temples finding place in the book are those which find mention in Kashi Khand and Ling Puraan. It is an attempt to bring the details given in Puranas with the practical aspect (location of temple, approach etc.) While every effort has been made to keep the book easy to read as also interesting, the authors will certainly be pleased to receive any suggestions from readers in this regard. The authors request the readers to read the book, and worship as many temples as possible in Kashi so that they can seek the blessings of the Lord. While the location of the temple, approach etc. will not change, the timings of the temple may vary as per the season, the name of Priest or the Cell number may change over a period of time. Further, the author has spared no effort to give proper details. Wherever possible, photos are given. In some cases photography was not permitted by the concerned authorities. The author is open for any kind of correction pointed out by readers if there is any unintentional mistake. However, she does not take any responsibility for any unintentional mistakes. Also, the phone numbers of Priests given are only indicative and author is not responsible for performance of poojas etc. Readers may make their own enquiries.\n\n(LALITHA V.) G-1,Block-1,Varuna Enclave S-2/636, Club Road, Secrole, Varanasi. 09839061178\n\nBRIEF INTRODUCTION OF KASHI KHAND There are eighteen Puranas which have been associated with several mythological occurrences. 1. Brahma Puran 2. Padma Puran 3. Vishnu Puran 4. Shiva Puran 5. Bhagwat Puran 6. Narad Puran 7. Markandeya Puran 8. Agni Puran 9. Bhavishya Puran 10. Brahma Vaivarta Puran 11. Linga Puran 12. Varah Puran 13. Skanda Puran 14. Wama Puran 15. Koorma Puran 16. Matsya Puran 17. Garud Puran 18. Brahmand Puran. Of them, Skanda Purana is the largest and important one. Skanda is another name of Lord Kartikeya, son of Lord Shiva. In South India, Skanda is worshipped and called by various names i.e. Kandan, Murugan, Aaru Muga Bhagavan (six faced God) etc. Skanda Purana comprises of seven Khands (Divisions), namely Maheshwar Khand, Vaishnav Khand, Brahm Khand, KASHI KHAND, Avanti Kshetra Khand, Naagar Khand and Prabhas Khand. Of all the Khands, KASHI KHAND has been read and revered by various ancient people, which gives a detailed study of Kashi and its importance. Skanda Purana is said to contain more than 82000 slokas and Kashi Khand contains more than 13000 slokas. Kashi Khand is supposed to be the narration about Kashi by Lord Skanda (Kartikeya to Sage Agasthya) and this incident occurred probably in Sat Yug. However, the Purana was narrated by Sage Vyas in Dwapar Yug. In olden times the Vedas and the Shastras were narrated by Gurus and taught to Shishyas (Students), in other words passed on orally, till writing came into existence. Initially, there was a strong opposition to writing down the Vedas and the Puranas. Kashi Khand must have been written sometime in the 12 th century or even before that when writing Vedas and Puranas began to be accepted. But according to various texts inherent in Kashi Khand itself, the incidents narrated therein pertain to Sat Yug. At one place Lord Vishnu stated that he (Lord) was called as Aadi Madhav in Sat Yug, he should be worshipped as Ananda Madhav in Tretha Yug, he will present himself in Dwapar Yug as Shree Madhav. In Kali Yug the Lord should be known in the name of Bindu Madhav. The tense in those texts suggests that the events occurred in Sat Yug. There is no historic evidence as to when Kashi Khand was first penned. However, Pt. Kuber Nath Sukul in his book ―Varanasi Down the Ages‖ conclusively suggests that Kashi Khand came to be accepted as an authority by 14 th Century A.D. This shows that it must have been in existence, in written form before that. But in our opinion, Kashi Khand must have been in verbal form much much before that. Sage Vyas is credited with the creation of all Puranas and Skanda Purana (containing Kashi Khand) is one of them. Coming to Kashi Khand, Once, sage Vyas narrated the following tale to all the assembled sages'Once, while wandering about, sage Narad arrived at Vindhyachal mountain. He was received with great honour and respect by Vindhyachal mountain. But, when the time arrived for Narad to take his leave, he took a deep sigh, which made Vindhyachal extremely perplexed and he asked Narad if anything went wrong. Narad replied--' Your rival - Meru mountain is superior to you in every respect and this is the fact I am lamenting about. My deep sigh is just the indication of my worried state of mind.'\n\nVindhyachal mountain was inflicted with inferiority complex and started waiting for an opportunity when he could prove his superiority to Meru mountain. He thought—―Perhaps Narad was right for even Lord Surya has great respect for Meru's might and this is the reason why he circumambulates my adversary. If I am able to beat Meru in height then may be Lord Surya would start circumambulating me and this way I shall prove my superiority to Meru.‖ Now, Vindhyachal started increasing his height and in a short time its peaks became invisible. The fallout of this amazing incident proved to be quite catastrophic for the world because even Lord Surya was left stranded at a particular point in the horizon. As a result, one part of the earth became too hot for any life to exist. Similarly, the other half of the earth became unbearably cold. The time became standstill and everything went haywire in the world. All the deities became extremely worried and went to Lord Brahma to seek his help. Lord Brahma advised them to go to Kashi and seek help from Sage Agastya. The deities were pleased at their good fortune of getting a chance to visit Kashi. The deities, after reaching Kashi paid a visit to 'Manikarnika teerth' and took their bath. Subsequently, they went to Vishwanath temple and worshipped Lord Vishwanath. At last, they reached the hermitage of Agasthya where he was busy worshipping a self made Shivalinga. The entire hermitage was crowded with young pupils of Agastya. After the pleasantries having been exchanged, Sage Agastaya asked the deities about the purpose of their visit.\n\nAGASTYA ORDERS VINDHYA TO DIMINISH ITS SIZE When Agasthya learnt of the problem created by Vindhyachal, he agreed to help the deities despite being fully aware of the fact that once he left Kashi it would not be possible for him to see his dearest city once again at least in his present life. Before leaving for Vindhyachal, he sought permission from Lord Bhairav. He then reached the place where Vindhyachal had obstructed the path of Surya. Lopamudra, his wife accompanied him. When Vindhyachal saw Agastya staring angrily at him he became scared and immediately minimized his size. Sage Agastya was pleased that his objective had been achieved without making any effort but he knew quite well that once he left the place Vindhyachal would regain his mammoth size. So he decided to do something so that Vindhyachal could not obstruct the path of Surya. He worked out a plan according to which he instructed Vindhyachal to wait for him until he returned after accomplishing his pilgrimage. Vindhyachal agreed assuming that Agastya would return in a short time. Vindhyachal thanked his good fortune of escaping Agastya's wrath, which could otherwise have threatened his very existence. Sage Agastya then went away never to return and Vindhyachal kept on waiting for his arrival. This way, the path being cleared, Surya was once again able to move freely on its orbit without any problem and as a result normalcy returned to the world. On the other hand, Agastya who was not at all happy leaving his dearest Kashi was desperate to get there back as soon as possible. But, he knew that his wish was going to remain unfulfilled. While wandering about, he reached Kolhapur where he worshipped goddess Mahalaxmi. When goddess Mahalaxmi appeared, he asked her whether he would ever be able to reach Kashi in his present life. Goddess Mahalaxmi replied—―Your wishes will be fulfilled in the coming nineteenth dwapar, when you would incarnate as Vyas and would contribute a great deal to the propagation of the Vedas and Puranas. There is a sacrosanct place of Kartikeya not very far from here. Go there and pay your obeisance to Lord Kartikeya and he would unravel the mysterious aspects of Kashi to you.‖\n\nSage Agasthya and his wife Lopamudra then went to the mountain called Sri Shail, where Kartikeya lived at that time.\n\nKASHI -THE SACROSANCT PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE After travelling for sometime, both of them arrived near Sri Shail mountain. Pointing his finger towards the mountain, Agasthya told his wife--'One, who has a good fortune of seeing the peaks of this mountain, never takes a second birth.' Lopamudra replied in amazement--' If the sight of this mountain was capable of giving salvation then why do you long for Kashi?' Sage Agastya then went on to clarify that there were many other holy places capable of giving salvation. Prayag is one such place. It is capable of bestowing all the four 'Purusharth' on man viz. Dharma, Arth, Kaam and Moksha. Apart from Prayag, there are many more holy places like Naimisaranya, Kurukshetra, Gangadwar, Avanti, Ayodhya, Mathura, Dwarka, Badrikashram, Purushottam kshetra which are capable of giving salvation to a man. But none of these places can match Kashi because Kashi is incomparable.\n\nLORD KARTIKEYA DESCRIBES THE MAJESTY OF KASHI Sage Agasthya and his wife Lopamudra circumambulated Sri Shail Mountain and climbed up Lohit mountain where they found Lord Kartikeya. Both of them eulogized Kartikeya by singing vedic hymns in his praise. Lord Kartikeya was extremely pleased with their devotion and said- O revered sage! You can understand Kashi's importance by the fact that, though I am capable of reaching any place according to my wish but still, here I am doing this austere penance to attain Kashi. I must confess that I have not been successful in my efforts till date. If any body thinks that he can attain Kashi just by undergoing austerities then he is totally wrong. Kashi can never be attained until and unless one has the blessing of Lord Mahadeva. And one who is fortunate enough to have reached Kashi must under no circumstances leave it till he is alive. O Agastya! You are blessed one because you had the good fortune of residing at Kashi. Please allow me to touch your body, which has acquired holiness due to its proximity to Kashi.' Having said this, Kartikeya touched different parts of Agastya's body as if he were touching the sacred soil of Kashi. Kashi Khand goes on to describe various aspects of Kashi in detail, the various temples and deities as also how they came into existence. **************************************************************\n\nABOUT LING PURAAN Ling Puraan is one of the 18 Maha Puraans scripted by the great Sage Vyas. This is made up of two parts viz. Poorva Bhaag and Uttar Bhaag, containing 108 chapters and 55 chapters respectively. Chapter 92 of Poorva Bhaag covers about the importance of Avi Mukta Kashi Kshetra and Lord Vishveshwar. However, it is relevant to mention here that Pundit Lakshmidhar Bhatt, a great scholar, was the Prime Minister in the Kingdom of Raja Govind Chandra of Kanya Kubja. He has written many great epics among which ―Kritya Kalpataru‖ is one of the renowned. In this great epic, Pt. Bhatt mentions about one supplement to Ling Puraan which was known as Varanasi Maahaatmya, comprising of 16 chapters. (Source ―Kalyan‖ from Gita Press, Gorakhpur). Kritya Kalpataru was a renowned epic composed during the 12 th Century. Thus, the Ling Puraan which existed at that time not only mentions about Kashi (Varanasi) in the 92 nd Chapter, but also extensively covers Varanasi in the supplement containing 16 chapters. However, the present day Ling Puraan books mention about Varanasi in the 92 nd Chapter of Poorva Bhag only and the supplement is missing. There have been instances of some drastic changes in other Puraans also. The original Sanskrit Texts and some chapters may have undergone some changes. In the present book, the author has sought to take reference in respect of various Shiv Lings in Kashi from Kashi Khand and Ling Puraan (both from 92 nd Chapter and the supplement). According to Ling Puraan, Chapter 92, Shlok 42 and Shlok 104-107, Lord Shiva tells Parvaty that the Lord will never abandon Kashi, therefore, this area is known as Avi Mukta Kshetra. Those devotees who worship the Lord and die in Kashi will attain Moksha, they will have no rebirth. Among all the important religious places, Kashi is the most pious place (Shlok No. 46). A person, according to his desires, may lead his life, may eat, sleep and play but if he dies in this Avi Mukta Kshetra, he will attain Moksha (Shlok 50 ibid). According to Lord Shiva, if a person is travelling to Kashi for performing religious deeds, the punya starts accuring to him when he enters an area which may be even 20 kms. away from the centre of the city (Supplement to Ling Puraan). According to Chapter 92, Shlok 120 to 127, on all Ashtami and Chaturdashi days pooja for Lord Shiva is conducted in Varanasi which is very auspicious. On Surya and Chandra Grahan days and during Shravan, Kartik Months, it is very auspicious to take bath in Ganges and perform poojs of the Lord. A devotee who takes bath in Ganges and worships Lord Shiva in Varanasi derives the benefits equivalent to the benefits accruing out of performing all Yagnas. Among all those religious places whether in the earth or in heaven, Kashi is the most auspicious place. (Shlok 140 to 143). A devotee who performs abhishek of Shiv Ling in Kashi with ghee (clarified butter) from Cow’s Milk, alongwith other abhishek items and Ganges water will derive benefits which will normally accrue out of performing hundred yagyas and performing Lakh poojas. (Shlok 171-174). After performing abhishek, the devotee should do pooja with vilva leaves (Shlok 175-177). Chanting of Rudram in front of any of the Lings in Kashi will yield multiple benefits.\n\nKASHI YATRA PERFORMED BY SOUTH INDIANS\n\nAll Hindus consider it very auspicious to visit Kashi at least once in their life time. South Indians undertake Kashi Yatra wherein rituals in three places viz. Allahabad, Kashi and Gaya are involved. Given below, in brief are the rituals generally performed in Kashi.\n\ni)\n\nMaha Prayaschittam.\n\nii)\n\nMaha Sankalpam\n\niii)\n\nManikarnika Snanam\n\niv)\n\nPanchaganga Pindam\n\nv)\n\nGanga Pooja/Dampati Pooja\n\nvi)\n\nVishwanatha Abhishekham\n\nvii)\n\nAnnapoorna/Vishalakshi Archanai\n\nviii)\n\nKala Bhairava Samaradhanai\n\nix) Worship of Panch Kowdi Mata temple which is located opposite Durga Temple on the way to Kabir Nagar Colony. (This temple, however, does not find any mention in Kashi Khand).\n\nThe above rituals may normally take 2-3 days. Three days would be ideal and if only 2 days are allotted, some rites or rituals might have to be cut short. Regarding importance of Manikarnika Snanam and Panchaganga Pindam, readers may please refer to our write up of five important ghats elsewhere. Regarding the temples mentioned above, devotees may kindly go through the respective temples’ write up.\n\n************************************************************\n\nVARIOUS PEETHS IN KASHI\n\nSkanda Puran, Kashi Khand, Chapter 79 mentions various Peeths/Shakti Peeths. For benefit of devotees we mention here that Peeths are Seats of Vital energy and if a devotee worships in these places he will derive multiple benefits as compared to worshipping at other places.

In Chapter 27, 28 and 29 Kashi Khand has amply eulogized River Ganga. Supreme Sage (Raja Rishi) King Bhageerath was suffering from a curse of Brahmin. He underwent intense penance to Lord Shiva and brought River Ganga to earth. After the deluge, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty appeared on the earth and Lord Vishnu also manifested in Kashi. (Kindly refer to Manikarnika). With his Sudarshan Chakra, Lord Vishnu dug a huge Pond and filled it with his divine perspiration. This Kund came to be known as Chakrapushkarini Teerth. Lord Shiva’s jewel from the ear tops fell in the Chakrapushkarini Teerth and then onwards the Pond used to be called Manikarnika (jewel is referred to as Mani and Karnika means ear). When river Ganga started flowing through Kashi, the Avimukta Kshetra became all the more pious. River Ganga possesses the religious power of all the Sacred Ponds, Rivers and Lakes in the world put together. A devotee who bathes for once in River Ganga derives the benefit of bathing in all the Sacred Ponds and performing all rituals elsewhere. It is believed that a person may take his bath anywhere, but at the time of bathing if he utters the words ―Ganga, Ganga‖, he derives the benefit of bathing in Holy Ganga. River Ganga destroys the devotee’s sins committed knowingly or unknowingly. A devotee who always thinks about Holy Ganga while walking, sitting, praying, concentrating, eating or sleeping attains freedom from bondage. A devotee who religiously performs the rituals for his forefathers in Holy Ganga makes his forefathers very happy and they remain satisfied for many decades. Just as worshipping one Shiv Ling gives the benefit of worshipping the entire world, taking bath in River Ganga gives the benefit of bathing in all the Sacred Ponds in the world.\n\nA devotee who bathes in River Ganga and worships Shiv Ling, derives much more benefits than undergoing various rituals like religious fasting, donation, intense penance and austerity, Havans (rituals with fire etc.). Wantingly or unwantingly, if a person touches fire, he will get burnt; similarly wantingly or unwantingly if a devotee bathes in Holy Ganga, the river swallows all his sins.\n\nA devotee gets some amount of Punya (purification acquired by virtuous deeds) by bathing in Ganga, he will derive the same amount of Punya by guiding or directing another person to bathe in Ganga. By bathing once in River Ganga, a devotee derives the benefit of performing Aswa Medha Yagya (horse sacrifice ritual). If a person bathes in Holy Ganga for one month, he will reside with Lord Indra. If a fortunate person bathes in Holy Ganga for one year, he will reach Lord Vishnu’s abode. If a sincere devotee bathes in River Ganga during his entire life, he attains Moksha and highest order in life. For bathing in Ganga one need not observe auspicious time (Muhurat) etc., because no such rules apply for Holy Ganga. If a person, with sincere devotion to his forefathers, bathes in Ganga and performs Abhishek of Shiv Ling with Holy Ganga Water, does a great service to his forefathers and even if they are residing in Hell (on account of their evil deeds etc.), they will be pushed to Heaven. (Abhishek means pouring of Holy water or any other ingredient like milk on Lord’s idol, Shiv Ling etc.). Any kind of donation, alms or gifts given on the Banks of Holy Ganga will yield multiple results. If a devotee donates one cow and calf to a deserving person, he will certainly reach Heaven. Besides, during his life time, he will never face any shortage of wealth and food grains. On the banks of River Ganga, if a devotee donates a small quantity of Gold to a learned Brahmin, he will be respected and worshipped wherever he lives. In the Kashi Yatra undertaken by South Indians, a final ritual is Ganga Pooja and Dampati (married couple) Pooja. Ganga Pooja as the words imply is worship/prayers to Holy River Ganga and in Dampati Pooja, the devotee honours a married couple who have dedicated their lives to Kashi. Among other things, a small amount of Gold is donated to such couple. Bathing in Holy Ganga on the birth day will absolve the devotee of all his sins. Taking bath in the river in Vaisaka Month, Shravan Month and Kartik Month will yield multiple results. Amavasya is indeed is a good day for such deed. On all Sankarantis, taking bath in Holy Ganga will yield benefit which is thousand times the normal day. (There are twelve Rashis or houses in the Galaxy, starting from Mesha, Rishabh and upto Mithun. When Surya enters Mesha Rashi, it is Mesha Sankaranti, if it enters Rishabh, it is Rishabh Sankaranti. The most important Sankaranti is Makar Sankaranti when Surya enters Makar Rasi). The Sankaranti days generally fall around 14th or 15th of each month. This can be ascertained from the religious almanac (Panchang). At the time of Solar or Lunar Eclipse, if a devotee bathes in Ganga he will derive the benefits which will be One Lakh times the normal day. In Chapter 28, Lord Skanda narrates what Lord Shiva told Lord Vishnu about the religious powers of River Ganga. When a devotee performs rituals for his fathers with Til (black sesame seeds), his fore fathers gently enter heaven (if they are already not there). If they are already there, they get better positions. They will stay in heaven for that many number of years, depending on the number of Til Seeds as have been used in the rituals. His forefathers may have committed so many sins which the devotee may not know, they may be facing the ordeals in various parts of Hell like Kumbi Pakam, Rauravam, Tamisram etc. But if a devotee performs their rituals in River Ganga as prescribed, they are certain to get released from the Hell and slowly but surely travel towards heaven. River Ganga is pure and carrying religious power, but her power increased in the Holy city of Kashi where she is Uttara Vahini (flowing northwards). When Ganga entered with a force in Kashi, Lord Shiva threw his Trishul (Trident) just before the entry point of Kashi, whereby the river somewhat slowed down. Ganga also promised Lord Shiva that she will always remain in\n\nKashi and serve its denizens. Therefore, Ganga is perennial in Kashi whereas in other places, it is not so. If a person dies in Kashi he attains Moksha. If a person dies in other places, but his body is cremated in Kashi then also he attains Moksha. Similarly, a person may have died and cremated elsewhere but if his ashes and bones (Asthi) are immersed in Holy Ganga, he will reach heaven. The benefits of immersing bones and ashes in Ganges have been covered elsewhere. If a person stays far away from Kashi and desires to have the benefit of bathing in Ganga, Kashi Khand has prescribed Ganga Sahasranam. (Sahasra means thousand, nam means name). These are thousand different names by which Holy River Ganga has been eulogized. Therefore, South Indians who perform Kashi Yatra generally stay for minimum two days or even three days in Varanasi (Kashi). One ritual is Madhyannika Manikarnika Snanam (bathing in Manikarnika in the Noon) and other ritual is Pinda Daan (rituals for forefathers) in five Ghats viz. Assi, Dasaswamedh, Manikarnika, Panchganga and Varuna. While performing the Pancha Ghatta Pindam (ritual in five important Ghats), some Yatris take bath only once and in the remaining Ghats, they merely sprinkle water on their heads. The authors appeal to all devotees, who visit Kashi for their religious rituals, to sincerely bathe in all the five Ghats and take Madhyannika Manikarnika Snanam with all divinity. At the time of performing these rituals, the authors request them to think of their departed father/parents (as the case may be) and forefathers. Given above is the brief write of River Ganga. If we give a word by word translation of River Ganga’s divinity, it may consume more than 40 pages.\n\nIMPORTANT TEERTHS AND BATHING PLACES MENTIONED IN KASHI KHAND WHICH ARE STILL EXISTENT AND BEING VISITED BY DEVOTEES PADODAK TEERTH Lord Shiva deputed sixty four Yoginis to create disturbance in Kashi and when they did not return, he sent Lord Surya, then Lord Brahma and Lord Vinayak. When these deities did not return, Lord Shiva sent Lord Vishnu to Kashi to accomplish the same mission. (For details, kindly refer Divodaseshwar), Lord Vishnu was very happy with getting such divine instructions from Lord Shiva. He prayed to Lord Shiva and accompanied by Goddess Mahalakshmi, he travelled in his vehicle Garuda and reached Kashi. For going to Kashi one need not wait for a proper muhurat because anytime is good time for this pious task. On reaching Kashi, Lord Vishnu saw the entire kshetra with wide eyes. He then went to a place where the Holy River Varuna joins River Ganga and washed his hands and feet. The place where Lord Vishnu’s Charan (feet referred to with respect) were washed came to be known as PADODAK TEERTH. According to Skanda Puran, Kashi Khand, Chapter 58, devotees who bathe in Padodak Teerth will be cleansed of all their sins accumulated over 7 births, including the present life. A devotee who performs Shraaddh (rituals for his forefathers), does a service for twentyone generations of his forefathers. Performing Shraaddh at Padodak Teerth in Kashi is equivalent to performing Shraaddh at Gaya. A devotee who takes a holy dip in Padodak Teerth, consumes Padodak water and gives Padodak water to any other person will be blessed by Lord Vishnu and he will not encounter Hell. A person who consumes water from Padodak Teerth which is Charan Amrit (nectar from the Lotus Feet of Lord Vishnu) need not have fear of rebirth in this world. Devotees are advised by Kashi Khand to take Padodak Teerth in Shankh (sea conch) and perform abhishek of Lord and consume such water. Such devotees will not have any fear of apamrityu (untimely death). Further, they will always be remembered for their good actions. Presently Padodak Teerth is not existent in the form of any river/rivulet or pond. However, there is a Padodak Koop (Well) situated inside the temple premises of Trilochaneshwar. At some point the well was constructed and one hand pump has been installed there. The water is very pure and clean. Here one point needs to be mentioned. The events mentioned in Kashi Khand date back to several Yugs (aeons) before. Probably at that time, Varuna river might have been very wide and must have covered a vast area. Presently, the river is very narrow and quite away from Trilochaneshwar. It looks like a streamlet at present. Devotees visiting Trilochaneshwar have high divine respect for water from Padodak Koop and on Akshaya Tritheeya day, people visit this temple in huge numbers and consume water from Padodak Koop as Charan Amrit. *************************************************************\n\nPANCHA GANGA (PANCHA NADA TEERTH) Long back there was a highly learned Sage named Vedasira, who belonged to Bhrigu family. Once he was engrossed in intense prayers and one beautiful Apsara (celestial damsel) named Suchi happened to pass in front of him. On seeing her, the Sage lost control over his passions and there started physical reactions within his body. The Apsara, Suchi, became very much afraid that the Sage might curse her. She pleaded innocence and asked the Sage to forgive her. The Sage, after much ponderation, told Suchi that knowingly or unknowingly she had raised the inner passions of the Sage and she should follow it to the logical conclusions. The Sage was omnipotent. Without engaging in any tangible contact with the Apsara, he made her conceive his child. In due course, she delivered a beautiful girl. Suchi soon came to the Ashram of the Sage, left the child there and went back to her place. The Sage was very happy at seeing his girl child, who was named by him as Dhootpapa. The Sage reared the girl with great love and affection. When Dhootpapa reached the age of eight, the Sage started getting a bit worried in order to find a suitable match for her marriage. He had a frank discussion about this with Dhootpapa and the latter replied that she would like to marry a person according to her choice. She stated that the person desired by her would be highly respected, would have all the qualities expected of him and will take care of her in a proper way. The Sage agreed to this and told the girl that to get her wishes fulfilled, she had to undertake intense prayers and worship the Lord. Dhootpapa agreed to this and started her intense prayers, in the process going without food for several days. At times of extreme thirst she used to drink a drop of water and even during extreme winters, she continued her prayers. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 59 has described in detail the intensity of her prayers). Finally Lord Brahma appeared before her and blessed her with all happiness. He told her that she was very pure and all the three and half crore sacred waters in the world would reside in the root of the hairs of her body. Lord Brahma further said that Dhootpapa would be venerated as pure and much more sacred than all the Teerths (sacred waters) in the world. After accomplishing her prayers, Dhootpapa returned to the Ashram of the Sage. One day when she was playing in the garden, Lord Dharam Raj approached her and being enchanted by her beauty, proposed to her. Dhootpapa insisted that he should speak to her father, but Dharam Raj had other thoughts. The heated discussions went on for some time and Dharam Raj cursed her that she would turn into a statue. Dhootpapa in turn cursed that Dharam Raj would be converted into a male river named Dharma Nada. Dhootpapa went inside the hermitage and told her father about what had happened. The Sage, with his divine powers, gathered as to what had happened and asked her to get converted into a metallic statue instead of a stone statue. In due course, the metallic statue would melt and form a river. He further stated that Dharam Raj had all the qualities of being her husband and once Dhootpapa became a river, she would join Dharma Nada. The statue of Dhootpapa soon melted and got converted into a river by the same name. As she had got blessings of Lord Brahma, Dhootpapa became very sacred. At the place where Dhootpapa river conjoined Dharma Nada, Lord Surya, in his form as Mayukh Aditya, was\n\nundergoing intense prayers. Due to the intensity of the prayers, his Kiran (sun rays) became extremely hot and unbearable. Soon, the perspiration/sweat generated out of the heat started flowing in the form of a river which was called Kirana River. Kirana River joined Dhootpapa river at a sacred point which were joined by Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers. Thus, these five sacred rivers viz. Dhootpapa, Kirana, Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati joined together and assumed the name of Panchanada Teerth and later on Pancha Ganga. Taking bath in Pancha Ganga is considered highly auspicious. Taking bath just once in Panch Ganga is considered to be equivalent to taking bath in Prayag (Allahabad) for one full month of Magha. A devotee who takes bath in Panch Ganga and performs Shraaddh Karma for his forefathers will be doing a great service to them and will attain Moksha in his life. All the sins committed by him knowingly or unknowingly will be washed away. While performing Shraaddh at Pancha Ganga, the devotee’s forefathers will remain extremely happy for as many years, as the number of Til seeds (black sesame seeds) fall in the river. In other words, if 50 Til seeds fall into the river in the process of Pinda Danam, the forefathers will remain happy for 50 years. Whatever benefit accrues to a devotee for performing great Yagyas like Raja Suya Yagya or Aswa Medha Yagya, the devotee will derive several times more benefit by taking one holy dip in Pancha Ganga. Kashi Khand has described in the detail the good effects arising out of taking bath in Panch Ganga. In the month of Kartik (October 23 – November 20 – roughly), if a person takes bath in Panch Ganga, he will derive the benefits accruing out of performing Tapas for several long years in other places or Yugs. During the entire Kartik month, devout Hindus light lamps which are placed in a basket and suspended at a great height over bamboo poles. This is a ritual considered to be very auspicious. During the wee hours of the dawn, the votaries (devoted followers), who come for a Holy dip can see along the ghats an array of dotted lights sifting through the holes of the suspended baskets which present a mesmerizing and spectacular sight. Kartik Poornima is a very auspicious day for taking bath in Panch Ganga. In fact during the entire Kartik Month there is a huge crowd of people taking bath in Panch Ganga just before or during Sunrise. It is believed that even Devas and deities come to Panch Ganga at this time to take bath. *************************************************************\n\nDASASWAMEDH Lord Shiva was in Mandarachal and Kashi was ruled by a very pious and religious King named Divodas. In his Kingdom every one was very happy and there was all round prosperity. He had reached an understanding with Lord Brahma that as long as he was ruling, Devas and other celestial beings should stay away from Kashi and should not create any interference in Kashi. Lord Brahma more or less agreed to it but on one condition that King Divodas should prove to be an excellent administrator and all people living in Kashi and visiting Kashi should be treated well in their religious pursuits. The King agreed and accordingly gave excellent governance. Lord Shiva was very upset at being away from Kashi for a long time and he wanted to make King Divodas commit some mistake. Accordingly, he sent sixty four Yoginis and Lord Surya in succession. But they did not accomplish the task. (Kindly refer Divodaseshwar). Lord Shiva then sent Lord Brahma to Kashi to create disturbances. Lord Brahma tried his level best but he was very much satisfied with the efficient way in which King Divodas was ruling Kashi. To test the King, Lord Brahma expressed his desire to perform Aswa Medha Yagya and the King gave every thing in his command to Lord Brahma. Lord Brahma performed not one but ten Aswa Medha Yagyas (Horse Sacrifice rituals). The smoke arising out of the huge fire of the Yagya reached the sky and assumed a light blue colour. To this day, the sky is maintaining the same colour which people refer to as ―Sky Blue‖.\n\nThe Teerth nearby took the name of Dasaswamedh Teerth. Prior to advent of Lord Brahma, the Teerth was known by the name of Rudra Sarovar. Now the bathing place has come to be known as Dasaswamedh Ghat. Lord Brahma installed Shiv Lings known as Dasaswamedheshwar and Brahmeshwar and started worshipping Lord Shiva. A devotee who takes a holy dip in Dasaswamedh, performs all religious activities like Japam (repitition of a set of religious texts called Mantras), Daan (donation with a religious end use), Homam (rituals with fire), chanting of Vedas, Pooja, Tarpan etc. will derive maximum benefits.\n\nKashi Khand further states that Annadanam (free feeding) performed at Dasaswamedh will yield multiple benefits. A devotee who takes a holy dip in Dasaswamedh Teerth (now Dasaswamedh Ghat) on the first day after Amavasya in Aashad month (June 22-July 20), will see his sins totally getting removed from him. A devote who bathes in Dasaswamedh and worships Dasaswamedheshwar will be free from all sins committed knowingly or unknowingly. Kashi Khand has recommended that the devotees should bathe in Dasaswamedh in Aashad month for the entire fortnight starting from the first day after Amavasya. A devotee who bathes in Dasaswamedh gets the benefit of performing Aswa Medha Yagya. In TV or video clippings Varanasi’s river ghat is shown with lot of brown coloured umbrella like structures, the place is Dasaswamedh Ghat. Of late, one important function has started in Varanasi viz. Ganga Aarti. A group of pundits perform Aarti for River Ganga (who is worshipped as Maa Ganga), daily in the evening at around 7.15 p.m. The entire performance lasts for about 45 minutes and there is a huge crowd. It is worth watching this aarti sitting in a boat. During the time of aarti, the entire area turns into a divine and pious environment.\n\n*************************************************************\n\nMANIKARNIKA According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 26, at the time of Maha Pralay (deluge) there was absolute destruction every where and darkness prevailed all over. There was no direction anywhere, no one to speak, cry or listen. At that time the ever pervading Brahm existed and the omnipotent Lord Almighty Shiva manifested himself alongwith Goddess in the form of Shakti. Lord Shiva addressed himself as Purush and Goddess as Shakti Roopee stree (feminine embodiment of energy). As far as land is concerned, only the area representing Pancha Krosha Kshetra existed. (Pancha Krosha means five Krosha, again Krosha is a measurement of distance which is approximately equal to 2 miles). Taking a mid point, a radius of 10 miles was the Pancha Krosha Kshetra. Even during the worst time of deluge, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty did not leave this place (Pancha Krosha Kshetra), therefore this place is known as Avi Mukta Kshetra. Lord Shiva desired that every one in the Kshetra (region or area) should be happy and the place was called as Ananda Kanan (Anandavan). Lord Shiva cast a soft and affectionate glance to his left side wherefrom a handsome man appeared. Since this person qualified as Uttama Purush, he was known as Purushottam. Lord Shiva was glad and he proclaimed that Purushottam was none other than Maha Vishnu. Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu entered Anand Van where Lord Vishnu immediately engaged himself in intense prayers.\n\nWith his Sudarshan Chakra, Lord Vishnu dug a huge Pond and filled it with his divine perspiration. This Kund came to be known as Chakrapushkarini Teerth. Lord Vishnu was deeply engrossed in his prayers and Lord Shiva was moved by the former’s sincerity. He requested Lord Vishnu to get up and ask for divine boon. Lord Vishnu desired that both Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty should always be available to accept his (Lord Vishnu’s) prayers. Lord Shiva’s jewel from the ear tops fell in the Chakrapushkarini Teerth and then onwards the Pond came to be called Manikarnika (jewel is referred to as Mani and Karnika means ear). Lord Vishnu further stated that the entire area is shining with a bright divine light with great radiance and, therefore, this Kshetra (region) will be called as ―Kashi‖. (Even now Kashi is referred to as City of Light).\n\nKashi Khand further states that whatever Punya accrues to a devotee by taking bath in all sacred teerths all over the world, the same punya will be earned by him by just taking one dip in Manikarnika. A devotee who religiously takes bath in Manikarnika will attain Moksha and there is absolutely no doubt about it. A devotee who takes holy dip in Manikarnika with all devotion, performs rituals for his forefathers and offers prayers to the Almighty will derive the benefits of performing various Yagyas. Lord Vishnu describes various important Teerths in Kashi Khand, Chapter 61. All the sacred teerths (sacred waters) come to Manikarnika during the noon time for taking bath. While all sacred teerths are capable of cleansing the sins, Manikarnika Teerth tops them all. All those sacred teerths derive their strength from Manikarnika Teerth. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty themselves come to Manikarnika during noon for taking bath. Lord Vishnu himself comes to Manikarnika during the above time alongwith Goddess Lakshmi from Vaikunth to take bath. According to Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma also visits Manikarnika at the above time for his bath. Therefore, Maadhyannika Snanam (Bath at noon) at Manikarnika is considered very auspicious and this is a part and parcel of Kashi Yatra being performed by South Indians. Not only the above Lords, but Lord Indra, other Devas as also great Nag Rajas (Serpent Kings) like Vasuki etc. visit Manikarnika during noon for their holy bath. A devotee who chants one Gayatri Mantra at Manikarnika gets the benefit of chanting ten thousand Gayatri Mantras at other places. A devotee who performs Homam with one Ahuti at Manikarnika gets the benefit of performing Agnihotra Homam for the entire life. (Agnihotra Homam is performed only by those great Pundits who have performed great Yagam called Soma Yagam). Lord Vishnu has described the boundary of Manikarnika Kshetra: In the south the area extends upto Ganga Keshav (presently Lalita Ghat), in the north Harishchandra Mandap (roughly near Sankata Ghat), River Ganga to the east and Swarga Dwari to the west (Brahmanal Chauraha – cross road). According to Lord Vishnu, devotees who take bath in Manikarnika and worship Manikarnikeshwar will not see mother’s womb again (meaning – there will be no rebirth). Presently Manikarnika Ghat is practically a cremation ground. However, if a devotee proceeds in a boat slightly towards the north (towards Panch Ganga), he will reach Chakrapushkarini Kund. Since the Manikarnika area is quite vast (as described in the previous para), devotees take bath in the river adjacent to Chakrapushkarini Kund. There is an inscription near the above Kund(courtesy Distt. Administration) which gives a brief history of Lord Vishnu’s association with Chakrapushkarini Kund. Kashi Khand, Chapter 33, mentions that Raja Harishchandra (who was known for his truthfulness) sold himself at this place to safeguard upholding his ideals. *************************************************************\n\nASSI SANGAM Towards the southern part of the Holy city is the Assi Ganga confluence. Assi has been mentioned as a river once upon a time but now it is virtually a streamlet. According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 30, Kashi is a Mukti Kshetra. Long back Yama, Indra and Agni saw the devotees in Kashi engaged in religious activities and they drew boundaries for Kashi. All the above Lords, with a view to destroy Asatya (falsehood) and negative thoughts in the Holy City, created Assi River. According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 46, a devotee who takes bath in Assi Ganga Sangam and performs rituals for his forefathers does a great service to them. By bathing in Assi Ganga Sangam, the devotee gets the benefit of taking bath in all sacred teerths.\n\nKashi Khand has references of Assi Ganga Sangam in various chapters. In various references to Lolark, it is stated to be near the Assi Ganga Sangam, whereas in the present days, Lolark is a bit away. This leads one to believe that the religious/spiritual influence of Assi Ganga Sangam (Confluence of two rivers Assi and Ganga) must have been very wide. The place where two rivers conjoin is usually considered to be very auspicious. In fact the name Varanasi was coined as that Kshetra which is in between two great rivers Varuna and Assi. At present Assi Ghat is a very wide area and offers a very beautiful appearance. Many devotees visit this place and it is virtually the only place where four wheelers can take them as near as to Ganga as possible and a parking lot is also there. As per religious importance Assi Ganga Sangam area covers a vast stretch even surpassing the present day Tulsi Ghat. The South Indian pilgrims who undertake Pancha Ghatta Pindam (Assi, Dasaswamedh, Manikarnika, Panch Ganga and Varuna), generally bathe near Tulsi Ghat which, as mentioned above, comes under the religious sanction at Assi Ganga Sangam. They may take a cue and bathe near Assi Ghat. Ganga Aarti is being conducted in Assi Ghat also, which is a visual treat. *************************************************************\n\nVARUNA SANGAM According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 30, Kashi is a Mukti Kshetra. Long back Yama, Indra and Agni witnessed the devotees in Kashi engaged in religious activities and they drew boundaries for Kashi. All the above Lords, with a view to destroy Asatya (falsehood) and bad thoughts in the Holy City, created Assi River. Then they created Varuna River and made it run through the other end of Kashi. As per the directions of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu proceeded towards Kashi (kindly refer to Padodak Teerth). On reaching Kashi, Lord Vishnu saw the entire kshetra with bird’s eye view. He then went to a place where the Holy Rivers Varuna and Ganga conjoined and washed his hands and feet. The place where Lord Vishnu’s Charan (feet referred to with respect) were washed came to be known as PADODAK TEERTH. According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 58, devotees who bathe in Padodak Teerth will cleanse all their sins accumulated over 7 births, including the present life.\n\nAt the time when the events mentioned in Kashi Khand must have occurred (in Sat Yug), Varuna must have extended upto the present day Trilochan, because the place where Lord Vishnu washed his feet near Varuna Ganga Sangam is Padodak, which is now existing in the form of a well in Trilochaneshwar temple. Kashi Khand at several places has mentioned the importance of Varuna river. It is believed that devotees who bathe in Varuna-Ganga sangam and worship Varuna Sangameshwar will be blessed with all sorts of prosperity. South Indian pilgrims who undertake Kashi yatra perform Pancha Ghatta Pindam and one of the places identified for the purpose is Varuna. However, the fifth place where they do the ritual is Trilochan Ghat. This must be because, the area of religious influence of Varuna must be extending upto Trilochan. However, the devotees are advised to take a boat ride upto Varuna Ganga Sangam and in the process they can also have darshan of Adi Keshav temple alongwith other deities therein. *************************************************************\n\nPILPILA TEERTH Kashi Khand, at various places, mentions one important Teerth called as Pilpila Teerth. During Kashi Khand days, this Teerth must have been very big but now it is existing in the form of a Koop (Well). Pilpila Koop is located near Trilochaneshwar temple. The authors visited the place on Akshay Triteeya day (a very auspicious day when many people take bath in the Koop). The authors took bath with the water drawn from the well and were given to understand that there is a huge crowd on the above auspicious day. On Akshay Triteeya day, taking bath in Pilpila Teerth and having darshan of Trilochaneshwar and Madhusudan (Vaman Keshav) is considered very auspicious and authors were lucky enough to go through the pious ritual as mentioned above. During the other days, the place remains open for about one hour or so and at times it remains closed also. *************************************************************\n\nVIMAL TEERTH Vimal Teerth is an important teerth and the details have been mentioned under Kapardeeshwar. Now the Teerth is known as Pisachmochan Talab and is probably the biggest Teerth available in Varanasi. Devotees even now take bath in the Talab (Pond) on auspicious days.\n\n*************************************************************\n\nLOLARK KUND Kashi Khand has attached great importance to Lolark Kund mainly because of presence of Lolark Aditya (Chapter 46) (one of the 12 Aditya Temples of Varanasi). Of all Teerths, Lolark has been given great importance. Taking bath in Lolark Teerth (now Lolark Kund), performing pooja etc., at this place is considered to be very beneficial to devotees.\n\nImportant days for Lolark Kund as observed by the devotees are Margsirsh month, Shukla Paksha Shashti or Saptmi (conjoined with Sunday), Magha month, Shukla Paksha Saptmi (Rath Saptmi). Our enquiries reveal that no one takes regular bath in this Kund. However, there is a huge crowd on special days, as above. Devotees come to this Kund to worship Lolark Aditya. The approach to the Kund is well constructed with steps leading down from three places. On the fourth side, the kund takes the shape of a well. Devotees who visit Kashi, can combine visit of this place alongwith Durga Devi temple which is about 1 km. in proximity.\n\nGYAN VAPI According to Kashi Khand one Digpal named Eeshan came to Kashi and with his Trishul dug a Vapi which came to be known as Gyan Vapi. He then started worshipping Lord Shiva. The water from this Vapi (Well) is capable of giving knowledge to the devotees. This well is located near the Gyan Vapi Mosque on the way to Vishwanath Temple. Kashi Khand has described the power of water from Gyan Vapi in Chapters 33 and 34. One Princess Kalawati was presented a map of Kashi and when she happened to touch the Gyan Vapi in the map with her finger, she could recollect the events that had occurred in her previous birth. Elsewhere Kashi Khand has amply described the good effects of Gyan Vapi water in various chapters. A devotees who takes bath in Gyan Vapi and performs rituals for his forefathers will make them extremely happy and even if they are rotting in hell, they are certain to reach the heaven. However, in the present day scenario, with heavy police patrolling, it may not be possible to freely engage in such activities. However, devotees can have darshan of the Gyan Vapi, take some water therefrom for sprinkling over their heads or consumption as Prasad. A person who consumes water from Gyan Vapi will have no rebirth (Ling Puraan, chapter 12 of the supplement. *************************************************************\n\nSHIV LINGS OF KASHI AADI MAHADEV (MAHADEV LING) Lord Kartikeya was describing various important Shiv Lings in his narration in Kashi Khand (Chapter 68).In Satya Yug, in response to devout prayers by Devas and Rishis, one Ling emerged from the Bhoomi and manifested itself. This came to be called Mahadev Ling. This Ling gets the credit of making Kashi a Mukti Kshetra (region free from bondage). A person who peforms pooja and archana with sincere devotion at this temple will reach Shiva’s abode after death, even if he happens to die in any place other than Kashi. A devotee who sincerely prays to Lord Mahadev in Kashi, gets the punya equivalent to praying all Lings available in the entire world. A person who performs pooja at least once at Mahadev temple, will find a place in Lord Shiva’s abode after death (Kashi Khand, ibid). Special importance is attached to the offering of Yagyopaveeth (Sacred Thread) at Mahadev temple on Chaturdasi Day after Amavasya during Shravan Month (July-August) (Kashi Khand, ibid). Presently the temple is known as Aadi Mahadev Temple.\n\nLOCATION OF THE TEMPLE The temple is located at No. A-3/92, behind Trilochan Temple.

Lord Shiva described such places with pleasure (Kashi Khand, Chapter 97). In the vicinity of Madhyameshwar is the Aapa Stambeshwar Ling. By worshipping this Ling, the devotee is blessed with Brahma Gyan (ultimate knowledge). In the present day context, this may be taken as good education/studies.

Irked by this, Vindhya mountain started growing higher and higher. In the process, he blocked the sunlight to major part of the world. This created chaos. Many of the living beings, plants etc. started to die. Devas and other learned men ran to Lord Brahma and pleaded with him to intervene. Lord Brahma advised them to go to Kashi and take up the matter with Sage Agasthya. Devas alongwith Brihaspati came to Kashi and straight away went to Sage Agasthya’s Ashram. They saw a serene atmosphere where the Sage was praying to Lord Shiva in the form a Shiv Ling installed by the former. The Shiv Ling was known as Agasthyeshwar. Sage Agasthya had dug a kund which was later called Agasthya Kund where he used to take bath daily and perform all the pooja and rituals in worship of Lord Shiva. Kashi Khand, Chapter 3 has described in detail the tranquil and divine ambience of the Ashram. Those devotees who take bath in Agasthya kund and perform the rituals for their forefathers, will derive full benefits of staying in Kashi. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 26).\n\nDevotees should take bath in Agasthya Kund and perform the rituals for their forefathers. They should worship Agasthyeshwar. Such devotees will be absolved of all their sins. All their sufferings will vanish and they will reach heaven after their death. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 61). LOCATION OF AGASTHYESHWAR Agasthyeshwar Ling is located at D.36/11, August Kund Mohalla. This will come somewhere in the vicinity of Nattu Kottai Chatram. Devotees who approach from Godowlia will come across Susheel Cinema building which is now a jewelry store. Immediately after the building, they should take a left turn and at the end of the lane they should take another left turn and climb the huge steps on the right. Agasthya Kund is almost fully dried up but the entire locality is known by the name of August Kunda in reverence to Sage Agasthya and Agasthyeshwar Ling. TYPES OF POOJA The place of worship is open from 09.00 a.m. to 09.00 p.m. Devotees can worship as per their convenience.

After due prayers, they were blessed with a male child. The child was named Grahapati by all elders and eminent personalities. Vishwanar performed all the sanskars (rituals) connected with child birth and upbringing of a child. Upanayan Sanskar of Grahapati was performed at the age of five and he was given Brahmopadesh. The boy learnt all the vidyas from his Guru/father. One day Sage Narad visited their house and was overwhelmed by the hospitality extended by Vishwanar and his family. Sage Narad made Grahapati sit in his lap and examined him in detail. Afterwards, Narad told the parents that the child had all the indications of a Raja Yog and all parts of his body, his mannerisms etc. pointed out to that. But at the age of twelve, he will have to face a very serious threat to his life by Lightning (Agni). After saying this, Sage Narad left their place. On hearing this, both the parents were taken aback. Vishwanar fainted and his wife started weeping bitterly. On seeing their parents’ plight, Grahapati told them that he will go to Kashi and start worshipping Lord Shiva in his form of Mrityunjay. He came to Kashi, took bath in Manikarnika Teerth and worshipped Lord Vishweshwar. Soon Grahapati installed a Shiv Ling and started performing intensive Tapas to please Lord Shiva. He performed abhishek with 108 pots of Ganges water on this ling and performed various poojas and archana with flowers and other ingredients. He was on fast for several months at a stretch and this went on for two consecutive years till he attained the age of 12. The danger time, prescribed by Sage Narada had approached. Lord Indra appeared before Grahapati and offered him a divine wish. Grahapati respectfully stated that he was worshipping Lord Shiva and the latter can only grant him any wish or blessing and none else. Lord Indra claimed that he was the only God who could bless him. Grahapati again politely repeated his words, which infuriated Lord Indra to such an extent that he attacked Grahapati with Vajraayud (thunderbolt). Grahapati on account of the above attack, fell down unconscious. Then Lord Shiva appeared before him and woke him up. Grahapati woke up as if he was awakened from a deep sleep and saw Lord Shiva in person standing before him. Lord Shiva told Grahapati that the latter was put to test. None of the devotees of Lord Shiva need to fear from any one as they are under the protection of the Almighty. He told Grahapati that the latter would have the status of Deva. The Ling installed by Grahapati will henceforth be known by the name of Agneeshwar Ling. A devotee who worships Agneeshwar Ling will not have any fear from lightning or fire. He will not be faced with Akal Mrityu (untimely death). If a person performs pooja etc. of Agneeshwar in Kashi, he will reach Agni Lok even if he dies elsewhere. After saying all this, Vishweshar disappeared into the Agneeshwar Ling. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 11). Ling Puraan, Chapter 7 of the supplement (Varanasi Maahaatmya) states the importance of Agneeshwar Ling. A devotee who worships Agneeshwar will reach Agni Lok after death.\n\nLOCATION OF THE TEMPLE The temple is located at House No. Ck.2/1, Patani Tola, Bhosala Ghat, Varanasi.

(Kindly refer to Krithi Vaseshwar). Once the Lord, in his form as Krithi Vaseshwar, was sitting alongwith Goddess Uma Devi when Nandi offered his prayers and stated that there are 68 places of worship dedicated to Lord Shiva in this holy place. Various idols/Shiv Lings have been brought from several other places by Nandi and installed in Kashi. From Ganga Sagar Teerth, one Ling by name of Amareshwar has appeared in the Holy city of Kashi. Devotees who worship this ling will lead a long and happy life, without any fear of untimely death. This Ling also finds mention in Chapter 92, Shlok 134 to 139 in Ling Puraan.\n\nLOCATION OF AMARESHWAR Amareshwar is located at B-2/20, behind Lolark Kund, Bhadaini. People can travel almost upto Lolark (famous landmark) near Assi and behind Lolark is a building bearing the above number and this Ling is situated in the eastern side of the building. TYPES OF POOJA This place is open for darshan throughout and devotees can perform pooja by themselves. ****************************************************\n\nAMRITESHWAR Once there was a Grihastha Rishi (one who leads a normal family life) named Shanaru in Kashi. He used to observe all the prayer codes as laid down in Sanathana Dharma. He performed Brahma Yagnam, Linga Pooja and all the related rituals daily. One day his son, Upajangini was playing in the nearby forest where he was bitten by a snake and the boy’s body went inert. Totally crestfallen at his son’s death, the Sage brought the body to a place near Swarg Dwar in Kashi which was near Mahasmashan (cremation ground). He placed the boy in a mound of mud and started pondering on the next course of action regarding the cremation. Unknown to him, under the ground, there was a small Ling of the shape and size of a goose berry (amla). The Shiv Ling was so powerful that by its radiation, the boy Upajangini who was declared dead, got up as if from deep slumber. The sage was utterly surprised as to what had happened. Precisely at that time, one snake passed through the muddy area with a dead worm in its mouth. The moment the dead worm came into contact with the muddy area, it revived. The sage wondered there must be something in that muddy area which he thought must contain Amrita Sanjivini (elixir capable of overcoming death). He started digging the mud and found one small Ling of the shape and size of a goose berry. The sage immediately took the Shiv Ling out of the mud, and after observing all the rituals, installed the Shiv Ling ceremonially. He then started worshipping the Shiv Ling which was named by him as Amriteshwar. According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 94, devotees who touch Amriteshwar Ling will attain Amritatva (victory over death). The Shiv Ling has been described to be so powerful as to make the dead people alive. It is also said that those who pray to Amriteshwar will have no fear of rebirth. Further, in Kashi Khand, Chapter 73, Lord Shiva tells Goddess Parvaty about fourteen powerful Shiv Lings in Kashi which are capable of giving mukti to devotees. Amriteshwar is first among the fourteen mentioned by Lord Shiva.\n\nLOCATION OF AMRITESHWAR Amriteshwar is located at Ck.33/28, Neel Kant, Baccha Maharaj Ganga Putra House. From Neelkanteshwar devotees will take a left turn (towards the eastern side-towards Ganga river) and after walking a few yards, they will come across a Kali Temple. Amriteshwar is just opposite the Kali temple. People can travel upto Chowk by rickshaw and walk upto this place. The temple is located close to Adi Chunchanagiri Mahasamsthana Shakha Mutt of Karnataka. The place of worship also houses Amriteshwari Devi who finds mention in Kashi Khand, Chapter 70. TYPES OF POOJA The place of worship is open throughout and devotees can perform pooja on their own. ****************************************************\n\nANGEERAYESHWAR Kashi Khand, Chapter 18 mentions that various Lings have been installed in the holy city of Kashi by great Rishis (Sages). It is worth mentioning here that on account of intense prayers to the Lords, the Sages have attained divine powers. In Harikes gardens, Sage Angeeras has installed a Shiv Ling which is known as Angeerayeshwar. Devotees who worship this Ling will achieve Tejas (radiant energy) and will reach heaven after death. LOCATION OF ANGEERAYESHWAR Angeerayeshwar is located at D-35/77, Jangambari Mutt, Jangambari, Varanasi. This is a famous place and can be reached by rickshaw.

However, devotees can have darshan as per their convenience. People can perform pooja on their own. Our enquiries revealed that the place of worship is open from 06.00 a.m. to 09.00 p.m. ****************************************************\n\nASHADESHWAR On a request by Goddess Parvaty, Lord Shiva described various Teerths (sacred ponds/lakes) and deities in Kashi. Lord Shiva told her all Lings are having the divine powers of Teerths. Lord Shiva described the power of Ashadeshwar Ling. A devotee worshipping this Ling is cleansed of all his sins. (Kashi Khand 97). Ashadeshwar temple is a stand alone temple and well maintained. A multitude of devotees visit this temple. While the ancient Ling (Kashi Khand) is available towards the back side of the temple, within the last century some noble person has installed a Ling within the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Devotees worship both the Lings. Ashadeshwar is eulogized in chapter 9 of supplement of Ling Puraan (Varanasi Maahaatmya).\n\nLOCATION OF ASHADESHWAR The temple is located at K.63/53, Kashipura.

According to Kashi Khand, Surya was born to Kashyap and Dakshayani. Surya married Sangya, who was very devoted to her husband, as is expected of dutiful wives. In due course, two sons and one daughter were born to them. The first one was a boy named Vaivasvathamanu, second again a boy named Yamraj and third was a girl named Yamuna. However, Sangya somehow felt that the heat emanating from Surya was increasingly becoming unbearable. Sangya created a clone of herself who was named Chhaya (shadow). She was an alter ego (splitting image) of Sangya. Under instructions from Sangya, Chhaya was to perform the role of Sangya, spend her life as wife of Surya, without disclosing the secret to any one. She was also expected to take good care of the above three children. After getting an assurance from Chhaya, Sangya went away to her father’s house. After some time, Chhaya gave birth to three children of which the second one was Shani. But once her own children were born she started showing lesser and lesser love to the children of Sangya. Surya came to know about this and got extremely angry whereupon, Chhaya divulged the secret. However, considering her innocence, Surya pardoned her. Surya went in search of Sangya who was undergoing severe and intense penance. Due to poor eating and fasting her body had assumed the shape of a mare and Surya disguised himself as a horse (Ashwa in Sanskrit). In this state, two children were born to them who were twins and came to be known as Aswani Kumars. They are also the divine physicians. Surya later pardoned Sangya also. (Kashi Khand Chapter 17). In due course, the Aswani Kumars installed two lings which are collectively known as Aswaniyeshwar (Aswani Kumareshwar) and a devotee who worships these Lings will receive all kinds of blessings. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 97). Ashwini Kumareshwar is eulogized in chapter 2 of supplement of Ling Puraan (Varanasi Maahaatmya). LOCATION OF ASHWANI KUMARESHWAR The temple is located at House No. Ck.2/26, Opp. Ganga Mahal, Bhosala Ghat, Varanasi. One can travel upto Chowk by Cycle Rickshaw and walk to this place via Sankata Devi Temple (famous landmark).

TYPES OF POOJAS The temple is open from 06.00 am to 9.00 p.m. Devotees can perform their own pooja as per their convenience.\n\nPOOJARIS OF THE TEMPLE Shri Upendra Tripathi is the Poojari of the temple. **************************************************** ATMA VEERESHWAR According to Kashi Khand, Chapater 82, Lord Shiva described the power of Veereshwar Ling as under : Once a kingdom was ruled by a very religious minded ruler named Amitrajit. He was a staunch devotee of Lord Vishnu and he made it a rule that all the citizens of his kingdom also became devotees of Lord Vishnu. One day Narad Rishi visited his palace and was welcomed with due respect by the King. As per the direction of Narad Rishi, King Amitrajit saved one beautiful girl called Malayagandini from the clutches of one evil person. The King subsequently married her and they came to Kashi and were immediately happy with the beautiful surroundings. In due course, Malayagandini was blessed with a handsome male child, who was destined to become 16 years old, immediately after birth. However, since he was born in an inauspicious planetary combination, the Ministers of the King told the Queen that she would have to sacrifice the child, otherwise the King would die. In order to save the King, she sent the child to Vikata Devi. But no one was inclined to slay the handsome boy who had been 16 years of age by then. The boy undertook severe penance of Lord Shiva, whereupon Lord Shiva appeared before him in form of a Ling. This Ling was named by Lord Shiva as Veereshwar Ling. According to Lord Shiva, a person who performs Pooja, Abhishek and archana of Veereshwar Ling attains all sort of happiness, prosperity and success. Kashi Khand, Chapter 83, states that a person who performs pooja of Veereshwar gets the benefit of doing pooja of three crore Lingas. It is considered auspicious to worship this Ling during Chaturdasi nights without going to sleep or bed. It is also considered auspicious to perform abhishek of this Ling with Panch Amritam (five ingredients namely milk, curd, honey, sugar and clarified butter) (Kashi Khand ibid). Kashi Khand, Chapter 11, mentions the importance of pooja/archana of Atma Veereshwar for being blessed with a child. One Sage Vishwanar and his pious wife prayed at various places in Kashi and finally arrived at the Siddha Peeth of Atma Veereshwar. He performed all rituals and rites at this temple for many months, reciting a prayer called Abhilasha Ashtakam and one day he saw a boy aged eight years standing near the Ling. The sage started worshipping the boy with the same fervour as one would worship Lord Shiva with. The boy was none other than Lord Shiva himself who directed his devotees to recite Abhilasha Ashtakam for one year, as was done by Sage Vishwanar, which will certainly result in progeny for childless couples. Subsequently, the boy disappeared into the Atma Veereshwar Ling.\n\nThough this Ling is mentioned as Veereshwar in Kashi Khand, presently, this ling is called as Atma Veereshwar or the soul of Veereshwar. Chapter 2, supplement to Ling Puran (Varanasi Maahaatmya) has also mentioned about Atma Veereshwar.\n\nLOCATION OF THE TEMPLE Atma Veereshwar temple is located at Ck-7/158, Scindia Ghat which is a famous locality in Varanasi. This place can be reached by boat through Scindia Ghat. Alternatively one can travel in cycle rickshaw upto Chowk and walk down the gullies to reach the temple. Reciting Rudra Japa at Atma Veereshwar temple is very fruitful. TYPES OF POOJAS The temple is open for worship 05.00 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and from 12.30 p.m. to 9.30. Special Aarti is held from 07.00 to 8.30 p.m. For doing special pooja, it is advisable to consult the Poojari before hand. POOJARIS OF THE TEMPLE Shri Mun Mun Guru is one of the Poojaries of the temple and he can be contacted in his Cell number (0)9792820159 for doing any special pooja. ****************************************************\n\nAVADHOOTESHWAR Goddess Parvaty requested Lord Shiva to describe various Teerths (sacred ponds/lakes) and deities in Kashi. Lord Shiva told her that all Lings are bearing the divine powers of Teerths. Somewhere to the north of Visweshwar is Avadhooteshwar Teerth and Avadhooteshwar Ling. Devotees worshipping this Ling are sure to attain ultimate knowledge. In the present day context, this may mean a good education. This ling is mentioned to be in the vicinity of Pasupateshwar Ling. (Kashi Khand Chapter 97). LOCATION OF AVADHOOTESHWAR The temple is located at Ck. 13/85, Opp. Pasupateshwar, Pasupateshwar Galli. The locality is named after the famous Pasupateshwar Ling. People can travel upto chowk area by rickshaw and walk on foot upto this temple. This temple is a famous landmark. TYPES OF POOJA The temple remains open practically throughout. Devotees can have darshan through the grill window. ****************************************************\n\nAVIMUKTESHWAR TEMPLE Varanasi or Kashi is known as Avi Mukta Kshetra and a person who dies here attains Moksha and has no rebirth. There has been lot of discussions and doubts raised in various places whether Avimukteshwar temple is the main temple or the Vishwanath Temple. In ancient texts and granths Avimukteshwar temple has been given importance. Ling Puraan, Chapter 2 of the supplement (Varanasi Maahaatmya) states that a person who observes one day fast and prayers to Lord Shiva in Avi Mukta Kshetra derives the benefit of observing fast for 100 years in other places. Further, according to chapter 15 ibid, Avimukteshwar is one of the six very important lings in Kashi. It is stated in ancient texts that a person having the darshan of Avimuktheshwar Ling is relieved of all his Paap Karmas of several generations and has no rebirth. It is also believed that Bhagvan Vishwanath performs pooja of Avimukteshwar every day. According to historical evidences, there was a magnificent temple of Avimukteshwar Ling and in this premises Vishweshwar Ling was also present. Devotees had darshan of both lingas in the same premises. But there was a bout of destructions during Mughal period and the Avimukthshwar Ling may not be in the same place as envisaged in Kashi Khand. LOCATION OF THE TEMPLE Presently Avimukteshwar Ling is situated in the same premises of Vishwanath Temple viz. Ck35/19, Chowk, Varanasi. Regarding directions to reach this temple, devotees may kindly refer to Visweshwar temple. TYPES OF POOJAS The temple is open for worship practically throughout the day and aarties (deep aradhana) are performed at various times. POOJARIS OF THE TEMPLE Since 1983, the management of the temple has been taken over by District Administration.

In the vicinity of Trilochan is one big Shiv Ling is known as Balmikeshwar. Devotees who worship Balmikeshwar will be free from all worries and despair. Ling Puran in Chapter 7 of supplement (Varanasi Maahaatmya) states that devotees who worship Balmikeshwar will always be happy.\n\nLOCATION OF BALMIKESHWAR Balmikeshwar is located in Trilochaneshwar Temple premises at A-2/80, Trilochan Ghat. The temple is approachable from Machhodari after crossing which devotees can travel upto Birla Hospital and take a right turn. Devotees can travel by Auto or Cycle Rickshaw. Alternatively, they can have a boat ride upto Trilochan Ghat and climb the steps. One point needs to be mentioned here. There is another Balmikeshwar Ling in the premises of Heramb Vinayak, in Auto Market, Maldahiya, Varanasi, which is also worshipped with fervour but the location given in Kashi Khand points out to Trilochan.

King Divodas consented to provide all necessary items for performing the above ritual. (Kindly refer to Divodaseshwar for further details).

Lord Shiva appeared before him through that Ling in the form of Jyoti (Divine Light).\n\nOn seeing Lord Shiva, Brihaspati became ecstatic and started singing praises of Lord Shiva whereupon the Lord granted that Brihaspati will be the Lord of all Devas. Since Brihaspati had sung prayers of Lord Shiva, the latter also granted that Brihaspati will be called Vachaspati (having excellence in speech). The Ling installed by Brihaspati will be called Brihaspateeshwar.\n\nLord Shiva further stated, a devotee who performs pooja etc. of Brihaspateeshwar on a regular basis will get all his wishes fulfilled.
