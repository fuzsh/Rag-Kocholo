        "text": "Sri Kshetra Gangapur, One of the most famous Dattatreya Peethas, is associated with Sri Narasimha Sarasvati Swami, an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya. It stands on the bank of the river Bhima in Afzalpur taluka in Gulbarga district of Karnataka. This Nirguna Math is adorned with the Nirguna Padukas. The water of the rivers Bhima and Amaraja, especially at the spot of their confluence, are considered extremely holy and called as” Bhima-Amarja Sangam.\n\nShreeguru has been blessing his devotees with his divine acts on countless occasions. The aspirations of Datta devotees who worship him at Ganagapur ksehtra with true love, faith and dedication will be fulfilled. The miraculous experiences of such will ever remain hidden in the devotees own hearts. This is true even today also and devotees are getting experiences of Lord Datta’s present at Ganagapur kshetra. Mentally retarded people, the people who are suffering from chronic deceases are coming to this place and getting cured from their sad feelings. The trouble of spirits and ghosts vanishes and one can get peace of mind with the darshan of Swamy padukas at this kshetra.\n\nThere are eight teerthas along the banks of Bhima River from Sangam to Kalleshwar, those are First is Bhima Amarja Sangam Shatakula Teerth teertha- It is like Triveni Sangam of Prayaga and Bath in this teertha Prevents Diseases and Untimely Death Near the Aswatha Tree is Narasimha Teertha – Bath in this Teerth and then worshipping Sangameshwara is like Worshipping Shrishailya Mallikarjuna and this fulfills ones Wishes Northwards is Bhagirathi teertha- Bath in this Teerth is as holy as Bath in Manikarnika Kund at Kashi Eastwards to it is the PapaVinasini Teertha – Bath in this Teerth Destroys all the Sins Eastwards to it is the Koti Teertha – Bath in this Teerth is like taking bath in all the Teerth of Jambu Dweepa Eastwards to it is Rudrapada Teertha – Bath in this teerth is equivalent to a Bath in Gaya Eastward to it is Chakrashwar Teertha –Bath in this teerth is Even More Holy than the Bath in Dwaraka And Manmatha teertha at Kalleshwara – Bath in this Teerth and then worshipping Kalleshwara is like taking bath in Gokarna Teerth and worshipping Mahabaleshwara.\n\nShri Dattatreya is a very ancient incarnation, highly venerated through the ages. Dattatreya – a Universal Guru manifested in the recess of time of ‘Kaliyug’, when humanity had gone far from its pristine state and steeped into threshold of a time when all kinds of vices had already taken root, and the pious souls made fervent appealed for the salvage of the mankind surging forward in manifold way. He had descended on this earth to establish ‘Satya’ (the Universal Truth), ‘Rta’ (the Cosmic Order), Dharma’, (the perennial principles), in all its entirety.\n\nSeer Atri was one of such Seers who had ‘seen’ and experienced the Brahman, the eternal Wisdom. To him was born a son, the product of the Grace or the Divine Will, which was the manifestation of all three Primal Energies of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. He was ordained with the three energies; He came to have the concentrated wisdom of the three God-heads or symbolically three heads. The three heads signified as Brahma:‘Tejas’ personified, Vishnu:‘Ojas’ personified, Shiva: ‘Tapas’ personified. Under these heads, illumination of knowledge, vigorosity of action and stringency of penance were represented as three aspects or state of being of the same.\n\nBirth: Dattatreya had descended into the realm of world as progeny of Atri and Anusuya, a sage couple of the Vedic age. Anusuya became very famous for her devotion to her husband. She was the embodiment of chastity. Such was her spiritual power that hard, uneven earth turned soft and smooth for her as she walked about. This pious woman induced jealousy and envy in others, however, and the three Gods decided to prove these doubting elements how wrong they were.\n\nThey transformed themselves into mendicants, approached the hermitage of sage Atri and begged for alms. At that time sage Atri was away at the river offering his daily oblations. Anusuya came out and offered food to them. They made a strange request; the food is prepared and served to them by Anusuya, in the nude. In the Indian tradition any ‘athithi’ (guest) cannot be turned away, as they are considered to be an aspect of God. Hence she was placed in a dilemma. She smiled to herself and reflected thus: ‘I am totally purified by the long association with the holy sage Atri. What harm can the god of lust ever do to me? So I do fear nothing. As they have sought food from my hands, I look upon them as my own children and not as strangers and grown up men!’ Her thoughts – the thoughts of a pious and chaste person – instantly became reality; the elderly guests became babies!\n\nSage Atri on his return to the hermitage saw his wife Anusuya fondling three babies. Anusuya said “These children are the gift of God to us who have been childless so far”. Sage Atri was overjoyed and named them Datta, which means ‘given’. At this the three Gods reverted to their real forms and disclosed the truth. They extolled the power of chastity and purity of Anusuya which vanquished the combined and colossal powers of all three of them. Sage Atri and Anusuya prayed that they should remain as their sons. They consented and the three Gods merged into one body.\n\nThis is how Shri Dattatreya incarnated and is known as Gurudeva Datta – the Guru of all Gurus.\n\nGanagapura is a kshetra (place of pilgrimage) associated with Sri Narasimha Saraswati Swami, the second incarnation of Dattatreya. According to the book Shri GuruCharitra, he promised that he would abide forever at Ganagapura. In the morning, he would bathe at the confluence of the Bhima and Amarja rivers. At midday, he would go through the village asking for bhiksha (alms of food), and accept pooja offerings in the form of Nirguna Paduka at the temple. Devotees believe that by bathing at the confluence between 3.30 am to 4.30 am (brahma muhurtham ), studying the Shri GuruCharita book for 7 days (sapthaha, the chapters would be spread across 7 days) at the odumbara tree ( Fig tree) at the confluence, by begging (Maadhukari) from at least five houses for 7 days in Ganagapura, and by offering Paduka Pooja at the temple, they can experience the living presence (darśana) of Sri Narasimha Saraswati Swami, and be freed from sins and granted wishes.\n\nPandharpur is 76 km from Solapur, 136 km from Sangli, 210 km from Pune and 360 km from Mumbai. Pandharpur possess good connectivity with rest of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana by road. MSRTC bus station is located in the central part of city and at just 1 km distance from Shri Vitthala-Rukmini Temple. Direct services to almost all parts of Maharashtra are available with highest frequency to the cities of Solapur, Sangli and Pune. When it comes to other states, daily buses are available to different parts of Karnataka (mostly north Karnataka) and Hyderabad. Apart from this many private bus services operate daily between Pandharpur to Pune and Pandharpur to Sangli.\n\nPandharpur is a well-known pilgrimage town, on the banks of Candrabhagā River, near Solapur city in Solapur District, Maharashtra, India. Its administrative area is one of eleven tehsils in the District, and it is an electoral constituency of the state legislative assembly (vidhan sabha).The Vithoba temple attracts about a million Hindu pilgrims during the major yātrā (pilgrimage) in Ashadha (June–July).\n\nA small temple of Śri Vitthala-Rukmini is also located, which is as old as the main Vitthala-Rukmini Mandir, in Isbavi area of Pandharpur known as Wakhari Va Korti Devalayas and also known as Visava Mandir. The Bhakti Saint, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, is said to have spent a period of 7 days in city at the Vithobha Temple. It is said that the deity Vithoba has been worshipped by many saints of Maharashtra. Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Tukārām, Sant Nāmdev, Sant Eknāth, Sant Nivruttināth, Sant Muktābai, Sant Chokhāmel̥ā, Sant Savatā Māli, Sant Narhari Sonār, Sant Gorā Kumbhār, Sant Meerā Bai and Sant Gajānan Mahāraj are a few of those prominent saints.\n\nhe oldest mention of Pandharpur is from 516 CE from Rashtrakuta era copper plate inscription. Yadava Kings in 11th and 12 the century gave numerous donations to the temple as evident from the inscriptions.\n\nIn the era of Adilshahi, most of the town was destroyed by Afzal Khan to hurt the religious sentiment of Shivaji. Saints from all across Maharashtra still gathered here for annual pilgrimage and thus Pandharpur became the heart of the devotional movement which laid to the social-religious reform. This resulted in new social synthesis which later paved the foundation of Maratha Empire.In the second half of the 18th century under the Marathas the temple and town was rebuilt under the Peshwas of Pune, Scindia of Gwailor and Holkar of Indore.\n\nMahadwar\n\nMahadwar is main locality in the city and a market place. Mahadwar leads to main ghāt of Pandharpur that is “Mahadwar ghat”. There is temple of Bhakta Pundalika on the ghāt.\n\nIt is said that Krishna came to Pandharpur to meet his disciple Bhakta Pundalīka who was busy serving his parents that time .He offered brick called viṭ in maraṭhi to Krishna and requested him to wait standing on the brick for some time till he attends his parents. The same Krishna is standing on the brick for last 28 yuga and thus is also knows as Vitthala. So in ārati of vitthal it is mentioned “yuge atṭhāvis (28), viṭhevari ubhā”.\n\nSignificance\n\nThere are other many ancient scriptures which elaborate the importance of Vitthala.\n\nChandogya Upanishad : The fourth chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad, has one of the source of the ancient tradition of Shri Vitthala’s worship. It contains the story of King Janśhruti who mentions about his visit to Pandharpur when he was on the way to search for Raikva. He remarks that ” He arrived at the location where the god “Vitthala,” who is simply a reincarnation of Vishnu, was located on the bank of the river Bhimā. The name of this pilgrimage is Bindutirth, and the name of the local deity is Bindumādhav. There the God who gives the blessings of material and spiritual prosperity still lives.”\n\nPandharpur Streets\n\nPadma Purana : The meaning of Pānduranga or Viṭthala is explained in Varāha samhitā of Padma Purana. Devrishi Nārada narrates to Ādiśeṣa about arrival of Pānduranga in Pandharpur, It explains the background and significance of Vitthala’s brick-standing at Pandharpur and origin of the Bhima River. Additionally, it provides information on Pandharpur’s different gods and deities. Neera Narasinḥpur is as holy as Prayāga , Korti or Vishnupad is as holy as Gayā, and Pandharpur is as holy as Kāśī. Therefore, a trip to Pandharpur could result in the blessings of the pilgrimage to these three locations. This is where Gaya śhraddha and Kāshi yātra rituals can be carried out.\n\nPundalik\n\nSkanda Purana : Shiva narrates to Pārvati, “This place is spiritually fruitful three times more than Puṣhkara , six times more than Kedārnāth, ten times more than Vārānasi and many more times than Śriśaila. Performing Yātra, Vāri, and Dān have great merit at this place.\n\nPilgrims bathing in the Chandrabhaga river at Pandharpur\n\nThere are four gates on the outside and inside of this building. Only via these gates may a person enter a city and they must bend their heads to the deity of these revered gates. Goddess Sarasvati is to the east, Siddheshvar of Machanoor is to the south, Bhuvaneshvar is to the west, and Mahiśhāsūrmardini is to the north at the internal gate. To the east of the exterior gates are Trivikarms of Ter, Koteshvar of Krishnatir Shorpalaya Kśhetra, Mahālakśhmī of Kolhāpur and Narsinḥa of Neera narasinhapur.\n\nVishnu is regarded to reside here with his nine celestial attributes. Vimalā, Uttkarshani, Dyan, Kriyā, Yoga, Pavi, Satyā, Eshana, and Anugraha are the names of those nine powers. Garuḍh (the eagle) stands in front of the Pānduranga statue, with Brahmā and Sanakadika to its right and the eleven Rudras and Shiva to its left. All of the gods, including Indra, are applauding Panduranga from behind the idol.\n\nThis ancient text goes into detail about the importance and advantages of various temple rituals, including taking refuge in the temple’s shadow, performing Pānduranga darshan, praising Panduranga in front of him, dancing in the rangshala, visiting the temple for darshan during dhupārti, cleaning the temple grounds, etc.The text clarifies the significance of the Pandharpur shrines Kundal Tirtha and Padma Tirtha.\n\nBalarāma also arrived and served the deity, along with Dhaumya Rishi and Yudhiṣhṭhira and all of his brothers. In Pandharpur, Rukmini served the deity and gave birth to Pradyumna. The effects of the river Bhima’s entry into Pandhari, Pandhari’s protector Shri Bhairava, the devotee Muktakeshi’s meditation, and her acceptance by God are all detailed in this scripture.\n\nDemographics\n\nAccording to the 2011 census of India, Pandharpur had a population of 98,000. Males constituted 52% of the population and females, 48%. 71% of the population was literate; 78% males and 64% females.\n\nMarathi is the official and main language of people.\n\nIt is a major holy place in Maharashtra and it is also called South Kashi (Dakshin Kashi) in Maharashtra. It is famous for the Lord Vitthala temple situated on the bank of Bhima river. Bhima river is also known as Chandrabhaga as it takes shape like crescent moon near the town. There are 4 yatra’s (wari- gathering of pilgrims/devotees) per year, Chaitri, Ashadhi, Kartiki and Maghi, of which Ashadhi and Kartiki are the main yatra’s. Devotees comes from all over Maharashtra, Karnataka and some part of Tamil NaduThey usually come walking hundreds of miles, all the way from their hometown.\n\nSri Sai Baba, one of the foremost saints of modern India, the last avatar (incarnation) of Lord Dattatreya in this age of Kaliyuga.\n\nSai Baba arrived at the village of Shirdi in the Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra, at about 16 years old. He was revered by both his Muslim and Hindu devotees, and during, as well as after, his life on earth it remained uncertain if he was a Muslim or Hindu himself. Sai Baba stressed the importance of surrender to the guidance of the true Sadguru.\n\nThe Ahimsa aspect of Jainism, the renunciation aspect of Buddhism, the Dharmic aspect of Lord Rama the Nishkama-Karma aspect of Lord Krishna, the universal-love aspect of Jesus, the universal brotherhood aspect of Islam-all are found harmoniously blended in Sai Nath’s way of life. He also gave Darshan (vision) to people in the form of Rama, Krishna, Vithoba and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.The presence of Dhuni (sacred fire) was a temple to the Hindus and the Parsees, the nimbaru (niche) on the western wall made it look like a mosque and to the Christian it was a church where the bells announce prayers. Shri Shirdi Sai Baba attained his “Mahasamadhi” on the auspicious “Vijayadasami” day in 1918.\n\nWhen Sai Baba came to Shirdi, he used to spend most of his time under a neem tree which is now known as Gurusthan. According to a legend, when some villagers started to dig the land near the tree, Sai Baba asked them to stop as he said it was the resting place of the ancestors. If you ever travel to Shirdi and get a chance to taste a neem leaf fallen from the tree then you will be surprised by its taste. Interestingly, the neem leaves here don’t taste bitter but sweet. It is believed that those who get a chance to have a neem leaf from the tree have a healthy life and suffer from no diseases.\n\nHistory and greatness of the temple of Shri Saibaba Temple\n\nSai Baba of Shirdi, also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees as a saint and a fakir. He is revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees during, as well as after his lifetime.\n\nSai Baba is now revered as an incarnation of Sri Dattatreya and considered as Saguna Brahma by his devotees. He is attributed to be the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of this universe by his devotees. He is decorated with jewels and all forms of Hindu Vedic deities as he is believed by his followers to be the supreme God.\n\nAccording to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of realization of the self and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to God and guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training\n\nSai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains unclear if he was a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teachings combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practiced both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone’s Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall look to you[4] and Allah tera bhala Karega.\n\nBackground\n\nSai Baba’s date of birth including his birthplace remains unknown and is debatable due to lack of evidence and no definitive information exists to prove it. Most definitive information about Shirdi Sai Baba tends to be derived from a book called Shri Sai Satcharitra written by a disciple called Hemadpant (also known as Annasaheb Dabholkar / Govind Raghunath) in 1922 in Marathi.[8] The book itself is a compilation based on accounts by his various disciples and Hemadpant’s personal observations observing Sai Baba from 1910 onwards.\n\nSai Baba’s real name remains unknown. The name Sai was given to him by Mhalsapati when he arrived at Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word Sai refers to a religious mendicant but can also mean God. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages, the term Baba is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man, or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes holy father, saintly father, or (venerable) poor old man.\n\nSome of Sai Baba’s disciples became famous as spiritual figures and saints, such as Mahalsapati, a priest of the Khandoba temple in Shirdi, and Upasni Maharaj. He was revered by other saints as well, such as Saint Bidkar Maharaj, Saint Gagangiri Maharaj, Saint Janakidas Maharaj, and Sati Godavari Mataji. Sai Baba referred to several saints as ‘my brothers’, especially the disciples of Swami Samartha of Akkalkot.\n\nEarly years\n\nSai Baba (right) and some of his devotees at Dwarakamai, his own temple.\n\nSai Baba with some devotees\n\nAlthough Sai Baba’s origins are unknown, some indications exist that suggest that he was born not far from Shirdi. Historical researches into genealogies in Shirdi give support to the theory that Baba could have been born with the name Haribhau Bhusari. Baba was notorious for giving vague, misleading, and contradictory replies to questions concerning his parentage and origins, brusquely stating the information was unimportant. He had reportedly stated to a close follower, Mahalsapati, that he has been born of Deshastha Brahmin parents in the village of Pathri and had been entrusted into the care of a fakir in his infancy. On another occasion, Baba reportedly said that the fakir’s wife had left him in the care of a Hindu guru, Venkusa of Selu and that he had stayed with Venkusa for 12 years as his disciple. This dichotomy has given rise to two major theories regarding Baba’s background, with the majority of writers supporting the Hindu background over the Islamic, while others combine both the theories (that Sai Baba was first brought up by a fakir and then by a guru).\n\nBaba reportedly arrived at the village of Shirdi in the Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra, India, when he was about sixteen years old. Although there is no agreement among biographers about the date of this event, it is generally accepted that Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year, and returned permanently around 1858, just after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. This posits a possible birth year of 1838. He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a neem tree and meditating while sitting in an asana. The Sai Satcharita recounts the reaction of the villagers\n\nThe people of the village were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practicing hard penance, not minding heat or cold. By day he associated with no one, by night he was afraid of nobody.\n\nHis presence attracted the curiosity of the villagers and the religiously-inclined such as Mhalsapati, Appa Jogle, and Kashinatha regularly visited him, while others such as the village children considered him mad and threw stones at him. After some time he left the village and it is unknown where he stayed at that time or what happened to him. However, there are some indications that he met with many saints and fakirs and worked as a weaver; he claimed to have fought with the army of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nReturn to Shirdi\n\nSai Baba in his usual attire\n\nSai Baba returned to Shirdi in 1858. He appeared at the Khandoba Mandir in Shirdi. The temple priest, Mahalsapati, upon seeing him for the very first time, welcomed him by saying ‘Aao, Sai!’ (‘Come Sai’). From then on, He was known by the name (Sai Baba).\n\nAround this time he adopted his famous style of dressing, consisting of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported ‘long hair flowing down to the end of his spine’ when he arrived in Shirdi and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba’s identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.\n\nFor four to five years, Baba lived under a neem tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. His manner was said to be withdrawn and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation. He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque, he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash (‘Udi’) to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and the Qur’an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God’s name (dhikr, and often cryptically expressed himself with the use of parables, symbols, and allegories).\n\nBaba is believed to have grown and cultivated a garden called Lendi Baug, named after a river called Lendi which flowed nearby. The garden continues to be a place visited by pilgrims and has temples, samadhis of people, and animals associated with Shirdi Sai Baba’s life and temples.[26]\n\nIn 1910, Sai Baba’s fame began to spread in Mumbai. Numerous people started visiting him because they regarded him as a saint with the power of performing miracles or even as an avatar.[29] They built his first temple at Bhivpuri, Karjat.\n\nFinal years and death (Samadhi)\n\nIn August 1918, Shirdi Sai Baba told some of his devotees that he would soon be “leaving his mortal body” (dying). Towards the end of September, he had a high fever and stopped eating. As his condition deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him and continued to meet visitors. On 15 October 1918, he breathed his last. The day coincided with the Hindu calendar date that year for Vijayadashami. His remains were interred at “Buti Wada” in Shirdi, after which it became a place of worship known today as Shree Samadhi Mandir or Shirdi Sai Baba Temple.\n\nTeachings and practices\n\nShirdi Sai Baba, leaning against the wall of his masjid, with devotees\n\nSai Baba opposed all persecution based on religion or caste. He was an opponent of religious orthodoxy — Christian, Hindu, and Muslim.\n\nSai Baba encouraged his devotees to pray, chant God’s name, and read holy scriptures. He told Muslims to study the Qur’an and Hindus to study texts such as the Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita, and Yoga Vasistha.] He was impressed by the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita and encouraged people to follow it in their own lives. He advised his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any discrimination, and develop two important features of character: faith (Shraddha) and patience (Saburi). He criticized atheism.\n\nIn his teachings, Sai Baba emphasized the importance of performing one’s duties without attachment to earthly matters and of being content regardless of the situation. In his personal practice, Sai Baba observed worship procedures belonging to Islam; he shunned any kind of regular rituals but allowed the practice of Salah, chanting of Al-Fatiha, and Qur’an readings at Muslim festival times. Occasionally reciting the Al-Fatiha, Baba enjoyed listening to mawlid and qawwali accompanied with the tabla and sarangi twice daily.\n\nSai Baba interpreted the religious texts of both Islam and Hinduism. He explained the meaning of the Hindu scriptures in the spirit of Advaita Vedanta. His philosophy also had numerous elements of bhakti. The three main Hindu spiritual paths — Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga — influenced his teachings.\n\nSai Baba encouraged charity and stressed the importance of sharing. He said\n\nUnless there is some relationship or connection, nobody goes anywhere. If any men or creatures come to you, do not discourteously drive them away, but receive them well and treat them with due respect. Sri Hari (God) will certainly be pleased if you give water to the thirsty, bread to the hungry, clothes to the naked, and your verandah to strangers for sitting and resting. If anybody wants any money from you and you are not inclined to give, do not give, but do not bark at him like a dog.”\n\nWorship and devotees\n\nMain article: Shirdi Sai Baba movement\n\nSai Baba’s Temple in Shirdi\n\nThe Mandir Kalasha Of The Samadhi Mandir, Shirdi\n\nThe Shirdi Sai Baba movement began in the 19th century, while he was living in Shirdi. A local Khandoba priest, Mhalsapati Nagre, is believed to have been his first devotee. In the 19th century, Sai Baba’s followers were only a small group of inhabitants of Shirdi and a few people from other parts of India.\n\nBecause of Sai Baba, Shirdi has become a place of importance and is counted among the major Hindu places of pilgrimage. The first Sai Baba temple is situated at Kudal, Sindhudurg. This temple was built in 1922. It is believed that Sai Baba gave one rupee to Dada Madye Ji with which he built the temple in Kudal.\n\nToday, the Sai Baba Temple in Shirdi is visited by an average of 25,000 pilgrims a day and during religious festivals, this number can reach up to 100,000. The Sai Baba temple in Shirdi is managed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust. Inside the temple, the statue of Sai Baba and the Samadhi is carved out of Italian marble and is seen draped with royal cloth, wearing a gold crown and adorned with fresh flower garlands. The interior is made of old stone bricks. The interior, as well as the exterior (cone) of the temple, is covered with gold. As per rituals and traditions dating back to when Baba was still alive, four Aarti‘s are held daily (corresponding to the time of the day) inside the Samadhi Mandir.\n\n• Kakad Aarti (The Morning Aarti) at 4:30 (am)\n\n• Madhyan Aarti (The Afternoon Aarti) at 12:00 (pm)\n\n• Dhup Aarti (The Evening Aarti) 6:30 (pm)\n\n• She Aarti (The Night Aarti) at 10:30 (pm)\n\nThe Palanquin procession of Sai Baba takes place every Thursday from the Samadhi Mandir to Dwarkamayi, onward to Chavdi, and back to the Sai Baba Mandir. Devotees belonging to all faiths are welcome to take Darshan in the Samadhi Mandir and have free meals in the Prasadalaya, irrespective of caste, creed, and religion as these were one of the ideal principles of Sai Baba.\n\nSai Baba of Shirdi is especially revered and worshiped in the states of Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. In August 2012, an unidentified devotee, for the first time, donated two expensive diamonds valuing ₹11.8 million at the Shirdi temple, as revealed by Saibaba trust officials.\n\nIn recent years, the Shirdi Sai movement has spread to the Caribbean and countries such as Nepal, Canada, United States, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, United Kingdom,[50][51] Germany, France, and Singapore.\n\nNon-discrimination of devotees\n\nA marble statue of Sai Baba.\n\nBaba himself maintained an ambiguous profile, unwilling to identify with either of the two religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: “You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?” Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing:\n\nIn essence or basic principle, there is no difference between Hindu and Muslim. You took birth in the human body to point out this. You look with affection on both Hindus and Muslims. This, Sai, who pervades all, as the soul of all, shows.\n\nBaba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was “Allah rakhega via rahena”, that is, “Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah.” On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal. His notion of the unity of all mankind that appealed to everyone was very congruous with the Sufism of Islam. “God being one and the master of all also meant that all his creatures were part of one big family,” writes Sikand. “This belief was entirely in keeping with … the teachings of Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation.” Sai Baba urged his Hindu followers to read their holy books and find their own path. For him, all paths were equally valid, “Ishwar” (the Hindu God) and “Allah” being synonymous.\n\nPadukas of sai baba\n\nPeople coming to his abode were so taken aback to see Hindus, Muslims, and others living together so peacefully that in many instances it changed their entire lives and belief systems.\n\nMiracles\n\nSai Baba’s disciples and devotees claim that he performed many miracles such as bilocation, levitation, mindreading, materialization, exorcisms, entering a state of Samādhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines and sticking them back to his body (khandana yoga), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) to people in the form of Sri Rama, Krishna, Vithoba, Shiva, and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.\n\nAccording to his followers, he appeared to them in their dreams and gave them advice. His devotees have documented many stories.\n\nFollowers\n\nSai Baba depicted on a tapestry\n\nSai Baba left behind no spiritual heirs, appointed no disciples, and did not provide formal initiation (Diksha), despite requests. Some of Sai Baba’s notable disciples include Mahalsapathi, Madhav Rao (Shama), Nanasaheb Peshwa, Bayijabai, Tatya Kote Patil, Kakasaheb Dixit, Radhakrishna Maai, Hemadpant, Bhuti, Das Ganu, Lakshmi Bai, Nanavali, Upasni Maharaj, Abdul Baba, Sapatanekar, Nanasaheb Chandodkar, B.V. Narashima Swamiji.[citation needed] Some disciples of Sai Baba achieved fame as spiritual figures, such as Upasni Maharaj of Sakori. After the demise of Sai Baba, his devotees offered the daily Aarti to Upasni Maharaj when he paid a visit to Shirdi twice within 10 years.\n\nHindus\n\nDuring Sai Baba’s lifetime, the Hindu saint Anandanath of Yewala declared Sai Baba to be a “spiritual diamond.” Another saint, Gangagir, also called him a “jewel.” Sri Beedkar Maharaj greatly revered Sai Baba and in 1873, when he met him he bestowed the title Jagad guru upon him. Sai Baba was also greatly respected by Vasudevananda Saraswati (known as Tembye Swami). He was also revered by a group of Shaivism yogis, known as the Nath-Panchayat. He is considered an avatar of the Supreme Reality (Brahman or God), a satguru, or saint, depending on individual proclivities. This is not uncommon in Hinduism where there is no central doctrine or cosmology, but a basis in individual faith and spirituality.\n\nParsis\n\nSaibaba was revered by prominent Zoroastrians such as Nanabhoy Palkhivala, Farhad Panthaky, and Homi Bhabha, and has been cited as the Zoroastrians’ most popular non-Zoroastrian religious figure.\n\nMeher Baba, who was born into a Zoroastrian family, met Sai Baba once, during World War I, in December 1915. This event is considered the most significant in Meher Baba’s life. Shri Sai Satcharita (Sai Baba’s life story), makes no mention of Meher Baba but Lord Meher, the life story of Meher Baba, there are numerous references to Sai Baba.\n\nMeher Baba, who claimed he was a (the) Avatar, credited his Avataric advent to Upasni, Sai Baba, and three other Perfect Masters: Hazrat Babajan, Hazrat Tajuddin Baba, and Narayan Maharaj. He declared Sai Baba to be a Qutub-e-Irshad (the highest of the five Qutubs, a “Master of the Universe” in the spiritual hierarchy). This classification of avatar and satgurus and the associated name is applied within the Meher Baba community alone In popular culture\n\nShri Sai tends to be a very common name for establishments in Mumbai in particular and Maharashtra in general. It tends to be popular for a variety of establishments including restaurants, real estate agencies, and hotels.\n\nSacred art and architecture There are many temples of Sai Baba in India. Temples are also located in countries outside India, including the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Netherlands, Kenya, Benin, Cuba, Canada, Pakistan, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and New Zealand. Present in the mosque in Shirdi in which Sai Baba lived, is a life-size portrait of him by Shama Rao Jaykar, an artist from Mumbai. Numerous monuments and statues depicting Sai Baba which serve a religious function have been made. One of them, made of marble by a sculptor named Balaji Vasant Talim, is in the Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi where Sai Baba was buried.\n\nIn 2008, India Post has issued a commemorative postage stamp of ₹5.00 to honour Sai Baba.\n\nSri Kshetra Gangapur, One of the most famous Dattatreya Peethas, is associated with Sri Narasimha Sarasvati Swami, an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya. It stands on the bank of the river Bhima in Afzalpur taluka in Gulbarga district of Karnataka. This Nirguna Math is adorned with the Nirguna Padukas. The water of the rivers Bhima and Amaraja, especially at the spot of their confluence, are considered extremely holy and called as” Bhima-Amarja Sangam.\n\nShreeguru has been blessing his devotees with his divine acts on countless occasions. The aspirations of Datta devotees who worship him at Ganagapur ksehtra with true love, faith and dedication will be fulfilled. The miraculous experiences of such will ever remain hidden in the devotees own hearts. This is true even today also and devotees are getting experiences of Lord Datta’s present at Ganagapur kshetra. Mentally retarded people, the people who are suffering from chronic deceases are coming to this place and getting cured from their sad feelings. The trouble of spirits and ghosts vanishes and one can get peace of mind with the darshan of Swamy padukas at this kshetra.\n\nThere are eight teerthas along the banks of Bhima River from Sangam to Kalleshwar, those are First is Bhima Amarja Sangam Shatakula Teerth teertha- It is like Triveni Sangam of Prayaga and Bath in this teertha Prevents Diseases and Untimely Death Near the Aswatha Tree is Narasimha Teertha – Bath in this Teerth and then worshipping Sangameshwara is like Worshipping Shrishailya Mallikarjuna and this fulfills ones Wishes Northwards is Bhagirathi teertha- Bath in this Teerth is as holy as Bath in Manikarnika Kund at Kashi Eastwards to it is the PapaVinasini Teertha – Bath in this Teerth Destroys all the Sins Eastwards to it is the Koti Teertha – Bath in this Teerth is like taking bath in all the Teerth of Jambu Dweepa Eastwards to it is Rudrapada Teertha – Bath in this teerth is equivalent to a Bath in Gaya Eastward to it is Chakrashwar Teertha –Bath in this teerth is Even More Holy than the Bath in Dwaraka And Manmatha teertha at Kalleshwara – Bath in this Teerth and then worshipping Kalleshwara is like taking bath in Gokarna Teerth and worshipping Mahabaleshwara.\n\nShri Dattatreya is a very ancient incarnation, highly venerated through the ages. Dattatreya – a Universal Guru manifested in the recess of time of ‘Kaliyug’, when humanity had gone far from its pristine state and steeped into threshold of a time when all kinds of vices had already taken root, and the pious souls made fervent appealed for the salvage of the mankind surging forward in manifold way. He had descended on this earth to establish ‘Satya’ (the Universal Truth), ‘Rta’ (the Cosmic Order), Dharma’, (the perennial principles), in all its entirety.\n\nSeer Atri was one of such Seers who had ‘seen’ and experienced the Brahman, the eternal Wisdom. To him was born a son, the product of the Grace or the Divine Will, which was the manifestation of all three Primal Energies of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. He was ordained with the three energies; He came to have the concentrated wisdom of the three God-heads or symbolically three heads. The three heads signified as Brahma:‘Tejas’ personified, Vishnu:‘Ojas’ personified, Shiva: ‘Tapas’ personified. Under these heads, illumination of knowledge, vigorosity of action and stringency of penance were represented as three aspects or state of being of the same.\n\nBirth: Dattatreya had descended into the realm of world as progeny of Atri and Anusuya, a sage couple of the Vedic age. Anusuya became very famous for her devotion to her husband. She was the embodiment of chastity. Such was her spiritual power that hard, uneven earth turned soft and smooth for her as she walked about. This pious woman induced jealousy and envy in others, however, and the three Gods decided to prove these doubting elements how wrong they were.\n\nThey transformed themselves into mendicants, approached the hermitage of sage Atri and begged for alms. At that time sage Atri was away at the river offering his daily oblations. Anusuya came out and offered food to them. They made a strange request; the food is prepared and served to them by Anusuya, in the nude. In the Indian tradition any ‘athithi’ (guest) cannot be turned away, as they are considered to be an aspect of God. Hence she was placed in a dilemma. She smiled to herself and reflected thus: ‘I am totally purified by the long association with the holy sage Atri. What harm can the god of lust ever do to me? So I do fear nothing. As they have sought food from my hands, I look upon them as my own children and not as strangers and grown up men!’ Her thoughts – the thoughts of a pious and chaste person – instantly became reality; the elderly guests became babies!\n\nSage Atri on his return to the hermitage saw his wife Anusuya fondling three babies. Anusuya said “These children are the gift of God to us who have been childless so far”. Sage Atri was overjoyed and named them Datta, which means ‘given’. At this the three Gods reverted to their real forms and disclosed the truth. They extolled the power of chastity and purity of Anusuya which vanquished the combined and colossal powers of all three of them. Sage Atri and Anusuya prayed that they should remain as their sons. They consented and the three Gods merged into one body.\n\nThis is how Shri Dattatreya incarnated and is known as Gurudeva Datta – the Guru of all Gurus.\n\nGanagapura is a kshetra (place of pilgrimage) associated with Sri Narasimha Saraswati Swami, the second incarnation of Dattatreya. According to the book Shri GuruCharitra, he promised that he would abide forever at Ganagapura. In the morning, he would bathe at the confluence of the Bhima and Amarja rivers. At midday, he would go through the village asking for bhiksha (alms of food), and accept pooja offerings in the form of Nirguna Paduka at the temple. Devotees believe that by bathing at the confluence between 3.30 am to 4.30 am (brahma muhurtham ), studying the Shri GuruCharita book for 7 days (sapthaha, the chapters would be spread across 7 days) at the odumbara tree ( Fig tree) at the confluence, by begging (Maadhukari) from at least five houses for 7 days in Ganagapura, and by offering Paduka Pooja at the temple, they can experience the living presence (darśana) of Sri Narasimha Saraswati Swami, and be freed from sins and granted wishes.\n\nGajanan Maharaj was an Indian Hindu guru, saint and mystic. His origins remain uncertain. He first appeared at Shegaon, a village in Buldhana district, Maharashtra as a young man at age of 30 probably during 23 February 1878. He attained Sanjeevana Samadhi on September 8, 1910; which is thought to be a process of voluntary withdrawal from one’s physical body. This date of his Samadhi is commemorated every year as part of the Shree Punyatithi Utsav. The date of his first appearance is considered an auspicious day and is celebrated as Prakat Din Sohla.\n\nThe early life details of Gajanan Maharaj remain obscure and his date of birth also is unknown. He is believed to have made his first appearance during February 1878 at Shegaon.\n\nOne of his biographies known as Shree Gajanan Maharaj Charitra-Kosh was authored by Dasbhargav or Bhargavram Yeodekar, a native of Shegaon. The biography mentions various versions of Gajanan Maharaj’s origins. While at Nashik, Dasbhargav is thought to have met a contemporary saint known as Swami Shivanand Saraswati who was speculated to be of 129 years of age at the time. According to Shivanand he was a Brahmin who had previously met Gajanan Maharaj during 1887 at Nashik. He informed Dasbhargav about the period when Gajanan Maharaj appeared in Shegaon where he lived for the remainder of his life. He claimed to have made around 25 to 30 number of visits to Gajanan Maharaj during this period. Shivanand Swami also declared that he would often visit Dadasaheb Khaparde, a resident at Amravati and stay with his family at their residence during these visits. It is claimed that Shivanand Swami later travelled to the Himalayas and was never seen again (according to pages 362–365 of the aforementioned biography that details the conversation between Dasbhargav and Shivanand Swami). It is also believed that Shivanand Swami may have been a former resident at Sajjangad, Maharashtra, also where the prominent 17th-century saint and philosopher Samarth Ramdas lived for many years. Gajanan Maharaj was an ardent user of marijuana and hashish which is exemplified in almost all available images in the public domain from the time of his attaining samadhi.Even the temple premises where he attained samadhi had a smoking choola as a symbolic representation.\n\nAnother biography of Gajanan Maharaj known as Shree Gajanan Vijay was composed by Das Ganu who was born at Akolner. Das Ganu who was initially named Narayan by his maternal relatives had at some point moved to Ahmednagar, Maharashtra where his father had been a care-taker of a property. He was later renamed as Ganesh and his grandfather often called him Ganu, a shorter version of his name. When he arrived at Pandharpur, Das Ganu was contacted by a resident at Shegaon, Ramchandra Krishnaji Patil who was also a devotee of Gajanan Maharaj. He advised Das Ganu to write a biography on Gajanan Maharaj.\n\nIt is believed that he had once visited Nashik, Maharashtra and the surrounding pilgrimage sites including Kapiltirtha. He lived at Kapiltirtha for around 12 years.[5] Contemporaries of Gajanan Maharaj identified him by several names such as Gin Gine Buwa, Ganpat Buwa, and Awaliya Baba.\n\nAccording to his biography Shree Gajanan Vijay, Gajanan Maharaj used to consider a few other spiritual personalities such as Narasingji, Vasudevanand Saraswati (Tembhe Swami Maharaj) and Sai Baba of Shirdi as brothers. Gajanan Maharaj appeared as the Hindu deity Vitthala in Pandharapur for his one devotees Bapuna Kale. He also appeared as Samarth Ramdas for another devotee.\n\nThere are some similarities between Gajanan Maharaj and Swami Samarth of Akkalkot, another Hindu guru and mystic. They both were Paramahans and AjanBahu. They represent different forms taken from the same source .\n\nHe is regarded as an enlightened being.[citation needed] He received a significant following in Maharashtra and thousands visit the Shegaon temple every year. According to the Shree Gajanan Vijay, he was an exponent of three streams of Yoga i.e. Karma, Bhakti and Gyan Yoga.\n\nAppearances and divine powers\n\nAccording to a legend, a money lender named Bankat Lal Agarwal first saw Gajanan Maharaj in a “superconscious state” on 23 February 1878 on a street, eating leftover food which was thrown (and thus spreading the message of food is life and food should not be wasted). Sensing him to be not an ordinary man who needs food to eat but a Yogi, Bankat took him home and asked Maharaj to stay with him. In his lifetime, he performed many miracles such as giving a fresh lease on life to one Janrao Deshmukh, lighting the clay-pipe without fire, filling a dry well with water, drawing sugar cane juice by twisting canes with his hands, curing leprosy of a man, curing himself of the many bites of honey bees, etc. Some of the above acts are because Shri Gajanan Maharaj knew Yoga Shastra on his own admission in the book by Shri Das Ganu Maharaj.\n\nDuring a public meeting on the occasion of Shiv Jayanti, the great freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak met Gajanan Maharaj. When Tilak delivered a charismatic speech, Maharaj predicted that Tilak would get a very harsh sentence by the British Raj. Maharaj’s words did come true, however, Tilak is said to have taken blessings of Maharaj and his Prasad which helped him in writing his book – Shrimadh Bhagvad Gita Rahasya, which is the summarised version of the holy book of Hindus, the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nShree Gajanan Maharaj took Samadhi on 8 September 1910. His earthly remains were buried and a temple in his name is built on his Samadhi at Shegaon. Maharaj was prescient and had predicted his time on this earth was close to getting over. His devotees had started building the temple in his honour for some time before his Samadhi-din. In fact, his Samadhi mandir is just below the temple of Shri Ram. It is said that Shri Gajanan Maharaj would routinely worship at the temple of Shri Ram during his lifetime. Shri Gajanan Maharaj was fond of smoking ganja in his chilam and is supposed to have also started a dhooni (loosely meaning hearth, but representing a glowing chilum[check spelling]) during his lifetime. The dhooni is still burning and is located very near the Samadhi mandir. At the time when he filled a dry well with water, the saint who had denied him water, saying all wells here are dry, Shri Bhaskar Maharaj Jayle, later went on to become his big devotee. Bhaskar Maharaj’s grandson, Shri Vasudeva Maharaj Jayle was also a great devotee of Gajanan Maharaj, whose Shraddhasagar Ashram in Akot is a spiritual place for devotees in nearby areas.\n\nShri Sant Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan\n\nIn the presence of Gajanan Maharaj, Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan, a body of 12 trustees was formed on 12 September 1908 so as to commemorate the holy place which Maharaj had hinted Ya Jagi Rahil Re (It will be at this place) about his place and day for Samadhi. Shri Gajanan Maharaj Mandir is located below the temple of Shri Ram. In the same area, there is the place where the Dhooni is burning. Also nearby, the Dhooni is the place where the devotees can see Maharaj’s paduka (wooden sandals), the temple of Vithoba and Rukmini and the temple of Hanuman. There is an umbar tree just near the temple of Hanuman and it is said to have been in existence since the days of Shri Gajanan Maharaj.\n\nShivshankar Patil is the head of the trust Educational institutions run by the trust are located at Shegaon and are affiliated to Amravati University. These colleges are one of the best institutes for engineering education in the Vidarbha region. The Anand Sagar project for tourists was developed in 2005 by the trust and spans over 650 acres. It is one of the largest amusement places in Maharashtra. Shegaon is on the main line Mumbai-Howrah route. Most of the trains which are going to Howrah stops for around 2–3 minutes at Shegaon.\n\nSaptashrungi or Saptashringi (Marathi: सप्तशृङ्गि, Saptaśrr̥ṇgī) is a site of Hindu pilgrimage situated 60 kilometres (37 mi) from Nashik in Indian state of Maharashtra. According to Hindu traditions, the goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells within the seven mountain peaks. (Sapta means seven and shrung means peaks.) It is located in Nanduri, Kalwan taluka, a small village near Nashik in India. The Marathas and some Hindu tribes worship the goddess from a long time and some worship as their kuldaivat. There are 510 steps to climb the gad. Devotees visit this place in large numbers every day. The temple is also known popularly as one of the “three and half Shakti Peethas” of Maharashtra. The temple is also one among the 51 Shakti Peethas located on the Indian subcontinent and is a location where one of Sati’s (wife of Lord Shiva) limbs, her right arm is reported to have fallen. Its half shaktipeeth among three and half shaktipeeth of Maharashtra\n\nGeography\n\nSaptashrungi is a hill range consisting of seven hills locally called Ghads and form part of the Sahyadri Range of hills in Western Ghats. Sahyadri Range is also known as Ajanta Satmala Range and the average height of the peaks is 4,500 feet (1,400 m). The Dhodap, in the center of this mountain range, is the highest peak with an elevation of 4,600 feet (1,400 m), and Saptashrungi is towards its west.There are 108 water bodies (ponds) located in the watershed of these hills, which are called Kundas. Nanduri, Kalwan and Vani are the villages nearest to the temple, which are situated at the foot of the hills. There are many approaches to reach the top of the temple location. The route from Nashik and Vani via Dindori is 39 kilometres (24 mi) and via Pimpalgaon Baswant is 51 kilometres (32 mi). The route via Nadurgaon village is the easiest and is 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) from Vani.It is at a distance of 60 kilometres (37 mi) from Nashik, the district headquarters. The State Highway 17 (Maharashtra) (SH-17) connected with the National Highway 3 (NH 3) links Nashik with the temple site near the villages of Vani and Nanduri. Bus facilities by state transportation are available to reach the temple precincts. The forests in the hills are reported to have medicinal herbs. There is a circumlocutory path used by pilgrims to do parikrama around the temple. This path is in an elevation range between 1,230 metres (4,040 ft) and 1,350 metres (4,430 ft), and is stated to be in steep rock topography.[3] The hills are covered with verdant forests.\n\nBackground\n\nThree and a half Shakti Peethas (prominent seats of the Hindu Goddess) are reported in Maharashtra. These four Goddess temples are Mahalakshmi Temple at Kolhapur, Tulja Bhavani Temple at Tuljapur, Renuka Temple at Mahur (Matripur) and the Saptashrungi Temple of Vani. These four temples are also interpreted to represent the four parts of holy AUM, A kara, U kara, Ma kara and Mmm kara (Ardha matra). Though which of these is a ardha-peetha (a half Shakti Peetha, considered lower in importance to a complete Shakti Peetha) is disputed, Saptashrungi is generally regarded to be a half Shakti Peetha.However, the official site of the temple declares it as a complete Shakti Peetha. The three presiding deities of the Goddess-oriented scripture Devi Mahatmya in the Saptashrungi are considered a combined manifestation of the three goddesses which are equated with Mahalakshmi of Kolhapur, Mahasaraswati of Tuljapur and Mahakali of Mahur.\n\nThe Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions Saptashringa hills as a Shakti Peetha. However, no other major religious scriptures accord the Saptashrungi temple this status.\n\nThe presiding goddess of the temple is also known by other names as: Saptashrungi (“(goddess) of seven hills”), Saptashrunga-nivasini (“one who resides on Saptashrunga – the seven hills”), Saptashrunga-mata (“the mother-(goddess) of Saptashrunga”). The suffix Devi (goddess) may be added to the first two names. She is also known as Brahmasvarupini (“one who has form of Brahman”). The goddess is reported to have appeared from the kamandalu (water-pot) of the creator-god Brahma.\n\nThe Goddess had taken the form of Durga (exalted in the Devi Mahatmaya) and slew the buffalo-demon Mahishasura, who troubled the universe.[6] After that the Goddess is believed to be settled here. As the Goddess took form here and resided at Saptashrungi, it is considered the original location of the Goddess.\n\nThis temple is one among the 51 Shakti peethas located on the Indian subcontinent and is a location where one of Sati’s limbs, her right arm is considered to have fallen when grief-stricken and agitated Shiva was carrying her dead body round the world on his shoulders, and Vishnu had cut her body into pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra. The story behind this event is that King Prajapati Daksha, father of Sati (the incarnation of Goddess Parvati, wife of Lord Shiva), was performing a yagna (yagna is defined as a Hindu fire ritual sacrifice when deities of the Vedic times like Agni, the fire god, and others were invoked by offering oblations such as ghee (clarified butter), milk, grains and so forth) called as Brihaspatirityadi. Sati (also called Shakti) who was Lord Shiva’s wife, attended the function without invitation. Daksha who was not fond of his son-in-law, as he considered him a mendicant, purposely did not invite him for the yagna, while he invited all other gods. Sati felt deeply insulted by the slight shown by her father towards her husband whom she had married out of deep love. Even then she decided to attend the yagna uninvited by her own father. When she went there, her father compounded the insult by totally ignoring her presence and vilifying Shiva. Sati felt deeply humiliated and hurt, and then in frustration she jumped into the yagna fire and committed suicide. When this news was conveyed to Shiva, first he sent his assistant to the site to enquire and take revenge. Shiva also came to the yagna site and created a furor. In a state of grief and anger he put Sati’s dead body on his shoulders and started wandering round the universe. Looking at this grave situation, Brahma and Vishnu decided to intervene and bring back Shiva to his normal self. It was then decided that Vishnu will follow behind Shiva, and with his Sudarsha Chakra cut Sati’s dead body into pieces. Thus Vishnu cut her into 51 pieces (108 pieces are also mentioned in many Puranic texts[6]) as Shiva traveled around the world and these fifty one body parts of Sati fell at different locations in the subcontinent, and all these places came to be known as Shakthi Peethas (abode of goddess Shakthi or Durga). Her right arm fell on the Saptashrungi hills and the place became holy, and a Shakthi Peeth came to be established here.[8]\n\nIt is also said that when the demon king Mahishasura was creating havoc in the forests, the devatas and people urged Durga to kill the demon. Then the 18 armed Saptashrungi Devi took the form of Durga and slayed Mahishasura, and since then she is also known as Mahishasura Mardhini.[6] Mahishasura was in the form of a buffalo. At the foot of the hill, from where one starts climbing the steps, there is the head of a buffalo, made in stone, which is believed to be of demon Mahishasura.[12]\n\nIn the epic Ramayana war, when Lakshmana was lying unconscious in the war field, Hanuman came to Saptashrungi hills in search of medicinal herbs to restore his life.[1]\n\nSaptashrung mountain was a part of the forest called Dandakaranya mentioned in the Ramayana. It is mentioned that Lord Rama, along with Seeta, and Lakshmana had come to these hills to pray to the goddess and seek her blessings.[6]\n\nIn the hill of Markandeye, named after Sage Markandeya, there is a cave which is said to have been the abode of the sage. This hill is located to the east of Saptashringi and a deep ravine divides the two hills. While staying in this cave, Markandeya is believed to have recited puranas (Hindu scriptures) to entertain the Devi.\n\nAnother local myth is that a tiger resides in the garbagriaha (sanctum sanctorum) every night and a keeps a watch on the temple but goes away before sunrise.\n\nYet another myth is that when a person was trying to destroy a beehive, the Devi appeared before him to prevent the act.\n\nThere are many other recent narratives extolling the divinity of the goddess, which are also linked to Shirdi Sai Baba and his devotees. In one such narration, a priest of Vani village known as Kakaji Vaidya who was working in the Saptashrungi Temple was quite disturbed by the miseries of life around him and he, therefore, appealed to the goddess to give him peace of mind and relieve him from all worries. Pleased with the priest’s devotion to her, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the Baba to set his mind at rest and in peace. As the priest was then not aware of which Baba she meant, he thought it was the Shiva at Trimabakeshwar temple and so he went there and offered worship to Shiva and stayed there for a few days. In the process, he still did not get the feeling of peace and his restless mood continued. He came back to Vani village disheartened. Then, every day after taking bath in the morning he offered prayers to Shiva Linga by reciting Rudra mantra from the Yajurveda, for many days. He still did not get peace of mind. He then went back to the Mata temple and appealed to her to give relief to his restless mind. That night she appeared in his dream and told that the Baba she meant was Sai Samarth of Shirdi and that he should go there. The priest did not know the whereabouts of Sai Baba. Sai Baba through his divine psychic perception realised the need of the priest and so he sent his most loving devotee Madhavarao to meet the priest and bring him to his presence. Coincidentally, Madhavrao had also gone there at the advice of Baba to also offer two silver breasts to the goddess as his mother had forgotten to fulfill her vow of gifting the silver breasts to the goddess. When Madhavarao went to Vani village the priest met him and came to know that he had come from Shirdi to offer silver breast to the goddess. The priest was very pleased, and also for the first time felt peace of mind. He then took Madhavarao to the temple where the silver breasts were placed at the feet of the goddess in the sanctum as a fulfilment of his mother’s vow. The priest then came to Shirdi with Madhavarao and had darshan of the Sai Baba and stayed there for 12 days and felt very peaceful. He then returned to Vani.\n\nVijaydurg (sometimes written as Viziadurg), the oldest fort on the Sindhudurg coast, was constructed during the regime of Raja Bhoja II of the Shilahar dynasty (construction period 1193-1205) and restructured by Shivaji.\n\nEarlier, the fort encompassed an area of 5 acres (20,000 m2) and was surrounded by sea on all four sides. Over the years the eastern trench was reclaimed and a road constructed thereon. Presently the area of fort is about 17 acres (69,000 m2) and is surrounded by the Arabian Sea on three sides. Shivaji extended the area of the fort by constructing three walls on the eastern side, each 36 metres high. He also constructed 20 bastions.\n\nVijaydurg Fort was called the “Eastern Gibraltar”, as it was virtually impregnable. Its locational advantages include the 40 km long Waghotan/Kharepatan creek. Large vessels cannot enter the shallow water of this creek. Also, Maratha warships could be anchored in this creek and yet remain invisible from the sea. It is a protected monument.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1653, Shivaji captured this fort from Adil Shah of Bijapur and renamed it as “Vijay Durg”. The original name of the fort was “Gheria” and the first fortification appears to have been constructed in 1200 during the regime of Raja Bhoj II. Shivaji developed Vijaydurg as an important base for Maratha warships.\n\nMaratha Empire looked to be in a decline after the death of Shivaji in 1680, when his son and successor Sambhaji was captured by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and brutally tortured to death on 21 March 1689. Later in that year, the fort of Raigad fell in the hand of Mughals. Wife of Shambhaji and his infant son Shahu along with many others were captured and were treated as state prisoners.\n\nShivaji’s second wife’s son Raja Ram then took in charge of the Maratha Empire. Inspired by the valiant death of Shambhaji, they fought back against the Mughals. It was during his reign Kanhoji Angre alias Conajee Angria became Koli admiral of naval army of the Marathas. In 1698, Kanhoji made Vijaydurg the capital of his territory along the coast.\n\nIn 1700, Raja Ram died. Tara Bai, the brave widow of Raja Ram took over the control of the Maratha Empire. Putting her infant son on the Maratha throne styled as “Shivaji II”, Tara Bai led successful operations against the Mughal from 1700 to 1707. Taking advantage of the discomfiture of Shivaji’s ruling house Kanhoji Angre became the most “Powerful and independent Naval Chief of West coast of India”. Tarabai gave Kanhoji title of Sarkhel (Admiral). At one time Kanhoji Angre was master of the whole coast from Bombay (Now Mumbai) to Vengurla.\n\nAurangzeb died in 1707 and Shahu was released from the clutches of Mughals. He challenged Tarabai and her son’s legitimacy to the Maratha throne. The Marathas were divided but ultimately Shahu won the right to the throne as Chhatrapati and Tarabai was retreated to rule a small area of Kolhapur under the name of his son Shivaji II in 1713. She was later overthrown and imprisoned till her death by her husband’s second wife Rajas Bai.\n\nIn the same year, Shahuji sent his Peshwa (Prime Minister), Balaji Vishwanath from his headquarters at Satara to negotiate with Kanhoji Angre. Kanhoji agreed to acknowledge allegiance to Satara and shift his loyalty from Tarabai. In return Kanhoji was confirmed command of the Maratha fleet, and granted twenty-six forts and fortified places with their dependent villages.\n\nVijaydurg is said to be the oldest fort in Sindhudurg coast. In the Pre-Independence era it was also known as “Eastern Gibraltar”. This is because the fort was almost unconquerable. Under the leadership of Kanhoji Angre, it withstood many naval attacks by the British and the Dutch. Kanhoji Angre died on 4 July 1729 and the Angres control of the fort ended in 1756, after the Peshwa-British Alliance defeated the Angres clan. In 1818 Vijaydurg was completely in the hand of the British Empire.[4]\n\nBattle of Vijaydurg\n\nBattle of Vijaydurg\n\nThe Capture of Gheria\n\nDate Jan-Feb 1756 Location\n\nVijaydurg Fort, Maharashtra, India\n\nResult British & Peshwa victory\n\nBelligerents Maratha Empire East India Company\n\nNanasaheb Peshwa\n\nCommanders and leaders Tulaji Angre Admiral Watson\n\nNanasaheb Peshwa\n\nStrength 2000 men\n\n250 cannons200 ships 500 British marines\n\n20 British ships1000 Marathas under Peshwa Casualties and losses 500+ men\n\nTulaji Angre arrestedFort captured by British Marines Nil\n\nAfter the death of Kanhoji Angre, there were two short reigns by Sarfoji and Sambhaji. The two brothers Manaji and Tulaji started fighting for the Angre throne. Nanasaheb Peshwe had intervened in the disputes between Manaji and Tulaji. This created two spheres of influence, Manaji in the north at Kulaba and Tulaji in the south at Vijaydurg. Tulaji Angre was favored by Shahu and was appointed as Sarkhel (Admiral) of the Maratha Navy. This was against the will of Nanasaheb Peshwa.\n\nSarkhel Tulaji\n\nTulaji was brave and a much more skillful seaman than Manaji. This had gained him the favor of Shahu. In a brief span, he had surpassed the record of his predecessors in the number of English ships captured: Charlotte of Madras, William of Bombay, Svern of Bengal and, Darby, Restoration, Pilot, Augusta and Dadabhoi of Surat. He had also captured Anjanvel from the Siddis of Janjira. Another reason for the Peshwa to go against Tulaji was that, Tulaji refused to admit the Peshwa as his superior, maintaining that both were equal servants of the Chhatrapati. He refused to pay revenue contribution and even annoyed the Peshwa by raiding his territory. Nanasaheb could do nothing as long as Shahu was alive, but after his death in 1749, Peshwa was free to wreck his vengeance on Tulaji.\n\nDeath of Shahu and rise of Peshwa\n\nAfter the death of Shahu, Peshwa was the next most influential ruler among the ones with huge armies and numerous land forts under his command or at his disposal under ownership of his vassals. Nanasaheb sought assistance of the English at Bombay to end Tulaji’s reign. A treaty was signed according to which a ground force under command of the Peshwa and a naval force under command of the Company would attack and destroy Tulaji. Among other articles, the treaty provided that Fort Vijaydurg, when captured, would be given to the Peshwa.\n\nFall of Suvarnadurg\n\nIn 1755, Commodore James of Bombay attacked the fort Suvarnadurg while the Peshwa’s army started capturing land and other coastal forts of Angre. This isolated Suvarnadurg from landward. Commodore James first bombarded the fort from the west. 800 shots and shells were expended at a range of 100 yards, but the walls did not collapse. He then entered the channel between the fort and the coast and fired on the eastern face as well as the main gate. Both gave way. Some of the garrison tried to escape from the fort by a tunnel running into the sea, but were discovered and killed. Considerable damage had been caused inside the fort by the bombardment and the garrison, finding no hope of relief or reinforcements, surrendered. Commodore James returned to Bombay for the monsoons.\n\nAttack on Vijaydurg\n\nAfter the fall of Suvarnadurg and all other forts of the Angre, Vijaydurg was the only fort left under the command of Tulaji. In 1756, a large force under Admiral Watson converged on Vijaydurg. Watson had arrived at Bombay from eastern waters and had with him Colonel Clive with 500 marines. The English ships took station with Watson flying his flag on the Protector. Two bomb vessels were in the extreme east. The Maratha ships were anchored at the mouth of the creek, close to the fort. They all were bunched up, almost hull to hull. Amongst these was the Company’s ship Restoration, which caught fire. The fire spread rapidly till the entire Angre fleet was destroyed, The bombardment of the fort had caused considerable damage inside the fort and magazine had been blown up.\n\nFall of Vijaydurg\n\nTulaji, meanwhile had left the fort and gone to the Peshwa’s camp seeking a negotiation but was promptly arrested and sent to one of the inland forts as a prisoner. The garrison was asked to surrender and in the absence of any response Clive landed his marines on 11 February 1756, entered and captured the fort. A huge amount of booty was captured. 250 pieces of cannons, stores and ammunition, 100,000 Rupees and 30,000 in valuable items fell into English hands. Vijaydurg was not handed over immediately to the Peshwa as per the terms of the treaty. It was eventually given up but only after the Company obtained Bankot in exchange.\n\nEnd of Maratha Naval Supremacy\n\nThe battle of Vijaydurg marks the end of the Maratha Navy as a potent force. The Maratha Admiral Dhulap captured some ships later. The Sawants of Sawantwadi, the Chhatrapati of Kolhapur and the Gaikwads of Baroda, all had a few ships. But the command of the seas, for all practical purposes had passed to the Company permanently. they achieved this in 1756 only because of the alliance with the Peshwa.\n\nFeatures of Architectural Interest\n\nAccording to unconfirmed reports, there is a 200 meter long, undersea tunnel from the fort to the palatial Dhulap house in the village. Supposedly, the roof of the tunnel has been pinched to protect it from landslides and it is also well ventilated. Now the tunnel is partially blocked. If the presence of the tunnel can be confirmed, and the tunnel cleared, it could serve as a tourist attraction of historical and architectural interest.\n\nRecent oceanographic evidence supports the existence of an undersea wall, constructed out at sea at a depth of 8–10 meter depth undersea. Made of laterite, the wall is estimated to be 122 meter long, 3 meter high & 7 meter broad. Attacking ships often met a watery grave after colliding against this wall. When the Siddhi of Janjira was going to attack Vijaydurg, he got a message from Portuguese telling him that they had lost 2 of their ships while they were nearing the fort.\n\n1.5 km from the fort up the Waghotan Creek, exist the remains of a naval dock carved from rock. This is where Maratha warships were built and repaired. The ships built here were of the 400-500 tonnage capacity. This 109 meter long and 70 meter wide dock faces the north side and is an achievement of Maratha naval architecture. Most of the smaller ships used to be docked near this small inner port. The southern and eastern side is cut out of a natural rock and rest is dry masonry. In addition to this a number of grapnel and triangular stone anchors were noticed in the adjoining area of dockyard.\n\nOn the other hill in front of the fort a wall was built to deceive the enemy. When the enemy attacked the wall, he had already wasted his ammunition and before he could understand, he would be attacked by Marathas from the rear side.\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India had undertaken restoration and repair works for Maratha forts in Maharashtra which included Vijaydurg Fort along with Shivneri and Sindhudurg Fort.\n\nThe fort has many monuments, now in ruins which show the characteristics of Maratha architecture. The food storage and court are such classic examples.\n\nThis fort also has a Khalbatkhana, where important meetings were held. There are only 3 forts that had a Khalbatkhana. They are Rajgad, Raigad and Vijaydurg.\n\nVIDEO OF VIJAYDURG\n\nhttps://youtu.be/C37QAn7fQ6s\n\nMahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingams, shrines which are said to be the most sacred abodes of Shiva. It is located in the ancient city of Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The temple is situated on the side of the holy river Shipra. The presiding deity, Shiva in the lingam form is believed to be Swayambhu, deriving currents of power (Shakti) from within itself as against the other images and lingams that are ritually established and invested with mantra-shakti.\n\nThe idol of Mahakaleshwar is known to be dakshinamukhi, which means that it is facing the south. This is a unique feature, upheld by the tantric shivnetra tradition to be found only in Mahakaleshwar among the 12 Jyotirlingas. The idol of Omkareshwar Mahadev is consecrated in the sanctum above the Mahakal shrine. The images of Ganesh, Parvati and Karttikeya are installed in the west, north, and east of the sanctum sanctorum. To the south is the image of Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva. The idol of Nagchandreshwar on the third storey is open for darshan only on the day of Nag Panchami. The temple has five levels, one of which is underground. The temple itself is located in a spacious courtyard surrounded by massive walls near a lake. The shikhar or the spire is adorned with sculptural finery. Brass lamps light the way to the underground sanctum. It is believed that prasada (holy offering) offered here to the deity can be re-offered unlike all other shrines.\n\nThe presiding deity of time, Shiva, in all his splendor, reigns eternally in the city of Ujjain. The temple of Mahakaleshwar, its shikhar soaring into the sky, an imposing façade against the skyline, evokes primordial awe and reverence with its majesty. The Mahakal dominates the life of the city and its people, even in the midst of the busy routine of modern preoccupations, and provides an unbreakable link with ancient Hindu traditions.\n\nOn the day of Maha Shivaratri, a huge fair is held near the temple, and worship goes on through the night.\n\nDevotees are not allowed to bring bags , mobile phones and cameras during the visit . Lockers and Cloak Rooms are there for devotees where they can keep their belongings.\n\nAlso an awesome spectacle, with huge participation of devotees, is the procession of God Mahakaal in his Palanquin, called Shahi Savaari, to the river Kshipra, on last Monday of the holy period of Sawaan during the months of Shraavana or Bhadrapada\n\nReferences in Hindu scriptures\n\nAccording to the Puranas, the city of Ujjain was called Avantika and was famous for its beauty and its status as a devotional epicenter. It was also one of the primary cities where students went to study holy scriptures. According to legend, there was a ruler of Ujjain called Chandrasena, who was a pious devotee of Shiva and worshiped him all the time. One day, a farmer’s boy named Shrikhar was walking on the grounds of the palace and heard the King chant the Shiva’s name and rushed to the temple to start praying with him. However, the guards removed him by force and sent him to the outskirts of the city near the river Kshipra. Rivals of Ujjain, primarily King Ripudamana and King Singhaditya of the neighboring kingdoms decided to attack the Kingdom and take over its treasures around this time. Hearing this, Shrikhar started to pray and the news spread to a priest named Vridhi. He was shocked to hear this and upon the urgent pleas of his sons, started to pray to Shiva at the river Kshipra. The Kings chose to attack and were successful; with the help of the powerful demon Dushan, who was blessed by Brahma to be invisible, they plundered the city and attacked all the devotees of Shiva.\n\nUpon hearing the pleas of His helpless devotees, Shiva appeared in his Mahakala form and destroyed the enemies of King Chandrasena. Upon the request of his devotees Shrikhar and Vridhi, Shiva agreed to reside in the city and become the chief deity of the Kingdom and take care of it against its enemies and to protect all His devotees. From that day on, Shiva resided in His light form as Mahakala in a Lingam that was formed on its own from the powers of Shiva and his consort, Parvati. Shiva also blessed his devotees and declared that people who worshipped Him in this form would be free from the fear of death and diseases. Also, they would be granted worldly treasures and be under the protection of the Shiva himself.\n\nBharthari was the elder son of King Gandharva-Sena, and received the kingdom of Ujjain from the celestial god Indra and the King of Dhara.\n\nWhen Bharthari was king of ‘Ujjayani’ (modern-day Ujjain) in his state there lived a Brahman who after years of austerities was given the fruit of immortality from the celestial tree of Kalpavriksha. The Brahman presented the same to his monarch, Raja Bharthari, who in turn, passed it on to his love, the beautiful, Pinglah Rani or Ananga Sena Raja Bhartrhari’s last and youngest wife. The queen, being in love with the Head police officer of the state, Mahipaala, presented the fruit to him, who further passed it on to his beloved, Lakha, one of the maids of honour. Eventually, Lakha being in love with the king presented the fruit back to the king. Having completed the circle, the fruit revealed the downsides of infidelity to the king, he summoned the queen and ordered her beheading, and ate the fruit himself. After that, he abdicated the throne, and became a religious mendicant.\n\nHe later became a disciple of Pattinatthar who first indulged in an argument about samsari and sanyasi with king Bhartrhari. Later during the conversation pattinathar said that all women have ‘dual mind’ and it might be the true case even with Parameswari. King conveyed this news to Rani Pingalah and she ordered Pattinathar to get punished and to sit in kalu maram (tree, whose top portion would be sharpened like a pencil and whole tree is fully coated with oil, a person who is punished to sit in the top will be split into 2 pieces), they tried to kill Pattinathar, but Kalu Maram started burning and nothing happened to Pattinathar, the king came to know this news and went directly to Pattinathar and asked him to get ready to die the next day, but Pattinathar replied, ” I’m ready right now, to die”. The next day king came with tears in his eyes and released saint from jail because he actually noticed Queen Pingalah in love with horsemen that night, He threw away his empire, wealth, even full coat dress and dressed in a simple kovanam (loincloth), the king became a disciple of Pattinatthar and got moksha (salvation) in the Srikalahasteeshwara Temple in Andhra Pradesh which houses the Vayu Lingam, a part of the Pancha Bhoota Sthalams of Shiva.\n\nKalidasa (c. 2nd–1st century BCE), the great Sanskrit poet of the times who was probably a contemporary of king Pushyamitra Sunga, has mentioned about the rituals of the temple in his works in Meghadūta. He mentions about the nada-aradhana, the performance of art and dance during the evening rituals.\n\nHistory\n\nThe temple complex was destroyed by Sultan Shams-ud-din Iltutmish during his raid of Ujjain in 1234-5.The Jyotirlinga was dismantled and believed to be thrown into a nearby ‘Kotiteerth Kunda’ (a pond neighbouring the temple) with the Jaladhari (a structure supporting the Lingam) stolen during the invasion.\n\nThe present structure was built by the Maratha general Ranoji Shinde in 1734 CE after Baji Rao I appointed him to collect taxes in malwa region. Further developments and management was done by other members of shinde dynasty, including Mahadji Shinde (1730–12 February 1794) and Daulat Rao Shinde’s wife Baiza Bai. (1827–1863). During the reign of Jayajirao Shinde (until 1886), major programs of the then Gwalior State used to be held at this temple. ]\n\nThe Maratha Empire regime was established in Ujjain in the 4th decade of the 18th Century. The administration of Ujjain was assigned by Peshwa Bajirao-I to his faithful commander Ranoji Shinde, The Diwan of Ranoji was Sukhatanakar Ramchandra Baba Shenavi who was very wealthy he decided to invest his wealth for religious purposes. In this connection, he re-built the Mahakaleshwar Temple during the 4th-5th decades of the 18th Century.\n\nAfter India became independent in 1947, the Mahakaleshwar Dev Sthan Trust was replaced by the municipal corporation of Ujjain. Nowadays it is under the collectorate office of Ujjain districrt.\n\nEllora to Shirdi 103km 3hrs\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/7Tai6hU1wgjse5yd8\n\nSai Baba of Shirdi, also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees as a saint and a fakir. He is revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees during, as well as after his lifetime.\n\nSai Baba is now revered as an incarnation of Sri Dattatreya and considered as Saguna Brahma by his devotees. He is attributed to be the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of this universe by his devotees. He is decorated with jewels and all forms of Hindu Vedic deities as he is believed by his followers to be the supreme God.\n\nAccording to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of realization of the self and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to God and guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.[4]\n\nSai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains unclear if he was a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba.[5] His teachings combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived,[6] practiced both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone’s Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall look to you[4] and Allah tera bhala Karega.[7]\n\nBackground\n\nSai Baba’s date of birth including his birthplace remains unknown and is debatable due to lack of evidence and no definitive information exists to prove it. Most definitive information about Shirdi Sai Baba tends to be derived from a book called Shri Sai Satcharitra written by a disciple called Hemadpant (also known as Annasaheb Dabholkar / Govind Raghunath) in 1922 in Marathi.[8] The book itself is a compilation based on accounts by his various disciples and Hemadpant’s personal observations observing Sai Baba from 1910 onwards.[9]\n\nSai Baba’s real name remains unknown. The name Sai was given to him by Mhalsapati when he arrived at Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word Sai refers to a religious mendicant[10] but can also mean God. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages, the term Baba is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man, or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes holy father, saintly father, or (venerable) poor old man.[5]\n\nSome of Sai Baba’s disciples became famous as spiritual figures and saints, such as Mahalsapati, a priest of the Khandoba temple in Shirdi, and Upasni Maharaj. He was revered by other saints as well, such as Saint Bidkar Maharaj, Saint Gagangiri Maharaj, Saint Janakidas Maharaj, and Sati Godavari Mataji.[11][12] Sai Baba referred to several saints as ‘my brothers’, especially the disciples of Swami Samartha of Akkalkot.[12]\n\nEarly years\n\nSai Baba (right) and some of his devotees at Dwarakamai, his own temple.\n\nSai Baba with some devotees\n\nAlthough Sai Baba’s origins are unknown, some indications exist that suggest that he was born not far from Shirdi. Historical researches into genealogies in Shirdi give support to the theory that Baba could have been born with the name Haribhau Bhusari.[13] Baba was notorious for giving vague, misleading, and contradictory replies to questions concerning his parentage and origins, brusquely stating the information was unimportant. He had reportedly stated to a close follower, Mahalsapati, that he has been born of Deshastha Brahmin[14] parents in the village of Pathri and had been entrusted into the care of a fakir in his infancy.[15] On another occasion, Baba reportedly said that the fakir’s wife had left him in the care of a Hindu guru, Venkusa of Selu and that he had stayed with Venkusa for 12 years as his disciple.[16] This dichotomy has given rise to two major theories regarding Baba’s background, with the majority of writers supporting the Hindu background over the Islamic, while others combine both the theories (that Sai Baba was first brought up by a fakir and then by a guru).[6]\n\nBaba reportedly arrived at the village of Shirdi in the Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra, India, when he was about sixteen years old. Although there is no agreement among biographers about the date of this event, it is generally accepted that Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year, and returned permanently around 1858, just after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. This posits a possible birth year of 1838.[17] He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a neem tree and meditating while sitting in an asana. The Sai Satcharita recounts the reaction of the villagers\n\nThe people of the village were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practicing hard penance, not minding heat or cold. By day he associated with no one, by night he was afraid of nobody.[18]\n\nHis presence attracted the curiosity of the villagers and the religiously-inclined such as Mhalsapati, Appa Jogle, and Kashinatha regularly visited him, while others such as the village children considered him mad and threw stones at him.[19] After some time he left the village and it is unknown where he stayed at that time or what happened to him. However, there are some indications that he met with many saints and fakirs and worked as a weaver; he claimed to have fought with the army of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.[20]\n\nReturn to Shirdi\n\nSai Baba in his usual attire\n\nSai Baba returned to Shirdi in 1858. He appeared at the Khandoba Mandir in Shirdi. The temple priest, Mahalsapati, upon seeing him for the very first time, welcomed him by saying ‘Aao, Sai!’ (‘Come Sai’). From then on, He was known by the name (Sai Baba).\n\nAround this time he adopted his famous style of dressing, consisting of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported ‘long hair flowing down to the end of his spine’ when he arrived in Shirdi and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing.[21] This attire contributed to Baba’s identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.[22]\n\nFor four to five years, Baba lived under a neem tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. His manner was said to be withdrawn and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation.[23] He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque, he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash (‘Udi’) to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and the Qur’an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God’s name (dhikr, and often cryptically expressed himself with the use of parables, symbols, and allegories).[24]\n\nBaba is believed to have grown and cultivated a garden called Lendi Baug, named after a river called Lendi which flowed nearby.[25] The garden continues to be a place visited by pilgrims and has temples, samadhis of people, and animals associated with Shirdi Sai Baba’s life and temples.[26]\n\nIn 1910, Sai Baba’s fame began to spread in Mumbai.[27][28] Numerous people started visiting him because they regarded him as a saint with the power of performing miracles or even as an avatar.[29] They built his first temple at Bhivpuri, Karjat.[30]\n\nFinal years and death (Samadhi)\n\nIn August 1918, Shirdi Sai Baba told some of his devotees that he would soon be “leaving his mortal body” (dying).[31] Towards the end of September, he had a high fever and stopped eating.[32] As his condition deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him and continued to meet visitors. On 15 October 1918, he breathed his last. The day coincided with the Hindu calendar date that year for Vijayadashami.[33][34] His remains were interred at “Buti Wada” in Shirdi, after which it became a place of worship known today as Shree Samadhi Mandir or Shirdi Sai Baba Temple.\n\nTeachings and practices\n\nShirdi Sai Baba, leaning against the wall of his masjid, with devotees\n\nSai Baba opposed all persecution based on religion or caste. He was an opponent of religious orthodoxy — Christian, Hindu, and Muslim.[35]\n\nSai Baba encouraged his devotees to pray, chant God’s name, and read holy scriptures. He told Muslims to study the Qur’an and Hindus to study texts such as the Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita, and Yoga Vasistha.[36] He was impressed by the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita and encouraged people to follow it in their own lives.[37] He advised his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any discrimination, and develop two important features of character: faith (Shraddha) and patience (Saburi). He criticized atheism.[38]\n\nIn his teachings, Sai Baba emphasized the importance of performing one’s duties without attachment to earthly matters and of being content regardless of the situation. In his personal practice, Sai Baba observed worship procedures belonging to Islam; he shunned any kind of regular rituals but allowed the practice of Salah, chanting of Al-Fatiha, and Qur’an readings at Muslim festival times.[39] Occasionally reciting the Al-Fatiha, Baba enjoyed listening to mawlid and qawwali accompanied with the tabla and sarangi twice daily.[40]\n\nSai Baba interpreted the religious texts of both Islam and Hinduism. He explained the meaning of the Hindu scriptures in the spirit of Advaita Vedanta. His philosophy also had numerous elements of bhakti. The three main Hindu spiritual paths — Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga — influenced his teachings.[41]\n\nSai Baba encouraged charity and stressed the importance of sharing. He said\n\nUnless there is some relationship or connection, nobody goes anywhere. If any men or creatures come to you, do not discourteously drive them away, but receive them well and treat them with due respect. Sri Hari (God) will certainly be pleased if you give water to the thirsty, bread to the hungry, clothes to the naked, and your verandah to strangers for sitting and resting. If anybody wants any money from you and you are not inclined to give, do not give, but do not bark at him like a dog.”[42]\n\nWorship and devotees\n\nMain article: Shirdi Sai Baba movement\n\nSai Baba’s Temple in Shirdi\n\nThe Mandir Kalasha Of The Samadhi Mandir, Shirdi\n\nThe Shirdi Sai Baba movement began in the 19th century, while he was living in Shirdi. A local Khandoba priest, Mhalsapati Nagre, is believed to have been his first devotee. In the 19th century, Sai Baba’s followers were only a small group of inhabitants of Shirdi and a few people from other parts of India.\n\nBecause of Sai Baba, Shirdi has become a place of importance and is counted among the major Hindu places of pilgrimage. The first Sai Baba temple is situated at Kudal, Sindhudurg. This temple was built in 1922. It is believed that Sai Baba gave one rupee to Dada Madye Ji with which he built the temple in Kudal.\n\nToday, the Sai Baba Temple in Shirdi is visited by an average of 25,000 pilgrims a day and during religious festivals, this number can reach up to 100,000.[48] The Sai Baba temple in Shirdi is managed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust. Inside the temple, the statue of Sai Baba and the Samadhi is carved out of Italian marble and are seen draped with royal cloth, wearing a gold crown and adorned with fresh flower garlands. The interior is made of old stone bricks. The interior, as well as the exterior (cone) of the temple, is covered with gold. As per rituals and traditions dating back to when Baba was still alive, four Aarti‘s are held daily (corresponding to the time of the day) inside the Samadhi Mandir.\n\nKakad Aarti (The Morning Aarti)at 4:30 (am)\n\nMadhyan Aarti (The Afternoon Aarti)at 12:00 (pm)\n\nDhup Aarti (The Evening Aarti)6:30 (pm)\n\nShe Aarti (The Night Aarti)at 10:30 (pm)\n\nThe Palanquin procession of Sai Baba takes place every Thursday from the Samadhi Mandir to Dwarkamayi, onward to Chavdi, and back to the Sai Baba Mandir. Devotees belonging to all faiths are welcome to take Darshan in the Samadhi Mandir and have free meals in the Prasadalaya, irrespective of caste, creed, and religion as these were one of the ideal principles of Sai Baba.\n\nSai Baba of Shirdi is especially revered and worshiped in the states of Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. In August 2012, an unidentified devotee, for the first time, donated two expensive diamonds valuing ₹11.8 million at the Shirdi temple, as revealed by Saibaba trust officials.\n\nIn recent years, the Shirdi Sai movement has spread to the Caribbean and countries such as Nepal, Canada, United States, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Singapore.\n\nNon-discrimination of devotees\n\nA marble statue of Sai Baba.\n\nBaba himself maintained an ambiguous profile, unwilling to identify with either of the two religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: “You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?” Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing:\n\nIn essence or basic principle, there is no difference between Hindu and Muslim. You took birth in the human body to point out this. You look with affection on both Hindus and Muslims. This, Sai, who pervades all, as the soul of all, shows.\n\nBaba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was “Allah rakhega vaiia rahena”, that is, “Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah.” On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal. His notion of the unity of all mankind that appealed to everyone was very congruous with the Sufism of Islam. “God being one and the master of all also meant that all his creatures were part of one big family,” writes Sikand. “This belief was entirely in keeping with … the teachings of Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation.” Sai Baba urged his Hindu followers to read their holy books and find their own path. For him, all paths were equally valid, “Ishwar” (the Hindu God) and “Allah” being synonymous.\n\nPadukas of sai baba\n\nPeople coming to his abode were so taken aback to see Hindus, Muslims, and others living together so peacefully that in many instances it changed their entire lives and belief systems.\n\nMiracles\n\nSai Baba’s disciples and devotees claim that he performed many miracles such as bilocation, levitation, mindreading, materialization, exorcisms, entering a state of Samādhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines and sticking them back to his body (khandana yoga), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) to people in the form of Sri Rama, Krishna, Vithoba, Shiva, and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.\n\nAccording to his followers, he appeared to them in their dreams and gave them advice. His devotees have documented many stories.\n\nFollowers\n\nSai Baba depicted on a tapestry\n\nSai Baba left behind no spiritual heirs, appointed no disciples, and did not provide formal initiation (Diksha), despite requests. Some of Sai Baba’s notable disciples include Mahalsapathi, Madhav Rao (Shama), Nanasaheb Peshwa, Bayijabai, Tatya Kote Patil, Kakasaheb Dixit, Radhakrishna Maai, Hemadpant, Bhuti, Das Ganu, Lakshmi Bai, Nanavali, Upasni Maharaj, Abdul Baba, Sapatanekar, Nanasaheb Chandodkar, B.V. Narashima Swamiji.[citation needed] Some disciples of Sai Baba achieved fame as spiritual figures, such as Upasni Maharaj of Sakori. After the demise of Sai Baba, his devotees offered the daily Aarti to Upasni Maharaj when he paid a visit to Shirdi twice within 10 years.\n\nHindus\n\nDuring Sai Baba’s lifetime, the Hindu saint Anandanath of Yewala declared Sai Baba to be a “spiritual diamond.”[58] Another saint, Gangagir, also called him a “jewel.” Sri Beedkar Maharaj greatly revered Sai Baba and in 1873, when he met him he bestowed the title Jagad guru upon him. Sai Baba was also greatly respected by Vasudevananda Saraswati (known as Tembye Swami). He was also revered by a group of Shaivism yogis, known as the Nath-Panchayat. He is considered an avatar of the Supreme Reality (Brahman or God), a satguru, or saint, depending on individual proclivities. This is not uncommon in Hinduism where there is no central doctrine or cosmology, but a basis in individual faith and spirituality.\n\nParsis\n\nSaibaba was revered by prominent Zoroastrians such as Nanabhoy Palkhivala, Farhaad Panthaky, and Homi Bhabha, and has been cited as the Zoroastrians’ most popular non-Zoroastrian religious figure.[63]\n\nMeher Baba, who was born into a Zoroastrian family, met Sai Baba once, during World War I, in December 1915. This event is considered the most significant in Meher Baba’s life. Shri Sai Satcharita (Sai Baba’s life story), makes no mention of Meher Baba but Lord Meher, the life story of Meher Baba, there are numerous references to Sai Baba.\n\nMeher Baba, who claimed he was a (the) Avatar, c"
