        "text": "The folklore studies scholar, such as Dorson (1976, Folklore and fakelore: Essays toward the discipline of folk studies, Harvard: Harvard University Press), was emphatic about the distinction between folklore and 'fake lore', one being authentic and the other as invented by the popular industry; however, he paradoxically maintained interest in the contemporariness of folklore. This was a paradox since the contemporariness of folklore is largely, and usually, due to intersections of folk with popular and political. Nevertheless, the emphasis on contemporariness was a harbinger of discussion on the potential dynamics of folklore, and everything buried therein, including value orientation. This essay is guided by the observations emerging from folklore studies, socio-cultural anthropology and performance studies in order to get into a specific case of Bihu, a folk performance inclusive of songs, dance, attires and instruments inter alia in Assam, in the northeast of India. The curious case of Bihu in flux divulges dynamics of value orientation and intersections of identity politics, in the wake of the contemporariness of folklore.\n\nNorthEast India consist seven states namely, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. This region of India is a home land of the different ethnic groups from Mongoloid and Aryan stock. Serpent Lore is a main component of the folklore of this region. From ancient times serpent takes a pivotal role of the folklore of NorthEast India. It percolates in Oral Literature, Material Culture, Social Folk Custom and Performing Folk Arts. Innumerable folk or oral literature is available related with serpent in NorthEast India. Manasa (Serpent deity) Puja (worship) is an important festival of Assam which percolates every groups of the society. This paper is an attempt to study the position of serpent in Folklore of NorthEast India.\n\nIt can of course be said that the inception of folklore studies in India as well as in Assam is directly related to the advent of foreign personage. It is important to mention that the conscious and intentional effort directed to towards assimilation and synthesis of folklore materials took shape in the hands of foreign missionaries, British Govt. officials and their relatives, random travelers and amateur scholars of mainly anthropology and linguistics. In this respect I would like to lay emphasis on that colonialism is such a phenomenon, the advent of which not only gave birth to a new era of folklore studies but also had a remarkable influence upon its formation and development. Thus colonialism can be considered as a landmark in the periodization of folklore studies. Indian Independence in 1947 laid down the beginning of the second phase of folklore study of Assam covering a period from the middle of the 20 th century to the present. In this stage folklore study attained a dynamic character and a dimensional change was detected as analytical study took place besides collection and compilation. In this post colonial period many socio-cultural factors were responsible for the development of folklore studies of Assam. These factors will be discussed in detail in course of the study."
