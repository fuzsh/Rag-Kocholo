Unquestionably, the horrors of recent years perpetrated on the minorities by the 'majoritarian' upholders of 'true', rather than 'pseudo', secularism , have also dragged many secularist intellectuals out from their slumber and complacency. It is not surprising in the least to And that issues concerning the protection of the minority communities have come to dominate-and quite rightly so-die thinking of most recent writers. Also, in seeking and securing such safety and protection, the promotion and deployment of the resource of religious tolerance have been assigned a major complementary role. For Rajttv Bhargava, 44 the severity and persistence of such communal conflicts have effectively reduced the meaning of secularism to 'a strong defence of minority rights', which is to be reinforced by the religious resource of tolerance. He advocates a practical notion of 'political secularism', which malces 'the right' come before 'the good', and 'provides a way of living together', but not the optimal goal of living together 'well'. The latter goal is perhaps left to the long-term ideological objectives of what Bhargava calls 'ethical secularism'. Another major contribution belongs to Partha Chatterjee, 45 who is equally concerned with the 'challenge of Hindu majoritarianism' and calls into question the capacity of the current rhetorical secularism 'to meet' this threat. Like others, searching for a more practical and effective way of dealing with this serious threat, he suggests some pragmatic solutions within the framework of' a strategic politics of toleration' . Oipank.ar Gupta's 46 intervention is a realistic and bold exposure of the feebleness, debility, and infirmity of time-worn secular rhetoric, on the one hand, and the traditional notion of tolerance, on the other. His answer to the urgent need of the dangerous hour- brilliantly phrased 'secular intolerance'- would directly reach out to the hearts and minds of all wbo feel enraged and helpless at the endless and organized destruction of jobs, properties, and lives of children, women, and men belonging to the minority communities in a 'democratic' and 'secular' India. Gupta's is the most basic and sensible call-for the government to discharge its first responsibility to 'govern' under the first principle of the Constitution to uphold the Constitution and law and protect its citizens. It is our belief as well that no amount of debates and deliberations on the nuanced definition, nature, and form of secularism can obscure these basic 44\n\nRajeev Bh..-gan, 'What is secularilm forl', in Rajeev Bh..-gava (ed.), S.culori\"\" ood hs Ctiria (New Deihl: Oxford University Pre.a, 1998). \"P>nha Chatterjee, 'S.C:Ularimurul toleration' , Economicoml Po/Weal llWl1, 29:28 (1994), pp. 176S-77. \"liU contribution> in variOlll newspoper articles, cited in Madan, MOugava, 'Wh.at is~ forl'.\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nPERSPECTIVES\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nTHINKING OVER 'POPULAR ISLAM' IN SOUTH ASIA: SEARCH FOR A PARADIGM\n\nAsim Roy\n\nhe dawn of the new millennium saw a major sociological publication (not entirely original, rather an enlarged third reincarnation of it), focusing on the South Asian Mwlim communities, under the competent editorship ofT.N. Madan, 1 in which the editor speaks of a relative wealcness of sociological studies compared to the volume and quality of historical studies on the region. Madan expresses his regret that\n\nT\n\nWhile historians have for long regarded South Asia as an area of Immense If not unique interest from the Muslim point of view, and many approaches and schoob ofhistoriognpby llourish, high quality sociological studies of thtae MU11im communities arc rather rare. Some improvement in this regard has been, however, noticeable, in recent years. 2\n\nAt least some historians of South Asian Islam would have some understanding of the scriow problems encountered by their sociology counterparts in building up their strength in this area, becawe of two major rea.sons. One is, in Madan 's expressive words, 'the constrictive identification of Hindu society with India', treating communities other than the Hindw as minorities of relatively less scholarly interest. Besides, the avant garde of Indian sociology nude very little effort to address this problem no less because of the bia.ses of their theoretical positions, than because of the dearth of ethnographic studies of Mwlirn societies. l Within 1\n\nT.N.

Historians, hav:ing their own reasons to feel Wleasy with some of these generally received historical assumptions, cannot afford to be'as dismissive to these disciplines as often seems to be the inclination or some historians and lslamicists. The whole issue of the rel,a tionship between historical and sociological Wl· derstandings of the Islamic process in the context of South Asia has come to the fore again with the publication of a historical work in the same field almost concurrently with that of Madan. This refers to Francis Robinson's latest major publicatian in 2000.4 One of Robinson's chapters in this new publication, ' Islam and Muslim Society of South Asia', originally appeared in 1983, as students of South Asian Islam may recall, in Contributions to Indian Sodoloar, edited by no other than T.N, Madan. In this particular essay, Robinson's critique of the thesis of a distinguished sociologist, Imtiaz Ahmad, on South Asian Muslim societies sparked off a lively debate in the pages of Contributions in the 1980s, in which Gail Minault, a historian, and Veena Das, a sociologist, rallied in support of Ahmad. Among other major issues, the Ahmad-Robinson contentions almost came down to asserting the 'superiority' of one discipline over another. Robinson wrote: In the Introduction to volume three 1 [of his four-volume study of Islam in South A.!ia) Ahmad set out his credo. He asserted the :superiority of the sociological vision over that of the Wamicist. 'The sociological and social anthropological understanding of religion', we are told, 'is at once more comprehensive and more concrete.' 6\n\nFurther, Robinson senses in Ahmad 'a dismissiveness towards the achievements of other disciplines, as well as a jarring confidence in the superiority of the sociological vision'. 7 Paralleling Ahmad's claim for the sociological Wldcrstanding being more 'comprehensive', the historian warns the sociologist: 'Perhaps, the sociological Wlderstanding of religion. and religious change, is not as \"comprehensive\" as he, (the sociologist) would like to think,' and then goes on to affirm the historian's 'extended view'. 8 Such contestations for territoriality in disciplinary terms raise enormous problems for the ever-growing academic trends in multidisciplinary studies. Even within the old, generically deftned parameters of disciplines, th,e re have always been and will always be sociologically minded historians as there are historically 4\n\nFrancis Robin!On, /slam ond :'lu1lim Hino7 in Sourh ,1sia (New Delhi: Oxford University Pross, 2000) , 11mtia2 Ahinod (ed,).

THE PHEiNOMENA\n\nThe students and sundry observers of Islam in South Asia and even beyond have long been familiar with the inner divergences of the Muslim communities crystallized into two broad clusters and strands of Mu.slim beliefs and practices, most commonly perceived to represent the distinction between the universal attributes of the religion derived from its scriptural and textual sources (A:ltab). and its particuhr formulations cast in the mould of its local geo-cultural and 'Ibid., p. 48. 10\n\nMushirul Ha.san (ed.), /slam, Cammunilia and the /\\'orion: Mwlim /cknritits in South Asia and l> Aita: A s.,...1efCumnr lkuorch (Wi..baden: Franz Steinar Verlag, 1'975), pp. 6-8 . \"swnit Sarbr, Tht S....dahl Mornn', pp. 9l-3. \"Ibid .• p. 91. utbid., p. 111. 57 jean flllckooo, 'Wamlc inltltutions: Perception ;and practice in • village in &ngladesh' , ConrlliutioasrolaJiaa Sodol08f, 6 (n.1., 1972), p. 62. in Alunad, llhuals .nJ 11.IJgl•• A..m9 M..,)1-\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\n44\n\nLIVING T OG ET HER SEPARATELY\n\nshould do ... and all that is required is general local consensus as to what \"good Muilim5\" do.' 58 Social science research findings of this nature have unquestionably challenged the lslamicist's perception and understanding of the process of Islamiution in South Asia. It is unfortunate th.at the significance of these findings has not received much historical appreciation or recognition. Rather, questions have been raised, in some quarters among historians, about the specific social science affiliation ofthis recent literature, with its limited empirical disciplinary focus, and hence about its appropriateness in matters of historical concern. I have already broached this issue at the very beginning of this ch.apter, and quite emphatically expressed my discomfort with this largely unnecessary and totally unhelpful disciplinary wrangling between the social sciences and history in regard to the study of South Amn Islam, crystallized in the Ahmad-Robinson debate. 59 It may be noted here that, apart from Mushirul Haq ( 1979), mentioned above, we have on record at least two other Jamia Millia-based scholars, A.R. Momin (1977) and Mohammad Talib (I 979), who preceded Robinson in critiquing the sociological understanding of lslam, and upholding the Islamicist's position in the South Asian context. 60 Robinson has, undoubtedly, been the most powerful advocate oftlili position, having asked considerably more substantive questions for the opponents of the lslamicists to answer. ror an adequate understanding of the di.ll'ercnces between these two contrary viewpoints, it is necessary to take his arguments on board. Robinson's opposition centres on the sociologist's perception oflslam th.at tends to pEace, for him, exaggerated and misconceived emphasis on 'the gulf which exists between Islamic law and Muslim practice in India', as well as reject the lslamicist's explanations of the 'contradictions between law and local practice'. The Islamicist's basic explanation is focused on the historical development of Islamic society in term5 of long, slow, and gradual processes of Islamization eventually bringing about a heterodox-heteroprax to orthodox-orthoprax religious orientation. Sociologists refuse to accept this explanation, as 'synaetic and follc beliefs are still widely found in Indian Islamic practice'. This takes us to the hard core of these opposing viewpoints, as Robinson boldly underlines the difference: 'Ahmad rejected this understanding of a dynamic relationship between ideas and society through time in favour ofa concept of coexistence. For him the high Islamic 11\n\n1bld., p. 58. See Section I here for Ahmad- Rob·iruon debate.

Central to his undemanding and vision of Islam in history are his shibboleths: 'Islam offers a pattern of perfection for men to follow,' in Islamic history 'there has been a movement towards, or occa.sionally away from, the pattern of perfection', and 'what there cannot be, as Ahmad aswu, is a state of equilibrium.' 62 In a review of this particular book of Robinson, soon after its publication, Simon • Digby wrote: In a m&Dner which may be related to his own elitist academic envirorunent, Robinooo 's sympatbie~ are engaged with 'the emergence of Protestant or scriptural lsJani'61 .... Robinson's arguments may be.een as a valiant struggle on behalf ofa South A..ianMuslim elite with whom be has identified himself, mainly Swuli, replete withanexdu.M tradition of scholutic learning. ultimately COllCe> roed with the promotion of 'fundamentalist' religious belief and ritual observance ....

Yet, a few 'broad observations are called for. If, in the nature of this controversy, an agreement looks difficult to reach, we need to appreciate the depth of the essential polarity between these two perspectives. The contradiction and oonllict between the ideal and actml, or the norm and practice, are as old as the inception ofideology and morality. Total and exclusive adherence to any side of this equation cannot but yield wrong results. Scanning history in search of answers, in one way or another, may not bring this dispute to an end either, as history, mch as that in the eno·rmously rich and protean field of South Asian Islam, is replete with proofs of all kind.t which are quite amenable to suit particular conclusions, u is ablDldantly evident in the contentious literature on this debate. A good example of the conflicting nature of evidence impeding a convincing conclusion may help elucidate the point. 61\n\nRobi:noon, lllaat ODJ Mw/Jm Hlsrory, pp. 4 , +4-6.\n\n' 11bid., pp. 46, SO and 62.\n\n61Robimon '• own worda, -\n\nil>id.. p. 7.\n\n'\"Simon Digby, 'Anglo-American schoI.nhip on South Amil lslml', The &oi /krir,.., 25: 3 (March 2001), p. 29.\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\n46\n\nLIVING TOGETHER SEPARATELY\n\nRobinson has made a similar, though more documented, claim than Aziz Ahmad that the process oflslamization was ascendant, and popular Islam and syncretistic values bad been Wldergoing steady erosion in many parts of the Muslim world, especially South Asia, including Bengal, since the Islamic reform and revivalist movements in the early nineteenth century.65 About I 50 years later, after the creation of Pakistan, a field-study in ·p opular Muslim beliefs and practices, was undertaken in a district of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). It was oonducted under the supervision of A.K. Najmul Karim, later to become Professor and Head of the Sociology Department in the Dacca (now Dhaka) University,. and the district ofNoakhali was chosen for its reputation of being 'the most orthodox district of Bengal', where 'the influence of reforming priests has been most permtent' . 66 Robinson and Aziz Ahmad, along with the entire school oflslamicists, would be most unlikely to derive much satisfaction and hope out of the following revelation in the survey: t\n\nTbcrc are wmc rita obacrvcd by the M1111DN ... which have no doubt been originated &om the lslamlc sources. But even in such cases, tometimes Hindu beliefs and rituals are mixed up with the Islamic rites. On the other hand, a purely Hindu ritual at times would bear an Islamic facade.\"\n\nWhat do we make of our evidence--historical or sociological? Are we, then, left with the principle of individual truth inculcated in the parable of the four blind men's touching experiences of the elephant? Francis Robinson's approach to the history of Islam, largely shared in common with that of the lslamicisU, raises some questions. Students of Islamic history are given a splendid choice of tracing in history a significant religious vision of a total community life emanating from Arabia in the seventh century. How do we begin to read this history? Do we start off with a blueprint of this ideal conduct of life, look for the Muslim 'diasporas' across the .g lobe, stop and admire where we find them, and tum. our back on those who would not measure up, waiting for their redemption through a 'long and gradual' process of lslamization1 Robinson betrayed a curious seMe of history and historical 'inevitability', almost in the sense of a 'scriptural determinism', as he wrote: ' We should not be deceived by the fact that in many societies non-l'slamic practices had acquired the force oflaw in Muslim minds. Tiris is often a matter ofimperfect knowledge or ttraporary exptditnt, although temporary in this sense \"\"'l ft/I~ sevtrol hundred years.' 63 \"Robinson, /1/amand Mw/lm History, pp. 58-62. 66 A.K.N.

He urged, instead, a more meaningful approach to 'flnd' it in the life and world of its believers. 70 In his analysis of shortcomings of the social science approach, which he considered 'limited in understanding, place and time', Robinson emphasiz.ed the Importance of the 'written word' and 'study with the help of texts' beyond mere behaviour, that is 'how Muslims actually behave, and how this behaviour is at variance with preferred Islamic practice'. 71 Though it may not be entirely correct and fair to make an assumption about social science investigations being totally divorced from written material, or at least from a perspective based on such material, one of Robinson's major concerns here would have been to tum the focus on the importance of historical perception and understanding informing the outcome of such empirical research. In the following two sections, I have made some efforts to bridge this gap by seeking to reinforce such empirical data with material of historical import, not merely limited to our chosen region of South Asia but beyond it into South East Asia. V. NEW PERSPECTIVE AND PARADIGM: HISTORICAL: SOUTH ASIA It has surely been an unedifying spectacle for sociologists and historians of South Asian Islam to have locked horns with each other in a contest for disciplinary 'superiority', while both are given a common ground to explore the complexity, variety, and creative dynamism of the process of Islamization in this region. The sociological and social anthropological explorations in South Asian Islam virtually began since the publication of the special volume of Ccnuiburions ro Indian Sociol\"tlY (no. 6) in I 972, devoted exclusively to the 'Muslim communities of South Asia'. My postgraduate historical research in Islam in the region of undivided Bengal, beginning at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University, in the late I 960s, reached its completion at the Department of Oriental Civilizations, Australian National University, Canberra in I 970.

This academic effort may claim, as mentioned earlier, the distinction of perhaps being the first to apply this sociological model to a study of South Asian Islam.72 This is no covert attempt here, on my part, to reopen the history-sociology contest by creating a new front in terms of claiming chronological 'precedence' over and above the one of 'superiority'. fur me, the issue ends here and now, for the simple reason that 1 drew my inspiration largely from Robert Red.field's studies. 73 My sole purpose here is to draw clear attention to the fact that the research findings of at least some historians, as much as those of sociologists and social anthropologists of South Asian Islam have made them distinctly aware of the inadequacy of the conventional perception of a simple, exclusive, and monolithic great tradition as also that of a necessary contradi.ction and conflict between syncretistic developments and lslamization. OneofmyprimaryconremsinmydoctoralandsubsequentstudiesofMuslim Bengal has been the interrelationship between the great and little traditions of Islam in this region. It has been my contention that Islam, in this region, has not been a 'primary' buta 'secondary' culture, thatisexogenousandnotindigcnousto the region. Also, here in this region, Islam has not been a 'single' or the only 'great tradition' since it entered a land which was not culturally virgin, and confronted the long-established indigenous great tradition. Islamic conversion forced a break in the pre-conversion cultural continuity between the great and little traditions ofthe converts. To remedy the situation, a medieval group of Bengal Muslim literati, conceptualiz.ed as 'cultural mediators' in my study, constructed a rather rich alternative model of great tradition for the Bengal Muslim masses in the Bengali language and on a syncrctistic model. In the prooess they restored the broken continuity between the great and little traditions of the converts. 'Syncretism' is often seen by 'purists' as spurious--a perception that seemed to inform.the beliefs and attitudes in a l!arge section of higher classes of Muslims in South Asia, including Bengal, berating such developments as a jumble of 'folk' or 'popular' Islam. Writing in 195 I, Qazi Abdul Wadud, a supreme rationalist among Bengali Muslim writers and thinkers in ·this century, noted that the pre-nineteenth12See n. 45 here.

What Wadud saw as true about 'educated Muslims today' in Bengal, stretches back long in the history of the region and even beyond. I have adduced earlier considerable evidence of derogatory attitudes toward 'popular' and 'synaetistic' expressions of Islam in Bengal and elsewhere in South Asia. 71 Rafiuddin Ahmed's is a revealing case in example. He differentiates, like others, between an 'Islamic orthodoxy' and 'folk beliefs and practices', 76 but brings, like many of his lslamicist peers, a rather patronizing and supercilious attitude to bear on the whole question, writing: 'Until late in the nineteenth century the masses had hardly any idta about tbt •irtues·eftbtlr own religion; they had no way of knowing them'. n He used the word 'sacrilegious' for synaetistic beliefs and ideas, and daubed as 'un-lslamic' the creative attempt by a leading Bengali Muslim mediator-writer to present Prophet Muhammad alongside the Hindu divinities. 78 Apart from the fact of overlooking the mediatory concerns and roles of those authors of the syncretistic tradition, Ahmed revealed his unfamiliarity with similar attempts made by many reputed north Indian Sufis, who justified their actions on the ground of the Quranic revelation that Allah did send prophets to all peoples. My own studies in the Islamic syncretistic tradition precisely sought to bring out the religious concerns and purposes underlying the literary efforts of the Muslim cultural mediators. A detailed textual examination of Saiyad Sultan's Nabi-bamsha (The Lineage ofthe Prophet) clearly revealed to me his ingenious and creative adaptation and reformulation of Hindu mythology with the ultimate objective of proclaiming the finality of the Islamic prophetic mission. Based on the Quranic knowledge of the divine message being bestowed on other messengers before Prophet Muhammad, he used the Hindu tradition of successive 'avatars', especially the Krishna myth, to underscore the failure of those earlier missions, and thus set the stage for the final mission of Muhammad. It is more than ironical that Rafiuddin Ahmed questions the faith of this leading Muslim pir-poet on the ground that, in bis Nabi-bamsha, the name of Prophet Muhammad appears with 'the Hindu aralw and tr.msfonning divine power, or barabt ... these expanding network.. of devotion and cult won:hip are not to be seen as elemenu of• parochial, debased or unlettered 'folk Islam' . 10 1 The strong beliefs in the saint and shrine cults, divination, astrology, charm, and witchcraft among the pre-Mughal as well as Mughal rulers and elite in Bengal arc clearly evidenced by the interesting account of Mirza Nathan, a Mughal naval official under Governor Islam Khan (1608-13), and also by other sources. On his authority we know that his father lhtimam Khan, also a Mughal official, when ordered by Jahangir ( 1605- 27) to proceed to Bengal, made his preparations 'at an auspicious astrological hour', and that he kept under his employ a physician who was also 'very expert in the science of astrology'. 102 ~the imperial fleet under his command entered the river Karatoya, wrote Mirza Nathan:\n\nOn account of great tumult raised by the sailors, the sound of the victoriow trumpets and the artillery, the 6.sh of the river, jumping out of the water, began to fall on the bmts. This was taken to be a good omen for the conquest of Bbati, and suppression of the rebels. 103 Buzurg Ummed Khan, son ofShaista Khan, Governor of Bengal ( 1664-78) under Aurangzeb ( 1658-1707), started his march against the Firingis (Portuguese pirates) and the Maghs of Burma/ Arakan 'at a moment auspicious for malting a beginning' .IO. About Mir Qasim, the last post-Plassey Nawab of Bengal ( 1764-5), it was said that he: 'understood a little astrology and believed in its maxims and predictions; he procured the child's horoscope to be accurately drawn by able astrologers' .105 The belief in necromancy and charm permeated all sections ofsociety.

Integration may lead to the levelling of contained differences, minority rights to the fragmentation of the state into communities-a paradox that Khilani places at the root of the Nehruvian view of the nation as an abstract idea, above its substantial contents, whether in terms of regional or linguistic communities. 3 This well-known dialectics of national integration versus diversity, right &om the beginnings of independent India, reached a particularly acute polarization regarding the language question.\n\nI. EVENTS: A BLOODY HISTORY It may seem amazing that the language problem (finally a script-cum-numeral problem) came to be the major conflict among constituents between I 948 and I 9 50 and that only language debates compelled Nehru to call-twice-for a vote although he was determined to avoid a vote in order to preserve the consensual basis for demoaacy. 4 But if we see language not merely as a tool for communication, nor even as a way of enacting one's social role(s), but as a means of asserting one's cultural or religious identity and an icon for a group identity, one can unde.r stand how it can become an intensely burning issue. Still, for these tensions to become a bloody issue, a process of politicization is needed, and this is precisely what was already going on before Independence when Gandhi had to give up his dream of Hindustani (in both scripts) as a would-be national language, 5 Hindustani being religiously unmarked and quite loose regarding regional and cultural identity. The question of the national language, in fact, condensed the problems raised by the exploitation of language for expressing the political claims of a community, and later language claims and riots can only be explained by the political link, more or less a:rtiflcially created, between language and political or administrative needs. One of the most convincing examples of the politicization of the language 'problem' and of the tension between national integration/ security and maintenance of linguistic diversity is the question of the so-called 'linguistic states'.

Such a consciousness, widely absent in pre-modern India, gradually developed with the British efforts to map and survey the languages of the colony, providing a radically new representation of the relation of the speaker to his speech (one language, one name, one identity). II. REPRESENTATIONS: THE WEIGHT OF PHILOLOGISTS\n\nIN THIS BIRTH OF LANGUAGE CLAIMS The integrating political view oflanguage$ expressed in the Constitution of India, in fact was not neutral: it both countered and continued the philological tradition which dominated the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries linguistic studies in Europe and India.20 It continued the lndo-Aryan comparative studies by echoing the historical approach (language families) of language studies current at the time and by emphasizing the common origin of the great variety of modern lndo-Aryan languages, implicitly validating the genetic approach. This genetic view of language evolution and growth was started by the German school of Nee-grammarians in the early nineteenth century (Pott, Bopp, Lassen, etc.) who first gave scientific arguments to establish the first linguistic family dcscribed, Indo-European (at the time rather called as lndo-Gennanic). The discovery of a common source beyond the present variety of mutually unintelligible languages happened to be the fust modem attempt in the history of language science to explore linguistic evolution with rational 'laws' of change, rational according to the then Western standards. The birth of language 'science' in Europe with the Nee-grammarian and comparatist school, itself the first step in what was to become linguistics, is part of the more general history of sciences at the time; as such, It belongs to an eptstemologtcal trend viewing the natural sciences (with Cuvier in palaeontology and botanics, Darwin and his theory of determinism in natural species, Adler in Jleredity) and their methods as a model for studying any living entity, including language, a Tefonnubtcd by the Koth.ri Commission in 1966, tentatively implemented ,.; th complex adjustment> to local siru.tlons by the NCERT (N•tion.I Commission for Education, RC>CMCh and T..ching) and i.s still lgnottd by mwy schools.

Linguistic variety and change were accounted for by the laws of evolution, such as Wackcrnagel 's, Brugmann 's, Bartholomae's, and Caland's, in the same way as the classification of natural species resulted in the grouping of various families, and its diversification, too, was accounted for by the laws of evolution (like adaptation). The German school of scholars who argued for an lndo-Gcrmanic family was, as is well known, triggered off by William Jones's discovery in 1786.21 In his Third Discourse on the Hindus for the Asiatic Society, Jones unveiled the 'marvellous structure' of Sanskrit grammar along with its 'antiquity' superseding Latin and Greek, two ancient languages exhibiting striking grammatical affinities with Sanskrit.'' So Sanskrit was immediately recognized as the most ancient hence pure and perfect ancestor of European civilization, the Ursprache for all European languages derived from the unattested lndo-European which was to be reconstructed in the following years. Sanskrit was welcomed as the cradle of European civilization, dethroning Hebrew in the position of absolute origin. 21 The 'marvellous structure' mainly consisted in the flexional structure of the language (casual morphology and highly synthetic verb forms), a marvel further emphasized by philosophers as the very sign of intellectual perfection and fitness for expressing abstract ideas. As early as 1808 in his Essay on tlit Languas• a.nd tlit Wisdom efHindus, Friedrich Schlegel made the flexion a matrix figure in his argument for lndo-Germanic linguistic and cultural perfection. 24 It exhibits, he said, both 'natural simplicity' and a 'power of germination' since it is endowed with an inner strength allowing the word to transform from the inside and behave as a living germ. Such languages were presented as an evidence of the cultural capacity of the lndo-Germanic race, the only one 'naturally gifted for the expression of high spirituality'. They contrasted with agglutinative (aggregative) languages 'naturally rude and imperfect' with their sterile and burdening endless aggregate of suffixes or prefixes, 'particles', sounding like rocks, unpleasant to the ear and hard for the mind to connect.21 Isolating languages (like Chinese) were even lower in the 11 A discovery which h.d howevCt the 1ttention of iu few re.ders in the board of the Ac.demy, was k.cpt unnoticed, md v.·u not given my circul~tion. 11 WiUiam Jones, 'On the Hindu: The third di.counc', Asio, altbough it would not lack hinorical argumenu). 15Kanahbbai Pillai, Tht Tomiliaru E.isht«n Yean Before (1904). \"Jones's argumcnu for choosing Sanskrit over utin and Greek as the origin langu•ge were exactly the wne. 17See today the n:currmce of this competition in the struggle (linguistically evidenced) for the legacy ofthe Hanppancultutt.

Such a contrastive construction means that the impUcit superiority of Sanskrit conveyed in the designing of the lndo-Aryan family and drawing ofits borders is perceived by the other as a kind of rejection to the subaltern world of inferior languages. Even in sound scholarly Ungui.stic research like Caldwell's masterpiece, 39 much more sober in its ideological implications than Pillai, the posited consistency of the group as both distinct (original) and ancient (true end.le of Indian civilization) sounds a clearly vindictive note against Sanskrit and lndo-Aryan, although there is no racial mythology involved. The philologist agenda in India is clearly different from that in Europe, but in both cases there is room for the competition with the other, framed by the methodological pattern: genetic Unguistics aiming to form famiUes and sub-families creates outsiders to the family. This initial Unguistic consciousness on the part of descriptors, informed by Western science (patterned after natural sciences), was significantly contemporary with the requirement of census to identify one's language, hence perceive it as distinct from the neighbouring languages and as one homogeneous entity which could be named. The Dravidian family of languages was, a century later, integrated by the Corutitucnts, not as a family of its own (a distinct group eventually conllict:ing with the other group or groups) but as a number of major languages at the same level as Jndo-Aryan languages. Interestingly, neither the Austric family, although identified as such by Smith in the first years of the century, nor the Tibeto-Burman family got any recognition, in spite of Jaypal Singh 's motion in the Constituent Assembly for including such tribal languages as Santali (today with twice the number of speakers than Sindhi). Ho, Kurukh, a motion rejected with hardly any discussion. We may ponder on what were Nehru's intentions in scaling down the linguistic diversity to a few major languages supposedly very similar. The refusal to let family groups prevail with their genetic delimltation was certainly consistent with his 'idea of lndia' 40 as an abstract global idea rather than a concrete aggregate of well-defined linguistic, regional, and cultural entities,41 as \"Argwnentstion vehemently opposed by Swaminath.

However, the contradictory notion of quotas (for positive discrimination) for certain groups resulted in the well-known situation where regional, cultural, gender, linguistic identities more and more came to substitute group claims and lobbying to a political creed in democracy. Besides, the listing of a few 'major' languages, later on widely criticized,42 inevitably opened up a dynamics of competition for entering the magical schedule and benefiting from its advantages (education, publishing, media, etc.). At the same time, the definition of the official language43 and the linguistic provisions in the Constitution seemed to go against the very notion of grouping languages by 'blood links' with organic roots, and yet the very wisb of identifying 1eparate languages and malcing this identification the condition of recognition or non-recognition was deeply indebted to the previous hundred or so years of historical linguistics. It Is the tradition of historical linguistics in India that made possibk language clamlication and linguistic·cartography, where boundaries were mainly drawn according to the genetic (vertical) criteria of linguistic affiliation. To de.cribe a language was essentially to assert its genetic affinity in order to put it in the appropriate category (refer to the discourse on Khandeshi or Bhili changing classification). The huge survey of Grierson at the beginning of the century\n\n(and the numerous monographs which followed on till the mid·twentieth century), without which the language census would not have been possible, are contemporaneous--the first census dates from 1837. Both enterprises resulted in the requirement for each individual to name his language as a clearly distinct entity (necessarily different from another or other entities) and to choose one language a.• his mother tongue~though every census officer has met with people not knowing which their 'real' language is (a situation still current). In Ganjarn district in Orissa, for example, an oft-cited case in Indian sociolinguistics, speakers are unable to say whether they speak Oriya or Telugu, although the IndoAryan and Dravidian families are supposed to radically differ from each other. As Paul Brass !tates, 'The language censuses in north India are political, not philological, documents,' 44 but it should be borne in mind that philological documents too are far from language reality in usage and consciousness. Linguistic consciousness then seemed to have stemmed from the classificatory passion of the colonial agenda, at least a certain type of linguistic consciousness with clear-cut boundaries juxtaposing same and other, grounded on rigid structural mop of India when tfKropposed a Unguistic sU!• reorganization, for fear of 'ballunization', was not to prov.W in the end as i> well l:nown (..., ~ poges). 41 Gupta et al., Languagt onJ the S...U. • 41 0.liberau:ly not national languag•.

Only when the diversity that comprises the totality is reflected in the universal can different communities have a sense of identity and equality within the polity. Third, the ideal of nondiscrimination places obligations on the state. It calls upon the state to aclcnowlcdge and accommodate diverse cultural communities as equal partners and at the same time it is required to sec that cultural and community norms do not become the buis of subordinating vulnerable individuals and groups. The responsibility for promoting equal treatment lies with the state; at least the state cannot abandon it in the name of promoting and protecting diversity. The pursuit of diversity bas therefore to be linlccd to the principle of non-discrimination. Deliberations upon the nature of democratic citizenship have also to be placed within these parameters. The notion of non-discrimination alone can provide a framework for deliberating upon the claims of diverse groups and communities as well as for constructing a collective identity that can be the basis of imagining a political community.\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nPROCESSES\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\n3:: ~\n\n....~\n\n,-\"•.. -.. ll\n\nJi\n\n...-,\n\n:!\n\n..\n\nh\n\n01g1t1\" d by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nA 'HOLi RIOT' OF\n\n1714:\n\nVERSIONS FROM\n\nAHMEDABAD AND DELHI*\n\nNajef Haider\n\nT\n\nhis chapter examines a set of evidence on an event in Ahmedabad in\n\n1714.

A downturn in the hinterland, rilling transaction costs due to fear, uncertainty, and lack of safety for goods and money in transit, and Maratha expeditionary raids which began in AD 1703 and reached their high point in the second quarter of the eighteenth century, boded UJ for the vigorous conduct of business. 22 Stiff competition for the shrunken markets and concern for a greater stake in the city affairs may have lowered the threshold of tolerance that existed between communities with complementary interests. The principal organizer of violence, Abdul Aziz, waa the leader of a subgroup of Ahmedabad's mercantile population, the Sunni Bohras, who WCJ'C junior partners of the Banias in the trading network of Gujarat. They descended from that section of the mercantile population of Gujarat (probably of the Vohra caste) which converted to lsmailism in the deventh century and later split to form the Swmi sect in the fifteenth century. B Rest of the Vohras remained Jains and Hindus. The merchant prince of Surat in the seventeenth century, Virji Vora, was a Jain and his counterpart (IUJldm ut iujjar) in the eighteenth century, Mulla Abdul Ghafur, was a Sunni Bohra. The Sunni Bohras were in a majority and were wealthier and more powerful than the lsmailis. H They had their shops, offices, and correspondents In Ahmedabad, and Surat as well as the imperial camp at Delhi. In all these places, they had Banias as their competitors. How much the crish of the early eightttnth century was responsible for turning the seth of the Sunni Bohras and Kapur Jauhari, his Bania counterpart, into organizers of violence can only be speculated. The Ahmedabad version indeed imputes motives of professional rivalry, which probably also included claims oYer the coveted post of the nagarseth, when it clubs the two principal actors together in the run-up to the riot.25 21Georgea Roques, Lo ...,,;.,. de ..,,..in JatJs La JM.s OrlaJUJl/a J..Jict o mu Chm omu Er c;,,,,jrau la Engoga Je lo llcJolle Cmapogn)T de fnmc< , Btbliotheque Nationale, MS l'onds Francois 1461•, ff. 239-40; AJhin o..

Among them, the Afghans receive attention in the Delhi version as soldiers of Daud Khan. They came from the suburbs of Ahmedabad, across the river Sabannati, where there was a large and 'ancient' settlement of the Afghan community. 26 Although praised for defiance of authority, it is doubtful whether they were in regular employment of the provincial administration or in the personal service of the Afghan Governor. They were unavailable for the Governor's campaign and the man, although not a very good administrator, was known for exerci!ing strict control over his troops (la.shlror!fan) during expeditions. 27 Chances are that the group was once in the personal contingent of some warrior noble and that at the time of the riot, was probably out of employment. 28 Chris Bayly bas offered a sociological explanation for the general involvement of the Afghans in conflicts: their 'undiaciplined' and 'mercenary' character and their isolation 'in an urban environment', providing the 'impetus for communal violence in the early stages of state building' . 29 However, more findings on the exa.ct nature of their professional status, command rtructure, and religiow persuasions are needed before their motives can become fully explicable. 30 No such doubts could be ent ertained about the motives of the Gujarati musketeers who were Muslims but threw in their lot with the Banias and practically saved the Jauhari-wara from being overrun by the attackers. They were mercenaries and airrently out ofjob. Ali Muhammad Khan rues the fact that they became embroiled for purely mundane reasons, either immediate gains or future employment. They were paid by Kapur Chand (their wages were fixed in advance) and they also knew that he was close to the administration and that appealing to his good offices was worth the fight against the defenders of the 'true faith'. 31 16\n\nAli Muhammad Kb.an, Mlto,.I Ah-di, Supp/....,,,, p. 17: vol.

The matter is further complicated by the suggestion that a sharp and self-coNdous Hindu (and Muslim) identity was created in pre-colonial India out of rivalry and violent conflicts between Hindus and Muslims. 40 The Alunedabad riot of 1714 is the only incident of Its kind in the recorded history of the city from AD 1411 to 1761. It was confined to a particular locality during the course of the rioting and invited participation from groups drawn from three religious communities. Commercial rivalry appears to have lain at the heart of the confllet and signs of It were manifest also In subordinate cases of dispute cutting aaoss religious lines. The presence of other Muslim groups in the mob indicates that the Bania community, the butt of their attack, was viewed with an obscure sense of mistrust or fear. Cow slaughter and Holi celebrations were two contentious issues which heightened hidden pressures and provided the pretext for open provocations. Even in the midst of volatile situations, communities were not divided completely on religious lines and individuals or groups are found to have talcen narrower views of their membership while expressing support for or opposition to a particular act or policy. Finally, except for the lapse on the part of the local administration to maintain order at the outset of the violence, the Mugbal state apparatus appears to have been effective in containing and adjudicating the dispute in the province and the metropolis.\n\nthe tteent Gujarat riots...,..., an unuiual phenomenon, proclaimed that riou bne taken place in ha oorutituency •...,,. nnce I 713 (lie.)'.

Women of Hindu and Mwlim castes sing songs devoted to kuldevis and satis, piirs and, pitriinis (male and female ancestors) and jhisnjhars (prematurely~ ancestors).37 Women's geruu such as the jhilai dedicated to the five pin, swig among most communities imrnediatdy after the birth of a child, also memorialize this mythic space. The singing of this genre brings on a possession trance, as a deceased ancestor is embodied in a living being. Several ethnographers refer to the common cosmologies in rural Ajmer comprising beliefs shared by both Muslim and Hindu castes. This magical world is populated by tbe chur.l or ghort of• young woman who bas died in childbirth; bhiir-pma or prematurely dead spirits who have not been transformed into ancestors through funerary ritual and who inhabit a threshold existence in and out of the world; boliis, wandering spirits embodied through possession; and deified anceatral spirits worshipped as household deities called paw (pitr) or jhilnjhir. 38 The spirits of the recently dead, also called dnatii or piubaj, often take posscuion of a descendant, causing the body to lhudder and gasp. Painted Jhimjbiitfn can be found in the fields of Muslim castes such as the Mcrat and Hindu castes. In this world view, death and life are not distinctly demarcated, as the anceatral dead are responsible for the fertility of both the fields and the family. 39 Warrior, peasant, pastoral, artitanal, and specialist groups that comprise both Hindu and Muslim branches and others have common deities and shared traditioos. 40 These include castes such as tailors, washer-persons, barbers, potters, genealogists, leather tanners, liquor brewers, and cloth printers. \"Seoni Pllgri= (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1989 (1988)), pp. ~; Lindsey Hulan, Tb.

But the common-wue world is from the outset a sociocultural world, and the many questions oonoected with the intcrsubjeclivity ofthe symbolic rdaliom · originate within it, are determined by it, and Snd their solution within it. 41\n\nEthnic inter-subjectivity can be witnessed on numerous axes in Ajmer. The Sindhi-Muslim interface derives from the activity centred on the shrine. Sindhi traders dominate the Dargah Bazar and benefit considerably from the annual Urs turnover of something like Rs 80-100 million. Their post-Independence economic prosperity is, hence, dependent on the continuous flow of pilgrims. The market plays a major role in the quick settlement of disputes but the Sindhi- Muslim relationship is more complex than that. There is among Sindhis a profound belief in the dargah. Despite their affiliation with right-wing parties, several shopkeepers begin their day by first placing the keys to their shop at the feet of the tomb. Inter-subjectivity derives from the spatial organization of the city. Sindhi homes and business are concentrated in the Dargah and Nalla Bazar areas adjacent to Andcrkot, the Muslim area. Similarly, the Dallt neighbourhoods (of the Bhangi or sweeper and Mochi or leather-worker castes) adjoin the Muslim areas. Sometimes Sindhi and Muslim houses meet roof-to-roof. Muslims remark on the marked absence of ideas of purity-pollution among Sindhis as a result of which there is considerable social contact between Sindhis and Muslims in the residential neighbourhoods. Muslims make their purchases and take credit from Sindhis. As the writer Nagaraj puts it, it is the 'unheroic quality of everyday life' that sustains pluralism. 42 Kinship terminology used in urban neighbourhoods indicates everyday relations forged between individuals that arc carried over from rural contexts. Helen Lambert points out how kin terms are used to refer to village co-residents Cited in Erving Goffman, F1011H AaolJsh: An Essay on the Organization of Ezpcricnec (Hannoadsworth: Penguin. 1974), p. 4. \"D.R.

Theae localitybased social identities and forms of relatedness run oounter to conventional anthropological views of kinship as restricted to persons related either oonsanguineous or affinal.4 3 'Fictive lcinsbip', is the anthropologists' very limited term for relationships that denote oomplex ties of affect. ~we left the residence of a doctor who belongs to the major Ellis-David ChrUtian clan of Ajmer, a Hindu girl arrived with her children to ask after the health of llCJlli (mother's mother) Dr Constance David. Laxman Singh, the Rajput lawyer of&-ar, has a 'sister' called Badami who is a (Muslim) Merat woman. When her young son died leaving a grandchild, Laxman Singh usumed responsibility for his rearing. Ritual and religious life brings people together for moments of celebration and particularly in mourning connected with cultural ideas that both joy and sorrow can be and ought to be shared. In city and village I noticed how women from different castes would come together for the ratijaga or night wake held on the two specific occasions connected with death and life. Devita or deity songs are sung through the night to the drumbeat of the Dboli drummer. During one such occasion, the participants included women of various Hindu castes and a Merat (Muslim) woman with her two giggling daughters and daughter-in-law. While the ritijagi songs were sung they lit a lamp (diJO} and offered food to the pitr or ancestor. The night-long ritual saw some women busy with worship, while others applied henna t.o ead1 other's b.nds and shared a bil of gossip. Needless t.o\n\nsay, this rite derives fromnon-Brahmanical traditions and oommemorates women's autonomous ritual space where the upper caste male priest or Brahmin can be dispensed with. Men from different castes collect on the occasion of a death rite called mawar. This is believed to ensure transcendence for the ancestral spirit. Often seen as a feast after death, it is also a rite of succession. It confers recognition on the lineage heir by different castes symbolized by the application on his forehead of the r.iia or vermilion mark and the tying of the turban (pOg). The rite reproduces patrilineal political structures that receive a colllCDSllal legitimation from members of other patrilineages.\n\nThe Communitarian Mana9ement efD!IJuence The question of Hindu-Muslim conflict has often been addressed by counterpo.;ng it with ideas of 'commuoal harmony', which to my mind, are quite illusory. The question with respect to a multicultural centre such as Ajmer is how people live with and manage difference? What are the institutional mcchani.mis that help resolve oonflict and contain it within manageable levels? 41\n\nHelen Umbert, 'Loality, ilfection md bodily oomtitutioo in IUjosd\"'1l kinship', unpubWhcd P'P\"' pre.sented to Third lnternationol Semlnu on Raj..UW., j.ipur, l+-18 Dec. 1994.\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nLIVING TOGETHER\n\n161\n\nSectarian competition in Ajmer was institutionalized through dialogue and other mechanisms. Dayanand, founder of the Arya Samaj, spent considerable time in Rajputana. His exchange with Christians and Jains was mediated by the long-standing Indian tradition of iastrrmh or intellectual debate. In the fifteen days that he spent in Beawar he had continuous dialogue with Reverend Scholbread and undertook Ustrarth with Jains at Masuda. There is extensive evidence of the verbalization of confllct between Christian missionaries and the Arya Samajists so that it docs not degenerate into physical violence. One such story describes the encounter of a priest and pandit. To the former's suggestion that the wooden Cl'OS$ and stone Slra lingo be both placed in water to see which floated (and was therefore superior), the latter retorted, let us now place thetn in 6re to see which one bums! Despite the fact that the Arya Samaj press was bringing out considerable polemical anti-Mualim literature, leaders of the Arya Samaj such as Pandit Jialal persooally regulated religious prooetsions so that there would be no violence: During the last three decades, several major cities of India and Rajasthan have witnessed the play of communal politics and violence. Ajmer is a noticeable exception. Curfew was declared in the city for a brief period in 1991 over a minor incident involved with the adminiJtrativc agenda of cleaning up the Dargah Bu.ar. Muslim cart-owners expressed their resentment by pelting the pollceadminisu111ion with stories (a Muslim Saliorl HOUie Offioer or SHO was alao wgeted). The oonf1ict that was essentially between some Musllrna and the administration witnessed a minor attempt at communalization wben the grain market was set fire to reportedly by some Hindus in an attempt to put the blame on Muslbm. 44 Administrative sources maintain that curfew was declared in view of the 'communal tension' and as a preventive measure following the dedaration of curfew in Delhi, jodhpur, Jaipur, and other cities. Both Sindhi and Mualim leaders,~. maintain that there was no cause for declaring curfew as there was no HinduMuslim conflict and jointly protested that a 'communal riot' was non-existent. One might underllne that there are available, in any given situation, different and competing readings of a 'communal riot' . In this case, the contrast between the statist reading of tension and the communitarian perspectives is evident. Further, this renders the 'communal riot' a patterned structure of meaning that the administration can impose onto a given situation. It often might have to do with what is taking place in the larger world rather than the locolly\n\navailable situation so that difference, which is under control and being contained and managed, is instead read as symptomatic of communal teruion.

The shrines usually called thins are referred to as chouiis when the custodianpriest goes into a trance. The uroi or Bhopa/Bhopi demonstrates his/her calllng by embodying the deity/saint. In most :spirit exorcism shrines, the peshi or presence of the embodied divine establishes contact with the jinn or bhut. Its identity revealed, a bujh or dialogue talces place with it. The forms of spirit possession at a 'Musllm' and 'Hindu' shrine are strikingly similar, blurring the distinction between popular Hinduism and popular Islam. There is obviously considerable mutual borrowing among th.e shrines. Taussig has presented an effective anti-structural analysis to shamanism demonstrating how possession rites worked as resistance to colonialism; Kapferer identifies ritual as resistance to the order of caste.51 I have argued elsewhere that it disrupts the totallstic ethnic categories. Kapferer describes a ceremony that took place to heal the wounds caused by conllict between Sinhala and Tamil ethnic groups when three Tamil and Sinhala women danced entranced at the Pattini shrine. 52 This does not mean that shamanism is a space that is immune to communal conllict. Indeed Kapferer's woric has brought out how the participants of exorcism rites become participants in ethnic strife. Nonetheless, shamanistic ritual globally tends to comprise a more l!iclusionary space suggested by the eclectic borrowing in its vocabulary, ritual, and symbollsm. It is important to underline that shamanism relates to a bi(ifnot multi)-religious universe. 53 The conceptual and symbollc universe of medical pluralism reveals a dynamic field of cultural encounter. Suffering and its alleviation forge relationships that are across community. The shrine is a saaed space that fosters new social networks. We witnessed this in Ajmer city with respect to several halcims who practise the Islamic Yunani (Greek) system of medicine; a Dalit (Meghwal) wrestler who mends bones; and a Clvistian priest widely loved and acclaimed for his therapeutic capabilities. Medical pluralism, as I have argued elsewhere, has operated in the Indian subcontinent as one of the strongest sources of inter-ethnic bonding. It also provides villagers with lowcost and effective psychiatric resort. It is., however, dismissed by the Western medical system and its practitioners as symptomatic of superstition! 51 Mld>ael Tauaalg,\n\nSh.,,....IRD, Coloaiolum am/ the Wild Mon: A Studf In Tarot anJ Healing (Chicago: l.l.nl•ers!ty of Chicago Praa, 1987). n11rw::e Kapferer, A c.Jtlwodon ef Dcmoru: &om.a anJ ''\" Aath«Ja efHeolmg la Sri LoUa (Chiago and London: Uni-aty of Chicago Preu, 1991 [1983D, p. xv. n0onn V.

' Hyphenated identities designate bridge communities, literally and metaphorically. They can provide a potential wne ofresistance to 'fundamentalist' and reformist ideologies. One of the factors responsible for the close Sindhi-Mwllm interface in Ajmer is the Uminal identity of the Sindhis that lies at the intersection of Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. Most Sindhis are Nanak Panthis or followers of Su6.s like Lal Shahi\"IZ Qalandhar and Shah Latif. They follow the Mwllm calendar and resemble Mwlinu in their language and dress. Not surprbingly, there is a large Sindhi presence in the Middle East.\n\nThe Existence of Networi. ldeniities57 The foregoing description should not lend the Impression that 'tradition' is plura!Ut and modernity b exclusivUt or that this ban anti-modernist argument. Indeed, what begs Investigation is how modernity offers an architecture with new sites for the interaction between ethnic groups. Scholars such as Tarnbiah have argued that democracy enhances ethnic conflict. 58 It does and does not.

The Mu.door Kisan Shakti Sangathan, a radical organization of peasantry and landless labour in rural Bcawar has both Merat and Rawat member-activists. It has been spearheading a nationally significant movement on the right to information that demands transparency in governance and empowers the poor. State programmes introduced in partnership with the women's movement such as the Women's Development Programme (WOP) have created rural women 'change a-gents' called sathins and women's collectives al.I over the state that work with women across ethnic lines. A people's hearing organized by women ll'ctivists in May 1999 highlighted the problems of both Hindu and Muslim women representatives in the panchayat system. Modernity has brought a new political economy of spirituality. It has meant the development of a large sector of activities associated with both the Pushlcar and Ajmer shrines.\n\nlate· twentieth-century Ajmer Im become a major centre for drug3 and arms sm111ggling. Instead of the mono-ethnic impression that we have of crime, I would argue that modern criminal activity tends to be multi-ethnic involving individuals in new networks that cut across community. Talce, for instance, the pornography scandal of 1992 that caused a good deal of tension. Approximately 100 girls from well-to-do Jain and Sindhi families are said to have been involved with a gang supplying girls to farmhouses for high-level officials and politicians from Jaipur. Many of them were filmed on pornographic vid~ made for widespread circulation. Some eight khadims' sons were named in the initial report filed with the police. There is obviously a lot of money coming into the dargah with some khadims having monthly incomes up to Rs 500,000 that has transformed both lifestyle and values, particularly for the younger generation. What the pornography scandal suggested was the existence of networks of friendship and alliance between young persons from khadim families and non· Mu.slims. Angela McRobbie points out the importance of different, youthful subjectivities. 19 In Ajmer, the activities were initiated by a Sindhi, owner of Bharosa Lab, a major photo-video business. He employs a dlozen or so photographer employees who make video films. Some of them took photographs of three-four girls at a wedding who happily posed for them. The gang traced the colleges of the girls and they were lured into relationships by a combination of desire and blackmail and supplied to clients at poultry farms, most of them owned by khadim families. 60 Some of the girl5 died in 5U8picioua cirCWIUtallccs, \"Angda McRobble, 'OilTuent, youthful subj«tivitiea\", in TIK Post-J.pers.\n\nDigitized by\n\nGoogle\n\nOriginal from\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nLIVING TOGETHER\n\n169\n\nsome have committed suicide, and others have refused to give evidence because of constraints of familial honour! The caae is being heard in camao in the District Sessions Court. 61 The non-cognition of sources of ethnic coexistence by the state and nonstate institutions, partirularly the agencies of coercive power, leads to irreparable damage. Police intelligence aocounta of forty-six caaes of alleged 'icon breaking' in rural Ajmer assumed the culpability of the Merat Muslims. Thia fed into press reports and everyday conversation, arousing ethnic tensions and bitterness. Our investigation found that contrary to the assumed Mwlim identity of the rulprits, the 'icons' vandalized were the ancestral deities of the Merat. Indeed, they were the cwtodians of several shrines and temples. Was it more than coincidence that most caaes of icon breaking occurred in the villages where Hindu nationalist organizations had a strong hue?62 Cities intimate the complex interaction of cosmologies and are subject to processes to change and the constant drawing and redrawing of boundaries. Interventions of classical textual frameworks seek to regulate the patterning of everyday cultural encounter. Colonial and contemporary politics and reformist agendu have over a century come to regulate the realm of categorical identities. Despite the extensive evidence of sectarian contention during this period, there ha.s also been something strange and inexplicable going on at the interface of the cultural encounter. Thia is a phenomenon that the historical record hardly cognlzes and sociological theory is hard put to explain. Western philosophy and disciplinary traditions, in any case, prioritize binarism given their emphuis on monadic sellhood, incommensurable identities, and boundaries around cultural isolates. But human agency subverts boundaries at the most unexpected sites: say the realm of desire as in the passion of a Sindhi girl for a Mwlim painter; Colonel Dixon's marriage with Bibi, a Merat Mwlim woman; Gibson's willing of his property to his gardener; 63 in the friendship and close professional relationship that grew between Halcim Nizarnuddin and the Vaidya Ramchandra \"More recently a blaclcmail cue wu registered by a Sindhi girl imol-t with oome boyl of the men:bant cute, in which police were alao attempting to extort money.

Lawrence caHs It 'an elitist battle' that , after the Mutiny of 1857, came to be fought by Hindus and British as a common, if not coordinated, front against the Muslims. 15 The preoccupation of the 'British imperial school' with India's military history had a lasting impact on the minds of the British as well as the Indian people. The thesis that Salar Masudhad not only reached Bahraich, but aI.eo Ayodhya and Varanasi16 has become a political issue in present-day India.
