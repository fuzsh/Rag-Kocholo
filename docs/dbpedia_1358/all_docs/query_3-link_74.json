        "text": "Lalit Gupta\n\nThe unrest in the Kashmir Valley has caused a considerable decline among other things, of the practice, performance/ exhibition of art and culture expressions in public spaces. While the Jammu region, especially the winter capital boasted of a busy calendar with its usual pre and post-Darbar move flurry of ‘cultural functions’ by different agencies of the state led by J&K cultural Academy and the state-funded NGOs working ostensibly for promotions and development of art and culture.\n\nNonetheless, it was either Sarkari or the popular versions of culture spurned of by institutions and a few NGOs, many of which try to ape the practices followed in leading metros of the nation. In such a scenario of hackneyed and trite cultural expressions, the credit for innovative expressions once again rested with a few select creative individuals who fired by the calling of the heart, imaginative and creative power, dedication and hard work, succeeded in making a mark.\n\nBefore mentioning the achievers of this year let us remember those who bid goodbye to this mortal world. These include Rita Jatinder, an accomplished Radio, stage actor, Hindi writer poet, and Sham sunder Anand Lehar, the prominent Urdu writer who was also a senior lawyer. Prof. Hamidi Kashmiri, noted Urdu/Kashmiri writer and former vice chancellor of J&K University also passed away.\n\nAwards and Honours: This years Sahitya Akademi Awards were conffered upon Inderjit Kesar, a prolific Dogri writer for his Dogri novel Bhagirath while Mushtaq Ahmad Mushtaq (Tantray) for the his book Aakh (A Scar) in Kashmiri.

The aesthetically designed posters, brochures, series of advertisements, calling upon enthusiasts to enjoy heritage, spiritual, adventure, floral, faunal and environmental experiences around Duggar’s twin lakes through Sunday series, adventure camps, tracks to historical monuments like Babor temples and Mohar Garh.

Padamshree Jatinder Udhampuri also contributed with his 3rd book of Urdu poetry ‘Kehkashaan’. The JU Dept. of Urdu through its academic initiatives, literary programs, seminars, poetic meets, etc. is contributing significantly to the promotion and development of Urdu in Jammu.\n\nVisual Arts: Thanks to the initiative of Arvind Kotwal, JMC’s former Commissioner, the otherwise non-descript undersides of the flyover on both sides of the Kala Kendra stand aesthetically transformed with large paintings based on motifs drawn from Pahari miniatures, and symbols of Jammu’s pluralistic culture and heritage. Hope the JMC’s mayor and the team of carporators continue the initiative which has already started finding an echo in beautifully embellished walls of Jammu’s private schools and other public spaces.\n\nComing to the creative practice of Visual Arts, which has given a new identity to cities like Kochi, Goa, just to name a few, the scene in J&K continues to be grim. One reason could be the changed priorities of the J&K Cultural Academy, which otherwise has been the main engine for initiating and sustaining the modern art movement in J&K through its Institutes of Music & Fine arts at Jammu/Srinagar and holding artist camps and exhibitions. The Academy’s atrophy can be gauged from the fact that it failed to hold its coveted annual art exhibition at Jammu this year. Much to the chagrin of veteran artist like Triloke Kaul, who along with others had laid the foundation of modern art renaissance in the late 1940s in J&K.\n\nNonetheless, the individual artists continued to create, exhibit their works and win accolades albeit outside the state. Some of the well-known local artists who hogged limelight were Nikhil Chopra, Veer ji Munshi, Rajinder Tikku, Suman Gupta. Others who remained active include Ravinder Singh Jamwal, Harsh Vardhan, Bishamber Mehta, Vikas Dogra, Chander Prakash, Sonu Agarwal, Sukhjit Singh Kukkal, Jasleen Singh, Amit Salathia, Rohit Verma, Milan Sharma, K.K. Gandhi, and Jang Varman.\n\nOther notable events were Sand Sculpture at Tawi banks by Suresh Sharma & others and dedicated to late sculptor Gobind Kaur, National level Print Making Workshop at IMFA Campus, Poonch House, IMFA’s art exhibition & music program at JU, All India Art Exhibition by ‘Unknown 4’ group, Amarjeet Singh (Photography), Malti Sharma (Painting) got Junior fellowship by Ministry of Culture for 2017- 18.\n\nCartoonist Manoj Chopra & Chander Shekhar Bunti won honors in national cartoon exhibition cum competitions. The NGOs Viraj Kala Kendra, Kesar Art circle and, JK Creative Centre for Arts contributed by holding art exhibitions, art camps etc.\n\nTheatre: J&K Cultural Academy has certainly given a spurt to theatre art by encouraging amateur theatre enthusiasts. Nonetheless, the NGO groups in Jammu led by dedicated theatrists have been significantly contributing towards theatre movement.\n\nNATRANG: held more than 100 shows in the year and set a record by organizing 8 theatre festivals in which 32 different plays by the same group were staged. Its regular mega events/shows at different melas were ‘Bava Jitto’ & Mata ki Kahani. It also screened first ever film on Maharaja Gulab Singh. Its participations in national theatre festivals were ‘In Her Shoes’, ‘Ghumayee’, ‘Romeo Juliet’, ‘Aap Hamare Hain Kaun’, Natrang actor Shazia Batool has been selected by National School of Drama to undergo Post-graduation in Dramatics.\n\nAmateur Theatre Group: With Mushtaq Kak as its mentor, the ATG emerged as an ambassador of J&K theatre by staging number of performances of plays like Ishaq Malngi in important national festivals. Young actors trained by ATG have been started making a mark as independent directors/ actors. ATG is going to hold a festival of plays in memory of Kavi Rattan, founder of modern theatre movement.\n\nRangyug: Under the stewardship of Deepak Kumar, held a 360 hours Theatre Training which concluded with the production of Andha Yug by its participants, organized World Dance Day Celebrations by a Kathak recital by dance maestro Priya Dutta and students.

With a focus on regional culture, RKJ highlighted local Melas and events. It held national level workshops; for the Producers of ‘Kisan Vani’, and on Planning and Production on Women and Children program.\n\nTree Talk: Kudos to Om Vidyarathi, for spearheading the movement to spread tree consciousness with unparalleled regularity and participation of civil society. He has taken ‘The Tree Talk’, to J&K’s nook & corners, city gardens, forest locations, wetlands, educational institutions, sacred groves, and highlighted tree associated traditions, biodiversity components, rare, endangered, threatened taxa, utilization, value addition, distribution, conservation, ecological concerns, ex-situ conservation in wildlife areas, in situ conservation in parks & gardens and nature interpretation."
