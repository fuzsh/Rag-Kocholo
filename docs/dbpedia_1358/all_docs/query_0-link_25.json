        "text": "This is one chapter of a volume I edited including chapters by prominent dancer/scholars of other classical Indian dance genres ISBN 9788182903647 Classical Indian aesthetics use human love (Shringar Rasa) as the closest metaphor to approaching an understanding of divine love, and consequently divides and subdivides the nuances and states of love in relation to anticipation, preparation, yearning, waiting, disappointment, betrayal, reconciliation and ultimately, union. The Shringara Rasa theory shared across classical dance genres of India has already been detailed in earlier chapters. This aesthetic philosophy of love imbued with Bhakti, or devotion, is presented to a highly sophisticated and refined degree in the art of Odissi dance and the poetry that inspires it.\n\nRasa plays a very prominent role in performing arts. It is the soul and motive for a successful performance of a dance, an act or a play. If Rasa is to be of any moment and significance, it must necessarily be educated and explored. This research article might provoke thought and further inspire the performer to devise various ways and means in understanding the concept and significance of Rasa and incorporate the same in their performances. It would also facilitate in creating interest among individuals and professionals and further help in taking up in-depth research in this domain.This study has been undertaken to investigate the aesthetics of the sentiments and their interpretation in Kuchipudi dance.\n\nRasa is an essence of every work of art like dance, music and Literature that can only be suggested and not articulated. It is a type of thoughtful abstraction in which the world of physical forms is permeated by the interiority of the human feelings. However, the word may seem magical at first but it is not so in actual because to experience rasa one does not need any magical spell but has to be sensitive enough to connect with the emotions of the work. It is the concept of emotions, connections and feelings. This research paper aims to explore the meaning, history and scope of rasa theory in present scenario.\n\nAbstract In the world of Indian Classical Music, when an artist enter the „Raga vishva‟, whatever the artist sense, is expressed through the art, and audience enjoy it through performance, which creates a „Resonating Bliss‟ is termed as the Rasa. Through Raga architecture and Raga Expansion, the achievement of extremity of Raga Sangeet is the ultimate aspire, and it is the brilliance testing point for an artist. Raga is a Thought, Emotion and Beauty. The combination of manifestation and aesthetics sense is a reward of superior presentation, and therefore the self (artist) and audiences releasement in the extreme flow of delight is the „Rasanubhava‟ for both , performer and listener. Keywords:Sthayee-bhava, Rasanubhuti, Emotions, Music, Bhava, Kakubheda.\n\nSimilar to all dancers around the world, performers of Indian classical dances use body limbs and their movements as the medium of expressing their message too. In every dance, the body movements represent feelings, emotions and the purpose of the dancers. Since Indian classical dances have got their roots in Hindu gods worshiping, and are performed to worship them (based on religious laws, dancing is essential in worshiping), each movement of the dance has a special meanings. Present research aims to study and identify the means of expression including body movements, make up method, costume and stage accessories as the media and tool of expression in this ancient art. Present research also tries to answer the following question: are these body movements symbolic in Indian ritual dances? What are their meanings? When are they employed? Present research is a descriptive study documenting data through documentary and field study methods. Based on obtained results dancers try to repre...\n\nThe theory of Rasa has been a fascinating term both in performing and visual arts. Though the origin of the term date back historically enveloping millenniums; the application of the theory is so very axiomatic till date. While defining drama, the Sanskrit legend Bharata Muni says, “Nātya is trailokyānukaraṇa”, which means, “Drama is an imitation of the three worlds”. The major text dealing with Rasa is Nātyaṡāstra, penned by Bharat Muni. The paper tries to heave light on the concept of Rasa and how Rasa finds its application in each and every form of art, evoking emotion in the reader or audience and helping them to transcend the mortal world to a world of spiritual and moral consciousness.
