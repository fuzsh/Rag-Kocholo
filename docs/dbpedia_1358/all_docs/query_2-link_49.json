        "text": "Assessment of hybrid seed genetic purity is one of the most important quality control parameters in hybrid seed production. With the objective of replacing the GOT with DNA based assays, Cytoplasmic Male Sterile (CMS), restorer and hybrid lines have been screened by means of microsatellite and Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers. Cytoplasmic Male Sterile (CMS) lines often get contaminated with cognate isonuclear maintainer lines during multiplication. The PCR assay was able to detect precisely the impurities in a commercial seed lot of CMS line. The extent of heterozygosity within parental lines of rice hybrids were assessed and the results suggest that a single, appropriately chosen microsatellite marker should be sufficient for assessing hybrid seed purity.\n\nRice is the main food crop for more than half of the world population. It has been estimated that the world will have to produce 60% more rice by 2030 than what is produced in 1995 (Yuan L P. 2004). Hybrid rice grows faster, yield more, and resist stress better than either parent (Yuan L P. 2012). So, hybrid rice has been proved practically for many years playing a critical role in solving the food problem by more than 20% yield advantage over improved inbred varieties (Yuan L P. 1996, 1997). Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae isolates numbering 30 obtained from hybrid lines, their cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), restorer, maintainer and inbred lines, revealed a greater amount of genetic diversity. Fifteen lineages were detected at a similarity level of 60%. The result emphasizes that these pathotypes are mismatched with the genes, xa-5, xa-13 and Xa-21 suggesting the possibility of pyramiding them for enhancing the resistance in the rice hybrids.\n\nMicrosatellite markers are useful in fingerprinting, for assessing variation within parental lines and testing the genetic pu rity of hybrid seed in rice. In this paper we report the identification of pure rice hybrids using microsatellite polymorphisms. Th irty simple sequence repeat microsatellite (SSR) markers were employed for fingerprinting 18 rice hybrids and their parental lines. Twelve SSR markers were found polymorphic across the parents and produced unique fingerprint for the parents. Among the mark ers RM - 17 and RM - 84 precisely distinguished between pure hybrids and mixture/off type. Cluster analysis based on Simple matching (SM) similarity coefficient using UPGMA grouped the hybrids into three clusters. The genetic similarity between the hybrids ran ged from 0.43 to 0.81 with an average similarity index of 0.63.\n\nMolecular breeding plays an important role in sustainable agriculture development. Hybrid rice technology aims to increase the yield potential of rice beyond the level of inbred high-yielding varieties (HYVs) by exploiting the phenomenon of hybrid vigour or heterosis. Improvement of hybrid rice parental line is necessary to meet the food security problem. Parental polymorphism was carried with 215 SSR markers between five recurrents and ten donors. During the foreground selection, both reported markers (S5-Indel and BF-S5) were validated for wide compatibility, 2 out of 14 (ART5 and SC3) validates for submergence tolerance, one out of two (RM5) validate for stigma exsertion, whereas 2 of 3 markers (RM5970, RM3476) validated for elongated uppermost internode traits between recurrents and donors. For background selection, maximum polymorphic markers (112) between IR58025eB i.e improved maintainer line with elongated uppermost internode and Oryza meridionalis and minimum polymorphic markers (42) between IR79156B and IR91-1591- 3 were found. Marker-assisted backcrossing accelerate, the transfer of gene of interest in desirable genetic background. Genotypes IR58025B and IR58025eB emerged as genetically most similar with a value of 97%. The genotypes IR64 Sub1 and Oryza meridionalis were found most divergent showing 33% genetic similarity. Dissimilarity coefficient of the generated information obtained on genetic relatedness would be supportive in further rice breeding program."
