Rama Rao's novel of same name.[1] Ramarao was known for his crime and detective novels, but this film was a social drama. It was directed by S. Siddalingaiah under the banner Srinidhi Productions. Prior to this, Siddalingaiah had worked with Rajkumar in Mayor Muthanna. It stars Rajkumar and Bharathi. The film was screened for over two years at the States Theatre (now Bhumika Theatre) in Bangalore and was screened for sixty weeks in Chamundeshwari theatre in Mysore, the film Completed one year in many centres and twenty five weeks in every major and minor centre.[2] The movie saw a 25 weeks run when it was re-released in 1988.\n\nThe film was produced by R. Lakshman and Gopal, the film set new standards in the production design. Breaking away from conventional movie making, the producers preferred an open discussion with the crew and preliminary survey of outdoor shooting venues. While Lakshman was a Kannada activist closely associated with a league of frontline writers such as A.N. Krishna Rao and M.N. Murthy and managing the famous Bharat Talkies on the J.C. Road, Gopal was his close associate with a penchant for cinema. Most of the film was shot in Kalasa village in Chikmagalur district.\n\nThe music for the film was composed by G. K. Venkatesh. All five songs of the film became hits. Among the five songs, the song \"Aagadu Endu Kai Katti Kulithare\" became an inspirational song to the people. All the songs were sung by P. Susheela and P. B. Srinivas.\n\nThe film became the highest grossing Kannada film at the time of its release . Today this film is viewed as a milestone in Rajkumar's career. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, Forbes included Rajkumar's performance in the film on its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\".[3] The film was remade in Telugu in 1975 as Devudulanti Manishi, starring Krishna.[4]\n\nPlot\n\nRajiva is on his way to visit his sister, Sharadha, but to his astonishment, he discovers upon arrival that his brother-in-law has died. With no one left to care for Rajiv's elder sister's family, he takes a loan to improve their situation and begins irrigation on his brother-in-law's land. Sharada's sons, Keshava and Chakrapani, leave for Bengaluru to pursue higher studies. Meanwhile, Rajiva falls in love with Lakshmi, his neighbor's daughter.\n\nMotivated to improve their lives further, Rajiva purchased 25 acres of barren land near the village from the government. Through his efforts, he becomes a successful and respected individual in the village, earning substantial profits. However, Rajiva frequently travels to Belgaum, another city, every six months. During one of his trips, he visits a woman named Sharavathi and her son, Kishore, in Belgaum.\n\nKeshava marries Nagaveni, the daughter of Rajiva and Sharada's elder brother, Ramachandra. Chakrapani agrees to marry Nandini, a daughter of a family friend. Sridhar, a friend of Keshava and Chakrapani, marries Saraswati, Sharada's only daughter. Eventually, Rajiva agrees to marry Lakshmi. Patil, a neighbor of Sharavathi, informs Keshava about Rajiva's periodic visits to Belgaum. To confirm this troubling news, Keshava travels to Belgaum and sees Rajiva's photo displayed in Sharavathi's house. When asked about Rajiva, Sharavathi replies, \"Mane Yajamanru adu\" (the house owner). Filled with disrespect for Rajiva, Keshava confronts him and requests 50,000 Rupees to start a business. Rajiva was firm that he will give Keshava the money once he understands its value.\n\nIn a fit of anger, Keshava reveals to Lakshmi and Sharada about Sharavathi, accusing Rajiva of adultery. However, both Lakshmi and Sharada refuse to believe the accusation and decide not to disclose their knowledge about Sharavathi to Rajiva. One afternoon, while taking lunch to her husband in the field, Lakshmi is chased by a bull. Despite Rajiva's attempt to fend off the bull, Lakshmi falls into a nearby well. Rajiva dives in to save her but arrives too late.\n\nNagaveni convinces Keshava to seek legal assistance in reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. Keshava visits Rajiva to discuss the matter, leading to a disagreement between Rajiva and Sharadha. During the argument, Keshava directs hurtful words at Rajiva, accusing him of stealing their property and taking advantage of their situation. He even claims that the rice in front of him is not his. Disturbed by this, Rajiva washes his hands without consuming a morsel of rice. He quietly exits the house while silently praying for the well-being of the villagers.\n\nChakrapani locates Sharavathi and brings her to Rajiva's house to showcase Rajiva's magnanimity to Keshava. Sharavathi reveals that she is their half-sister, an illegitimate child of Sharadha's husband. Rajiva had kept this secret and supported her throughout the years. Determined to find Rajiva, they set out on a search but are unable to locate him. Rajiva quietly walks into the sunset.\n\nLegacy\n\nBangaarada Manushya had a tremendous impact on moviegoers. Some city youth, inspired by the movie's central theme—returning to one's ancestral village—left their jobs, came back to their respective villages and took to agriculture.[8] The film had a phenomenal box office run and was screened for two years in a row in the States film theatre on Kempe Gowda road in Bangalore.[9] The film had a deep social impact on the audience as well and there are many stories of people in the city going to villages and becoming farmers. The film also touched on very important topics like rural development, modern agricultural practices, co-operative movement, social unity, honesty, love and dedication. In the beginning of the movie, it shows the hardship of farmers and how much they have to toil in order to make ends meet. The movie subtly says that middle-class and working-class are the backbone of the country by showing the son of a rich village head as being a spoiled brat wasting his money in the city. One of the most important messages given in the movie is that, one should not waste time and money in trying to modernize/westernize themselves through a posh lifestyle. One should be true to his identity and not try to become someone else. This theme struck a chord with the audience as Karnataka was one of the fast developing states in the country and there was a large migration from rural to urban areas.\n\nAfter the film ran for a year just at the States theatre in Bangalore, the management of the cinema hall decided to stop screening the film to accommodate a new film. This caused public outrage and took a violent turn. However, S. Bangarappa, the then MLA, intervened and resolved the issue successfully. The film went on to complete two years.\n\nThe film was remade in Telugu in 1975 as Devudulanti Manishi, starring Krishna.[4] On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, Forbes India included the performances of Rajkumar in the film on its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\".[10] The 2017 film Bangara s/o Bangarada Manushya starring Dr. Rajkumar's son Shiva Rajkumar had a similar plot dealing with the problems of farmers.[11]\n\nThe film inspired the name of a book.[12]\n\nRajkumar: The Inimitable Actor With A Golden Voice\n\nThe English translation of the book Bangarada Manushya named Rajkumar: The Inimitable Actor With A Golden Voice was released in New Jersey, United States on 10 May 2008. The same book was released in London, England by Edward Thamson, Senator during the month of August 2008.
