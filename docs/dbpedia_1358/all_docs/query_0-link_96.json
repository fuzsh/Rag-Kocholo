This bilingual film is based on Nathuram Godse's murder of Mahatma Gandhi. Because Gandhi was portrayed negatively in this film there was a significant uproar among various left-leaning political parties.\n\nVishwaroopam Controversy\n\nVishwaroopam an Indian movie released in 2013 faced a number of contentious problems. The Hindu Makkal Katchi party wanted a change from its existing Sanskrit title to a solely Tamil one in the first case of this nature. Theatre owners urged a retraction of this arrangement when Kamal Haasan announced a direct-to-home (DTH) release of the movie out of concern for significant revenue losses to DTH operators. Haasan consented to let the movie premiere in theatres first after threatening a complete theatre boycott of Vishwaroopam.\n\nLater Muslim organisations in Tamil Nadu urged that the movie be stopped claiming that it would offend Muslim sensibilities. Despite Tamil Nadu district collectors ordering theatre owners not to screen Vishwaroopam despite the film's approval by the Central Board of Film Certification of India which cited law and order issues the movie was released in neighbouring states with higher Muslim populations than Tamil Nadu. The ban in Tamil Nadu caused screenings in nearby Indian states as well as a few international markets to cease.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha was accused of having political and commercial interests which the Indian film industry denies and her actions were criticised as a direct attack on freedom of speech in India. Kamal Haasan claimed that after repeated pressure to remove the supposedly controversial parts from the movie he may be compelled to leave Tamil Nadu and India because he was \"tired of being pushed within a dirty political game.\"\n\nNathuram Godse Controversy\n\nAt a political rally in Aravakurichi Tamil Nadu Kamal Haasan said something controversial about the country's first terrorist. The Vishwaroopam actor claimed that Nathuram Godse who killed Mahatma Gandhi was the first terrorist of independent India. As a good Indian who values equality Kamal Haasan further stated that he would \"want the three colours in the tricolour to remain intact.\"\n\nPlebiscite in Kashmir\n\nThe actor became embroiled in controversy in February 2018 after he questioned why India was reluctant to conduct a referendum in Kashmir. This declaration was made following a treacherous attack in Pulwama by the Jaish-e-Mohammed that resulted in the deaths of 40 members of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). No soldier would perish according to Kamal if Indian and Pakistani politicians acted decently. He said \"The Line of Control will be in control.\" He soon came under fire from a number of lawmakers and civilians which forced him to retract his statement. His party Makkal Needhi Maiyam said in a news release that his remarks had been exaggerated.\n\nPoonool Controversy\n\nDuring a Q&A session on Twitter in July 2018 Kamal Haasan responded to a number of queries from his followers. Which books or \"nool\" in Tamil have had a significant influence on his life one of his followers inquired. The performer remarked \"I steered clear of one thread. I was greatly impacted by the thread Poonool. I stayed away because of that.\" He drew harsh criticism for his remarks from the Brahmin community who wear the sacred thread.\n\nNet Worth\n\nKamal Haasan’s net worth in 2022 is $50 million US or 399 Crore Indian Rupees.
