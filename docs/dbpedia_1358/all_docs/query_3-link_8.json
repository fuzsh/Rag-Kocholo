        "text": "Marathi Cinema, also known as Marathi film industry, is the segment of Indian cinema, dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Marathi language widely spoken in the state of Maharashtra. It is based in Mumbai. It is the oldest film industry of India and one of the leaders in filmmaking in the Indian film industry.[4]\n\nRaja Harishchandra, directed by Dadasaheb Phalke and released in 1913, was the first Marathi-language film ever made, and was also India's first full-length feature film. The claim is disputed and some claim that Dadasaheb Torne's Shree Pundalik (1912) was the first film made in Maharashtra.[5][6][7] The first Marathi talkie film was Ayodhyecha Raja,[8] released in 1932, one year after Alam Ara, the first Hindi talkie. All Marathi films until then were silent films with intertitles. Pinjara (1972), directed by V Shantaram, was first colour film in Marathi cinema.[9]"
