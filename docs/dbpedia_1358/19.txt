It is based in Mumbai. It is the oldest film industry of India and one of the leaders in filmmaking in the Indian film industry.[4]

Raja Harishchandra, directed by Dadasaheb Phalke and released in 1913, was the first Marathi-language film ever made, and was also India's first full-length feature film. The claim is disputed and some claim that Dadasaheb Torne's Shree Pundalik (1912) was the first film made in Maharashtra.[5][6][7] The first Marathi talkie film was Ayodhyecha Raja,[8] released in 1932, one year after Alam Ara, the first Hindi talkie. All Marathi films until then were silent films with intertitles. Pinjara (1972), directed by V Shantaram, was first colour film in Marathi cinema.[9]
