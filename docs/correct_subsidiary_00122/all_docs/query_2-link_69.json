        "text": "Susana Amorim joined Gilde in 2021 and focuses on the Healthtech sector. She is involved in deal sourcing, investment diligence, and portfolio management.\n\nPrior to joining Gilde, Susana was a Biodesign Innovation fellow at Stanford University, a program that trains a select group of innovators to identify healthcare needs, invent new technologies, and implement products into patient care. Before this, Susana was also selected to participate in the MIT-Harvard Medical School Healthcare Innovation Bootcamp where she helped create a healthcare venture to improve mental health.\n\nSusana began her career in structural heart, working as an Engineer and subsequently Project Manager at Xeltis, a clinical-stage start-up creating novel cardiovascular devices through regenerative medicine. She then worked as a Project Manager at Biotronik where she was responsible for and led the development of a new generation transcatheter aortic valve.\n\nSusana has a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Minho/University of Groningen. She also has a certification in project management (PMP) from the Project Management Institute.\n\nShe is a Portuguese citizen based in Gilde’s US office.\n\nJeanne Bolger, MB BCh BAO, is a Venture Partner with Seroba.\n\nJeanne has over 35 years of pharmaceutical industry experience in management roles across R&D, Commercial and Business Development (BD) and Venture Investments. She spent 11 years in Licensing and Acquisition (L&A), including Global Head of Scientific Licensing for Johnson & Johnson’s Pharmaceutical business, and before that as Director in the Business Development group at GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nJeanne spent nearly 10 years (2012-2022) as Vice President Venture Investment in J&J’s corporate venture fund, Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC. During that period, she was based in London, leading investments across Europe in start-up and early stage life science companies in areas of strategic interest to J&J’s business sectors in Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Medical Devices and Consumer. She represented JJDC on the Board of Directors of over a dozen companies, including Aelix Therapeutics, Asceneuron SA, Aviado Bio, Biocartis, Calypso Biotech, Inivata, Merus, Pulmocide, S-Biomedic, Syndesi, T-Rex. Dr Bolger also represented JJDC’s LP investments in multiple Venture Capital Funds in UK and Europe as well as representing J&J’s interests in other funding vehicles including incubators and accelerators.\n\nJeanne received her medical degree from University College Dublin. She is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Ireland (RAMI). Dr Bolger has served as the sole pharma industry representative on two Irish government taskforces seeking to enhance the commercialization of IP from Irish academic centres. She is a visiting lecturer on the MSc Pharmaceutical Medicine at Trinity College Dublin. Jeanne sits on the Industry Advisory Board of CURAM, the SFI-funded Centre of Excellence charged with designing the next generation of smart medical devices, and on the Advisory Group of the National Health Innovation Hub which focuses on digital innovation in healthcare. She is on the Advisory Board of the Sir Francis Crick Translational Fund (UK), Chair of Board of Directors at Exevir SA (Private, Belgium) and Non-executive Director at Life Healthcare Group Holdings (JSE:LHC).\n\nAndrew Cleeland is a seasoned executive with over 30 years experience in the medical device industry. During this time, he has held key leadership positions in organizations ranging from early-stage startups to large multinationals. In joining Fogarty Innovation he further broadens this range of experience to include managing a nonprofit. The versatility required to be effective across such diverse groups is rare and is a testament to Andrew’s strong leadership skills.\n\nA native Australian who grew up in a suburb of Melbourne, Andrew’s leadership capabilities became evident at an early age. Raised by a single parent, Andrew was forced to grow up quickly and play a supportive role for his mother and brother. These early experiences were formative in shaping the person Andrew would become and the things he would inevitably accomplish.\n\nAndrew’s values and life philosophy were also greatly influenced by sport. His natural athleticism and leadership propelled him into many team captain roles and ultimately competing in Australian Rules Football at a semi-professional level. If you’ve never seen this sport played, do so. It won’t take long to recognize the toughness, teamwork and grit the sport demands, all traits which Andrew continues to bring to every position he holds.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree, Andrew began his medtech career working for the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. This provided an invaluable introduction to the industry along with an appreciation for the challenges regulators face when balancing innovation with protecting public health. Several years into this role, serendipity presented him with a unique opportunity to work for a company based in the United States. Although he had never lived outside Australia, he saw it as a great opportunity and moved alone to Denver, Colorado, to work for Telectronics. He probably didn’t realize it at the time, but this move exemplifies a classic element of Andrew’s personal and professional mindset: think big, set audacious goals and act boldly. At the time, Andrew expected this to be a two-year position. Thirty years later, he’s still in the U.S., setting and achieving big goals.\n\nAndrew’s rapid career advancement during this timeframe has been impressive. After Telectronics, he accepted a management role at Baxter Healthcare’s Novacor division, and later as vice president of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs at Bay Area startup company Radiant Medical. Following this, he was CEO of Ardian, which pioneered the use of renal denervation to treat hypertension. Ardian was acquired by Medtronic in 2011 in a transaction valued at over $1.3B which, at the time, was the largest medical device acquisition ever for a pre-revenue medical device company.\n\nWhenever a first time CEO has such a wildly successful exit, the market often wonders: Is the person really that good or were they just lucky? Andrew quickly answered that question by taking the role of CEO at Twelve, a startup in the transcatheter mitral valve space. Several years after his joining, this company was also acquired by Medtronic in a transaction valued at $458M. Back to back successes at such large valuations answered the question – it wasn’t just luck.\n\nPropelled by these successes, Andrew has become a key figure in the medical device community. His leadership, experience and insights have led many organizations to seek his involvement. He currently serves on the board of three venture-funded companies — Saluda Medical, Zenflow, Inc. (chairman) and MMI S.p.A. (chairman). He also holds advisory positions at two top-tier venture capital firms: Longitude Capital and Arboretum Ventures. At a global industry level, he has been invited to serve on multiple initiatives including the UCSF-Stanford Pediatric Device Consortium; the Medical Device Innovation Consortium; and the Singapore government’s Biomedical Research Council (BMRC).\n\nPassionate about healthcare, Andrew is a champion of innovators and innovation in the medtech field. His commitment to mentoring and education is rooted in his passion for helping patients and being a catalyst for positive change. This purpose and drive is captured in one of his favorite quotes, by Mahatma Gandhi: “A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history.”\n\n“Working at Fogarty Innovation gives me the ability to positively influence the medtech ecosystem and give back in a meaningful and effective way,” summarizes Andrew. “To have worked with such amazing teammates on such impactful programs has allowed me to do something BOTH meaningful and enjoyable…I love the challenge.”\n\nAndrew has received numerous awards and honors and is a frequent invited lecturer at major industry conferences and leading academic institutions. Andrew holds a BS in biophysics from the Swinburne Institute of Technology.\n\nI am a medical oncologist with expertise in treating all stages of breast cancer in people of all ages, including young women who have unique concerns about fertility.\n\nOver the years, I have learned how terrifying a breast cancer diagnosis can be for my patients and their families. My practice is focused on providing personalized, compassionate care that is based on the most up-to-date research, diagnostic tools, and therapies. My patients, along with a team of experts from many different departments across Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), are my most important partners in developing treatment plans.\n\nSince college, I have never wavered in my choice of becoming a breast medical oncologist. A volunteer opportunity at a hospital boutique helping women with wigs and breast prostheses taught me that a patient’s experience with breast cancer encompasses so much more than just the biology of the disease. At the same time, some of my family members were affected by cancer, and I was fortunate to be exposed to leaders in the field. These experiences led me to work in a lab, where I studied the estrogen receptor. I was — and continue to be — fascinated by the science and ever-changing advances of breast cancer.\n\nMy research focuses on improving how we identify, prevent, and treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. I work to understand the environment in which cancer grows and how the immune system can play an important role in cancer development. I am also leading a clinical trial aimed at mobilizing the immune system to attack cancer early on in a patient’s diagnosis.\n\nWhen patients first meet with me, they often feel as though the rug has been pulled right out from under them. One of the first things I ask is what they are most afraid of. Everyone is unique in their fears, so addressing those fears as well as needs and treatment goals helps us work together to create the most effective care plan.\n\nAt the end of each appointment, I hope each patient feels that they have been heard, understands their diagnosis, and is confident in the treatment plan we’ve created together. I also want them to know that they are not alone — we are here to help.\n\nBeyond clinical care, I am passionate about communicating essential medical and scientific information to the public, particularly as it relates to women’s healthcare and wellness. I also have had the privilege of mentoring countless students throughout their academic and medical careers.\n\nOutside of work, I love spending time with my husband and three young children. I also enjoy exercise such as running, yoga, dancing — you name it, I’ve tried it!\n\nJanke Dittmer joined Gilde in 2011 as a Partner.
