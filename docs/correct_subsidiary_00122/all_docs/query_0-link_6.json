(Redwood City, CA, USA) for around US$81 million.\n\nHeartport is a pioneer in developing, manufacturing, and selling cardiac surgery products that enable surgeons to perform a wide range of less-invasive open-chest and minimally invasive heart operations, including stopped heart and beating heart procedures. Following the acquisition, Heartport will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, operating as part of its Ethicon business. Ethicon manufactures and markets surgical devices.\n\n\"The addition of Heartport demonstrates Johnson & Johnson's expanding commitment to the cardiovascular market,‚Äù said Dennis Longstreet, company group chairman, Ethicon Worldwide. \"It further broadens our worldwide offering of innovative surgical solutions for our customers, and it provides Ethicon with a fill complement of products to meet the cardiac surgeon's needs in this rapidly growing segment.‚Äù\n\nRelated Links:\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nGold Member\n\nPOC Blood Gas Analyzer\n\nStat Profile Prime Plus\n\nGold Member\n\nDisposable Protective Suit For Medical Use\n\nDisposable Protective Suit For Medical Use\n\nSilver Member\n\nWireless Mobile ECG Recorder\n\nNR-1207-3/NR-1207-E\n\nPatient Monitor\n\nUM2012"
