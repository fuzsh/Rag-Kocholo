The brothers believed there was a need for scientifically formulated products to improve individuals’ health and well-being.\n\nAt that time, the pharmaceutical industry was largely unregulated, and numerous health risks were associated with the use of medicines and medical devices. The Johnson brothers sought to change this by creating safe and effective products.\n\nTheir first major breakthrough came in 1888 with the launch of Johnson’s Baby Powder. This talcum powder was specifically formulated to be gentle and mild, making it ideal for the delicate skin of babies. Johnson’s Baby Powder quickly became a staple in homes across America and laid the foundation for Johnson & Johnson’s success.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Johnson & Johnson expanded its product portfolio by introducing other innovative healthcare products. One key milestone was the creation of the first commercial sterile surgical dressings in 1887. This development revolutionized the field of surgery and made procedures safer and more effective.\n\nOver the years, Johnson & Johnson continued to grow and diversify its business. The company expanded its presence globally and established a strong reputation for quality and reliability. It introduced a range of new products, including Band-Aid adhesive bandages, Listerine mouthwash, and Tylenol pain relief medication.\n\nHowever, Johnson & Johnson faced its share of challenges along the way. In 1982, the company faced a major crisis when several individuals died after consuming cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. This incident prompted Johnson & Johnson to initiate a nationwide product recall and implement stringent safety measures. The company’s swift and transparent response not only helped restore confidence in Tylenol, but also set new standards for crisis management in the industry.\n\nDespite this setback, Johnson & Johnson rebounded and continued to innovate. The company expanded into new areas of healthcare, including medical devices and diagnostics. It acquired several companies to enhance its capabilities and broaden its product offerings.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is a global leader in the healthcare industry, operating in three main segments: pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer health. The company’s portfolio includes well-known brands such as Neutrogena, Aveeno, Acuvue, and Ethicon.\n\nThroughout its history, Johnson & Johnson has remained committed to its founding principles of putting the needs of patients and customers first. The company’s business model revolves around innovation, quality, and ethical conduct. Johnson & Johnson continues to invest in research and development to bring new and improved healthcare solutions to the market.\n\nWho Owns Johnson & Johnson\n\nAs of November 5, 2023, the ownership of Johnson & Johnson is primarily in the hands of institutional investors, who collectively control a significant majority of the company’s outstanding shares.
