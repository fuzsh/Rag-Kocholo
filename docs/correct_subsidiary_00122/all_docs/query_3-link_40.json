        "text": "Performance breakdown\n\nGovernance of Access\n\nPlaces 2nd, scores 4.43\n\nHas an access-to-medicine strategy with measurable objectives, integrated within its overall corporate strategy. Johnson & Johnsons performs strongly. Its access strategy, embedded in its Global Public Health unit and Janssen Access and Pricing Principles, covers all therapeutic areas in which the company is involved. The highest responsibility for access lies directly with the board, namely with the Science & Technology Committee.\n\nProvides evidence of financial and non-financial access-related incentives at the executive level. Johnson & Johnson performs strongly. It incentivises its senior executives, including its CEO and members of the Executive Committee, and regional managers to take action on access to medicine with financial and non-financial rewards. Senior management, including the CEO, have enterprise-level targets as well as access-related performance indicators, including KPIs to improve access to medicine, as part of their annual goals and objectives.\n\nPublicly discloses outcomes of its access-to-medicine activities. Johnson & Johnson performs strongly in transparency of access activities. It publicly discloses commitments, measurable goals, objectives and targets for improving access to medicine in countries in scope of the Index. It facilitates accountability and transparency by consistently sharing the outcomes of its access-to-medicine activities in a centralised manner within its annual Health for Humanity Goals Progress Scorecard.\n\nPerforms above average in responsible promotional practices. Johnson & Johnson’s sales agents are not solely incentivised on sales volume targets. The company, however, sets sales incentives at the individual level for agents. It does not publicly disclose information related to transfers of values to healthcare professionals in countries in scope of the Index (e.g. payments for attending events or promotional activities) except as required by law or national/regional trade associations (e.g., EFPIA), though it has policies and procedures in place limiting transfers of values to healthcare professionals in countries in scope of the Index. In addition, the company reports not using sales and marketing representatives for some products related to diseases in scope, such as HIV/AIDS medicines.\n\nHas a robust set of compliance controls to ensure that governance efforts are not undermined by non-compliant or corrupt activities. Johnson & Johnson performs strongly, demonstrating evidence of all components looked for by the Index: fraud-specific risk assessment, country risk-based assessment, a continuous system to monitor activities, audits (both internal and external, covering third parties and in all countries where it operates) and has formal processes to ensure third-party compliance with company standards. No breaches in countries in scope of the Index were publicly found in the period of analysis.\n\nPublicly supports international agreements, such as the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement. Johnson & Johnson publicly recognises and supports international agreements including the TRIPS Agreement, and states that it advocates for strong intellectual property (IP) systems that promote innovation. The company expresses reservations on compulsory licensing, namely that it should be limited to certain circumstances when alternatives are exhausted. There is evidence of industry association lobbying on IP and the usage of TRIPS flexibilities, namely of compulsory licensing, by national governments in some countries in scope of the Index. As a member of the industry association, Johnson & Johnson, like all other member companies in scope of the Index, is by default connected to this activity.\n\nProduct Delivery\n\nPlaces 3rd, scores 4.09\n\nPublic commitment not to enforce patents in countries in scope. Johnson & Johnson has had a specific policy since 2012 not to enforce the patents it owns and controls on the antiretroviral drug darunavir (Prezista®) in sub-Saharan Africa and Least Developed Countries. In 2015, it expanded the geographical scope of the policy for paediatric products used in LMICs.\n\nPublicly discloses information on patent status. Like most of its peers, Johnson & Johnson discloses the patent statuses for small molecules in scope via the Pat-INFORMED database. Johnson & Johnson discloses patent information including filing date, grant number, grant date and jurisdiction.\n\nPerforms above average in terms of sharing intellectual property (IP) assets with third-party researchers. Johnson & Johnson engaged in two new IP-sharing agreements with third-party research institutions or drug discovery initiatives established during the current analysis period that meet all inclusion criteria for evaluation. The company does have existing agreements of this nature in place that were established before the current Index cycle and meet all inclusion criteria for evaluation.\n\nUses licensing to enable generic supply. Johnson & Johnson has a non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreement for one compound (for diseases in scope). Its licence for rilpivirine (Edurant®) encompasses 83 countries in scope, including 57 middle income countries. It has also issued a non-assert declaration for one patented compound in scope, darunavir (Prezista®).\n\nFiled to register new products in 15 countries in scope on average. Johnson & Johnson has filed filed six products in at least one country in scope of the Index with the highest burden of disease (for products that could be assessed with available global burden of disease data, which excludes COVID-19). Among new products, its most widely filed is the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, rapidly authorized in 41 countries within the scope of the Index, 13 of which are LICs. Examples include Somalia, Sudan and Uganda. Johnson & Johnson also received emergency use waivers or import permits in 31 countries in scope of the Index. Among old products, canagliflozin/ metformin (Vokanamet®/Invokamet®) has been filed in 18 countries within the scope of the Index, including one high burden disease country.\n\nHas access strategies for all supranationally procured products in scope for this analysis. Johnson & Johnson leads in securing access for products procured supranationally. For the four products assessed in this category, the company demonstrates strategies both in countries eligible for supply from such procurers, and also in at least one country not eligible for such supply. For example, the company supplied its Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at a not-for-profit price via a supranational procurement agreement with the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT) as well as two advance purchase agreements with the South African government.\n\nHas access strategies for the majority of healthcare practitioner-administered products in scope of this analysis. Johnson & Johnson performs above average in this area. For three of the five products assessed, the company provides examples of access strategies which consider affordability in countries of all assessed income levels (UMIC, LMIC, LIC). The company makes efforts to reach additional patients using strategies considering relevant payers' ability to pay. For example, Johnson & Johnson secured bendamustine hydrochloride (Ribomustin®) reimbursement in both public institutions and private health insurance in Brazil. The company provides evidence of how patient reach has been increased through the approaches used in some of the country examples provided.\n\nHas access strategies for the majority of its self-administered products for countries in scope for this analysis. Johnson & Johnson performs above average in this area. For two of the five products assessed, the company provides examples of access strategies which consider affordability in countries of all assessed income levels (UMIC, LMIC, LIC). It makes efforts to reach additional patients through pricing strategies considering relevant payers' ability to pay and patient assistance programmes. For example, in an LIC for one cancer product, it provided evidence of pricing and non-pricing strategies to ensure continuous patient care while implementing health systems strengthening initiatives. Johnson & Johnson provides evidence of patient reach.\n\nFour of the five manufacturing capacity building initiatives included meet all Good Practice Standards. Johnson & Johnson's performance is above average in this area. The number of initiatives meeting all inclusion criteria is higher than average and more initiatives meet all Good Practice Standards (GPS) than what is average for this indicator. For example, the company collaborated with Aspen Pharmacare Limited, a manufacturer in South Africa to transfer technology to produce the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. This initiative meets all GPS.\n\nAll five supply chain capacity building initiatives included for analysis meet all Good Practice Standards. Johnson & Johnson is one of the leaders in this area. The number of initiatives meeting all inclusion criteria is higher than average and more initiatives meet all GPS than what is average for this indicator. For example, the company is involved in the Strategic Training Executives Programme (STEP 2.0) which is a targeted leadership and change management solution that trains public health supply chain managers and leaders in LMICs.\n\nAll five health systems strengthening initiatives included for analysis meet all Good Practice Standards. Johnson & Johnson is one of the leaders in this area. The number of initiatives meeting all inclusion criteria is higher than average and more initiatives meet all Good Practice Standards than what is average for this indicator. For example, Johnson & Johnson Global Public Health developed Vxnaid™, a vaccination monitoring platform which supports adherent vaccine administration in the framework of clinical studies or campaigns, including support of the Rwandan Ministry of Health’s large-scale Ebola vaccination campaign. The company’s ultimate goal is for the platform to be available on a more global scale.\n\nHas engaged in scaling up two and piloting four inclusive business models. Johnson & Johnson performs above average in the use of inclusive business models aimed at meeting the access needs of populations at the base of the income pyramid (including other underserved populations) in LMICs. Johnson & Johnson Impact Ventures, a fund within the Johnson & Johnson Foundation, helped to scale up South Lake Medical Center, a specialised low-cost primary care hospital in Naivasha, Kenya that runs a hub-and-spoke healthcare model.\n\nPerforms above average in terms of ensuring continuous supply of medicines in LMICs. Johnson & Johnson is involved in technology transfers with third-party manufacturers in LMICs, and has a system in place to work with relevant stakeholders to communicate issues that may affect the supply chain, works with several active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers, manages a buffer stock of relevant products and is involved in supply chain capacity building initiatives.\n\nHas a procedure for reporting substandard and falsified (SF) medicines in countries in scope of the Index in less than ten days. Johnson & Johnson has a procedure for reporting SF medicines to national health authorities within five days. The company reports aiming at reporting within two days if the case presents a direct and serious or life-threatening risk to patient or healthcare professional. It distinguishes quicker reporting time frames for cases which only require visual inspection to be confirmed.\n\nDonates in response to expressed need and monitors delivery. Johnson & Johnson has public policies and supply processes in place to ensure ad hoc donations are carried out rapidly in response to expressed need, and it monitors the delivery of donations.\n\nPublicly commits to the achievement of elimination, eradication or control goals in one structured donation programme for neglected tropical diseases or malaria. Johnson & Johnson publicly commits to supporting the control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis as a public health problem through its donation of mebendazole (Vermox®) until the end of 2025 in 51 countries in scope of the Index."
