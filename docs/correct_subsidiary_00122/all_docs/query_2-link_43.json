        "text": "Methods\n\nBetween February 1997 and October 1, 2001, a total of 402 procedures were performed with the EndoCPB system (Johnson & Johnson Corp) at our institution. Of these, 187 (46.5%) were mitral valve repair procedures performed by a single surgeon (H.V.), and this group constitutes the subjects of this study. This group of 187 patients represents 66.1% of all mitral valve repair procedures not combined with coronary artery bypass grafting at the OLV Clinic during the same time period. Initially, only simple repair procedures and low-risk patients were considered for this technique. As experience grew, more complex repair cases and higher-risk patients were also considered candidates for this technique. Currently, any mitral valve repair case, either isolated or combined with tricuspid valve disease or atrial septal defect (ASD), is approached with this technique.\n\nAll patients were preoperatively fully informed about the technique and were able to choose a standard median sternotomy if that was their preference.\n\nPatients\n\nThe mean age of the patients was 60.7 ± 13.1 years (range, 27-84 years), and 62% were male (n = 116). Comorbidity was present in 113 (60.4%) patients and included atrial fibrillation in 40 (21.3%) patients, arterial hypertension in 57 (30.5%) patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 15 (8%) patients, peripheral vascular disease in 2 (1.1%) patients, and insulin-dependent diabetes in 1 (0.5%) patient. Preoperative New York Heart Association functional class was I in 33 (17.6%) patients, II in 72 (38.5%) patients, III in 67 (35.8%) patients, and IV in 15 (8%) patients. Left ventricular function was normal in 136 (72.7%) patients, mildly impaired in 40 (21.4%) patients, moderately impaired in 8 (4.3%) patients, and severely impaired in 3 (1.6%) patients. The mean preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 58.6 ± 7.14 mm (range, 32-79 mm). The mean preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was 104.3 ± 32 mL/m2 (range, 44-196 mL/m2). The left ventricle was preoperatively not dilated in 54 patients.\n\nPreoperative mitral valve disease is detailed in Table 1.\n\nTable 1Preoperative mitral valve characteristics (n = 187)\n\nVariableN%Grade of regurgitation 2 +10.5 3+5831.0 4 +12868.4Valve pathology Degenerative15683.4 Fibroelastic deficiency14979.7 Barlow disease73.7 Endocarditis147.5 Sole annular dilatation168.6 Congenital10.5Carpentiers functional classification Type 1179.1 Type 216789.3 Posterior prolapse13672.7 Anterior prolapse2111.2 Prolapse of both leaflets105.3 Type 331.6\n\nThe patient with grade 2+ regurgitation had an associated ASD. The Carpentier classification was used to describe valve dysfunction.\n\n7\n\nCarpentier A\n\nCardiac valve surgery—the “French correction.”.\n\nThe median preoperative degree of mitral valve regurgitation was 4. All procedures were primary and elective interventions. In 2 patients the endoscopic mitral valve repair procedure was part of a hybrid approach. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the right coronary artery (n = 1) and left anterior descending artery (n = 1) were both performed before the valve procedure.\n\nPostoperatively, chest tubes were routinely kept for 48 hours (or longer if chest tube output remained sanguineous), regardless of whether bleeding stopped earlier and fluid became serous. Postoperative analgesia consisted of 10 mg of intravenous piritramide (Dipidolor; Janssen-Cilag, Beerse, Belgium) and 10 mg of intramuscular piritramide at the time sedation was stopped in the intensive care unit. Once the patient was extubated, analgesics were only given at the request of the patient. The patients were anticoagulated with fenprocoumon (Hoffmann, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) for 3 months and were then switched to acetylsalicylic acid unless they were in atrial fibrillation.\n\nSurgical technique\n\nAfter achievement of general anesthesia, the patient is placed in the supine position, with slight elevation of the right hemithorax. All patients are ventilated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. A right radial arterial line is inserted. Next, a 14F or 17F DLP cannula (Medtronic DLP, Grand Rapids, Mich) is placed percutaneously by the anesthesiologist through the internal jugular vein into the superior vena cava. This is performed under transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance.\n\nThe right common femoral artery and vein are exposed by using an oblique groin incision. A double pledget U stitch (4-0 polytetrafluoroethylene\n\n*\n\n*Gore-Tex; registered trademark of W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz.\n\n) is placed at the anterior side of the common femoral artery, and a double purse-string suture (4-0 polytetrafluoroethylene) is placed at the anterior side of the common femoral vein.\n\nAn anterolateral working port of 4 to 6 cm is made in the midportion of the right inframammary groove, usually the fourth intercostal space. A medium soft tissue retractor is inserted, but no other rib retractor is used. A camera port is also made in the fourth intercostal space but at the level of the anterior axillary line. Just before the introduction of the camera, the right lung is deflated. At the beginning of the procedure, a 0° camera is used, which is switched to a 30° downward-looking camera once the left atrium is opened and retracted. A venting port is made in the seventh intercostal space at the level of the anterior axillary line; this port also serves for carbon dioxide insufflation once the left atrium is opened. A left atrial blade retractor is introduced into the right side of the chest through the working port and connected to a 2-mm shaft penetrating the chest wall in the fourth intercostal space, just lateral to the right internal thoracic artery. When the right hemidiaphragm precludes a direct view on the left atrium, a pledget-supported stitch is used to pull the dome down through the seventh intercostal space (Figure 1).\n\nThe patient is heparinized, and the femoral vessels are cannulated with a Seldinger technique. TEE is used to precisely introduce and position the venous cannula (21F-25F) into the right atrium at the junction with the inferior vena cava. Next, the arterial cannula (21F-23F) is introduced, also by using the Seldinger technique. The endoaortic balloon is positioned from the groin, with TEE guidance, in the ascending aorta just above the sinotubular junction. We always used the endoaortic balloon and have no experience with the endo-direct transthoracic balloon cannula. CPB with kinetic assisted venous drainage is instituted during TEE monitoring. Once the pericardium is opened and the interatrial groove is dissected, the endoaortic balloon is progressively inflated with TEE guidance, carefully checking its position at the level of the sinotubular junction. Once the balloon is approximately three fourths inflated, the heart is arrested by means of rapid injection of 10 mL (0.25 mg/kg) of adenosine (Sanofi-Winthrop, Notre Dame de Bondeville, France). Immediately thereafter, the balloon is further inflated, and cold crystalloid antegrade cardioplegic solution is administered. While the endoaortic balloon is being inflated, the right radial pressure should remain the same at all times because any decrease in pressure might indicate a malpositioning of the balloon (partially) occluding the brachiocephalic artery. The volume of saline solution needed to inflate the balloon is dependent of the size of the ascending aorta. The balloon pressure is kept at approximately 350 mm Hg. During the remainder of the procedure, an additional dose of 300 mL of cold crystalloid antegrade cardioplegic solution is administered every 30 minutes. The aortic root pressure is continuously measured and is usually between 0 and 30 mm Hg in the absence of cardioplegia administration. Its value needs to be constant because a sudden increase of aortic root pressure indicates a nonocclusive balloon. The left atrium is opened, and the mitral valve is exposed with the left atrial blade. The operative field is flooded with carbon dioxide and cleared of blood by using the venting suction, which is positioned in the left inferior pulmonary vein.\n\nFirst, the annuloplasty stitches are placed, starting with the first stitch at the anterolateral commissure. Next, 2 annuloplasty stitches are placed on the anterior leaflet annulus just medial of the anterolateral commissural stitch. Now all remaining annular stitches are placed along the remaining annulus, starting at the anterolateral commissural stitch, over the posterior annulus toward the posteromedial commissure and then the medial portion of the anterior leaflet annulus. All annular stitches are exteriorized through the working port and fixed in suture guides. This maneuver exposes the mitral valve completely.\n\nNow the valve is analyzed according to the Carpentier guidelines.\n\n7\n\nCarpentier A\n\nCardiac valve surgery—the “French correction.”.\n\nPosterior leaflet mitral valve repair is performed by using the Carpentier techniques (Figure 2).\n\n7\n\nCarpentier A\n\nCardiac valve surgery—the “French correction.”.\n\nShafted instruments are introduced in the chest and the left atrium through the working port. The repair is performed with the exclusive aid of video assistance. Knots are thrown extracorporeally and tightened with a knot pusher. Anterior mitral leaflet prolapse is corrected with a small triangular resection\n\n8\n\nFasol R\n\nJoubert-Hubner E\n\nTriangular resection of the anterior leaflet for repair of the mitral valve.\n\nor with the creation of new polytetrafluoroethylene chords,\n\n9\n\nDavid TE\n\nOmran A\n\nArmstrong S\n\nSun Z\n\nIvanov J\n\nLong-term results of mitral valve repair for myxomatous disease with and without replacement with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sutures.\n\ndepending on the extent of the prolapsing area. Once the repair is completed (Figure 3), the left atrium is closed, leaving the venting suction in place for deairing. In addition, suction is applied to the tip of the endoaortic balloon, and the left lung is inflated before final closure of the left atrium. A bipolar ventricular pacing wire (Bipolar pacing lead; Medtronic France, Fourmiss, France) is placed before unclamping because it is otherwise almost impossible to place. The aorta is unclamped, and reperfusion is allowed. The valve repair is tested under TEE guidance just before termination of CPB. Careful hemostasis is performed after protamine hydrochloride (Roche, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France) administration, and 2 drains are left in situ: 1 intrapericardial and 1 intrathoracic. Both drains are exteriorized through an existing port. The pericardium is approximated, and the working port and groin are closed intracutaneously.\n\nFollow-up\n\nAll patients were seen at the outpatient clinic 2 months postoperatively, except patients who were operated on in October 2001. They were then sent back to their referring cardiologists, who saw their patients at 4 months and then usually yearly. Follow-up was performed between August and November 2001. All patients and their general practitioner, as well as the referring cardiologist, were contacted to obtain clinical information and echocardiographic follow-up data. The official guidelines were used to complete a follow-up questionnaire.\n\n10\n\nEdmunds LH\n\nClark RE\n\nCohn LH\n\nGrunkemeier GL\n\nMiller DC\n\nWeisel RD\n\nGuidelines for reporting morbidity and mortality after cardiac valvular operations.\n\nIn addition to this information, patients were asked about the amount of pain they experienced at the time of the operation; they were also questioned about how fast they had regained professional or expected activity postoperatively, whether they were pleased with the aesthetic result of the operation, and whether they would prefer this technique again if they were to choose between EndoCPB and standard median sternotomy. The mean patient follow-up was 19 ± 15.2 months (range, 0.2-54.1 months) and was 100% complete. A total of 284 patient-years was available for analysis. The New York Heart Association functional class in 184 survivors at follow-up was class I in 149 patients, class II in 30 patients, and class III in 5 patients. At follow-up, 156 patients were in normal sinus rhythm, 20 were in atrial fibrillation, and 8 had pacemaker rhythm.\n\nAssessment of repair and durability\n\nAll patients had immediate intraoperative postrepair TEE to assess the repair. Repair durability was primarily assessed by the incidence of reoperation. In addition, the latest echocardiographic follow-up was analyzed to detect the presence of mitral regurgitation. It was available in 178 of 180 patients who retained their native valves at the time of follow-up. The mean echocardiographic follow-up was 14.9 ± 14.7 months (range, 0.1-53.8 months).\n\nData analysis\n\nThe design of the study was retrospective, and data are expressed as means ± SD. Survival and event-free estimates were determined by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis\n\n11\n\nKaplan EL\n\nMeier P\n\nNonparametric estimation from incomplete observations.\n\nand expressed as proportions ± SE. Analysis was performed with the Statistica package, Release 5.1 (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla).\n\nRisk factors for outcome were evaluated by using the Cox proportional hazard models. The first event was used as the outcome. First analyses were performed by using only the risk factor of interest in the Cox univariate model. Because none of the risk factors showed a statistical significance of less or equal to 0.10, no further multivariate Cox regression model could be applied. The potential risk factors entered into the analysis of reoperation are listed in the appendix.\n\nEstimates of the linearized incidence rate with corresponding SEs were obtained by dividing the number of events by the corresponding patient-years of follow-up. The SE was calculated as the square root of the incidence divided by the patient-years of follow-up, assuming a Poisson distribution.\n\nDiscussion\n\n“Surgery is exposure” is a statement that many of us heard constantly during our surgical training. In minimally invasive cardiac surgery, exposure is still of paramount importance but is now created intrathoracically and visualized through video assistance. This requires a definite learning curve and a different surgical attitude from the surgeon and his or her assistant. In fact, both need to adopt the 4 major changes characterizing this technique: the use of the EndoCPB system and endo-clamp; the use of shafted instruments; video assistance as the surgeon's eye; and TEE for supervision of the entire procedure. Indeed, every step of the procedure, from catheter insertion to the final surgical result, is controlled by TEE. Previously, our group and others have stressed the usefulness and necessity of preoperative TEE guidance by an experienced person.\n\n12\n\nCoddens J\n\nDeloof T\n\nHendrickx J\n\nVanermen H\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography for Port-Access surgery.\n\n,\n\n13\n\nFalk V\n\nWalther T\n\nDiegeler A\n\nWendler A\n\nAutschbach R\n\nvan Son JAM\n\net al.\n\nEchocardiographic monitoring of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery using an endoaortic clamp.\n\n,\n\n14\n\nSiegel LC\n\nSt Goar FG\n\nStevens JH\n\nPompili MF\n\nBurdon TA\n\nReitz BA\n\net al.\n\nMonitoring considerations for Port-Access cardiac surgery.\n\n,\n\n15\n\nApplebaum RM\n\nCutler WM\n\nBhardwaj J\n\nColvin SB\n\nGalloway AC\n\nRibakove GH\n\net al.\n\nUtility of transesophageal echocardiography during Port-Access minimally invasive cardiac surgery.\n\n,\n\n16\n\nMohr FW\n\nOnnasch JF\n\nFalk V\n\nWalther T\n\nDiegeler A\n\nKrakor R\n\net al.\n\nThe evolution of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery—2 year experience.\n\nThe present series, which includes our initial experience and thus our learning curve, demonstrates that the procedure can be safely performed with good results.

The femoral artery therefore needs to be able to fit this cannula and provide adequate flow, a condition that was not fulfilled in one of our patients. To date, we have been unable to correlate inadequate femoral size to another parameter, such as body surface area. However, in addition to severe peripheral vascular disease, a small femoral artery is clearly a contraindication for the use of the EndoCPB system. Other contraindications include excavated pectus (this condition substantially reduces the anteroposterior diameter of the chest and displaces the heart to the left, both of which preclude direct access to the left atrium), aortic regurgitation of greater than grade 1 (precluding the use of antegrade cardioplegia administration), severely atherosclerotic ascending or descending aorta (which dramatically increases the stroke risk with endovascular manipulation), and dense adhesions in the right hemithorax.\n\nAlthough others demonstrated a lower blood transfusion ratio in minimally invasive procedures versus standard sternotomy,\n\n23\n\nCohn LH\n\nAdams DH\n\nCouper GS\n\nBichell DP\n\nRosborough DM\n\nSears SP\n\net al.\n\nMinimally invasive cardiac valve surgery improves patient satisfaction while reducing costs of cardiac valve replacement and repair.\n\n,\n\n24\n\nGlower DD\n\nLandolfo KP\n\nClements F\n\nDebruijn NP\n\nStafford-Smith M\n\nSmith PK\n\net al.\n\nMitral valve operation via Port Access versus median sternotomy.\n\n,\n\n25\n\nGrossi EA\n\nGalloway AC\n\nRibakove GH\n\nZakow PK\n\nDerivaux CC\n\nBaumann FG\n\net al.\n\nImpact of minimally invasive valvular heart surgery: a case-control study.\n\nour high reintervention rate, median chest tube output, and transfusion rate do not seem to be so favorable. Introducing this technique in 1997, we were extremely cautious and anticipated a markedly reduced blood loss because of reduced tissue trauma. Therefore, we aggressively took patients back by using the same operative approach but found an active bleeding source in only half of the patients. In all other cases, the right hemithorax was rinsed, and cloths were evacuated. Also, all chest tubes remained in place for 48 hours, even when bleeding had stopped after a few hours postoperatively and chest tube output was just serous fluid. This of course also negatively influenced the total amount of chest tube drainage. On the other hand, we do have a very liberal use of blood products, which is reflected in the low transfusion-free proportion of the study population. In addition, quite a high proportion (19.3%) required correction of coagulation parameters, presumably related to the relatively long pump run. Nevertheless, we changed a few things during the study period to reduce excessive bleeding: the pericardial fat is now resected only if it avoids direct approach to the left atrium, and the pacemaker wire is now always placed on the inferior side of the left ventricle, where the thicker muscle avoids a muscle tear caused by the pacemaker wire.\n\nOne might argue that the presented surgical technique is not a totally endoscopic procedure because a working port is made. This 4- to 6-cm incision could be used by the surgeon to directly look inside the chest. This working port, however, is only made to permit instrument handling and introduction of an annuloplasty ring. We only use the soft tissue retractor and never spread the ribs, as is done by some other groups.\n\n25\n\nGrossi EA\n\nGalloway AC\n\nRibakove GH\n\nZakow PK\n\nDerivaux CC\n\nBaumann FG\n\net al.\n\nImpact of minimally invasive valvular heart surgery: a case-control study.\n\n,\n\n26\n\nChitwood WR\n\nWixon CL\n\nElbeery JR\n\nMoran JF\n\nChapmann WHH\n\nLust RM\n\nVideo-assisted minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.\n\nThe soft tissue retractor is used to minimize postoperative pain but, at the same time, forces the surgeon to look at the screen, thereby totally relying on video assistance for the entire procedure. We therefore consider the procedure totally endoscopic.\n\nThe freedom from mitral valve reoperation in the present series was 93.3% ± 2.5% at 4 years (Figure 4). This is lower than previously reported in other series of degenerative valve disease, where the same percentage of freedom from mitral valve reoperation is reached at approximately 10 years.\n\n17\n\nGillinov AM\n\nCosgrove DM\n\nBlackstone EH\n\nDiaz R\n\nArnold JH\n\nLytle BW\n\net al.\n\nDurability of mitral valve repair for degenerative disease.\n\n,\n\n18\n\nDeloche A\n\nJebara VA\n\nRelland JYM\n\nChauvaud S\n\nFabiani JN\n\nPerier P\n\net al.\n\nValve repair with Carpentier techniques—the second decade.\n\nHowever, only 3 of the 7 reoperations were due to failed mitral valve repair. The 4 others were due to endocarditis. In fact, the linearized incidence rate for endocarditis was 1.4% ± 0.04%, which is rather high. We do not know why the incidence of endocarditis in the present series was so high, but it definitely influenced our reoperation rate negatively.\n\nPatient satisfaction in the present series was very high. More than 98% of the patients were extremely pleased with the cosmetic result of the procedure. Forty-two percent even stated they could hardly see the scar any more. Also, procedure-related pain was very favorably assessed in greater than 93% of the patient cohort, and no patients reported excessive postoperative pain. Other authors also reported favorable postprocedural pain perceptions, both with the current technique\n\n27\n\nWalther T\n\nFalk V\n\nMetz S\n\nDiegeler A\n\nBattelini R\n\nAutschbach R\n\net al.\n\nPain and quality of life after minimally invasive versus conventional cardiac surgery.\n\nand after other minimally invasive mitral valve surgical techniques.\n\n26\n\nChitwood WR\n\nWixon CL\n\nElbeery JR\n\nMoran JF\n\nChapmann WHH\n\nLust RM\n\nVideo-assisted minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.\n\n,\n\n28\n\nAklog L\n\nAdams DH\n\nCouper GS\n\nGobezie R\n\nSears S\n\nCohn LH\n\nTechniques and results of direct-access minimally invasive mitral valve surgery: a paradigm for the future.\n\nIn addition, almost 34% of the patients were fully recovered within 4 weeks.

Almost 93% of the patients would prefer the same operative technique if they were to start all over again.\n\nFinally, one might consider endoscopic mitral valve repair by using video assistance, a transition phase toward robotic mitral valve surgery.\n\n29\n\nFelger JE\n\nChitwood WR\n\nNifong LW\n\nHolbert D\n\nEvolution of mitral valve surgery: toward a totally endoscopic approach.\n\nAlthough mitral valve repair without the use of a working port has recently been reported,\n\n30\n\nMehmanesh H\n\nHenze R\n\nLange R\n\nTotally endoscopic mitral valve repair.\n\nwe do not feel the need for such a device in mitral valve surgery. Using the current technique, we are able to repair complex cases and have never felt the absence of voice-controlled devices or extra robot-controlled surgical tools to be a shortcoming.\n\nIn conclusion, the present series demonstrates the feasibility, reproducibility, and medium-term durability of the EndoCPB technique for mitral valve repair. The technique provides ample patient satisfaction and is currently our technique of choice for isolated atrioventricular valve disease.\n\nThe major limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. Although the general cardiac surgery data are prospectively collected in our database, the more specific procedure-related data were retrospectively collected. However, we hardly encountered missing data, presumably because of our high interest in this procedure.\n\nThe retrospective nature of the study might have positively influenced the procedure-related pain sensation because patients were asked about procedure-related pain at the time of follow-up. Because the majority of the patients were very satisfied with the procedure and the cosmetic result, periprocedural pain sensation might have been judged more positively than would have been the case if patients were interviewed immediately postoperatively. This is not the case for the postoperative recovery period because this was checked with specific dates or events for every patient.\n\nA prospective randomized trial would be the best approach to truly evaluate the (positive) effect of this operative technique versus a standard median sternotomy approach. However, this is impossible to realize in our center because patients are specifically referred for the endoscopic technique and therefore unwilling to participate in a randomized trial."
