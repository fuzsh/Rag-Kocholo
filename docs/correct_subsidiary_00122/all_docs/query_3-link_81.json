        "text": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a giant healthcare company focusing on pharmaceuticals and medical technology. It makes money mainly from pharmaceuticals representing the majority of revenues and profits, especially oncology and immunology drugs. It used to have also a consumer health segment, but it was spun off in 2023. Let‚Äôs look at who owns Johnson & Johnson and who controls it.\n\nJohnson & Johnson‚Äôs largest shareholders are asset manager giant Vanguard, which owns a 9.4% share, followed by asset manager giant BlackRock (7.6%) and asset manager State Street (5.5%). No other shareholder owns more than 5% of the company.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's Largest Shareholders (Dec 2022) Shareholder Ownership Voting Power Vanguard 9.4% 9.4% BlackRock 7.6% 7.6% State Street 5.5% 5.5% Other 77.5% 77.5%\n\nListed are shareholders holding >5% of any share class or notable in other ways Source: Multiple SEC filings\n\nIn this article, I will dive more into who owns Johnson & Johnson and who controls it. I will show you who Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs largest shareholders are, how many shares and votes they have, and how much their stake is worth.\n\nIf you are interested, you can also explore who owns other companies like Eli Lilly, Amazon, UnitedHealth, and other articles in my ‚ÄúWho Owns Who‚Äù series.\n\nüìÉ Who Owns Johnson & Johnson?\n\nJohnson & Johnson is owned mainly by asset managers. The largest ones are asset manager giant Vanguard, which owns 9.4% of the company, followed by asset manager giant BlackRock with a 7.6% ownership share, and State Street with 5.5% ownership.\n\nNo shareholder has dominant ownership in the company, and the company has no single sizable owner except asset managers.\n\nJohnson & Johnson‚Äôs ownership is dispersed, and the largest owners are asset managers who are not ultimate owners but invest money on behalf of their clients.\n\nVanguard and BlackRock are the largest asset managers worldwide, and it is common to see them among top shareholders in large public companies with dispersed ownership. Their portfolio is so huge that even if they spread it out across thousands of companies, they still belong to the main shareholders in many of them.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was founded in 1886 by brothers Robert Wood Johnson, James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson. It has been a publicly listed company since its initial public offering on NYSE in 1944 (Ticker: JNJ).\n\nAfter the company went public, the founding family lost control.\n\nSon of the founder Robert Wood Johnson II was the last family member heading the company. Philip B. Hofmann replaced him as CEO and chairman in 1963.\n\nJohnson family still belongs to the wealthiest families in the US but is no longer connected with Johnson & Johson company.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is incorporated in the State of New Jersey (US), and its headquarters are in New Brunswick, New Jersey (US).\n\nUntil recently, Johnson & Johnson was active in three segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceuticals, and MedTech. In 2023 the company spun off its Consumer Health business into a separate company called Kenvue, which is traded on NYSE under the trading ticker KVUE. Therefore, many brands that originally belonged to J&J, including ‚ÄúJohnson‚Äôs‚Äù brand, are no longer made and sold by J&J company.\n\nüéÆ Who Controls Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)?\n\nJohnson & Johnson‚Äôs shareholders with the largest voting power are asset manager giant Vanguard, which holds 9.4% of all votes, followed by asset manager giant BlackRock with 7.6% voting power, and asset manager State Street (5.5%).\n\nJohnson & Johnson has only one class of outstanding shares, with one vote per share. Therefore, there is no difference between the shareholder‚Äôs ownership and voting power.\n\nThe ownership of Johnson & Johnson is quite dispersed, and the main shareholders are asset managers investing money on behalf of their clients.\n\nNone of them control the company individually, but together they have a big influence.\n\nThey are not ultimate owners of those shares but have significant voting power over a large part of the shares they hold.\n\nVoting power gives asset managers the influence to endorse or oppose resolutions and shape the company‚Äôs governance practices and decisions.\n\nJohnson & Johnson‚Äôs dispersed ownership structure dominated by asset managers creates conflicts of interest between Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs management, asset manager‚Äôs management, and the ultimate underlying investors that asset managers represent. In situations like these, insiders of the company hold significant power over it.\n\nJohnson & Johnson‚Äôs insiders that have influence over the company are CEO and chairman Joaquin Duato and other board members and executives.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has a 12-member board of directors reelected annually.\n\nNobody from the board of directors or executive officers holds more than 0.05% of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs shares. Despite that, the lack of other large shareholders, except asset managers, gives the CEO a large influence.\n\nüó≥Ô∏è Breakdown of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs Outstanding Shares and Votes by Top Shareholders\n\nJohnson & Johnson had a total of 2,614 million outstanding shares as of December 2022. The following table shows how many shares each Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs large shareholder holds.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's Outstanding Shares by Shareholder In millions of shares as of December 2022 Shareholder Class A Total % Share Vanguard 247 247 9.4% BlackRock 199 199 7.6% State Street 142 142 5.5% Other 2,026 2,026 77.5% Total (# millions) 2,614 2,614 100.0%\n\nListed are shareholders holding >5% of any share class or notable in other ways Source: Multiple SEC filings\n\nThere were 2,614 million votes distributed among shareholders of Johnson & Johnson. The table below shows the total number of votes for each large shareholder.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's Vote Control by Shareholder In millions of votes as of December 2022 Shareholder Class A Total % Share Vanguard 247 247 9.4% BlackRock 199 199 7.6% State Street 142 142 5.5% Other 2,026 2,026 77.5% Total (# millions) 2,614 2,614 100.0%\n\nListed are shareholders holding >5% of any share class or notable in other ways Source: Multiple SEC filings\n\nüíµ Breakdown of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs Market Value by Shareholder\n\nThe following table summarizes how much is each shareholder‚Äôs stake in Johnson & Johnson worth.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that a stake in Johnson & Johnson could be just one part of their portfolio, and their total worth could be bigger, thanks to other investments. It could also be lower if they have debts.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's Market Value by Shareholder Market value in billions $ as of December 2022 Shareholder Class A Total % Share Vanguard $43.6 $43.6 9.4% BlackRock $35.1 $35.1 7.6% State Street $25.2 $25.2 5.5% Other $357.8 $357.8 77.5% Total ($ billions) $461.7 $461.7 100.0%\n\nListed are shareholders holding >5% of any share class or notable in other ways Source: Multiple SEC filings\n\nLet‚Äôs now look at each Johnson & Johnson shareholder individually.\n\nüìí Who Are Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs Largest Shareholders?\n\nLet‚Äôs now go through the list of the largest shareholders of Johnson & Johnson one by one and look at who they are, how many shares they own, what is their voting power, and how much is their stake in Johnson & Johnson worth.\n\n#1 Vanguard (9.4%)\n\nVanguard is the largest shareholder of Johnson & Johnson, owning 9.4% of its shares. As of December 2022, the market value of Vanguard‚Äôs stake in Johnson & Johnson was $43.6 billion.\n\nVanguard owned 247 million shares in Johnson & Johnson and controlled 247 million shareholder votes as of December 2022.\n\nVanguard (The Vanguard Group) is one of the largest asset managers in the world. It manages other people‚Äôs money through its mutual funds and exchange-traded funds and also offers other related investing and financial planning services.\n\nVanguard differs from other large asset managers by having no actual ‚Äúowner .‚Äù Officially Vanguard says that its investors own it since its funds own it, and Vanguard fund investors own those funds.\n\nHowever, the actual decision power is in the hands of Vanguard‚Äôs insiders since the ownership is diluted over millions of investors worldwide.\n\nVanguard has significant influence over the largest public companies. Thanks to its size, Vanguard usually belongs to the largest shareholders in those companies and has considerable power at their shareholder meetings. This is especially true if ownership is diluted.\n\nSeveral terms were coined to describe this issue. Some call it asset manager capitalism, and popular is also the power of twelve. Financial Times even put together who exactly those twelve people might be.\n\nEvidence shows that big asset managers usually vote together with management.\n\n#2 BlackRock (7.6%)\n\nBlackRock is the second-largest shareholder of Johnson & Johnson, owning 7.6% of its shares. As of December 2022, the market value of BlackRock‚Äôs stake in Johnson & Johnson was $35.1 billion.\n\nBlackRock owned 199 million shares in Johnson & Johnson and controlled 199 million shareholder votes as of December 2022.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. is the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, with assets under management of $10 trillion. BlackRock is not only an asset manager, but it also provides other asset managers and corporations with its Aladdin portfolio management software.\n\nBlackRock is a publicly traded company, and its largest shareholders are its competitors, including BlackRock itself. Not directly but through their passive and active funds. The largest shareholder is Vanguard.\n\nA similar situation is also true in the opposite direction because BlackRock is a significant shareholder in many of its publicly traded competitors and other large institutions, making the whole thing even more eyebrow-raising.\n\nThis circular ownership between Vanguard, BlackRock, and other large asset managers, amplifies the issue often raised about the power of these large asset managers over public companies since they usually belong to the most significant shareholders with large voting power.\n\nIn the case of Blackrock, this influence is personified in the form of its CEO Larry Fink, who is a powerful figure with close ties to the FED and the US government.\n\nAdding to these concerns is evidence that BlackRock and other asset managers usually vote in favor of management proposals.\n\n#3 State Street (5.5%)\n\nState Street is the third-largest shareholder of Johnson & Johnson, owning 5.5% of its shares. As of December 2022, the market value of State Street‚Äôs stake in Johnson & Johnson was $25.2 billion.\n\nState Street owned 142 million shares in Johnson & Johnson and controlled 142 million shareholder votes as of December 2022.\n\nState Street Corporation is one of the largest asset managers in the world, with 4 trillion assets under management. It makes money mainly from servicing and management fees.\n\nIn 1993 company introduced the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (traded under ticker SPY). It was the first exchange-traded fund, and State Street is now one of the largest ETF providers in the world.\n\nState Street is a publicly traded company, and its largest shareholders are, ironically, its competitors, Vanguard and Blackrock. One of its largest shareholders is even State Street itself. Not directly but through their passive and active funds.\n\nThis circular ownership between State Street, Vanguard, BlackRock, and other large asset managers, amplifies the issue often raised about the power of these large asset managers over public companies where they usually belong to the most significant shareholders.\n\nüß± Who and When Founded Johnson & Johnson?\n\nJohnson & Johnson was founded in 1886 by three brothers, Robert Wood Johnson, James Wood Johnson, and Edward Mead Johnson. Today, Johnson & Johnson is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world, with a global network of subsidiaries.\n\nJohnson & Johnson, one of the world‚Äôs leading healthcare conglomerates, has a rich and fascinating history that spans over a century.\n\nIt was in 1861 when Robert Wood Johnson embarked on his pharmaceutical journey as an apprentice at Wood & Tittamer‚Äôs pharmacy in Poughkeepsie, guided by his uncle, James Wood. Little did he know that this apprenticeship would sow the seeds of an extraordinary legacy.\n\nBy 1864, Johnson found himself in the bustling city of New York, working as a drug product salesman. Fate intervened when he crossed paths with George Seabury, a man who would play a crucial role in his future endeavors. Their collaboration led to the co-founding of Seabury & Johnson in 1873, a venture dedicated to the production of medicated plasters.\n\nThe company prospered, drawing the involvement of Johnson‚Äôs brothers. Yet, disagreements arose between the founders, and Johnson sold his stake in Seabury & Johnson in 1885.\n\nIn 1886, alongside his brothers James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson, Robert Wood Johnson laid the foundation of a new enterprise that would later dominate the healthcare industry, Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe early years of Johnson & Johnson witnessed remarkable achievements. From manufacturing sterile surgical supplies to household products and medical guides. They introduced the world to the first sterile surgical products, including sutures, absorbent cotton, and gauze.\n\nIn 1910 when Robert Wood Johnson, the visionary founder, passed away, the reins of the company were passed to his brother, James Wood Johnson.\n\nOver the years, the baton of leadership passed from one generation to another, with Robert Wood Johnson II, son of the founder, assuming the role of president in 1932 and chairman in 1938.\n\nThe year 1944 witnessed a significant turning point in the history of Johnson & Johnson. With their initial public offering, the company‚Äôs destiny and the destiny of the Johson family started to diverge.\n\nIn 1963, Philip B. Hofmann took the helm as Chairman and CEO, becoming the first non-Johnson family member to assume the esteemed position.\n\nDespite the family‚Äôs departure from involvement in the company, the Johnson family still belongs among the most wealthy families in the US.\n\nFor example, Woody and Christopher Johnson, the great-grandsons of the founder, now hold ownership of the New York Jets.\n\nüìÖ Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs History Timeline\n\nThese are selected events from Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs history:\n\n1860s\n\n1861: Robert Wood Johnson begins his pharmaceutical apprenticeship at Wood & Tittamer‚Äôs pharmacy in Poughkeepsie.
