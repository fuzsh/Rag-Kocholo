It retained a minority stake in Kenvue, which it intends to monetize over time.\n\nHere's a look at some of the most notable companies Johnson & Johnson has acquired over the years to build its leading Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses.\n\n1 - 5\n\n1. Ethicon\n\nJohnson & Johnson acquired the company that is now known as Ethicon in 1947. The company makes surgical sutures and wound closure devices. Johnson & Johnson has acquired and merged several other companies into Ethicon over the years, including Mentor Corporation (2008), Acclarent (2009), SterilMed (2011), Verb Surgical (2019), and Auris Health (2019).\n\n2. Janssen Pharmaceutica\n\nJohnson & Johnson bought Belgian research and drug company Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961. As it is now known, Janssen Pharmaceuticals formed the bedrock of the company's innovative medicine division. Johnson & Johnson used Janssen to acquire other research companies and drugmakers over the years. Janssen is now Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, which holds its diverse and growing portfolio of therapeutics.\n\n3. DePuy\n\nJohnson & Johnson bought DePuy in 1998 for $3.5 billion. It was one of the world's first orthopedics companies, inventing the first hip and knee replacement implants. Johnson & Johnson combined DePuy with Synthens in 2012 to create the world's largest orthopedic and neurological business.\n\n4. Biosense\n\nJohnson & Johnson bought Biosense in 1997 for $400 million. It would go on to combine that company with its Cordis Webster subsidiary (a company it bought in 1996 for $1.8 billion) to create Biosense Webster, a global market leader in treating cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n5. Centocor Biotech\n\nJohnson & Johnson bought Centocor Biotech for $4.9 billion in 1999 and renamed it Janssen Biotech. Centocor was one of the country's first biotechnology companies. The deal opened the door to a new frontier in medicine for the company. Centocor developed Remicade, a treatment for Crohn's disease, which has become one of the best-selling biotech medications ever developed.\n\n6 - 10\n\n6. Synthes\n\nThe company acquired Synthes for $21.3 billion in 2012. The leading manufacturer of orthopedic devices expanded Johnson & Johnson's medical devices and diagnostic segment. It combined Synthes with its subsidiary, DePuy Companies, to create a larger-scale and more innovative orthopedics business.\n\n7. Actelion\n\nJohnson & Johnson acquired Actelion for $30 billion in cash in 2017. The company combined it with Janssen Pharmaceuticals to expand Janssen's portfolio and late-stage pipeline. Actelion developed therapies to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, including Opsumit, Uptravi, and Tracleer.\n\n8. Abbott Medical Optics\n\nJohnson & Johnson acquired Abbot Medical Optics from Abbott Laboratories (ABT 1.66%) for $4.3 billion in 2017. The company renamed it Johnson & Johnson Vision, combining the surgical ophthalmic portfolio with its ACUVUE contact lens business.\n\n9. Momenta Pharmaceuticals\n\nThe company bought Momenta Pharmaceuticals for $6.5 billion in 2020. The transaction expanded Johnson & Johnson's leadership in novel treatments for autoimmune diseases. Momenta developed a pipeline of potential therapeutics led by nipocalimab.\n\n10. Abiomed\n\nThe healthcare giant bought Abiomed in 2022 for $16.6 billion. The company was a leader in heart, lung, and kidney support technologies. It helped broaden and strengthen Johnson & Johnson's MedTech product portfolio. Abiomed developed the breakthrough Impella heart pump to treat patients with severe coronary artery disease.\n\nPotential future acquisitions\n\nWhat companies could Johnson & Johnson buy in the future?\n\nJohnson & Johnson has had a voracious appetite for acquisitions over the years. It has seemed to get hungrier for deals after spinning off its consumer health products business (Kenvue). It has made a couple of deals since then:\n\nLaminar: It paid $400 million for the medical device company focused on arterial fibrillation in 2023. It joined its MedTech segment as part of Biosense Webster.\n\nAmbryx Biopharma: It bought the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company in 2024 for $2 billion. It enhanced the company's pipeline of next-generation antibody drug conjugates to treat cancer.\n\nThe company will likely continue to make acquisitions. It has ample financial flexibility to fund new deals thanks to its fortress-like balance sheet. Johnson & Johnson entered 2024 with $23 billion of cash and securities on its balance sheet against only $29 billion in debt. That supports its pristine AAA bond rating.\n\nThe company also generates significant free cash flow ($18 billion in 2023), which gives it money to return to shareholders ($11.8 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases in 2023) while building up its cash balance to help fund future acquisitions. The company also still had a minority stake in Kenvue, which it can monetize to fund future deals.\n\nOne of the company's big focuses in recent years has been strengthening its fast-growing MedTech business (e.g., acquiring Abiomed and Laminar). The company's management team has repeatedly said that they have an aggressive mergers and acquisitions strategy and a voracious appetite for deals, particularly in the MedTech space.\n\nThe company has a range of options, from mega deals to smaller purchases. Buying Boston Scientific (BSX 0.92%) is a potential blockbuster deal. Analysts have floated the medical technology company as a possible acquisition target of Johnson & Johnson because it would be a good strategic fit. There isn't much overlap between the two companies, so it would enhance Johnson & Johnson's business mix and revenue growth. However, with a $100 billion market cap, Boston Scientific would be a massive deal, even for the $400 billion healthcare behemoth.\n\nIf the company wants to pursue a different megadeal to bolster its MedTech business, it could also consider Medtronic (MDT -0.23%), Stryker (SYK 0.42%), or Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.34%). Meanwhile, it could consider a smaller medical technology company if those $100 billion-plus price tags are too much. There are countless options, including InMode (INMD 0.34%), which markets surgical devices that use radio frequency technology, and Outset Medical (NASDA:OM), which markets hemodialysis systems.\n\nAnother acquisition pathway for Johnson & Johnson is bolstering its innovative medicine business. Many analysts believe the biotechnology sector is ripe for more mergers and acquisitions. There were several deals in early 2024, including Johnson & Johnson's $2 billion acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, which likely won't be its last acquisition in the space.\n\nAnalysts have floated a lot of potential takeover targets for big pharma companies. One likely hot commodity is Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VXTX), which is developing a promising weight-loss drug. Another potential option is cancer drug developer Immunocore (IMCR -1.26%).\n\nJohnson & Johnson could also seek to turn some of its minority investments into wholly-owned companies. The company has several investments in smaller biotech and medical device companies, including Legend Biotech (LEGN 0.32%), CVRx (CVRX 4.92%), and Protagonist Therapeutics (PTGX 1.55%). Buying companies it's already familiar with would potentially be less risky than acquiring an unfamiliar company."
