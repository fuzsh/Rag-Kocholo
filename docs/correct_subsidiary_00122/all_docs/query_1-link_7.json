        "meta_description": "Heartport was the darling of investors when it burst on the scene in 1996 with a new minimally-invasive cardiac surgery technology. The company's stratospheric IPO valuation quickly deflated as cardiac surgeons, proving more cautious than investors, have been slow in adopting Heartport's technique. Armed with new management and a new strategy, Heartport is regrouping, still convinced, in the face of major competitors using a different approach, that its technology represents the future of minimally-invasive cardiac surgery.",
