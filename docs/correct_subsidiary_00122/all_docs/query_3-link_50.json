        "text": "Johnson & Johnson is a global community of people blending heart, science, and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\n\nAnchored in Our Credo, we are called to put the well-being of the people we serve first. At Johnson & Johnson Vision, we embrace that responsibility—that opportunity Vision Made PossibleTM.\n\nEstablished in 2002, Sight For Kids is the largest-known, school-based eye health program in the world. Reaching over 3 million children annually, Sight For Kids mobilizes eye care professionals and volunteers to provide comprehensive eye health services to students in low-income schools across Africa, Asia, and North America. The program also trains teachers to deliver eye health education, perform a visual acuity test, and screen their students for common eye conditions.\n\nFor the past 20 years, Sight For Kids has equipped communities around the world to provide children with clear and healthy vision. The program has engaged more than 200,000 teachers, visually screened over 48 million students, helped 640,000 students receive additional treatments and surgeries from eye care professionals, while also providing more than 500,000 pairs of eyeglasses to children.1\n\nDedicated to changing the arc of global blindness, HCP Cureblindess envisions a future in which everyone has access to high-quality, cost-effective eye care and no person is needlessly blind. They work to make this future a reality by taking a hands-on approach and cultivating the growth of local, sustainable eye care systems for under-resourced communities around the world.\n\nSince 1995, HCP Cureblindess has established five dedicated eye hospitals and training institutes, trained over 19,000 eye care professionals, screened and provided basic eye exams to 13.3 million people globally, and performed more than 1.19 million sight-restoring surgeries. Today, they work with an extensive network of partners to bring life-changing vision care solutions to more than 20 countries across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa—helping to ensure needless blindness becomes one public health problem we can overcome.2\n\nTo forge this lasting impact—and a world where access to eye care is equitable for all—our teams should be as diverse as our communities. Each Johnson & Johnson Vision employee brings a unique set of experiences, cultural background, and thinking style that creates a richness in our company and for our customers. We foster a culture of inclusion for our teams to learn, grow, and feel confident bringing their whole selves to work.\n\nBy empowering our employees to combine their time and talent to make a positive impact on the world, we’re not only building the healthiest communities—we’re amplifying our talent.\n\nLed by Johnson & Johnson, we offer a wide range of volunteer opportunities for employees.\n\nCreated in 2015, the Johnson & Johnson WiSTEM2D (Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, Manufacturing and Design) program is one such opportunity. This program has been a driving force in providing women and girls with tools and platforms to change the world.\n\nAs part of the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies, our employees engage in this important effort in many ways—including the WiSTEM2D University Series. Aiming to inspire women at pivotal moments in their university years to choose and stick with STEM2D majors and careers, female STEM2D professionals at Johnson & Johnson Vision share what it’s like to work in STEM2D, provide advice for women pursuing related majors, and much more!\n\nOver the past ten years, we’ve significantly reduced our carbon footprint and are on track to help Johnson & Johnson meet its carbon neutrality goal by 2030.3 Additionally, as of 2022, all ACUVUE® contact lenses are made using 100% renewable energy, helping the business achieve it global climate goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity needs from renewable sources three years early!4\n\nWe also constantly innovate how we produce, transport, and responsibly dispose of our products to reduce waste. In Europe, we’ve removed plastic pouches for ACUVUE® delivery notices on customer orders, saving 10 tons of plastic annually.5 Our partnership with TerraCycle® in the United Kingdom (U.K.) has also seen 8.5 million contact lenses, blister packs, and foils recycled as part of the ACUVUE® Contact Lens Recycling Programme.6\n\nFrom reducing water usage at our manufacturing sites, to reducing the plastic content in our packaging by up to 40%—we’re striving to limit our use of natural resources as we work to find new solutions to better protect the environment.7 That’s also why we installed a 3-megawatt wind turbine at our Limerick, Ireland facility, which generates 4 gigawatt-hours of energy per year—enough to power ~550 homes!*,8It’s just a few of the ways we’re doing our part to help create a healthier planet for all."
