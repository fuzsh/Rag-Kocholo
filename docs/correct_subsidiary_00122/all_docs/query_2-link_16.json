This is in addition to the dealer's obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as an underwriter and with respect to unsold allotments or subscriptions.\n\n5 PROSPECTUS SUMMARY The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including \"Risk Factors\" and the financial statements and the notes to those statements, appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this prospectus assumes that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, assumes the conversion of all of our preferred stock into common stock upon completion of this offering and assumes the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation immediately following the closing of this offering. INTUITIVE SURGICAL We design and manufacture the da Vinci Surgical System, an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a fundamentally new generation of surgery. We believe this new generation of surgery, Intuitive surgery, represents an advance similar in magnitude to the previous two generations of surgery -- open surgery and minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. Our da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon's natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micromovements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. Our products provide the surgeon with the range of motion and fine tissue control previously possible only with open surgery, while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work through small ports. To date, surgeons have performed over 600 surgical procedures using our da Vinci Surgical System. Although open surgery is still the predominant form of surgery, the large incisions required create significant trauma to the patient, often contributing to long hospitalization and recovery times, high hospitalization costs, as well as significant pain and suffering. Over the past several decades, physicians have made progress in reducing surgery-related trauma by developing MIS techniques. These techniques allow surgery to be performed through ports rather than large incisions, resulting in shorter recovery times and reduced hospitalization costs. MIS techniques have been widely adopted in certain surgical procedures, such as gall bladder removal, but have not been widely adopted for most complex surgical procedures. We believe surgeons have been slow to adopt MIS for many surgical procedures because of the inherent drawbacks with existing MIS tools and techniques, which include \"backward\" instrument movements, restricted range of motion, magnified hand tremor, lack of precision, difficulty in performing fine tissue manipulations, exaggerated instrument movements and poor visualization. Intuitive surgery overcomes many of the limitations of existing MIS surgery by using a broad technology platform consisting of computer hardware, software, algorithms, mechanics and optics to perform fine tissue manipulation through ports, in many parts of the body. Using our da Vinci Surgical System, the surgeon operates while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3-D image of the surgical field. The surgeon's fingers grasp the instrument controls below the display with wrists naturally positioned relative to his or her eyes. Our technology seamlessly translates the surgeon's movements into precise, real-time movements of our surgical instruments inside the patient. The key advantages of Intuitive surgery over conventional MIS techniques include the following: - natural instrument movements that directly transform the surgeon's hand, wrist and finger movements outside the patient's body into corresponding instrument micromovements inside the body; - a full range of motion for surgical instruments, previously available only in open surgery; - reduced hand tremor and finer instrument movements as a result of computer enhancements of the surgeon's hand, wrist and finger movements; 1\n\n6 - the look and feel of open surgery enabled by our 3-D InSite vision system; - ease of use enabling surgeons to learn to use our products with a limited amount of training; - the capability to perform complex surgical procedures; and - broad applicability to multiple surgical procedures through a single surgical platform. Our products include our da Vinci Surgical System and a variety of \"smart disposable\" EndoWrist instruments that incorporate our flexible \"wrist\" joint technology. Our product revenues are generated primarily from the direct sale of (1) the da Vinci Surgical System, consisting of a surgeon's console, a patient-side cart that holds electromechanical arms, and our 3-D InSite vision system and (2) our EndoWrist instruments, which include scissors, forceps, scalpels and a variety of other tools. Our instruments are resterilizable and the number of procedures or hours that each can perform is controlled by a custom computer chip. Because we have designed our EndoWrist instruments to expire after their recommended useful lives, we expect continuing sales of our EndoWrist instruments to generate recurring revenues. This year, we expect the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to approve use of the da Vinci Surgical System in laparoscopic surgical procedures, although we cannot assure investors as to when, or if, we will receive this approval. We believe that receiving this approval would make us the only company to have received FDA approval for a third generation surgical product. Laparoscopic surgery is surgery in the abdominal and pelvic areas of the body using an endoscope.

You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. If any of these additional risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO INTUITIVE SURGICAL OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE BELOW SECURITIES ANALYSTS' OR INVESTORS' EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. Because of our limited operating history, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business. The revenue and income potential of our market are unproven, and we may be unable to generate significant commercial revenues. In addition, our costs may be higher than we, securities analysts or investors expect. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations will suffer, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Further, future revenue from sales of our products, if any, will be difficult to forecast because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving. Our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including: - the progress and results of clinical trials; - actions relating to regulatory matters; - the extent to which our products gain market acceptance; - our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities; - demand for our products; - the progress of surgical training in the use of our products; - our ability to develop, introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis; - product quality problems; - our ability to protect our proprietary rights; - our ability to license additional intellectual property rights; and - third-party payor reimbursement policies. Our operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable indication of our future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock, and the value of your investment, will likely decline. 5\n\n10 WE HAVE A LARGE ACCUMULATED DEFICIT, WE EXPECT FUTURE LOSSES, AND WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY. We have incurred substantial losses since inception and we expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next two years, primarily as a result of expected increases in expenses for our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities, research and development activities, clinical trials and regulatory approval applications. The extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain, and we may never achieve profitable operations. If the time required to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability is longer than anticipated, we may not be able to continue our operations. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $18.4 million and was $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000. As of March 31, 2000, we had an accumulated deficit of $80.2 million. WE EXPERIENCE LONG AND VARIABLE SALES CYCLES, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY GIVEN QUARTER. Our da Vinci Surgical System has a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions. We do not plan to maintain an inventory of assembled da Vinci Surgical Systems, but rather plan to manufacture our products only after receiving customer orders. These factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low. Because of these fluctuations, it is likely that in some future quarters, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance. IF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS. Our products represent a fundamentally new way of performing surgery. Achieving physician, patient and third-party payor acceptance of Intuitive surgery as a preferred method of performing surgery will be crucial to our success. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, hospitals will not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that physicians' and third-party payors' acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing surgical techniques. Even if we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials, surgeons may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example, cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional open heart surgery simply because such surgery is already so widely accepted. In addition, surgeons may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors. We expect that there will be a learning process involved for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Broad use of our products will require training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products. Although we are in the process of developing training programs for surgical teams, we cannot be certain that our training programs will be cost effective or sufficient to meet our customers' needs. 6\n\n11 OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY AND UNCERTAIN DOMESTIC REGULATORY PROCESS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY DOMESTIC REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. Our products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution and production of medical devices in the United States. Our products have not been approved by the FDA for any surgical procedure. If we fail to obtain FDA approval for the use of our products, our business will be harmed and we will not be able to market and sell our products in the United States. In November 1999, we submitted a premarket approval, or PMA, application requesting permission to market our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments for laparoscopic surgical procedures, which the FDA accepted for review in December 1999. In addition to the pending PMA application for laparoscopic approval, we presently have a clinical study in progress covering surgery in the chest called thoracoscopic surgery. A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically includes extensive preclinical and clinical trials and other data, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device. Data obtained from clinical trials are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent us from obtaining FDA approval. In April 2000, we received a letter from the FDA setting forth a number of issues which need to be resolved prior to obtaining a PMA approval. We cannot assure you that we will successfully resolve these issues or obtain FDA approval for the use of our products in laparoscopic or other surgical procedures on a timely basis or at all. Even if our products are approved by the FDA, if we modify them, the FDA may require us to obtain approval of the modified products before we are permitted to market and sell them. We anticipate that the FDA will require a new PMA approval or PMA supplement approval for additional types of surgical procedures for which we propose to market our products. Any delay in receiving approval, failure to receive approval or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would harm our ability to market and sell our products. For additional information concerning regulatory approval of our products, see \"Business -- Government Regulation.\" OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY PROCESSES AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. To be able to market and sell our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are expensive, and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate revenue will be harmed. The European Union requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the CE mark to their products before selling them in member countries of the European Union. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. In order to obtain the right to affix the CE mark to products, a manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes meet certain European quality standards. In January 1999, we received permission to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments for general surgical use. We received additional CE approvals for use of our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments in cardiac surgery in September 1999 and February 2000. 7\n\n12 If we modify existing products or develop new products in the future, including new instruments, we will need to apply for permission to affix the CE mark to such products. In addition, we will be subject to annual regulatory audits in order to maintain the CE mark permissions we have already obtained. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain permission to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the permissions we have already received. If we are unable to maintain permission to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the European Union. IF INSTITUTIONS OR SURGEONS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR PROCEDURES USING OUR PRODUCTS, OR IF REIMBURSEMENT IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT SALES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS. At present, the da Vinci Surgical System is categorized as an \"experimental device\" and thus does not qualify for Medicare reimbursement. In late 1999, the FDA denied our formal request for reclassification of the da Vinci Surgical System as an investigational, rather than an experimental, device. We believe that unless the FDA approves our PMA application for a particular indication, such as laparoscopic use, reimbursement through Medicare will be unavailable in the United States for our products. Domestic institutions will typically bill the services performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if government and private payors' policies do not permit reimbursement for surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In such circumstances, we may have to apply to the American Medical Association for a unique Current Procedural Terminology code covering computer-enhanced surgery. If an application for a unique code is required, reimbursement for any use of our products may be unavailable until an appropriate code is granted. The application process, from filing until adoption of a new code, can take two or more years. Our success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for reimbursement through government-sponsored health care payment systems and third-party payors. Reimbursement practices vary significantly by country. Many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Other foreign markets have both private insurance systems and government-managed systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of reimbursement in any country within a particular time. In addition, health care cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the United States are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our products and these efforts are expected to continue. For further information on third-party reimbursement policies, see \"Business -- Third-Party Reimbursement.\" IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONTAINED IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM USE BY THIRD PARTIES, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET WILL BE HARMED. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in our products, and on successfully defending our patents and other intellectual property against third party challenges. We will incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and, if necessary, defending our proprietary rights. The patent positions of medical device companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and 8\n\n13 involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. We cannot assure you that we will obtain the patent protection we seek, or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to develop additional patentable proprietary technologies. If we fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property, or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated, others could use our intellectual property without compensating us, resulting in harm to our business. We may also determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third party's products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings, including patent interferences or reexaminations. Given the early priority dates of some of our licensed patents, we believe one or more patent proceedings may be in our best interests. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. OTHERS MAY ASSERT THAT OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO ENGAGE IN COSTLY DISPUTES AND, IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES, COULD ALSO CAUSE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES AND PROHIBIT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. We are aware of both United States and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to computer-assisted surgery and minimally invasive surgery. Some of these patents on their face appear broad enough to cover one or more aspects of our present technology, and may cover aspects of our future technology. We do not know whether any of these patents, if challenged, would be held valid, enforceable and infringed. From time to time, we receive, and likely will continue to receive, letters from third parties inviting us to license their patents. We may be sued by, or become involved in an administrative proceeding because of one or more of these third parties, regardless of the merits or likely outcome of such suit or proceeding. We cannot assure you that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses we have concerning invalidity, unenforceability or noninfringement of any third-party patent. In addition to the issued patents of which we are aware, other parties may have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering surgical products that are similar or identical to ours. We cannot assure you that any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party will not cover our products or will not have priority over our patent applications. The medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed such actions to gain a competitive advantage. If third parties assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us, our technical and management personnel will experience a significant diversion of time and effort and we will incur large expenses defending ourselves. If third parties in any patent action are successful, our patent portfolio may be damaged, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, and we may be required to stop selling our products or obtain a license which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. We cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources or the substantive arguments to defend our patents from infringement or claims of invalidity or unenforceability, or to defend against allegations of infringement of third-party patents. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated by us, or initiated or threatened against us, could cause our stock price to decline. THE RIGHTS AND MEASURES WE RELY ON TO PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDERLYING OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PREVENT THIRD PARTIES FROM USING OUR TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET. In addition to patents, we typically rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these measures may not be 9\n\n14 adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products. If they do not protect our rights adequately, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in developing our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries. For a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection outside the United States. We also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our intellectual property rights, or may design around our proprietary technologies. For further information on our intellectual property and the difficulties in protecting it, see \"Business -- Intellectual Property.\" OUR PRODUCTS RELY ON LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND IF WE LOSE ACCESS TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES, OUR REVENUES COULD DECLINE. We rely on technology that we license from others, including technology that is integral to our products. We have entered into license agreements with SRI International, IBM, MIT and Heartport. Any of these agreements may be terminated for breach, including the failure to make required payments under the IBM license and the failure to commercialize our products under the SRI International license. If any of these agreements is terminated, we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms, or at all. The loss or failure to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay further development or commercialization of our products. See \"Business -- Intellectual Property\" for further information on our license agreements. BECAUSE OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE TO PURCHASE OUR COMPETITORS' PRODUCTS OR MAY NOT ACCEPT INTUITIVE SURGERY, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE. Intuitive surgery is a new technology that must compete with established minimally invasive surgery and open surgery. These procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and in many cases have a long history of use. We also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the minimally invasive surgery market. In addition, we presently face increasing competition from companies who are developing robotic and computer-assisted surgical systems. Our revenues may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective or less expensive than our products. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues will suffer. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors, especially those with greater resources. In many cases, the medical conditions that can be treated using our products can also be treated by pharmaceuticals or other medical devices and procedures. Many of these alternative treatments are also widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. In addition, technological advances could make such treatments more effective or less expensive than using our products, which could render our products obsolete or unmarketable. We cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will be competitive with current or future technologies. 10\n\n15 IF SOFTWARE DEFECTS ARE DISCOVERED IN OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL UNFORESEEN COSTS, HOSPITALS MAY NOT PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR REPUTATION MAY SUFFER. Our products incorporate sophisticated computer software. Complex software frequently contains errors or failures, especially when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures, we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to software defects. We cannot assure you that our software will not experience errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience software errors or performance problems, any of the following could occur: - delays in product shipments; - loss of revenue; - delay in market acceptance; - diversion of our resources; - damage to our reputation; - increased service or warranty costs; or - product liability claims. WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY ENCOUNTER MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS OR DELAYS THAT COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE. We have manufactured a limited number of our products for prototypes and sales to customers. We may be unable to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing capacity. Even if this capacity can be established and maintained, the cost of doing so may increase the cost of our products and reduce our ability to compete. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of our products, including: - problems involving production yields; - quality control and assurance; - component supply shortages; - shortages of qualified personnel; and - compliance with state, federal and foreign regulations. Manufacturing our products is a complex process. We plan to manufacture products to fill purchase orders rather than to maintain inventories of our assembled products. If demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to establish and maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace would be damaged. IF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE OR EUROPEAN MANUFACTURING STANDARDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR PART OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN PRODUCT DELIVERY DELAYS AND LOST REVENUE. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated by the FDA for compliance with Good Manufacturing 11\n\n16 Practice requirements. We are also required to comply with the ISO 9000 series standards in order to produce products for sale in Europe. If we fail to continue to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO 9000 series standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations. We are currently in compliance with ISO 9000 series standards. In March 2000, the FDA inspected our Mountain View facility and the Good Manufacturing Practice issues raised during the inspection have been resolved. Maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly. We cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or the ISO 9000 series standards in future audits by regulatory authorities. The state of California also requires that we maintain a license to manufacture medical devices. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were inspected in February 1998. In March 1998, we passed the inspection and received a device manufacturing license from the California Department of Health Services. We will be subject to periodic inspections by the California Department of Health Services and if we are unable to maintain this license following any future inspections, we will be unable to manufacture or ship any products. OUR RELIANCE ON SOLE AND SINGLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR WITHIN BUDGET. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole source suppliers or single source suppliers. We purchase components through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. The disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our profitability. A disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget. THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS THAT COULD BE EXPENSIVE, DIVERT MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AND HARM OUR BUSINESS. Our business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims. The medical device industry has historically been litigious, and we face financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products were to cause injury or death. There is also the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims. Particularly as sales of our products increase, we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or adequate amounts. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. A product liability claim or any product recalls could also harm our reputation or result in a decline in revenues. OUR GROWTH WILL PLACE A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES AND, IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET, SELL AND DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE HARMED. In order to complete clinical trials, scale-up manufacturing, expand marketing and distribution capabilities and develop future products, we must expand our operations. We expect that future 12\n\n17 expansion will occur particularly in the areas of sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development. This expansion will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain upon our management, operating and financial systems and resources. We plan to sell our products primarily through direct sales, and we currently have a small sales organization. Our products require a complex marketing and sales effort targeted at several levels within a prospective customer's organization. We will need to expand our sales team significantly over the next 12 months to achieve our sales growth goals. We will face significant challenges and risks in building and managing our sales team, including managing geographically dispersed sales efforts and adequately training our sales people in the use and benefits of our products. To accommodate our growth and compete effectively, we will be required to improve our information systems, create additional procedures and controls and expand, train, motivate and manage our work force. Our future success will depend in part on the ability of current and future management personnel to operate effectively, both independently and as a group. We cannot be certain that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations. IF WE LOSE OUR KEY PERSONNEL OR ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WILL BE HARMED. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, in particular Lonnie M. Smith, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Frederic H. Moll, M.D., our Vice President and Medical Director and Robert G. Younge, our Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. In order to pursue our product development, marketing and commercialization plans, we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in research and development, clinical testing, government regulation, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and finance. Our product development plans depend in part on our ability to attract and retain engineers with experience in mechanics, software and optics. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies, and universities. The loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete. INTERNATIONAL SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, WHICH EXPOSES US TO RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR GROWTH MAY BE LIMITED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES. Our business currently depends in large part on our activities in Europe, and a component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence into additional foreign markets. Sales to markets outside of the United States accounted for approximately 91% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 1999 and 56% for the three months ended March 31, 2000. We will be subject to a number of challenges that specifically relate to our international business activities. These challenges include: - failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property; - protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets; - the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation; - the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets; and - building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations. 13\n\n18 Currently, a majority of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets. If we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges, our international operations may not be successful, which would limit the growth of our business. FAILURE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR GENERATE THE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL NECESSARY TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS AND INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE, RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND MAY PREVENT US FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. We expect that our existing capital resources, revenue to be derived from the sale of our products and the net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least through 2001. After that, we may need to raise additional funds and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things: - develop or enhance our products and services; - acquire technologies, products or businesses; - expand operations in the United States or internationally; - hire, train and retain employees; or - respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements. Our failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenues and could harm our business. RISKS RELATED TO OUR OFFERING THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR SALE IN THE NEAR FUTURE MAY CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market following this offering could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The number of shares of common stock available for sale in the public market is limited by restrictions under federal securities law and under some agreements that our stockholders have entered into with the underwriters and with us. Those lockup agreements restrict our stockholders from selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of their shares for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus without the prior written consent of Lehman Brothers Inc. However, Lehman Brothers Inc. may, in its sole discretion, release all or any portion of the common stock from the restrictions of the lockup agreements. The following table indicates approximately when the 29,429,264 shares of our common stock that are not being sold in the offering but which were outstanding as of March 31, 2000 will be eligible for sale into the public market: ELIGIBILITY OF RESTRICTED SHARES FOR SALE DAYS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE IN PUBLIC MARKET COMMENT ----------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------ On Effectiveness....................... 0 Shares not locked-up and saleable under Rule 144(k) 180 days............................... 25,590,896 Lock-up released; shares saleable under Rules 144, 144(k) and 701 At various times after 180 days........ 3,838,368 Shares saleable under Rules 144, 144(k) and 701 Additionally, of the 1,810,750 shares issuable upon exercise of options to purchase our common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2000, approximately 863,346 shares will be vested and eligible for 14\n\n19 sale 180 days after the date of this prospectus. For a further description of the eligibility of shares for sale in to the public market following the offering, see \"Shares Eligible for Future Sale.\" THE BOOK VALUE OF THE SHARES INVESTORS PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE PRICE THAT INVESTORS PAY FOR THE SHARES, AND IF A LIQUIDATION WERE TO OCCUR, INVESTORS MIGHT RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE PURCHASE PRICE THE INVESTORS PAID FOR THE SHARES. The assumed initial public offering price is substantially higher than the book value per share of our common stock. Investors purchasing common stock in this offering will, therefore, incur immediate dilution of $8.24 in net tangible book value per share of common stock, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share. In addition, the number of shares available for issuance under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans will automatically increase without stockholder approval. Investors will incur additional dilution upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants. As a result of this dilution, investors purchasing stock in this offering may receive significantly less than the full purchase price that they paid for the shares purchased in this offering in the event of a liquidation. See \"Dilution\" for a more detailed discussion of the dilution new investors will incur in this offering. OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE BECAUSE OUR SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN PUBLICLY TRADED BEFORE, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock, and an active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained after the offering. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between the representatives of the underwriters and us and may not be indicative of future market prices. The market prices for securities of medical device companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock: - announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us; - developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents by our competitors or us; - developments concerning our clinical trials; - publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by our competitors or us; - regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; - litigation or other disputes and associated public announcements; - economic and other external factors or other disaster or crisis; or - period-to-period fluctuations in financial results. WE ARE AT RISK OF SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION DUE TO OUR EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially acute for us because technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and, as a result, have been subject to, on average, a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in 15\n\n20 other industries. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources and could harm our business. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS WHICH COULD DISCOURAGE OR PREVENT A TAKEOVER, EVEN IF AN ACQUISITION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include: - establishing a classified board of directors that prevents a majority of the board from being elected at one time; - authorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt; - prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates; - limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; - prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders; and - establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Intuitive Surgical. CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP AMONG OUR EXISTING EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS MAY PREVENT NEW INVESTORS FROM INFLUENCING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE DECISIONS. Upon completion of this offering, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 58.2% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders as a group will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporation transactions. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of Intuitive Surgical and will make some transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. See \"Principal Stockholders\" for details of our stock ownership. 16\n\n21 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements under the captions \"Prospectus Summary,\" \"Risk Factors,\" \"Use of Proceeds,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business\" and elsewhere in this prospectus are \"forward-looking statements.\" These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements contained in the prospectus that are not historical facts. When used in this prospectus, the words \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\" \"predicts,\" \"seeks,\" \"should\" or \"will\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other factors discussed under \"Risk Factors.\" Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are not under any duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus to conform these statements to actual results, unless required by law. 17\n\n22 USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the 8,000,000 shares of our common stock will be approximately $88.3 million, approximately $101.6 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, at an assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes, including increased expenditures for research and development, sales and marketing, and selling, general and administrative. The amounts and timing of these expenditures will vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire additional businesses, products and technologies, to lease additional facilities, or to establish joint ventures that we believe will complement our current or future business. However, we have no specific plans, agreements or commitments to do so and are not currently engaged in any negotiations for any business acquisition or joint venture. The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public market for our common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in short term interest bearing, investment-grade securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds will be invested to yield a favorable return. We believe that our available cash, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid any cash dividends. We currently expect to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for at least the next four years. 18\n\n23 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our actual capitalization as of March 31, 2000. Our capitalization is also presented: - on a pro forma basis to give effect to the automatic conversion of our preferred stock into an aggregate of 22,728,250 shares of common stock, which will occur upon the closing of this offering; and - on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give effect to the automatic conversion of our preferred stock into common stock upon closing of this offering and to reflect our receipt of net proceeds from the sale of 8,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

See \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this prospectus. 19\n\n24 DILUTION The pro forma net tangible book value of our common stock, on March 31, 2000, after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock upon the closing of the offering, was approximately $52.3 million, or approximately $1.78 per share. Pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. Dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of common stock in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately afterwards. Assuming our sale of 8,000,000 shares of common stock offered by this prospectus at an assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, our net tangible book value at March 31, 2000 would have been approximately $140.6 million or $3.76 per share. This represents an immediate decrease in net tangible book value of $8.24 per share to new investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering. The following table illustrates this dilution: Assumed initial public offering............................. $ 12.00 Pro forma net tangible book value per share at March 31, 2000................................................... $ 1.78 Increase per share attributable to new investors.......... 1.98 ------- Pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering.................................................. 3.76 ------- Dilution in net tangible book value per share to new investors................................................. $ 8.24 ======= If the underwriters' over-allotment option were exercised in full, the pro forma net tangible book value per share after the offering would be $3.99 per share, the increase in net tangible book value per share to existing stockholders would be $2.21 per share and the dilution in net tangible book value to new investors would be $8.01 per share. The following table summarizes, on a pro forma basis, as of March 31, 2000, the differences between the total consideration paid and the average price per share paid by the existing stockholders and the new investors with respect to the number of shares of common stock purchased from us based on an assumed public offering price of $12.00 per share. We have not deducted estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses in our calculations. SHARES PURCHASED TOTAL CONSIDERATION --------------------- ----------------------- AVERAGE PRICE NUMBER PERCENT AMOUNT PERCENT PER SHARE ---------- ------- ------------ ------- ------------- Existing stockholders....... 29,429,264 79% $129,801,000 57% $ 4.41 New stockholders............ 8,000,000 21 96,000,000 43 12.00 ---------- ------- ------------ ------- Total..................... 37,429,264 100% $225,801,000 100% ========== ======= ============ ======= The foregoing discussion and tables do not assume the exercise of any stock options or warrants outstanding at March 31, 2000. At March 31, 2000, there were: - 1,810,750 shares of common stock underlying options outstanding as of March 31, 2000 at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.11 per share; - 5,794,472 shares of common stock available for future grant under our stock option plans, of which options to purchase 19,000 shares of common stock were granted in April 2000 at an exercise price of $3.00 per share; - 1,000,000 shares that we could issue under an employee stock purchase plan; and 20\n\n25 - 11,000 shares of common stock underlying a warrant outstanding as of March 31, 2000 at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. In addition, in April 2000, a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock was issued at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. Assuming the exercise of all options and warrants outstanding at March 31, 2000, the pro forma net tangible book value at March 31, 2000 after the offering would be $144.5 million, or $3.68 per share, which would represent an immediate increase in the pro forma net tangible book value of $1.90 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $8.32 per share to new investors.

You should read carefully the consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus, including the notes to the consolidated financial statements and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" The selected data in this section are not intended to replace the consolidated financial statements. We derived the consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 1998 and 1999 from the consolidated financial statements which have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP and included elsewhere in this prospectus. The consolidated statements of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 1999 and 2000, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2000, have been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We derived the consolidated statement of operations data for the period from inception (November 9, 1995) through December 31, 1996 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 1996 and 1997 from the audited consolidated financial statements which have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP but which are not included elsewhere in this prospectus. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations for these periods and financial condition at that date. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the method used to determine the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted and pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share.

Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this prospectus. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements or the risk factors. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. OVERVIEW Since our inception in November 1995, we have engaged in the development and commercialization of products that are designed to provide the flexibility of open surgery while operating through ports. We believe that our technology enables surgeons to perform better surgery while giving patients the benefits of MIS surgery, including decreased trauma and postoperative pain, reduced surgical complications, shorter hospital stays and lower total treatment costs. In 1999, we introduced our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments. We incurred net losses of $23.6 million in 1997, $29.4 million in 1998, $18.4 million in 1999 and $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000. As of March 31, 2000, we had an accumulated deficit of $80.2 million. We expect to expend substantial financial resources to expand marketing, direct sales, training and customer support needed to support higher sales. In addition, we anticipate our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop new products and conduct clinical trials. If we receive FDA approval, we will need to expend significant capital resources to expand our manufacturing capabilities. This investment is likely to result in low gross margins. Furthermore, we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production. Problems may include low production yields, component supply shortages, shortages of qualified personnel and failure to comply with federal, state and international regulations. We have obtained permission from the European Union to affix the CE Mark to the da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments for general surgical and cardiac surgical use. In the second quarter of 1999, we recognized revenue for the first time for the sale of our products. Sales to markets outside of the United States represent 91% of our 1999 sales and 56% of our first quarter 2000 sales. In November 1999, we filed a PMA application with the FDA for laparoscopic use of the da Vinci Surgical System and our EndoWrist instruments, and this application is currently under FDA review. Substantial revenue growth in the United States is dependent on FDA approval of our products. Sales are generated through our direct sales force and through our distributors. Revenue is generated from sales of our da Vinci Surgical System and related accessories, our EndoWrist instruments and ongoing service provided to our customers. System revenue is recognized upon installation for direct sales and upon shipment for sales to our distributors. If substantial contractual obligations exist after system installation, revenue is recognized after our obligations are fulfilled. We recognize revenue for our EndoWrist instruments and accessories upon shipment. In 1999 and in the first quarter of 2000, the majority of our revenues came from the sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are high revenue dollar items. A smaller percentage of our 1999 and first quarter of 2000 revenue came from sales of EndoWrist instruments and accessories, which are lower revenue dollar items. Although we expect the majority of our revenues to continue to come from the sale of da Vinci Surgical Systems over the next few years, we expect the percentage of revenue from our EndoWrist instruments to increase. Due to the high dollar revenue per system sold, 24\n\n29 small variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. During the useful life of each installed da Vinci Surgical System, we expect to generate recurring revenue through sales of our EndoWrist instruments and accessories. For the year ended December 31, 1999, two customers, AB Medica SRL and Marubeni America Corporation, each accounted for 16% of our total sales. For the three months ended March 31, 2000, four customers, Henrico Doctor's Hospital, AB Medica SRL, Marubeni America Corporation and Pitt County Memorial Hospital, accounted for 30%, 28%, 22% and 14% of total sales, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended March 31, 1999 and 2000 Sales. Sales were recorded for the first time in the second quarter of 1999. For the three months ended March 31, 2000, we recorded $2.9 million in revenue for shipments of the da Vinci Surgical System, EndoWrist instruments and accessories. Cost of Sales. Cost of sales includes material, manufacturing labor, overhead and warranty costs. No cost of sales exists for the three months ended March 31, 1999. We reported cost of sales of $2.5 million, or 86% of sales, for the three months ended March 31, 2000. Gross Profit. No gross profit exists for the three months ended March 31, 1999. For the three months ended March 31, 2000, gross profit was $401,000, or 14% of sales. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products, purchases of laboratory supplies and clinical trials. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses decreased from $4.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 1999 to $2.6 million during the comparable period in 2000. The decrease is primarily attributable to a change in our treatment of manufacturing-related costs. Starting in the second quarter of 1999, we transitioned from recording manufacturing-related costs as research and development expense to cost of sales. We expect research and development spending will increase in the future, in absolute dollars, as we expand our product development efforts and seek further regulatory approvals. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $1.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 1999 to $3.1 million during the comparable period in 2000. The increase is primarily attributable to $1.0 million in increased personnel costs and $291,000 in marketing expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support expanding business activities and the additional administrative costs related to being a public company. Interest Income (Expense), Net. Net interest income increased from $189,000 during the three months ended March 31, 1999 to $336,000 during the comparable period in 2000. The increase resulted from increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances, which was driven by the exercise of warrants to purchase preferred stock in March 2000 yielding approximately $35.4 million in gross proceeds. Years Ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 Sales. Sales were recorded for the first time in 1999. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we recorded $10.2 million in revenue for shipments of the da Vinci Surgical System, EndoWrist instruments and accessories. 25\n\n30 Cost of Sales. No cost of sales exists for years 1997 and 1998. We reported cost of sales of $9.3 million, or 91% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 1999. Gross Profit. No gross profit exists for years 1997 and 1998. For the year ended December 31, 1999, gross profit was $919,000, or 9% of sales. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased from $14.3 million in 1997 to $23.2 million in 1998 and decreased to $11.1 million in 1999. The increase in research and development expenses from 1997 to 1998 was primarily attributable to increases of $2.6 million in prototype costs associated with development of the da Vinci Surgical System, $2.4 million in clinical trial costs, and $3.1 million related to increased personnel costs. The decrease in research and development expenses from 1998 to 1999 is primarily attributable to reductions of $5.4 million in prototype costs, $2.3 million in clinical trial costs, and $619,000 in deferred compensation expense. In addition, we transitioned from recording manufacturing-related costs as research and development in 1998 to cost of sales in 1999. This resulted in a decrease of $3.6 million in research and development costs from 1998 to 1999. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $4.4 million in 1997 to $7.6 million in 1998 and to $9.3 million in 1999. The increase from 1997 to 1998 is primarily attributable to $1.4 million in increased personnel costs and $468,000 in marketing expenses. The increase from 1998 to 1999 is primarily due to increased personnel costs. Technology License. Technology license expense of $6.0 million was recognized in 1997 in conjunction with technology obtained from IBM. The arrangement with IBM specifically limits our application of the technology to products used in surgery. Since none of our products had received regulatory approval, and we had no alternative future use for the technology, this amount was expensed when incurred. Interest Income (Expense), Net. Net interest income remained relatively constant at $1.1 million in 1997, $1.3 million in 1998 and $1.1 million in 1999. The increase from 1997 to 1998 resulted from increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances. The decrease from 1998 to 1999 resulted from lower interest income earned on lower average cash balances, and higher interest expense on additional debt. Subsequent to March 31, 2000 In April 2000, we entered into an agreement with Heartport, Inc. to exclusively license a number of Heartport's patents in exchange for cash of $3.0 million and a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. We anticipate that a charge of approximately $5.0 million will be recorded as a result of this agreement, which will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the patents. DEFERRED COMPENSATION We recorded deferred compensation as the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the fair value of its common stock at the time of grant for financial reporting purposes. Deferred compensation is amortized to research and development expense, and selling, general and administrative expense. Deferred compensation recorded through March 31, 2000 was $7.2 million with accumulated amortization of $4.1 million. The remaining $3.1 million will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options, generally four years from the date of grant. We anticipate that additional deferred compensation totaling $1.5 million will be recorded for options granted in April and May 2000. These amounts are being amortized over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options using a graded-vesting method. We expect to record amortization expense for deferred compensation as follows: $2.5 million during 2000, $1.3 million during 2001, $600,000 during 2002 and $200,000 during 2003. The amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in 26\n\n31 future periods may decrease if unvested options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently canceled. NET OPERATING LOSS AND RESEARCH TAX CREDIT CARRY FORWARDS As of December 31, 1999, net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $44.8 million and $13.8 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. Federal and state research tax credit carryforwards were approximately $2.0 million. The state and federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2003 through 2019 if not utilized. The utilization of such carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \"change in ownership\" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\" or SFAS 133 which, as amended, is required to be adopted in years beginning after June 15, 2000. Because we do not use derivatives, management does not anticipate the adoption of SFAS 133 will have a significant effect on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of Intuitive Surgical. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, \"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,\" or SAB 101. SAB 101 summarizes some areas of the staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. We believe that our current revenue recognition principles comply with SAB 101. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since our inception we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our preferred stock, yielding net proceeds of approximately $127.3 million, and equipment financing arrangements yielding approximately $6.5 million. The equipment arrangements provide financing at specified interest rates for periods of up to 48 months, by which time the principal is repaid to the lessors. As collateral for the equipment financing, we have granted the lessors a security interest in equipment specified under each arrangement. As of March 31, 2000, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $54.6 million and working capital of $51.7 million. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $14.9 million, $31.1 million, $15.9 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999 and for the three months ended March 31, 2000, respectively. For such periods, net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from net losses. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $18.4 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1999, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities was approximately $954,000 and $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 and for the three months ended March 31, 2000, respectively. Investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and the purchase, sale and maturity of short-term investments. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $48.9 million, $23.3 million, $20.2 million and $34.9 million for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999 and for the three months ended March 31, 2000, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the sale of preferred stock and proceeds from long-term borrowings. In June 1999, October 1999 and March 2000, we entered into equipment financing agreements with Heller Financial to finance equipment totaling $1.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The term of these leases is 36 months. The interest rate for these financing agreements 27\n\n32 is approximately 10%. The June 1999, October 1999 and March 2000 financing agreements provide for monthly payments of approximately $48,000, $16,000 and $16,000, respectively. We have granted Heller Financial a security interest in all equipment covered under these agreements. In addition, we have four prior equipment financing agreements with GE Capital with an outstanding balance of $2.4 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 1999 and March 31, 2000, respectively. We are currently repaying these amounts at interest rates ranging from approximately 9.0% to 13.8%. We have granted to GE Capital a security interest in all equipment covered under these agreements. In connection with these financing agreements, we issued a warrant to purchase 11,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00. The warrant, which is currently exercisable, expires in April 2003. As of March 31, 2000, we had capital equipment of $7.1 million less accumulated depreciation of $4.0 million to support our clinical, research, development, manufacturing and administrative activities. For the next twelve months, we expect capital expenditures to increase modestly as we acquire equipment and expand our facilities. Among these planned expenditures are tooling costs for production and tenant improvements. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to expand our support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities. We believe that our current cash balances, together with the net proceeds of this offering and revenue to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through 2001. During or after this period, if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements. Additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk in the future, we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds and government and non-government debt securities. The average duration of all of our investments as of December 31, 1999 and March 31, 2000 was less than one year. Due to the short term nature of these investments, we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments. Therefore, no quantitative tabular disclosure is required. 28\n\n33 BUSINESS OVERVIEW We design and manufacture the da Vinci Surgical System, an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a new generation of surgery -- the third generation. We believe that this new generation of surgery, which we call Intuitive surgery, is a revolutionary advance similar in scope to the previous two generations of surgery -- open surgery and minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. Our da Vinci System consists of a surgeon's console, a patient-side cart, a high performance vision system and our proprietary instruments. By placing computer-enhanced technology between the surgeon and patient, we believe that our system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon's natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. Our da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with the intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D visualization characteristic of open"
