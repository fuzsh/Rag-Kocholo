        "text": "Johnson & Johnson and Save the Children\n\nJohnson & Johnson has been a long-time partner of Save the Children. Our shared vision is a world where no child dies from preventable causes and every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.\n\nJohnson & Johnson and Save the Children are working side by side throughout the world, building the resiliency of children through innovative approaches to health and development, while serving as the leading voice for those who need it the most.\n\nPartnership Overview\n\nBuilding on a strong relationship of more than two decades, in the fall of 2014, Johnson & Johnson announced an ambitious commitment to improve the survival and healthy development of children under age 5, especially newborns. As a result, Save the Children was named the first-ever enterprise-wide global partner of Johnson & Johnson. This visionary multi-year commitment from Johnson & Johnson supported all the work of Save the Children, with particular emphasis on newborn survival and addressing the needs of refugee children.\n\nIn addition, Johnson & Johnson continued to support Save the Children beyond monetary ways, including advocacy leadership, in-kind donations and employee engagement. In 2018, Johnson & Johnson and Save the Children launched the renewal of this bold pledge, building on historic successes and leveraging each other’s expertise, reach and influence to affect future generations, wherever they may live.\n\nIn honor of Save the Children’s Centennial year, Johnson & Johnson made a multi-million dollar commitment directed to humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and resilience. This comprehensive program is the first of its kind, dedicated to improving the psychosocial wellbeing and resiliency for children, their families and communities in times of crisis, in the U.S. and globally.\n\nInvesting Locally and Globally\n\nIn the United States, Johnson’s, part of the Johnson & Johnson Family of Consumer Companies, invested time and talent in Save the Children’s community and home visitation early childhood development programs to help provide a stimulating start for children from ages 0-3. Additionally, in the U.S. and around the world, when natural disasters, such as hurricanes or floods devastate local communities, Johnson & Johnson partners with Save the Children to respond to the needs of affected children. Their support enhances Save the Children’s capacity to improve the resiliency of children after emergencies, increasing the opportunity to reach their full potential, as well as immediate disaster support via Johnson & Johnson product and hygiene kits.\n\nGlobally, in partnership with local Ministries of Health and other stakeholders, we are collaborating with frontline health workers to increase effective coverage of high impact newborn interventions through strengthening essential newborn care and the management of birth asphyxia, preterm births and small and sick newborns. This approach aims to prevent and manage the life-threatening conditions that lead to newborn deaths and is designed to target the most vulnerable mothers and babies in the world. Our approach has seen measurable results in Bangladesh and Guatemala where it is proving to be a powerful tool to effectively reduce newborn deaths.\n\nJohnson & Johnson businesses around the world engage with Save the Children members at the local level. Strategic investments in the Middle East, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate Johnson & Johnson’s support of Save the Children in maternal and child health, early childhood development, mental health and psychosocial support, emergency response and improvement of health care delivery systems. Through public-private partnerships, Johnson & Johnson has generously contributed to efforts to further our work in preterm birth prevention in Mali.\n\nMission Support, Advocacy and Innovation\n\nJohnson & Johnson recognizes that non-governmental organizations often need financial flexibility to reach strategic milestones and deliver impactful programs. As a trusted partner, Save the Children receives significant mission support from Johnson & Johnson to invest annually in the critical services that we provide children worldwide. This includes the underwriting of our annual fundraising event and other agency initiatives. We are grateful to Johnson & Johnson for their wholehearted belief in our vision and capabilities to produce measurable results for children and their families.\n\nTogether, Save the Children and Johnson & Johnson often share a public stage to bring real life successes and learnings to global audiences – from health practitioners to midwives, media influencers to consumers. We also combine forces to amplify our shared voice on key issues for children through joint op-eds, thought leadership in panel discussions and moments such as the Advocacy Summit and Presidential Nominating Conventions.\n\nEngaging Consumers and Employees\n\nJohnson & Johnson and Save the Children recognize the inherent link between the values of J&J consumers and Save the Children supporters. Their shared values have driven innovative cause marketing campaigns to help consumers connect their everyday experiences to a powerful cause, such as Donate a Photo, which allows consumers to donate a personal photo and trigger a donation to Save the Children. Johnson & Johnson employees also continue to be strong supporters of our work, whether by writing letters to children from our sponsorship programs or by leveraging their specialized skills and talents through volunteer assignments that help strengthen our work and maximize the impact of our programs for children.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to build on our joint commitment to inspire innovation for children most in need. Johnson & Johnson is committed to helping every child in the world live a long, healthy and happy life. The vital work that Save the Children does is the basis for a better world and better future. We are tremendously excited about helping to advance this noble mission together."
