        "text": "1861\n\nIn total, the war claimed upwards of 720,000 American lives, the vast majority due to infection and disease. To limit the spread of infection, doctors performed limb amputations at record speed. They could be completed in under three minutes.\n\n1861\n\nThese near-constant operations were performed by surgeons who didn’t wash their hands or clean their tools between patients. Infection was common and often fatal.\n\n1861\n\nWhile his two older brothers fought in the Civil War, Johnson was too young to serve. So, his mother secured him an apprenticeship at her family’s pharmacy, Wood & Tittamer, in Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\n1861\n\nThere, he learned the business of mixing medicated plasters, which launched his career in the growing industry of medical products.\n\n1864\n\nFollowing his apprenticeship, Johnson’s first stop was New York City, where he worked as a salesman of drug products.\n\n1873\n\nAfter working in the industry for several years, Johnson co-founded his own company with George Seabury in 1873. The New York-based Seabury & Johnson quickly became a respected business known for its medicated plasters.\n\n1875\n\nThe company rapidly expanded, and within a few short years, had become one of the most widely recognized medicated plaster brands in the world.\n\n1876\n\nJohnson was among the 10 million people who visited the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. He was in part drawn to the World’s Fair by its International Medical Congress, the largest gathering of doctors in American history to date.\n\n1876\n\nJohnson represented his company at the fair. It was there that he listened to Dr. Joseph Lister explain his radical, new procedure: antiseptic surgery.\n\n1876\n\nWhile many doctors in the audience were skeptical of Lister’s surgery, Johnson was convinced that it was the future of medicine.\n\n1886\n\nSo inspired by Lister’s antiseptic methods, Johnson parted ways with his business partner, Seabury, and started Johnson & Johnson with his two younger brothers, Edward Mead and James Wood in 1886. Their company manufactured the world’s first mass-produced, sterile surgical supplies.\n\n1886\n\nOn a brisk January day in 1886, James found himself aboard a train passing through New Brunswick, New Jersey. He looked out his window and noticed a “for rent” sign on a nearby factory building.\n\n1886\n\nThat building became Johnson & Johnson’s first home. It opened its doors with just 14 employees: eight women and six men. Today, the company’s world headquarters remains in New Brunswick.\n\n1888\n\nThe Johnson brothers soon discovered that manufacturing sterile supplies was not enough—they needed to teach doctors how to use them. In 1888, the company published Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment, a how-to guide on antiseptic surgery.\n\n1888\n\nItinerant salesmen traveled far and wide to distribute Modern Methods across the U.S. Within a matter of months, they’d given out 85,000 copies to doctors and pharmacists.\n\n1888\n\nModern Methods was hailed as a major contribution to the field. It also served as a sales guide for Johnson & Johnson products, which were listed among the back pages.\n\n1888\n\nThe guide helped spread germ theory and antiseptic surgical methods. Just 13 years earlier, in 1875, surgeons had operated in street clothes and worked with unclean hands.\n\n1889\n\nBy 1889, most surgeons had adopted Lister’s methods. They operated in sterile robes. Here, a modern surgical team wears white uniforms and uses sterilized tools.\n\n1890\n\nJohnson & Johnson helped make sterile surgery a reality. Since its founding in 1886, the company has revolutionized the field of medicine, manufacturing the world’s first mass-produced antiseptic medical supplies.\n\n1890\n\nDuring the 20th century, the company continued to refine these supplies and reach new milestones in the field. Through product innovation and strategic acquisitions, Johnson & Johnson has become a world leader in healthcare.\n\nThe American Pharmacy\n\nThe pharmacy trade went beyond distributing medicine; it included mixing products and recommending treatments. Many Americans viewed their local pharmacist as a trusted advisor and a first point of contact, even before a physician.\n\nWood & Tittamer\n\nThis is a photo of the Wood & Tittamer pharmacy where Johnson first apprenticed. Owned by his mother’s cousin, the business was both a wholesale and retail drugstore.\n\nLower Manhattan in the 1860s\n\nThis photograph was taken only blocks from Johnson’s office within a few years of his move to New York City.\n\nWhat is a Medicated Plaster?\n\nMedicated plaster was a popular 19th-century adhesive patch that delivered medicine directly through the skin. It treated a variety of ailments, including pain and inflammation.\n\nRobert Wood Johnson on Mixing Plaster\n\n“Probably no other branch of the pharmaceutical art has been the occasion of so much toil, anxiety, and failure and discouragement before any measure of success was met...Expressive expletives could not be restrained.”\n\nPopular Plasters\n\nAmong their popular products were medicated plasters made with mustard and capsicum (the active ingredient in hot peppers).\n\nThe Old Railroad Tracks\n\nJohnson’s train stopped at the railroad depot several blocks from where this photograph was taken.\n\nA New Kind of Cotton\n\nJohnson & Johnson was a pioneer of sterile absorbent cotton, a groundbreaking product of its day. The cotton was packed in sheets that were easily wrapped around wounds to protect them from germs.\n\nKeeping Products Sterile\n\nTo manufacture sterile surgical products, factory workers took many precautions to ensure both their environment and their hands were clean. Each product was then labeled with explicit directions on how to keep it germ-free.\n\n“The Operating Table—The ordinary kitchen table will generally answer,” explained Modern Methods. “Bricks or wooden blocks should be placed under two legs of the table in order that the irrigating liquids may drain off toward the pail used for catching them.”\n\nDr. Agnew, Sterile Surgeon\n\nDr. David Hayes Agnew was a pioneering American surgeon who championed Lister’s antiseptic methods. A veteran surgeon of the Civil War, Agnew was also a contributor to Johnson & Johnson’s Modern Methods. He devoted the later years of his illustrious career to teaching sterile practices in the operating theater.\n\nElectrifying Company Factories\n\nJohnson & Johnson was an early adopter of the latest technology. By the 1890s, the company had installed Thomas Edison’s electric light bulbs in its factories.\n\nIntroducing Frederick Kilmer\n\nThis project was spearheaded by Frederick B. Kilmer, a respected New Brunswick pharmacist and public health pioneer, who, only a year later, joined Johnson & Johnson as its scientific director.\n\n“The Operating Table—The ordinary kitchen table will generally answer,” explained Modern Methods. “Bricks or wooden blocks should be placed under two legs of the table in order that the irrigating liquids may drain off toward the pail used for catching them.”"
