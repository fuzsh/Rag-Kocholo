        "text": "Canine studies\n\nTen mongrel dogs weighing 20 to 30 kg were used to determine a surgical method for port-access coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). All animals were given humane care in compliance with the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 86-23, revised 1985).\n\nGeneral anesthesia was initiated and maintained with morphine sulfate and pentobarbital. Single lung ventilation was accomplished with a balloon blocking the left bronchus. Three 10 mm ports were made in the third, fifth, and seventh intercostal spaces (ICSs) in the midaxillary line. A Distalvu 360 thoracoscope (Welch-Allyn, Skaneatales, N.Y.) was inserted into the lowermost port. The Distalvu camera is designed to allow intracavitary changes in position by way of a fingertip control steering mechanism. A 30-degree angled DeBakey type thoracoscopic forceps (Heartport) was inserted through the middle port. A combination electrocautery, suction, and irrigation device (Heartport), used through the third ICS port, allowed diathermy- assisted dissection with immediate smoke evacuation (Fig. 1). The surgeon controlled the electrocautery and forceps and the assistant guided the endoscope (Fig. 2). Dissection was begun proximally. Once across the pedicle (from lateral to medial), the forceps were passed through and were used to retract the pedicle down to facilitate the dissection. Surgical clips (Liga-clips; Weck, N.C.) were applied to secure side branches of the ITA. Approximately half way through the dissection, the thoracoscope was changed to the third ICS port and the dissecting instruments were moved to the lower two ports to complete the dissection distally. Heparin was administered intravenously (300 U/kg) and two medium/large surgical clips were placed distally across the artery. After the scope had been returned to a lower port, the forceps were inserted through the third ICS port to grasp the fascia of the pedicle just proximal to the distal clips. A thoracoscopic atraumatic temporary occlusion clamp (Heartport) was applied to the ITA pedicle proximally. The artery was divided and exteriorized through the upper port, with care taken to avoid twisting. Any proximal tethering, particularly from the medial aspect, was identified and dissected free to maximize the length of the pedicle. The occlusion clamp was released and flow of the ITA checked. The artery was prepared for anastomosis externally, and a 10 cm double-armed 7-0 polytetrafluoroethylene suture (Ultex; W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Elkton, Md.) was inserted into the heel.\n\nThe Endovascular Cardiopulmonary Bypass System (Heartport) was inserted by way of a femoral artery and vein cutdown (Fig. 3). This system has been fully described (see Schwartz et al., page 556). In brief, femoral arterial and femoral venous access is used for CPB. The venous line is augmented with a centrifugal pump. An Endopulmonary Vent (Heartport), passed via a jugular vein, assists in venting the right side of the heart and pulmonary circulation. The endoaortic balloon occlusion catheter (Endoaortic Clamp) is inflated to occlude the ascending aorta, and cardioplegic solution is delivered by way of a central lumen. It is also routinely used to vent the aortic root by way of the same central lumen. A separate lumen allows continuous transducing of aortic root pressure.\n\nCPB was initiated and the pericardium was incised sharply anterior to the phrenic nerve from the pulmonary artery to the diaphragm. The pedicle was returned inside the chest and positioned on the heart. The coronary arteries were identified by means of the thoracoscope, and port placement for the 10 mm Stereovision Probe (Heartport) was first determined by passing a needle through the anterior chest wall to locate the most direct line to the proposed anastomosis site. Two to four 5 mm ports (for microvascular instruments) and a single 10 mm port (Stereovision Probe) were inserted anteriorly (Fig. 4). The Stereovision Probe was coupled to the operating microscope (OPMI-MDU; Ziess, Thornwood, N.Y.), and a visual check was made.\n\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, the endoaortic balloon was inflated, and high-potassium cold blood (KCl, 20 mmol/L, 4º C) cardioplegic solution was infused into the aortic root.\n\nThe Stereovision Probe was positioned in the central 10 mm anterior port, and the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was identified. A 3 to 4 mm arteriotomy was made and the ITA was anastomosed to the LAD with a running continuous suture. A U stitch was placed in the heel of the ITA, with both needles passing from out to in, to facilitate the anastomosis. The needles were then both passed from within the heel of the coronary artery to out, before one arm was sewn up each side toward the toe. On completion of the anastomosis, an instrument tie was performed. The temporary occlusion clamp on the ITA was released and repair sutures were placed if needed. The endoaortic occlusion balloon catheter (Endoaortic Clamp) was deflated and the animal weaned from CPB. The animal was put to death after cardiac output had been measured by the thermodilution technique and an angiogram had been obtained.\n\nHuman cadaver study\n\nHuman cadavers were obtained from the Stanford University Division of Human Anatomy. Written consent was given by the donor's family for use of the cadaver for medical education and research. Seven cadavers were used to compare and contrast different components of the surgical method used in the canine model.\n\nIn four cadavers, three intercostal ports were inserted in the anterior axillary line. The Distalvu 360 thoracoscope was used to visualize the left ITA. The ITA was then fully dissected away from the chest wall from the subclavian vein to the level of the xiphoid process by means of endoscopic dissecting scissors and 30-degree angled DeBakey forceps. A port was made anteriorly to allow countertraction of the pericardium, and the pericardium was opened anterior to the phrenic nerve and rightward to widely expose the heart. The LAD was then located with the thoracoscope, and an anterior port was inserted in the third or fourth ICS in a parasternal location, directly over the target anastomosis site. The Stereovision Probe was inserted, and two to four additional 5 mm ports were inserted radially around this anterior port to allow the surgeon and assistant bimanual access to the heart for the anastomosis. The LAD was entered in its midportion with a scalpel. If autolysis was not significant, the ITA was anastomosed to the LAD.\n\nIn the three other cadavers, an alternative approach to access the heart for the anastomosis was to perform a 4 to 6 cm transverse parasternal incision in the fourth ICS. If better exposure was needed, the costal cartilage of an adjacent rib was removed. This space was used to facilitate the thoracoscopic ITA takedown. A soft-tissue retractor (Heartport) was used to maintain a patent port. The distal end of the pedicle was brought out through the anterior port for preparation. The pericardium was opened through this port and extended from the pulmonary artery to the diaphragm by a combination of direct vision and thoracoscopy. Stay sutures were placed to keep the pericardium open and to bring the heart closer to the chest wall. The LAD was identified and an arteriotomy made under direct vision (Fig. 5). Rib spreading was not used."
