        "text": "Cagent Vascular®, a developer of next generation angioplasty balloons using proprietary serration technology, announces Brian Walsh to serve as Chairman of the Board. Brian Walsh has held several executive level positions in cardiovascular and ophthalmology specialties within the medical device industry. Mr. Walsh currently serves as the President and CEO of Iantech Medical, a medical device company dedicated to solutions for micro-interventional cataract surgery.\n\nMr. Walsh was the former CEO of Transcend Medical while under his leadership, was sold to Novartis, (NYSE: NVS). Mr. Walsh currently serves on the Board of Directors at Iantech Medical. Mr. Walsh has held various sales and marketing roles at Xtent, Ventrica (acquired by Medtronic), Artemis Medical (acquired by Johnson & Johnson), Cardiovations, Division of Ethicon, a Johnson & Johnson company, Heartport, (acquisition by Johnson & Johnson) and Guidant Corporation.\n\nCarol A. Burns, Cagent Vascular’s President, and CEO added, “Mr. Walsh’s experience in marketing and corporate strategy will be invaluable as we advance our Serranator product line into additional indications. His expertise will add to the already impressive scientific, financial , and business acumen of our board team.”\n\n“Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a debilitating disease affecting millions of people around the world. Although advances in treatment have helped improve lives, there is still significant progress and innovation needed to treat the more advance stage, Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) that can lead to significant decrease in mobility, tissue loss and amputation. The Company’s Serranator platform is a significant advancement in angioplasty technology for opening diseased arteries,” added Mr. Walsh.\n\nThe Serranator® is an angioplasty device with serrated metal strips embedded on a semicompliant balloon. The Serranator’s unique technology is designed to create multiple longitudinal lines of interrupted micro-serrations within the luminal surface with low-pressure balloon dilatation to aid in arterial expansion. The result is predictable and controlled lumen gain. The company’s first device, the Serranator Alto, performed well in the above-the-knee PRELUDE study, especially in a subset of patients with severe calcium. The Serranator Bass balloon for treatment of infrapopliteal arteries is in development with planned FDA submission and PRELUDE-BTK study in the first half of 2019."
