Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is an American pharmaceutical company and medical device manufacturer founded in 1886. In 2016, the company’s revenue was almost $72 billion. J&J’s consumer products, health care products, medicines, and medical devices are known worldwide.

One of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, Johnson & Johnson employs over 125,000 people in sixty countries. J&J has over 250 subsidiaries, the largest of which are Janssen Pharmaceutical, Ethicon Inc., and DePuy. In 2016, the corporation based in New Brunswick, New Jersey spent over $2.4 billion on advertising expenses.

Johnson & Johnson faces lawsuits for several products, including some of their most popular drugs and devices. Thousands of people suffered injuries from J&J products, such as:

Probably the most well-known recall the corporation had to deal with involved its best-selling painkiller, Tylenol. In late September, 1982, seven people died in Chicago after taking Tylenol that had been laced with cyanide. That year, J&J recalled over thirty-one million bottles of Tylenol. And two months later, Tylenol was again featured on the market, but this time it was sold in tamper-proof packaging.

The Tylenol case is not the only recall the corporation has gone through. Starting in 2008, many consumers began to report musty, moldy odor in some of the J&J pharmaceuticals, such as: Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and other products. After a long investigation, the FDA issued recalls of over eleven different J&J products.

Research dating as far back as 1971 links talcum powder to ovarian cancer, when scientists in Wales discovered particles of talc in ovarian and cervical tumors. In 1994, the Cancer Prevention Coalition asked the FDA to add warning labels, but was denied. They asked again in 2008 and were denied again. The FDA said there was “no conclusive evidence”, although it was possible that talc may cause cancer.
