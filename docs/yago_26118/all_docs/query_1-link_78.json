        "text": "Artie Lange Interview\n\nArtie Lange was introduced to The Howard Stern Show in 1998 when he accompanied his friend, Norm MacDonald, into the studio. Artie made such an impression during his first appearance on the program that he was asked in 2001 to become a full-time member of the cast after Jackie “The Jokeman” Martling left the show.\n\nArtie’s vices – including overeating, gambling and drug and alcohol abuse – are often topics of discussion on the air. Artie also openly talks about the relationships he has with his mother and now ex-girlfriend, Dana, as well as how the death of his father affected him. Artie was born in New Jersey, where he currently resides and still hangs out with his childhood friends.\n\nArtie was one of the original cast members of Fox's \"Mad TV,\" and also had a role on Norm MacDonald’s sitcom, “Norm.” In addition to television, Artie’s filmography includes “Dirty Work,” “Lost and Found,” “The Bachelor,” “Old School,” “Elf,” and “Beer League.” Artie has also had a long career as a stand-up comedian performing in clubs around the country and released a DVD of one of his routines called, “It's The Whiskey Talkin’” Prior to getting into show biz, Artie worked the New Jersey docks as a longshoreman."
