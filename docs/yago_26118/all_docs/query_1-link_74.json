        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — You’re settling in for the night. It’s still snowing a bit, but you’re probably asking yourself: “Whatever happened to stand-up comedian and former Howard Stern sidekick Artie Lange?”\n\nWell, according to Lange’s longtime friend Jimmy Palumbo, Lange has stayed off the grid for almost a year since completing drug court this past July.\n\nPalumbo who played Johnny Trinno in the 2006 cult classic “Artie Lange’s Beer League,” told New Jersey 101.5 that he’s in the process of co-producing a sequel called “Beer League 2″ — a web series set to premiere March 30 to coincide with the opening day of baseball.\n\nAsked for an Artie update, Palumbo said: “He’s doing OK. He’s sober. He’s just trying to put it all together right now. Get himself healthy and have a clear mind. And he’s just not really doing anything, any public appearances.”\n\n“But I do talk to him. I talked to his mother and his sister. And, you know, he’s just kind of put it all together. So, I’m hopeful that soon, you’re going see Artie Lange again. He’s still got a fastball left. I pray for him. I wish him well,” Palumbo added.\n\nIn 2018, Lange was sentenced to four years of probation in connection with an arrest in May 2017 after New Jersey State Police in Bloomfield, N.J., reported pulling Lange over on the Garden State Parkway and finding him with 81 decks of heroin, including a bag of heroin in his lap with a straw, according to story published on NJ.com.\n\nLange famously replaced longtime Howard Stern sidekick Jackie “The Jokeman” Martling on Stern’s radio show from 2001 to 2009.\n\nLange is also a best-selling author of two books: “Too Fat to Fish” and “Crash and Burn.”"
