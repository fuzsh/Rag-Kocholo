        "text": "ARTIE Lange is ready to step into the starting lineup.\n\nThe comedian, who’s made a name for himself backing up Howard Stern on his radio show the past five years, will play the lead in the movie “Artie Lange’s Beer League,” opening Sept. 15.\n\nHe’s also snared a role in HBO’s “Entourage,” in an episode that will be seen next year.\n\n“Beer League,” in which Lange plays a 30-something loser living at home with his mom, was almost autobiographical, he says.\n\n“I would really be the character in this movie if I hadn’t broken into show business,” says Lange, who played softball in North Jersey, where he still resides.\n\nThe movie will allow Lange to showcase his talents after roles in “Old School” and “Dirty Work.”\n\nIt also opened the eyes of “Entourage” producer Doug Ellin.\n\nAfter watching an advance copy of the film, Ellin cast Lange, a fan of the show, as an ex-frat buddy of agent Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven).\n\n“Ari is basically jealous of me because I’m a huge success and I have a hot fiancée [Leslie Bibb],” said Lange, who playfully bit Bibb’s backside during the shoot.\n\nLange has been all over recently, from helping Andrew “Dice” Clay sell out the Borgata in Atlantic City to showing up in next week’s “Rescue Me” finale.\n\nWith so much recent attention on Lange, Stern and his crew decided to start breaking his chops on the air. But Lange knew better than to take offense.\n\n“[Stern] couldn’t be more supportive of me,” Lange said. “He’s the best boss I’ve ever had. On the air he teases, but he’ll be at the opening.”"
