        "text": "Howard Stern Show regular Artie Lange summarizes Artie Lange's Beer League as \"what would happen if the Bad New Bears grew up and became insane alcoholics and joined a softball league.\"\n\nThe movie, which opens today, follows the exploits of a ragtag team of players who are more interested in tapping kegs than fielding grounders. \"I've played in a beer league for years,\" Lange says. \"You always want to win a game, but beer helps you deal with life.\" Although the 38-year-old Lange has had recurring television roles on Mad TV and Norm, as well as bit parts in such well-received movies as Old School and Elf, he's best known as the substance-abusing, working-class sidekick on Stern's show. \"Because of Howard, I'm able to really [promote] this film,\" says Lange. \"We're a $3 million movie with a small distributor, but we have the awareness of a large studio film.\"\n\nIn Beer League, Lange plays Artie DeVanzo, an unemployed loser from New Jersey, who gathers a bunch of pals for an annual softball tournament against longtime rivals. \"These are guys who take it a little too seriously,\" Lange says. \"It's just a slice of life from Jersey.\" Karate Kid Ralph Macchio co-stars as one Lange's teammates, all of whom are way their athletic prime Â— Lange's DeVanzo takes the field in corduroy pants. \"I actually played with a guy like that,\" Lange laughs."
