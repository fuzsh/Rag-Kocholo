        "text": "1.4K\n\nComedian, actor, former “Howard Stern Show” cast member and New Jersey native Artie Lange has been very quiet during the pandemic. But he will resume his popular “Halfway House” podcasts” on Nov. 1, he announced today.\n\n“Thank you for the continued support,” he posted on his Facebook page. “Love you guys. See you Monday. iTunes, Stitcher, YouTube, etc. More details to come.”\n\nLange, 54, put the podcast on hold in February 2020 and has not resumed it until now, although he did do another podcast, briefly, in November 2020.\n\nLange has been a regular on television shows such as “Mad TV,” “The Norm Show” and “Crashing”; appeared in the movies “Dirty Work,” “Lost & Found” and “Artie Lange’s Beer League”; and written about his life in the books “Too Fat to Fish” (2009), “Crash and Burn” (2014) and “Wanna Bet?: A Degenerate Gambler’s Guide to Living on the Edge” (2018).\n\nHe also has had persistent problems with substance abuse and his health, and has spent time in jail and rehab.\n\n(OCT. 28 UPDATE: Bob Saget, who directed the aforementioned “Dirty Work,” will be the podcast’s guest on Nov. 1. “There isn’t a nicer guy in the business, or anywhere for that matter,” said Lange on Facebook.)"
