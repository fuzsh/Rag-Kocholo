        "text": "ABOUT ARTIE\n\nstand-up comedian\n\nFor over 30 years Artie Lange has been making people laugh as a stand-up comic, television and film actor, best selling author and radio host.\n\nArtie began his career in the comedy clubs of New York City, where he helped to create the popular sketch comedy group Live on Tape, after writing and performing with other troupes, including Midnight Madness and The Improvables. Artie’s breakout work with Live On Tape landed him his debut television role as one of the original series regulars on FOX’s Mad TV. Following Mad TV, Artie became a regular on Norm McDonald’s The Norm Show.\n\nIn 2001 Artie returned to his home state of New Jersey where he became a beloved regular on The Howard Stern Show for many years. During that time Artie also was featured in the films Old School, Elf and starred in Artie Lange’s Beer League. His first memoir, Too Fat ToFish was also written during this time and became a New York Times bestseller.\n\nAfter his departure from The Howard Stern Show, Artie continued in radio both with The Artie Lange Show and later on The Anthony Cumia Show all the while continuing to tour as a stand-up comedian.\n\nIn 2015 Artie returned to television with guest appearances on The Jim Gaffigan Show and the HBO comedy series Crashing which is ongoing.\n\nArtie Lange helping other addicts: That’s just who he is\n\nIf Artie Lange were a super hero, his microphone would be his secret weapon that he would use to help others, it's just what he does. When he first came on my show he talked about the time he went back to Union High School, where he should be in their Hall Of Fame, and raised $73,000 for the family of a fireman that he knew who had died. ...

READ MORE\n\nReview: Artie Lange, “The Stench of Failure,” on Comedy Central\n\nArtie Lange has been through a lot the past four years; heck the past fourteen years; hell, make it 40. He says as much at the end of his new stand-up special, which premieres at midnight tonight on Comedy Central: “Thank you for not forgetting me, guys. I’ve been through some hell.”... READ MORE\n\nArtie Lange Returns to Stand Up\n\n“It’s good to be alive,” Artie Lange said early in his set Sunday Night at New York’s Caroline’s Comedy Club. It was good to see him back; it was one of Lange’s first high-profile stand-up sets after a nearly two-year hiatus that occurred following his suicide attempt in January 2010. He later spent two stints in rehab and three in psychiatric wards... READ MORE"
