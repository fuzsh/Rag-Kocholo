        "text": "Artie Lange is a man with many talents that has worn many hats in a business where if you don’t you will be long forgotten.\n\nFrom his time on the Howard stern show, writing two New York Times best selling books “Too Fat To Fish” and “Crash and Burn,” his own movie “Beer League”, and Comedy Central specials he has done it all. Even when he was having hard times in his life he still came back on top. His last project, the Artie Lange show was on Direct TV for 2 years.\n\nArtie has entered a new domain now– the world of podcasting. Although still in its infancy compared to TV and radio, podcasting is very popular with the likes of Adam Corolla and Marc Maron and a lot of people in between. I think Artie Lange Uncensored has hit written all over it. With his years of talent and experience, and millions of his fans– it’s Artie at his candid best.\n\nAnother driving force to the show is his producer– the great Dan Felato, a veteran producer and great talent. Dan worked for the legendary Steve Dahl in Chicago and because of his ability as a producer and all around good guy, Dan has befriended the likes of Harry Eater and Bill Murray just to name a few. Dan is a guy you want on board any successfull show and he proved that on the Artie Lange Show. Besides Dan, another comedy gem is the great James Flippin. Who is not only a great on air personality, but a brilliant board operator who created many comic moments on the Artie Lange show on DirectTv.\n\nRounding out the cast are veteran comic from America’s Got Talent, Letterman and his own podcast, Fixing Joe is the great Joe Matarese. Joe is a great part of the show. He is quick, great to listen to, has great stories and brings a lot to the comedy table. And rounding out the show is Philly’s own Chris Cotton. Chris is a very funny, witty, fun and super likeable guy who always brings the house down. In the world of podcasts these guys are kings.\n\nGo to artiequitter.com to subscribe.
