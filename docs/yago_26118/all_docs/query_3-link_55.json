        "text": "One of the most sought after live comedians in the business, Lange is currently the host of “The Artie Lange Show, ” a Fox News Radio show he created with fellow comedian Nick Di Paolo. Launched this past fall, the show has already garnered rave reviews and a massive fan base. Lange was a beloved regular on “The Howard Stern Show” for five years and during that time his memoir, Too Fat To Fish became a New York Times bestseller.\n\nArtie Lange began his career in the comedy clubs of New York City, where he helped to create the popular sketch comedy group Live on Tape, after writing and performing with other troupes, including Midnight Madness and The Improvables. Lange’s breakout work with Live On Tape landed him his debut television role as one of the original series regulars on FOX’s Mad TV.\n\nArtie’s success on Mad TV led to being cast opposite Norm MacDonald in Lange’s first starring role in the MGM feature film Dirty Work. This lead to a string of feature films including, New Line’s The Bachelor, starring opposite Chris O’Donnell and Renee Zellweger; Lost and Found with David Spade for Warner Brothers; Kinka Usher’s Mystery Men and the independent drama The Fourth Floor, opposite Juliette Lewis and William Hurt. Artie also had supporting roles in the Dreamworks feature film Old School and New Line Cinema’s Elf.\n\nArtie also starred, co-wrote, and produced his own feature film Beer League. Richard Roeper gave it a “Thumbs Up, ” and the readers of the New York Times rated it four out of five stars. Variety said “the pic offers a trip back in time to a pre-PC and feminist era when men were sexist Neanderthals; women supported them from the sidelines and the guy with the biggest mouth scored.” Artie is also a regular guest on The Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Best Damn Sports Show, Period. He was a guest roaster on Comedy Central’s Roasts of Hugh Hefner and William Shatner and also shot episodes of the critically acclaimed hit series Entourage for HBO, and the season finale of Rescue Me for F/X.\n\nArtie has also produced his own concert DVD, Artie Lange: It’s The Whiskey Talkin, ’ which includes a sold out stand-up performance; a behind the scenes look at some of Artie’s gigs and the award-winning short film Gameday, which Lange wrote, produced and starred in. Another milestone for Artie was selling out his Carnegie Hall performance for the New York Comedy Festival in 3 hours. He continues to sell out venues across the United States."
