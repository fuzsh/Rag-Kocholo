        "text": "For more than 30 years Artie Lange has been making people laugh as a stand-up comic, television and film actor, best selling author and radio host. Lange will perform at 7 p.m. Saturday at Mauch Chunk Opera House, 14 W. Broadway, Jim Thorpe.\n\nLange began his career in the comedy clubs of New York City, where he helped to create the popular sketch comedy group Live on Tape, after writing and performing with other troupes, including Midnight Madness and The Improvables. Lange’s breakout work with Live On Tape landed him his debut television role as one of the original series regulars on FOX’s “Mad TV.” Next, Lange became a regular on Norm McDonald’s “The Norm Show.”\n\nIn 2001, Lange returned to his home state of New Jersey where he became a beloved regular on “The Howard Stern Show” for many years. During that time, Lange also was featured in the films “Old School,” “Elf” and starred in “Artie Lange’s Beer League.” His first memoir, “Too Fat To Fish“ was also written during this time and became a New York Times bestseller.\n\nAfter his departure from “The Howard Stern Show,” Lange continued in radio both with “The Artie Lange Show” and later on “The Anthony Cumia Show,” all the while continuing to tour as a stand-up comedian.\n\nIn 2015 Lange returned to television with guest appearances on “The Jim Gaffigan Show” and the HBOcomedy series “Crashing,” which is ongoing.\n\nTickets are $40.
