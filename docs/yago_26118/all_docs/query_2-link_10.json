        "text": "I just rewatching this movie for the 30th some time and it never fails to make me laugh my a** off! Everything works perfectly every politically incorrect comment, stereotype or scenario. The pacing is so good time flies while watching it. The casting is solid, Artie Lange is solid as is Macchio and the fantastic Jimmy Palumbo. But the best one liner character of the bunch is Dirt, played hysterically by Seymour Cassel.\n\nThis is very insulting to pretty much everybody, so be warned, if this isn't your kind of flick.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artie_Lange's_Beer_League\n\nand the R-rated trailer\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtPPLXujvzk\n\nAs you can probably tell by my screen name, I am a huge fan of Howard Stern and crew. I loved Artie right up to the last 6 months on the show.\n\nHowever, I thought Beer Leauge was one of the worst, most amateurish movies I have ever seen. His stand up dvd was almost as bad. I did like Dirty Work though.\n\nI have to agree 100%, both those movies are non stop entertainment."
