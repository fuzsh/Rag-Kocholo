        "text": "This is a foul ball of a comedy -- a raunchy, raucous frat party.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Feb 2, 2009\n\nBeer League is not for tender ears, but more for the beer-bellied, rascally rule breaker in all of us, and most importantly, there's a great chance something in here will make you laugh.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B | Dec 18, 2006\n\na whole lot of lewd potty humor that doesn't really add up to anything substantial, a guilty pleasure of sorts when taken in small bursts, but which grows somewhat tiresome in the long run\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Dec 11, 2006\n\nWhen a small delivery of casual swearing from Seymour Cassell earns your movie's biggest laugh, there's definitely a problem.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Dec 10, 2006\n\nArtie Lange, Howard Stern's radio sidekick, somehow manages to make beer-league softball seem no fun at all in this extremely lowbrow comedy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 0.5/5 | Sep 19, 2006\n\nSitting through this film is like spending the night in that sleazy bar you swore you'd never go in, not even to use the bathroom.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 0.5/4 | Sep 19, 2006\n\nThe sort of lowbrow sports comedy best enjoyed on a 50-inch screen with a six-pack, a bucket of wings and a fast-forward button.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/4 | Sep 19, 2006\n\nThe experience of watching this loosely plotted comedy set in the suburbs of New Jersey is somewhat akin to spending a nice summer day playing softball with your friends. Only without the sun, the fresh air, the exercise or the fun.\n\nFull Review | Sep 19, 2006\n\nA cavalcade of colorful profanity, bachelor-party hooker gags ... and shopworn bodily function jokes, this vehicle for Howard Stern sidekick Artie Lange is slob comedy at its slobbiest.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/4 | Sep 15, 2006\n\nDoesn't contain the average laugh quotient of half of Lange's daily Stern appearances, but its also far less obnoxious than non-fans would expect it to be.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Jun 23, 2006"
