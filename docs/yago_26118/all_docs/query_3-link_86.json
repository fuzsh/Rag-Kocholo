        "text": "Artie Lange is a tv and movie actor, stand up comedian, radio personality and Rush fan best known for being one of the original cast of MADtv and for taking over for Jackie Martling on The Howard Stern Show, where he often makes mention of Rush. His new movie Beer League was just released and contains a Rush reference. Here's the report from Counterparts member Buttmanos who recently saw the movie:\n\nArtie, 37, who lives at home with his mom, brings a girl back to his bedroom in order to have sex. The girl is concerned that the walls are too thin, and that Artie's mom will hear. Artie replies something like this: \"are you kidding? No one can hear shit in here! You can play drums in here! You can play the f-ckin drum solo for TOM SAWYER in here!\". The girl asks: \"what is tom sawyer?\" Artie answers: \"it's a rush song......dont worry about it.\" Then it cuts to the next scene. ..."
