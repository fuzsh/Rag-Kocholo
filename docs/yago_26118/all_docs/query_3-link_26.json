        "text": "Gotcha!\n\nDrama finds out he's to be the target on a new 'Punk'd'-like reality show, and thinks he's in on the joke. Eric attempts to smooth out tensions between Vince and Amanda, but they've already been relieved. Meanwhile, Ari's frat brother comes for a visit, and Ari finds himself jealous of the former slacker's newfound riches, as well as his gorgeous fiancee.\n\nArtie Lange\n\nAspiring comedian Pete finds himself without a home after he catches his wife, Jessica, in a compromising position. As Pete attempts to find solace at a New York comedy club, he befriends cynical comedy legend Artie Lange, who reluctantly offers him some pizza, some advice and a couch.\n\nThe Road\n\nPete wallows in his new reality, but Artie snaps him out of it with an offer: In exchange for a ride to Albany, Pete can be Artie's opening act. Pete meets co-headliner T.J. Miller and attempts to save Artie from breaking his sobriety by getting between him and the temptations of an ardent fan.\n\nDead Rock Stars\n\nHank and Faith attend a funeral where they meet up with the bereavedâs tour manager Krull, grieving widow and childhood pal Atticus Fetch. Later, Hank is found in a compromising position by Karen. Robbie Mac and Ken take Charlie out on the town which doesnât sit as well with Marcy as it does with their son Stuart.\n\nWarm-Up\n\nHomeless once more and facing professional disappointment, Pete turns to Artie Lange, who invites him to be a guest on his podcast. Pete meets Sarah Silverman, who takes pity on him and invites him to stay with her and her collection of stray comedians. When Sarah suggests that he try to find work as an audience 'warm up' comedian, Pete is presented with a job opportunity, where he's tasked with saving the day."
