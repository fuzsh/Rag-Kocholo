        "text": "The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Pt. 1\n\nRachel and Ross arrive at the hospital; she's upset to get a semi-private room. Monica and Chandler decide to have a baby and right away. Mrs. Geller turns up to give Ross her mother's engagement ring; she wants Ross to marry Rachel. Joey can't understand why somebody wouldn't want to be married to Rachel. Phoebe meets a handsome stranger, but can't quite get his room number, so she gets Dr. Drake Ramoray to get it. She also gets him to find out some personal info from the guy. As Rachel waits for her own baby, various other pregnant women come and go, until Janice shows up.\n\nMother\n\nA top forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Greta Heints (Susanna Thompson), is found assaulted and bound in a crack house. She regains consciousness but doesn't seem too eager to help Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) find her assailant. Her husband says she got a call on the private patient line the night of the attack and then went out. Detectives Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) investigate Greta's case list and they are looking at a patient named Benny Edgar Ralsay (P.J. Marshall), also known as the duct tape rapist. He has an ankle bracelet and claims he was at home the night of the attack, but the detectives also discover he slips his surveillance by putting the bracelet on his cat. Benny says he has nothing but total respect for Dr. Heints, even though her unconventional method - regressing patients to their early childhood to reparent them - has some people, like Dr. Huang (B.D. Wong), a little concerned.\n\nFlu Shot\n\nLiz (Tina Fey) tries desperately not to catch the flu, but itÂs spreading amongst the ÂTGSÂ cast and crew quickly and Jack (Alec Baldwin) is being selective about who receives vaccinations from Dr. Spaceman (guest star Chris Parnell). One is offered to Liz, but she refuses to take it, championing for the rights of the crew. Meanwhile, Elisa (guest star Salma Hayek) is working seven days a week, so Jack must be creative about finding ways to spend time with her. Also stars Tracy Morgan, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer, Katrina Bowden and Scott Adsit."
