Artie’s breakout work with Live On Tape landed him his debut television role as one of the original series regulars on FOX’s Mad TV. Following Mad TV, Artie became a regular on Norm McDonald’s The Norm Show.\n\nIn 2001 Artie returned to his home state of New Jersey where he became a beloved regular on The Howard Stern Show for many years. During that time Artie also was featured in the films Old School , Elf and starred in Artie Lange’s Beer League. His first memoir, Too Fat To Fish was also written during this time and became a New York Times bestseller.\n\nAfter his departure from The Howard Stern Show, Artie continued in radio both with The Artie Lange Show and later on The Anthony Cumia Show all the while continuing to tour as a stand-up comedian. In 2015 Artie returned to television with guest appearances on The Jim Gaffigan Show followed by the HBO comedy series Crashing."
