Howard Stern Show regular Artie Lange summarizes Artie Lange's Beer League as "what would happen if the Bad New Bears grew up and became insane alcoholics and joined a softball league."

The movie, which opens today, follows the exploits of a ragtag team of players who are more interested in tapping kegs than fielding grounders. "I've played in a beer league for years," Lange says. "You always want to win a game, but beer helps you deal with life." Although the 38-year-old Lange has had recurring television roles on Mad TV and Norm, as well as bit parts in such well-received movies as Old School and Elf, he's best known as the substance-abusing, working-class sidekick on Stern's show. "Because of Howard, I'm able to really [promote] this film," says Lange. "We're a $3 million movie with a small distributor, but we have the awareness of a large studio film."

In Beer League, Lange plays Artie DeVanzo, an unemployed loser from New Jersey, who gathers a bunch of pals for an annual softball tournament against longtime rivals. "These are guys who take it a little too seriously," Lange says. "It's just a slice of life from Jersey." Karate Kid Ralph Macchio co-stars as one Lange's teammates, all of whom are way their athletic prime Â— Lange's DeVanzo takes the field in corduroy pants. "I actually played with a guy like that," Lange laughs.
