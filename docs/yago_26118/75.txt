Plot

"Beer League" is a comedy about Artie DeVanzo (Artie Lange), an unemployed underachiever who still lives with his mother and plays in a small town softball league in New Jersey with his rag-tag group of misfit friends. Artie's team faces off with their rivals, headed by Dennis Manganelli (Anthony DeSando), and the two rivals do more fighting than playing. When Artie's team is threatened with permanent expulsion from the local league after being jailed for yet another fight on the field, they must rally and move from last place to 2nd - in one brief season, while Artie tries to hold on to the only woman who loves him for who he is.
