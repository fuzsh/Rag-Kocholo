Black 'N Blue apparently never actually disbanded, but rather were on a long hiatus. However, "Hell Yeah" is their "reunion" studio record, outside of a one-off show that was recorded and released in the 1990's. The band initially reunited in 2003 to record this album, but it wasn't finally released until 2011. "Hell Yeah!" does not feature guitarist Tommy Thayer who has been off playing the part of Ace Frehley with Kiss. Shawn Sonnenschein was the new lead guitarist to be featured on the album in Thayer's place.

The album opens with a balls-to-the-wall heavy rocker titled "Monkey." Had the band's debut or "Without Love" featured a song with this much sweat and muscle I can't imagine they would have been ignored. Meaty guitar licks driven by a steady rhythm section and St. James' nasty vocals. This song goes back to the roots of Black 'n Blue's sound. "Target" likewise keeps up the momentum. This rock and roll song has a bit of a Kiss vibe to it. "Hail Hail" is a fun rock and roll anthem. It's a bit on the cheesy side, but who doesn't like a big old hunk of cheddar every now and then? "C'mon" is an upbeat rock and roll anthem as well. "Fools Bleed" is the obligatory ballad, however I like this particular ballad. The first half of "Hell Yeah" is solid.
