A couple years later, in 2001, as the gathering had become an annual event and the number of friends grew year over year, Rockin' the Rivers was born.\n\nRockin' the Rivers is still held in that same field were the first gathering was held and is now known as \"The Bridge\" after an old truss bridge was moved on to the property over a decade ago.\n\nWith permanent festival infrastructure now in place, the field looks a little different but Rockin' the Rivers is still hosted in that same field were the first gathering was held.\n\nNew partners have come, old ones have left but through it all, Rockin’ the Rivers has remained true to the idea of bringing excellent classic rock to the masses in a 3-day festival format."
