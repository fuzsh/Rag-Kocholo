        "text": "Discography:\n\n1984 – Black ‘N Blue\n\n1985 – Without Love\n\n1986 – Nasty Nasty\n\n1988 – In Heat\n\n1998 – One Night Only: Live\n\n2001 – The Demos Remastered: Anthology 1\n\n2001 – Ultimate Collection\n\n2002 – Live In Detroit – 1984\n\n2005 – Collected\n\n2007 – Rarities\n\n2011 – Hell Yeah!\n\nHistory:\n\nBlack ‘N Blue were melodic pop-rockers that were labeled to be the “next big thing” in the mid ’80s, but despite having a loyal fan base, they never broke through commercially.\n\nThe group was formed by Jaime St. James (vocals), Tommy Thayer (guitar), Jeff Warner (guitar), Patrick Young (bass) and Pete Holmes (drums) in Portland, Oregon in 1981. By relocating to Los Angeles, they made their debut on the first Metal Massacre compilation with the song “Chains Around Heaven”, before landing a major label deal. The band opened for KISS in 1985, and was able to reach a much larger audience, yet it failed to translate into sales for the boys. KISS bassist Gene Simmons even produced the In Heat album, but even that couldn’t sell the band to the public, and by 1989, the group had disbanded. The lack of a hit single seemed to be the missing ingredient for this hard rocking quintet. By opening for some of the biggest names in the metal scene, the band was able to sell roughly a million units of their albums, but with expectations so high, that just wasn’t enough.\n\nAfter the group’s demise, St. James recorded with Freight Train Jane, Dry Rot and St. James. Thayer went on to record with Doro, Harlow and Shake The Faith. Holmes would form Monster with some ex-Malice members.\n\nBlack ‘N Blue reformed in 1997 for a show that would be recorded and released as One Night Only – Live. The band would once again reform in 2003, with Shawn Sonnenschein brought in by Young and Warner to fill in for Thayer (who went on to play lead guitar and the Space Ace character in KISS) and the group began working on a new album. A big break came to St. James in 2004 when he replaced Jani Lane as the frontman for multi-platinum rockers Warrant. After St. James‘ stint in Warrant ended in 2008, Black ‘N Blue eventually released the album Hell Yeah! in 2011. The guitarists in the band have changed over the years since then with Brandon Cook replacing Warner on rhythm guitar in 2013 and taking over the lead guitar duties after Sonnenschein was reportedly fired shortly after the Monsters of Rock Cruise in October 2016. Bobby Capka was brought in to play rhythm guitar in 2017 and was replaced by Doug Rappoport in 2021. Thayer and St. James released a five-song EP titled The Lost Tapes in 2022, which consisted of songs that they wrote together around the end of 1988.\n\nBlack ‘N Blue is yet another band that just didn’t get the recognition they deserved.\n\nTRACK LIST AND BAND MEMBERS PER STUDIO ALBUM:\n\nBlack ‘N Blue (1984):\n\n01.
