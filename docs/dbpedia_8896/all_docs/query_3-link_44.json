Black & Blue’s dense, buttery, and stark white interior is as gorgeous to look at as it is to savor—with exactly the right amount of sweetness, making it appealing to just about any level of blue cheese fan.",

        "text": "Our fresh goat milk is first pasteurized and cooled. Cultures are added and the milk is agitated. We then add vegetarian rennet and the curds are on their way. Once the curds are cut and stirred, this cheese becomes a w-o-r-k-o-u-t. The curd is scooped and piled in the center of the vat, pressing under its own weight and creating a channel around the circumference of the vat for the whey to drain. Once drained, the pebbly curd is scooped by hand into molds.\n\nThe cheeses in their molds are stacked for a gentle pressing and flipped regularly to ensure even draining. Left overnight, the following day our cheese makers dry salt the wheels and put them into the special “blue room.”After the first signs of blue-mold growth, we “punch” them with stainless steel needles to promote mold growth and optimal veining."
