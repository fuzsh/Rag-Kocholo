        "text": "Despite being one of their best albums, the songs from Between the Buttons [UK] get no airplay, don’t get played live and are absent from the band’s many compilations.\n\nI would suggest BETWEEN THE BUTTONS, because it's an artistically successful pop album that's almost erased from their legacy as a hard rock touring machine, in comps and on stage.\n\nI think The Rolling Stones proved they weren't just a blues-based rock band. I thought they were good at writing music that were on the baroque pop and psychedelic rock style.\n\nRolling Stones No.2, I dont think you could even buy it on CD until the Mono Box came out in 2016.\n\n10 weeks at No. 1 in the UK and was pretty much unavailable for 25/30 years.\n\nEasily available on CD from Japan for several years.\n\nUndercover.\n\nI know it's an unpopular opinion, but I consider it great. I think of it as part of another unique run for the Stones ... Some Girls, Emotional, Tattoo, then Undercover.\n\nBlack and Blue is also overlooked, imo.\n\nMy choice as well. A demonic folk-rock album with great arrangements and clever songs. Probably the pinnacle of The Stones’ pop period.\n\nIn general, I think most of their pre-Aftermath albums are nearly forgotten.\n\nBut for a band with so many albums (24 European albums & 26 albums in the United States, plus dozens of compilations, singles, boxed sets, live albums & deluxe editions) it’s of course hard to keep track. And it’s probably also the reason why many people assume they have only made 5-6 great albums, because it’s the easy way out to say so or because it’s the general thing to read, even though 9 out of 10 people haven’t heard all albums.\n\nUndercover...still one of my favorites. \"It Must Be Hell\" is a keeper.\n\nI think the problem with Satanic just like many groups at the time the album is very experimental but forming into an acceptable song form is lacking a lot on this album.\n\nUndercover — I love this album, and it has some of Mick Jagger’s best lyrics. This album can’t stand next to their great albums (the Stones were far past their prime), but I think it’s a really good album.\n\nThe first one, Buttons and Black N Blue.\n\nI think all three are under appreciated or overlooked. Maybe Black N Blue doesn't belong as people are pretty divided on it whereas the other two just seem forgotten or not mentioned at all.\n\nIt seems like everyone has an opinion on Satanic so while not loved by some or most it's definitely not overlooked.\n\nI could be mistaken but they've played \"Out Of Time\" and \"Let's Spend The Night Together\" live in the last few years."
