Keeping a viable platform for bands and people in the culture to experience what’s been a big part of many of our lives is really important. The old Ritz is a fitting venue for Burn to bring the energy we were known for in the past.”\n\nSays Burn guitarist Gavin Van Vlack: “We’ve been approached to do this for well over a decade and it never felt like it was the right time. Finally the stars have aligned at a time when it all feels so right; where the pure desire that Chaka and I have to play these songs has come to fruit. It’s an honor to work with Black N Blue as well—they’ve put so much blood and sweat into supporting this culture of ours. Excited would be a massive understatement about how I feel about doing this.”\n\nAn updated flyer and info can be found below as well as the Convoy Films produced trailer here;\n\nSaturday, May 16th 2015\n\n—\n\nTHE REGULATORS\n\nDarryl Jenifer + Dr. Know + John Joseph + Mackie Jayson\n\nMembers of Bad Brains + Cro-Mags Performing Bad Brains\n\nCANDIRIA\n\nMADBALL\n\nTURNSTILE\n\nEARTH CRISIS\n\nSUBURBAN SCUM\n\nRUDE AWAKENING\n\nAGENTS OF MAN\n\nKING NINE\n\nTHE WILDING INCIDENT\n\nDEVIL IN ME\n\nBOOZE & GLORY\n\nMIZERY\n\nSunday, May 17th 2015\n\n—\n\nBURN\n\nSpecial Guest Exclusive Appearance\n\nCRUMBSUCKERS\n\nSICK OF IT ALL\n\nTHE RIVAL MOB\n\nFURY OF FIVE\n\nEXPIRE\n\nDAVE SMALLEY\n\nPerforming Dag Nasty + All + Down By Law\n\n100 DEMONS\n\nWISDOM IN CHAINS\n\nBITTER END\n\nHEAVY CHAINS\n\nFREEDOM"
