        "text": "Put your running shoes on and join EVOLVE at their first community event of this year on January 29. Tickets for this event are brought to you by the Ticket Fairy.\n\nEVOLVE is a non-profit mental health and wellness organization founded and created by Laura Parent. The educator behind this organization is Bianca Stefina. It was launched in January 2022, and they held their first annual 5K run for a purpose on January 29 in Windsor. This year, EVOLVE returns with the second annual run/walk for a purpose at Assumption Park, North Pavilion, from 10 AM onwards!\n\nThe community is known to host multiple charitable events in a year to raise funds for cause. In May 2022, EVOLVE organized a 5K & Rosé Community Event at Paglione Estate Winery. The ticket to this event included a bottle of rosé as well as donations to local mental health organizations.\n\nThe first annual mental health gala – a night about people networking with one another and fundraising to support mental health, took place on October 1, 2022. This event included raffle prizes, live music, motivational speakers, dinner, DJ performances, and more. They collectively raised over $11,300 at this event.\n\nProviding “self-care and therapy to Windsor-Essex individuals” and filling “three pantries for Windsor-Essex community homeless shelters” are some ways EVOLVE has helped its community.\n\nYou May Also Read: 5 Music Concerts Held for Charity in 2022\n\nEVOLVE also offered a free youth workshop in July last year in which the youth could learn resume building, communication skills, practical skills, interview skills, and also leave with a cover letter. Another free workshop was held that month called ‘Social Media, Technology & My Teen’ wherein parents, caregivers, and others could learn “how to navigate social media and internet addiction” with their teens, the risks of different apps, and much more.\n\nThey collected new or gently used hats, scarves, mittens, and socks that were donated to the shelter to keep everyone warm in the winter. November 2022 saw ‘BREWS WITH BROS – Sweat and Socialize For A Cause’ a donation-based workout “in support of Movember and Men’s Mental Health with Evolve.”\n\nTickets for the upcoming second annual 5K run/walk for a purpose include local wellness goods, EVOLVE reusable tote bags, hand warmers, and post-walk/run coffee.\n\nGet tickets for EVOLVE’S 2ND ANNUAL 5K FOR A PURPOSE at Ticket Fairy: HERE\n\nFind Evolve on: Instagram\n\nYou May Also Like:\n\n5 Movies You Should Watch on World Health Day\n\nRock Musicians That Talk About Their Mental Health"
