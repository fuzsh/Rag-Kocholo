        "text": "A new addition to our website will be a series of short biographical articles on local Bahá’is\n\nThanh Truong – artist, poet, author, and musician\n\nHeroically\n\nLook!\n\namid the cracked, baked earth\n\nunder the scorching sun\n\nwho can believe\n\na green sprout\n\nheroically springs!\n\nThanh\n\n* “All we need now is LOVE“.\n\nThanh writes about how he became a Bahá’i and why it is important to his life ” Many years ago in the early nineties, when I was in the Philippines Refugee Camp, I had Ms. Aun, as my English teacher, she was dedicated a Baha’i and had weekends sessions about the Faith. I was one of the attendees and impressed by her devotion and about the ideals of the Faith.\n\nWhen I arrived in Lacey in February 1992, the first one who came to visit me was a Baha’i in Lacey named Renee Stout. Later, I happened to know Charlotte Cureton and later, Leo & Joyce. Finally, I then belong to Lacey Assembly hosted by Lonnie and Dan Locke. I’ve admired and impressed by the Race Unity and Mankind-Is-One Ideal of the Faith and the harmonious way of life of the Baha’is, since.\n\nMy “Silkworm of Poetry” is a collection of my ‘world view’ about different people and different subjects and events. I consider I am ‘silkworm’ who has consumed much of life-nutrition, now I need to give back something to life. I hope with the silk-material that I gave out, in some way, some how, will be a piece in making of the ONE big gorgeous silk-cloth of life.”\n\nThe Old Calligraphist\n\nEvery time Lunar New Year comes\n\nwhen the blossoms bloom\n\npeople again see the old calligraphist\n\ndisplays red papers written in black ink\n\nparallels of stylish word characters\n\non the busy street pavements\n\nof passers-by\n\nACCEPT OUR APOLOGY\n\nto KIKI and her generation\n\nYou, our younger generation\n\naccept our apology\n\nand forgive us\n\nfor leaving you with an ugly heritage,\n\nfull of environmental destruction.\n\nWe down forests, burn coal\n\nto produce more pollution,\n\nto the point that the\n\nland becomes dry,\n\nsea becomes hurricanes,\n\nair becomes soot.\n\nThe greed and craziness\n\nof a few put suffering on so many.\n\nA few countries become too rich;\n\nso many become too poor.\n\nA few individuals become billionaires,\n\nbillions of others become empty-handed.\n\nThe eyes become blind\n\nthe minds become thickened\n\nthe on-going-destruction is considered a hoax!\n\nSo wicked to the point that\n\nthe young generation has to stand up,\n\nto condemn\n\nto ask for immediate action\n\nto save humanity.\n\nYounger generations:\n\naccept our apology\n\nand forgive us.\n\nWe feel very ashamed\n\nwe feel very guilty\n\nUnfortunately\n\nthere are a few who don’t care,\n\neven if they are the responsible ones\n\nBut let us not care\n\nlet us:\n\n” fight for the right\n\nwithout question of pause”\n\nWe all are with you\n\noh beloved generations.\n\nTogether we rise!\n\nTogether we demand!\n\nOct 03’19"
