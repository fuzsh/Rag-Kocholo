As a youngster, her playtime was always centered on running games and\n\nswimming. At 13, she took to tennis.; \"When you run or swim you don't have\n\nto think about what you're doing. But in tennis, there is a mental challenge.\n\nYou always have to be thinking about strategy, what you need to do to win and\n\nbe able to adjust your game as you go through the process.\" After a few\n\nlessons, she played pretty well.; She'd taken quite a few lessons by the\n\ntime she entered high school. While playing competitively during the school\n\nyear, she also ran and worked out with weights. Every summer, she attended\n\ntennis camp and swam.; All was fine for a while with her routine at the\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley. She was playing intramural tennis three\n\ntimes a week, swimming laps, using her bike for transportation and running\n\nfour to five miles on pavement four times a week. In spite of discomfort in\n\nher ankle, she continued running until \"incredible shooting pains\" forced her\n\nto seek medical attention. It took two surgeries, casts, crutches and nearly\n\nfour years before her rehabilitation from what turned out to be stress\n\nfractures was complete.; And it was another two years before she developed\n\nthe confidence to step on the court again. To deal with the disappointment,\n\nshe swam six days a week during her long recovery. \"It got awfully old not\n\nbeing able to do what I wanted to do, but at least I had that.\"; REGIMEN:\n\nGoldfarb returned to tennis a year ago and has been playing four times a week.\n\nA \"power player\" and a \"hard hitter,\" she says she prefers a singles match\n\nbecause she gets a better workout. She and her United States Tennis\n\nAssociation A-ranked women's team won a divisional championship recently. \"The\n\ncompetition is very local for now.\"; She takes an aerobics class once a\n\nweek and, to give her body a break from her high-impact activities, she still\n\nswims a mile once or twice a week and enjoys bike riding with friends on\n\nweekends.; RESULTS: Goldfarb hasn't quite shaken the fear that she could\n\nre-injure her ankle. \"But I've learned to listen to what my body tells me. And\n\nno more running for me. I used to enjoy it, but now I don't even want to\n\ntry.\"; GOALS: \"To play tennis consistently and avoid mistakes.\";\n\nOBSTACLES: \"When I take the game too seriously and feel bummed after losing a\n\nmatch, I have to remind myself how lucky I am to be playing again.\" Also\n\nfrustrating, she says, is getting tied up at work and having to miss a planned\n\nworkout.; TIPS AND COMMENTS: \"I like to swim and bicycle, but what I like\n\nthe most is tennis.\" If she had to give it up, she'd replace it with other\n\nactivities -- like more swimming and bicycling, she says, because, in addition\n\nto staying healthy and feeling fit, working out is her favorite way to have\n\nfun and make friends. </TEXT>\n\n<BYLINE> -- Sue Chenoweth </BYLINE>\n\n<COUNTRY> USA </COUNTRY>\n\n<EDITION> Morning Final </EDITION>\n\n<CODE> SJ </CODE>\n\n<NAME> San Jose Mercury News </NAME>\n\n<PUBDATE> 910724 </PUBDATE>\n\n<DAY> Wednesday </DAY>\n\n<MONTH> July </MONTH>\n\n<PG.COL> 3E </PG.COL>\n\n<PUBYEAR> 1991 </PUBYEAR>\n\n<REGION> WEST </REGION>\n\n<FEATURE> PHOTO </FEATURE>\n\n<STATE> CA </STATE>\n\n<WORD.CT> 567 </WORD.CT>\n\n<DATELINE> Wednesday July 24, 1991\n\n00206103,SJ1 </DATELINE>\n\n<COPYRGHT> Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News </COPYRGHT>\n\n<LIMLEN> 1 </LIMLEN>\n\n<LANGUAGE> ENG </LANGUAGE>\n\n</DOC>\n\nQid: 360 Rank: 5 Score: 11.216800\n\n<DOC>\n\n<DOCNO> SJMN91-06054196 </DOCNO>\n\n<ACCESS> 06054196 </ACCESS>\n\n<CAPTION> Photo; PHOTO: Allison </CAPTION>\n\n<DESCRIPT> SPORT; BRIEF </DESCRIPT>\n\n<LEADPARA> Noureddine Morceli, the sensational 20-year-old Algerian, made a serious run\n\nat the world indoor mile record, but settled for meet and track marks in\n\nwinning at the World Indoor Track and Field Championships Friday night in New\n\nYork.; Morceli led throughout the race and was on pace to break Eamonn\n\nCoghlan's world record of 3 minutes, 49.78 seconds going into the final\n\nquarter mile. </LEADPARA>\n\n<SECTION> Sports </SECTION>\n\n<HEADLINE> MORCELI MISSES IN BID FOR INDOOR-MILE MARK\n\nALLISON GAINS SECOND POLE OF THE SEASON </HEADLINE>\n\n<MEMO> Sports Digest </MEMO>\n\n<TEXT> But without anyone to push him, he slowed and finished in 3:52.99.; In\n\nanother meet highlight, Lance Deal shattered the world indoor record in the\n\n35-pound weight throw twice, reaching 79 feet, 3 3/4 inches on his final\n\nthrow.; MOTOR SPORTS: Davey Allison made it two for two this season in\n\nNASCAR Cup Series qualifying by wheeling his Ford to the pole for Sunday's\n\n400-mile race in Richmond, Va.

She played varsity basketball as a freshman, pitched\n\nand played shortstop for the softball team and would have loved the\n\nopportunity to excel at track and field, she says, because she loved to run.\n\nBut the school didn't have a track. During the summer she worked as a\n\nlifeguard, taught swimming and competed in springboard diving.; Except for\n\nintramurals, sports were on the back burner during college because \"my\n\ndemanding English major required reading too many books and writing too many\n\npapers.\" But during the summers, while her friends were working as waitresses,\n\nshe used the facilities at the swim and tennis club where she worked.;\n\nBefore returning to school to earn a second degree in journalism, Apichell\n\ntaught high school English, coached basketball, ran in 5K and 10K races and\n\nplayed rugby for the University of Maryland for eight years. She also taught\n\nfreshman English at the University of Florida, where she played rugby, took up\n\ntriathlons and competed in co-ed soccer.; It was \"all soccer\" when she moved\n\nto California in 1983 and joined an over-30 women's team. Because the goal of\n\nthe team was to win the national cup, they averaged three two-hour practices a\n\nweek year-round. And many of the practices were preceded by four-mile runs to\n\nwarm up. In 1988 they made it to the national tournament, but lost by one\n\ngoal.; As new teammates in their early 30s seemed to be getting \"younger and\n\nfaster,\" Apichell started looking for new outlets. While phasing out soccer,\n\nshe found \"bicycle heaven\" in the Bay Area and has been riding and running\n\never since. The past year, she completed about 10 100-mile century rides and\n\nplaced in several biathlon competitions that combine running and bicycling.;\n\nREGIMEN: When employed, Apichell ran three to four miles every day during her\n\nlunch hour and rode her bike in the evening until sundown. Now that it's dark\n\nin the evening, she has upped her daytime distance to six miles and has\n\nreplaced cycling in the evening with a few hours of tennis. Weekends are still\n\nthe same, she says -- bike rides of 40 to 60 miles each day along steep routes\n\nthat include Page Mill and Kings Mountain roads, Tunitas Creek and Mount\n\nTamalpais.; RESULTS: Being in good physical condition has carried over\n\nmentally and spiritually, she says. \"My health is excellent, my self-esteem is\n\nhigh and, when I go into a job interview, I feel confident and proud of my\n\nabilities.\"; GOALS: To win a biathlon -- because second place is not good\n\nenough -- and to be able to finish all five mountain passes in the 147-mile\n\nMarkleeville Death Ride in May. \"And I've always wanted to try kayaking.\";\n\nOBSTACLES: \"Sometimes I wish I had a buddy to run or bicycle with regularly.\n\nBut the independence is nice. I have from sunrise to sundown to plan my\n\nworkout.\"; TIPS AND COMMENTS: \"I am not a quitter. Sports has taught me to\n\nhang in there until the whistle is blown. I don't give up.\" </TEXT>\n\n<BYLINE> Sue Chenoweth </BYLINE>\n\n<COUNTRY> USA </COUNTRY>\n\n<EDITION> Morning Final </EDITION>\n\n<CODE> SJ </CODE>\n\n<NAME> San Jose Mercury News </NAME>\n\n<PUBDATE> 911225 </PUBDATE>\n\n<DAY> Wednesday </DAY>\n\n<MONTH> December </MONTH>\n\n<PG.COL> 4E </PG.COL>\n\n<PUBYEAR> 1991 </PUBYEAR>\n\n<REGION> WEST </REGION>\n\n<FEATURE> PHOTO </FEATURE>\n\n<STATE> CA </STATE>\n\n<WORD.CT> 586 </WORD.CT>\n\n<DATELINE> Wednesday, December 25, 1991\n\n00360027,SJ1 </DATELINE>\n\n<COPYRGHT> Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News </COPYRGHT>\n\n<LIMLEN> 1 </LIMLEN>\n\n<LANGUAGE> ENG </LANGUAGE>\n\n</DOC>\n\nQid: 360 Rank: 7 Score: 9.793530\n\n<DOC>\n\n<DOCNO> SJMN91-06136168 </DOCNO>\n\n<ACCESS> 06136168 </ACCESS>\n\n<CAPTION> Photo; PHOTO: Connor plays tennis against younger men every weekend. </CAPTION>\n\n<DESCRIPT> FITNESS; PROFILE </DESCRIPT>\n\n<LEADPARA> AGE: 72; HEIGHT: 5-feet-10 1/2 </LEADPARA>\n\n<SECTION> Living </SECTION>\n\n<HEADLINE> BILL CONNOR </HEADLINE>\n\n<MEMO> Health &amp; Fitness\n\nHow I Stay Fit </MEMO>\n\n<TEXT> WEIGHT: 170 pounds; PERSONAL: Married 48 years.

When we didn't have enough\n\nmoney, we'd ride our bikes like hell for 20 miles to get there instead.\";\n\nHe's never been a speedster, he says, but he's been active and competitive\n\nthroughout his life in many sports -- with one exception, the time his B-17\n\nwas shot down during World War II and he spent nine months in a German prison.\n\nNormally, he played touch football on weekends and did a lot of snow skiing\n\nwith his family. But when a two-man volleyball game in the sand \"ruined my\n\nweekend\" 26 years ago, he decided his physical routine was insufficient. He\n\nstarted running in the mornings and felt a tremendous difference right away,\n\nhe says.; REGIMEN: Connor is still running 2 1/2 to three miles starting at\n\n5:15 a.m. When he gets home, he does 200 strokes on a rowing machine, a series\n\nof sit-ups, leg-ups, push-ups, stretching exercises, a weight routine with\n\n40-pound barbells and by 6:10 he's in the shower.; Connor started playing\n\ntennis at 50. \"I play every chance I get, and every Saturday and Sunday\n\nmorning with a group of younger guys.\" He's a proficient skier who, since the\n\nage of 66, has won gold, silver and bronze medals -- plus a few personal\n\n\"crash and burn awards\" -- in NASTAR downhill racing. He says he's only a\n\nrecreational swimmer, but he placed first in 50-meter freestyle swimming and\n\nsecond in tennis in the Palo Alto/Stanford Senior Olympic Games two years\n\nago.; \"Alcohol makes me feel like I'm pulling a trailer,\" he says, so he's\n\ngiven it up.

He lives in San Jose.; OCCUPATION:\n\nProfessional tennis player; FITNESS BACKGROUND: While growing up in a house\n\nnext door to the Los Altos Golf and Country Club, Simone says he loved to\n\nwatch people play tennis. At age 7, he got his turn with a racket he retrieved\n\nfrom a trash can there. For the next two years, Simone collected tennis balls\n\non the courts in exchange for lessons. He played well in all the sports\n\noffered in school, he says, but during the summers he lived on the tennis\n\ncourt for 4 to 6 hours each day.; \"I always felt there was something\n\nspecial about me as an athlete,\" says Simone. And it was confirmed when he was\n\noffered a scholarship after his junior year in high school to Florida's\n\nprestigious Bollettieri Tennis Academy -- \"a concentration camp,\" he says,\n\nreferring to its intense program.; After graduation from high school, he\n\ncompeted in the French circuit before returning to California to continue his\n\neducation. At Foothill College he was part of the second-ranked doubles team\n\nin the nation among junior colleges. This impressed the University of Arkansas\n\nand earned him another scholarship. Simone was there a year, earning A's and\n\nB's and juggling his studies, his sport and his social life, when he decided\n\nto quit -- temporarily -- a year short of earning degrees in philosophy and\n\npsychology in order to pursue tennis professionally.; For the past year and\n\na half, he has competed in satellite circuits throughout the United States and\n\nabroad. His goal is to qualify for the Volvo men's tournament in San Francisco\n\nnext year. He's currently ranked 787th in the world.; REGIMEN: After a\n\nstretching and stationary bicycle workout at an athletic club six mornings a\n\nweek, he's on the court by 9 a.m. for 2 1/2 hours of tennis. He spends two\n\nhours, three afternoons a week with his coach in San Francisco. And when he\n\ngets home, he runs five to seven 6-minute miles around a track. (If he's\n\ntired, he slows his pace to a 7- or 8-minute mile.) An hour of weight training\n\nat the club on alternative days is followed by speed and balance drills on the\n\ntennis court with an aerobics teacher. Because the sport is so intense, he has\n\nstarted practicing yoga to learn to relax. He sleeps from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m\n\nduring the week, but on Sundays, \"My racket and tennis shoes are locked in the\n\ncloset!\"; RESULTS: \"I feel like a gladiator with a net. Everything is in\n\nbalance physically, mentally, nutritionally and holistically and I am ready to\n\nwin.\"; GOALS: \"To play center court against the top seed at Wimbledon.

But because I have pushed myself to the limit many\n\ntimes, I know what my body can do and when it needs a rest.\"; TIPS AND\n\nCOMMENTS: \"My full-time love and commitment is to tennis for now.

Whitney run.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nNow he wants to visit Panama for a 50-mile race alongside the canal.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"That's the kind of thing I'm looking for, something different,\" said the\n\nFountain Valley man who started competitive running only three years ago, about\n\nthe same time that he was divorced.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"I had to do something to use up my energy,\" said Germany-born Ankenbrand, who\n\nclaims he never participated in sports as a youngster. Or for that matter,\n\nuntil he was 30 years old.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"I was always working and never had time for sports,\" he said in a thick German\n\naccent.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nBefore his current job as food services director for El Acanto Convalescent\n\nHome in the City of Industry, Ankenbrand worked as a chef at some of the\n\nleading hotels in Europe.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"I got tired of working nights and weekends. It didn't leave much time for\n\nother things,\" said the one-time food services director at Cal State Long\n\nBeach, where co-workers urged him to try long-distance running.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nAnkenbrand had been playing seven sets of tennis every Sunday for 20 years with\n\nthe same partner (Don Ogden of Orange), \"so they thought I was in good enough\n\nshape to run a marathon.\"\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nThat was three years ago and without much training, Ankenbrand has run in 16\n\nmarathons in an average time of 4 hours and 10 minutes, finishing them all.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nBut he has cut his tennis playing to only five sets each Sunday, noting that\n\n\"tennis is now my second sport.\"\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nUnlike other marathoners, who run upwards of 100 miles a week, \"I don't like\n\nregimented workouts. Maybe I'm lazy,\" he said, noting that he runs only 20\n\nmiles a week, in training or not.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nHowever, at this point in his life, Ankenbrand is getting bored with marathons.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"It's no longer a challenge,\" he said, pointing out that 90% of all marathon\n\nrunners finish.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"I need something more challenging,\" said Ankenbrand, who has run the Los\n\nAngeles and Long Beach marathons and two 50-mile races this year.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nThat was the reason for the 146-mile Death Valley run last month.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"It was my most challenging race and there were times when I wanted to stop,\"\n\nhe admits. \"The heat was up to 115 degrees and I had so many blisters on my\n\nfeet.\"\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nSome of the other runners in the international field of competitors dropped\n\nout. Most of the other athletes were in their 30s.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"I was hurting and my body was telling me to quit, but I had the determination\n\nand will power you get from maturity,\" he said. \"I just kept going.\"\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nIt's that philosophy that keeps Ankenbrand running.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"You have to have a positive attitude,\" he said. \"It has never occurred to me\n\nthat I would not finish a race.\"\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nAnd now, Ankenbrand said, all his races will be 50 miles or longer and he feels\n\nhis age is not a factor.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\n\"I'm 49, but I think of myself as younger than that,\" he said. \"The number 49\n\ndoesn't mean anything to me. It's just a number.\"\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nAnd just to prove it, he plans to compete in a triathlon in August, the\n\n100-mile Angeles Crest Trail Run in September and the San Juan 50-Mile Trail\n\nRun in November.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nAnkenbrand has also learned that rewards are not substantial for long-distance\n\nrunning.\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n\nHe received a T-shirt for finishing the 146-mile Death Valley-Mt.

He's also joining _ albeit with not quite as much\n\nfanfare _ the exploding number of older Americans who compete in\n\nage-group sports.\n\nThe attraction is simple: try your hardest, be your best, and in\n\nfive to 10 years be reborn into an older group. Masters swimmers,\n\nfor example, compete in five-year intervals up to 90-94. The United\n\nStates Tennis Federation sanctions matches for men 85 and older and\n\nwomen 75 and older. Age-group competitions also are organized in\n\nbicycling, track and field, marathons and triathlons.\n\nThe system encourages older Americans to keep competing, because\n\nat least once every few years they get to be the youngest kid on\n\nthe block.\n\n``You like to come in at the bottom of your age group and blow\n\nthem away,'' said Dr. George McVey, 62, of Rochester, N.Y., who has\n\ncompeted for 17 years in masters swimming and has been\n\ninternationally ranked in the breaststroke.\n\n``It's amazing _ the condition of these people,'' he said of\n\nthose attending national masters swim meets.\n\n``Seventy-five-year-olds can go up and down the pool like you\n\nwouldn't believe.''\n\n``A couple of years ago, our oldest category was 50-plus,'' said\n\nGary Scott of Triathlon Federation@USA. ``Now it's 70-plus.''\n\nThese older triathletes aren't running mini-events, either. They\n\nare in the same grueling races attempted by athletes 50 years their\n\njunior.\n\n``We had one 64-year-old woman who finished in a decent time at\n\nthe Ironman,'' Scott said. ``She beat a lot of men in their\n\nthirties.''\n\nThe Ironman is one of the world's most prestigious triathlons,\n\nheld in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, each year. The woman, Joanita Reed of\n\nSan Antonio, swam a 2.4-mile ocean race, cycled 112 miles over\n\nhills and ran a 26.2-mile marathon, all in the same day. She\n\nfinished in 14 hours, 31 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\n``We have experienced a dramatic increase in masters riders in\n\nthe last five years,'' agreed Kyle Woodlief, spokesman for the\n\nUnited States Cycling Federation in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Our\n\noldest licensed racer is 93.''\n\nThat rider, Fred Knoller of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Fla.,\n\ncompeted in the U.S. Nationals from 1976 to 1985, when he was 89.\n\nKnoller has stopped competing but is still a big fan of the move\n\ntoward smaller age-group categories.\n\n``When I was in my 50's, I was still racing against\n\n40-year-olds,'' he said. He keeps his membership to get the\n\nnewsletter and find out how friends are doing. ``Some of these boys\n\n60, 65, are really good. Real pros.''\n\nLast June, the cream of American senior athletes gathered to go\n\nfor the gold in St. Louis, at the U.S. National Senior Olympics.\n\nThe 3,452 athletes, ranging from 55 to 91, earned the chance to\n\ncompete through strong performances at qualifying meets, where more\n\nthan 100,000 seniors tested their mettle.\n\n``You know the saying, `If you don't use it, you lose it,'' said\n\nSylvia Auerbach Swartz, 77, who with her sisters Rose, 74, and\n\nPearl, 68, earned 12 medals at the Senior Olympics. ``It's\n\nimportant not to let the joints get stiff. You've got to keep them\n\ngoing.''\n\nSwartz, of New York, said a youthful diet of volleyball,\n\nsoftball, basketball, lacrosse and speedball, along with some\n\nmiddle-aged tennis and ping-pong laid the base for her success.\n\nMedals in field events came from weekly training, pointers from\n\nlocal coaches, and encouragement from her sisters.\n\n``We don't compete against each other, though,'' she said.\n\n``That's why we are still talking.''\n\nAt the VIII World Veterans Championships last summer in Eugene,\n\nOre. _ billed as the largest track meet in history, former Olympic\n\nathletes faced top-flight but unknown competitors from around the\n\nworld. Many of the 4,950 athletes produced times and distances that\n\nwere the talk of the meet.\n\nPaula Schneiderhan of West Germany produced a world record in\n\nthe womens' 65-69 200-meter sprint with a time of 31.65 seconds.\n\nAlthough seniors are still a rather small segment of the sports\n\npopulation, one industry expert says when they do enjoy a sport,\n\nthey go at it with gusto."
