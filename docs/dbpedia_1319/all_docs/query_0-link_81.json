The study is concerned primarily with the inter- national fronts, but it should not be forgotten that the activities of these affect vitally the activities of the national affiliates, which are in their own right important elements of the national Communist movement in their respective countries. Where possible, the material has been organized into four sections. The first lists activities which have taken place during 1958 or are scheduled to take place during the remainder of the year, and in some cases in 1959. The second category, \"Proposed Activities\", lists activities of considerable impor- tance, but which for one reason or another have not been scheduled as to time or place. The third section discusses changes and developments in the programs of the fronts, i.e. in the broader aspects of their policies and activities. The fourth section, \"Organizational Notes\", describes significant changes and policy factors concerning the organization and personnel of the fronts. Activities in the first section are in most cases arranged chronologically, except (for example in the WIDF-IUS Section) where a geographical or functional breakdown will better The International Medical Association (formerly the World Congress of Doctors) is omitted because it has been almost completely inactive recently. A section is added on the Union of Soviet Societies of Friendship and Cultural Rela- tions with Foreign Countries.

Many front activities have a double (or triple) aspect: they may, for example, be spon- sored by WFDY especially to attract Afro-Asian youth, but may do so in the interest of the Soviet \"peace\" campaign run chiefly by the WPC. Although an attempt has been made to avoid duplication, it has occasionally been considered advisable to list the events under more than one category. The more important meetings and activities are empha- sized by full capitalization. 2 S-E-C- -T Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 1958 has been a very active year for the international Communist fronts. It may also prove to have been a critical turning point in their development and employment by the Communist movement. The many-faceted unity-of-action campaigns developed over the past years have, since Novem- ber 1957, converged and merged in direct support of the central Soviet political offensive in the \"struggle for peace\", as defined in the two manifestos issued in Moscow on the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution in November 1957. This effort by the fronts during 1958 has had three aspects: support and encouragement of anti-colonialist national liberation movements; opposition to nuclear weapons tests, missile bases, and collective defense arrangements between Free World states, on the premise that they increase the risk of war; and promotion of the idea that the United States is aggressive and the primary threat to peace, free- dom, and international prosperity. The major international front organizations have worked more closely with one another than ever before, particularly in support of the WPC's peace campaign. As of mid-1958 there was abundant evidence that the fronts were evolving two distinct versions of the peace campaign--one directed in the main at the countries of Western Europe and the Anglo-Saxon nations, and another directed at the Afro-Asian and Latin American regions. Each treats all three of the main issues, but with a significant difference in emphasis. To the West, the stress is on describing \"preconditions\" for peace and the threat (and consequences) of war; to the Afro-Asian and Latin American areas emphasis is placed upon defense against S-E-CT Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 alleged Western aggression, support for national liberation movements, national economic development programs, and peaceful coexistence. In both, the role of the United States as the main obstacle to peace is energetically developed. To an ever-increasing extent the Afro-Asian area appears to be the prime focus of the front campaigns, followed closely by Latin America. The emergence of the Permanent Secretariat of the. Afro-Asian Solidarity Council in Cairo and of a coordi- nating board for the peace movement in Latin America expresses these priorities organizationally. The program for the Afro-Asian area has been focussed around three major campaigns: (1) opposition to \"economic neo-colonialism\", including the promoting of nationalization of foreign-owned enterprise, combined action to discourage Afro- Asian trade links with the West, encouraging oppo- sition to the European Common Market and the Eurafrica plan, and urging resistance to new for- eign capital investment in private enterprise; (2) support for national liberation of colonies and- recovery of \"alienated\" territories such as Goa, \"West Irian\" (Netherlands New Guinea), etc.; (3) encouragement of that version of Afro--Asian unity in which the Soviet bloc countries of Asia would be accepted as full and equal partners, entitled to pref- erential political, cultural, and economic treatment. Since May 1958, the first two campaigns have been steadily integrated into the general peace campaign of the fronts and the Soviet bloc governments. The international fronts have, in developing these campaigns, engaged in three kinds of organized effort toward Afro-Asia: 4 -E- -T Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 SE (1) expanding the international role and activities of their Afro-Asian affiliates and leaders through the organization of special gatherings, the assignment of major organizational tasks to them, and the holding of broad meetings in which maximum Afro-Asian participation is invited and publicized; (2) inspiring, supporting, and participating to the greatest extent possible in joint activities sponsored by unaffiliated Afro-Asian bodies of similar character; (3) publicizing and supporting Afro-Asian aims and aspirations in Western areas and in bodies such as the UN Specialized Agencies, where such support is most likely to be appreciated by the Afro-Asian peoples. Under the first heading are included such events as the meeting of Afro-Asian delegates at the World Peace Confer- ence in Stockholm in July, and the inclusion of substantially increased numbers of Africans and Asians in the executive bodies, editorial staffs, and international delegations of the fronts. Efforts to organize separate Afro-Asian gatherings under direct sponsorship of the major international fronts, often attempted in the past, have now apparently been dropped. Under the second heading, the creation of the Afro- Asian Solidarity Council and Secretariat in Cairo appears to be of critical importance. Since May 1958 in particular a series of Afro-Asian gatherings have been announced from Cairo by regional preparatory groups in which, without exception, Chinese affiliates of the international fronts are represented. These include projects for Afro-Asian confer- ences of youth, women, and economic organizations. Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Under the third heading come the many appeals in support of Arab unity and Algerian liberation, etc. , directed by virtually all the fronts to the United Nations, and their support for such projects as Algeria Day (30 March). As of July 1958, front: affiliates from the Bloc were openly and directly providing well-publicized material assistance in the form of funds, medical and relief supplies, and medical care for the Algerian national liberation movement. In general, the program in Latin America follows the lines outlined in the foregoing pages concerning the Afro- Asian area. Efforts are being made to increase the effec- tiveness of this program, which so far lacks many of the dramatic features of recent events in the Middle East, by calls for solidarity between Latin America and the Afro- Asian areas. The similarity of the problems of the two areas is being highlighted, and contacts between front personalities from both are being stimulated through such devices as cam- paigns against US intervention in the Middle East. The intensification during 1958 of international front sponsorship and financial support of travel and bilateral contacts by personnel of national affiliates has been largely concentrated on Afro-Asia and Latin America. Material assistance to both affiliated and unaffiliated groups through the rejuvenated or newly-e stabli shed International Solidarity Funds, and to a lesser degree, intensified leadership training programs, have also been focussed in these areas. The program for Western Europe has, on the \"peace\" theme, centered on antimilitarism, opposition to German military resurgence, the genetic hazards of nuclear explo- sions, the horrors of war, and the economic consequences of large defense expenditures. On the anti-colonialism theme, it has advocated, non-intervention in the Middle East, popu- larized the trade advantages to be derived through accommo- dation with Afro-Asian nationalism, agitated against the Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Eurafrica plan, and against the suspension or alleged violations of civil liberties in colonial territories. The anti-American theme has been developed by attributing to the United States the prime responsibility for the courses of action condemned under the two main themes described above and by parallel campaigns against U.S. racial dis- crimination and the behavior of U.S. military personnel in Europe. A tactical development of interest in the peace campaign for Europe is the trend toward the exploitation of bona fide gatherings and activities of pacifist, religious, and scientific groups. As of mid-1958, there was evidence that the Peace movement anticipated difficulties in carrying on its activities overtly and was encouraging its national affiliates to create new groups to carry on the various aspects of its program. In the following paragraphs there is presented a summary of the activity and direction of each of the major fronts during 1958, with some analysis of the significance of each. These analyses are followed by sections dealing in detail with each international Communist front organization. The World Peace Movement pressed to the fullest extent the propaganda advantage it gained from the Soviet announce- ment that atomic bomb tests would be stopped in the USSR. Much emphasis was placed in various World Peace Council publications and meetings on the power of \"public opinion\" (an expression abundantly used in the Peace Movement) to bring pressure on the United Nations to act towards ending atomic tests as well as to achieve the other \"peace\" campaign objectives--a Summit meeting, denuclearized zones in Europe and Asia, elimination of military pacts and bases, 7 5-E- - -T Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 admission of Communist China to the United Nations, non- intervention in the Middle East, making the Baltic a \"Sea of Peace\", peaceful coexistence, and increased cultural and economic exchanges between the Free World and the Soviet bloc countries. The WPC resumed its open partisanship of Soviet policies --moderated for a while in a weak attempt to appear non-partisan--and returned to open attacks on the United States as the root of all evil while avowing that the Soviet Union makes good, constructive suggestions acceptable to all peace-loving people. One of the objectives that has for years motivated the extensive WPC anti-colonialist campaign was also brought into the open at the Stockholm Conference in July. Many of the prominent delegates declared upon their return to their respective countries that the World Peace Movement would. in the future be indissolubly linked with the movements for national \"liberation\". KUO Mo-jo, Chinese peace leader, went so far as to say that the WPC had almost wandered into the path of \"unprincipled pacifism\" in the past but had corrected this (implied) deviation by its actions at Stockholm. Greater effort on the part of the WPC was expended in \"colonial'a.reas of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Mem- bers of the Secretariat were sent to these areas to direct the work there, trips were made to further the revival of dormant peace committees, and reorganizations were made under new names where the peace committees were overly exposed as Communist-dominated, such as the Colombian Institute for International Cooperation. In this, certain parallels to the campaign in Western Europe can be observed. Public claims that the World Peace Council and the International Institute of Peace (IIP) are separate organiza- tions have almost ceased. The Organizing Committee for the Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 S-ESE-T Stockholm Conference of the WPC was openly set up in Vienna at the UP headquarters, meetings of the WPC took place there during the year, and members of the Secretariat when queried about plans for WPC headquarters replied that it would be in Vienna. Generally speaking, the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and the International Union of Students (IUS) appear to regard their organizational fortunes as having improved since early 1957. They weathered the repercus- sions of youth unrest in the Soviet bloc, particularly in Hungary, aided by the Suez Crisis and by the Moscow World Youth Festival. They exploited the Suez Crisis by waging an all-out propaganda campaign of \"outrage\" over imperialist aggression against Egypt, just as they are now exploiting the current Middle East crisis. In doing so, they sought, with some success: (a) to divert world attention from the position of youth within the Soviet bloc and from the WFDY-IUS betrayal of Hungarian youth in particular; (b) to recover some of their lost prestige by portraying the WFDY-IUS as ardent \"champions\" of nations struggling to retain or gain their independence; and (c) to stimulate widespread interest in and support for local and national Festival preparatory and \"report-back\" activities, and large-scale Free World participation in the Moscow World Youth Festival itself. Both the WFDY and the IUS were organizationally strengthened by these world-wide activities and by the suc- cessful convocation in Moscow of their jointly-sponsored Sixth World Youth Festival in July-August 1957. The pro- Soviet propaganda impact of the Festival on some 20, 000 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 non-Bloc participants * and 743 foreign correspondents was heightened by the apparent absence of controls and restric- tions (which were deliberately relaxed or suspended during the Festival) and by the carefully contrived, dramatic mani- festation of the Soviet Union's interest in peaceful coexist- ence generally, and, more specifically, in the problems of the non-Bloc participants. Most favorably influenced were the Festival participants from the underdeveloped areas, who were flattered by the red-carpet treatment given them personally and the importance and attention given to problems of burning concern to them. They were also more impressed with the visible signs of Soviet social and economic progress than were participants from the industrialized and more highly developed areas of the world. Moreover, the psycho- logically favorable reaction to the Soviet technical achieve- ment in launching the two \"sputniks\" in the fall of 1957 served to stimulate Free World youth's interest in the Soviet Union, which the WFDY-IUS exploited. Today the political climate and exploitable issues are more conducive to broad unity-of-action and mass support of the WFDY and the IUS among Free World youth than in early 1957. This is particularly true in the colonial and under- developed areas of the world. Consequently, both the WFDY and the IUS, in an effort to reap all benefits possible, have expanded and diversified their announced programs of action for 1958 so that they cater to virtually all special needs and varying interests of young people in each country and region. All affiliated organizations have been urged to broaden as widely as possible their relations with members and non- member national and international organizations, through About 7, 500 of these were from the target areas--i.e. the areas of primary interest to the Soviets from the stand- point of infiltration, gaining influence, etc. 10 S -E -C - Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 direct contacts and bilateral and multilateral exchanges, in order to assist the WFDY and IUS to secure the closest possible cooperation with such organizations. Emphasis has been placed by WFDY and IUS on stimulating and supporting activities that serve as a \"bridge\" and draw bona fide groups into desired contact with the WFDY and IUS. Great effort is being made to build up large cadres of leaders in each specialized field of youth and student organi- zation work from the local to the international level. To provide affiliated organizations with greater assistance in improving their work and increasing their effectiveness, the WFDY and IUS are also bringing more \"leaders\" to their central headquarters for guidance and discussions and are sending more of their own officials on prolonged field trips to meet with local leaders and activists and provide them with \"on-the-spot\" advice and assistance. Such visits also pro- vide them with an opportunity for transfer of necessary funds with which to carry on local operations. Moreover, material and financial assistance by WFDY and IUS to affiliates appears to be on the increase. International exchange of correspondence is also being heavily pushed by the WFDY and IUS, with particular directives issued to maintain correspondence contact with all persons who attended the Moscow World Youth Festival or took part in any of its preparatory activities. Organizationally, the WFDY and the IUS have the pros- pect of extending their influence in the Afro-Asian world as a result of the Cairo Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference's decision to establish a regional organization for youth, with affiliates throughout the area. Both WFDY and IUS were officially represented at this Conference by observers and have officially supported implementation of the Conference's Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 decisions. WFDY now claims to have 94 affiliates in the Afro- Asian region with a combined membership of some 35 million young people. (It is assumed that Communist China, North Korea and North Vietnam are included in these figures, and represent the overwhelming majority of the claimedmem- bership. ) The WFDY and the IUS are utilizing preparations for the Seventh World Youth Festival in late July 1959 in Vienna to strengthen themselves organizationally. Many local, national and regional Festival \"preparatory\" committees created for the Moscow Festival have continued to function and, in many cases, have become \"permanent\" bodies. On 20 May 1958 the Executive Board of UNESCO recom- mended that the UNESCO General Conference reject the latest WFDY and IUS applications for consultative status. In their concerted drive for UN recognition of some sort, both WFDY and IUS are seeking to establish closer working relations with other Specialized Agencies of the UN, such as FAO, WHO, ILO, etc. Looking to the future, their affiliates have also been instructed to do everything possible to demonstrate sup- port of UNESCO and build up documentary proof of their good faith and eligibility for status. Support of the Soviet Peace offensive and the champion- ing of the national liberation and anti-colonial movements constitute the major propaganda efforts of the WFDY and IUS. As a result, particular targets a.re youth and student organi- zations in the underdeveloped and colonial areas of the world, as well as overseas student organizations. 12 5-E- --T Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 During the past year the following factors have played a significant role in helping the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) extend its influence: (1) increased organizational activity generated among WIDF affiliates throughout the world at all levels in preparation for the Fourth WIDF Congress, held in Vienna, 1-5 June 1958, and in implementation of its program; (Z) more direct guidance and assistance given key leaders of WIDF affiliates not only by the WIDF but also by experienced functionaries of the WIDF affiliates; (3) greater effort by WIDF to stimulate national and regional activity, as well as to expand bilateral and multilateral exchanges and assistance of all types; (4) increased indoctrination and formal and informal training of leaders of women's organizations not only by the WIDF but also by its affiliates; (5) more tailored propaganda materials provided to WIDF affiliates, as well as financial and material assistance needed to publish and disseminate their own propaganda. In addition, improved coordination and implementation of WIDF policies and programs is expected to result from the more frequent contacts and discussions WIDF representatives have with key women leaders at the many national and inter- national meetings they attend, as well as from the decision of the WIDF's Permanent International Committee of Mothers (PICM) in February 1958 to establish nine permanent regional representatives for liaison with women's groups in their respective areas. S -E -C - - - Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 S-EZ\\JL-_E-T The WIDF's major propaganda effort for the \"defense of women and children\"- -like that of other international Com- munist fronts--is in support of the Soviet peace offensive and the championing of national liberation and anti -colonial move- ments. However, the WIDF supports these and other pro- Soviet political objectives by couching WIDF propaganda in terms emotionally appealing to women and by tailoring the propaganda to the specific problems, grievances, aspirations and fears of women in specific target countries and areas. This permits maximum impact of such propaganda locally and helps bring growing success to local campaigns for unity of action on matters of mutual concern. This is particularly true in Japan and other countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, in which the WIDF and its PICM claim to have gained many affiliates since 1957. Twelve organizations in these areas are reported to have either joined the WIDF, or expressed an interest in doing so, since 1957. Unidentified organizations in twelve countries--at least seven of which are in these areas--reportedly affiliated with the PICM since 1957. The WIDF has officially endorsed the decisions of the December 1957 Cairo Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference and urged implementation of the resolutions concerning women and child welfare programs. It will probably also support and exploit the Afro-Asian Women's Conference, scheduled to be held in Cairo in late 1959. Carmen Zanti, WIDF Secretary General, attended the Cairo Conference as an official observer for WIDF. Should any new local or regional Communist-front organizations for women emerge in Asia and Africa, it is expected that such fronts will be closely linked with the WIDF; the initiative in their formation will be taken by women active in WIDF affiliates, probably in the Arab world.

At the Asian-African Women's Conference in Colombo in February 1958 the first concrete steps were taken to counter Communist efforts to exploit the legitimate aspirations of women in these areas. During 1958 the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) called upon its affiliates to participate actively in numerous situations of a strictly political nature. The major WFTU propaganda effort in 1958 was in support of the Soviet \"!peace\" campaign. This propaganda program was adopted by the WFTU at its 4th World Congress held in Leipzig, East Germany, in 1957. Resolutions adopted at the 17th Session of the Executive Committee (30 March - 2 April 1958) spelled out the general tactics to be followed by the WFTU and its affiliates in carrying out this campaign. Two regional meetings, the European Trade Union and Workers Conference Against the Threat of War and for Peace, Berlin, June 1958 and the First Workers Conference of the Baltic Countries held in Rostock, July 1958, were conducted by the WFTU to implement the \"Peace\" propaganda theme. The Administrative Committees of certain Trade Union Inter- nationals of the WFTU reiterated the propaganda themes in resolutions adopted at their meetings and published such statements in their respective TUI Bulletins. The present focus of WFTU activities on the Afro-Asian area sterns also from the 4th World Congress of that organization in October 1957. At that time M. Sugiri, a former head of the Foreign Relations Department of SOBSI (the Indonesian trade union organization) was named as Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 WFTU Secretary in charge of the Afro-Asian Section of the Department for Relations with National Centers. The 4th Congress also adopted a resolution calling for the creation of an International Trade Union Committee for Solidarity with Algerian Workers. This resolution called upon all trade unions to make 15 November 1957 a day of action and struggle under the slogan \"National Independence and Peace in Algeria\". The Executive Committee at its 17th Session, 30 March - 2 April 1958, invited. national trade union centers to set up an International trade Union Committee for Solidarity with Algerian Workers and further recommended that all trade unions support the Algerian people. The WFTU reported in its World Trade Union News of 16-30 June 1958 that the Soviet trade unions had sent clothing, food and medical supplies for the Algerian rebels through the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions in Cairo. The FDGB (Communist-controlled trade union federation) of East Germany was reported to have sent similar consignments to the Algerian Red Crescent. In addition East Germany was reported to have received wounded Algerian rebels. Contri- butions from. Czech trade unions were forwarded via the Red Cross of Czechoslovakia. WFTU preoccupation with Afro-Asian affairs was also indicated in resolutions adopted at the 17th Session of the Executive Committee which pledged support of the Permanent Secretariat for Afro-Asian Solidarity. At the same time all trade unions were called upon to support the struggles of the peoples of Indonesia, Cyprus and South Africa. The First World Trade Union Conference of Young Workers sponsored by WFTU in July 1958 adopted resolutions Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 (1) opposing American-British intervention in the Middle East, (2) expressing solidarity with the peoples of Cyprus, (3) opposing atomic tests in the Sahara, (4) supporting the unification of Korea and the independence of the Cameroons (French), and (5) demanding amnesty for political prisoners on Madagascar. The 18th Session of the Executive Committee in July 1958 was devoted entirely to the question of the Middle East Crisis. During 1958 assistance was forwarded by the International Solidarity Fund to trade unions in Ceylon, Australia and Tunisia, still another indication of WFTU interest in this area. In order to increase the number of its adherents, the WFTU has devoted a major portion of its organizational effort during 1958 to the over-all program of trade union unity. At the 17th Session of the Executive Committee Louis Saillant, Secretary General of WFTU, outlined the steps necessary to achieve trade union unity as follows: (1) Unite the workers in each country and help them to unite with all social sections who are actively working for peace. (2) Be at the head of every mass struggle and every decisive action to achieve peace objectives. (3) Increase the exchange of fraternal delegations. A second major attempt by the WFTU to win new adherents was its campaign to win the support of young workers. After Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 nearly two years of preparation the First World Trade Union Conference of Young Workers was held in Prague in July 1958. Lazaro Pena, a WFTU Secretary, in addressing the Conference pointed out that young workers represent a considerable portion of the total labor force and that the labor movement could by their action acquire new forces capable of removing old prejudices standing in the way of trade union unity. A third organizational development, although not directly a part of WFTU activity, should not be overlooked--the direct Soviet contact with non-Communist trade unions. Early in 1958 V. V. Grishin, Chairman of the All Union Central Council of Trade Unions, was reported as stating that it was necessary \"to extend friendly contacts with trade unions of the capitalist and colonial countries. \" This policy was implemented by the travel of high-ranking Soviet labor leaders to Egypt, Finland, France and Uruguay in the first half of 1958. Since the heads of Soviet delegations are usually important figures in the WFTU, this tactic will probably lend prestige to the WFTU organizational efforts in the countries visited by the Soviets. The Afro-Asian Solidarity Council has, as of mid-1958, become active, with Soviet bloc support, in organizing gatherings of youth, women's, and economic groups. With the exception of the national Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees already operating in the area, and such Egyptian bodies as the Supreme Council of Youth Welfare, other national bodies likely to support these initiatives have not yet been identified. The national affiliates of the established international fronts are, however, expected to concentrate on encouraging and participating in the work of new national preparatory 18 5 -T Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 ST committees for Afro-Asian gatherings and on pressure campaigns to induce national governments to support the programs and resolutions advocated by the regional gatherings. In this effort, the results of such official gatherings as the Conference of Independent African Countries (Accra, 15-22 April 1958) will be exploited by the fronts. National non-Communist mass organizations will be encouraged to cooperate with the major international fronts. Where significant resistance is encountered, components of these national groupings will be encouraged to affiliate with the fronts. Close bilateral relationships with Bloc affiliates of the fronts are also being encouraged, and it is likely that the most effective Communist-dominated affiliates in the Afro-Asian world--such as the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indonesian trade union organization SOBSI, etc. --will expand their external activities along these lines as well. It should be noted that in spite of many past efforts by Bloc trade union grganizations to create an Afro-Asian regional trade union organization, this field is the one in which the international fronts have so far been least successful. However, with the present more radical Communist attitude on the question of national independence for African colonial territories, including support for opposition forces in countries with pro-Western governments, and support for Arab nationalist unity, pro-Communist trade union leaders in these territories may be able to enhance appreciably their influence in the national trade union movement and liberation movement. In the more stable independent countries of Africa and Asia, they are likely to encounter, however, increased governmental resistance to the extension of Communist influence in the national trade union field through these tactics. 19 5-E- - Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 The prospects for Communist success in these front efforts are good in the African colonies, reasonably good in the Middle East, and fair in South Asia. Their principal advantages in the independent countries of the area are likely to be the general fear of war and reluctance' to risk alienating the Soviet bloc. A significant vulnerability of the front campaign in the more mature Afro-Asian countries arises from the vigorous Communist campaign against Yugoslavia and revisionism, since a number of key collaborators of the fronts, particularly in South Asia, appear to have been alienated as a result of these campaigns. However, while the Yugoslavs and their collaborators oppose both certain aspects of the Soviet bloc concept of the peace campaign and of the proper course to be followed in national economic development of underdeveloped countries--both central issues of the front programs--their vigorous anti- colonialist stand on such questions as Western military intervention in the Middle East and Algerian independence has obscured the critical questions likely to embarrass the Moscow/Peiping-directed fronts. The more radical Soviet bloc attitudes toward national liberation struggles in Africa may also prove of overriding importance in that area. Continued cooperation and support for front activity by at least one major independent Afro-Asian government- -like that rendered to the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference by the Egyptian Government--is indispensable for further Communist success in exploiting Afro-Asian aspirations and issues. The World Federation of Scientific Workers (WFSW) tried, as it had done for the past two years, to regain \"respectability\" and become eligible for consultative status in UNESCO, in which it already has \"informal relations.\" (It was recommended in May 1958 by the UNESCO Executive Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Board that the current application be rejected; if the UNESCO General Conference concurs with the rejection, the application may, however, be brought up again in two years.) To this end members have been instructed to avoid any action that mgith be interpreted as political, biased or partial to socialist countries. The organization went so far as to decline cooperation with the WPC in connection with the World Confer- ence for Disarmament and International Cooperation held in Stockholm in July 1958, the first time full cooperation with the WPC had not been given. Activities will, at least outwardly, be based on strictly scientific subjects but a great many of these subjects will be in the realm of sociology-- i.e., the rights, wages, conditions and living standards of scientific workers, and their training. Actually, the only scientific subject of apparent interest to this organization is atomic energy, and it may be expected to take full advantage of the Soviet \"line\" in this field. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL) is seeking to regain its lost prestige, especially in Western Europe, and to forego (or at least to conceal) its former preoccupation with defending or ignoring injustices in the Soviet bloc countries. However, it will continue to condemn and criticize every legal action in the Free World against blocking the spread of Communism or its activists. ,It may also be expected to give a great deal of attention to aiding developments in \"colonial\" and \"semidependent\" countries leading toward the fulfillment of Soviet ambitions. While admitting it has been too occupied with political affairs in the past, the IADL is now busily building up a line of argument that political and legal matters are closely connected and cannot be considered basically as separate matters. The International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) has continued to develop its activities in connection with its Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 \"unity-of-action\" campaign. These activities have consisted of increased propaganda and visits of delegations, and the active support and promotion of international and regional conferences of journalists. These tactics have enabled the IOJ to achieve some measure of success in broadening its influence among journalists. Increased activity by the International Broadcasting Organization (OIR), started in 1957, has continued into 1958. Prior to 1958 only one non-Communist country, Finland, was represented in the OIR. The OIR therefore was not so much a \"front\" as it was an outright Communist organization. This f-act rendered less effective its efforts to promote Soviet propaganda objectives, and also handicapped the OIR in developing relations with other broadcasting organizations. To overcome this isolation the OIR has proposed that UNESCO consider convening an international conference of existing broadcasting organizations, and has also proposed a joint conference with the European Broadcasting Union. Addi- tionally, the OIR has proposed the creation of a new world organization attached to UNESCO in which it would be a founder member. To gain respectability and acceptability among non- Communist broadcasting organizations the OIR has adopted a posture of moderation in its propaganda and has devoted more attention to the purely technical aspects of radio and television development. The uncommitted countries of Asia and Africa appear to be of particular interest to the OIR and increasing attention is being devoted to these areas.

It FIR's activities are directed toward mobilizing public opinion and other resistance organizations against these allegedly-existing menaces, and particularly against NATO which, according to FIR, is responsible for the alleged revival of German militarism and fascism. At the same time FIR actively promotes the Soviet \"peace\" objectives.

THE WORLD PEACE COUNCIL (WPC) A. ACTIVITIES HELD OR SCHEDULED 1. Day for Banning Nuclear Weapons, 1 March 1958. 2. World Peace Council (WPC) Bureau Meeting, New Delhi, 22-24 March 1958. This meeting was held primarily to prepare for the July Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation in Stockholm. Delegates from 29 countries were received by Prime Minister Nehru, and his relative Rameshwari Nehru, who is active in the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, addressed the meeting. Although the group had asked to be received, initial press reporting of the visit con- veyed the false impression that Nehru had addressed the body in its official capacity. The distortion was promptly corrected by an official government press release, which deplored the original tendentious news stories. Tass of 22 March reported that \"eminent Indian public and political ,leaders attended a reception for the delegates given by the All-Indian Peace Council.... Speakers at the conference stressed that many new groups, organizations and individuals had joined the struggle for peace in many countries... The session considered ways and means of bringing about an end to atomic tests, disarma- ment and a summit meeting....\" Three documents were issued at the meeting: a formal announcement of the Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation and its agenda; a condemnation Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 of foreign \"interference\" in Indonesia; and a call for Algerian independence and an end to the Algerian war. These documents paralleled in substance a speech delivered by Nikita Khrushchev on 14 March in which he invoked public opinion in support of Moscow propaganda objectives. It has been reported that there was considerable dissension at the meeting over the sharpness of the language of the resolutions on Middle East events. 3. Day of Solidarity with Algeria, 30 March 1958. Initiated by the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council; endorsed by the WPC, WFDY and WFTU; supported by national peace partisan organizations. 4. Establishment of the INTERNATIONAL CLUB IN BRUSSELS, April 1958. After the WPC was refused permission by the Belgian authorities to hold the World Conference for Disarma- ment and International Cooperation in Brussels during the World Fair, the WPC established an International Club there which served substantially the same objec- tives envisaged for the conference -- i.e. to contact visitors to the Fair and to attract delegates to the Conference (held in Stockholm). The Club was set up through the International Institute for Peace (IIP), the cover name of the WPC in Vienna since the offi- cial dissolution of its headquarters in that city in 1957. The IIP furnished a half-million Belgian francs, 260,000 francs of which was used to rent a hotel on the Avenue Louise. The remainder of the funds necessary was reportedly furnished by a \"non-profit organization\" headed by Baron Allard, a long-time Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 peace worker. The purpose of the Club was to afford peace leaders from all over the world the occasion to explain to the visitors to the Fair the aims, experiences and work of the World Peace Movement. Abundant WPC literature was available and \"peace\" concerts, soirees at which \"peace\" poetry and prose were read, films, performances by artists of various nationalities, exhibitions of paint- ings and photographs, discussions on \"peace\" sub- jects, and interviews with prominent personalities active in the Peace Movement were-scheduled. It was especially planned to invite prominent repre- sentatives of other international organizations to give lectures at the club -- such as the Quakers, the War Resisters, the United Nations Associations, The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Ghandist and Buddhist Associations. In addition to the social halls, there were rooms for guests and a restaurant. It was reported that many of the elab- orate plans fell short of their hoped-for results, that the Club was often empty, and that Baron Allard's group lost money on the venture. 5. ARGENTINE CONGRESS FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, GENERAL DISARMAMENT AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, Buenos Aires, 16-18 May 1958. The Congress was held in the Law School of the University of Buenos Aires. Use of the building was obtained from Risieri Frondizi, Rector of the Univer- sity and brother of the President of Argentina. The president was asked to open the conference but declined in a letter wishing it every success. On the opening day the official delegates numbered about 200 but the Young Democratic Progressive Party and the Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Young Intransigent Radical Civil Union sent 200 delegates to raise this figure to 400. Some of the meetings had an attendance of 1200 and representa- tives of over 70 groups expressed their support of the congress. Among these were schools, political parties, women's and youth groups, writers, law- yers, doctors, teachers, trade unions, cattlemen, and Catholic organizations. Much better organized than any previous peace congress in the Western hemisphere, this Congress was an outcome of the November meetings of Com- munist leaders in Moscow which issued instructions that the Peace campaign must be revived and stepped up in Latin America. Alfredo Varela, head of cul- tural affairs in the Vienna Secretariat of the WPC, was sent to his native Argentina to direct the prepa- ration and proceedings of the conference. James Endicott, President of the IIP and Vice President of the WPC, gave the keynote address (mainly an attack on the US). There are indications that a Latin American regional center will be organized with headquarters in Buenos Aires. The agenda and proceedings followed the traditional \"peace\" propaganda themes. US \"imperialism\", military bases, and economic subjugation of Latin America were roundly attacked. The emphasis was on economic matters in keeping with the current Soviet offensive on this subject. The proceedings took place in six commissions and many plenary sessions. Resolutions were passed on \"An Appeal to the Argen- tine People\", \"On Nuclear Tests and a Summit Conference\"; and \"Unity of Latin American Peace Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Forces.\" The Congress sent a Commission to deliver its resolutions to the Argentine President and presented to the Chamber of Deputies a project to end atomic tests. One of the resolutions that re- ceived no publicity clearly expressed the underlying purpose of the WPC to firm up the organization of the Peace Movement and to extend its influence in Latin America: \"Considering that the objectives of this Congress have stirred up the honest adherence of repre- sentative persons and organizations of many diverse tendencies belonging to the spheres of politics, economics, unions, sciences, universi- ties, youth, women, technicians, artists, and others of the country... that those different groups, many of whom have expressed previously and on their own yearning for peace, have had the opportunity of finding in this Congress and verify- ing that there are others of like aspirations; that the free, full and democratic debate here carried on permitted. . .the agreement synthesized in the fundamental conclusions of the Congress; that now those decisions, which demand the full par- ticipation of the inhabitants of our country, will be carried out in practice; that the agreement expressed here must be converted into joint action; The Congress... Resolves a. To constitute a Co-ordinating Board for International Cooperation, General Disarma- ment, and National Sovereignty charged with carrying out to the letter these decisions; b.

To invite all those patrons or adherents to this Congress to join, as have those who, without having done so publicly, concur in part or totally with these purposes. (sic) d. To direct the president of the Congress to adopt these necessary provisions so that the authorities of this board may be formed in the shortest time possible.\" 6. Women's Caravan of Peace to Alert People About Atomic Dangers, Spring-Summer, 1958. (See IV-A-lc) 7. WPC Session, Vienna, 31 May - 2 June 1958. Although called a World Peace Council session in a press interview held by the delegates, this was prob- ably only an \"enlarged\" Bureau meeting, as WPC sessions have increasingly become. The press con- ference was apparently held in the hope that it would create some publicity for the forthcoming Stockholm conference. Forthcoming scientific conferences, including the one being organized in Vienna by Prof. Thirring, were brought into the interview by WPC spokesmen, which was a further proof that this \"third Pugwash\" conference is indeed a target for the Communist front organizations. (See VI-A-4) The session issued an appeal to all people to send representatives to Stockholm in July and to free themselves from the \"hateful burden of armaments\", S-E-C_ Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 adding that cessation of bomb tests in the Soviet Union was not enough to stop tests everywhere. 8. Week of The Baltic Sea of Peace, 5-13 July 1958. (See also C-3 below) This designated week was one of a series of events in a campaign waged under the name of \"The Baltic, Sea of Peace\" which was extensively propagandized by the WPC. Some of the events were a peace confer- ence in Rostock of workers of the Baltic countries staged by seamen, harbor workers and ship builders of the area, a \"peace cruise\" along Baltic ports in a Russian ship rented by the Germans, a demonstration against NATO when that organization held a meeting in Copenhagen, increased \"friendship tours\" between Baltic countries, a WFTU-sponsored \"Conference of European Trade Unions and Workers Against the Threat of Atomic War and for Peace\", and an intensi- fied campaign against the construction of missile bases in the area. The purpose of this activity was to maintain and extend the sentiment for neutrality in the eight Baltic states. 9. WORLD CONFERENCE FOR DISARMAMENT AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, Stockholm, 16-22 July 1958. The WPC has held major biennial conferences since its formation, but had indicated at the last one (the Disarmament Conference held in April 1956 at Stock- holm) that these huge international events would be discontinued in favor of smaller regional conferences or \"joint\" meetings of one or more national peace committees to discuss specific problems. Isabelle Blume openly stated that the big congresses had S-E - Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 degenerated into tourist events. However, the value of the \"spectaculars\" must have been reconsidered, or else the Stockholm conference was planned as a climax to the massive, all-inclusive \"peace\" cam- paign of 1958 in which the Soviet and national Commu- nist parties have united their efforts. This whole campaign has been used extensively in WPC propa- ganda for the Stockholm conference -- the organized \"peace walks\" around the UN building in New York, to Washington, and to the Aldermaston atomic center in England; vigorous campaigns against missile bases in every region where these bases exist or are planned; the Soviet announcement that the USSR would stop atomic tests, followed by demonstrations, appeals, and meetings on the part of scores of Com- munist and front organizations and individuals demand- ing sirrdlar action by the US and Britain; and signature campaigns against atomic tests totalling millions of signatures. Linus Pauling, American scientist, sent to the UN a list of 9000 signatures of scientists from many countries protesting the tests and he also brought a law suit in a US court claiming genetic damage would result from such tests. Many non- Communists were drawn into this campaign, such as the Quakers who joined the peace walks and organized some of their own demonstrations. In preparation for the Stockholm conference, there were better prepared and more than usually publicized national peace con- gresses in every country where an active peace com- mittee exists. A new WPC bimonthly bulletin devoted exclusively to the conference was begun, and there was much travel by members of the Secretariat -- James Endicott toured Latin America, Fernand Vigne went to India and other Middle East countries, Jorge Zalamea went to Greece, Vincent Duncan Jones trav- eled to Canada, and Narain Malviya and Isabelle Blume S- Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 also took to the road in the conference's behalf. The other front organizations publicized the confer- ence, distributed its literature and urged full support for it, with the exception of the World Federation of Scientific Workers in which there is much dissatisfac- tion over internal Communist domination. The organ- ization is also seeking to regain consultative status in UNESCO which it lost because of its too-close Com- munist connections. The Organizational Committee for the conference was able to obtain the names of many non-Communists to use on its Sponsoring Committee of about 100: clergy- men, doctors, parliamentarians, writers, professors, trade union leaders - - among them Pastor Martin Niemoeller, Lord Bertrand Russell, Lord Boyd-Orr, George Branting, Rameshwari Nehru, Jean Paul Sartre, W. H. De Silva, Minister of Justice in Cey- lon, and several Nobel Prize winners. Although Bertrand Russell withdrew his sponsorship after the execution of Nagy, his name was used in reams of publicity about the conference. Counting on this meticulous preparation, the WPC proclaimed that between 2000 and 3000 people would attend the Stockholm Conference. However, there were only 1265 delegates, observers and guests in attendance, about one-third of whom were from So- viet bloc countries. Various factors may account for the attendance falling below expectation: (a) Former wholesale financing of delegates' expenses by the WPC apparently was lacking. While the national peace committees have always been urged by the WPC to raise as much of their delega- tions' expenses as possible, the WPC formerly stood Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 ready to pay the expenses of any useful peace worker or prominent guest whose name could be used for publicity. This resulted in a great many free trips for delegates from all parts of the world. For example, the WPC paid almost the entire expen- ses of over 500 delegates to the WPC Council meet- ing in Colombo in June 1957. This occurred at a time when the prestige of the WPC was at its lowest level due to its failure to protest Soviet aggression in Hungary and to the dissolution, as a legal entity, of its headquarters in Vienna, so there was great need for a good attendance. But many of the Western European peace committees reported that the WPC had declined to furnish any aid in financing their delegations to Stockholm in July 1958, and the number of delegates was consequently reduced. Practically all of the free trips supplied by the WPC went to target area countries in the Near and Middle East and Latin America. Under these circumstances, some of the national peace committees complained that the $11 per diem subsistence rate, in addition to the $10 registration fee per delegate,was more than they could pay. Aware that plans to attend were lagging, the WPC finally sent out letters to the national com- mittees offering subsistence rates of $6 and $8 per day with more than one person in a room. This lag in registration was probably also the reason for a letter from the IUS to its affiliates promising finan- cial aid to delegates to Stockholm if they were finding the money difficult to raise. In general, the WPC's requests for \"mass collection of funds\" -- with sug- gestions for the sale of postcards, badges, scarfs, and for contests, voluntary gifts etc. -- were much more urgent than had been evident for other confer- ences. The Peace Committee of the Soviet Union announced that for the USSR an account had been set Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 up in Moscow and local banks, to which sympa- thizers could send donations to the World Peace Fund. (b) The disillusion and disruption that have been prevalent in the Peace Movement since its dissension over the Hungarian revolution and the increasing awareness in many countries of the real nature of the current Soviet peace campaign are un- doubtedly influencing its ability to attract the huge crowds it formerly did. The Soviet-Chinese dispute with Yugoslavia over the latter's concept of the peace struggle undoubtedly has helped to bring this matter into focus. A significant illustration of this attitude is an editorial in the pro-Sukarno Indo Observer which declared: \"Congresses of the kind to be held in Stockholm have very little practical value. The grave questions scheduled for discussion in Stock- holm are too far-fetched for Indonesia, and we are afraid that the real purpose of the congress is polit- ical rather than peaceful.... Delegates to congres- ses of this kind are usually composed of neutrals, progressives, crypto-Communists or opportunists.... We wonder if it is necessary for Indonesians to dis- cuss these abstract problems which have no real practical value in our daily policy.\" Another case in point is that of the Swiss delegate, Villard, who told the conference that he had come with the understanding that objective criticism of a one violating peace would be permitted. \"It is not proper,\" he said, \"to address the multitudes through- out the world who are worried about peace when only American imperialism is discussed and only certain aspects of the Cold War are mentioned while those cases where the responsibility of other camps is T Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 involved are omitted. It is a denial of promises made before the Conference convened for opponents to be kept silent. . . . \" In this connection, an editorial by Pierre Cot in the WPC ideological magazine Horizons for July-August 1958 is very interesting. He emphasized how com- pletely different this WPC Stockholm conference would be from any preceding one; that it \"would be a complete expression of the world's opinion\", that \"unlike it has done heretofore, the WPC would per- mit a discussion of every side of every problem... Algeria, Lebanon, Cyprus, sentences executed by the Government of Hungary... all would be discussed ... all would be admitted as participants.... \" Actually Imre Kovacs and Bela Kiraly asked for per- mission to join the Conference and permission was refused to \"these traitor-politicians who fled to the West. \" Subjects that came up in the Commissions such as the Yugoslav delegate's cautious remark that the recent Soviet campaign against Yugoslavia was not conducive to peace, the Danish delegate's suggestion that the rights of conscientious objectors be made universal, the Iraqi's rejection of disarma- ment for the Arabs, and the Italian delegate's sugges- tion for abolition of capital punishment for political offenses, were not put to a vote. A Norwegian dele- gate's reference to the execution of Nagy was ruled \"out of tune with the mood of the Congress and seek- ing to stir up sympathy for the organizers of the counterrevolutionary uprising in Hungary. \" One of the first acts of the Conference was to issue a reso- lution branding the American \"invasion\" of Lebanon as aggression. This was the subject of many violent speeches. The other discussions and speeches fol- lowed the traditional lines in support of current Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Soviet objectives -- a Summit meeting (this Stock- holm conference was often referred to as \"the Sum- mit meeting of the people\"); disarmament; abolition of military pacts, bases, missile sites, military budgets and restrictions on trade; creation of neutral zones free of atomic installations in Europe and Asia, cessation of atomic tests; noninterference (by the US) in the Middle East and Asia; early re- unification of Korea and Vietnam; return of Okinawa to Japan, Goa to India, New Guinea to Indonesia; end to the cold war; cooperation and cultural ex- change between nations. Economic subjects were especially emphasized, particularly in a long speech by Oskar Lange (Poland) who, incidentally, revived the Malenkov thesis that an atomic war would wipe out humanity. The idea of a world economic confer- ence to discuss the problems of international eco- nomic cooperation was again brought up. The establishment of an economic commission to study pertinent problems was recommended. The Conference adopted a Declaration on Disarma- ment, a Message to the People on the Middle East situation, and an Appeal of the World Congress for Disarmament and International Co-operation. There was also an appeal to the UN demanding the with- drawal of interventionist forces, convening of a gen- eral assembly and a return to the procedures of the UN charter. Joliot-Curie proposed in his message to the Conference (he was not present, for reasons of health, and died 14 August 1958) that an international committee to study the problems of disarmament and international cooperation be established that could invite heads of government--to- take part in its meetings Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 in order to set forth their views and to report on measures taken by them to abolish the cold war. (This sounds like a reversion to certain remarks made by WPC officials early in the 1950's that indi- cated the WPC aspired to take on some of the work of the United Nations. ) There were many meetings at the Conference outside the regular work in the commissions and plenary ses- sions. Bilateral meetings were arranged between delegations; the Poles met the Argentine, Brazilian and Swedish delegations; a meeting took place between delegations interested in the \"Rapacki Plan\" for a nuclear.-free zone in Europe; the Afro-Asian delega- tions met separately; specialized meetings took place of teachers, young people, religious workers, scientists, etc. ; delegates from the Soviet Union, UAR, Czechoslovakia, Jordan, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia and West Africa met to discuss the preparation of the Afro-Asian Writers Conference to take place in October in Tashkent, USSR. The Conference elected a new enlarged World Council, including 467 specific individuals and 58 \"earmarked\" positions, to which individuals will subsequently be named. Twenty-four additional designations are also anticipated; total membership in the Council will therefore be either 525 or 549. The great majority of those elected were already Council members, but 138 new names were noted, and 106 members of the 1956 Council have been dropped. Joliot-Curie was re- elected president and 16 vice presidents were elected -- 10 of whom were already vice presidents (Isabelle Blume and James Endicott were named vice presidents in Ceylon in 1957 but their names appear on the new list because only a major conference is supposed to Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 elect the officers). The new vice presidents are Muhammad Kamil al-Bindari (UAR), Walter Friedrich (East Germany), Aleksandr Korneichuk (USSR), Velio Spano and Ferdinando Targetti (Italy), and Abu Mumuni (Senegal). Three places, it was announced, would be filled later, one from India. This is the first time India has had no vice president in the WPC. It is generally believed that Dr. Saifud- din Kitchlew, former Indian WPC vice president, has clashed with other WPC leaders in recent months and is being eased out. He has not been able to get along with Rome sh Chandra, the CP India militant in the All-India Peace Movement, so it is believed he will eventually be replaced on the Council and as Presi- dent of the All-India Peace Movement by Rajagopala- chari, a former Governor General of India. Eighty \"eminent public leaders representing countries of all continents\" were elected to the enlarged Bureau (names not yet available) and an 11-member Secretar- iat was formed (also unnamed) with Fernand Vigne as Secretary General. This title and function were eliminated when Jean Lafitte left Vienna in 1956 but has evidently been restored. It is a matter of con- jecture just what Jean Lafitte's position is in the Movement at present. An interesting assessment of the Conference was made by Jan Mukarovsky, Academician and Chairman of the Czech Peace Committee. In an interview published in Tvorba on 31 July entitled \"The Countenance of the Peace Movement and the Nature of its Work are Changing\", he said that the most important factor underlying the Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation was the full application at the Conference of the principle of the inseparability of the struggle for peace from the struggle for national Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 independence. Another factor, he said, was that a highly significant solidarity between nations fighting for their political and economic liberation was revealed at the conference. \"As far as the Czecho- slovak delegation is concerned, its deepest impression was evoked by the supremely friendly attitude of nations fighting for their liberation to our delegation and to the Czechoslovak people....\" In this same vein, KUO Mo-jo, leader of the Chinese delegation to the Stockholm conference, said to a mass rally held by the Chinese Peace Committee on 6 August in Peking, The Stockholm conference was the most success- ful and fruitful since the launching of the Peace Movement as far as opposition to US aggression and support for the anti-colonialist struggles are concerned. The Peace Movement has a history of 10 years, but its purpose and tasks have never been so clearly outlined and defined as on this occasion.... Where does war emanate from? -- obviously from the United States, the ringleader of the imperialist bloc.... To maintain the super-profits of a handful of monopolists, the US Government has carried out a policy of arma- ment expansion, war preparation, atomic war blackmail and 'brink of war' tactics. It has con- stantly aggravated world tensions so as to carry out its new colonialism... it uses the pretext of opposing 'Communist subversive activities' to disguise its grim features and to present itself as a benevolent savior to deceive people.... In the past 10 years the Peace Movement has been reluctant to show the US Government in its true colors; out of concern for our friends in the West, Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 it has hesitated to post clearly the question of opposing imperialist aggression and colonialism ...the Peace Movement has almost wandered on to the path of unprincipled 'pacifism'. At this Stockholm conference, however, US imperialist aggression was denounced in outspoken language and the anti-colonialist movement given firm support. We should record this as the greatest achievement of the conference.\" These views, together with other evidence, strongly suggest that the vacillation and indecision character- istic of Peace Council activities during the past three years have been brought to an end, with the Council now oriented to carry out its share of the tasks in the peace struggle envisioned in the 64-Party and 12 Party manifestos published in Moscow in November 1957. This new line brings the Peace Movement closer to the Communist parties of the Afro-Asian and Latin American areas, and suggests that the prospective loss of much support in the major West European countries as a result of the adoption of this more radical and aggressive line is viewed with equanimity. 10. An Italian Friendship Train left Venice 4 August 1958 enroute to the USSR. This trip, organized by the Italian Peace Council, as to go through Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland for a period of from 10 to 13 days. Itinerary A cost 104, 000 lire with a down payment of 10, 000 lire, the rest to be paid in 10 monthly installments; itinerary B cost 118, 000 lire with a down payment of 20, 000 lire, and included more territory.

FOURTH CONFERENCE AGAINST ATOMIC AND HYDROGEN BOMBS, Tokyo, 12-20 August 1958. Observance of the anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima began in 1955, the 10th anniversary. A National Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs began on the actual day, 6 Au- gust, on the first occasion. However, the 4th com- memoration of the anniversary convened a National Conference from 12-15 August and an International Conference from 15-20 August. Foreign delegates to the latter were urged to arrive in Tokyo to participate as observers during the whole period. The anniver- sary observance, obviously destined to be an annual affair, receives wholehearted support from all over Japan. However, the international conference usually fails to attract more than token support from the rest of the World Peace Movement. The close- ness of the date to that of the Stockholm conference occasioned some anxiety on the part of the organizer, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which issued an urgent invitation to the Stockholm delegates to come to Japan from there. Some of the Stockholm delegates followed the usual procedure of accepting tours of the Soviet bloc coun- tries and then continued to Japan. Another situation which had serious effect on the Tokyo conference is the current bad feeling between Japan and China brought about by the anti-Kishi cam- paign waged by the Chinese Government. The Chinese delegation has been an important element in the pre- vious conferences and reportedly none was to appear Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 at the 1958 meeting. An international preparation committee was set up in Tokyo 1 June 1958. Some of the committee members stayed on to form a secretariat for the conference. The WPC is always represented on this committee. This year its representatives were SATO Shigeo and Prince SAIONJI; the latter was recently transferred from the Vienna Secretariat to become the Vice President of the WPC Liaison Committee for Asia and the Pacific Regions with headquarters in Peking. Some 130 delegates from 35 foreign countries were expected to attend the conference, with 6, 000 Japanese delegates participating. The agenda included within its scope any question related to atomic dangers but specific subjects to be discussed were a) nuclear tests; b) introduction of nuclear weapons into foreign territories; c) the question of military blocs; d) question concerning military bases; e) questions of air patrols armed with atomic bombs; f) disarmament negotiations; g) non-aggression pacts; h) questions of non-nuclear zones; i) a summit conference. Again, as at Stockholm, the organizers promised \"The Conference will attempt to maintain its politically independent character. Domination. . by any one trend will be avoided by all means.\" It is recalled that the same promise was made in 1957, but the conference turned out to be so bitterly anti- American that an American pacifist who had attended in good faith walked out of it. Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Here again the intention of the WPC to tie the World Peace Movement \"inseparably\" to the national independence movement was evident. The WPC sent James Endicott and Fernand Vigne from the Vienna Secretariat to join SAIONJI Kinkazu and SATO Shigeo (already in Tokyo working with the international preparatory committee) for the special purpose of persuading delegations from the Afro-Asian bloc to attend the conference rather than the previous emphasis on attracting Western delegates. 12. WORLD CONFERENCE OF ATOMIC SCIENTISTS, Vienna and Kitzbuehel, 14-21 September 1958. (See VI-A-4) The WPC has been agitating for such a conference for several years. The International Institute of Peace in Vienna began propagandizing the confer- ence before it became firmly scheduled and has continued to do so in all of its publications. The IIP has also begun publishing a monthly bulletin on atomic dangers. 13. International Peace Conference, Oslo, 18-20 September 1958. This conference was organized by an independent Norwegian group called Uawhengig Norsk Gruppe (UNG). It tried very hard to gain labor support for the meeting whose announced purpose is \"to create public opinion for disarmament and the abolition of military bases and to strengthen the UN's ability to guarantee social, economic and political rights\". Carl Bonnevie heads the organizing committee. He was a delegate to the WPC Stockholm conference in July where he was called \"out of tune with the mood Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 -O 1 of the conference\" when he tried to protest against the execution of Nagy. Some of the organizations supporting the Oslo conference are Communist- infiltrated. 14. CONFERENCE OF AFRO-ASIAN WRITERS, Tashkent, 1-5 October 1958. (See also II-A-lb) An international writers conference has been a cherished objective of the WPC since 1951, with Soviet literary figures active in the Peace Movement playing a leading role in its promotion. The Asian Writers' Conference held in New Delhi in December 1956 was a step toward the realization of this WPC ambition. Non-Communist writers present at the New Delhi conference prevented that group from forming a permanent organization as its organizers had in- tended doing; they also prevented the scheduling of a second meeting of the group. However, immediately after the conference closed, it was announced that the Afro-Asian writers had accepted a Soviet invita- tion to hold a second conference in Tashkent, USSR. The project was brought up again at the Cairo meet- ing of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in Decem- ber 1957. A preparatory meeting for the conference was held in Moscow in June 1958 to which representa- tives came only from China, India, Japan, the UAR, and the USSR. This meeting decided to invite writers from Algeria, Afghanistan, Burma, the Cameroons, Ceylon, China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Mongolia, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAR, and USSR. European, American, and Australian writers were to be invited as observers. An Afro-Asian preparatory committee has been set up in Tashkent.

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF LATIN AMERICA, Buenos .Aires, 4-7 December 1958. The date and venue of this conference was decided upon at the Buenos Aires Congress of General Dis- Armament, International Cooperation and National Sovereignty in May 1958. It was also announced in a resolution of that Congress that \"the objectives and principles of the conference would be similar to those that inspired the Buenos Aires conference in . May 16. CONFERENCE OF THE AFRO-ASIAN PEOPLES' SOLIDARITY COUNCIL, Bangkok, December 1958. The Thai Government has reportedly given permis- sion to the Thai Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity to invite the Afro Asian Peoples' Solidarity Council to hold its second conference in Bangkok. The head of the sponsoring Thai organization was elected to the WPC Council at the Stockholm Conference in July 1958. An annual conference is mandatory in the statutes of the organization, which was organized under its present name last year in Cairo -- although there had been Asian Solidarity meetings prior to that date. 17. CONGRESS OF EUROPEAN INTELLECTUALS AGAINST ATOMIC ARMAMENTS, late 1958. This Congress -- not directly organized by but of interest to the WPC -- was to unite a new group of European intellectuals which has been in the process of organization in Germany, France, and Switzerland. Among them are Bertrand Russell, Jean Paul Sartre, and many other non-Communists, but the leadership, Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 especially among the Germans, is bitterly anti- American in sentiment and the announced objectives follow the Soviet line. The Federal Council of Switzerland decided to prohibit the meeting in Basel as originally planned, thereby causing a flood of protests to the Swiss Government by leftist news- papers and individuals in England,France, Germany and other European countries. It was announced that the meeting will be held later this year in either Britain or Germany. 1. Meeting of European Countries on the German Question, approved by the European Peace Commit- tees and coordinated by WPC. Planned but not announced. To be held in Europe. 2. Conference for Defense of Culture to coincide with next conference of the Organization of American States; planned by Latin American CP's. 3. Balkan Conference. Tentative effort was made to persuade the Yugoslav Peace Committee to initiate this conference. Although invited to resume affilia- tion with the WPC, the Yugoslav Committee so far has refused. (It was expelled from the WPC at the time of Tito's break with the USSR.) A suggestion to hold this conference was repeated at the Bulgarian National Peace Congress in June 1958. The proposed meeting would discuss (a) the development of friendly relations among Balkan nations; (b) the advantages of signing a pact calling for non-aggression and respect for sovereign rights of nations; and (c) ending all nuclear tests.

Plans for this conference admit it is preliminary to formation of an international Organization of Musicians for Peace along the lines of the British affiliate, Musicians for Peace. A much-discussed project that actually has never been scheduled. 5. International Conference of Composers. A type of conference that is held annually in the USSR. It was suggested that each of these two conferences for musicians should first \"take place within the frame- work of one of the international musicians' organiza- tions already in existence or with its support.\" 6. International Writers Conference. A project dating from 1951 and still discussed in meetings and correspondence. C. PROGRAM .DEVELOPMENTS 1. Extension of Anti-Atomic Bomb Committees (and anti-nuclear tests campaigns). These committees started in Japan and are becoming widespread, especially in Holland, Belgium and England. A campaign against nuclear tests initiated by Bertrand Russell (and continued by Linus Pauling in the US) is extensively used in WPC propaganda. It is claimed that this campaign was inspired by Albert Schweitzer. National peace committees were instructed to main- tain and increase the flood of resolutions, statements, protests, appeals and telegrams to the United Nations Organization against tests of nuclear weapons. The WPC (and IIP) is producing a series of booklets Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 containing statements by scientists and material purporting to inform about the dangers of atomic fall-out from tests. It also produces articles and other material on the subject which can be repro- duced easily by the national committees. 2. Campaign Against Construction of Rocket Bases in Europe. This campaign is highly organized in France, Italy, and the Baltic area. 3. Campaign on \"Baltic Sea of Peace\". a. Cruise around Baltic countries in July 1958, b. \"Baltic Peace Week\", 6-12 July 1958, c. National Peace Conference, Denmark, May 1958. The purpose was to maintain and extend the sentiment for neutrality in this region, to demilitarize and neutralize the eight Baltic states. 4. Campaign for \"European Security\". Increased opposition to NATO, EURATOM, Common Market, German rearmament. 5. Cultural Campaign. There is greatly increased attention to this campaign the purpose of which was announced to be \"cultural ex- changes between East and West, progress towards giv- ing an international character to the great internation- al cultural organizations whether of a governmental Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 nature, like UNESCO, or not--for meetings, conferences, exchange of visits of scientists, art- ists, technicians, students, theatrical companies, films, publications, works of art... for stimulating joint ventures with cultural circles and intellectuals of various viewpoints.... it 6. Celebration of Cultural Anniversaries. This furnishes a theme for meetings. Of special interest is a plan for celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Darwin and the 100th anniversary in 1959 of the publication of his On the Origin of Species which \"inaugurated a new era for the development of the philosophy of materialism\". It will also be the 150th anniversary of the publica- tion of Zoological Philosophy by Lamarck, the \"father of biological evolution\". The Polish Academy of Science, in a letter to the WPC, suggested that 1959 be the Year of Darwin and Lamarck, although the Linnean Society of England is planning to celebrate the Darwin anniversary in 1958 because :Darwin published a draft of his theory of natural selection in their journal in 1858. Cultural anniversaries to be celebrated in 1958 include KUAN Han Ching - Chinese dramatist, 700th anniversary as a dramatist Saadi - Iranian poet, 700th anniversary of the appearance of his Garden of Roses (Gulistan) OGATA Kohran - Japanese painter, 300th anniversary of his birth Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Selma Lagerlof - Swedish writer, 100th anniversary of her birth Honore Daumier - French painter, 100th anniversary of his birth on February 26th Evangelista Torri Celli - Italian physician, 15 0th anniversary of his birth on October 15th John Milton - English poet, 350th anniversary of his birth on December 9th. 7. Visits of Peace Delegations. These are greatly stepped up -- not only to the USSR but between various countries. \"Vacations\" involve cruises, tours, etc. They are developed by circulating letters or by notices in organs of a professional group -- teachers, musici- ans, etc. -- advising them to apply to the national peace committee. The useful list thus obtained is a base for contacts. Only a few \"outsiders\" are chosen for the vacation at the expense of the host country's peace committee -- the rest of the vacation group is chosen from hard workers in the Peace Movement. Although this has been an active project for years, it was reiterated at Colombo in June 1957 that the next WPC meeting would \"examine the practical application of setting up a World Peace Fund.\" Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 In considering the activity of the WPC during 1958, some mention should be made of the comparative dispersal of the WPC Secretariat or headquarters. Its organizational dissolution in Vienna in February 1957 has not seemed to interfere too :much in its activities. No information has been made known concerning a new headquarters location; therefore, it may be that this dispersal has actually been used to implement plans made in 1956 for decentraliza- tion of the organization into regional bodies which would be concerned with the problems of the various areas as well as with the general WPC propaganda themes. It appears that the work is being carried on as follows: 1. The Vienna headquarters is still active at the same address with a reduced number of the same people but \"reorganized\" under the title of International Institute of Peace. The Organization. Committee for the WPC conference at Stockholm was openly set up in Vienna. James Endicott (Canada), the President of the \"new\" organization, is at the same time a Vice President of the WPC and seems to do much of the traveling for the group. Jean Lafitte was re- placed in Vienna as Secretary by Fernand Vigne. Valentin Sorokin and Vincent Duncan-Jones remain there while Pandit Narain Malviya, Professors von Bonsdorf and Heinrich Brandweiner have been. added to the staff. (Probably Brandweiner was added to overcome the Austrian authorities' objection that the WPC was an organization of foreigners. ) A'farewell party\" was given by the Vienna staff for Jean Lafitte in July 1956 and his name was not on the list of secretaries published after the Colombo Council meeting in June 1957 although he attended Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 that meeting and also the Bureau meeting in Stock- holm in October 1957. His exact position is not clear at this time. Fernand Vigne was named WPC Secretary General at Stockholm in July 1958, thus openly linking the WPC and IIP Secretariats. Alfredo Varela, head of WPC cultural activities, left Vienna with his family to return to Argentina. Jorge Zalamea reportedly was to return to his home in Colombia and from there work towards reviving the Peace Movement in Latin America. However, he is still in Vienna. Prince SAIONJI also finished his term of service on the Vienna staff and has become the Deputy Chairman of the Liaison Bureau for the Asian and Pacific Regions, in Peking. Frederic Joliot-Curie maintained a \"cabinet du president\" or secretariat in Paris from 1955 until his death in August 1958; this carried on much of the WPC work. 2. Isabelle Blume, who was added to the list of WPC Vice Presidents at the Colombo meeting, has become much more active in the Belgian Peace Council and is evidently working out of Brussels. She, too, does much traveling for the WPC. 3. A Preparatory Committee for the Colombo WPC Session was set up in the Communist Party build- ing in Helsinki in the spring of 1957 with personnel from the Vienna headquarters. This Committee returned to Helsinki after the Colombo session and apparently some of its members are working there as a permanent regional section. 4. An Economic Commission was organized in the IIP-WPC 53 r r Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000900340003-2 headquarters at a meeting held there 26-27 April 1958 under the presidency of Professor Dobretsberger of Austria. Isabelle Blume, Valentin Sorokin, Jorge Zalamea and SATO Shigeo of the Secretariat took part in the discussions. Other participants at the meeting were economists from Hungary, India, the USSR, Italy, Britain, France and the WFTU. In presenting the reason for organizing this Commis- sion, which appears to be a permanent addition, Professor Dobretsberger spoke along the following lines: The armament race raises many problems in many countries although no study gives an exact picture of the facts of profits by arms manufacture, the inflation caused by the arms race, loss of revenue for social reforms and education, etc. It would be well to present the consequences of the arms race on the economies of the various countries, including the non- European countries and colonial countries. If we propose an end to the arms race, it will cause fear in economic circles that conversion of arms manufacture to peace production will cause a crisis because investments will lose value. We must draft a work plan on how to go about making such a study and on how to publish it. Such a study is particularly important for the underdeveloped countries. We can ask the national peace committees to tell us, on the basis of their knowledge of the local situations, what great projects could be realized by the release of resources now being used for military ends. The WPC is noticeably increasing its economic propaganda in line with the Soviet economic offensive.

An ordinary member may belong to the UP for 50 Austrian schillings a year ($2 - 10 rupees - 10 Swiss francs). The announcement states that \"a provision is also made in the Articles of Association for groups, organizations or individuals to be accepted as extraordinary members\". Mem- bers have the right to take part in General Meetings, and to elect the Executive Board. The announcement also solicited subscriptions to IIP publications as follows: Subscription to the \"Gray\" and \"Blue\" series (which are good-sized booklets on the dangers of atomic fall-out and other propaganda subjects), at least one of which in each series will be published each month, is $3 annually or 25c a copy.

AFRO-ASIAN SOLIDARITY COUNCIL The formal creation of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council and Secretariat (AASCS) at the conference held in Cairo in Decem- ber 1957 was the first step toward the emergence of a new major front organization. However, virtually no significant steps to activate the organization took place prior to May 1958, beyond the prompt designation of the Soviet member of the Secretariat Abd-al-Ghaffar Rashidov. All other activity was carried out by the Egyptian group led by Yusuf al-Sibai, the Secretary General. With the arrival of the Chinese secretary, YANG Shou, in early May international participation in the Secretariat's work was accelerated.
