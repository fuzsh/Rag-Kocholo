Effective biomarkers may help to improve outcomes. Durvalumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 binding to PD-1 and CD80, restoring antitumor immunity [1, 2]. PD-L1 expression on tumor or tumor-infiltrating immune cells measured manually with different immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays can enrich for patients responding to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents. Tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells may also have potential predictive utility for therapeutic response. We explored automated image analysis and pattern recognition of tumor biopsies to determine whether CD8+ and PD-L1+ cell densities could better identify patients most likely to respond to durvalumab than PD-L1 IHC alone.\n\nMethods\n\nCP1108/NCT01693562 was a nonrandomized phase I/II trial evaluating durvalumab in advanced NSCLC and other solid tumors [3]. By 29APR2016, 304 previously treated NSCLC patients, median 3 prior lines, received 10 mg/kg of durvalumab q2w ≤12 months. Baseline archived or fresh tumor biopsies were analyzed for PD-L1 (Ventana/SP263) and CD8 (Ventana/SP239) by IHC. For the marker combination, slides were scored using the product of PD-L1+ and CD8+ cell densities with Definiens’ Developer XD 2.1.4 software. For PD-L1 alone, ≥25% tumor cells stained for PD-L1 at any intensity were scored positive. Clinical outcomes (ORR, PFS and OS) were analysed based on CD8+ and PD-L1+ densities (n = 163 available) and PD-L1 alone in pre-treatment biopsies using a discovery (n = 84) and validation (n = 79) set. Datasets were matched on baseline PD-L1 status, histology, ECOG, lines of therapy, and response.\n\nResults\n\nPatients with high pretreatment CD8+ and PD-L1+ densities (prevalence = 36%) had better ORR, OS, and PFS compared to those with low CD8+ and PD-L1+ densities (Fig. 1), as well as high PD-L1 expression alone.\n\nConclusions\n\nAutomated image analysis of CD8+ and PD-L1+ cell densities in baseline tumor biopsies may identify patients with improved outcomes to durvalumab.\n\nTrial Registration\n\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01693562.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Although paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vinflunine are commonly used, they provide limited clinical benefit. KEYNOTE-045 compared the efficacy and safety of the anti–PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab versus investigator-choice chemotherapy as second-line therapy for advanced urothelial cancer that progressed or recurred following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nMethods\n\nEligible patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 expression and randomized 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W for 24 months or investigator’s choice of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 Q3W, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 Q3W, or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 Q3W. Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0/1 vs 2), liver metastases (yes vs no), hemoglobin level (<10 vs ≥10 g/dL), and time from last chemotherapy dose (<3 vs ≥3 months). The study had a group sequential design to control for type I error. Primary endpoints were OS and PFS (RECIST v1.1 by blinded, independent central review). ORR was a key secondary endpoint. Differences in OS and PFS were assessed in the intention-to-treat population using the stratified log-rank test\n\nResults\n\nBetween November 5, 2014 and November 13, 2015, 542 patients from 29 countries were enrolled: 270 in the pembrolizumab arm, 272 in the chemotherapy arm. As of September 7, 2016, median follow-up was 9.0 months; 49 (18.4%) patients remained on pembrolizumab and 3 (1.2%) patients remained on chemotherapy. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms, with 87.3% with visceral disease, 34.3% with liver metastases, 1.1% with ECOG PS 2, 81.5% with hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL, and 38.2% with <3 months since most recent chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab significantly improved OS over chemotherapy (HR 0.73, P = 0.0022; median 10.3 vs 7.4 months) (Table 1). There was no difference in PFS (HR 0.98, P = 0.42) (Table 1). ORR was significantly improved with pembrolizumab (21.1% vs 11.4%) (Table 1). Pembrolizumab was associated with fewer any-grade (60.9% vs 90.2%) grade 3-5 treatment-related AEs (15.0% vs 49.4%). 4 patients in each arm died due to treatment-related AEs.\n\nConclusions\n\nPembrolizumab demonstrated a statistically significant OS benefit over chemotherapy in the second-line advanced urothelial cancer setting, making it the first therapy to demonstrate a survival benefit over an active comparator in this population. The superior OS combined with the lower rate of any-grade and high-grade treatment-related AEs support pembrolizumab as a new standard of care for advanced urothelial cancer that progressed on/after platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nTrial registration\n\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02256436\n\nTable 1 (abstract O2)\n\nEnd pointPembrolizumab\n\nN = 270Chemotherapy\n\nN = 272OS, no. of events155179 Median (95 % CI), months10.3 (8.0-11.8)7.4 (6.1-8.3) HR (95 % CI)0.73 (0.59-0.91); P = 0.0022PFS, no. of events218219 Median (95 % CI), months2.1 (2.0-2.2)3.3 (2.3-3.5) HR (95 % CI)0.98 (0.81-1.19); P = 0.42ORR (95 % CI)21.1 % (16.4-26.5)11.4 % (7.9-15.8) Treatment difference, % (95 % CI)9.6 (3.5-15.9); P = 0.0011\n\nO3 Efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma: first results from the phase I/II CheckMate 032 study\n\nPadmanee Sharma1, Margaret K Callahan2, Emiliano Calvo3, Joseph W Kim4, Filipo de Braud5, Patrick A Ott6, Petri Bono7, Rathi N Pillai8, Michael Morse9, Dung T Le10, Matthew Taylor11, Pavlina Spilliopoulou12, Johanna Bendell13, Dirk Jaeger14, Emily Chan15, Scott J Antonia16, Paolo A Ascierto17, Delphine Hennicken18, Marina Tschaika18, Alex Azrilevich18, Jonathan Rosenberg2\n\n1University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; 2Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; 3START Madrid, Centro Integral Oncológico Clara Campal, Madrid, Spain; 4Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA; 5Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori-Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, Italy; 6Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; 7Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; 8Emory Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, GA, USA; 9Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA; 10Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA; 11Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA; 12Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow, United Kingdom; 13Sarah Cannon Research Institute and Department of Medical Oncology, Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, TN, USA; 14Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; 15Vanderbilt-Ingram University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; 16H.

Preclinical and clinical data indicate that the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody, can improve antitumor activity in other tumor types. Here, we report the first efficacy and safety results of combined nivolumab plus ipilimumab given at two different dosing schedules in CheckMate 032 , an open-label, multicenter, phase I/II study of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who progressed after prior platinum-based therapy.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma previously treated with platinum-based therapy were included in the study. Patients were treated with either of two combination schedules, nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (N1I3) or nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (N3I1) every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks; or they were treated with nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg (N3) every 2 weeks. All patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety and duration of response (DoR).\n\nResults\n\nMinimum follow-up was 3.9 months in the N1I3 (n = 26) group, 14.5 months in the N3I1 group (n = 104), and 13.8 months in N3 group (n = 78). ORR was 38.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.2-59.4), 26.0% (95% CI, 17.9-35.5), and 25.6% (95% CI, 16.4-36.8) in the N1I3, N3I1, and N3 groups, respectively. Median DoR has not been reached in any treatment group. The frequency of drug-related grade 3-4 adverse events was 30.8% (N1I3), 31.7% (N3I1), and 23.1% (N3). Treatment-related adverse events led to discontinuation in 7.7% (N1I3), 13.5% (N3I1), and 3.8% (N3) of patients. One death was reported in the N3I1 group (pneumonitis) and two deaths were reported in the N3 group (pneumonitis and thrombocytopenia).\n\nConclusions\n\nSecond-line treatment with N1I3 may provide the most favorable benefit-risk ratio among the regimens studied. If these interim results are confirmed with longer follow-up, further development of the N1I3 combination in metastatic urothelial carcinoma is warranted.\n\nTrial Registration\n\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01928394.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Employing our unique computational algorithms to define new members of the B7/CD28 family, we identified PVRIG, which is expressed by multiple subsets of T and NK cells. We report here its expression pattern, functional characterization, and anti-tumor activity of blocking antibodies targeting this molecule.\n\nMethods\n\nUtilizing Compugen’s Predictive Discovery platform we identified PVRIG as a potential novel immune checkpoint, after which a retroviral cell screening library was used to identify its cognate binding counterpart. Target effects on T cell modulation were assessed with primary and tumor-derived T cell assays, taking advantage of target overexpression, knockdown, and antagonist antibody approaches. Antibodies against the human protein were screened for their ability to enhance T cell activation in vitro, while antibodies targeting the mouse orthologue were assessed in vivo for effects on tumor growth inhibition in syngeneic models.\n\nResults\n\nA PVRIG-Fc-fusion protein was found to bind PVRL2, with binding specificity confirmed both by ELISA and flow cytometry analysis. PVRIG demonstrated unique expression kinetics upon T cell activation, with detection of the target on memory T cells, as well as on NK cells and γδ T cells. A panel of high affinity human antibodies with the ability to block interaction of PVRIG with PVRL2 were generated, which when tested in vitro were shown to enhance activation of both primary CD4+ and tumor-derived CD8+ T cells through a PVRL2-dependent mechanism. The lead antibody, COM-701, is currently in preclinical development. Since COM-701 is not mouse cross-reactive, in vivo studies were conducted with a surrogate blocking anti-mouse PVRIG antibody. When combined with anti-PD-L1 blockade, anti-mouse PVRIG inhibits growth of established tumors in both the CT26 and MC38 colorectal cancer models. Combination testing with additional immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as in PVRIG knockout mice, is ongoing.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe describe the identification of PVRIG as a novel immune checkpoint on T cells, as well the development of a high affinity antagonistic antibody, COM-701, that is currently in preclinical development. COM-701 is able to enhance human T cell activation, and a surrogate antibody with similar characteristics shows synergy with PD-L1 in vivo in multiple syngeneic models. Overall, our data demonstrate the utility of targeting PVRIG in addition to other B7 family checkpoints for the treatment of cancer.\n\nCombinations: Immunotherapy/Immunotherapy\n\nO5 Preliminary efficacy from a phase I/II study of the natural killer cell–targeted antibody lirilumab in combination with nivolumab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck\n\nRom Leidner1, Hyunseok Kang2, Robert Haddad3, Neil H Segal4, Lori J Wirth5, Robert L Ferris6, F Stephen Hodi3, Rachel E Sanborn7, Thomas F Gajewski8, William Sharfman9, Dan McDonald10, Shivani Srivastava10, Xuemin Gu10, Penny Phillips10, Chaitali Passey10, Tanguy Seiwert8\n\n1Earle A.

NK-cell activation is negatively regulated by inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs); therefore, blocking KIR function may potentiate an anti-tumor immune response and complement other immuno-oncology therapies that enhance T cell activity. We present preliminary efficacy results in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) from a phase I/II study of lirilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks inhibitory KIRs on NK cells, in combination with nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor, in patients with solid tumors (NCT01714739).\n\nMethods\n\nDuring dose escalation, patients with advanced solid tumors who progressed after ≥ 1 prior therapy received lirilumab 0.1–3.0 mg/kg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) plus nivolumab 3.0 mg/kg Q2W. Cohort expansion was initiated at the maximum dose of lirilumab 3.0 mg/kg Q4W plus nivolumab 3.0 mg/kg Q2W in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study endpoints include safety (primary), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and biomarker assessments.\n\nResults\n\nAs of the August 30, 2016 data cutoff, 159 patients were treated with the lirilumab plus nivolumab combination. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and grade 3–4 TRAEs were reported in 72% (114/159) and 15% (24/159) of patients, respectively. Discontinuations due to TRAEs occurred in 8% (12/159). Of the 41 patients with SCCHN treated, 29 were evaluable for response. In this heavily pretreated, checkpoint inhibitor–naïve group, ORR was 24% (7/29; confirmed and unconfirmed) and DCR was 52% (15/29). Maximum reduction in target lesions are presented in Fig. 2 for 26 patients with available tumor assessments. Two patients classified as stable disease per RECIST v1.1 showed unconventional responses, with 100% and 37% reductions in target lesions. Among evaluable patients, five (17%) had reductions in tumor burden > 80%. Responses appear durable, with the median DOR not reached (Fig. 3). Updated efficacy and preliminary biomarker analyses (including PD-L1 and HPV status) will be presented.\n\nConclusions\n\nPreliminary efficacy of lirilumab plus nivolumab in patients with advanced platinum-refractory SCCHN demonstrates clinical benefit, with encouraging response rates that were deep and durable responses in some patients. This combination demonstrated a manageable safety profile similar to that observed with nivolumab monotherapy. Further evaluation of this novel combination of an NK-cell inhibitor and an immune checkpoint inhibitor is ongoing.\n\nTrial Registration\n\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01714739\n\nTumor Microenvironment\n\n06 Phase II study of intratumoral plasmid interleukin 12 (pIL-12) with electroporation in combination with pembrolizumab in stage III/IV melanoma patients with low tumor infiltrating lymphocytes\n\nAlain Algazi1, Katy Tsai1, Michael Rosenblum1, Prachi Nandoskar1, Robert HI Andtbacka2, Amy Li1, John Nonomura3, Kathryn Takamura3, Mary Dwyer3, Erica Browning3, Reneta Talia3, Chris Twitty3, Sharron Gargosky3, Jean Campbell3, Carmen Ballesteros-Merino4, Carlo B.

We have shown that melanoma patients with a low frequency of PD-1hiCTLA-4 + TIL are unlikely to respond to pembrolizumab (Daud2016). Intratumoral electroporation of pIL-12 (IT-pIL12-EP) leads to an IFN-g signature suggestive of increased TIL as well as regression in both treated and untreated lesions. We hypothesize that combination IT-pIL12-EP and pembrolizumab will improve clinical outcomes in this low-response population. Preliminary results from a multi-center, phase II, open-label trial testing this hypothesis are presented.\n\nMethods\n\nMelanoma stage III/IV patients with accessible lesions were consented and enrolled if they had a TIL status of hiCTLA-4+ in the CD45 + CD8 + CD3+ gate by flow cytometry (FC). Patients were treated with pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) concurrently with IT-pIL12-EP on days 1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks. Patients were evaluated for overall response rate (ORR) every 12 weeks by RECISTv1.1. Pre and post-treatment blood and tumor specimens were collected, and analyzed for immune phenotyping, gene expression, TCR diversity, and changes in the tumor microenvironment with multispectral immunohistochemistry.\n\nResults\n\nInterim ORR data is available on 15 patients. 13/15 patients had a frequency of PD-1hi CTLA-4+ TIL of < 22% (low TIL status), phenotypes associated with a low probability of response to anti-PD-1 (Daud 2016). These 15 patients age 39-89 years, were 53% male, 66% stage III and 34% stage IV. Treatment was well tolerated; 38% of adverse events (AE) were classified as treatment site reactions (grade 1-2) that resolved. One SAE of cellulitis resolved with 5d antibiotics. One grade 3 AE of diarrhea resolved with corticosteroids. The ORR was 40% (4CR, 2PR) by RECISTv1.1. Analysis of tumor biopsies and blood demonstrated meaningful immunological changes including an increased number and ratio of CD8+:PD-L1+ and CD8+:FoxP3 + TIL, tumoral RNA signatures indicating an increase in CD8 and IFN-γ-related gene expression and concordant immune phenotypes in the periphery.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe combination IT-pIL12-EP with pembrolizumab in patients with an anti-PD-1 non-responsive phenotype engendered a 40% clinical response with associated positive immune-based biomarker data and an excellent safety profile.

Mounting evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that CD4+ T cells in combination with chemotherapy can control tumor growth and recurrence. CD4+ T cells are suggested to mediate tumor rejection through mechanisms that include cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, inhibition of angiogenesis, and reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment.\n\nMethods\n\nIn this project, we set out to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of chemo-immunotherapy in the form of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and tumor specific CD4+ T cells in a murine model of colorectal cancer. Mice were injected subcutaneously with colorectal cancer cells. When the tumor reached 140-160 mm2 in area, mice were injected with a low dose of cyclophosphamide followed by adoptive transfer of tumor reactive CD4+ T cells.\n\nResults\n\nIn a murine model of colorectal cancer, we show that the combination therapy of CTX and tumor reactive CD4+ T cells resulted in enhanced necrosis of tumor cells in vivo, leading to eventual eradication of advanced tumors. By using immunofluorescence staining and blood perfusion imaging, we demonstrated that the combination therapy leads to destruction of the established tumor vasculature and reduced blood supply to tumor tissue. Furthermore, we assessed blood vessel permeability in the tumor tissue and found that the combination therapy increased extravasation of Evans blue dye, suggesting an increase in vascular permeability.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, our findings suggest that the combination therapy of CTX + CD4+ T cells leads to destruction of the tumor vasculature, resulting in extensive necrosis of tumor tissue and eventual tumor regression. These findings may provide new insights into mechanisms of tumor rejection by CD4+ T cells.\n\nP2 Preclinical development of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy for pancreatic cancer\n\nDonastas Sakellariou-Thompson, Cara Haymaker, Caitlin Creasy, Mark Hurd, Naohiro Uraoka, Jaime Rodriguez Canales, Scott Koptez, Patrick Hwu, Anirban Maitra, Chantale Bernatchez\n\nUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Donastas Sakellariou-Thompson (dasakellariou@mdanderson.org)\n\nBackground\n\nImmunotherapy has become an effective cancer therapy, particularly in the case of checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). ACT exploits the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) by exponentially expanding their numbers ex vivo and re-infusing them into the patient in an autologous setting. With the effectiveness of TIL therapy already well established in multiple phase II studies in melanoma, there is a push to translate it to other cancers in dire need of improved therapies. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one such cancer for which the current therapy, surgery and chemotherapy, provides an overall 5-year survival rate of only 5%. The presence of TIL is correlated with increased survival in PDAC, which suggests that TIL could effectively control the disease and provides a rationale to test TIL therapy in this setting.\n\nMethods\n\nTo assess the feasibility, we characterized the immune component of PDAC, explored the ability to grow and expand TIL from tumor fragments, and analyzed the clonality of these expanded TIL.\n\nResults\n\nFlow cytometry analysis detected low, CD4-rich T cell infiltration. These TIL were able to be expanded ex vivo and the addition of an agonistic anti-41BB antibody to the cultures preferentially increased total TIL outgrowth, particularly that of CD8+ TIL. The success rate of TIL growth was increased from 23% to 50% for cultures grown without and with anti-41BB respectively. Sequencing of the T cell receptor CDR3-beta chain found specific T cell clones enriched at the tumor site in comparison to the blood. IHC staining for MHC class I (MHCI) on PDAC tumor samples showed that it is widely expressed but at low levels generally.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, it is possible to expand CD8+ T cells from PDAC bearing TCR sequences highly enriched in the tumor. Additionally, expanded TIL would be able to target tumor cells as they are shown to express MHCI. Although there are barriers yet to overcome, the initial data suggest the feasibility of TIL therapy for PDAC.\n\nP3 Synthetic biology approaches to enhance adoptive cell therapy safety and precision\n\nScott M Coyle1, Kole T Roybel1, Levi J Rupp1, Stephen P Santoro1, Stephanie Secrest1, Michael Spelman1, Hanson Ho1, Tina Gomes1, Tiffany Tse1, Chia Yung-Wu2, Jack Taunton3, Wendell Lim3, Peter Emtage1\n\n1Cell Design Labs, San Francisco, CA, USA; 2Amgen, San Francisco, CA, USA; 3University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Stephen P Santoro (steve@celldesignlabs.com)\n\nBackground\n\nChimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) have shown impressive efficacy against numerous hematological malignancies, yet a high percentage of individuals receiving these therapies experience toxicity in the form of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and/or normal tissue destruction. Furthermore, solid tumors represent a substantive challenge for CAR therapy due to a lack of tumor- specific antigens and general inability of T cells to overcome immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. We have sought to circumvent these obstacles by utilizing synthetic biology approaches to augment CAR-T function and specificity.\n\nMethods\n\nWe developed two platform technologies that aim to mitigate toxicity associated with CAR-T therapy and endow T cells with environmental sensing capabilities that enhance tumor discrimination from normal tissue and/or confer the ability to generate customizable response outputs. Firstly, we engineered an “ON-switch” CAR that consists of two protein modules that undergo heterodimerization and become competent for signaling only in the presence of a small-molecule dimerizing agent [1]. In addition, we created a “synthetic Notch” (synNotch) receptor, which we previously described in the context of combinatorial antigen sensing [2], that is capable of driving expression of any number of downstream polypeptides in response to antigen engagement.\n\nResults\n\nHere we describe advances in our ON-switch CAR design that allow for dose-dependent antigen-specific T cell activation in the presence of an FDA-approved non-immunosuppressive small molecule dimerizer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our synNotch T cells are able to deliver therapeutic payloads capable of, but not limited to, modulating the tumor microenvironment and changing the cell-intrinsic transcriptional properties of the synNotch T cells.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have successfully identified a heterodimerizing switch receptor that specifically activates T cells in the presence of an FDA-approved non-immunosuppressive small molecule. The ability to control the potency of the CAR-mediated immune response in this way may reduce the toxicity associated with CAR-T therapy. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that synNotch T cells are able to sculpt the anti-tumor immune response in both a T cell intrinsic (transcriptional programing) and T cell extrinsic (therapeutic payload) manner, providing a customizable platform for altering T cell function and the tumor microenvironment.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

While the majority of these cancers are curable, almost 2% of these cancers are anaplastic thyroid cancers, which are highly aggressive and almost uniformly lethal. At the same time, the thyroid is known for being inherently immunogenic. For these reasons and due to an active surgical practice providing regular resections of thyroid cancers, we undertook a study of thyroid cancer with the idea of developing an immunotherapy for this disease.\n\nMethods\n\nWe have developed a thyroid cancer tumor bank to complement our Oral, Head and Neck Cancer Program. This tumor bank cryopreserves enzymatically isolated viable cells from resected tumors (n = 16).We are also attempting to develop primary cell lines and are isolating and assessing autologous tumor-specific functions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (n = 7).\n\nResults\n\nTo date we have established 3 tumor cell lines from thyroid cancer specimens and identified PD-L1 expression on 2 of 2 tested. While numbers are small, preliminary analyses suggest that TIL cultures can be generated from 85% of thyroid cancer specimens and that autologous tumor-reactive TIL can be detected in 43% (n = 7) of thyroid cancers. Since not every tumor appears to contain TIL capable of recognizing autologous tumor, strategies to prime tumor-specific T cells represents an area of interest. DPV-003 is a microvesicle vaccine, DRibble, that contains more than 80 proteins that are overexpressed by thyroid cancer (TCGA provisional RNASeq n = 509 pts). The vaccine also contains a number of DAMPs and agonist activity for multiple TLRs packed into stable double membrane microvesicles that are targeted to CLEC9A+ antigen presenting cells. We are also developing a second thyroid-specific DRibble vaccine from a cell line derived from an anaplastic thyroid cancer.\n\nConclusions\n\nAlmost half of thyroid cancers evaluated, including one anaplastic thyroid cancer, contain T cells capable of recognizing autologous cancer cells and secreting IFN-g. However, the other 50% of thyroid cancers appear to lack tumor-reactive T cells and may benefit from combination immunotherapy strategies that include a vaccine.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSupport: Steve and Cindy Harder, Robert W. and Elsie Franz, Wes and Nancy Lematta, Lynn and Jack Loacker, and The Chiles foundation (BAF).\n\nP5 Development and clinical translation of 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C for detecting CD8+ T Cells for immunotherapy applications\n\nTove Olafsen1, Daulet Satpayev2, Michael Torgov1, Filippo Marchioni1, Jason Romero1, Ziyue Karen Jiang1, Charles Zamilpa1, Jennifer S Keppler1, Alessandro Mascioni1, Fang Jia1, Chen-Yu Lee1, Jean Gudas1\n\n1ImaginAb Inc., Inglewood, CA, USA; 2AdicetBio, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Jean Gudas (jgudas@imaginab.com)\n\nBackground\n\nImmunotherapies are changing the landscape for cancer treatment; however, the field is hampered by the lack of biomarkers that can be used for patient selection and for monitoring treatment responses rapidly and non-invasively.
