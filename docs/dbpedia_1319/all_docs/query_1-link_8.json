To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them.\n\nOccasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.\n\nLEAD: Portugal's leading athlete, Rosa Mota, who won the marathon at the world championships last year and the Boston Marathon earlier this year, is in peak form to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games next month.\n\nPortugal's leading athlete, Rosa Mota, who won the marathon at the world championships last year and the Boston Marathon earlier this year, is in peak form to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games next month.\n\nMota's biggest hurdle may not be her opposition in Seoul, South Korea, but the severe stress and disruption in training caused by a clash with Portuguese officials.\n\nMota has faced the possibility of exclusion from Portugal's Olympic team after a bitter row with the Portuguese Athletics Federation, the national governing body for track and field, over her competition schedule.\n\nThe dispute became so heated that President Mario Soares of Portugal promised to intervene on the runner's behalf if her troubles continued.\n\nMota has faced problems since she began running at age 14, but in those days they were more straightforward. There was an economic struggle, with occasions when it was difficult to get the money for a running suit or track shoes. And there were problems stemming from prejudice toward female runners.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
