        "text": "It was time to get even in the Goodwill Games. Dave Wharton did - dead even. Next, it's the turn of the U.S. men's basketball team.\n\nWharton and Patrick Kuehl of East Germany swam to what is believed to be the first gold-medal dead heat in a major meet in six years Sunday in the men's 400-meter individual medley.\"I could see him the whole race,\" Wharton said, \"and knowing I was behind the last 50, I put my head down and went. When I saw the time, it was pretty incredible.\"\n\nJanet Evans won her second gold medal of the games in another swimming event, but Matt Biondi failed to win his third. Once again, he took the Nesty plunge.\n\nBeaten by Anthony Nesty of Surinam by .01 seconds in the 100-meter butterfly two years ago in the Seoul Olympics, he was beaten by Nesty in the same event again, this time by .40.\n\n\"I was more nervous than I've ever been,\" Nesty said. \"Everybody's telling me I've got to swim Matt again. So that made me a lot more nervous than I usually am.\"\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team, meanwhile, plays its first game Monday night against Puerto Rico. The next night, there looms a rematch with the Soviets, who beat the Americans and won the gold medal in the Seoul Olympics two years ago.\n\nThe last time the U.S. men beat the Soviets in a major international tournament was in 1986 at Madrid in the world championships, which also were considered part of the first Goodwill Games since they were held concurrently.\n\n\"There is no burden on this team about retribution from the past,\" said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who is coaching the Goodwill Games team.\n\nOn the track, Jackie Joyner-Kersee began her assault on another world record in the heptathlon, a seven-event test of speed, strength and agility. She started well, then faltered and lost almost all hope of breaking the 7,300-point barrier.\n\nThrough the 100-meter hurdles and high jump, she was only three points off her world record pace of 7,291 points. But she blew her chance by coming up short in the shot put, at 45 feet, 81/2 inches, nearly 10 feet short of her career-best, and running the 200 meters into a strong headwind in 24.26, almost two seconds slower than her best.\n\nAlthough 296 points off her record pace, Joyner-Kersee held a 240-point lead over Larisa Nikitina of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"My mind wasn't totally there,\" Joyner-Kersee said. \"I paid the price.\"\n\nOther track and field winners were Zoya Ivanova, the only legitimate world-class runner in the field, who led a Soviet sweep of the women's marathon; Soviet Rodion Gataullin in the pole vault at 19-5, best in the world this year; Carlette Guidry, who led a U.S. sweep in the women's 100 meters in 11.03, fastest by an American this year; Cuba's Ana Quirot in the women's 400 meters; Jamaican Winthrop Graham in the men's 400 intermediate hurdles; Canadian Paul Williams in the 5,000; and Mexico's Ernest Canto in the 20km walk.\n\nIlke Wyludda of East Germany extended her two-year winning streak to 23 in the women's discus, with a throw of 223-4. It was the fourth victory in a week for Wyludda, ranked No. 1 in the world and No. 2 on the all-time performers list at 244-7.\n\nWharton, of Warminster, Pa., a silver medalist in this event at Seoul, and Kuehl each completed the 400 individual medley in 4:17.74. Officials said they believed it was the first dead heat for first place in a major meet since Americans Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer tied for the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984.\n\nEvans, of Placentia, Calif., who was foiled in her attempt at a second gold medal on Saturday, won the women's 400-meter freestyle in 4:05.84, nearly five seconds faster than Haley Lewis of Australia. Betsy Mitchell of Marietta, Ohio, won the women's 100-meter backstroke.\n\nEvans' time was tied for fourth-fastest ever with that of Anke Moehring of East Germany last year. Evans, however, holds the three faster times.\n\nKrzyzewski, whose Duke team lost to UNLV for the national championship last spring, said the Goodwill Games team may not be \"as big as many of our opponents, and we don't have the experience of most of them, but we're as quick as anybody, probably quicker.\""
