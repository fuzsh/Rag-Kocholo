Please see this video https://lnkd.in/g3yK2T-j\n\nTrust is important to your business, right? But does your organisation understand how trust works and more importantly, how to scientifically achieve it? Our Founder, Johann Ponnampalam, PhD recently spoke with #Forbes Editor-in-Chief, Sarah O'Carroll, about the science of trust. Consumer trust in an organisation is built on four proofs: 1. integrity 2. benevolence 3. integrity 4. predictability So how do you think your organisation ranks on these? Do you want to work from the validated science of trust and learn not only how to build consumer trust but also how to keep it? https://lnkd.in/gZqUBSCF #trust #scienceoftrust #behaviouralscience\n\nWhat is the benefit of joining a peer advisory group? In our opinion, the number one benefit is that youâ€™ll gain a panel of trusted peers to tell you the truth - even when itâ€™s hard. Because your fellow peer group members speak your language but have unique experiences, they can offer solutions and insights you may not have considered to solve your toughest problems.
