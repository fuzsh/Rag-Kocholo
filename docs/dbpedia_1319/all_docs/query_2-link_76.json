        "text": "Kollision Course and Nightvibe will host the first edition of Kollision Course residency, “a night of relentless hard-hitting techno,” at Auro Kitchen & Bar in Hauz Khas in New Delhi, India! This killer event features an energy-packed line-up of headliners Kollision and Zoya, with techno artist Wadjet as the opening act on January 28. Tickets for this event are powered by Ticket Fairy.\n\nKollision AKA Kashish, who is behind the “conceptualisation and curation” of the Kollision Course, is going to set the Auro dancefloor on fire with her tunes this weekend. The Bombay-based techno DJ/producer’s sound has reached venues across India, including antiSOCIAL Mumbai, Kitty Ko India, Artistry Hyderabad, SoHo-Delhi, XU Bangalore, Botanica Pune, Vintage Machine in Lucknow, and Error in Siliguri, among many others!\n\n“Feeling all sorts of emotions as I write this!! My blood sweat and tears are paying off… My baby #KollisionCourse has a three month residency at my most favorite and the best venue in the capital @aurokitchenbar starting next year..,” Kollision shared on Instagram. She expressed her excitement by saying: “I can’t wait to share this happiness with y’all in the form of music. Each edition will be special and different. I’ve worked really hard to make this ip a #fasttechno brand and it getting recognized like this feels like I’m doing something right.”\n\nYou May Also Read: TFword Review: Connections Vol. 2 by The Chikara Project\n\n“But the most important part about this residency is that 10% of the tix sales + 10% of my fee will go to some of the animal NGO’s that are really doing amazing things for strays. Will need all your support my loves,” she wrote on Instagram.\n\nHailing from Goa, Zoya returns to Auro this weekend after a mind-blowing gig there back in May. Her spectacular sets include genres ranging from techno, drum and bass, and electro to reflective house and hip-hop. The DJ/producer has also gotten behind the decks at Casa Danza (Gurugram), Khar Social (Mumbai), Slique Delhi, Indiranagar Social (Bangalore), Nuts and Brew (Guwahati), Ukiyo Resorts & Beach Club (Goa), among many other exciting venues.\n\nWadjet is on opening duties and will set the tone for the night. The DJ has played at some of the hottest venues in Delhi, including Lalit New Delhi, AQUILA, Casa Danza, KAI, SoHo-Delhi, and Raasta – Green Park. The aspiring techno producer has also taken the Havelock Island Beach Resort stage in Andaman & Nicobar and performed at R A È É T H Vagatore – A Richboyz Project in Goa last year. Her Bangalore debut was at the Hyatt Centric Bangalore in October 2022.\n\nGet tickets for Kollision Course x Nightvibe | Kollision, Zoya & more at Auro at Ticket Fairy: HERE\n\nArtists performing at this event: Kollision | Zoya | Wadjet\n\nKollision Course on: Instagram\n\nNightvibe on: Instagram\n\nAuro Kitchen & Bar on: Instagram\n\nYou May Also Like:\n\nArtists Performing in India for the First Time in 2022-23\n\nTFword in Conversation With Belgian DJ & Producer MATTN"
