        "text": "Ed Gordon for IAAF\n\n25 February 2001  Lievin, France - Even as the invitational indoor season draws to a close with only one weekend remaining before the World Indoor Championships, the Gaz de France meeting--the final stop of the four-meeting Energizer series--produced seven world-leading performances.\n\nIn the women's 1500, Gabriela Szabo was running her first race since lowering the 3000-metre world record one week ago in Birmingham, and she confirmed after her world-leading 4:03.42 win that a little fatigue was still remaining.\n\nAfter pacemakers Zoya Kaznovska and Luminita Gogirlea had finished their work at the 800-metre point, Szabo was left leading the rest of the pack with 2:10.5.\n\nCarla Sacramento and Natalya Gorelova stayed close behind the Romanian as the final stages of the race unfolded. Then suddenly as the bell sounded with 200 remaining, Gorelova bolted into the lead with Sacramento right behind.\n\nGoing down the back straight for the final time, Szabo began mounting a charge, and coming off the final turn, she was able to turn what had appeared as an almost certain defeat into a stunning victory.\n\nHer supreme effort in salvaging the win--the ninth-fastest time ever recorded in the event--helped to move Gorelova to the best-ever post-Soviet time for a Russian runner with 4:03.51. Sacramento, in third, ran a Portuguese record of 4:04.11.\n\nSzabo has bettered this time only once in her career, that coming in her 1999 World Indoor win in Maebashi.\n\n\"I ran this 1500 today to work on my speed,\" she said, even though she missed her intended 2:39 kilometer time by more than five seconds. \"I was surprised how short this race seemed to me after last weekend's 3000.\"\n\nWith an appearance in the 2000 metres, Noah Ngeny, in his first season as an indoor runner, took aim on one of Haile Gebrselassie's world records. But the slow pace doomed any chance the 1500-metre Olympic champion might have had at challenging the 4:52.86.\n\nCountrymen Sammy Mutai and David Lelei took Ngeny through the first 1000 and 1500, respectively, but even after a kilometer (2:28.6) it was evident Gebrselassie's record was safe.\n\nAs Ngeny was gliding along in the lead at 1400 metres, another battle developed about twenty metres to his rear.\n\nRui Silva, John Mayock and Youssef Baba separated themselves from the remaining pack and were charging closer to the Kenyan. Ngeny, with several backward glances, made certain they didn't put his win in danger, and he picked up the tempo.\n\nWith 150 remaining, John Mayock charged off the penultimate curve and was gaining on Ngeny, but the Yorkshire runner couldn't make up the needed distance.\n\nStill, behind Ngeny's world-leading 4:56.40 performance, Mayock was able to lower his British record to 4:57.09, pruning almost 5 1/2 seconds off his previous mark.\n\n\"My objective today was not a world record,\" Ngeny offered later. \"I'm not a habitué of indoors . . . but I'm better there than in cross-country!\" he laughed.\n\nThe men's 1500 metres was added to the Liévin program less than two weeks ago as an opportunity for French runner Mehdi Baala to lower his French record on French soil in front of French spectators.\n\nOnly after these plans had been set did Hicham El Guerrouj indicate his \"availability\" to the Liévin management.\n\nPutting the Moroccan in the 2000 metres against Ngeny - the man who had beaten him in Sydney - was certainly a juicy temptation, but conventional wisdom ruled that this was not the proper time for a rematch.\n\nThat left only the 1500 as a place to showcase El Guerrouj. With Baala already set with his pacemakers, and El Guerrouj showing up with his own tempo setters, it looked like it would be two races in one. If only the format had been that clean-cut.\n\nThe race was almost as tangled as the script itself. Initial pacemaker Jimmy Lomba of France started out far too fast, and dragged the second rabbit, Kenya's Benson Koech, along with him.\n\nEl Guerrouj knew better than to follow them, and he actually decided to take the pace of Baala's rabbit, Boubdallah Tahri of France.\n\nAfter three laps, any possibility for a record was gone, and El Guerrouj decided only to concentrate on winning, which he did in a pedestrian 3:37.20.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the pacemakers were too fast,\" analyzed the Moroccan, echoing what everyone was saying. \"Now, I have to prepare myself psychologically for the Worlds in 15 days.\"\n\nStephanie Graf scored her third indoor win of the season over Sydney champion Maria Mutola with a come-from-behind 800-metre victory in 1:57.53, the eighth-fastest performance of all-time.\n\nVirginie Fouquet led Mutola, Graf and Helena Fuchsova through the first half of the event, after which Mutola pulled noticeably ahead of her other two challengers.\n\nThe Czech made a move on the final backstretch, but was never able to overtake the other two. What remained for the next 100 metres was another Austro-Mozambique duel.\n\nGraf kept Mutola within scope on the final turn, and then blasted past her enroute to a world-leading time, which also an Austrian record. Mutola's runner-up clocking was 1:58.02.\n\n\"I'm quite tired after having raced in Gent on Friday night and then again at the Austrian championships in Vienna yesterday,\" she admitted. \"It's always a challenge running against Maria, and today was even more so. She set such a fast pace for everyone.\"\n\nEven Mutola admitted that she perhaps pushed things a little too much. \"It was too fast. But I've trained well this winter, and we'll see what that will do for me in my upcoming races.\"\n\nAlthough Svetlana Feofanova didn't approach a world-record level today with her winning jump of 4.48 in the women's pole vault, her hookup with Olympic champion Stacy Dragila in the World Championships is a highly anticipated event.\n\nThe other two winners in the technical events were Monica Dinescu in the high jump (1.97), and Ivan Pedroso in the long jump (8.01). The Cuban actually had to survive a countback to win against Slovenian Gregor Cankar, who also produced a 8.01 leap.\n\nChristian Malcolm came away from the weekend as the season's leading 200-meter runner after a 20.46 performance. However, it took a lane violation by Jamaican Christopher Williams (timed in 20.45) to secure the honour for the British sprinter.\n\nJust before Malcolm's run, American Coby Miller--a late addition to the first section of the 200 after failing to qualify for the 60-meter final--toured the hall in 20.55, a world-leading performance at that moment.\n\nJuliet Campbell also used the legendary oval of the Stade Couvert to lower her own world-leading mark in the women's 200 by 0.01 with a 22.85 win.\n\nStanding out among the 60-metre sprint events was the women's hurdles, won by Michelle Freeman in the season's best time of 7.83, only 0.01 ahead of second-place Glory Alozie at 7.84.\n\nOther winners in the short sprint events were Deji Aliu in the men's 60 (6.55), Mercy Nku in the women's 60 (7.11), and Anthony Dees in the men's hurdles (7.52). All three results were seasonal bests for these athletes as they continue to peak for Lisbon.\n\nThe Energizer series utilized a \"grand prix\" style of scoring points for four events during the quartet of meetings. The top winners were Shaun Bownes (men's hurdles), Noah Ngeny (men's middle distance), Deji Aliu (men's 60 metres) and Stephanie Graf (women's 800 metres)\n\nMEN\n\n60 METERS: 1. Aliu (NGR) 6.55; 2.
