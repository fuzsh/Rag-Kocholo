Logistic regression and backward model selection with Akaike information criterion were used to develop prediction models. A third cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was also used for additional validation.\n\nResults: A multivariate model, incorporating patient age, glioblastoma (GBM) diagnosis, and prior history of grade II or III glioma, was developed to predict IDH1/2 mutation probability. This model generated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.934 (95% CI: 0.878, 0.978) in the external validation cohort and 0.941 (95% CI: 0.918, 0.962) in the TCGA cohort. When R132H IDH1 immunostain information was added, AUC increased to 0.986 (95% CI: 0.967, 0.998). This model had an AUC of 0.947 (95% CI: 0.891, 0.995) in predicting whether an R132H IDH1 immunonegative case harbored a less common IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. Its ability to predict IDH1/2 mutation status in grades II-IV gliomas from the Cancer Genome Atlas (94%) was superior to the 84% accuracy of a board-certified neuropathologist who evaluated the same cohort. An interactive web-based application for calculating the probability of an IDH1/2 mutation is now available using these models (http://www.kcr.uky.edu/webapps/IDH/app.html).\n\nConclusions: We have integrated multiple variables to generate a probability of an IDH1/2 mutation. The associated web-based application can help triage diffuse gliomas that would benefit from mutation testing in both clinical and research settings.\n\n2\n\nGlutamine Based PET Imaging Facilitates Enhanced Metabolic Detection of Gliomas in Vivo\n\nSriram Venneti1, Mark Dunphy1, Hanwen Zhang1, Kenneth Pitter1, Carl Campos1, Sean Carlin1, Serge Lyashchenko1, Karl Plöessl2, Daniel Rohle1, Antonio Omuro1, Justin Cross1, Cameron Brennan1, Wolfgang Weber1, Eric Holland3, Ingo Mellinghoff1, Hank Kung2, Jason Lewis1, Craig Thompson1. 1Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; 2University of Pennsylvania; 3University of Washington\n\nGlutamine is the most abundant plasma amino acid and many cancers show altered glutamine metabolism to support their growth and proliferation. We evaluated glutamine metabolism in gliomas using biochemical and in vivo PET imaging approaches. Our results demonstrate that glutamine is a key TCA cycle anaplerotic substrate in gliomas and that glutamine is metabolized to generate 2-HG in IDH1 mutant gliomas. To begin to understand glutamine metabolism in vivo we used PET imaging with18F-labeled glutamine (18F-FGln), which showed high uptake in gliomas but low background uptake in the surrounding brain in RCAS-PDGF/PTEN null and IDH1 mutant glioma animal models. This facilitated clear tumor delineation in contrast to that seen with 18F-FDG. We did not observe 18F-FGln uptake in animals with neuroinflammation with a disrupted BBB. Further, 18F-FGln uptake was specifically reduced on chemo/radiation therapy corresponding with a histologic decrease in tumor volume. Finally, 18F-FGln showed high avidity in a human glioma patient with low uptake in the surrounding brain. These data suggest that 18F-FGln is specifically taken up by gliomas, can be used to detect the metabolic state of gliomas in vivo and may serve as a valuable tool in the clinical management of gliomas.\n\n3\n\nSimplified Grading System for WHO Grade II-III Gliomas based on 1p/19q Status, IDH 1/2 Mutation Status, and Nestin Expression\n\nKimmo Hatanpaa1, Vamsidhara Vemireddy1, Tianshen Hu1, Jack Raisanen1, Chan Foong1, Bruce Mickey1, Samuel Barnett1, Dwight Oliver1, Paul Yell1, Edward Pan1, Dennis Burns1, Charles White1, Elizabeth Maher1, Robert Bachoo1. 1UT Southwestern Medical Center\n\nInfiltrating astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas of low to anaplastic grade (WHO grades II-III), in spite of being associated with a wide range of clinical outcomes, are often difficult to subclassify and grade. Unlike oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, which can be identified by the presence of 1p/19q LOH, and glioblastomas, which are diagnosed based on objective features on routine hematoxylin and eosin sections, the WHO criteria for the subclassification of grade II-III astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas (A+OA II-III) are not as clearly defined. The current criteria depend on features such as nuclear roundness and significant mitotic activity, leaving much room for subjective interpretation in individual cases.\n\nWe recently identified nestin, a protein expressed by stem cells, as a strong prognostic marker in human A+OA II-III tumors (p=0.0004; n=50) (Hatanpaa et al., J Neurooncol 117:183-9, 2014). Both nestin protein and mRNA level correlated with total survival. In multivariate survival analysis, nestin and IDH 1/2 mutation status remained highly significant, whereas histological covariates failed to reach significance (WHO grade II vs. III, presence of oligodendroglial component, MIB-1 index). All tumors were negative for 1p/19q LOH by PCR and EGFR amplification by CISH.\n\nHere, we show that by combining information on nestin positivity, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and IDH 1/2 mutation status, evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the IDH1 R132H mutation and followed by IDH 1/2 sequencing of the cases that are negative, A+OA II-III tumors can be divided into three groups with markedly different clinical outcomes (p<0.0001): (1) nestin negative and IDH mutated (both favorable), (2) nestin negative and IDHwt or nestin positive and IDH mutated (mixed favorable/unfavorable), and (3) nestin positive and IDHwt (both unfavorable). The total survival was favorable and similar to 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas for group #1, intermediate for group #2, and dismal and similar to glioblastomas (median survival, 1.5 years) for group #3.\n\n4\n\nLoss of CDKN2A/p16 is Associated with Shortened Overall Survival in Grade II and III Gliomas\n\nGerald Reis1, Melike Pekmezci1, Helen Hansen1, Roxanne Marshall1, Terri Rice1, Joanna Phillips1, John Wiencke1, Margaret Wrensch1, Kyle Walsh1, Arie Perry1. 1University of California San Francisco\n\nBackground: Lower WHO grade (II and III) gliomas (LGG) vary widely in clinical behavior and are classified as astrocytoma (A2), oligodendroglioma (O2), and oligoastrocytoma (OA2) or anaplastic astrocytoma (A3), oligodendroglioma (O3), and oligoastrocytoma (OA3). Anaplasia depends greatly on mitotic activity with CDKN2A loss considered the most common mechanism for cell cycle dysregulation. Thus, we investigated whether loss of the CDKN2A gene or its product, p16, is associated with patient survival across pathologically and genetically defined subtypes.\n\nMethods: UCSF Adult Glioma Study cases (95 males and 70 females; average age: 43.2 and 41.1 years, respectively) consisted of 57 O2, 34 A2, 29 OA2, 20 O3, 16 A3, 9 OA3. Molecular parameters included isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 or IDH2) (97%) and 1p19q status (88% of oligodendroglial tumors). CDKN2A deletion was assessed by FISH, while p16 and MIB1 (Ki-67) labeling indices (LI) were determined immunohistochemically. Cox proportional hazards modeled overall survival, stratifying by histology and adjusting for sex, age, grade, and molecular subtype. 66 events (deaths) were observed with median follow-up time of 6.4 years.\n\nResults: Reduced p16 LI was associated with decreased overall survival across all grades (P=0.05) and adjusted for age, histology, and IDH status (P=0.02). CDKN2A deletion was strongly associated with worse survival in astrocytomas (P=0.002; HR=4.4; 95% CI=1.73-11.0) but not oligodendrogliomas or oligoastrocytomas (P=0.60 and 0.96, respectively). IDH mutation and CDKN2A deletion were inversely associated across all subtypes (p=0.03). CDKN2A FISH and p16 IHC results were only weakly associated (P=0.10), while no clear associations between CDKN2A and MIB1 (P=0.21) or p16 and MIB1 (P=0.21) were found.\n\nConclusions: Loss of p16 expression is associated with shortened survival in all LGG, whereas CDKN2A deletions decrease survival in astrocytomas, most being IDH wild type. CDKN2A/p16 studies may provide further clinical aid in LGG sub-stratification beyond IDH and 1p19q studies.\n\n5\n\nBiopsy Site has Important Prognostic Implications in Gliomas\n\nRocio Guevara de Bonis1, Marta Brell1, Javier Ibanez1, Carmen Vidal1, Francisca Nebot1, Marta Couce2. 1Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma, Spain; 2University Hospitals Case Medical Center\n\nPredictive biomarkers are part of the diagnostic tests battery in gliomas. Some patients, in spite of bearing predictors of poor behavior will have longer survivals; whereas others, with good prognostic markers, will have shorter life expectancies. Recently, the generally accepted good predictive value of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation (MGMTpm), was questioned. In addition, one study reported that only those patients with wild type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1wt) would benefit from that prediction. Biochemical and molecular characterization of distant regions of gliomas could be key to understand these different clinical responses.\n\n44 patients undergoing gross total resection of gliomas were consented for the study (11 low-grade gliomas (LG), and 33 high-grade gliomas (HG)) and followed from 36 to 85 months. Central and peripheral tumoral regions were examined. IDH1 mutation (IDH1mut) (by immunohistochemistry and sequencing analysis), IDH1 mRNA expression and MGMTpm were evaluated.\n\n1) IDH1 mutation was present in 72.7 % LG and 18.2 % HG, and showed no regional differences. 2) IDH1 mutation was associated with longer survival, particularly in HG (p<0.05). 3) HG, had significantly higher expression of IDH1mRNA as compared with LG (p<0.05). 4) A positive correlation between IDH1 mutation and MGMTpm was identified (p<0.01). 5) MGMT was more frequently methylated in central regions in both types of gliomas (29.4% HG and 42.9 % LG were methylated in central and not in peripheral regions). 6) Chemotherapy was beneficial for those patients with concomitant MGMTpm, and IDH1mut.\n\nWe conclude that the combination of IDH1mut and MGMTpm predict the best possible outcome for these patients. MGMTpm alone does not increase the survival in IDH1wt gliomas in our study. In addition, we found that biopsies from central regions in gliomas are more informative in order to accurately characterize the MGMTpm in these tumors.\n\n6\n\nIs hTERT Immunohistochemistry Predictive of 1p/19q Co-deletion in Grade II-III Diffuse Gliomas?\n\nChristina Appin1, Daniel Brat1. 1Emory University School of Medicine\n\nBackground: One mechanism for maintaining telomere length in diffuse gliomas is by activating somatic mutation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter. hTERT promoter mutations are associated with increased gene expression and are frequently present in IDH-mutated, 1p/19q co-deleted and in IDH-wildtype diffuse gliomas, but rarely in those that are IDH-mutated, 1p/19q intact. We investigated whether the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of hTERT was predictive of 1p/19q co-deletion among IDH-mutated diffuse gliomas.\n\nMethods: IHC for hTERT and IDH1 mutant protein (R132H) was performed on 43 grade II-III diffuse gliomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to assess 1p and 19q status. Diffuse gliomas immunostained for hTERT included 20 IDH1-mutated, 1p/19q co-deleted tumors; 15 IDH1-mutated, 1p/19q intact tumors and 8 IDH1-wildtype, 1p/19q intact tumors. Statistical analysis of correlations between alterations was performed using Chi-square analysis.\n\nResults: IHC expression of hTERT was detected in 15 of 20 (75%) IDH1-mutated, 1p/19q co-deleted gliomas; 6 of 8 (75%) IDH1-wildtype gliomas; and 6 of 15 (40%) IDH1-mutated, 1p/19q intact gliomas. Among the IDH1-mutated gliomas, we found a significant correlation between hTERT expression and 1p/19q co-deletion (p = 0.0364). However, IHC expression of hTERT was only 75% sensitive and 60% specific for 1p/19q co-deletion within IDH1-mutated gliomas. The positive predictive value of hTERT IHC for 1p/19q co-deletion was 71% and the negative predictive value was 64%.\n\nConclusions: hTERT IHC expression was noted in 75% of IDH1-mutated, 1p/19q co-deleted tumors and 75% of IDH1 wildtype, 1p/19q intact tumors. However, the frequency of hTERT IHC expression in IDH1-mutated, 1p/19q intact gliomas (40%) suggests that this test is not highly specific or predictive for 1p/19q co-deletion.\n\n7\n\nTERT Promoter Mutation is Associated with Older Age at Diagnosis, Independent of Glioma Grade, Histology and IDH1/2 Status\n\nMelike Pekmezci1, Gerald Reis1, Helen Hansen1, Terri Rice1, Shichun Zheng1, John Wiencke1, Arie Perry1, Margaret Wrensch1, Kyle Walsh1. 1University of California San Francisco\n\nBackground: Young age at diagnosis is a favorable prognostic factor and impacts clinical management of patients with infiltrating glioma. The literature suggests that grade II tumors and oligodendroglial tumors are diagnosed at younger ages than anaplastic and astrocytic tumors, respectively. With the exception of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, molecular features driving these age differences remain largely unknown. Heritable variation in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene is associated with later age at diagnosis in glioma patients. We sought to evaluate whether somatic TERT mutations are also associated with later age at diagnosis in glioma patients, within strata of grade, histology and IDH1/2 status.\n\nMethods: Adults (age ≥18 years) with histopathologically confirmed infiltrating glioma were selected from the UCSF Adult Glioma Study (n=351). The TERT promoter region was analyzed by Sanger sequencing and tumors were classified as TERT-wild type and TERT-mutated. Associations between TERT status and age at diagnosis were assessed by t-tests.\n\nResults: TERT promoter mutation was associated with an approximately 8 year older age at diagnosis across all glioma grades (gradeIV p=0.0003, GradeIII p=0.014, GradeII p=0.0001) and histologies (Glioblastoma p=0.0003, Astrocytoma p=0.007, Oligodedroglioma p=0.16, Mixed p=0.005). Among patients with IDH wild-type grade II-III gliomas, TERT promoter mutation was associated with a 10 year older age at diagnosis (p=0.0065). Among patients with IDH-mutated grade II-III gliomas, TERT promoter mutation was associated with a 7 year older age at diagnosis (p=0.0002). Overall, patients with IDH mutation who lack TERT promoter mutation have the youngest age at diagnosis (Average=36.5). This group consists primarily of astrocytic neoplasms.\n\nConclusions: Somatic mutations in IDH are associated with younger age at diagnosis, while somatic mutations in TERT promoter are associated with older age at diagnosis. Among patients with IDH mutated tumors, those with TERT mutation (primarily oligodendroglioma) are diagnosed at later ages than those without TERT mutation (primarily astrocytoma).\n\n8\n\nEfficacy of Mono and Dual PI3K and MAPK Inhibition in Glioblastoma and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastasis Models\n\nRobert McNeill1, Amanda Van Swearingen1, Ryan Bash1, Salma Azam1, Demitra Canoutas1, Brian Constance1, Ralf Schmid1, Carey Anders1, C. Miller1. 1University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\n\nGlioblastoma (GBM) and triple-negative breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are biologically aggressive with limited therapeutic options. The MAPK and PI3K arms of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling are attractive therapeutic targets because they are mutationally activated in both diseases. We defined the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of brain penetrant pan-PI3K (BKM120) and MEK1/2 (AZD6244) inhibitors in GBM and BCBM models. GBM was modeled using G1/S-defective murine (TRP) and human (NHA-RAS-AKT) astrocytes with genetically activated PI3K and MAPK signaling. BCBM was modeled using SUM149, an established, basal-like, BRCA1-mutant human cell line. BKM and AZD inhibited in vitro growth of both TRP and NHA-RAS-AKT astrocytes by >95 and ∼75% at 1-100 μM. BKM inhibited downstream PI3K signaling (decreased p-Akt and p-S6), while AZD6244 inhibited MAPK signaling (decreased p-Erk). Compensatory activation of the non-targeted pathway was evident in TRP astrocytes treated with either drug alone. Dual inhibition was required to ablate compensatory signaling and was synergistic at ∼4-110 μM in vitro. Daily treatment of established (10 d) orthotopic TRP GBM allografts in syngeneic mice with BKM (30 mpk), AZD (37 mpk), or both (25 and 18 mpk) did not delay growth by bioluminescence imaging nor provide a significant survival benefit (96, 108, and 84% of untreated animals). In contrast, while BKM and AZD mono-therapy inhibited SUM149 cell growth similar to GBM astrocytes, drug synergism was evident at ∼0.08-10 μM and the same treatment regimens delayed growth of established (20 d) intracranial SUM149 xenografts and prolonged median survival (116, 160, and >178% of untreated animals). Thus, despite similar in vitro efficacy in both model systems, dual BKM and AZD therapy was less synergistic and efficacious in the GBM vs. BCBM models tested here. These results suggest that GBM and BCBM may have unique, intrinsic resistance mechanisms to PI3K and MAPK inhibitors.\n\nPLATFORM SESSION 2: NEURODEGENERATIVE 1 - AD, CTE, PRIONS Friday 8-10 AM, June 13, 2014 Culture Ballroom\n\n9\n\nPyroglutamylated Amyloid-β correlates with Hyperphosphorylated Tau and Severity of Alzheimer's Disease\n\nJohannes Attems1, Lauren Walker2, Radmila Santic3, Ajeet Rijal Upadhaya4, Sean Colloby1, Dietmar Thal4, Alan Thomas1, Achim Schneeberger3, Markus Mandler3. 1Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University; 2Newcastle University; 3Affiris AG; 4Laboratory of Neuropathology, University of Ulm\n\nPyroglutamylated amyloid-β has been suggested to play a major role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis as amyloid-β oligomers containing pyroglutamylated amyloid-β might initiate tau dependent cytotoxicity. We aimed to further elucidate the associations between pyroglutamylated amyloid-β, amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau in human brain tissue. We examined 41 post mortem brains (mean age 79.6 years, SE: ±1.5) of both Alzheimer's disease (n=18) and controls. Adjacent sections from each frontal and entorhinal cortex, were stained with pyroglutamylated amyloid-β, hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid-β specific antibodies. We used image analysis to quantitatively assess loads for pyroglutamylated amyloid-β, hyperphosphorylated tau and non-pyroglutamylated amyloid-β. All loads were significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease as compared to controls (p⩽0.01). However, regression analysis using amyloid-β loads as independent variables revealed that only frontal pyroglutamylated amyloid-β load independently predicted the presence of Alzheimer's disease (p=0.01). In frontal and entorhinal cortices pyroglutamylated amyloid-β load independently predicted hyperphosphorylated tau load (P<0.001), while non-pyroglutamylated amyloid-β failed to do so. All loads correlated with neurofibrillary tangle Braak stages and Thal amyloid-β phases (P<0.01). However, partial correlation analysis revealed respective correlations in the frontal cortex only for pyroglutamylated amyloid-β load while in the entorhinal cortex respective correlations were seen for both hyperphosphorylated tau and non-pyroglutamylated amyloid-β loads. Mini Mental State Examination scores were predicted by entorhinal hyperphosphorylated tau load independent of other entorhinal loads (P<0.001) and by frontal pyroglutamylated amyloid-β load independent of frontal non-pyroglutamylated amyloid-β load (P=0.01). Here, we report an association between pyroglutamylated amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau in human brain tissue and an influence of frontal pyroglutamylated amyloid-β on both the severity of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and clinical dementia. Our findings further support the notion that pyroglutamylated amyloid-β may represent an important link between amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau and investigations into its role as diagnostic and therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease are warranted.\n\n10\n\nTDP-43 Influences Cognition, Memory Loss and Hippocampal Atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease\n\nKeith Josephs1, Jennifer Whitwell2, Stephen Weigand3, Melissa Murray4, Nirubol Tosakulwong3, Amanda Liesinger4, Leonard Petrucelli5, David Knopman1, Bradley Boeve1, Robert Ivnik6, Glenn Smith6, Clifford Jack2, Joseph Parisi7, Ronald Petersen1, Dennis Dickson4. 1Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology; 2Mayo Clinic, Department of Radiology; 3Mayo Clinic, Department of Health Science Research (Biostatistics); 4Mayo Clinic, Department of Neuroscience (Neuropathology); 5Mayo Clinic, Department of Neuroscience (Molecular Neuroscience); 6Mayo Clinic, Department of Psychiatry (Neuropsychology); 7Mayo Clinic, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether the TAR DNA-binding protein of 43kDa(TDP-43) has any independent effect on the clinical and neuroimaging features typically ascribed to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and whether TDP-43 pathology could help to shed light on the phenomenon of resilient cognition that has been observed in AD. Three hundred and forty-two subjects pathologically diagnosed with intermediate-high probability AD were screened for the presence and distribution of TDP-43. In addition, we quantitatively measured the burden of TDP-43 in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. All subjects had been classified as cognitively impaired or cognitively normal, prior to death. Atlas-based parcellation and voxel-based morphometry were used to assess regional atrophy on MRI. Regression models controlling for age at death, apolipoprotein ε4, Braak stage, CERAD, Lewy bodies and vascular pathologies were utilized to explore effects between TDP-43 and cognition or brain atrophy, stratified by Braak stage. Additionally, we determined whether the effects of TDP-43 on outcome variables were mediated by hippocampal sclerosis. One-hundred and ninety-five (57%) cases were TDP-positive. After accounting for age at death, apolipoprotein ε4, and the other AD related pathologies, TDP-43 had a strong effect on cognition, memory loss, and medial temporal atrophy in AD. These effects were not mediated by hippocampal sclerosis. The TDP-positive subjects were 10X more likely to be cognitively impaired at death compared to the TDP-negative subjects. Greater cognitive impairment and medial temporal atrophy were associated with greater TDP-43 burden and more extensive TDP-43 distribution. TDP-43 is an important factor in the manifestation of the clinico-imaging features of AD and appears to be able to overpower what has been termed resilient brain aging. TDP-43 therefore should be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.\n\n11\n\nNovel Fluid Biomarkers for Brain Amyloid in Presymptomatic Alzheimer Disease\n\nRichard Perrin1, Hua Weng2, Kelley Coalier1, Anne Fagan1, Chengjie Xiong1, David Holtzman1. 1Washington University School of Medicine; 2Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine\n\nBackground: Clinical trials for Alzheimer disease (AD) are now targeting Aβ production or clearance to combat amyloid deposition. In this circumstance, low CSF Aβ42 may serve as an indicator of target engagement, but will lose its utility as an independent surrogate marker for brain amyloid. PET ligands Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and florbetapir (Amyvid) may still be effective for detecting plaques, but PIB is inconvenient to use at distance from a cyclotron, florbetapir may have limited sensitivity for small changes in plaque burden, and both are expensive. In this study, we sought to identify novel fluid biomarkers for very early amyloid deposition.\n\nMethods: Paired CSF and plasma samples, collected from 142 Knight ADRC participants with normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0) within 2.5 years of PET-PIB imaging, were analyzed using the 190MAP biomarker discovery panel at Myriad/RBM (Luminex platform). Mean cortical PIB binding potential [MCBP] above/below 0.18 was treated as a categorical variable for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate markers in combination. Age, gender, education, and APOE-[Latin Small Letter Open E]4 status were treated as covariates.\n\nResults: In multivariate ROC analyses, 22 plasma and 17 novel CSF proteins yielded areas under the curve (AUC) > 0.6 (max 0.662 & 0.687) for predicting MCBP >0.18. CSF tau/Aβ42 ratio combined with p-tau181 was the best predictor, with AUC = 0.963. As an alternative (e.g. for trials targeting Aβ42), a combination of CSF tau, α-1-AT and adiponectin yielded an AUC = 0.797. In plasma, a combination of apoA2, apoE, and PAI-1 yielded an AUC of 0.748.\n\nConclusions/Discussion: Many novel fluid proteins have potential as early brain amyloid biomarkers. These may facilitate clinical trials that directly target Aβ, aid screening for preclinical AD, and provide insights into the pathophysiology surrounding very early plaque deposition.\n\n12\n\nBeclin1/BECN1 Interacts with Surface APP and Facilitates Its Internalization and Sorting for Autophagosomal Degradation\n\nEdward Plowey1, Wan Zhu1, Gayathri Swaminathan1. 1Stanford University School of Medicine\n\nMacroautophagy, hereafter designated autophagy, is a vesicular trafficking pathway for autolysosomal degradation that is thought to protect neurons from diverse stressors. Recent studies suggest that deficiencies in the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, an essential autophagy regulatory protein complex, may be an important factor in age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD). Studies in BECN1+/- mice and cell line models have highlighted an important role for BECN1 in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and in reducing the secretion of its toxic metabolite amyloid-beta. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying BECN1- mediated APP degradation is crucial for the design of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce amyloid-beta secretion and toxicity in AD. We hypothesized that BECN1 interacts with APP and promotes its trafficking for autolysosomal degradation in lieu of amyloidogenic metabolism in the endosomal pathway. Using co-immunoprecipitations, we identified novel interactions of APP with the autophagy regulatory proteins BECN1, PIK3C3, UVRAG and ATG16L1. We further found that APP associates with BECN1 at the plasma membrane by co-immunoprecipitation from cell-surface fractions and that BECN1 promotes surface APP internalization and trafficking to autophagosomes. Mapping studies using BECN1 and APP mutants indicated that the association between APP and BECN1 is primarily mediated by the evolutionary conserved domain of Beclin1 and by the C-terminus of APP . Furthermore, BECN1 binding to APP was regulated by presence of ubiquitination sites, spanning lysines 649-651, in APP C-terminus while mutation of APP endocytic motif (YENPTY) had no effect. In summary, our studies reveal a novel functional interaction between surface APP and BECN1 and its significance in regulation of APP sorting from the cell surface for degradation.\n\n13\n\nBeta-amyloid Accumulation in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy\n\nThor Stein1, Victor Alvarez2, John Crary3, Gaoyuan Meng1, Ann McKee1. 1Boston VA Medical Center; 2Boston University; 3Columbia University Medical Center\n\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease induced by repeated mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). It is a tauopathy characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and tau-positive processes that preferentially involve the cortical sulci, medial temporal lobe, diencephalon, and brainstem. In CTE the tau pathology is predominantly subpial, perivascular, and within the sulcal depths. This tau pathology may be due to axonal injury, disruptions of the blood brain barrier, and vascular damage—alterations that also have been linked to Alzheimer disease (AD). In fact, trauma is a suspected risk factor for AD, and multiple mild TBIs may play a causative role in the development of AD as well as CTE. Thus, we examined our cohort of athletes and military veterans with CTE (n=92) for beta-amyloid deposition with standard histology, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and APOE genotyping. We find that Aβ neuritic plaques occur in 37% of all cases of CTE and are significantly associated with age at death and the presence of APOE ε4 allele, but not with the duration of trauma exposure, disease duration, or CTE stage adjusted for age. We also examined sulcal versus gyral levels of Aβ and found that Aβ1-40, but not Aβ1-42, is significantly increased within the sulcus in both AD and CTE with AD subjects. The percentage of leptomeningeal vessels with cerebral amyloid angiopathy is significantly elevated within the sulcus of subjects with CTE and Aβ, but not in AD subjects alone. Overall, this suggests that parenchymal beta-amyloid accumulation occurs independently of mild traumatic brain injury and CTE, but that cerebral amyloid angiopathy is exacerbated by trauma at the sulcal depths.\n\n14\n\nSingle Episode of Severe Axonal Injury in Humans Can Lead to Tau Pathology Resembling Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy\n\nSarah Edgerton1, Sharon Shively1, Elliott Mufson2, Dushyant Purohit3, Daniel Perl4. 1Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine; 2Rush University School of Medicine; 3Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; 4Uniformed Service University, F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine\n\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). In CTE, tau proteins aggregate forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and astrocytic tangles in a stereotyped distribution, favoring subpial sulcal depths, perivascular regions and superficial neocortical layers. Some have suggested that these tau aggregates develop following axonal damage. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that axonal damage in the human brain can give rise to neurofibrillary and astrocytic tangle formation by analyzing postmortem brain tissues from six schizophrenic patients who underwent prefrontal leucotomy. Because leucotomy involves severing axons leading to and from the prefrontal cortex, this procedure represents a single, severe axonal injury without external cortical impact in patients who survived at least another 40 years. We examined cortical tissues at the lesion sites, prefrontal cortices rostral and frontal cortices caudal to the lesion sites, temporal cortex and hippocampus with immunohistochemistry for abnormal tau. Temporal cortex and hippocampus revealed scant NFTs, consistent with age. In all 6 cases, significant abnormal tau was detected in the gray matter adjacent to the lesion sites, with primarily astrocytic tangles in depths of sulci and NFTs in superficial neocortical layers, but not in the prefrontal and frontal cortices distant to the lesion sites. We conclude that axonal damage from leucotomy leads to accumulations of abnormal tau in gray matter adjacent to the lesion with features resembling CTE. Since significant tau pathology was not detected in prefrontal cortices, the data do not support the hypothesis that chronic neuronal deafferentation alone leads to abnormal tau accumulation. Moreover, since leucotomy lacks external cortical impact, the data suggest that selective accumulation of tau at depths of sulci may be related to underlying axonal damage rather than mechanical stresses during TBI.\n\n(Supported by the US Army Military Research and Materiel Command and the CNRM.)\n\n15\n\nGlycans Modulate the Transmissibility of PrPSc and the sCJDMM2 and sFI Phenotypes\n\nLaura Cracco1, Ignazio Cali1,2, Anya Hurley1, Liuting Qing1, Qingzhong Kong1, Pierluigi Gambetti1. 1National Prion Disease Surveillance Center, Case Western Reserve University; 2Second University of Naples\n\nSporadic fatal insomnia (sFI) and the subtype of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) identified as sCJDMM2 share methionine homozygosity at codon 129 (129MM) of the prion protein (PrP) gene and scrapie PrP (PrPSc) type 2 although they are associated with different phenotypes. Our data suggest that the sFI and sCJDMM2 phenotypic heterogeneity is in part related to the diversity of the PrPSc glycans in these two diseases.\n\nTo further investigate the role of glycans in phenotypic determination, we transmitted sCJDMM2 and sFI to i) transgenic (Tg) mice expressing normally glycosylated human (Hu) PrPC [Tg(HuPrPC)] and ii) Tg mice expressing human PrP free of glycans [Tg(HuPrPglycKO)]; incubation periods, histopathologies and PrPSc characteristics were compared.\n\nTg(HuPrPC) mice challenged with sCJDMM2 and sFI became symptomatic 631±93 and 554±60 days post inoculation (dpi), respectively. sCJDMM2-inoculated mice showed large-vacuole spongiform degeneration (SD) and a PrP immunostaining pattern similar to that of sCJDMM2. Minimal small-vacuole SD was observed in half of the sFI-inoculated mice and was associated with sFI-like PrP immunostaining. Proteinase K-resistant PrPSc (resPrPSc) type 2 was detected in both groups of mice. In contrast, sCJDMM2- and sFI-inoculated Tg(HuPrPglycKO) became symptomatic 278±36 and 354±155 dpi, respectively. Both displayed similar histopathologies characterized by widespread SD and PrPSc deposition in focal plaque-like and large granules. In both, resPrPSc formed only one band of ∼19 kDa matching the electrophoretic mobility of unglycosylated resPrPSc type 2.\n\nIn conclusion: 1) sCJDMM2 and sFI can be transmitted to Tg(HuPrPC) mice, producing different histopathologies; 2) transmission to Tg mice expressing human glycan-free PrP appears to abrogate the histopathological differences of these two diseases, supporting a role of glycans in phenotype determination; 3) in our model, PrP glycan ablation increases the transmission efficiency of both sCJDMM2 and sFI.\n\n(Supported by P01AG 14359, CDC UR8/CCU515004, NS052319 and Charles S.

To investigate the mechanism of mixed PrPSc 1-2 types formation, we examined co-occurrence, transmissibility, disease phenotype prevalence and brain propagation of PrPSc using brain homogenates from a) sCJDMM1-2 harboring PK-resistant PrPSc (resPrPSc) types 1 and 2, b) in vitro mixed types 1 and 2 individually harvested from separate regions of sCJDMM1-2 and c) in vitro mixed PrPSc from sCJDMM1 and sCJDMM2, following intracerebral inoculation into transgenic mice expressing human PrPC-129M. The ratios of type 1/type 2 were 50%/50%, 35%/65% and 10%/90% in a), b) and c), respectively. Mice were sacrificed after 95, 131, 187 days post inoculation (dpi). All mice showed only resPrPSc type 1. Mice inoculated with PrPSc type 1-2 had incubation time, lesion profiles and resPrPSc features identical to those of mice inoculated with sCJDMM1 (183±22 dpi) and different from those of sCJDMM2-challenged mice (609±139 dpi). At 95 dpi, mice showed tiny amounts of resPrPSc type 1 in the central brain with spongiosis and PrP immunostaining in the thalamus. At 131 dpi, resPrPSc type 1 spread to the cerebral cortex and brain stem. The lesion profile reflected the resPrPSc distribution. At 187 dpi, resPrPSc type 1 affected the whole brain. We conclude that: 1) Mice reproduce PrPSc type 1 and sCJDMM1 phenotype regardless of PrPSc types 1 and 2 ratios in the inoculum. 2) Replication rate of type 2 is much slower than that of type 1 and is not accelerated by the presence of type 1. 3) In sCJDMM1-2, type 1 maintains the same infectivity, propagation and phenotype characteristics of type 1 of sCJDMM1.\n\n4) Topography and timing of PrPSc propagation are highly reproducible.\n\n(Supported by P01AG14359, CDCUR8/CCU515004, NIHNS062787, NS052319 and Charles S. Britton).\n\nPLATFORM SESSION 3: INFLAMMATORY, OPHTHALMIC, OTHER Friday 2-4 PM, June 13, 2014 Fashion Ballroom\n\n17\n\nTransient Receptor Potential Melastatin 4 Expression in Human Cerebral Infarcts\n\nRupal Mehta1, Svetlana Ivanova1, Cigdem Tosun1, Rudy Castellani1, Volodymyr Gerzanich1, J Simard1. 1University of Maryland\n\nTransient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4), a mammalian cation channel, is transcriptionally upregulated in neural and vascular cells following acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in humans and animal models. Prior studies document a leading role of this molecule in cytotoxic edema formation and necrotic cell death following diverse acute central nervous system injuries. The expression of TRPM4 in human cerebral infarcts, however, has not previously been systematically analyzed. In this study, we evaluated expression of TRPM4 in postmortem specimens obtained from 15 patients within the first 31 days after clinical onset of focal cerebral ischemia. Significant elevation of TRPM4 protein was found in neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells in infarcted cerebrum, relative to contralateral and control tissues. Upregulation of TRPM4 protein was corroborated using in situ hybridization for TRPM4 mRNA. Furthermore, co-association of TRPM4 and sulfonylurea 1 (SUR1) was detected using co-immunoprecipitation and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. These findings document upregulation of SUR1-TRPM4 ion channels during focal ischemic stroke in humans. These new data indicate that SUR1-TRPM4 channel upregulation and activation are likely key molecular events leading to cell death during acute stroke, suggesting that SUR1 may be a promising novel treatment target for patients with acute cerebral infarction.\n\n18\n\nLymphocytic Hypophysitis: A Single Centre Experience of 11 Cases\n\nMarc Del Bigio1, Angela Miller2, Jayantha Herath3. 1Pathology - University of Manitoba; 2University of Manitoba; 3Ontario Forensic Pathology Service\n\nIn the province of Manitoba Canada (population 1.4 million) all neurosurgical procedures and almost all autopsies are done at a single center. We did a retrospective review spanning the years 1996-2012, searching records for documentation of inflammation in the pituitary (2228 glands from adult autopsies, 1267 from pediatric autopsies, 339 surgical biopsies). Proven or likely infectious causes and cases with predominantly neutrophilic inflammation associated with hemorrhage or infarction were excluded. This left 11 cases with non-granulomatous predominantly T lymphocytic inflammation (7 autopsy, 4 surgical). The autopsy cases ranged from 11-64 years and the surgical cases 27-82 years (total 5 females including 1 pregnant). Among the autopsy cases, 3/7 had a clearly unrelated cause of death and no history of relevant symptoms; the pituitary inflammation was considered incidental. One had a history of seizures; there was no anatomical cause of death. In the 7 autopsy cases, other endocrine organs were available for analysis; 4/4 adrenal glands, 4/5 thyroid glands, and 2/5 pancreases had T lymphocytic inflammation within the parenchyma. In four cases the decedent had exhibited pre-mortem clinical syndrome associated with that organ (38 year female hypothyroidism; 49 year female hyperprolactinemia; 44 year male Addison disease and hypothyroidism; 49 year female diabetes mellitus); in the first three, pituitary dysfunction was considered contributory to the deaths. Immunohistochemical staining showed reduced immunoreactivity for some or all of the pituitary hormones in all of the cases. Although the prevalence of autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis is low, we conclude that examination of the pituitary gland is an important part of the autopsy in individuals who die unexpectedly, particularly if they have a history of endocrine disease or recent neurological symptoms.\n\n19\n\nMyelin Loss in Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy/Leukodystrophy with Axonal Spheroids is Secondary to Axonal Loss\n\nMurad Alturkustani1,2, Julia Keith3, Lili-Naz Hazrati4, Lee-Cyn Ang1. 1London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western, London, ON; 2Department of Pathology, King Abdulaziz University and Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 3Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; 4Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, Toronto, ON\n\nBackground: Whether the myelin loss in adult-onset leukoencephalopathy/leukodystrophy with axonal spheroids (ALAS) is a primary demyelinating process or secondary to axonal degeneration has not been clearly established. The confluent myelin loss with U-fibre sparing gives an impression of a primary demyelinating/dysmyelinating disease. Although, the prevalence of axonal spheroids would favor a primary axonal degeneration with secondary demyelination, occasional axonal spheroids have been described in chronic primary demyelination as in multiple sclerosis (MS). In spite of the recent discovery of CSF1R mutation in ALAS, it is uncertain how this mutation correlates with the observed pathology.\n\nMethods: We examined neuropathological features in 5 ALAS cases (3 males: 2 females; age 39-61 years) and 3 chronic MS cases (1 male: 2 females; age 50-73 years). Special histochemical stains, immunohistochemical stains and ultrastructural studies were used to study the axonal and myelin pathology.\n\nResults: The white matter pathology in ALAS cases can be characterized as 3 evolving phases: 1) white matter with numerous spheroids in a background of well-myelinated fibres or slight myelin pallor; 2) white matter showing mixture of well-preserved myelinated fibres and degenerating fibres with sparse to moderate number of spheroids; and 3) leukodystrophy-like pattern of confluent myelin loss with relative preservation of the subcortical U-fibres, few spheroids and myelinated fibres. No convincing areas with demyelinated but relatively intact axons have been identified in our ALAS cases. In contrast, the chronic MS plaques show complete myelin loss with relatively preserved axons. Axonal spheroids are occasionally present in these plaques but not in the areas with preserved myelin.\n\nConclusions: Our study supports the notion that the myelin loss in ALAS is secondary to axonal degeneration.\n\n20\n\nCharacteristic of neural tissue in ovarian teratomas associated to Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE)\n\nDavid Munoz1, Gregory Day2, Simin Laiq2, David Tang-Wai22. 1St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto; 2University of Toronto\n\nObjective & Methods: ANMDARE is the most common form of paraneoplastic encephalitis that preferentially affects women of reproductive age; over half have ovarian teratomas (OT). Most women with OT, however, do not develop ANMDARE. We investigated the histological differences between OT in 5 women with ANMDARE (mean age 28.2±8.6 years) and all OT resected at a single hospital during 2013 (39 OT from 38 women, mean age 34.8±10.0 years).\n\nResults: Neural tissue was identified in 80% (4/5) of ANMDARE-associated OT and 51.3% (20/39) of control OT. Dysplastic neurons, often showing binucleation or multinucleation, were present in all cases with neural tissue but not in any controls (p=0.0001). If found in the brain, one case would have been diagnosed as a ganglioneuroblastoma, as dysplastic neurons occurred together with mitotically active neuroblasts and maturing neurons; the other 3 OT contained mature neurons and glial cells and would have been called gangliogliomas. In one OT the area showing this change was tiny, less than 300 um in diameter. Neural tissue was intimately associated with inflammatory cell infiltrates in all four cases but not in any controls (p=0.0001). The neural tissue often formed a rim around lymphoid follicles, suggesting that the centrally-located inflammatory cells may have focally obliterated underlying dysplastic neurons. Central nervous system tissue in control OT often showed ferruginated neurons and/or Rosenthal fibers, construed as degenerative/reactive changes.\n\nConclusion: We conclude that ANMDARE-associated OT differs from ordinary OT in the presence of dysplastic neurons in neural tissue and topographical relation of inflammatory infiltrates. The very small size of the areas involved in some cases suggests that dysplastic neurons may be easily missed. We hypothesize that the development of dysplastic neurons in OT triggers the inflammatory response that results in the production of ANMDARE and the partial obliteration of areas with dysplastic change.\n\n21\n\nAstrocytic Regulation of Synaptic NMDA Receptors\n\nJunghyun Hahn1, Xianhong Wang1, Marta Margeta1. 1University of California San Francisco\n\nA growing body of evidence indicates that astrocytes regulate the formation and function of excitatory synapses, but little is known about the effect of glia on glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDARs). To investigate glial modulation of neuronal NMDARs, we performed electrophysiological, cell biological, and biochemical experiments on hippocampal neurons cultured either alone, with a mixed population of glia, or with pure astrocytes. While there was no significant change in EC50 of the NMDA-induced current between various culture conditions, the maximal current density was twice as large in mixed compared to neuronal cultures; a similar increase in NMDAR current density was seen when neurons were cultured in the presence of pure astrocytes, either directly or indirectly. The amplitude of NMDAR-mediated (but not AMPA receptor-mediated) miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents was significantly greater in mixed relative to neuronal cultures, resulting in a significantly lower synaptic AMPA/NMDA current ratio when neurons were cultured with glia; however, there was no difference in plasma membrane expression of major (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) NMDAR subunits between mixed and neuronal cultures. Astrocyte-induced potentiation of NMDAR currents was limited to the synaptic pool of NMDARs; furthermore, the proportion of NR2B subunit-dependent NMDAR currents, but not NR2A-dependent NMDAR currents, was greater in mixed than in neuronal cultures. Taken together, these data indicate that astrocyte-mediated increase in the neuronal NMDAR current (1) is postsynaptic; (2) is not due to an increase in the total number of synapses, (3) is induced by one or more astrocyte-secreted soluble factors, and (4) reflects posttranslational regulation of NR2B-containing NMDAR channels already present at postsynaptic sites, presumably on a rapid time scale. Given the role of NR2B NMDARs in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, our findings suggest that NMDAR modulation is an important mechanism by which astrocytes can impact neuronal circuits in both normal and disease states.\n\n22\n\nA Novel Telomere Phenotype In Human Retinal Photoreceptors\n\nWilliam Bell1, Christopher Heaphy1, Ian Rosenthal1, Alan Meeker1, Charles Eberhart1. 1The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions\n\nMany neoplasms maintain telomeres via a telomerase-independent mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), but normal human tissues are not known to utilize such pathways. We previously surveyed over 6,000 different malignancies with telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and found that the ALT phenotype is particularly common among neural neoplasms, but was never identified in the 541 benign neoplasms and 264 diverse non-neoplastic tissue samples examined. We recently expanded our analysis to include ocular samples, and unexpectedly identified ALT-like telomere DNA foci in normal retina. Using rod and cone specific antibodies, it was determined that the phenotype was largely restricted to rods. In total, 124 human retinas were examined, including 8 fetal, 22 infant, 10 childhood and 84 adult eyes. The ALT-like phenotype was fairly homogenous within each retina, but some variation was noted from eye to eye within each age group. The ALT-like telomere foci showed an age-dependent onset. They were never seen in fetal eyes, and were very rare in infants and children. Our adult eye cohort included 38 cases with pathological conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa, and the ALT-like phenotype was very prominent in these. Interestingly, we also analyzed the eyes of two patients with an inherited short telomere syndrome caused by reduced telomerase function. These both showed the ALT-like phenotype in photoreceptors, raising the possibility that, like cancer-associated ALT, this retinal phenotype is independent of telomerase activity. We analyzed eyes from several rodents of varying ages, but these did not show the ALT-like telomere phenotype. In summary, we identify ALT-like telomere DNA foci in human retinal cells not present in any other normal tissue examined to date. The process is not detected in children, and its function is not yet clear.\n\n23\n\nIntraocular Medulloepitheliomas in Children and Adults show Markers of Retinal Development and Glioneuronal Differentiation\n\nMatthew Rose1, Alia Rashid2, Frederick Jakobiec2. 1Dept. of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard; 2Dept. of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard\n\nIntraocular medulloepithelioma is a rare tumor arising most often near the ciliary body of the eye. It is frequently characterized by tubular and/or papillary growth of pseudostratified neuroepithelial ribbons, sometimes mixed with differentiating regions. While they generally exhibit a distinct morphology, these tumors can display regions of heterologous differentiation. We seek to further characterize the patterns of gene expression in medulloepithelioma to determine whether these tumors exhibit immunohistochemical markers reflecting their histogenetic origin. We report a series of five cases of medulloepithelioma including three pediatric (ages 1, 6, and 8 months) and two adult cases (ages 30 and 45 years), with four arising near the ciliary body and one arising from a retinal coloboma. All tumors expressed S100. In addition, both of the classic pediatric cases arising near the ciliary body showed a remarkably similar immunohistochemical expression pattern with CRX labeling primitive neuroectodermal units and GFAP and NeuN labeling areas of glial and neuronal differentiation, respectively. One of these tumors was very small and involved primarily the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium from the ora serrata to the iris, offering a glimpse into the early stages of tumor growth. One adult case likewise showed CRX and synaptophysin expression, while the other showed only CRX expression without markers of glioneuronal differentiation. In contrast, the last pediatric case appeared to arise from a coloboma and showed areas of myogenic rather than glioneuronal differentiation, although it focally showed primitive neuroectodermal morphology. With follow-up intervals ranging from eight months to eleven years, all five patients are alive with no reported recurrence of tumor following enucleation. Overall, these findings highlight immunohistochemical markers of retinal development and glioneuronal differentiation which are consistent with the origin of medulloepitheliomas in the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium of the pars plicata or pars plana interfacing with the peripheral retinal ora serrata.\n\n24\n\nOpthalmological Abnormalities in CTE\n\nVictor Alvarez1, John Crary2, Nathalie Slick1, Brian Fry1, Thor Stein3, Ann McKee3. 1Boston University School of Medicine; 2Columbia Presbyterian School of Medicine; 3VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine\n\nRepetitive concussive injury is associated with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive brain degeneration characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) neurofibrillary tangles in the brain (McKee et al., 2009, Goldstein et al., 2012, McKee et al 2013). CTE produces symptoms of irritability, impulsivity, depression, memory loss, and suicidality that may progress to dementia and parkinsonism in late stages. The neuropathological changes of CTE are distinctive and easily distinguished from other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Key neuropathological features of CTE are p-tau neurofibrillary tangles around small blood vessels, neuroinflammation, and deposition of abnormal aggregates of TDP-43, a protein associated with ALS, alpha B crystallin, a small heat shock protein, and p62, an autophagosome marker. We have diagnosed CTE at post-mortem examination in over 100 former football players, hockey players, boxers and military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts exposed to blast injury (McKee et al 2013). Currently, there is no method of detecting CTE during life and the diagnosis can only be made at autopsy. Nothing is presently known about the eye pathology of CTE but if a distinctive profile of ocular abnormalities were identified, it would raise the possibility that CTE could be diagnosed during life by eye examination. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that p-tau inclusions, neuroinflammation and abnormal aggregates of the proteins TDP-43, alpha B cystallin, and p62 are found post-mortem in the inner plexiform layer of the retina in individuals with advanced CTE that were not found in age-matched controls. These findings suggest that the ocular pathology of CTE is unique and that methods of in vivo detection might be developed to diagnose CTE opthalmologically during life.\n\nPLATFORM SESSION 4: DEVELOPMENTAL/PEDIATRIC Friday 2-4 PM, June 13, 2014 Culture Ballroom\n\n25\n\nDevelopment of the Hippocampal Formation in Human: Part I-Pyramidal Cell Layer\n\nSara Cipriani1, Catherine Verney1, Jeannette Nardelli1, Anne-Lise Delezoide1, Pierre Gressens1, Homa Adle-Biassette2. 1INSERM UMR 1141; 2Department of Pathology, Lariboisiere Hospital, APHP & INSERM UMR 1141\n\nThis is the first detailed study describing the development of hippocampal formation in human embryos and fetuses from 8 weeks of gestation (GW) to midgestation. Multiple immunohistochemical labelings were performed to study the progenitors using Ki67 associated with nestin, SOX2, PAX6 and TBR2, and post mitotic neuronal markers using NeuN, CUX1, SATB2, CTIP2, TBR1, NeuroD1, doublecortin, CaBP, and Calretinin. Our results showed the presence of a gradient of neurogenesis starting first in the entorhinal cortex and extending toward the ammonic plate. The proliferation of Pax6+ or Sox2+ progenitors was already observed at 9 GW in the ventricular zone. Intermediate-stage progenitors labeled by Tbr2 were present at 11 GW in the subventricular zone. The density of both types of progenitors progressively decreased around 20GW. Postmitotic neurons appeared during the embryonic stage. In the ammonic plate Tbr1, CTIP2 and Cux1 labeled numerous cells, some of which were colabeled with Sox2 and Pax6. They progressively migrated to the deep and superficial layers of the ammonic plate until midgestation. The density of SATB2-labeled neurons in the ammonic plate was lower compared to the other layer markers and to the subicular / entorhinal cortical plates.\n\nIn conclusion, neurogenesis in the hippocampal formation starts during the embryonal period. The pattern of expression of transcription factors suggests that postmitotic neurons are produced directly from funding progenitors and from intermediate-stage progenitors. The lamination of the pyramidal layer follows an in an inside out gradient, producing a three-layered ammonic plate compared to the entorhinal cortex.\n\nThe research leading to these results was performed in the frame of DEVELAGE project “Pathways common to brain development and ageing: defining strategies for preventive therapy and diagnostics” (HEALTH-F2-2011-278486) and has received funding from the European Community's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013).\n\n26\n\nFetal Nucleus/fasciculus Solitarius: Synaptophysin Maturation\n\nHarvey Sarnat1, Laura Flores-Sarnat1. 1University of Calgary and Alberta Children's Hospital\n\nBackground: The nucleus/fasciculus solitarius is the respiratory centre of the brain, also known as the pneumotaxic centre. It consists of paired longitudinal columns in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata, extending to the cervical spinal cord. A white matter core of longitudinal axons (fasciculus) is surrounded by neurons (nucleus), a primitive arrangement. Afferent fibres to the nucleus solitarius arise mainly from chemoreceptors and stretch receptors in respiratory muscles and lung. Efferent axons descend the fasciculus to innervate spinal motor neurons to the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles. This nucleus is essential for fetal rhythmical respiratory movements observed by real-time ultrasound and postnatal respiration.\n\nMethods: Sections of medulla oblongata of 20 normal fetuses of 9-40 weeks gestation were studied at autopsy by immunoreactivity to synaptophysin and other markers of neuronal maturation: NeuN, calretinin, NSE. Three fetal chromosomopathies, two preterm neonates with apnoea of prematurity and 2 cases of Möbius syndrome also were examined.\n\nResults: Synaptogenesis in the nucleus solitarius begins early in the human fetus, at 10-11 weeks gestation, and it is advanced by 15 weeks. Delayed synaptophysin expression was found in 2 premature infants with apnoea but not in infants with chromosomopathies; maturation of other neuronal markers was not altered. The nucleus was bilaterally infarcted in 2 infants with Möbius syndrome.\n\nConclusions: Hypoxia, metabolic disturbances and other adverse events affecting late 1st and 2nd trimester fetuses may impair the rate of formation of synapses in the nucleus solitarius and explain some cases of apnoea of prematurity and SIDS. Symmetrical watershed tegmental infarcts may involve the nucleus solitarius to account for central respiratory insufficiency in neonates with Möbius syndrome.\n\n27\n\nRadial Glia Defects and the Pathogenesis of Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage.\n\nJennifer Cotter1, Mianzhi Tang1, Eric Huang1. 1University of California San Francisco, Department of Pathology\n\nGerminal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is a life-threatening condition that affects over 12000 infants per year in the US. Its pathogenesis has been attributed to alterations in hemodynamics and/or vascular fragility, but the mechanism of its development remains poorly understood. We evaluated human autopsy tissues from the Pediatric Neuropathology Research Lab to study potential developmental alterations in the setting of GMH. Brain sections from preterm infants with GMH (n=5) and without (n=13), ranging from gestational ages of 16 to 36 weeks were evaluated. Using stereology, we found no differences in vascular branching or vascular density within the germinal matrix (GM) between controls and GMH cases. Furthermore, in situ hybridization for vasculogenic factors, VEGF, TGFbeta and integrin beta8, showed no detectable differences in the expression of these genes in the GM. To characterize how altered neurogenesis within the GM may contribute to the pathogenesis of GMH, we performed immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, Nkx2.1, Sox2, Nestin, and NeuN. Consistent with previously published data, human GMH cases showed reduced Ki-67 and Sox2 labeling indices within the GM when compared to controls. Intriguingly, similar to mouse ganglionic eminence (GE), human GM could be further sub-divided into a medial compartment (MGE) with high Nkx2.1 expression and a lateral compartment (LGE) with low Nkx2.1. Using Nestin as a marker for radial glia, we found that in control cases, the MGE showed higher radial glia density than the LGE. In contrast, GMH cases over 28 weeks gestational age demonstrated decreased Nestin-positive radial glia not only adjacent to hemorrhage, but also in the contralateral GM. The finding of reduced radial glia density in bilateral GM of preterm infants with GMH suggests that the developmental differences in radial glia between controls and the brains of preterm infants with GMH most likely contribute to the pathogenesis of GMH.\n\n28\n\nA Century of Brain Hemorrhages in Autopsied Premature Infants at a Tertiary Pediatric Hospital\n\nMarco Hefti1, Robin Haynes2, Rebecca Folkerth3, Felicia Trachtenberg4, Joseph Volpe2, Hannah Kinney2. 1Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess/Harvard Medical School; 2Boston Children's Hospital; 3Brigham and Women's Hospital; 4New England Research Institutes\n\nThe care of premature infants in the 20th century is remarkable for technical advances that have dramatically improved survival, but little is known about changes in the neuropathology of the premature infant over this time frame. We hypothesize that neuropathologic entities have changed over the last century, disappearing because of improvements in care, or arising anew due to unforeseen complications of new treatments and/or increased length of survival. To begin to test this hypothesis, we examined germinal matrix hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) and intraparenchymal cerebellar hemorrhage (CH) in 351 premature infants (gestational age 24-37 weeks) autopsied at Boston Children's Hospital from 1924 to 2010. There was a median of 39 cases/decade (range 16-66). Over the course of the study, gestational age decreased from 31.6 (1924-1930) to 29.0 (2001-2010) weeks (p<0.001), and survival increased from 1.5 to 14.5 days (p<0.001). The incidence of GMH-IVH increased from 2.7% before 1950 to 37.7% from 1970-1980, and then decreased to 15.4% after 1990 (p<0.001), as adjusted for infant gestational age and length of survival time. The incidence of CH showed a significant linear trend, increasing from 2.7% prior to 1950 to 20.5% after 1990 (p=0.005). The incidence of GM-IVH increased >3-fold around the time of the introduction of positive pressure ventilation into premature intensive care in the mid-1960s. The increased incidence of GM-IVH in the 1970-1980s likely reflects respiratory and hemodynamic imbalances complicating mechanical ventilation; the subsequent decreased incidence likely reflects stabilization of respiratory function with the use of surfactant beginning in the 1980s. In contrast, the incidence of CH gradually increased into the 1990's, suggesting that factors other than those related to mechanical ventilation are involved and require elucidation.\n\n29\n\nHippocampal Anomalies in Sudden Unexplained Death in Young Children: An Extended Series.\n\nMarco Hefti1, Jane Cryan1, Elisabeth Haas2, Marjorie Grafe3, Laura Crandall4, David Patterson1, Lisa Teot1, Felicia Trachtenberg5, Hannah Kinney1, Henry Krous2. 1Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital; 2Department of Pathology, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego; 3Department of Pathology, Oregon Health and Sciences University; 4SUDC Program, Hackensack, NJ; 5New England Research Institute, Watertown, MA\n\nSudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) is the sudden death of a child older than 1 year that remains unexplained after a review of the clinical history, circumstances of death, autopsy, and ancillary testing; its incidence in children 1-3 years is 1.3/100,000. Previously, we reported a putative new entity of SUDC associated with hippocampal/temporal lobe (TL) maldevelopment with or without a personal and/or family history of febrile seizures (FS) in a subset of children aged 1-6 (Kinney HC et al. Ped Dev Pathol 2019; 12: 455-463). Sixty-four SUDC cases were accrued from 2002-2007 in an autopsy study of sudden unexpected death (77% SUDC, 23% explained); of the 49 SUDC cases, 46% with hippocampal sections (12/26) had substantial microdysgenesis. From 2007-2011, we accrued 88 additional cases (SUDC, 88%). We tested the hypothesis that a larger sample size confirms the observation of hippocampal anomalies associated with SUDC. We report combined findings in the cohort of 151 cases (1-6 years) based upon review of clinical records, autopsy and scene reports, microscopic slides, and family surveys. The demise categories were: SUDC, 80% (n=121); explained/known causes, 13% (n=19) (e.g., infection, accidents); undetermined, 5% (n=7), and epilepsy, 3% (n=4). There was no difference in age at death, male gender, or preterm birth among the groups. In the SUDC group, 49% (59/121) had a personal and/or family history of FS compared to 11% (2/19) of known causes (p=0.003). Of the SUDC cases, 97% were discovered after a sleep period, and 86% in the prone position. Hippocampal/TL review revealed 43% (36/83) of SUDC cases had gross and/or microscopic anomalies compared to 13% (2/16) of known causes (p=0.02). Of these SUDC cases, 31% had a personal FS history, and 17%, a family FS history only. Future research is needed towards identifying living young children at risk for sudden death.\n\n30\n\nConstruction of a Single Adenoviral Vector Carrying Both ZFN and Donor for the Treatment of Lysosomal Storage Diseases\n\nQinwen Mao1, Weifeng Zhang2, Esther Bit-Ivan1, Eileen Bigio1, Haibin Xia2. 1Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; 2Shaanxi Normal University, China\n\nMany lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) have devastating consequences including neurodegenerative diseases. Although enzyme replacement therapy is a potential treatment option, this approach needs repeated injection over the lifetime of the patients. Gene-addition strategy using viral vectors has the potential for long-term expression of the therapeutic protein, however, serious adverse effects, e.g., immune response to in vivo administered viral vectors, and insertional activation of proto-oncogenes, can occur. An alternative to gene addition that can minimize the oncogenic risk of gene therapy is targeted gene correction via homologous recombination. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) show promise as reagents that can mediate high-frequency homologous recombination in the presence of a donor. This technique has shown success in ex vivo correction of a disease-causing mutation by using induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be useful for the treatment of diseases affecting cells that can be removed and returned to the patient. However, many LSDs might need in vivo gene correction in affected organs, which requires the efficient introduction of gene-targeting components (i.e., ZFNs and donor fragment) in vivo. We utilized adenovirus, a high-efficiency and safe vector with sufficient size to fit both ZFN and donor to mediate gene correction in vivo. We have overcome the challenges of packing both ZFN and donor in a single adenovirus, and produced ZFN expressing adenovirus with high titer. We also show that this novel system efficiently mediates targeted genome editing. In summary, adenovirus may be a promising vector for in vivo gene correction in disease-affected organs in lysosomal storage diseases.\n\n31\n\nThe KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 Reduces Activated Microglia and ASD Like Behavior in a Rat Model of Neonatal HI Brain Injury\n\nMirna Lechpammer1, Yen Tran2, Philip Huebner2, Yi-Je Chen3, Robert Berman4, Lee-Way Jin2, Heike Wulff3. 1University of California Davis School of Medicine; 2Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, UC Davis; 3Department of Pharmacology, UC Davis; 4Department of Neurosurgery, UC Davis\n\nNeonatal hypoxia/ischemia (HI) causes Encephalopathy of Prematurity (EOP), which is associated with neurobehavioral deficits and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in later life. We assessed the role of the intermediate-conductance calcium-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 in microglia activation after neonatal HI brain injury. We also evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of the selective small molecule KCa3.1 inhibitor TRAM-34, developed by our group, at a molecular level and by behavioral assessments in a rat model of EOP.\n\nWe investigated brain tissue from male Long Evans rats after selective white matter (WM) injury produced in P6 by unilateral carotid artery ligation (UCL) followed by severe hypoxia (UCL/HI). The immunocytochemical analysis has shown an increased expression of KCa3.1 in activated microglia (Iba1+) in rat WM in P10 following UCL/HI at P6. TRAM-34 (40 mg/kg i.p. every 12 hours for 3 days) initiated 12 hours after UCL/HI inhibited microglial response at P10 as demonstrated by the reduced number of activated microglia in WM compared to vehicle treated controls. Likewise, a significant reduction (p=0.04) in WM injury (MBP staining) was observed at P14 in TRAM-34 treated rats (40 mg/kg i.p. every 12 hours for 7 days) compared to controls. When their behavior was assessed by the three-chambered sociability test, young rats (P31-33; n=15) exposed to UCL/HI at P6 exhibited resistance to change and impaired preference for social novelty. Importantly, TRAM-34 has prevented this ASD-like behavior and restored normal preference for social novelty as observed in healthy controls.\n\nPresented results indicate increased immunoreactivity of KCa3.1 in activated microglia following HI pro-inflammatory stimuli in neonatal rat brain. Our data also demonstrate feasibility of prevention/reversal of cognitive consequences of EOP by in vivo pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1, which in turn may have translational clinical potential for this as yet untreatable cause of neurocognitive deficits, including autism and cerebral palsy.\n\n32\n\nDevelopmental Synaptic Plasticity Defects in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome\n\nChristopher William1, Lubna Saqran2, Matthew Stern2, Matthew Frosch1, Bradley Hyman3. 1Neuropathology Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; 2Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital; 3MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, MGH, Boston, MA\n\nUnderstanding the molecular basis for cognitive delay in Down syndrome (DS) is a challenge that would be aided by assays of circuit function in models of the disease. Synaptic plasticity is critical for circuitry refinement; to explore whether defects in synaptic plasticity may contribute to developmental impairment in DS, we have assessed visual system plasticity in a partial duplication mouse model of DS, the Ts65Dn line.\n\nOcular dominance plasticity is the process by which loss of vision in one eye, monocular deprivation (MD), causes changes in connectivity that result in an increase in the area of primary visual cortex responsive to the non-deprived eye and a strengthening of the relative magnitude of responses to stimulation of the non-deprived eye compared to stimulation of the deprived eye. Trisomic and non-trisomic litter mate mice underwent MD via lid suture over six days between P27 and P35. Expression of the immediate early gene Arc was used to determine the width of the cortical domain responsive to the non-deprived eye ipsilateral to that eye. To assess the magnitude of cortical responses to stimulation of each eye, optical imaging of intrinsic signals was performed on awake, head-fixed mice, before and after MD. Following MD, trisomic mice fail to demonstrate an expansion of the domain of visual cortex responsive to the non-deprived eye (trisomic width, 944 ± 77.89 microns, n=5; non-trisomic width, 1087 ± 87.44 microns, n=13; p=0.0028, T-test). Non-trisomic mice demonstrate strengthening of responses to non-deprived eye stimulation (pre-MD dF/F, 0.37%, n=6; post-MD, 0.52%; p=0.01, T-test), however, trisomic mice fail to demonstrate an increase in response strength following MD (pre-MD, 0.5%, post-MD, 0.49%, n=9; p=0.21, T-test). These data suggest that Ts65Dn mice demonstrate plasticity defects that will be used in future studies to explore the molecular basis for developmental and cognitive impairment in DS.\n\nPOSTERS: DAY 1 10-10:30 AM, 4-4:30 PM, June 13, 2014 Foyer\n\n33\n\nAn Interesting Case Of Sarcoid Myopathy\n\nLuis Gonzalez-Cuyar1, Desiree Marshall1, Nina Bozinov1, Zackary Hoffer1, Michael Weiss1, B. Distad1, C. Keene1. 1University of Washington\n\nWe report the case of a 69-year-old man with clinical history of sarcoidosis initially diagnosed in his 20's with lifelong weakness that has progressively worsened over the last 2-3 years. Physical exam was notable for diffuse weakness and wasting (proximal worse than distal) as well as finger flexor and extensor weakness. MRI showed a nonspecific myopathy that involved the pelvis as well as the bilateral thighs. Electromyography revealed a mild predominantly chronic myopathy and laboratory studies revealed creatine kinase of 53 U/L. The patient underwent a left vastus biopsy which was characterized by myonecrosis with patchy lymphohistiocytic and granulomatous inflammation, HLA-I upregulation and neurogenic atrophy in the setting of endomysial fibrosis and moderate to focally severe fiber size variation. Rimmed vacuoles, TDP-43 positive inclusions and ultrastructural evidence of sarcoplasmic filamentous inclusions were also identified. Chronic sarcoid myopathy syndrome is characterized by symmetrical muscle weakness and wasting in the limb girdle and proximal limbs with often normal serum CK and granulomatous inflammation on muscle biopsy. Although rimmed vacuoles are a relatively non-specific myopathic feature, examples of sarcoid myopathy in concomitance with features of inclusion body myositis (IBM) have rarely been reported. Coexisting neurogenic features, as in this case, are often present.\n\n34\n\nNeuromuscular Pathology of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome: A Rare Case Report and Review of Literature\n\nKeng-Chih Su1, Negar Khanlou1, Anthony Verity1, Jennifer Yi1. 1Neuropathology Department, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA\n\nBannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), now a category of PTEN hamartoma-tumor syndromes (PHTS), is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis resulting from mutations in PTEN. A neuromuscular clinical presentation is also seen in affected young children. However, reports on associated neuromuscular pathology are rare in the literature. We report a 5-year-old with infantile cerebral palsy and clinical consideration of BRSS, presenting with acute leg pain on exertion, left leg hypertrophy and fatigability. Motor weakness was noted in the affected limb at examination. MRI of the left leg showed focal edema and enhancement without mass lesion. A left rectus femoris muscle biopsy was obtained. The fascicular architecture was overall preserved while the epimysium was site of angiolipoid hamartomas associated with extensive nodular lymphohistiocytic inflammation. Intra-tumoral vascular changes including perivascular inflammation and intimal hyperplasia were frequently noted. Myofiber study was abnormal including dysmaturation neuromyopathy, an unusual subsarcolemmal pattern of intra-fiber lipid distribution without hyperlipidation, neurogenic change and type II fiber smallness. Conclusion: To our knowledge skeletal myofiber pathology observed in this biopsy was scarcely reported in patients with BRRS. A direct association of dysmaturation phenomenon with PTEN status cannot be ruled out and requires further investigation. This case also underlines the importance of skeletal muscle biopsy not only in patients with BRRS but also in young children with early neuromuscular symptoms. The syndrome is known to be underdiagnosed because of its phenotypic variability, its incomplete penetrance, and the frequency of its individual components in the general population. While macrocephaly, intestinal polyposis and sub-mucocutaneous tumors are common findings, the neuromuscular presentations are less recognized as heralding symptoms. In addition to access to tumor pathology, the muscle biopsy allows for the diagnosis and study of skeletal muscle damage in early stages of its progression and proactive clinical management of its complications.\n\n35\n\nNovel Homozygous Cofilin-2 (CFL2) Mutation Causing a Congenital Form of Nemaline Myopathy with Filamentous Inclusions\n\nLeslie Bruch1, Sheraden Mundy2, Natalie Hauser2, Joseph Shen2. 1University of Iowa; 2Children's Hospital Central California\n\nNemaline myopathy most often presents as a congenital myopathy characterized by hypotonia and muscle weakness; it is pathologically distinguished by the presence of nemaline rods. Seven causative genes have thus far been identified with 6 of the 7 encoding proteins associated with sarcomeric thin filaments. The function of the seventh gene has not yet been identified. Cofilin-2 (CFL2) encodes an intracellular protein that is involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. Mutations in CFL2 are known to be responsible for nemaline myopathies in only two families, both with consanguinity. We describe a novel homozygous mutation in CFL2 presenting as congenital hypotonia with pathologic features showing overlap between those of nemaline myopathy and other protein aggregate myopathies. The proband initially presented at 3 weeks of age due to poor oral intake and respiratory distress, but feeding difficulty had been present since birth. He was born to consanguineous parents after an unremarkable pregnancy. His weakness progressed to ventilator dependency, and he received a tracheostomy and gastrostomy button placement. At 3.5 months of age he had minimal movement of his extremities. CPK was elevated up to 780 U/L. A left quadriceps muscle biopsy showed increased fiber size variation and scattered fibers with inclusions composed of finely granular red-purple material on trichrome as well as a few fibers with larger inclusions characteristic of nemaline rods. No necrosis, inflammation, fiber type disproportion or predominance was found. Electron microscopy demonstrated areas of sarcomeric disarray with filamentous inclusions, mini-cores and occasional nemaline bodies or rods. Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 4 (c.353C>A, p.Ala118Asp). This new case represents the third family described with mutations in CFL2 and further expands the clinical and pathologic phenotype associated with this genotype.\n\n36\n\nDiagnostic Pitfall with Use of Alpha-dystroglycan Immunostain in Perimortem Muscle Biopsies\n\nAmanda Kan1, Sophelia Chan2. 1Department of Clinical Pathology, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong; 2Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital\n\nAbnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (aDG) occurs in certain forms of congenital muscular dystrophy. Immunostaining for aDG is a convenient and useful tool in workup for congenital muscular dystrophy in muscle biopsy. The degree of reduction of aDG immunolabelling often correlates with disease severity. However, we encounter two perimortem muscle biopsies with no clinical evidence of congenital muscular dystrophy but absence immunostaining for aDG. We propose the loss of staining or alteration protein expression affecting the group of dystrophin and dystrophin-associated complex at the terminal stage of life being physiological or artifactual.\n\n37\n\nUnusual Pathologic Features in a Patient with Laing Early Onset Distal Myopathy\n\nMarta Margeta1, Grant de la Motte2, Nigel Laing3. 1University of California San Francisco; 2Palo Alto Medical Foundation; 3University of Western Australia\n\nLaing early onset distal myopathy (MPD1) is a rare form of distal myopathy caused by mutations in MHY7 myosin heavy gene. Clinical presentation of MPD1 patients is fairly stereotypical (development of complete bilateral foot drop in the early childhood, followed by a very slow clinical progression in subsequent years); in contrast, the reported biopsy findings are relatively nonspecific. Here, we present a patient with MPD1 whose muscle biopsy showed distinctive light microscopic and ultrastructural features. The patient, a 39 year old male, developed bilateral foot drop at age 5, but is otherwise asymptomatic and physically active. Physical exam showed bilateral weakness of ankle dorsiflexors (1/5), toe extensors (1/5), and finger extensors (4+/5); creatine kinase level was within the normal limits. The disease first developed in the patient's paternal grandmother and is transmitted in autosomal dominant fashion, with all affected family members showing the same clinical phenotype. The quadriceps femoris biopsy showed moderate variation in muscle fiber diameters, mild endomysial fibrosis, scattered nuclear clumps, and type 1 fiber predominance (85%), but no degenerating/regenerating fibers or rimmed vacuoles. In addition, randomly distributed type 1 (but no type 2) fibers showed abnormal invaginations of sarcolemma that were most readily apparent on ATPase, NADH and Toluidine blue stains. On ultrastructural analysis, these abnormal membrane invaginations were reminiscent of myotendinous junctions, except for the degree of complexity and the lack of clustering in a single area of the specimen. Genetic analysis of the patient and three affected relatives showed heterozygous deletion of GAG triplet at position 4522-4524 of MHY7 gene, which results in a deletion of a glutamate residue at position 1508 of the beta myosin heavy chain protein [c.4522_4524delGAG (p.Glu1508del)]. This case suggests that the spectrum of histopathologic findings associated with MPD1 is wider than previously believed.\n\n38\n\nGranulomatous Fungal Myositis Presenting as Isolated Unilateral Myalgia: A Case Report\n\nOsama Elkadi1, Jiang Qian2. 1Albany Medical Center/College; 2Pathology, Albany Med Ctr Hosp/APS\n\nFungal myositis is a rare but serious form of myositis, with very few cases reported in the literature. It usually occurs in the setting of immunocompromise, especially in AIDS patients. The most common isolated fungal organisms are aspergillus and cryptococcus. Here we report a case of isolated fungal myositis without evidence of disseminated disease.\n\nThe patient is a 48 year-old African American female with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, status post liver transplant on immunosuppression. She presented with left lower extremity pain, tenderness and mild swelling. MRI showed increased STIR signals most evident in the flexor compartment, suggesting myositis. After ruling out DVT and compartment syndrome, a left gastrocnemius muscle biopsy was obtained, which revealed necrotic / regenerative muscle fibers and a non-necrotizing, vaguely granulomatous inflammation with dense mononuclear infiltrates composed mainly of CD3 positive T lymphocytes (CD4-dominant) and CD68 positive histiocytes with occasional multinucleated giant cells. Among the inflammatory infiltrates were multiple small spherical forms which were pale and slightly refractile on H&E stain, negative on AFB, mucicarmine and alcian blue stains, but confirmed on GMS and PAS-D stains to be yeast-form fungi, most consistent with blastomyces species. The patient received systemic antifungal therapy, amphotericin, followed by oral fluconazole. CSF and blood cultures were negative, as was culture from the second muscle biopsy 23 days after the initial diagnosis. Two and half months later, she had low-grade fever and abdominal pain, but otherwise stabilized. Her HIV testing was negative. She had elevated anti-nuclear antibody titer in the past, but anti-mitochondria antibody, smooth muscle antibody and rheumatoid factor were all within normal.\n\nThis case illustrated that a high index of suspicion for infectious etiology should be raised in inflammatory myopathy work-up in immunocompromised patients, so that early accurate diagnosis can be achieved and appropriate treatment promptly administered.\n\n39\n\nRegional Necrotic Myopathies: Border Zone Muscle Fiber Necrosis Associated with Dermatomyositis Syndromes and Neoplasms\n\nChunyu Cai1, Rati Choksi2, Ali Alshehri2, Alan Pestronk2. 1Department of Pathology and Immunology, WUSM; 2Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine\n\nIntroduction: Necrosis and regeneration of scattered muscle fibers are common features of many active myopathies. We studied a series of patients with acquired myopathies whose myopathology included an unusual pattern of regional, rather than scattered, muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration.\n\nMethods: Retrospective review of clinical, laboratory, myopathologic and ultrastructual features of seven patients with acquired myopathies having regional necrosis and regeneration of muscle fibers on muscle biopsy.\n\nResults: Clinical features included proximal symmetric weakness with a subacute onset (100%), dysphagia (83%), myalgias (100%), and a skin rash (67%). Serum creatine kinase was often (83%) very high (>1,600 U/L). An associated malignancy was common (71%). Survival was less than one year in 43%. Myopathology included regions of muscle fiber necrosis or regeneration in border zone territories between intermediate-sized perimysial vessels. Muscle fibers and connective tissue in regions of necrosis show C5b-9 deposition and expression of the ischemia marker carbonic anhydrase IX. In areas between the regions of necrotic fibers and perimysial vessels, endomysial capillaries are enlarged and stain for alkaline phosphatase and muscle fibers have upregulated MHC Class I. Intermediate-sized perimysial veins had abnormal structure and increased cellularity, likely marginating macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, in the wall. There were no aggregates of mononuclear cells.\n\nConclusions: Regional necrotic myopathies (RNM) are a distinctive myopathologic, often paraneoplastic, subgroup of dermatomyositis. Muscle fiber damage may be due to ischemia in border zone regions between intermediate perimysial blood vessels.\n\n40\n\nUnusual Presentation of Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy\n\nArmine Darbinyan1, Kenneth Hughes1, Mary Fowkes1. 1Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, NY\n\nWe describe an unusual presentation of hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy in a young woman. The patient was diagnosed at age 9 with biopsy proven autoimmune hepatitis and was treated with azathioprine. She remained active and attended her 1st year of college. At age 18 she developed EBV mononucleosis and subsequently diffuse paresthesias with progressive weakness thought to be Guillann Barr Syndrome variant. She was treated with IVIG with mild improvement. She then developed pancreatitis with autonomic instability and became wheelchair bound with bladder incontinence. Neurologic examination revealed intact CN2-12, profound sensory and proprioceptive loss, weak deep tendon reflexes, 3-4/5 motor strength of upper and lower extremities, mild dysmetria, and inaccurate rapid alternating movements. A motor nerve conduction study revealed absent sensory potentials consistent with a diagnosis of predominantly sensory neuropathy or neuronopathy (ganglionopathy). She developed global encephalopathy in the context of hepatic decompensation, worsening ascites, rising ammonia, with persistent asterixis and expired two months following her initial EBV diagnosis.\n\nAutopsy microscopic examination revealed moderate loss of dorsal root ganglion neurons and diffuse axonal loss in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord without associated inflammation. There was preservation of motor neurons and axons in the descending corticospinal tract of the spinal cord. A deltoid muscle section revealed scattered myocytes with moderate atrophy, no myocyte necrosis, no increase in internalized nuclei, no increase in endomysial or perimysial fibrosis, and no inflammation.\n\nThis histologic phenotype is most consistent with hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy which can have an associated component of muscle weakness with atrophy as seen in this case. Acquired disorders would unlikely present with selective neuronal loss as seen in this case. The finding of preserved motor neurons and axons rules out hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. However, the clinical picture of autoimmune hepatitis and pancreatitis has not been previously reported.\n\n41\n\nParaneoplastic Sensory Neuronopathy In A 63-year-old Man Without A Demonstratable Underlying Malignancy\n\nJenny Smith1, Jeremy Deisch1. 1Loma Linda University\n\nParaneoplastic disorders of the nervous system comprise a heterogeneous group of conditions that are united by autoimmune damage to elements of the central nervous system, mediated by antibodies directed against antigens that cross react with both neoplastic cells and nervous system constituents (i.e. onconeural antibodies). The prototypical example of paraneoplastic nervous system damage is sensory neuropathy with or without central nervous system damage. Many of these cases harbor anti-Hu antibodies. An underlying malignancy is identified in most cases, usually small cell carcinoma of lung origin. We present a case of paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy with minor components of limbic encephalitis and Purkinje cell damage, without demonstrable malignancy by either thorough clinical investigation or autopsy study. The patient was a 63-year-old man with a 45 year smoking history that presented with a forty pound weight loss and three month history of weakness, numbness, and parasthesias. All extremities were weak, most prominent in the proximal legs. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased throughout. An EMG demonstrated a prominent sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Radiologic and endoscopic search for malignancy demonstrated FDG avid hilar and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, but was otherwise negative. Serum onconeural antibody testing revealed anti-Hu, as well as Purkinje cell fluourescence. Anti-Yo antibodies were not detected. A full autopsy was performed, and no malignancy was identified. Neuropathologic examination demonstrated prominent ganglionic depopulation of all dorsal root ganglia. Scattered small aggregates of lymphocytes where present within the dorsal nerve roots and ganglia. Aggregates of residual satellite cells (“nodules of Nageotte”) were frequent. The spinal cord showed prominent degeneration of the dorsal columns. Perivascular chronic inflammation limited to the basal ganglia was noted; the brain was otherwise unremarkable. The cerebellum showed slight Purkinje cell depopulation and Bergmann gliosis. This case demonstrates an example of paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy and encephalomyelitis with clinical and pathologically occult malignancy.\n\n42\n\nExpression of SERPING1 is Increased in Reactive Astrogliosis Associated with Neuroinflammation\n\nAmber Nolan1, Nicole Croom1, Han Lee1, Marta Margeta1. 1University of California San Francisco\n\nReactive astrogliosis was once thought of as a uniform, stereotyped response to injury of the brain. However, recent gene expression profiling data suggests that astrocytic reaction is heterogeneous, with gene expression patterns that depend on the nature of the original insult and thus provide candidates for new reactive astrocyte markers that will be clinically useful in differentiation of equivocal pathologic states. SERPING1 (also known as C1 inhibitor), a serine protease inhibitor which primarily functions to inhibit the complement system, was recently shown to be preferentially expressed in a mouse model of inflammatory brain injury compared to a mouse model of brain ischemia. To asses if this association held true in human disease, we analyzed expression of SERPING1 using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue from surgical and autopsy cases of encephalitis, cerebral ischemic infarct, and pathologically unremarkable brain tissue. Our preliminary results replicate the existing mouse model data. Specifically, while control brain tissue exhibits patchy and weak SERPING1 staining in the cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, brain tissue from patients with encephalitis demonstrates strong cytoplasmic expression of this protein in a population of reactive astrocytes (as confirmed by staining for glial fibrillary astrocytic protein) and to a lesser extent in a subpopulation of nearby neurons. In contrast, infarct tissue shows faint cytoplasmic staining for SERPING1 in reactive astrocytes and neighboring neurons. These results confirm that SERPING1 expression is upregulated to a greater extent in inflammatory compared to ischemic astrogliosis and suggest that SERPING1 may be a clinically useful marker of neuroinflammation in biopsies from patients with an unknown neuropathologic process. Given the recently established role of complement in synapse pruning, increased expression of SERPING1 by neurons and reactive astrocytes may be important for limiting the excessive synapse loss in neuroinflammatory conditions.\n\n43\n\nTwo Cases of Fatal Cerebral Edema with CNS Angiitis\n\nDenise Ng1, Harry Vinters1. 1University of California, Los Angeles\n\nWe report two cases of fatal cerebral edema arising as a complication of two different types of central nervous system angiitis. CASE 1: A 27-year-old male presented with flu-like symptoms, fever, truncal rash and myalgia after treatment of cutaneous abscess. Six days after his initial presentation, he developed diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status and a witnessed grand mal seizure. Despite initial CT head being unremarkable, he had another seizure during a lumbar puncture. His repeat imaging showed severe global cerebral edema with cerebellar tonsillar herniation. His other laboratory investigations showed mildly elevated eosinophil count and CSF protein of 406 mg/dL. His medical history includes previous episode of meningoencephalitis with rash of unknown etiology 10 years previously. Autopsy brain examination shows bilateral cerebellar tonsillar herniation with midbrain compression and multifocal subacute vasculitis, consistent with primary angiitis of the central nervous system. CASE 2: A 71-year-old woman with past medical history of quadriplegia for severe spinal stenosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and hypertension presented with headache and altered mental status for approximately 3 days. Initial CT head showed right temporal lobe edema and right to let midline shift. She was treated with steroids for presumed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. She became more obtunded and later hypothermic with unstable blood pressures. Repeat imaging showed worsening cerebral edema. At autopsy, the brain showed edema with Duret hemorrhages. Focally severe granulomatous angiitis in vessels immunoreactive for Abeta was diagnostic for Abeta-related granulomatous angiitis. CONCLUSION: Although both ABRA and PCNSV have distinct clinicopathological features, both cases show that vascular injury can cause impairment of mechanisms important in fluid regulation. Cerebral edema is an uncommon manifestation of vasculitis in the absence of hemorrhage, and may be a result of impaired blood-brain barrier function associated with the angiitis.\n\n44\n\nAutoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1 with Calcification in the Cortical Gray and White Matter and the Basal Ganglia\n\nFahad Bafakih1, Paul Benson2, M. Beatriz Lopes1. 1University of Virginia; 2Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia - Western Office\n\nAutoimmune polyglandular syndromes are rare endocrinopathies that are associated with abnormal endocrine functions and nonendocrine autoimmune dysfunctions. Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) type 1 presents in childhood and might show other manifestations of disease as mucocutaneous candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy. The disease is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE) coding for a putative transcription factor. Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 is seen in adults and is more common than type 1, presenting with autoimmune thyroid disease, adrenal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus type I, and is not associated with AIRE gene mutation. Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 presents with autoimmune thyroid disease and other autoimmune disease with the exception of adrenal involvement. There is no known treatment for these diseases and management consistent mainly of hormone replacement and supportive therapy.\n\nHerein, we report an autopsy of a 27-year-old female with APS type 1 with extensive calcification in the cortical gray and white matter and basal ganglia. The clinical presentation during early childhood included hypoglycemia, hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal crisis. She received multiple hormonal replacement therapies. At age 17, she had an episode of mental status changes thought at the time to likely be multifactorial, a combination of hypoglycemia, HSV meningitis and, perhaps, adrenal crisis. Head CT scan at that time showed extensive calcification of the basal ganglia and scattered calcification of the cortical gray and white matter located in the fronto-parietal lobes that had been documented prior to this episode. The patient was lost in follow-up. At age 27, she was found unresponsive at home and a forensic autopsy was performed. The mechanism resulting the extensive calcification of the deep gray matter is believed to be due to hormonal imbalance specifically hypoparathyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.\n\n45\n\nComparative Analysis of Neuronal Vulnerability of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Hereditary and Sporadic Tauopathies\n\nAdrian Oblak1, Jill Murrell1, Rose Richardson1, Francine Epperson1, Bernardino Ghetti1. 1Indiana University School of Medicine, Dept Path and Lab Med\n\nIn hereditary Frontotemporal Dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 associated with the Microtuble Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) mutations (FTDP-17MAPT), specific neuronal populations may be more vulnerable than in sporadic tauopathies. We have focused on the analysis of hereditary and sporadic tauopathies characterized by 4-repeat (4R) tau. Brains of subjects carrying the following MAPT mutations: IVS10+3, IVS10+16, and P301L were used as well as brains with a neuropathologic diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Histologic methods included hematoxylin and eosin with Luxol fast blue and Thioflavin S. For immunohistochemistry, antibodies raised against tau protein (AT8, 4R tau and 3R tau) and glial fibrillary acidic protein were used. Grey level index acquisition was used to determine the relative density and distribution of tau-immunoreactive (tau-ir) neurons within cortical layers of the anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, neuronal loss and gliosis in the same area was assessed. Tau-ir neurons were more frequently observed in layer II than in layers I, III, V or VI for both the IVS10+3 and IVS10+16 mutation. In the P301L mutation, tau-ir neurons were most numerous in layers II-III and VI than in I and V. Overall, in cases with the IVS10+16 mutation, there were more tau-ir neurons in all layers as compared to the cases with the IVS10+3 and P301L mutation. In CBD and PSP, tau-ir neurons were distributed evenly throughout cortical layers. Overall fewer tau-ir neurons were observed than in hereditary cases. The present findings demonstrate that tau "
