        "text": "The book is based on stories told by the author's mother about her Sakha family life at the end of the nineteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth century. To better understand these stories the author uses her background in genetics to provide molecular and genetic proofs about the origin of the Sakha people of Siberia and their aboriginal cattle. Based on those molecular genetic proofs and also on archaeological, ethnographic, historical, theological and art history data, the author focuses attention on genetical homogeneity of the Sakha people and on their ancient Faith Aar Aiyy that has the common source with all world religions and precedes them. The book offers not a racial vision of the ethnogenesis of the Sakha people, but provides genetic, linguistics and historical data that allows an assumption that the ethnogenesis of the Sakha people is the result of the development and interpenetration of the three ancient ethnogenetic layers of mankind. The author brings forth the idea that the Sakha people as well as all Eurasians, and the indigenous people of America from Amerindian language family - have origin from the same boreal ancestral trunk of mankind that developed in its several thousands years of migrations from Africa to the North-East of the Asia through the land areas of Levant, the Iranian Plateau, Pamir, Tien Shan, Zhetysu, Sayano-Altai, the Baikal region and further to the Middle Lena River valleys eventually on to America. This vision of the people, presented by the author, aims to show the scientific knowledge that there is no biological bases for the negatively overloaded social concept of 'race'. The semantic relationship of wooden carved ritual columns - the Sarga of the Sakha people with the stone megaliths of the Middle East, and also with Totem Poles of the American Indians - descendants of ancient Mississippian culture is shown in the book. On the basis of the analysis of spiritual and applied values of Sarga, the author gives it the epithet \"solar\" and suggests using the \"solar\" characteristics of the Sarga, as one of markers of the ways of ancient migrations of the common ancestors of the Sakha and Amerindian. A search for a place of the Faith of the Sakha people - called \"Aar Aiyy\" on a spiral of Progressive Revelation of the one religion of God, allowed the author to conclude that the initial stages of ethnogenesis of the Sakha people could occur in the Neolithic Anatoly region - where, most likely, worship of the Goddesses of Fertility arose and the wild aurochs - the ancestor of the native Yakutian cattle, was domesticated."
