        "text": "8C THE PALM BEACH POST MONDAY, JULY 23, 1990 sf Wharton, Kuehl finish in dead heat for gold second gold medal on Saturday, won the women's 400-meter freestyle in 4:05.84, nearly five seconds faster than Haley Lewis of Australia. Betsy Mitchell of Marietta, nhin utnn tha woman's 1 Hn.mptpr Goodwill Games backstroke. Elena Volkova earned the Soviet Union its first swirrlming gold, winning the 200-meter breast-stroke in 2.28.64. East Germany won the women's 400-meter free \"My only disappointment was that all the leading runners in the world were not here,\" said Ivan-ova, the only woman in the elite field of nine who has ever run under 2:30. \"These were the second-class runners.\" Her time was 2 hours, 34 minutes, 37 seconds .\n\nWharton, of Warminster, a silver medalist in this event at Seoul, and Kuehl each completed the 400 individual medley in 4:17.74. Officials said they believed it was the first dead heat for first place in a major meet since Americans Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer tied for the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. Evans, of Placentia, who was stopped in her attempt at a inches, nearly 10 feet short of her career-best, and running the 200 meters into a strong headwind in 24.26 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her best. The dismal shot put left Joyner-Kersee 129 points off her record pace, and the relatively slow 200 put her 296 points back. Yet, Joyner-Kersee finished the first day of the heptathlon with a substantial 240-point lead over Larisa Nikitina of the Soviet Union .\n\nIn the women's marathon, Zoya Ivanova, the only legitimate world-class runner in the field, led a Soviet sweep. The field, however, was missing such international stars as Crete Waitz and Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, Joan Be-noit Samuelson of the United States and Rosa Mota of Portugal. The Associated Press SEATTLE It was time to get evert in the Goodwill Games. Dave Wharton did dead even. Next, it's the turn of the U.S .\n\nmen's basketball team. Wharton and Patrick Kuehl of East Germany swam to what is believed to be the first gold-medal dead heat in a major meet in six years Sunday in the men's 400-meter individual medley. \"I could see him the whole race,\" Wharton said, \"and knowing I was behind the last 50, 1 put my head down and went. When I saw the time, it was pretty incredible.\" Janet Evans won her second gold medal of the games in another swimming event, but Matt Biondi failed to win his third. Beaten by Anthony Nesty of Surinam by .01 ago .\n\n\"There is no burden on this team about retribution from the past,\" said Duke coach Mike Krzy-zewski, who is coaching the Goodwill Games team. Joyner-Kersee sub-par Jackie Joyner-Kersee, looking to break the barrier in the heptathlon, made an early assault on that lofty figure before losing all hope with two uncharacteristic sub-par performances. Joyner-Kersee, the world record-holder with 7,291 points, was only three points off her world record pace, after the opening two events of the seven-event competition. But she blew her chance by tossing the shot only 45 feet, 8V2 seconds in the 100-meter butterfly two years ago in the Seoul Olympics, he was beaten by Nesty in the same event again, this time by .40. \"I was more nervous than I've ever been,\" Nesty said .\n\n\"Everybody's telling me I've got to swim Matt again. So that made me a lot more nervous than I usually am.\" The U.S. men's basketball team, meanwhile, plays its first game tonight against Puerto Rico. Tuesday night, there looms a rematch with the Soviets, who beat the Americans and won the gold medal in the Seoul Olympics two years style relay in 3:44.28, edging the United States. Lance Ringnald of Albuquerque, N.M., was the only American gold medalist in individual apparatus gymnastics .\n\nHe tied with Vitaly Scherbo of the Soviet Union on the horizontal bars. Scherbo won four gold and a silver. Ringnald also had a silver and two bronze medals.
