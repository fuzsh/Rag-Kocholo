A finer and more dedicated group of athletes and coaches could never have been assembled: underfinanced, unappreciated, yet unrelenting in their pursuit of the sport. I am obliged to each and every one of them for accepting me into their company. Many of these individuals made significant contributions to this book, especially: William Spencer, John Morton, Peter Hale, Glenn Jobe, Russell Scott, Martin Hagen, Lyle Nelson, Art Stegen and John Ruger. I would also like to acknowledge several other members of the international biathlon and cross-country ski racing community: Nat Brown, Marty Hall, Heikki Ikola, Veli Niinimaa, Dr. Jim Stray-Gundersen, Algis Shalna, Max Cobb and the United States Biathlon Association, Julia Zisman and the Russian Biathlon Union, and Jukka Haltia and the Finnish Biathlon Association. Many friends-too numerous to list in their entirety-have aided and encouraged my writing over the past decade; I would like to thank in particular Rick Johnson, Gordon King, Pelle Nymoen, Tom Sullivan and especially my wife, Betsy Shaw Frank, without whose unflagging support my work would never have reached fruition.

Always on the lookout for skiers who could shoot, the National Team had extended invitations for its annual pre-season camp even to struggling neophytes like me. There, in the company of America's top competitors, I soon realized how much biathletes from the Soviet Union, with their fistfuls of medals, represented the sport's ultimate benchmark. \"They put their pants on just like you do, one leg at a time;' our coaches would tell us, hoping to boost our confidence as world-class competitions approached. I came to find out, however, that the coaches were wrong: those Soviet trousers had a different fit altogether. No country pursued biathlon more resolutely than the Soviet Union, and no other nation garnered greater success at international venues. From the introduction of modern biathlon in 1958 to the USSR's demise in 1991, athletes representing the Soviet Union won almost half of all possible medals awarded in world championship and Olympic competition. The closest rival was Norway, whose national teams gathered a distant 29 percent over the same period of time. 1 Biathletes of the USSR were so dominant that their victory was often a foregone conclusion at these major events. Yet more than sheer technical skill created Soviet superiority in hiathlon. The sport embodied the Soviet Union's culture, educational system and historical experience and provided the perfect ideological platform to promote the state's socialist viewpoint and military might. Biathlon, in short, became much more than simply winning Olympic medals. How the Soviet government interpreted the sport of skiing as a cultural, ideological, political and social tool over seventy years is my primary focus. I attempt to answer why success in cross-country ski racing and biathlon at\n\n4\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nthe international level was so crucial to overall Soviet sport policy. Although biathlon represented only a sliver of the sporting world in the latter half of the twentieth century, its inherent characteristics, which required stamina and precision in a quasi-military setting, dovetailed with important ideological, historical and even artistic concepts promoted by the government. And though only a miniscule piece of the Soviet project, biathlon looms large in the history of global sport: it is impossible to write about biathlon, currently the most popular winter spectator sport in Europe, without considering the significant influence of the USSR. In the beginning, the Soviet Union owned biathlon, and so the stories of both the state and the event are inseparable. To comprehend the Soviet Union's domination of this sport and why it was such an important element of the country's athletic image requires first an understanding of how modern skiing developed in Europe from the end of the nineteenth century through the late 1980s. In Russia, as in other European polities in the twentieth century, sporting events became outlets for an emotional expression of nationalism just as opera and the stage had been during the nineteenth. In the case of skiing, this dramaturgy incorporated the essential elements of virtuousness, heroicism and an imagined link to a mythological past. Beyond this, four crucial factors coalesced in the latter half of the nineteenth century to further the development of skiing: the increasing need for reliable reconnaissance during large-scale military campaigns; the rise of European nationalism; for northern countries, nationalism's relationship to polar exploration; and the growth of sport as a leisure activity. At the turn of the century, all of these notions came together in the avatar of Norwegian polar explorer and scientist Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, who single-handedly propelled skiing from regional obscurity into a global phenomenon. His exploits, along with those of his fellow countryman and protege Roald Amundsen, transformed skiing in Russia from a rural pastime associated with peasants and indigenous tribes into a nationalist trait-the latter augmented by a fascination with Arctic exploration, a concern for homeland defense, a yearning for adventure and, finally, a preoccupation with scientific inquiry and socialist ideology. This turn-of-the-century Russian nationalism wove its way into Stalinist enthusiasm for the Arctic and then, after World War II, became part of the politicized spectacle of international competition in long-distance ski racing and biathlon. Soviet athletes excelled in both disciplines and their success produced a sense of national pride for many of their compatriots while evoking imagery associated with the Russian North, the Great Patriotic War and the Soviet hero.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nCross-country skiing and biathlon were prime examples of socialist realist sport, that is, an idealized portrayal of athletic reality useful in developing socialist consciousness within the Soviet state. Skiing could be accomplished anywhere there was snow, and as a means of transportation it had practical application in building the socialist project. In addition, tens of millions of Soviet citizens skied every winter. Thus ski racing developed as a spectator sport, with huge numbers of enthusiasts attending major ski competitions as much to cheer on their favorite skiers as to observe the subtleties of technique for their own edification. This interest among the citizenry highlighted one of the most significant contradictions in the Soviet sport system, pitting the proletarian concept of mass participation (massovost') in sport and physical culture for the benefit of the collective against the need for athletes with mastery ( masterstvo) who could compete at the international level and gain worldwide prestige for communism. Within this context, I have combined the arguments of several other Soviet historians to bolster the notion that skiing was the quintessential example of socialist realist sport. Amir Weiner contends that ritual representations of the Great Patriotic War were the revolutionary prism through which Party leaders viewed civilian life in the decades following World War II. The government transformed the Great Patriotic War into a myth that defined the Soviet Union to an even greater extent than had any other event in the canon of Soviet \"great moments:' The war superseded foundation myths such as the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War, which had become distant and irrelevant to a new generation of socialists. 2 In a similar vein, Mike O'Mahoney suggests that Soviet participation in activities such as mountaineering and skiing reflected \"an extension of the stoical endurance of the Soviet population during the war;' showing the world that the capacity to persevere in the most extreme of sporting environments was a fundamental \"national\" characteristic. 3 James Riordan writes that the Soviet regime capitalized on the Second World War's emotional impact by staging sports festivals-and naming them after distinguished athletes who died in combat-in order to tap into citizens' yearning for a nostalgic and mythologized past. These ritual commemorations kept the memory of the war alive in people's minds. 4 As a result, in the post-war years the myriad cross-country ski racing eventswhich at times extended from late November through early April all across the Soviet Union-evoked the Armed Forces, the Great Patriotic War and national defense. After the USSR joined the international sporting community in the 1950s, the government transferred these notions wholesale\n\n&\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nto a worldwide stage at major ski competitions and the Winter Olympic Games. Barbara Keys posits that modern Western sport became \"Sovietized\" during this period while at the same time managing to retain a core set of values resistant to ideological transformation. 5 This phenomenon of Sovietization was especially pervasive in the sports of cross-country skiing and biathlon, where the events became a forum for socialist versus capitalist systems, a surrogate battleground, so to speak, between Cold War rivals. Reciprocal animosity across the ideological divide influenced the process by which nations came to be imagined by casting rivals on the ski track as mutual high -stakes antagonists, especially during the team relays. The late 1940s and 1950s marked the high point of Soviet success at such international ski competitions, yet even as the women continued to dominate their events throughout the subsequent two decades, the men's teams foundered. In the male-dominated Cold War environment pride of place went to the men's competitions, especially the 30- and 50-kilometer races and the 4 x 10-kilometer relay; therefore, the continued failure of the men's ski teams to win medals at international races was particularly vexatious to the official mythmakers of the USSR. However, biathlon in the 1960s offered a new venue for Cold War competition, certainly more male-oriented and militaristic than any previous ski event and arguably more so than any other contest on the Olympic card, summer or winter. In this alternative take on ski competition, the Soviet Union was the world's predominant force: from 1958 through 1977, the top five most successful international biathletes were Soviet; and out of the top twenty-five, fully half were from the USSR. Moreover, at a still-unparalleled six consecutive Olympics, the Soviet Union never lost the 4 x 7.5-kilometer biathlon relay. In order to delineate these broad topics, I employ a chronological and narrative approach with occasional forays into thematic discussions and biographical sketches. The first four chapters of this book provide the cultural and historical background for Soviet interest in ski racing after World War II. Chapter One introduces the reader to skiing in Russia prior to the Revolution of 1917. Beginning with archaeological evidence that points to Russia as the very source of the concept of skiing, this chapter surveys the sport's deep history across the northern reaches of the Eurasian landmass. The development of skiing was integral to people living in Scandinavian as well as Russian lands, and therefore connections between these two regions have existed for centuries. Many of these shared experiences and interests-warfare, polar exploration, winter sport-were crucial to the Russian and Soviet perception of skiing. I give an account in this chapter of\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nFridtjof Nansen's impact both in Russia and abroad. Especially important is Nansen's own opinion that skiing spread from somewhere deep within Russian territory to the rest of the world. This notion fostered the belief in Russia that the sport embodied nationalist traits integral to the Russian character. Chapter Two discusses the relationship of skiing to cavalry up to and including World War I and its development as an augmentation to military operations during the Russian Civil War. The limited effectiveness of cavalry in winter-as experienced by both sides during the FrancoPrussian War of 1870-1871-indicated that perhaps skis could substitute for horses when snow covered the ground. Belligerents on all sides of the Russian Civil War put this theory into practice as squadrons of ski troops ranged across the vast wintry expanse of Siberia. But it was Lev Trotsky who exploited the intersection of Marxist ideology and the widening gap between Alpine and Nordic branches of ski sport-the one associated with the moneyed leisure class, the other with the proletariat-as a means for excising bourgeois elements from the ranks of the Bolshevik Red Cavalry. This chapter also discusses the role of the Soviet hero whose antecedents stemmed from Bolshevik experiences during and immediately after the Civil War. One of these heroes, Toivo Antikainen, engaged in a long-distance ski trek to attack anti-communist forces during the Karelian Uprising of 1922. The Soviet regime referenced his derring -do and expertise as a skier during World War II and its aftermath. In addition, I analyze several types of races with important socialist connotations appropriated and developed by the Soviets: long-distance, or \"marathon'' skiing; converging races; relay races; and military patrol competitions. With an eye toward future conflicts undertaken in winter conditions, the Bolsheviks and then the Soviets incorporated these events into the athletic fabric of socialist fizkul'tura (physical culture). Chapter Three analyzes skiing during Stalin's reign prior to the Winter War of 1939-1940. Of particular importance was the regime's conflation of the Stakhanovite labor movement with long-distance, multi-day ski trekking. Ski teams traversing extraordinary distances at a tremendous pace in Siberia's inhospitable climate combined a number of Soviet tropes into socialist-realist set-pieces: collectivism, concern for national defense, and sport in service to the state. Just as crucial to the Soviet Union between the wars were two programs that developed side by side during the 1930s. The first was Gotov k trudu i oborone (GTO), the Ready for Labor and Defense program of mass sport instruction. Among the ten mandatory\n\nB\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\ntest categories were cross-country skiing (or its equivalent in regions far from snow) and rifle marksmanship. The second was the Single All-Union Sports Classification System, whose intention was to motivate the best athletes to reach set standards for their particular sport. Both were designed to promote the simultaneous goals of mass participation and mastery. This chapter also considers how the development of sport in the Soviet Union paralleled that in the fascist states and the odd mix of nations on either end of the ideological spectrum participating in international ski racing prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. Chapter Four concerns the period encompassed by World War II. The purpose of this chapter is not to recount troop movements and battle plans but, rather, to analyze the transformation of the Soviet skier into an icon of national defense just before the Great Patriotic War and during the counteroffensive against Nazi Germany in the winter of 1941-1942. In response to the success of Finnish ski troops in thwarting the Red Army during the Winter War, the Soviet Union instituted a massive ski mobilization effort that flourished between October 1940 and winter maneuvers during Operation Barbarossa the following year. This campaign to put the Soviet citizenry on skis occupied the concerted efforts of the military, the government, the educational system, industry, Communist Party organizations and the press, in conjunction with the endeavors of journalists, poets, musicians, writers, artists, filmmakers and athletes. The cumulative results had an enormous effect on the Soviet military and the development of winter sports in the Cold War era. Chapter Five covers the immediate post-war years up to 1958, an era during which the Cold War blossomed as the Soviet Union returned to international sport competition. The Great Patriotic War decimated the USSR, and in the aftermath, ritual representations of the country's sacrifice to defeat Nazi Germany became part of the fabric of post-war Soviet life. Skiing evolved into an all-encompassing metaphor, combining patriotism with communist ideology and historical significance that harked back to the Civil War. New to the mix was the association with the suffering and endurance of the battle-hardened Soviet population during the Second World War. The stature of skiing and, in particular, cross-country racing grew as the Soviet Union adopted the sport to portray itself both domestically and internationally. The advent of biathlon in the late 1950s provided an alternative-and very Soviet-type of sport that manifested many of the important elements of this portrayal. At the end of this chapter, I detail the creation of modern biathlon and its initial development in\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nthe Soviet Union, tracing the early careers of three important figures from the first generation of world-class Soviet athletes: Dmitrii Sokolov, Valentin Pshenitsyn and Vladimir Melanin. The next two chapters cover the period between the Second World Biathlon Championship in Courmayeur, Italy, in 19 59 and the Seventh BiathIon World Championships at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, in 1966. During this era, biathlon grew considerably-at Garmisch-Partenkirchen there were two world championship events contested for the very first time-and the skiers of the Soviet Union established themselves as the world's preeminent practitioners of the sport. Chapter Six introduces another influential Soviet biathlete, Aleksandr Privalov, destined to have a decades-long career as a major mover in the biathlon program of the Soviet Union. It also elaborates upon the conflation of the Cold War and sport, particularly at the Squaw Valley Olympic Games of 1960 and the 1962 World Ski Championships held in Chamonix, France, and Zakopane, Poland. The political turmoil that ensued at these two events foreshadowed the tone, tenor and direction of world championship and Olympic events for decades to come. In addition, experiences at these competitions were instrumental in the development of the Soviet ski and biathlon programs and their export to other Eastern Bloc nations. Integral to this growth behind the Iron Curtain was the significance of cross-country ski racing as a spectator sport, especially in the Soviet Union. Chapter Seven follows the first generation of Soviet biathletes through a triumphant show of force at the 1964 Innsbruck Winter Olympics and a subsequent decline by the following year as changes to the rules of the sport favored faster and younger skiers. This chapter opens with a brief biography of Finland's Veikko Hakulinen, one of the most successful international cross-country ski racers of his era. He was known as \"the great friend of Soviet skiers\" in the USSR, even though his mediocre attempts at biathlon overshadowed those of Russia's Melanin and Privalov in the world press. I also include an interesting aside linking two of the Soviet Union's most successful high-profile endeavors-cross-country ski racing and space exploration. Chapter Eight focuses on Aleksandr Tikhonov, one of the Soviet Union's greatest athletes. Between 1967 and 1980, Tikhonov reigned supreme in biathlon, accumulating eleven gold, five silver and two bronze medals at ten world championships and one silver and four gold medals at four Olympics. He also won the championship of the Soviet Union in biathlon nineteen times. With a larger-than-life personality, Tikhonov altered the\n\n10\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nworld's perception of biathlon during the zenith of the USSR's domination of the sport. Based on the voluminous body of books and newspaper and magazine articles about Tikhonov, as well as interviews with former competitors who knew him well, I propose that Tikhonov was a high-ranking KGB agent who nonetheless garnered admiration on both sides of the Iron Curtain and extended goodwill and fellowship to the West-when it suited him-in this highly charged sport. Chapter Nine discusses the significance of the 1974 World Biathlon Championships, which took place in Minsk, the first time that an international ski event of this magnitude had ever been held on Soviet soil. Biathletes from Finland led by Juhani Suutarinen spoiled what had been predicted as a Soviet tour de force featuring Aleksandr Tikhonov. Nevertheless, a rabid, partisan crowd whose numbers dwarfed those of any previous athletic event in the USSR helped the Soviet relay team achieve victory on the final day. I discuss the significance of sport as spectacle in addition to the revolutionary changes afoot in ski racing during this watershed year: synthetic skis; the rise of athletes from East Germany; modernized biathlon facilities; and the enormous crowds drawn to the excitement of biathlon as it evolved, incorporating breakable targets from the relay into a new 10-kilometer biathlon sprint format. Chapter Ten details the controversy over drugs and blood doping in cross-country skiing that roiled the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. This international incident centered on the skiers of the Soviet Union and instigated the development of much stricter controls and testing for illegal substances and procedures that has become the hallmark of international competitions during the early decades of the twenty-first century. As background to this debacle, I discuss the development of the East German sports program, which outpaced that of the Soviet Union by the end of the 1970s. This section includes an analysis of the evolution of steroids, blood doping and erythropoietin (EPO), as well as the rise of commercialism fostered by the Olympics during the 1980s.\n\nNote on Sources Understanding the significance of skiing in Russia and how biathlon developed in the Soviet Union requires a grasp of cultural, social and historical trends spanning more than a century. As an introduction to these topics, my book is by necessity a vast survey. Certainly a trove of\n\nIntroduction\n\nII\n\nrich archival data awaits future historians interested in augmentingand correcting-what I have written; however, I did not consider such detailed sources critical to my thesis. Rather, I have chosen to rely on the abundant newspapers, journals, books and pamphlets produced for the voracious reading public in Russia. In addition to mainstream publications such as Ogonek, Pravda, Izvestiia and Trud, I have found those of the Red Army, especially K novoi armii, Krasnyi sport and Krasnaia zvezda especially useful. In the case of sport, newspapers and magazines are compelling because they reflect discourse that intersects the interests of the reading public and the agenda of the regime. The articles in Red Army publications are crucial to the study of skiing in Russia because from the very inception of the socialist experiment, physical development and athletics were combined with military training-and crosscountry skiing was the premier example of a sport with significance to the Armed Forces. Up until the 1950s, sport in general, and ski racing in particular, was ofless interest to the organs of the Communist Party. The Red Army press-whose readership numbered in the millions-provided the most extensive coverage of skiing until the regime decided that sport had political as well as military importance internationally. The subsequent iteration of the Red Army's Krasnyi sport was Sovetskii sport, published from 1946 on. It was an extremely popular daily publication with circulation reaching over five million by the 1980s. It featured matter-of-fact reporting on athletic events and as a result earned a unique reputation for honesty and journalistic professionalism. In this regard, Sovetskii sport was the closest facsimile to Western sport journalism behind the Iron Curtain. 6 Historical analysis depends upon primary sources, which are always subject to inherent biases and presumptions grounded in the agenda and experience of the various authors. This situation is magnified in the case of the Soviet Union because the government controlled publication, regulating how published material should reflect socialist norms and to whom a public voice should be allowed. Throughout this book I provide points of view expressed not only by individuals in the Eastern Bloc but also by those in the West and I caution the reader to consider all of them with a critical eye. I have attempted to throw in a cautionary word or two when quoting from Soviet sources, although I do allow the discourse to proceed unfiltered by my comments at times; stating the obvious-for example, the Soviet propensity toward exaggeration for propaganda purposes-becomes tedious reading after awhile. However, simply because\n\n12\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nan author or interviewee happened to be Soviet does not necessarily mean that he or she distorted the truth; nor does it necessarily follow that his or her counterpart in the West provided a more trustworthy account. Hopefully, the historical and political sketches I have included in each chapter will provide context for evaluating the reliability of each on a case-by-case basis. Translations of source materials are mine, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\nL E S S T H A N A YEA R 8 E F 0 R E the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd, Vladimir Lenin offered this revolutionary advice to his mistress and fellow conspirator, the French socialist-feminist Inessa Armand: \"Do you ski? Do it without fail! Learn how and set off for the mountains-you must. In the mountains winter is wonderful! It's sheer delight, and it smells like Russia:' 1 It is no surprise that Lenin was enthusiastic about skiing. His short life span of fifty-four years coincided with that of Norwegian scientist and explorer Fridtjof Nansen, widely acknowledged for introducing modern skiing to the world. Lenin, who was born in 1870, was a teenager when Nansen completed his groundbreaking ski traverse of Greenland in 1888, and a young man when the Norwegian adventurer returned from the Arctic after an epic three-year exploratory voyage in 1896. Even Russia's iconic revolutionary was not immune to \"Nansen-mania;' a pan-European enthusiasm that swept the continent at the turn of the century and remained well into the inter-war period. That the architect of the Soviet project fused skiing with the essence of his homeland suggests the importance of this new sport to Russia during the nationalistic frenzy of late nineteenth-century Europe. His words foreshadow as well how Soviets would transform a sport that had essentially been a peasant pastime prior to Nansen's landmark trek into an embodiment of the national character, finding in skiing an anti-bourgeois mixture of militarism, Arctic heroism, scientific inquiry and socialist ideology. Skiing developed as a modern sport between 1789 and 1914, a period Eric Hobsbawm has termed \"the long nineteenth century:' Historian Norman Davies defines this epoch in terms of power: technical, economic, cultural and intercontinental. 2 To gain control of these power matrices, European nations engaged in intense rivalries aggravated by diplomatic maneuvering, military development and colonial competition from the\n\n14\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nmid-1800s to the outbreak of World War I. Just as critical was the power of ideology, whose manifestations helped shape nineteenth-century Europe's geopolitical landscape. Arguably the most virulent and potent of these doctrines was nationalism, a term used to convey the idea that the optimal social system is one that divides people into nationalities having cultural and political autonomy or, preferably, independence. 3 From the very first stirrings of the romantic movement at the threshold of the nineteenth century to Franz Ferdinand's assassination at the hands of a Serbian nationalist in 1914, nationalism swept over Europe as activists strove to inculcate varying degrees of national consciousness among diverse groups across the continent. Language and culture, not citizenship in a particular state, became the determining factors of an individual's nationality. 4 In order to establish the legitimacy of a particular nationality, nationalist intellectuals scoured history to furnish proof of a nation's separate and unique identity. Prehistoric artifacts and medieval sources were given especial credence because they established long -standing claims to nationhood. Peasant folklore was also highly valued as a living connection that joined the modern nation with its most ancient cultural roots. Interest in philology, medieval history, national literature and ethnology blossomed in the nineteenth century as ardent nationalists ransacked these sources for the glorification of their own people's achievements and cultural superiority. Wagnerian opera and the collected fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm in the German states, Serbo-Croatian studies in the Balkans and the Kalevala in Finland are just a few examples of this trend: for Norwegians, skiing was the primary cultural signifier conflating peasant roots joined to a mythical past with connotations of nationhood.\n\nSkiing: An Ancient Solution to Winter's Problems In regions close to the Arctic Circle or located at high elevation, skiing was often a tool of survival for people with no other means of winter transportation. Attempts to pinpoint the precise location where skiing began have inspired fierce and competing claims: a blatantly nationalist point of view has infused the study of early ski artifacts, especially among the ethnological scientists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although intensive lobbying by Sweden and especially Norway in the twentieth century has conveyed the notion that skiing began in Scandinavia, Russia certainly could make a similar claim. Suffice it to say that sporadic\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\nIS\n\narchaeological finds indicate that skiing developed all across the northern reaches of the Eurasian landmass. The most compelling argument locates the source of skiing in the Altai region, from which the concept of a long plank used for snow travel spread to the north and west via the indigenous tribes of Siberia. 5 The archaeological record, whether tracing this movement or perhaps memorializing the development of skiing in unrelated pockets, points to a prehistoric response to the exigencies of winter survival. At a site 1,300 miles east of the Urals, a pictograph known as Sunduk IV depicts two skiers armed with bows, broadly dated to a period between the third century B.C.E. and the fourth century C.E. This location is only 400 miles from the Altai Mountains, a fact that fires the imaginations of proponents of the Altai source theory. Bolstering this notion are several recent discoveries by Chinese researchers in the Altai region of Paleolithic rock paintings, pictographs and petroglyphs that appear to represent skiers or snowshoers. Other early evidence from areas far removed from Altai includes Neolithic cave art discovered at Zalavruga near the White Sea as well as an Abashevo Bronze Age shard unearthed near Voronezh, both of which illustrate hunters on skis; and a dagger discovered in excavations near Omsk with a blade engraved with a small portrayal of a skier. More intriguing than these images are the remnants of actual skis preserved in bogs that have been discovered in locations from Sweden to Mongolia. There are around 250 extant examples of such skis, which have been carbon-dated and analyzed for pollen and dendrochronological evidence. By these reckonings, a partial ski extracted from bogs north of Syktyvkar at the Vis excavations is more than eight thousand years old, perhaps the oldest in the world. 6 Through the natural evolution of territorial defense in high latitudes, northern nations fostered the practice of skiing for military purposes. The first documented reference to combat carried out on skis dates from the end of the twelfth century. In his Gesta Danorum, the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus describes ferocious tribes armed with bow and arrow and spears inhabiting regions near the Arctic Circle and travelling by ski. Grammaticus notes that the formidable forces of Danish king Ragnar Lodbrok nearly perished at the hands of fierce skiing Finns in the kingdom of Permland or Finnmark. Other sources indicate that on 6 March 1200, Norwegian king Sverre Sigurdsson fielded a company of ski troops equipped with bows and arrows at the Battle of Oslo. 7 Anecdotal evidence gleaned from the chronicles suggests that early Russian rulers were just as keen to use skis as an efficient means of transport\n\n16\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nin support of the state. The earliest written record of skiing in Russia is a twelfth-century message from an ecclesiastical official, Metropolitan Nikifor, to Vladimir Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus: In 1444, when the roads from Moscow to Riazan were choked with snowdrifts, Grand Duke Vasilii II (the Blind) organized a ski raid to drive Mustafa, tsarevich of the Golden Horde, out of the region. Vasilii's son, the Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan III (the Great), equipped ski units under the command of Fedor Kurbskii with orders to wrest the regions of northwest Siberia between the Urals and the River Ob from the Tatars in 1479. His son, Prince Semen Fedorovich Kurbskii, led ski troops during the conquest of the Southern Lands in 1499. Similarly, in 1535 boyars of the Shuiskii family, acting as regents for Ivan IV, sent soldiers equipped with skis into Latvia. 8 Descriptions of skiing in early modern Russia began to filter westward during the sixteenth century. Two sources familiar to historians of early modern Europe are the works of Freiherr Sigismund von Herberstein and Alexander Gwagnin, composed for Western European audiences during the mid-1500s. Herberstein, emissary to Moscow on behalf of the Holy Roman Empire, offered readers a glimpse of a strange steppe culture beyond Poland's borders, accompanied by a surreal illustration of skiers by Hans Sebald Lautensack, in his 1557 edition of Commentaries on Muscovite Matters. 9 The 1578 Description of all Muscovite Regions by the Polish chronicler Gwagnin used prose similar to Herberstein's to provide details of Loppia, the northernmost part of the Muscovite state. 10 Both authors adapted derivatives of an ancient Russian word, rta, to augment descriptive terminology for skis lacking in Latin and other Western European languages; thus Herberstein's auf Artachn and Gwagnin's compressed narta, the latter having entered Polish as \"ski\" and Russian as \"sled:' 11 In subsequent centuries, the militarization of skiing in Western Europe increased dramatically, due in no small part to the efforts of King Gustav Vasa (1496-1560). Vasa's organizational skills led to the liberation of Sweden from the Union of Kalmar and transformed the country into a European power. He formed the first military units in Scandinavia in 1555, boasting in a letter that his mobile troops could ski 185 kilometers in a single day. Both Sweden and Russia had been vying for hegemony in the north since the Middle Ages as their armies ranged back and forth across the traditional territory of Finland. One of Vasa's forces, comprised of five hundred Swedish and Finnish skiers, defeated a far superior Russian army of five thousand on the Karelian Isthmus at Joutselka in 1555. During the Northern Seven Years' War of 1563-1570, Sweden employed Finnish ski\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n17\n\ntroops under the command of Claes Fleming to invade the province of Ingria, where St. Petersburg stands today. As the Russians swept back across the Karelian Isthmus in 1590, a detachment of six hundred Finnish farmers on skis thwarted a potential invasion. During the Time of Troubles, a period separating the death of the last tsar of the Riurik Dynasty in 1598 from the ascension of the first Romanov in 1613, Russian commander Mikhail Skopin-Shuiskii brought five divisions of skiers to Moscow. There, they took the field against the cavalry of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at the siege of Troitse-Sergieva Lavra, one of the watershed events of the Polish-Muscovite War of 1605-1618_12 The seventeenth century was a pivotal period in the expansion of the Russian Empire into Siberia, culminating with the establishment of a permanent Pacific port at Okhotsk in 1649. The legendary Cossack leader Ermak Timofeevich led the first Russian expeditionary forces deep into Siberia in the late sixteenth century, deploying skiers against Kuchum Khan of Sibir. Of the numerous service-class people and entrepreneurial contract workers who came after Ermak to explore the region's vast tracts, many used skis in their journeys, most significantly Semen Dezhnev, during his travels from the Kolyma River on the Arctic Ocean to the Anadyr River on the Pacific in 1648, and Erofei Pavlovich Khabarov, in his trek on the Amur from 1649 to 1653. Following in their footsteps during the late eighteenth century were a number of explorers, including Gavriil Sarychev, who collaborated with English Royal Navy officer Joseph Billings to search for the Northwest Passage. Under the patronage of Tsarina Catherine II (also known as Catherine the Great), the Billings-Sarychev Expedition mapped eastern Siberia, the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Sarychev may have been the first person to ski in North America, although his attempt was inauspicious: \"From our inexperience in this mode of travelling, we often sprained our [ankles], got entangled in shrubs, or fell into heaps of snow:' 13 The trend toward incorporating skis into the military continued with the advent of firearms during the modern period. Ski divisions armed with rifles played an important role during and after the Great Northern War of 1700-1721, a fact not lost on Russia's tsar, Peter I (the Great). As part of the reorganization of the Russian army, Peter incorporated special reconnaissance units trained in ski travel, known as Okhotniki, or Hunters, consisting of four specially selected men from each company of a regiment. To one Swedish observer, the Okhotniki were part of an army with \"no order in waging war:' He mentions especially that the infantry was \"used in a very undisciplined fashion [including] those that run over the snow on\n\n18\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\n[skis]:· It is interesting to note that the first organized ski races took place around this time among guards on the Swedish border in 1767. These soldiers were, in essence, the forerunners of modern winter biathletes, because each race participant carried a rifle and shot at targets. 14 Catherine II continued the nurturing of ski specialists in her armies. During the Pugachev Rebellion of 1774, ski troops in the army of Commander Ivan Mikhel'son battled similarly equipped rebel protagonists in the vicinity of Perevolotskoe and Chesnokovka at the base of the Urals. Colonel Aleksandr Bibikov, a veteran of the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763 who would die of cholera in the spring of 1774, dispatched his chasseurs on skis there to secure \"all the advantageous highpoints:' 15 Twenty-five years later, Field Marshal Aleksandr Suvorov employed skiers to keep his army supplied with materiel while traversing the Alps to attack Napoleon in Italy. Like Bibikov, Suvorov was a veteran of the Seven Years' War, having cut his teeth in the tsar's army as a teenaged private in Finland, a region where skiers had easily outdistanced their foe on foot. Over this same terrain and as part of the same Napoleonic conflict, Sweden and Russia again maneuvered ski troops against one another during the course of the Finnish War of 1808-1809. The commander-in-chief of the tsar's imperial army, Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoevden, incorporated skiers as advanced guards and as skirmishers on the flanks of massed cavalry during Russia's battle to wrest territory from Sweden and establish the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. A particularly harsh April witnessed two battles during which skiers helped carry the day. On the sixteenth of that month, General lakov Kul'nev used quick-moving ski-skirmishers to rout the Swedish army at the Battle of Pyhajoki while enduring temperatures of thirty below zero Celsius. The Swedes returned the favor eleven days later at the Battle of Revolax. A Swedish detachment of 150 skiers attacked the advance guard of Major General Mikhail Bulatov at three o'clock in the morning, forcing the retreat of the Russian forces and the capture of five officers, 450 troops and Bulatov himself. Sweden's Count Johan August Sandels kept the pressure on, sending ski troops to attack the rear and right flank of General Obukhov in early May near Pulkkila. 16 With the Treaty of Paris in 1814, skiing gradually fell out of use in the military. By 1826, ski troops were no longer a part of the army in either Sweden or Norway. However, patriotic bands of Norwegians organized in 1831 and launched a campaign to revive the sport as a means of na-\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n19\n\ntional self-defense. These efforts led to a revitalization of ski exercises in the Norwegian army to such an extent that, in 1863, Lieutenant-Colonel Oscar Wergeland published a modern ski drill manual followed a year later by a history and treatise on the use of military skiing. New developments in technique and equipment during the 1860s revived skiing in towns throughout Norway and provided the groundwork for a national sports identity known as idraet. This point of view evolved in reaction to foreign influences in international sports. Especially loathsome to Norwegians were the purported negative effects of the \"sport-for-sport'ssake\" attitude of members of the British upper class, who considered sport the domain of amateurs or simply a pleasant pastime. The Norwegian idea of sport as idraet, on the other hand, was much more serious and practical because it incorporated the concept of service to homeland defense through the development of better soldiers and the improvement of public health. 17 As the Norwegian revival of skiing spread to other parts of Europe, the imperial Russian army was among the first to initiate concentrated training of ski troops as early as 1886. The army put special focus on the Vyborg Infantry and the Vilmanstrand 86th Regiments of the Karelian region near St. Petersburg, and the 40th Division and the Finnish Sharpshooters' Battalions. Extended ski tours, winter war games and scouting parties comprised the regimen for these soldiers. For example, in the winter of 1890-1891, a Lieutenant Wallenius covered 860 kilometers while leading a group from the Kuopio Battalion through Karelia over a period of twenty-nine days. In 1891, Okhotniki from twenty infantry divisions in the military district of Kazan carried out a ski excursion covering some 700 kilometers in ten days. War games held in the St. Petersburg military district during the winter of 1892-1893 proved that mounted troops and artillery divisions were easily outmaneuvered by ski detachments, resulting in mandatory ski training for the entire army, including the elite cavalry.18 This led to the publication in 1893 of the Circular of the General Staff No. 193, which stated: \"It is necessary to turn special attention to exercises in the use of skis extending its pursuit not only among the Okhotniki but as much as possible also among the other lower ranks of the unif' 19 By 1894, the success of the Russian army's integration of skiing into modern military operations was reflected as well in Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the adaptation of ski exercises and winter war games into the regimen of each nation's troops.\n\n20\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nPolar Exploration and the Great Game The European fascination with polar exploration coincided with this revitalization of skiing in the military during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. It proved to be a unique conflation of sport with militant notions of nationalism, heroism and bravery against the forces of nature, turning expeditions into arenas of relentless competition. On the world stage, national prestige hinged on the attainment of these last unknown places and imbued theoretical points on a map with something much more significant than simply another geographical discovery. The nationalism inherent in polar exploration, infused as it was with militaristic overtones, had a profound effect on the development of skiing in Russia at the turn of the century. Great Britain was preeminent among those nations exploring high latitudes during the nineteenth century. The Royal Admiralty's decision to support polar exploration by the Royal Navy after Waterloo kindled national interest in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. By the latter half of the century, the Royal Navy took charge of all high-latitude exploration, resulting in expeditions that were increasingly expensive, bound by unwieldy rules and regulations and remarkably devoid of cold-weather savvy. Few other countries could afford to mount such cumbersome campaigns, especially the financially strapped Russian Empire. Enter Norway-to astonish the world with its school of polar exploration that would supplant Great Britain and dominate the field from 1888 through 1911. The heart of the Norwegian approach was the application of skis in conjunction with dogsleds to polar travel, a result of skiing's development as a modern sport in Norway. This method stood in marked contrast to the Royal Navy's predilection for \"No ski, no dogs;' which doomed British expeditions to hard slogging on foot and the man-hauling of sledges, with sometimes fatal consequences. Fridtjof Nansen's ski traverse of Greenland in 1888 propelled Europe into a frenzy of \"Nansen mania;' which only intensified with his return in 1896 from a three-year attempt to reach the North Pole by ski. His exploits single-handedly brought skiing to the attention of the outside world and launched it as a universal sport. 20 Nansen was very much a product of the Norwegian ski revival of the mid-nineteenth century. Born in 1861, he grew up skiing and as a young man established his reputation in his native country as a pioneering mountain skier. An accomplished ski racer, Nansen expanded the parameters of his sport by completing two traverses across the Hardangervidda\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n21\n\nfrom Bergen to Christiania in 1882 and 1884 while a doctoral student of marine biology. The ability to synthesize nationalism and scientific inquiry with an athletic point of view enabled him to push the limits of skiing by undertaking the first crossing of Greenland in 1888. From 20 August to 21 September of that year, Nansen and a small band of self-sufficient skiers applied his ski touring experience to a polar environment and, in the process, revolutionized high-latitude exploration. When news of his accomplishment reached Norway, his countrymen were ecstatic. A front-page article in the Christiania newspaper Morgenbladet lauded Nansen for initiating a \"sportsman's method\" in polar exploration that had the potential for propelling Norway into the lead in the race to the North Pole, noting that the success of such an expedition would hinge on a select, small group of men inured to the difficulties of travelling over ice and snow on skis. 21 In London, the Times praised him as well and marveled that \"such an expedition could succeed only if undertaken by experienced ski-men:' 22 Nansen's ski traverse of Greenland marked the end of the era for large, expensive and ponderous expeditions that had been the style in the past; and his book On Ski over Greenland, a two-volume memoir of his exploits, was the stimulus that popularized skiing in Europe and made this new sport synonymous with bravery, adventure and excitement. Nansen's remarkable tales proved the catalyst in Russia as well for renewed interest in skiing during the late nineteenth century. The notion that a small group of Norwegians using a mode of transportation with deep nationalist roots had stolen the march on Great Britain, the preeminent imperialist power of the era, was especially appealing to Russians. Defeated in the Crimean War and challenged on the sea by its nemesis, the Russian Empire had shrunk following the sale of Alaska to the United States and the abandonment of its colonies in California and Hawaii by the time of Nansen's journey. Compounding these circumstances was the steady encroachment upon areas contiguous to Russia's northern border by British polar exploration, American whaling and Norwegian fishing and sealing-activities that played the role of war among maritime nations both great and small. All of these developments were regarded as direct threats by a tsarist government preoccupied not only with the security of its borders but also with the rest of the world's perception of Russian imperial might. As a result of Russia's war with Japan in 1904-1905, claim to the Arctic reaches, especially the area between Novaia Zemlia and Novosibirskie Ostrova, gained increasing strategic value as the Imperial Navy sought shorter transittime to the Far East via the Northeast Passage. 23\n\ni!i!\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nIn addition, the Great Game, a determined rivalry to gain hegemony in Central Asia, kept Britain and Russia on the brink of war throughout the latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Together with the North and South Poles, the territories surrounding Central Asia's 8,000-meter peaks represented the last unmapped and therefore unclaimed regions on earth during the nineteenth century. The contemporary notion that these summits, especially Mt. Everest, constituted the earth's \"third pole\" fostered interest among adventurers striving to claim the last vestiges of unexplored territory in the heights of altitude as well as latitude. British military prognosticators, always on the alert to gain an advantage in the Great Game and aware that Russian soldiers had been training in earnest for ski maneuvers since the mid-1880s, suggested that their troops stationed in the Pamirs should have ski training in anticipation of Russian antagonists who \"would not fail to take advantage of this latest innovation in the art of war:' 24 The Russian press followed the development of skiing in Scandinavia even before Nansen's Greenland expedition focused global attention on the sport. An early correspondent for St. Petersburg's weekly magazine Niva covered a ski competition outside Christiania (probably in Grorud) in 1871. The accompanying illustration shows skiers en masse descending a formidable slope, although the race was probably a combination event that tested a competitor's overall abilities on flat terrain, uphill, downhill and over jumps and obstacles. 25 In 1883, the magazine reported on another Christiania event, following with a late-December article detailing explorer Adolf Erik Nordenski0ld's plans to sponsor a long-distance ski race in northern Sweden. More than just a competition for prizes, Nordenski0ld intended that this event, held in April1884, should demonstrate the application of skiing to polar exploration. 26 Niva also featured stories about Nansen prior to his departure for Greenland in 1888. However, it was Nansen's On Ski Over Greenland, in which he articulated the key role of Russia and Siberia in the history of skiing (indeed as the very font of the concept of skis as transportation), that enthralled the nation's reading public and altered the perception of the sport in Russia. 27 Nansen perhaps based his theory about the Siberian source of skiing on a plethora of books written during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 28 A number of authors described indigenous tribes in Siberia who traditionally used skis for hunting and winter conveyance. Among the earliest was Stepan Krasheninnikov, who set off to explore Kamchatka and environs in 1737. In his 1755 compilation, Descriptions of the Land\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n23\n\nof Kamchatka, Krasheninnikov differentiates between two types of skis (lyzhi) used by the Kamchedal (or ltelmen). Lyzhi of the first type were made from fir wood and \"similar to commonplace skis\" with a length of around 1.5 meters and between twenty-two and twenty-seven centimeters in width. 29 Krasheninnikov calls the other type of ski lapki, or paws: however, his description further on in the book suggests that these were actually racquet -style snowshoes. 30 More accessible to northern European readers, perhaps, was Krasheninnikov's mentor Johann Georg Gmelin, a German botanist who published an account of his travels throughout Siberia, Journey through Siberia, 1733 to 1743, between 1751 and 1752. He describes the \"lichi [lyzhi]\" used by the Tungus (now Evenki) for winter travel.3 1 Following them was Peter Simon Pallas, a professor of natural history at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences who led specimen-collecting expeditions across the reaches of the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine the Great. His dispatches and reports were collected and published in 1776 as Journey through Various Provinces of the Russian Empire. Pallas mentions the use of skis by a number of indigenous tribes such as the \"Ostjak\" (Ostyak, now Khanty), the Koibales and the Samoyed (now Nenets). The author catalogs many words from the indigenous languages: the Nenets term for ski, for example, is notated as \"Lamboi:' In his account of the winter life of the Khanty, Pallas describes the \"Parga or Parka;' a long hooded garment that he drapes on a skier in one of his illustrations. 32 Interest in the exploration of Siberia intensified during the first half of the nineteenth century and those who went there produced reams of documents. One of these was Adolph Erman, a German physicist with a penchant for world travel. In his journeys across Asia, he encountered the \"luija'' of the Ostyak, as well as the skis of the Tungus in Siberia. 33 Russian explorer Baron Ferdinand Wrangel also took notice of the Tungus and their skis during one of his early voyages. 34 Alexander von Middendorff, a zoologist from the Baltic region of the Russian Empire, travelled extensively in eastern Siberia and published his findings in 1848 under the title Journey in the Farthest North and East of Siberia during the Years 1843 and 1844. He provides detailed descriptions of hunting and travel by the Tungus and the distinctive skis and poles they used. Of particular interest is the Tungus perception that European skis, perhaps similar to those used by von Middendorff himself in his travels, were \"useless and clumsy as well as constructed without thought\" in comparison to their own. The author concurs with this notion, declaring: \"The skis of the nomadic Siberian hunter are works of art:' Fearless on skis, a Tungus hunting along a\n\n24\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nridgeline would \"take off like a shot and fall to pieces in the abyss\" in pursuit of game during a \"lightning-fast\" downhill run (an early use of the term Schuss in relation to skiing). Von Middendorff provides a pen-andink illustration of a special ski pole fitted with a crook on one end used by the Tungus \"to seize hold of trees if the Schuss gets out ofhand:' 35 The skis of the Tungus were of interest to a number of other adventurers in the latter half of the nineteenth century as well, including Polish geographer Mikolaj Ambrozy Kubalski, Richard Bush of the Russian-American Telegraph Expedition, Russian geographer Mikhail Krivoshapkin and American Methodist minister Zachariah Atwell Mudge; while the skis of the Ostiak caught the attention of German ethnographer Otto Finsch. 36 Baltic Russian zoologist and ethnographer Leopold von Schrenck studied the winter peregrinations of the Gilyak (now Nivkh) along the Amur River estuary and published his findings in Journeys and Explorations in Amur Territory in 1858. He provides extensive detail on native skis and associated paraphernalia with illustrations and comparisons to examples of those made by other Siberian peoples, such as the Tungus, Oltscha, Goldi and Samagitn. Notable is Schrenck's description of the ingenious use of larch wood, reindeer and elk fur, sealskin and whalebone in the manufacture of the skis. 37 Finally, in 1876, Victor Meignan of France travelled from Paris to Beijing, publishing an account of his journey the following year. Meignan describes a Votiak with bow and arrow who travels over the snow on \"extremely long planks;' accompanied by an illustration. This same image appears in an 1885 English translation that altered the original French text, \"A Votiak in the forests of Great Russia;' to ''A Votiak with snow-shoes:' 38 Employing many of these sources, Nansen and a colleague developed for the first edition of his Greenland book a fold-out map that outlined the location of indigenous peoples all across Siberia. Similar to a flowchart, the map illustrated the spread of skis from deep within Russian territory to the rest of Europe. This ethnographical rendering was particularly influential in fostering the idea among Russian readers that skiing was \"for the most part a Russian sporf' 39 In addition, Russian authors were keen to emulate Nansen's portrayal of skiing as a national characteristic of Norway, suggesting that Russians should do the same. 40 Pondering the possibility of attaining the North Pole after his successful traverse of Greenland, Nansen proposed an even bolder expedition based on his novel theory on the movement of currents in the Arctic Ocean. By deliberately freezing a specially constructed ship into the pack ice and\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n25\n\ndrifting north over the course of two years, Nansen hoped to get close enough to 90° north latitude for making a quick foray to claim the prize. Nansen left on his voyage in the summer of 1893. Rather than man-hauling sledges as he had across the ice in Greenland, Nansen brought dogs and sleds, a recent innovation in polar travel. His practice on the ice near his ship led to the revolutionary discovery that the rate of travel for a fully laden sled pulled by dogs was the same as that of a cross-country skierY With this valuable insight, Nansen began his ski tour to the North Pole on 14 March 1895. However, after three weeks of extreme cold and broken pack ice that delayed progress, it became too difficult to continue. He and his companion Hjalmar Johansen turned south, skiing 750 miles in 147 days before over-wintering on the northern edge of Franz Josef Land archipelago in a low stone hut. Finally, on 17 June 1896, the two Norwegian ski adventurers encountered English polar explorer Frederick Jackson, who sailed them home to Norway and a tumultuous hero's welcome. 42 Interest in skiing mushroomed as a result of Nansen's miraculous return from the Arctic in 1896. From the point at which newspapers in Russia received the first telegrams from Vard0 and Christiania in August, the coverage was incessant, particularly in St. Petersburg. The journalists at Niva had already written a number of in-depth articles about Nansen's North Pole expedition as early as 1889, speculating in one piece from the spring of 1896 that the ski adventurer had perhaps encountered a landmass and was preparing \"a sportsman's dash for attaining the pole as fast as possible:'43 The daily Journal de St. PCtersbourg, published in French, reprinted dispatches to the newspaper I.:Independance Belge from Adrien de Gerlache, a Belgian officer organizing a South Pole expedition in Christiania, which chronicled the nationalist fervor afoot in Norway in the aftermath of Nansen's return. 44 Novae vremia featured Nanseniana of every variety in addition to regular daily updates on the great explorer, including lengthy essays, photographs, drawings, maps and even a reproduction of his autograph in its weekly supplement continuously from 22 August to 26 September. 45 Only ten days after his return to Norway, a Russian publishing house bought full-scale newspaper announcements offering to the reading public Nansen's biography complete with the latest details of the most recent expedition. 46 By early 1897, Nansen's In the Land of Ice and Night, the first in a series of biographies based on translations ofNansen's own writings, appeared, some of which went through third, fourth and, in some cases, fifth editions over the next decadeY Advertisements in anticipation of the publication of the first edition began in late December of\n\n26\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\n1896 and ran continually in the pages of Novae vremia through the end of April of the following year. 48 A rival volume, In the Darkness of Night and the Ice was available for readers just a few months later. 49 Nansen's grand tour of Russia in 1898 inspired a new round of adulation among the populace from the moment he stepped out of his railcar on 25 April to receive the Order of St. Stanislaus on the platform of St. Petersburg's train station. Novae vremia breathlessly followed Nansen's every move: a private tour of the Hermitage; a gold medal, the first of its kind awarded to a foreigner, from the Imperial Russian Geographical Society; an audience with Tsar Nicholas II; a performance of Aida at the Mariinsky Theater. On one particularly exhausting day, Nansen and his wife, Eva, toured the Alexander III Russian Museum, visited an assortment of shops, met with Arctic specialists at the Imperial Academy of Science and dined at the restaurant Donon. Moscow received Nansen with enthusiasm equal to St. Petersburg's, and his tour of the country cemented his reputation. 50 Just as in the rest of Europe, Nansen's fame as a polar explorer astonishingly lasted longer than a generation; but unique to Russia was the way in which his popularity bridged the ideological divide of 1917.\n\nThe Ski Clubs of Russia The Norwegian conceit of sport as idraet, popularized via Nansen's feats as the incorporation of service to homeland defense through the improvement of public health, found fertile ground in Russian ski clubs. The first ski clubs in Russia formed in the immediate years after publication of Nansen's Greenland book. Conventional wisdom asserts that the Moscow Club of Skiers, or MKL, organized in March 1895, was the first official ski club in Russia, although that distinction actually belongs to Frost of St. Petersburg, which celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1913. 51 Another St. Petersburg ski club formed in December 1897, the more familiar Polar Star, which played a very active role in the growth of skiing in the country. Members built a large ski station at Iukki on the outskirts of St. Petersburg and, in subsequent years, also constructed the first jump hill in Russia thereY Salutary ski opportunities abounded for the civilian populace in the form of sociable club outings and tours. Trip reports posted by the Moscow Club of Skiers in the daily newspaper Moskovskiia vedomosti often\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n27\n\nemphasized the wholesomeness, adventure and spiritual uplift, a form of idraet within a Russian context, found on a weekend outing: \"Yes, in this storm, in this battle with nature there is a hundred times greater peace than in the struggle and storm of everyday life. This battle doesn't oppress the soul nor does it contaminate it with pessimism: rather, it ennobles a person's soul, acquiring strength for the struggle with oneself' 53 Of course, not everyone portrayed skiing with such bombast. On several occasions St. Petersburg's weekly satirical magazine Satirikon poked fun at the ski crowd. A cartoon from 1912 shows two skiers, one pointing off into the distance and exclaiming to his rotund companion: \"Hey, partner! The lunchroom's nearby! Let's take off the skis because we need to hurry!\" Another from 1910 features a man and woman skiing along the flat terrain as one muses: \"I adore skiing! Especially if you could attach a seat to the back of the skis and harness horses to the front, yeah, and instead of these stupid poles-a good whip! That sport would be worth a king's ransom!!\" 54 As a natural extension of club activities, ski competitions gradually gained in popularity too. Many Russian ski historians state that the first ski race in Russia took place in St. Petersburg on 13 February 1894 over a 1/4 verst course, a distance of approximately 275 meters. 55 However, on 30 January of that year, three women and seven men had already competed in a ski race for prizes-a reindeer-skin outfit and a silver-knobbed ski staff-on the Gulf of Finland from Peterhof to Kronshtadt, a much more robust undertaking of fifteen kilometers. 56 This race pre-dates as well the 19 February 1895 first competitions organized by the Moscow Bicyclists' Club, one a 3-kilometer run through untracked snow, the other a !-kilometer contest over a laid-out course. 57 As the number of clubs grew toward the turn of the century, so did the desire for competition to determine the best skier from each organization, then in each city and eventually throughout the entire empire. By 1900, each infantry regiment and rifle battalion in St. Petersburg fielded large teams of skilled skiers. 58 Members of the regiments often joined in the competitions sponsored by ski clubs in St. Petersburg and Moscow, dazzling the citizen racers with their speed and technique. 59 In Moscow, the Organization of Ski Enthusiasts, or OLLS, broke away from the more stolid Moscow Club of Skiers (MKL) in the summer of 1901 to focus exclusively on ski racing, outraging conservative members of the club who preferred to promote benign ski-fellowship among the citizenry. Alarmed by the increased emphasis on competition among Moscow's skiers, MKL presidentS. N. Timofeev excoriated the new organization:\n\n28\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nThe main goal of [OLLS] is determining 'The All-Russia Championship,\" 'The Moscow Championship\" and so on. What totally high-flown names! Such a program ... hardly promotes the development of public sympathy for skiing and wouldn't attract many members with such measures ... the premiership in the development of healthy winter diversions for grownups and children belongs to the MKL as Moscow's first pioneer of skiing. 60 In the opinion of the MKL leadership, ski racing was appropriate \"not so much for the determination of the speed of the run but rather for demonstrating the sport of skiing itself'61 Particularly unacceptable was the emphasis on prizes and awards, a notion yoked to the odious vulgarity of contemporary tsarist anti-Semitism in the pages of Moskovskiia vedomosti: \"This group of skiers presented an interesting spectacle ... What a blend of faces, pedigrees and qualities! ... not a single Semitic type was found among the predominantly Slavic element with faces typical of Germans, Swedes and other nations, inspired not by thirst for profit but rather by striving for nature, for its eternal and perfect beauty. ''6 2 Despite the predilections of the Moscow Club of Skiers, enthusiasm for ski racing grew apace in the first years of the twentieth century, reaching a crescendo of activity in 1910. That year, ten ski clubs in Moscow assembled under the aegis of the Moscow League of Ski-Runners, or MLL, and organized eighteen inter-dub competitions. Soon to follow was the All-Russian Union of Skiers, or VSL, promoting inter-city competitions and a Russian \"national\" championship. Pavel Bychkov, a groundskeeper who worked in Sokol'niki Park, won this competition, which took place for the first time on 7 February 1910.63 As skiing gained in popularity, ski clubs proliferated in Moscow, which boasted fourteen separate organizations by 1912, as well as in St. Petersburg, Smolensk, Tula, Ekaterinburg, Arkhangelsk and lvanovo-Voznesensk. 64\n\nSki Entrepreneurs: \"A Wonderful Gift for Christmas!\" 65 Nansen's incredible exploits were a boon for the Russian ski trade. As a result of the interest in skiing generated by the traverse of Greenland in 1888, skis were readily available for purchase in the sporting-goods stores of Moscow and St. Petersburg in the early 1890s. These were limited to wide, short skis for hunting in the woods or long, narrow pointed skis. 66 However, in the wake of euphoria over Nansen's return from the Arctic in\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n29\n\n1896, ski specialty shops began to appear that featured skis and paraphernalia imported from Finland and Norway. 67 In St. Petersburg, Gal' and Company, B. Brenner, D. Dal'berg and E. K. Shteiner (\"telephone number 3629\") all vied for sales through their advertisements in the daily newspapers, maintaining a lively competition well into the 1900s. 68 In the years leading up to World War I, V. Ort offered skis through his specialized sporting-goods store in Kiev and, in Moscow, A. Leitner's new shop carried \"genuine Finnish skis:' 69 The most enterprising purveyor of skis in Russia, however, was Konstantin Komets, who maintained a shop in St. Petersburg at 17-19 Zhdanovskaia Street adjacent to Petrovskii Park from the mid-1890s to around 1913.7° He invented and patented various ski accouterments to sell in his store, the most famous of which were ski sails for tacking into the winds sweeping St. Petersburg during the winter months. Fascinated by Nansen's story of rigging tent floors on improvised masts above the sledges during his 1888 Greenland trek, Komets experimented with fabricating two crossed bamboo poles over which he stretched a bolt of canvas. Holding this contraption in his hands while standing on skis allowed him to capture the breeze and sail across the frozen ice on the Gulf of Finland. 71 Although Nansen had never ski-sailed as Komets envisioned it, the Russian entrepreneur was not shy about associating his invention, as well as the rest of his inventory, with the great Norwegian explorer: \"Something new! ... sailing skis for running on the surface of the snow just like Dr. Nansen! ... Received: Dr. Nansen's standard winter hats with folding earflaps and back cover ... New book about F. Nansen with lots of illustrations:' 72 Komets perennial best-seller was the \"Dr. Nansen hat\" with ear- and neckflaps, a constant feature of his advertising efforts well into the 1900s, in one instance fortuitously placed just at the end of an extensive four-page article about Nansen and his Arctic adventures that ran in an 1896 edition of the weekly magazine Niva. 73 Komets was a vociferous proponent of skiing. He authored several books and articles on technique, the first of which appeared in the pages of Niva in 1896. In his 1904 book Skiing and Ski Sailing, Komets opines: \"Skis give enormous scope for all manner of competition in dexterity, quickness of the run and desperate bravery. And this sport does not demand expenses particularly, just skis, one or two poles and snow, snow, snow:' 74 As part of his efforts to promote skiing, the indefatigable Komets instructed St. Petersburg residents in the sport. In 1899, he led ten skisailing outings from St. Petersburg to Kronshtadt and oversaw practice\n\n30\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nsessions in Petrovskii Park each Sunday. 75 He organized six ski-sailing trips for youngsters on the banks of the Niva under the auspices of the Lighthouse sport club during the winter of 1903-1904 as well as one for the Russian Organization of Tourists on the Gulf ofFinland. 76 In conjunction with the Bogatyr' ski club he conducted ski and ski-sailing excursions throughout the winter of 1904-1905 and put together a two-day tour of villages along the Finnish border in the spring. 77 Judging by the wares for sale in his shop as of 1904, the ski business in St. Petersburg was booming at the turn of the century: Komets was now importing jackets from Ireland, skis from Norway and Finland, and bamboo ski-sail poles from Japan; he had his own patented ski boots, ski sails and line of ski tools; his new book and ski guide were out; and he was offering Samoyed (Nenets) reindeer mittens and clothing for both men and women. 78 Of course, the 1904-1905 war with Japan was an opportunity for Komets and other merchants to sell cold weather gear to soldiers in the capital packing up to head east. \"What should an officer take on the trek to Manchuria?\" advertisers asked in the pages of the newspapers, suggesting any number of rubberized sleeping bags, folding cots and cold weather gear, all available on the streets of St. Petersburg that winter. 79 With the threat of a European war looming in 1912, the \"Sportsmen'' sporting goods store in St. Petersburg offered \"military-style skis which are used in foreign armies\" to the general population in addition to its more conventional stock of gymnastics, fencing, boxing, soccer and track paraphernalia. 80\n\nThe Sokol Movement in Russia The rapid growth of ski clubs in Russia corresponded to the high point from 1910-1911 of international solidarity in the Sokol movement, a Slavic youth and gymnastics organization founded in Prague during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Sokol played an important role in the development of Czech nationalism by disseminating a Czech nationalist mythology and version of history. As a result of the Austro- Prussian War of 1866, the Sokol emphasized military training and Slavic identity to distinguish it from the German Turnverein, its Western European prototype. Enthusiastically embraced by young people, both men and women, the Sokol movement had spread to Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia by the late 1800s. 81 However, the amalgamation of various Czech, Croat and Serbian groups under the aegis of the Federation of\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n31\n\nSlavic Sokols in 1908 was short-lived, illustrating the difficulty of forging unity out of the diverse Slavic world of Central and Eastern Europe. One of the Sokol's most influential aspects was its emphasis on coordinated group activity rather than on the individual, exemplified by mass gymnastic and sporting festivals, known as Slet. These events provided the model for similar gatherings in the early years of the Soviet Union as a worker's alternative to the bourgeois Olympic Games. Participation at the Prague Sokol Slet grew from 1,600 in 1882 to 21,790 in 1912 with thousands more joining in as spectators. 82 In 1907, over two hundred Russian guests attended, prompting renewed interest in the Sokol when they arrived back home. The following year, Russian delegates were so enthusiastic at the 1908 Neo-Slav Congress in Prague, they donned Sokol uniforms as one exclaimed: \"The Sokol is the medicine that Russia needs most!\" 83 Czech emigres founded a few Sokols in Russia during the 1870s, but these remained isolated because the tsarist regime was concerned about the nationalist political tendencies of the movement. Cognizant that Sokol ideology was anathema to empire, the Russian government banned the organization's further expansion. However, the Czech Sokol Union raised its profile by winning gymnastic medals at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, and Russian schools began requesting Czech trainers. By the early years of the twentieth century, Czech Slavism had acquired a new ideological direction under the guise of \"Neo-Slavism;' a plan for cultural cooperation through sports among smaller Slavic nations and Russia. The Sokol's fervent nationalism, fueled by the notion of Teutonic oppression of Slavic peoples, and its focus on physical fitness and military training were especially appealing to Russian teachers and military officers. 84 After the 1905 Revolution, the government lifted restrictions on clubs and associations, including the ban on the name Sokol. The movement spread rapidly, and in 1910 a central organizing agency, the Board for the Union of Russian Sokols, came into existence, holding its first congress in Moscow in 1911 followed by a second in Kiev in 1913 with delegates from thirty-two Sokol societies. In 1913, Russian membership in the Sokol Union stood at three thousand. By the outbreak of war in 1914, the Sokol movement in Russia had grown to forty clubs manned by two hundred Czech trainers. 85 Starting in November 1910, the Russian Sokol in Moscow was involved in the promotion of skiing through the auspices of its Russian Gymnastics Association in conjunction with the Organization of Ski Enthusiasts (OLLS) and a group of ski racers based in Moscow's Sokol'niki Park, known variously as Sokol'niki Club of Skiers or Sokol'niki Club of\n\n32\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nSki-Runners (SKL). 86 This group played a significant role the following year in the development of a particularly Russian take on cross-country skiing: long distance multi-day ski races, inspired as much by Nansen's endeavors as by the ski competitions held among the Okhotniki regiments of the tsar's army. This genre's watershed event took place in late December 1911, over a period of twelve days when four members of SKL skied 700 kilometers from Moscow to St. Petersburg. Their trek was the template for similar events over the course of three decades, transmuting into Stalinist agit-prop set-pieces throughout the 1930s and 40s. It is interesting to note that after 1917, SKL went through a number of iterations: it became Club of the October Revolution, or KOR, in 1926, and then emerged in 1935 as Spartak, paralleling the transformation, by 1928, of OLLS into the Central House of the Red Army, or TsDKA. These two clubs, both of which started as organizations for ski enthusiasts, evolved into the two most influential sport societies in the Soviet Union. 87 In St. Petersburg, the Sokol-affiliated Bogatyr' Gymnastics Institute fielded a ski section for participation in citywide competitions in January 1914. With a nod to romantic nationalist notions of medievalism, ancient culture and Slavic pride, this organization took its name from the Bogatyri, magical heroes out of a mythic past who served the princes of Kievan Rus: Bogatyr' Ski Club members competed in a ski meet in February 1914, sponsored by Polar Star, now one of the largest ski clubs in Russia. The winters prior to World War I saw an increase in Sokol involvement with skiing in various locations around Russia, such as Tomsk, Voronezh and Riazan. A photograph in the Petrograd sports magazine Gerkules documents a Sokol group enjoying perhaps one last winter outing before the Bolshevik Revolution and the end of the Sokol movement in the midst of the Russian Civil War. 88\n\nWomen's Skiing Contrary to the restrictive norms governing female sporting events during the turn of the century, Russian women found ample opportunity to ski, at least in the environs of Moscow and St. Petersburg. They could thank Norway, where women had been active as skiing became a modern sport during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The dichotomy separating skating from skiing as a winter activity suitable for women provided an avenue for female emancipation via sport. Whereas skating was \"ladylike;' performed within the urbanized and artificial confines of an ice rink,\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n33\n\nskiing represented unfettered freedom to roam wide-open spaces. This sense of adventure associated with breaking away from societal norms imbued the sport of skiing with an aura of late nineteenth -century bohemianism. 89 Norwegian women organized their first ski club in Trondheim in 1886, followed by the conversion of the first male-only club in Christiania three years later. Although they were not allowed to compete in the Holmenkollen ski festival in Christiania, Norwegian King Oscar organized a special race event for women there in 1881. Women did compete regularly in ski races in other parts of the country, especially in the Telemark region. Outside of Scandinavia before the turn of the century, however, women's participation in skiing, especially racing, was a rarity. 90 After FridtjofNansen's 1888 Greenland expedition, Russians sought to emulate the way in which Norwegians incorporated skiing into the fabric of Norway's national identity. Especially compelling was the example of Nansen's wife, Eva, who embraced the concept of idraet and became a proponent of skiing as a means of emancipating women. She was a pioneering skier who crossed the Hardangervidda with her husband in 1892. Rejecting corset, bustle and petticoat as too restrictive, Eva took to the ski trails in a pair of loose trousers covered with a long doublet and woolen skirt, a revolutionary outfit for the times. 91 Thus, an 1893 feature on winter sports in St. Petersburg's Novae vremia includes a rotogravure of a female skier dressed in sporting culottes, short jacket and jaunty hat, not dissimilar to widely distributed engravings and photographs of Eva Nansen on skis, either alone or with her husband. 92 Eva remained a popular subject in Russia, admiration for her reaching a crescendo during the Nansens' tour of St. Petersburg and Moscow in 1898. As Novae vremia chronicled every move the pair made during their week-long stay in St. Petersburg, the paper's noted science reporter Lazar' K. Popov (El'pe) described Eva as \"a brave sportswoman:' 93 The weekly magazine Niva, no less glowing in its praise, designated her \"an example of female- heroism:' 94 Ski clubs in pre-revolutionary Russia promoted special events for women that ranged from introductory walkabouts to ski races. In fact, three women participated in the earliest recorded ski race in St. Petersburg in 1894, only three years after the first officially sanctioned ski race for women took place in Norway. 95 The enterprising Konstantin Komets led ski excursions for members of the \"Organization for the protection of women's health\" in St. Petersburg's Petrovskii Park, the editors of Novae vremia noting that \"skiing to all appearances is extraordinarily pleasing to all women:' 96 The copious advertisements for sporting goods stores in\n\n34\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nRussia's daily newspapers and weekly magazines promoted women's skis and accouterments in their advertising. 97 Photographs of various ski club outings organized by St. Petersburg's Polar Star and Sokol Bogatyr' indicate that women often constituted close to one-half of all participants. 98\n\nSki Racing and Nordiska Spe/en Crucial to Russia's burgeoning interest in ski racing during the early twentieth century was fascination with the newly created Olympic Games and their winter counterpart, the Nordiska Spelen (Northern Games), both of which internationalized sport. A decade before Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee in 1894, the Norwegian Association for Promotion of Ski Sports had sponsored local and national ski competitions, culminating in the season's most important event held in the neighborhoods of Christiania. 99 After 1891, when the Christiania events moved to Holmenkollen, this Norwegian national festival began to attract foreigners, among them tourists and even correspondents from La Vie au Grand Air, I.:Illustration, Illustrierte Zeitung and The Illustrated London News. The event gained ever more interest from outside of Norway as skiing developed at the turn of the century. Soon, foreign skiers were allowed to compete, and the Holmenkollen became the most important ski event in Europe. 100 During this period, a certain sense of pan-Scandinavianism was developing in Norway, Finland and Sweden as a result of already well-established notions of European nationalism combined with the fin-de-siecle Gothic revival of the late romantic era. Finland had enjoyed a somewhat amicable arrangement with Russia since 1809 but now chafed under the rule of Tsar Nicholas II, a vociferous promoter of Russification policies throughout the empire. Norway was intent on dissolving its union with Sweden, a situation viewed with alarm in Stockholm. In order to keep Norway within a Swedish-dominated block and also to offer succor to the Finns, Viktor Balck, a Swedish army captain, organized in February 1901 a sport festival in Stockholm celebrating winter events, which he named Nordiska Spelen. Balck proposed that this festival should take place at four-year intervals, just like the Olympics but in odd years. The games were soon designated \"Olympic\" by the French and British press, a development not unwelcome to Baron de Coubertin: he and Balck joined forces on the International Olympic Committee as the two main power brokers of international sport into the 1920s. 101\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n35\n\nJust as news about skiing in Russia appeared sporadically in reports to Western Europe, so mention of the international significance ofNordiska Spelen trickled slowly back to Russia. Certainly, the efforts of the All-Russian Union of Skiers (VSL) to organize national championships from 1910 onward were undertaken with the recent 1909 Nordiska Spelen in mind: the main purpose of the VSL through the winters of 1911 and 1912 was to select the best skiers in Russia to send to the competitions scheduled for Stockholm in 1913. Over the course of two seasons, the most consistent were Aleksandr Nemukhin-one of the four Sokol'niki Club of SkiRunners (SKL) Moscow-St. Petersburg racers of 1911-and Pavel Bychkov, Russia's first national champion and a member of Organization of Ski Enthusiasts (OLLS). Although the Russian press held little hope that the nation's skiers would prevail, 102 the excitement was palpable as the pair left for Sweden in 1913 and St. Petersburg's Novae vremia sent along a special correspondent to cover. the races there in a series of articles. Low snow in Stockholm that year forced organizers ofNordiska Spelen to relocate 600 kilometers further north to Ostersund. Originally entered in the 90-kilometer event, held concurrently over the same course with the 60- and 30-kilometer contests, Nemukhin and Bychkov opted to switch to the latter on race day. Having never participated in an international competition of this caliber, the two Russians were overwhelmed by the abilities of the Scandinavian skiers, telling other ski racers after their return to Moscow: \"They are so far beyond us-they don't ski, they flY:' 103 Although neither was in the running (Nemukhin dropped out of the race, and Bychkov came in fifty-one minutes behind the winner, Jussi Niska of Finland), the race results indicate that Bychkov finished in twentieth place out of approximately a hundred competitors. 104 This was no mean achievement, considering that both Russians had stepped out of isolation from recent Scandinavian innovations in equipment, clothing and ski-waxing to compete in Sweden. Moreover, the first-place finisher, Jussi Niska, was the master of a new technique that involved a simultaneous thrust with both poles in combination with one, two or three. steps on the skis, a method which increased dramatically the efficiency of the ski stride. 105 Although the press was indignant-\"beaten in a most merciless way\" sniffed the St. Petersburg sport journal Gerkules-Nemukhin and Bychkov's participation at this international gathering impacted the development of Russian skiing well into the Soviet era. 106 Of particular interest to one young ski enthusiast were the tales they told of Scandinavian skiers who knew how to fabricate \"some sort of truly magic wax\" for wet snow. 107\n\n36\n\nEVERYONE TO SKIS!\n\nAs a nineteen-year-old ski racer in 1913, Nikolai Vasil'ev was one of the top competitors for SKL, having won the 60-kilometer Great Race in Moscow in early February as well as the 30-kilometer Russian Championship. As a result, he was sent to St. Petersburg by the Moscow Club of Skiers (MKL) to participate in an international ski race with a field that included a contingent of skiers from Finland led by Nordiska Spelen's recent champion, Jussi Niska.108 These athletes were among the vanguard in the art and science of ski base preparation. In modern cross-country skiing, especially racing, good wax applied to the bottom of the ski has always been crucial. Until the early 1980s, all Nordic competitors used a diagonal stride on uphill portions of the ski course, similar to bounding off the ball of the foot at a running gait. In choosing wax, skiers face a dilemma: they want the ski to glide fast over the snow on the downhill and flat sections but also to provide grip, or \"kick;' when going uphill. Wooden skis work very well when the snow is cold, and if the base of the ski is a soft wood such as birch and the ternperature is well below freezing, no wax is needed at all for grip. However, as temperatures approach zero degrees Celsius, the structure of the snow changes as the snowflakes' sharp points begin to melt away. The result is a slippery ski on the uphill. Moreover, as the temperature rises above freezing and snow becomes saturated with water, wooden bases start to absorb moisture, making them extremely slow. And, if a skier goes from wet snow back into cold snow, e.g., from a sunny, open field into shaded woods, skis can ice up on the bottom resulting in no glide whatsoever. Around 1913, Norwegian skiers began experimenting with pine resin, turpentine and beeswax concoctions that worked well in thawing, granular, slippery snow that was becoming more common at ski competitions such as those at the recently completed, and relocated, Nordiska Spelen. At these races, skiers would cook up a wax potion suited to the particular conditions of the day. 109 Niska and his Finnish compatriots were obviously privy to these recent Scandinavian technological developments. To their advantage, unusually moist snow had fallen in St. Petersburg just prior to the start of the race there, and the Finns had the expertise with which to concoct an appropriate wax.U 0 This was not the case for Russian skiers. Vasil'ev was unused to these conditions; with only a rudimentary pine tar-paraffin mixture on his ski-bases, he experienced first-hand the importance of proper waxing, having been outdistanced by the Finns and their well-prepared skis: \"This race ... showed me that it was possible to obtain good glide ... over wet snow, despite what the so-called 'experts' thought -that it's impossible to ski\n\nLong Boards in the Long Nineteenth Century\n\n37\n\nduring a thaw!\" 111 He bought a piece of wax from the Finns, subsequently analyzing the contents and experimenting with his own formulations. Vasil'ev's comments, however, are a bit disingenuous. According to Lieutenant K. B. Eimeleus, a graduate of the Russian Army's officer preparatory program at the Main Gymnastics-Fencing School in St. Petersburg and author of a military ski training manual published in 1912, Russian skiers had means available before Vasil'ev's 1913 race for maintaining glide on skis in wet snow. These were perhaps not as sophisticated as the Scandinavian wax formulations, and some were certainly more unsavory, but they were serviceable options nonetheless: \"After waxing, it is possible to run on smooth skis some 50 to 100 versts. Waxing one pair of skis comes to around five kopeks ... If there are no special waxes on hand it is possible to avail oneself of butter, stearin, lard, wax, kerosene, even herring fat and, similarly, other compositions containing fat. All of these are suitable in a cold situation, but do not last for long and after two to three versts are wiped off:' 112 Yet, there is no question that Vasil'ev's transaction with Finland's most accomplished ski racers was a watershed event. As the eldest of three ski-racing brothers, Nikolai ushered his siblings into the world of ski racing while he was fine-tuning his waxing expertise in subsequent years. The broth"
