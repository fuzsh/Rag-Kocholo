Fujifilm's Prescaleâ„¢

Pressure indicating film is used to measure contact pressures as low as 0.87 psi up to pressures as high as 43,500 psi. When pressure is applied, tiny microbubbles burst within the film to show the various degrees of pressure, through color density, that corresponds to the pressure and pressure distribution.

How Prescale Film Works

Simply place Prescale film between any two surfaces which come into contact. Varying colors of red patches will instantly appear revealing the pressure distribution between the surfaces. The intensity of the red colors of the Prescale film is related to the amount of pressure applied to it; the more intense the color, the greater the pressure.

There are nine different film types available ranging from 0.006 to 300 MPa (0.87~7.3 to 43,500 psi):

5LW Ultra Extreme Low

4LW Extreme Low

LLLW Ultra Super Low

LLW Super Low

LW Low

MW Medium (two-sheet)

MS Medium (mono-sheet)

HS High

HHS Super High

Please see the Specification Details below for details about each type.

For enhanced data analysis of the film, the Prescale Digital Analysis System is also available.
