        "text": "In the context of the rapid development and continuous improvement of electronic devices, thermal management issues are becoming increasingly prominent, especially as electronic devices are becoming more integrated and powerful. The heat generated inside the device must be dissipated quickly, otherwise it will negatively affect its performance and longevity. The quality of the thermal conductive material is critical to the longevity and performance of the product.\n\nJONES synthetic graphite films are a unique thermal conductive material capable of rapidly transferring heat, ensuring even distribution of temperatures within devices and averting the occurrence of hotspots. This not only helps prevent electronic devices from overheating but also enhances user experience by providing a more comfortable operating environment.\n\nTypically, we use the thermal conductivity coefficient K (W/m*K) to evaluate the thermal performance of thermal materials. Common metallic thermal materials such as iron/aluminum/copper have horizontal thermal conductivity coefficients of approximately 80/217/398 (W/mK). In contrast, synthetic graphite films boast an impressive horizontal thermal conductivity coefficient of up to 1800 W/m*K. It can be considered a top-tier thermal material.\n\nAt present, synthetic graphite is mainly prepared through high-temperature treatment of polyimide (PI) polymer materials. Its heat transfer mechanism involves predominantly horizontal elastic lattice vibrations and electron flow, achieved through strong covalent bonds in the horizontal direction. In contrast, heat transfer in the vertical direction relies mainly on van der Waals forces. The strength of covalent bonds is typically 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than van der Waals forces. Therefore, this difference results in varying thermal conductivity performance of graphite in different directions, exhibiting anisotropic thermal conductivity. The horizontal thermal conductivity ranges from 1000 to 1800 W/mK, while the vertical direction ranges from 6 to 15 W/mK.\n\nJONES synthetic graphite films exhibit outstanding thermal conductivity in the horizontal direction. They efficiently transfer heat laterally, ensuring uniform distribution of heat horizontally. This capability effectively eliminates localized hotspots, thereby mitigating the risk of excessive temperatures.\n\nIn a test with a heat source power of 5W, using a graphite sheet sized at 100mm * 50mm for a duration of 30 minutes, thermal imaging captured after the test indicates that with the graphite sheet in place, the temperature of the heat source only reached 78℃. In contrast, the control group without the graphite sheet recorded a significantly higher temperature of 210.8℃. The temperature distribution across the surface of the graphite material demonstrates its excellent heat uniformity. Conversely, in the control group, apart from the area immediately adjacent to the heat source experiencing elevated temperatures, other regions remained close to room temperature, indicating relatively poor thermal conductivity performance.\n\nFor some occasions that require efficient heat dissipation but space is limited, such as some electronic devices, the heat dissipation area cannot be effectively increased through heat dissipation fins. In this case, a synthetic graphite sheet with high thermal conductivity can be used to conduct heat to a spacious area, and then a suitable heat dissipation structure can be designed to achieve efficient heat dissipation.\n\nUnder typical circumstances, continuous exposure of the human body to the temperature of 70℃ for one minute, or 60℃ for more than five minutes, or even 45℃ for over two hours, can potentially result in burns to the skin. Prolonged contact with objects at temperatures exceeding 45℃, especially over an extended period, may lead to chronic burns, which tend to be deeper and more challenging to heal.\n\nIn modern times, people are almost constantly using electronic devices such as smartphones, which generate a significant amount of heat during operation. Prolonged contact with these devices may potentially damage the skin due to the heat they emit. To mitigate this risk, smartphone manufacturers are increasingly incorporating synthetic graphite film designs. These graphite film aid in the even dispersion of heat, thereby reducing the risk of smartphones overheating while providing a more comfortable user experience.\n\nTherefore, the practicality of synthetic graphite sheets and their beneficial effects on the performance and longevity of electronic devices have made them highly sought-after in the market, providing a feasible solution to the demands of the modern tech world. JONES，as a globally leading graphite brand, has been dedicated to the research and production of graphite materials and functional materials.
