        "text": "From agriculture and energy, to construction and industry, our team will help identify the right product for your application.\n\nOver the years as awareness of pollution control and our need to use and protect our water resources has increased, our industry has evolved to rise to these new challenges. Our cost-effective products help to ensure successful operations.\n\nOur geomembrane liners have broad applications, including in agriculture, aquaculture, recreational and athletics, energy source containment, golf and decorative, landfill & solid waste, mining, recreation, residential, storm water, and water and wastewater.\n\nOur team works with you to find the right product to meet your project requirements. Some types of applications we work with include floating covers, water & wastewater ponds, mining waste caps & ponds, landfill caps & cell liners, irrigation and raw water storage reservoirs, oil & gas water pits, animal waste lagoons, golf course & recreational ponds, and secondary containment options.\n\nCost-effective, custom Design-Build solutions optimize project economics to ensure the most efficient system possible.\n\nWith over 38 years of experience in the geosynthetics industry, our design-build team can help you identify cost effective and reliable solutions for your project. Our design-build work optimizes project economics to ensure the most efficient containment system possible across a variety of industries to find the right solution to your unique challenge.\n\nThroughout the custom design-build process, we work with your staff engineers and project owners to thoughtfully collaborate on the specifications for your unique project. Our staff estimators tap into their field and product knowledge to recommend the right geomembrane and geosynthetic products. And our installation technicians and supervisors utilize auto-CAD drawings and details, engineering support, and their extensive experience to deliver best-in-class installation on the most complex construction sites.\n\nOur U.S. fabrication facilities are fully stocked and prepared to meet any deadline with high-quality, custom-made solutions.\n\nOur state-of-the-art fabrication facilities across the U.S. have a fully stocked inventory and can meet the most demanding project deadlines. We can provide custom panel sizes of the various geomembranes to meet your design specifications or provide you with one of our prefabricated stock items. Using the latest in heat fusion technology, our fabricators can manufacture large panels quickly and arrange transportation to your job site.\n\nTaking certain steps in the fabrication process can help your project progress more smoothly when on the job site. For example, fabrication of flexible geomembrane liners eliminates up to 80% of field seaming – resulting in less construction time. Seaming the liners in a climate-controlled factory setting also eliminates weather issues, such as contamination from dust, dirt, water, wind, and site debris, which can cause early wear-and-tear to the geomembranes.\n\nOur exclusive network of approved installation partners ensure your investment is precisely installed to fit your needs.\n\nWhen you work with Viaflex to install your geomembrane liner systems, we bring more than 40 years of world-class experience with us. We are an Approved Installation Contractor, which is a program that aims to promote industry growth and provide better quality workmanship – recognizing geosynthetic installation companies that meet a standard of professionalism, ethics and business practices.\n\nOur CLI Construction Supervisors and many of our crew members are IAGI Certified Welding Technicians. The program recognizes the knowledge, experience, and skill of installers in Polyethylene, PVC, Reinforced and EPDM geomembrane welding. The CWT programs certify that experienced welders are always on the job.\n\nBeyond installation, our crews also inspect systems to ensure that critical functions are in good working condition. Factors including tension, drainage of surface water, holes, exposure to elements, and debris are covered in our maintenance inspection and repairs."
