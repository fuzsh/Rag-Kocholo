        "text": "REAR PROJECTION FILMS\n\nPro Displayâ€™s unique range of rear projection films consists of Pro Diffusion, Ultra Black and High Gain, designed to work in a wide range of lighting conditions. For specialist applications, Pro Display also offers holographic/transparent rear projection film and sun readable rear projection films. We can also provide interactive foil alternatives to each of the rear projection films in our range.\n\nRear projection films are ideal for use in high traffic environments, allowing people to pass by the front of the screen, or even interact with the content on screen, without affecting the image displayed.\n\nThis is completely dependent on the projector you are using and the size of your screen. Generally, the larger the screen the more distance you will need between screen and projector, but ultimately this is decided by the throw ratio of the projector lens.\n\nIf you want to minimise the space needed in a rear projection application, opting for a short throw or ultra short throw projector could reduce the distance needed by half of what is required with a standard projector.\n\nTo put this into context, if youâ€™re using a standard projector with a zoom lens of 1.5 you would need a distance of at least one and a half times the width of your screen, whereas a short throw can bring this distance down to roughly the same as the width of your screen or in some cases even smaller.\n\nFront projection is now undoubtedly the more popular option, but thatâ€™s not to say that rear projection doesnâ€™t have its advantages. When it comes to commercial use, rear projection may be the wiser option. Movie sets are a huge champion of using rear projection to bring their stories to life. Our rear projection screens feature in many of Hollywoodâ€™s notable films, including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and most recently, Wonder Woman 1984. Itâ€™s not just Hollywood that uses rear projectors to their advantage, stage set designers and event organisers opt for this solution due to the freedom it can offer, due to being unaffected by obstructions.\n\nAnother benefit of using rear projection is the flexibility it offers with lighting, usually in a front projection setup the lighting around the screen needs to be heavily controlled, whereas with a rear solution you can still operate in more ambient lighting environments without the image quality being compromised.\n\nIn many cases when using rear projection, itâ€™s usually easier to hide or conceal the projector itself when compared to using front projection. This is an especially useful feature across a wide range of sectors with artists opting to use our rear projection films as a less invasive alternative, allowing them to create uninterrupted environments which are altogether more intimate and immersive for visitors.\n\nPro Displayâ€™s unique range of rear projection films consists of Pro Diffusion and Ultra Black, designed to work in a wide range of lighting conditions. For specialist applications, Pro Display also offers Holographic/transparent rear projection film and Sun Readable rear projection films. We can also provide interactive alternatives to each of the rear projection foils in our range including our Clearview (transparent) rear projection transparent film and sunscreen back projection film.\n\nOur rear projection foils are ideal for use in high traffic environments, allowing people to pass by the front of the screen, or even interact with the content onscreen, without affecting the image displayed."
