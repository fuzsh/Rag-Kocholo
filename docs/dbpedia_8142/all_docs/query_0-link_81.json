        "text": "DLP technology is centered around the digital micromirror device (DMD), which is an array of individually addressable, highly reflective aluminum micromirrors. The DMD allows developers to perform high speed, efficient, and reliable spatial light modulation. Using TI's proven semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, each DMD contains up to 8 million individually controlled micromirrors built on top of an associated CMOS memory cell.\n\nThe DMD is paired with visible LED, laser, or lamp illumination for display and can also support UV or IR wavelengths for light control applications. The illumination source and micromirrors are synchronized to achieve the projected output.\n\nDLP chipsets typically include a DMD, a controller and a power management integrated circuit (PMIC) driver to enable maximum pattern rates and excellent image quality. These are designed using TI's extensive knowledge about how to reliably drive the micromirrors across a wide range of operating conditions. The chipset can also synchronize with external sensors, cameras, motors, or other devices.\n\nThe DLP chipset includes:\n\nDMD – Digital micromirror device\n\nDMD Controller – provides the convenient interface for reliable, high speed control of the micromirrors\n\nDMD Micromirror Drivers – deliver analog clocking and reset signals\n\nConfiguration PROM – configures select DMD Controllers (sold as a programmed IC or offered as downloadable firmware)\n\nTo best meet your design needs and accelerate your time-to-market, DLP® Products works with a variety of third parties to help with everything from optical modules and hardware design to specialty software and other production services.
