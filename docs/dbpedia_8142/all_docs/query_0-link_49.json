When you use your Surface and Android together, you can quickly and easily get to the things you use every day—your text messages, phone calls, notifications, photos, music, files, notes, to-dos, email, and more.\n\nNotes:\n\nSome apps might not be available in all countries or regions. For system requirements, check the download page for each app in the Microsoft Store or Google Play Store.\n\nOn your Surface that's running Windows 11, make sure you have the latest updates. To learn how to check for updates, see Update Windows.\n\nSurface Duo runs on Android and has many of the Microsoft apps mentioned here already installed.
