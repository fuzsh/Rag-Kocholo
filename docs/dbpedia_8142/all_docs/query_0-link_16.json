        "meta_description": "Fujifilm's Prescale Film is a single-use, pressure sensitive film that measures pressure ranging from 0.05 to 300 Mpa (about 7 to 43,500 psi) through peak pressure snapshots. As it captures a pressure profile via a color scale, the film reveals both pressure distribution and pressure magnitude between any two contacting or impacting surfaces.",

        "text": "Fujifilm's Prescaleâ„¢\n\nPressure indicating film is used to measure contact pressures as low as 0.87 psi up to pressures as high as 43,500 psi. When pressure is applied, tiny microbubbles burst within the film to show the various degrees of pressure, through color density, that corresponds to the pressure and pressure distribution.\n\nFeatures & Benefits of Prescale Film\n\nAffordable and easy to use\n\nOne-time use\n\nStatic pressure measurement\n\nPeak pressure snapshot\n\nHow Prescale Film Works\n\nSimply place Prescale film between any two surfaces which come into contact. Varying colors of red patches will instantly appear revealing the pressure distribution between the surfaces. The intensity of the red colors of the Prescale film is related to the amount of pressure applied to it; the more intense the color, the greater the pressure.\n\nThere are nine different film types available ranging from 0.006 to 300 MPa (0.87~7.3 to 43,500 psi):\n\n5LW Ultra Extreme Low\n\n4LW Extreme Low\n\nLLLW Ultra Super Low\n\nLLW Super Low\n\nLW Low\n\nMW Medium (two-sheet)\n\nMS Medium (mono-sheet)\n\nHS High\n\nHHS Super High\n\nPlease see the Specification Details below for details about each type.\n\nFor enhanced data analysis of the film, the Prescale Digital Analysis System is also available."
