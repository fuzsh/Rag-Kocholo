        "text": "Residents of Queens speak over 190 languages and with the introduction of LanguageLine at all our locations, our customers can now receive assistance in their preferred language with just a phone call from a staff member to a live interpreter. Now, we can truly say that at Queens Public Library, we speak your language. \"\n\n— Assistant Director, Queens Public Library\n\nThe staff at LanguageLine has an exceptional overall knowledge base for translation across various media. Working with their staff has been ideal as the project management is handled with great care and attention to detail. I cannot thank them enough for their guidance and assistance in creating a more welcoming experience for our visitors who do not speak English. \"\n\n— Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco\n\nWith this technology, we have no excuse to be delayed due to language barriers. This solution plays a critical role in helping us care for patients and it can even be lifesaving. \"\n\n— Patient Experience Manager, New York-based ambulatory surgery center\n\nThe video interpreting solution offered by LanguageLine was critical to communicate with a patient who was deaf during an embolization of an intracranial aneurysm. The LanguageLine video monitor was brought into the neuroradiology operating room to enable communication by my voice and American Sign Language. \"\n\n— Barry J Segal MD, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, The Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY"
