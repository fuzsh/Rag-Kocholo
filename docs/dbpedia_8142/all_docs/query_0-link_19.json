Screen mirroring is a technique that allows you to display the content on your phone’s screen on another device, such as a TV. This is done wirelessly, using a technology called “casting” or “streaming.”\n\nCasting and streaming work by creating a wireless connection between your phone and your TV. This connection allows the content on your phone’s screen to be displayed on your TV in real-time. There are several different ways to create this wireless connection, depending on the type of devices that you’re using.\n\nFor iPhone and iPad\n\nFor iPhone and iPad users; all our screen mirroring apps work on every iPhone and iPad. Just download the application for your TV brand in the App Store and give it a try. Once connected, you can “cast” the content on your phone’s screen to your TV, and watch movies from your phone on your TV without HDMI.\n\nAndroid Phones and Tablets\n\nAndroid users also have several options for screen mirroring. The most common method is to use a “casting” app, such as AirBeamTV. Our apps allow you to wirelessly connect your phone to any popular TV. Once connected, you can “cast” the content on your phone’s screen to your TV, and watch movies from your phone on your TV without HDMI. We offer revolutionary applications to mirror Android to TV.

Most modern smartphones, including iPhone and Android devices, are compatible with screen mirroring. However, not all TVs are compatible, so it’s important to check the specifications of your TV before you proceed.\n\nMost TVs from 2014 are so called Smart TVs and always compatible for screen mirroring. This means that you don’t need additional hardware to using screen mirroring apps like the ones from AirBeamTV.\n\nIs your TV older than 2014? Then there is a good chance that you need a so-called media player or media streamer such as a Chromecast, Fire TV Stick or a Roku Stick.\n\nTips\n\nWe always recommend installing the latest Android or Apple software on your mobile device. This prevents error messages or malfunctions.\n\nIt is also smart to remove apps that you never use. That makes your phone faster and makes the battery last longer.\n\nIn addition, in some cases it may also make a difference to empty the cache on the TV.\n\n2 | Connect Phone & TV To The Same Network\n\nScreen mirroring applications are necessary in order to communicate the content displayed on our phones and tablets to our television screens. Making sure that all devices communicate on the same wifi network is essential for the function of these applications to work properly and give us the best home-entertainment experience.\n\nBy connecting your phone or tablet to the same WiFi network as your TV, the connection will be able to communicate more efficiently, allowing you more access and control over what you watch.\n\n3 | Download Screen Mirroring App\n\nGo to www.airbeam.tv\n\nClick TV brands in the top menu.\n\nSelect your TV brand or media-streamer.\n\nClick iPhone, iPad, Mac or Android.\n\nDownload the screen mirroring app for your selected device.\n\n4 | Connect App With TV\n\nAirBeamTV screen mirroring apps automatically find your tv when it’s connected to the same network as your phone. Just do this:\n\nSelect your TV in the app that has been found in your network.\n\n5 | Start Mirroring & Select Content\n\nClick ‘Start mirroring’ and find the media you want to play.\n\n6 | Watch Movies From Your Phone To TV\n\nThat’s it. That’s how you watch movies from any phone to tv without HDMI cables or adapters. Screen mirroring apps are a great piece of technology to create a smart home.\n\nCan I watch all movies with screen mirroring?\n\nScreen mirroring from a phone to TV can be an incredibly convenient way to access content from the small screen to the big one. However, it is important to note that not all movies are suitable for mirroring. If there is DRM protection or other blocking content restrictions, you will not be able to use screen mirroring as they block certain ways of accessing the content.\n\nEven Netflix has a black screen on certain phones that won’t allow screen mirroring, so it’s worth double checking before attempting to try and screen mirror anything.\n\nUnfortunately, companies like Netflix choose to protect their content with DRM. This is not something that AirBeamTV can influence.\n\nMovies To Watch With Your Boyfriend\n\nIf you’re looking for some romantic movies to watch with your boyfriend, Ticket to Paradise and Purple Hearts are really great options.
