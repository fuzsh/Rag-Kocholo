        "text": "With PODS, you don't need to pay for your entire move upfront, making it easier on your budget. And like with most hotel reservations, you can reserve your moving container with a credit card — no payments due until seven days before your container delivery.\n\nAt PODS, you rent your containers by the month, so you can take your time loading and unloading, eliminating the chaos of a house full of boxes, and sparing yourself a lot of stress.\n\nWe deliver your container. Take all the time you need to load it -- and there's no need to meet the driver or be present when we deliver or pick up your container. Load on your schedule, right in your driveway. Want help? We can connect you with local packing and loading companies.\n\n“The whole PODS process made our move as easy as it could be. We were able to move our belongings into the container at our own pace. The containers were picked up and taken away exactly as we needed. We did have to adjust our dates through the process and PODS was able to meet our needs. Each agent I spoke with on the phone was extremely helpful. Our items arrived in our new location (940 miles away) exactly on time!”\n\n“Using PODS eliminated a lot of extra handling as we had to wait until our home was finished construction. We moved from MN to SC, and needed time to locate a new home and then for the time to complete construction.\n\nU-Haul would have been cheaper, but we would have needed to load, unload, store, then reload and unload again, with PODS we just had to load and then unload only once.”\n\n“The ease made this a great experience. I was moving across the country with no permanent residence and needed to keep my items in the container at the Chandler facility in AZ. I got a few items out of my container once while it was at the PODS storage center and that was done with ease as well. Very friendly staff and such a convenient way to move. My belongings were in top shape when they arrived. I would definitely use PODS again and will recommend it to others.”\n\nThe cost of your long-distance move is dependent on several factors, including how much you are moving, how far you’re traveling, and the time of year. Moving with PODS instead of a full-service mover can help you save. Call (855) 706-4758 for the most accurate quote for your move.\n\nLong-distance moving is a broad term. It can be anything from moving a couple towns over to a full-blown cross-country job relocation. Generally, if your move has you changing cities, it can be considered long distance.\n\nMoving long-distance can be stressful, however, PODS offers a flexible, convenient solution. Call our long-distance moving experts to book your container(s) and have them delivered to your home. Load up your belongings at your own pace, and PODS will pick the container(s) up and send them to your next home. Unload your things into your next home and you’re done.\n\nThe best long-distance moving companies are the ones you can trust to get your things where you need them when you need them. Long-distance moves can be complex, so look for reputable companies that have years of valuable experience and give you flexibility for your cross-country move. Trusted with over six million moves and twenty-five years of experience, PODS has the perfect moving solutions for your needs.\n\nPODS pricing changes based on a few factors, including container availability, the time of year, how many containers you need, and the distance you and your container(s) are traveling. We encourage you to call (855) 706-4758 for a quote from our team of moving experts.\n\nFirst things first, check the laws. Some states like California and Hawaii have strict plant protections in place to protect their local flora. When it’s time to move your plants across the country, we recommend either shipping them or keeping them with you as you move. PODS is a great solution for your long-distance move since you can load all your household goods in a container, giving you room in your car to keep your plants safe and sound. Read more about how to move your plants without killing them."
