        "text": "Before you try out the recommendations below, be sure to check if your device's software and related apps are updated to the latest version. To update your mobile device's software, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1. Go to Settings > Software update.\n\nStep 2. Tap on Download and install.\n\nStep 3. Follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nTo protect your Galaxy phone, while the device is manufactured and distributed from the factory, the front, rear, camera, and side parts of the device are covered with a protective film. This protective film attaches directly to the device, mainly to the charging hole, microphones, speaker holes, and cameras. In the case of the microphone hole at the bottom specifically, a large protective film and a small sticker may be attached in two layers, so even the second small sticker must be completely removed.\n\nIf you don't hear the receiving or outgoing sound clearly or the sound is erratically cut off, it may be because the protective film that was attached to the speaker and microphone holes on the device is blocking the holes. In addition, if the protective film attached to the camera is not removed, the picture may be out of focus or cause angle distortion when you take a picture, and you may have a picture with degraded quality.\n\nIf you are experiencing difficulties with your Samsung mobile, tablet, or wearables, you can send us a question in the Samsung Members app.\n\nThis allows us to take a closer look at what is happening. The data is anonymised and only held for the duration of the investigation. Find out more about sending an error report through the 'How to use the Samsung Members app'."
