There are also different regulations for recording audio and video footage.\n\nBest indoor camera\n\nNest Cam (Battery)\n\n4.25\n\n119.99 (sale price)\n\nInfo current as of post date. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change.\n\nExpectation of privacy laws\n\nIn the US, it’s usually legal for you to install a residential security camera and record video. But US citizens are also guaranteed a reasonable expectation of privacy, which extends to video recording.\n\nThat means you can’t record people anywhere that is typically considered a private place (e.g. the bathroom). Likewise, you have the right not to be filmed in those same areas. Here are the most common places where a security camera could get you into trouble:\n\nBathrooms\n\nBedrooms\n\nChanging rooms\n\nLocker rooms\n\nHotel rooms\n\nWhat is a reasonable expectation of privacy?\n\nAn easy way to remember what falls under the “reasonable expectation of privacy” is to think about times when you would normally draw the blinds or close the door—changing clothes, using the restroom, showering, etc.\n\nBottom line, if you wouldn’t normally do it in public, it probably shouldn’t show up on any of your home security footage.\n\nAmazon.com price as of post date. Read full disclaimer.\n\nConsent laws\n\nConsent laws dive into whether or not it’s legal to record someone on video or audio without their permission. On the national level, it’s legal to record a conversation—either in person or over the phone—if you have at least one person’s consent. This is called the “one-party consent” law. It means that as long as you are part of the conversation that you’re recording, it’s legal for you to record it.\n\nThe one-party consent law doesn’t cover video surveillance, but if there’s a conversation involved, the rule applies. Because most security cameras record audio as well as video, you should operate your camera with the one-party consent law in mind.\n\nSecurity camera laws by state\n\nWhere video surveillance laws get tricky is on the local and state levels. Some states have stricter security camera laws than what’s permitted by the federal government. Currently, 15 states have specific security camera laws. In states without specific laws, you should check with your local city and county government to make sure it’s okay for you to install that outdoor camera.\n\nVideo surveillance laws by state\n\nThis table breaks down the 15 states with security camera laws and notes where video surveillance is allowed and under what circumstances.\n\nState\n\nPublic places allowed\n\nPrivate places allowed\n\nHidden cameras allowed\n\nConsent required\n\nAlabama\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nAlabama\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nIn private places\n\nCalifornia*\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nDelaware\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\nFlorida\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nGeorgia†\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nHawaii\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nKansas\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\nMaine\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\nMichigan\n\nYes\n\nWith consent\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\nMinnesota\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\nTennessee\n\nYes\n\nWith consent\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\nUtah\n\nYes\n\nWith consent\n\nWith consent\n\nYes\n\n*In California it’s illegal to make a video recording of any communication considered confidential, regardless of consent.\n\n†Georgia allows video surveillance in private and public settings, but the cameras must be in plain sight.\n\nWhat about hidden cameras?\n\nIn general, hidden cameras are allowed as long as you stick to the reasonable expectation of privacy and one-party consent rules. Plus, 11 of the 15 states with home security camera laws explicitly allow them—with caveats. In three states, the hidden camera must be in a public place, and in the remaining eight you need the consent of the person being recorded.\n\nSecurity cameras and privacy\n\nWhether you’re a homeowner or a renter, adding a simple doorbell camera or a full-on surveillance system is a smart security move. Burglars have even said that a home with a camera outside isn’t worth the trouble.\n\nBut what about all the activity your camera picks up that isn’t a possible burglar? Is it okay to install a security camera that’s aimed at your neighbor’s house? Can law enforcement demand your video footage?\n\nThose are just a few of the privacy issues that get people tied up in knots over surveillance cameras. Unfortunately, privacy is rarely a simple issue. To help unravel some of those knots, we’ve got answers to the most commonly asked questions about security cameras and privacy.\n\nAre security cameras an invasion of privacy?\n\nNo. The simple act of installing an outdoor camera to keep an eye on your home (or kids, or pet) isn’t a privacy violation. Where it gets murky is how you use your security camera and its video footage. Here are a few times when a security camera may be an invasion of privacy:\n\nYour camera can see into a neighbor’s home, especially if you can see private places like a bedroom or bathroom.\n\nYou have a camera in a private place in your home.\n\nYou use a hidden camera without consent in states where consent is required.\n\nCan my neighbor video record me on my property?\n\nYes—as long as your neighbor is only recording activity that happens in public places, like the yard or driveway. Because outside areas that are in public view have no reasonable expectation of privacy, a recorded image from a public place isn’t a violation of privacy.\n\nThe exception is if your neighbor’s video camera picks up audio conversations without your consent. In all 50 states, the one-party consent rule applies, so this could be both a privacy and a legal violation.\n\nIs it illegal to put cameras in your child’s room?\n\nTechnically, it probably is. Baby monitors have become the norm for parents of newborns, but a camera in a bedroom is a violation of the expectation of privacy rule. And let’s be real, your baby isn’t going to complain about an invasion of privacy, but it gets tricky if you have a nanny or visiting relatives who also get caught on camera when they’re putting the baby down.\n\nIf you live in one of the states that allows cameras in private places, this is a non-issue. For everyone else, one solution is to turn off the camera unless the baby is sleeping alone in their room. When it comes to bigger kids, think about why you want a camera in their room and look for other (totally legal) ways to keep them safe.\n\nLearn more in our guide to nanny cam laws.\n\nCan a law enforcement officer demand my video footage?\n\nNo. Recorded images from your home security camera are your private property. If law enforcement asks to see your footage to help with an investigation, you have the right to say no.\n\nBut if you’ve already posted security footage online or in an app like Ring Neighbors, the shared footage is no longer private. However, you don’t have to supply additional footage if investigators ask.\n\nRing, privacy, and the police\n\nRing has grabbed a lot of headlines for both privacy issues (cameras getting hacked) and its partnerships with police across the country. The original idea was to help citizens and law enforcement work together to make communities safer, but the execution got a little messy.\n\nTo find out more, read our Ring FAQ or watch our videos about Ring doorbell legal issues and its police partnerships.\n\nDo I have to post a sign for video surveillance?\n\nNo. Posting signs for security camera recording isn’t legally required, especially if the camera is in plain sight in a public place. It’s more common to see video surveillance signs posted for businesses, not private residences. If you want to avoid potential consent issues (particularly if your state requires it) posting a sign could save you future headaches.\n\nVideo recording vs. audio recording\n\nResidential security camera laws are convoluted enough, but the different regulations for video and audio recording make it even harder. Here is our cheat sheet to help keep it all straight:\n\nVideo recording in public places is allowed in all 50 states.\n\nAudio recording—even as part of a video—falls under the one-party consent rule, which means at least one person has to give consent to the recording to make it legal.\n\n11 states require all parties to give consent for audio recording\n\nCalifornia\n\nConnecticut\n\nFlorida\n\nIllinois\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMontana\n\nNevada\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington\n\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of caution. If you’re not confident that your audio or video surveillance ensures others a reasonable expectation of privacy, don’t do it.\n\nFAQ\n\nIf the camera is on your neighbor’s property, you can’t physically block the camera’s lens or recording device. The best way to avoid getting caught on your neighbor’s security camera is to block your activity from view. Whether it’s closing the curtains or putting up a well-placed patio umbrella, your best bet is to shield your property from prying eyes.\n\nNeighbors can (and some certainly will) complain about a CCTV system, but whether or not that complaint has any grounds is a different matter. If your neighbor is worried that your video surveillance cameras are looking into their home, it’s reasonable for them to discuss the matter with you.\n\nBecause your concern should be the safety of the people and pets on your property, it should be easy to adjust your security camera placement to make sure it’s not prying where it shouldn’t be. But if your neighbor runs to law enforcement or the neighborhood HOA first, it’s unlikely that their complaint will get you into trouble—unless your camera is violating the expectation of privacy rule.\n\nSurveillance that violates the expectation of privacy rule or captures audio or video without proper consent (where applicable) is illegal. To make sure you’re not recording illegally, check with your local city and county guidelines before setting up home security cameras.\n\nCompare security cameras\n\nProduct\n\nBest for\n\nPrice\n\nCloud storage price\n\nVideo resolution\n\nType\n\nLearn more\n\nRead review\n\nBest overall$149.99Starts at $6.99/mo.1440p (2K) Indoor/outdoor wire-free View on AmazonRead ReviewBest budget $34.18Starts at $2.99/mo.1080p Indoor/outdoor wiredView on AmazonRead ReviewBest for smart home $199.99Starts at $4.99/mo.1440p (2K) Indoor/outdoor wire-freeView on AmazonRead ReviewBest tech $179.99Starts at $6.00/mo.1080pIndoor/outdoor wire-freeView on Google StoreRead ReviewBest indoor camera $42.99Starts at $2.99/mo.1920p (2K)Indoor wiredView on AmazonRead Review\n\nAmazon.com price as of post date.
