        "text": "What those letters and numbers mean\n\nHere's what each rating means, according to the Motion Picture Association of America:\n\n¦ G. General audiences. All ages admitted. A G-rated motion picture contains nothing in theme, language, nudity, sex, violence or other matters that, in the view of the Rating Board, would offend parents whose younger children view the motion picture. Depictions of violence are minimal. No nudity, sex scenes or drug use are present.\n\n¦ PG. Parental guidance suggested. Some material may not be suitable for children. A PG-rated motion picture should be investigated by parents before they let their younger children attend. The PG rating indicates, in the view of the Rating Board, that parents may consider some material unsuitable for their children, and parents should make that decision. There may be some brief profanity and some depictions of violence or brief nudity. But these elements are not deemed so intense as to require that parents be strongly cautioned beyond the suggestion of parental guidance. There is no drug use content in a PG-rated motion picture.\n\n¦ PG-13. Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. This is a sterner warning by the Rating Board to parents to determine whether their children under age 13 should view the motion picture, as some material may not be suited for them. A PG-13 motion picture may go beyond the PG rating in theme, violence, nudity, sensuality, language, adult activities, but does not reach the restricted R category. Any drug use will require at least a PG-13 rating. More than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating. There may be depictions of violence, but generally not both realistic and extreme or persistent violence. The single use of one of the harsher sexually derived words, though only as an expletive, requires at least a PG-13 rating.\n\n¦ R. Restricted. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. An R-rated motion picture, in the view of the board, contains some adult material. The film may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Generally, it is not considered appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them."
