        "text": "Are you ready for one of the most terrifying new movies of 2024? Alien: Romulus, the latest entry in the iconic sci-fi horror film franchise, has emerged from its ovomorph to make you scream in a theater (not in space, because, well, nobody will be able to hear you) of your choosing. So, what better time to head back to a cinema near you to scare yourself silly with one of 2024's most anticipated movies?\n\nIf you're squeamish and/or can't stomach horror films, don't worry. There are plenty more new films to keep an eye out for in the weeks and months ahead. To give you an idea of when they'll arrive, we've compiled a comprehensive list of the biggest new movies that have just launched/will launch in theaters between now and the end of the year. Each entry contains key intel on these flicks, too, including their release dates, latest trailer, cast details, story briefs, and more. For all of your big screen entertainment needs, then, you don't need to look anywhere else. So, hop to it!\n\nNew movies: August 2024\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nRelease date: out now (worldwide)\n\nThe seventh (ninth if you include the awful Alien vs Predator movies) entry in the series created by legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott, Alien: Romulus tells a standalone tale that we think will get the stuttering franchise back on track. Fede Álvarez (2013's Evil Dead) is on directing duties from a script he co-penned with Rodo Sayagues, while Scott is among its many producers.\n\nSet between Alien and Aliens on the franchise's timeline, Romulus counts Cailee Spaeny (Priscilla), Isabela Merced (The Last of Us season 2), Archie Renaux (Shadow and Bone), and David Jonsson (Rye Lane) among its young but talented cast. Here's a brief story synopsis for anyone interested: \"While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.\"\n\nAlien: Romulus' menacing first trailer teased it would be the first genuinely great sequel we've seen since Aliens, while its equally chilling, facehugging-centric official trailer and final trailer suggest it'll be a scare-filled summer for movie goers. With its 82% critical and 88% audiences scores on Rotten Tomatoes, it seems everyone's in agreement over how scarily good it is, too.\n\nBefore you watch it, read our exclusive interview with Alvarez to see why Alien: Romulus wants everyone to hear you scream over the sci-fi horror series' frightfully bold evolution.\n\nBlink Twice\n\nRelease date: August 22 (Australia); August 23 (US and UK)\n\nGet Out meets Don't Worry, Darling meets Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery in this psychological thriller film from first-time director Zoë Kravitz (Selina Kyle in The Batman). Naomi Ackie plays cocktail waitress Frida, who – alongside her best friend – is whisked away to an idyllic island by Channing Tatum's tech billionaire Slater King (that's where the Knives Out 2 comparisons come from) to party with a bunch of wild individuals.\n\nHowever, Frida soon realizes that not all is as it seems in this predominantly rich white folk-dwelling location (there's the Get Out vibes) as she begins to questions what's real and what isn't (and that's the Don't Worry, Darling tonality). Christian Slater, Kyle MacLachlan, Simon Rex, Adria Arjona, Geena Davis, and Alia Shawkat are also part of proceedings in this joint Warner Bros-MGM production.\n\nThe Crow\n\nRelease date: August 23 (worldwide)\n\nNo, your eyes aren't deceiving you – we haven't included two entries for Bill Skarsgard's Boy Kills World. Although it looks similar in tone and vibe, The Crow's latest film reboot (which Skarsgard stars in) is a separate entity to his other 2024 movie offering.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the 1994 cult classic that Brandon Lee originally starred in: The Crow tells the story of soulmates Eric Draven (Skarsgard) and Shelly Webster (FKA Twigs), who are brutally murdered when Shelly's past catches up with her. However, when he's given the chance to save her by sacrificing himself, a superpower-imbued Draven is revived and embarks on a blood-soaked quest for vengeance against those who mercifully killed the loved-up pair. Rupert Sanders (Foundation on Apple TV Plus, Ghost in the Shell's remake) is in the hot seat for this one.\n\nAFRAID\n\nRelease date: August 29 (Australia); August 30 (US and UK)\n\nThe latest in an increasingly long list of artificial intelligence (AI) inspired movies, AFRAID – yep, it's in all caps and those italics are intentional – stars John Cho as Curtis, a family man who introduces a new smart home device called AIA into his home. Color me shocked, but things take a turn for the worse after AIA learns more about the family she 'serves' and those who supposedly 'threaten' their existence.\n\nChris Weitz (The Golden Compass, The Creator) is the writer and director of this flick, which seems to be influenced by every recent AI-centric movie, including M3GAN, Kimi, and Mission: Impossible 7. We'll learn if it's one of 2024's new movies worth seeing later this year.\n\nNew movies: September 2024\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nRelease date: September 5 (Australia); September 6 (US and UK)\n\nThe long in-development sequel to 1988 surreal comedy-horror Beetlejuice is out this year, and its title – Beetlejuice Beetlejuice – is a very clever call back to the original film's way of summoning the mischievous ghost.\n\nMichael Keaton and Winona Ryder are returning as the titular trickster and Lydia Deetz respectively, while Jenna Ortega (Wednesday, Scream) will play Astrid, Lydia's daughter. Catherine O'Hara, Monica Bellucci, and Willem Dafoe are also involved, while iconic gothic filmmaker Tim Burton is back on directing duties after helming the fist flick. Its first trailer teased more ghostly mayhem to come in the sequel, while its second (watch it above) gives us a much clearer idea of its plot and how closely it'll follow in its predecessor's footsteps from a practical effects standpoint.\n\nSpeak No Evil\n\nRelease date: September 12 (UK and Australia); September 13 (US)\n\nJames McAvoy will aim to spookily charm audiences ahead of Halloween in this psychological horror-thriller. The beloved Scottish actor plays Paddy who, alongside his wife Ciara (Aisling Franciosi) and mute son Ant (Dan Hough), befriends and then invites the Dalton family (Scott McNairy, Mackenzie Davis, and Alix West Lefler) to their home in the idyllic British countryside. Unsurprisingly, things take a turn for the macabre not long after.\n\nThe Woman in Black's James Watkins is on dual writing and directing duties here, while horror extraordinaires Blumhouse and Universal will distribute the flick. Speak No Evil only has a US release date at the moment, so keep an eye out for its UK and Australian launch confirmations soon.\n\nThe Wild Robot\n\nRelease date: September 12 (Australia); September 20 (US); October 18 (UK)\n\nBlack Panther's Lupita Nyong'o will give life to this absolutely gorgeous-looking animated film's protagonist Roz in what appears to be another delightful and incredibly moving flick from DreamWorks Animation. Shipwrecked on an uninhabited island, Roz is initially viewed as an outcast by the islet's flora and fauna. When its animals soon realize Roz is an empathetic, innocent, and helpful robot, though, they accept her place in their ecosystem.\n\nThe Wild Robot's voice cast is absolutely stacked with A-listers, with the likes of Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us), Catherine O'Hara (Schitt's Creek), Bill Nighy (Living), Kit Connor (Heartstopper), and Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once) lending their vocal talents to various critters. We can't wait for this one.\n\nMy Old Ass\n\nRelease date: September 13 (US); September 27 (UK); TBC (Australia)\n\nAnother original spin on time-travel and coming-of-age-based narratives, My Old Ass stars Maisy Stella as Elliott, an 18-year-old who, thanks to a mushroom-fuelled trip, winds up meeting her 39-year-old future self (played by Aubrey Plaza), who starts doling out life advice to her young counterpart. Initially pleased to learn where she'll go wrong in life, teenage Elliott soon realizes she has to make decisions for herself, not ones based on her future self.\n\nWill one of September's new movies be worth watching? Based on its trailer, it'll appeal plenty of indie fans, as well as anyone wanting to see Plaza in another comedy-laced role.\n\nTransformers One\n\nRelease date: September 19 (Australia), September 20 (US), October 11 (UK)\n\nAfter multiple live-action entries, the Transformers franchise will hope to get a much-needed shot in the arm with Transformers One, a brand-new animated film helmed by Pixar alumnus Josh Cooley (Toy Story 4, Inside Out).\n\nAn origin story of sorts for the Autobots and Decepticons, it'll explore the friendship between, and then breakdown of said relationship between Optimums Prime and Megatron. Marvel stars including Chris Hemsworth (the Thor movies), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), and Brian Tyree Henry (Eternals), plus other big names like Jon Hamm, Keegan-Michael Key, and Laurence Fishburne will lend their voices to those famous robots in disguise. Read our Transformers movies in order guide while we wait for its arrival.\n\nWolfs\n\nRelease date: September 19 (Australia); September 20 (US and UK)\n\nA-listers George Clooney and Brad Pitt reunite in this hitman buddy cop-comedy flick that, following its theatrical release in September, will be available to stream at home via Apple TV Plus.\n\nIt looks like Wolfs, which has been written and directed by Jon Watts – he of the MCU's Spider-Man film trilogy fame – will benefit hugely from the duo's natural charisma and undisputed talents, too. In it, Clooney and Pitt play professional fixers, both of whom are hired to cover up the same crime. Much to their chagrin, they're forced to work together to not only clean up the murder scene they've been called to, but to also unravel the mystery behind some felony. Based on that synopsis, what's not to love about one of September's new movies?\n\nNever Let Go\n\nRelease date: September 20 (US), September 26 (Australia), and September 27 (UK)\n\nHalle Berry stars in this Lionsgate psychological thriller/horror that continues the genres' fascination with telling the tale of a barely surviving family in the middle of the woods.\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic world where evil lurks around every corner, a mother (Berry) and her young twin sons' only hope of survival is to physically tether themselves – via the longest ropes you've ever seen – to their woods-based abode. However, when one of the boys begins to question if the threats lurking in the shadows are even real, the family's tight bond is shattered, triggering a terrifying fight to stay alive. One of 2024's new movies that'll be surprisingly good or extremely generic.\n\nMegalopolis\n\nRelease date: September 26 (Australia); September 27 (US and UK)\n\nA film over 40 years in the making, Megalopolis will finally arrive in theaters before the end of September. Famed (and, lately, controversial) director Francis Ford Coppola's latest feature boasts an all-star cast – Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel, Aubrey Plaza, Laurence Fishburne, Jason Schwartzman, and Jon Voight are just a few of the big names attached to it – and an intriguing, albeit bizarre story that led to it receiving mixed reviews upon its Cannes 2024 world premiere.\n\nBilled as a \"Roman Epic fable set in an imagined Modern America\", it follows the brewing conflict between Driver's idealistic artist Cesar Catilina and Esposito's Mayor Franklin Cicero, the latter of whom wants to maintain the City of New Rome's status quo of class and wealth divisions, and partisan warfare.\n\nNew movies: October 2024\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux\n\nRelease date: October 4 (worldwide)\n\nFive years after Joker, one of the best superhero movies – a topic worth debating on another day – was released, a sequel will finally make its way into theaters. Considering Joker: Folie à Deux was only going to get made if director Todd Phillips and lead star Joaquin Phoenix could find a story worth telling, it seems the pair – alongside Lady Gaga, who'll play Harley Quinn in the movie – have done just that.\n\nRead our Joker: Folie à Deux trailer #1 breakdown for more details about what that teaser, well, teased and then watch the latest trailer above for an even better idea about what it's about. Alternatively, read its official plot synopsis here: \"Joker: Folie À Deux finds Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love (Lady Gaga), but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\"\n\nSaturday Night\n\nRelease date: October 11 (US); TBC (UK and Australia)\n\nSaturday Night Live has become a cultural juggernaut since its October 11, 1975 debut, but it was almost a complete failure ahead of its inaugural show. Almost 50 years on from that night, Jason Reitman (2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife) delivers a wild, \"inspired by true events\" flick that tells the story of the 90 minutes leading up to the sketch/improv comedy series' first-ever showing.\n\nIt's got a whole host of big names attached to it, too. Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard, iconic actors J.K. Simmons and Willem Dafoe, Perry Mason's Matthew Rhys, The Fablemans' Gabriel LaBelle, Bottoms' Rachel Ann Sennott, Dickinson's Ella Hunt, and The Responder's Emily Fairn are just some of its all-star ensemble cast.\n\nFlight Risk\n\nRelease date: October 18 (US and UK): TBC (Australia)\n\nMark Wahlberg is famous for playing heroic characters on the big screen, but Flight Risk sees him tackle a rare antagonistic role – albeit in a film that, based on everything its trailer shows, might have given its biggest plot reveals away already.\n\nWahlberg plays Daryl Booth, a pilot charged with flying FBI agent Madelyn Harris (Michelle Dockery) and her gangland informant Winston (Topher Grace) to court so the latter can testify against some hardline criminals. However, when Booth is revealed to be a hitman, sent by said criminals, to kill Winston, things get decidedly hairy mid-flight. One to arguably wait for, whenever it *ahem* lands on a streaming service near you.\n\nA Real Pain\n\nRelease date: October 18 (US); December 26 (Australia); January 10, 2025 (UK)\n\nJesse Eisenberg (The Social Network, Batman v Superman) and Kieran Culkin (Scott Pilgrim vs the World, Succession) team up in this Eisenberg-directed comedy-drama that drew plenty of praise the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. In it, the pair play mismatched cousins who reunite to embark on an awkward tour of Poland in honor of their recently deceased grandmother.\n\nUnfortunately for UK and Australian viewers, A Real Pain will arrive after it debuts in the US, so those of us who don't live stateside have got a lengthy wait on our hands.\n\nSmile 2\n\nRelease date: October 18 (worldwide)\n\nTwo years after Smile (one of the best Paramount Plus movies) made horror fans sit up and take notice, and less just 18 months after Smile 2 was first announced, the bloody and somewhat terrifying sequel will make you think twice about, well, smiling any time soon .\n\nNaomi Scott will play fictional pop sensation Skye Riley, who becomes the next potential victim of the smile-based curse when Kyle Gallner's Joel, who appeared Joel in the original, passes on said monstrous malison. Lukas Gage and Rosemarie DeWitt also star in a film written and directed by Parker Finn, who performed similar duties on the first movie.\n\nVenom: The Last Dance\n\nRelease date: October 24 (Australia); October 25 (US and UK)\n\nTom Hardy will bid farewell to Eddie Brock and his symbiote buddy Venom in Venom: The Last Dance, the final entry in the Marvel anti-hero's movie trilogy. Given what was shown off in Venom 3's lengthy first trailer, it might up being as chaotically messy as the previous two films, too. Still, at least it'll give the internet a new, not-so-adorable animal character to fall in love with in the form of Venom Horse.\n\nFollowing on from their brief soiree in MCU flick Spider-Man: No Way Home, The Last Dance will see Brock and Venom going on the run as humans and aliens alike hunt the pair for differing reasons. Doctor Strange's Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ted Lasso's Juno Temple, House of the Dragon's Rhys Ifans, and Boiling Point's Stephen Graham are among its starry supporting cast.\n\nTerrifier 3\n\nRelease date: October 25 (worldwide)\n\nA Christmas-set slasher that'll make its way into theaters in time for Halloween, Terrifier 3 will be the latest inexpensive horror movie in Dan Leone's slowly expanding cinematic franchise.\n\nArt the Clown, the horrifying antagonist from the last two films, will return to slice 'n' dice a new group of individuals at the so-called most wonderful time of the year. David Howard Thornton will reprise his role as the blood-thirsty circus-themed murderer, and he'll be joined by Lauren LaVera, Samantha Saffidi, Elliot Fulham, and Chris Jericho as part of the cast. Terrifier 2 was received far better than its predecessor, so let's hope the threequel continues this series' upward trajectory.\n\nNew movies: November 2024\n\nPaddington in Peru\n\nRelease date: November 8 (UK), January 1, 2025 (Australia) January 17, 2025 (US)\n\nThe first two Paddington movies are some of the best family movies we've seen in a long, long time. The debuting of the third movie's trailer and confirmation of its release dates (sorry, US and Australia, you've got a longer than expected wait on your hands), then, has been met with celebratory marmalade sandwiches among the movie series' global fanbase.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Paddington In Peru sees the titular bear return to his homeland – with the Brown family in tow – to visit in Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton). However, upon arriving in the South American nation, the group learn that Lucy has gone missing in the Peruvian jungle. Cue a riotously fun quest to find out where she's disappeared to.\n\nConclave\n\nRelease date: November 8 (US); November 29 (UK); January 9, 2025 (Australia)\n\nFrom Edward Berger, director of Netflix's harrowing war flick All Quiet on the Western Front, this religious conspiracy thriller – based on Robert Harris' book of the same name – sees Ralph Fiennes play Cardinal Lawrence, who leads the Catholic Church's search for a new Pope when the current incumbent dies. The covert process is made all the more difficult, however, by a power struggle within the Vatican, as well as an unsettling discovery Cardinal Lawrence makes.\n\nWith a strong supporting cast including Isabella Rossellini, John Lithgow, and Stanley Tucci among its ranks, Conclave may be one of November's new movies to watch around Thanksgiving weekend (in the US, anyway).\n\nRed One\n\nRelease date: November 14 (Australia); November 15 (US and UK)\n\nDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson knows a thing or two about starring in bang-average movies that perform extremely well at the box office and/or on streaming platforms. His latest venture, Red One, seems as if it'll fall right into that category, too.\n\nThe forthcoming festive feature stars Johnson as the North Pole's Head of Security Callum Drift. But, when Santa Clause (J.K. Simmons) is kidnapped on the eve of, well, Christmas Eve, Drift reluctantly teams up with the world's best bounty hunter Jack O'Malley (Captain America alum Chris Evans) to rescue Santa and save Christmas. A festive action movie whose trailer suggests it won't be a wonderful Christmas time.\n\nGladiator II\n\nRelease date: November 14 (Australia); November 15 (UK); November 22 (US)\n\nPrepare to be entertained all over again, film fans, as Gladiator II will finally fight its way into theaters in mid- to late November. Set years after Emperor Commodus was slain by Maximus in the 2000 multi-award-winning original, it'll follow Paul Mescal's Lucius, Commodus' nephew, as he's forced to end his Rome-based exile when he's forced to follow in Maximus' footsteps and enter the Colosseum to earn his freedom. Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, Joe Quinn, and Connie Nielsen are among its extraordinarily talented cast.\n\nGladiator II's epic first trailer epic showed Paul Mescal fighting a rhino in the Colosseum, among other tantalizing glimpses at Ridley Scott's latest feature. It's certainly whet our appetite for another trip back in time later this year – and, between you and us, we hope it has a happier ending that its forebear.\n\nWicked Part One\n\nRelease date: November 22 (US and UK); November 28 (Australia)\n\nWicked, the world-famous musical that's based on the legendary tale, characters, and world of The Wizard of Oz, is getting a magical silver screen glow-up. In fact, the John M. Chu-directed project will get two installments – Wicked Part One is out in time for Thanksgiving (in the US) this year, with its follow-up releasing one year later.\n\nFor the uninitiated: Wicked tells the untold story of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), the eventual Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande), who aids The Wizard of Oz's Dorothy on her quest through The Land of Oz years later. Part One will explore the duo's unlikely friendship as students of Shiz University and the eventual breakdown in that relationship. Jeff Goldblum will play the Wizard of Oz, while Michelle Yeoh, Peter Dinklage, Jonathan Bailey, and Marissa Bode are among its other notable supporting cast members.\n\nWicked Part One's first whirlwind trailer arrived in February, with its official trailer (see above) launching in May. Our advice? Don't watch the latter if you don't want most of its plot ruined for you pre-release...\n\nMoana 2\n\nRelease date: November 27 (US); November 28 (Australia); November 29 (UK)\n\nThe sequel to 2016's hit animated movie Moana sets sail in time for Thanksgiving 2024 (in the US, anyway). In it, the titular hero and her demigod buddy Maui reunite after three years to embark on a new voyage – one centered on an unexpected call from Moana's ancestors – across the ocean for, according to Disney, \"an adventure unlike anything she's experienced before\".\n\nAuli‘i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson reprise their roles from Moana 2's predecessor, while Grammy winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, Grammy nominee Opetaia Foaʻi, and three-time Grammy winner Mark Mancina have penned the soundtrack – the trio replacing Lin Manuel Miranda as songwriter-in-chief.\n\nNew movies: December 2024\n\nKraven the Hunter\n\nRelease date: December 12 (Australia); December 13 (US and UK)\n\nSony continues to dive into Spider-Man's rogues’ gallery with their second 2024-based effort to expand the SSU (Sony’s Spider-Man Universe), which is simultaneously separate from, and tenuously connected to, the MCU.\n\nIn the '60s, Kraven the Hunter was an original member of Marvel’s Sinister Six and discussed as a potential big-screen foe for Peter Parker. Now, he’s following in the footsteps of fellow anti-heroes Venom and Morbius by headlining his own movie. And, just like his villainous contemporaries, Kraven's first solo live-action adventure doesn't look all that appealing, even though its official trailer suggests it might be worth seeing to some people.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson (Avengers: Age of Ultron, Kick-Ass) plays the titular hunter and Ariana DeBose (Wish, Argylle) will play long-term Kraven associate Calypso. The Many Saints of Newark’s Alessandro Nivola takes on lead villain duties as Rhino, while Russell Crowe is also on hand to play Kraven's emotionally cold father.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King\n\nRelease date: December 20 (worldwide)\n\nA prequel to 2019's The Lion King \"live-action\" remake, Mufasa will see Rafiki recount the story of Simba's father (the titular character, for the uninitiated) to Simba's daughter Kiara, with a little embellishment-based humor from Timon and Pumba.\n\nAaron Pierre takes over from James Earl Jones on voice acting duties as a younger version of Mufasa, with the big game feline's own film revealing how he came to be King of Pride Rock. It'll also explore his initially strong bond with his brother Scar (he'll be known as Taka in this movie) before the pair's relationship becomes irreparable for reasons yet to be revealed.\n\nMufasa's first trailer brought thrills and chills upon release in late April, although plenty of people suggest it looks like nothing more than a high tech demo for lifelike visuals. Its second trailer, which debuted at D23 Expo 2024 in mid-August, did little to change our opinion, too. Still, we'll see if it has substance to go with its style before 2024 ends.\n\nNosferatu\n\nRelease date: December 25 (US); January 1, 2025 (Australia); January 3, 2025 (UK)\n\nAn unusual time of year for a gothic horror film, but Christmas Day will be the first time that viewers (in the US, anyway) will likely be terrified by director Robert Egger's reimagining of Bram Stoker's Dracula novel.\n\nNosferatu stars Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter, a young woman who the vampiric Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgard) becomes infatuated with. As Orlok's obsession grows ever stronger, he begins to leave untold horrors in his wake, leading Hutter and her husband Thomas (Nicholas Hoult) to seek the aid of any and all scientists, bounty hunters, and other individuals who'll stop the terrifying supernatural blood-sucker from tracking her down. Expect this one to be a big hit before 2024 ends."
