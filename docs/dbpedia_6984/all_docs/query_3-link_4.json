        "text": "After first being “converted to the religion of cinema” by evangelicals screening Martin Scorsese’s “The Last Temptation of Christ” in his native Ghana, Bazawule’s 2018 debut, “The Burial of Kojo,” garnered him immediate praise; by 2020, he had directed episodes of Ava DuVernay’s series “Cherish the Day,” Beyoncé’s feature-length album video “Black Is King,” and was hired to direct the musical adaptation of Alice’s Walker’s classic “The Color Purple.” He admits that the prospect of tackling the iconic property was daunting at first.\n\n“When you get the opportunity to even pitch for it, the first question becomes, ‘What are you possibly going to add to this canon?’ That was my first biggest piece of anxiety,” says Bazawule.\n\nHe turned to Walker’s novel for inspiration. “I started looking for something that may have not been explored as much,” he recalls, “and I found it on the first page. When she says, ‘Dear God, I’m 14 years old,’ I realized that there was an opportunity in Celie’s headspace, because anyone who could write letters to God has an imagination.”\n\nHis biggest priority became figuring out how to lean into that imagination. “How do I give the audience an insight into how Celie overcame her trauma by going through her healing journey?” he asked. But before Bazawule could start answering that question, the pandemic shut things down. “We were going to shoot about three months after greenlight, but it was just not plausible because of COVID,” he says.\n\nAccording to the filmmaker, the delay was a blessing in disguise. “I really had time to really home in on who I wanted, the locations I needed, the team I needed to create with,” he says. “Being prepared is the most critical part of the job.”\n\n— Paula Hendrickson\n\nReps: Agent: CAA; Management: M88; Legal: Granderson Des Rochers\n\nInfluences: Mikhail Kalatozov’s “SoyCuba,” Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” his grandmother\n\nA complex drama that compellingly assays issues of race, class, age and shifting power dynamics, “The Teachers’ Lounge” picked up two honors after its world premiere at Berlinale 2023, and then swept the top three prizes (plus an actress trophy for Leonie Benesch) at the German Film Awards.\n\nThe trajectory of awards recognition for his film, now Germany’s Oscar entry, has opened a whole set of new doors, admits co-writer and director Çatak. “My next project got financed much, much quicker,” he says.\n\nLike one of his films’ characters, a sense of curiosity and cautious optimism informs Çatak’s new reality. “I’m trying to keep my cool and not get carried away,” Çatak says. “Success is great, but at the same time it creates expectations and more pressure.”\n\nA diverse, international roster of formative cinematic influences as well as a keen sense of the complexities of social identity (he was born in Berlin to Turkish parents), informed Çatak’s love of films that interrogate the unusual intersections of shared social spaces — asking questions rather than providing pat answers.\n\nThat sense of inquisitiveness certainly describes “The Teachers’ Lounge,” which tells the story of an idealistic educator who, after a series of petty thefts at her school, tries to mediate between outraged parents, colleagues and students, only to find herself besieged on all sides.\n\nNext up is “Yellow Letters,” starring Tansu Biçer and Gizem Erdem, which Çatak describes as a personal story about modern-day Turkey, told through the lens of two artists who lose their jobs. Everyday struggles eventually give way, he says, to “a point where they’re faced with a sell-off of their ideals, both as parents and as artists.”\n\n— Brent Simon\n\nReps: Agency: UTA; Management: Black Bear; Legal: Gang, Tyre, Ramer, Brown & Passman\n\nInfluences: Gus Van Sant, Steven Soderbergh, Christian Petzold, Nuri Bilge Ceylan\n\nWith three features under her belt, the first of which (“Family First”) was selected as Canada’s 2018 Oscar submission for international film, writer-director Dupuis hasn’t let the pressure of critical acclaim get to her. “If I think about that [while] making my film, it’s gonna be not essential interference in my head,” says Dupuis. “I don’t see the importance of giving attention to that.”\n\nIt was Dupuis’ well-researched fascination with toxic relationships that led her to “Solo,” a love story about a drag artist (Théodore Pellerin) whose light is dimmed after he begins dating a fellow performer (Félix Maritaud), just as his estranged mother (Anne-Marie Cadieux) arrives in town. “When I was a teenager, I was thinking about becoming a psychologist,” she says. “I did therapy for myself, but also to get to know everything about human psychology.”\n\nDupuis was passionate about setting this character-driven story in the drag world, which gave its fantasy elements a visually arresting vibrancy. “I like to make natural, realistic movies, but on the stage, I wanted to glamourize this form of art.” She continues: “They’re making humor for queer people, and they’re making some- thing important for the community. The message behind the art, we need that in our society right now — getting the drama out of that question about gender, just living and having fun.”\n\nDedicated to growing in her craft, Dupuis says her priority in life is filmmaking. “It’s what brings me more joy in life than anything I’ve ever experienced. I haven’t found that beauty and joy anywhere else yet.”\n\nThe Quebecois talent lives by the advice she often gives to the cinema students who see her films: “Give the opportunity to your audience to see the world through your eyes for an hour and a half. If you’re thinking too much or changing to please people, you’re not giving them this experience.”\n\n— Courtney Howard\n\nReps: Management: Black Bear\n\nInfluences: Justin Kurzel, Baz Luhrman, Robin Campillo (for 120 BPM), Sean Baker and Martin Scorsese\n\nJefferson is earning widespread praise and awards consideration for his directorial debut, “American Fiction,” but he didn’t even allow himself to think about being a director until he was in his mid-30s. After leaving his journalism career to become a TV writer, Jefferson was working on Season 2 of Aziz Ansari’s Netflix series “Master of None” when Ansari asked him if he’d ever considered directing. “I said, ‘No, I haven’t been to film school, I don’t know anything like cameras or lighting,’” Jefferson says. “And he was like, ‘Well, I didn’t go to film school, and I directed these episodes.’”\n\nThat planted the seed, and as Jefferson’s writing career took off with his work on “The Good Place,” “Succession” and his Emmy-winning stint on the 2019 miniseries “Watchmen,” he says he started looking for a project that would give him the courage to jump into the director’s chair.\n\nHe found it with Percival Everett’s 2001 novel “Erasure,” about English professor Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, who’s stymied by the publishing world only valuing Black stories about poverty and crime, and protests by writing a satire called “My Pafology.”\n\n“I finally felt like I had found a story that I knew on a molecular level,” he says. “That’s what gave me the confidence to say, ‘Even if I don’t know anything about the lighting or the cameras, I know the story that I’m trying to tell and the characters that I’m trying to manifest.’”\n\nJefferson maintained that perspective throughout the production of “American Fiction,” telling his cast — including Jeffrey Wright, Sterling K. Brown and Erika Alexander — and his crew from the outset that he would be leaning on them for support.\n\n“The people on set who didn’t have experience were me and the PAs,” he says. “I was surrounded by people who not who not only were tolerating my inexperience but were excited to help this person learn to become a better filmmaker.”\n\n— Adam B. Vary\n\nReps: Agency: CAA; Management: 3 Arts; Legal: Ziffren Brittenham\n\nInfluences: “Hollywood Shuffle,” Mike Schur, Damon Lindelof\n\nAn internationally celebrated artist, Kaphar didn’t set out to be a filmmaker. “I’m an imagemaker and storyteller, and the film evolved from initially writing down some of my memories,” Kaphar says. “It’s a way to tell a story that could help my children understand my experience and experiences like mine.” His semi-autobiographical debut, “Exhibiting Forgiveness,” was selected for the 2024 Sundance Film Festival’s U.S. Dramatic competition.\n\nThe film, about a Black painter who grapples with complicated familial relationships when his recovering addict father pays him a visit, forced him to look inward. “On the page, it’s easy to be vulnerable. But now I’m in a situation where it’s not private anymore,” says Kaphar. “My family’s life is implicated in my story.” He says he hoped to tell his, and his father’s, stories honestly.\n\n“It was never my desire to turn him into a villain,” he insists. “I’m showing his humanity and the challenges that he went through and how our lives collided. Not every scene is directly from life, but there is an emotional truth to every single second of this film.”\n\nKaphar is excited at the prospect of “Exhibiting Forgiveness” reaching an audience. “It has been my experience that the more successful I am in the art world, the more distance there is between me and the community I came from,” he says. “My community will be able to engage with this story in a way that they couldn’t with some of my work in the art world.”\n\nDespite his debut’s deeply personal origins, Kaphar credits his actors (André Holland, Andra Day, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and John Earl Jelks) and producers (Stephanie Allain, Derek Cianfrance, Jamie Patricof and Sean Cotton) for making “Forgiveness” possible. “Don’t pat me on the back,” he says.\n\n— Murtada Elfadl\n\nReps: Agency: UTA; Legal: Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox\n\nInfluences: Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, Spike Lee, Derek Cianfrance\n\nKendrick has long dreamed of directing — not that she’d said that out loud to anyone else or fully admitted it to herself.\n\n“I felt too vulnerable to ever really say that it was something that I wanted, because then I’d have to feel the impact of, ‘What if I never get the opportunity?’” Kendrick tells Variety.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actor (and one of Variety’s 2007 10 Actors to Watch) had been attached for nearly two years to “Woman of the Hour” — a ripped-from-the-headlines drama about a serial killer who appeared on “The Dating Game” — when the original director departed the project. Less than six weeks before the movie went into pre-production, she offered to take the reins.\n\n“I didn’t have time to think about what a disaster it could be,” she says, thinking back on the whirlwind 24-day shoot. Instead of a disaster, the film prompted a bidding war after its Toronto Intl. Film Festival premiere, which Netflix won in an approximately $11 million deal. Of course, there were challenges, like clomping up the bleachers in ’70s era platform heels to check the monitor in between takes of a 25-page scene. But swapping from actor to director mode didn’t prove to be as difficult as people warned her it could be.\n\n“Me and the lead of the film were always on the same page,” Kendrick jokes. “It was one less thing I had to manage.”\n\nNow that her debut has been deemed a success, Kendrick aims to continue directing and she’s keeping her options open.\n\n“I’ve been offered some other genre-type films and it always comes with this caveat, like ‘We totally understand if you don’t want to pigeonhole yourself,’” she says. “I’ve been known as the a cappella comedy girl for 10 years. I’m not worried.”\n\n— Angelique Jackson\n\nReps: Agency: CAA; Management: Range Media Partners; Legal: Yorn Levine Barnes Krintzman Rubenstein Kohner Endlich & Gellman\n\nInfluences: Ingmar Bergman, George Cukor, Sarah Polley\n\nThough the title immediately lends itself to explosive, multidimensional worldbuilding, Libii didn’t originally conceive “The American Society of Magical Negroes” as a feature. “I assumed it was going to be probably a two-and-a-half-minute sketch,” says Libii. “[But] I came up for air after working on it for way too long and it felt like I was writing something about something bigger.”\n\nLess an indictment of the narrative trope coined by Spike Lee than a pathway for the Fort Wayne, Ind., native to examine the defense mechanisms he’d been taught for responding to racism and white supremacy, “Magical Negroes” evidences Libii’s organic transition to directing after studying theater and improv comedy at Yale and Chicago’s Second City. “There were stories that I wanted that weren’t being told,” he recalls. Even so, he bristles at shouldering responsibility for capturing the full breadth of the lives of American people of color.\n\n“My hope would be that we’re moving toward a world where we can all be telling stories that reflect us personally, but not necessarily every person that has everything in common with us.”\n\nLibii emphasizes he’s interested in stories about what enables people to grow. “To be better than they were the day before,” he says. “I find it terrifically hard — and also really inspiring — when people can actually do it.” As with “Magical Negroes,” he embraces the opportunity to have fun while exploring challenging ideas. “I always want to find something really unvarnished and honest and profound to me,” Libii explains. “I have a comedy background, so shame and embarrassment are things we like as funny people.\n\n“So if I have that feeling that I’ve said too much or I’ve given too much away, I often chase that thing, because there’s often something there that is really true and transgressive.”\n\n— Todd Gilchrist\n\nReps: Agency: UTA; Management: Ames Hashagen Entertainment; Legal: Schreck, Rose, Dapello, Adams, Berlin & Dunham\n\nInfluences: Spike Lee, Spike Jones, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet\n\nNow on his third film, “A Different Man,” writer-director Schimberg says he always wanted to be a filmmaker. “I never had any ambition outside of that,” Schimberg admits. Though he’s now grateful for his education at USC Film School, it was a path to directing he hadn’t envisioned for himself. “I didn’t take to it because I was naive about how the industry works,” he says. “I just wanted to deny the existence of this giant machine controlling the art that I loved.”\n\nThat outsider’s perspective also shaped his upcoming psychological drama about a disfigured man (Sebastian Stan) reckoning with the aftermath of facial reconstructive surgery. Schimberg explains, “I was thinking about the broad psychological cliche that the way we judge others is a reflection or a manifestation of the way we feel about ourselves, so I just literalized that.”\n\nWhat emerges from the premise is an increasingly complex meditation on identity, revolving around characters that Schimberg tries not to know too much about.\n\n“I deliberately shield myself from knowing these things so that their actions and their words and their deeds can just unfold,” he says.\n\nDespite that deliberate detachment, Schimberg says that each project is all-consuming as he makes it. “I am walking around with one idea, and then that idea overtakes my life,” he says. That said, he’s unsure yet how cathartic the process can be of translating that idea to the screen. “I do think of films as therapy. On the other hand, the process of making a film can be so traumatic that I don’t know if it’s actually useful,” he jokes.\n\n“So it’s sort of an endless cycle in that sense, but maybe after 10 films I’ll feel that I’ve finally healed myself.”\n\n— Todd Gilchrist\n\nR e p s : Agency: CAA; Legal: Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher\n\nInfluences: Luis Buñuel, the Marx brothers, Ernst Lubitsch, Samuel Fuller\n\nSendijarević was born in a small town in Bosnia, but her family fled the country when war broke out, moving to the Netherlands when she was 7 years old. The writer-director’s memories of that tricky adjustment — including taunts from Dutch kids to “go back to your own country” — informed her 2016 short, “Import.”\n\n“There was a lot of absurdity there,” says the writer-director, whose work finds humor in the most unexpected places. That’s the case with her wickedly funny second feature, “Sweet Dreams,” a surrealist period satire set on a sugar plantation in the Dutch East Indies. Selected to represent the Netherlands at the Academy Awards, the movie questions the country’s colonialist past.\n\n“I’ve been living in Amsterdam since I was 17, and I wanted to understand a bit more about this country and how it relates to the rest of the world,” Sendijarević explains.\n\n“Sweet Dreams” also sticks it to the patriarchy, as when the old white guy running the operation suffers a heart attack early on. His wife does not react as most audiences would expect, and from that point forward, it’s the dreams of the female characters — one his widow, the other his mistress — that power a film full of subversive choices.\n\n“I try to write in images, and that’s when the most interesting scenes come forward,” Sendijarević says. “There was even a version where the size of people would change.”\n\nShe graduated from the Netherlands Film Academy, where students were pushed toward social realism. But her sensibility swung hard in the opposite direction, tickled by the playfulness of the Czech New Wave and Yugoslav Black Wave in particular.\n\n“Those films were an entrance to me to make my own style, as well as to use a certain kind of humor,” says Sendijarević, who’s now developing an English-language film — this one set in a desolate natural location.\n\n— Peter Debruge\n\nReps: no agent, manager or lawyer\n\nInfluences: Juraj Herz’s “The Cremator.” “All Godard’s films are very political, but extremely playful.”\n\nTrobisch was only 6 years old when the Berlin Wall came down. “It changed everything,” the East Berlin native recalls, “but I couldn’t understand why everyone was so excited.” Today the writer-director and former teen actor analyzes more intimately transformative events, such as those in her prize-winning 2018 feature debut, “All Is Well,” about a woman coping with a sexual assault, and her upcoming Berlinale world premiere, “Ivo,” the story of a palliative care worker in a love triangle with her patient’s husband.\n\nThe documentary-style drama is partly based on a true story about people she knows, performed by professional and non-professional actors. “When I think about my next project, the starting point [is usually] a question that I don’t have an answer for,” she says.\n\nBoth films show the influence of her early role model, John Cassavetes, with his “vivid, naturalistic, character-driven approach.” Trobisch will move away from female protagonists with her next film, tentatively titled “Something Quite Special (Etwas Ganz Besonderes),” which begins shooting in March. The film focuses on the family members of a girl preparing for a televised singing competition. Several of Trobisch’s family members worked in theater, including her director grandfather and dramaturge mother.\n\n“I’m a total family person, so I’ve worked with my production company TRIMAFILM [partnering with Studio Zentral on ‘Ivo’] for years now. I’ve done every film with them and will continue that,” says Trobisch, who lives in Berlin with her partner and nine-year-old son.\n\nAfter her debut, she was frustrated when she was only offered films about women and violence against them. “I’m very interested in the [whether or not] we can choose who we want to be, how we’re connected with our social backgrounds and how much we can change completely.”\n\n— Gregg Goldstein\n\nRep: Agent: Kristina Müller-Stöfen\n\nInfluences: John Cassavetes, Robert Altman, Agnès Verda"
