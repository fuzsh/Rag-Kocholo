        "text": "From Michelangelo Antonioni’s eerie L'Avventura to Luchino Visconti’s lush Death in Venice, these are our favorite Italian-set films. For more Travel via Cinema destinations, click here.\n\nCall Me by Your Name, 2017\n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\nPerhaps the most unintended result of Call Me by Your Name was the wave of tourism to Crema, Italy. After seeing Guadagnino’s final piece of his Desire trilogy, the public made a mad dash to the tiny Italian town, inspired by the luxuriously languorous summer days spent by the stars of the film, Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer. The love story follows two men, each a type of devastating handsome, as they pass the hours biking around town, padding around the family terrazzo-floored villa, or reclining by the pool. It's the summer romance everyone wishes they had.\n\nContempt, 1963\n\nJean-Luc Godard\n\nIn Jean-Luc Godard’s New Wave drama, a French playwright Paul (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) are sent to Rome to work on a film adaptation of Homer’s The Odyssey, which is funded by a swashbuckling American producer (Jack Palance). The couple incessantly argues their way to Capri, where even their accommodations—the awe-inspiring, architectural masterpiece that is Casa Malaparte—doesn’t quell the quarreling. No matter, the film offers plenty to look at.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nEnchanted April, 1991\n\nMike Newell\n\n\"Based on the 1922 novel, this film follows four women who trade dreary London for a sun-drenched holiday in Portofino, Itay. They spend their blissful days in a medieval castle (Castello Brown, where the author of the book originally stayed), take dips in the Mediterranean sea, and rediscover all the delicious pleasures that life has to offer.\"\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nGladiator, 2000\n\nRidley Scott\n\nIl Postino: The Postman, 1994\n\nMassimo Troisi, Michael Radford\n\nIn this fictional story of the real-life Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret), Neruda has been exiled from his country and sent to live on the tiny Italian island of Procida in the Gulf of Naples. He forms a friendship with a postman named Mario (Massimo Troisi), who becomes a student and learns the art of poetry to seduce a beautiful local named Beatrice. Throughout, Procida reveals its rustic beauty.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nSearching for love and happiness in all the wrong places, a journalist named Marcello (played by Fellini-favorite Marcello Mastroianni) finds himself soaking up the sweet life of Roman cafe society in Federico Fellini’s cinematic masterpiece. Follow Marcello through his whirlwind romps about the ancient aqueducts, Saint Peter’s Square, the Baths of Caracalla, the nightclubs of Via Veneto, and, of course, the Trevi Fountain, where a ballgowned Anita Ekberg famously indulges in a night swim.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing, 1993\n\nKenneth Branagh\n\nShakespeare’s classic tale comes to life in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of conspiring young lovers Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) who attempt to play matchmaker to confirmed singles Beatrice (Emma Thompson) and Benedick (Kenneth Branagh). A double wedding is had at the picturesque Villa Vignamaggio in the Chianti region of Tuscany in Italy, and the couples live happily ever after.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nOcean’s Twelve, 2004\n\nSteven Soderbergh\n\nThe sequel to 2001’s Oceans 11 finds Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew back in Las Vegas, as well as Amsterdam, Paris, Monte Carlo, Rome, Castellammare del Golfo in Sicily, and of course, Lake Como, filmed at Clooney’s actual home, Villa Oleandra, in Laglio.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nRoom With a View, 1985\n\nJames Ivory\n\nAdapted from E.M. Forster’s novel of the same name, the British film stars Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy, a young girl growing up in conservative Edwardian England, who holidays in Florence with her spinster chaperone (Maggie Smith). It is there that she meets George (Julian Sands) who graciously offers to exchange hotel rooms so that she might have a view of Duomo and Arno. Romance ensues as the two find themselves alone in the cobblestone streets of the Piazza della Signoria and Fiesole in Tuscany before returning home to Surrey, England.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nStealing Beauty, 1996\n\nBernardo Bertolucci\n\nSet on the stunning estate of Castello di Brolio, in the rolling Tuscan hills near Siena, Bernardo Bertolucci’s coming of age romantic drama stars a young American, played by Liv Tyler, who spends summer with the colorful friends of her late mother, an avant-garde poet.\n\nThe Big Blue, 1988\n\nLuc Besson\n\nBesson’s fictionalized story of real-life free divers Jacques Mayol (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo Maiorca (Jean Reno) starts from their childhood in Greece to their deaths in an ’80s competition in Sicily. The film is a cult-favorite in France, and needless to say, it provides ample footage of beautiful blue waters.\"\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Godfather, 1972\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola\n\nIn the first of Francis Ford Coppola’s trilogy, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), a college-educated and decorated war hero, becomes entangled in the family business. To let the dust of his decision settle, he flees New York to Sicily and travels the bucolic Italian countryside to the town of Corleone in Palermo. It’s there that Michael first locks eyes with Apollonia, among the fields of oleanders, and then marries her in a traditional wedding ceremony at the local Church of San Nicolò in Savoca. The wedding is followed by a traditional Catholic procession through the medieval streets of the village of Forza d’Agro near Taormina.\n\nThe Italian Job, 1969\n\nPeter Collinson\n\nIn a film that captured the swagger of the swinging ’60s, Michael Caine plays a Cockney crook who leads a heist in Turin that required the use of three Mini Coopers. The trio of little striped cars famously maneuvered through the beautiful baroque staircase of the Palazzo Madama, a wedding on the steps of the Chiesa della Gran Madre di Dio, onto the roof of a Fiat factory race track in Lingotto, through the River Po, and eventually out through the underground sewers. Turin is on full display in this version, while the 2003 remake—starring Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron—utilizes Venice.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Leopard, 1963\n\nLuchino Visconti\n\nLuchino Visconti’s epic period drama is based on Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel of the same name, which chronicled the unification of modern Italy during the Risorgimento period in the 19th century. Set in Sicily, the story centers on Prince Don Fabrizio of Salina (played by Burt Lancaster) along with his young nephew Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon) and his beautiful wife Angelica Sedara Bertiana (Claudia Cardinale). Filmed in medieval villages surrounding Palermo—including the sumptuous ballroom of the Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi in the Piazza Croce dei Vespri—the film offers a gilded glimpse into the fading world of of the Sicilian aristocracy.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Star Maker, 1995\n\nGiuseppe Tornatore\n\nThe Star Maker is a film about making films. Set in rural Sicily in the ’50s, the movie follows Joe Moretti as he scouts the streets for potential stars for Roman studios. And because this is Italy, of course, love finds its way to him.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley, 1999\n\nAnthony Minghella\n\nThe Trip to Italy, 2014\n\nMichael Winterbottom\n\nAfter the success of Michael Winterbottom’s 2010 British comedy TV series, The Trip, starring English comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as fictionalized characters of themselves, comes The Trip to Italy: a tale of two men enjoying six scenic meals in Italy from Piedmont to Capri, stopping in Liguria, Tuscany, Rome, and Amalfi.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThree Coins in the Fountain, 1954\n\nJean Negulesco\n\nThree American secretaries (played by Maggie McNamara, Jean Peters, and Dorothy McGuire)—single and dreaming of everlasting love—visit the Trevi Fountain; three coins are tossed in a fountain; three strapping men (played by Louis Jourdan, Rossano Brazzi, and Clifton Webb) enter the picture. All the while, lovely Rome sets the scene. Credits roll.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nUnder the Tuscan Sun, 2003\n\nAudrey Wells\n\nAfter learning her husband has been unfaithful, the newly divorced American writer Frances (Diane Lane), takes a trip to Tuscany and buys a dilapidated villa in Cortona on a whim. Her heart and new home are restored with the help of heaps of pasta, glasses of Montepulciano wine, flamboyant Italian friends, and an affair with the limoncello-making, Vespa-driving Marcello. Everything’s better under the Tuscan sun.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission."
