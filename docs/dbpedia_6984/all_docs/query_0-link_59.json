        "text": "“Mr Pacino – leave your trailer and advance to the set, at the double!” Army veterans are being retrained as location managers by the British film industry to keep big-budget movies running with military precision.\n\nFormer Armed Forces personnel are being offered the chance to become location managers by ScreenSkills, the industry-led training body for the UK’s screen industries.\n\nThe logistical and reconnaissance abilities employed by soldiers in war zones are highly transferable to film sets, where large numbers of extras, actors and production staff must be corralled to work to tight shooting schedules.\n\nWar movie 1917 set for Bafta glory\n\nThe military incursion into Hollywood comes as 1917, Sir Sam Mendes’ World War One epic following the journey of two young soldiers, is tipped to sweep the board at Sunday’s Bafta awards.\n\nMany roles in the military – such as medics, drivers and cooks – have a direct equivalent in the screen industry.\n\nCombat experience is also a help managing the film world’s more fragile egos.\n\n“The Armed Forces are built on order and discipline which is exactly what is needed when you are filming,” said Gareth Ellis-Unwin, ScreenSkills’ head of film and animation, who produced the 2014 film Kajaki, which told the story of a rescue mission to save soldiers injured by explosions in Afghanistan in 2006.\n\nForty veterans, who must be within two years of leaving the services, attended a movie “bootcamp”, to get a grounding in behind-the-camera roles.\n\n‘film set like combat zone’\n\nThe final eight chosen for the training course, run by the National Film and Television School, include Steven Price Brown, who served in the Grenadier Guards in Helmand, Afghanistan.\n\nBrown said: “It’s quite similar to being an infantry soldier. You have to get the job done, with no excuses.”\n\n“You’ve got to be an efficient problem solver, get people into position, move vehicles around and finish at an exact time and date. Of course, there’s going to be egos in any creative business.”\n\nThe location manager role involves logistical tasks such as finding and securing locations and securing safety or police permits.\n\nMr Brown, 51, has already found himself shooting the breeze with actors and directors. “I get an early look at the scripts so I’ll ask the director how he wants to shoot the scenes.”\n\nSoldiers advise directors\n\n“If there’s a combat element, I give the actors advice on how to stand with confidence and hold weapons.”\n\nLieutenant Colonel Richard Trant, MD of Services To Film, a veteran owned film extras and military advisor agency working with ScreenSkills, said: “Our aim is to create a sustainable pipeline for veterans into the industry – a win for the industry and a win for veterans keen to achieve second careers in film and television.”\n\nVeterans can rise to the top of movie business. Platoon director Oliver Stone served in the US Army infantry in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968. He was twice wounded in action and was awarded a Purple Heart."
