        "text": "\"But in the book they do have these very, very long songs – or they're presented as songs, they're poems.\n\n\"But they're so funny, and I was reading them sort of trying to get a voice in my head, and they're so sort of biting and sarcastic and scornful and incredibly funny, and Hugh's voice just kept coming towards me.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And it probably wasn't a huge leap from there to go, 'What would Hugh look like 18 inches high with orange skin and bright green hair?' And that seemed like a pretty funny thing that I'd like to see.\"\n\nThe musical fantasy film is also replete with a brilliant supporting cast, which features Olivia Colman, Sally Hawkins, Tom Davis, Keegan-Michael Key and more.\n\nBut who else stars in Wonka and who do they play? Read on to find out the full confirmed cast list.\n\nMore like this\n\nWonka 2023 cast: Full list of characters in Timothée Chalamet movie\n\nThe full cast list of Wonka is as follows:\n\nTimothée Chalamet as Young Willy Wonka\n\nCalah Lane as Noodle\n\nHugh Grant as Lofty\n\nPaterson Joseph as Arthur Slugworth\n\nOlivia Colman as Mrs Scrubbit\n\nTom Davis as Bleacher\n\nKeegan-Michael Key as The Chief of Police\n\nMathew Baynton as Fickelgruber\n\nMatt Lucas as Prodnose\n\nSally Hawkins as Willy's Mother\n\nRowan Atkinson as Father Julius\n\nEllie White as Gwennie (the Mistress of the Keys)\n\nJim Carter as Abacus Crunch\n\nSimon Farnaby as Bash\n\nNatasha Rothwell as Piper Benz\n\nRich Fulcher as Larry Chucklesworth\n\nTracy Ifeachor as Dorothy Smith\n\nRufus Jones as Jenkins\n\nRakhee Thakrar as Lottie Bell\n\nColin O’Brien as Young Willy Wonka\n\nFreya Parker as Miss Bon Bon\n\nMurray McArthur as Ship’s Captain\n\nJustin Edwards as a green-skinned customer\n\nKobna Holdbrook-Smith as Officer Affable\n\nJag Patel as Dancer\n\nRead on for more details about where you’ve seen the actors before as well as what characters they’re playing.\n\nTimothée Chalamet plays Willy Wonka\n\nWho is Willy Wonka? Willy Wonka is the protagonist of Wonka, and Timothée Chalamet stars as the titular character. It’s officially a prequel to the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Chalamet’s character is the young version of Gene Wilder’s character. In this film, we see his adventures before the opening of his infamous chocolate factory.\n\nWhat else has Timothée Chalamet been in? Chalamet is perhaps most well-known for his leading role performance as Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 adaptation of Dune. You’ll also recognise him from performances in The French Dispatch, Little Women, The King, Bones and All, A Rainy Day in New York, Beautiful Boy, Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, and more.\n\nHe has also been nominated for various awards, including Best Actor for Call Me By Your Name at the Academy Awards.\n\nOlivia Colman as Mrs Scrubbit\n\nWho is Mrs Scrubbit? A nasty Scrooge-like figure who Noodle works for. She and Bleacher offer Wonka a room at their hotel at the beginning of the film, only to trap him with a binding contract that forces him to work for them.\n\nSpeaking about what drew her to the film, Colman exclusively told RadioTimes.com: \"I wanted to work with [director] Paul King. I loved what he'd done with both Paddingtons, and I just think he's a lovely person.\"\n\n\"And it's so nice when you get on set and go, 'Hooray! He genuinely is as lovely as I'd hoped.' And very collaborative and kind and funny, and the first one to laugh at anything you do on set, which is a lovely feeling. And Wonka, I grew up with it. So I was really excited. And to pay a [Roald] Dahl baddie!\"\n\nWhat else has Olivia Colman been in? Colman has been in just about everything worth watching. From her early days in TV comedies Peep Show, Green Wing and That Mitchell and Webb Look, she’s moved on to become an Academy Award winner thanks to her performance as Queen Anne in 2018’s The Favourite.\n\nTom Davis as Bleacher\n\nWho is Bleacher? The co-owner of the Inn with Mrs. Scrubbit.\n\nSpeaking about what drew him to the role, Davis told RadioTimes.com: \"For me, working with Paul King again, having done Paddington [2] with him. And the journey of Paddington, going from what was I think one line to having this character arc, that was amazing to be a part of. So to get a call and say, 'This is his next project' and him and Simon [Farnaby] had written a part for me...\n\n\"And honestly, I’m like, 'OK, if it's a line I'll do it, whatever you want Paul', because I think Paul is just a generational talent. And he's like, 'It's Timothée Chalamet and all your stuff will be with Olivia'. I was like, 'Wow!' It's an amazing thing. Just a real pinch me moment, very humbling and an incredible thing.\"\n\nWhat else has Tom Davis been in? The actor and comedian is known for helping to create the semi-improvised TV series Murder in Successville. Wonka isn't Davis's first time working with director Paul King as he previously starred as T-Bone in Paddington 2. Other TV credits include The Curse, King Gary and Romesh and Tom Take Takeshi's Castle.\n\nRowan Atkinson as Father Julius\n\nWho is Father Julius? Father Julius is the local priest.\n\nWhat else has Rowan Atkinson been in? Mr Bean, Blackadder, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Not the Nine O’Clock News, Johnny English, The Thin Blue Line, Love Actually, Man vs Bee, Rat Race, Scooby-Doo. His face is about as recognisable as they come.\n\nPaterson Joseph as Arthur Slugworth\n\nWho is Arthur Slugworth? Arthur Slugworth is a major rival in the chocolate and confectionary world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nWhat else has Paterson Joseph been in? Perhaps most well-known for his performance as Alan Johnson in Peep Show, Paterson Joseph is something of a mainstay in British TV. Most recently, you will have seen him in Inside No. 9, Vigil, and Timeless.\n\nHugh Grant as Lofty\n\nWho is Lofty? Lofty is the original Oompa-Loompa, who came from a faraway land to aid Willy Wonka on his chocolate-making endeavours.\n\nWhat else has Hugh Grant been in? What hasn’t Hugh Grant been in? He shot to fame following his appearance in 1994’s Four Weddings and a Funeral - which earned him a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and has been a mainstay of romantic comedies ever since, including Notting Hill.\n\nYou will have seen Grant in About a Boy, Love Actually, Glass Onion, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Paddington 2, The Gentlemen, A Very English Scandal, Bridget Jones’s Diary, Sense and Sensibility, Maurice, and much, much more.\n\nSally Hawkins as Willy’s Mother\n\nWho is Willy’s Mother? Sally Hawkins is playing Willy Wonka’s mother in Wonka. She’s sure to play a large role in shaping Chalamet’s character throughout the film.\n\nWhat else has Sally Hawkins been in? Sally Hawkins is another in the cast who has made the leap across from Paul King’s work on the Paddington movies. She’s best known for her appearances in The Shape of Water, for which she was Academy Award-nominated for Best Actress, Made in Dagenham, and Happy-Go-Lucky.\n\nYou may well have seen her in Godzilla, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, Maudie, The Phantom of the Open, The Lost King, A Boy Called Christmas, and more.\n\nMathew Baynton as Fickelgruber\n\nWho is Fickelgruber?

A character who is easily corrupted by the Chocolate Cartel because of his sweet tooth. He gains a large amount of weight over the course of the film after doing Slugworth's dirty work in exchange for chocolate.\n\nWhat else has Keegan-Michael Key been in?
