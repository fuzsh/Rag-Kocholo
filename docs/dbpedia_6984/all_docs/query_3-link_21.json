        "text": "“And the BAFTA goes to…Oppenheimer” Those words were on BAFTA Film Awards ceremony presenters’ lips a total of seven times in London on Sunday at the ceremony, hosted by Scottish actor David Tennant (Doctor Who, Inside Man) at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall in the British capital.\n\nThose included the lips of Michael J. Fox, who unveiled the best film award for Oppenheimer after coming on stage to a huge welcome and standing ovation.\n\nThe wins for Oppenheimer included the best actor award for Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor nod for Robert Downey Jr., director award for Christopher Nolan and best film, for Nolan and other members of the film team. The two BAFTAs for Nolan mean that third time was the charm for the big-name British export who had previously never won a British Academy award.\n\nMeanwhile, Downey’s award came 31 years after he won a best actor BAFTA for the 1993 film Chaplin.\n\nOppenheimer had led the pack coming into the night with 13 nominations. However, the BAFTA record winner remains Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the 1969 film directed by George Roy Hill and starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, with nine BAFTAs.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos’ black-comedy science fantasy Poor Things, which had been nominated 11 times, also had a strong BAFTA evening, winning five of the famous BAFTA mask trophies, including one for Emma Stone as best actress. Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest was honored three times out of nine noms.\n\nBut Martin Scorsese’s Western crime drama Killers of the Flower Moon, which had also reached nine nods, ended up winless, as did Barbie and Maestro.\n\nGerman star Sandra Hüller also left without a trophy after having been nominated for The Zone of Interest in the best supporting actress category and as best leading actress for her role in Anatomy of a Fall. In the end, the best supporting actress trophy went to Da’Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers, while Stone was honored with the best actress BAFTA. The latter’s win in a very competitive field of nominees, which included Fantasia Barrino (The Color Purple) and Vivian Oparah (Rye Lane) means that BAFTA viewers continue to have to wait for the first-ever Black best actress winner.\n\nStone enchanted the crowd with an acceptance speech, in which she thanked her mother, for giving her life and being the best person she knows, and her dialect coach, for not laughing when he had to teach her how to say “water” the British rather than the American way, given that her character was British. “Thank you, England, for accepting me,” she added.\n\nShe also drew laughs when she thanked Poor Thing screenwriter Tony McNamara for the line “I must go punch that baby.” Said Stone: “It was life-changing for me.”\n\nDowney Jr. also had the BAFTA crowd in stitches with his acceptance speech that ran through several famous names he has encountered during his career. “When I was 15, I wanted to be Peter O’Toole,” he shared. “When I was 25, I worked for Richard Attenbourgh and Anthony Hopkins. When I was 35, I finally understood why Dickie thought Tony would be a better role model for me than Peter. He continued: “I then played a guy named Tony in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) for about 12 years. And then recently, that dude Chris Nolan suggested I attempt an understated approach as a last-ditch effort to perhaps resurrect my dwindling credibility.”\n\nAnother memorable moments of the night was the best animation film win for The Boy and The Heron from Japanese anime legend Hayao Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki. The winners weren’t in attendance though.\n\nBut actor-writer-director Samantha Morton, known for playing Alpha in The Walking Dead, was on hand to accept the BAFTA Fellowship, the organization’s highest honor, dedicating it to children in need.\n\nMeanwhile, several performances earned rave reviews. Singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor performed her 2001 smash hit “Murder on the Dancefloor,” featured in Emerald Fennell’s BAFTA-nominated film Saltburn, having the audience moving along to the beats in their seats.\n\nAnd two Ted Lasso stars brought very different moods to the stage. Nick Mohammed, known as the Richmond FC’s “wunderkind” Nate Shelley, performed a few minutes of comedy as Mr. Swallow, his alter ego from England’s Leeds – on roller skates. And Hannah Waddingham sang a very emotional and heartfelt rendition of “Time After Time,” adding a somber note to the proceedings.\n\nLast year, Netflix’s German antiwar epic All Quiet on the Western Front made good on its record number of BAFTA nominations with a haul of seven wins, including for best film, best director and best adapted screenplay.\n\nThe 77th BAFTA film awards ceremony kicked off late Sunday afternoon local time. BAFTA chair Sara Putt welcomed attendees by highlighting that BAFTA was working with a focus on “championing talent,” emphasizing that “we constantly work to remove barriers.” She also welcomed Prince William, the Prince of Wales, who serves as president of BAFTA in the audience and wished improving health to his wife Kate Middleton and King Charles III.\n\nPutt also said the past year has been one of “immense challenge for our industry and the world.” But she added with delight that audiences rediscovered cinemas “turbo-boosted by Barbenheimer.”\n\nA video showing Tennant doing video calls with the likes of his Good Omens and Staged co-star Michael Sheen, who asked Tennant to dog sit, Stanley Tucci, Tom Hiddleston and Judi Dench followed. The host then hit the stage, dressed in a kilt, with Sheen’s dog in hand and playing surprised to see Sheen sitting in the front row. In the end, the host dropped the dog in Sheen’s lap.\n\nIn his opening monologue, Tennant quipped that the stars in their nice outfits reminded him of characters from Saltburn, but he added that he hoped the ceremony wouldn’t end like the film.\n\nCheck out the winners in each category, highlighted in bold, below.\n\nBest Film\n\nANATOMY OF A FALL Marie-Ange Luciani, David Thion\n\nTHE HOLDOVERS Mark Johnson\n\nKILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON Dan Friedkin, Daniel Lupi, Martin Scorsese, Bradley Thomas\n\nOPPENHEIMER Christopher Nolan, Charles Roven, Emma Thomas (WINNER)\n\nPOOR THINGS Ed Guiney, Yorgos Lanthimos, Andrew Lowe, Emma Stone\n\nLeading Actress\n\nFANTASIA BARRINO The Color Purple\n\nSANDRA HÜLLER Anatomy of a Fall\n\nCAREY MULLIGAN Maestro\n\nVIVIAN OPARAH Rye Lane\n\nMARGOT ROBBIE Barbie\n\nEMMA STONE Poor Things (WINNER)\n\nLeading Actor\n\nBRADLEY COOPER Maestro\n\nCOLMAN DOMINGO Rustin\n\nPAUL GIAMATTI The Holdovers\n\nBARRY KEOGHAN Saltburn\n\nCILLIAN MURPHY Oppenheimer (WINNER)\n\nTEO YOO Past Lives\n\nEE Rising Star Award (voted for by the public)\n\nPHOEBE DYNEVOR\n\nAYO EDEBIRI\n\nJACOB ELORDI\n\nMIA MCKENNA-BRUCE (WINNER)\n\nSOPHIE WILDE\n\nDirector\n\nALL OF US STRANGERS Andrew Haigh\n\nANATOMY OF A FALL Justine Triet\n\nTHE HOLDOVERS Alexander Payne\n\nMAESTRO Bradley Cooper\n\nOPPENHEIMER Christopher Nolan (WINNER)\n\nTHE ZONE OF INTEREST Jonathan Glazer\n\nMake Up & Hair\n\nKILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON Kay Georgiou, Thomas Nellen\n\nMAESTRO Sian Grigg, Kay Georgiou, Kazu Hiro, Lori McCoy-Bell\n\nNAPOLEON Jana Carboni, Francesco Pegoretti, Satinder Chumber, Julia Vernon\n\nOPPENHEIMER Luisa Abel, Jaime Leigh McIntosh, Jason Hamer, Ahou Mofid\n\nPOOR THINGS Nadia Stacey, Mark Coulier, Josh Weston (WINNER)\n\nCostume Design\n\nBARBIE Jacqueline Durran\n\nKILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON Jacqueline West\n\nNAPOLEON Dave Crossman, Janty Yates\n\nOPPENHEIMER Ellen Mirojnick\n\nPOOR THINGS Holly Waddington (WINNER)\n\nOutstanding British Film\n\nALL OF US STRANGERS Andrew Haigh, Graham Broadbent, Pete Czernin, Sarah Harvey\n\nHOW TO HAVE SEX Molly Manning Walker, Emily Leo, Ivana MacKinnon, Konstantinos Kontovrakis\n\nNAPOLEON Ridley Scott, Mark Huffam, Kevin J.
