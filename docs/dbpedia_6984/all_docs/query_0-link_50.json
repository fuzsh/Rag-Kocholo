        "text": ": Jesse Polowin\n\nWritten by JJ Heaton\n\nThe Academy Awards may be an American event, but we Brits have a habit of sneaking our way to the top of their ranks. Welcome to WatchMojo UK, and today we'll be counting down our picks for the Top 10 Oscar-Winning British Films.\n\nFor this list, we'll be taking a look at the best of the best: British films that have taken home the Academy Award for Best Picture. We are only including films that were produced or co-produced by film companies based in the UK, so movies with a British cast or theme which were funded elsewhere, such as “Shakespeare in Love” or “Braveheart”, do not count. For this list, it's what's behind the camera that matters, not in front of it.\n\nSpecial thanks to our user RichardFB for submitting the idea on our interactive suggestion tool: WatchMojo.comsuggest"
