        "text": "8 1/2, 1963\n\nFederico Fellini\n\nSet betwixt and between Rome and a conjured fantasy land, 8 1/2 follows Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) as he suffers from director’s block and the endeavor of his next film. He escapes his reality and takes viewers along a surreal mambo Italiano; it's unclear where exactly in Italy Marcello is at times, but the film does incite a strong desire for all things Italian.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nA Bigger Splash, 2015\n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\nInspired by La Piscine, Jacques Deray’s psychological thriller from 1969, Guadagnino delivered 2015's A Bigger Splash. The film—lush with life’s simplest sources of beauty—finds Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Ralph Fiennes, and Dakota Johnson vacationing on the ragged island of Pantelleria, shacked up in a dammuso (a traditional Pantallerian home). With treks along the jagged coast and homemade ricotta, the island's charms take hold but only just before tragedy ensues and the holiday comes to a screeching halt.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nBoom!, 1968\n\nJoseph Losey\n\nBased on the Tennessee Williams play, “The Milk Train Doesn’t Stop Here Anymore,” Boom! stars a terminally ill but impeccably dressed heiress (Elizabeth Taylor) who has secluded herself in a Sardinian mansion. She's preparing for her impending death when a handsome stranger (Richard Burton) arrives and adds to the drama of it all. Together they have a tumultuous relationship (perhaps not so far off from reality), exchanging insults as sharp as the jagged Sardinian rocks. Boom! may have been a box office flop, but the allure of Sardinia is undeniable.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nCall Me by Your Name, 2017\n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\nPerhaps the most unintended result of Call Me by Your Name was the wave of tourism to Crema, Italy. After seeing Guadagnino’s final piece of his Desire trilogy, the public made a mad dash to the tiny Italian town, inspired by the luxuriously languorous summer days spent by the stars of the film, Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer. The love story follows two men, each a type of devastating handsome, as they pass the hours biking around town, padding around the family terrazzo-floored villa, or reclining by the pool. It's the summer romance everyone wishes they had.\n\nCaro Diario, 1993\n\nNanni Moretti\n\nThis semi-autobiographical comedy—written, directed, co-produced, and starring Nanni Moretti—follows Moretti as he hunts for inspiration for his next film. Scenes showcase Moretti zipping through the deserted summer streets of Rome on his Vespa and holidaying in the Aeolian Islands, hopping from Lipari to Salina to Stromboli and finally to Alicudi, a dollop of an island in the sapphire Mediterranean.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nCinema Paradiso, 1988\n\nGiuseppe Tornatore\n\nIn the years succeeding WWII, older projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) shares his love and knowledge of film with the young Salvatore “Toto” (Jacques Perrin). Set in northwest Sicily and based on the director’s hometown Bagheria, Cinema Paradiso was shot on location across Italy, including the famous Piazza Umberto I in Palazzo Adriano in Palermo, as well as in Rome, and in Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nContempt, 1963\n\nJean-Luc Godard\n\nIn Jean-Luc Godard’s New Wave drama, a French playwright Paul (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) are sent to Rome to work on a film adaptation of Homer’s The Odyssey, which is funded by a swashbuckling American producer (Jack Palance). The couple incessantly argues their way to Capri, where even their accommodations—the awe-inspiring, architectural masterpiece that is Casa Malaparte—doesn’t quell the quarreling. No matter, the film offers plenty to look at.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nDeath in Venice, 1971\n\nLuchino Visconti\n\nCholera has taken hold in Venice when Gustav von Aschenbach, an austere composer, arrives. He opts to stay, finding beauty in the decay that surrounds him and hope in the form of a delicately handsome young Polish traveler who is full of life. Von Aschenbach admires him from afar, as does the audience the stunning visuals of Venice provided by Visconti.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nEnchanted April, 1991\n\nMike Newell\n\n\"Based on the 1922 novel, this film follows four women who trade dreary London for a sun-drenched holiday in Portofino, Itay. They spend their blissful days in a medieval castle (Castello Brown, where the author of the book originally stayed), take dips in the Mediterranean sea, and rediscover all the delicious pleasures that life has to offer.\"\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe five-time Academy Award-winning film revolves around Russell Crowe as betrayed Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is forced into slavery and becomes a gladiator to avenge his family and his emperor. Although set in Rome, much of the movie was filmed in England, Morocco, and Malta, except for the heartbreaking scene of Crowe’s return to his Cyprus-tree-lined home in the wheatfields of the Orcia Valley in Tuscany.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nI Am Love, 2009\n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\nGuadagnino’s first installment in his Desire trilogy is the achingly beautiful drama set in Milan at Piero Portaluppi’s modernist marvel Villa Necchi Campiglio. Tilda Swinton plays the matriarch of the home, who is an impeccably dressed but forgotten housewife who finds comfort in her son’s friend Antonio, a passionate young chef opening a restaurant in San Remo in Liguria. Between Necchi and Swinton, the film will have you yearning for Milan. It’s followed by Guadagnino’s A Bigger Splash in 2015 and Call Me by Your Name in 2017.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nIl Postino: The Postman, 1994\n\nMassimo Troisi, Michael Radford\n\nIn this fictional story of the real-life Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret), Neruda has been exiled from his country and sent to live on the tiny Italian island of Procida in the Gulf of Naples. He forms a friendship with a postman named Mario (Massimo Troisi), who becomes a student and learns the art of poetry to seduce a beautiful local named Beatrice. Throughout, Procida reveals its rustic beauty.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nIt Started in Naples, 1960\n\nMelville Shavelson\n\nClark Gable plays an uptight lawyer who travels to Naples to settle the estate of his late brother who left behind an insouciant 8-year-old who is now cared for by a vivacious, cabaret-singing aunt played by Sophia Loren. An unlikely romance ensues against the picturesque backdrops of Rome, Naples, and the beaches of Capri. One scene with Loren singing “Tu Vuò Fà L’Americano” (the same song Jude Law would jam out to in The Talented Mr. Ripley) is as good as it gets.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nJourney to Italy, 1954\n\nRoberto Rossellini\n\nUpon inheriting a villa in Naples, an estranged couple reunites in Italy. The director Roberto Rossellini cast his wife, Ingrid Bergman, to play the lead opposite George Sanders. Bergman opts to wander such landmarks as the Naples Museum, Phlegraean Fields, and the Fontanelle cemetery, while Sanders prefers aperitivo cocktails in Capri. The pair seemed destined for distance until love is rekindled on a visit to Pompeii during the Saint Gennaro festival.\n\nJust Married, 2003\n\nShawn Levy\n\nNewlyweds played by the late Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher embark on an ill-fated European honeymoon that is doomed from the start. After receiving the boot from the concierge at their Italian hotel in the Alps, crashing their mini-car into a snowbank, and checking into a pitiful pensione in Venice, the couple quickly realize they have very different interests. It may have been the honeymoon from hell but the scenery was heavenly.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nKaos, 1984\n\nPaolo Taviani, Vittorio Taviani\n\nBased on four short stories from “Novelle Per Un Anno” by Luigi Pirandello, Kaos is a dreamy, poetic film with a quartet of plots set in Sicily. Most visually appealing is the dreamy 20-minute epilogue, set to Nicola Piovani’s film score, which features children sliding down immense white slopes of pumice sand that flow down into the turquoise sea on the island of Lipari.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nL’Avventura, 1960\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni\n\nThe first of a trilogy by director Michelangelo Antonioni, L’Avventura follows the out-of-thin-air-vanishing of a young woman (Lea Massari) while on a Mediterranean yachting excursion. What follows is a fruitless search undertaken by her boyfriend (Gabriele Ferzetti) and best friend (Monica Vitti). Despite the woeful holiday gone wrong, the film does have you yearning to visit its locales—an incredible baroque Villa Palagonia near Palermo and the volcanic rock Aeolian Island of Panarea.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nLa Dolce Vita, 1960\n\nFederico Fellini\n\nSearching for love and happiness in all the wrong places, a journalist named Marcello (played by Fellini-favorite Marcello Mastroianni) finds himself soaking up the sweet life of Roman cafe society in Federico Fellini’s cinematic masterpiece. Follow Marcello through his whirlwind romps about the ancient aqueducts, Saint Peter’s Square, the Baths of Caracalla, the nightclubs of Via Veneto, and, of course, the Trevi Fountain, where a ballgowned Anita Ekberg famously indulges in a night swim.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nLetters to Juliet, 2010\n\nGary Winick\n\nIt’s a sappy rom-com, but the idyllic Italian settings in Siena and the Tuscan countryside make it worthwhile. While on a trip to Verona with her distracted fiancé (Gael García Bernal), Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) discovers that love letters left in Juliet’s courtyard are answered by the “Secretaries of Juliet.” She decides to join them and is especially moved by an unanswered letter from Claire Smith (Vanessa Redgrave) in 1957 about long lost love. She answers, prompting Claire and her handsome grandson to join her in Italy on a quest for a man named Lorenzo.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing, 1993\n\nKenneth Branagh\n\nShakespeare’s classic tale comes to life in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of conspiring young lovers Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) who attempt to play matchmaker to confirmed singles Beatrice (Emma Thompson) and Benedick (Kenneth Branagh). A double wedding is had at the picturesque Villa Vignamaggio in the Chianti region of Tuscany in Italy, and the couples live happily ever after.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nOnly You, 1994\n\nNorman Jewison\n\nA recently engaged Marisa Tomei leaves her fiancé for Italy in search of her soulmate whose name she believes is Damon Bradley, based on a childhood game of Ouija board and a psychic. After a chase from Venice to Florence, Tomei meets a charming love interest, played by Robert Downey Jr., in Rome, and travels to Positano with him—the only problem is his name is not Damon Bradley.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nPurple Noon, 1960\n\nRené Clément\n\nIn the original film adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley, Alain Delon and his piercingly good looks play Tom Ripley with the also dapper Maurice Ronet as the playboy Philippe Greenleaf. Beauty abounds in every frame, from the fictional town of Mongibello (mostly shot just off Naples in Procida) to Marge—the name of Greenleaf’s beauteous girlfriend and sailboat. The latter is where Ripley would commit the not-so-perfect crime, but it’s hard to stay mad at a face like his.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nRoman Holiday, 1953\n\nWilliam Wyler\n\nShe (Audrey Hepburn) was a princess of an unnamed European country on tour in Italy, he (Gregory Peck) was an American journalist stationed in Rome. Together they did as the Romans do: traversing the city on a Vespa, stopping for gelato, and ascending the Spanish Steps. The film’s title says it all—Roman Holiday.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nRoom With a View, 1985\n\nJames Ivory\n\nAdapted from E.M. Forster’s novel of the same name, the British film stars Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy, a young girl growing up in conservative Edwardian England, who holidays in Florence with her spinster chaperone (Maggie Smith). It is there that she meets George (Julian Sands) who graciously offers to exchange hotel rooms so that she might have a view of Duomo and Arno. Romance ensues as the two find themselves alone in the cobblestone streets of the Piazza della Signoria and Fiesole in Tuscany before returning home to Surrey, England.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nStealing Beauty, 1996\n\nBernardo Bertolucci\n\nSet on the stunning estate of Castello di Brolio, in the rolling Tuscan hills near Siena, Bernardo Bertolucci’s coming of age romantic drama stars a young American, played by Liv Tyler, who spends summer with the colorful friends of her late mother, an avant-garde poet.\n\nSummertime, 1955\n\nDavid Lean\n\nHaving resigned herself to spinsterhood, Katharine Hepburn’s character—a stylish single secretary—embarks on a solo sojourn to Venice. While sipping an aperitif in the Piazza San Marco, she locks eyes with a charming antique dealer played by Rossano Brazzi. A brief yet bittersweet affair ensues over gondola rides along the canals and a day trip to Burano. The farewell, set on the platform of the Venice train station, will have you in tears.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Big Blue, 1988\n\nLuc Besson\n\nBesson’s fictionalized story of real-life free divers Jacques Mayol (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo Maiorca (Jean Reno) starts from their childhood in Greece to their deaths in an ’80s competition in Sicily. The film is a cult-favorite in France, and needless to say, it provides ample footage of beautiful blue waters.\"\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Godfather, 1972\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola\n\nIn the first of Francis Ford Coppola’s trilogy, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), a college-educated and decorated war hero, becomes entangled in the family business. To let the dust of his decision settle, he flees New York to Sicily and travels the bucolic Italian countryside to the town of Corleone in Palermo. It’s there that Michael first locks eyes with Apollonia, among the fields of oleanders, and then marries her in a traditional wedding ceremony at the local Church of San Nicolò in Savoca. The wedding is followed by a traditional Catholic procession through the medieval streets of the village of Forza d’Agro near Taormina.\n\nThe Great Beauty, 2013\n\nPaolo Sorrentino\n\nPaolo Sorrentino’s Oscar-winning film opens with Jep Gambardella (a playboy writer and man-about-town played by Toni Servillo) enjoying his riotous 65th birthday party. The scene unfolds like a music video or a kaleidoscope whirling with Campari, conga lines populated by eccentric Romans, and flashing lights. Afterward, Jep experiences an existential crisis and embarks on a journey to find substantial beauty and meaning in his life. All the while, Sorrentino delivers us the ultimate love letter to Rome.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Italian Job, 1969\n\nPeter Collinson\n\nIn a film that captured the swagger of the swinging ’60s, Michael Caine plays a Cockney crook who leads a heist in Turin that required the use of three Mini Coopers. The trio of little striped cars famously maneuvered through the beautiful baroque staircase of the Palazzo Madama, a wedding on the steps of the Chiesa della Gran Madre di Dio, onto the roof of a Fiat factory race track in Lingotto, through the River Po, and eventually out through the underground sewers. Turin is on full display in this version, while the 2003 remake—starring Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron—utilizes Venice.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Leopard, 1963\n\nLuchino Visconti\n\nLuchino Visconti’s epic period drama is based on Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel of the same name, which chronicled the unification of modern Italy during the Risorgimento period in the 19th century. Set in Sicily, the story centers on Prince Don Fabrizio of Salina (played by Burt Lancaster) along with his young nephew Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon) and his beautiful wife Angelica Sedara Bertiana (Claudia Cardinale). Filmed in medieval villages surrounding Palermo—including the sumptuous ballroom of the Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi in the Piazza Croce dei Vespri—the film offers a gilded glimpse into the fading world of of the Sicilian aristocracy.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Star Maker, 1995\n\nGiuseppe Tornatore\n\nThe Star Maker is a film about making films.

This is thanks to the impossibly glamorous costars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, who find themselves in a cat-and-mouse chase from Paris to Venice, in and out of trains, gondolas, bistros, canals, and palazzos throughout the romantic thriller.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Trip to Italy, 2014\n\nMichael Winterbottom\n\nAfter the success of Michael Winterbottom’s 2010 British comedy TV series, The Trip, starring English comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as fictionalized characters of themselves, comes The Trip to Italy: a tale of two men enjoying six scenic meals in Italy from Piedmont to Capri, stopping in Liguria, Tuscany, Rome, and Amalfi.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThree Coins in the Fountain, 1954\n\nJean Negulesco\n\nThree American secretaries (played by Maggie McNamara, Jean Peters, and Dorothy McGuire)—single and dreaming of everlasting love—visit the Trevi Fountain; three coins are tossed in a fountain; three strapping men (played by Louis Jourdan, Rossano Brazzi, and Clifton Webb) enter the picture.
