        "text": "MOVIES\n\nShelling Out the Shells: The Canadian-British film “Margaret’s Museum” won the top prize--the Golden Shell--at the 43rd San Sebastian film festival in Spain on Saturday. The film, starring Helena Bonham Carter and directed by Mort Ransen, tells the story of a love affair in a Canadian coal mining town in the 1940s. The Silver Shell for best director went to Mike Figgis for “Leaving Las Vegas.” Nicolas Cage won the best actor award for his work in the same film. The jury’s special prize went to the Spanish entry “No One Will Talk About Us When We Are Dead,” directed by Agustin Diaz Yanes.\n\nTELEVISION\n\nRock On: For those who couldn’t sit through the seven-hour “Concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame” when it was broadcast in its entirety on HBO earlier this month, the cable network will broadcast concert highlights on Tuesday from 7 to 10:05 p.m. featuring 39 songs by performers including Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Melissa Ethridge, Bob Dylan and Jerry Lee Lewis. . . . The Nashville Network will telecast a seven-hour Farm Aid special Oct. 2 at 2 p.m., focusing on the Oct. 1 10th Anniversary Farm Aid Benefit Concert in Louisville, Ky. The concert will feature Farm Aid founders Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Neil Young and John Conlee, as well as Hootie and the Blowfish, Dave Matthews Band and BlackHawk.\n\n*\n\nDream On: Sportscaster James Brown was named to host “A Hoop Dreams Reunion,” a special on what has happened to the two young basketball players, Arthur Agee and William Gates, featured in “Hoop Dreams” since the acclaimed documentary was finished. The previously announced program will air following the television premiere of “Hoop Dreams” on Nov. 15 on PBS. Brown, a veteran of CBS Sports and currently the co-host of Fox’s “NFL Sunday,” is no stranger to the world of basketball--in 1973 he was a fourth-round draft pick of the Atlanta Hawks shortly after he graduated from Harvard University.\n\n*\n\nHBO’s Coming Attractions: HBO has followed its good showing at both the Emmys and the CableAce Award nominations by announcing two ambitious cable films set to start production. Alan Rickman, Isabella Rossellini and Ian McKellen star in “Rasputin,” to be filmed on location in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Budapest, Hungary, starting in October; and Delroy Lindo, Mykelti Williamson and Blair Underwood will star in “Baseball in Black and White,” about the real-life struggles of Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier in the sport.\n\n*\n\nThe King of Music Videos: Michael Jackson was inducted into Black Entertainment Television’s Walk of Fame and was named the most significant performer in the music video industry by the cable network at an awards ceremony Friday in Washington, D.C. Appearing on stage at the event celebrating the network’s 15th anniversary, Jackson performed his hit single “You Are Not Alone” with the city’s Union Temple Baptist choir.\n\nPOP/ROCK\n\nMonster Ticket Sales: R.E.M. added a third show to its tour-ending dates in Atlanta after selling out two concerts in 32 minutes. Fans snapped up more than 16,000 seats for the Nov. 18-19 shows on Saturday. The band immediately announced the third and final show, set for Nov. 21, and sold another 7,000 tickets by the end of the day. The Monster tour, which began in January, has been interrupted three times: Singer Michael Stipe had a hernia, drummer Bill Berry suffered a cranial aneurysm and bassist Mike Mills had abdominal problems.\n\nQUICK TAKES\n\nCourteney Cox of NBC’s hit sitcom “Friends” has been cast in Universal’s upcoming movie “Commandments.” The romantic comedy about a man who sets out to break all Ten Commandments after the death of his wife also stars Aidan Quinn and Anthony LaPaglia. . . . Comedian Pauly Shore will perform a night of stand-up comedy on Oct. 10 at the Comedy Store in Hollywood and take part in a family reunion at the same time. His dad, comedian Sammy Shore, will open the act. Mom, Mitzi Shore, owns the comedy club. Proceeds will go to the Family Assistance Program, which helps homeless families."
