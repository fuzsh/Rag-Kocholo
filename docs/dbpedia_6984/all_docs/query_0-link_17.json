        "text": "Forget Trafalgar, cricket or a cup of well-brewed tea. What could stir British hearts more than Danny Boyle jumping up and down on Hollywood's biggest stage? Accepting his Oscar for directing Slumdog Millionaire, he explained to a presumably startled audience: \"My kids are too old to remember this now, but when they were much younger, I swore to them if this miracle happened, that I would receive it in the spirit of Tigger from Winnie the Pooh.\"\n\nSlumdog's haul of eight Academy Awards, including best film, was the best by a UK contender since The English Patient took nine in 1997. In addition, Kate Winslet won best actress, The Duchess took the Oscar for costume design and Man on Wire was named best documentary. As British accent after British accent played in American ears during the acceptance speeches, it seemed the entire national film industry was enjoying a Boyle bounce.\n\nCinemagoers have more British riches to come this year. Stephen Poliakoff returns to film after a decade's absence with 1939, set between the outbreak of the Second World War and the present day, with a cast including Romola Garai, Bill Nighy and Julie Christie. Ken Loach's Looking for Eric features ex-footballer Eric Cantona, while Stephen Frears directs Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Friend in Cheri. Jude Law and Judi Dench star in Rage, an exposé of the New York fashion scene directed by Sally Potter, while Ben Barnes, Colin Firth and Rebecca Hall figure in Oliver Parker's adaptation of Dorian Gray.\n\nThere will also be biopics ranging from Bronson, about \"Britain's most dangerous prisoner\", to Creation, marking Charles Darwin's anniversary year, to Bright Star, Jane Campion's take on John Keats. One of the most eagerly awaited is this month's The Damned United, in which master impersonator Michael Sheen plays football manager Brian Clough, adapted by Peter Morgan from the novel by David Peace.\n\nThis promising crop secured their financing in the nick of time – spend on indigenous British films last year was up 21.5% compared with 2007. This year, though, the recession threatens to bite into future productions and the extravagant optimism of today could dissipate rapidly.\n\n\"Traditionally, there are only two stories about the British film industry,\" said John Woodward, chief executive of the UK Film Council. \"Either the British film industry is booming or the British film industry is in crisis, and usually neither of those stories is quite right; 2009-10 is going to be quite a mixed year.\"\n\nFirst, the bad news. Film4, the force behind Slumdog Millionaire, as well as the nominated In Bruges and Happy-Go-Lucky, is facing a cut to its modest £10m budget because of financial difficulties at Channel 4. In the economic crisis, independent producers are caught in a pincer movement: the credit crunch means banks are less willing to make loans, while distributors are paying less up front because their customers, notably TV broadcasters, are paying less because of the advertising downturn.\n\nOn the other hand, the pound's loss of strength against the US dollar means that Britain is currently hugely attractive to Hollywood studios: major productions including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Gulliver's Travels and Nottingham start shooting here this year. Woodward added: \"Britain is firing on all cylinders at the minute. The industry is turning out relatively low-budget, commercial, quirky films like Slumdog and low-budget arthouse documentary films like Man on Wire, and at the same time it's looking to what's going to be by the end of the year quite a full order book for big international movies where people are coming over here to benefit from UK skills and tax breaks.\n\n\"If you look at the British film industry over the past six or seven years, what's becoming apparent is that it's been consistent. It's not every year the country goes out and wins a fistful of Oscars, so I'm wary of saying it's 'golden age'. People in the industry know they're in hard times, but what is interesting is that they're quite confident because the rest of the world feels the Brits are really at the top of their game at the moment. So we're in a good place. I think the people who are going to have a tough year are the independent producers.\"\n\nThe Film Council, Film4 and BBC Films are the key pillars of support for independent film-makers. Tessa Ross, head of Film4, believes this is a vital element of public service broadcasting in need of protection, describing her role as \"to keep on churning and growing so that the next Danny Boyle is coming through but we don't know his or her name yet. It's great to wave a flag, but it's also very important to remember what that's about: development, time, risk and unknown talent being protected. It's not just about awards.\"\n\nLord Puttnam, the producer and deputy chairman of Channel 4, says: \"The creative industries are the canary in the coalmine. They are always the very first to take ill because they're more vulnerable in some ways, but they're also a very good indicator when things start to improve. They are additionally very susceptible to American exchange rate changes because so much of it is labour-intensive – it's all about wages.\"\n\nWas there ever a golden age in British film? The best picture Oscars are a measure, albeit an idiosyncratic one. Past winners include Laurence Olivier's Hamlet, which pipped Michael Powell's The Red Shoes in 1948, and The Bridge on the River Kwai in 1957. Lawrence of Arabia and Tom Jones won in 1962 and 1963 respectively. Twenty years later, a similar double was achieved by Chariots of Fire in 1981 and Gandhi a year later. The English Patient won in 1997, followed by Shakespeare in Love in 1999. In other words, swings and roundabouts. Others might look back fondly on Powell and Pressburger's salad days or on the Ealing comedies.\n\nPuttnam, who produced Chariots of Fire, is adamant: \"There was no golden age. People forget that Chariots of Fire was made without a penny of British money. Gandhi scrambled for money for years and years and years. There was a perceptual golden age because we had a run of success, but it's much, much easier to get a film made today than it was 25 years ago. No comparison.\"\n\nThe Young Victoria\n\nRelease date: 6 March\n\nDirector: Jean-Marc Vallée\n\nStars: Emily Blunt, Rupert Friend, Miranda Richardson, Mark Strong, Paul Bettany.\n\nA costume drama about Queen Victoria's rise from a cloistered childhood to the throne at the age of 18. Played by Emily Blunt, Victoria discovers a soulmate in Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) when their politically arranged marriage turns into a love affair. The screenplay was written by Oscar winner Julian Fellowes. \"Everyone knows Queen Victoria, but the Queen Victoria they know is the widow in black,\" he says. \"We know about the grief but we don't know about the love that preceded it.\"\n\nThe film was produced by, among others, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, whose daughter, Princess Beatrice, is glimpsed making her movie debut.\n\nFellowes adds: \"Britain needs a co-ordinated industry and to make mainstream films. That's why Slumdog is so welcome: it's not just a very good film, it's also a film that people enjoy and want to see. All those British films about people being sick in a bucket and then falling off a bridge do not get to the mainstream viewer, so the British go to American films when they want to be entertained. I want them to go to British films.\"\n\nShifty\n\nRelease date: 24 April\n\nDirector: Eran Creevy\n\nStars: Riz Ahmed, Daniel Mays, Jason Flemyng.\n\nAn urban thriller set in the outskirts of London and based on the teenage experiences of writer/director Eran Creevy. Chris, now an adult with mortgage and job, is shocked to discover that his old friend Shifty has started dealing hard drugs. Over the next 24 hours the pair are forced to confront ghosts from the past and come to terms with Shifty's desperate and dangerous present. The film stars Riz Ahmed, previously seen in Britz and The Road to Guantanamo.\n\n\"It's a film about friendship,\" says Ben Pugh, of production company Between The Eyes. \"They spend the day together going back to old haunts and they have to decide which way Shifty's life is going to go. It's a character study, a normal day that's sped up dramatically.\"\n\nThe picture was funded by Film London's Microwave scheme and completed shooting in just 18 days. \"The economic situation is making it more difficult,\" says Pugh. \"But the Oscar results were fantastic and we want to go and emulate that success. I'm very optimistic.\"\n\nAn Education\n\nRelease date: autumn\n\nDirector: Lone Scherfig\n\nStars: Peter Sarsgaard, Carey Mulligan, Alfred Molina, Emma Thompson.\n\nA coming-of-age drama based on Observer journalist Lynn Barber's early 60s memoir about a 16-year-old schoolgirl who falls in love with an older man. David introduces Jenny to a world of classical concerts, smoky bars and late-night suppers, jeopardising her parents' dream of seeing her go to Oxford. Scripted by Nick Hornby, it was a hit at the Sundance Festival and is tipped as the breakthrough film for 23-year-old star Mulligan.\n\n\"It's a rite-of-passage story about a teenager at that crucial cusp in someone's life, the edge of adulthood,\" says executive producer Jam ie Laurenson of BBC Films. \"How do you go about following your dream when you don't know what it is and you're not fully formed? Education doesn't seem as appealing as the Swinging 60s.\"\n\nBBC Films developed the project before going into partnership with LA-based production and finance company Endgame Entertainment. Adds Laurenson: \" An Education is a very different film from something like Slumdog Millionaire, but each is made with a real passion for the subject.\"\n\nIn the Loop\n\nRelease date: 17 April\n\nDirector: Armando Iannucci\n\nStars: Tom Hollander, James Gandolfini, Chris Addison, Peter Capaldi, Gina McKee.\n\nA political satire directed by Armando Iannucci and co-written with the team he worked with on the Bafta award-winning BBC hit The Thick of It, the film comedy sends up Britain and America's special relationship in the lead-up to a war no one seems to be able to stop. The film was shown at this year's Sundance festival, where one critic described it as \"achingly, wrenchingly, dizzyingly funny\".\n\nAs Iannucci describes it, \"This time Malcolm Tucker [Peter Capaldi's character in The Thick of It] is meeting forces that are beyond his control because it's set in the build-up to a possible military conflict in the Middle East that America and Britain are involved in. There hasn't been in film, I think, a depiction of Washington politics, not as sinister or noble, but being a bit rubbish. It's politics, but done through office politics.\"\n\nIn the Loop is a joint production by BBC Films, the UK Film Council and Aramid Entertainment. \"There was interest from American distributors ,\" says Iannucci. \"But I wanted it to be an entirely British-made film so I could tell the story without any pressure to gear it to another audience.\"\n\nA Frenchman's Guide to Love\n\nRelease date: May/June\n\nDirector: Jackie Oudney\n\nStars: Hugh Bonneville, Eric Cantona, Victoria Hamilton, Anne-Marie Duff.\n\nA romantic comedy about the nature of love – and whether the French do it better than us. Journalist Jed Winter (Bonneville) gives short shrift to theories of romance proffered by Thierry Grimandi, an auteur film-maker played by former footballer Cantona. But his long-term girlfriend refuses to marry, forcing him into couples counselling instead, Winter begins to wonder if Grimandi might be on to something.\" It's about a jaded Englishman being told by a Frenchman the true nature of love,\" says producer Judy Counihan. \"Women respond brilliantly to this film and of course Cantona is a big pull for men.\"\n\nThe Slingshot Studios production is financed by an unusual formula: everyone involved, including the actors, is being paid at a greatly reduced rate, but all will reap a percentage if the film makes a profit. \"We are up there as equals with the financiers,\" says Counihan. \"The model is for emerging talent to get a shot at making things. We've always had fantastic talent here. It's about finding the opportunity for that talent. We need people like Film4 to nurture it and give it a voice.\"\n\nLondon River\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDirector: Rachid Bouchareb\n\nStars: Brenda Blethyn, Sami Bouajila.\n\nThe London bombings of 7 July 2005 feature in a movie which was the talk of the Berlin Film Festival. Two very different characters cross paths when they go in search of their children, each of whom is missing in the terrorist attacks. One parent is Elisabeth, a Falklands war widow living in Guernsey who is shocked by the multiculturalism of London. The other is Ousmane, a Muslim who arrives in London speaking no English.\n\n\"The bombings are a backdrop,\" says Matthieu de Braconier of the film's London-based production company The Bureau. \"The subject matter is how people relate across cultures. It's a starting point for the journey of two very different characters. They come to London with different realities. One of the strengths is having a director [Franco-Algerian Bouchareb] from outside.\"\n\nThe Bureau joined forces with Bouchareb and Jean Bréhat's 3B Productions in Paris to make the film. \"Getting the financing was beyond difficult,\" says de Braconier. \"There is too little done on particular British subjects. We want to express our identity rather than please an American crowd.\"\n\nThe following wave: six more British films to look out for\n\nNowhere Boy\n\nArtist Sam Taylor-Wood makes her feature-directing debut with a film about the early life of John Lennon. Scripted by Matt Greenhalgh, who won a Bafta for his work on Joy Division biopic Control, and based on a book by Lennon's half-sister Julia Baird, it focuses on the young Beatle's relationship with his estranged mother and the aunt who raised him. Young British actor Aaron Johnson stars.\n\nLe Donk\n\nShane Meadows returns to his guerrilla origins on this short film, improvised over the course of five days in 2007. Regular Meadows collaborator Paddy Considine plays the film's eponymous hero, a roadie for Arctic Monkeys.\n\nFifty Dead Men Walking\n\nA crime thriller based on the best-selling autobiography by Martin McGartland, who was employed by the British to inform on the IRA between 1989 and 1991. Rising star Jim Sturgess plays McGartland while Ben Kingsley plays his British handler Fergus. In cinemas from 10 April.\n\nThe Damned United\n\nFresh from Frost/Nixon, Michael Sheen stars as iconic football manager Brian Clough in Peter Morgan's adaptation of the David Peace novel. The film traces Clough's rise to the top of the First Division as manager of Derby County and his ill-fated tenure at top dogs Leeds United in 1974, where he took over from arch-rival Don Revie but lasted only 44 days in the job. In cinemas from 27 March.\n\nLooking for Eric\n\nFootballer turned actor Eric Cantona returns to the big screen, this time playing himself in Ken Loach's latest. The film centres on a football-mad postman on the verge of a nervous breakdown who begins an imaginary friendship with the former Manchester United player. The film has been described as 'magical social realism'.\n\nFour Lions\n\nHaving courted controversy with TV satires on drugs culture and paedophilia, Chris Morris tackles suicide bombing on his feature-directing debut made with indie production company Warp Films. The film reportedly shows the human side of its jihadi subjects and is based on the premise that \"Terrorism is about ideology, but it's also about berks.\""
