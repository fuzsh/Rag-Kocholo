        "text": "My experience at the hotel was fine. Getting to you was horrendous. Signage was abysmal and I almost gave up and stayed at the Sheraton which I could find. I tried calling the number for the hotel in the email but it was never answered. I tried multiple times. I then went to the Sheraton after 40 minutes of no luck finding how to get to you. The kind staff there told me how to get to you and recommended relaxing at your very good bar. You should thank them! This isn’t on you but it did impact my stay. I needed to transfer on a train to another terminal to get to you. Fine. Except without being told that by the Sheraton staff, I’d never have known. Next problem was because it was now quite late, 11pm, the lift and escalators were turned off. I had to carry my very heavy luggage down the escalators. Of course once I got to the correct location you were easy to find. Next problem was having to get to your front door by walking through all the people smoking. As a non smoker, it was disgusting and I had no way in my room to air my clothing. All of this could have been easily avoided if you put instructions on how to get to and from various locations in your email or on your website. Oh and not allow smoking directly in the entrance to the hotel. I met another person who had the same experience trying to find you, so it’s not just me.\n\nNot easy to find when arriving at CDG - after trying to call the hotel multiple times to get directions, I finally found a person who could direct us to find the Ibis located near T3. The entrance is vibrant but the room was at the end of its rope: broken windows, broken bathroom, damaged walls etc... Its in real need of cosmetic help. The second bed for my daughter was questionable (stained linen) so she ended up sleeping next to me. If its like us, a one night on the go - its fine but more than that I will say - pass. The price at 380 euros for the night becasue of the OG is an absolute abuse for what it is."
