        "text": "Day 1\n\nWhere: St Remy de Provence\n\nTerrain: Rolling\n\nRide: 9 mi or 15 km\n\nMeals: L, D\n\nA gentle but rolling start to the tour as we ride a loop from our home at the Mas de l’Oulivie for the first couple of nights through the Parc naturel régional des Alpilles. This ride is primarily to ensure our bikes are fit and ready for travel but it is a beautiful little circuit. In the afternoon we explore the atmospheric town of St Remy de Provence, previously home to Van Gogh and Nostradamus, and renowned for its art and culture.\n\nHotel: Mas de l’Oulivié\n\nDay 2\n\nWhere: Les Baux-de-Provence\n\nTerrain: Hilly\n\nRide: 24/37 mi or 38/59 km\n\nMeals: B, D\n\nWe head deeper into the Parc naturel régional des Alpilles today on a rolling loop ride that meanders through vineyards and olive groves. With an astonishing array of aromas and colours this arid area is characterized by limestone peaks which give the impression of being taller than they really are – who’s to know the difference between conquering the Alpilles and the Alps! Today we visit the iconic fortified town of Les Baux-de-Provence and give you the option to investigate Roman Glanum. For those of you wanting to cycle more and visit another Roman ruin we offer the opportunity to ride to the Pont du Gard’s younger brother the Pont du Barbegal.\n\nHotel: Mas de l’Oulivié\n\nDay 3\n\nWhere: Les Baux-de-Provence to Gordes\n\nTerrain: Hilly\n\nRide: 32/46 mi or 51/73 km\n\nMeals: B, L\n\nWe head east into the Vaucluse region of Provence towards our base for the next couple of days Gordes. After bridging the Durance we head past some of the quieter but best villages of Provence. Oppede le Vieux is one such village whose medieval ghost town is a must wander after lunch. Menerbes is another and offers so much more than just being the setting for the Peter Mayle book. Our destination is Gordes which clings to the side of the Vaucluse plateau. The houses are arranged in tiers around an imposing Renaissance castle and so it is easy to appreciate why the village is considered a jewel of Provence.\n\nHotel: Mas des Rosmarins\n\nDay 4\n\nWhere: Gordes loop to Roussillon\n\nTerrain: Rolling Hills\n\nRide: 30/57 mi or 48/92 km\n\nMeals: B, D\n\nGordes great location gives us great access to some spectacular riding. Today we enjoy a short loop to the villages of Saint Saturnin-les-Apt and Roussillon. Roussillon is known as the ocre-red village which contrasts fantastically with the deep green pine forests we cycle through on route. The optional extra loop takes us deep into the Provincial hinterland as we head towards more of our local favorites - Viens and Saint Martin de Castillon.\n\nHotel: Mas des Rosmarins\n\nDay 5\n\nWhere: Gordes loop to Bonnieux and Lourmarin\n\nTerrain: Hilly\n\nRide:32/48 mi or 52/77 km\n\nMeals: B, D\n\nOnce again we find a series of quiet and picturesque routes as we continue our discovery of Provence’s most beautiful villages. We ride first to the village of Lacoste for a coffee and a great view of the surrounding area. From here we climb up to Bonnieux before descending into Lourmarin for lunch under its Chateau. The cycling is again spectacular and the villages we pass through embody the essence of what this part of Provence is all about.\n\nHotel: Mas des Rosmarins\n\nDay 6\n\nWhere: Gordes to Mazan\n\nTerrain: Rolling Hills\n\nRide: 26/47 mi or 42/75 km\n\nMeals: B, L, D\n\nWe leave Gordes and head north, cruising past the Abbaye Notre-Dame de Senaque on our way to Venasque. After enjoying fantastic countryside riders can choose to head directly north to Mazan or take the longer meander over the Col de Murs. Today’s options are a little shorter considering the optional challenge tomorrow of Mont Ventoux! Tonight we stay in the Chateau Mazan, once home to the Marquis de Sade! Don’t worry he no longer has any involvement in the running of the hotel!\n\nHotel: Chateau de Mazan\n\nDay 7\n\nWhere: Mazan loop to Gorges de la Nesque or Mount Ventoux\n\nTerrain: Mountains\n\nRide: 20/39/43 mi or 32/63/70 km\n\nMeals: B, D\n\nOur final day on the bike takes us towards the monolith known as Mont Ventoux as we head north towards Bedoin. For the foolhardy and the brave this iconic Tour de France climb is an option. For those of you looking for a more relaxing end to the tour we will skirt around the mountain known to the locals as ‘the Giant of Provence’ and up one of the best cycling roads in France - the Gorges de la Nesque. Here we will picnic overlooking the spectacular ravine before re-joining the hill climbers and returning to our Chateau in Mazan for a final delectable dinner.\n\nHotel: Chateau de Mazan\n\nDay 8\n\nWhere: Avignon\n\nTerrain: Departure\n\nRide: None\n\nMeals: B\n\nAfter a leisurely breakfast, we organize a shuttle to the TGV train station on the outskirts of Avignon from where fast trains can be caught to a number of European cities.\n\nHow to Get There\n\nAirport/s - Paris (CDG)\n\nThe international airport of Paris Charles de Gaulle is the best hub to get to the starting point of the tour by train. You will meet your guides at Avignon TGV train station.\n\nHow to Depart\n\nAirport/s -Paris (CDG)\n\nPrivate transfer by Tourissimo to the Avignon TGV train station. Upon request, guests can be taken elsewhere (additional cost).\n\nTour Level\n\nRecreational/Active/Athletic - Active: 20 to 50 mi a day along rolling and hilly terrain. Climb to Mount Ventoux is very challenging but optional. Recreational rides can opt for the E-Wheel (pedal assist solution) and with that, they will be fine riding this itinerary.\n\nTour Price\n\nTour price per person in double room is USD 4,195\n\nPrivate room surcharge is USD 600\n\nPleasecontact our office if:\n\n- The tour you are interested in is scheduled to start within 90 days\n\n- You would like to make this tour private\n\n- You would like to choose your own dates\n\nClimate Data\n\nIn June, temperatures average 13C (56F) low / 26C (79F) max - precipitation probability 13%.\n\nInfo about food and wine\n\nWith a strong Italian and Spanish influence the cuisine of Provence has a distinctive flair that sets it apart from more classic French fare. Blessed with an abundance of natural ingredients that flourish in the region, Provence is unsurpassed for the freshness of its produce and variety of its dishes.\n\nFor starters you could try a sweet Cavaillon melon or one of the classified goats cheeses of the region accompanied with some fresh figs. Alternatively, you could sample a selection of tapenades on some crispy hot toast or perhaps you’d prefer a simple but exquisite pistou (basil) soup.\n\nMoving on you could stay light with a Nicoise salad or if you’d prefer to sample something richer the regions signature dish bouillabaisse or daube (beef stew) might suit. As an accompaniment, the black diamond – truffle- could add an extra complexity to the mix that is already accented by fragrant herbs and rich olive oils.\n\nAnd to finish it off the master Chocolatier Joel Durand in St Remy could sate your sweet tooth or perhaps the master Nougatier Boyer of Sault might provide a lighter option. Or just keep it simple with some anis candles or marrons glaces (crystallized chestnuts).\n\nWhatever you choose we are sure that you will be blown away by the freshness and flavours that permeate Provençal cuisine and that’s before we even start talking about the wines to accompany it.\n\nProvence is one of France’s serious fine wine regions, on a par with Bordeaux and Burgundy. The wines from Provence appear under 3 prefixes Coteaux D’Aix en-, Côtes de- and Les Baux de Provence – all of which you will have a chance to sample on this tour. In contrast to the cultured power of Bordeaux and the elegance of Burgundy, Provençal red wines are earthier with an almost rustic flavour. In this respect they are really interesting since quality commercial wine making is balanced by a real sense of identity.\n\nOn our tour we will cycle through some of the most prestigious wine areas that this region has to offer with a focus on the Southern Rhone, the small Les Baux appellation and Côtes de Ventoux. Since wine has been produced in the region for over 2600 years there is a large variety of grapes used in production. We look forward to introducing you to the plethora of wines on offer."
