Hotel for travellers looking for local and authentic experiences

Mercure Paris Roissy Charles de Gaulle immerses you in a quintessentially Parisian decor - with nods to Montmartre, the Citroën 2CV, Haussmannian boulevards and works by local artists. Our hotel in Roissy-en-France offers 5 meeting rooms and a large car park. During your downtime, relax on the terrace or play a game of billiards, table tennis, Wii or pinball. Savour products from the local market at breakfast, and taste the selection of wines in Before Paris - our restaurant and in-house brewery.

Under 30 minutes from Parc Asterix and Disney, Châteaux de Chantilly and Ecouen, Stade de France, Oise Impressionist Valley (Van Gogh Museum). New: Roissy International Golf 18 holes, 5 minutes away.
