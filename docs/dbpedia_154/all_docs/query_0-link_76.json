She would give the shirt off her own back to a friend or even a stranger in need. She loved to laugh. Her children often joked that they could never get lost, all they had to do was listen for a minute and follow her laughter from a mile away. Judy was funny, sassy, and danced to the beat of her own drum. She loved to garden, she loved walks in the woods, and her animals. Her greatest joys were living on the small farm in Wythe County and at the cabin on Bent Mountain. Judy was fiercely proud of her children and grandchildren. Judy leaves behind her former spouse, John Timothy Frye I; their children, Deborah Frye (Rodney) Reedy, Mary Grace Heath, and John Timothy Frye II; grandchildren, Timothy Justin (Yvonne) Frye, Christopher Thomas (Emilee) Martin, Kathryn Iris Heath, Jacob Sebastian Reedy, Marc Curtis Reedy, Arabella Rain Heath; 3 great great-grandchildren; and many loving cousins, nieces, nephews, step-children and friends.

We commit her to you dear Father to live in perfect peace for eternity. Amen.
