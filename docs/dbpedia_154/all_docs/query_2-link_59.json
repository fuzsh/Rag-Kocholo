        "text": "Recollections of Florida State's legendary coach\n\nThe Times-Union and Jacksonville.com asked readers what they'll remember most about Bobby Bowden, who coaches his final game today in the Konica Minolta Gator Bowl at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. Here are several of your responses. Some were edited because of length:\n\nAmong the several autographed Bowden memorabilia that we've collected is a very special portrait that honors that 1993 championship season. When we mentioned to Coach Bowden that, although we have been FSU season ticket holders for many years, we actually graduated from The Ohio State University. Coach Bowden wrote: \"To Jim and M.V... Go, Ohio State!' and signed his name. We believe no other coach to be that gracious.\n\nJim and M.V. Wendell, Fleming Island\n\nI was a student at a small Baptist junior college in the mountains of Virginia when a very young football coach named Bobby Bowden came to speak at one of our chapel services. This was long before FSU. After it was over, we all felt like we had been to an old-time revival instead of the usual staid meeting. I had never even heard of this guy. I have never been a fan of any Florida college teams, but since that day I've been a huge fan of St. Bobby. He will be missed.\n\nJohn Bishop, Satsuma\n\nAs most people know, Bobby Bowden played quarterback for Howard College (now Samford) in Alabama. I was a freshman playing defensive end at FSU at the same time Bobby was playing at Howard. In one of many conversations I have had with Bobby, he asked, \"Jim, do you know why FSU beat Howard in 1950? It was because you kept me on my back, and I couldn't complete any passes.\" I had no idea who the quarterback was or that it was Bobby Bowden. He remembered, I didn't. It was nice he mentioned it to me, and it made me feel good.\n\nJim Arnold, Lake City\n\nI was co-captain of the '63 team, so have known Bobby for years. As president of the FSU Foundation in '94, I traveled with Bobby on his spring golf tour to the various boosters golf tournaments. If anyone wonders why he has lasted this long, it is because he is the king of the power nap. Give him a 30-minute nap in the late afternoon and he is the Energizer Bunny for the next several hours. That's why at 80 he's still going strong.\n\nCharles Calhoun, Jacksonville\n\nWe lived in Tallahassee from 1996 through 2001. My wife is an alumna. That was a dream time for us.\n\nAlong with his coaching on the sidelines, my fondest memories of Bobby were his Monday noontime lunches at the Civic Center in Tallahassee. They were always fun and exciting and of course very motivational as you heard it directly from the man himself.\n\nNelson Harbin, Jacksonville\n\nCoach Bowden and I both arrived at FSU in 1976. You know his role; mine was as a transfer student from Manatee Jr. College. During my tenure at FSU as a student, he was my Sunday school teacher. I attended every game (rain or shine) and sat in the old metal bleachers.\n\nSeveral years later in 2002, I had the pleasure of hosting a party for him at my Marsh Landing home. The most embarrassing moment of the evening was when my 2-year-old grandson knocked 32 golf balls out of a trophy case. I stood there in horror as they fell like dominoes at Coach's feet. He burst out laughing and said he felt right at home since he has so many grandchildren. Over the years there have been many dinners, receptions, trips with the team, and tournaments. The most exciting for me was playing in his foursome at a fund-raiser during the \"Florida Swing.\" Being the only girl I was a little nervous, but after he sliced a few drives, three-putted some greens, and let a few DADGUMITS fly, I knew there was nothing to fear. He told me once that Ann (his wife) likes to shop too much. I told him that is not a bad thing, it helps to stimulate the economy. At least that's what I tell my husband.\n\nNancy White, Fleming Island\n\nIt was the early 1980s and there had been an overnight fire in the FSU locker room. I was a \"first year\" field reporter for the ABC affiliate in Tallahassee (WECA-TV) and was sent to Bobby Bowden's home to get a response from him. He was already a revered coach at that time and I was so nervous. Coach Bowden opened his front door and graciously answered questions. He was sincere and kind, and did not seem bothered at all that a news crew was sent to his house. Many years later, my son won a \"Got Milk\" contest that earned him the opportunity to interview Coach Bowden in his office at the stadium. My entire family was invited inside and he treated all of us like we were his friends. Coach Bowden patiently answered questions from a 9-year-old and acted like he had all the time in the world for us. We feel blessed that we had the chance to meet this wonderful, generous man: a true legend, Bobby Bowden.\n\nCindy Kidder, Fletcher High School, Neptune Beach\n\nI grew up in Birmingham, Ala., and went to Barrett Grammar School with coach Bobby Bowden. We lived in Jacksonville for many years, but the last 10 years, I have gone back to Birmingham to attend an annual barbecue that was put on by Woodlawn High School graduates to benefit college scholarships. Coach Bowden and his wife, Ann, have always attended these barbecues and have been the guests of honor. [Bowden] is a remarkable person, and has always amazed me that he remembers all his old school friends, and can always call your name, even when you may go several years without seeing him. Bobby and Ann have been an inspiration to many, and are loved by all who have had the opportunity to know them. My son, Dan Frey, was able to get tickets to the Gator Bowl game, and will be bringing me. I consider it a real privilege to have known Bobby since first grade, and surely did not want to miss his retiring game as coach. He has been an outstanding coach and his memory will live on at FSU, and with everyone who has had the blessing to know him.\n\nPeggy Brooker Talbert, Jacksonville\n\nMy favorite memories of Coach Bobby Bowden:\n\n1. Beating Florida 37-9 in Gainesville in 1977. FSU's first victory in Gainesville\n\n2. 14 straight years finishing on the top 4 in the country. Never done before, and may never be matched.\n\n3. Bobby never allowed Steve Spurrier to win in Tallahassee.\n\nCraig Henderson, Jacksonville\n\nI wish today's coaches were more like Mr. Bowden. No chest-thumping or fist-waving. Just smile and a matter-of-fact way of speaking to others and respectfully showing us through the media that you can be the best without shouting. As Roosevelt used to say, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick!\" He did that. Mr. Bobby Bowden, thank you for all you did for college football and the showing us that no matter what the circumstances - good or bad. That there's always tomorrow and a lot of memories. Take care and God bless.\n\nTukz Taaca, Jacksonville\n\nYou asked for stories for Bobby Bowden - here's mine.\n\nI moved to Orange Park from Massachusetts in October 1998 and within a week a neighbor asked whether I was a 'Noles fan, a Gators Fan or a Bulldogs fan. I told him to check back with me in a few weeks. I watched a television interview with Steve Spurrier soon after that, and for a loss he blamed the players for not executing. A later interview with Bobby Bowden, whose team also lost, had Bowden taking the blame, stating that he had not properly prepared the team. Bowden, based on just that statement, was the coach that I wanted to support.\n\nJon Haas, Orange Park\n\nI was the captain of the cheerleading squad when Coach Bowden was hired. Although I did not get to cheer under his reign, my partner and I had the privilege of being his escorts when he was first introduced to the fans for the first time. It was Jan. 1976 at an FSU basketball game. I do not remember who we played, but we walked out on either side of Coach Bowden in old Tully gym to center court. While we were waiting for the introduction, he talked with us with genuine attention as though we were more than just the college students that we were. Many years later, we met again and he told me he remembered me. Whether or not he did, he convinced me!\n\nElaine Crapps, '76\n\nMy most vivid memory is meeting him in the studio of a radio station I worked at in Tallahassee in 1980, and additionally at several subsequent meetings with him at Seminole Radio Network functions. He always took the time to speak and give more than lip service to people he barely knew or did not even know. If he did not know you, he'd ask a question to get to know you, and if he did know you, he'd ask something about how you were doing. He never spoke to you in a dismissive way or as if he was looking for the next hand to shake. Genuine sincerity is what I take from that.\n\nAs for his legacy, perhaps the greatest thing he has shown is the ability to lose with grace and dignity. I don't recall him ever making excuses or losing his temper inappropriately in those wide-right and wide-left losses to Miami that cost him several national championship opportunities, or the Oklahoma, Florida and Tennessee national championship games. Since West Virginia should win the Gator Bowl, and if they do, I am sure we will see another lesson in humility and grace from coach Bowden. This is a great lesson to be learned by many.\n\nBrian M. Rowland, Jacksonville\n\nBest memory was interview with the coach after the 1994 31-31 \"Choke at Doak\" tie with Florida. The best game ever. Coach declared the game a victory. I went from totally ticked off to elated during the game.\n\nDon Camp, '67, Milwaukee, Wis.\n\nI was attending the annual Garnet and Gold Banquet in Tallahassee. The banquet was to introduce the football players and coaching staff for the 2005 season. I had my 11/2 year old grandson, Justin Lee, with me along with my wife and daughter-in-law. After giving the normal introductions and season predictions, it became time for us to line up for autographs and pictures with some of the attendees. We took Justin to get a picture with Coach Bowden as we have the previous two years.\n\nAs soon as he saw Justin, Coach held out his arms, and said \"Come here boy and give me some sugar.\"\n\nWhile he was holding Justin, I asked Justin, \"what does Coach Bowden say?\"\n\nIn a low mumbled voice Justin said. \"dad-gummit.\"\n\nBeside himself, Coach replied, \"What did he just say?\"\n\nI asked Justin again. This time, in a loud firm voice, he said \"DAD-GUMMIT !\"\n\nCoach gave a loud laugh and stated, \"Of all the great things I have done, is my legacy going to be remembered through one word?\"\n\nTed Lee, Jacksonville\n\nThank you for the opportunity to express my feelings about Bobby Bowden. Everyone knows what a great football coach he has been over the years. He is, however, an even more wonderful Christian man. Years ago when my husband was gravely ill and in the hospital, Bobby took the time to write to him and send him an autographed picture. When he died, Bobby wrote a letter to me expressing his sympathy over Charlie's death. I will never forget him for that. We have been loyal fans of his ever since our son, Rick Goodman, graduated from FSU. To Bobby: Congratulations on your retirement and thank you for all the enjoyment you brought to me and my family. From your biggest fan.\n\nNeva Goodman\n\nI was in graduate school at Florida State in 1980-81 and worked at Killearn Golf & Country club where Coach Bowden was a member one summer. When he would come to the course to play, he was always very gracious and humble and would always make you feel like you were just one of the guys. He also came to my church several years ago when I lived in Orlando and preached the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. He never once mentioned football, but was more concerned about reaching people with his message. Coach Bowden is a great football coach and really put Florida State on the map, but I will remember him for his kindness, humility and most of all, his love for the Lord!\n\nRichard Longden, Jacksonville\n\nAbout 25 years ago, I was in Tallahassee on business. One evening I was on the second floor of a department store looking for the men's department. The whole floor was deserted, as I walked along eating from a large bag of popcorn. All of a sudden I heard someone say: \"Hey, I thought you told me that you weren't going to eat any more of that fattening stuff.\" As I looked around I couldn't see anyone, when the voice said: \"Over here.\" Then I saw Bobby Bowden sitting all alone next to a long table loaded with cook books authored by Mrs. Bowden. Evidently Bobby was there to help her promote the books and probably sign them. But no one else had showed up yet. I guess that Bobby was lonesome there all by himself and just wanted to talk to someone, even if it was just me, a stranger. Well, naturally, I went over and we had a great conversation, just Bobby and me for about 15 minutes until Mrs. B arrived with some other ladies. Naturally that was the end of my \"15 minutes of fame\" with BB. He was so gracious, pleasant and friendly with me, a complete stranger. From then on, to me, he was always \"Bobby Bowden, my friend.\"\n\nJack Cassidy, Orange Park\n\nIt was not uncommon to see college coaches visiting Ed White High School on recruiting trips when Dan Disch was the football coach there from 1988-2003. Since football players were often in my senior English class, I had the opportunity to converse with an occasional coach or two, like Ron Zook. One day I spotted Lou Holtz in the main office talking to Coach Disch, and on another day I spotted Terry Bowden heading down one of the hallways. One of my highlights, though, was chatting briefly in the hall with Bobby Bowden. Coach Bowden exudes a warmth that makes those speaking to him feel as if he's known them for years. His direct eye contact, listening skills and laugh exhibit a personality bigger than life. He seemed to love young people and be interested in them developing character as much as their athletic ability. It was a thrill to speak to him and be able to say that I met Bobby Bowden. His coaching days may be over, but the lessons he taught will remain with his players for a lifetime."
