Despite playing six NCAA playoff teams on its 10-game schedule, UNA boasted one of the nation's premier defensive units in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Willis and the Lions followed with a strong 7-3 record in the team's first season as a member of the Division I Football Championship Subdivision. UNA opened the season with a 34-30 road win at Southern Utah in the Lions' first game as an FCS member and the Lions followed with a 25-20 road win at state rival Alabama A&M.
