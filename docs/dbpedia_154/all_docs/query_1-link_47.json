        "text": "At given times in college football history, the football talent at Florida universities has been staggering.\n\nBut with the recent hirings at South Florida and Florida Atlantic, college coaching in the Sunshine State is now at an unprecedented level.\n\nA bold statement to be sure, especially considering an era in the 1990s when Bobby Bowden (Florida State), Steve Spurrier (Florida) and Dennis Erickson (Miami) were working at the same time and eventually combined to win five national championships and 19 conference titles.\n\nBut the rest of the state’s college programs were going through different challenges at the time, mostly related to attempts to establish some kind of toehold in a state dominated by the three programs Bowden once called “Big Florida.”\n\nNow, fast-forward to the Labor Day weekend of 2017. When the new college football season begins, there will be seven coaches in Florida who have had previous head coaching or coordinator jobs at other Power 5 conference schools, and five who either led staffs or were coordinators for national championship teams.\n\nWhen South Florida hired Charlie Strong after he was fired at Texas; Florida Atlantic plucked Lane Kiffin away from Alabama, where he was the offensive coordinator; and Florida International brought Butch Davis back from exile into Miami again, it created a dream team of coaches that already includes Jimbo Fisher at FSU, Jim McElwain at Florida, Mark Richt at Miami and Scott Frost at Central Florida.\n\nAnd prospects in Florida should be prepared for the sales pitches of their lives, from all corners of the state. Every coach has a reputation as a good recruiter and with Kiffin, Davis and Strong now in the mix, “Big Florida” coaches – Fisher, McElwain and Richt – surely can’t relax.\n\nDavis and Strong are returning to the state where they made their initial coaching chops. Davis was the Miami coach from 1995-2000, where he laid the groundwork for the teams that won a national championship in 2001 and reached the championship game in 2002 under Larry Coker. Strong was the defensive coordinator at Florida for two national championships won under Urban Meyer in 2006 and 2008. Strong also had two stints at UF working for Steve Spurrier.\n\nKiffin also has Florida ties. His ex-wife Layla is a University of Florida graduate and he was an offensive quality-control coach for the Jaguars under Tom Coughlin in 2000.\n\nOddly enough, three of the coaches (Richt, Frost and Kiffin) were born in Nebraska and none in Florida. Five were college quarterbacks, with Strong and Davis playing on defense. Only Richt is coaching at his alma mater.\n\nFour of the coaches came from coaching trees first planted in Florida, Richt and Fisher from Bowden, Davis from Jimmy Johnson at Miami and Strong having strong ties to Spurrier.\n\nOne thing they are likely to have in common: it won’t be dull.\n\nJimbo Fisher, Florida State\n\nBorn: Clarksburg, W.Va.\n\nPlayer: Samford quarterback.\n\nHead coach: FSU, 2010-present.\n\nNational titles: FSU 2013 (head coach); LSU 2003 (offensive coordinator).\n\nPrevious state ties: None in coaching but long-standing relationship with Bowden family.\n\nFired: Left with the rest of Terry Bowden’s staff after Bowden was fired at Auburn in 1998.\n\nKnown for: Developing NFL quarterbacks (four first-round picks) and defending Jameis Winston.\n\nWhat you didn’t know: Played in Arena Football League for the Chicago Bruisers.\n\nJim McElwain, Florida\n\nBorn: Missoula, Mont.\n\nPlayer: Eastern Washington quarterback.\n\nHead coach: Colorado State, 2012-2014; Florida, 2015-present.\n\nNational titles: Alabama, 2009 and 20011 (offensive coordinator).\n\nPrevious state ties: None until hired by UF.\n\nFired: In 2006 from Art Shell’s staff with Oakland Raiders.\n\nKnown for: Running offenses and developing quarterbacks at such diverse places as Montana State, Michigan State, Louisville, Alabama and Fresno State.\n\nWhat you didn’t know: College roommate with radio/TV sports personality Colin Cowherd.\n\nMark Richt, Miami\n\nBorn: Omaha, Neb.\n\nPlayer: Miami quarterback.\n\nHead coach: Georgia, 2001-2015; Miami 2016.\n\nNational titles: FSU, 1993 (QBs coach) and 1999 (coordinator).\n\nPrevious state ties: Played at Miami 1979-1982; graduate assistant at FSU 1985-1988.\n\nFired: From Georgia at end of the regular season in 2015.\n\nKnown for: Being Jim Kelly’s backup at Miami and coaching two Heisman Trophy quarterbacks, Charlie Ward and Chris Weinke.\n\nWhat you didn’t know: He and his wife Katharyn have adopted two children from the Ukraine.\n\nScott Frost, Central Florida\n\nBorn: Wood River, Neb.\n\nPlayer: Stanford and Nebraska quarterback.\n\nHead coach: UCF 2016.\n\nNational titles: None as a coach.
