        "text": "American football player and coach (born 1954)\n\nTommy Pearce Bowden ( ; born July 10, 1954) is a former American football coach. He served as the head coach at Clemson University from 1999 until October 13, 2008. He is a son of Bobby Bowden, former head football coach of Florida State University, against whom he coached in games nicknamed the \"Bowden Bowl.\" He is also a brother of Terry Bowden, who served as the head coach of Auburn.\n\nBefore coming to Clemson, Bowden was the head coach at Tulane University, and an assistant at the University of Alabama, Auburn University, Duke University, the University of Kentucky, East Carolina University and, with his father, at Florida State. His 1998 Tulane squad went 12–0 and achieved a top-10 final ranking in both polls. Despite being one of only two undefeated teams in the regular season, Tulane was not even considered for a bid in a Bowl Championship Series game because it was believed they had not played a difficult schedule.\n\nBowden was hired as Clemson's head coach before the 1999 season. Bowden's Clemson teams went to a bowl game every year he coached there, except in 2004, when, after a brawl with rival South Carolina, both teams withdrew from bowl consideration for that season. He resigned on October 13, 2008, after leading the team to a disappointing 3–3 record (1–2 ACC) at the midpoint of a season in which the Tigers had been an almost unanimous preseason pick to win their first ACC title under Bowden and were ranked #9 in the preseason polls. Assistant head coach/wide receivers coach Dabo Swinney was named as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. In ten seasons, Bowden led the Tigers to zero conference championships, finishing only as high as second in the conference twice and second in the Atlantic division three times.\n\nBowden attended and played football for West Virginia University from 1972 through 1976. He is married to Linda White and has two children, Ryan and Lauren. He is a son of former Florida State Seminoles head coach, the late Bobby Bowden and has two sisters and three brothers, including Terry, former head coach at Auburn University , and Jeff, who served as an assistant coach on his brother Terry's staff. Bowden is an evangelical Christian.[1][2]\n\nYear Team Overall Conference Standing Bowl/playoffs Coaches# AP° Tulane Green Wave (Conference USA) (1997–1998) 1997 Tulane 7–4 5–1 2nd 1998 Tulane 12–0 6–0 1st Liberty 7 7 Tulane: 19–4 11–1 Clemson Tigers (Atlantic Coast Conference) (1999–2008) 1999 Clemson 6–6 5–3 2nd L Peach 2000 Clemson 9–3 6–2 2nd L Gator 14 16 2001 Clemson 7–5 4–4 T–4th W Humanitarian 2002 Clemson 7–6 4–4 T–5th L Tangerine 2003 Clemson 9–4 5–3 3rd W Peach 22 22 2004 Clemson 6–5 4–4 T–6th Declined* 2005 Clemson 8–4 4–4 3rd (Atlantic) W Champs Sports 21 21 2006 Clemson 8–5 5–3 T–2nd (Atlantic) L Music City 2007 Clemson 9–4 5–3 2nd (Atlantic) L Chick-fil-A 22 21 2008 Clemson 3–3‡ 1–2 T–2nd (Atlantic) Clemson: 72–45 43–32 Total: 90–49 National championship Conference title Conference division title or championship game berth\n\n#Rankings from final Coaches Poll.\n\n°Rankings from final AP Poll."
