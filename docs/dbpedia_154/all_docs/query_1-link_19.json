        "text": "Along with Saturday's spirited, sporting tunes from the college marching bands of Auburn and Southern Mississippi, you could almost hear the My Three Sons theme from Fred MacMurray's 1960s television sitcom.\n\nBut this show stars Bobby Bowden.\n\nAt 63, he coaches a Florida State (4-0) team that ranks a landslide No. 1 in every poll except Gallup. On a rare September weekend vacation for his Seminoles, the famous Tallahassee football chief came to Auburn for a little family get-together.\n\nDid I say little?\n\nThis is a warm, winning story that centers on Coach Bobby and Ann, his wife of 44 years. They are the genesis of the \"Bowden Bunch,\" an immersed-in-football clan that is enjoying dramatic growth, in numbers and professional scope.\n\nTerry Bowden, a 37-year-old son, has a shocking 4-0 record in his inaugural season as Auburn head coach. Tommy, a second Bowden son, is a member of Terry's coaching staff. Another of Bobby's sons, Jeff, coaches for Southern Miss, the Tigers' latest victim.\n\nNostalgia warmed a Bowden Bunch weekend. Family stories flowed. Tears occasionally trickled. Grandchildren laughed and screamed. Bowdens hugged endlessly. It's too bad, at football work, that anybody had to lose.\n\nJust ask USM's Jeff.\n\nJordan-Hare Stadium was landscaped generously with a Bowden family tree. \"What an unbelievable reunion,\" patriarch Bobby said. \"Twenty-six of us Bowdens gathering to watch and coach football with 83,000 of our best friends.\"\n\nABC-TV taped a feature on the coaching Bowdens. It was shown at halftime of the network's four regional Saturday football telecasts.\n\nThere was mucho Auburn weekend cuddling. As FSU's coach held Terry's 3-year-old daughter, Jordan, on a knee, Bobby cooed, \"Are you Granddaddy's girl?\" A tiny blond head nodded. At one point, Boss 'Nole was happily smothered by 13 of his 15 grandkids. \"Is this heaven?\" Bobby asked. Then he nodded.\n\nOkay, the Bowden Bunch lineup. . . .\n\nTerry was boosted by \"War Eagle\" cheers from his wife, Shryl, and three of his four daughters. Tera Dawn, 11, lives in West Virginia with Terry's former wife.\n\nTommy Bowden, who coaches his younger brother's wide receivers, came to work Saturday with his wife, Linda, and two children dressed in Auburn orange and blue.\n\n\"Ann and me being Alabama natives,\" papa Bobby said, \"it was almost too great to be true when Terry got this head coaching shot at Auburn.\" Terry had been at Samford University, where his father coached and played.\n\nAs all the Bowdens know, Terry got his chance because Auburn was in NCAA trouble. Former coach Pat Dye was washed out by a play-for-pay scandal involving former Tiger Eric Ramsey. With the SEC school headed for NCAA probation, there was a dearth of big-time coaching names interested in succeeding Dye.\n\n\"I'm honored,\" Terry said.\n\nAuburn is banned from bowls this season and next. Games in 1993 cannot be shown live on television. Supporters of the Tigers were braced for a bruised beginning to the Bowden era. So far, it has been anything but.\n\nTerry's squad isn't in the talent league with SEC rivals Alabama, Florida and Tennessee. Nonetheless, Auburn ranks 25th nationally with wins over Ole Miss, LSU, Samford and Southern Mississippi, 35-24 Saturday. Vanderbilt is next, presenting a legitimate chance to go 5-0.\n\nNepotism ran gloriously amok.\n\nJack Hines, defensive backfield coach on Terry's staff, is married to 42-year-old Robyn Bowden, eldest of six Bobby/Ann offspring. Robyn perched in a press box booth with her two kids, alongside Terry's brood and Tommy's.\n\nJeff Bowden wore the gold and black of USM. He plotted against Terry and Tommy. Shouts for the visiting Golden Eagles from Jeff's wife, Luann, and their two children were swallowed by the roars of 80,000 or so Auburn backers.\n\nBut there was moral support.\n\n\"I'd sat on Auburn's side for the Southern Miss game last year,\" matriarch Ann Bowden said, \"so Bobby and I, to be fair, are in the hot sun with Luann and Eagle rooters this time. It's hard to be neutral.\"\n\nTruth is, Mom wanted Auburn to win because Terry has such a fabulous head coaching opportunity and he's a little older than USM's 34-year-old Jeff. \"Let's just say,\" Ann chimed in, \"that I wanted the right thing to happen.\"\n\nBobby recalled: \"Last year, when Jeff and Southern Miss beat Auburn, where Tommy was coaching, Ann got a little mad at Jeffrey. She figures the older child should win and the younger one's time will come. Me? I just want their games to be well-coached.\"\n\nAnn added: \"It's not real fun seeing your family pitted head-to-head. Now that Terry's at Auburn, I'm glad FSU no longer plays the Tigers.\" Dad has never coached against a son, but in 1995, Bobby's FSU is to play Southern Miss. \"If Jeff's still there, it'll frankly be tougher on Mom than me,\" the senior coaching Bowden said.\n\nNot all Bowdens make their daily bread as football coaches. Daughter Ginger is married to Fort Walton Beach hotel entrepreneur John Madden (honest, that's his name). They came to Jordan-Hare with two children.\n\nBobby and Ann's oldest son, 41-year-old Steve, is an educator with a Ph.D. who until recently was teaching at Flagler College in St. Augustine.\n\n\"He's going through a divorce,\" Bobby said. \"That's never easy on anybody.\" Steve came to the Auburn-USM weekend with two of his three children. He has relocated near Birmingham, where the youngsters live with his former wife.\n\nFriday night, Bobby and Ann slept at Tommy's house. \"Terry and Jack are building new homes,\" FSU's coach said. \"Tommy preceded Terry to Auburn as a member of Dye's staff, so he's already situated.\"\n\nWhen the entire Bowden Bunch convenes, there may be no mansion in the \"Loveliest Village on the Plain\" with sufficient space for a family feeding. On Tigers-Eagles eve, everybody but Jeff _ who had to stay in nearby LaGrange, Ga., with his USM team _ dined en masse and informally at a Shoney's restaurant on Highway 29 between Opelika and Auburn.\n\n\"Enter at your own risk,\" a grinning Bobby Bowden warned a Shoney's customer. \"You might get hit by a flying french fry.\" Family adults sat at a long table, Bowden grandkids crammed into booths across the aisle.\n\nFriday morning, FSU's coach began a noisy family weekend by huddling with Terry in a quiet, dark room to critique videotapes of the Tigers' upset win at LSU.\n\n\"I saw an offensive scheme very similar to what we used at Florida State when Peter Tom Willis and Casey Weldon were our quarterbacks,\" the elder Bowden said. \"We're doing things a little differently now to fit the unique skills of (quarterback) Charlie Ward.\"\n\nTerry's handsome office in Auburn's red-brick football building overlooks two practice fields. He works at a round desk. \"I still call this Coach Dye's office,\" he said, \"but I'm adjusting.\" On a wall is a beautifully matched pair of Bowden photos, of Terry holding a clipboard as Samford coach in 1988 and Bobby with the same pose, same prop and same job 25 years earlier.\n\nSitting on a coffee table was Saint Bobby and the Barbarians, the hardback history of his father's extraordinary 17-year FSU career. Inside the front cover, an autograph says: \"To Terry _ God Bless You and Your Family. I Love You.\" It is signed \"Dad.\"\n\nIt's a no-brainer to wonder if Terry Bowden someday might be considered to succeed his pop at FSU. \"I doubt that,\" Bobby said. \"If Terry is successful at Auburn, why would he want to leave? If he's not, Florida State probably wouldn't be interested.\"\n\nBobby Bowden is a 5-foot-8 man, and 5-6 Terry looks up to him as both a coach and father. FSU's leader, in his 24th season as a head coach, has a record of 230-77-3 (.749). Terry, beginning his 10th, is 68-35-1 (.660).\n\nTerry arose from Friday game-plan polishing to pluck three small, well-aged booklets from his developing office archives. \"These are my treasures,\" he said. They were note pads from 1956-57-58, kept by then-unknown Bobby Bowden who was at a junior college in Douglas, Ga., and would spend a week each summer jotting down ideas at FSU coaching clinics put on by Tom Nugent, then chief of the football 'Noles.\n\nThere are a lot of crude X's and O's on those notebook pages, drawn by Bobby in his late 20s. He scribbled, during an FSU clinic session by then-Michigan State coach Duffy Daugherty, \"Have your men clap their hands when they break from huddle.\"\n\nBowden laughed at his notes 35 years later. \"That was some hot, inside information I was taking back to South Georgia College,\" he said. \"Clap your hands and win.\" But it was knowledge that mushroomed and led to a world of Bowden glory that is yet to cease in Tallahassee.\n\nNow he's branching out.\n\nBOWDEN'S COACHING SONS\n\nTERRY BOWDEN\n\nBorn: Feb. 24, 1956, Douglas, Ga.\n\nPosition: Auburn head coach.\n\nAs a player: West Virginia running back, 1977-78.\n\nAs a coach: Graduate coaching assistant, Florida State, 1979-82; head coach, Salem (W.
