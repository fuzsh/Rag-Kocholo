        "text": "The first thing you notice when you walk in\n\nTerry Bowden's\n\noffice is the trophy perched on his desk, facing the door.\n\nIt's a bronze bust, wrapped in two purple-and-gold ties.\n\nThe 1993 Bear Bryant Award is meant for recruits, Bowden said, but what exactly does it mean for the new head coach at North Alabama?\n\nSixteen years ago, he won the bust as the Division I national coach of the year after going 11-0 in his debut season at Auburn.\n\nSo he knows how to win.\n\nEleven years ago, he was the bust, the rookie phenom who flamed out and cut his losses in the middle of his sixth Auburn season.\n\nWhat has he lost in the interim?\n\nHe hasn't coached a game since Oct. 17, 1998, at Florida, in The Swamp, as good a place as any for a murky ending, but here he is, after a decade-long sabbatical, sitting behind that desk, staring down at that yellow legal pad of scholarship numbers, talking a blue streak under that helmet of graying hair.\n\nHe's smack dab in the middle of a new beginning at age 53.\n\n\"I feel like I'm 30,\" he said. \"A lot of times, you sit back and say, 'What did I just do?' But I'm more excited now than I was when I got here.\"\n\nHe's already had wristbands made for the players and coaches that contain the letters \"WWCD.\" Translation: What would a champion do?\n\nHe's had nameplates made for the coaches. On the side the coaches see while sitting at their desks, it says, \"Is what I'm doing right now helping UNA win a national championship?\"\n\nRight place, right time\n\nHis voice goes from 0 to 60 in seconds as he describes spending the night on his office couch, living with associate head coach and younger brother Jeff, calling coaching contacts across the country in search of talented transfers, taking his offensive staff to visit with old friend Mike Leach at Texas Tech and planning for the first Day with the Bowdens in July when father Bobby and his three coaching sons will gather here to raise money for UNA.\n\n\"He gets up at 4 in the morning,\" Jeff said. \"His work ethic is just unbelievable. A mile a minute. That's my nickname for him. One of them.\"\n\nFor a couple of years, Terry Bowden said he wanted to coach again. He proved it on New Year's Eve when he accepted the North Alabama job, when he came back to the sport and state he'd left, one of them, he believed, for good.\n\n\"I never thought I would work in this state again,\" he said. ''Some coaches choose to stick around. I didn't want to be a lightning rod.\n\n\"When I left Auburn, I was a lightning rod for controversy. So I chose pretty much for the last 10 years to work in 49 states and stay out of this one.\"\n\nHe still worked the Westwood One radio broadcast of the Division II national championship game here the last three years. That put him in the right place at the right time last December when UNA head coach Mark Hudspeth left to become Dan Mullen's passing game coordinator at Mississippi State.\n\nSomeone passed Bowden a note in the broadcast booth asking if he'd be interested in the job.\n\nDid they know what they were asking? Come back to Alabama, where some fans remember and revile him as the coach who quit at Auburn after a 1-5 start in 1998?\n\nWhy didn't he stay and fight then?\n\nWhy would he come back now?\n\n\"I was ready to come,\" Bowden said, \"but I was worried if I was going to have to spend all my time dealing with something that wasn't UNA football.\"\n\nBut he also understood, from his years at Samford and Auburn, that the Shoals area is a different part of Alabama, a hidden scenic gem, \"and we're out of the mainstream politics of Alabama, the sports politics.\"\n\nProof arrived at a UNA reception after he took the job. He estimated that more than 100 Auburn fans lined up to have him sign Auburn gear.\n\n\"The Auburn fans who've gotten to see me have been so good to me,\" he said. \"I'm sure there are those who couldn't care less if I ever walked in this state again. But they don't know me, and I don't care.\"\n\nReeling on the river\n\nThe move made sense on so many other levels. At UNA, the loyal son would be a reasonable drive away from his aging parents in Tallahassee. The avid fisherman could live on the Tennessee River.\n\n\"I used to say faith, family, football,\" he said. ''Now it's Florence, fishing, faith, family, football.\"\n\nIt's hard for a Bowden to have football without family so it was only natural that Terry would ask Jeff to join him as associate head coach and receivers coach -- and that Jeff would say yes.\n\nThey'd worked together at Salem and Samford and Jeff had been out of football himself the last two years, after he was forced to resign as his dad's offensive coordinator at Florida State.\n\n\"Jeff got blamed for everything,\" Terry said. \"What he got butchered on, my dad needs to stand up, wave his hands and say, 'I'm the guy that was running that ship.'\"\n\nThe silver lining was Jeff Bowden's $537,500 financial settlement with Florida State. Because FSU still is paying him $107,500 a year until August of 2012, he was able to join Terry's staff as an unpaid volunteer assistant.\n\n\"I'm most excited about working with Terry,\" Jeff said. \"That was the whole reason I came up here.\"\n\nJeff Bowden said his brother's \"hunger\" to return to coaching was \"undeniable.\"\n\n\"I couldn't see him not going back (to coaching),\" Jeff said. \"I always thought he was the best coach in the family.\"\n\nThe whole family?\n\n\"Let me say this -- of the sons.\"\n\nThe brothers have been like kids again the last four months. With their families still in Florida, they've lived together in Jeff's new house and been joined by Jeff's oldest son. Jeff, a Food Network fan, has been the chef.\n\nThey've worked together and fished together and wondered if this career move wasn't somehow preordained. Jeff remembers a great uncle teaching him how to fly-fish as a kid on the Coosa River in Childersburg.\n\n\"I'd pull out magazines and read about catching monster catfish on the Tennessee River,\" he said. \"Now I'm on the river. Doing what I like to do. Punish me more.\"\n\nConnections yield transfers\n\nTerry Bowden is doing a lot of things Division I coaches don't have to do. Like trying to spread 36 scholarships among 85 or so players.\n\nThat explains the numbers on his legal pad, a .25 next to this player's name, a .52 next to that one. This isn't Auburn. Most DII scholarships aren't full rides.\n\n\"Creative financial packaging,\" Bowden called it, and he knows how to do it from his three years at Salem College.\n\n\"There's a part of me that likes to play with numbers. It's fun putting the puzzle together.\"\n\nIt's also been a challenge to replace so many pieces from the 2008 North Alabama team that went 12-2 and lost in the national semifinals.\n\nBowden kept the entire coaching staff, but that team lost 21 lettermen, including the top four receivers, the top two running backs and three-year starting quarterback A.J. Milwee, who's stayed as a graduate assistant.\n\nLast year's backup quarterback went through spring practice and then was declared academically ineligible.\n\nThat's where Bowden's contacts in the profession have paid off. He has 11 Division I transfers signed or committed to play this fall, five from Florida State alone.\n\nThey include the likely starting quarterback, Harrison Beck. Rivals.com ranked him as the No. 3 pro-style quarterback in the high school class of 2005 out of Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 220-pound Beck turned down Florida, Florida State and Miami to sign with Nebraska, transferred to North Carolina State after one year and suffered through a coaching change there.\n\nBowden learned about him from former N.C. State head coach Chuck Amato and former N.C. State staffer Todd Stroud, both of whom now work at Florida State.\n\nIt also didn't hurt that Beck wants to be a head coach, and three of Bowden's former quarterbacks -- Jimbo Fisher, Patrick Nix and Dameyune Craig -- became college assistants.\n\nRight now, Bowden's searching for another quarterback to slot between Beck, who has one year of eligibility, and the freshman signees, including Hoover's Simon Propst.\n\n\"I can't talk about it,\" Bowden said, \"but I'm close to getting a guy from a major school.\"\n\nYou can't talk about Bowden's return to coaching without discussing his exit, how he resigned from Auburn at midseason in 1998 because he believed he was going to be fired at season's end.\n\nHas spending 10 years talking about the game on TV and radio and writing about it on the Internet changed his perspective?\n\nDoes he wish he'd coached out that final season?\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind the way the story was going to end,\" he said. \"Would my coaching career have kept going? I don't know. I was pretty burned out.\n\n\"I'm pretty keyed into accepting success. I never knew how to deal with that kind of failure. That's monumental failure. That's going from being national coach of the year in 1993 to being one play away in the fourth quarter from beating Tennessee in the SEC Championship Game in 1997 to less than 12 months away from being without a job at 42 years old.\n\n\"So do I have regrets? I don't think there's anything I could've done any more than Tommy Tuberville could've done anything to change his ending there. With me, I've beat myself up too much over that. What could I have done differently?\n\n\"In a lot of ways, I just chose to fight a different fight at that point in my life.\"\n\nPassion for football\n\nAt this point, Bowden's trying something different. He's trying to win at a school that has been winning. He's trying to live up to his own personal track record of coming out of the blocks with a burst.\n\nHe went 9-1 his first year at Samford, 11-0 his first season at Auburn, and he extended that opening winning streak with the Tigers to 20-0.\n\n\"It's not common sense to think you can lose 21 lettermen and 15 starters and be better,\" Bowden said. \"Here's a team that went 12-2 and had a great head coach and a great staff. And just because my name is bigger, there's even more excitement. I hate to blow that opportunity.\"\n\nThat's why he's blowing off his usual summer vacation and his 35th high school reunion. There's too much work to be done for a head coach who also coaches the quarterbacks and calls the plays.\n\n\"He sends e-mails all the time,\" offensive coordinator Alan Arrington said. \"Your phone will go off at 4 a.m. He has a passion for football.\"\n\nAnd what if he gets it done?\n\nWhat if he wins big?\n\nWill he be tempted to return to the big-time?\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time, for him or for UNA. North Alabama won three straight Division II national titles in 1993, 1994 and 1995 under Bobby Wallace, who later left to become the head coach at Temple.\n\n\"I promise you I won't leave here for Temple,\" Bowden said. \"I swear to God I won't leave here for Temple.\"\n\nBut seriously. This is a man who once calculated how many years it would take him to win one more game than Bear Bryant.\n\n\"As ambitious as I've always been, I'm never gonna be the winningest coach in my own family,\" he said. \"So what am I shooting for? Can I make a difference in this community? Can I make a difference at North Alabama?\""
