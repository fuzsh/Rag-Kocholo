He is the son of the legendary coach, Bobby Bowden.\n\nTerry Bowdenâs Financial Status\n\nAs of late 2017, Terry Bowden holds a net worth of $13 million, primarily accumulated from his career in football. It is reported that he has earned more than $800,000 in the past two years.\n\nEarly Life, Childhood, and Education\n\nComing from a family deeply rooted in sports, his father, legendary football coach Bobby Bowden, worked for the Florida State Seminoles football team. Terry attended West Virginia University, where he was actively involved in football and was part of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. A diligent student, Bowden graduated with magna cum laude in accounting and pursued post-graduate studies in England at Oxford University. He ventured into football, working as a graduate assistant at Florida State and later became the youngest head football coach in the nation at the age of 26 when he began his tenure at Salem College in 1983. During his time there, Terry secured the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title twice.\n\nCareer Progress\n\nIn 1986, he served as an assistant coach at the University of Akron under Gerry Faust. A year later, he became the head coach at Samford University, overseeing the programâs transition from Division III to Division I-AAA, eventually achieving that milestone in 1991. He went on to join Auburn University as the head football coach in 1992, where his inaugural season was tremendously successful, making him the first coach to remain undefeated in his debut season in Division I. He continued his successful streak until 1998, at which point he faced criticism for issues related to player behavior and administrative conflicts.\n\nAfter stepping down from his coaching role, Bowden ventured into broadcasting, serving as a studio analyst and commentator for ABC. Subsequently, he became involved as a sports journalist for Yahoo! Sports and hosted a radio talk show in Orlando for a period of time. In 2006, he commenced work at Westwood as an expert analyst. However, in 2008, Bowden returned to coaching, assuming the position of head football coach at the University of North Alabama in Florence. Under his leadership, the Lions competed in three NCAA Division II Playoffs.\n\nIn 2011, Terry began his tenure at the University of Akron. His contributions were valued, leading to an extension of his contract for two more years, maintaining his position throughout 2017-18.\n\nPersonal Life: Family\n\nTerry is married to Sheryl, and they have six children. Despite facing allegations of infidelity, both Terry and Sheryl have publicly denied these rumors.\n\nStructural Info\n\nFacts\n\nFilmography\n\nNet Worth$800,000Salary$30,000Date Of BirthFebruary 25, 1956Place Of BirthDouglas, Georgia, USAProfessionAmerican Football coach, American Football playerNationalityAmericanSpouseSherylChildrenTerry Bowden Jr., Jordan Bowden, Erin Bowden, Tera Bowden, Cori Bowden, Jamie BowdenSiblingsTommy Bowden, Jeff Bowden, Steve Bowden, Robyn Hines, Ginger MaddenTwitterhttps://twitter.com/terrybowdenIMDBhttp://brazilian.imdb.com/name/nm1756627\n\n#Fact1Son of Bobby Bowden and Ann Bowden.2Brother of Tommy Bowden and Steve Bowden.3Former Auburn Tigers head football coach.\n\nSelf\n\nTitleYearStatusCharacterThe Bowden Dynasty: A Story of Faith, Family & Football2017DocumentaryHimself2015 Famous Idaho Potato Bowl2015TV MovieHimself â Akron Zips Head CoachESPN SportsCentury2005TV Series documentaryHimself2005 Nokia Sugar Bowl2005TV MovieHimself â Color CommentatorPardon the Interruption2004TV SeriesHimselfThe 70th Annual Nokia Sugar Bowl2004TV MovieHimself â Studio Analyst2003 FedEx Orange Bowl2003TV MovieHimself â Studio Analyst2001 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl2001TV MovieHimself â Studio Analyst1996 Poulan Weedeater Independence Bowl1996TV MovieHimself â Auburn Tigers Head Coach1996 Outback Bowl1996TV MovieHimself â Auburn Tigers Head Coach\n\nTags\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiYm6elqXq1sdGrsGaan6yxprrSZq6emZyptXA%3D\n\nShare!"
