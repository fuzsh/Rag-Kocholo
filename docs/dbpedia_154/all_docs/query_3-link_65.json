        "text": "By all accounts, Bobby Bowden did a great job in his first stint as a head football coach from 1955 to 1958 for the South Georgia College Tigers. But the job he did as the Tigers' head basketball coach was -- by all accounts, including his own -- pathetic.\n\n\"It was awful,\" Bowden said.\n\nHe was 25 years old with a wife and three kids. He was working at a two-year college in Douglas, Ga., and was making $4,200 for duties that included athletic director.\n\n\"The basketball thing, I was embarrassed,\" he said. \"We fouled a lot, and we couldn't get the ball across half court. The scores were dismal. Some got in the 80s to 24. It was bad.\"\n\nThe Tigers were more like kittens on the basketball court. They were 1-13 in 1955.\n\nThe only reason the Tigers won a junior college game that season wasn't because the Tigers played well. They were bad, but their opponents -- a team of sailors -- were worse.\n\n\"I had 18 scholarships and I went out and raised enough money to have 30,\" Bowden said. \"And I gave all my scholarships to football players and made some of them play basketball. It was a laugh.\"\n\nAt his previous job as an assistant football coach at Howard College in Birmingham, Ala., from 1953 to 1954, Bowden also coached the basketball team, which compiled a 23-2 record in two seasons.\n\nThat excellent record was no reflection on Bowden as a basketball coach, he said.\n\n\"We were basically playing high schools.\"\n\nAt South Georgia, \"I had one basketball player on the team, a boy named John Williams. He quit -- and I don't blame him. I'd have quit, too.\n\n\"He was a darned good player. But what you had was one basketball player surrounded by all football players.\"\n\nWilliams, 66, a retired utility company worker from Perry, Ga., said he still has some regrets about quitting near the end of the 1955 season.\n\n\"I played four years in high school,\" Williams said. \"We won a state championship at Montezuma High School in Georgia. I was used to playing on winning teams.\n\n\"I thought the world of Coach Bowden. All the men respected him. I just wasn't used to losing like that.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Williams continued. \"We didn't have any basketball players. I just got fed up. I'm not a quitter, but I stopped coming. I just couldn't take it anymore.\"\n\nBowden's widely acclaimed charm has a way of making a lot of friends. To this day, he remains Williams' friend.\n\n\"Bobby Bowden is a fine gentleman, and always will be,\" Williams said.\n\nGiving Himself the Boot\n\nBowden the gentleman was also smart enough to get out of the basketball coaching business at South Georgia College.\n\n\"I was the A.D.,\" he said with a laugh. \"so I fired myself as basketball coach.\"\n\nBowden hired Vince Gibson to coach basketball and help with the football team. Gibson was raised in Bowden's neighborhood in Birmingham.\n\nBowden took over the baseball team at South Georgia and worked the diamond for three years (1956-1958). He made a better baseball coach than he did a basketball coach.\n\n\"We won two state championships in baseball,\" Bowden said. \"I loved it, I really loved it. I enjoyed it as much as anything I've ever done.\"\n\nBud Holt, 64, the safety director of a Clermont transport company, pitched and played the outfield for Bowden's baseball Tigers. He said Bowden was known for razzle-dazzle on the football field, but not on the baseball diamond.\n\n\"We had some good athletes, so we ran our share\" on the bases, Holt said. Except for an occasional suicide squeeze, \"we really didn't do anything daring. We didn't even bunt too much.\n\n\"Coach Bowden had a knack of making you believe in yourself.\"\n\nJim Gill, 62, a banker in Carrollton, Ga., also pitched and played outfield for Bowden. He said Bowden was short on experience as a baseball coach, but encouraging.\n\n\"I remember what Coach Bowden told us the first day,\" Gill said. \"He said, 'I've played a little baseball, and if we can all work together, we'll be just fine.' \"\n\nBuilding a Powerhouse\n\nThe South Georgia baseball and football teams became powerhouses under Bowden and the basketball team flourished under Gibson.\n\nBowden had gone to South Georgia College, sight unseen, after receiving a letter from William Smith, president of the school. Bowden spent the summer of 1955 in Douglas, population about 8,000 then, in Coffee County. He called on local merchants for money to offer athletic scholarships.\n\nPlaying guys with nicknames like Doodle Bug, Bull, Blinky, Ape, Overalls and Stump, Bowden's football Tigers went 22-11 in four years, beginning with a 32-12 win over Middle Georgia. The Tigers won three Georgia junior college championships in Bowden's four seasons. He was named the state's Junior College Coach of the Year in 1955 and 1957.\n\nAfter starting his first year 2-0, Bowden, a little smug, figured he was a pretty good coach. In game three, he learned a hard lesson in humility.\n\nTwo accounts of the game against Jones Junior College in Mississippi list the score slightly different, 60-13 and 61-14. Either way, the Tigers got drilled by 47 points.\n\nBowden said he took the loss hard and had serious doubts about his coaching future. But the road to success is usually paved with doses of failure and Bowden considered that game against Jones as one of his.\n\nHe Still Calls Them 'My Boys'\n\nBowden still calls the South Georgia College players \"my boys,\" despite the fact most of the players were a few years younger than he was. He didn't turn 26 until November 1955.\n\nSome of the players had served in the armed services, so they were a litte older.\n\nDespite the fact players and coach were contemporaries, the players say Bowden was and still is \"like a father\" or \"a father figure.\"\n\nThey're Bowden's boys to this day because, being near the same age, he understood them well. More so, they're still his boys because they were his first boys, the first football team he served as head coach.\n\n\"When I got to South Georgia, I was 25. That was after the Korean War,\" Bowden said. \"I had boys 26, 27 playing on my club. I was so young, I tried to do everything I could to look older.\n\n\"You know I used to wear a crew cut and I let my hair grow out,\" he continued. \"I wanted to change my name to Robert instead of Bobby. My name is Robert, but I was talking to Ann and said, 'Should I start using the name Robert instead of Bobby? Bobby's too young.' \"But then Bobby Dodd was coaching at Georgia Tech and I said, 'Bobby Dodd uses it so I'll stay with it.' \"\n\n'Ol' Stumpy' and 'Ape' Bill \"Stump'\n\nFranklin, known by Bowden as \"Ol' Stumpy\" and \"one of the toughest little ol' guys I ever coached,\" comes by his moniker honestly: he played at 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 230 pounds. Franklin, 64, was raised on a farm in Washington County, Ga., and said some of the farm chores were tougher than blocking or tackling.\n\n\"A lot of the players had just come back from Korea,\" he said. \"We liked the vets because they always got a monthly check and we could try to talk them out of part of it.\"\n\nFranklin said he still has tremendous respect for Bowden. He said he's a smoker, but never in front of Bowden.\n\n\"I just can't let coach see me,\" he said.\n\nDuring a Seminole Cruise five years ago, Franklin burned a hole in his pants pocket trying to hide a cigarette butt from Bowden.\n\nFranklin said Bowden loved to use smoke and mirrors on his gridiron opponents.\n\n\"We ran that punt-rooski stuff back then,\" Franklin said. \"The reverses, the Statue of Liberty. He loved gadgetry and if he could trick somebody, he'd do it. He knew just when to use it.\"\n\nAnother one of Bowden's boys, Mitch \"Ape\" Adams, 64, is a retired salesman from Elberton, Ga., who played guard. He also earned his nickname honestly: He was nearly covered with hair.\n\n\"The trouble now is there's more of it on my chest than on top of my head,\" Adams said.\n\nAdams remembers how Bowden, who lived in the dorm with the players, knew everything that took place among the players.\n\n\"Say you and I did something and we didn't tell anybody,\" Adams said. \"He knew it.\"\n\nThe Master of Chicanery\n\nBowden knew something else, Adams said.\n\n\"With those trick plays, he didn't think he could fool the other team. He knew he could,\" Adams said. \"At least one play every game, it would be something they never saw before. He'd wait until just the right time.\"\n\n\"I used to do our quick kicks,\" said Roger Wilkinson, 65, from Glennville, Ga., a retired rural mail carrier and Bowden's quarterback at South Georgia.\n\n\"Against Gordon Military, we faked a quick kick where I'd go through with the kicking motion, but bring the arm with the ball behind my back,\" he said.\n\nWilkinson faked a handoff to Ron Kelly and Kelly \"goes around the end and the whole defense goes to him,\" Wilkinson said. \"Then I threw to one of the ends, Everett Graham, who goes in for a touchdown. We practiced it and practiced it and practiced it.\"\n\nTommy Boney, 63, a Jacksonville developer and a linebacker and guard for the South Georgia team, said Bowden was especially fond of tricking teams that were better than the Tigers.\n\nIn one version of chicanery, \"He sent 10 on the field, and just before the ball was snapped, the 11th guy barely came on the field -- the end who caught the pass. Back then it was legal.\n\n\"Coach Bowden was a disciplinarian,\" Boney said. \"In a game, I once retaliated after a play, hit a guy with my forearm. Coach Bowden was mad at me. He made me run around two football fields five times.\"\n\nLife in the Barracks\n\nIn 1955 and 1956, the Bowdens lived in one of the barracks on a former U.S. Army air base in Douglas.\n\nThousands of military pilots were schooled at the 63rd Flight Training Detachment in Douglas, which closed in 1944. The rent for Bowden was $25 per month.\n\nBowden's wife, Ann, said she's liked everywhere the family lived, even the barracks, which had a lot of room.\n\n\"But you had to go outside onto the porch to get from the kitchen or living room to the bedroom,\" she said.\n\nThe floor was elevated, Bowden said, which made for some windy days inside the home. He said wind is often a factor in football games, but in the barracks, it was often a factor while the family ate.\n\nTerry, the fourth of the Bowden children, was born in February 1956 and people in Douglas are proud of that. Mention the Bowdens to a Douglas resident and chances are good that you'll get this included with the reply: \"You know, Terry was born here.\"\n\nLater in 1956, Ann won the Mrs. South Georgia contest.\n\nShe was working part time in Douglas as a substitute teacher and in a Sears mail-order store at the time.\n\nIn 1957, the Bowdens moved from the barracks to an athletic dormitory, Powell Hall, on the South Georgia campus near downtown Douglas. The school paid the cost of the dorm apartment and the utilities.\n\nBobby Jackson, 60, now the offensive coordinator and running backs coach of the St. Louis Rams, played in the offensive and defensive back fields for Bowden at South Georgia and later at Howard College.\n\nTerry the Tazmanian Devil\n\nWhen Terry Bowden was probably 2 1/2 years old, \"He was all over the campus, a little Tazmanian Devil,\" Jackson said. \"The family lived in a dormitory and Terry was always running around. People would buy him soda, candy and ice cream at the student union.\n\n\"Ann got tired of it,\" Jackson said. \"On a piece of white paper, she wrote 'DO NOT FEED.' She taped it on Terry's back and off he went.\n\n\"When we saw the sign on Terry, we stuffed candy in all of his pockets. We changed the sign on his back to 'WELL FED' and sent him back home.\"\n\nTerry looked different than the other Bowden kids. As a result, several former Tiger players said Terry asked his father if the family had adopted him. The father's response: \"Yeah, but they brought you back.\"\n\nWith the large family, the rent break at the dorm helped. But the Bowdens still had a tough time making ends meet.\n\n\"We passed clothes down,\" Ann said. \"And we had lots of hot dogs and hamburgers.\"\n\nTryin' To Make a Livin'\n\nBowden took a job at a tobacco warehouse as a scale man. During each of his four summers in Douglas, he worked the 8 p.m.-to-8 a.m. shift at a place called Stubbs Warehouse. And he worked from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. as a lifeguard, \"just tryin' to make a livin',\" he said.\n\nWith those hours, he needed to catch a little sleep after his tobacco warehouse shift.\n\n\"In the tobacco warehouse, I'd be the only one there,\" he said.\n\nWith his Southern drawl, Bowden pronounces the word tobacco like the Os are As: ta-bacca.\n\n'People would bring tobacco there in these trucks,\" he said. Bowden helped unload the trucks before he weighed the tobacco.\n\n\"About 2 o'clock, they quit comin' in. There'd always be some straggler that came in about 2. Then after he'd leave, I'd have 'till 8 o'clock just to be on duty. So I'd get up on that tobacco and go to sleep on the biggest stack.\n\n\"There were big ol' rats just running around there, just hundreds of rats. I had to get up there on the top of that dadgum tobacco. They wouldn't crawl up there.\"\n\nThe 'Old Blue Goose'\n\nBowden actually did more for the athletic department than lead it and coach football and baseball. He also drove the blue diesel-powered team bus called the \"Old Blue Goose.\"\n\n\"He wasn't the best driver,\" said Wilkinson, the quarterback, telling a story repeated by several Tigers. \"One time in North Georgia, he missed a curve. He near killed us all.\n\n\"On a curve to the right, he went all the way across the left lane and on the shoulder. Before we stopped, it felt like we were riding on two tires, like we were going to roll over. He was scared to death.\n\n\"It's funny now, but not then. He got a driver after that.\"\n\nBowden was a stickler for scouting opponents and liked to have his quarterbacks ride along on scouting trips.\n\n\"One day, coach came by after practice,\" Wilkinson said. \"He was going to Gordon Military and wanted to bring a couple quarterbacks along to scout the game. It was 80 miles. We got there 15 minutes ahead of the game, and I'll be gosh-dogged, something is wrong. Two high school teams were warming up to play.\n\n\"We go home and it's rainin' so hard we're gonna have to pull over. The windshield wipers didn't work.\"\n\nWilkinson said Bowden had no clue about how the wipers worked or how to fix them. Wilkinson reached under the dash of what he said was a 1951 Chevy. Tinkering with the wiper apparatus, he figured he could work the wipers manually.\n\n\"I'm pushing my arms back and forth the best I can, and coach is saying, 'Faster, I can't see. Faster.' \"Coach was a coach -- he wasn't no mechanic.\"\n\nStump's 'Big Ol' Mullet'\n\nJerome \"Blinky\" Barber, 64, played fullback and linebacker for Bowden in 1955 and offensive and defensive end in 1957. He broke his arm in 1956.\n\nBarber was born in Eagle Lake and raised in Winter Haven. He now lives in Haines City and, with his wife, Lillian, owns seven antique stores. Barber spent 30 years at Haines City High School as a track coach and assistant football coach.\n\nBarber did not come by his nickname of Blinky honestly.\n\n\"I don't blink any more than anybody else,\" he said. \"They just had to call everybody something.\"\n\nOne summer in the athletic dorm, the other Tigers, Barber included, had had enough of Stump Franklin. Four or five guys, including ringleaders Ape Adams and Leeon \"Bull\" Smith, played a rather rank practical joke on Franklin that they still laugh about. Smith, 67, is a retired educator from Elberton, Ga.\n\nSome of the Tigers were playing ping pong in a dorm recreation area. They had just one ping pong ball. Ask the players what year this happened and they disagree, but this part of the story everyone agrees upon: The ball went off the table and Stump stomped it to bits. He claims it was his turn to play, and the guys ignored him.\n\nIf they had been ignoring Stump, the stomping of the ball brought more attention to him than he wanted.\n\n\"Stump had a way of gettin' under your skin,\" Smith said.\n\nHe and Adams got what they both described as a \"big ol' mullet\" and diverted Stump from his dorm room by having Barber take him downtown for a few hours.\n\nWhile Stump was gone, they slit his mattress, stuffed the fish inside it and sewed the mattress back together.\n\nAnother detail of the mullet caper that nobody disputes is this: After a few days, Stump's room smelled to high heaven. The powerful stench could have gagged a maggot.\n\nWord of the joke spread as fast as the smell. Stump would pull people into the room and ask if they smelled anything. The standard reply, given by Barber and others, \"Smell what?\" Stump at one point thought he had the origin of the stink pin-pointed to the mattress, so he traded the mattress for one in a vacant dorm room. When he left for class, the guys brought the foul mattress back into his room.\n\n\"It finally ended when Stump threw the mattress out the window,\" Barber said.\n\nStump learned who had pulled the mullet prank just a few years ago.\n\n\"It is kind of funny now. I gotta laugh,\" he said. \"But it sure wasn't funny then and I'm still a litte mad. It was awful. Those guys owe me -- I never got my room deposit back because I tore that place up looking for that smell.\n\n\"If I live long enough, I'll get them,\" he said. \"What do you think about sardines in their carburetor? Nah, that's not pay back enough . . . I swear, I will get those guys.\"\n\nSunday Mornings in Church\n\nWhile there were plenty of shenanigans to go around, Bowden's Tigers had a serious side.\n\nTom Frier Sr., 82, the publisher of the Douglas Enterprise from 1939 to 1989, said Bobby and Ann Bowden taught Sunday school at the First Baptist Church.\n\n\"Without any cajoling, the football players were there on Sunday mornings,\" Frier said. \"The people who have been around here for a while still remember that.\"\n\nSince Bowden left Douglas, the barracks bordering the town's airport, including the one in which the Bowdens lived, have become a source of some controversy. Most of them, including the one inhabited by the Bowdens, are in a state of grave disrepair. Over the years, the barracks have served in numerous capacities, including a summer camp, an alcohol treatment center and offices for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\n\nDouglas residents are divided on whether to renovate the barracks because of their historical significance to the World War II effort or to bulldoze them. In the meantime, small amounts of cash earmarked for the barracks have been enough just to keep them standing, and little more. The roof on the Bowden porch has sprung a massive leak, and during a good storm buckets of water pound the porch floor.\n\nNext Stop: Birmingham\n\nAfter Bowden's 1958 season at South Georgia, Smith, the school president, told Bowden he was sorry, but the school had to pull the plug on football because of finances. When Bowden offered to solicit the town merchants for more money, Smith told him they were already giving too much.\n\nBowden was asked to stay on as athletic director and baseball coach. For even the rudimentary college football fan, this should come as no surprise: Bowden said no. The reason, of course, was that he wanted above all to be a football head coach.\n\nIt was back to Howard College in Birmingham, the city where Bowden was born and the college where he played football, graduated and served two years as a football assistant.\n\nBowden brought a dozen of his boys with him.\n\nBeginning Sept. 4, 2000, The Ledger published a 12-part series titled \"Papa Nole,\" about the remarkable journey of Bobby Bowden. Written by Mike Cobb and Rick Rousos, the series chronicled Bowden from his birth in November 1929 in Birmingham, Ala., through his coaching successes at Samford, West Virginia and finally Tallahassee.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE"
