        "text": "Once again I’ve been distracted from reading my assorted LitBios of Eleanor Dark because I have been busy close-reading Garry Kissane’s award-winning biography of George Johnston (1912-1970) so that I can lend it to a fellow booklover.\n\nWinner of the Age Book of the Year in 1986, this biography is interesting in its own right but also because of the persisting view that (as Wikipedia suggests) it was the imminent publication of Johnston’s Clean Straw for Nothing that prompted his wife Charmian Clift (1923-1969) to suicide in 1969. It is said that this is because the characterisation of Cressida Morley in the novel exposes Clift’s infidelities during the couple’s sojourn on the Greek island of Hydra where they lived from 1954 to 1964. A posthumously published essay indicates that Clift was troubled by it, but Johnston in his one public comment a couple of months after her death said that ‘Cressida was fictional’. The fact that Cressida the character in the novel is not a writer as Clift was, is also taken by some as an indication that Johnston was diminishing her as a writer and his collaborator. Whatever about that, Garry Kinnane makes it clear that he rejects the accusation:\n\nIt is the view of many of their friends, and many who have simply read the published novel, that Johnston was in Clean Straw for Nothing undertaking a callous exposition of Clift’s behaviour on Hydra, either out of revenge or out of a selfish desire to reveal all in the cause of truth, or worse, to create a sensational novel. (p.273)\n\nKinnane is emphatic that this was not the case. Indeed, though he writes that she came to believe some of these things, Clift had not even read the novel. After his return to Australia in 1964 to the acclaim from My Brother Jack, Johnston was working on the sequel while he was in hospital receiving treatment for TB, and she thought, quite correctly, that he was writing about those last three traumatic years on Hydra when, exacerbated by excessive drinking, her flagrant affairs were a source of constant conflict between them. But because she refused to read the drafts, or act as a sounding board as she had for his other writing, she did not know that his treatment of this material was generous towards her and that the book was about his own failures. (Or, also, as CS Boag says in his review at Goodreads, that it’s a beautiful love story.)\n\nFrom Johnston’s preparatory notes for the Clean Straw for Nothing, Kinnane surmises that it links historical large scale suffering with the private experience of it, illuminating Meredith’s fight against despair.\n\nIs it true that Johnston was using the novel to malign her? My answer is an emphatic ‘No’. There can be no doubt that if he had chosen to give a full account of her affairs and the consequences, the picture could have been one of squalid drunkenness, public love-making, violent quarrels, beatings, all of which are still the subject of gossip among people who were on Hydra in those days. (p.273).\n\n‘Beatings’. That word, in the plural, triggers the assumption that he was responsible. But close friends witnessed their mutually self-destructive behaviour fuelled by alcohol and were embarrassed at the sordid scenes between them. By the summer of 1962, exacerbated by the chaotic and destructive social climate amongst the expats on Hydra and the presence of yet another of Clift’s lovers, this time an American called ‘Chip’ Chadwick, their confrontations were that much more bitter, and at times violent:\n\nGrace Edwards learned that Clift had cut Johnston’s face with a broken glass on one occasion; on another Johnston went berserk and tried to take on the world, ending up in the local cell for the night. (p.211)\n\nBack in Sydney in 1965…\n\nAlcohol was still the catalyst for bitter rows between them, when back to the surface came all the old accusations and venom. Being word-spinners, both had wounding tongues, nor did they spare their friends the spectacle of some of their worst performances. ‘Virgina Woolf scenes’, Cedric Flower called them, and he and [his wife] Pat began to lose the desire to be with them, because it was so painful. (p.247)\n\nAnd all this was witnessed by their children, Martin (b.1947), Shane (b.1950) and Jason (b.1956 on Hydra). Jason especially could not choose to absent himself.\n\nRevisiting one of my reviews of the work of C K Stead, I came across an interview which quoted Nabokov on this very issue.\n\n‘It is strange,’ Vladimir Nabokov once wrote in a study of Nikolai Gogol, ‘the morbid inclination we have to derive satisfaction from the fact (generally false and always irrelevant) that a work of art is traceable to a ‘true story’.’\n\n(Mark Broatch then goes on to interrogate Stead about autobiographical elements in his work , which you can read here if interested.)\n\nFrom my reading of Kinnane’s LitBio, it seems to me that he aligns with Nabokov, and he makes a convincing case that although Johnston obviously drew on his own experiences, he transformed them, as good novelists do, to create something entirely new in order to work through some theme or issue of concern. In Clean Straw for Nothing, his concern was not exacting revenge on a faithless wife, but on his own failures as a man.\n\nThis seems, at first, a strange lack of self-esteem from the man documented in this biography: a man who had his first stories published as a teenager; who was invited to become a cadet reporter for the Melbourne Argus newspaper and rose to be one of its most successful journalists; who was a respected war correspondent; then the editor of a prestigious newspaper in London; and (co-writing four of them with Clift) the author of nineteen novels, two of which won the Miles Franklin Award, and eight works of non-fiction. And yet he did think he was a failure. His ambition was to abandon journalism and to write full time, and though the sojourn on Hydra was a fairly disciplined effort to write as a literary couple (at least in the mornings before the drinking started), it was never financially viable. Johnston dashed off five works of genre fiction as ‘Shane Martin’ to bring in some money, but he wanted to write literature. Trying to support two families — his daughter Gae from his first marriage to Elsie Taylor and his three children from his marriage to Clift — he was always broke, barely able to get by even on Hydra where living expenses were low, and often hugely in alarming debt. Although he and Clift were remarkably casual about their children’s welfare and the disruptions to their lives as they moved about, he was worried about his children’s education and had no means of funding it. In middle age with a younger wife who was still sexually active, he was impotent due to serious ill health and publicly cuckolded. He knew that he had no prospect of being able to provide for his family in the future. And until the success of My Brother Jack in 1964, he was not respected as a writer of serious literature.\n\nHe also berated himself for choosing not to enlist in WW2 and waiting for an opportunity to be a war correspondent instead. All his life he felt guilty about having a non-combatant role. As we see in his novel The Far Road (1962) he was deeply conflicted about the role of war correspondents as witness to atrocity as well. (I was surprised to read that this novel did not sell well or attract good reviews because as you can see in my review) I thought it was a fine, thoughtful novel about the ethics of journalism in war zones.)\n\nKinnane’s biography tackles the semi-autobiographical nature of the novels that form Johnston’s oeuvre, beginning in the first chapter with the Meredith Trilogy, and distinguishing elements in Johnston’s fiction that differ from his life. Starting with Johnston’s childhood, he interrogates the most teasing puzzle in Johnston’s fictional version of his childhood in My Brother Jack, i.e. the monstrous impression he creates of his father, John George Johnston.\n\nKinnane describes the numerous ways in which the childhood described in My Brother Jack (1964) is at odds with Johnston’s own childhood. In real life he was a successful student, popular, and good at sport. He was never a loner: he was a fun-loving boy, gregarious and sociable, and he had the loyalty and admiration of friends, traits which he carried into adulthood. His father, though a bit of a bigot, and his WW1 experiences had changed his temperament into that of a sarcastic and aggressive man, was not a violent man. (This is contested by Clift’s biographer Nadia Wheatley, see here.) He was however, as bitterly disillusioned with life as his counterpart Meredith Senior in My Brother Jack. As for his real-life mother Minnie… well, she did populate the house with the tragic victims of WW1, but…\n\n… she did not go overseas as the Minnie Meredith of My Brother Jack does. As part of their after-care duties at South Caulfield Hospital, the VAD nurses could take some patients home, especially to boost the morale of those men whose families may have been miles away in the country. Minnie took many such soldiers to Lochied [their home in Elsternwick], and indeed, during the years when her husband was abroad, she seemed to have conducted a personal crusade to nurse as many repatriated wounded back to health as possible. She would play the piano while they stood around in their various stages of mutilation singing popular songs of the day. Some of them stayed on for weeks, and in the case of one, Bert Thornton, for years, until eventually he married [George’s older sister] Jean and became one of the family. (p.7)\n\nDespite this, George Johnston’s friends attest to his exuberance for life and impulsive nature, and there is none of that in the fictional David Meredith of the Meredith trilogy.\n\nThis is not a biography of Charmian Clift — for that, there is Nadia Wheatley’s 2001 bio — but it is obvious from Kinnane’s book that Clift became a troubled woman. I had had the impression that she was a free spirit unburdened by convention, a successful woman of the 1960s, independent-minded, beautiful, and confident. And she was, when she met and captivated Johnston. Despite leaving school at fourteen, she was also a talented writer, both in collaboration with Johnston and in her own right as a novelist, as a scriptwriter and as a hugely popular newspaper columnist.\n\nBut she wasn’t suited to life as the wife of a newspaper executive in the UK, she didn’t like being confined to the domestic sphere, and she didn’t adapt well to the ageing that comes to every woman, beautiful or not. According to Kinnane, she was obsessed with her appearance and was desperate to prove that she was still sexually attractive. She publicly flaunted her lovers. Though they were mutually self-destructive, Kinnane documents some real cruelty, as when she wrote from Hydra to Johnston then back in Australia, wanting to bring her current lover back with her and the children. And visiting him in hospital, flanked by her latest admirers.\n\nStill, it’s sad to read of her decline and the photo of her departure from Hydra in 1964 is some confirmation of the changes in her appearance which shocked her friends when she arrived back in Sydney:\n\nFriends such as Toni Burgess and Cedric Flower could hardly believe the change in her. It was not simply that she was older, but that she seemed to be a different woman. The beautiful, confident, stylish Clift who had gone abroad with such hubris thirteen years earlier had vanished and been supplanted by a flaccid, overweight, terrified matron with scraggy hair and no stockings. The huge, white smiling teeth were now brown and rotting. Moreover, as was soon to become apparent to all, she had returned with a drinking problem. Cedric Flower recalls her fingering her hair over her face in a defensive, nervous measure, and looking as if she wanted to become invisible. (p.244)\n\nThere was a disastrous appearance on TV when she was drunk and the wig that she had taken to wearing was crooked. But generally, the public version of Clift was of success, ease, grace and wisdom while in private, she was an unhappy alcoholic who was filled with self-loathing about her coarsened body yet still chasing affirmation with affairs. She was in a state of terror every week at the prospect of writing the column, forcing herself out of bed at 4 a.m. to get it written before the distractions of the day overwhelmed her. Visitors to the home were shocked by the state of the house and her abandonment of cooking, and while we might in other circumstances be adamant that Johnston was responsible for this too, he was desperately ill. (His friends were shocked by his appearance too: his weight loss was alarming, and he had developed a cavity in his one remaining sound lung.) He was in and out of hospital for months and months getting treatment for pneumonia and TB, and barely had the physical strength to write, much less do any share of the housework. The last chapters of this biography are very sad indeed, as everything falls apart for both of them.\n\nThe cover design features Ray Crooke’s 1969 portrait of George Johnston, which won the Archibald in 1969. It’s housed in the Art Gallery of NSW. It was painted the year before Johnson died and there is no trace of the handsome, healthy young man of his earlier years that we see in the generous spread of photos in the book. Kinnane describes the portrait like this:\n\nThe simplified but strongly sculptured head and hands are lit by a pale glow and suggest an inner, radiant energy, while the arms and torso are insubstantial and merge into the dark-green background. It is a ghostly but wonderful picture of Johnston, capturing several aspects of his person — strength, fragility, grace, fear and his unique body language. (p.287)\n\nBut I find it immeasurably sad.\n\nI have a copy of High Valley, written collaboratively in 1947 when the couple were in love and before their son Martin was born. As you can see from the badge on the bookcover, it won them £2000 from the Sydney Morning Herald novel prize for an unpublished novel, and it was published by Angus and Robertson in 1949. It’s a romance (which doesn’t appeal to me), but it was drawn from Johnston’s experiences as a war correspondent in Tibet so I’m hoping that it lives up to the promise of prize judges, who are quoted on the dustjacket:\n\nKeen observation and a ready and vivid power of description, a patient uncovering of motive and searching of character are everywhere apparent. But the reader feels in addition the working of a higher imagination, which does not merely present, but re-creates, the life and character of person, the community and inanimate nature. The writing has a real distinction.\n\nThe back inside dustjacket has a lovely portrait of the couple, captioned with a very brief bio where George Johnson is quoted as saying ‘I was the journalist who supplied the substance… she was the artist who supplied the burnish.‘\n\nAuthor: Garry Kinnane\n\nTitle: George Johnston, a Biography\n\nPublisher: Nelson, 1986\n\nCover art: Portrait of George Johnston, by Ray Crooke AM (1922-2015), Art Gallery of NSW\n\nISBN: 9780170065733, (0170065371) hbk., First edition, 329 pages, 60 B&W photo reproductions.\n\nSource: Personal library"
