        "text": "A service was held for legendary coach and Birmingham native Bobby Bowden Sunday in Reid Chapel at Samford University.\n\nThe service was open to the public to give people the chance to pay their respects.\n\nCoach Bobby Bowden’s son, coach Terry Bowden said his father was not only known for his coaching, but he was a man of faith.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nTerry said he brought that onto the field trying to uplift his players.\n\n“One of his favorite saying was God doesn’t need our ability, he needs our availability and that we just make ourselves available, he tried to do that through his coaching and more importantly that football could be a priority in your life but it cannot be the, the priority,” said Terry.\n\nTerry said although he represents great success for the Florida State Seminoles, he’s home where he’s supposed to be.\n\n“Bobby Bowden is synonymous to the people of our country but to his friends he grew up with and those he’s most intimately close to is Birmingham and Howard College and obviously Samford University,” he said.\n\nHundreds of people stood in line to pay their respects Sunday and fans reflected on how Bowden touched their lives.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n“Coach Bowden lives about two miles from my parents house in Tallahassee, got to play golf with his a few times over the years and he’s just one of the greatest men I’ve ever known, he’s probably the second biggest male influence behind my dad,\" said Clayton Scott.\n\n“He was the best man I ever met. It’s a celebration because I know where he’s at, he was such a Godly man and a good man to know and I’m just thrilled that I got to know him,” said Kim Clayton.\n\nA private burial will follow in Trussville Monday where he will be laid near his mother and father."
