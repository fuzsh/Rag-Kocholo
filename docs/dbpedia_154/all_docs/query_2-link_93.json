        "text": "It was a sunny October Saturday in Auburn, Alabama. The year was 1985. Bobby Bowden was adding bricks to his legacy wall with every game.\n\nFSU was 4-0 fresh off a stunning win in Lincoln over a powerhouse Nebraska team. Bo Jackson and his Auburn Tigers were primed and ready for their nationally televised game against the Seminoles.\n\nThis was no ordinary season. For the first time in the history of college football, a coach would be wearing a wireless microphone. Everywhere: on the field, in the locker room, private coaches meetings, strolling with referees before games, hotel rooms. From August to January, everywhere Bowden went, our camera would be with him, and we were going to capture every garnet and golden word.\n\nBowden's, FSU's run to a strong start\n\nI was a producer at WFSU-TV and the guy who came up with this big idea. Bowden was the perfect person to pull off such an ambitious project. He was charming, funny and brilliantly colloquial. There wasn’t a coach anywhere in America more suited to pull off a project of this magnitude.\n\nThere were significant technical issues to overcome. We had to redesign microphones and cameras to do things they had not been built to do. The project had layers of logistical issues. But we pulled it off and from Day 1 we knew we had something special.\n\nIt all worked well for the first four games. FSU was undefeated, including the stunning win on the road against Nebraska. In that game, history was made as Bowden introduced the innovative “shovel pass” to college football.\n\nWe had him in the tunnel before the game, warning the referees that if the ball was dropped, it was an incomplete pass, not a fumble. And indeed during the game the shovel pass was dropped and one official called it a fumble. We had Bowden running out on the field reminding him of their pre-game talk and they reversed the call.\n\nWe had gold. Football like you’ve never seen it before.\n\nThen Auburn happened.\n\nNothing works for FSU against Auburn\n\nMost Seminole fans remember that game. We had an early lead. And in the span of about five minutes everything changed. Auburn put up an avalanche of points. Bowden tried fake punts, trick plays, anything to plug the leak. Nothing FSU did worked.\n\nNot because they weren’t well designed plays. Everything FSU did for those five minutes failed because the Auburn coaches heard every play Bowden was calling. It seems our new technology was broadcasting Bowden on FM radio. On 94.6, to be exact.\n\nYeah, that happened.\n\nI found out because from my seat in the press box, I could see the ruckus in the Auburn coach box. Soon every radio in the press box was tuned to Bowden’s greatest hits. I started thinking about what I would want people to say at my funeral.\n\nThe Auburn fans were reveling in the avalanche of points. They were so loud my crew could not hear me screaming into my walkie-talkie to turn Bowden’s wireless microphone off. By the time I made my way from the press box to the sideline, the damage was done.\n\nA few days later, Bowden had heard rumors that the Auburn coaches were hearing his plays on the radio. I assured him with some flashy technical language that it could never happen. (I had two small children and my death would not have changed the outcome of the game.)\n\n'Good call'\n\nNow fast forward eight years, and Bowden’s son Terry gets the head coaching job at Auburn. His coaches tell him about the time they heard his dad’s plays broadcast on the radio and Terry shares that story with Bowden. Bowden calls me into his office and tells me what Terry had shared.\n\nWithout hesitation I confirmed the validity of the story. Bowden looked me in the eye and held up his “what the heck” hands. I told him that by not confessing in 1985, I got to watch my kids grow up. He laughed, and begrudgingly agreed. And in his perfect Bowdenesque way, he simply said, “Good call.”\n\nThe show turned out to be a hit and was awarded a silver medal at the New York International Film Festival. You can go to YouTube and search “Bobby Bowden: Finding A Way.” It’s worth 90 minutes to savor that slice of FSU football history.\n\nI’ve watched the show a few times over the years. I fast forward past the Auburn game. Some wounds never heal.\n\nI’m guessing Coach Taggart won’t be taking my calls.\n\nGary Yordon is a host of the political WCTV program “The Usual Suspects” and president of The Zachary Group.
