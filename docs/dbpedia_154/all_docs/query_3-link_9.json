        "text": "THE TELEVISION SET WAS ON THE OTHER DAY IN the family room at the\n\nTallahassee home of Florida State coach Bobby Bowden. Of course it\n\nwas turned to a football game. Bobby wasn't around; hip-deep in his\n\nquest for a national championship, he was off tending to his\n\nSeminoles. But his son Terry, the Auburn coach, was there; hip-deep\n\nin adulation after the Tigers' undefeated season, he was ensconced\n\nbefore the TV screen like a visiting potentate, watching others play\n\nthe game he and his team dominated this fall.\n\nIronically, Terry has come shockingly close to winning the\n\nnational title that has so far eluded his father. Terry went 11-0 in\n\nhis first year as coach of a major-college program, a feat\n\nunprecedented in NCAA history. Auburn almost surely won't be named\n\nthe national champion, however, because probation for a number of\n\nNCAA rules violations will prevent the Tigers from proving themselves\n\nin a bowl game on New Year's Day.\n\n''Are we the best team in the country?'' Bowden says. ''I dunno.''\n\nStill, in a season in which a lot of teams -- Nebraska, West\n\nVirginia, Florida State, Notre Dame -- might be the best but none\n\nhas established it conclusively, Auburn can lay as legitimate a claim\n\nto the No. 1 ranking as any other pretender. And what if Nebraska and\n\nWest Virginia, the only other major undefeated teams, lose in bowls?\n\nAuburn alone would be unbeaten, with significant notches in its belt\n\nfrom having played in perhaps the nation's toughest conference.\n\nYet Bowden is disarmingly candid about his Tigers and what they\n\naccomplished. He acts as if he would be downright frightened to play\n\na team like, say, Florida State. But if he had to, he says, his\n\nstrategy would be to ''kidnap Charlie Ward or sneak into ((my\n\nfather's)) house and steal the game plans.'' Asked what might happen\n\nif Auburn had to play the 1993 season over again, Bowden replies\n\nimmediately, ''We wouldn't win as many as we did.'' Indeed, the\n\nTigers' games with Ole Miss, Vanderbilt, Florida and Alabama were\n\neminently losable. Bowden likes to say that Auburn's success was a\n\ncase of ''a good team playing great.'' But that's not right. It was a\n\ncase of an average team playing miraculously.\n\nAnd that may be the biggest tribute of all to the fledgling genius\n\nof Terry Wilson Bowden, 37, the younger half of the first father-son\n\nteam ever to coach football in Division I-A at the same time.\n\nActually, at 5 ft. 6 in. and 160 pounds, the chubby-cheeked Bowden\n\nlooks more like an overgrown jockey than a football coach. (After\n\nthis year's Alabama game, Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist\n\nFurman Bisher wrote that Bowden looked ''like a Boy Scout who'd just\n\nmade Eagle.'')\n\nLooks deceive. Already, Bowden is a giant among coaches. ''I don't\n\nlack confidence,'' he says. ''I know who's in charge.''\n\nBy age 26, Bowden was the youngest head football coach in the\n\ncountry, leading the NAIA's Salem (W.Va.) College from 1983 to '85.\n\nThen, after a year as an assistant to Gerry Faust at Akron, Bowden\n\nmoved to Samford University in Birmingham, which was then in Division\n\nIII, and stayed five years. Bowden readily admits that if he did not\n\nhave one of the most recognizable surnames in college football, he\n\nwould not have gotten any of his jobs. But as it is, Bowden was\n\nclearly born to coach. ''I love big-time football,'' he says of his\n\ncurrent job, ''and this is as big as it gets.''\n\nHow did he work such magic in his first year at Auburn?\n\n-- He immediately embraced his beleaguered predecessor, Pat Dye,\n\nwho had to quit because of what the NCAA snoops were finding.\n\nBowden, hired on Dec. 17, 1992, praised Dye to the skies. Yet he\n\nwas realistic about the team Dye left him. ''I don't think we have a\n\ngreat football team,'' Bowden said early this season. ''There is just\n\nno way we have a great assortment of talent.'' Dye in turn backed him\n\nup. ''Terry inherited a hungry football team,'' Dye would say during\n\nthe fall, ''but not the most talented.''\n\n-- Bowden set reasonable goals. He concedes that he had hoped only\n\nfor the Tigers to be better in 1993 than they were in '92 when they\n\nwon five games. But he didn't think they'd be a lot better. ''I was\n\nhoping 6-5,'' he admits. ''I just didn't realize we could be this\n\ngood.''\n\n-- He greatly simplified the offense. Bowden insists, in fact,\n\nthat he made it even simpler than the offense he ran at Samford in\n\n1992, because Auburn lacked both speed and skill. The Tigers went\n\nwith six running plays and 12 passing plays. ''See,'' Bowden explains\n\npatiently, ''it's not what you know but what you can get the players\n\nto learn. If you set out to try to teach 'em everything you know as a\n\ncoach, you're in trouble.''\n\n-- He immediately began praising Stan White, the beseiged senior\n\nquarterback (page 86). Bowden pumped White up, then buffed him to a\n\nhigh gloss. ''Maybe we haven't fallen off at quarterback,'' Bowden\n\nsaid soon after his arrival in Auburn. ''Maybe it's just that we fell\n\noff at a time when Stan was our quarterback. Mostly I think he has\n\nbeen guilty of trying too hard to win. I don't believe Stan White can\n\nwin it all by himself this year, and I do not believe that he will be\n\nthe reason if we lose.'' In order to deflect criticism from White,\n\nBowden pointed out that, from the talented 1989 recruiting class that\n\nincluded White, only eight of 24 players had stuck it out. And,\n\nBowden said, there was not one NFL first-round choice on White's\n\nteam. All this made White feel a whole lot better about himself --\n\nand allowed him to perform better on the field.\n\n-- Bowden insisted on hiring exactly the staff he wanted. For\n\nexample, Dye's defensive coordinator, Wayne Hall, had been a finalist\n\nfor the head job but was hampered by his alleged involvement in the\n\nNCAA violations. Athletic director Mike Lude was not keen on\n\nretaining Hall, but Bowden wanted him and was firm about it. Hall is\n\nstill the defensive coordinator. Then there was the sticky wicket of\n\nBowden's older brother Tommy, who had been offensive coordinator\n\nunder Dye. Terry promptly named himself offensive coordinator and\n\ndemoted Tommy to receivers' coach. Despite that, all is well between\n\nthem. Finally, Terry hired his brother-in-law Jack Hines to coach\n\nthe defensive backs. (When anyone asks whether Terry might have too\n\nmany relatives on the staff, he bristles. ''Absolutely not,'' he\n\nsays, ''and if I could hire Jeff, I would.'' Terry's younger brother\n\nJeff was once the receivers' coach at Alabama and now has the same\n\njob at Southern Mississippi. ''I want people around me to whom\n\nfootball means a lot,'' says Terry. ''It means a lot to members of my\n\nfamily.'')\n\n-- Bowden made the Tigers confident again. ''The players had so\n\nmuch adversity that they were doubting themselves,'' he says. ''They\n\nno longer had faith in the truism that 'if I do the little things and\n\nI work hard, I'm going to be successful,' because they played so hard\n\nand they wanted to win so bad and they lost. But I'm a pretty\n\nconfident person. And I have this undying belief that things will\n\nwork out.'' The key to making his players feel the same way was\n\nwinning the season opener against Ole Miss, which had handled the\n\nTigers easily the previous year. But Bowden had a backup plan if the\n\nTigers lost: ''If we stumble,'' he said privately before the game,\n\n''then I'm going to convince our players that it's part of the\n\nbuilding process.'' That speech is still on hold.\n\n-- Bowden tolerated no excuses. Neither probation nor injuries nor\n\nbad weather nor gloom of night would keep the Tigers from the swift\n\ncompletion of their appointed rounds. ''We are going to play as good\n\nas we can play,'' the coach said as the season began. That philosophy\n\nheld through Auburn's final win, over Alabama, on the eve of which\n\nBowden said, ''There is no possibility of a letdown, there is no\n\npossibility of a lack of effort.'' This steely determination had been\n\nthoroughly tested, since Auburn trailed its opponent in eight of its\n\n11 games. But, as Bowden notes, ''My dad always says there is nothing\n\nless important than a halftime score.''\n\n-- Bowden lost only two starting players to injury, and one of\n\nthem, cornerback Otis Mounds, was gone for only the Alabama game. The\n\nother player, safety Fred Smith, was hurt before the season started\n\nand never played. White, of course, departed with strained ligaments\n\nin his left knee with 6:22 left in the third quarter of the Alabama\n\ngame. ''We just worked as hard as we could with what we had,'' says\n\nBowden. ''I have always believed that injuries are not as frequent\n\nwhen you are winning.''\n\n-- Bowden developed what most coaches try yet fail to achieve: a\n\nbalanced attack. The Tigers rushed for 2,432 yards and passed for\n\n2,188 -- a solid 53%- 47% split. Bowden did it with mirrors and\n\nsleight-of-hand. He had to. The numbers don't lie. This team that\n\nsome are arguing is the best in the country ranked 15th in total\n\ndefense, 21st in rushing defense, 21st in rushing offense and 25th in\n\ntotal offense. And even within the 12-team SEC, the Tigers were only\n\nsixth in third-down conversions, seventh in turnover ratio, 10th in\n\nsacks and 11th in fourth-down conversions. They were first in nothing\n\nexcept wins. Explains Bowden, ''Football is a game played with the\n\nheart and with the head.''\n\nBefore he graduated in 1975 from Morgantown (W.Va.) High, where he\n\nwas a first-team All State running back, Terry Bowden witnessed the\n\nunnerving spectacle of his father's being hung in effigy by fans of\n\nthe West Virginia Mountaineers, whom Bobby coached from 1970 to '75.\n\nNevertheless, Terry stayed in Morgantown and went on to earn a\n\nbachelor's degree in accounting from West Virginia with a 3.65\n\naverage, good for magna cum laude. He was even a running back on the\n\nfootball team in the '77-78 season, although he never started in a\n\ngame. He did postgraduate study at Oxford University in England and\n\nreturned to earn a law degree from Florida State in 1982. It was not\n\na typical educational path for a football coach.\n\nAnd Bowden has continued to walk where others have not. A fellow\n\nnamed Paul Bryant was 5-4-1 in his first season at Alabama; starting\n\nout at Florida State, one Bobby Bowden was 5-6. And both the Bear and\n\nBobby had already been head coaches at other major schools. Terry,\n\nfresh out of the ''minors'' of college ball, is the first\n\nmajor-college coach ever to go undefeated and untied his first year.\n\n(Barry Switzer came closest when he went 10-0-1 at Oklahoma his first\n\nseason, in 1973.)\n\nHow much is Bowden appreciated by the Auburn faithful? For the\n\nAlabama game, the usual telephone service was in operation to allow\n\nfans, especially those outside of radio range, to hear the broadcast;\n\nmore than 59,000 people called in, blowing out the system.\n\nBowden is fortunate to have started off perfectly, because Dye was\n\nnot only very successful (99-39-4 over 12 years, with four SEC titles\n\nand nine bowl appearances), but also very popular. If they had been\n\nallowed to vote, Auburn fans would have disregarded the NCAA's\n\ncriticism of Dye's program and chosen overwhelmingly to keep Dye on."
