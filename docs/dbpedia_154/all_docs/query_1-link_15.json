        "text": "From outstanding student-athlete, to 1993 National Coach of the Year, to one of college football’s leading television personalities, to much sought after keynote speaker, Terry Bowden has known what it takes to be a success at whatever he does.\n\nAfter lettering two years as a running back at West Virginia University and graduating magna cum laude in Accounting, Terry went on to earn his Law Degree from Florida State University, and do post-graduate work at Oxford University in England.\n\nHe then became the youngest head football coach in America at the age of 26 and the youngest Div1A head coach at the age of 36. In 1993, at Auburn University, Coach Bowden became the first coach in history to go undefeated in his very first year in Div1A and was named the unanimous National Coach of the Year.\n\nFollowing his stint at Auburn, Terry went on to become one of college football’s leading television broadcasters hosting the ABC Studio Show at Times Square in New York City.\n\nIn 2009, Terry Bowden followed his heart back into his first love of coaching. He is currently the head football coach at the University of Akron, and in 2015 led the Zips to their best season ever and first bowl victory in school history. He has a career record of 164-99-2 which ranks him as the sixth winningest football coach in Division 1 football.\n\nBowden is a member of one of the most famous and successful college football families of all time. His father, Bobby, won two National Championships at Florida State and his 377 victories rank second in Division 1 history. Brother, Tommy was the head coach at Tulane and Clemson, and, brother, Jeff, has been a long-time assistant.\n\nBobby (at FSU) and Terry (at Auburn) became the first father-son combo to serve as head coaches in Div1A football at the same time and Bobby (at FSU) and Tommy (at Clemson) became the first father-son combo ever to coach against each other as head coaches.\n\nDuring the decade of the nineties, in a feat that will likely never be repeated, all three Bowden head coaches went undefeated in Div1A and were named National Coach of the Year. Together they amassed 631 victories and stand as the winningest family in the history of college football.\n\nBuilding teams and winning football games seem to be a part of Terry Bowden’s DNA as he has taken five losing programs and turned them all into winners.\n\nTerry will share his knowledge and insights into building a winning team or organization through motivation, leadership and teamwork. Using a balanced mix of his unique humor, relatable stories, and entertaining anecdotes, Terry leaves his audiences with real world skills to implement in their own businesses, careers, and lives."
