        "text": "Follow Akron Football on Twitter\n\nThe younger brother of UA head coach Terry Bowden, Jeff Bowden boasts more than 30 years of collegiate coaching experience. In his seventh season on the staff, he has expanded his duties in 2018, now serving as the offensive passing game coordinator duties as well as the wide receivers coach. He previously served as the Zips’ special teams coordinator for six seasons (2012-17).\n\nIn 2017, the Zips (7-7 overall, 6-2 MAC) soared to first place in the MAC East with huge victories over Ohio and Kent State to claim the division title and a spot in the MAC Championship game for the second time in program history and first time since 2005. Akron also advanced to an FBS bowl for the second time in three years, another program first. The Zips won their third consecutive Wagon Wheel (and fourth in last five years) over rival Kent State. Akron’s 24 passing touchdowns ranked third for passing touchdowns in a season. The Zips set records for most punts in a season (88). Redshirt senior wide receiver Tra’Von Chapman earned third-team All-MAC honors, while senior wide receiver Anthony Young earned Academic All-MAC honors.\n\nIn 2016, Bowden took newcomer JoJo Natson under his wing. Natson earned first-team All-MAC honors at returner and second-team honors at receiver. He was nationally ranked all season, finishing the year at No. 2 in punt return touchdowns (2), No. 2 in punt returns (16.3), and No. 21 in receiving touchdowns (10). Eclipsing the 100-yard receiving mark in two games, Natson was named the Zips’ Offensive and Special Teams Player of the Year. Overall, Akron was nationally ranked at No. 3 in punt returns (17.53), No. 21 in blocked punts (1), and No. 41 in blocked kicks (2). Junior wide receiver Jerome Lane earned third-team All-MAC honors. Lane (New York Giants) and JoJo Natson (Indianapolis) signed rookie free agent contracts with NFL teams.\n\nIn 2015, Bowden mentored senior kicker Robert Stein and senior punter Zach Paul, a Ray Guy Award nominee, through their final seasons. A four-time Academic All-MAC selection, Stein was UA’s scoring leader for the fourth consecutive season. He became Akron’s career scoring leader (268) while also finishing his career first in total kicking points (268) and extra points (130). Stein was named the MVP at the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. Paul finished as the career leader in most punts (275), punting yards (11,529), and highest punting average (41.8). He also set the season record for punting yards (3,276). Additionally, Bowden helped in the transition of sophomore Jerome Lane as he added receiver duties to his defensive skills. Lane was No. 12 nationally in yards per reception (20.05).\n\nIn 2014, the Akron kick return defense emerged as one of the toughest in the nation, with the Zips holding opponents to just 19.26 yards per return. That mark ranked second in the MAC and 30th nationally in 2014. Junior Robert Stein ranked 25th nationally in field goal percentage (.813) and earned Academic All-MAC honors for a third-straight season. Junior punter Zach Paul opened the 2014 campaign on the Ray Guy Award Watch List. He ranked 39th nationally in punting average (42.5 ypp).\n\nDuring the 2013 campaign, Bowden mentored sophomore punter Zach Paul, who earned third-team All-MAC honors. Paul finished the season 30th in the nation in punting average (42.9 ypp). In addition to Paul’s performance, the Akron kick return squad finished the year 11th in the nation in kick return defense (18.36 ypr). Additionally, Akron blocked four kicks, the most in the MAC and 10th-most in the nation.\n\nIn 2012, Bowden worked with All-MAC Team pick senior wideout Marquelo Suel, who posted a team-high 820 receiving yards off 76 catches. Suel’s team-high receptions were the second most in a single season in program history. Additionally, he closed out the regular season ranked fifth in the MAC and tied for 28th nationally in catches per game (6.3). Suel was also named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award Watch List.\n\nIn the three seasons prior to his post at Akron, Bowden was associate head coach and receivers coach at North Alabama with his brother Terry, helping the program to a 29-9 record during that time and a Gulf South Conference championship in 2009.\n\nBefore his tenure at UNA, he spent 13 years (1994-2006) on the staff at Florida State, working under his father, legendary coach Bobby Bowden. Jeff was the Seminoles’ offensive coordinator from 2001-06 and from 1994-2000 worked with the receivers. He began his collegiate coaching career in 1983 as a receivers coach at Salem College, when Terry was hired as the head coach, and in 1985 was promoted to offensive coordinator.\n\nIn 1986, he served as a graduate assistant coach at Florida State before rejoining Terry on Samford’s staff the following year. Jeff was offensive coordinator for the Bulldogs from 1987-90 and was credited with guiding the career of current Texas A&M head coach Jimbo Fisher in his time as quarterback.\n\nBowden, 58 (born Dec. 30, 1959), played wide receiver at FSU from 1980-83. He and his wife Cindi have five children– Haley, Hunter, T.J., Robert, and Julia Elizabeth– and two grandsons– Owen and Henry Byers.\n\nBowden’s Year-By-Year Coaching Experience:\n\n1983-84 – Salem College (receivers)\n\n1985 – Salem College (offensive coordinator)\n\n1986 – Florida State (graduate assistant)\n\n1987-90 – Samford (offensive coordinator)\n\n1991-00 – Florida State (receivers)\n\n2001-06 – Florida State (offensive coordinator)\n\n2009-11 – North Alabama (associate head coach | receivers)\n\n2012-17 – Akron (special teams coordinator | wide receivers)\n\n2018- Akron (offensive passing game coordinator | wide receivers)"
