        "text": "When Florida State's Jimbo Fisher walks onto Bobby Bowden Field Saturday for his debut as a head coach, it will be another Bowden that can take some of the credit for the rise of this 44-year-old son of a West Virginia coal miner.\n\nBack when Fisher was making his coaching bones, it was Bobby's son, Terry, who saw the potential in Fisher and started cultivating the future coach. Those sessions occurred first when Fisher played for Terry at Salem College and then Samford, FSU's opponent Saturday and the place where Fisher was the Division national player of the year in 1987.\n\nThe bond continued when Fisher coached under Terry at Samford and then Auburn.\n\n\"We were pretty much inseparable,\" Terry Bowden said recently. \"We didn't go to a game where he didn't ride in my car at Salem and Samford and Auburn.\"\n\nFisher forged a reputation as an offensive coach with a special talent for working with quarterbacks at every stop, including Cincinnati, LSU and three years at FSU under Bobby Bowden.\n\nHis understanding of the position - along with the leadership qualities that have put him in position to succeed Bobby Bowden - allowed him to be successful at virtually every stop.\n\n\"The two most important people on a football team are the coach and quarterback,\" Terry Bowden said. \"That coach who works with a quarterback needs to have the quality of a head coach and has to have the leadership and confidence.\n\n\"Jimbo always had leadership qualities.\"\n\nFSU quarterback Christian Ponder agreed.\n\n\"He was a quarterback, he's been through the system that he teaches,\" Ponder said. \"He really just understands the game. He's the most knowledgeable offensive guy. He knows everything about football (and) schemes.\"\n\nThat process started at Salem when Fisher transferred to the small West Virginia College after one semester at Clemson, where he was going to play baseball.\n\nBowden welcomed Fisher, who was a classic pro-style quarterback. Bowden soon left Salem and when he wound up at Samford in 1987, Fisher decided to jump to the Birmingham school for his final season.\n\nThe move was made with his coaching future in mind.\n\nFisher said he wanted to get back into \"a system I had grown up in and wanted to play in. I wanted to coach. I thought it would be the best move for (me).\"\n\nClassmate Tommy Rohling was moved from running back to nose tackle that year so he saw Fisher from both sides of the line.\n\n\"If there ever was a leader, it was Jimbo,\" said Rohling, currently the head strength and conditioning coach at Samford.\n\n\"He was a rallying point on the team. He made believers out of us real quick. I remember sitting with him in team meetings and saying 'what does he see that I don't see?\"'\n\nSamford improved from 3-7 the year before Bowden and Fisher arrived to 9-1 in 1987. Fisher finished the season with 2,394 passing yards and 40 touchdowns, 34 through the air.\n\nFisher joined Bowden's staff in 1988 and after three years as a student and graduate assistant, he was hired full-time as the offensive coordinator. All the while he worked with the quarterbacks.\n\n\"Once I started coaching I always said I wanted to be a head coach,\" Fisher said. \"But I always wondered if I could.\"\n\nFisher followed Bowden to Auburn in 1993. There, he turned Dameyune Craig into a record-setting quarterback. But it wasn't easy, not when Craig's first instincts were to tuck the ball and run, something he did during one game for a long touchdown. Fisher was not amused. He pulled aside Craig and asked why he didn't throw the ball to the fullback in the flat. Craig told Fisher he thought he could score.\n\n\"He said, 'The first thing you have to learn in this league is you have to beat people with your head first and not your legs to be successful,\"' said Craig.\n\nCraig learned, and quick. In fact, Fisher hired him to be the Seminoles' quarterback coach.\n\nWhen Fisher looks across the field for Saturday's kickoff, he will be reminded of where it all started.\n\n\"I've got a lot of my roots in ball from there,\" Fisher said. \"I loved Birmingham. I loved being at Samford. It was six of the greatest years of my life.\""
