        "text": "Bobby Bowden's true greatness was in routine moments that most didn't get to see | Estes\n\nHe and his wife Ann lived in the same house for decades. In Tallahassee, most everyone knew where that was, and if not, it wasn’t difficult to find out.\n\nThe legendary Bobby Bowden was listed in the phone book.\n\nThat wasn’t always the best idea. Rival fans or angry ones, of course, would call from time to time. They’d pester and leave nasty messages.\n\nSo much that Jeff Purinton, Florida State football’s former sports information director, asked Bowden one time: Why stay listed? “We can avoid all this.”\n\nBOBBY BOWDEN DIES: Legendary coach built Florida State into college football powerhouse\n\n“He goes, ‘Well, I may have some on my old buddies or my friends from Birmingham that might be coming through or want to get in touch with me, and they need to be able to know how to call me,’” said Purinton, now executive deputy athletics director at the University of Alabama.\n\n“That was Coach Bowden.”\n\nSunday morning’s news that Bowden, 91, had died was sad, though not shocking. It had been public knowledge he wasn't doing well health-wise. This column, I knew it was coming soon. I’d already started writing it in my head a few weeks ago.\n\nMy sadness, dadgummit, comes from the fact that I know no one else will get the chance to meet Bowden.\n\nAnd since I did, I want them to understand what we’ve lost.\n\nHe was special. He was greatness. As a person. Not just as a football coach, though his record certainly speaks for itself. More than wins and losses, though, there will never be another so wildly successful for so long who remained so wonderfully unchanged and genuinely gracious.\n\n“They talk about people who’ve never met a stranger, but I mean, that was him,” said ESPN reporter Mark Schlabach, who authored the book “Called to Coach,” a biography of Bowden. “He’d talk to anybody. &mldr; He was just a genuinely nice guy. I’ve met a lot of coaches I like, but very few were as welcoming or as courteous as he was.”\n\nIn a world where greats are too often toppled and reputations muddied, how many can attain such fame without so much as a bad word being uttered about them?\n\nSo many great stories about Bowden. Some we know, most we don't.\n\nRemember that scene in \"We Are Marshall\" when Bowden — as the coach at West Virginia — let the staff at rival Marshall use his facility and equipment while rebuilding from a devastating plane crash in 1970? That really happened. (Bowden had actually been offered the Marshall job before that crash and wrote years later \"that probably saved my life by not going there.\")\n\nAlabama coach Nick Saban, a West Virginia native, has long told a story about Bowden calling and offering to make room on his staff at WVU after Saban's father passed away so he'd have a chance to be closer to his mother.\n\n\"Coach didn't know me from Adam's house cat,\" Saban said. \"... How many coaches would do that? How many people would do that?\"\n\nPersonally, I was fortunate enough to get to know Bowden years ago as a cub reporter fresh out of college, sent to cover an elite program at Florida State. I'm sure he wouldn't have remembered our interactions then, but I always will.\n\nTerry Bowden on Bobby Bowden: 'I couldn’t have asked for a better personal mentor than my father'\n\nSaban remembers Bowden: Alabama football coach Nick Saban reacts to Bobby Bowden's death: 'A wonderful friend'\n\nBowden had this way about him. As the saying goes, people don’t remember what you said as much as how you made them feel. Bowden treated me as if he had nothing to do but sit there and chat. Didn't matter who I was or how well he knew me. Every word I said was important. Zero ulterior motive. He was that way with everyone.\n\n“I think that is the best compliment one could receive,” former FSU and Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart said of Bowden years ago. “His core values and character, his display of genuine respect for others and his willingness to give of his time and himself to the many who reached out to him remained constant through the good times and the challenging times. We should all wish for that to be our legacy.”\n\nIn 2014, Bowden advised readers in a Reddit Q&A to “Make God number 1, family number 2, other people your third priority, which is hard to do. Put people before yourself.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a good quote: ‘I served God's purpose for my life,'\" Bowden wrote. \"If I don't do that, I don't think I did anything. For football, I want people to remember ‘He did it the right way.’”\n\nNote that he differentiated between the two, personal and professional. Football was mentioned last.\n\nWhen you work in a world of millionaire coaches under immense pressure to recruit and win, you notice things like that. And perhaps you realize more than most how special and rare Bowden was. Because in his case, you believe every word of it.\n\nHe was the genuine deal, memorable for all the right reasons, a throwback in the best way possible, too good for today's coaching climate. And as tempting as it is to say he was part of a bygone generation of coaching, that’s implying there was another who was ever equal to him in this way. He was one of a kind all along.\n\nThere will never be another Bobby Bowden.\n\n“I always tell people he’s the best person I’ve ever known,” Purinton said, “because he genuinely cared about others — no matter who you were — more than himself.\n\n“And people say that, but he lived it.”\n\nReach Gentry Estes at gestes@tennessean.com and on Twitter @Gentry_Estes."
