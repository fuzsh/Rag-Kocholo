        "text": "In three years before Bowden under Darrel Mudra and Larry Jones, the Seminoles went 4-29. Bowden went 5-6 in his first year, matching the win total of the last 3 combined years.\n\nThis would be Bowden's worst ever year. He would never again have a losing season.\n\nBowden had a winning record every year for 32 consecutive years (1977-2009)\n\nBowden led FSU to winning seasons in 4 decades, and was one winning season away from 5 decades\n\nBowden made Florida State bowl eligible for 27 consecutive seasons (1982-2009)\n\nBowden won a bowl game at Florida State for 11 consecutive years (1985-1996)\n\nBowden had Florida State finish in the AP top 5 for 14 consecutive seasons (1987-2000), double USC's second place at 7.\n\nFSU did not even award athletic scholarships until 1951, 50 years after rival school Florida.\n\nBobby Bowden won the ACC 12 out of his 14 seasons in it, enough for second ever, , including 9 consecutive, and 12 in 14 years. This is despite FSU joining in the 90s, giving teams such as Clemson, Maryland, NC State, Duke, and Virginia a 50 year head start\n\nIf you dont include ties, Bowden did not lose a single bowl game from 1982 to 1996, going 13-0-1\n\nAt the time of his retirement, he was the only coach to lead his team to 14 straight seasons with 10 or more wins (1987-2000)\n\nBowden led the greatest 4th quarter comeback in CFB history, coming back 31-3 in the fourth quarter against Florida, eventually tying at 31 in what would be called \" The Choke At Doak\"\n\nBowden originally viewed FSU as a stopgap, a rung in the ladder to eventually coach for his favorite team, the Alabama Crimson Tide. In 1986, Alabama needed a new head coach, and the interest was mutual between the two sides. Interest was so high that many higherups on both sides beleived it was effectively a done deal. But complications emerged, Bowden originally refused an interview, claiming his decade of success at FSU was enough to speak for itself, but the Alabama AD refused to relent. Reluctantly he agreed to one, and after the interview was over, they did not offer him the job. Enraged and embarassed by this treatment by his former dreamjob, he took his name out of the running immediantly and returned to Tallahassee. Four years later, after both the HC and AD from that situation were gone, Bowden was offered the job officially but after much consideration declined."
