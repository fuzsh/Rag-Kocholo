        "text": "Akron’s 41-0 victory over Howard impressed, as it probably should have.\n\nLess impressive was the team’s running game against the Bison. The Zips netted just 113 yards on the ground against their FCS opponent and 48 of those came courtesy of quarterback Kyle Pohl, who added 308 yards passing and four touchdowns. Those numbers netted him Mid-American Conference East Offensive Player of the Week honors.\n\nBut senior running back Jawon Chisholm and junior running back Conor Hundley had only 46 yards combined.\n\n“The quarterback scrambling and getting 50 yards a game, you’d like to see that happen every game,” Zips coach Terry Bowden said. “The top college programs and even the pros are taking advantage of some of the coverages and running the ball a lot more.”\n\nPohl sees things a bit differently.\n\n“Not all of those were needed scrambles,” he said. “But it was just a thing where I might not have seen what I wanted to see or what I needed to see.”\n\nIn fact, he said he prefers to stand in the pocket longer and find a receiver.\n\nBowden said Pohl’s running is part of the overall strategy.\n\n“We just need to pop a few more runs,” he said, “and we need to do a little better in that running attack than we did.”\n\nBowden said he expects the Zips to average 5 yards per carry, not 2. Considering the Zips travel Saturday to Penn State — which gave up only 24 rushing yards on 29 carries to the University of Central Florida last weekend — it probably will be emphasized in practice this week.\n\nAn actual lull\n\nAfter starting the game with a 21-0 lead against the Bison, the Zips offense stagnated and went scoreless in the second quarter.\n\nPohl was under more pressure, but Bowden wouldn’t lay the blame on a revamped offensive line that included two new tackles. Instead, the Bison brought an all-out blitz.\n\n“We jumped them so bad, their goal in the second quarter was to come out and do something different,” he said.\n\nA couple of adjustments to allow Pohl to hit quick passes would have helped, Bowden said.\n\nTommy Brown update\n\nFormer Firestone High School standout Tommy Brown, who transferred from Ohio State, was supposed to be one of the Zips’ new tackles. Instead, Brown remains in limbo as the NCAA debates his fate.\n\n“They’re meeting on it [Tuesday] I believe,” he said. “Last week, they wanted more information on his case. It’s not the first time I had that happen.”\n\nBowden and the team are maintaining their patience.\n\n“I guess you want it to be resolved as quickly as possible, if it can,” he said. “Also, as long as they say they need more information, that means there is something there they’re interested in.”\n\nNo loafing\n\nThe Zips defense collectively swarmed the Bison on Saturday. Included in those efforts was a goal-line stand that kept Howard out of the end zone at the end of the second quarter.\n\nBowden said defensive coordinator Chuck Amato told him that the team had eight team “loafs” — when one player on a unit takes the play off.\n\n“That’s the least he’s had as long as he’s been coaching,” Bowden said. “That says a ton about the team’s desire to get to the football and nobody not buying into what it takes. That’s how well they played from a standpoint of effort-wise.”\n\nKicking duties\n\nBowden split the Zips’ kicking duties, with junior Robert Stein kicking off and freshman Tom O’Leary handling placekicks.\n\nO’Leary, however, missed an extra point (which was blocked) and a chip-shot field goal Saturday night. Bowden chalked it up to nerves.\n\n“I would hope that would be the best way to explain it,” he said.\n\nAlthough the kickers’ battle is ongoing, Bowden said he isn’t worried about O’Leary."
