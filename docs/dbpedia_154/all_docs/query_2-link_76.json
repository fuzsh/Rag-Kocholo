        "text": "OCALA - Through the haze engulfing Marion County on Tuesday, you could just barely make him out.\n\nFrom a distance, the 160-yard slice could've belonged to just about anyone. This one just happened to belong to the all-time winningest coach in major college football history.\n\nPerhaps it wasn't evident during a turbulent 2006 season, when, for the first time in 30 years, Bobby Bowden's judgement was called into question by followers of Florida State football. His son, offensive coordinator Jeff Bowden, was the lightning rod for everything that went wrong during a 6-6 regular season that featured a third straight loss to Florida, an embarrassing 30-0 home loss to Wake Forest and more questions than answers.\n\nBut fast-forward to May, when everyone is 0-0, and Bowden is as beloved by boosters as ever during a career that includes 366 victories, a winning percentage of .762 and 28 bowl appearances in 31 seasons in Tallahassee.\n\nFrom 1987-2000, the Seminoles won 10-or-more games every season, and finished each year among the AP top five.\n\nRecent seasons haven't produced the same types of numbers, but Bowden remains FSU royalty while the Seminoles plot a rebound, and the Marion County Seminole Club welcomed the record-breaking coach to its annual golf-and-banquet gathering on Tuesday at the Country Club of Ocala and the Ocala Hilton.\n\n\"We've been blessed the last five or six years in that we've kind of lived off our reputation, but it's time to get back on top again,\" Bowden said after Tuesday's golf round. \"We will do it. When? I don't know, but we will do it.\n\n\"We've got an excellent staff now, probably the best in the country. The coaches we've brought in are all proven. It won't be a situation where we have to find out 'can they coach?' We brought in (LSU offensive coordinator) Jimbo Fisher, who many think is the best assistant coach in the country, got a great (offensive) line coach in Rick Trickett, and brought back Chuck Amato.\"\n\nAmato was on Bowden's FSU staff from 1982-99 before accepting the head coaching position at North Carolina State, where he was 49-37 in seven seasons before being fired late last year.\n\n\"When Chuck was with us before, we never lost a conference championship and won two national titles,\" said Bowden, who led FSU to ACC titles the first nine years the Seminoles were members. \"Then he leaves, and (with N.C. State) beats us four dadgum times.\"\n\nBowden also brought former FSU stars and NFL players Lawrence Dawsey and Dexter Carter to help fill out the staff.\n\nBowden maintains a glass-half-full approach, and believes a 44-27 victory over UCLA to wrap up an otherwise disappointing season has more meaning than what meets the eye.\n\n\"If you play that way every game, you win about 12,\" Bowden said of the season-ending effort. \"We lost by three (points), lost by four. The most we lost by was seven, except to Wake Forest. They beat the heck out of us, you know. We just didn't get things done, and wound up (7-6), which was new to us. That UCLA game was a big booster, because they had just knocked off USC, who looked like they were fixing to play for a national championship. But our kids played like we used to play. That's the way you want to go (into the offseason).\"\n\nThe Emerald Bowl victory did more than just send the Seminoles into 2007 on an upbeat note. It allowed FSU to avoid its first losing season since Bowden's debut in 1976, when the Seminoles went 5-6 - a victory total that surpassed FSU's previous three seasons combined.\n\nWhile Bowden has turned around his fortunes against longtime nemesis Miami, winning the last two against the Hurricanes on ABC Labor Day primetime slots, he has lost ground against Florida. The Gators have won three straight over FSU for the first time since the mid-1980s, and parlayed their latest into Urban Meyer's first national title.\n\nThe Seminoles trade Miami for Clemson in this year's Labor Day time slot, setting up \"Bowden Bowl IX\" as Bobby opens the season against his son, Clemson coach Tommy Bowden. FSU has 12 ACC titles in 15 seasons in the league, one off the conference record of 13 held by Clemson, one of the ACC's founding members which won its first ACC crown in 1956.\n\nThis season's schedule includes a trip to Colorado, and Bowden's first meeting with Alabama, his favorite team as a boy growing up in Birmingham, Ala., and first college stop as a player. The neutral-site game is scheduled for Jacksonville on Sept. 29.\n\n\"That'll have great appeal,\" Bowden said. \"Our athletic director, Dave Hart, graduated from Alabama and he and (Alabama AD) Mal Moore got together on that thing. I knew (Alabama coach) Nick Saban when he was a little boy in West Virginia, so we go way back. That'll be fun.\"\n\nThe last time FSU played Alabama, a 1974 Seminole team that would finish 1-10 held a lead on an Alabama team that finished the regular season undefeated until a last-second field goal dropped FSU by an 8-7 count.\n\n\"When I first got to Florida State in 1976, we invited Coach (Paul) Bryant down to play golf a couple days, and he came down,\" Bowden said. \"Well, the idea was to try and get Alabama to play us. And he said, 'nah, we ain't gonna play you.' He said 'the next guy that takes my place might, but I ain't.'Ê\"\n\nSaban, Alabama's eighth coach since Bryant's retirement in 1982, isn't exactly the \"next guy,\" but will be the one at the helm for that one.\n\nOcala was the 12th of 18 stops on Bowden's booster schedule for this season. Another of his sons, former Auburn coach Terry Bowden, is accompanying his father on half the tour and provided the entertainment for Tuesday's lunch crowd at the Country Club while Bobby Bowden prepared for an evening at the Hilton.\n\nAmong Bowden's golf partners on Tuesday was Marion County resident Al Dunlap, who recently donated $10 million to FSU and has the Seminoles' football practice fields named after him.\n\n\"Al graduated from West Point, but he has an honorary doctorate (from FSU),\" Bowden said. \"He was at Florida State speaking to a group a few years ago, and everybody liked everybody. So, we started visiting with each other. Let me tell you, there ain't many like him. He's been on leadership panels with (former Soviet chief) Mikhail Gorbachev and General (Norman) Schwarzkopf.\""
