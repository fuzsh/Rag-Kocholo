        "text": "Bobby Bowden, the folksy Hall of Fame coach who built Florida State into an unprecedented college football dynasty, died early Sunday morning. He was 91.\n\nBobby's son, Terry, confirmed to The Associated Press that his father died at home in Tallahassee, Fla., surrounded by family.\n\n\"It was truly peaceful,\" Terry Bowden said in a text message to The AP.\n\nBobby Bowden announced on July 21 he had a terminal illness that Terry Bowden later said was pancreatic cancer.\n\n\"I've always tried to serve God's purpose for my life, on and off the field, and I am prepared for what is to come,\" Bowden, a devout Christian, said at the time. \"My wife, Ann, and our family have been life's greatest blessing. I am at peace.\"\n\n[Gallery not loading above? Click here for more photos Â» arkansasonline.com/89bowden/]\n\nBowden was beloved by Seminoles fans, respected by his peers and throughout his life one of the most accessible stars in college football.\n\nWith Southern charm and wit, Bowden piled up 377 wins during his 40 years as a major college coach, from tiny Samford -- his alma mater, then known as Howard College -- to West Virginia and finally at Florida State, where he went 315-98-4. The Seminoles were a force during his 34 seasons as coach, winning 12 Atlantic Coast Conference championships and national titles in 1993 and 1999.\n\nFlorida State had an unmatched run of 14 consecutive seasons (1987-2000) finishing ranked in the top five of The Associated Press college football poll under Bowden.\n\n\"Florida State University has lost a legend in the passing of Bobby Bowden,\" University President John Thrasher said in a statement. \"Coach Bowden built a football dynasty and raised the national profile of Florida State University, and he did it with class and a sense of humor.\"\n\nBowden retired following the 2009 season with a Gator Bowl win over West Virginia in Florida State's 28th straight postseason appearance, a victory that gave him his 33rd consecutive winning season. A month after he resigned, the NCAA stripped Florida State of victories in 10 sports because of an academic cheating scandal in 2006 and 2007.\n\nBowden won the national championship in 1993 with Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Charlie Ward and again in 1999 with his second Heisman winner, quarterback Chris Weinke, and All-American receiver Peter Warrick.\n\nThe Seminoles were a contender to win the title every season for more than a decade. Florida State lost national championship games against Florida, Tennessee and Oklahoma and narrowly missed out on the playing for titles in several other seasons because of losses to archrival Miami.\n\nBowden once quipped that his headstone would read, \"But he played Miami,\" a one-liner that came the day after the Hurricanes escaped with a 17-16 win in 1991 when the Seminoles missed a field goal wide right in the final seconds. Miami also won in similar fashion in 2002 when a field-goal try went wide left.\n\nBobby Bowden left West Virginia to take over a Florida State program in 1976 that had produced just four wins the three previous seasons. The Seminoles went 5-6 in Bowden's first year and never again experienced a losing season under Bowden.\n\nBy 1979, Bowden had Florida State positioned for one of the great runs in the annals of college football. Florida State dominated the ACC under Bowden, winning championships in 12 of its first 14 seasons after joining the league in 1992.\n\nIn 1993, despite a late slip at Notre Dame, Florida State won its first national title after nearly getting there in 1987, 1988, 1991 and 1992. Bowden's lone perfect season came in 1999 when the Seminoles became the first team to go wire-to-wire in the AP rankings, No. 1 from the preseason to finish.\n\n\"The first championship was more of a relief,\" Bowden said. \"I think I was able to enjoy the second one a little more.\"\n\nSuccess also brought a glaring spotlight and Bowden's program was touched by scandal on a few occasions. The school was put on NCAA probation for five years after several players in 1993 accepted free shoes and other sporting goods from a local store.\n\n\"There's only about 6 inches that turns that halo into a noose,\" Bowden was fond of saying during the good days, when he was often called \"Saint Bobby\" by the Florida State faithful.\n\nThe Seminoles won 10 or more games in 18 of Bowden's 34 seasons at Florida State, but were a relatively mortal 74-42 on the field from 2001-09.\n\nBorn Nov. 8, 1929, in Birmingham, Ala., Robert Cleckler Bowden overcame rheumatic fever as a child to quarterback Birmingham Woodlawn High School, then attended Alabama for a semester before transferring back to his hometown Howard College, where he starred at quarterback.\n\nHe married his childhood sweetheart, Ann, and they stayed together for 72 years. Florida State said a service was scheduled for Saturday at the basketball arena on campus."
