        "text": "Bobby Bowden, the folksy showman who transformed Florida State University into a national football powerhouse and became the second-winningest coach in the history of major college football, died on Sunday at his home in Tallahassee, Florida. He was 91.\n\nHis death was announced by Florida State.\n\nBowden’s health had declined after he was found to have Covid-19 in early October. Last month, his son Terry said that Bowden had pancreatic cancer.\n\nWhen Bowden became the Florida State coach in 1976, he inherited a program that had won only four games over the previous three seasons. The modest crowds at the Seminoles’ Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee had plenty of room to stretch on the metal bleachers.\n\n“When I was at Alabama the bumper stickers read ‘Beat Auburn,’ he recalled in “The Bowden Way” (2001), his book on leadership written with his son Steve. “When I was at West Virginia they read ‘Beat Pitt.’ When I came to F.S.U., the bumper stickers read ‘Beat Anybody.’”"
