An Introduction to Terry Bowden

Terry Wilson Bowden, born on February 25, 1956, in Douglas, Georgia USA, is renowned as a head football coach who has notably served at the University of Akron and Salem University, among others. He is the son of the legendary coach, Bobby Bowden.

Terry Bowdenâs Financial Status

As of late 2017, Terry Bowden holds a net worth of $13 million, primarily accumulated from his career in football. It is reported that he has earned more than $800,000 in the past two years.

Early Life, Childhood, and Education

Coming from a family deeply rooted in sports, his father, legendary football coach Bobby Bowden, worked for the Florida State Seminoles football team. Terry attended West Virginia University, where he was actively involved in football and was part of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. A diligent student, Bowden graduated with magna cum laude in accounting and pursued post-graduate studies in England at Oxford University. He ventured into football, working as a graduate assistant at Florida State and later became the youngest head football coach in the nation at the age of 26 when he began his tenure at Salem College in 1983. During his time there, Terry secured the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title twice.

Career Progress

In 1986, he served as an assistant coach at the University of Akron under Gerry Faust. A year later, he became the head coach at Samford University, overseeing the programâs transition from Division III to Division I-AAA, eventually achieving that milestone in 1991. He went on to join Auburn University as the head football coach in 1992, where his inaugural season was tremendously successful, making him the first coach to remain undefeated in his debut season in Division I. He continued his successful streak until 1998, at which point he faced criticism for issues related to player behavior and administrative conflicts.

After stepping down from his coaching role, Bowden ventured into broadcasting, serving as a studio analyst and commentator for ABC. Subsequently, he became involved as a sports journalist for Yahoo! Sports and hosted a radio talk show in Orlando for a period of time. In 2006, he commenced work at Westwood as an expert analyst. However, in 2008, Bowden returned to coaching, assuming the position of head football coach at the University of North Alabama in Florence. Under his leadership, the Lions competed in three NCAA Division II Playoffs.

In 2011, Terry began his tenure at the University of Akron. His contributions were valued, leading to an extension of his contract for two more years, maintaining his position throughout 2017-18.
