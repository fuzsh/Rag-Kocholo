        "text": "Car parks are available at most of our train stations and you can pay for daily parking tickets and car parking season tickets in a number of ways. Parking charges apply every day at train station car parks including public holidays, except on 25 and 26 December or unless stated otherwise.\n\nAt busy times (generally before 09:00 Monday to Friday) we recommend that you find a parking space before paying. Marked bays are for car parking season ticket holders only before 09:00 Monday to Friday, but after this time they can be used by anyone.\n\nBlue Badge parking\n\nParking spaces for Blue Badge holders are available at many of our stations. A valid European Blue Parking Badge must be clearly displayed when you park in a disabled parking space.\n\nParking is complimentary for Blue Badge holders who register via the link below. Where there are blue-badge parking spaces in short stay areas, charges do not apply but you must not park for longer than 20 minutes.\n\nRegister for Complimentary Blue Badge Parking.\n\nDaily parking tickets\n\nParking charges\n\nParking charges can vary at each station and depending on the time and day you park. These include peak, off-peak, Saturday, Sunday, public holiday and weekend pricing for parking.\n\nIf you’re going away for a long weekend, make the most of our weekend parking available from the anytime on Friday until the end of service on Monday.\n\nHow to pay\n\nYou can pay for parking at our stations by downloading the RingGo app. Once it’s set-up on your smartphone, you’ll get lots of great features such as text messages to tell you when your parking is running out and extending your stay virtually without having to return to your car. You can also book for parking online or calling RingGo on 01256 80 28 04.\n\nDaily parking tickets are also available from self-service ticket machines in stations.\n\nAutomatic Number Plate Registration\n\nAs part of our station improvement programme, we’re rolling out Automatic Number Plate Registration (ANPR) across some of car parks. This means you’ll no longer have to display your car parking season ticket in your car windscreen. Use our car parking availability tool either online here, or on the SWR app to see availability of car parking space at stations operating ANPR.\n\nWeekly car parking season ticket\n\nThere are many ways to buy a weekly season ticket for car parking at our stations:\n\nDownload the RingGo app, go online or call RingGo on 01256 80 28 04\n\nSelf-service ticket machines in stations\n\nMonthly car parking season ticket\n\nYou can buy a monthly season ticket for car parking at our stations from most local ticket offices, or using RingGo\n\nJust download the RingGo app, go online to find out more.\n\nQuarterly and annual car parking season tickets\n\nYou can buy a quarterly or annual season ticket for car parking at our stations from your local ticket office. These are not available at all stations.\n\nParking conditions"
