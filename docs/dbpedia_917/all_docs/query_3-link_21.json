        "text": "The Indian Railways PNR, also known as, Passenger Name Record is a number that consists of personal information of a passenger. It contains the itinerary for the passenger, or a group of passengers travelling together. It states whether the ticket has been confirmed, on waiting list (WL) or is under reservation against cancellation (RAC). It provides details of the coach and seat number, class of travel, chart status, train name, train number, booking status, current status, journey time and fare apart from the basic information about arrival and departure time of trains.\n\nTrain PNR Status Enquiry at Paytm\n\nVisit the page - https://tickets.paytm.com/trains/pnr-status\n\nEnter your pnr number in the search box.\n\nClick on the check PNR status button.\n\nPNR status will be displayed on the screen.\n\nThe PNR number consists of 10 digits, where the first 3 digits specify the PRS (Passenger Reservation System) from which the ticket is booked. The first digit of the PNR number specify that the zone of the train (starting station of the train) of the ticket. The following numbers belong to the below mentioned zones respectively.\n\n1 â Issued from the SCR zone (Secundarabad PRS)\n\n2, 3 â Issued from NR, NCR, NWR, or NER zone (New Delhi PRS)\n\n4, 5 â Issued from SR, SWR, or SCR zone (Chennai PRS)\n\n6, 7 â Issued from NFR, ECR, ER, EcoR, SER or SECR zone (Kolkata PRS)\n\n8, 9 â Issued from CR, WCR, or WR zone (Mumbai PRS)\n\nThe last 7 digits are randomly generated digits, only to make the PNR number unique.\n\nPaytm now helps you decide better on your train ticket bookings based on the probability of having the tickets confirmed. With our new âPNR Confirmation Predictionâ feature, you can now predict the confirmation probability of the waitlisted tickets, ensuring that your booked tickets get confirmed by the journey date.\n\nHow does the PNR Confirmation Prediction feature work?\n\nWhen you check the train tickets by entering the route, travel date and the class of travel, a list of trains would appear with the probability percentage of having your tickets confirmed. You can book your tickets where the confirmation probability percentage mentioned is on the higher side.\n\nPNR Generation for Various Types of Trains\n\nThe PNR number is generated for various types of Indian Railways trains. From the daily express trains to regular passenger trains, each train can be categorised based on their halts, average speed and other relevant factors.\n\nPassenger Trains: Passenger trains generally run between short distanced cities. There are slow as well as fast passenger trains run by the Indian Railways. Since there is no train ticket reservation facility for these trains, no PNR number is generated here.\n\nExpress and Super-fast Express Trains: These trains operate across longer distanced routes in India. The tickets can be reserved here, thus a unique PNR number is generated for each ticket that helps in identifying the traveller.\n\nMetro Trains: Metro trains are the trains that are fully equipped with all facilities and technologies that have started operations in several metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. The metro train tickets cannot be reserved, and thus no PNR number generation is processed here.\n\nSuburban Local Trains: There are fast local trains that halt only at important stations and slower suburban trains that stop at every station on the route. Seat reservation is not possible here, thus no PNR generation is also applied on suburban trains.\n\nShatabdi and Janshatabdi Express Trains: These high-speed trains run between moderately distanced important stations. Both trains do not have sleeper coaches. One of the major differences between the Shatabdi and Janshatabdi trains is that Janshatabdi trains contain both AC and non-AC coaches, whereas Shatabdi trains are fully air-conditioned. You can check the PNR of these train tickets as the tickets can be reserved here.\n\nRajdhani Express Trains: These fully air-conditioned trains are fast trains with less number of stops, and they run between major cities in India. The train tickets can be reserved, and the PNR status can be checked too.\n\nGarib Rath Trains: These trains have AC 3 Tier coaches and the tickets can be reserved. Live PNR status can be checked for Garib Rath trains.\n\nDuronto Express Trains: These trains run from source to destination with no halt in between. The tickets can be reserved, and the PNR status can be tracked too.\n\nUseful Links: IRCTC Ticket Booking | IRCTC PNR Status | Train Running Status | Seat Availability | Railway Enquiry"
