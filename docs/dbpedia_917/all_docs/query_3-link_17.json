You agree that you will only use the travel information facilities of this website to find out information for yourself or for another person who intends to use or make use of this website to purchase travel services.\n\nYou confirm that you have authority to use the credit/debit card details you provide for the purpose of settling any payments you owe to us.

The 'Jacobite' will occasionally operate a second trip during the same day. Your return ticket will only be valid for the same trip, i.e. if you have purchased a ticket for a departure time of 10:15 from Fort William the return trip will leave Mallaig at 14:10. For the avoidance of doubt, each ticket purchased for the 'Jacobite' trip clearly states your departure time and your return departure time on the ticket. For any queries regarding your departure times please contact the booking help line.\n\nBookings\n\nAll bookings are subject to the Terms and Conditions of West Coast Railways.\n\nYou are strongly advised to read these conditions, which contain limitations and exclusions relating to our liability in respect of loss caused by delays or cancellations, as well as loss or damage to any personal property you may bring with you on a booked trip.\n\nIf you cannot produce a valid ticket for the class of accommodation and service that you are using, you will have to pay the appropriate fare.\n\nPlease note that child fares are for 16 years or under and any child can only travel with a paying adult.\n\nIssue of Tickets\n\nWith respect to tickets sold by us, we cannot confirm the price of any tickets until such time as you complete your order and your credit/debit card will not be charged until the order has been processed.\n\nTickets including seat numbers and confirmed timings of your trip will be sent out to you 5-7 days in advance of your travel date. The Jacobite tickets will be sent out via email only around 5 days before your travel date.\n\nPromotions, Offers and Discount Codes\n\nAll offers are subject to availability, can be changed or withdrawn without notice and may be available for a limited time only. All our tours are subject to availability and discounts may be applied without notice, again based on availability. Offers are for new bookings only and cannot be combined with other offers unless specified.\n\nCancellations & Refunds\n\nWhilst every effort will be made to operate our services as advertised, West Coast Railways reserves the right to alter the service, which may include the timings, route taken and if required the use of a replacement locomotive. In the event of high fire risk or a steam locomotive failure a replacement diesel locomotive will be used, without notice and no refunds will be given in this instance, in accordance with our Terms and Conditions. In the unlikely event of a trip being cancelled by West Coast Railways, all monies paid to West Coast Railways for that journey will be refunded but no other liability shall be incurred. In the unlikely event of an engine failure or any event outside of our control resulting in a delay of our service, every effort will be made to complete the journey and return passengers to their agreed return station (as detailed on your booking confirmation), then West Coast Railways will only accept any previously agreed costs in returning you to the said return station and any additional costs to return you to any other point will not be accepted or other liability shall be incurred. Please note : The return ticket price is for outward and return journeys made on the same service. Only West Coast Railways tickets are valid on our services.\n\nAny refunds or replacement tickets offered will depend on the type of ticket and conditions applicable to it and will be to the maximum value of the individual ticket purchased.\n\nIf any trip cannot run for whatever reason, every effort will be made to advise passengers prior and a notice will be posted on the website, time allowing. Passengers who have already booked and paid for tickets in advance will receive a full refund or offered alternative trips within one month of cancellation. Any refunds will be made using the method of payment used at the time of booking. Compensation claims for non running trains will not be paid.\n\nMissed Trains & Refunds\n\nUnfortunately we cannot offer refunds for passengers who miss any of our trips or tours due to delayed connections or their own travel issues. In the case of the Jacobite therefore it may be advisable to either ride the afternoon train or plan an overnight stay prior to your Jacobite Trip. You may be able to claim via your travel insurance for missed connections.\n\nAmendments\n\nOnce a booking has been made a £15 administration fee will be applied when an amendment is requested and subsequently made.
