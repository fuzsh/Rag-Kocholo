        "text": "It is a record in the Indian Railways database that stores the journey details for a passenger or a group of passengers. The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) also keeps track of information such as passengers' current PNR status, availability of berths in all classes for the next 60 days, and static inquiries such as Train Between Important Stations, Reservations Rules, Fares, Refund, and Rules, and so on\n\nThe PNR number is typically printed in the upper left corner of printed tickets. The E-Ticket is mentioned at the top in a separate cell. Passengers' personal information, such as name, age, gender, and so on, is saved in the database in conjunction with this reference number. It has columns for storing the booking status and the current status of the ticket.\n\nBecause every train has a limited number of seats, it is possible that you will not receive a confirmed reserved ticket. When there is any availability of reserved seats due to cancellation, the current status of such a waitlist (W/L) ticket changes. PNR live status gives all the details in real-time to help you make informed decisions while booking train tickets online.\n\nYou can now easily check PNR status in real time by using the Trainman online PNR live status system. Get an instant PNR status update for your train ticket booking online.\n\nEnter the 10-digit PNR number found on the top left corner of a train ticket and go to the \"PNR Status\" button. It will return your train ticket's accurate PNR status as well as waitlist prediction updates.\n\nTrainman keeps you informed about your PNR status prior to your train journey, allowing you to make an informed decision.\n\nDownload the Trainman App(available for both iOS and Android) to check PNR status on your mobile device and take advantage of other useful features and offers while booking train tickets online.\n\nBecause there are only a limited number of seats available on a train, it is not possible to provide a confirmed train ticket online for every booking. When tickets are available, the train ticket booking system displays CNF (Confirmed) and RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) status, and subsequent bookings display waitlisted status. Only if a CNF/RAC ticket is cancelled will waitlisted tickets be confirmed in order.\n\nTracking Indian Railway PNR status live is especially important if you have a waitlisted ticket. Other travel information such as coach number, berth number, and berth type are only provided if the booked ticket status is Confirmed (CNF). Trainman's predictability feature comes to your rescue by predicting the most accurate PNR status live results with 95% accuracy.\n\nWhen you book train tickets online, you may or may not receive a confirmed ticket status. You may also receive a wait list or RAC ticket. Aside from checking the train PNR status on a regular basis, a new feature called trainman's PNR prediction informs you of the likelihood of ticket confirmation. It has been found to be 95 percent accurate the majority of the time, and it is supported by data analysis. Using this feature on the Trainman website and the Android app, you can estimate whether or not your wait list or RAC ticket will be confirmed.\n\nTrainman PNR prediction will assist you in predicting your chances of receiving confirmed tickets. Predictions are made using data analytics and machine learning techniques and are based on a variety of factors such as previous booking and cancellation trends, station quotas, days of the week, seasonality, holidays, and so on.\n\nGenerally, waiting list PNR Status has very few chances of being confirmed during peak seasons such as Durga puja (Dussehra), Diwali, Chhath, Holi, and so on. This is due to the high number of commuters who travel to their hometowns. Even during the busiest months, flight and bus ticket prices skyrocket.\n\nTrainman PNR live status allows you to check your PNR's current status as well as the likelihood of having your PNR status confirmed.\n\nEvery PNR Number contains a wealth of information about the journey and the passenger. Because each ticket contains its own information, each PNR number is distinct. PNR Number information includes ticket booking status (confirmed/waiting list/canceled), departure and arrival time, train details, seat number, fare paid by the passenger for the seat, payment method, and so on.\n\nWhen you book a train ticket online through the Trainman ticket booking website, you are given a 10-digit PNR Number.\n\nFor Tickets booked via NGET or PRS reservation counters: PNR is printed on the upper left-hand side of the ticket. This 10-digit number is used to check PNR status.\n\nFor E-Tickets: When you reserve your railway ticket through Trainman's official website, then the PNR number allocated is sent through SMS on the registered mobile number and e-mail ID provided at the time of ticket reservation process. When you print your ticket, then the PNR is printed on the upper left-hand side in a specific column just above the transaction ID.\n\nNote- You can easily check your PNR Live Status online to know your ticket confirmation details.\n\nBook your train ticket online with us, and you'd be provided with your PNR number along with complete train details.\n\nEvery PNR number, as previously stated, has ten digits. The first three digits of a PNR number represent the Passenger Reservation System, or PRS, from which the passenger's ticket was issued. The first digit represents the Railway Zone from which the train departs. The remaining seven digits are generated at random to make your PNR number unique.\n\nA fun fact- Indian Railways issue the most PNR numbers in a single day in the world. It issued over 200 million tickets in 2015, making it the world's largest train ticket issuing organization.\n\nZones from which PNR is issued-\n\nThere are several zones of the Indian Railways from which the PNR is issued.\n\nNR: Northern Railways\n\nNER: North Eastern Railways\n\nNFR: Northeast Frontier Railways\n\nER: Eastern Railways\n\nSER: South Eastern Railways\n\nSCR: South Central Railways\n\nSR: Southern Railways\n\nCR: Central Railways\n\nWR: Western Railways\n\nSWR: South Western Railways\n\nNWR: North Western Railways\n\nWCR: West Central Railways\n\nNCR: North Central Railways\n\nSECR: South East Central Railways\n\nECoR: East Coast Railways\n\nECR: East Central Railways\n\nTrain charting is typically completed four hours before the train's scheduled departure. When a passenger purchases a train ticket, the PNR number, as well as the ticket's status, is recorded in the database. This number is saved and used to prepare a chart for the trip's departure date. The total PNRs for a specific train are grouped, and a chart for the coaches is created. This chart includes a list of passengers as well as their contact information. The waitlist and RAC tickets are not included in the list.\n\nIf a passenger has booked an e-ticket from IRCTC website and forgets to take the e-ticket print out but remembers the PNR number then there is no problem provided the passenger has a valid id proof. online ticket booking sms is also allowed in place of ticket print out. On missing both print out and sms, a penalty of Rs.50 per ticket can be levied by TTE. However for counter tickets passenger needs to carry both original ticket and a valid id proof. If one has lost the ticket but remembers PNR number, a duplicate ticket can be requested from railway reservation counters."
