They can be listed on timetables, departure boards, station information services and used on the online journey planners.\n\nThe rules are as follows\n\n1) The code must be from a National Rail station in Great Britain.\n\n3) The code has to be the proper station one as listed by National Rail Enquiries.\n\nI have posted the above extract of the quiz rules as a help to new contestants.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nEbbw Vale Parkway\n\nFEL"
