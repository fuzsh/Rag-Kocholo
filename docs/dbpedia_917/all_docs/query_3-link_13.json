        "text": "PNR\n\nEver wondered how the 10-digit PNR number is generated? Or what do the digits indicate? The Indian Railways passenger name record, also known as PNR, is a number that gives a variety of travel information to ticket-holders. The PNR status includes information such as the booking status - whether the ticket has been confirmed, it is on waiting list (WL) or it is under reservation against cancellation (RAC) - apart from giving basic information on arrival and departure time of trains. The PNR status has details of the coach and seat number and the fare paid by the passenger, among other details. NDTV Rail Beeps search will help you find out the accurate PNR status of your train journey with the Indian Railways.\n\nHow To Check PNR Status?\n\nChecking your PNR status is easy. All you need to do is to enter your PNR number on the search bar above. It will then show you the PNR status of your ticket. Although you will see the PNR number on the top-left corner of the train ticket, the PNR number on the e-ticket appears in a different place - it will be printed on the top half of the page.\n\nHow PNR Works?\n\nThe Centre of Railway Information Systems or CRIS runs a database where all information about passengers are fed and stored. The system creates a 10-digit PNR status number every time a person buys an Indian Railways ticket on the IRCTC website, private travel websites or at ticket counters. IRCTC refers to Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation.\n\nIn terms of group bookings, a single PNR number can include a maximum of six passengers.\n\nWhat does PNR number include:\n\nPassenger Details (Name, Age, Sex, Birth Preference)\n\nTicket Details (Train No, Date, From, To, Boarding Station, Reservation Upto, Class, Berth, Quota)\n\nTransaction / Payment Details (Transaction ID, Payment Mode, Ticket Charge)\n\nThe first 3 digits of the PNR tell us from which Passenger Reservation System or PRS the ticket has been booked.\n\nThe PNR numbers' starting digit depends on Zone of the Train, w.r.t. starting station of the train.\n\nNumber Code Zone\n\n1 SCR Secunderabad PRS\n\n2, 3 NR, NCR, NWR, NER New Delhi PRS\n\n4, 5 SR, SWR, SCR Chennai PRS\n\n6, 7 NFR, ECR, ER, ECoR, SER, SECR Calcutta PRS\n\n8, 9 CR, WCR, WR Mumbai PRS\n\nThe last seven digits are randomly generated numbers using the Rand() function. These numbers represent no information about the ticket or journey as such. They only provide an unique identity to the PNR number.\n\nYou can check PNR Status number at https://www.ndtv.com/indian-railway\n\nAll you need to do is enter the PNR below to get the current status. You will find it on the top left corner of the ticket.) PNR status can also be checked at every major stations, where PNR stats checking counters are available.\n\nPNR number on ticket\n\nPNR number is usually printed at the top left corner of the tickets that are available at the railway station booking window. In case of the E - Ticket, the PNR number is mentioned at top in a separate cell.\n\nImportance of PNR status\n\nIt is quite common to find your train ticket on waiting list while booking tickets on Indian Railways. To check whether your ticket is confirmed, you need to check your current PNR status. You can easily do this online at https://www.ndtv.com/indian-railway/.\n\nHow to enquire PNR status\n\nOpen https://www.ndtv.com/indian-railway\n\nEnter your PNR number\n\nClick CHECK STATUS\n\nOther ways to enquire PNR status are:\n\n1. Current reservation status check using SMS\n\n2. Mobile applications\n\n3. Railway enquiry counters at railway station\n\n4. Final reservation charts\n\n5. Other websites\n\nPNR status and railway reservations explained step by step :\n\nWaiting List and RAC\n\nOnce all available seats on a train are sold, the Indian railway releases RACs for railway reservations. When all of the RAC seats are sold, Waiting List tickets are released. The status of the tickets might vary based on a variety of reasons. Ticket cancellations by other passengers can increase your chances if you have an RAC or Waiting List ticket. RAC/WL ticket holders are also likely to get available seats in different quotas if they remain unused.\n\nTickets are sold by the Indian Railways in the following order:\n\nAvailable 02\n\nAvailable 01\n\nRAC 01\n\nRAC 02\n\nRAC 03\n\nRAC 04\n\nWL 01\n\nWL 02\n\nUnderstanding your ticket status\n\nThere are two numbers mentioned on your ticket. The numbers detail the position at which you joined the waitlist and the current position of your ticket- in this order. Here is an example:\n\nWhen you book a train ticket online, you find the train number and class – AC, second class, third class etc mentioned on the e-ticket along with the seat/berth that you want along with the date and time. Let’s consider that you buy a ticket with WL5/WL2.\n\nThis means that you joined the WL at position 5, but by the time you paid for the ticket and actually bought the ticket online you moved to position 2. The position may have varied from WL5 to WL2 either due to a cancellation or due to someone not making a final booking. While\n\nthe first number (WL5 in this case) will stay the same, the second number will decrease until you get a ticket (hopefully).\n\nThis is how the status of your reservation status could look like – in that order:\n\nWL 5/WL 2\n\nWL 5/WL 1\n\nWL 5/RAC 3\n\nWL 5/RAC 2\n\nWL 5/RAC 1\n\nWL 5/CNF\n\nPNR status and seat availability\n\nThe following breakout explains how a ticket status plays a pivotal role in train journeys\n\nRAC - In RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation), the passenger is allowed to travel and two passengers share the same berth. If a confirmed passenger does not board the train, a full berth is allotted to the passenger with RAC ticket.\n\nCNF - The passenger seat has been confirmed and the seat will be allotted after charting\n\nCAN - The passenger seat has been cancelled\n\nWL - The passenger with Waitlist ticket is in the waiting list and is not allowed to board the train. A waitlist ticket can be cancelled by the passenger 30 minutes before the departure of the train. If a WL ticket does not get confirmed, it gets cancelled automatically.\n\nGNWL - A General Waitlist ticket which gets confirmed after the passengers cancel their confirmed bookings.\n\nTQWL - TQWL stands for Tatkal Waitlist. When a passenger does a tatkal booking and is put on the wait list, the status is shown as TQWL. This ticket is least likely to get confirmed.\n\nPQWL - Under Pooled Quota Waitlist, passengers traveling between intermediate stations and have a separate waitlist from the general waitlist.\n\nRLWL - A Remote Location Waitlist has the high chances of confirmation. Smaller stations have separate quota of seats and waiting seats on these intermediate stations are given RLWL status.\n\nRSWL - A station specific waitlist is called a Road-Side Waitlist.\n\nNR - NR means ‘No Room’ and no further bookings are allowed with a NR ticket\n\nNOSB - NOSB is acronym for No Seat Berth. Children below 12 years of age pay child fare and are not allotted seats. Their PNR status shows NOSB – No Seat Berth.\n\nREL - REL stands for Released\n\nWEBCAN - It’s a Railway Counter Ticket. When a passenger has been cancelled over internet and the refund has not been collected.\n\nWEBCANRF - It’s a Railway Counter Ticket. When a passenger has been cancelled over internet and the refund has been collected.\n\nWL and RAC refunds\n\nIf your train is ready for departure and its reservation chart is finalized, the cost of your WL ticket will be automatically refunded to your bank account.\n\nTill when are PNR numbers valid?\n\nNormally, the digits of Passanger name record or PNR become meaningless after the completion of the journey. The PNR details may not be available to the public once the journey gets completed for privacy and security concerns of passengers.\n\nHowever, PNR number lasts minimum 9 month. This is because the TDR filed can take maximum of 9 months. Its is then removed from the database.\n\nRailway Enquiries through Web:\n\nTicket Booking – www.irctc.co.in – Official Partner of Indian Railway for Online ticket booking.\n\nRailway Enquiry – www.indianrail.gov.in – Official Indian Railway portal\n\nPNR Status - Check Here PNR Status at NDTV Rail Beeps by Entering 10 Digit PNR Number\n\nLive Train Status - Check Here Live Train Status at NDTV Rail Beeps\n\nTrain Between Stations - Check Here Train Between Stations at NDTV Rail Beeps\n\nRailway Enquiries through SMS/Phone:\n\nSMS Service – How to check PNR status through SMS\n\nSMS PNR send to 139\n\nRailway Enquiry Number\n\nCall 139\n\nMobile App:\n\nNDTV's Rail Beeps mobile app is your single stop for all information on trains.
