        "text": "Good evening, everyone!\n\nJust though I'd start a thread so people don't have to explain abbreviations of rail terms to people who don't know them and thus make everyone's lives simple! You can put out any abbreviations from rail infrastructure to station (any welcome).\n\nI'll start with current TOCs (National Rail):\n\nTOC- Train Operating Company\n\nAA- Abellio Greater Anglia\n\nSR- Abellio ScotRail\n\nAW- Arriva Trains Wales\n\nCC- c2c\n\nXC- CrossCountry\n\nEM- East Midlands Trains\n\nES- Eurostar\n\nHT- Hull Trains\n\nTP- TransPennine Express\n\nGC- Grand Central\n\nGW- Great Western Railway\n\nHC- Heathrow Connect\n\nHX- Heathrow Express\n\nLM- London Midland\n\nLO- London Overground\n\nME- Merseyrail\n\nNT- Northern\n\nSE- Southeastern\n\nSN- Southern\n\nTL- Thameslink\n\nGN- Great Northern\n\nSW- South West Trains\n\nXR- Tfl Rail (Crossrail)\n\nVT- Virgin Trains West Coast\n\nGR- Virgin Trains East Coast\n\nATOC- Association of Train Operating Companies\n\nAny contributions/corrections welcome. If you have your own personal abbreviations that you use commonly for rail terms, please post here to make everything easy for everybody!\n\n(PS, my source for the above was Wikipedia so some may be incorrect...)\n\nwww.railforums.co.uk/showthread.php?=129235\n\nThats the link, however no one really has time to go to that thread every time someone uses and abbreviation so its always best to state it in full before using them\n\nWe don't maintain such a thread as we don't have the manpower to do so.\n\nAre you volunteering to maintain it OP?\n\nNo problem sir\n\nI meant it as more of a generic thread bringing all railway abbreviations to one melting pot. Also, if people have their own personal abbreviations that they wish to use more often but no one understands it, they can post the meaning here.\n\nI meant it as more of a generic thread bringing all railway abbreviations to one melting pot. Also, if people have their own personal abbreviations that they wish to use more often but no one understands it, they can post the meaning here.\n\nSo we can have multiple meanings for certain acronyms?\n\nIt's easier if people just explain what they mean rather than using their own personal jargon.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nYou should add :\n\nLT- London Underground\n\nWR- West Coast Railway Company\n\nSurely West Coast Railway Company is better represented by WCRC (or WCR), as used by most people?\n\nWe don't maintain such a thread as we don't have the manpower to do so.\n\nAre you volunteering to maintain it OP?\n\nI can't speak for the OP, but my previous offer to compile and maintain such a list (with input form other users) still stands. (My current list stretches to ~200 acronyms and explanations.)\n\nNo problem sir\n\nI meant it as more of a generic thread bringing all railway abbreviations to one melting pot. Also, if people have their own personal abbreviations that they wish to use more often but no one understands it, they can post the meaning here.\n\nGreat idea!\n\nIf then the thread could be made a 'sticky' for quick reference, even better.\n\nSo we can have multiple meanings for certain acronyms?\n\nIt's easier if people just explain what they mean rather than using their own personal jargon.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nSurely West Coast Railway Company is better represented by WCRC (or WCR), as used by most people?\n\nPerhaps, but WR is the 2 character code for them, just as TfL Rail's is XR, and VTEC's is GR\n\nWhat amuses me is that article writers use the discipline of explaining an acronym in brackets (typically in Modern Railways) and then no longer use it in the article. It makes the effort seem a waste of text. Just don't use the acronym after reviewing one's text.\n\nNote to OP -you forgot NR, the most important of all.\n\nSo is the idea that when someone uses an acronym in a thread, we have to come here, browse through multiple pages until we find the matching acronym, and in the case of multiple matches, guess which one they meant (BNS - is that Birmingham New Street or Barnes, NR - Northern Rail or Network Rail)?\n\nAnd this is supposed to be easier than the poster just stating what they mean in the first place?\n\nWhat amuses me is that article writers use the discipline of explaining an acronym in brackets (typically in Modern Railways) and then no longer use it in the article. It makes the effort seem a waste of text. Just don't use the acronym after reviewing one's text.\n\nOr the opposite, where a load of acronyms are used with no explanation.\n\nThere's a piece on the Class 92 modifications in Today's Railways that lists what has been done to them, but has no explanation of the acronyms used. They are not common ones either, being technical and/or specific to Class 92. In my view, that is a pretty appalling piece of journalism either for not including them or for not asking the question of Brush or GBRf as to what they are.\n\nSo is the idea that when someone uses an acronym in a thread, we have to come here, browse through multiple pages until we find the matching acronym, and in the case of multiple matches, guess which one they meant (BNS - is that Birmingham New Street or Barnes, NR - Northern Rail or Network Rail)?\n\nAnd this is supposed to be easier than the poster just stating what they mean in the first place?\n\nI know this is contradictory to my first post, but who uses NR for Northern? Obviously, people will make differences.\n\nI was thinking this thread could be stuck for references sake.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nForgot a TOC:\n\nGX- Gatwick Express\n\nA few random ones which came to mind:\n\nTVM- Ticket Vending Machine\n\nMOM- Mobile Operations Manager\n\nDfT- Department for Transport\n\nROSCO- Rolling Stock Operating Company\n\nHST- High Speed Train\n\nRPI- Revenue Protection Inspector\n\nPF- Penalty Fare\n\nNote to OP -you forgot NR, the most important of all.\n\nOk, thanks for the contributions!\n\nMultiple meanings are unavoidable. S&C , for example, can mean Switch and Crossing or Settle and Carlisle.\n\nThats exactly my point.\n\nRather than a list you have to trawl through, including possible multiple meanings, the person using the acronym could just type it out the first time, making life simpler for everyone for minimal effort.\n\nI know this is contradictory to my first post, but who uses NR for Northern? Obviously, people will make differences.\n\nHow about National Rail then? That's regularly used even on this site.\n\nNo idea. Their code is NT.\n\nWell Abellio Greater Anglia's code is LE and I don't see many people using that instead of the company's initials, not even in the OP, and I'm yet to see anyone using XR."
