They are performed once every 10 years. Please note: census information may include figures for adjacent streets and postcodes. The figures are therefore representative of the local area, not a specific street address or row of houses. The census collection is designed so that each group of postcodes should contain at least 50 people in Scotland. This is done to preserve the anonymity of the people in that area, as some postcodes cover a very small area, sometimes a single building. You can see the area covered by the census statistics by clicking \"Show Census Area Covered\" below the map above.\n\nUsing this Information Commercially\n\nThe information we provide on the website is done so without charge. However, if you wish to use this data on other websites, or in any other public medium should consult our data sources page for information on how you should correctly attribute the information.\n\nSocial Grade\n\nSocial Grade approximations are derived from an algorithm created by the Market Research Society. The figures shown are per-household rather than individual - more specifically, the job title and employer of the \"household reference person\" is used, analogous to what traditionally was called the head of the household. Only household reference persons between the ages of 16-64 are included.\n\nSocial Grade AB - Higher and intermediate managerial, administrative, or professional positions 13 C1 - Supervisory, clerical, and junior managerial/administrative/professional positions 14 C2 - Skilled manual workers 9 DE - Semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers; those on state benefit/unemployed, & lowest grade workers 18\n\nTotal 54\n\nGender Back to Top\n\nAcross the UK as a whole, the gender split is roughly equal at 49% male, 51% female.
