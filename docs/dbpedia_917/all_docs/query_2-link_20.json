To the south the two lines of the railway merge at a reversing spur. Although the Caledonian Railway style station buildings were demolished in the late 1980s the goods shed survives. The larger building with ticket office was on the Glasgow bound platform with a smaller building on the southbound platform.\n\nIt is a terminus but was formerly on the main line south west to Ardrossan Montgomerie Pier and Irvine Bank Street. The reversing spur is the stump of that route.\n\nThe goods yard was reached from the south end and was located on the north side of the station. It was reached by a reversing spur with a loop at the south end, north side. The shed survives and the yard is a car park. The signal box was at the west end of the Glasgow bound platform.\n\nThe station was renamed to distinguish it from Neilston Low station on the Glasgow and Kilmarnock Joint Railway. This was in 1924, one year after both stations came into the ownership of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The High station was close to the village and the Low station was convenient for the mills.\n\nIn 1932 local trains south of Uplawmoor [1st] (the next station from Glasgow) ceased.\n\nThe signal boxes at Patterton and Whitecraigs closed in 1961, the section taken over jointly by the boxes at Neilston High and Muirend.\n\nThe local service to Uplawmoor [1st] continued until 1962. Also in 1962 the station became Neilston again.\n\nIn 1964 the line south was closed. The signal box survived until 1982.\n\nTags\n\nStation terminus goods shed"
