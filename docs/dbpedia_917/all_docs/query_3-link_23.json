The P2P sector has two distinct types of services which are distinguished by the way drivers are matched to commuters. The first is street-hail, where commuters flag down an available taxi from the street. The second is ride-hail, where commuters can 'book' a taxi or PHC through smartphone apps, call booking hotlines, or even through online platforms. With the growth of ride-hail services, commuters now have more P2P transport options, while drivers also have more choices on the operators they can drive for.
