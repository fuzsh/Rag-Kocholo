We will provide the current 10 digit PNR status check for railway tickets along with passenger and train details – Your reservation booking status, platform number, coach position, berth number, berth type and more.\n\nOn ixigo, you can also check PNR status in Hindi (पीएनआर स्टेटस पूछताछ).\n\nThe IRCTC train ticket booking system provides CNF (Confirmed) and RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) status when tickets are available, and the bookings made after that are provided waitlisted status. Waitlisted tickets get confirmed in order only if any of the CNF/RAC tickets gets cancelled. When you have a waitlisted ticket, tracking IRCTC PNR status live becomes necessary.\n\nKnow more in detail about how to check train PNR status online.\n\nPNR Confirmation Probability and Prediction\n\nPNR confirmation probability means the chances of getting a train ticket status confirmed if the current status is \"Not Available\". When all the confirmed and RAC tickets are sold out, the Indian Railway assigns a waitlisted ticket for further bookings made on the respective train and class. The confirmation probability of railway PNR status for these waitlisted tickets depends upon the cancellations of confirmed and RAC tickets only. It also relies on factors like weekends, seasons, festivals, and special events, among other factors. Once your ticket is confirmed, check train running status.\n\nYou can use the PNR prediction feature on the ixigo app, and check the chances of your waitlisted tickets getting confirmed. PNR prediction helps you in making a smart travel decision."
