        "text": "In March 1905, the railway branch of the Public Works Department was transferred to the newly established railway board under the department of commerce and industry by the Indian Railway Board Act.[1] In 1908, the set up was re-organized on the recommendations of the Railway Finance Committee (1908) by constituting the Railway Board headed by a president as a separate department.[2] Pursuant to the Acworth committee's recommendations in 1921, the railway board was expanded to four members with the addition of a financial commissioner in 1924 apart from the chief commissioner, one commissioners responsible for ways and works, projects and stores and the other responsible for general administration, staff and traffic.[2] In 1929, an additional member was added to the board and was assigned the responsibility for staff, so that the member in charge of traffic could focus solely on transport and commercial matters.[3] In 1950,the railway board was re-constituted to four members with the senior-most functional member appointed the chairman of the board with no absolute over riding power.[4][5] In October 1954, the chairman of the board was made responsible for decisions on technical and policy matters, with the status of a principal secretary to the Government of India with an additional member added.[5] The board was expanded with an additional member responsible for electrical engineering in 1972 and a further member responsible for health in 1976.[6] In 2004, the board is expanded by the introduction of two new members responsible for signalling & telecom and for stores respectively.[7] In December 2019, the Union Cabinet decided to reduce the size of the board from eight to five.[8] The chairman of the railway board reports to the Ministry of Railways and act on behalf of the ministry. The following report to the railway board:[9][10]\n\nGeneral managers of various zones\n\nHeads of functional divisions\n\nHeads/Managers of production units\n\nHeads of Public Sector Undertakings\n\nHeads of railway institutes\n\nHeads of special divisions\n\nIn 1944, all the railway companies in existence at the time were taken over by the Government.[12] In December 1950, the Central Advisory Committee for Railways approved the plan for re-organizing Indian Railways into six regional zones which were divided subsequently to create newer zones. As of 2024, there are 17 operational zones of Indian Railways.[13] The zones are headed by a General manager and are further sub-divided into divisions. Each division is headed by a Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), who are responsible for the operation and maintenance in the respective divisions.[14] The 17 operational zones and their divisions are listed below. South Coast Railway zone is proposed to be created as the eighteenth zone, but is not yet operational as of 2023.[15]\n\nIndian Railway zones Railway zone Code Headquarters[16] Established[17] Route length[a][18] Stations Divisions[19] km miles 7 Southern Railway SR Chennai 1951 5,093 3,164.6 727[20] Chennai, Madurai, Palakkad, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchirappalli 8 Central Railway CR Mumbai CSMT 1951 4,203.3 2,611.8 486[21] Bhusawal, Mumbai CR, Nagpur, Pune, Solapur 9 Western Railway WR Mumbai Churchgate 1951 6,156.6 3,825.5 1046[22] Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Mumbai WR, Rajkot, Ratlam, Vadodara 4 Eastern Railway ER Kolkata 1952 2,823.2 1,754.3 587[23] Asansol, Howrah, Malda, Sealdah 1 Northern Railway NR Delhi 1952 7,363 4,575.2 1013[24] Ambala, Delhi, Firozpur, Lucknow, Moradabad 2 North Eastern Railway NER Gorakhpur 1952 3,470.5 2,156.5 537[25] Izzatnagar, Lucknow, Varanasi 5 South Eastern Railway SER Kolkata 1955 2,758.6 1,714.1 363[26] Adra, Chakradharpur, Kharagpur, Ranchi 3 Northeast Frontier Railway NFR Guwahati 1958 4,348 2,701.7 547[27] Alipurduar, Katihar, Lumding, Rangiya, Tinsukia 6 South Central Railway SCR Secunderabad 1966 6,560.5 4,076.5 156[28] Guntur, Guntakal, Hyderabad, Nanded, Secunderabad, Vijayawada NA Kolkata Metro KM Kolkata 1984 59.8 37.2 40[29] 14 South East Central Railway SECR Bilaspur 1988 2,396.6 1,489.2 358[30] Bilaspur, Nagpur, Raipur 16 East Central Railway ECR Hajipur 1996 4,238 2,633.4 340[31] Danapur, Dhanbad, Mughalsarai, Samastipur, Sonpur 11 North Western Railway NWR Jaipur 2002 5,705.6 3,545.3 578[32] Ajmer, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur 15 East Coast Railway ECoR Bhubaneswar 2003 3,017.2 1,874.8 133[33] Khurda Road, Sambalpur, Waltair 13 North Central Railway NCR Prayagraj 2003 3,522.6 2,188.8 411[34] Agra, Jhansi, Prayagraj 10 South Western Railway SWR Hubballi 2003 3,661.8 2,275.3 381[35] Bengaluru, Hubballi, Mysuru 12 West Central Railway WCR Jabalpur 2003 3,060 1,901.4 247[36] Bhopal, Jabalpur, Kota\n\n^ as of March 2023\n\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Groups A and B) and non-gazetted (Groups C and D) employees with gazetted employees carrying out executive/managerial level tasks.[38] As of March 2022, Groups A & B constitute 1.5% of the total workforce, while Group C & D account for 98.5%.[16] 80% of Group-A employees are recruited through Indian Railways Management Service (IRMS) with remaining through promotions.[39] The various Group A cadres are as below include:[40]\n\nCentral Civil Services recruitment through Civil Services Examination (CSE)\n\nIndian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS)\n\nIndian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS)\n\nIndian Railway Accounts Service (IRAS)\n\nIndian Railway Protection Force Service (IRPFS)\n\nCentral Engineering Services recruitment through Engineering Services Examination (ESE)\n\nIndian Railway Service of Engineers (IRSE)\n\nIndian Railway Service of Electrical Engineers (IRSEE)\n\nIndian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers (IRSME)\n\nIndian Railway Service of Signal Engineers (IRSSE)\n\nIndian Railway Stores Service (IRSS)\n\nCentral Health Science Services recruitment through Combined Medical Services Examination (CMSE)\n\nIndian railway medical service (IRMS)\n\nGroup B employees are recruited by departmental promotional exams of Group C employees.
