        "text": "A residential development of about 250 new homes off Cowpits Road was given the go-ahead five years ago and homes are being built to the north-east of the village, while there are also plans for a replacement primary school.\n\nNow, Bellway Homes Ltd is eyeing up a development to the south of the village and beside the current primary school.\n\nEarly proposals are with East Lothian Council but give no indication of how many homes could be built.\n\nCouncillors in the Musselburgh ward and neighbouring Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry ward have been made aware of the proposals.\n\nThe developers have also been in contact with both Whitecraig and Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Councils, as well as East Lothian’s MP Kenny MacAskill and Musselburgh MSP Colin Beattie.\n\nThe 15.2-hectare agricultural site was highlighted by the local authority in the Local Development Plan in 2018.\n\nAt that time, the council described the site, which is “physically suitable for the proposed use”, as: “A greenfield site in agricultural use on gradually rising ground to the south of Whitecraig.\n\n“It is bounded to the south by Smeaton Farm, to the east by the path running along the former railway line, and to the west by the A6094.”\n\nDuring the assessment, it was noted that the development of the site “would result in some loss of prime agricultural land”.\n\nTwo public consultation events are planned to take place at Whitecraig Village Hub.\n\nThe first is planned for January 25 with a second event on February 21; both take place from 2pm to 7pm."
