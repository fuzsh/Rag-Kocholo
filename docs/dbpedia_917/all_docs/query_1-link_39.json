        "text": "Waterline, stylised in all lowercase, operates rail services to various districts around Stepford County, such as Newry Harbour, Newry, Benton, Connolly, Farleigh, Esterfield, Morganstown, Airport Terminal 2 and Greenslade. A full journey on the main line, which runs from Newry to Benton, takes about 6 minutes.\n\nThe operator is classified as a regional commuter rail due to its short travel times and the stations it serves. Several trains on this route can go as fast as 100 MPH, that can be reached between Newry and Eden Quay (only southbound services) and on sections between Airport West and Esterfield, while the average operational speed is 90 MPH.\n\nPrior to 1 May 2020, this operator was a sub-franchise of Connect, branded as WaterLine and bearing a navy blue (#002D5F) colour scheme. Currently, it operates as its own separate franchise and bears a colour scheme of both blue grey (#34495E) and greyish blue (#7F8FA6) , primarily using the Raleway font.\n\nHistory[]\n\n2017[]\n\nOctober 2017: Plans were announced to open a new route as part of Connect, following the mainline from Benton to Port Benton and continuing onto a new branch. Services commenced on 4 December, exclusively using Class 165 and Class 166 units and Morganstown Docks was constructed shortly after.\n\n20th December: Services to Newry and Newry Harbour commenced and ex-Connect Class 387 units were introduced.\n\n2018[]\n\n21st April: Version 1.0 released, with Class 171, Class 319 and Class 701 units being introduced and services to Connolly commenced.\n\n4th August: the Class 323 was announced on Discord with \"coming soon\" in the announcement, however the train has never been released.\n\n18th August: One Million Update released, Class 730 units were introduced.\n\nDecember 2018: Plans for the future of the route were revealed, including the refurbishment of all Class 165, Class 166 and Class 387 units, the commencement of services to James Street and the overhaul of Faraday Road station.\n\n31st December: The changes mentioned above took effect, including the silent removal of all Class 701 units from services.\n\n2019[]\n\n14th May: Version 1.3 released, with Class 508 units entering service, being the first with Next Generation doors and interiors on the route.\n\n8th June: All Class 387 units were transferred to AirLink, being replaced by Class 379 units also with Next Generation tech.\n\n31st August: All Class 171 units were upgraded with into Next Generation, similar to the recently introduced units.\n\n2020[]\n\n22nd February: Version 1.4.1 released, with all Class 319 units being upgraded to NGv1, and Class 195 units were introduced, already equipped with Next Generation doors and interiors. The platforms at Benton and West Benton received new decor.\n\n18th March: A fourth platform at Morganstown Docks station was constructed, but not put to use yet.\n\n1st May: Version 1.5 released, with the Connect franchise being renewed to no longer include the WaterLine route. All Class 165, Class 166, and Class 730 units were upgraded with Next Generation V2 doors and interiors, and became the first trains to bear the new branding introduced with the franchise renewal. All Class 171, Class 195, and Class 379 units were also fitted with the new branding.\n\n2nd May: Plans were revealed to retrofit all Class 508 units with the new branding.\n\n22nd June: Plans were revealed for an extension to Morganstown via Morganstown Docks. Both of these changes went into effect that same day.\n\n29th October: Version 1.7 released, with the NGv3 upgrade for the Class 379 units being introduced.\n\n2021[]\n\n1st January: Whitney Green Depot and Greenslade were overhauled and the Class 379 received a new horn sound.\n\n22nd January: Managing Director Charlie_RBX posted a poll on the SCR Discord \"#voting\" channel, either for a (completely new) Stepford Connect extension between Leighton Stepford Road and Llyn-by-the-Sea,[note 1] or the James Street extension, both being a one-stop extension.\n\n4th July: Plans were revealed for the remodelling of the Class 171 units to the mesh models.\n\n7th July: Class 171 units are upgraded to mesh models.\n\n5th December: NGv3 Class 730 units are introduced, with an updated top speed of 90 MPH.

This is called 'Waterline flooding'.\n\nDriving Waterline is the best way to earn/grind points, as most of the stations are significantly close to each other, and there are a number of routes.\n\nMany players agreed that this operator was 'dead' due to major updates which seem to leave out Waterline, however this is changing recently, with more station overhauls and the anticipated Waterline Extension released.\n\nCurrently, Whitney Green is the only station to have no major change to it as of current.\n\nAs of V1.10.10, this was the last operator to have NGv2 trains, those being the Class 165 and Class 166. They were upgraded to NGv3 in V1.10.11.\n\nBefore V1.10, this was the only operator that did not skip any stations.\n\nNow, R014 skips James Street and Rosedale Village.\n\nIronically, R014 was the route that terminated at James Street before the extension was complete, now, it skips James Street.\n\nThis used to be the only operator where some trains could never hit their top speed at any point on the line without breaking the speed limits.\n\nThis was changed in V1.9, when speed limits between Newry and Eden Quay (southbound only) were increased to 100 MPH.\n\nLater in V1.10, speed limits between Airport West and Airport Terminal 2, as well as between Farleigh and Esterfield have been set to 100 MPH.\n\nThe only interchanges between Waterline and Stepford Express are Newry Harbour, Newry, Eden Quay, Benton and Morganstown.\n\nBefore V1.7, Benton used to be the only Stepford Express interchange.\n\nBefore V1.9, Benton and Morganstown used to be the only Waterline - Stepford Express interchanges.\n\nLikewise, the only Waterline and AirLink interchanges are at Morganstown and Airport Terminal 2.\n\nThis operator used to be part of Connect, but it is now a separate franchise.\n\nThis operator used to have the least amount of depots and sidings prior to V1.9 with only 4, tied with AirLink. After V1.9, it beat AirLink as Newry Siding was added.\n\nBefore V1.7, every Waterline route except R010 had only one spawn location.\n\nIn V1.7, Benton Siding opened and R010 became the only route with 3 places to spawn.\n\nLater in V1.9, Newry Siding was added, making the aforementioned route the only route with 4 places to spawn.\n\nHowever in V1.10, Farleigh TMD and Esterfield TMD were added, making R014 the only route with 6 places to spawn. (if Esterfield TMD is split into the Station Depot and the Mainline Depot)\n\nThis operator, along with Stepford Connect, are the last operators to see their trains upgraded to Next Generation. This operator also had the most Previous Generation trains prior to V1.5.\n\nThis is the only operator that does not serve the Stepford City Zone or call at Stepford Central.\n\nNewry Harbour formerly did not have any trains going to James Street, as the developers wanted to keep the station as small as possible.\n\nNow, it is possible to travel between those two stations directly via R018 (Newry Harbour <> Farleigh) which has James Street as an intermediate stop.\n\nJames Street had no buffers before V1.6.\n\nBefore then, if a driver overshot the platform, their train would be despawned with the despawn message saying \"Invalid track detected.\", but this message is no longer able to be seen because of the buffer being added.\n\nThen-Innovations Director BanTech said on Discord that this was to prevent drivers from losing their experience for that route.\n\nPrior to V1.10, James Street had no ticket machines, barriers or CIS Boards, making it feel like a very incomplete station.\n\nBefore V1.6, R010 used every depot on Waterline, but because of the Morganstown Shuttle being added, a siding was added at Morganstown.\n\nThe Class 143 and Class 730 are the most common trains to be seen on Waterline because of their cheap price of 1,000 points.\n\nThe Class 195 was the first train on Waterline with coach variants, and the Class 165 was the first train on Waterline with a double configuration, and the second overall in SCR.\n\nThe Class 701 was removed because it did not suit the line.\n\nAs of V1.10, Waterline has the least amount of routes, with only 9 routes, with AirLink in second place having 10 routes.\n\nBefore V1.7, Stepford Express had the least amount of routes, having 5 routes. The aforementioned update brought the operator 3 new routes, passing both Waterline and AirLink in the number of routes at that time.\n\nWaterline is the only operator to use lettered platforms as of V1.10. Esterfield is only a Waterline station, having Platforms 4A and 4B (Platform 4A is permanently occupied by an out-of-service Class 143), while Platforms 5A and 5B at Morganstown are only for Waterline trains.\n\nNewry also had lettered platforms, but they were removed in V1.9 when the station was upgraded.\n\nThe first Waterline livery was based off the Great Western Railway livery.\n\nAlong with Stepford Connect, this is one of two operators with more than one double unit on them, with Waterline operating double units of both the Class 143 and the Class 165.\n\nThere used to be a bug which meant that players could not open the Waterline map at night, however this was fixed in V1.8.4.\n\nUntil the introduction of the Points system in V1.0, Waterline was locked behind a gamepass. Those who owned the gamepass during the legacy period were given the Classes 165, 166 and 387 as compensation after V1.0 released.[1]\n\nThe operator's old logo was set in the Johnston typeface which is used on Transport for London services including the London Underground and DLR.\n\nNotes[]"
