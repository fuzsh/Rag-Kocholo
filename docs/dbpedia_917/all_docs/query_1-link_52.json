        "text": "Well I finally got around to taking some more photos of Cudgee Sidings. It's been a while, and it's now almost done just waiting for a new set of points to get wired up after the old one broke. So here are some shots which could have been while operating but due to the unwired points I wasn't able to do it operational so was all pushed around.\n\nFirst some shots of the layout in it's current condition -\n\nA heavily weathered V/LINE VKOX. I need to run some paint thinner over this to get rid of the dark black look.\n\nSome bushes, a hut, and the end of a V/LINE GRAIN hopper\n\nA V/LINE FREIGHT grain hopper and West Coast Railway T369\n\nA better view of T369. This is one of my favourite liveries of all time, up there with BR Express Blue and LNER Apple/Doncaster Green\n\nCows, a dead tree, some bushes, and an overall view of one side of the layout\n\nAnd a more clear view, showing the train of 2x grain hoppers and the T class. Also shows the points set for the platform road.\n\nThe VKOX in more detail. The weathering needs fixing, but works for now. It has been fitted with a load of sticks from a Woodlands Scenics pack as I couldn't find any suitable sticks in the garden.\n\nThe bus, a Ford, a signalling hut and the end of the VKOX\n\nT369 and it's train viewed from the platform with a ruddy great light in the middle of the shot. Gilbert (Great Northern) from the Peterborough North thread knows what it's like getting these in shot!\n\nThe goods warehouse, toilet hut and the No.2 end of T369. Have just realised the rear wheel is off the rails :/\n\nThe car and bus in more detail, also shows how some bedding in and weathering of the signalling hut needs to be done.\n\nThe bus and bus-stop in more (albeit fuzzy) detail\n\nAn overall view of the layout\n\nAnd now time for some operations -\n\nT369 photographed from the road leaving the yard with it's train\n\nAnd from another angle\n\nTrain now gone, the bus starts up and leaves\n\nV/LINE Y127 now comes into the yard with a single AW 1st class coach as the 2nd class BWs seem to be in use somewhere else\n\nPassing the toilet and warehouse\n\nPassenger car now being shunted\n\nCoupled onto the VKOX full of lineside rubbish\n\nAnd now being pulled back into the platform for farmers to get off the train having spent a day in Warrnambool at the Annual Agriculture Expo\n\nThe farmers having disembarked, the train is pulled back so the Y class can get it fully into the loop road\n\nThe Y class, having had the points changed, has now pushed the train fully into the loop road\n\nAnd is now seen running around it's train\n\nAnd from another vantage point\n\nViewed leaving from the car-park\n\nAnd a blurry full-on shot of Y127\n\nA darker shot of it going over the level crossing\n\nAnd the \"off-stage\" \"fiddle yard\" where the locos and rolling stock goes. All the rolling stock currently used is seen here.\n\nPeter\n\nWell Cudgee is now all but finished. Track is wired up, point motors are wired up to a small control panel (simply 3mm MDF with push-buttons), and I've put in a new cassette/traverser fiddle yard.\n\nAll that's left is to make a more permanent control panel (i made it by breaking a small sheet of MDF off a larger one) and re-ballast a turnout which I replaced.\n\nNot sure if anyone's interested, but here's a link to the trackplan for the real Cudgee railway station (on the Warrnambool line here in Victoria) - http://victorianrailways.net/signaling/completedia/cudgee.html\n\nI'll put some pictures up when I've done the final ballasting and get a chance to put some stock on it. I also had the first \"running session\" which was just running a mates Y class over each section of track to make sure it works properly. So far I've only had a problem with 1 point motor which I am fairly certain is just due to my wiring of the push-buttons, so that will be re-wired when I get the chance.\n\nPeter\n\nWell, now that Cudgee Sidings is done it's time to move on to my next Australian model.\n\nOne of the Facebook groups that I'm in is currently planning a kind of modular layout (Like T-Track or N-Track), where there is a set of standards, and everyone brings module/s that they make to an event (group admin currently suggest two events per year, so some may make it to both events). The only rules as to track is that at each end of each persons module/set of modules, the track must be 200mm from the baseboard front, and Peco Code 83 track must be used at least for the mainline.\n\nI have decided to build two modules, to represent a small V/LINE station in the early 2000s. I will also have two fiddle-yards (one at each end) so it can be operated from home. I'm yet to decide on the backstory, however I have decided (and put into the track plan) that the station has retained it's sidings, and is still serviced by a daily freight service from Freight Australia (the then freight provider throughout Victoria and a large part of Eastern Australia. It was taken over by Pacific National in 2004), as well as a four-times daily (per direction) service from V/LINE Passenger.\n\nSo far I have only included two buildings. A Victorian Railways 30' goods shed which will be purchased from Blue and Gold Models (http://www.blueandgoldmodels.com/apps/webstore/) and a Victorian Railways station building, based off that at Nyora in South Gippsland, from Outback Models (http://www.outbackmodels.com/HO%20VR%20Kits/HO%20VR%20Kits.html). There will probably be a couple of smaller buildings, however I am yet to decide what to include. I may also change a couple of things in the track-plan to allow for expansion to 3 baseboards at a later date.\n\nPeter\n\nI have decided to name the planned layout Pomborneit North. Here is some of the station's (fictional) history.\n\nPomborneit North is a fictional station about 2 miles north of Pomborneit Station on the Warrnambool/Port Fairy line. Opened in 1921, the station was half a mile away from the Pomborneit Dairy, and was closer to the dairy than Pomborneit Station, which resulted in Pomborneit North being used as the loading and offloading point for cattle for the dairy and for the dairy products being sent into Melbourne and Warrnambool. The 5 road yard was rationalised in the mid 1980s to a 3 road yard, however the 30' goods shed was kept, and moved to a new location adjacent to No.3 road, and a new goods platform was built for transfer of goods. The dairy kept a small amount of M cattle wagons and T insulated vans, purchased when the VR stopped cattle and insulated transport in the 1980s. The stock was subsequently loaned out to freight companies for use on the Pomborneit Nth services, initially by V/Line, then V/Line Freight, before being used by Freight Victoria, currently Freight Australia (Freight Victoria was renamed to Freight Australia in 2000). The train of cattle wagons ran as required, and the insulated vans ran two services per day, one to Warrnambool and one to Melbourne. The West Coast Railway and V/Line passenger trains to Warrnambool and Melbourne stop at Pomborneit North, despite most other small stations being closed to traffic. Along with this, a twice-weekly \"mixed\" service runs, usually taking grain and other produce for the dairy to use.\n\nRolling stock which I will use on the layout -\n\nA, G, P, T, X and Y class diesel locomotives in Freight Australia/Victoria livery.\n\nA, N and P class diesel locomotives in V/Line Passenger (Mk1 and Mk2) livery.\n\nB, S and T class diesel locomotives in WCR livery.\n\nR class steam locomotives in WCR livery\n\nT and M vans in VR Wagon Red\n\nVLCX vans in Freight Australia green\n\nVHGF hoppers in V/Line Freight, V/Line Grain and Freight Australia liveries\n\nVZGX flour hoppers in Freight Australia and V/Line liveries\n\nVLCX container hoppers in Freight Australia livery.\n\nFor those who haven't noticed, I never started Pomborneit North. Mainly due to my wish to model a prototype location. I chose Skipton, and the thread for this layout is available here:\n\nhttp://www.rmweb.co.uk/community/index.php?/topic/120355-skipton-station-australia-first-trains-running/page-2#\n\nI have never been happy with Cudgee. I have had multiple issues with the wiring, derailments, dodgy track alignment, and various other design flaws. As such, a couple of days ago the decision was made that I would rip it up, and eventually rebuild it to a new design. This evening, I ripped up the track. The following is an extract from the Cudgee Herald, on the 24th of April 1959:\n\n\"The notice stating the closure of the Cudgee Sidings Railway Station was put out in this newspaper on the 20th of April 1959 (See \"Cudgee Railway to Close). The demolition of the station has been completed quickly, with Victorian Railways contractors having completed the demolition of the buildings by yesterday morning. The Australian Army was called in to undertake the removal of all trackwork, supervised by Brigadier Lethbridge-Steward, formerly of UNIT.\n\nLethbridge-Stewart had the following to say on the matter: \"My unit was called in to undertake the removal of the track at Cudgee Sidings Railway Station. I am pleased to say this task is now completed. This operation was completed with extreme prejudice and precision. The enemy side suffered extreme casualties, however no fatalities or injuries to report on our side.\"\n\nWe are also happy to report that we have been informed by the Victorian Railways that a new station will be constructed further north, closer to the centre of town. The new station will be named Cudgee North. The station will include better passenger and goods loading facilities than the previous Cudgee Sidings Station. Photographs shown include the plan for Cudgee North Station, as well as the removal of the track at the old Cudgee Sidings station.\n\nThe opening date for Cudgee North is estimated to be January 1 1960.\n\nThe replacement for Cudgee Sidings (Cudgee North) will be built on the same baseboard, and utilise Peco Code 75 track with small-radius turnouts. It will be firmly set in 1960. Buildings will be kit or scratchbuilt to VR designs (rather than the Hornby British buildings used on Cudgee Sidings) I am planning to do the construction work in December, after Skipton is complete.\n\nPeter"
