See post here: https://forums.auran.com/trainz/sho...ng-Kuids-Post-them-here&p=1922102#post1922102\n\nShould be all sorted now, ended up updating some deps and changing the bogeys to my kuid. All should be working now!\n\nOn another note, i have now released my CFCLA C44aci pack for anyone interested in downloading!\n\nhttps://hotboxcontent.weebly.com/cfcla-railfirst--freightliner-locomotives.html\n\nCheers, Ryan\n\nG'day,\n\nThose bogies and specs on the Russian site they took from me in victrainz private storage when they hacked into it, I built some of the Geelong engines and had been building some of the Hobson's bay stock too, I do have some old Geelong open wagons on the DLS, the VR t3a 1900+ are ex Geelong stock, the engines are still in TS12 and heven't been moved to T:ANE or TRS19 yet.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is a old render I have on Flickr.\n\nhttps://live.staticflickr.com/5648/21472699032_e4c938fd0c_b.jpg\n\nEDIT2:\n\nIf the bogies and specs are on it the engines should be too as they where in a packed .cdp, when I found out my stuff was on it I tried searching to find a contact us and find the hosting name to put in a request to have my stuff removed I couldn't find anything, the problem is they pretty much cancel out the update system N3V games have the on the DLS, so when I update something it goes on DLS as a V1 or V2 depending on how many times I update, the stuff on their site is under old kuids when they where a work in progress or in beta stage so people are not getting the true version to that asset.\n\nHere's one of the Hobson's Bay open wagons, these where on VR register from 1885, this model will represent 1890 to 1900.\n\nCheers."
