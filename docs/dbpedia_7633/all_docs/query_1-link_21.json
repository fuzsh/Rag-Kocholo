        "text": "Karl Lagerfeld is tapping French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld to work with his brand, WWD reported Thursday.\n\nThe creative director of Chanel (who was notably absent from his Chanel haute couture show in Paris earlier this month) will partner with Roitfeld on his eponymous brand, Karl Lagerfeld. Roitfeld previously collaborated with Lagerfeld on his successful Karl Lagerfeld for H&M line in 2004 that sold out in two hours.\n\nRoitfeld will curate a selection of Lagerfeldd’s fall 2019 line called “The Edit by Carine Roitfeld,” featuring her essentials and favorite pieces. “The collaboration will further evolve with additional projects to be announced later this year,” the Lagerfeld house told WWD. It will highlight “versatile styles with mix-and-match appeal,” debuting in the fall at Karl Lagerfeld stores and online.\n\n“[Roitfeld] knows what she wants; she has a vision and she states her vision,” Lagerfeld said in a statement to WWD. “She is actually what she seems to be; she matches her image, she fits in her universe, and she is a perfect match for KL.”\n\nIn turn, Roitfeld called Lagerfeld “one of the smartest, most inventive and innovative people I have ever known.” After working with Tom Ford, Roitfeld styled campaign shoots for brands from Chanel to Yves Saint Laurent, eventually running French Vogue for 10 years beginning in 2001.\n\nKnown for her pencil skirts, Roitfeld has previously partnered with Japanese brand Uniqlo for military-inspired apparel, slips and blazers. She is the founder and editor of CR Fashion Book, which led to additional volumes, CR Men’s Book and CR Girls in 2016."
