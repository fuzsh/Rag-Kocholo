        "text": "PARIS — Carine Roitfeld, the eyeliner-slicked archetype of a fashion editor, muse to (and collaborator of) Tom Ford and Karl Lagerfeld, is propped up on an Hermès pillow (she is recovering from a back injury) and explaining how she came to make a collection for Uniqlo, the Japanese fast-fashion retailer.\n\n“They said they want to do my allure in Uniqlo,” she said. “My wardrobe, exactly the way I’m dressing.”\n\nThe way she was dressing was just as she always dresses: “bourgeoise with a little rock ’n’ roll twist,” in her words. She is a proponent of leather, leopard, tight sweaters and teetering heels, which she has translated into a collection that arrives in Uniqlo stores and online Oct. 29. She was dressed for the afternoon in a grommeted black sweater and faux leather skirt from the collection.\n\n“It’s the first time everything is perfectly fitted on me in real life,” she said. “It’s like couture for me.” Except that it starts at $12.90 for a pair of tights, and the collection goes up to $199.90, for outerwear, and most of it will be machine washable.\n\n“Me, I give everything to the dry cleaning, so for me it was a new way of thinking,” Ms. Roitfeld said.\n\nThe styles include faux fur leopard-print coats, herringbone wool jackets and matching pencil skirts, silk blouses and slips, in black and printed camouflage. “It’s very me,” Ms. Roitfeld said. “To have bad taste in a good way, it’s very French.”\n\nAs the former editor of French Vogue, and current founder and editor of her own magazine, CR Fashion Book, Ms. Roitfeld has spent years on the front lines of luxury. (“In this business of very luxurious brands,” she said, “we do pictures and we don’t even ask the price.”)\n\nShe is primarily a stylist, attuned to the transformative power of the minor detail, so her jacket buttonholes are real, not decorative, and her sweater sleeves cropped just so to reveal her wrist. At the Uniqlo presentation, she offered guidelines on how to twist it, by buttoning shirts incorrectly on purpose (in French, she said, this is called “buttoning Monday with Tuesday”) or pulling her fishnet tights above a skirt’s waistband."
