        "text": "After 12 exciting years leading Hearst Fujingaho Co., Ltd. and Hearst Digital Japan Co., Ltd. I have decided to take on a new challenge in France.\n\nI feel sad to leave after 20 years in Japan, 14 years in this incredible company, and 12 years as President. However, I am also leaving satisfied because the fundamentals are good and the company is bigger and stronger despite a very difficult media environment. I could not have achieved this alone. This is the result of all the Japan team’s hard work, and I want to express my gratitude to all the staff of Hearst Japan who contributed to the growth of the company, with a special thought to Nicolas Floquet, who has been by my side all these years and will become the new CEO from May 7th. Good luck to him!\n\nI want to thank Norbert Leuret and Gerald de Roquemaurel, who gave me the chance to grow up and boost my career. After the acquisition by Hearst of the international business of Lagardere Active in 2011, I had the opportunity to learn a lot. It was also really special for me to meet business people like Frank Bennack and Steven Swartz, who have been leading Hearst’s continuous growth for many years.\n\nI am proud of what we have accomplished over the past years. This has been possible because of a strong drive to innovate, a right strategy, and an excellent implementation. During my tenure, we launched 9 digital media, 5 magazines, 3 e-commerce businesses, and many interesting initiatives such as ELLE Women in Society, BAZAAR ICONS BY CARINE ROITFELD and Hearst Fujingaho Beauty Festival. I’ll miss very much not being in Japan at the time of the launch of CR Fashion Book Japan this October, a new and exciting project that we initiated with Carine Roitfeld and Vladimir Roitfeld a couple of years ago.\n\nIt was a fantastic journey! Thanks to all! And I’m looking forward to meeting you in Paris, where I’ll join the great team of Conde Nast France."
