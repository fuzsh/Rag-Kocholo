Luxury clients look to high end, digital saavy brands like Harper’s Bazaar, ELLE and Esquire, to provide a premium platform on which they can engage with their consumers through innovative, multi-platform creative ad solutions.”\n\nHearst Magazines UK, which publishes 20 magazines and websites including ELLE, Cosmopolitan, Digital Spy, Harper’s Bazaar, Good Housekeeping and Esquire, is the largest digital publisher in the UK.
