        "text": "“Welcome to my garçonnière!” says iconic French magazine editor and stylist Carine Roitfeld with a laugh as she opens the door of her cozy new Paris bachelorette pad on a late August evening. Roitfeld is standing in a black T-shirt and her brother’s 1960s Levi’s, cinched up. “I never wear jeans,” she says, apologetically. “I’m still on vacation.”\n\nWhat she does wear is black. And, as a quick sweep of the 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom flat proves, she lives in it, too. “My home is like a black box,” she concedes, as she settles into her vintage black Willy Rizzo sectional sofa, next to her friend and partner-in-design, the decorator Jean-Marc Hervier, and stubs out her cigarette in a black leather push-down ashtray.\n\nFirework content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRoitfeld bought the place a year and a half ago, when she decided it was time to start anew. She edited down what she would live with—only keeping art, photographs, and fashion she absolutely loved. Then she called Hervier, who over the years has worked for Thierry Mugler, helped produce George Michael’s “Too Funky” music video and the French television program Paris Modes, and now has two galleries (one at the Marché Paul Bert and another nearby, also in Saint-Ouen), to help her “Roitfeld” the boring midcentury box.\n\nWhile Roitfeld is a leading voice in fashion—she served as editor in chief of Vogue Paris from 2001 to 2011, now produces the biannual magazine, CR Fashion Book, has recently put out Fantasies: The Carine Roitfeld Fashion Book (Rizzoli), which is a compilation of 10 years of CR archives, and has created several perfumes, including the 7 Lovers genderless collection, Carine, and her latest, Forgive Me—she knows the interiors world well. Her mother was an antiques dealer who “would go to flea markets at 5 a.m. with a flashlight, coffee, and croissants in the dark,” she says. Through this experience, Roitfeld developed an eye for decor. And she’s now moving more firmly into the space with the Carine Roitfeld Home Collection of candles, matches, and home fragrances, all in black, naturally.\n\nHer interiors expertise also made for a collegial collaboration with Hervier. “We knocked down everything,” she says, and configured the empty rectangle into a large living/dining room overlooking one of Paris’s most famous luxury shopping streets; a “little kitchen,” as she describes it (“She’s more Coco Chanel than Paul Bocuse,” quips Hervier); a bath and WC; and a bedroom in the back that is supremely quiet. “It’s like an American caravan,” she says. “Exactly what I need, and I don’t need much.”\n\nFor the decor, Roitfeld wanted a ’70s vibe, inspired by Pierre Paulin’s mod redo of the Élysée Palace for President Georges Pompidou and his wife, Claude, in 1972. To evoke that louche cool, Roitfeld and Hervier selected key pieces by Rizzo, a celebrated photojournalist who, in the 1970s, took a break to try his hand at furniture design. “J’adore Willy Rizzo,” she says.\n\nThey filled in with 21st-century creations, including pieces by her friend, the Paris-based American designer Rick Owens, and tables from Jean-Guillaume Mathiaut for Carine Roitfeld, a collection of oak furniture she conceived with the acclaimed French sculptor and which is distributed by Hervier. “Brutalism, with sophistication,” Hervier says.\n\n“It gives the apartment a bit of a rock feel,” Roitfeld says.\n\nFor her cave-like bedroom, with walls in black Japanese paper—which Hervier bought in its natural state and painted a very specific black “because we couldn’t find paper in the right black,” he explains—she has a custom-made black leather bedcover. “I like black because it’s easy—everything goes well with it, and you see the details,” she explains. “It’s perfect for my taste.”\n\nNot that perfection means impersonal. All the decorative touches, be they large-format photography or bibelots, are cherished items that recall important people or moments in her life, like a scrapbook. Her father’s family was Russian, “so there are bits of Russia here and there,” such as her grandmother’s icons from Odesa on the shelves, and a book about the Ballets Russes on the table.\n\nOn one wall is a Polaroid of Farrah Fawcett by Andy Warhol and a Richard Avedon photo of Penelope Tree, both gifts from Tom Ford; Roitfeld and Ford collaborated for 27 years. On another, a sketch of her by Karl Lagerfeld—she worked with him for a decade at Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld, and stayed on at his namesake brand for three years after his death in 2019.\n\nIn the corner, in front of a wall of mirrors, is her ballet barre—she practiced classical dance when she was young. There’s also a mirror—black, of course—set in the decorative black chimney. “The reflections in it at night are very beautiful,” she says.\n\nShe sits back, lights up another smoke, and takes it all in. “Less things, easier is the life.”\n\nCarine Roitfeld’s Paris flat appears in AD’s December issue. Never miss an issue when you subscribe to AD.\n\nVideo director: Tim Jarrosson; Preshita Saha. Director of photography: Tim Jarrosson. Editor: Lauren Alberti.
