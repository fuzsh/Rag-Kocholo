        "text": "NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - July 28, 2016) - Harper's BAZAAR today unveiled the 2016 ICONS by Carine Roitfeld, a 17-page portfolio featuring modern icons Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West, appearing in a magazine shoot together for the first time since they were married. Photographed by Karl Lagerfeld with creative direction by Stephen Gan, the story also includes models Natasha Poly, Lara Stone and Lindsey Wixson, all lounging on pure white, just-slept-in beds. Reaching a global audience of more than 20 million in print and online, the portfolio appears in 32 editions of Harper's BAZAAR around the world. Visit harpersbazaar.com for more; the September issue hits newsstands nationwide on August 16.\n\nAn intimate image of Kim and Kanye moments before a kiss appears on the cover, with inside images of the pair with their must-have accessories: their mobile phones. Kim takes selfies, Kanye photographs Kim, they each focus intensely on their devices.\n\n\"I decided that my icons this year would be two people I really like and respect,\" Roitfeld said. \"Kanye is a genius. Kim is beautiful and shines with confidence. They are artists, great parents, friends, and talented people.\"\n\n\"This is a generation and a group of people who live with the selfies. It's their style. I think it's what they do at home. It's an interesting phenomenon of our days,\" Lagerfeld said.\n\n\"Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West are a direct reflection of the generation coming of age today; a savvy couple who merge culture and creativity, music, art and fashion,\" said Gan. \"This unifying spirit inspired us, and we chose to capture them with the ultimate intimate connection: a kiss. We hope these images taken by Karl Lagerfeld in his Paris studio (with his own antique bedsheets as props) and styled by Carine Roitfeld will be seen as a positive and romantic souvenir of our times.\"\n\n\"Collaborating with Carine and Stephen is always an incredibly creative experience and with Karl shooting, we were able to feel comfortable and be ourselves,\" Kardashian West said.\n\nHarper's BAZAAR editors from around the world will come together on Friday, September 9 to celebrate at the legendary Plaza Hotel. Partners for the event include Infor, returning for the third year, Laura Mercier, whose makeup was featured on the cover and inside the ICONS Portfolio, and Stella Artois, who will be creating a specialty cocktail, THE ICONS Cidre Cocktail by Master Beer Sommelier Marc Stroobandt, for this exclusive event.\n\nIn the U.S. and the UK, the portfolio is wrapped by Laura Mercier, both in print and online.
