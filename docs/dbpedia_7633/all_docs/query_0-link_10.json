        "text": "Carine Roitfeld joins Harper's Bazaar as global fashion director, the presidents of Hearst Magazines announced today, with her first editorial printed in March 2013 editions.\n\nThe iconic stylist will be working on spring/summer 13 stories with the creative director of US Bazaar, Stephen Gan, which will appear in all 26 international editions of the magazine, including Harper's Bazaar UK. This is the first time a publishing company has worked in such a way, with Roitfeld's fashion editorial reaching a total readership of 11.3 million people globally.\n\n\"I am thrilled to be contributing to Bazaar,\" Roitfeld commented. \"[It's] a brand with a rich history of creativity. Working with Stephen and a roster of talented photographers will be a wonderful collaboration and one that will give these stories a truly global audience.\"\n\n\"We're very excited about what Carine will bring to Bazaar editions around the world,\" Duncan Edwards, the president and CEO of Hearst Magazines reiterated. \"This collaboration marks the first time anything like this has been done. She is a visionary in the fashion world and we are so happy to be working with her.\"\n\nRoitfeld's position at Bazaar will be on top of her role as Editor-in-Chief at her eponymous publication CR Fashion Book, which debuted this September. Expect her first editorials in the March 2013 edition of Bazaar."
