        "text": "Sale PSA: A smocked linen dress from Marysia, now under $350, very cool Gianvito Rossi lace up ankle boots, now 50% off, a floral jumpsuit from Rebecca Taylor, now 50% off, and double strap sandals from Manolo Blahnik, now 60% off.\n\n1. My sale pick this week – these Gianvito Rossi slingbacks (40% off).\n\nNothing outrageous or unusual – just a classic pair of leather pumps, with perfect details (love the clasp), at a good sale price. I’ve noticed that for classic items at decent prices, that inventory has been slim, which makes sense – on other stuff, there’s still LOTS of sale inventory.\n\n2. Thank you to L. Bermont, for sharing in last week’s comments this fascinating blog on MLMs. Read and you will get sucked down the rabbit hole! Now I want the US version.\n\n3. Sharing this piece, on how Carine Roitfeld gets things done, via the The Cut. Actually I had no idea she had a perfume. Did you? What’s the “influence” of a Carine Roitfeld these days, I wonder?\n\n4. This fun (is that the right word)? piece, via Quartz, on how former Theranos employees explain their time at the company.\n\n5. This week, I read The Kill Artist, by Daniel Silva.\n\nYou know those authors you always see on the shelves, but you’ve never actually read their stuff? Silva was one of those for me. I had never consciously looked for his name but first became interested when The Other Woman was one of Pennies Picks for Costco (shameless brag that yours truly was the pick a few months later). I finally decided to start on his Gabriel Allon series, starting at the first book. And it was good! Really good, and the writing was a lot better than a lot of other thrillers I’ve read lately (I actually read quite a lot that I don’t recommend here). If you’re looking for a fast paced thriller, I recommend The Kill Artist."
