        "text": "Carine Roitfeld is a stylist and creative consultant based in Paris. From 2001-2011 she was editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris. Roitfeld was born in Paris and started her career in fashion as a model at a young age. Soon after, she became a writer and stylist at ELLE magazine in France. In 1990, she met the photographer Mario Testino, forming a collaboration that has continued throughout both their careers including shoots for US Vogue and Vogue Paris. Roitfeld began consulting for the brands Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent alongside Tom Ford, as well as working with labels such as Missoni, Versace and Calvin Klein on their image and advertising.\n\nSince her departure from Vogue Paris, she has retained huge influence, and has returned to freelance styling working on campaigns for Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier and Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci as well as personal projects such as devising the window displays and catalogues for Barney's New York. Since 2011, Roitfeld has contributed to a number of international magazines including W, V and Visionaire. In 2011, she published Irreverent - a compilation of her editorial shoots and advertising campaigns over a three-decade career. In 2012, she joined Harper's Bazaar as global fashion director and in 2013 was listed as one of the '50 Best Dressed Over 50' by the Guardian."
