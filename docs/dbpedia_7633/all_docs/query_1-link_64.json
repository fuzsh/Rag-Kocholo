        "text": "Uniqlo has announced the Fall/Winter 2015 launch of the Carine Roitfeld Collection, a collaboration with Carine Roitfeld, founder and editor-in-chief of the CR Fashion Book.\n\nThe new women’s line reflects Roitfeld’s broad experience with numerous designers and creators to bring new styles to the world. The new collection is based on UNIQLO’s LifeWear high quality clothing that promotes comfort and is available at reasonable prices. The designs were overseen by Naoki Takizawa, Uniqlo Design Director, and it includes about 40 items from stylish outer to feminine innerwear. The collection will be available at Uniqlo flagship stores worldwide and through the online store from the end of October 2015.\n\nCommenting on the announcement, Carine Roitfeld said: “I feel joy at creating new mode expressions. I am constantly asking myself what these are, and creating new clothing within the Uniqlo LifeWear concept is a great challenge. I started from the idea of clothes that I would want to wear myself, and developed this into clothes that anyone would want to wear, a woman’s ideal of clothes that make her feel transformed when she wears them.”\n\nNaoki Takizawa, Uniqlo design director said: “Carine goes to see collections all around the world, and the visuals that emerge from this relentless pursuit of leading edge fashion have had a tremendous influence on the fashion industry. I believe that a new type of LifeWear will be created through her work.”\n\nTadashi Yanai, Fast Retailing chairman, president and CEO, said: “Ms. Roitfeld is a charismatic fashion editor and influential figure in the fashion world, and we are extremely happy to present this collection with her as our collaborative partner. Uniqlo’s aim is to create everyday clothing that is functional, comfortable, and reasonably priced. I am pleased that this new collection will allow us to present our customers worldwide with a new type of Uniqlo LifeWear.”\n\nCarine Roitfeld is the founder and editor-in-chief of the CR Fashion Book, as well as the global fashion director of Harper’s Bazaar internationally. She previously worked as editor-in-chief of French Vogue, from 2001 to 2011, and spent years working in the areas of editing and style for publications such as French Glamour, V Magazine, French Elle, and The Face.\n\nShe also redefined brands with campaigns for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Calvin Klein, Chanel and Tom Ford. Carine Roitfeld’s work has been documented in one book: Irreverent, published by Rizzoli in 2011."
