        "text": "It makes total sense that the first product Carine Roitfeld is releasing under her own brand is scents. Fragrances can trigger submerged memories, stir up emotional responses, and rouse desire—which is exactly what characterizes this editor’s work. Roitfeld is this year’s recipient of the CFDA’s Founder’s Award, created in honor of Eleanor Lambert, who put American fashion on the map. Roitfeld, for her part, introduced a boldly sensual aesthetic that defined the 1990s and continues to be influential today. One imagines she would have been Helmut Newton’s dream. Certainly her talents have been highly valued by designers like Tom Ford, Karl Lagerfeld, and Riccardo Tisci.\n\nWith her high heels, trench coats, and kohl-smudged eyes, Roitfeld embodies the “French Girl” ideal—which she dismisses as being mostly irrelevant. Still, Roitfeld is a big believer in fiction: “My fantasy always appears in the pictures,” she’s said. Roitfeld’s narratives are often imbued with ’70s flair; they celebrate sexual liberation, and also difference. She was the first to put a transgender model on the cover of Vogue. “I’m always fearless regarding beauty,” Roitfeld told us. Continue reading for her thoughts on Mr. Ford, stilettos, and her inner punk.\n\nCarine on Carine\n\n[What] makes me different than everyone else is my way to be fearless in front of fashion, in my way to love fashion, and in a way, my personality. Fashion people [have a reputation for being] very snobby and not accessible, [but] when people meet me, they think I’m nice. And I’m very accessible, even [when] I’m wearing sunglasses a lot because I’m shy. People come to me very easily to take selfies all the time, which is quite nice—maybe not as much as Karl Lagerfeld, but he was a very accessible person, too. I’m quite humble, and I’m quite a hard worker and never stop, and I like big challenges, and maybe that makes me a bit different than other people in fashion.\n\nI was born after the war, and it’s true we got another education: [We were taught to] never waste any food, any clothes; and I’m known for not changing, not wasting things; I’m saving. I got my [first] Chanel bag when I was 40. I’m someone who has a lot of respect for fashion, someone who didn’t get everything immediately. I made my own way to what I am today. To be a success with my kids and my granddaughter, and to be able to keep on pushing open doors, and now to work on my own brand. So it never stops.\n\n[One of my aims has been] to be first a good mother, and maybe this makes me more someone more [relatable] to a lot of women. Since I’m a grandma, I did a cosmetics campaign, and since I’m a grandma, I’ve never been on so many covers. I would like people to think of me as someone a bit different.\n\nOn Building Her Own Brand\n\nVladimir told me that my name had become a brand. I didn’t realize this, maybe because I’m French and he was studying in America, so maybe he has another way of thinking. For me, I just was a good stylist, a good editor in chief helping a lot of designers [build] success—that was my job. I worked a lot with Karl Lagerfeld to make his campaigns, so I’m very good at that. [At Vogue], I never thought about business—I was just a very free spirit. I wanted to show new people, new faces, new clothes. I put clothes together very easy and instinctually.\n\nVladimir came up with this idea [of building a brand]. He said maybe it’s time to work for yourself, after all you have done, to have something for yourself and make your own brand that will stay as a legacy. We start with a perfume; it is to be the first one of a continuity of products. The next one will be related to the perfume—candles, of course candles, but not classic ones. And maybe some makeup and some fashion, because people associate me more with fashion than perfume, no?\n\nI never thought I was going to work with my son; it came about organically, I would say. He said, “Maybe now, Mom, it’s time I join you and I help you structure your business.” He was supposed to keep on doing his art gallery, but finally he didn’t have enough time, so he stopped that for the moment and he’s now working with me and my team 100 percent of the time. He comes up with huge ideas, always, and I say, “Oh, my God, I’ll never stop working if you come with ideas this way!” We really make a great team.\n\nOn Amity\n\nIt’s a tough business, the fashion business, [but I believe] that you can be very faithful with your friends, you can be a good mother, you can be fearless in fashion. Friendships are important for me. People say, ”You cannot have any friends in fashion,” but that’s totally wrong. It’s been more than 25 years I’m working with my old friend Tom Pecheux, and now with Tom Ford it is 25 years we collaborate. Helmut Lang still sends me texts for my birthday, and a few weeks ago, I was invited for dinner with Martin Margiela. I know this is a big scoop, but it’s true. He invited me for dinner tête-à-tête in his home and he cooked for me. I hadn’t seen him for years. Nobody knows I worked with him; I made a show for him, and special fashion for him at Vogue. I have special relationships with a lot of photographers and a lot of models, too. When I find someone, I’m very faithful.\n\nOn Her Fragrances\n\nYou know I’m very faithful in perfume, too. I wore for 20 years the same perfume, my first creation, and I never wanted to change. It was Opium—because I love the name, of course, and I love Saint Laurent—mixed with orange blossom flower from Serge Lutens. I like the idea that people recognize me by my scent, in the elevator, in the office, to know I was there, and left.\n\nMy first challenge when I started to work on my perfume was to stop wearing [the one I had worn for 20 years]. So the first scent I decided to create with the nose was something that reminded me a bit of the one I was supposed to leave. It was a challenge, but we succeeded. It’s [inspired by] Paris, [and of the seven fragrances we created] it’s the one that is the most like what I was wearing before.\n\nOn Tom Ford\n\nI love my Gucci years. I think between Tom and Mario [Testino], I was very lucky because everyone pushed the ideas of the other. We had so much fun; they were the best years possible. Tom has a big sense of humor, and it’s 25 years we’re working together. We support each other; he used my daughter as the first face for his own fragrance, and it’s very important for me that he likes the bottle that I did because I trust in his taste. He has great taste—we have a bit the same taste, I would say. We work very well together.\n\n[At Gucci,] Tom came with this idea that for him women and men could be equally sexy. Before, women [were seen as] more sexy than men, but for him men could be as sexy as women; so in the campaigns men and women were at the same level—they were equals.\n\nOn Breaking Rules\n\nI have a bourgeois education, and I always refuse and make fun [of the things I learned] from this bourgeois education. I hate all the supposedly “good” things. I would not say I’m rejecting what I learned, but I was taught a lot of things that I have come to think are not important. I want to open the gate; I don’t want people stuck with these old habits. Maybe I’m a punk, even if you don’t see it in [on the outside]. Inside myself, I’m a rebel; I don’t have a tattoo, I don’t have orange hair, but I like Vivienne Westwood, I like the Sex Pistols, and I love all this rebellion of young kids.\n\nOn Heels\n\nI’m not small, but I’m not so tall, and I like to be the same height as the models and the same height as the photographers to be able to talk to them [looking] in the eyes. When you’re wearing high heels, it gives you a new way of sitting, of crossing your legs, or even of talking. Just the idea that you’re wearing high heels makes you feel like a different person. I have to wear lower heels because I broke my back, so unfortunately they’re just 9 [centimeters] now, not 11 or 12 like before.\n\nOn Working With Models\n\nI’m very open-minded to different sorts of beauty. I think if you just stick to the codes, you don’t find the right people. [Working with a model is] like falling in love with someone—falling in love in a fantasy way, you know. When I met Lara Stone, she was not working anymore; she wanted to stop because no one booked her. When Riccardo Tisci introduced me to her, I said, “My God! She’s so beautiful. There is so much emotion in her face.” I just have to have like a love at first glance for a model. Lea T, for example, I think she is amazing [looking] and an amazing person. It’s not just the face; it’s what they have inside.\n\nOn Being a Fashion Mama\n\nBecause I’m a mom, I’m always thinking that the models could be my kids, so I’m very mama with all of them, and many models call me their fashion mom. I’m always asking: “Are you cold? Are you sure you want to be naked?” I’m very mama with the models, boys or girls. I’m happy that now everyone will have to do the same.\n\nOn the Disappearance of the French Girl Mystique\n\nThere is this fantasy of the Parisian woman, and maybe for a lot of people I’m this girl they dream of—who doesn’t really exist anymore. [I’m wearing] the trench coat and naked legs and ankle bracelets—very French—with white shoes, which is very French too. It makes me happy if I can be the face of a French woman and make a lot of fantasy, but in another way I hope I’m seen as a good person with a family, not just a sexy person. There are more interesting things in life than just what I’m wearing.\n\nOn What She Wanted to Be When She Grew Up\n\nWhen I was 15, if you asked me what I wanted to do, I would answer a butcher. I don’t know why I like knives. [Maybe it’s] because when I was a little girl, my job was to cut the raw meat for the dog and I like the feeling, that’s horrible to say, but I like the feeling of cutting raw meat. I did a butcher story with Eva Herzigova. I never promote guns; I never promote violence in my pictures. Okay, I promote sex, but it was always funny, more with a sense of humor. If I use knives, it is because I have this fantasy to be a butcher.\n\nOn Her Eyebrows\n\nYou know what? I was born this way, and I’m very lucky they’re still there because in the ’70s I plucked them a lot and they came back. People thought they were hideous at the time, but after you see Margaux Hemingway—and Cara Delevingne—she made a success because of her eyebrows.\n\nOn Karl Lagerfeld\n\nI really miss Karl. I have not made my mourning yet; actually, I will never be able to. I will never be able to live without him. He’s still a big part of me. He was like my second father; even if I was maybe 50 when I really started working with him, he really raised me. He was like a special schoolteacher; I learned so much from Karl: never to be afraid of anything; to be the first one to do something, even if people don’t care or like it.\n\nWhen I left Vogue, Karl was the first one to say to Jonathan [Newhouse], “Thank you, Jonathan, because now me and Mr. Arnault are going to be able to work with Carine. Thank you so much.” (You are not allowed to do advertising when you are the editor in chief of Vogue). Right away, I started to do campaigns with Karl; now it has been 10 years of campaigns. We kept working, working, and working, and he never wanted to do something he did already, so it became more and more difficult to find ideas. I always had to be quick with Karl, very quick, because he got bored very easily.\n\nOn the Biggest Risk She’s Taken\n\nMaybe the biggest risk I have taken is to open the gate. I was the first one to put a transgender model on a cover of French Vogue—he is black with a beard and I put him in a mini coat because he had beautiful legs. Everything was against me in a way, but I used it; it was fantastic with an edge, you know. I was the first to use a girl with a Muslim scarf; curvy girls. . . . I dedicated an entire issue to Liya Kebede. At that time, it was the first time that someone dedicated an entire issue to a black girl. People said, “Don’t do it; it’s not going to sell.” And I said, “Why? She’s beautiful? What’s the difference? She’s just beautiful for me; I want her and not anyone else.” And the issue sold very well. Maybe I was one of the first because I’m always fearless regarding beauty. I feel beauty everywhere. I don’t have a code of beauty. I don’t listen to other people; people are afraid. I’m not afraid. I respect people, but I’m not afraid of what could happen. You never know why you’re going to be attacked, never, so you have to trust yourself and respect people.\n\nWhen I put Halima Aden on the cover [of CR Fashion Book] with her [hijab], I think she was the first [to do so]. It was risky in a way, but it’s opened doors. Halima is beautiful; she’s the voice of UNICEF. When I met her, she had still braces, and now she’s on the cover of Sports Illustrated, the first one in a burkini bathing suit. “Thank you, Carine!” She would never be on that cover, she told me [without that CR cover]. I like when people don’t have a short memory; some people don’t want to remember that you were there at the beginning.\n\nOn Fantasy\n\nAs a Virgo you have two faces; one is very quiet, and one’s a bit crazy. My crazy part is always in the pictures—my fantasy always appears in the pictures. I think we need fantasy in the world and some dreams [in fashion]. People love fashion more and more; it’s unbelievable how much the young kids love fashion, how many CVs I receive each day and coming out of the shows from people who want to work with me as an intern. I keep the dream; I’m a dreamer, you know. I think fashion is here to make you dream, and it’s good that now because of the expansion of fashion, whether you are skinny or curvy, 20 or 60, you can dream about fashion and what makes you more beautiful. I think fashion has to be a dream for everyone.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed."
