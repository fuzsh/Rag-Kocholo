        "text": "In five years, thousands of media employees have come together to unionize their workplaces and negotiate union contracts. Fundamentally, the demand of any group of workers forming a union is the same – to win a formal seat at the table in order to negotiate over the future of their workplace. Each group decides what to advocate for at the bargaining table as a union.\n\nThough priorities vary from workplace to workplace, the issues tend to revolve around the same categories. Media employees want to address core economic concerns, including: pay equity and transparency, preserving or improving benefits (leave time, 401k, health insurance), regular and fair cost of living increases, working conditions (such as hours), job security, and intellectual property and proper crediting. Creative professionals also negotiate to address workplace “culture” issues, including: diversity and equity, corporate transparency and communication, and editorial policies and independence.\n\nNegotiating a union contract is a core element of any unionized workplace, however, it doesn’t stop there. Organized workplaces have structures for democratic representation and collective decision making processes. That means that unionized companies have a mechanism in place to share information across employees and to take collective action if and when necessary. This includes, for example, regular meetings with management and organizing workplace diversity committees.\n\nThrillist Union member Anthony Schneck wrote in his own words why he and co-workers came together to organize a union.\n\nLeadership and internal structures, ownership, and editorial direction of media and news companies change rapidly. Organizing is a way to ensure a seat at the table and guarantee terms of employment, including policies on severance, layoffs, discipline, and termination. Companies expand rapidly and workers deserve a seat at the table to participate in decisions made about the future of the companies they helped build. For example, HuffPost and Vox Media negotiated unprecedented contract language that provides a process for revenue sharing of derivative works.\n\nAdditionally, union membership expands the role of editorial staff in the management and direction of a company. Union members in media participate in building the company through the creation of committees and increased communication and collaboration across regions and departments.\n\nOrganizing a union isn’t only about the future of one company. Industries with union density have fewer pay gaps and higher pay overall. Union members across the industry are working together to support each other and build a long-term movement to address and change systemic issues like diversifying the media industry and protecting critical journalism.\n\nGiven the global pandemic, we find ourselves in a unique moment – obviously, these are unprecedented times. Hearst executives may use this talking point to try to persuade us that now is not the right time to form a union. But it’s just the opposite: it is clear that we need to have a seat at the table. We formed our union to ensure that we all have a voice and more security at work, and to bring us together in times of great difficulty. And we believe that the best way to navigate the ever-changing media industry, pandemic or not, is together.\n\nThey may also point to media companies that have laid off or furloughed employees or otherwise made cuts during the pandemic, and insist that it’s because those companies have unions. This is false: many unionized media companies have not laid off employees or made cuts – and plenty of non-unionized media companies have. The difference is that if Hearst does need to make tough decisions around employment, they must negotiate with our union first. Read Vox Media Union’s Twitter thread about what happened with their furloughs.\n\nOne of the most common anti-union talking points is the idea that the union is an outside entity that will impose restrictive rules or create more bureaucracy. Management will often ask staff to give the company a chance to make improvements before bringing in a union. But the union is not a third party. It’s all of our colleagues coming together to establish common priorities and bargain collectively over the terms and conditions of our employment. It’s the only way for staff to have a guaranteed seat at the table and a guaranteed say in pay, working conditions, and benefits. The union can be used to establish things like employee site reps and labor management committees, which both increase, not limit, open lines of communication.\n\nMedia industry executives also may try to scare their employees by arguing that a union will threaten innovation. As VICE, G/O Media, Vox Media, Group Nine, and HuffPost have already demonstrated, a union contract that creates fair working conditions does not hinder creative flexibility. You can read their contracts here.\n\nOften these messages are delivered by management via email as well as individual and group meetings. Most anti-union campaigns use the same script – one example is management’s unsuccessful anti-union campaign at Thrillist. Management is not allowed to interrogate, intimidate or threaten you over your union activity. If you feel your rights have been infringed upon, contact the Hearst Union Organizing Committee: hearstunion@gmail.com.\n\nDues ensure that Guild members have the resources to negotiate and enforce strong contracts, seek legal support, and implement member-driven events and programs.\n\nNo one pays dues until a first contract is negotiated and voted upon. It’s up to us to work together to advocate for a strong contract and then decide, through voting, whether or not to ratify the contract.\n\nWGAE dues are set by the Council (a governing body made up of elected members). Dues are 1.5% of earnings + $40/quarter membership fee. After a contract is negotiated and ratified, dues are deducted each pay period. Upon leaving a union shop, individuals can decide to continue paying the $40/quarter fee to retain Guild membership. The $500 initiation fee is a one-time fee that is waived for anyone on staff before a union contract is in place; it can be paid in installments by anyone hired after contract ratification.\n\nThe NLRB will mail ballots to all of us on June 12th. We encourage you to send yours back as soon as you receive it! You must return your ballot so that it is received by the NLRB by July 13th (this should allow plenty of time for us to ask for replacement ballots from the NLRB if any of us have a problem with the mail). It is important to note that the NLRB is a federal agency and they will administer this secret ballot election completely independently, using our mailing addresses that have been provided by Hearst. If you believe the address Hearst provided may be incorrect or you move at any point between now and the ballot due date, please get in touch with us ASAP (hearstunion@gmail.com, or talk to your organizing committee rep). And please reach out to your organizing committee rep no later than June 26th if you have not received a ballot.\n\nA workplace is “officially” union upon winning union recognition. Union recognition means that the company has a legal obligation to bargain a contract. Most media companies have respected their employees’ democratic right to organize and recognized the union after a neutral third party verifies that a majority of employees signed union authorization cards. In a few cases, media companies insisted on an election and attempted to dissuade people from continuing to organize in the lead up to the vote. For example, employees at Group Nine, Slate, Gimlet Media, and Onion, Inc. won union recognition after an online election.\n\nIn our case, Hearst rejected our request for voluntary recognition and forced a lengthy NLRB process, even though a strong majority of us already demonstrated support for our union by signing union cards. Our union will be officially certified after we win the election.\n\nAfter winning recognition or voting online or through the NLRB, employees nominate a union bargaining committee that will negotiate a first contract with the company. A union contract is only in effect after being bargained and voted into place by the employees covered by the union.\n\nAfter a majority of the votes cast are in favor of our union, the NLRB will certify our union as the bargaining representative for editorial staff at all our brands. After NLRB certification, Hearst will be legally obligated to engage in good faith bargaining with our union. Then we will proceed to contract negotiations by filling out bargaining surveys to identify important issues to address in our first contract and we will nominate representatives from every brand to serve on the Hearst Union bargaining committee to compile the survey results and represent all of us in negotiations.\n\nOnce our union is certified, the company will be obligated to maintain the status quo when it comes to our terms and conditions of employment, unless we, the union, agree to change them. The company will no longer be able to unilaterally change our benefits without negotiation.\n\nFor an overview of the process, the NLRB has a fact sheet that goes into more detail here."
