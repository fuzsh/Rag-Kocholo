        "text": "My first encounter with Carine Roitfeld was in 1997. It was the height of the mad cow disease scare and The Face had just published The Butcher, a fashion shoot starring Eva Herzigova posing with meat in a butcher’s shop shot by Mario Testino, 13 years before Lady Gaga’s now-infamous meat dress moment at the VMAs.\n\nIt’s a moment Roitfeld looks back on fondly and one that characterises her career.\n\nIn her world, fashion imagery transcends clothes; it’s a reflection of what’s going on in the world. And in doing so, she’s gained a reputation for exploring territories others are afraid to.\n\nIt’s seen her dedicate an entire issue of French Vogue to African model Liya Kebede long before magazines began championing models of colour and also led her to discover model Lara Stone.\n\n‘People said: “She’s too big, you can’t zip up the skirt,” but I didn’t care,’ she says. ‘I thought she was beautiful and then she ended up being a big star. It’s always good to follow your instinct.\n\n‘Fashion is a fantasy. Who wants to look like the girl next door? Fashion should make people dream. People say I’m provocative but it’s not on purpose or to shock. I just don’t like it when people tell me not to do something.’\n\nRoitfeld makes the perfect documentary subject, according to film director Fabien Constant. For nine months, she opened her world to him for his new documentary, Mademoiselle C, as she started her own magazine, CR Fashion Book, after being at the helm of French Vogue for a decade.\n\nThe news of her departure from Vogue was announced in December 2010 and sent shockwaves through the fashion industry. The subsequent appointment of former close ally Emmanuelle Alt as editor made sure the story stayed in the headlines.\n\nThere was talk Roitfeld had been dismissed after publishing the controversial Tom Ford issue of the magazine, which included a fashion shoot with a six-year-old made up as a grown woman and a Western-themed shoot called ‘Pussy West’.\n\nIt was reportedly the last straw in a string of clashes with the powers that be at the magazine’s publishing house. Roitfeld dismisses the rumours and says she just felt it was her time to go.\n\n‘I was very happy there for ten years but it was the moment to stop because I wanted to do something different,’ she says.\n\n‘Other-wise I would have stayed in that office for another 20 years doing the same thing. Now I can make a film or a book, be a muse, a cover girl for MAC, the face of Givenchy. It’s exciting to be able to be all of these different faces of fashion.’\n\nAs we sit on the sofa of her expansive suite, she’s perched coquettishly, legs crossed, smiling. Wearing a mix of Margiela and Rick Owens, it’s hard to take your eyes off her.\n\nHer deep, thick French accent is seductive and her energy is magnetic. She’s the woman everyone wants to emulate and was well aware of the power of her image long before her peers.\n\n‘It’s very new,’ she says of the attention on her and others behind the scenes. ‘People want to know everything. Fashion is the new dream. There are many editors who are better than me who have not had the same success. There were lots of editors at French Elle who were my teachers but nobody ever talks about them.’\n\nIn one scene in the documentary, she visits New York’s It designer Joseph Altuzarra, where she finds his mood board covered with images of her outfits but the attention hasn’t gone to her head.\n\n‘When I turn up to the shows, there are all these photographers snapping,’ she says of the hysteria she causes among street style paps. ‘But I’m shy. That’s why I put my hair in front of my face and sometimes put on glasses. It’s not to hide myself. I’m just shy.’\n\nFilming the documentary was a cathartic process, she says. ‘It was good therapy for me. I left my door open to Fabien. He edited the film by himself, he chose all the music.’\n\nBut how did she feel when she saw the final edit? ‘Of course you hate your voice, you hate your face but I gave my absolute confidence to Fabien. When I give confidence, I give it all.’\n\nIf you’re expecting The Devil Wears Prada, you’ve got the wrong movie. What the movie lacks in emotion, it makes up for in presenting a more realistic representation of the business. ‘It’s very easy to make a caricature of fashion and I knew [Constant] wouldn’t do that because he knows fashion.’\n\nThe documentary doesn’t shy away from the more challenging sides of the business, from talking about budgets, or lack thereof, to Roitfeld being let down by some of her long-time collaborators.\n\n‘This magazine has been hard work and you don’t see that in a lot of documentaries,’ she says. ‘Things such as running for a plane or having to pay more for luggage. All of those stupid little things are part of your work and I think the film shows that side of the industry.’\n\nThe biannual magazine is far from your usual fashion title. Instead, Roitfeld has designed it to be a feast for the eyes using the most visually alluring fashion shoots, much in the same way you would see in a coffee table photo book.\n\n‘Everyone sees the same thing at the same time so you have to be different,’ she says. ‘Thinking differently is my strength. That’s what Steve Jobs said, right: “Think different,” and that’s what you need when starting a new magazine.’\n\nRoitfeld makes no secret, though, that the transition has been challenging.\n\nThe documentary shows her swap a huge team for just one other full-time member of staff. It also explores her struggle as her former employers prevent photographers and models – many of whom she supported – from working with her.\n\n‘In a way, it’s good to see whether these people are loyal or not,’ she says. ‘I’ve lost friends but it’s normal. My life doesn’t stop. The people I lost were not friends and, sometimes, it makes you rediscover old people. At the end of the day you’re a winner.’\n\nTom Ford, Givenchy’s Riccardo Tisci, Karl Lagerfeld and supermodels Lara Stone, Stephanie Seymour and Linda Evangelista all make cameos in the film and are among the group she deems loyal.\n\n‘I’m friends with them and I give a lot but they have to be faithful to me. They can’t forget,’ she says.\n\nAs we wrap up, she asks me how long it will take to get to Tom Ford’s show location at London Fashion Week. She doesn’t want to be late and her crowd is waiting.\n\n‘Tom told me you have to love the camera,’ she says, smiling. ‘They’re my public. You don’t choose your public, your public chooses you.’\n\nMademoiselle C is out on DVD now."
