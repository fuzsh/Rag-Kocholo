        "text": "Carine Roitfeld’s New Gig: Carine Roitfeld’s unceremonious departure from French Vogue two years ago wasn't a career-ender in the least. First came the launch of her CR Fashion Book in September, and a MAC Cosmetics collaboration. Now, she’s been named as the global fashion director of Harper’s Bazaar magazine. Roitfeld will work side by side with close friend and Bazaar’s US creative director, Stephen Gan, on several stories a year starting with the March 2013 issues, while she continues with her other projects, CR included. Hearst Magazines’ CEO David Carey said of the appointment in a release, “Carine is one of the fashion world’s most influential tastemakers and we look forward to seeing what she does with Bazaar.” [Fashion Beast Inbox]\n\nValentino Receives Third French Honor: Valentino Garavani was bestowed with l’order des Arts et des Lettres last night in Paris for his contributions to the arts. The honor is one of the most prestigious awards in France, but it’s not the first time the designer has been honored by the French—it’s actually his third. He’s previously been recognized with the Legion d’Honneur and the Medalle de la ville de Paris. [Vogue UK]\n\nRodarte for Starbucks?: Collaborations are always rampant in fashion, but more times than not, the partnership makes perfect sense. Such is definitely not the case with the announcement of Rodarte’s holiday collaboration with Starbucks. The Mulleavy sisters have created a specially designed travel mug, cup sleeve, tote bag, and gift card that feature a pixilated version of Starbucks’ signature siren logo. The items will hit cafés and online on November 13. [Businessweek]"
