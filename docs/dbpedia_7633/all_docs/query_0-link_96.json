        "text": "“I think Carine always throws a great party, and she’s such an icon. That’s why she can get so many icons in one room,” Gigi Hadid said last night as The Plaza Hotel’s Grand Ballroom became packed with fashion folk giving a major send off to New York Fashion Week at Harper’s Bazaar’s annual ICONS celebration. Most of the “icons” selected by the magazine’s international fashion editor, Carine Roitfeld, were in attendance along with the new brat pack of it-girl models. Ms. Hadid was joined by her sister Bella Hadid, and best pals Kendall Jenner and Hailey Baldwin.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Her first hit single, “I Kissed A Girl,” was dedicated to fellow songstress Mariah Carey, who also appears in Ms. Roitfeld’s photo spread shot by Jean-Paul Goude. Ms. Carey, ever the diva, looked on half-heartedly.\n\nMs. Perry also dedicated her final hit, “Firework,” to all of the assistants attending the party and catering to the temperamental celebrities and editors. “This next song is a song, I want you to remember when you’re going about your day, and you rip your pants, you have two Band-Aids fall off of the back of your heels, you’re sweating, and there’s coffee all over your blouse,” she said. “I’m talking about all the assistants here, and you feel, maybe, like a little plastic bag.”\n\nWhile there may still be one more day of shows left on the calendar, the evening marked the end of fashion week for most of the assistants running on little food and even less sleep. “Fashion Week’s almost over,” Ms. Perry told the crowd at the close of her performance. “You can drink!”"
