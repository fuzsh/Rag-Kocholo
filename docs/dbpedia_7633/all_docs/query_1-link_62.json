        "text": "I'm gonna need a couple days\n\nto process what's just happened to me.\n\nTwo dreams that I almost never dreamt\n\nbecause they were too big of dreams to ever come true.\n\nThat's how it feels.\n\nLike just pinch me all over my body.\n\n[calm jazz music]\n\nHello Vogue.\n\nWelcome to the last fitting of the Vogue World.\n\nIf you follow me, we bring some behind the scenes,\n\nsome little tricks, some memorable looks, and amazing girls.\n\nSo follow me.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm very happy in a fun way to go back to work\n\nafter more than 10 years.\n\nAnd to participate in an event like this one in my city.\n\nBecause I'm a real Parisian. I think it's means a lot.\n\nI want it perfect and I want that people can feel\n\nthe Parisian vibes in the show.\n\nI hope I will be successful.\n\nAlexandre Samson, our curator, had this genius idea\n\nto share 120 years of fashion\n\nand the anniversary of 400 years\n\nof Olympics and Paralympics in 10 decades.\n\nSo from the twenties to the 2010.\n\nSo there is a lot of fashion,\n\nmaybe a lot of people don't know about\n\nwho never seen the vintage pieces.\n\nSo we're going to have a lot of dancers,\n\nwe're going to have a lot of athletes.\n\nWe're going to have singers,\n\nmore than 150 models, a lot of looks.\n\nSo it's going to be a huge, huge show.\n\nWe're here. I'm so sorry.\n\n[Carine] And I love Amelia.\n\nHi.\n\n[Carine] She was a part of the team.\n\nShe's not like a diva on her own.\n\nShe's like life.\n\nAnd she give a lot. She give love.\n\nWhat am I gonna wear? Hi.\n\nChanel Vintage One. How are you?\n\nHow are you?\n\nAm I? Yes.\n\nReally?\n\n[Alexandre Morgado] Like this one.\n\nStop it! Yeah, so.\n\nWe just need to fit this shape\n\nand then we will add some fringes.\n\nChanel? Yes.\n\nWhat? Chanel to you,\n\nfrom the twenties.\n\nWhat? Yeah, we were made aware.\n\nFor Vogue World? Yes.\n\n[Carine] It's not a long time that Amelia is working\n\nas a fashion model.\n\nIt's quite new I think, maybe two years. Not more.\n\nWow.\n\n[Carine] And you see the energy is so positive,\n\nso she's a generous person. I like her.\n\n[upbeat violin music]\n\nFor her, black and the white here,\n\nbecause it's like a degradee, will be perfect with her.\n\nYou know sometimes you imagine a girl in the dress.\n\nAnd I think will be the perfect one.\n\nWow.\n\nChanel.\n\n[ethereal music]\n\nCarine is everything. Vogue is everything.\n\nThis is all everything. So I'm just extremely honored.\n\nI like it a bit higher.\n\nIt's what we, Yeah yeah yeah.\n\nYeah,\n\n'cause then I can walk. And for you to walk\n\n[Amelia] it's better. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah yeah.\n\n[Carine] And it's better for the legs\n\nand I think it's better for the dress.\n\nThis is insane. From the twenties.\n\n24. 24.\n\nYour mom is going to cry again.\n\nOh my God. I just got off the phone with her.\n\nShe's like, Better give Carine the biggest hug for me.\n\nYeah, she's gonna cry.\n\nI don't think I'm gonna tell her that I'm wearing Chanel.\n\n[Carine] No, don't tell her.\n\nI'm not gonna tell anyone anything.\n\nThis is something that goes above and beyond dreams.\n\nNot just because Vogue World, of course,\n\nis the most insane dream of my life,\n\nbut Chanel Vogue World is like two dreams\n\nthat I almost never dreamt\n\nbecause they were too big of dreams to ever come true.\n\nThat's how it feels like just pinch me all over my body.\n\nThe other day I just watched Midnight in Paris,\n\nwhich is like all about the different eras in Paris\n\nand one of the biggest eras\n\nthat they highlight is the twenties and the flapper dresses.\n\nAnd I think that's one of my favorite eras.\n\nAnd if I could go back to an era,\n\nit would be Paris in the twenties in Chanel\n\nas Pablo Picasso's muse.\n\nAnd I feel like that.\n\nSo that's how this dress makes me feel. [laugh]\n\n[Anna Wintour] Hi. Hi.\n\n[Amelia] You look amazing. Good to see you.\n\nThis is an easier dress to get on\n\nthan the last one I saw you in.\n\nThis is definitely an easier one. And what a surprise.\n\nI had no idea. You guys, thank you.\n\nTwenties Chanel. Gorg.\n\n[Amelia] Sorry.\n\n[Carine] When you see the Amelia Gray dresses,\n\npeople understand totally the shape\n\nand the work of the twenties.\n\nSo it was no waist. It was quite, uh.\n\nAnd a lot of beads.\n\nAs you're going to add some more beads for Amelia.\n\nEverything is, I tell you, is handmade.\n\nIt's what we call in French le petit man.\n\nIn old couture, they're very, very important.\n\nAnd I like the people that making this dress\n\ncome here to make the fitting too.\n\nBecause usually that sort of dresses\n\nwe take them with white gloves because they so fragile.\n\nThis time people of Chanel were there,\n\npeople of couture were there\n\nso they can make alteration in the couture way.\n\nAnd I learned something quite interesting this morning.\n\nI say, but there is not the logo Chanel inside the dress.\n\nAs you know, this is bad luck to put the logo\n\nbefore the dress is totally finished.\n\nSo I'm a very superstitious person,\n\nso it's means a lot for me.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAnd it's fun to work with Anna.\n\nIt's the first time I'm working with her\n\nand I'm happy for finally after all these years at work,\n\nwe can be doing something together.\n\nShe's so tall, you know. She's so tall.\n\n[Carine] Because people always say that we are fighting.\n\nI never fight with Anna. I respect her a lot.\n\nI work for her and I have fun with her.\n\nAnd I almost like colors now. After meeting Anna.\n\nDressing in black, but almost loved colors.\n\n[chill music]\n\nI never met Gabrielle Chanel,\n\nbut I heard a lot from film and from Karl.\n\nSo I know she was a very free spirit with a tough character.\n\nAnd I think she will love someone like Amelia.\n\nI think it's very the essence of what Coco is herself.\n\nI feel amazing and beautiful and like a real Parisian.\n\n[Carine] After the success of the previous event.\n\nThis has to be even better. So we want it spectacular.\n\nWe want to be enjoyable.\n\nAnd cross fingers it's super not windy.\n\n[chill music]"
