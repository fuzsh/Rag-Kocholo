        "text": "Carine Roitfeld can now add another milestone to her list of accomplishments…\n\nKarl Lagerfeld and Carine Roitfeld have enjoyed years of each other’s company – almost becoming one of fashion’s most iconic duos of our time. The brilliant designer behind Chanel and his namesake label, along with the French stylist, editor and founder of CR Fashion Book, have previously joined forces on numerous projects including co-publishing a book, The Little Black Jacket.\n\nNevertheless, even though the iconic designer has sadly passed away earlier this year, Carine’s relationship with Karl will continue to grow.\n\nAlways sitting front row at King Karl’s shows, the French fashion figure has now been entrusted to continue the icon’s vision and legacy.\n\nCarine (who was just announced as the 2019 CFDA Founder’s Award honouree) has been named as the Style Advisor of the Karl Lagerfeld brand.\n\nSo, what does this mean?\n\nRoitfeld will bring her innovative fashion experience to the Karl Lagerfeld brand for the next three seasons where, in tandem with design director Hun Kim, will advance the brand’s collections into accessible-luxe pieces.\n\nIn a statement, Carine said: “I am blessed and thankful for having had the opportunity to work with Karl for so many years — we shared not only a professional relationship but a deep friendship. He will always be a legend, who redefined the notions of fashion, photography and celebrity. It is my honour to collaborate with his namesake brand as Style Advisor, carrying out his iconic vision for the upcoming three seasons.”\n\nWe can’t wait to see what Carine will bring to the label. Stay tuned!\n\nIn the meantime, browse through Chanel’s new capsule collection with Pharrell Williams."
