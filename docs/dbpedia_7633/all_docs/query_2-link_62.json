        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The string of media company layoffs continues. Hearst Television has let go of dozens of employees working for its streaming service Very Local, sources tell Deadline.\n\n“Hearst’s Very Local initiative will streamline its production to focus primarily on documentary and news-adjacent programming, formats we have seen resonate with streaming viewers,” a Hearst spokesperson said in a statement. “Unfortunately, this impacts the roles of some of our very talented colleagues, who have produced an impressive slate of award-winning programming. We are grateful for their service and contributions to this project. Hearst Television will continue to innovate in the streaming landscape, and we believe that this strategy is the right path forward for Very Local.”\n\nLaunched in 2021, Hearst Television’s free, add-supported streaming service Very Local offers 24-hour access to local news, weather and original series from Hearst and its local stations. Available in the 26 U.S. media markets the company operates in, it also provides access to Very Local original series on-demand.\n\nDade Hayes contributed to this report."
