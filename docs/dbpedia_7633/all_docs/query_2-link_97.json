I made a second payment , via Visa , which was not accounted for.\n\nMy 14 emails were ignored , customer service is horrible!\n\nThey dont read your request , but simply send you an automatic reply!\n\nAfter paying for 19 years a RED subscription, I am walking away!\n\nWho needs this kind of nonsense ?!\n\nIncompetence has reached an all time high in the UK HEARST office.\n\nRED.Shame on you!\n\nI ordered and paid for the Prevention Calendar, once, in 2022, for a christmas gift to a family member. Next thing I know, I get another Prevention Calendar in the mail sometime around 09/2023, that I definitely did not order.\n\nThe problem with this company is they are doing business under several different names. I tried to look up how to return the mess, couldn't locate an address or customer service email or phone number for Prevention Magazine. Can't even find an account number on any website that I set up where I can find proof of things I did or did not order. I was forwarded to Hearst media.\n\nTheir return policy is *** poor. States that customers have to pay postage to return merchandise they send you unsolicited. I finally put the package in the US post office box marker :Return To Sender-Not For this address.\n\nI am certainly not paying return postage for Hearst Media's foul up. Now they are harassing me by mail, threatening to ruin my credit if I don't pay for the book AND the price keeps going up every time I get one of these letters in the mail."
