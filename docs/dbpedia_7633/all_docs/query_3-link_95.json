        "text": "New York (April 30, 2013) – Cohen Media Group has acquired all U.S. release rights to MADEMOISELLE C., it was announced today by Chairman/CEO Charles S. Cohen. The film about former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief and French fashion stylist Carine Roitfeld, will be released theatrically in major U.S. markets in the Spring of 2014. Carine Roitfeld is the most renowned French fashion editor on the planet along with her opposite number at American Vogue, Anna Wintour. During her 10 years as editor-in-chief at Vogue Paris she was noted for her successes and scandals (“porno chic” was her creation). Last year, Roitfeld left Vogue Paris with the greatest challenge to date, create a new fashion magazine: CR. Having been granted unprecedented access, this documentary follows the making of a magazine from the first editorial meeting through to the extravagant launch party in New York. The filmmaker’s take on this subject is not to be too edgy but instead amusing and upbeat. Fashion, drama, power, models all circle around this most iconic of fashion editors, the most Parisian, the Eiffel Tower in 12 cm heels: the irreverent Mademoiselle C. Directed by journalist Fabien Constant, MADEMOISELLE C. also features interviews from Tom Ford, Karl Lagerfeld and Donatella Versace. The distribution agreement was negotiated by Charles Cohen and Gary Rubin, CMG Executive Vice President, and Adeline Fontan Tessaur, co-founder and International Sales Director of Paris-based sales and acquisition firm Elle Driver."
