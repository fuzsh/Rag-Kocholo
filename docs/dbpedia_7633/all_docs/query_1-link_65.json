        "text": "Carine Roitfeld released the first edition of CR Fashion Book titled Rebirth 11 years ago after her departure from Vogue Paris in 2011. Now, her latest book Fantasies hits bookstores in September.\n\nIn her new book Fantasies, Roitfeld spills the details on how she created CR Fashion Book out of a vision to reinvent fashion and capture style through words and photography. With a talent and interest in anything art from fashion, music, film, and more, Roitfeld explains how she set out to invent a multimedia platform to break the boundaries and rules of both the fashion and art world.\n\n“I am thrilled to unveil my second book with Rizzoli,” says Roitfeld. “While my book Irreverent was very much about my own work, Fantasies presents a unique body of work encapsulating the spirit and aesthetics of CR Fashion Book through the eyes of many photographers and fashion editors.”\n\nFantasies covers 10 years of content and celebrates the creative playground of cutting edge style that is CR Fashion Book. Roitfeld’s artistic vision allows readers to transport between time, text, and media while learning about intersectionality in topics ranging from celebrities, religion, sex, cinema, music, and more. The book is a must read for fashion lovers and anyone who loves art, design, beauty, pop culture, and more. Readers will be able to escape their everyday lives and enter the mind of the adventure that is CR Fashion Book when picking up and reading Fantasies. Readers will also find out how Roitfeld was able to spot stars like Lady Gaga, Zendaya, Kim Kardashian, and more before their rise to fame. The book includes work shot by top photographers from Sebastian Faena, Mario Sorrenti, to Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. “From the captivating visuals to the thought-provoking interviews CR Fashion Book has become renowned for, this book offers an immersive experience that celebrates the diverse facets of fashion, and I look forward to our audiences uncovering its pages,” says Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld, CEO of CR Fashion Book.\n\nDescribed as fearless and risqué, Fantasies will allow readers to learn more about the start up, both the editorial and creative process, and the overall journey of Roitfeld’s experience launching CR Fashion Book as well as maintaining its reputation and successful image. Find out what it takes to make it in the industry, and get a closer look at Roitfeld’s way of launching herself in the world through her work. The book’s cover image, lensed by Karl Lagerfeld with art direction by Riccardo Tisci, displays Kim Kardashian for CR Fashion Book Issue 3 offering a prelude to the collection of iconic images that compose the last decade of CR.\n\n“CR is never just about the looks or the models but the stories each editorial tells,” says Edouard Risselet, creative director of Fantasies. “And the most crazy and unexpected ideas always make up for the most brilliant and special images. Fantasies has been designed as a portrait of pop culture and its contemporary icons—some of which CR skyrocketed to stardom—through fashion.”\n\nFantasies: Carine Roitfeld Fashion Book will be available this September in stores and on rizzoli.com."
