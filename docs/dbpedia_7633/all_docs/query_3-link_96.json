        "meta_description": "The fashion world has been buzzing every since it learned that former Paris Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld was going to strike out on her own and create a brand-new magazine titled CR Fashion Book. Mademoiselle C, a documentary due out September 11, chronicles this epic journey. Watch the trailer below and then read on for my interview, which offers even more of a glimpse into the style icon's life. Glamour: What did you learn about yourself during this process? Carine Roitfeld: It's like therapy you know? First you hate yourself. You say, why that hair? Why that voice? And then after, when I watched without always examining the way I looked, I was very happy to see that I can transmit that everything is about the team. You're not on your own. You're doing things with other people. This was very important for me, and I hope other people see this in the documentary. Even during photo shoots, making the magazine, and even in your personal life, everything is about doing things together. It's not about me, me, me. In the documentary you can see it's not about star wars or big egos; it's level for everyone. It's refreshing after",
