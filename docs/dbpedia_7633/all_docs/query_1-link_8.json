        "text": "There are some people in fashion with such distinctive personal style trademarks that you can recognize them from their silhouettes. Karl Lagerfeld was one (remember the Diet Coke bottles?). Anna Wintour is another. And then, with her sky-high heels, narrow pencil skirts, shaggy bob and permanent presence on the front row of fashion week for more than 30 years, there is Carine Roitfeld.\n\nThe former French Vogue editor and stylist was a longtime collaborator with the likes of Mr. Lagerfeld and Tom Ford, as well as a principal architect of the hedonistic aesthetic that defined late 1990s fashion. After leaving French Vogue in 2011, she founded her own biannual publication, CR Fashion Book, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. The latest cover, released earlier this week, stars Kim Kardashian with razor-thin brows, a dirty white top and a buzz-cut wig, and was shot by Nadia Lee Cohen.\n\nLately Ms. Roitfeld has also been busy building a lifestyle empire, branching out into everything from perfumes to housewares as well as a new coffee-table book, “Fantasies,” published earlier this month by Rizzoli (with a cover also featuring Ms. Kardashian).\n\nShe now occasionally uses a cane, but after turning 69 earlier this month, Ms. Roitfeld also appears to show no signs of slowing down. At the end of Milan Fashion Week — and ahead of a big birthday bash in Paris on Sept. 27 — she sat down to discuss getting older, her hand in shaping the intersection of fashion and pop culture and why she has no regrets about going it alone."
