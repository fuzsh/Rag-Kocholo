        "text": "With celebrations in Hong Kong and Paris, the exhibition will present an extraordinary journey of fashion and craftmanship to the public\n\nHONG KONG, Oct. 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Savoir-Faire: The Mastery of Craft in Fashion, an exhibition opening at K11 Art & Cultural Centre in Hong Kong’s Victoria Dockside on December 13, will showcase the beauty and importance of preservation of craft from some of the most legendary houses and designers around the world. Presenting a highly curated collection of works of fashion and artisanship and born out of a mutual dedication to preserving craftsmanship, Savoir-Faire is the latest installment of an ongoing collaboration between Adrian Cheng and Carine Roitfeld. With works of haute couture and prêt-à-porter on display, Savoir Faire: The Mastery of Craft in Fashion will also highlight pieces of the next generation and rare artifacts from the K11 Craft & Guild Foundation.\n\nOrganized thematically and featuring a carefully curated selection by world-renowned fashion stylist and editor, Carine Roitfeld, the captivating exhibition will feature rare and masterful works from renowned design houses that include Balenciaga, Chanel, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Iris van Herpen, Loewe, Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford, and Valentino, and avant-garde designers such as Richard Quinn and Tom Van der Borght, along with one-of-a-kind pieces from Roitfeld’s private collection. Designed to be both visually and physically immersive, the exhibition will take its audience on a visual journey into the fantastical pages of Roitfeld’s iconic fashion editorials.\n\n\"Through the understanding of craftsmanship—the transmission of tradition, ideas, and techniques between societies and culture—fashion has been creating deeply collaborative relationships of connection and exchange,\" said Adrian Cheng, the cultural entrepreneur and Founder of K11 Craft & Guild Foundation. \"I am thrilled to be working with Carine to bring forth a potent illustration of the power in craft and artisanship so we may also collectively celebrate its innovation for the future. Together, we bring this unprecedented exhibition to Asia for the first time to rejuvenate the cultural landscape of Hong Kong.\"\n\n\"Throughout history, editors have used the pages of magazines as a canvas to bring to life fashion’s most extraordinary ideas and creations,\" said Carine Roitfeld, curator of Savoir-Faire. \"By harnessing an editorial approach to the storytelling and visual journey, this exhibition will showcase some of the most exemplary cases of craft in a way that, we hope, motivates a deep appreciation for the history and heart of fashion among the next generation. These young visitors are inspiring the future of our industry, and I hope that our work serves to spark their imagination, creativity, and commitment to keeping fashion’s most significant techniques alive.\"\n\nThe exhibition’s debut will be a global affair as Cheng and Roitfeld host two thoughtfully tailored celebrations from their home cities. On December 10, Roitfeld will host close friends and designers supporting the exhibition for an intimate reception at the historic Hôtel de Crillon, a Rosewood Hotel in Paris. Simultaneously, Cheng will host a special opening event, titled ‘K11 NIGHT,’ on Hong Kong’s iconic Victoria Dockside promenade. Connected via a virtual live stream, Cheng and Roitfeld will unify leading creatives from around the world for a cross-continent toast to craftsmanship, cultural exchange, and the official commencement of the exhibition. A charity auction will also be held at the opening event in Hong Kong. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to UNESCO and the K11 Craft & Guild Foundation to conserve and rejuvenate fast-disappearing craftsmanship.\n\nThe exhibition is a continuation of the ongoing partnership between Cheng and Roitfeld. Together, they launched K11 Original Masters last year, a three-part webinar series that brings forth leaders of modern artistry to showcase renowned century-old artisanship in a first-of-its-kind digital program designed for the social media era. The first two episodes featured conversations that Cheng and Roitfeld had with leaders from Chanel and Dior. The final installment will launch in November.\n\nProduced by CR Studios, Savoir-Faire: The Mastery of Craft in Fashion opens on December 13, 2021, and will be on view until February 14, 2022, at the K11 Art & Cultural Centre, located at K11 MUSEA. Attendees will have the opportunity to discover bespoke pieces and rare offerings that highlight legendary couture craftsmanship while getting the chance to observe, first-hand, the dedication and hours of input that each Maison requires each piece to carry on the time-honored heritage.\n\nMore information can be found on the exhibition’s website: www.k11musea.com/happenings.\n\nThe designer and couture houses participating in the exhibition includes Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Celine, Chanel, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Iris van Herpen, Jean Paul Gaultier, Loewe, Louis Vuitton, Matty Bovan, Mugler, Oscar de la Renta, Paco Rabanne, Richard Quinn, Saint Laurent, Tom Ford, Tom Van Der Borght, Valentino, Versace, and Viktor & Rolf.\n\nIMAGES HERE\n\nAbout Carine Roitfeld\n\nCarine Roitfeld is the founder and Director of CR, a media company founded in 2011 and now run by CEO Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld.
