        "text": "Jeannette Chang in 2007 joined the brand management team of CR Fashion Book in partnership with PubWorX, a joint venture between Hearst Magazines Digital Media and Condé Nast, to manage production and distribution services for CR Fashion Book in print and to host CRFashionBook.com on Hearst’s proprietary MediaOS platform. CR Fashion Book is a biannual publication from Harper’s BAZAAR global fashion director Carine Roitfeld, which she launched in 2012.\n\nMost recently, Chang was senior vice president and international publishing director of Hearst Magazines International (HMI), responsible for overseeing international advertising and marketing for 300+ editions of HMI’s magazine brands including Cosmopolitan, Harper’s BAZAAR, Esquire and Popular Mechanics. She was named to this position in March 2000, previously having served as vice president and publisher of Harper’s BAZAAR since August 1994, where she was the first female publisher since the publication launched in 1867, and associate publisher of that title since June 1984.\n\nChang joined Hearst Magazines in 1973 as an advertising sales representative for Cosmopolitan. In 1977, she was promoted to fashion advertising manager, and two years later moved to Harper’s BAZAAR as director of fashion marketing, until she was promoted to associate publisher.\n\nUnder Chang’s leadership, Harper’s BAZAAR US opened international advertising offices in Milan and Paris, with sales representatives in Munich and Tokyo. This foray into the international advertising arena paved the way to her positions with Hearst Magazines International, where she worked primarily toward marketing, promoting and supervising launches and re-launches of Harper’s BAZAAR, Esquire and Town & Country.\n\nChang is a frequent speaker before international trade and business groups involved in the fashion and publishing industries. In 1992, she was inducted into the YWCA Academy of Women Achievers. Chang is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Fashion Group International, the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), Pratt Institute and the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund (OCRF).\n\nA graduate of Hunter College in New York City, Chang earned her Bachelor of Science while launching her publishing career at Scholastic."
