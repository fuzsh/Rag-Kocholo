        "text": "Big haircuts take a lot of bottle. And usually, an experienced pair of hands. Unless you are the 68-year-old French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld, in which case you simply take a pair of scissors to your ponytail and, voilà.\n\n“It’s a very destroyed haircut,” she tells me, demonstrating how she then sliced into the ends to create a choppy effect. “Because, you know, I’m not a hairdresser.”\n\nRoitfeld may not be a professional hairstylist, but her result looks effortlessly cool. I can’t imagine Anna Wintour, her counterpart on American Vogue, doing anything of the sort to her famously impeccable bob.\n\nBut therein lies the appeal of Roitfeld, herself a fashion icon. Her personal brand of glamour is so desirable because it seems effortless.\n\nA world-renowned stylist and longtime collaborator with designers Tom Ford and the late Karl Lagerfeld, Roitfeld was the editor-in-chief of French Vogue from 2001 to 2011, before founding her own publication, CR Fashion Book.\n\nLife in her late 60s is as varied and stylish as ever: she consults for luxury giants including Dior and Chanel and collaborates on marketing projects with brands such as Grey Goose vodka. She sips a clear apple martini during our interview – it’s been her drink of choice since the 1990s when she watched someone throw a glass over Tom Ford’s white carpet at a party, and it remained spotless.\n\nRoitfeld largely wears head-to-toe black. Today it’s a tank top with a fur-lined hoodie, tailored trousers, sharp heels and a nonchalantly layered stack of Chanel necklaces. “I didn’t know what to wear,” she admits. “I thought I’ll be a bit like Coco Chanel. This is the first time I’m wearing so many Chanel [necklaces]. Karl gave them to me.”\n\nThrough her five-decade-long career, Roitfeld has become one of the fashion industry’s most recognisable figures and something of a poster woman for Parisian chic. Her look, she says, would be easy for anyone to replicate, but it is the styling flair she applies that makes it unique to her.\n\n“I’m very simple in my way of dressing,” she insists. “I wear mostly black, which is easy because black goes with everything. I’m very picky with my clothes. I’m very Virgo. Some things that do not exist I have made but they’re very simple.”\n\nShe designed a successful collection for Uniqlo in 2016, but says she has been too busy to consider founding her own fashion line. “I’m starting a bit on a fashion brand, but it’s very difficult,” she admits. “Maybe one day.”\n\nIt would be catnip for British women. So many of us are infatuated with the idea of French style: that je ne sais quoi; that innate sex appeal.\n\n“Getting out of bed to have a little coffee and a cigarette, naked under a trench coat? No, this is a French fantasy,” she says. “I remember shooting with [British makeup artist] Charlotte Tilbury for French Vogue and she was wearing a dress full of flowers. I said ‘You British are so fearless to wear all these prints. I will never do that.’”\n\nPerhaps some French women really are as intrigued by our style as we are with theirs. Roitfeld believes that French women could learn something from the British approach.\n\n“I think that you try more than we do in France,” she says. “You mix better than the French. Your biggest queen, after Elizabeth, was Vivienne Westwood. She was my queen too: I like the mixing of punk culture with a very classic, aristocratic [aesthetic]. This is very British. You have more freedom – you don’t care, in a good way.”\n\nRoitfeld has never pandered to trends, nor wavered at all from her signature look. She applies her makeup herself, always, smudging the kohl with her fingers. The effect looks so good that there’s demand for a Carine-branded eye makeup line, set to launch next year.\n\nBecoming a grandmother hasn’t changed Roitfeld at all. Her 42-year-old daughter Julia lives with 11-year-old daughter Romy and baby son George in London, while she is based in Paris, meaning she sees them regularly. Is she a hands-on granny? “I see them during the holidays, but I’m not a grandma-babysitter,” she says firmly.\n\nShe’s made no concessions to this role when it comes to her style – if anything, the rest of the family follows her lead. Last summer’s social media snaps showed the Restoin-Roitfelds on holiday in Cannes wearing matching black swimwear, while the three generations have also made red carpet appearances together, all wearing black evening dresses."
