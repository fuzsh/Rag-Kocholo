Carine Roitfeld’s CR Fashion Book has a new home. Hearst Magazines, which already employs Roitfeld as the global fashion director of Harper’s Bazaar, has stepped in to fill the void left when Roitfeld’s title split with Stephen Gan’s Fashion Media Group. In a release today, Hearst announced that it will publish and lead revenue generation for CRFashionBook.com, publishing the site on its digital platform. “I love working with the editors and executives at Hearst Magazines; I trust them and they trust me,” Roitfeld said in the statement.

The print version will also be getting a boost: Hearst has a joint venture with rival publisher Condé Nast called PubWorX, which will now be in charge of printing and producing the biannual issues. Condé’s involvement could be considered a tad ironic since, as anyone who’s watched the Roitfeld documentary Mademoiselle C can tell you, the company made efforts to block the editor from working with its talent when she launched CR after leaving French Vogue. But in today’s publishing world, strange bedfellows abound.
