CARINE ROITFELD is the new global fashion director of Harper's Bazaar international. The former editor of Vogue Paris will contribute several stories a year to all 26 international editions from the March 2013 issues.

Roitfeld will work alongside Stephen Gan, creative director of Harper's Bazaar US, in her new role and will have creative input on international magazine covers. Gan is a collaborator on CR Fashion Book, the biannual magazine recently launched by Roitfeld - which she will continue to work on.

"This collaboration marks the first time anything like this has been done and we're very excited about what Carine will bring to Bazaar editions around the world," Duncan Edwards, president and CEO of Hearst Magazines International, told Fashion Monitor.
