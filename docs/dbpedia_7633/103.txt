Carine Roitfeld is intensifying her relationship with Hearst Magazines. The Harper’s Bazaar global fashion director has looked to the company to publish and lead revenue for CRFashionBook.com, while PubWorX, Hearst’s joint venture with Condé Nast, will manage and oversee printing, production, and distribution for her biannual CR Fashion Book.

As part of the agreement, Hearst will monetize digital and social content and create custom programs for CRFashionBook.com. It will also provide audience amplification, editorial services, and syndication of CR Fashion Book digital content across the Hearst Magazines Digital Media portfolio, according to the release. Print ad sales will be overseen by CR Fashion Book’s publisher Jorge Garcia, while Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld has been appointed president of CR Fashion Book Ltd., the newly created company that will publish the magazine and produce all editorial content.
