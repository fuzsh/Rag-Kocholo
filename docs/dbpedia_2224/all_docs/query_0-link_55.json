        "text": "ETC's annual conference consistently receives rave reviews. Below is an archive from the last several years.\n\n“I’m looking forward to attending my third conference in February. The contacts I have made and experiences you’ve provided have been invaluable to our young company. Thank you!”—Gina Carmo, Director, Inspire Travel (Brazil)\n\n“Congratulations on a wonderful ETC 2010! I got so much work done. Having all my tour operators in one place, I completed my 2011 booking schedule (7 trips) and renewed old friendships!” —Betsy Stevenson, Coordinator of Foundation Travel, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts\n\n“Congratulations on putting on a fantastic conference this year. It had been a few years since I’d attended, and I’d forgotten what a special event it is. I felt like I got my money’s worth x 10.”—Matt Kareus, Director of Events and Special Projects, Global Explorers\n\n“One of the best conferences in ETC history. It was especially useful now with so many programs and the industry in general in transition. I’ve heard nothing but praise for the great interaction and gutsy topics.”—Roberta M. Moore, Former Director, Alumni Continuing Education & Travel Office of Alumni Relations at Dartmouth College\n\n“Another great conference. As usual it was very worthwhile for me.”—Linda S. Witt, Director, Sales/Client Relations, Educational Travel, USI Travel Insurance Services\n\n“The conference has given me a great couple of days to step out of the trenches, refocus, and get new ideas…meet new colleagues, talk about benchmarks. I got good numbers that I can take back, as we have new goals and benchmarks coming from our organization. Being able to have this is very helpful. I have about 20 pages of great ideas.”—Katie Maschman, Travel Programs Manager, National Parks Conservation Association\n\n“Congratulations on another very successful conference this year. ETC ’10 had a lot of great energy with strong interest in exploring ways to be more effective and to work smarter in this ‘post economic crisis.'”—Karen Kuttner-Capato, Vice President of Affinity & Charter Sales, Lindblad Expeditions\n\n“Thank you for allowing Carol Orsborn and me to be a part of this year’s ETC 2010 Conference. We loved it! We enjoyed ourselves and appreciated getting to talk about a subject we love (engaging Boomer women). We really felt welcomed by the warm, enthusiastic, and engaged ETC community. I’ve never seen a conference quite like ETC!”—Stephen Reily, Founder/CEO, VibrantNation.com\n\n“Thank you…for providing the opportunity for me to attend such a helpful and informative session for executive directors at ETC. I’ve been in alumni relations work for seven years now, but have never felt very knowledgeable about our travel program, and must admit it has not been given much of a priority among all our programs. That has now changed—I returned to Auburn feeling like I had a wealth of information and quite inspired (the travel staff were overjoyed!). We have a lot of work to do, but we’ll have fun growing our program to where it needs to be.”—Debbie L. Shaw, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Executive Director, Auburn Alumni Association, Auburn Alumni Center\n\n“Thanks to all of you who worked so hard to bring about another successful ETC conference. It was a great conference. Great speakers, good meeting space, and definitely lots of attention to detail. I’m sure most of us aren’t even half aware of all that you do to make this conference happen, but please know that it’s appreciated. It’s always one of the highlights of my year.”—Clark Oldroyd, Associate Director, University of Colorado at Boulder Alumni Association\n\n“Many thanks for the Mentor Meet and Greet session. I benefited a lot from my mentor’s experience and guidance. I would like ETC to know I am indebted for this arrangement. It was an excellent conference!”—Samuel Seyoum, CTC, Manager Marketing and Groups, Picasso Travel\n\n“Wanted to congratulate you on yet another successful ETC in Rhode Island. Overall the substance was solid! That’s what matters. I look forward to attending many more ETCs.”—Rumit Mehta, Founder, Immersion Journeys\n\n“I had a tremendous experience and learned so much about the industry. The conference was very well organized and offered a great range of subjects. Coming from an outside industry, the topics that focused on technology and social media will prove very valuable as the travel industry is evolving and meeting the needs of younger demographics. I found the presenters and attendees to be very approachable and friendly, especially your staff. I came away with a better appreciation of the educational travel industry.”\n\n—Barbara Anglisz, Adept Technologies, Inc.\n\n“It was a wonderful conference. I feel fortunate I was able to be there. Thank you for including me in your team of volunteers. I loved it!”—Cy Britt, former Director of Travel and Regional Programs at Wellesley College\n\n\"Thank you for another great conference! I am still sorting through all that I learned!” —Chase Poffenberger, Executive Vice President, Academic Travel Abroad, Inc.\n\n“Thank you for making it so easy for us to maximize our time and investment.” —Michael Chang, Instructor, New York University SCMP\n\n“I truly cannot imagine the industry being as strong and connected as it is without the ETC conference and community. Congratulations on your accomplishments of these last 25 years and thank you for your hard and challenging work.” —Pauline Ranieri, Director, UW Alumni Tours, University of Washington Alumni Association\n\n“If last year I was impressed, I must say this year’s ETC 2011 surpassed my expectations, it was excellent! And I can say such is the overall opinion. I always saw ETC as a great opportunity for a destination, and the best way to connect with the demands of a very specific market, to understand it, to become prepared.” —Mariano Proaño, General Manager, EXPLORECUADOR\n\n“Kris and Jojo came back from ETC with great information. They enjoyed the contacts with colleagues and tour operators, and we all feel it is an important venue for Cal Discoveries to attend and to contribute where we can.” —Jackie Olson, Director, Cal Discoveries Travel\n\n“Overall, another very successful conference-kudos to the entire, superb TLC team!” —Susan Lethbridge, Director of Business Development, Voyages to Antiquity\n\n“This was my fourth ETC, and I have come back energized with a bunch of ideas and plans for the future. My congratulations to you for conducting yet another successful conference that has brought together a broad cross section of people.” —Ravi Ramaswamy, Executive Director, Indebo (India)\n\n“Thanks to all who worked so hard to bring about another successful ETC conference. For the 25th anniversary, this was a really good conference—strong educational sessions and very well planned special events. The Community Dinner at the State Capital was a truly wonderful event. From the planning stage right up to the onsite problem solving and execution of the plan that took place, thank you for all that you did to make things run so smoothly. Great speakers, good meeting space, and definitely lots of attention to detail. As I said last year, ‘I’m sure most of us aren’t even half aware of all that you do to make this conference happen, but please know that it’s appreciated. It’s always one of the highlights of my year.’ Thank you and congratulations on another terrific conference.” —Clark Oldroyd, Associate Director, University of Colorado at Boulder Alumni Association\n\n“What an amazing conference! As I said before, there could not be a better forum to learn and share innovative ideas about best practices and achieving best results in the field of educational travel.” —Maria Gross, Consultant, Travel Sales and Marketing\n\n“ETC 2011 was an excellent conference with the Community Dinner the true highlight. The city of Providence certainly pulled together and pulled off an evening we will never forget. When I get to Providence again, I will be sure to visit some of the many restaurants that participated. Once again you put on a conference that was a benefit to all that attended. No other conference gives you the educational components in travel like this conference. Congratulations!” —Karen Anthony, Retired Director of Alumni Travel, University of Notre Dame Alumni Association\n\n“The conference was excellent, also very well organized with good staff. I thought so myself and heard many good comments from other attendees. The 25th anniversary theme was also carried out very well. The Bazaar was well organized, good space and good signage, and the set-up created more traffic. The coffee area in the middle, as last year, was good and created more opportunities to network and meet clients. The speed networking system is good, everybody doesn’t use it, but more people used it than last year and it definitely should be kept. The speakers were also very good and with topics in tune with the times. The Saturday morning social networking sessions were also well attended and Sree is highly appreciated. The Community Dinner at the State House was spectacular, well organized, good networking, and a venue that tied in with historic and traditional themes, and it was also interesting to see the venue.” —Kerstin Nordin, Marketing North America, Iceland Travel\n\n“Thank you for ETC. I’m thrilled to say that as a result of the relationships forged and fostered through ETC we’re finding success selling our Death Valley walking/hiking geology tour to the community. Our tour for the MIT Alumni Travel Program has already sold out, and we have other alumni groups interested in going in 2012. Our original client for this tour was Patrick Wagner at Smithsonian Journeys–we’re doing our fourth tour for them in March–anyway, he told me a few years ago that I needed to attend ETC and I’m so glad he did and I listened!” —Fred Ackerman, Chief Shepherding Officer, Black Sheep Adventures\n\n“January 2012 was my first ETC and I found it extremely informative with a comprehensive agenda, excellent speakers and relevant content. Well done!”—Cheryl Mell, Senior VP, Global Experiences/Conservation Ambassador, John G. Shedd Aquarium (Chicago)\n\n“ETC 2012 was my first ETC conference, and I really got a lot of great ideas and things to think about in the sessions. Great discussion and new ideas were formed out of them. I think the networking with others who have the same job you do is very valuable. The sessions are informative and give practical ideas you can take back to your organization and implement. Sometimes conferences just talk in general terms about how to improve an aspect of an organization but with the ETC conference I came away with actual ideas and steps I can immediately implement here in my organization.”—Lea Ann Quirk, Coordinator of Alumni Services, University of Oklahoma Alumni Association\n\n“The opportunities to meet and network with other planners is key to this event. It was wonderful to meet others who plan tours as I do. We had opportunities to discuss what is working, how to reach more travelers, etc. Hearing from guest speakers was a highlight. Each offered his or her perspective on different aspects affecting our industry, and their insight was very relevant to what we do.”—Susan Bowe, Travel Program Manager, William and Mary Alumni Association\n\n“The ETC educational sessions are high quality. The 1 1/2 hour concurrent session format allows for maximum learning and valuable Q&A.”—Elizabeth DeGaetano, Associate Director, American Museum of Natural History Expeditions\n\n“I expected ETC to be more of a trade show, but it was much deeper and it focused on relationships within the industry—not just for advancing economic gain, but more importantly to feel energized by the notion of the value of travel and what we do for a living.”—Elisabeth Hakim, UK and North American Markets Coordinator, PromPeru\n\n“This Conference is so important to me and has taught me so much. I have made great friends while attending ETC. They have become invaluable resources when I have a question.”—Shellie Andersen, Director of Alumni Travel and Student Programs, Iowa State Alumni Association\n\n“What a fabulous conference you all organized yet again. I came away with so much from just the one day I was able to attend. I think ETC is one of the most valuable conferences ever.”—Elaine Liles, Assistant Director, Alumni Programs, Rollins College\n\n“Thanks for another extraordinary conference! ETC 2012 had great energy, and you could feel it!”—Karen Kuttner-Dimitry, Vice President of Affinity & Charter Sales, Lindblad Expeditions\n\n“The maturation and evolution of ETC has been stunning. This is not true of a lot of conferences and communities. We care about making each other successful – we care about the community, our travelers and our mission. And that is what makes this community and conference unique. That’s why people like coming and enjoy the networking. It feels good but it is also productive.” —Steven Lembke, Vice President, Institutional Advancement, Road Scholar\n\n“I thought this year’s programs at ETC 2012 were great. I particularly value the sessions with Sree [Sreenivasan] and hope that he can return next year. He’s really the best!”—MaryBeth Mullen, Marketing Director, Smithsonian Journeys\n\n“I really enjoyed ETC this year, but I have every year! I very much enjoyed the Travel Planner sessions the first day.”—Lisa Valentine, Director, UA Alumni Travel, University of Arizona Alumni Association\n\n“I felt I made more connections with other travel planners [at ETC 2012], and this was likely due to the first travel planner day—which was a great aspect of the conference.”—Lisa Hill, Mgr of Travel & Special Programs, Santa Barbara Museum of Art\n\n“ETC 2012 was an enriching and fulfilling experience. This being my second year attending, I found it even more useful than last year. I am certain many people offer their thanks, so I want to add mine and let you know how much this conference and the entire ETC community helps me to improve the travel program at Utah State University. The entire conference was filled with useful and dynamic presentations that spark new ideas and destinations to explore.”—Scott Olson, Director Travel, Utah State University\n\n“I enjoyed ETC 2012 a lot. This was the best ETC for me in the past 20 years!”—Charlotte Xu, Executive Director, China Advocates\n\n2013\n\n“I have no idea how the ETC team pulls off an event like ETC. I have been in event management in the past and your operation is massive yet you pull it off with clockwork efficiency. So many concurrent events and speakers to manage, plus all the behind-the-scenes planning and logistics…you deserve a gold medal!!! And then some!”—Laurian Powers, Marketing & Business Development, Spirit of Africa\n\n“We want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the amazing conference you and your team put together. It was an amazing experience for us, and we know that the real work starts after the conference. I know that the Israeli companies felt it was a good event too. Looking forward to continuing our cooperation with ETC. Thanks again for everything!“—Shahar Alon, Director of Northeast (U.S.) Region, Israel Ministry of Tourism\n\n“Just a brief note to thank you once again for including me in the ETC conference this past weekend. I could not have been treated with more kindness or generosity, and I very much enjoyed my participation. The conference was extremely well organized and executed, and one cannot help but be impressed with the professionalism and the seriousness of purpose with which the participants approached each session. You clearly have a strong and production organization, for which I congratulate you.”—Laurent Boetsch (guest presenter), Professor of Romance Languages, Director, Center for International Education, Washington and Lee University\n\n“Thank you for all the time and hard work you put into this conference! Face time with colleagues and potential travel partners is so valuable.”—Lea Ann Quirk, Coordinator of Alumni Programs, University of Oklahoma Alumni Association\n\n“In some ways it’s one-stop shopping. Everything you need is here at the conference. It provides the opportunity to meet with several new possible travel operators and destinations, as well as time to meet with existing travel partners. Plus, it offers the professional development aspect that is tailored especially for this audience. It’s a nice package.”—Clark Oldroyd, Associate Director, University of Colorado Boulder Alumni Association\n\n“This was my 2nd ETC and it was good! As a relatively new professional in the field, I found the experience to be of great value. The highlights of this year’s conference were reconnecting with colleagues from across the country and learning the latest best practices.”—Daniel J. Stypa, Assistant Director of Alumni Affairs, Rice University\n\n“Most conference activites and meals are sponsored for planners, which is a great value, especially for programs with tight budgets. There is no other annual opportunity for planners to meet. I would absolutely recommend this conference to colleagues because the networking is invaluable.”—Aleksandra Matic, Associate Director, Member Travel, The Art Institute of Chicago\n\n“I have attended the ETC eight times now, and this was the best one yet! I particularly like that the sponsors of the meals were given a good chance to showcase their programs. With the bazaar time more focused, generally there were representatives at every table. I loved the cooking class with Chef Salvador; I now know how to make green tomato sauce. Excellent work. The key recommendations for this conference are the many contacts that are made for planning trips and the chance to compare programs and learn from colleagues at other institutions and experts in related fields.”—Amy Goerwitz, Director, Temple Travels, Temple University Alumni Association\n\n“Overall, we thought the conference was an excellent opportunity for us to connect with current clients as well as prospects. We were thrilled to see that every person who made a CONNECTS meeting appointment with us actually showed—that’s just unheard of at a conference!”—Evie Task, Manager, Communications, Meyer and Associates\n\n“Another great conference. Learned a TON and it was great to see all my ETC friends. Looking forward to next year already!”—Bobbi Collins, Director, Marketing & Business Operations, U. S. Naval Academy Alumni Association\n\n“Thank you for putting on such a great Educational Travel Conference again this year. I truly felt it was quite well-organized and flowed well. Congratulations!”—Jay Parker, Key Account Sales Manager, Avalon Waterways\n\n\"Thanks for hosting such a great ETC gathering.

The conference helps me to bring “the world” to our participants in new and creative ways. It also gives us all a sense of unity, healthy competition and an opportunity to develop lasting friendships in a fun environment. A marvelous chance to learn about all that is new and fascinating in the travel industry as well as making new connections and re-uniting with old friends. I look forward to many more conferences. It is the highlight of my working year!”\n\nElizabeth Bigwood, Director for Travel Program, Alumnae Association of Smith College\n\n“This is my 5th year attending ETC. Each year I take away not only a wealth of new information from the seminars, but also from the new people who I meet each year. ETC has been an important part of the growth of the Georgia Tech Alumni Travel program and my own growth as a travel planner.”\n\nMartin Ludwig, Director of Travel, Georgia Tech Alumni Association\n\n“One of my favorite aspects of ETC is that it is a complex, multi-layered experience. At its most basic level, it is a conference, and at this task it excels: replete with provocative guest speakers, the bustling bazaar, and exciting events/dinners. On another, deeper level, it is an annual gathering of friends and family, a magical international shin dig of epic proportions. And on the deepest level, it is a sound, productive, benevolent, year-round community, active in the most essential, meaningful ways, whether it be empathetic calls among competitors during crisis, who feel less competitive after so many years of meeting at ETC, or meticulously planned initiatives, small groups of us working together for sustainable development, leveraging tourism and our (largely ETC related) relationships for poverty alleviation, community development, and conservation.”\n\nAlicia Stevens, Director of Global Programs, Columbia University School of the Arts\n\n“The ETC Conference was extremely well organized and executed, and one cannot help but be impressed with the professionalism and the seriousness of purpose with which the participants approached each session. You clearly have a strong and productive organization, for which I congratulate you.”\n\nH. Laurent Boetsch (guest presenter), Professor of Romance Languages, Director, Center for International Education, Washington and Lee University\n\n“I have attended the ETC eight times now, and ETC 2013 was the best one yet! I particularly like that the sponsors of the meals were given a good chance to showcase their programs. With the International Bazaar time more focused, generally there were representatives at every table. The key recommendations for this conference are the many contacts that are made for planning trips and the chance to compare programs and learn from colleagues at other institutions and experts in related fields.”\n\nAmy Goerwitz, Director, Temple Travels, Temple University Alumni Association\n\n“Face time with colleagues and potential travel partners is so valuable.”\n\nLea Ann Quirk, Director of Alumni Programs, University of Oklahoma Alumni Association\n\n“This Conference is so important to me and has taught me so much. I have made great friends while attending ETC. They have become invaluable resources when I have a question.”\n\nShellie Andersen, Director of Alumni Travel and Student Programs, Iowa State University Alumni Association\n\n“I really enjoyed ETC this year, but I have every year!! I very much enjoyed the Travel Planner sessions the first day.”\n\nLisa Valentine, Director, UA Alumni Travel, University of Arizona Alumni Association\n\n“I thought this year’s programs at the ETC 2012 conference were great. I particularly value the sessions with Sree Sreenivasan, and hope that he continues to participate. He’s really the best! The buzz from other attendees who stayed for Sree’s session was very positive.” MaryBeth Mullen, Marketing Director, Smithsonian Journeys\n\n“The ETC conference was great, and I learned so much more practical information than last year. And part of that may have been that I was new to Vassar last year and to this aspect of tour planning. I had previously built tours myself for the Garden Conservancy for ten years.”\n\nSusan Quade, Associate Director of Alumnae/i Affairs, Vassar College\n\n“ETC 2012 sessions were most helpful and, at the social events, I made more connections than I had at the other two ETCs I’ve attended (Baltimore and New Orleans). Whether you are new to the field or an old-timer, there is always something to gain, and what you gain is both necessary and timely. I felt as if I had made more connections with other travel planners, and this was likely due to the first travel planner day—which was a great aspect of the conference.”\n\nLisa Hill, Travel & Special Programs Manager, Santa Barbara Museum of Art\n\n“I wanted to tell you what a fabulous conference you all organized yet again. I came away with so much from just the one day I was able to attend. I think ETC is one of the most valuable conferences offered.”\n\nElaine Liles, Associate Director of Alumni Programs, Rollins College Alumni Association\n\n“I really enjoyed the ETC 2012 conference, which was my first. I went to many of the programs and enjoyed most of them immensely. The conference allowed us to think of new ways to market our programs, and we met with many new vendors with whom we now hope to do business.”\n\nIngrid Bortner, Adjunct Faculty, Office of Travel Studies, The Community College of Baltimore County\n\n“As I travel home from Orlando, I cannot help but reflect on the ETC 2012 conference. The entire event was an enriching and fulfilling experience. This being my second year attending, I found it even more useful than last year. I am certain many people offer their thanks, so I want to add mine and let you know how much this conference and the entire ETC community help me to improve the travel program at Utah State University. The conference was filled with useful and dynamic presentations that spark new ideas and destinations to explore.”\n\nScott Olson, Director of Travel, Utah State University\n\n“I first attended the Educational Travel Conference in 2004. As the travel planner for the Alumnae Association of Smith College travel program, I find the conference helps me to stay energized when planning my program. The conference helps me to bring ‘the world’ to our participants in new and creative ways. It also gives us all a sense of unity, healthy competition and an opportunity to develop lasting friendships in a fun environment. A marvelous chance to learn about all that is new and fascinating in the travel industry as well as making new connections and re-uniting with old friends. I look forward to many more conferences. It is the highlight of my working year!”\n\nElizabeth Bigwood, Director of Travel, Office of Alumnae Relations, Alumnae Association of Smith College\n\n“At ETC I gain a broader sense of how affinity travel programs are faring in the marketplace.”\n\nKaren Ledwin, General Manager, Smithsonian Journeys\n\n“Excellent source of tour selection and management of information and best single resource for educational travel networking.”\n\nRobert Fure, Director of Special Programs, Washington & Lee University\n\n“Each year, though I should know better by now, I am surprised anew by the amount of information presented at the conference, and by the fact that it is attended by dozens of educational institutions offering travel programs. This conference is, every year, an incredible achievement. This is the only professional development conference I attend. It has everything I need in one place and is always presented by experts in whatever information I’m seeking – marketing, legal issues, travel trends, finding capable travel providers. This conference is INVALUABLE to me.”\n\nHeidi Quiram, Study Travel Director, Center for Lifelong Learning, St. Olaf College\n\n“These conferences are the most educational and beneficial ones I have attended in the field of alumni relations. It is wonderful how the information crosses lines to be used in other areas, i.e. all the cutting edge information on marketing, branding etc. can be applied elsewhere in the Association.”\n\nSusan Goodale, Director of Development, Student Affairs, UC Santa Barbara Alumni Association, and former Gaucho Getaways Coordinator.\n\n“This conference is the one place where we all come together, share ideas, learn what’s new, what’s working and what isn’t.”\n\nPhilip Lovejoy, Executive Director, Harvard Alumni Association\n\n“Having attended the Educational Travel Conference for most of my 17 years as a travel planner, I can honestly say that the Philadelphia Zoo’s travel program has grown and continues to function because of the knowledge I’ve gained through the outstanding program the ETC offers each year. It is a wonderful way for me to network with fellow Natural History Museum, Aquarium, Conservation Organization, and Zoo (NACZ) planners, as we all share and learn from each other and become friends at the same time. The ETC is the only professional development conference where I can find everything I need in one place. I discover what destinations are “hot” and “what’s not.” I am able to discuss legal issues and risk management situations, find capable tour operators, and learn how to better market my products.\"\n\n“My attendance at the ETC has been critical to the success of the Philadelphia Zoo’s travel program and also for AZAD’s (Association of Zoo and Aquarium Docents) for whom I plan several trips a year. I am credited with initiating the Zoo’s travel partnership program with other institutions, many of whom I have met at ETC, and for starting AZAD’s travel program. I couldn’t have accomplished any of this without attending the ETC. Thank you ETC for all that you have done, not only for me, but also for all the other like-minded colleagues in the world.”\n\nRoberta DeVries, Travel Planner/Trips and Program Manager, Philadelphia Zoo, and AZAD Travel Planner\n\n“Overall, the Conference was an excellent opportunity for us to connect with current clients as well as prospects. We were thrilled to see that every person who made a CONNECTS meeting appointment with us actually showed-that’s just unheard of at a conference!”\n\nEvie Task, Communications Manager, Meyer and Associates\n\n“To me ETC is a community of kindred minds, where we gather to share common ideas, address common challenges, and set common goals for success for all parties, enjoying the journey together on a win-win stage!”\n\nPhilip Mathews, Senior Associate, MIR Corporation\n\n“I enjoyed ETC 2012 a lot. This was the best ETC for me in the past 20 years!”\n\nCharlotte Xu, President, China Advocates\n\n“Travel, especially the kind of mindful travel done by nonprofits, is all about people. For a quarter century now, the Educational Travel Conference has been at the forefront of the thoughtful business of educational travel.”\n\nDennis Pinto, Managing Director, Micato Safaris\n\n“The Educational Travel Conference has been truly the ‘Superbowl conference’ of our industry. This annual affinity event has single handedly marked a time to regroup and reconnect with our colleagues and partners to brainstorm and strategize new marketing and programming ideas. It also has been a remarkable place to reinvigorate our passion and commitment to educational travel. We all come away from the ETC with a renewed sense of purpose, which is an extraordinary feat for any one conference!”\n\nKaren Kuttner-Dimitry, Vice President of Affinity & Charter Sales, Lindblad Expeditions\n\n“As goes the Real Estate mantra ‘location, location, location,’ to me the Educational Travel Conference has been and remains ‘community, community, community.’ A community of kindred minds, where we gather to share common ideas, address common challenges, and set common goals for success for all parties, enjoying the journey together on a win-win stage! Thanks to Mara for her vision and leadership!”\n\nPhilip Mathews, Senior Associate, MIR Corporation\n\n“My first memories of the Educational Travel Conference are of people. Each year, old friends and new are highlights. Next is educational content, especially some of the really great and inspirational talks. Third is industry accomplishments—the most notable to me being the real partnerships that have evolved among the various segments of the educational travel pipeline thanks to the Conference. All in all, my life has been positively impacted both professionally and personally because of the ETC. For this I thank Mara for her vision and conviction, the many hundreds of volunteers who make the Conference so great, the sponsors who make the Conference possible, and, most of all, the attendees, without whom there would be no Conference.”\n\nJoe Small, President, AHI TRAVEL\n\n“ETC is an extraordinary professional development network. The fact that the group was founded over 25 years ago and has grown from a simple networking and sharing conference for some 30 nonprofit travel programs to the huge network it is today is an accomplishment worth noting. Today our world includes all aspects of travel from suppliers to ministry of tourism departments to risk managers to inbound operators and, of course, the nonprofit travel programs themselves. Each year, this conference provides basic information for newcomers, while challenging and encouraging other programs to look at new directions and to craft innovative educational experiences we might never have imagined before. We are not merely visiting countries, but we are helping to define unique worlds. The learning that occurs here also spills over into many other avenues of our personal lives and enriches us all.”\n\nDiana Crew, Founder & Consultant, Real World Connections\n\n“After a career working with the National Park Service, I decided to venture into another phase of my life. My close friend, Susan Delgado, who was the Expedition Manager for National Wildlife Federation, suggested I look into attending the Educational Travel Conference. My first attendance was in Washington, D.C., which helped me solidify my decision of developing an environmental education travel company—Environmental Adventure Company. A complete newbie, my eyes and mind were opened to the sheer volume of information available to a novice of education travel. I have no doubt my conference attendance and willingness to ask questions and listen did more for me than stacks of books written on the subject. That was many years, and many conferences, ago. Personally, the value of attending the ETC is beyond measure. I look forward to many more years of interaction with the ETC family.”\n\nMichael Sanders, President/Founder, Environmental Adventure Company\n\n“I’ve been very privileged to have been associated with the Educational Travel Conference almost from the very beginning, as one of the first foreign tour operators to attend the Conference along with just a handful of others who ventured in the early days to the Double Tree Hotel.\"\n\n“After attending this Conference for the first time I began to share Mara’s vision of a global community of people who are passionate about promoting affinity and nonprofit educational travel. I have had the opportunity to see it grow and develop into what it is today—a large community spanning the globe of people working for something they passionately believe in. The yearly journey to the Conference has always been a place to hear inspirational and informative speakers and to share ideas with like-minded (for the most part) colleagues. I can only hope that the Conference continues to grow and develop in the future as it has in the past. Good work and congratulations on your first 25 years!” Nick Fritz, Managing Director, Protours, The Netherlands\n\n“First of all I wanted to thank all of you for the excellent job you do in putting on these Educational Travel Conferences. They are a superb forum to discuss the various aspects of educational travel. As a business manager I am amazed at how much you are able to accomplish, considering you have four different sets of clients with four distinctive sets of objectives for attending. I can’t imagine the headaches you get trying to keep us pleased. Keep up the good work.” Jim Kackley, General Manager, Thomson Family Adventures\n\n“The ETC is the only conference in the world for colleagues to share the cutting edge of educational travel in a friendly and collegial atmosphere. Those of us who have been attending for years look forward eagerly to learning about the issues concerning educational travel and about what everyone else is doing. There could not be a better forum to learn and to share innovative ideas about best practices and achieving best results in the field of educational travel. The ETC definitely is one of the most enriching professional development experiences I have had in the travel industry.\n\nMaria M. Gross, Consultant, Travel Sales and Marketing\n\n“It was a great experience and I am so glad I was finally able to attend. You do a wonderful job, the sessions I attended were worthwhile and I was finally able to meet some people with whom I’ve had a phone contact for many years. Thanks and I am looking forward to next year.”\n\nKathy Pratte, Vice President of Sales Administration, General Tours\n\n“This Conference provides a neutral meeting ground for all members of the educational travel community whether they are planners, destinations, operators or suppliers. The opportunity is there to expand your client base as well as your knowledge, and there is no better assembly of like-minded individuals and organizations to be found. The Conference has been and continues to be the one place where we see an entire group of old friends and meet new ones. We credit it with contributing greatly to our growth and success in our niche travel market. Attendees always leave with inspiration and an abundance of knowledge gained from speakers as well as their colleagues. The most valuable asset, in my opinion, is the sharing and mentoring that transpires during the sessions. There’s notably far more camaraderie than competition present. The Conference helps expand our awareness of responsible tourism and of how we can be an asset to our environment as educated travelers rather than continuing its destruction.”\n\nLinda Witt, Director of Client Relations/Educational Travel Community, USI Travel Insurance Services\n\n“On the 25th anniversary, I am honored to have been part of the Educational Travel Conference and Group Travel Community since 1995. My 15-year journey with the Educational Travel Community has been rewarding and provided me with invaluable educational, business, and networking opportunities: first, during my time with the Finnish Tourist Board, and then with my own company dealing with travel to Scandinavian countries. Mara DelliPriscoli, ETC’s group leader during this journey, has always provided inspiration, encouragement, and new sources of learning experiences. I see the ETC moving along into the future, always strong and staying abreast of new developments.” Kerstin E. Nordin, Marketing North America, Iceland Travel\n\n“The Educational Travel Community is a great organization that spans multiple borders: international, professional, and academic. It has brought me a wealth of information networks, and a sense of belonging to a much larger community. Ten years after being introduced to the ETC, and in a completely new phase of my career, I still find myself leaning on the networks and knowledge delivered over the years. The contacts have been invaluable to me and became building blocks to my present position. Through the ETC I have introduced a personal hero of mine to the Conference (Wade Davis), met some giants of the tourism world, and had conversations with some of the brightest and best our industry has to offer. Thanks ETC for 25 years of hard work, professionalism, and leadership!”\n\nPeter Swain, Director of Visitor Services, Cypress Hills District,Government of Alberta, Tourism Parks and Recreation\n\n“PromPeru has been privileged to actively participate in the Educational Travel Conference and to assemble with the top influential travel leaders in North America. Through this opportunity, our country has succeeded in hosting several participants for familiarization trips to view the exotic, experiential, and cultural tourism experiences that continue to provide a wealth of enlightening growth-occasions for visitors. We look forward to the continued growth of the ETC and the expansion of attendees. We are eager to continue our relationship with the ETC and deepen our connection with the educational travel market by ‘Opening Doors to Open Minds. The Educational Travel Conference is one of our most important events, not only to showcase our product but also to increase our knowledge and enrich ourselves.”\n\nElisabeth Hakim, UK & North American Markets Coordinator, PromPeru\n\n“PromPeru ha tenido el privilegio de participar activamente en la Educational Travel Conference relacionándose con los líderes de opinión en viajes más influyentes en Norte América. A través de esta oportunidad, nuestro país ha podido recibir a diferentes participantes de viajes de familiarización para conocer lo exótico y vivir experiencias de turismo cultural y vivencial que continúan ofreciendo oportunidades para el enriquecimiento de los visitantes. Esperamos que la ETC continúe creciendo y expandiendo su número de participantes para que podamos incrementar el alcance de nuestra nutrida oferta para el turismo educacional al viajero norteamericano. Estamos deseosos de continuar nuestra relación con la ETC y ahondar nuestra relación con el mercado turismo educacional ‘Abriendo Puertas para Abrir las Mentes. La Educational Travel Conference es uno de los eventos más importantes para nosotros, no sólo para mostrar nuestro producto sino para incrementar.”\n\nElisabeth Hakim, UK & North American Markets Coordinator, PromPeru\n\n“I value ETC and feel that it provides a great service for travel planners. The conference is always a highlight, and I continue to invite other museum travel planners to join me. The content at the conference is excellent and very beneficial.”\n\nBetsy Stevenson, Retired Coordinator of Foundation Travel, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts\n\n“ETC bonds planners, tour operators, suppliers, and destinations into a common pursuit of excellence in educational travel. Over many years, the conference has given all of us both a platform for expressing our various points of view and a venue for discussion. It has been extremely valuable to me personally and for my organization to be part of such an informative, thought-provoking, and lively annual gathering.”\n\nAmy Kotkin, Retired Director, Smithsonian Journeys\n\n“The professional benefits I’ve received from this Conference have been extremely rewarding to my institution, travel program, and me with each friendship to be treasured always.’ (Written March 30, 1989.) Going forward, may this remain true!”\n\nCarolyn Sheaff, Retired Director, Cal Alumni Association\n\n“Congratulations on the 25th anniversary of the Educational Travel Conference! The Tucson Museum of Art derived many benefits from its ETC membership and association with other nonprofit organizations. Exchanging ideas has been one of the motivating reasons to return to the conference year after year. Mara’s inspiration in developing Travel Learning Connections has been an incalculable benefit to all of the members of the Educational Travel Community.”\n\nJoyce Barkley, Retired Travel Director, Tucson Museum of Art\n\n“I really appreciate the opportunity to attend sessions that related to the latest trends and information about travel.”\n\nCarole Lynn, Retired Manager, Visitor Services and Travel Program, Mariners’ Museum\n\n“It was another great Conference. I simply can’t quantify how useful it is each year, how much better it helps me do my job. It has paid for itself many times over. One piece of information I picked up some years back has saved my program more than $5,000 each year since; another contact has led to a most efficient way for my program to offer emergency medical evacuation insurance to all our participants. And, beyond all the concrete benefits, it’s a week I always look forward to. It’s so good to see everyone, to have so many people to talk shop with. An entire industry owes a tremendous portion of its success over the past 25 years to the Conference.”\n\nRalph Janis, Director Emeritus, Cornell’s Adult University\n\n“There is a lot of opportunity to promote my company and plenty of time to talk about detailed things. The people who are attending these seminars are really serious.”\n\nGursed Bayasgalan, Former Manager, Mongolian Travel USA, Inc.\n\n“ETC provides an opportunity to meet with the key players in this market segment.”\n\nLou Macaluso, Former Director-U.S. Leisure Sales, Canadian Tourism Commission\n\n“Having attended the Educational Travel Conference since its inception over 24 years ago, it has been important to me in a number of ways: Participation in the ETC has given me a sense of belonging to a “profession.” It took a few years for family and friends to understand, much less appreciate, that I had a “serious” occupation as the director of the Stanford Alumni Association Travel/Study Program (which lasted 18 years incidentally!). The existence of the ETC gave credibility and respectability to my work as a professional travel planner in the nonprofit arena.\n\nThe quality of the ETC speakers, roundtables, cultural events, and social events enhanced my growth and development as a knowledgeable professional in the nonprofit travel industry.\n\nThe ETC provides a forum made up of hundreds of experienced travel professionals whose recognition of colleagues for outstanding work is rewarding and meaningful to the recipient.\n\nThe ETC has helped our profession develop and promote higher-standard business practices.\n\nThe ETC has helped promote and reward sustainable and responsible tourism.\n\nThe ETC has inspired educational travel to new and unusual destinations.\n\nOnce a year the ETC provides the opportunity to meet industry colleagues under a welcoming, stimulating, and dynamic tent. The Conference enables face-to-face communication with a splendid variety of intelligent and highly motivated people who have a common cause.\n\nThe Conference and its staff and participants have meant much to me!“\n\nPeter Voll (1943-2012)\n\nPeter Voll Associates (PVA), Tourism Development & Marketing\n\n“The maturation and evolution of ETC has been stunning. This is not true of a lot of conferences and communities. We care about making each other successful – we care about the community, our travelers and our mission. And that is what makes this community and conference unique. That’s why people like coming and enjoy the networking. It feels good but it is also productive.”\n\nSteve Lembke, VP Institutional Advancement, Road Scholar\n\n“In some ways it’s one-stop shopping. Everything you need is here at the conference. It provides the opportunity to meet with several new possible travel operators and destinations, as well as time to meet with existing travel partners. Plus, it offers the professional development aspect that is tailored especially for this audience. ”\n\nClark Oldroyd, Senior Program Manager, Alumni Travel, University of Colorado Boulder Alumni Association\n\n“A true learning experience….. ETC is the FAM trip for travel planners!!!” Laraine Hlatky, Associate Director, External Relations, University of Pittsburg Alumni Association\n\n“The ETC Executive Forum is a great opportunity to network and learn from trusted colleagues. It’s an efficient way to understand trends in the travel industry and speak openly about challenges and opportunities in the industry.”\n\nLen Contardo, Vice President of Alumni Outreach, Georgia Tech Alumni Association\n\n“I found ETC extremely informative …. a comprehensive agenda, excellent speakers and relevant content.”\n\nCheryl Mell, Sr. VP Global Field Experiences/Conservation Ambassador, John G. Shedd Aquarium\n\n“Thank you for all of the ETC Jumpstart materials and webinars. I had a GREAT meeting with a potential tour operator because of the new-found knowledge I have for the questions to ask from going through the manual and watching the webinars- in particular the marketing and nuts and bolts webinars.”\n\nSara Schumann, Executive Assistant, Alumni Relations, Boston University Development & Alumni Relations"
