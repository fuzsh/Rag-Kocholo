        "text": "In Alaska Native Resilience: Voices from World War II, Holly Miowak Guise draws on a wealth of oral histories and interviews with Indigenous elders to explore the multidimensional relationship between Alaska Natives and the US military during the Pacific War. The forced relocation and internment of Unangax̂ in 1942 proved a harbinger of Indigenous loss and suffering in World War II Alaska. Violence against Native women, assimilation and Jim Crow segregation, and discrimination against Native servicemen followed the colonial blueprint. Yet Alaska Native peoples took steps to restore equilibrium to their lives by resisting violence and disrupting attempts at US control.\n\nIn the Q&A below, Guise shares more about her process of researching and writing the book as well as how Alaska Native peoples altered the colonial structures imposed upon them by maintaining Indigenous spaces and asserting sovereignty over their homelands.\n\nAs part of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association conference, taking place in Bodø, Norway from June 6 to 8, we are pleased to offer NAISA members a 30% discount. Find Alaska Native Resilience and other new and notable books through our virtual booth and take advantage of the conference discount with promo code WNAISA24 at checkout through June 30, 2024.\n\nFirst, can you touch on your background and what led you to this study?\n\nI am enrolled Iñupiaq born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska. My family is from the village of Unalakleet. When I was growing up, I heard several stories from my grandparents about 1940s Alaska and assimilationist schools that punished my grandparents for speaking Iñupiat. I remember my grandpa Lowell Anagick talking about his time serving in the guerilla platoon known as the Alaska Territorial Guard with Muktuk Marston. I wanted to link these family histories to better understand the broader experiences of Alaska Natives during the war.\n\nCan you share a bit about your process for conducting and compiling the oral histories of Alaska Native elders and veterans that are included throughout the book?\n\nWhen I was an undergraduate majoring in Native American Studies at Stanford University, I began interviewing Alaska Native elders about racial segregation in the Alaska territory for my senior honors thesis. When I returned to oral histories as a graduate student at Yale University, I broadened the study. I wanted to better understand what was happening during the passage of the 1945 Alaska Equal Rights Act, which addressed racial segregation in Alaskan towns at businesses and public venues. This era included the Pacific War/World War II, Japan’s invasion of the Aleutian Islands, and settler colonial projects that developed alongside imperial US projects.\n\nOver the years, I have worked with several tribal organizations, including the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, the First Alaskans Institute, the Sealaska Heritage Institute, and the Fairbanks Native Association Elder Program, as well as several other senior centers and community-based organizations, including the Alaska Veteran’s Museum, for conducting oral histories. I found tremendous help from Alaskan community leaders, libraries, museums, and through word of mouth in the Alaska Native community. I try to name every person and organization in a timeline of my oral history research travels in the appendix. Some of my favorite interviews are ones that I conducted with elders and their descendants. Oral history is indeed family history and academic.\n\nWhat are some instances of separation, exclusion, and segregation in Alaska that readers might be surprised to learn?\n\nIn listening to elders, including my own grandparents, it seemed unfathomable that Western government, missionaries, and powers tried to assimilate Native children, an incredibly vulnerable population, all while social exclusion existed in Alaskan towns where white residents sought to establish settlements in the post Gold Rush era. How could Native children be forced to abandon their Native languages and assimilate to Westernization when Western society excluded and separated Native people?\n\nReaders might also find it interesting to learn that in certain regions of Alaska, for example in the southeast, WWII–era military ordinances sought to separate Native women from servicemen to prevent interracial dating, sex, and marriage. Unsurprisingly, Tlingit activists mobilized through the Alaska Native Brotherhood and the Alaska Native Sisterhood, writing letters to government officials and military leaders to end stigmatization directed at Native women as venereal. As oral histories show, in some cases Native women defied the ordinances by simply dating and marrying servicemen anyway.\n\nYou write about what you call “equilibrium restoration.” Can you elaborate on this concept and share an example from the book?\n\nIt is probably common for writers to be unable to sleep, or to think deeply in the middle of the night. One such night, I thought about Alice Petrivelli’s story about her uncle banishing the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) doctor, H.O.K. Bauer, who brought physical harm, death by neglecting a patient, and sexual violence to the Atkan wartime relocation camp in southeast Alaska. I thought about the action of her uncle banishing the doctor, essentially expelling federal “aid,” and I realized he was trying to restore equilibrium for their people.\n\nConceptually, I found “equilibrium restoration” in a variety of settings where Alaska Native people resisted, expelled, and sometimes even appropriated or adopted colonial structures to maintain indigenization. As colonialism seeks to unravel Indigenous peoples and nations including through land removal, relocation, and boarding school separations, the act of Indigenous peoples restoring equilibrium goes directly against a colonial structure. Throughout the book, I try to show different ways that Alaska Natives restored equilibrium, sometimes through tribal mutual aid from Tlingit to relocated Unangax̂ during the war, which counteracted US colonial structures.\n\nFor Alice’s uncle, equilibrium restoration could be suddenly achieved in banishing the BIA physician. For others, like elder Nick Alokli from Kodiak, equilibrium restoration took his lifetime. The Western school teachers punished Nick as a child by slapping him with the straps from hip boots for speaking Sugpiaq, and yet, as an elder he returned to Sugpiaq by teaching it to the future generation of youth. He participated in the project of restoring his Indigenous language that colonialism sought to annihilate.\n\nHow has this colonial history manifested in Alaska Native communities today?\n\nThis is both an easy and hard question to answer. For those impacted by colonialism— through language theft, removal, family separations, sexual violence, and more—these dark histories impact individuals, families, communities, tribal nations, and the intricacies of daily life. These darker colonial histories can be felt, carried, and—I am going to be a bit more hopeful here and say—expelled over one’s lifetime or generations. Native people continue to try to unravel the harm of colonialism while reinstating their Indigenized nations, spaces, and livelihoods.\n\nWhat do you hope readers take away from your book?\n\nMy main goal for this book is to center the voices, stories, and reflections of Alaska Native elders who witnessed settler colonialism alongside militarization during World War II. Elders shared an array of experiences depending on their tribal geography, gender, and their age at the time of war. I find it profound that so many elders (more than 90 from this study) challenged settler colonialism and discrimination and navigated the war all while clinging to their Indigenous identities and sovereignty. I tried to highlight background information about each elder quoted in the book so readers can better understand Indigenous perspectives. I wish readers will see how much care goes into oral history in building relationships with elders over time and connecting elders through resources by academic institutions as well as tribal and community-based organizations.\n\nHolly Miowak Guise (Iñupiaq) is assistant professor of history at the University of New Mexico.

More than just a mode of transportation, the bicycle has been used by generations of Seattleites as a tool for social change. In Biking Uphill in the Rain, Seattle Bike Blog founder Tom Fucoloro tells the story of the rise of an improbable bike culture in this notoriously hilly and rainy city.

As Seattle would see again in the 2008 recession, people seeking ways to save money in difficult economic times found that and much more in the humble bicycle. The seeds of Seattle’s 1970s bicycle movement had been planted in the previous decades. Bicycle sales grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s as lighter bikes with multiple gears and easy-to-use gear shifters and derailleurs became more widely available at the consumer level. By 1968, a new kind of bike-riding movement was forming, empowering advocates to push for bike-friendly changes to the city.\n\nThe moment that propelled bicycling into the civic spotlight was the brainchild of a woman who didn’t even ride a bike. It rained all day November 16, 1967, which is to say that it was a very typical Seattle evening when Mia Mann walked into the regular meeting of the Seattle Board of Park Commissioners with a simple idea that would change her city forever. Mann was active on city and nonprofit boards, especially in support of city beautification and arts efforts.\n\nMia decided to push an idea being tried out in her hometown of Minneapolis: a car-free streets event. She wrote a Seattle City Council resolution to create such an event, but her idea met resistance from those in charge. First, the Parks Department tried to ignore her, but she would have none of that. Then the Parks superintendent said they couldn’t do it because it would interfere with vehicle traffic and because the Parks Department didn’t have jurisdiction to close streets. Eventually, Mia got a powerful City Council member named Myrtle Edwards involved. Edwards was responsible for major parks efforts, including the city’s acquisition of a closing gas plant at the north end of Lake Union that would one day become Gas Works Park. Edwards ran with Mia’s open streets idea, gathering council support and convening multiple city departments to make it happen. Her support was more than enough to win approval from the Parks board that rainy evening. They agreed to hold one trial event in the spring just to see how it would go.\n\nThe plan was simple: put up signs closing a two-mile stretch of Lake Washington Boulevard to cars starting at Seward Park in South Seattle and heading north. They then invited people to bike freely on the boulevard and on the forested roads through Seward Park without fear of cars. The whole thing cost the city less than five hundred dollars, and Mia Mann, Harry Coe of the League of American Wheelmen (now known as the League of American Bicyclists), and coaches from Rainier Beach Cottage School volunteered to carry out much of the organizing and promotion. “People have to get hold of their lives and get out in the open,” Mia told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer before the first Bicycle Sunday event. “The automobile just isn’t doing this for us. I haven’t ridden a bike in years, but I’ll be out there.”\n\nNobody, it seems from news reports, expected the number of people who showed up April 28, 1968. An estimated five thousand people brought their bikes to Lake Washington during the seven hours the road was closed to cars. City leaders clamored to show their support for the popular event and call for more. Soon the city was hosting Bicycle Sundays several times a month in locations across the city. More than half a century later, the Parks Department still hosts Bicycle Sunday on the same stretch of Lake Washington Boulevard.\n\nBut Bicycle Sunday did more than just create a fun space for a few hours. The simple act of kicking cars off a street for a few hours demonstrated to people the benefits of public spaces without cars. Cars require an enormous amount of space, and by the late 1960s nearly all street space had long been the domain of car travel and storage. In the city’s deeply entrenched car culture, getting out on a bike on a car-free street could be a radical experience.\n\nThe start of Bicycle Sunday in 1968 was something of a coming-out party for Seattle’s growing bicycle revival. Politicians saw that many people were deeply interested in biking; people with bikes realized they should use their numbers to get organized and start asking for better conditions for biking; and people who didn’t bike saw the crowds and thought it looked like fun. Within weeks of the first event, Harry Coe was rallying political support for a citywide bike route network. Signed bike routes were a small step, but they could be done quickly and represented perhaps the first time since the turn of the twentieth century that the city’s Department of Engineering was tasked with thinking about how someone on a bike might get around town.\n\nCoe was a runner for Team USA during the 1908 London Olympics and had biked all over Seattle as a child. “You could ride downtown without much competition from automobiles,” he told the Seattle Times in 1968. Coe also wrote a letter to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer around the same time saying that the first Bicycle Sunday reminded him of those early days. “It was a day which will be long remembered as one of Seattle’s finest for a lot of people who too seldom get together at one place to enjoy something which they all have in common, namely, love of bicycle riding,” he wrote. He was eighty-three in 1968 when the city started putting up his long-sought bike-route signs. The sheer number of bicyclists who participated in the first Bicycle Sunday gave the plan the popular push it needed to win approval. Signs started going up within months of the first event, and fifty miles of signed bike routes were installed across the city in the first year. Some of these green signs are still in place, bearing a pictogram of a bicycle and reading simply “Bike Route.”\n\nTom Fucoloro will discuss Biking Uphill in the Rain at the Edmonds Public Library on May 29 at 6:00 pm in partnership with North Sound Bicycle Advocates.\n\nTom Fucoloro is founder of Seattle Bike Blog and has served as its editor since 2010. He was named one of “15 People Who Should Really Run Seattle” by Seattle Met magazine.

A walk around town confirmed that Hanover was a fraction of the size of Missoula. Where Hanover ended, Dartmouth College began. Its buildings bordered a long, open expanse called “the Green” that had been part of the school for more than 150 years. It was a small, all-male college in an isolated town. The winters were sure to be long, cold, and dark.\n\nA notation in his high school yearbook shows Norman had listed as his college choice Washington and Jefferson, a small liberal arts college south of Pittsburgh founded by Presbyterian missionaries in the late 1700s. But he changed his plans. Norman told me Harvard had accepted him and that he thought about going, but he eventually decided not to, a decision his father seconded. Norman chose Dartmouth, he told his interviewers, because it was “the only outdoor college in the country,” and he assumed the woodsy setting would remind him of Montana. All too soon, he learned he was wrong. In Missoula, which sits at the confluence of five valleys, he had been able to see mountains wherever he went. In Hanover, elms and maples hid the vista. The White Mountains were far away. Most of his father’s family was in Boston, more than an hour south on the train.\n\nAt Dartmouth in the 1920s, the majority of students were privileged, white, wealthy young New Englanders. Some of their fathers and grandfathers had attended Dartmouth. They knew little about the Rocky Mountains and less about Montana, other than childhood tales about George Armstrong Custer and history lessons on Lewis and Clark’s expedition. Norman felt they looked down on him because his family wasn’t rich. I later learned that the clubby atmosphere had choked Norman, who told his friend Gwin Kolb that he felt “like an uncouth kid from Montana.” While many of his classmates were learning to sail and play polo, Norman had been fighting forest fires and leading pack mules in the Bitterroot Mountains. And though he spoke and wrote well, he was constantly having to explain himself, his hometown, his lineage, and his reasons for coming to Dartmouth. Doing so had exasperated him.\n\nEven in his later years, Norman failed to resolve his antagonistic attitude toward the affluent. “He had a hatred of big money in the abstract,” said his son-in-law, Joel Snyder. “He could be very difficult, but at the same time, he could be very gracious with wealthy people.” [His wife] Jessie’s attitudes were clearer. She had been a fan of the International Workers of the World, the radical Wobblies, and she later became and remained, like Norman, an unreconstructed Roosevelt Democrat.\n\nThe most memorable figure in college for Norman was former Dartmouth student Robert Frost, then in his late forties. The poet was an occasional teacher at the college and had a free hand in instructing his students. Norman said Frost “talked straight to you, and often poetry was there, or something close to it.” Classes met once a week, in the evening, in a “great big basement room with a wonderful fireplace.” The subject was creative writing, but Frost apparently never bothered to read his students’ papers. Instead, he would pace back and forth in front of the class, talking and talking. There were never any questions in Frost’s classes, Norman said, and “nobody ever stopped him.”\n\nNorman studied hard, later claiming he read a book a day, but he realized he would have to suppress his sardonic sense of humor in class. He became a C student—an accomplishment, given his meager high school education and his many extracurricular activities. He found ways to thrive outside the classroom. He joined Beta Theta Pi and promptly began relieving his fraternity brothers of their money around the poker table. A friend visiting from Montana was astounded that the college boys “didn’t know not to draw from an inside straight.” In a local gym, Norman boxed with fraternity members and men from the community and enjoyed knocking down opponents. He became a staff member of the Dartmouth Bema, a literary magazine, and the Aegis, the Dartmouth yearbook. He was selected for Sphinx, the oldest of Dartmouth’s many secret societies. He was on the board of governors for The Arts, “a clearing house for the ideas and opinions of those interested in the fields of literature, drama and music.” Among the writers coming to campus during his senior year were journalist and critic Rebecca West and poet Edna St. Vincent Millay. How he felt about meeting and hearing these women, we don’t know, but I do know he liked Millay’s poetry.\n\nBefore Norman graduated, in June 1924, Dartmouth English professor David Lambuth asked if he wanted to return to campus and teach freshman composition. Lambuth had had Norman in a few of his classes and was impressed with his writing ability and his sensitivity to language. Norman accepted the offer, telling an interviewer the class “was full of some poker buddies of mine, and I figured it would be a good way to pay back some debts.”\n\nNorman went home to Montana to work for the US Forest Service, gathering some of the experiences he would later turn into stories. He had spent most summers working for the Forest Service, except for part of 1921, when his father [Reverend Maclean], [brother] Paul, and he worked on a log cabin on the shore of Seeley Lake, on land leased to them by the federal government. Norman returned to the halls of Hanover in the autumn of 1924 as an instructor of introductory English, and his brother went with him to start on his Dartmouth degree. The Reverend couldn’t afford to pay for two sons to attend private school at the same time, so Paul had taken classes at Montana State (later renamed the University of Montana) in Missoula for a year before heading east.\n\nBravig Imbs, one of Norman’s contemporaries, offers a glimpse of some events in Norman’s life while he was an instructor, in The Professor’s Wife. The professor and the wife are based on Lambuth and his wife, Myrtle. Imbs worked as a butler for the Lambuths, which gave him a bird’s-eye view of their lives. Norman makes an appearance in the book as the character Douglas MacNeil, “an exceptional person” with a sensitive and crooked smile, who comes to write in the couple’s study. The David Lambuth character says Douglas’s poetry “had the streak of genius” and that a novel he was working on was the best poetic prose he had read.\n\nIn addition to his own writing, Norman was busy teaching undergraduates how to construct sentences. He told the story of an “observer” visiting his class one session, a redheaded Scotch atheist he admired, Professor James Dow McCallum, whose lectures on Victorian writers were very popular. Weeks passed with no feedback. Norman at last went to McCallum’s office. The professor was surprised to see him. Norman asked McCallum how to improve his teaching, and McCallum told him to wear a different suit every day of the week. When Norman said he couldn’t afford so many suits, McCallum suggested he wear a different necktie. He followed this advice through his long teaching career at Chicago.\n\nFor Norman, the occasional amusement provided by his struggling students—one wrote that the primeval forest was “where the hand of man had never set foot”—failed to compensate for Dartmouth’s caste system. Maybe he was struggling with his own writing or tiring of the décor in Mrs. Lambuth’s study. The problems Norman had faced as an undergraduate now only worsened. The stratified society of the English department, in which instructors were socially segregated from tenured professors, added to the sense of moneyed clubbiness and made a lonely Montanan long for the West. Norman’s brother, Paul, had already gone home to Montana, skipping the 1926 spring semester.\n\nNorman squirmed in the dinner jacket he was required to wear to departmental functions. Even the everyday clothes worn by the students set Norman on edge: the pullover sweaters and black-and-white saddle shoes of Joe College.\n\nIn June 1926, after two years as an instructor, Norman rode the train out of Hanover to Missoula and back to a job in the woods. In the fall, as the time came to return to New Hampshire, his father helped him realize he wasn’t bettering himself by teaching at Dartmouth. Alone, Paul boarded the train, heading east. Norman wrote to Professor Lambuth, telling him that he wasn’t coming back and asking if someone else could take his classes. He didn’t return to Hanover for decades.\n\nHe never wore a tuxedo again.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFreelance writer, editor, and poet Rebecca McCarthy spent twenty-one years as an award-winning reporter at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and has written for the New York Times, Fast Company, the Bitter Southerner, and the American Scholar, among other publications.

Richly illustrated and accessibly written, the book transforms readers into nearshore detectives, with each species offering unique clues about the environment around them.\n\nWhat inspired you to write this book?\n\nRyan P. Kelly: This book was a long time coming. I was sitting in California—in 2011, before I moved to Seattle and UW—and drafted the original sketch. The idea was to do a roadside guide to ecology, focusing on the intertidal, aimed at a curious, outgoing public. Terrie, John, and I are all originally from California, and we asked Pat to be a part of this book both because of his deep knowledge and because he’s actually in place there in Southern California, while the rest of us live in Seattle.\n\nJohn J. Meyer: For me, it was an opportunity to pay homage of sorts to the place and coastline I love the most. The West Coast is truly spectacular—all of it—but the beaches and tidepools of California are where I fell in love with the ocean in the first place.\n\nPatrick J. Krug: It’s a lucky few of us who have been able to live immersed, literally and figuratively, in the study of marine biology. Not much beats the fun of sharing everything you’ve seen, read, and been taught over a lifetime with other people who like to explore and learn about the ocean.\n\nAs research scientists, why write a book for the broader public? Did you perceive a specific need?\n\nRPK: It just seemed like ecology deserved the kind of treatment that geology has gotten in the Roadside Guide to Ecology series. There are lots of guides to shells and seashore creatures, but it seemed like nothing explained why a thing was here and not elsewhere. The why seemed important to explain to a broader audience.\n\nJJM: As a researcher turned policy specialist turned communications professional, I have seen firsthand the importance of making science broadly accessible to all people. If we can help do that for our oceans, I am all for it.\n\nPJK: Right now there’s so much curiosity and appreciation for the ocean paired with concern about how to protect our coast from escalating human impacts. It felt like the right time to talk about the shoreline we love in accessible terms to anyone looking to explore, learn, and be inspired.\n\nIn writing this book did you learn new things that differ from your day-to-day research activities? If so, what?\n\nRPK: I loved getting the chance to look up facts and distinguish them from scientific lore and rumor. We all learned a ton. And as my day-to-day work has pulled me away from the intertidal, this was a great opportunity to reimmerse myself in some real-world ecology.\n\nTK: I learned a great deal from my coauthors, whose specializations are somewhat different from mine. For instance, who knew that gumboot chitons have magnetite in their teeth? Or that hermit crabs can be extremely picky in choosing a new shell to inhabit?\n\nPJK: I spent a lot more time thinking about places instead of species. I do a lot of biodiversity discovery work, finding and naming new species, so I’m often thinking: what is special and different about this organism, what sets it apart from every other form of life? But for this book, we wanted to give the character of places—what do you find on this beach, and why is it here? It was a different challenge to capture in photos and words the feel of each rocky point or sandy cove that we profiled along the Golden State’s epic coast.\n\nMany Californians are familiar with Ed Ricketts’s Between Pacific Tides published in 1939. Is there any connection between your book and his?\n\nRPK: Those are very, very big shoes to fill, and I wouldn’t say we were aiming to fill them at all. Inevitably our book does have thematic overlap with Ricketts, but he was setting out the language of intertidal ecology for what was probably the first time for a relatively popular audience. That book is pretty dense with detail; we have tried to stick to a more narrative style and to focus on geographic patterns that visitors are likely to notice in a day at the shore.\n\nTK: Between Pacific Tides was formative for all four of us—you might say that as students we were weaned on that book. I’ve been carting around a copy for almost fifty years, and I still use it. But we did not set out to replicate it—that would be impossible.\n\nHow did you approach the main themes of the book and bring them to life?\n\nRPK: It’s easy to write about things you love and find fascinating. I’d say we just tried to convey that enthusiasm—I hope it worked.\n\nJJM: This book is filled with photos of ocean and tidepool habitats, which was intentional; you can read and see the magic of the California coast. I hope they help transport the reader to these special places and that readers then become inspired to go see them in person!\n\nPJK: When people see me working in the intertidal and ask what I’m doing, it only takes a few minutes to show them how to find animals they’ve never seen before. I wanted the book to be like having four marine biologists in your pocket, pointing out sea creatures you may have overlooked your whole life, to tell you about their hidden world, their challenges, and the incredible adaptations that let them thrive in the unforgiving world of the intertidal zone.\n\nIs there a location in the book that is your favorite? What about that location makes it special?\n\nTK: Hands down, my favorite is Partington Cove on the Big Sur coast. It’s a truly magical spot.\n\nJJM: Terrie turned me on to Partington Cove too, which was new for me and now ranks among my favorites. But the intertidal on the Stornetta Lands in Mendocino County I think is my favorite; the diversity of micro-habitats is immense, which leads to lots of diversity in the organisms that live there. And the rugged coastline as a backdrop only makes it that much more special!\n\nPJK: I wanted to find the outrageously neon pink sea slug, Hopkins Rose, so I went back to the same rock channel in La Jolla, San Diego where I first found this species thirty years ago. And they were right where I left them in my early twenties, same exact spot. A great puzzle in marine ecology is how rare species persist in one place in a dynamic, turbulent ocean. This was a wonderful illustration of that mystery for me.\n\nEveryone has a favorite species or two. Which species in the book are your favorites, and why?\n\nTK: It’s hard to beat giant kelp (Macrocystic pyrifera) for sheer majesty—but giant kelp is not an intertidal species. In the intertidal, I might vote for the kelp Lessoniopsis littoralis. Its common name—flat pom-pom kelp—does it no justice. This kelp lives in only the gnarliest wave-swept spots and can survive for many years. Its thick stipe is reminiscent of a tree trunk, helping it tolerate the onslaught of waves where few other organisms can persist. To me, it’s the oak tree of the intertidal.\n\nJJM: Almost impossible to pick, but I’ll go with the Spanish shawl. It’s such a crowd-pleaser, fairly common, and simply stunning to see with its bright purple body and orange mane against the greens and browns of a tidepool.\n\nPJK: I always hunt for two elusive species of limpet (small snails) that can usually be found, with some effort, by their special “home turf.” One lives only on the feather-boa kelp, blending in with its glossy brown shell. Its relative glides up and down the narrow blades of surfgrass, like a dime cut in half. Both are marvelously adapted to their different hosts, and the kelp and grass benefit from the pruning and cleaning activities of their little shelled gardeners. There’s something special to me about knowing you can always go back and find your old friends waiting right where you left them if you know their haunts—not too different from people.\n\nWhat are the most important messages conveyed in the book? What do you hope that readers will gain?\n\nRPK: Once you start to notice a thing in the world, once it appears on your mental map, you’re likely to start to care about it. That was a core goal here: help others see what we see when we visit the coast, with the likely outcome that others will start to feel about these places the way that we feel about them.\n\nTK: The California coast is magical for so many reasons. But some of that magic can get lost amid its crushing popularity. We wanted to capture some of the beauty and intrigue that can still be found along this coast. It is an absolutely stunning place.\n\nJJM: There are still wild, thriving places, even in the most populous state in the union. Of course, that’s because all the right natural ingredients are there, but it’s also because of the choices people have made. Californians place a high value on their coast, and as such protect it and care for it in many awesome ways. It’s great to see that investment pay off—many special places remain and are there for all to experience.\n\nPJK: To me, the book is about why each beach and bluff in California has a unique vibe and look. The chapters should help readers find new places to explore, and unpack the backstory of the marine life, rock formations, dune plants, and birds a visitor might see on a given outing. My experience is that the more people learn about the ocean, the more they are inspired to protect it, so I hope that a deeper understanding of California’s coast will bring readers a passion for conservation—and more fun on every trip to the beach.\n\nHow does this book differ from field guides, textbooks, or other books on intertidal communities?\n\nRPK: My bookshelf is full of similar books. Did the world need another one? We thought yes, because we were filling an unfilled niche. The book is about why rather than about what: why some things live here and not there, and how a person can learn to read a beach and glean meaning from the patterns of life on the shore. We think that’s unique among books in print.\n\nPJK: I felt people would like the beach version of a travel guide that tells you what not to miss when you visit a place, explaining the history of that particular fountain, wall, or monument: why it’s special and remarkable, who put it there, the historical context that will enrich your experience standing in front of it. We have that for Berlin and Rome, why not for the California coastline? I also don’t think scientists are always great at speaking plainly to people, at capturing the wonder they themselves feel about nature in their writing or images. That’s probably because we are trained to be dispassionate and technical in our work, but we love what we study, and I wanted that exuberance to come through (along with some good ecology) for the interested reader!\n\nWhat’s the best way for readers to approach this book?\n\nRPK: There are lots of photos, sidebars, maps, and so on, which some readers might find as useful points of entry. It’s quite readable (we think) straight through, too, but we were aiming to stay away from sounding like a textbook. My hope is that you can throw it in your car and pull it out on a road trip along the coast.\n\nPJK: Like a literal choose-your-own-adventure book. Decide where you want to go: maybe it’s nearby, or you’ve never been there before, or a photo catches your imagination. Take a drive, go for a walk in the sea breeze and sunshine, and make a new discovery. One thing should lead to another, and then another. . . and if you hit the end of a chapter, flip to a random page and start again.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nRyan P.

From fireweed to elk, the plants and animals Franklin saw in the blast area and beyond would not just change how ecologists approached the eruption and its landscape, but also prompt them to think in new ways about how life responds in the face of seemingly total devastation—a “superb look at scientists and science at work” (Publishers Weekly).\n\nFukushima Futures: Survival Stories in a Repeatedly Ruined Seascape\n\nIn this study of disaster, modernization, and fishing communities, anthropologist Satsuki Takahashi examines the complex relationship between commercial fishing families and the Joban Sea—once known for premium-quality fish and now notorious as the world’s worst nuclear catastrophe. In response to unrelenting setbacks, fishing communities have developed survival strategies shaped by the precarity they share with their marine ecosystem. The collaborative resilience that emerges against this backdrop of vulnerability and uncertainty challenges the progress-bound logic of futurism, bringing more hopeful possibilities for the future into sharper focus.\n\nThe River That Made Seattle: A Human and Natural History of the Duwamish\n\nWith bountiful salmon and fertile plains, the Duwamish River has drawn people to its shores over the centuries for trading, transport, and sustenance. Unfortunately, the very utility of the river has been its undoing, as decades of dumping led to the river being declared a Superfund cleanup site. Using previously unpublished accounts by Indigenous people and settlers, BJ Cummings’s compelling narrative restores the river to its central place in Seattle and Pacific Northwest history. Writing from the perspective of environmental justice—and herself a key figure in river restoration efforts—Cummings vividly portrays the people and conflicts that shaped the region’s culture and natural environment and offers a call for action in aligning decisions about the river and its future with values of collaboration, respect, and justice.\n\nAnticipating Future Environments: Climate Change, Adaptive Restoration, and the Columbia River Basin\n\nEcological restoration is often premised on the idea of returning a region to an earlier, healthier state. Yet the effects of climate change undercut that premise and challenge the ways scientists can work, destabilizing the idea of “normalcy” and revealing the politics that shape what scientists can do. Using the restoration efforts in the Columbia River Basin as a case study, UW research scientist Shana Lee Hirsch explores how climate change affects the daily work of scientists, and how a scientific field itself can adapt to climate change.\n\nHatched: Dispatches from the Backyard Chicken Movement\n\nIn this engaging and thought-provoking book, Gina G. Warren digs into the history and food politics of the backyard chicken movement, chronicling her own misadventures raising chickens and attempts at sustainable eating. The result is a fresh and charming story that also raises questions about sustainable farming, industrial agriculture, and our connections with the animals we love.\n\nThe University of Washington Press joins the Yakama Nation, Northwest Native tribes, and the many individuals, organizations, and institutions grieving the loss of elder Virginia Beavert, who passed away on February 8 at the age of 102.\n\nBeavert, who was also known by her Yakama name, Tuxámshish, was a noted Native scholar and linguist and a tireless advocate for tribal culture and traditions.\n\n“UW Press is honored to have published three books in collaboration with the legendary and deeply knowledgeable Virginia Beavert,” says press director Nicole Mitchell. “Through these works, her learning and wisdom will continue to reach students in Native communities and beyond for many generations to come.”\n\nIchishkíin Sinwit Yakama / Yakima Sahaptin Dictionary, coauthored with Sharon L. Hargus and copublished with Heritage University, is the first published dictionary of any Sahaptin dialect and documents the Ichishkíin dialect spoken by the Yakama people of Eastern Washington. The Gift of Knowledge / Ttnúwit Átawish Nch’inch’imamí: Reflections on Sahaptin Ways, authored by Beavert and edited by Janne L. Underriner, includes cultural teachings, oral history, and stories (many in bilingual Ishishkíin-English format) about family life, religion, ceremonies, food gathering, and other aspects of traditional culture. Anakú Iwachá: Yakama Legends and Stories, coedited with Michelle M. Jacob and Joana W. Jansen, presents stories that Yakama elders recorded in several dialects of the Ichishkíin language that Beavert collected and translated into English.\n\nBelow, longtime UW Press executive editor Lorri Hagman reflects on Virginia Beavert and her work.\n\nWhen I began working with Virginia in 2013 on The Gift of Knowledge, she was, at the age of 92, already a legend in her own time. In 1986, at 65, when most people would have settled into retirement, she earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from Central Washington University. That was followed by a master’s degree in bilingual/bicultural education from the University of Arizona in 2000 (at age 79) and a PhD in linguistics from the University of Oregon in 2012 (at age 90). Virginia was still traveling from her home in Wapato, Washington, to the University of Oregon in Eugene to mentor students and teach the Ichishkíin language, and she had published her 560-page dictionary and the first edition of her collected Yakama legends and stories—monumental contributions to scholarship. Now she was eager to transform her doctoral dissertation into a book for general readers, especially future generations of the Yakama Nation. That book, The Gift of Knowledge, narrates stories from Virginia’s own life that exemplify Yakama lifeways and values.\n\nMy quintessential Virginia memory is a story she told when we met in Eugene, Oregon, for what turned out to be a leisurely three-hour breakfast. Horses played a big role in her own life, but this horse story is about how her mother, as a child, was stranded alone overnight and was protected by horses from wolves. It is included in The Gift of Knowledge:\n\nMy mother had an experience when she was young where horses saved her life in the mountains. She was taking care of them during a berry picking trip to the Trout Lake area. An Elder told her to take the horses to a certain meadow to graze. She was to leave them and walk back to camp. It was already past noontime and she did not question the request. She rode her own horse bareback, and towed the horses together with a rope halter, the head of one horse to the tail of the one in front, and navigated them in that way.\n\nIt was getting dark when she reached her destination. She hurried back toward camp but it became so dark she could not see the trail and was forced to get down on her hands and knees and feel her way. Soon she heard the timber wolves at a distance; they came nearer and nearer. She said she began to feel sorry for herself and was thinking that her relatives did not love her; that they wanted her to die. As she was feeling her way along the trail she felt something warm and soft. It was the nostril of her horse, Taḵawaakúɬ, who had come back to rescue her. She took hold of his tail and he led her back to the meadow. The wolves were following them all the way.\n\nIn the meadow all the horses gathered around her. Her horse lay down, and she slept on his belly to keep warm until morning. The wolves were not able to reach her because the horses surrounded and protected her. In the morning she went back to camp and no one mentioned anything. No one apologized to her or wanted to know how she had made out. She explained that that was the cultural way. They wanted her to find a spiritual power from the mountains. While she was asleep she acquired that power. She was a healer for women.\n\nVirginia grew up in a traditional, Indian-speaking household. Her maternal grandmother was a shaman, as were her father and mother; her great-great-grandmother was an herbal doctor and midwife. As a child, she was surrounded by people who spoke Nez Perce, Umatilla, Klikatat, and Ichishkíin. Until she went to school at age eight, her life was spent learning about the world around her, along with skills such as food gathering and the use of medicinal plants. Her work on Native languages began at age twelve, when she met linguist Melville Jacobs while she was working with his student, anthropologist Margaret Kendell, as liaison and interpreter for the people Kendell interviewed. When Jacobs discovered that Virginia was a fluent speaker of the Klikatat language, he taught her to read and write the orthography he had developed to record Klikatat stories, and she began a lifetime of work on Native languages.\n\nDuring World War II, Virginia joined the United States Air Force, serving as a wireless radio operator at the B-29 Bomber Base at Clovis, New Mexico. After the war, she bought herself a thoroughbred horse, which she rode in races and rodeos, and she earned a living as a medical secretary. Her stepfather—a multilingual speaker of Ichishkíin and southern Salish dialects who had worked with University of Oregon linguist Bruce Rigsby to record oral histories and legends—convinced her to return to school and study anthropology.\n\nShe went on to teach courses on Native American languages and cultures at Central Washington University; Yakima Valley College; Wapato High School; Heritage University in Toppenish, Washington, on the Yakama Reservation, where she was the director of the Sahaptin Language Program; and the Northwest Indian Language Institute and World Language Academy at the University of Oregon.\n\nVirginia was the first woman elected as secretary-treasurer of the Yakama Nation’s General Council and served on the council from 1974–85. She was a 2006 recipient of the Washington Governor’s Heritage Award; 2007 Central Washington University Alumna of the Year; 2008 recipient of the Ken Hale prize of the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas; and 2008 recipient of a Distinguished Service Award, University of Oregon.\n\n—Lorri Hagman\n\nHusky crew fever is everywhere with the worldwide release of The Boys in the Boat, the film adaptation of Daniel James Brown’s bestselling book about the University of Washington rowing team that competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn the 1920s, UW was considered an upstart West Coast college as it began to challenge the Eastern universities in the ancient sport of crew racing. Sportswriters scoffed at the “crude western boats” and their crews. But for the next forty years, UW dominated rowing around the world.\n\nThe secret of the Huskies’ success was George Pocock, a soft-spoken English immigrant raised on the banks of the Thames and the subject of the late Gordon Newell’s book, Ready All! George Yeoman Pocock and Crew Racing, first published by UW Press in 1987.\n\n“As a youth in Britain, Pocock learned the rudiments of boat building from his father, who crafted boats for young Etonians. Forced to emigrate by straitened economic conditions, he journeyed to the Pacific Northwest intending to find work as a lumberjack. Fortunately for the University of Washington in Seattle, he was persuaded to establish shop there and began making shells of outstanding quality” (Publishers Weekly).\n\nPocock combined perfectionism with innovation to make the lightest, best-balanced, fastest shells the world had ever seen. After studying the magnificent canoes built by Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, he broke with tradition and began to make shells of native cedar.\n\nPocock, who had been a champion sculler in his youth, never credited his boats for the accomplishments of a crew. He wanted every rower to share his vision of discipline and teamwork. As rowers from the UW went on to become coaches at major universities across the country, Pocock’s philosophy—and his shells—became nationally famous in the world of crew.\n\nExcerpt from Ready All!\n\nGeorge Pocock’s loyalty to the sport of rowing in general was his hallmark through­out his life but following the Husky crew’s surprise victory at Poughkeepsie in 1923, he found that he must assess his loyalties to the University of Washington and to his staunch friend, [head crew coach] Rusty Callow. He found himself wooed by a number of prestigious universities around the nation.\n\nHarvard made the most pressing overtures. Three members of its rowing committee journeyed to Seattle to offer him many inducements, including a new fully equipped and rent-free boatshop, and a generous salary to maintain the shells and assist the coaching staff.\n\n“I still could not see my way clear to accept,” Pocock recorded, “although their offer was quite magnificent compared to what I was getting at Washington, which was only the use of the garret workshop.”\n\nDelighted, and perhaps surprised, that George had declined Harvard’s generous offer, Callow undertook a campaign on his friend’s behalf. He arranged, through the Alumni Association, the purchase of $1,500 worth of power machinery for more efficient and less laborious production, and boatbuilding space was expanded to the ground floor area below the original shop. The additional space was needed, for Pocock shells had gained overnight fame in rowing circles, and George was well on the way to a virtual monopoly of his highly specialized trade in the United States. The eight shells ordered in the fall of 1923 following the Poughkeepsie triumph were only the beginning. Five of that first big order were for East Coast schools, including Harvard. The others went to Wisconsin, California, and Washington.\n\nHarvard also took delivery of an English-built shell, and George was delighted to receive a clipping from the Boston Globe describing the trial runs of his shell and the one imported from England. As a result of the trials, the Pocock-built shell was chosen to compete in the traditional Yale-Harvard race.\n\nOrders kept coming in, and George and his three-man crew soon formed a highly efficient working team, although none of his employees had any previous experience in boatbuilding. They had, however, worked under George’s supervision at Boeing, and like most of the wartime work force, had been laid off. He was thus able to pick from the best of his former craftsmen, and they quickly mastered their new trade.\n\nOnce the University of Washington won the U.S. intercollegiate rowing champion­ship, the crew quarters swarmed with budding oarsmen. The turnout was so great that many youngsters had to be cut from the squad to reduce it to a size the coaching staff could cope with.\n\nThe cuts were an aspect of rowing that never failed to sadden George. “Cutting a squad is a heartbreaking thing, because the virtues of rowing have to be denied to so many fine young men,” he wrote. “It grieved me to wonder how many careers had been frustrated and weakened. lt seemed to me ironic that the outstanding success of Washington crew, which we had worked so hard to attain, was resulting in the denial of rowing’s benefits to many through the sheer number of applicants.”\n\nGeorge was closely involved on a very personal basis with the generations of young oarsmen who came under his benign influence. Every coach during George’s half century on the campus was wise enough to assemble each new squad to listen to the Pocock litany of praise for the spiritual and physical benefits of rowing. Delivered in his gentle, cultured voice, it was far more effective than any loud, impassioned pep talk.\n\nIt was a source of great satisfaction to him that many of the crewmen snatched mo­ments from their usually crammed schedules to come to his shop for counsel. He knew that many of them were rowing their hearts out in the little time left from demanding academic schedules. If the annual cutting of crew hopefuls was heartbreak­ing to him, this informal friendship with those who made it was deeply heartwarming: “I so admired all the oarsmen, and since my shop was right at the boathouse, I got to know many of them well. I dare not name any of the hundreds of young men who came to the shop during my fifty years of service to Washington rowing, for fear I would leave some out. But, generalizing, I can say there were all kindred souls, sincerely interested in painstaking work; fashioning natural material into the rowing shells of great beauty.”\n\nIn 1924, the boats were still built with much the same materials George had learned to work with as an apprentice at Eton: “We continued to use Spanish cedar for the skin of the boats, which we obtained in New York in the log, having it sawn into thick planks there, and shipped via steamer to Seattle. The shipping charge from New York to Seattle was $50 for a single log in plank form, and getting them from dockside to the boathouse cost another $50. That was a lot of money in 1924, and it worried me. I knew many schools had only very limited funds to support rowing, and I cried to keep the costs to them of racing shells as low as possible.”\n\nEventually, George found a better and less costly wood with which to sheath his boats: western red cedar, which he henceforth referred to as “the wood eternal.” George had demonstrated the virtues of Northwest cedar back in 1918, when the U.S. Navy Department conceded that the Boeing-built World War I flying boats planked with cedar were superior to the Eastern-built versions using white pine—and considerably less costly. Tradition, however, is firmly embedded in rowing and shellbuilding, and it was nearly a decade before George ventured to replace the Spanish cedar which had been the accepted material for sheathing the boats over many generations.\n\n“Nineteen twenty-seven was the first year I began using our Pacific Northwest lumber—western red cedar—for planking the boats,” he wrote. “Such was the force of tradition in rowing that nothing but Spanish cedar had been considered. But I found the native red cedar to be marvelous material, ideal for the skin of racing shells; impervious to rot and light in weight. It swells and shrinks very little when seasoned three years, air-dried, as we do. Its cells are complete, each containing trapped air. It is the wood eternal. Some of the first shells we built with it are still in regular use forty-five years later . . . nearly twice the useful life of the Spanish cedar boats.” It was typical of George to be pleased that the use of this amazingly durable material “cut the cost of rowing equipment in half.” This would promote the sport he loved, and for him that was the important thing. “Built-in obsolescence” was not a part of George’s business philosophy.\n\nThe western red cedar shells were dubbed “banana boats” in rowing circles. The term was not derisive, for they proved to be faster as well as far more durable than the earlier ones, as George explained:\n\n“The name banana came from the fact that the western red cedar boats had an unusual amount of camber, which curved them like a banana. This feature was not built into them. As in the past, they were built on an I-beam which was perfectly straight. The camber appears after they are built and when they are being used for their intended purpose, carrying a crew on water, and is caused by a strange characteristic of this wood. While it shrinks or swells very little across the grain, lengthwise it will swell or extend as much as an inch in the sixty-foot length of an eight-oared shell. During construction, the cedar skin or planking is attached to the framework in a very dry condition, therefore its shortest natural state. When completed and in use, the woodwork naturally takes in some moisture and the cedar wants to swell lengthwise, but the frame­ work will not let it. So compression builds in the skin and the ends of the shell come up, hence your ‘banana boat.’ We like it, because when you have that compression in the shell, it makes it very lively to row.”\n\n“Our banana boats,” he recalled, “being very successful, were copied by other build­ers who were ignorant of the qualities and virtues of the western red cedar and constructed them of plywood or mahogany or Spanish cedar. These materials, not being able to swell or extend lengthwise, could not put compression in the boat as ours had. These copies were dead, no life, no spring on the catch of the oars. They might just as well have been constructed of metal!”\n\nGeorge was reluctant to talk of “fast shells.” Only the crews who manned them made them fast or slow. He expressed his opinion this way:\n\nI cannot help saying right here, not having publicly or in advertisements boosted our boats, which gives me a right to say it: whenever a foreign boat wins a race or foreign oars are used, the makers crow about it from the rooftops as though the boat won the race and not the crew. We have always revered the crew. They and they alone are responsible. We try to give them a boat that will do them justice.\n\nThe late Gordon Newell was the author of several books on maritime history, including Pacific Tugboats and Mighty Mo, The U.S.S.
