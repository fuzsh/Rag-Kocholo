        "meta_description": "1 review of ARTHUR WAGNER THEATRE \"An intimate theatre is named after Arthur Wagner, the founding chair of the UCSD department of Drama. His generous donation enables students to learn in this collaborative space.  I talked to Arthur at a local music event and thanked him for his support of Theatre and dance programs at UCSD and his face lit up with energy. I could see how passionate he was about life and his love of the theatre. I am a true drama queen, aka alumni of this nationally ranked theatre program, and being able to thank him meant a lot.\n\nThis student performance area can accommodate audiences of up to 99 people. The thrust style stage provides a unique vantage for patrons who literally sit around the stage. This fluid perspective exposes performers to real life performing experiences  which nurtures and challenges up and coming talent.\n\nIt is a little tricky to find in the basement of Galbraith hall so get there a little early. Tickets to the limited seating events at this location are only sold one hour before show time and everyone has a fair chance to get in at a very reasonable price. You just might get to see an emerging broadway star too!\"",
