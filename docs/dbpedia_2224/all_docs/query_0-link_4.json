        "text": "Daniel Massey was an English actor of Canadian descent, best known for portraying his godfather Noël Coward (1899-1973) in the critically acclaimed film \"Star!\" (1968). For this role he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It was his only Academy Award nomination.\n\nMassey was the son of Canadian actor Raymond Massey (1896-1983) and English actress Adrianne Allen (1907-1993). He was raised by his mother, following his parents' divorce. His paternal uncle was Canadian diplomat Vincent Massey (1887-1967), who became the first Canadian-born Governor General of Canada (term 1952-1959).\n\nMassey was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge. He made his film debut as a child actor, in the war film \"In Which We Serve\" (1942). The film depicted the Battle of Crete (1941) and its aftermath.\n\nMassey did not return to film roles until the late 1950s. His early roles included the comedy film \"Girls at Sea\" (1958), the military-themed comedy \"Operation Bullshine\" (1959), the comedy-drama \"Upstairs and Downstairs\" (1959), the music-hall themed drama and \"The Entertainer\" (1960). He played the leading role of John Fellowes (Daniel Massey), an officer in the Grenadier Guards, in the military-themed drama \"The Queen's Guards\" (1961).\n\nHis next major role was as an incompetent thief in the crime comedy \"Go to Blazes\" (1962). He had a supporting role in the historical comedy \"The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders\" (1965), which was an adaptation of the novel \"Moll Flanders\" (1722) by Daniel Defoe (c. 1660-1731).\n\nMassey received his best known role in the film \"Star!\" (1968), and received his nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The Award was instead won by rival actor Jack Albertson (1907-1981). Massey's next found a critically acclaimed role in television. He played the openly gay character Daniel in the historical drama \"The Roads to Freedom\" (1970). The series was an adaptation of a trilogy of novels: \"The Age of Reason\" (1945), \"The Reprieve\" (1945) and \"Troubled Sleep\" (1949) by Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980). They depicted the last years of the interwar period in France and the Fall of France (1940) in World War II.\n\nMassey played the historical figure Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (1532-1588) in the historical film \"Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1971). In the film. Dudley was depicted as a court favorite of Elizabeth I of England, (played by Glenda Jackson) and as a suitor for Mary I of Scotland (played by .Vanessa Redgrave).\n\nMassey next has a role in the anthology horror film \"The Vault of Horror \" (1973), which adapted several classic horror stories published by EC Comics. It was his first appearance in a comic book adaptation. He played the French dramatist Victorien Sardou (1831-1908) in the biographical film \"The Incredible Sarah\" (1976).\n\nMassey was mostly reduced to supporting roles in the religious drama \"The Devil's Advocate\" (1977), the fantasy film \"Warlords of Atlantis\" (1978), and the horror comedy \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1979). He only appeared in a hand full of films in the 1980s, but played the historical judge Mervyn Griffith-Jones (1909-1979) in \"Scandal\" (1989). The film was loosely based on the political scandal Profumo affair, which had damaged the reputation of the Conservative Party in the early 1960s.\n\nMassey was in poor health in the 1990s, and his career consequently suffered. His last film role was voicing Jesus' disciple Cleopas in the animated Biblical drama \"The Miracle Maker\" (1999). The film was an an adaptation of the Gospels of the New Testament, and was released following Massey's death.\n\nMassey died in March 1998, suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer affecting the white blood cells. He was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery in southwest London. The cemetery is located at the small community of Putney Vale, within the London Borough of Wandsworth.\n\nAnne Bancroft was born on September 17, 1931 in The Bronx, NY, the middle daughter of Michael Italiano (1905-2001), a dress pattern maker, and Mildred DiNapoli (1907-2010), a telephone operator. She made her cinema debut in Versuchung auf 809 (1952) in 1952, and over the next five years appeared in a lot of undistinguished movies such as Der Würger von Coney Island (1954), Die Gladiatoren (1954), Pantherkatze (1955), Wenn die Nacht anbricht (1956) and Das Mädchen mit den schwarzen Strümpfen (1957). By 1957 she grew dissatisfied with the scripts she was getting, left the film business and spent the next five years doing plays on Broadway. She returned to screens in 1962 with her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in Licht im Dunkel (1962), for which she won an Oscar. Bancroft went on to give acclaimed performances in Schlafzimmerstreit (1964), Stimme am Telefon (1965), Der junge Löwe (1972), Das Nervenbündel (1975), Der Elefantenmensch (1980), Sein oder Nichtsein (1983), Zwischen den Zeilen (1987) and other movies, but her most famous role would be as Mrs. Robinson in Die Reifeprüfung (1967). Her status as the \"older woman\" in the film is iconic, although in real life she was only eight years older than Katharine Ross and just six years older than Dustin Hoffman. Bancroft would later express her frustration over the fact that the film overshadowed her other work. Selective for much of her intermittent career, she appeared onscreen more frequently in the '90s and early '00s, playing a range of characters in such films as Love Potion No. 9 - Der Duft der Liebe (1992), Codename - Nina (1993), Familienfeste und andere Schwierigkeiten (1995), Die Akte Jane (1997), Große Erwartungen (1998), Glauben ist alles! (2000) and Die Villa (2000). She also started to make some TV films, including Deep in My Heart (1999) for which she won an Emmy. Sadly, on June 6, 2005, Bancroft passed away at the age of 73 from uterine cancer. Her death surprised many, as she had not disclosed her illness to the public. Among her survivors was her husband of 41 years, Mel Brooks, and their son Max Brooks, who was born in 1972. Her final film, the animated feature Delgo (2008), was released posthumously in 2008 and dedicated to her memory.\n\nJane Seymour was born as Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg in 1951 in Middlesex, England, to a nurse mother and gynaecologist/obstetrician father. She is of Polish Jewish (father) and Dutch (mother) descent. She adopted the acting name of \"Jane Seymour\" when she entered show business as it was easier for people to remember (and the name of one of King Henry VIII's wives). She attracted the attention of the James Bond film producers when they saw her on British television. She was cast as the main Bond girl, \"Solitaire\", in Leben und sterben lassen (1973). The role gained her international recognition but she was in danger of losing it all like the previous Bond girls, so she came to the U.S.\n\nA casting director advised her to lose her English accent and acquire an American accent to land roles on American television. She did and started getting roles, earning five Emmy nominations, resulting in one win for Onassis, der reichste Mann der Welt (1988) for playing Maria Callas. She won Golden Globe awards for both Jenseits von Eden (1981) and the American television series Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993), where she played the title role for 5 years. She occasionally appeared in feature films, memorably in Ein tödlicher Traum (1980) and in Die Hochzeits-Crasher (2005).\n\nMarried and divorced four times, she gave birth to four children and is a stepmother to two. They have children of their own, making her a grandmother. As of 2018, she has been acting in television movies and making guest-appearances.\n\nBorn in London, England, Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis is the second child of Cecil Day-Lewis, Poet Laureate of the U.K., and his second wife, actress Jill Balcon. His maternal grandfather was Sir Michael Balcon, an important figure in the history of British cinema and head of the famous Ealing Studios. His older sister, Tamasin Day-Lewis, is a documentarian. His father was of Northern Irish and English descent, and his mother was Jewish (from a family from Latvia and Poland). Daniel was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent, which he despised, and the more progressive Bedales in Petersfield, which he adored. He studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic School. Daniel made his film debut in Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), but then acted on stage with the Bristol Old Vic and Royal Shakespeare Companies and did not appear on screen again until 1982, when he landed his first adult role, a bit part in Gandhi (1982). He also appeared on British television that year in Frost in May (1982) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (1982). Notable theatrical performances include Another Country (1982-83), Dracula (1984) and The Futurists (1986).\n\nHis first major supporting role in a feature film was in Die Bounty (1984), quickly followed by Mein wunderbarer Waschsalon (1985) and Zimmer mit Aussicht (1985). The latter two films opened in New York on the same day, offering audiences and critics evidence of his remarkable range and establishing him as a major talent. The New York Film Critics named him Best Supporting Actor for those performances. In 1986, he appeared on stage in Richard Eyre's \"The Futurists\" and on television in Eyre's production of The Insurance Man (1986). He also had a small role in a British/French film, Nanou (1986). In 1987, he assumed leading-man status in Philip Kaufman's Die unerträgliche Leichtigkeit des Seins (1988), followed by a comedic role in the unsuccessful Stars and Bars - Der ganz normale amerikanische Wahnsinn (1988). His brilliant performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's Mein linker Fuß (1989) won him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nHe returned to the stage to work again with Eyre, as Hamlet at the National Theater, but was forced to leave the production close to the end of its run because of exhaustion, and has not appeared on stage since. He took a hiatus from film as well until 1992, when he starred in Der letzte Mohikaner (1992), a film that met with mixed reviews but was a great success at the box office. He worked with American director Martin Scorsese in Zeit der Unschuld (1993), based on Edith Wharton's novel. Subsequently, he teamed again with Jim Sheridan to star in Im Namen des Vaters (1993), a critically acclaimed performance that earned him another Academy Award nomination. His next project was in the role of John Proctor in father-in-law Arthur Miller's play Hexenjagd (1996), directed by Nicholas Hytner. He worked with Scorsese again to star in Gangs of New York (2002), another critically acclaimed performance that earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.\n\nDay-Lewis's wife, Rebecca Miller, offered him the lead role in her film Jack & Rose (2005), in which he played a dying man with regrets over how his wife had evolved and over how he had brought up his teenage daughter. During filming, he arranged to live separate from his wife to achieve the \"isolation\" needed to focus on his own character's reality. The film received mixed reviews. In 2007, he starred in director Paul Thomas Anderson's loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel \"Oil!\", titled There Will Be Blood (2007). Day-Lewis received the Academy Award for Best Actor, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and a variety of film critics' circle awards for the role. In 2009, Day-Lewis starred in Rob Marshall's musical adaptation Nine (2009) as film director Guido Contini. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Satellite Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nA classically-trained actor, director and playwright, Keith Baxter (born Keith Stanley Baxter-Wright) was a commanding theatrical presence. The son of a captain in the Merchant Navy, he was schooled in his Welsh home town of Newport, Monmouthshire, became interested in theatre arts and then studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1953. Initially on stage with repertory companies in Oxford and Worthing, he made his professional acting bow three years later in a small part in Noël Coward 's play South Sea Bubble at the Lyric Theatre in London. Orson Welles then famously cast him as Hal, Prince of Wales, in his celebrated play Chimes at Midnight which opened at the Grand Opera House in Belfast to good reviews on February 13, 1960. Baxter recreated this role five years later for the filmed version opposite Welles, John Gielgud and French star Jeanne Moreau.\n\nIn 1962, Baxter won a Theatre World Award for his debut Broadway performance as King Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons. His subsequent classic roles included both Octavius and Marc Antony in different productions of Antony and Cleopatra. In 1971, he was awarded a Drama Desk Award for his tour-de-force turn as Milo Tindle in Anthony Shaffer's brilliant play Sleuth opposite Anthony Quayle as crime novelist Andrew Wyke. Off-Broadway, Baxter essayed seven different parts for the gothic thriller The Woman in Black. He also began directing for the stage by the mid-70s and was latterly associated with the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington D.C.. His works as an author have included the 1987 play 'Barnaby and the Old Boys' and a memoir published in 1999, titled 'My Sentiments Exactly', recalling collaborations and friendships with luminaries like Coward, Gielgud, Tennessee Williams, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.\n\nBaxter's screen career has been somewhat desultory, apparently subordinated to his theatrical work. His first credited appearance on the celluloid medium was as Charles Barrett in The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1957) (which also starred Gielgud). He was then primarily active on television in anthology drama (ITV Play of the Week (1955)) and - infrequently -- as guest star in series ranging from Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (1961) to Hawaii Fünf-Null (1968). Baxter's final screen role was a small part as Sir Hector in the miniseries Merlin (1998) which starred Sam Neill in the title role and Gielgud as King Constant.\n\nAlan Rickman was born on a council estate in Acton, West London, to Margaret Doreen Rose (Bartlett), of English and Welsh descent, and Bernard Rickman, of Irish descent, who worked at a factory. Alan Rickman had an older brother (David), a younger brother (Michael), and a younger sister (Sheila). When Alan was 8 years old, his father died. He attended Latymer Upper School on a scholarship. He studied Graphic Design at Chelsea College of Art and Design, where he met Rima Horton, who would later become his longtime partner.\n\nAfter three years at Chelsea College, Rickman did graduate studies at the Royal College of Art. He opened a successful graphic design business, Graphiti, with friends and managed it for several years before his love of theatre led him to seek an audition with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). At the relatively late age of 26, Rickman received a scholarship to RADA, which started a professional acting career that has lasted nearly 40 years, a career which has spanned stage, screen and television, and overlapped into directing, as well. In 1987, he first came to the attention of American audiences as the Vicomte de Valmont in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" on Broadway (he was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in the role). Denied the role in the film version of the show, Rickman instead made his first film appearance opposite Bruce Willis in Stirb langsam (1988) as the villainous Hans Gruber. His take on the urbane villain set the standard for screen villains for decades to come.\n\nAlthough often cited as being a master of playing villains, Rickman actually played a wide variety of characters, such as the romantic cello-playing ghost Jamie in Anthony Minghella's Wie verrückt und aus tiefstem Herzen (1990) and the noble Colonel Brandon of Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (1995). He treated audiences to his comedic abilities in such films as Dogma (1999), Galaxy Quest - Planlos durchs Weltall (1999) and Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis (2005), and roles like Dr. Alfred Blalock in Ein Werk Gottes (2004), and as Alex Hughes in Snow Cake (2006), showcased his ability to play ordinary men in extraordinary situations. Rickman even conquered the daunting task of singing a role in a Stephen Sondheim musical as he took on the role of Judge Turpin in the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd: Der teuflische Barbier aus der Fleet Street (2007). In 2001, Rickman introduced himself to a whole new, younger generation of fans by taking on the role of Severus Snape in the film versions of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen (2001). He continued to play the role through the eighth and last movie Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011).\n\nAlan Rickman died of pancreatic cancer on 14 January 2016. He was 69 years old.\n\nSir Ian Holm was one of the world's greatest actors, a Laurence Olivier Award-winning, Tony Award-winning, BAFTA-winning and Academy Award-nominated British star of films and the stage. He was a member of the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company and has played more than 100 roles in films and on television.\n\nHe was born Ian Holm Cuthbert on September 12, 1931, in Goodmayes, Essex, to Scottish parents who worked at the Essex mental asylum. His mother, Jean Wilson (née Holm), was a nurse, and his father, Doctor James Harvey Cuthbert, was a psychiatrist. Young Holm was brought up in London. At the age of seven he was inspired by the seeing 'Les Miserables' and became fond of acting. Holm studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1950 to the Royal Shakespeare Company. There he emerged as an actor whose range and effortless style allowed him to play almost entire Shakespeare's repertoire. In 1959 his stage partner Laurence Olivier scored a hit on Ian Holm in a sword fight in a production of 'Coriolanus'. Holm still had a scar on his finger.\n\nIn 1965 Holm made his debut on television as Richard III on the BBC's The Wars of the Roses (1965), which was a filmed theatrical production of four of Shakespeare's plays condensed down into a trilogy.
