        "text": "Age 65 of Fenton, MO, passed peacefully at home on Monday June 5, 2023. Son of the late Roger A. and Jane Wagner of Brookfield, WI. Survived by his loving wife Marcia Wagner (nee Morrison); daughter Megan Matheny-Scott and son-in-law David Scott of Fairmont, WV; grandchildren Morgan and Isaiah Scott; niece Debbie Morrison of Baltimore, MD; sister-in-law Laura (nee Morrison) and brother-in-law David Blackwell of Cold Spring, KY.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Stout with a major in Country Club Management and a minor in Business. He had a keen eye for woodworking and photography. He found peace on the water with wind in his hair and music in his ear. He was a distinguished artist on the grill, but nothing he marinaded, seasoned, or slow cooked at 200 degrees over the course of an entire afternoon could match the tenderness of heart. His stature made him easy to spot in a room, but his laughter filled it. His smile brought it to life. He was never too busy to lend a helping hand, but he was absolutely merciless with a pool stick. He will be dearly missed by his family and friends.\n\nServices; Please join us for his Celebration of Life at Kutis Funeral Home-South County, 5255 Lemay Ferry Rd, Saturday, June 10th at 4p.m."
