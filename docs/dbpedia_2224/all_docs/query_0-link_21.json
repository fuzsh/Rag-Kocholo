        "text": "Kevin Spacey Fowler, better known by his stage name Kevin Spacey, is an American actor of screen and stage, film director, producer, screenwriter and singer. He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s that culminated in his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller The Usual Suspects (1995), and an Academy Award for Best Actor for midlife crisis-themed drama American Beauty (1999).\n\nHis other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film Swimming with Sharks (1994), psychological thriller Seven (1995), the neo-noir crime film L.A. Confidential (1997), the drama Pay It Forward (2000), the science fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001)\n\nIn Broadway theatre, Spacey won a Tony Award for his role in Lost in Yonkers. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. Since 2013, Spacey has played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards. His work in House of Cards earned him Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor.\n\nAs enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey for years kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, \"the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person\". In October 2017, he ended many years of media speculation about his personal life by confirming that he had had sexual relations with both men and women but now identified as gay.\n\nThere are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Kathleen Ann (Knutson) and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, in South Orange, New Jersey. His ancestry includes Swedish (from his maternal grandfather) and English. His middle name, \"Spacey,\" which he uses as his stage name, is from his paternal grandmother. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. The family eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister's tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played \"Captain von Trapp\" opposite classmate Mare Winningham's \"Maria\" in \"The Sound of Music\" (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (James Stewart and Johnny Carson were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.\n\nHe briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, Val Kilmer) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of \"Henry VI\".\n\nFestival head Joseph Papp ushered the young actor out into the \"real world\" of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsen's \"Ghosts\". He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in David Rabe's \"Hurlyburly\"). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, Jack Lemmon, on a production of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\". While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as \"Uncle Louie\" in Neil Simon's Broadway hit \"Lost in Yonkers\" and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\".\n\nSpacey's film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in Sodbrennen (1986). Deemed more of a \"character actor\" than a \"leading man\", he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain \"Mel Profitt\" on the TV series Kampf gegen die Mafia (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), a sadistic Hollywood exec in Unter Haien in Hollywood (1994), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in Die üblichen Verdächtigen (1995).\n\nThe \"Suspects\" role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in David Fincher's thriller Sieben (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino's Al Pacino's Looking for Richard (1996), Spacey made his own directorial debut with Albino Alligator (1996), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in L.A. Confidential (1997) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und Böse (1997). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban comedy American Beauty (1999) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences' imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nNo longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he's finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.\n\nIn February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, Cloaca (2003)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best, and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the David Mamet 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly.\n\nIn 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, House of Cards (2013). Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show's first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include Outstanding lead actor in a drama series. In 2017, he played a memorable role as a villain in the action thriller Baby Driver (2017).\n\nEmma Thompson was born on April 15, 1959 in Paddington, London, into a family of actors - father Eric Thompson and mother Phyllida Law, who has co-starred with Thompson in several films. Her sister, Sophie Thompson, is an actor as well. Her father was English-born and her mother is Scottish-born. Thompson's wit was cultivated by a cheerful, clever, creative family atmosphere, and she was a popular and successful student. She attended Cambridge University, studying English Literature, and was part of the university's Footlights Group, the famous group where, previously, many of the Monty Python members had first met.\n\nThompson graduated in 1980 and embarked on her career in entertainment, beginning with stints on BBC radio and touring with comedy shows. She soon got her first major break in television, on the comedy skit program Alfresco (1983), writing and performing along with her fellow Footlights Group alums Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. She also worked on other TV comedy review programs in the mid-1980s, occasionally with some of her fellow Footlights alums, and often with actor Robbie Coltrane.\n\nThompson found herself collaborating again with Fry in 1985, this time in his stage adaptation of the play \"Me and My Girl\" in London's West End, in which she had a leading role, playing Sally Smith. The show was a success and she received favorable reviews, and the strength of her performance led to her casting as the lead in the BBC television miniseries Fortunes of War (1987), in which Thompson and her co-star, Kenneth Branagh, play an English ex-patriate couple living in Eastern Europe as the Second World War erupts. Thompson won a BAFTA Award for her work on the program. She married Branagh in 1989, continued to work with him professionally, and formed a production company with him. In the late 80s and early 90s, she starred in a string of well-received and successful television and film productions, most notably her lead role in the Merchant-Ivory production of Wiedersehen in Howards End (1992), which confirmed her ability to carry a movie on both sides of the Atlantic and appropriately showered her with trans-Atlantic honors - both an Oscar and a BAFTA award.\n\nSince then, Thompson has continued to move effortlessly between the art film world and mainstream Hollywood, though even her Hollywood roles tend to be in more up-market productions. She continues to work on television as well, but is generally very selective about which roles she takes. She writes for the screen as well, such as the screenplay for Ang Lee's Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (1995), in which she also starred as Elinor Dashwood, and the teleplay adaptation of Margaret Edson's acclaimed play Wit (2001), in which she also starred.\n\nThompson is known for her sophisticated, skillful, though her critics say somewhat mannered, performances, and of course for her arch wit, which she is unafraid to point at herself - she is a fearless self-satirist. Thompson and Branagh divorced in 1994, and Thompson is now married to fellow actor Greg Wise, who had played Willoughby in Ang Lee's Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (1995). Thompson and Wise have one child, Gaia, born in 1999. She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours for her services to drama.\n\nThis remarkable, one-of-a-kind actress has, since the early 1990s, intrigued film and TV audiences with her glowing, yet careworn eccentricity and old world-styled glamour. Very much in demand these days as a character player, Patricia Clarkson nevertheless continues to avoid the temptation of money-making mainstream filming while reaping kudos and acting awards in out-of-the-way projects.\n\nThe New Orleans born-and-bred performer with the given name of Patricia Davies Clarkson was born on December 29, 1959, the daughter of Arthur (\"Buzz\") Clarkson, a school administrator, and Jackie Clarkson, a local city politician and councilwoman. Patricia demonstrated an early interest in acting and managed to appear in a few junior high and high school-level plays while growing up. She took her basic college studies at Louisiana State University, studying speech for two years, before transferring to New York's Fordham University and graduating with honors in theatre arts.\n\nAccepted into the prestigious Yale School of Drama graduate program, she earned her Master of Fine Arts after gracing a wide range of productions including \"Electra,\" \"Pericles,\" \"Twelfth Night\", \"The Lower Depths,\" \"The Misanthrope,\" \"Pacific Overtures\" and \"La Ronde\". From there she took on New York City where she attracted strong East Coast notice in 1986 for her portrayal of Corrina in \"The House of Blue Leaves\" and in such other plays as \"Eastern Standard\" (1988) and \"Wolf-Man\" (1989).\n\nKnown for her organic approach to acting, the flaxen-maned actress decided to try out her trademark whiskey voice in Hollywood at age 28, making her movie debut as Mrs. Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables: Die Unbestechlichen (1987) starring Kevin Costner. The following years she gained attention for playing Samantha Walker in Das Todesspiel (1988) where she starred opposite Clint Eastwood's popular \"Dirty Harry\" character. Playing supportive, wifely types at the onset, she became a strong contender for character stardom by the mid-to-late 1990s, not only on stage but in the independent film arena.\n\nOn stage Patricia received impressive notices for her contributions to the plays \"Raised in Captivity,\" \"The Ride Down Mt. Morgan,\" \"Three Days of Rain\" and, in particular, \"The Maiden's Prayer,\" which nabbed her both Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk Award nominations. In 2004, she finally enacted the classic part she seemed born to play, that of Southern belle Blanche DuBois in the Kennedy Center production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". She earned glowing notices.\n\nOn camera she was offered roles of marked diversity. From the heavier dramatics of a film like 1862 Kentucky - Die Schlacht am Meshack Creek (1995), she could move deftly into light comedy, courtesy of Neil Simon in the TV-movie Neil Simon's London Suite (1996). It was, however, her bleak, convulsive portrayal of Greta, a strung-out, heroin-happy German has-been actress, opposite a resurgent Ally Sheedy in the acclaimed art film High Art (1998) that truly put Patricia on the indie map. From this she was handed a silver plate's worth of excitingly offbeat roles. In 2003 alone, Patricia received a special acting prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her superb work in three films: as a somber, grieving artist in Station Agent (2003), a cold-hearted cancer victim in Pieces of April - Ein Tag mit April Burns (2003), and a jokey, get-with-it mom in All the Real Girls (2003). She was nominated for a \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar for the second film mentioned.\n\nOn TV Patricia received two Emmys for her recurring guest part as Frances Conroy's free-spirited sister in the acclaimed black comedy series Six Feet Under - Gestorben wird immer (2001). She also received the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics awards for her supporting work in the gorgeous, 1950s-styled melodrama Dem Himmel so fern (2002), as a prim and proper Stepford-wife and deceptive friend to Julianne Moore.\n\nNo matter the size, such as her extended cameos in The Green Mile (1999), All the Real Girls (2003), Miracle - Das Wunder von Lake Placid (2004) and Elegy oder die Kunst zu lieben (2008), Patricia manages to make the most of whatever screen time she has, often stealing scenes effortlessly. Working for director/actor Woody Allen in a small but notable role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), he was impressed enough to promote her with a lead in a subsequent film Whatever Works - Liebe sich wer kann (2009).\n\nMore recent work includes leads and supports in the films Vincent in Brixton (2003), Legendary (2010), Freunde mit gewissen Vorzügen (2011), Learning to Drive - Fahrstunden fürs Leben (2014), Der Buchladen der Florence Green (2017), Delirium (2018), Out of Blue (2018), Almost Love (2019) and as the antagonist Ava Paige in the sci-fi thrillers Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten im Labyrinth (2014), Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten in der Brandwüste (2015) and Maze Runner - Die Auserwählten in der Todeszone (2018). On TV, the never-married Patricia earned a supporting Golden Globe for her fine work in the mini-series Sharp Objects (2018) and had a strong recurring role on the political series House of Cards (2013).\n\nJohn C. McGinley's path to stardom is a story that reads like a classic Hollywood script. While an understudy in New York in the Circle-In-The-Square production of John Patrick Shanley's \"Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,\" he was spotted by director Oliver Stone and soon after was cast in \"Platoon,\" the first of a long list of collaborations between Stone and McGinley which includes \"Wall Street,\" \"Talk Radio,\" \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"Nixon\" and \"Any Given Sunday.\"\n\nHe stars as the title character in IFC's scripted comedy-horror series, \"Stan Against Evil,\" on which he also serves as a producer. John C. stars as disgruntled former police sheriff 'Stanley Miller,' a sour, aging bulldog who has recently lost his position as head honcho due to an angry outburst at his wife's funeral. When the new sheriff opens his eyes to the plague of angry demons haunting their small New Hampshire town, 'Stan' begrudgingly joins an alliance with her to fight them off.\n\nJohn C.'s deep commitment to independent films has driven him to star in and complete production on three upcoming motion pictures in 2016 alone! James Gunn's \"The Belko Experiment,\" Paul Shoulberg's \"The Good Catholic\" and Richard Dresser's \"Rounding Third.\"\n\nHe is an audience favorite for his hilarious portrayal of 'Dr. Perry Cox' in the Emmy-nominated medical comedy series, \"Scrubs,\" which ended its successful nine season run in 2010. He starred for two seasons in TBS's workplace comedy series \"Ground Floor,\" which reunited him with creator Bill Lawrence (\"Scrubs\"). John C. played 'Mr. Mansfield,' the critical boss to hot-shot young banker 'Brody' (Skylar Austin). He also made a memorable arc on season 6 of USA Networks' hit drama series \"Burn Notice.\"\n\nJohn C.'s impressive career in film spans a diverse range of characters in over seventy films to date, including such features as the recent \"Get A Job,\" \"Alex Cross,\" \"Wild Hogs,\" \"Identity,\" \"The Animal,\" \"The Rock,\" \"Nothing to Lose,\" \"Set It Off,\" \"Seven,\" \"Office Space,\" \"Mother,\" \"Wagons East,\" \"Surviving the Game,\" \"On Deadly Ground,\" \"Point Break,\" \"Highlander II,\" \"A Midnight Clear\" and \"Fat Man and Little Boy.\" He also previously starred opposite Ice Cube in Sony/Revolution Studios' feature, \"Are We Done Yet?,\" the sequel to the hit comedy \"Are We There Yet?\" He recently received critical acclaim for his role as Brooklyn Dodgers' radio broadcaster 'Red Barber' in Warner Bros.' \"42,\" the life story of Jackie Robinson and his history-making signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nAs a testament to his passion for the independent film community, John C. has appeared in director Eriq La Salle's \"Crazy As Hell\" and director Scott Silver's \"Johns.\" He also worked on \"Truth or Consequences, N.M.,\" Kiefer Sutherland's feature directorial debut and on \"Colin Fitz,\" a film John C. co-produced which premiered in competition at the Sundance Film Festival. He starred in director D.B. Sweeney's independent feature, \"Two Tickets to Paradise,\" which received raves on the festival circuit. For his performance in the later film, John C. was awarded Method Fest's Festival Director's Award, which is awarded for special recognition/excellence in film.\n\nJohn C. is a partner at McGinley Entertainment Inc., an independent film production company with several projects currently in development. John C. first worked both sides of the camera, serving double duty as actor and producer for the romantic comedy \"Watch It!\" (with Peter Gallagher and Lili Taylor).\n\nHe received stunning reviews for his starring role in Dean Koontz's gripping and highly rated suspense drama, \"Intensity,\" a four-hour original film for FOX-TV. He executive-produced and starred opposite John Cusack in HBO Pictures' western, \"The Jack Bull,\" directed by John Badham; and he appeared in HBO NYC's \"The Pentagon Wars.\"\n\nIn addition to film and television, John C.'s background is heavily rooted in theater. He received stellar reviews for his starring performance as 'Dave Moss' in the Broadway revival of David Mamet's acclaimed Pulitzer Prize-winning drama \"Glengarry Glen Ross.\" According to Newsday, \"John C. McGinley is especially dazzling as the hothead who plans the office crime.\" The play also starred Al Pacino and Bobby Cannavale and ran through January 20, 2013.\n\nHe was previously featured on Broadway in \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" and off-Broadway in \"The Ballad of Soapy Smith\" and the original cast production of Eric Bogosian's \"Talk Radio,\" both at the renowned Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival. He often cites Papp as the most instrumental force behind his career.\n\nIn May 2005, John C. was invited and honored to deliver the keynote address at the commencement ceremony for the University of California San Francisco's (UCSF) School of Medicine, one of the top medical schools in the nation.\n\nAs the father of Max, his eighteen-year-old son with Down syndrome, John C. is committed to building awareness and acceptance of people with Down syndrome. He serves as an Ambassador for Special Olympics and is a board member of the Global Down Syndrome Foundation. John C. is also one of the original creators, in conjunction with Special Olympics, of the groundbreaking \"Spread the Word to End the Word\" national campaign to eradicate the \"R\" word (retard). He has blogged repeatedly on the Huffington Post, advocating acceptance and awareness of people with special needs as well as the importance of eliminating the \"R\" word.\n\nHe can be seen in high profile commercial campaigns for Speed Stick (as Coach Speedman), Halls Cough Drops (as Tough Love/menthol-lyptus and Soft Love/honey-lemon) and Carhartt (as the voice of founder Hamilton Carhartt).\n\nJohn C. resides in Los Angeles and enjoys stand-up paddle surfing, weight lifting and golf. He married Nichole Kessler on April 7, 2007 at the couple's home in Malibu and they now have two young daughters Billie Grace and Kate Aleena, in addition to big brother Max.\n\nStylish Rupert James Hector Everett was born on May 29, 1959, in Burnham Deepdale, Norfolk, to Sara (Maclean) and Anthony Michael Everett, a Major in the British Army, who later worked in business. Of royal stock, he is of primarily English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry with a dash of German and Dutch thrown in for good measure.\n\nEverett grew up in privileged circumstances, but the wry, sometimes arrogant intellectual was a rebel from the very beginning. At the age of seven, he was placed into the care of Benedictine monks at Ampleforth College where he trained classically on the piano. He was expelled from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London for clashing with his teachers and instead apprenticed himself at the avant-garde Glasgow Citizen's Theatre in Scotland, performing in such productions as \"Don Juan\" and \"Heartbreak House.\" He moved from stage to British TV in 1982 with sophisticated appearances on such series as \"Strangers\" \"Play for Today\" and \"The Agatha Christie Hour\" and the more visibly seen mini-series Princess Daisy (1983) and Palast der Winde (1984).\n\nIn 1984, Everett filmed a leading gay role in the acclaimed collegiate-themed picture Another Country (1984), which he had performed earlier on stage in 1981. Earning a BAFTA nomination and shooting to international attention, Rupert became one of England's hottest crossover stars. Top patrician roles in quality films came his way such as Dance with a Stranger (1985) opposite Miranda Richardson and Duet for One (1986) starring Julie Andrews and Alan Bates. The rebel went international instead of Hollywood, however, with top-billing in the Aussie feature Was vom Leben übrigbleibt (1986) with Hugo Weaving; the Italian-made Chronik eines angekündigten Todes (1987) and the French drama Tolérance (1989) opposite Ugo Tognazzi.\n\nAgain, however, the wickedly sharp and suave actor doused his own star fire by clashing with the press and even his own fans in the late 1980's. In 1989, Everett openly and proudly declared his homosexuality which put an initial damper on his status as a romantic leading man. Appearing sporadically in such featured roles as the Prince of Wales in the majestic drama King George - Ein Königreich für mehr Verstand (1994) and Lord Rutledge in the family comedy Dunston - Allein im Hotel (1996), Rupert's popularity was re-energized after playing Julia Roberts' gay confidante to droll effect in the box-office comedy hit Die Hochzeit meines besten Freundes (1997), earning him both BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. He continued to impress thereafter, notably in such classical-styled pieces as Shakespeare in Love (1998) (as Christopher Marlowe), Ein Sommernachtstraum (1999) (as Oberon), and the Oscar Wilde plays Ein perfekter Ehemann (1999) (as Lord Goring, Golden Globe nominee) and Ernst sein ist alles (2002) (as Algy). On the lighter, fun side, his predilection for mischief was demonstrated as the cartoonish villain Dr. Claw, the nemesis of Matthew Broderick's title character, in Inspektor Gadget (1999).\n\nInto the millennium, Rupert continued to be a vibrant presence on stage with a tour of \"Private Lives\" (in Italian) in 2008, a 2009 Broadway revival of \"Blithe Spirit\" (his New York debut) and as Henry Higgins in Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" in Munich the following year. He went on to play Oscar Wilde in \"The Judas Kiss\" in 2013 and was about to play George on Broadway in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" when the play closed before it officially opened due to the COVID pandemic in 2020. On TV, he played the effortlessly suave Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock Holmes - Der Seidenstrumpfmörder (2004), the Marquis de Feron in the British series Die Musketiere (2014) and Carroll Quinn in a second British series Nur für Erwachsene (2020).\n\nOn film, Everett enhanced the royal dramas To Kill a King (2003) and Stage Beauty (2004) as King Charles I and King Charles II, respectively. Known for his aloof handsomeness and often smug, piss-elegant characters, he engagingly portrayed a jet-setter in the contemporary film People (2004); provided the voice of the unprincely Prince Charming in the animated features Shrek 2 - Der tollkühne Held kehrt zurück (2004) and Shrek der Dritte (2007); played a British defector opposite Sharon Stone in the romantic thriller A Different Loyalty (2004); a millionaire playboy involved in a hit-and-run in Geliebte Lügen (2005); an eccentric tycoon in In guten Händen - Oder die Geschichte der Erfindung des Vibrators (2011); King George VI (father of Queen Elizabeth) opposite Emily Watson's Queen Mum in the romantic dramedy A Royal Night - Ein königliches Vergnügen (2015); a monsignor in If I Had a Heart (2013); and tortured gay playwright Oscar Wilde during his last days in The Happy Prince (2018), which he wrote and directed.\n\nA novelist on the sly with Hello, Darling, Are You Working? (1989), Rupert has also published two volumes of memoirs: Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins (2006) and Vanished Years (2012), produced documentaries ."
