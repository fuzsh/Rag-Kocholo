Please see here an overview of our global awards programmes.\n\nQ) How do you ensure that the judging process is independent and impartial?\n\nA) The Judges are independent of the award organisers ensuring they are divided into separate panels to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nQ) Can you assure me that any details that I submit will be treated with confidentiality.\n\nA) We only share submissions with the panel responsible for judging those particular categories. Furthermore, our experienced team ensures that there is no conflict of interest before they share an entrant’s submission with anyone. All our judges have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement.\n\nQ) My submission is likely to be longer than the 1,000-word max limit. Would this disadvantage me?\n\nA) We have set the limit out of respect to the judges and we are keen to maintain this to ensure that there is a level playing field between competing submissions. Judges reserve the right to refuse to review submissions that do not comply. We also encourage against attachments to the submissions.\n\nQ) Do I need to submit a separate submission for each category?\n\nA) You will need to do a new form for each submission and you should also ensure that this specifically relates to the category for which you are entering. If you are using the same answers for multiple submissions this could result in your entry being marked down by the judging panel.\n\nQ) Where is the winner’s announcement shared?\n\nA) The winners are announced publicly the day after the official awards celebration and this is via our editorial and social media platforms.\n\nQ) Can I speak to anyone on the team about my entry?\n\nA) Yes, our experienced team is always available to assist you with preparation of your submission/s and any aspects of the process from start to finish.
