He believes it is a private affair,” the party spokesman said.\n\nGerman daily Tagesspiegel reported on Wednesday that Mr Wagner, who joined AfD shortly after it was founded in 2013, has previously been active in a group assisting refugees.\n\nAP/Reuters\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
