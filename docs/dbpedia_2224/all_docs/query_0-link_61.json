        "text": "I have been a fan of Kevin Roose since reading his first book, The Unlikely Disciple, and always enjoy how varied his subjects have been. In The Unlikely Disciple, he went undercover at an evangelical university. In his next book, Young Money, he looked at what life was like in finance for those who arrived on Wall Street in the immediate wake of the 2007/2008 financial crisis. More recently, he has been a technology columnist at The New York Times, which led to his third book: Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.\n\nIn 2024, discussions of AI are now inescapable in most workplaces. Microsoft has given us Copilot (“Your everyday AI companion”) to take meetings notes and Speaker Coach to let you know if you’re monopolizing meetings or being repetitive – or even insensitive – when talking. When Futureproof was published in 2021, this was all in its infancy but the concerns Roose is focused on have not changed. While AI offers some interesting opportunities, the big question facing us today is “how to be a human in a world that is increasingly arranged by and for machines”?\n\nRoose is far from a luddite. As a journalist focused on the technology sector, he has far more exposure to the weird and wild innovations that are looking to reshape our future – and he is concerningly skeptical about what he has seen:\n\nIf I had to rank myself on a 1-to-10 worry scale, with 1 being ‘AI will cause to economic or societal problems whatsoever’ and 10 being ‘AI will destroy us and everything we hold dear,’ I’d probably hover around a 7.\n\nRoose, like many of us, is concerned about the lack of controls in place to prepare industries and workers for the impact of AI. His nine “rules” can be used by individuals as they shape their career paths but would be most useful in the hands of industry leaders and politicians. He’s not naïve enough to think this will happen but he fears what will happen to society – especially in countries like America, with limited social supports – as humans are replaced by machines.\n\nAI optimists are broadly correct in claiming that new technology enhances our quality of life in the aggregate, and that once we acclimate to it, we rarely want to return to the old way of doings things […]\n\nBut what optimists miss is that we don’t live in the aggregate, or over the long term. We experience major economic shifts as individuals with finite careers and lifespans, and for many people, technological change hasn’t always resulted in better material conditions during their lives.\n\nAs we are all too well aware, the legacy of lost jobs and gutted industries isn’t just economic. It leads to seismic shifts in society, which are harder to predict and even harder to prepare for.\n\nWhat I did find fascinating was Roose’s use of a Canadian example to illustrate how “big nets and small webs” can help create resilience in times of change. When Research in Motion (RIM), the company behind Blackberry, crashed it had a huge impact on Waterloo, the Ontario university town turned tech hub where the company was based. Suddenly, there was a huge number of unemployed tech workers who were used to stable, well-paying jobs. In other places, Roose argues, this could have gone badly. But instead, there were “big nets” in place – our Canadian healthcare system meant no one needed to worry about essential care for themselves or their families and the provincial government stepped in with support to try and keep the workers in the region – as well as “small nets”, in the form of a tight-knit local community that offered up free office space and set up a referral network to help unemployed workers find new jobs.\n\nAlso fascinating were the policy ideas that have been suggested, in some cases by industry insiders. These include things like a “robot tax” (suggested by Bill Gates), which would require companies to pay additional tax for each labour-displacing robot they implement. At the time this was written (and I assume unchanged today), US tax law incentivized automation by having a lower tax on equipment than on human labour. A change may not slow the roll out of robots but would create a revenue stream that could be used to expand social safety net programs.\n\nOverall, a fascinating look at the future of AI, what to be excited about, what to be scared about, and how to put sensible controls in place to get the most benefit from it and least disruption for society.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI am lazily prejudiced against actors so it always comes as a pleasant surprise to occasionally discover properly bookish ones. Admittedly, all my examples are historical – I’m not sure Ryan Reynolds’ reading list would fascinate me – but it’s still a pleasure. It was thanks to Michael Dirda that I discovered Alec Guinness’ wonderful diaries (My Name Escapes Me and A Positively Final Appearance) and have now moved on to A Commonplace Book, published in 2001 after his death but based on selections he had already started compiling.\n\nThe main weakness of actors is their fondness for Shakespeare but once this is overcome the book is full of enjoy tidbits. Guinness doesn’t reach for the obscure in the way of Rupert Hart-Davis or George Lyttelton, but nor is he entirely predictable. There are familiar authors – Trollope appears several times and the wits of Guinness’ youth are well-represented – but they are familiar because they continue to entertain. I feel like 90% of commonplace books include “The Roman Centurion’s Song”, but this is only right and proper. Mine likely would as well.\n\nWhat is particularly enjoyable are sprinklings of Guinness’ own stray thoughts. I especially liked his musings on his own profession:\n\nWhen I was a young, enthusiastic theatre-goer, but before becoming a professional actor, I often heard people – members of audiences or people who pretended to theatrical judgement or sophistication – say of some actress or other, ‘I so admire her technique.’ I never knew what they were talking about, which shamed me.\n\nI still don’t know. When I watch, say, Maggie Smith, I have no awareness of any ‘technical’ accomplishment, no perception of any wheels which may be going round; what she does just seems to me mesmeric and true. If the ‘technique’ or mechanics show, then there must be something wrong. In any case I don’t want to know; I just want to believe, enjoy and be taken into another world.\n\nAnd, feeling snippy with a friend who no longer shared his faith, an unvoiced piece of snarkiness:\n\nOn our return from church:\n\nLapsed Catholic: ‘Have a nice mass?’\n\nSelf wanted to reply: ‘Oh, you know; the same old thing. The Real Presence at the altar, body, blood, soul, divinity of Christ, as usual.’\n\nThese are exceptions. If you want Guinness’ own thoughts, better to turn to his memoirs and diaries. But you still find an interest portrait of the man through the excerpts he grabs from others, revealing himself in what he finds sensible or amusing.\n\nIn the sensible category:\n\nBernard Levin\n\nWe are in a world in which ‘elite’ has become an insult, ‘discrimination’ a swear word, ‘quality’ a joke and ‘excellence’ an incomprehensible concept. In music it elevates rhythm over melody and mood over feeling, in literature it encourages lust at the expense of spirit, in painting it puts colour before expression.\n\nAnthony Trollope in a letter to Kate Field, 1862\n\nOne’s country has no right to demand everything. There is much that is higher and better and greater than one’s country. One is patriotic only because one is too small and weak to be cosmopolitan.\n\nRonald Knox in Barchester Pilgrimage, proving himself as good as observer of human-nature as Trollope\n\nLike many men who always see two sides to a question, he loved to discharge his conscience by leaning on the counsel of those who saw only one.\n\nWhile to entertain we have these:\n\nHenry Cockburn in Memorials of His Time\n\nI think it was to Mrs Hamilton that [Lord] Jeffrey said in allusion to the good taste of never losing the feminine in the literary character, that there was no objection to the blue stocking, provided the petticoat came low enough down\n\nErnest Dowson\n\nI suppose there are few friendships which can stand the test of correspondence.\n\nAnd, to end, the inevitable Max Beerbohm\n\nEvery morning I introduce myself to myself, and every night I tell myself that we have had a delightful day together, but the acquaintanceship remains experimental.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI am generally fairly callous about abandoning books if I find them unimpressive but I had such high hopes for these two that I persevered until the very end, unwilling to abandon all hope. Sometimes patience is not rewarded.\n\nRed Sauce Brown Sauce by Felicity Cloake (2022) – I adore One More Croissant for the Road, Cloake’s foodie travel book about cycling around France and enjoying local dishes. What better pastime for a food writer! And Britain, though hardly a culinary competitor to France, certainly could have offered up an interesting array of meals – but sadly Cloake focuses her regional travels through the British Isles on just one meal: breakfast. While there is some regional variance (laverbread in Wales, porridge in Scotland), it’s really not enough to carry an entire book and whereas Cloake was delightful in her excitement over the ever-changing French scenery, injuries that limit her cycling adventures, Covid restrictions, and perhaps over familiarity make her less descriptive when it comes to her native land. Too much time is devoted to talking about the friends and family who host her along the way, which is a very nice way to thank them but not of interest to most of the readers who are looking for a food- or travel-focused book. Even the title is a weak framing device, as neither the author nor many of the people she encounters like either ketchup or brown sauce with their breakfast. I hope Cloake cycles off towards more varied cuisine sometime soon.\n\nShards of Honor by Lois McMaster Bujold (1986) – I have heard rave reviews for years about the Vorkosigan Saga; the books have been nominated for countless prizes and won many of them, and the diverse cast of characters is deeply beloved by many readers. It had been a while since I last read any proper science fiction so I picked this up hoping to be starting a new and exciting series.\n\nThe concept is certainly appealing: Commander Cordelia Naismith finds herself stranded on an unpopulated planet with an injured comrade and Lord Aral Vorkosigan, an infamous soldier from the powerful and deeply political planet of Barrayar. After a few days trekking to find help, there is a clear attraction between Cordelia and Vorkosigan but interplanetary politics are vicious and Cordelia is soon fleeing for home. Of course, their paths cross again (as they must, given that they are the parents of the series’ main hero) but the politics never become less messy.\n\nI was reminded almost immediately after starting of why I’ve never had success with Bujold before: dialogue. There were other things I didn’t like – the pacing was too fast, the twists and plots that were supposed to be clever were overused – but in the end it was the dialogue that killed this for me. Cordelia is meant to be an intelligent, capable, mature woman, but slips into vapid slang at the most inopportune moments. Every time it happened, I was jolted out of the scene by my frustration. There is an inadvertently hilarious scene when Vorkosigan is somberly telling her of the evil that surrounds them, the weight of the subject making him quieter and quieter as he eloquently goes on about the perfidy of man. To which she responds, like a complete idiot: “Commodore Vorkosigan – Aral – what’s eating you? You’re so keyed up I expect you to start pacing the ceiling any minute.” Jesus wept.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThere are some books so raw with emotion that it is almost painful to read them: My Name is Million is one of these. Published anonymously in 1940, it is a memoir of the terrifying first months of the war by Lucy Zoe Girling Zajdler, an Anglo-Irish writer (who published as Martin Hare) who was married to a Pole and living in Warsaw when the war broke out.\n\nWriting from England and still reeling from her experiences, Zajdler treads an interesting line between passion and detachment. They feel like they should be polar opposites but perhaps it is the only way to write your way through the kind of shock Zajdler was still in, having lost so much so quickly. And, as she describes, it was hard to feel much of anything normal during such abnormal times:\n\nAfter I had lost everything, when not a stone, not a piece of paper, not a stitch of clothing remained of what a few weeks before had been our homes and the accumulation of two people’s whole lives; when I never knew whether I should eat again, sleep or wake, live or die, from one second to another; when I had seen everything I had cared for collapse like a house of cards, a nation stretched out on the cross, a fair country burning behind me like a box of matches and hell itself opening in front of me, there were whole days when I never suffered anything. I was incapable of passion, even of fears; even of the desire for revenge. All that was left was the human instinct for some roof of my own, some place to crawl into.\n\nWhile not unexpected, the speed of the German invasion in September 1939 was famously shocking. Proud Poland fought a terribly brief and bloody defense, but to no avail – and, shamefully for an Englishwoman, with no support from her supposed allies. Within weeks, thousands were dead, cities were razed, and the country was being divided between the Germans and Soviets. But Zajdler would not have had it any other way:\n\nWe were all of us wrong, about nearly everything. Except about one thing. We knew what was coming. We preferred it to dishonour. We have paid, probably, the most fearful price in all history. But we were right to do it. We would do it again. None of us, not one of us, with all our faults, with all our quarrels, with all our regrets, if put to the same test, but would do the same thing again.\n\nWriting in 1940, yes, some of this is propaganda. It is a reminder to the English, who dawdled with their declaration of war while their ally faced tanks, bombers, and fighter planes alone, that there are things worth fighting for. But this martial pride is also such an integral part of the Polish character. Later in their travels, a Lithuanian solider, amazed at his neighbours’ insane gallantry, comments “It is all pride with you. Polski honor! A man does not need honor. What he needs is bread and a warm coat.” Zajdler has a quick retort for him: “And you have both, and the Poles have neither. Each has what he prefers.”\n\nFrom Warsaw, Zajdler and her husband (who, like the majority of their friends, is referred to only by his first initial – A.) find themselves joining a flow of refugees looking for safety. Injured and exhausted, they make their way to the country estate of an elderly family friend who has seen her home seized and destroyed several times in past conflicts and knows this will happen again. The Soviets are advancing, the village peasants are feeling torn between customary feudal obeisance and the lure of communism, and the estate’s ever-growing population of aristocratic refugees is caught in a world of surreal horror, with all the elements of an elegant house party contrasted with total war:\n\nAll the accessories of a normal life still miraculously existed. Only the life was not normal. In the middle of a forced conversation somebody would suddenly stop dead. The jokes were too successful. Everybody was too ready to be amused. The ones who were being amusing, looking round at the other haggard faces, would suddenly realise what their own must be like, and give it up. Getting through time was like trying to swim in the Dead Sea. We did the most incredible, fantastic things. Like sitting under an arbour smothered in roses, reading novels from the library in Pinsk! Whatever else I forget, I shall never forget the horror of that sort of thing. In Warsaw, women were throwing themselves against the German tanks, into a jet of machine-gun bullets, with buckets of boiling water. Warsaw schoolchildren were standing night and day on the roofs of houses, shovelling off the incendiary bombs before they had time to burn through.\n\nIn the end, Zajdler is unable to describe her escape. One paragraph bleakly outlines the facts: from Poland, she and her husband made their way to Lithuania, Latvia, and finally Estonia, where they boarded a neutral ship and set off for Sweden. Their boat was captured by Germans, Zajdler and her husband were handed over to the Gestapo, and, though Zajdler was quickly released and made it to England, she never saw her husband again. Even though Zajdler was writing just months later and there was no official word of what had happened to her husband, she had seen enough of the Germans to know he would not survive – and she was, we know reading with the benefit of hindsight, absolutely correct.\n\nI am always interested in reading about Poland during the first months of the war and this was a very worthy addition to my education, especially since Zajdler journeyed east and I found it fascinating to learn more about reactions there to the Soviet occupation. I was also reminded of Helen MacInnes’ excellent spy novel, While Still We Live, which focused on an Englishwoman in Poland at the outbreak of the war and her experiences. MacInnes clearly did her research as what Zajdler describes is very similar to what is in that novel.\n\nZajdler’s eye for detail and utter lack of self-pity make her a fascinating guide to a horrifying period and I’m so glad an article in Slightly Foxed brought this memoir to my attention.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI love to read about many things. History, science, romance, fantasy – I eagerly try it all. But what I love best is reading the thoughts of passionate, articulate, educated people writing about books, and it is hard to think of a better example of this than Bound to Please by Michael Dirda.\n\nDirda has been reviewing books for The Washington Post since 1978 and this collection, published in 2005, shares a generous selection of one hundred reviews from his first twenty-five years there, plus a few essays for additional enjoyment. Dirda won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for criticism and it’s clear in every piece why. I’d read a few of his more personal books before – Browsings and Book by Book – but this was my first encounter with his proper criticism and I was delighted by how engaging and energetic it is, without ever sacrificing intelligence and style.\n\nHis choices here are split into intriguingly themed categories. “Professionals at Work”, “Visionaries and Moralists” (aka Victorians), “Europeans”, and “Performing Selves” proved particularly devasting to my to-read list, but even the sections I wasn’t naturally drawn to (like “We Moderns”) still managed to fascinate. I may not want to read all these books but I love reading about them. How could you not want to pick up Grievance by K.C. Constantine after reading this passionate passage at the start of his review?\n\nThere are plenty of novels and memoirs about Jewish intellectuals and Gaelic charmers, about the African American experience and the legacy of the Civil War in the South, about drugged-out Gen-Xers, unhappy academics, Connecticut divorcees, and Washington bureaucrats who stumble upon global terrorist plots. But who today writes about working-class America? And by the working class I mean the Italians and Poles and blacks who do the real labor of the world, in foundries and factories, with lathes and diesel shovels and sweat. I mean the people who need to stuff their dirty clothes in grocery bags and take showers in locker rooms before they go home at the end of an eight-hour shift. Sure, much of Rust Belt America is vanishing, but a lot remains, and one of its few laureates is K.C. Constantine.\n\nOr who doesn’t recognize their own prejudices as Dirda outlines his against Soviet literature? And when he recants after reading Bulgakov, aren’t you more likely to give that author a chance too?\n\nEven as a kid who lived to read all kinds of things, I knew better than to bother with anything written after 1917 in the Soviet Union. Tsarist Russia produced masterpieces by the likes of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Chekhov, but the USSR brought out touching love stories about a boy, a girl, and a tractor, novels with titles like Cement, and propagandistic tracts, disguised as fiction, that emphasized ‘positive’ heroes and conformed to the tenets of ‘socialist realism’. This was literature by committee, dull, lifeless, unimaginative, and all too politically correct.\n\nDirda seems to know everything – not just the book he is reviewing, but all the other works by the author, or by the subject, and by their contemporaries. He may be writing about a single book but there are generally half a dozen others mentioned in the same review. A piece on a biography of A.E. Housman left me wanting to read not just that, but also two volumes of his poetry, his letters, his selected prose and nine other books about Housman’s contemporaries. The review is little more than three pages long.\n\nWhich is how I finished this book with fifty new titles on my to-read list, spanning everything from solid biographies to fantasy novels. Thank goodness I’d already read some of these books (and even then it was mostly because Dirda also mentioned them in Browsings).\n\nDirda is very, very good at what he is doing. He does not aspire to be an artist on par with those he writes about (as he notes when writing about Martin Amis, “The English language just begs and rolls over at his command. Should you happen to be a writer yourself, or – God help you – a literary journalist, you suddenly know, with numbing clarity, just how Salieri felt when Mozart sashayed into Vienna.”); instead, his writing is the best sort of journalism, the kind that engages and excites while maintaining an elegance and crispness that delights those of us who enjoy clean and clever prose.\n\nIt also does not hurt that Dirda and I share a certain sensibility. He – like all the best readers and writers – is a romantic at heart as he proves in his introduction to the section called “Europeans”:\n\nOne of the pleasures of middle age – there aren’t many – lies in a growing appreciation for art that is urbane and refined. To be a man of the world is, in my mind, to be a courtly, music-loving intellectual living in Vienna or Prague during the final days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is the last glimmering of a now vanished era when you could still find yourself standing on the field of honor with a raised pistol, or attending a masked ball where the mistress of the emperor, her eyes wide, her breasts heaving, might squeeze your hand and whisper ‘tonight’.\n\nIt would have been nice to have more female writers – or subjects – represented but you can’t have everything. The period these reviews were drawn from was not a great one for female writers, and there is a strong focus on older fiction as well as biographies of historical figures so that is natural enough. It is a minor disappointment rather than a criticism.\n\nOne hundred reviews was not enough to satisfy me. A further twenty years have passed since the end of this collection – is it not time to put out another one? I know I have more of his books left to enjoy but it will be hard to match this.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe Lyttelton Hart-Davis Letters: Volume Five, 1960 edited by Rupert Hart-Davis (and published in 1983) has me nearing the end of the famous literary correspondence I began reading back in 2018. George Lyttelton had been publisher Rupert Hart-Davis’ schoolmaster at Eton; when the two men met as adults, the retired Lyttelon lamented that there was no one who wrote to him anymore – a challenge Hart-Davis happily took up. Both were passionate readers, annoyingly rabid cricket fans (thankfully Hart-Davis edited out the cricket talk after the first volume), dazzlingly well-connected, and rather snobbish. I wasn’t overwhelmed by the first volume of letters but since I dipped back in (I read volume two in December 2022 and have been steadily – but silently as far as the blog is concerned – reading since then) I’ve become ever fonder of these two.\n\nLike any literary correspondence, there is a certain amount of competitiveness between the two. Lyttelton is generally the sweeter and softer of the two, but still eager to score points where he can. Too often Hart-Davis is able to reply that yes, he’s heard that story before or chide Lyttelton for a misquote (a cardinal sin to these two) but every so often Lyttelton is able to share a gem with confidence that his younger friend won’t have found it first:\n\nOne good story I heard, which I hope you haven’t. Old Maugham, talking to a girls’ school about the art of writing short stories, told them that the essential ingredients were religion, sex, mystery, high rank, non-literary language and brevity. The schoolmistress next day told her young charges to try their hand at writing one according to this recipe. After a minute one raised her hand and said she had finished. The incredulous mistress told her to read it out, and she did: ‘My God!’, said the duchess, ‘I’m pregnant. I wonder who done it.’ That girl should surely go far. (GL, 24 August 1960)\n\nLiving a fairly quiet life in the country, Lyttelton is also able to read more broadly. By profession, Hart-Davis’ reading understandably focuses on the books he is looking to publish, but Lyttelton has the freedom to pick up whatever he likes. This can range from popular fiction – he is unable to resist Dr No: “By page 40 (as far as I have got in bed) JB has already foiled four attempts to kill him. Dr No is as incompetent as Professor Moriarty” – to the classics. He loathes Jane Austen but his fondness for Trollope emerges over and over again:\n\nAt Cambridge, I always find Trollope best for bedtime reading, after reading third-rate manuscripts all day. And shall I be lynched if I say how awfully bad The Warden seems to me? All its issues go below its surface – the whole business of John Bold and Eleanor is left in the air, and he does not succeed in persuading me, at least, that the Archdeacon is not essentially a man of four letters, which he appears to want to do. I forget whether you are a Trollope fan – or share perhaps Gosse’s distaste for ‘the listless amble’ of Trollope’s style? I wonder if anyone in England has all his novels. I have read scores, it seems, but am always coming across the names of many I haven’t. No second-hand bookshop ever has any beyond the Barchester lot. Odd. (GL, 6 January 1960)\n\nThis volume also contains a bit of interesting social history, as it covers the period of the Lady Chatterley trial. The two men firmly disagreed on the issue but I’m sure Lyttelton still enjoyed Hart-Davis’ dispatches from London, where he waited less than patiently to be used by the defence:\n\n…I have become a sort of Perpetual Twelfth Man for the defence witnesses. They never know whether any particular person is going to be five minutes in the box (EM Forster) or an hour and a half (Hough and Hoggart), so they keep having too few or too many witnesses waiting. At lunchtime on Thursday they thought they were going to run out, so sent out a three-line whip, as a result of which I sat from 2 till 4 gossiping with Tony Powell and Anne Scott-James. Asked to reappear at 10am on Friday, I found fifteen waiting. (RH-D, 29 October 1960)\n\nThrough friendships, work, and various societies they cross paths with a number of famous figures, some more interesting to me than others. But it is always a pleasure to have glimpses of Harold Nicolson, who I have been so fond of ever since I read his diaries and letters:\n\nWhat, if anything, makes you cry? I asked Harold Nicolson this question at the Lit. Soc. dinner, and he said: ‘Three things only – patriotism, injustice righted, and misunderstanding explained. Tragedy never.’ I agree whole-heartedly about patriotism: I can’t see the Queen on a newsreel without a lump in my throat; but am less sure about the other two. (RH-D, 12 March 1960)\n\nThe only sadness in finishing is realising that I have just one volume left.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nStarting off the new year with a book about old age isn’t the most obvious approach but These Vintage Years by Margot Benary-Isbert proved to be just the right way to start 2024. After all, what is aging but another adventure to be embarked upon, just like a new year:\n\n…I prefer to call old age, this time of vintage, an adventure, while others may call it a calamity. The different is that a calamity has to be endured passively; an adventure must be accepted. In both there are the same dangers: those that can be anticipated and those that are unexpected, real ones and imaginary ones. To accept the challenge of adventure means freedom; though every adventure involves risks. At the same time it is the unexpected, the new, the surprise, and for those who are brave enough to consent, a strong temptation.\n\nFittingly, the original German title for this when it was released in 1965 translates as “The Adventure of Aging” and that is very much the spirit in which Benary-Isbert, a popular author of children’s novels in both her native Germany and adopted homeland of America, writes. Born in 1889, she was in her mid-seventies when she wrote this, and was both seeking and providing guidance how to proceed gracefully and enjoyably.\n\nLittle of Benary-Isbert’s life had gone to plan and her retirement was no exception. The planning had begun well though:\n\nWhat a lot of plans we had when Ben stopped working in Chicago in 1955 and we moved to Santa Barbara! Once again we were starting a new venture in our life that had been so rich in changes. For the first time since our flight from the Benary family-place in 1945, when the Russians took over Thuringia, after ten years of homelessness we had acquired a small house of our own again. It had swallowed our meager savings, and we knew we would have to manage rather tightly until we could see whether my books in the United States and other countries would succeed well enough to supplement Ben’s social security income. This didn’t worry us more that it does young people who marry on uncertain income. Weren’t we experienced adventurers? In the thirty-eight years of marriage we had known poverty and wealth, hunger and cold, abundance and insecurity as well, and neither had meant much to us. After we had survived the threat of wars and inflations, of bombs and the Nazi menace, we felt that we had every reason to be full of hope and good cheer.\n\nSadly, just five weeks after arriving in Santa Barbara to begin their happy retirement Benary-Isbert’s husband died suddenly, leaving her alone in a strange place with no support network aside from a daughter who was overwhelmed with her own small children. The following years are dealt with in a few blunt sentences but, ten years on, it is clear she had learned how to live on her own and to find happiness. If there is one thing her life had prepared her for, it was change, and at least she was young enough to adapt to her new circumstances. She recalls the struggles of her parents’ generation to make a fresh start after the devastations of the Second World War:\n\nOur parents’ generation was too old for a new beginning when the war ended. For them, there remained only the letting go and the accepting – and how admirably did some of them achieve it. My father was in his ninth decade when he lost, in one night of bombing, all the material belongings he treasured: the comfortable old house where he had lived for forty years, the garden with his roses, the fruit trees, the lilac hedge, and the contents of his choice wine cellar. For his proud heart the hardest to bear was the financial dependence which was his lot after the currency reform. We never heard him complain about it.\n\nHaving enjoyed so many of Benary-Isbert’s books last year (chief among them The Ark), I loved the bits of her biography that are peppered through the book, but that’s not really the structure. It’s an odd mixture, with some of her own life and thoughts but much of the advice coming through lengthy excerpts from friends’ letters. Then there are then opinionated excerpts on how to monitor yourself for sloppy habit (what did 1960s American grandmothers made of her assumption that they would be out hiking as a primary source of exercise?), frank descriptions of dealings with not always satisfactory grandchildren, and randomly inserted exotic travel adventures accompanied by haikus (which I hope worked better in the original German than in the English translation). It is definitely a unique mix and I have no idea how it ever got published but I quite enjoyed it, both for the glimpse it gave me into Benary-Isbert’s life and for its still applicable advice about getting older. Benary-Isbert lived until 1979 and I hope she had many more adventures in those final years.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe greatest excitement of my Christmas was not any of the gifts I received, but the pleasure of finally having someone I love ask me to gift them a book. I am the only truly rabid reader in the family and always long to share favourite books with others but lack a receptive audience. But not only did my mother ask for a book, she asked for one of the best ones I’ve read this year: Homelands by Timothy Garton Ash.\n\nGarton Ash is a British journalist, historian, and academic, and, above all, fervent European. He studied and lived in Germany before the Wall fell and my first introduction to him was his excellent memoir, The File, in which he accesses his Stasi file and then sets out to speak to the informants and Stasi officers who compiled it. He has spent much of his life being passionately engaged with Central Europe and in Homelands he gives a very personal and always fascinating take on European history in his lifetime (he was born in 1955).\n\nHe does not attempt to be exhaustive – no one could be on this topic – but he still wants to be comprehensive. Frustrated by how the British choose to distance themselves from and deride their nearest neighbours, he rejoices in the complexities of the continent and the multitudes it contains:\n\nEurope, the real Europe, not the two-dimensional, black-and-white ‘Europe’ of British political debate, is a Gesamtkunstwerk, an all-embracing work of art, to borrow a term from Richard Wagner. This artwork has been created not by one megalomaniac composer but by millions of hands over thousands of years, and is constantly being remade. It comprises not just the familiar elements of traditional high culture but also fashion, food, drink, sport, popular music and local customs; the characteristic smells of a Mediterranean island, a Scandinavian fjord, a windswept Atlantic coast and crowded Italian restaurant; fifty subtly different ways of being a man or a woman, or of embracing some other sexual or gender identity; intricate, polychromatic local histories, all the way down to that of individual buildings. Ten thousand pages would scarcely begin this book of the real Europe.\n\nLanguages are certainly key to feeling more at home in Europe, but Britian has a history of indifference to if not downright suspicion of polyglots. While English is now fairly widely spoken, that’s a far more recent change (where it has indeed changed – German proved the most helpful language for most of my travels this year) and during Garton Ash’s youth and for the level of immersion he wanted, more languages were needed – and with each one he drew a little closer to being a European:\n\nAs was traditional for British schoolchildren, the first foreign language I learned was French. I still find it the most beautiful spoken language in the world. Then, thanks to my fascination with recent German history and Thomas Mann, it was on to German, learnt very systematically at the Goethe Institute in Prien am Chiemsee […] Unlike French or Italian, German does not have a worldwide reputation for elegance, but it can be both beautiful and profound. I have loved the language ever since. In my twenties, inspired by the dissident movement in Poland, I added Polish. With every language I learned, I became a bit more European, a bit more capable of seeing myself as another – to use a fine formulation of the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur – and more detached from the solid monolingual certainties of my father’s England.\n\nI particularly enjoyed Garton Ash’s thoughts on Central Europe. He became very engaged with the Polish dissidents under communism (indeed, he picked up his Polish wife during this period) and is clearly the most informed writer I’ve come across in talking about what life was like under communism:\n\n…someone who gets their ideas from the film The Lives of Others could come away with the impression that life behind the Wall was all about secret police oppression and that people were somehow just waiting and yearning for the moment of liberation. It was not like that. Most people could not imagine how liberation could ever happen. The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which extinguished the hopes of the Prague Spring, was still fresh in everyone’s mind. How on earth could you get rid of a nuclear-armed superpower that was ready to send in tanks to crush you?\n\nHe is equally good when talking about what life was like in those countries after the fall of communism, when security was traded for freedom and many people found themselves scared by their new circumstances. He recounts conversations with working Poles about their anxieties in this brave new world, but also with Pope John Paul II, who told him “the trouble with capitalism and communism is that I dislike the one almost as much as the other” during a conversation, in Polish naturally, at the Pope’s summer residence in 1987 – a feeling the Pope would continue to express through the 1990s as his countrymen became ever more enthralled by the shallow pleasures of materialism.\n\nEurope has changed dramatically over Garton Ash’s lifetime. It has emerged from the devastation of the Second World War, it has suffered through oppression under Soviet rule but also home-grown dictators in Greece, Spain, and Portugal, it has miraculously come together to create an era of peace, democracy and prosperity, and now – with Britain abandoning the EU, a war raging on its Eastern edge, and right-wing populism on the rise across the continent – seems on the cusp of yet more change. But change is a constant and, as Garton Ash hopefully notes, “the gamble of civilisation is that we can learn from the past without having to go through it all again ourselves.”\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nIt is impossible for me to review The World-Ending Fire: The Essential Wendell Berry. I read this collection of essays at the beginning of August and it was one of the most engaging reading experiences I have had in years. I stuck in endless scraps of paper as I read, wanting to mark down ideas to return to, quotes I wanted to keep, and passages that perfectly expressed what I thought or which I wanted more time to formulate my opposition to. Stretching from the 1960s to the 2010s, this collection shows Berry in all his forms – writer, environmentalist, Kentucky farmer, citizen – and related passions and, as usual, I find the combination of passion and commonsense irresistible. But entirely unreviewable.\n\nInstead, I share a few of the passages that have lingered in my mind. Berry is rightly popular for his impassioned defense of the environment, of a simpler way of life, of community and of personal responsibility. Part of what made the reading experience so enjoyable, beyond the joy of encountering someone so thoughtful and articulate, was how deeply so much of what he wrote resonated. Here are a few of the excerpts that I have not been able to forget:\n\nWe have lived by the assumption that what was good for us would be good for the world. And this has been based on the even flimsier assumption that we could know with any certainty what was good even for us. We have fulfilled the danger of this by making our personal pride and greed the standard of our behaviour toward the world – to the incalculable disadvantage of the world and every living thing in it. And now, perhaps very close to too late, our great error has become clear. It is not only our own creativity – our own capacity for life – that is stifled by our arrogant assumption; the creation itself is stifled. (“A Native Hill”- 1968)\n\nAs a lover of history, our obliviousness to and arrogance about our own role in it is an endless source of fascination and frustration to me, so I loved this passage:\n\nThere is also the Territory of historical self-righteousness: if we had lived south of the Ohio in 1830s, we would not have owned slaves; if we had lived on the frontier, we would have killed no Indians, violated no treaties, stolen no land. The probability is overwhelming that if we had belonged to the generations we deplore, we too would have behaved deplorably. The probability is overwhelming that we belong to a generation that will be found by its successors to have behaved deplorably. Not to know that is, again, to be in error and to neglect essential work, and some of this work, as before, is work of the imagination. How can we imagine our situation or our history if we think we are superior to it? (“Writer and Region” – 1987)\n\nThis passage – this entire livid but humorous essay, really, which is a response to mail received after an essay about him not getting a computer and his wife continuing to type his work – was extraordinarily good. Berry is passionate about relationships and sees the strength that comes when there is trust and dependency between people, whether they be member of a community or a marriage:\n\nMarriage, in what is evidently its most popular version, is now on the one hand an ‘intimate’ relationship involving (Ideally) two successful careerists in the same bed, and on the other hand a sort of private political system in which rights and interests must be constantly asserted and defended. Marriage, in other words, has now taken the form of divorce: a prolonged and impassioned negotiation as to how things shall be divided. During their understandably temporary association, the ‘married’ couple will typically consume a large quantity of merchandise and a large portion of each other.\n\n…\n\nThere are, however, still some married couples who understand themselves as belonging to their marriage, to each other, and to their children. What they have they have in common, and so, to them, helping each other does not seem merely to damage their ability to compete against each other. To them, ‘mine’ is not so powerful or necessary a pronoun as ‘ours’. (“Feminism, the Body, and the Machine” – 1989)\n\nPerhaps the quote I have most cause to pull out and share with my friends and family:\n\nChildren, no matter how nurtured at home, must be risked to the world. And parenthood is not an exact science, but a vexed privilege and a blessed trial, absolutely necessary and not altogether possible. (“Family Work” – 1980)\n\nHow better to conclude this non-review with simple instructions for how to live:\n\nWe must achieve the character and acquire the skills to live much poorer than we do. We must want less. We must do more for ourselves and each other. It is either that or continue merely to think and talk about changes that we are inviting catastrophe to make. (“Word and Flesh” – 1989)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nMost writers tell us something of who they are in their work. The more they write, the more we uncover what they care about, how they see the world, and the influences that shaped them. But it is the role of biography to fill in the blanks for us and from my earliest years as a reader that is always what I have wanted: the complete picture. I have learned about troubled people who write with joyful lightness, about lonely ones who feel entirely warm and open on the page, and, rarely, those who seem to entirely match the image I had formed of them when I read their books. The magnificent Shirley Hazzard: a Writing Life by Brigitta Olubas gave me a new and wonderful perspective on an author I already liked and now both respect and admire.\n\nBorn in Australia in 1931, Hazzard realised while young that she was in the wrong place, surrounded by the wrong people. Provincial, small-minded Sydney and her fractious family were the opposite of the articulate cosmopolitan world she longed for – a world of Ideas and Culture and History. Knowing that the intellectual richness you long for does exist in the world, just very, very far away, can feel taunting – even in the internet age we can still feel that. But Hazzard achieved it. She created the life she wanted, moving around the world to find purpose and art and romance.\n\nSo much of that early life is there in her two greatest novels. The Transit of Venus, about two Australian sisters who start new lives in England after the Second World War, echoes her own fresh start and period of bouncing through love affairs. The Great Fire, written later in life, when Hazzard was gentler on her readers and herself, looks back to her own first romance. It was fascinating to see the inspiration for these novels, but more interesting still to fill in the blanks around them.\n\nFor Hazzard, New York was the gateway to the life she dreamed of. It wasn’t the culmination of her dreams but it was where she began to piece together the life she wanted. She moved there in 1951 with her mother and sister and began work for the United Nations, an organization she would become a vocal critic of but which put the world on her doorstep. Most importantly, through a series of wonderful events, it took her to Italy. Going there for the first time was the definitive moment in her life: ‘From the first day, everything changed. I was restored to life and power and thought.” The story of how it happened is so perfectly romantic it could have come from one of her novels:\n\n“Auden said in that beautiful poem about Yeats that poetry altered nothing, that all the savagery of the world would be the same if no poet had ever written. But I know from my own small experience that it can change life radically. Poetry came me companionship; it opened my mind and my heart – as far as they cold be opened. It also changed the facts of my life.\n\nWhen I was living in New Zealand in 1949, I read poems of Leopardi in translation by John Heath-Stubbs and I wanted to learn the originals: they were so beautiful. I remember it was a blue book.\n\nI began to read Italian, 12,000 miles away without expectations of going to Italy. Later, it was because I had studied Italian that I was sent there by the United Nations and everything changed.”\n\nNo wonder it was a story she never tired of retelling.\n\nOlubas is the kind of biographer I most enjoy. She is a great appreciator of Hazzard’s work and seems fond of her as a person, but does not intrude her own opinions. She does not attempt to make judgements about Hazzard, and I suspect not many modern biographers would be so restrained when it comes to Hazzard’s pattern of unsuitable romances with older men. Nor should she, since Hazzard did eventually find great happiness and companionship with Francis Steegmuller, a fellow author twenty-five years older than her. From all accounts, they were a wonderful couple with matching sensibilities, as recalled by the writer Steve M.L. Aronson who met them in 1969:\n\nIt was a literary gathering at which, Aronson observed, the Steegmullers stood out, not because they were less famous than the others, although that was true. But where the other guests, even in conversation, were somehow ‘out to gain advantage over each other, like “literary politicians”, the Steegmullers exemplified a “gentler sensibility”, content to let their work speak for itself. There was a combination of connectedness – mixing with the most exclusive literary circles of New York – and reserve, a detachment, even aloofness, a decision, or choice, not to belong, and this combination would come, over the years, to define their social lives.\n\nHazzard herself, whose formality on the page could give the impression of a distant and imperious personality, seems to have been full of old-fashioned kindness and courtesy, attentive to everyone around her, “whether it involved a New York dinner party or thanking (and generously tipping) a custodian who had opened a locked church door so one could admire a neglected example of Neapolitan baroque architecture. She was tirelessly humane.” These were increasingly rare virtues even in her era and seem vanished now.\n\nThere is so much that is relatable and, to me, admirable in Hazzard. I at least live in the Northern Hemisphere and, more importantly, in the uber-connected 21st Century. For more than a decade, blogging has been a way for me to access some sort of intellectual life in the absence of real-life people who care about the things I do. Vancouver is many things, but a center of great culture is not one of them. I can live with that. I love my home for what it is and have made my peace with a largely solitary intellectual life. But when I was younger, when the internet was still limited, everything I wanted to have in my life felt so desperately far away and unreachable. That is what makes Hazzard so dazzling to me: she did something with that feeling. She consciously built up a life and filled it with all the things she had known she needed since those early days in Australia.\n\nI’ve hardly done justice to the excellence of Olubas’ work, of the extensive letters, diaries, writings, and interviews she masterfully draws on to the create her portrait, and of her own compelling writing that draws you eagerly along through Hazzard’s life. It has been far too long since I’ve read a biography of this quality and though I read it back in January it still stands out as one of the best things I’ve read not just this year but in the last several years.\n\nRead Full Post »"
