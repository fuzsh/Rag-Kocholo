One day in October 1930, a needy young man who suffered from tuberculosis came to visit Christians in Hamamatsu to ask for help. Young Christians built him a wooden hut and gave him a good nursing care. the history of Seirei group started from this humble hut. Since its inception, the Seirei Gakuen Educational Organization has been promoting the Bible’s philosophy of “Dignity of Life” and “Love thy Neighbor” which it continues to use in its educational practices today. Seirei Christopher University plays a starring role in education and research in the Seirei Group. Their first activity was started by young Christians back in May 1930 when they helped a homeless tubercular patient using their belief of “Love thy Neighbor” from the Christian Philosophy. SCU cultivates professionals in the fields of healthcare and social work with the spirit of human dignity and neighborly love.
