        "text": "Japanese Education System Facts: Kindergartens are compulsory | Fact No. 1\n\nKindergarten in Japan is compulsory, and usually children start going there at the age of three.\n\nAlready in kindergarten, Japanese kids master the basics of arithmetic and can read Hiragana and Katakana (syllable systems).\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: Manners are first, then knowledge | Fact No. 2\n\nJapanese schoolchildren do not pass exams until the 4th grade (when they are 10 years old), and they just complete some form of small test.\n\nIt is believed that in the first three years of study, academic knowledge is not the most important thing.\n\nThe emphasis is on upbringing. Children are taught to respect other people and animals, to be generous, the ability to sympathize, to search for truth, have self-control, and to respect nature.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: School begins on April 1 each year | Fact No. 3\n\nWhen in most countries, children graduate school, the Japanese start to study. The beginning of the year coincides with one of the most beautiful phenomena — the flowering of sakura.\n\nSo, they tune in in a sublime and serious way. The academic year consists of three trimesters: from April 1 to July 20, from September 1 to December 26, and from January 7 to March 25.\n\nThus, the Japanese have a rest for six weeks in a summer vacation and for two weeks in winter and spring.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: There are no cleaners in Japanese schools | Fact No. 4\n\nEach class takes turns cleaning classrooms, corridors, and even toilets. In this way, kids from an early age learn to work in a team and help each other.\n\nIn addition, after schoolchildren have spent so much time and effort on cleaning, they are unlikely to litter. This teaches them to respect their work, as well as the work of other people, and respect the environment.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: Standardized meals for all students | Fact No. 5\n\nIn schools, only standardized meals are prepared, which children eat in the classroom along with other students\n\nIn the Land of the Rising Sun, schoolchildren are not allowed to bring food or even certain types of medications, such as ordinary sore throat sweets, which are considered a complete snack.\n\nIn primary and secondary schools for children, special lunches are prepared, and the menus of which are developed not only by cooks, but also by medical workers, so that the food is as healthy as possible.\n\nAll classmates have lunch with the teacher in the classroom. In such an informal environment, they communicate more and build friendly relations.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: Additional education is hugely popular | Fact No. 6\n\nAlready in elementary school, children begin to attend private and preparatory schools in order to get into a good secondary school, and then into a high school.\n\nClasses are held in such places in the evenings, and in Japan there is a very typical phenomenon, where at 9 PM the public transport is filled by children who hurry home after additional lessons.\n\nThey even study on Sundays and on holidays, given that on average the school day lasts from six to eight hours. It is not surprising that according to the statistics in Japan, there are almost no scholars who held back.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: Main subjects | Fact No. 7\n\nThe main subjects in the schools of Japan are mathematics, Japanese, social sciences, craft, music, and physical education.\n\nNow most elementary schools have begun teaching English. Schoolchildren study healthy lifestyle, computer science, music, art, physical education, and home economics, as well as traditional arts, such as calligraphy and haiku.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: Students learn the art of Japanese calligraphy and poetry | Fact No. 8\n\nThe principle of Japanese calligraphy, or shodo, is very simple: a bamboo brush is dipped in ink and character symbols are drawn on rice paper with smooth strokes.\n\nIn Japan, shodo is valued no less than ordinary painting. And haiku is a national form of poetry that concisely represents nature and man as a whole.\n\nBoth subjects reflect one of the principles of Eastern aesthetics — the ratio of simplicity and elegance. Classes teach children to appreciate and respect their culture with its age-old traditions.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: All students must wear a uniform | Fact No. 9\n\nStarting from middle school, each student is required to wear a uniform. Many schools have their own form, but traditionally for boys these are clothes in military style, and for girls, sailor suits.\n\nThe rule is designed to discipline students, because the clothing itself creates a working attitude. Also, the same form helps to unify classmates.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: Appearance rules | Fact No. 10\n\nMost schools have strict rules regarding hair color. Only natural hair color is acceptable for schoolchildren.\n\nIn many public and private schools, boys are not allowed to wear long hair, as only a neat and short haircut is allowed.\n\nRules for girls include: walking without curls, cosmetics, nail polish, and jewelry (except for watches). Students may wear only white, black, or dark blue socks.\n\nIf a student has put on, for example, brown socks, which is against school rules, then this piece of clothing can be confiscated.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: School attendance rate is 99.99% | Fact No. 11\n\nIt is difficult to imagine one person who has never in his or her life skipped classes at school, but here is a whole nation of people who haven’t.\n\nAlso, Japanese schoolchildren are almost never late for class. And 91% of students always listen to the teacher. What other country can boast of similar statistics?\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: No phones | Fact No. 12\n\nWithin the Japanese school, students are not allowed to use mobile phones. Pupils can use the phone in the parking lot before entering the school between lessons or after them.\n\nIf the teacher notices a phone in class, then he or she will definitely confiscate it.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: No school bus | Fact No. 13\n\nUniversity students drive cars. In Japan, there is no such thing as a school bus. Students walk, ride a bike, or use public transport. Pupils go to primary school in small groups.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: The results of one final exam decide everything | Fact No. 14\n\nAt the end of high school, students must take one test that decides whether they will enroll in college or not. A graduate can choose only one institution, and the size of the future salary and the standard of living in general will be determined by the choice.\n\nThe competition is very high: 76% of graduates continue their education after school. That is why the expression “exam hell” is popular in Japan.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: University years are the best vacations in life | Fact No. 15\n\nIt is not surprising that after many years of continuous preparation for admission and the “exam hell,” students want to take a short break.\n\nIt turns out that it happens during the university years, which are considered the easiest and most carefree in the life of every Japanese person.\n\nIt is excellent rest before work, to which the Japanese have taught since childhood to approach not only with responsibility, but also with great love.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: For all students under the age of 18, a curfew is set at 10 PM | Fact No. 16\n\nRules may vary in different cities. However, a curfew is imposed in Tokyo and Yokohama – 10 PM. Children under 18 are not allowed to visit the cinema and slot machines after 10 PM.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: History reference | Fact No. 17\n\nEducation in Japan has a long history. Until the 8th century, it was built on the models of China and Korea.\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century, Buddhist teaching began to spread in the country, and along with it, philosophy, science, astrology, and visual arts.\n\nA little later, thanks to the emperor Tenji, the first imperial school appeared.\n\nBy the 8th century, the Japanese interacted closely with China, in which the Tang clan ruled. Thanks to these connections, the educational system of China was adopted in Japan.\n\nAt the time the Japanese capital city was Nara, and there the Academy was established. At the end of the 8th century, the capital was moved to Kyoto, but this system remained the same.\n\nIn the next four centuries, up to the twelfth century, the Chinese system flourished: in institutions they taught writing systems and literary reading. At the same time, two types of syllabary appeared:\n\nkatakana\n\nHiragana\n\nChildren from noble families attended classes in provincial and monastic schools. The children of the poor went to special institutions where they were taught reading, writing, counting, and basic technical skills.\n\nAfter this period, education on the model of the Middle Kingdom had become obsolete. Shortly after, private and home schools began to appear in Japan.\n\nOften, ordinary people were taught in the temples of the growing Buddhist teachings of Zen.\n\nMuch has changed since World War II. The Japanese borrowed some features in the educational structure from France, the UK, and the USA.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: Juku | Fact No. 18\n\nJuku is a unique phenomenon of Japanese schools. This is a kind of tutoring school. They are visited by almost all students of middle and high levels.\n\nThere are two types of juku:\n\nAcademic — teachers fix knowledge on school subjects or provide material that students do not learn in lessons.\n\nNon-academic — teachers work on the disclosure and development of students’ talents. Kids can do different types of activities based on their own wishes — the art of ikebana, judo, the basics of the tea ceremony, theatrical performances, singing, and board games.\n\nChildren attend juku in the evening after school three to four times a week.\n\nJapanese Education System Facts: How to enroll in a Japanese university if you are a foreigner | Fact No. 19\n\nThe first thing you need to do before enrolling is to get a sufficient amount of money, since it will not work to recoup the costs of studying by working and studying at the same time.\n\nThere are very few options for how to study in Japan for free: no more than 200 people a year win grants for budget places, and there are over 2.8 million students (and all of them are local, that is, Japanese citizens).\n\nIn addition, it is necessary to complete preparatory courses for at least two semesters, preferably in Japan itself, and then prepare the documents.\n\nTry to immediately determine whether you intend to continue your studies at the master’s level, since there are practically no opportunities to transfer from one university to another after admission.\n\nAlso get proof of the fact that at home you have been studying for at least 12 years, and submit documents!\n\nIf you are over 18 years old and have no problems with obtaining a visa (such as criminal convictions, dangerous diseases, etc.), you will be allowed to take the general examinations for all foreigners, namely\n\nHigher Education Qualifications in Japan\n\nJapanese higher education caters to pupils from novices to advanced.
