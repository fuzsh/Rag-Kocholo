        "text": "The human spinal column is a dynamic, segmented, bony, and cartilaginous structure that is essential for integrating the brain and nervous system with the axial skeleton while simultaneously providing flexibility in three dimensions (Richards et al., 2020). Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common developmental disorder of the spine, typically appearing during the adolescent growth spurt. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is reported in all major ancestral groups, with a population prevalence of 1.5–3% (Wise, 2014; Hresko, 2013). Children with AIS usually present with a characteristic right-thoracic major curve pattern and a compensatory lumbar curve. Major thoracolumbar and lumbar curves are less frequent (Richards et al., 2020). The three-dimensional nature of the deformity results in torsion in the spine that is most significant at the apex of the major curve, and changes in the structures of the vertebrae and ribs may develop as the curve worsens or progresses (Richards et al., 2020). Children with thoracic curves, with larger curves at first presentation, and/or with greater remaining growth potential are at increased risk of progression, but this risk decreases sharply after skeletal maturity (Richards et al., 2020). Sex is a recognized risk factor for AIS, with girls having at least a fivefold greater risk of progressive deformity requiring treatment compared to boys (Karol et al., 1993). This well-documented sexual dimorphism has prompted speculation that levels of circulating endocrine hormones, particularly estrogen, are important exposures in AIS susceptibility (Liang et al., 2021).\n\nThe genetic architecture of human AIS is complex, and underlying disease mechanisms remain uncertain. Heritability studies of Northern European (Wynne-Davies, 1968; Grauers et al., 2012), North American (Riseborough and Wynne-Davies, 1973; Kruse et al., 2012), and South Asian (Tang et al., 2012) ancestral groups suggest that disease risk is multifactorial, caused by genetic and environmental contributions (Wise, 2014; Wise et al., 2020). Accordingly, population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in multiple ancestral groups have identified several AIS-associated susceptibility loci, mostly within non-coding genomic regions (Wise et al., 2020). In particular, multiple GWAS have implicated non-coding regions near the LBX1 (Takahashi et al., 2011), ADGRG6 (also known as GRP126) (Kou et al., 2013), and BNC2 (Ogura et al., 2015) genes. An association with alleles in an enhancer distal to PAX1, encoding the transcription factor paired box 1, was primarily driven by females, suggesting that it contributes to the sexual dimorphism observed in AIS (Sharma et al., 2015). Subsequent meta-analysis of combined AIS GWAS identified additional susceptibility loci. These included variants in an intron of SOX6, a transcription factor, that along with PAX1, is important in early spinal column formation (Smits and Lefebvre, 2003). Furthermore, gene enrichment analyses found significant correlation of AIS-associated loci with biological pathways involving cartilage and connective tissue development (Khanshour et al., 2018). A more recent GWAS in a Japanese population identified 14 additional AIS loci that are candidates for further evaluation (Kou et al., 2019). In separate studies, genome sequencing in AIS cases and families identified enrichment of rare variants in the COL11A2 (Haller et al., 2016) and HSPG2 (Baschal et al., 2014) genes, encoding components of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Hence, variation affecting cartilage and connective tissue ECM is an emerging theme in the heterogeneous genetic architecture of AIS.\n\nPre-clinical animal models are essential tools for accelerating mechanistic understanding of AIS and for therapeutic testing (Wise et al., 2020). In zebrafish, several genetic mutants with larval or later-onset spinal deformity have been described, including ptk7 (Hayes et al., 2014; Van Gennip et al., 2018), c21orf59 (Jaffe et al., 2016), ccdc40 (Becker-Heck et al., 2011), ccdc151 (Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2011), dyx1c1, and kif6 (Konjikusic et al., 2018). In rescue experiments, Rebello et al. recently showed that missense variants in COL11A2 associated with human congenital scoliosis fail to rescue a vertebral malformation phenotype in a zebrafish col11a2 knockout line (Rebello et al., 2023). In mouse, conditional deletion of Adgrg6 in skeletal cartilage (using Col2a1-Cre) produces a progressive scoliosis of the thoracic spine during postnatal development that is marked by herniations within the cartilaginous endplates of involved vertebrae. Progressive scoliosis, albeit to a lesser extent, was also observed when Adgrg6 was deleted from committed chondrocytes (using ATC:Cre) (Long et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021). These studies demonstrate that cartilage and possibly other osteochondroprogenitor cells contribute to the scoliosis phenotype in these models (Liu et al., 2019). Taken together, genetic and functional studies in mouse, although limited, support the hypothesis that deficiencies in biogenesis and/or homeostasis of cartilage, intervertebral disc (IVD), and dense connective tissues undermine the maintenance of proper spinal alignment during the adolescent growth spurt (Wise et al., 2020).\n\nThe combined contribution of reported AIS-associated variants is broadly estimated to account for less than 10% of the overall genetic risk of the disease (Kou et al., 2019). To address this knowledge gap, we sought to define novel loci associated with AIS susceptibility in genes encoding proteins of the ECM (i.e. the ‘matrisome’; Naba et al., 2012b; Naba et al., 2012a). Here, we identify new genetic associations with AIS. Further, our functional assessments support a new disease model wherein AIS-associated genetic variation and estrogen signaling perturb a PAX1-COL11a1-MMP3 axis in chondrocytes.\n\nAIS has been described in the medical literature for centuries, yet its underlying etiology has remained enigmatic (Wise and Sharma, 2010). Given that AIS originates in children who appear to be otherwise healthy, even its tissue of origin has been difficult to discern, and long debated (Wise et al., 2020). The advent of powerful genotyping and sequencing methods in the last two decades has led to breakthrough discoveries of genetic loci associated with AIS, most in non-coding regions of the genome that are difficult to interpret biologically (Wise et al., 2020). Aggregating these results, however, provided supportive evidence that pathways of cartilage and connective tissue ECM development are relevant in AIS etiology (Wise et al., 2020; Khanshour et al., 2018). Here, in the largest multi-ethnic human cohort studied to date, we elected to test the hypothesis that alterations in ECM proteins themselves contribute to AIS susceptibility. This approach yielded most significant evidence for a common protein-altering variant in the COL11A1 gene encoding collagen α1(XI), a minor yet critical component of cartilaginous ECM. Moreover, our studies define a COL11A1-mediated disease pathway (Figure 7) and point to the chondro-osseous junction of IVD and vertebrae spine as a relevant cellular compartment in AIS etiology.\n\nFigure 7\n\nThe results of this study together with the previous observation of COL11A2 rare variant enrichment in AIS support a role for the collagen α1(XI) heterotrimer itself in its pathogenesis (Haller et al., 2016). Collagen type XI, composed of three chains encoded by the COL11A1, COL11A2, and COL2A1 genes (OMIM #s 120280,120290, 120140, respectively), is a minor component of collagen type II fibrils that are abundant in cartilage. Collagen type XI is also broadly expressed in testis, trachea, tendons, trabecular bone, skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, brain neuroepithelium, the vitreous of the eye, and IVDs (Yoshioka et al., 1995). In the pericellular space, collagen α1(XI) initiates fibrillogenesis with collagen type II fibrils, maintaining regular spacing and diameter of the collagen fibrils, while organizing the pericellular surface by interaction with cartilage proteoglycans (Smith et al., 1989; Luo and Karsdal, 2019). Purified human collagen type XI, when added back to chondrocytes in in vitro culture, stimulates chondrogenesis while inhibiting hypertrophy, as measured by histological staining, proliferation assays, and relative expression of chondrogenic early marker genes (Li et al., 2018). In newborn and 1-month-old mice, we found that collagen α1(XI) was abundant in IVD and at the chondro-osseous junction of IVD and vertebrae, particularly concentrated in pre-hypertrophic/hypertrophic chondrocytic cells. In long bone growth plates, Long et al., 2022, recently identified eight distinct cell clusters after unsupervised analysis of single cell (scRNAseq) of flow-sorted hypertrophic chondrocytes from Col10a1Cre;Rosa26fs-tdTomato mice. At E16.5, Col11a1 expression was highest in cells with signatures of pre-hypertrophic to hypertrophic transition, and lowest in cells with osteogenic signatures (M Hilton, personal communication) (Long et al., 2022). Taken together, these results suggest that collagen α1(XI) normally participates in maintaining growth plate cells in a hypertrophic, pre-osteogenic state, although little is known about its precise molecular function in that compartment, or in the IVD, during spinal development. Spines of Col11a1-deficient mice (cho/cho) show incompletely formed vertebral bodies, spinal curvatures, and decreased separation between vertebrae, which are themselves less mineralized than in wild-type mice (Hafez et al., 2015). Notably, common COL11A1 variants also have been associated with adult lumbar disc herniation and lumbar disc degeneration, as well as DXA-measured bone size, spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis (Jiang et al., 2017; Mio et al., 2007; Styrkarsdottir et al., 2019). Although gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects of the rs3753841 variant would not have been revealed in our assays, the spinal deformity noted in the cho/cho loss-of-function model, and failure of missense variants in Col11a2 to rescue congenital scoliosis (Rebello et al., 2023), leads us to surmise that reduction in the components of collagen type XI disrupts spinal development.\n\nPax1 is a well-described marker of early spine development, where it activates a gene expression cascade starting at E12.5–13.5 in mouse development (Wilm et al., 1998; Rodrigo et al., 2003; Sivakamasundari et al., 2017). Our data showed that loss of Pax1 leads to decreased expression of Col11a1, Sox6, and Adgrg6 in E12.5 tails of both male and female mice. The downregulation of Col11a1 is consistent with a prior study of gene expression in flow-sorted GFP-labeled Pax1-/- embryonic IVD cells (Sivakamasundari et al., 2017). However, from these experiments we cannot discern if Pax1 directly regulates Col11a1 in cis, or by an indirect effect. It is likely, however, that Col11a1 expression in developing tail is directly activated by binding SOX transcription factors, as a prior genomic study using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing in rat chondrosarcoma cells identified super enhancers near the Col11a1 gene that were bound multiple times by SOX9 and SOX6 (Liu and Lefebvre, 2015). The SOX5/6/9 trio is known to regulate many of the same genes as PAX1 (Sivakamasundari et al., 2017), but whether this includes Col11a1 is unknown.\n\nIn mouse postnatal spines, we observed co-localization of collagen α1(XI) and PAX1 proteins specifically within the cartilaginous endplate-vertebral junction region that includes the vertebral growth plate. The endplate, which is important as the site allowing diffusion of nutrients from the circulation into the avascular inner IVD, harbors subpopulations of cells expressing type II collagen presumably organized by collagen type XI (Chan et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2011). While the endplate is continuous with the vertebral growth plate in mice, it is important to note that in humans the endplate and vertebrae become distinctly separate structures with closure of the growth plates at puberty (Chan et al., 2014). This is also the site of the ring apophyses that form the insertion of the IVD into vertebrae (Costa et al., 2021). Lagging maturity of the ring apophysis, combined with mechanical forces across the IVD in the horizontal plane, has been proposed as an initiating factor leading to rotatory decompensation in the adolescent spine in AIS (Costa et al., 2021; Castelein et al., 2020). Recently, Sun et al. reported the discovery of a vertebral skeletal stem cell (vSSC) residing in the endplate and marked by expression of the genes Zic1 and Pax1, along with other cell surface markers (Sun et al., 2023). These vSSCs also express high levels of Col11a1 (M Greenblatt, personal communication). It is interesting to consider that AIS-associated variation in collagenα1(XI), perhaps together with mechanical forces, could alter the differentiation trajectory of this cell niche. Altogether, extant data and our results strongly suggest that cell populations at the IVD-vertebral junction region are relevant in AIS pathogenesis. Further investigation is warranted to understand the developmental programs of cells in this region of the spine.\n\nMatrix metalloproteinase 3, also known as stromolysin, is a secreted enzyme expressed in connective tissues and in regions of endochondral ossification (Ortega et al., 2004). MMP3 has degradative activity toward a variety of ECM components, including proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, but notably not type I collagen (Sellers and Murphy, 1981). Additionally, in chondrocytes MMP3 also has been shown to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) by binding to an element known as transcription enhancer dominant in chondrocytes (TRENDIC) (Eguchi et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2017). Our observations of a Col11a1-Mmp3 signaling axis in chondrocytes and CEP cells raise the possibility that Col11a1 variation may have consequences for both MMP3 enzymatic activity levels and MMP3-mediated transcriptional programming in these cells. COL11A1 missense variants, usually altering glycine or proline in Gly-X-Y repeats in the collagen α1(XI) helical domain as with COL11A1P1335L, are reported to be frequent in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and have been linked to transcriptional changes and tumor invasiveness (Lee et al., 2021). The mechanisms by which chondrocytes or other cells sense such single amino acid changes in collagen α1(XI) and induce subsequent transcriptional responses are unknown but may involve direct interaction with integrins in the pericellular space (Lee et al., 2021).\n\nWe found that Col11a1 expression is sensitive to estrogen receptor blockade or knockdown in chondrocytes. Type XI collagen is also a key player in organizing the pericellular space, which is critical for transmitting mechanical forces from the ECM to the cell (Xu et al., 2016). Thus, it is interesting to consider that type XI collagen may effectively act as a receptor for environmental cues, i.e., mechanical forces and estrogen signaling, in the adolescent spine. Our study provides new insights into the regulation and signaling role of Col11a1 in chondrocytes, and it suggests potential mechanisms by which its genetic variation contributes to AIS susceptibility."
