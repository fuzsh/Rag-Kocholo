Methods Total 161 eyes of 161 healthy junior high school students were prospectively studied. Optical AL and anterior chamber depth (ACD) measurements, and fundus photography were performed in the first and third grades. Eyes of subjects in the first and third grade that had perfect matching among all the retinal vessels were allocated to the RVS(−) group, otherwise allocated to the RVS(+) group. In the RVS(+) group, the peripapillary retinal arteries angle (PRAA) was measured for quantitative analysis of RVS; the angle between the major retinal arteries. The variables related to PRAA were identified using model selection with the corrected Akaike information criterion.   Results Forty-two eyes (26.1%) were allocated to the RVS(+) group. There were seven patterns in the RVS of those in the RVS(+) group, including clockwise shift in the supra temporal area (5 eyes), infra temporal area (7 eyes), and nasal area (9 eyes); anticlockwise shift in the supra temporal area (7 eyes), infra temporal area (5 eyes), and nasal area (2 eyes); and distal shift in the temporal area (7 eyes). The optimal model for the PRAA narrowing included larger AL and body weight in the first grade, and greater AL elongation.   Conclusion Various (seven) RVS patterns were observed in about 25% of the junior high school students within two years. RVS was associated with AL elongation, and useful to reveal the mechanism of myopic retinal stretch.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn the current study, fundus photography along with body height, body weight, and AL measurements were prospectively performed for two years in 161 eyes of 161 junior high school students. We observed RVS in 42 eyes (26.1%). Among these eyes, the patterns in 5 eyes were categorized as supra temporal clockwise, in 7 eyes as infra temporal clockwise, in 9 eyes as nasal clockwise, in 7 eyes as supra temporal anticlockwise, in 5 eyes as infra temporal anticlockwise, in 2 eyes as nasal anticlockwise, and in 7 eyes as temporal distal shift. AL was significantly longer in subjects from both groups while in the third grade than that during the first grade. The optimal model for the change in PRAA suggested that narrowing of PRAA was associated with larger AL in the first grade, greater elongation of AL, and greater body weight in the first grade.\n\nIn the current study, body height and weight were significantly greater in the third grade as compared to that in the first grade, as expected. In addition, AL was significantly longer in the third grade as compared to that in the first grade with average differences of 0.30 mm and 0.29 mm in the for RVS(+) and RVS(−) groups, respectively. We have recently reported that AL increases even in adults (mean age: 61 years old, range 32–88 years) by 0.031 mm in 5 years on an average [27]. The observation period in the current study was 2 years, suggesting that AL elongation between the ages of 12 and 14 was much greater than that during adulthood [27]. Greater AL elongation was associated with longer AL (Table 2). This relationship between AL elongation and longer baseline AL implies that elongated eyes may have a weaker collagen structure and tend to elongate easily. This current result coincides with previous reports of high myopia at baseline being a risk factor for myopic progression [28,29]. Our previous study showed an opposite trend in a glaucoma cohort [27]. This may be because the previous study consisted of adults with complete growth of eyeballs; thus, the elongation of an eyeball in the studied cohort was not identical to the growth of an eyeball in children.\n\nIn the current study, no significant differences in AL and ΔAL were observed between the RVS(+) and RVS(−) group. This may be because of the manifold mechanisms involved in eye growth. In general, eye growth occurs in the following three patterns: 1) proportional growth of all the dimensions leading to a spheroidal shape; 2) predominant elongation of the anterior-posterior axis; or 3) a local elongation of the posterior pole by a posterior staphyloma [30,31]. In patterns 2 and 3, the changes can make the curve of the arcade vessel steeper and narrower [7,30,31], while this shift may not occur in pattern 1) because of the proportional and global growth of an eye.\n\nThe current study suggested that there were various subtypes in RVS; 5 eyes were categorized with supra temporal clockwise pattern, 7 eyes with infra temporal clockwise, 9 eyes with nasal clockwise, 7 eyes with supra temporal anticlockwise, 5 eyes with infra temporal anticlockwise, 2 eyes with nasal anticlockwise, and 7 eyes with temporal distal shift. The entire mechanism underlying each subtype is unclear; however, they may be related to the variation in the ocular shape changes. The supra temporal anticlockwise (Fig 2D) and infra temporal clockwise RVS (Fig 2E) could be explained by the retinal artery shift in relation to the predominant elongation along the anterior-posterior axis. This is because the retina in the equator zone is predominantly stretched in an oval shaped eyeball, and RVS is moved toward the papillo-macular bundle. In contrast, local/unproportional eye elongations occur not only in eyes with high myopia or pathological myopia. For instance, myopic maculopathy such as tessellated fundus and myopic chorioretinal atrophy can develop locally around posterior pole with moderate myopia [32]. The temporal distal and infra temporal anticlockwise RVS might be reflecting such focal elongation of the eye toward the inferior direction. The supra temporal clockwise (Fig 2A), infra temporal anticlockwise (Fig 2B), and nasal clockwise (Fig 2C) RVS coincide with the movement of the optic fissure closure [33], implying that the structural changes correspond to the optic fissure closure may still be present even at the growth period. The understanding of RVS may help us to elucidate the underlying mechanism of myopic retinal stretch.\n\nIn the RVS(+) group, the average absolute value of ΔPRAA was 0.91°. The PRAA value was not significantly different from that in the first grade, because of the mixture of minus (narrowing; 16 eyes with -1.11 degrees in average), plus (widening; 18 eyes with 1.13 degrees in average), and zero (8 eyes) in values. It is noteworthy that ΔAL were greater in eyes with negative ΔPRAA and ΔPRAA was significantly associated with ΔAL (see Table 4 and Fig 5), suggesting that PRAA becomes narrow with the elongation of an eye. We have recently proposed PRAA to evaluate the retinal stretch associated with the elongation of an eye based on the results of a cross-sectional investigation [7,10,11]. This is supported by the current results obtained from a prospective and longitudinal cohort on children of growing age (childhood). The optimal model for ΔPRAA also included AL (first grade), suggesting that longer AL in the first grade was associated with the narrowing of PRAA (see Table 4 and Fig 4). This may be because elongated eyes in the first grade are likely to exhibit further elongation of an eye, and the retinal structural change, as represented by PRAA narrowing, is predominantly observed in such eyes. The current result also indicated that increase in body weight was also related to further PRAA narrowing. In contrast, body weight at the first grade was negatively correlated to ΔAL. A previous cross-sectional study has reported that body weight was positively correlated to AL in Japanese elementary school children [34]. Other previous studies have suggested a positive and significant correlation between AL and high cholesterol intake [35,36]. However, the underlying mechanism between body weight and eye elongation remains unclear, suggesting the need for the further investigation elucidating the relationship between body weight (and its gain) and eye elongation. It is important to understand not only the mechanism of the development of myopia, but also ocular pathologies. Myopia is an established risk factor for the development of glaucoma [12–15], and we have reported that AL elongation is associated with the progression of glaucomatous visual field damage in adults [27]. On the other hand, interestingly, the previous study reported that the increase in the AL was associated with slower progression of glaucomatous visual field damage in inferior hemifield, probably because AL elongation reduces the stress to lamina cribrosa [27]. Hence, it would be of interest to further investigate the relationship between the elongation of AL in childhood and the future development of glaucoma in a future study.\n\nThere are certain limitations of the current study. We superimposed the photos manually using the optic disc and supra temporal fine retinal vessels as reference points in the current study. We also tried different methods to superimpose the images, such as using fovea-centered images and choosing other vessels as landmarks. It turned out that the method adopted in the study (superimposing the images by adjusting the fine vessels on the optic disc and vessels in the temporal side of the optic disc) resulted in the best quality in evaluating RVS. Moreover, we tried built-in program of ImageJ software called Extract SIFT Correspondences technique, which did not work. We need to develop an automatic superimposing program to standardize the analysis of RVS and PRAA in the future. Second, the number of participants enrolled in the current study was relatively small. Although we found 7 subtypes in the current study, there may be other types of RVS. Other variations may be found using MRI with longer follow-up period. In addition, the study population was made up of Japanese volunteers who are known to belong to one of the most myopic group in the world [37]. Thus, our results might not necessarily hold for non-myopic individuals of other ethnicities. Moreover, although myopic change may cause ocular structural changes in a longer duration, the follow-up period was limited to two years. A study with a larger sample size from different ethnic groups with a longer observation period will enable us to compare the relationship between PRAA and AL in each subtype in detail.\n\nIn sum, about 26.1% of the eyes of junior high school subjects who were in the first grade (12- or 13-years old) exhibited RVS in two years. There were several different changing patterns of RVS in this period, with most RVS patterns being unbalanced or localized. RVS was associated with AL elongation, suggesting that eye elongation may be focal and/or irregular even in normal eyes."
