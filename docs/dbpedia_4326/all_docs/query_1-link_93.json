        "text": "Wikimedia subject-area collaboration\n\nWelcome to WikiProject Japan, a WikiProject set up to better organize and present information in all articles related to Japan. It is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of interested Wikipedians to improve all Japan-related articles in order to make Wikipedia an excellent resource for Japan-related information for all who visit. If you would like to help, please sign up on the participants page and see the to-do list below for ideas of where to start. There's plenty of work to go around!\n\nFor more information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProjects and Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices.\n\nCurrent time in Japan: 04:37, August 20, 2024 (JST, Reiwa 6) ( )\n\nThis project is designed to help those interested in improving all of the Japan-related articles on Wikipedia to find a particular area in which they are interested in working. As \"Japan\" is a broad subject, there are many taskforces and collaborations (see the navbox to the right for a full list) in which you can participate.\n\nAs of , there are 94,250 articles within the scope of WikiProject Japan, of which 184 are featured. This makes up 1.37% of the articles on Wikipedia and 1.67% of featured articles and lists. Including non-article pages, such as talk pages, redirects, categories, etcetera, there are 242,446 pages in the project.\n\nWe want to:\n\nAllow people to more easily locate groups working on Japan-related WikiProjects\n\nCreate a body of articles that accurately depicts the history and culture of Japan and the Japanese people\n\nExpand the number of articles regarding Japan and Japanese topics\n\nFurther #3 by expanding all Japan-related article stubs\n\nHighlight Japan's relationship and contributions to the rest of the world\n\nProperly source all Japan-related articles, preferably using the <ref> element and the {{cite}} series of templates\n\nStandardize the style and format of articles on Japan or Japanese topics; and\n\nStandardize the use of Japanese-language terms, names, and translations into English across all related articles, bringing them in line with the WP:MOS-JA.\n\nPatrol recent changes to existing Japan-related articles for vandalism and poor-quality edits, and correct them to maintain the articles.\n\nBelow is how we are progressing on improving the articles within our scope.\n\nGet all at least B-class: 3.1% complete\n\nGet all articles at least C class: 10.8% complete\n\nGet all articles at least Start class: 51.3% complete\n\nAssess all articles: 99.6% complete\n\nJapan portal\n\nPlease \"Be Bold!\" and help us out. There are plenty of things to do in the lists below, including the creation of brand new articles. Please list all Japan-related Good and Featured articles at Wikipedia:WikiProject Japan/Recognized content.\n\nPlease help as much as you can with our big list of unreferenced biographies of living people. The oldest tagged articles need help first as they are likely to be deleted before any more recently tagged articles. Whether you can do one article or 100, your help is needed and appreciated. Thanks!\n\nSome articles have been tagged as needing immediate attention, as well as those needing infoboxes.\n\nYou can manually list articles you have created or found at /Newest articles#Manually maintained list.\n\nSee Wikipedia:WikiProject Japan/Peer review\n\nThese are mostly well-written articles that need a little improvement in order to become FA quality.\n\nNational Treasures of Japan, see discussion, needs copy-edit to make the language \"brillant.\"\n\nKoan was a Featured Article Candidate.\n\nSumo is a former featured-article candidate.\n\nChashitsu, see discussion\n\nCowboy Bebop, see discussion\n\nForty-seven Ronin, see discussion here and here\n\nInuYasha, see discussion\n\nJapanese grammar, see discussion\n\nJapanese name, see discussion\n\nJapanese tea ceremony, see discussion\n\nMega Man, see discussion\n\nPac-Man, see discussion\n\nSpira (Final Fantasy), see discussion\n\nStroke order, see discussion.\n\nPlease consider working on the Top importance articles in the chart below in order to bring them to Featured Article quality. The chart shows the current status of these articles (listed alphabetically by how close they are to reaching FA status), and there's plenty to work on.\n\nThese are big tasks that require a lot of work from a lot of people helping out in order to improve something. Feel free to jump right in and help with any of them. We always welcome more help!\n\nBamse is improving the coverage of the National Treasures of Japan. See User:Bamse/National Treasures of Japan.\n\nMany pages shown at Special:Allpages/Japan, Special:Allpages/Japanese, Special:Allpages/Nihon, Special:Allpages/Nippon, andSpecial:Allpages/Imperial Japanese lack WikiProject Japan tags and assessments.\n\nA list of articles needing cleanup associated with this project is available. See also the tool's wiki page and the index of WikiProjects.\n\nThese are anything smaller or more specific than projects and anything that individuals can work on.\n\nAdditionally, please review the following for work which may need doing:\n\nVarious articles on historic people, especially the new articles\n\nKyoto Imperial Palace is in sad shape. Needs expansion, more cited references.\n\nShingetsu Institute was deleted as looking a little spammy; it's got lots of external links to articles, but not a single actual footnote, and the notability has been questioned (there's a bit of a COI concern as well).\n\nProstitution in Japan has lots of references, but many of the references are questionable\n\nYou can also work on files listed on the Cleanup listing page as well as articles in Category:Japan articles needing attention. Your help with these is appreciated as the list of things to do is very long.\n\nScan for Japan-related requested moves\n\nThe following are from WP:RM:\n\nThe following may be from toolserver reports at WP:DPL#To do, but any page needing disambiguation work and link correcting can be listed here.\n\n(None over 25 links at this time)\n\nGenerated by bot as per Wikipedia:Article alerts.\n\nTo watch the page for Article alerts, please add this page to your watchlist: Wikipedia:WikiProject Japan/Article alerts\n\nYou can find a list of all Japan-related stub categories on the Category talk:Japan stubs page. All of the articles on the main Category:Japan stubs page need to be sorted into these more specific categories while they are stubs (last performed on 9 June 2009). Of course, you can also expand the stubs in such a way as to make them no longer stubs. If none of the existing stubs apply, please use {{Japan-stub}}.\n\nIf you want to make a new stub for a particular category, please note that all stubs are managed by the Stub-sorting WikiProject. Before creating a new stub, you should propose it at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals. DO NOT simply create new stub templates, as these will probably be deleted. See Wikipedia:Stub for general guidelines on creating stub templates and categories.\n\nThe articles on these pages need to be created (or pointed to existing articles under slightly different names). You can also add requests to one of these pages. If you aren't sure which page to add your request to, please ask on the talk page.\n\nWikipedia:Requested articles/Japan (including anime and manga, as well as anything else related to Japan)\n\nBuddhism\n\nRole-playing games\n\nVideo games\n\nCategory:Wikipedia requested photographs in Japan\n\nIn addition to requesting on here, elsewhere on the English Wikipedia, and on the Wikimedia Commons (Commons:Commons:Picture_requests/Requests/Asia#Japan), please also request one on the Japanese Wikipedia. If you know Japanese, state your request at ja:Wikipedia:画像提供依頼. If you do not know Japanese, state your request at ja:Wikipedia:Chatsubo and ask the participants for help on adding it to the Japanese Wikipedia's image request page. Members will help you with your requests. Usually Japanese Wikipedians who photograph and upload images on Commons will post descriptions in Japanese and English.\n\nSee under Wikipedia:Requested articles/Japan above, or,\n\nAlso see Wikipedia:Pages needing translation into English\n\nAnd check Category:Articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia\n\nPolicies and gateway: Wikipedia:Translation\n\nOld link: Japan-related translation requests\n\nHepburn romanization needed:\n\nRomanize film titles at: Template:WPFILMS Announcements/Japanese cinema\n\nList any Japan-related articles on which you are working that aren't quite ready for prime time, or proposed replacements or updates for currently existing articles. This will allow an informal peer review of sorts by anyone interested in the particular topic, thereby helping Wikipedia to become better.\n\nJapanese bamboo weaving needs help with the macrons on the names, please help.

Also the other info is terribly outdated, this university was allover the news yesterday so there's plenty of reliable information out there right now. I would contribute to it but not sure how to change the article name, or is it better to create a completely new article and delete old one? —Preceding unsigned comment added by Tsurugaoka (talk • contribs) 12:26, November 11, 2009\n\nI was browsing Wikipedia and found this page looking a bit lonely and lost (Memorial day for the end of the war). Unfortunately as my Japanese language knowledge is nil and the original creator of the pages English isn't great most of the page didn't make sense so I had to get rid of it. It needed categorising which I have done. If anyone knows anything about this day please can they consider adding to the stub? Cls14 (talk)\n\n@User:Cls14Hi, I am new to Wikiproject Japan and was just reading through this page to see what it was all about when I came upon your post. Somebody has categorized this as one of the public holidays in Japan, but I don't think that is correct. It is more of a remembrance day with a few speeches given and a few events held than a national holiday type of thing. My personal experience is that it is pretty business as usual for most of Japan, with a few events being held in Tokyo. Also, the part about Obon has nothing to do with this day other than that August 15 tends to fall with in that time period. For what it's worth, Obon is also not a National holiday. It's sort of like Christmas here, celebrated by some but not a Japanese holiday; It is more like a summer break for some companies and people. --Marchjuly (talk)\n\nKatsuhiro Kawamitsu (川満勝弘):New. This Articles for Creation submission from last October recently re-entered the AFC queue. It needs some cleanup. The original submitter hasn't edited in months. Help would be appreciated. davidwr/(talk)/(contribs)\n\nProposed update of Nagauta: I am new to Wikiproject Japan and to Wikipedia editing in general. I wanted to update the Nagauta article because there are quite a few reputable scholarly sources available on the topic and the article previously lacked citations. Is it long enough to remove the \"stub\" designation? I would appreciate any feedback on how I did or how I could improve my editing in future. --CBFraoch (talk)\n\nTohoku High School:New.

In general, do not add this project's talk page banner to articles belonging to a child project. This is to prevent the talk pages getting too many talk page banners.\n\nIf an article is in need of kanji or hiragana, add {{Needkanji}} or {{Needhiragana}} to the top of the article.\n\nWhen adding Japanese characters to an article, use\n\n{{nihongo}} if an explanation or the pronunciation of the characters is needed.
