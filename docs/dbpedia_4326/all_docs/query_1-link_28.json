        "text": "Introduction\n\nChronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) require treatments that provide durable efficacy, and which are safe and well tolerated over the long term. While the majority of Japanese patients with RA start their treatment with a conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate (MTX) [1], some patients do not achieve adequate clinical benefit with MTX and may experience serious adverse events such as liver toxicity and bone marrow suppression [2]. Furthermore, MTX should not be administered to some patients due to safety concerns, such as a history of liver or kidney disorders [3]. As many such patients have significant disease activity, additional therapeutic options are necessary. Biologic DMARD therapies for RA provide increased clinical and structural benefit compared with conventional DMARDs [4,5]. First approved more than a decade ago [6], a variety of biologic agents with differing mechanisms of action are currently available.\n\nAbatacept is a fully humanized, soluble, recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1. It is the only treatment for RA that mimics the naturally occurring homeostatic mechanism of human CTLA-4 and inhibits the interaction of CD28 with CD80/86 on the antigen-presenting cell, thus selectively modulating the co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation [7].\n\nThe safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) abatacept has been well established in the global population, with both short-term and long-term studies. IV abatacept is currently approved in the USA, the European Union, Japan, and several other countries for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, and a subcutaneous formulation is becoming more widely available worldwide. The IV formulation of abatacept is effective, with favorable safety, in patients with RA who are MTX-naïve [8], MTX inadequate responders [9,10], or anti-tumor necrosis factor inadequate responders [11].\n\nIV abatacept has demonstrated favorable tolerability and clinical efficacy benefits among Japanese patients with RA who are MTX inadequate responders [12]. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary evaluations of the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of abatacept (2, 8, and 16 mg/kg) were examined in a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study in Japanese patients with RA (n = 21; IM101-034) [13]. Abatacept had favorable safety and was well tolerated up to the highest dose of 16 mg/kg over 57–127 days, and pharmacokinetic outcomes were similar to those reported in another open-label clinical study of IV abatacept [14]. Abatacept was found to be effective (as assessed by American College of Rheumatology 20% [ACR20] response) in patients in each of the three dose groups. A Phase II study (IM101-071, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00345748\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00345748\"}}NCT00345748) examined the dose response of abatacept (2 and 10 mg/kg) compared with that of placebo and background MTX in Japanese patients with active RA over 24 weeks (n = 195) [12]. This study demonstrated significantly greater ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses with abatacept 10 mg/kg compared to those with placebo (P < 0.0001), whereas smaller but statistically significant responses were seen in the 2 mg/kg abatacept group. Additionally, abatacept plus MTX was found to be well tolerated.\n\nThe primary objective of the present 3-year, long-term study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00484289\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00484289\"}}NCT00484289) was to examine the safety of continuous IV abatacept in patients with RA who participated in either the Phase I or the Phase II studies, or were newly enrolled and received abatacept monotherapy due to the inability to tolerate MTX owing to safety concerns and had an inadequate response to other DMARDs. The secondary objectives of this study included assessment of clinical and functional efficacy, health-related quality of life, immunogenicity, and laboratory and pharmacodynamic outcomes.\n\nPatients and methods\n\nPatient population\n\nThis study comprised three cohorts of patients with RA, including patients who previously participated in either the Japanese Phase I study IM101-034 (February 2004–December 2005) or the Japanese Phase II study IM101-071 (June 2006–November 2007), or new patients enrolling in this study who were MTX-intolerant, had never received abatacept before, and had an inadequate response to DMARDs other than MTX, including biologics. Each cohort consisted of Japanese males and females aged ≥ 20 years with a diagnosis of RA as defined by the American Rheumatism Association (1987) [15] and an ACR functional status of Class I, Class II or Class III [16]. Further eligibility criteria applied to the particular cohorts are described below.\n\nIn the Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study, patients who had been receiving DMARDs at registration were treated with single or multiple doses (Days 1, 15, 29, and 57) of IV abatacept 2, 8, or 16 mg/kg [13]. Patients who were withdrawn from the Phase I study due to safety reasons were excluded from this Phase III study. Between Phase I and Phase III, patients may have been treated with other biologic agents. At registration for this Phase III study, patients from Phase I were required to have undergone the following washout periods: infliximab discontinuation at least 56 days prior to screening and 84 days prior to the first administration of abatacept, and etanercept withdrawal at least 28 days prior to screening.\n\nIn the Phase II study, patients with active RA and an inadequate response to MTX were treated with IV abatacept 2 or 10 mg/kg plus MTX, or placebo plus MTX, for 24 weeks [12]. Patients from Phase II must have completed the IM101-071 study to be eligible for the present Phase III study. Additionally, patients from Phase II could not have received any biologics between the completion of IM101-071 and enrollment in the Phase III study.\n\nThe new patient cohort with MTX intolerance consisted of patients who could not receive MTX owing to safety reasons. These patients presented with an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs or biologics, and had ≥ 6 swollen joints and ≥ 8 tender joints at the time of screening. In this new patient cohort, infliximab, and etanercept were discontinued as described above for patients from Phase I, and DMARDs were withdrawn at least 28 days prior to screening.\n\nExclusion criteria for all three cohorts in the current Phase III study included those patients who, at screening, had received unlicensed biologics (excluding abatacept) from previous or ongoing studies in Japan. Additionally, patients who had received any investigational drug (excluding abatacept) within five half-lives of the product or 56 days before screening were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they were currently under treatment with leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, D-penicillamine, cyclophosphamide, or immunoadsorption columns at screening.\n\nStudy design\n\nThis was a multicenter, open-label, long-term study that was conducted at 40 sites in Japan. The study was therefore performed in an open-label and uncontrolled manner and no hypotheses were planned. The study was planned to continue until the approval of IV abatacept in Japan, and thus, a specific duration of administration of abatacept was not set. The protocol and patients’ informed consent received institutional review board/independent ethics committee approval; the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was consistent with Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation.\n\nAll patients, regardless of previously received abatacept dose (from Phases I and II), were given abatacept at a weight-tiered dose approximating 10 mg/kg (500 mg for patients weighing < 60 kg, 750 mg for patients weighing 60–100 kg, and 1 g for patients weighing > 100 kg). The dose was administered intravenously at Weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter. From the second year of participation in the study, patients were reweighed once a year and their abatacept dose was checked and adjusted if needed. Concomitant administration of other biologics was prohibited in all patients. New patients with MTX intolerance were not permitted to use concomitant conventional DMARDs during the first 12 weeks, whereas patients enrolled from the Phase I and Phase II studies were permitted to use conventional DMARDs (MTX, < 8 mg/week) from the time of enrollment. In addition, use of corticosteroids (total dose, ≤ 10 mg/day prednisolone equivalent) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were permitted in all patients. Patients who discontinued from the study were followed up at the time of discontinuation and for 12 weeks following the last abatacept administration.\n\nSafety assessments\n\nAdverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and laboratory tests were recorded throughout the study. An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a patient administered abatacept that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE was defined as any AE that resulted in death, disability, or hospitalization, or that was life-threatening. If a patient experienced an AE during the study, abatacept was continued only if the AE resolved and was considered not clinically significant.\n\nLaboratory tests included hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis. “Abnormal laboratory values” were defined as values that deviated from the normal range defined by the central laboratory. Average changes in laboratory tests were calculated based on the normal ranges in females. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 available online at: http//informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14397595.2014.899179 show definitions of severity for AEs and criteria for selecting abnormal laboratory values, respectively.\n\nImmunogenicity and pharmacodynamic assessments\n\nImmunogenicity was assessed based on the levels of anti-abatacept (CTLA-4-Ig) antibodies and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (CTLA-4-T: CTLA-4 without the Ig region) in blood using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood samples were collected for immunogenicity assessments prior to abatacept administration at Week 0 and every 24 weeks thereafter. If a patient discontinued the study prematurely, immunogenicity was assessed at discontinuation and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the final administration of abatacept. When the serum concentration of abatacept was < 1 μg/mL, seropositive samples with anti-CTLA-4-T reactivity were further characterized using a cell-based neutralization assay to determine whether the sample had neutralizing antibody activity.\n\nRheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration levels were measured as pharmacodynamic parameters. Samples for the assessment of RF concentration levels were taken at Week 0 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Samples for the assessment of CRP concentration levels were taken at Weeks 0, 2, and 4, and then every 4 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks for the remainder of the study.\n\nEfficacy assessments\n\nClinical efficacy was evaluated by ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses [17]. Disease activity was measured by the rates of patients achieving a low disease activity state (LDAS; 28-joint Disease Activity Score [DAS28] [CRP] of ≤ 3.2) and remission (DAS28 [CRP] of < 2.6). Physical function was measured by patient-reported Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) response (improvement from baseline of ≥ 0.3 units) [18]. The above efficacy assessments were made at Week 0 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire at Week 0, and then every 12 weeks for the first year, followed by every 24 weeks for the remainder of the study.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData are presented for the pooled population and by original cohort. All patients who received at least one infusion of abatacept were included in the safety and efficacy data sets. Patients who discontinued from the study without receiving abatacept were deemed pretreatment dropouts. While there was no hypothesis testing and no power consideration for safety or efficacy, administration of abatacept to 180 patients provided a 95% probability of observing at least one occurrence of any AE that would occur with ≥ 1.7% incidence in the population from which the sample is drawn. All available data from patients who had received abatacept, and for whom baseline and at least one additional measurement had been available, were included in the pharmacodynamic and immunogenicity data sets. Baseline for all patient cohorts was defined as pre-dose of Day 1 for this Phase III study.\n\nSafety data (all AEs) were described and analyzed as frequency distributions. Laboratory test results were summarized using descriptive statistics, and the rate of positive response was calculated for immunogenicity. For pharmacodynamic parameters, concentration levels and changes from baseline were evaluated using descriptive statistics.\n\nAll clinical variables, including ACR20/50/70, DAS28 (CRP)-defined LDAS and remission, and HAQ response, were summarized as observed for patients with data available at the visit of interest, using descriptive statistics. In addition to these analyses, a post hoc analysis of clinical results (ACR20/50/70, DAS28 [CRP]-defined LDAS and remission, and HAQ response) was carried out using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis. Changes from baseline in each item of the SF-36 were summarized using descriptive statistics.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough the majority of patients with RA begin long-term treatment with MTX, some patients do not respond adequately to MTX alone or are not candidates for MTX, and therefore require additional therapeutic options. Previous studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy and favorable safety of IV abatacept in patients with an inadequate response to MTX [9,10]. In this long-term study in Japanese patients with RA and an inadequate response to MTX or other conventional or biologic DMARDs, IV abatacept monotherapy and IV abatacept with background MTX demonstrated acceptable safety and sustained efficacy over 3 years of treatment.\n\nThis Phase III, open-label, long-term study of IV abatacept included patients with RA from the Japanese Phase I clinical trial [13], patients with active RA and an inadequate response to MTX from the Japanese Phase II clinical trial [12], and newly enrolled patients with RA and MTX intolerance. Although all patients had been treated previously with MTX, approximately one-third of patients also had prior biologic DMARD use. At enrollment, the majority of patients from the Phase I and Phase II studies were receiving concomitant MTX, and the newly enrolled patients received abatacept monotherapy. All patients were treated with IV abatacept for a mean of 3 years, and 58.1% patients were maintained on IV abatacept for more than 3 years.\n\nThe variety, frequency, and severity of the AEs in patients treated with abatacept as monotherapy or concomitantly with DMARDs were not significantly different from those reported in long-term international clinical trials of abatacept ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00162266\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00162266\"}}NCT00162266 [19]; {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00048568\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00048568\"}}NCT00048568 [9]; and {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00048581\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00048581\"}}NCT00048581 [20]) and the Japanese Phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00345748\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00345748\"}}NCT00345748 [12]). Most of the AEs observed, including abnormal laboratory changes, were mild or moderate, and most SAEs resolved or were relieved by treatment. Among the three patient cohorts, newly enrolled patients had the highest rates of SAEs and discontinuation due to SAEs. As expected, these patients also had higher baseline disease activity.\n\nIn addition to assessment of AEs, the immunogenicity results from the present study fall within the range of results seen in the previous Japanese trials [12,13]. During the Phase I study, 7/21 (33%) patients were positive for anti-CTLA-4-T antibodies [13], while positive immunogenicity responses were not detected in any patient during the Phase II study [12]. In the present study, the majority of patients with a positive immunogenicity response were from the Phase II study. Of these Phase II patients, approximately half had positive responses that were transient and occurred only at baseline.\n\nImprovements from baseline in CRF and RF levels were demonstrated in all cohorts. Reductions in CRP have been shown to be correlated with clinical response in previous studies of abatacept [21,22]. The CRP reduction in the present study is also consistent with the Phase I Japanese trial that demonstrated mean decreases in CRP levels [13]. In a Phase II study of IV abatacept (˜10 mg/kg) in patients with very early RA ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00124449\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00124449\"}}NCT00124449), reductions in RF levels from baseline were seen at 6 months and 1 year, and, similar to CRP, changes in RF levels were correlated with clinical response to abatacept [23].\n\nAs this study was an uncontrolled, open-label study, and the evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective, no tests based on a formal statistical hypothesis were conducted, and the efficacy was based on as-observed analyses for up to 3 years following baseline (Week 0) of this Phase III study. The majority of the 217 evaluated patients had previously received abatacept either as part of the Phase I study (2, 8, and 16 mg/kg abatacept) or as part of the Phase II trial (2 or 10 mg/kg abatacept or placebo plus MTX), and as such had lower mean clinical disease severity at baseline than the newly enrolled patients. Improvements in clinical efficacy were seen in patients from Phase I and Phase II following initiation of abatacept at Week 0, likely due to the transition period between studies, and the fact that not all patients had been receiving abatacept at therapeutic doses. Patients who were newly enrolled on abatacept as monotherapy experienced improvements in signs and symptoms of RA, as evaluated by ACR response, following initiation of therapy. Following the initial clinical response, ACR response rates were maintained over 3 years in all three patient cohorts.\n\nFor patients from Phase II, ACR response rates declined in both abatacept-treated groups (2 and 10 mg/kg) during the period between the last efficacy analysis of the Phase II study and the start of Phase III (data not shown). However, the ACR response rates increased in all treatment groups after the start of abatacept administration in Phase III. Based on baseline of Week 0 in the original Phase II study, ACR responses at Week 24 of this Phase III study for each of the original Phase II dose groups were similar to those observed for the abatacept 10 mg/kg group at Week 24 of the Phase II study [12]. Furthermore, based on a baseline of Week 0 in the original Phase II study, these response rates were sustained for up to 3 years in the present study for patients who remained on treatment.\n\nDAS28 (CRP) and HAQ outcomes (based on as-observed data) were also maintained over the 3-year period in all patient cohorts, which included patients receiving IV abatacept as monotherapy and when administered with concomitant DMARDs, demonstrating sustained benefits in disease activity and physical function for patients who remained on treatment. Since as-observed analyses are vulnerable to the discontinuation of patients, a post hoc analysis using the more stringent LOCF method was performed for the above clinical efficacy measures. Using LOCF, rates of ACR response, DAS28 (CRP)-defined LDAS and remission, and HAQ response were sustained over 3 years, confirming the results from the as-observed analyses. Finally, SF-36 physical component summary and mental component summary scores (as-observed) also showed improvement from baseline in all cohorts, and generally continued at the same improved levels over the same time frame.\n\nInterpretation of results should take into consideration the limitations of the study. This study, being an open-label extension, creates a number of challenges for data analysis and interpretation. These challenges, which include bias in patient inclusion and outcomes, have been previously outlined by Buch et al. [24]. Furthermore, the three cohorts utilized in this study had different baseline disease states with varying prior and current concomitant medication usage, and the results from the pooled patient population should be interpreted with caution. In addition, the sample size of this study was small; for this reason, the findings of this study alone should be extrapolated to the broader community with appropriate caution.\n\nIn conclusion, no new safety signals were identified in this long-term study of IV abatacept in Japanese patients with RA compared with previous international trials, based on the assessment of AEs and immunogenicity. IV abatacept as monotherapy and in combination with MTX was confirmed to be well tolerated, and improvements in clinical and functional efficacy were maintained for up to 3 years with continued treatment."
