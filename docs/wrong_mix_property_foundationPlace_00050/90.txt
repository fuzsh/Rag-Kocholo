The Hong Kong Writers Circle is a member organisation for writers of all levels and genres. We are committed to creating an environment in which writers develop their writing skills and knowledge of the publishing industry with the support of their peers. The HKWC provides its members with opportunities to further their craft, meet and network with industry professionals, receive critical feedback on their work, take part in workshops and socials and see their work published in our annual anthology.

Founded in 1991 by Lawrence Gray, the HKWC has since become a stalwart of Hong Kongâ€™s literary scene. We encourage writers across all genres to join our community, including short fiction writers and novelists, non-fiction writers and journalists, playwrights, screenwriters, filmmakers and poets. Our members come from all corners of the globe and range from the published professional to the aspiring amateur.

Our regular activities include member critique groups, our annual anthology, which usually launches at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival, workshops, monthly reading groups and socials, including our Christmas party and anthology launch party, as well as exciting opportunities to take part in other literary events around Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific region.
