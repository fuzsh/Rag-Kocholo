It begins with an absorbing narrative on the background of the story. As a rookie ASIO agent, Melbourne based Ella Portman is thrown into the deep end when she is assigned to a case in Hong Kong. With her Melbourne boss, Shane Delitani they operate under the supervision of Hong Kong ASIO agent, Dave Hannah. Twenty container-loads of Australian Army vehicles and weapons have been stolen by Hong Kong criminals, who also operate a sex-slave trade. The weapons are for sale to any terrorist group willing to pay enough money. Ella and her colleagues face many life-threatening situations in their attempts to retrieve the weapons and bring the criminals to justice, or death. The author’s clinical research and experience is reflected in the detailed descriptions of military armaments, as well as the technicalities of martial arts combat. Ella makes a few mistakes in her learning process as an undercover agent, but she benefits from those experiences and becomes a force to be reckoned with. Although set in Hong Kong, the story makes short excursions to Melbourne, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States. Readers looking for gripping action will find it in Keven Wiley’s book, Danger in Hong Kong.\" Hugh Allan, Author\n\n“A fast paced, well thought out action romp of old school spies and crims that flips pages like a hurricane and leaves you wanting more… A great novel and new talent…” David, Indie Book reviewer"
