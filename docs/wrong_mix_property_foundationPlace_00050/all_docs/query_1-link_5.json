It began operation on 1 October 1977 and the establishment of CASH was officially announced at a press conference on 20 October 1977.\n\nBack in 1946, The Performing Rights Society (PRS) in the UK set up an agency in Hong Kong to protect music copyright of its members and members of its overseas affiliated societies and collect performing royalties for them. By the 1970s, a growing demand for local Cantonese music was seen and a group of active and enthusiastic local composers in Hong Kong were of utmost interest to cooperate for their mutual benefits, leading PRS to reach an agreement with a group of music creators in 1977 and establish CASH."
