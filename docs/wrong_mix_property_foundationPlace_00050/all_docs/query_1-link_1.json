        "text": "James Chen (www.jameschen.vision) is a Hong Kong based philanthropist and co-founded Bring Me a Book Hong Kong with his wife Su in 2006 to promote family literacy and bring the joy of reading to the city. He is the Chairman of his family’s enterprise Wahum Group Holdings, and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bath to recognise his philanthropic work. James is a key proponent of the concept of ‘Moonshot philanthropy’, the uncompromising belief that philanthropic ventures must carry risk and has used this form of philanthropy to focus on two key areas, early childhood literacy and the world’s largest unmet disability: poor vision.\n\nBorn and raised in Hong Kong, Alison received her BBA from the University of Hong Kong and received her MBA from the Harvard Business School. She has over 20 years of experience in consulting, corporate finance and investment experience with GE Capital, JPMorgan Chase, GLG and various start-ups. Her biggest enjoyment comes from reading bedtime stories with her 2 daughters, Alexis and Amelia.\n\nJennifer Chen is the Chief Executive of The Chen Yet-Sen Family Foundation and Director of Philanthropic Engagement at Legacy Advisors, a thriving family office founded by James Chen. She sits on a number of Boards of NGOs and was Founder of the successful BridgeTheGapHK campaign bringing much needed funding to Covid disrupted NGOs. In 2009, Jennifer founded the Otto Wong Brain Tumour Centre at CUHK after the sudden passing of her husband from a ruptured brain tumour. The Centre focuses on research, patient care, surgical developments and treatments.\n\nJennifer is also a dedicated mother of three active boys. Encouraging them to learn, inquire and read has been the most rewarding journey. They keep her grounded, focused and very busy!\n\nBorn in Hong Kong and raised in the UK, Amanda graduated with a MA degree from the University of Oxford and worked as a litigation lawyer for 10 years with Clifford Chance and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP in London and Hong Kong.\n\nAmanda now splits her time between managing her family business and her family circus, which features her three feisty daughters, Alexa, Amelia and Alison. Since becoming a mother, Amanda has been on a constant quest for interesting, relevant and fun books for her children, in both Chinese and English, and this is how she discovered the wealth of resources offered by BMAB.\n\nAmanda is honoured to serve as a board member on BMAB and looks forward to bringing the joy of reading to all families in Hong Kong.\n\nRachel Ip is an award-winning children’s author whose stories are often inspired by real world events and experiences. She has lived in Hong Kong for 14 years with her husband and two daughters. Rachel’s first picture book, The Last Garden, illustrated by Anneli Bray, was published by Hodder Children’s Books in 2020. The Forgettery, illustrated by Laura Hughes, was published by Farshore Books in 2021\n\nRachel chairs the Schools Program Committee at Bring Me a Book Hong Kong and is the Events Coordinator for the Society of Children’s Book Writers & Illustrators (SCBWI) in Hong Kong.\n\nIrene is a seasoned audit partner of KPMG China specializing in innovative and emerging growth businesses. She started her career with KPMG Toronto and has been working in HK for over 19 years. Irene has served clients in a wide range of sectors with a specific focus on healthcare, life sciences, technology, media and telecommunications and consumer markets, from pre-IPO, public offering to listed companies.\n\nIn addition to her role in audit, Irene also leads the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Reporting and Advisory practice in Hong Kong which advises companies on ESG reporting, climate change and decarbonisation strategy and social and economic impact assessment.\n\nAs a mother of 2 children, Irene passionately believes that reading aloud instills a love of learning and close family bond.\n\nPia graduated from University College London and The University of Hong Kong with over twenty years of experience in marketing, strategic planning and communications. Pia joined Bring Me A Book Hong Kong in 2010 to help raise awareness and advocate for key social and literacy issues facing Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2012, Pia was awarded a scholarship to join Harvard Business School’s Executive Education Program on Non-Profit Management and in 2019, Pia published her first book “Good to Read.” Pia was recognized as a 2020 AmCham Women of Influence nominee as part of the NGO Women Leaders Taskforce.\n\nThe job Pia is proudest of is mother of two teenage boys who still talk about the cuddles and fun they shared reading together every night when they were younger.\n\nYvonne graduated with a BA in Asian Studies from the University of Western Australia. A keen musician since she was a child, Yvonne has been teaching piano for 8 years and loves to see the joy that music and books can bring to kids. Since joining BMABHK in 2018, Yvonne loves to use her creative and organization skills to support the team to spread the love of reading in HK.\n\nCorey is a qualified accountant and graduated from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in the 90’s. After working more than a decade as a professional accountant, she became a full-time mother in 2008 to enjoy all the miracle moments with her young daughter.\n\nIt was on her quest to acquire more parenting knowledge that she came across Bring Me A Book Hong Kong. Corey joined their First Teacher Training and several other BMABHK workshops. In 2016, Corey joined BMABHK as a part-time accountant and in more recent years, Corey has become an active storyteller for community programs, reading carnivals and has also run workshops on behalf of BMABHK for the Hong Kong Public Library Festival. In 2021, she has taken up more roles in project coordination for BMABHK.\n\nCerise graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Food and Nutritional Sciences. Despite enjoying her studies, she was far more excited to give back to the society. Her passion for children and reading ultimately drew her to Bring Me A Book Hong Kong in 2020. Finding the peace of mind in reading, she has dedicated herself to let children embrace the joy and happiness of reading. Outside of work, she enjoys yoga, cooking, traveling, and spending time with her family and friends."
