        "text": "The Editor-in-Chief (EIC) has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the quality of the journal. The EIC assesses each submitted manuscript to determine whether its topic falls within CAR’s Aims and Scope, and whether the likelihood of success is sufficiently high to merit review. If not, the paper is returned to the authors without review. If the paper merits review, the EIC assigns it to an Editor with relevant expertise. From time to time, we may draw on Consulting Editors or members of the Editorial Board to serve as ad hoc Editors.\n\nCAR strives to offer authors a fair, constructive, expert, and timely review process. The Editor assigned to a specific manuscript is responsible for the entire editorial and peer review process, subject to oversight by the EIC. The Editor normally assigns two reviewers, who provide review reports and recommendations. CAR discourages reviewers from attempting to identify authors, and requires them to report any known conflicts of interest. The Editor decides on the paper’s disposition, using the review reports as input, and communicates with the authors. The EIC reviews all decisions to accept papers for publication.\n\nAuthors are jointly responsible for adhering to the highest standards of academic integrity in the conduct, writing and presentation of their research. Authors must submit a declaration of academic integrity, agreed by all authors, with any new submission.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2024, authors must make a declaration on the use of generative AI during the manuscript submission process, in accordance with the CAAA Journals’ Statement on the Use of Generative AI.\n\nReviewer fee waivers\n\nFor several years, Contemporary Accounting Research (CAR) has issued submission fee waivers in recognition of timely completion of two reviews.\n\nPreviously, these waivers have not had an expiry date.\n\nEffective April 19th, 2017, CAR’s process for fee waivers changed. Please see below for details.\n\nNew Process\n\nAll reviews completed within 30 days of the original reviewer invitation will be considered prompt. Upon completion of two prompt reviews, a reviewer is eligible for a waived submission fee on a new submission to CAR. Each review is eligible to be applied towards a waived submission fee for five years from the date of review completion.\n\nA summary of eligible prompt reviews will be sent to reviewers annually, to the e-mail address in CAR’s Editorial Manager system. That summary can be uploaded to CAR in place of a submission fee receipt. Between reports, if you have questions about your eligibility, please contact car@caaa.ca.\n\nWaivers are non-transferable, not valid for previous submissions, and not eligible for refund in the instance a manuscript is desk-rejected. If you pay a submission fee and subsequently wish to claim a waiver instead, you must email car@caaa.ca within 48 hours of payment.\n\nExceptions\n\nReviews completed for the annual CAR conference are considered prompt if they are completed on or before the conference review deadline. In addition, an exception will be granted for reviews completed within 45 days of the original reviewer invitation for invitations issued between March 26, 2020 and December 31, 2020.\n\nPast prompt reviews and existing waivers\n\nReviews completed on or before 31-Dec-2014 will expire on 31-Dec-2019. As noted above, all later prompt reviews will be considered eligible for five years from the date the prompt review was completed.\n\nFee waivers for withdrawn manuscripts\n\nAll waivers issued for manuscripts that have been withdrawn will expire on the earlier of; the date specified in the editor’s decision letter, or 31-Dec-2019.\n\nTerms & conditions (updated January 2024)\n\nReviewer fee waivers must be redeemed within 5 years from the date the first prompt review was completed, failing which the waiver shall be forfeited. Waivers have no monetary value and are not transferrable. CAR reserves the right to change the terms of its reviewer fee waivers program at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting an updated version of this editorial policy, which changes shall take effect 30 days after the changes are posted. CAR also reserves the right to discontinue the reviewer fee waivers program at any time, including the right to cancel any eligibility for fee waivers that have not been redeemed at the time of discontinuation, with or without notice and without any liability. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Ontario and the applicable federal laws of Canada without giving effect to its conflict of law principles.\n\nAll appeals go through the EIC. An appeal requires a new submission fee, which is not refundable. No appeal may be made until at least one month has passed since the decision, and any appeal must be made within six months of the decision. The author(s) should provide a letter explaining the basis for the appeal, generally an error and not a difference of opinion. All appeals must be initiated and approved by all authors of the original manuscript. The EIC will assign a judge to the appeal, normally a Consulting Editor. The judge will have access to all submissions, reviews and correspondence related to the manuscript, and may communicate with any of the parties involved (authors, reviewers and Editor). The judge will decide whether to re-start the review process, and if so, whether to do so with the same Editor. The judge’s decision is final."
