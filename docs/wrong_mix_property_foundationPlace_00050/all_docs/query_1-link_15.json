        "text": "Categories of Manuscripts\n\nManuscript Submission\n\nManuscripts should be submitted via the Hong Kong Journal of Ophthalmology (HKJO) online submission system at https://hkjo.hk/index.php/hkjo/about/submissions.\n\nBefore submission, please ensure that you article meets the requirements detailed below.\n\nBefore Submission\n\nGeneral\n\nHKJO adheres to the Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE; http://www.icmje.org), and the Core Practices of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE; https://publicationethics.org).\n\nSubmitted manuscripts must be original works that have not been published elsewhere (in whole, in part, or as a preprint) and are not under consideration by another publication.\n\nReporting Guidelines\n\nTo improve the quality and clarity of published articles, HKJO recommends the use of reporting guidelines in the preparation of manuscripts, such as those advocated by the EQUATOR Network (for example, CONSORT for randomized trials, or CARE for case reports).\n\nFunding\n\nAny sponsor(s) of the research involved, along with grant number(s) should be provided.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nAll authors must provide a statement reporting any conflicts of interest. Where none exist, please state ‘The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.’ Authors may use the ICMJE Conflict of Interest form.\n\nEthics\n\nAll studies must be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nFor all research involving living humans (including studies involving human tissue, retrospective studies, and database studies), an appropriate research ethics committee must be consulted. A statement must be included in the manuscript that provides the name of the research ethics committee and approval number (or waiver).\n\nA statement on consent must also be included, indicating how patient(s)/guardian(s) provided informed consent (eg, written or verbal), or that the requirement for patient consent was waived by the review board.\n\nIdentifying information must be removed from the manuscript; where this is impossible, for example a patient photograph, consent for publication must be provided by the patient.\n\nFor studies involving animals, appropriate ethics approval is required, and this should be stated in the manuscript.\n\nData availability\n\nThe authors shall make available the complete data on which the manuscript is based. A statement describing how the data can be accessed must be included in the manuscript (e.g., “The data are available from the corresponding author upon request.”). For clinical trials and other large datasets, HKJO recommends that data are deposited in a public repository and shared using a permanent identifier (such as a DOI).\n\nPreparation of Manuscripts\n\nIn general, manuscripts should be prepared following the ‘IMRaD’ structure as recommended by the ICMJE.\n\nBlinded Manuscript\n\nPlease provide a blinded manuscript as a single file, with figures and tables included. The title page (if any) should be provided separately. Any identifying information (eg, references to past publications, name of an author’s institution) should be masked or removed from the blinded manuscript. Manuscripts should be submitted in Word format (.doc or .docx).\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplementary material will only be considered in exceptional circumstances. Any such material should be submitted for review with the manuscript. Accepted supplementary material will be formatted and proofread by the Journal and published online only.\n\nLanguage\n\nManuscripts must be written in English. Please use US English spellings as per the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.\n\nAuthors\n\nFor each author, provide the full name, professional qualifications, and affiliation (where the study was conducted).\n\nThe full name, postal address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address of the corresponding author must be provided. The corresponding author, on behalf of the authors, is responsible for all contact with the Journal.\n\nTitle\n\nThe title should concisely convey the main topic of the study. Avoid obvious terms such as “a study of” or “novel”. If appropriate, please include the study design in the title (eg, ‘randomized controlled trial’, ‘systematic review’, ‘case report’). An abbreviated title of <45 characters is also required.\n\nAbstract\n\nAn abstract of ≤250 words is required for certain articles types, including Original Articles and Reviews. Please consult the Categories of Manuscripts for details. The abstract should provide a complete summary of the article, including the aims/purpose, main methods, key results, and conclusions. Abbreviations and clinical or technical jargon should be avoided.\n\nKey Words\n\nFive relevant index terms should be provided, selected from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh).\n\nTables\n\nTables should be typed using the ‘Insert Table’ feature of MS Word, with one item of data per cell and minimal formatting. Large tables may be provided in MS Excel format. Tables should be numbered and concisely titled. Abbreviations should be defined in footnotes.\n\nFigures\n\nThe number of figures should be restricted to the minimum necessary to support the textual material. Figures should be submitted in .jpg format with a resolution of 350 dpi or above. Figures should be included in the manuscript file; large image files may be submitted separately. Legends should be provided for each figure to indicate the anatomical area and pathological condition shown. All symbols and abbreviations should be defined in the legend.\n\nReferences\n\nThe references should be numbered in the order in which they are first cited in the text. Each reference citation should be in superscript Arabic numerals after full-stops and commas. At the end of the article, the full list of references should be presented in Vancouver style. Include the complete title, and names and initials of all authors. Examples are shown below:\n\nPeriodicals\n\nLewis T. Paroxysmal tachycardia. Heart 1909;1:43-72. (if more than three authors, please use \"et al.\" after the third).\n\nBooks (edited by other authors of article)\n\nFurman S. Pacemaker follow-up. In Barold SS, (eds): Modern Cardiac Pacing. Mount Kisco, New York, Futura Publishing Company, 1985, pp. 889-958.\n\nBooks (identical author and editor)\n\nChung EK. Principles of Cardiac Arrhythmias. Baltimore, MD, Williams & Wilkins, 1977, pp. 97-188.\n\nAbstracts\n\nSame as periodicals and followed by \"(abstract)\".\n\nPlease refer to the latest ICMJE recommendations on Manuscript Preparation for further information on references and for general guidance on style: http://icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/\n\nAcknowledgement(s)\n\nAny individuals who contributed substantially to the study but do not qualify for inclusion as authors should be acknowledged. Written permission from acknowledged individuals is required.\n\nAfter Submission\n\nCopyright\n\nOn acceptance of an article for publication in HKJO, copyright of the article is transferred to the Journal. The Journal has a fully Open Access policy, and publishes all articles under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). For any use other than that permitted by this license, written permission must be obtained from the Journal.\n\nPlagiarism and fabrication\n\nAll manuscripts are assessed for plagiarism using Turnitin (https://www.turnitin.com) before being sent for peer review.\n\nPeer review process\n\nThe HKJO follows a double-blind peer review system. After initial checks by the Editorial Office, all submissions are screened by the Editor-in-Chief. Papers that do not meet these requirements are rejected or returned to the authors for revision before peer review. New or revised papers that meet the minimum requirements of the journal are sent for peer review. All papers are reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. In the event of disagreement between the two reviewers, the paper is sent for a third review. The final decision rests with the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nEditing\n\nAccepted manuscripts undergo technical editing and copy-editing, so that style and language are consistent with international standards and HKJO style, and to ensure that articles can be clearly understood by our international readers. The corresponding author is sent the edited manuscript (galley proof). A few days are usually given for the authors to check the paper, respond to any queries, and to suggest changes. After acceptance, only minimal changes will be allowed; substantial changes will incur charges, and the addition of new material may require another round of peer review. Authors are responsible for all statements made in their work, including changes made by the copyeditor.\n\nProofs\n\nThe corresponding author is sent the final version (page proof) of the manuscript to proofread. The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that all authors read and approve the final version of the manuscript.\n\nCosts to Authors\n\nThere are no submission or page charges for publication in HKJO.\n\nSharing Your Article\n\nAuthors are encouraged to share their articles as widely as possible, to maximize readership and impact. Authors are recommended to always share articles with the DOI. This is a number beginning ‘10.12809/hkjo’ that should be shared as a URL (eg, https://doi.org/10.12809/hkjo). This will always link to the most recent version of the manuscript.\n\nPreprints\n\nPreprint servers, such as medRxiv and ResearchSquare, are becoming a popular way to disseminate research early. However, these papers are not peer reviewed before being made available to the public.\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\nFor selected high-priority papers, authors will receive a copy of the ‘Accepted Manuscript’. This version of the manuscript can be shared freely on personal websites and social media. The following text is recommended, using the article DOI included in the manuscript:\n\nThis is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published in Hong Kong Journal of Ophthalmology, available at [DOI].\n\nPlease do NOT publish this version of the manuscript on any public websites, such as institutional repositories or scholarly networking sites such as ResearchGate or Mendeley until after the embargo (the final publication date).\n\nVersion of Record"
