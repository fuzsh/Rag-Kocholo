        "text": "Identifying Hong Kong’s role and making it actually happen are two different things, especially amid wider geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nHong Kong must walk the talk, and get Beijing’s backing to showcase how ‘two systems’ is not only alive but working well.\n\nSCMP Plus adds valuable curation, context, analysis and opinion focused on our core area of expertise. The goal is to help you better make informed decisions while gaining a well-rounded perspective on events related to mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nXia Baolong, director of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, has economic focus for seven-day visit and will report back on city’s pulse after gauging public feedback.\n\nFast-changing Saudi Arabia is eager for foreign capital, including from Hong Kong. The city should now reach out to its citizens in the Middle East who have the connections and know-how to build trust and spur investments.\n\nHong Kong’s unique advantages including stronger international connectivity, greater conveniences and many freedoms are the envy of other cities but it can’t rest on its laurels.\n\nLast year was one of the city’s worst, but Hong Kong also received assurances that ‘one country, two systems’ had no expiry date, as well as witnessing a massive rollback of Covid-19 restrictions across China.\n\nMission of returning to global stage has not quite been accomplished by just making world leaders aware that city is gradually lifting Covid curbs.\n\nHong Kong is being compared to Singapore, and official assurances of the city’s good qualities are not enough.\n\nThis year, World News Day champions journalists who serve communities, those who go above and beyond. The Post’s coverage of Hong Kong’s housing crisis helps to tell the stories of the city’s poorest, so they can be heard and seen.\n\nWhile Hong Kong must operate as part of the nation, its high degree of autonomy also offers the chance to show the mainland what responses to the pandemic work.\n\nAssurances over future of ‘one country, two systems’ by Chinese President Xi Jinping follows recent tumultuous relationship between mainland and Hong Kong.\n\nIt would be odd for both sides to keep up any pretence of maintaining a distance, as political practices over time have changed.\n\nToday is an opportunity to pause and reflect on why journalism matters and how you, our readers, can support this crucial work.\n\nThe takeaway here is that the change of Hong Kong’s leadership cannot be subject to direct or indirect factors concerning the US.\n\nInstruction to Hong Kong to shoulder ‘main responsibility’ in containing fifth wave of infections is Xi’s first direct order to city as general secretary.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has been busy rolling out new measures but its efforts did not appear to be enough until Beijing stepped in over the weekend.\n\nBeijing has been tight-lipped on whether having a single candidate or more contenders is better for chief executive race on March 27.\n\nIn this issue of Global Impact, we look ahead to what we can expect in 2022.\n\nCommunique at end of Chinese Communist Party’s sixth plenum touched on city and self-ruled island for the first time, putting both under spotlight.\n\nUnique governing formula will mean ‘stick’ as well as ‘carrot’ if Beijing’s sovereignty is not recognised, but the telling story of Hong Kong is that one country, or ‘one China’ prevails, like it or not.\n\nState media has denied any Chinese version of a Robin Hood-style approach to wealth inequality, but message to city is loud and clear: it cannot rely on real estate to be its engine for future development.\n\nThe HK$7.5 million awarded to fencer Edgar Cheung for bringing home the city’s first gold in 25 years may seem like a princely sum, but even modestly sized flats can go for much more.\n\nNew bill ensuring only ‘patriots’ govern Hong Kong effectively signals an end to big business’ influence in shaping policies, but it does not mean a quick fix for deep-rooted livelihood issues, particularly the city’s housing problem."
