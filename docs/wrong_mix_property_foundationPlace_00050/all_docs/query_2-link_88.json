        "text": "We are living in an exciting and pivotal moment in Hong Kong history and its diaspora amid the recent wave of migration. In the United Kingdom alone, about 140,300 had arrived in the country on the British National Overseas visa route as at end-December 2023, since the scheme was introduced in late January 2021. Thousands have also relocated to other English-speaking countries, such as Australia and Canada.\n\nIn the UK, one is beginning to find more signposts of Hong Kong culture: think cha chaan teng in Brick Lane or the new brand of Hong Kong style milk tea, Cha Dong, which came about in supermarkets and online retailers to ease the longing of overseas Hong Kongers for a taste of home. Accompanying the seismic changes to the Hong Kong community and lifestyle is a burgeoning of diasporic writing across borders and languages. Generations of writers among the migrants are tapping into the shifting imaginary and sense of belonging.\n\nOf course, Hong Kong English literature has existed for a long time. Hong Kong-based journals, such as the online Asian Cha edited by Tammy Ho and bilingual magazine Voice & Verse edited by Chris Song, have been instrumental in developing a growing range of Hong Kong voices in both poetry and prose. However, many people are not convinced or confident enough to write creatively in English, nor do they feel that their writing can be appreciated by a wider audience.\n\nIn 2022, Eric Yip, born and raised in Hong Kong and now studying economics in Cambridge, won the UK’s national poetry competition with the poem, Fricatives, about his hometown. At 18, Yip became the youngest winner of the competition, a piece of news widely reported in Hong Kong media such as the South China Morning Post, as it kindled people’s interest in poetry. More importantly, his win encouraged younger writers in and outside Hong Kong to write creatively in English.\n\nYip and other young literary stars from Hong Kong – Tim Tim Cheng, Felix Chow, Louise Leung – have set up a pioneering YSHY.podcast channel to promote literary appreciation in Cantonese, offering a platform for Hong Kong writers to overcome language barriers when appreciating or writing contemporary literature. Owlish, a novel by Dorothy Tse, a prolific Hong Kong-born, Hong Kong-based Chinese-language fiction writer, was translated and published last year by Fitzcarraldo Editions. In the same year, Verve Poetry Press of Birmingham released Where Else, an anthology that I co-edited with Jason Eng Hun Lee and Tim Tim Cheng, featuring a wide range of poets connected to Hong Kong across Hong Kong, the UK and other places.\n\nMeanwhile, Kit Fan’s collection, The Ink Cloud Reader (Carcanet Press), was shortlisted for the TS Eliot Prize 2023 and the Forward Prize for Best Collection 2023, which also had Mary Jean Chan’s Bright Fear (Faber & Faber) on the shortlist. Certainly, the exciting achievements of these two Hong Kong-born poets have kindled new interest in the creative output of fellow writers from the city.\n\nHong Kong writing was a highlight in a special issue of Writing Chinese, an academic journal of the Leeds Centre for New Chinese Writing that I have guest-edited, and in a special issue of the multilingual journal, Transtext(e)s Transcultures, co-edited by me and Prof Gregory Lee, founding professor of Chinese studies at the University of St Andrews. In the UK, Canada, France and the United States, Cantonese studies, Hong Kong history and literary studies of English and translated works are also flourishing at universities. The University of St Andrews and University of Toronto, for example, host research centres on Cantonese studies.\n\nIn this column, we will be featuring some of the most exciting emerging and established voices from the diasporic Hong Kong community, as their fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction explore the shifting borders of migration, family history, culture and collective memories and the question of erasure. As a community, what kind of cultural lineage do we share? What do Hong Kongers care or write about?\n\nOur hope is that their works can inspire and inform the reader on the diverse themes and concerns of the growing, changing contemporary Hong Kong literature. Not only are we using this platform to encourage those who read and write, we also hope to make space for new voices, new ways of seeing and capturing Hong Kong. More broadly and importantly, we want to put on record our shared memories and experiences, lived or imagined, and above all to inspire imagination and hope, and appreciate what it means to have the creative spirit, imagination and strength of a Hong Konger."
