        "text": "A Hong Kong bookseller who went missing last year says he considered taking his own life many times while in custody in China.\n\nLam Wing-kee, 61, was the manager of a well-known bookstore that sold titles critical of the Chinese leadership.\n\nMr Lam was one of five booksellers who were imprisoned for months in cases that made international headlines.\n\nHe believes they were taken by an elite Chinese law enforcement group which targeted authors and booksellers.\n\nOne of the men, Gui Minhai, is still in custody.\n\nMr Lam, who was released on Tuesday, was the owner of the Causeway Bay Bookstore before it was purchased by Mr Gui in 2004.\n\nMr Lam told the BBC that he was accused after his arrest last October of trying to overthrow the Chinese government by mailing books to the mainland.\n\n\"They never told what the punishment for selling illegal books could be, or how long it might be. I had no idea. They could have sentenced me without consulting any sort of legal standard.\n\n\"Maybe I'd get five years in prison, or 10 years. I had no idea at all,\" he said.\n\nHe said that he had contemplated suicide in January and February but could not make any attempts because of the design of his cell.\n\n\"I was looking for a place up there to hang myself... but there wasn't,\" he said. He was not physically abused, he says, but endured months of solitary confinement, interrogations and psychological torture.\n\nHK bookseller's 'toothbrush suicide watch'\n\nMr Lam was arrested while visiting the Chinese city of Shenzhen. He says he was taken, blindfolded, to the eastern city of Ningbo, where he was held until March.\n\nIn March, when three of his colleagues were released and returned to Hong Kong, Mr Lam was transferred to a room in the city of Shaoguan in Guangdong province, where he said he enjoyed more freedom."
