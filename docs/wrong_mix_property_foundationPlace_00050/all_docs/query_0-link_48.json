        "text": "TKO Plaza, opened in 2004, is a prominent retail property of Nan Fung Group with a total mall area of around 34,910m². Embracing science-based targets initiatives (SBTi), the Group appointed Arup as the consultant to set corporate BST and lead TKO Plaza’s retro-commissioning.\n\nArup played a crucial role in establishing a carbon inventory and reviewing the performance of the Group’s portfolio, leading to strategic decarbonisation targets. For TKO Plaza specifically, we provided energy performance analysis during the retro-commissioning. This involved site investigation and trend-log data analysis to identify opportunities for operational improvement and energy management. With digital twin simulation and on-site measurement, project teams were able to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed measures, including the performance of environmental quality and carbon emissions.\n\nThis data-driven, collaborative corporate-asset approach has successfully steered TKO Plaza’s daily operations towards carbon neutrality – achieving a reduction of over 25% in energy use following retro-commissioning processes in 2018 and 2022.\n\nOrganised by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Hong Kong chapter, the award recognises organisations that have played pivotal roles in the design, construction, installation, commissioning, or operation of low-energy buildings with a high-quality built environment."
