Students meet with members from other groups who are assigned the same aspect, and after mastering the material, return to the “home” group and teach the material to their group members. With this strategy, each student in the “home” group serves as a piece of the topic’s puzzle and when they work together as a whole, they create the complete jigsaw puzzle.\n\nWhy use jigsaw?\n\nIt helps build comprehension.\n\nIt encourages cooperative learning among students.\n\nIt helps improve listening, communication, and problem-solving skills.\n\nHow to use jigsaw\n\nIntroduce the strategy and the topic to be studied.\n\nAssign each student to a “home group” of 3-5 students who reflect a range of reading abilities.\n\nDetermine a set of reading selections and assign one selection to each student.\n\nCreate “expert groups” that consist of students across “home groups” who will read the same selection.\n\nGive all students a framework for managing their time on the various parts of the jigsaw task.\n\nProvide key questions to help the “expert groups” gather information in their particular area.\n\nProvide materials and resources necessary for all students to learn about their topics and become “experts.”\n\nNote: It is important that the reading material assigned is at appropriate instructional levels (90–95% reading accuracy).\n\nDiscuss the rules for reconvening into “home groups” and provide guidelines as each “expert” reports the information learned.\n\nPrepare a summary chart or graphic organizer for each “home group” as a guide for organizing the experts’ information report.\n\nRemind students that “home group” members are responsible to learn all content from one another.\n\nWatch lesson (whole class, 5th grade)\n\nJennifer Dauphinais leads her fifth-grade students from Brennan Rogers Magnet School in New Haven, CT, through a jigsaw protocol. In a jigsaw protocol small groups of students become experts in one section or text and hear oral summaries of the others. The protocol allows students to synthesize across texts and gain new understandings from their classmates about the topic as a whole. (EL Education)\n\nWatch lesson (whole class, 2nd grade)\n\nGo inside Cathy Doyle’s second grade classroom in Evanston, Illinois to observe her students use the jigsaw strategy to understand the topic of gardening more deeply and share what they have learned. Joanne Meier, our research director, introduces the strategy and talks about the importance of advanced planning and organization to make this strategy really effective.\n\nCollect resources\n\nJigsaw graphic organizer 1\n\nJigsaw graphic organizer 2\n\nLesson Plan: American Folklore, a Jigsaw Character Study (opens in a new window) (grades 3-6). Groups of students read and discuss American folklore stories, each group reading a different story. Using a jigsaw strategy, the groups compare character traits and main plot points of the stories. A diverse selection of American folk tales is used for this lesson, which is adaptable to any text set. (ReadWriteThink)\n\nLearn how to use the jigsaw strategy across different content areas, including author studies, writing, and math. See example › (opens in a new window)\n\nLearn how one teacher used jigsaw to help her students develop their own definition of a fairy tale, and how her students responded to the self-directed activity. See example › (opens in a new window)\n\nVisit the Jigsaw Classroom, a site dedicated to teaching teachers how to use jigsaw to “reduce racial conflict among school children, promote better learning, improve student motivation, and increase enjoyment of the learning experience.” It also covers how teachers can facilitate the strategy with several different types of learners. See example › (opens in a new window)\n\nDifferentiate instruction\n\nFor second language learners, students of varying reading skill, and younger learners\n\nGive students experience with small group learning skills before participating in the jigsaw strategy.\n\nHave students fill out a graphic organizer in the “home group” to gather all the information presented by each “expert.”\n\n“Home groups” can present results to the entire class, or they may participate in some assessment activity.\n\nCirculate to ensure that groups are on task and managing their work well; ask groups to stop and think about how they are checking for everyone’s understanding and ensuring that everyone’s voice is heard; and\n\nMonitor the comprehension of the group members by asking questions and rephrasing information until it is clear that all group members understand the points.\n\nSee the research that supports this strategy\n\nAronson, E.
