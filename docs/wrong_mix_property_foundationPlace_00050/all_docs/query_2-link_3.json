        "text": "Hong Kong literature, the body of written works, primarily in Chinese but occasionally in English, produced in Hong Kong from the mid-19th century.\n\nWhen it was ceded to Great Britain in 1842, Hong Kong was a small fishing village with a population of about 15,000. There was no literature of any sort, until the launching of one of the first modern Chinese newspapers, Xunwan Ribao (“Cycle Daily”), in 1874 by Wang Tao, whose sympathy with the Taiping Rebellion generated hostility from the Qing dynasty that drove him into exile in Hong Kong. He also wrote critical essays, in beautiful classical Chinese, on literary and political issues, which were collected in Taoyuan wenlu waiban (1883; “Additional Essays of Wang Tao”).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines\n\nHong Kong literature remained for a time similar to traditional Chinese literature in its content, language, and style. The May Fourth Movement (1917–21), which brought a new and modern type of literature to the mainland, had little impact on Hong Kong. British colonial rulers found traditional literature, conservative and pro-authority, more agreeable. Hence, the visit of the great modern writer Lu Xun (Zhou Shuren) in 1927 received little attention because his radical ideas were not welcome at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, the first generation of local Hong Kong writers often published their work in the region’s first modern literary magazine, Banlu (1928; “Companions”). The first modern literary society, Daoshangshe (1929; “Island Association”), consisted of members such as Lu Lun (Li Linfeng), Zhang Wenbing, and Xie Chengguang. They modeled themselves on modern mainland Chinese writers and realistically depicted lives in the lower economic classes.\n\nDrastic changes took place when the Sino-Japanese War began in 1937. Many Chinese writers, including such prominent ones as Mao Dun, Xia Yan, Ba Jin, Xiao Hong, Xiao Jun, Dai Wangshu, and Xiao Qian, fled to Hong Kong and made it a base for anti-Japanese propaganda and literary activities. They either revived defunct mainland magazines or started new ones, the most notable being Wenyi Zhendi (“Literary Front”), which was edited by Mao Dun. Some of the writers’ most representative works—for example, Hulanhe zhuan (1942; Tales of Hulan River) by Xiao Hong—were written and published in Hong Kong. For the first time, Hong Kong literature seemed to be flourishing. However, these Chinese writers, who were subsequently labeled nanlai zuojia (“writers who came to the south”), had little concern about the development of Hong Kong literature. No attempt was made to foster local writers, whose opportunities to publish were limited because the literary magazines were dominated by the Chinese writers. When the Japanese occupied Hong Kong in 1942, the mainlanders left immediately, leaving its literary arena as quiet as ever.\n\nThe second migration of mainland writers came when civil war broke out in China in 1946. Apart from acting as a haven for personal safety, Hong Kong’s relative freedom of publication and speech allowed the two opposing camps—the Nationalists and the communists—to publicize their ideas and attack the others’. But again, their works had little local influence.\n\nThe establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 had long-term impact on Hong Kong literature. There was at first a two-way flow of writers: pro-communist authors returned to the mainland, while many others fled the new regime. The closing of the border in 1951 stopped the flow and served to isolate each region’s literary influences.\n\nDespite economic hardship and a small readership, many Hong Kong-based authors continued to write and publish. Some were aided by the Asia Foundation of the United States, building the so-called “Greenback culture” in Hong Kong literary history. Xu Xu (Xu Chuanzhong) and Xu Shu (Xu Bin) were highly productive writers of popular fiction. Li Huiying (Li Dongli), a novelist, and Sima Changfeng (Hu Ruoguo), an essayist, came to Hong Kong from Manchuria, which was attacked by the Japanese in 1931. The more significant poets were Li Kuang (Zheng Jianbo), He Da, and Ma Lang (Ma Boliang). In 1952 Shanghai-born Zhang Ailing returned to Hong Kong (she had attended the University of Hong Kong in 1939–41) and was commissioned to write two anticommunist novels, Yangge (1954; The Rice Sprout Song; written in English but first published in Chinese) and Chidi zhi lian (1954; Naked Earth).\n\nThese writers, like the earlier nanlai zuojia, considered their Hong Kong works a continuation of their past literary activities. They chiefly wrote about their mainland backgrounds and experiences. Seeing little hope of returning, they expressed strong nostalgia and homesickness, which constituted a major characteristic of their writings and demonstrated that they had little affiliation with their place of residence.\n\nThe situation changed gradually in the 1960s. Some non-native authors began to adapt to and started to write about Hong Kong. Additionally, a group of young writers who were born in Hong Kong or taken there in their infancy began to mature. The latter group categorically identified themselves with Hong Kong, and their Western education prompted the infusion of Western literary trends into their works, resulting in a style that differed greatly from that of their mainland counterparts.\n\nLiu Yichang came to Hong Kong in 1948 and was editor of the influential newspaper supplement Qianshuiwan (“Repulse Bay”) and, later, the long-lasting literary magazine Xianggang Wenxue (“Hong Kong Literature”). He experimented in various fictional forms, ranging from a lengthy stream-of-consciousness novel (Jiutu [1963; Drunkard]) to short sketches without plots.\n\nXi Xi (Zhang Yan) was arguably the greatest female writer from Hong Kong. She often depicted urban life, and Hong Kong was a prominent part of her novel Wo cheng (1979; My City) and the series of stories about the allegorical “Fertile Town” (Feitu Zhen). Other pieces, such as the poem “Xiang wo zheyangde yige nüzi” (1982; “A Woman Like Me”) and the novel Aidao rufang (1992; “Mourning for the Breast”), describe problems and feelings women encounter in society. On the other hand, Dai Tian (Dai Chengyi), a poet, and Dong Qiao (Dong Cunjue), an essayist, followed a mainly traditional mainland Chinese cultural path.\n\nYe Xi (Liang Bingjun) was a writer, cultural critic, and scholar who contributed to the introduction of a number of modern literary conventions into Hong Kong literature in the 1970s. Other writers who came into prominence at that time and had strong local identities are Xiao Xi (Lo Weiluan), essayist and literary historian; Wang Guobin, poet and essayist; Ji Hun (Hu Guoyan), Gu Cangwu (Gu Zhaoshen), and Wang Liangwo, all poets; and fiction writers such as Xin Qishi (Jian Muxian), Huang Biyun, Zhong Xiaoyang, and Dong Qizhang.\n\nMeanwhile, there was also an influx of writers from Taiwan into Hong Kong. Yu Guangzhong was famous for his highly refined poems that looked back fondly on Taiwan. Zhong Ling wrote outstanding short fiction. Shi Shuqing’s Hong Kong trilogy (Ta ming jiao Hudie [1993; “Her Name Is Butterfly”], Bianshan yang zijing [1995; “Bauhinia Are Everywhere”], Jimo yunyuan [1997; “The Lonely Garden”]) was her attempt to represent Hong Kong history.\n\nThe completion of negotiations with Britain in the 1980s for the return of Hong Kong to China, and the actual handover of Hong Kong back to China in 1997, brought another influx of mainlanders. Some of them took up writing, though, unlike previous generations, most were not established or mature writers. The better authors of this period are Yan Chun’gou, a short story writer; Wang Pu, a novelist; and Huang Canran, a poet.\n\nAlong with so-called serious literature, there has been a strong history of popular literature in Hong Kong. Newspaper supplements, which were particularly influential in the early to mid-20th century, contain serial fiction and short articles on various aspects of daily life in the city. The authors of these pieces adopted a mixture of vernacular Cantonese and simple classical Chinese, which they combined with slang and local references to make the writings comprehensible (and often highly amusing) only to local readers. The representative work of the popular San Su (Gao Dexiong) was Jingji riji (“Diary of a Salesman”). Another columnist who wrote many critical zawen (miscellaneous writings) about social phenomena was Ha Gong (Xu Guo), most notably in his Ha Gong guailun (1981; “Eccentric Essays by Ha Gong”).\n\nWuxia (martial art) novels were another genre that appeared in supplements. In 1955 Jin Yong (Zha Liangyong) started to serialize Shu jian en chou lu (The Book and the Sword) in Xinwanbao (“New Evening Post”), which he followed with 13 additional serialized novels in his own newspaper, Ming Pao. Another significant wuxia novel writer is Liang Yusheng (Chen Wentong).\n\nYi Shu (Ni Yishu) wrote mainly popular romances that catered to a mostly female audience. In science fiction, Ni Kuang (Ni Yiming), brother of Yi Shu, was a productive author whose works were imaginative and entertaining. Tang Ren (Yan Qingshu), a pro-communist writer, was famous for historical novels such as Jinling chunmeng (“Spring Dream of Nanjing”), a work about Chiang Kai-shek. Some of the works of Li Bihua (English pen name: Lilian Lee) in the 1980s and 1990s can also be considered historical. The more renowned ones are Bawang bie ji (1985; Farewell My Concubine; film 1993), Qinyong (1989; “A Terra-cotta Warrior”), and Chuandao fangzi (1990; The Last Princess of Manchuria)."
