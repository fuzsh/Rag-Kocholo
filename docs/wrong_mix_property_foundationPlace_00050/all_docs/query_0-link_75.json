        "text": "As Global Head of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, Tope partners with leaders across Ogilvy’s global network to develop and implement practices, policies, and programs that will ensure Ogilvy has a strong culture of belonging—one that fosters an open, equitable environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nTope joined Ogilvy from WPP where she was DE&I Lead responsible for driving inclusion strategy, partnerships, narrative, and insights. In this role, she developed programs that accelerated the progress and integration of diversity and inclusion across the organization which improved employee experience while driving business results—including WPPs first-ever Belonging Training, Safe Room Conversations, and Leadership Program for underrepresented groups. While at WPP Tope also served in a variety of project management and operations marketing roles supporting clients like T-Mobile and Google as well as WPP’s new business efforts. Prior to WPP, Tope spent the early years of her career at an investment bank developing people analytics capabilities across the business.\n\nBorn in Nigeria and raised in the UK, Tope is an award-winning DE&I advocate who has lived and worked in London, Germany, Singapore, Japan, and San Francisco—experience which has deepened her appreciation and championing for multiculturalism and inclusion. In 2018 she cofounded LevelSet—a global nonprofit connecting high potential individuals in Tech & STEM from underserved communities with mentors from similar fields with the aim to advance and empower the Black community with resources.\n\nIn her spare time, Tope enjoys curated travel, reading, tennis and yoga.\n\nYves is President and Co-Founder of Social.Lab Worldwide and the Global Lead of Ogilvy’s Social & Performance Expert Group. Social.Lab is a strategy, content, and media social specialist agency and part of the global Ogilvy network. Social.Lab combines audience-centric creativity with data-driven distribution to deliver effective results for modern marketers.\n\nYves is a serial entrepreneur with a 35-year career in creating and developing start-ups in the communications sector. His career began with the creation of Marketing Power in the 1990s, a direct marketing agency that he sold to DDB Belgium to which he served as CEO until 2007. In 2000, Yves co-created JustForYou, the largest e-mail marketing program in Belgium which was sold to Belgium’s leading telco two years later. He went on to co-found Radionomy in 2008, a worldwide platform that provides people with the tools and infrastructure to create, broadcast, promote, and monetize their own online radio stations, which sold to Vivendi in 2015.\n\nWhen Yves created Social.Lab with co-founder Gilles Bindels, they had the ambition to build a different type of social agency, combining hard working content ideas with smart targeting to bridge the traditional media and creative agency divide. Social.Lab was acquired by WPP/Ogilvy in 2013 and now has 13 offices on 4 continents—a dynamic community of 645 multidisciplinary specialists that combine content, creativity, and paid strategy with a performance focus.\n\nYves is a board member of several Ogilvy agencies including France, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, and Switzerland.\n\nDevika Bulchandani is a world-class marketer who leads with passion, purpose, and an uncompromising focus on creating impact. As Global CEO of Ogilvy she is responsible for all aspects of the creative network’s business which spans Advertising, PR, Consulting, Experience, and Health across 124 offices in 88 countries.\n\nUnder Devika's leadership, Ogilvy achieved three consecutive years of growth and garnered multiple accolades. The agency was acknowledged as one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies, received the Global Agency of the Year title from Adweek and Campaign, and secured Network of the Year honors at prestigious events like Cannes, the Clios, One Show, and LIA—often maintaining this recognition for multiple consecutive years.\n\nAs a leader who believes in the power of creativity to make a positive impact on society, Dev’s proudest achievements have occurred at the intersection of the social causes she champions and brand-building efforts on behalf of clients. From the iconic Fearless Girl campaign advocating for increased female representation on corporate boards, to the transformative Morning After Island initiative, instrumental in overturning a 2009 Honduras decree banning emergency contraception, to the mobilizing WOMAN CORP, driving the Equal Rights Amendment in the U.S., to Ogilvy’s ongoing collaboration with Dove to help end race-based hair discrimination through the passage of the CROWN Act—Devika has been the driving force behind work that transforms culture and society.\n\nBorn in India, she received her bachelor’s degree in English and Psychology at St. Xavier’s in Mumbai before going on to receive her master’s in Communications at the University of Southern California. Dev and her husband live in New York City with their son and daughter, whom they are raising to be enlightened individuals unafraid to change the world for the better.\n\nStacey is Ogilvy’s Global Chief Financial Officer and oversees all financial operations of the Ogilvy global network. She is also a member of the WPP Finance leadership team.\n\nBefore her current role at Ogilvy, Stacey most recently served as Global Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Geometry Global, where she was a driving force behind the agency’s transformation. Stacey played an important role in the deployment of a distinct and advanced technology platform, Living CommerceTM, to establish a new way of working that is agile, collaborative and reflects the needs of today’s modern marketers. Prior to that, Stacey was Global Chief Financial Officer of WPP Health & Wellness. Stacey originally joined Ogilvy in 1999 and held various regional and global leadership roles, including serving as the company’s Worldwide Controller until 2018. She began her career at PricewaterhouseCoopers where she consulted on financial statement audits, mergers and acquisitions and IPOs for major multinational advertising and publishing clients from Simon & Schuster to Viacom’s MTV Network.\n\nStacey has been featured by Black Enterprise Magazine as one of the 75 Most Powerful Women in Business and is often called upon to speak about diversity and inclusion, and the importance of increased representation across all levels of the marketing and communications industry.\n\nDavid Ford is a strategic communications leader who has leveraged the power of storytelling and creativity to drive cultural impact throughout his career. He currently serves as Ogilvy’s Global Chief Communications Officer.\n\nAs Ogilvy’s chief brand champion, David manages the reputation of one of the world’s most recognized and award-winning creative companies. His responsibilities include driving all global external and internal communications, evangelizing the strength of the company’s global creative network which spans 131 offices in 93 countries, and promoting the company's offering to clients across Advertising, PR, Consulting, Experience, and Health. Since joining Ogilvy in 2019, he has helped bolster the creative network’s standing with Campaign magazine naming Ogilvy its 2022 Global Network of the Year.\n\nDavid has extensive experience leading communications teams spanning the advertising and media industries. Prior to joining Ogilvy in 2019, David worked for first-class organizations including ABC News, where he drove media relations strategy and served as a spokesman for several anchors and broadcasts including ‘World News with Diane Sawyer’ as well as the news division’s breaking news, political, international, and investigative units. In 2013 he oversaw communications strategy for the launch of Fusion TV, a cable network formed as a joint venture of Disney/ABC and Univision; he added oversight of the network’s marketing efforts in 2015. David later played a critical role as Fusion grew from a Miami-based cable network to a national media company through the acquisitions of recognizable digital brands such as Gizmodo, Jezebel, Deadspin, and The Onion. Earlier in his career, David was a publicist at The Karpel Group, the entertainment industry's gold standard for LGBTQ market outreach, and worked in Corporate Marketing at Wenner Media, which previously published Rolling Stone, Us Weekly, and Men’s Journal.\n\nDavid is currently the co-chair of the 4A’s Agency Communications Committee and served on the 2021 Public Relations Jury for The One Show. He has a B.A. in Music Industry from the SUNY College at Oneonta and currently lives in New York with his partner and their golden retriever Maddie.\n\nHoracio is Executive Partner, Chief Executive, Latin America and has led Ogilvy’s Latin American operations since January 2017.\n\nUnder Horacio’s leadership, Ogilvy Latin America has been recognized by Cannes Lions as Latin America Regional Network of the Year for four consecutive years, earning its latest designation in 2022.\n\nHoracio joined Ogilvy in 1993 in Argentina as an Account Supervisor. He was soon promoted to Account Group Director where he oversaw clients such as Duracell, IBM, SmithKline-Beecham and Mercedes Benz.
