        "text": "Hong Kong Business Registration is an official document that outlines the legal parameters within which businesses can operate in Hong Kong.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRegistering a business in Hong Kong is the initial step in leveraging its market potential.\n\nBusiness registration is governed by the Companies Ordinance, which outlines legal parameters for operation. It is managed by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD).\n\nBusiness Registration Certificate (BRC) confirms official registration, used for bank accounts, contracts, licenses, and demonstrating legitimacy.\n\nThe Business Registration Number will be known as the Unique Business Identifier (UBI) and will serve as the Tax Identification Number (TIN).\n\nHong Kong is an attractive market for investors and entrepreneurs from all over the world, with China and the Asia-Pacific region right on its doorstep.\n\nThe city consistently ranks as the world's freest economy as an international economic center with excellent technology infrastructure.\n\nThe administration's pro-business attitude, tax incentives for startups, a productive legal system, and world-class tech infrastructure have all contributed to this.\n\nThe first step in using Hong Kong's potential is to establish a company there. Continue reading to learn everything you need to know about business registration in Hong Kong.\n\nUnderstanding Hong Kong Business Registration\n\nThe Companies Ordinance of Hong Kong can help anyone who wants to register a business in Hong Kong. This is an official document that outlines the legal parameters within which businesses can operate in Hong Kong.\n\nThe business registration office, managed by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), is responsible for processing new business registrations.\n\nHere are some other facts concerning Hong Kong company registration that individuals and corporations should be aware of:\n\nDirectors\n\nThere must be at least one individual director, with no limitations or restrictions on the director's location or country. The maximum number of directors is also uncapped.\n\nShareholders\n\nIn Hong Kong, a limited liability company must have at least one shareholder and a maximum of 50. Shareholders are not subject to any residence requirements.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there is no minimum share capital requirement for registration. Therefore, the most frequent approach is to establish a company with HKD 10,000 share capital. Because one share in Hong Kong has a minimum paid-up capital of HKD 1.00, this capital is represented by 10,000 ordinary shares of HKD 1.00.\n\nTax\n\nHong Kong levies taxes on a territorial basis. That is, registered companies only pay corporate tax on Hong Kong-based transactions. Furthermore, there is no withholding tax on earnings and interest, nor is there any collection of tax on social security benefits, nor is there any VAT sales tax.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are two alternatives for profit tax rates. The first is the Single-Tier Corporate Tax System, which levies a 16.5 percent tax on assessable profits on corporations and a 15% tax on unincorporated businesses. The second alternative is the Two-Tier Profits Tax Regime, which lowers the tax rate to 8.5 percent for the first $2 million in assessable profits for both companies and unincorporated businesses.\n\nFor companies that do not actually engage in business in Hong Kong, the tax rate is 0%, also known as the offshore tax system.\n\nCompany Secretary\n\nAny limited liability company requires a company secretary who lives in Hong Kong. The company secretary serves as the company's representative in Hong Kong, ensuring that the firm's operations are conducted in accordance with local regulations. The company secretary is also responsible for keeping the firm's statutory books and records.\n\nCompliance\n\nAfter a company has been officially registered in Hong Kong, the owners, directors, and company secretary are responsible for ensuring that accounts are properly prepared and maintained.\n\nIn Hong Kong, accounts must be audited by a certified public accountant every year. Audited accounts must then be submitted to Hong Kong's Inland Revenue Department.\n\nOpening a Corporate Bank Account\n\nCompanies that want to use reliable payment gateway providers like Stripe and PayPal should normally use banks in the same territory. The following documents are necessary to open an account in Hong Kong:\n\nAccount application forms\n\nCorporate registration documents\n\nCopies of passports of major members\n\nPersonal resume\n\nA bank reference letter of each major member\n\nA bank statement of each major member or any related corporate\n\nProof of business such as agreements, invoices, and contracts of the current company or any related one\n\nBenefits of Business Registration In Hong Kong\n\nBefore we go into the requirements of business registration in Hong Kong, it's crucial to understand the advantages of forming a company in the territory. These advantages are listed below:\n\nThe procedure of forming a business in Hong Kong is quick, easy, and inexpensive. After an application is approved, the Certificates of Incorporation and Business Registration (“the Certificates”) are usually accessible within four working days.\n\nHong Kong, along with Singapore, has earned a reputation as the world's most open jurisdiction.\n\nHong Kong ranked 7th in the latest Global Competitiveness Booklet 2023.\n\nIn Baker McKenzie & Oxford Economics' Global Transactions Forecast 2020, Hong Kong is ranked 2nd in Asia-Pacific for IPO and M&A activity.\n\nForeign investors can manage their Hong Kong-based company from anywhere in the world. They only require a local holding address rather than a physical address.\n\nProfits earned outside of Hong Kong are tax-free, but money earned in Hong Kong is subject to a 17% income tax rate on earnings exceeding 200,000 HKD.\n\nHong Kong is strategically placed in Asia alongside many of the region's most advanced business markets, such as China, Singapore, and South Korea.\n\nThe city's legal system is separate from that of Mainland China and is based on English common law. Hong Kong's two main languages are English and Cantonese.\n\nTypes of Business Entities In Hong Kong\n\nIt's critical to choose the right company type when starting a business in Hong Kong. The following are the main business types:\n\nLimited Company\n\nLimited businesses are one of the most common options for companies forming in Hong Kong, as they are unrestricted in their activities.\n\nTax exemptions on income derived from overseas operations are available to a company incorporated in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is, therefore, an ideal place for establishing a holding company or a corporate headquarters.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are only a few prerequisites for forming a company, including only one director and one shareholder (who can be of any nationality). A resident company secretary is also required.\n\nLimited companies are legal entities that can conduct business independently of their owners.\n\nAlthough corporate shareholders are popular, Hong Kong company law prohibits corporate directors.\n\nAt their annual general meetings, limited companies must present audited accounts and tax returns.\n\nMinimum share capital is not limited, and limited company incorporation does not require government approval in Hong Kong.\n\nA company's share capital can be in any currency, including the USD, EUR, GBP, and HKD.\n\nBranch Office\n\nBecause branch offices are considered extensions of their parent corporation, they lack their own legal identity.\n\nA branch office is suitable for organizations that need to start doing business right away or for businesses that only sell in Hong Kong.\n\nThe parent business bears both positive and negative financial consequences for a branch company.\n\nHong Kong branch offices are allowed to conduct business within the parent company's guidelines. They can only do business in Hong Kong if they have the necessary licenses.\n\nA Hong Kong branch office can open for business up to one month before registering with the Hong Kong Companies Registry.\n\nWithin a month of opening a branch office in Hong Kong, overseas enterprises must register as a “Registered Non-Hong Kong Company.”\n\nIn Hong Kong, branch offices are allowed to sign local sales contracts, invoice local consumers, and collect revenue from local customers.\n\nA Hong Kong branch office is not required to provide audited financial statements with its yearly returns and tax filings.\n\nRepresentative Office\n\nIn Hong Kong, a representative office is exempt from making direct sales.\n\nRepresentative offices in Hong Kong are only allowed to conduct market research and promote the parent company's products.\n\nCompanies with simply a representative office in Hong Kong must hire a local distributor or agent to offer their products and services to local customers.\n\nDue to the limitations in business activity, a representative office is excellent for enterprises intending to enter Hong Kong to conduct market research and investigate potential opportunities.\n\nDocuments Needed for Business Registration In Hong Kong\n\nAll the documents must be prepared when going through the business registration process in Hong Kong. These are outlined below:\n\nArticles of Association\n\nThese are a set of rules that govern how a board of directors can run a business. It's often viewed as a contract between employees and members of the company and the company.\n\nA company registration form must also be completed with the following information:\n\nThe company name\n\nThe registered business address\n\nAn accurate description of the company's main activities\n\nDetails relating to the company's shareholders, directors, and company secretary\n\nFor firms with non-Hong Kong shareholders and directors, copies of passports and proof of residence in their respective countries are required\n\nIf a company has local shareholders and directors, copies of their identity documents should be submitted\n\nA copy of the parent company's company registration documents is required in the event of corporate shareholders\n\nCompany directors' responsibilities\n\nTotal share capital\n\nIf any documents are provided in a language other than English, an English-translated document must be provided as well.\n\nA Quick Look at Business Registration Certificate HK\n\nA Business Registration Certificate (BRC) in Hong Kong is a crucial document that confirms your business is officially registered with the local authorities. It serves as proof of your business's legal existence and allows you to operate lawfully in Hong Kong.\n\nWhat's on a Business Registration Certificate?\n\nYour business name (both Chinese and English, if applicable)\n\nYour Business Registration Number (BR Number)\n\nYour company type (sole proprietorship, partnership, limited company, etc.)\n\nYour registered office address\n\nThe date of your business registration\n\nWhat's the Business Registration Certificate used for?\n\nOpening a business bank account\n\nEntering into contracts\n\nApplying for licenses and permits\n\nDemonstrating your business legitimacy to potential clients or partners"
