The in-depth analysis of \"north-bound\" film directors such as Tsui Hark and Ann Hui brings to light their creative and at times ambiguous roles in bringing state propaganda to young audiences. This is an important book for understanding the developments of the former British colony’s film industry in the era of cross-border integration.\n\n– Po-Shek Fu, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\n\nIn a cultural realm where nationalist fervor and market incentives are intertwined, Chu spotlights the imprints of a versatile Hong Kong left by some of the city’s directors on Chinese main(land) melody films. Packed with lively details and narrated with zest, this book is an impressive record of these directors’ creative ventures in a vast new entertainment network.\n\n– Rey Chow, Duke University"
