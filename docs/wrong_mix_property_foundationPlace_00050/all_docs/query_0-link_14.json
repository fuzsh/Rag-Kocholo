        "text": "Benedict Rogers, Co-founder and Chief executive\n\nBenedict Rogers is the co-founder and Chief Executive of Hong Kong Watch. Ben launched Hong Kong Watch, together with other co-founders, in Speaker’s House in the British Parliament on 10 December 2017, just two months after he was denied entry to Hong Kong on the orders of Beijing, and served as the Chair of Trustees of Hong Kong Watch from 2017-2020. Before joining Hong Kong Watch as the Chief Executive in September 2020, Ben was the East Asia Team Leader at the international human rights organisation CSW, where he specialised in Myanmar, Indonesia, North Korea and China. He is also the co-founder and Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, a member of the advisory group of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), an advisor to the World Uyghur Congress, Senior Analyst for East Asia at CSW, a trustee of several other charities, author of six books and a regular contributor to international media. He has testified in hearings in the British Parliament, European Parliament, Japanese Parliament and United States Congress and is a regular speaker around the world. Between 1997 and 2002, he lived and worked as a journalist in Hong Kong, and in 2003 he lived and worked in Washington, DC.\n\nAnouk Wear, Research and Policy Advisor (USA)\n\nAnouk Wear 華穆清 is a Research and Policy Advisor at Hong Kong Watch, based in Washington DC. She is from both Hong Kong and the USA.\n\nAfter obtaining her BA in Social Anthropology from the University of Cambridge and her LLM in Public International Law from Leiden University, she worked as a professional researcher and translator on topics related to international law and human rights in the China region, including the Uyghur region. Anouk focuses on cultural rights, freedom of expression, digital rights, labor rights, and democracy, and she works in English, French, Cantonese and Mandarin.\n\nTED HUI\n\nTed Hui Chi Fung is a Hong Kong politician in exile, having previously served as a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council for four years (2016 –2020) and the District Council for ten years (2011 –present). Ted’s areas of focus within the legislature included human rights, administration of justice, constitutional affairs, education and environmental affairs.\n\nTed studied at the University of Toronto and graduated from the City University of Hong Kong with a Bachelor of Laws (Hon.) degree.\n\nDuring the 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition movement for freedom, Ted actively participated in the frontline protests as peacemaker, often mediating between riot police and protesters. Having first-hand experience of police brutality and abuses, Ted raised funds from the public and launched private prosecutions and judicial reviews against the police and the Hong Kong government.\n\nIn 2020, Ted was arrested and prosecuted for his participation in a protest frontline in 2019. He was then further arrested and prosecuted for his acts of protest and speeches made during parliamentary sessions, with charges such as contempt of legislature and obstructing council security guards.\n\nIn December 2020, Ted announced his exile during an official visit in Denmark while on court bail. He subsequently lived in exile in the UK, and then relocated to Australia.\n\nFollowing the imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong in July 2020, Ted has been put on the police wanted list for arrest. Court arrest warrants were also issued against him for absence from trials during his exile. It is anticipated that political charges against him would lead to life imprisonment if Ted returns to Hong Kong.\n\nTed Hui is one of the initiators of the 2021 Hong Kong Charter. In that historical document, he pledges his life determination to advocate Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy and join hands with the Hong Kong diaspora to revive Hong Kong.\n\nPETER MATTIS\n\nPeter Mattis is an International Senior Fellow with the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). He joined ASPI from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) where he served as the Senate-appointed staff director. In addition to his duties with the CECC, he also served as an advisor to Senator Marco Rubio and was a part of the legislative team that passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, and the Tibetan Policy and Support Act. Mr. Mattis previously was a fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, where he also edited the foundation's biweekly China Brief, and at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. He also worked as an analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Mattis has written and spoken widely about the Chinese Communist Party and PRC politics, foreign policy, internal security, intelligence, and political influence activities. He is the author of Analyzing the Chinese Military: A Review Essay and Resource Guide on the People’s Liberation Army (2015) and co-author of Chinese Communist Espionage: An Intelligence Primer (2019).\n\nDIMON LIU\n\nDimon Liu has been an activist on human rights since 1972.\n\nIn 1989, she initiated an intervention at the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights, which resulted in an unprecedented UN reprimand against China on human rights abuse. This was documented in “Human Rights Exception No Longer” in The Mirror Cracked: China After Tiananmen; published in 1990.\n\nIn 1992, Dimon worked on inserting a clause into the United States Hong Kong Act to protect Hong Kong, which was activated with an amendment in 2019.\n\nIn 1993, she organized and represented more than 200 Asian NGOs in a speech against the notion of “Asian values” at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, which protected the concept of the “universality” of human rights.\n\nDimon initiated the annual People’s Liberation Army Conference at Staunton Hill, Virginia from 1990 to 1998.\n\nHer writings on human rights, the rule of law, democracy, and military strategy have appeared in many publications, including the Asian Wall Street Journal, Newsday, and the Hong Kong Economic Journal. She has written for the Department of Defense, and is the co-editor of the 1996 book, China’s Military Modernization."
