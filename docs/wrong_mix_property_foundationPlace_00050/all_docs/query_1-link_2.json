        "text": "When we needed volunteers to help in Hong Kong at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak, Lauretta didn’t hesitate to raise her hand and jump on a plane — with two huge suitcases filled with P.P.E. for the office. During the course of her three-week stint, she proved herself invaluable, working on news, enterprise, the live briefing, and whatever else we tossed her way. (There was even a Lauretta byline with a Hong Kong dateline.)\n\nLauretta was a perfect fit, and we are now thrilled to welcome her to a permanent assignment in the Hong Kong newsroom as an editor, working with correspondents across the region.\n\nLauretta joined The New York Times in 2018 on the National desk as the editor of Race/Related. She has played the role of editor and writer on the newsletter, which has seen the number of subscribers triple. As an editor, she has helped guide our coverage of race around the newsroom, including working with reporters on the legacy of Emmett Till’s murder in Mississippi, an investigation into a mutiny at one of the nation’s top civil rights organizations and a dispatch from a small town in Minnesota where high school students wrestled with the consequences of casual racism.\n\n“Lauretta is a deep thinker and a careful editor,” said Marc Lacey, who recruited her. “She’ll no doubt bring the same inquisitive spirit she brought to race coverage to our Asia report.”\n\nBefore coming to The Times, Lauretta worked at The New Yorker as well as New York Magazine. At The New Yorker, she edited stories about politics, culture and international affairs for the website. At New York Magazine, she wrote about music and pop culture for Vulture, interviewing artists such as Steve Albini, Drake and Brian Wilson.\n\nLauretta started her career in book publishing, at a time when “ebooks” were considered an inconsequential part of an author’s contract. She also has music credentials, having worked at the Public Theater to promote live cabaret performances at Joe’s Pub.\n\nLauretta will head to Hong Kong sometime this summer.\n\nPlease join us in congratulating Lauretta on her new role.\n\nMichael, Adrienne, Greg and Carlos"
