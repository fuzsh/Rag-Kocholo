        "text": "These weekly Meet the Author zoom meetings with narrative practice authors bring people together from many different parts of the world. Some have referred to them as ‘pop-up communities’! Hosted by Dulwich Centre Foundation, the University of Melbourne and Evanston Family Therapy Center (USA), we look forward to seeing you at a future session.\n\nUpcoming sessions:\n\nThe next Meet the Author features Michelle Bates\n\nTuesday 6th August, 4:30pm (Adelaide/Tarntanya, Australia time)\n\nThis event is being held online on Zoom, please register here\n\nMore details coming soon!\n\nThere will not be a session on Tuesday July 30.\n\nPast sessions:\n\nWe’re delighted to invite you to the online launch of a new web resource featuring videos, articles, audio clips and songs from a wide range of narrative practitioners from Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda, Rwanda, Somalia, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Zanzibar/Tanzania as well as from Africans in the diaspora.\n\nThis free resource has been quite some years in the making.\n\nIt features sparkling work with children, adults, families and communities provides moving and skilful ways of assisting those who are suffering. There are so many African contributions to the field of narrative therapy and community work and many of these are conveyed in this resource. Also included are videos from the 13th International Narrative Therapy and Community Work Conference that took place in Kigali, Rwanda, in 2022.\n\nMany of the practitioners whose work appears in the resource will be part of the online launch.\n\nWe hope you can join us for this celebration, which will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please explore African-centred narrative practices: A rich history and constant invention\n\nAnd then bring your questions!\n\nLyra (pronounced LEE-dah) Barrera is a Licensed Clinical Psychologist and a Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist working in private practice at Larchmont Associates in Los Angeles. She earned degrees in Psychology from Harvard University, Pepperdine University, and the California School of Professional Psychology. Her areas of academic emphasis included Women’s Studies; Marriage, Child, and Family Therapy; and Multicultural Community Clinical Psychology. Lyra has provided training and supervision in both agency and private-practice settings. She has been working with individuals and couples at Larchmont Associates since 1998.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Narrative Therapy for Lyra is its insistence on giving voice to marginalised ideas, knowledges, and experiences. One way to honour that intention and bring those knowledges forward is by asking tiny questions — questions about the details of people’s lives.\n\nWe believe that it is a political act to engage in conversation with someone about their life — the way we hear, the things we say, and the questions we ask all have effects. From this perspective, if a person describes their life in a general or broad way, and we respond by stopping our inquiry and settling on this broad account, we run the risk of reducing their experience to a pre-made/pre-existing standard that was not created by them, their family, or their community.\n\nFrom a narrative way of thinking, every utterance of ours is an opportunity to get closer and closer to a telling of the person’s life that is exquisitely specific to their lived experience – a telling that in its detail activates nuance and possibility that can be noticed, seen, and known by only the person telling it. It is through our pursuit of specificity that we co-create meaning that is truly liberating.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tiffany Sostar. Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Tiny Questions and read the companion piece of writing by Lyra.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Lyra!\n\nCarol was drawn to narrative ideas way back in 1990 when she was introduced to Michael White’s ideas via colleagues. Since then, Carol has done lots of workshops with Michael, David Epston and Jill Freedman and Gene Coombs and the Dulwich team. These explorations have helped her practice and thinking travel – as well as numerous long plane journeys! Carol’s white privileged thinking was firmly taken in hand by the Just Therapy Team in Aotearoa/New Zealand and how this impacts on her way of being in the world as well as her practice. She has enjoyed working in NHS in UK as Consultant lead Family therapist in West London Mental Health trust Child and Adolescent Mental Health service for many years alongside teaching in UK and internationally.\n\nBen is a family therapist who lives on Whajuk country in Perth, Western Australia. He has many years of experience working primarily in social work and child and adolescent mental health in London, UK, and in Perth. He is an associate of The Institute of Narrative Therapy (UK) and part of the teaching faculty of PartnershipProjectsUK and Dulwich Centre. In recent years, Ben has worked with families in diverse contexts, including with CYPRESS (Children & Young People’s Responsive Suicide Support). CYPRESS is a postvention counselling service provided by Anglicare WA, working with children, young people and their families bereaved by suicide. He also works in independent practice as a family therapist and supervisor.\n\nJust as language is political, so too is the way we listen to people. Our listening shapes the way we witness and respond to others and the stories of life that are co-constructed in the process. Co-constructing resiliences includes returning the gaze on the political and social contexts in which harm to people takes place. In the process, we explore listening practices associated with therapeutic activism (D’Arrigo-Patrick et al., 2017) and the generative potential offered by tuning into the meanings people attribute to their responses to violence and how people do resilience in their lives offers. This article will demonstrate how Carol and Ben’s work with a family has led them to think about how we can all be jointly sustained in the work by making moments and practices of resistance and resilience visible. They will explore how these practices can enhance a sense of personal agency and create experiences of vicarious resilience (Hernandez-Wolfe, 2018) that help people access more possibilities in their lives.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tiffany Sostar.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Listening as activism: Re-thinking resilience and justice-doing as a response to trauma and listen to this interview with Carol and Ben on The Radical Therapist podcast.\n\nWith thanks to Journal of Family Therapy for providing free access to this article for Meet the Author participants. The article will be unavailable following this session.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Carol and Ben!\n\nLoretta lives and work in Western Sydney on Dharug Country, and she has Irish/English heritage. Loretta’s current work is a mix of supervision and counselling and she is also temporarily managing an Intensive Family Preservation team, working to keep families safely together and out of the child protection system. Most of her work has been working with women who are experiencing distress and she worked for 17 years at a free service with families using a narrative approach to counselling, group work and case management. Loretta is passionate about walking alongside people as they go through hard times.\n\nLoretta is interested in the feminist underpinnings of narrative practice, and has found this a supportive approach to listening to stories of hardship, making sense of our experiences and seeking solidarity.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tiffany Sostar. Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Voice and solidarity from Loretta’s new book and then come together to consider ways we can explore the social and political contexts of people’s experiences of ‘depression’ and ‘anxiety’ and create pathways for solidarity.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Loretta!\n\nMeet the Interviewer with Mark Hayward\n\nMark Hayward studied with Michael White for many years and has a keen interest in the practice maps Michael White developed and ways to teach these maps. He is a founding director of The Institute of Narrative Therapy based in UK and part of the Dulwich Centre teaching faculty.\n\nThis is a chance to critique practice! (And critique its relationship with theory)\n\nTake a look at one or both of the live clinical interviews of the two Statement of Position/Externalising Conversation maps and come with any thoughts about:\n\nQuestions you might have asked differently.\n\nQuestions you might not have asked at all.\n\nQuestions you would like to have seen asked.\n\nNon-map interviewing possibilities\n\nLimitations of the map or its value\n\nHow you might offer supervision to the interviewer.\n\nEtc!\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Statement of Position Map 1 and/or Statement of position Map 2 from Dulwich Centre’s Maps of Narrative Practice online course.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Mark!\n\nCelebrate International Refugee Week with us by participating in a discussion on how stories shape our sense of ‘Home’. We invite you to listen to episodes of a mini podcast series hosted by Sarah, where she engages with individuals involved in grassroots community events that share refugee stories to create awareness and foster reflection and positive action. These dialogues, extensions of Sarah’s research, offer profound insights into the experiences and learnings of those sharing personal narratives or creating platforms to amplify diverse voices within their communities.\n\nThis session will offer a chance to reflect on the podcast episodes and discuss the power of storytelling in fostering inclusive communities. Together, we’ll ponder how each of us can contribute to creating a shared home in this world and explore how storytelling can impact our own lives and communities.\n\nSarah Strauven is a psychologist and narrative therapist. Specialising in refugee mental health and complex trauma, she worked alongside people seeking asylum for ten years in Belgium. Her doctoral research explored grassroots community initiatives in Australia where people with and without refugee experience co-create a shared world through narrative practices. Sarah is currently a research fellow in post-disaster mental health at the University of Melbourne. She is passionate about translational research to support community recovery and improve access to care for marginalised groups. She also maintains an independent practice ‘Liminal Spaces’ (www.liminalspaces.net.au).\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please listen to the podcast series People with and without refugee experience co-creating a shared world through narrative practices\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Sarah!\n\nSabine Vermeire works at the Interactie-Academie, a training and therapy centre in Antwerp, Belgium. For more than 30 years she has been engaged in several youth care projects and goes on therapeutic journeys with children, youngsters and families in contexts of trauma, violence and abuse. She leaves the beaten tracks in playful, creative ways when speaking becomes difficult. Sabine is a Narrative and Systemic trainer, psychotherapist and supervisor and responsible for the year-long training ‘Narrative Therapy and Community work’ and the postgraduate ‘Family counselling’ at Interactie-Academie. As an associated trainer at The Institute of Narrative Therapy (UK) and at the faculty of Dulwich Centre she shares her work with children, youngsters and families. She has published several articles and books on this work.\n\nDanny Keuppens worked 15 years as a theatre director. After creating a performance in a closed juvenile facility, he switched to youth services. Danny began to work with adolescents and parents, studied systemic and narrative counseling and started Parcoeur, a project in which young people work creatively with their life stories. Within Parcoeur he directs theatre performances and – together with his son Warre – documentaries, such as ‘The Suns of Zone 050’ and ‘Chelsea’s Blues’.\n\nAfter hardship or traumatic experiences in childhood times, young people often get stuck in solidified stories about themselves, their lives and relationships. Using theatre, documentary film and other artwork in therapy and community work can be helpful in re(dis)covering a sense of agency, belonging and coherence and in finding new pathways to go on in life. Making this work public is an inseparable part and can be considered as a form of social action. Sabine and Danny will be sharing their experiences and ideas of re-walking with youngsters through their lives, re-dis-covering old and new, alternative stories and the co-creation of a documentary film of this process. Through life review interviews and re-visiting important people and places, these youngsters can again become the authors or directors of their own lives in ongoing dialogues with many people involved, while moment-by-moment, more coherent and hopeful stories emerge.\n\nThe documentary ‘Chelsea’s Blues’ tells the story of Chelsea Smekens-Demedts (19). She was placed in youth care shortly after her birth. Danny, as a narrative counsellor, made this film in collaboration with his son Warre. Through watching the documentary, you get the opportunity to see and experience how creative pathways invite these young people to go on a re-dis-covery journey and take a new stance in relation to their lives and the hardship. By watching the documentary, you become a witness and Chelsea’s life, her efforts and responses but also skills and knowledge can be acknowledged in multiple ways. We also hope it opens some new perspectives on these young people and youth care!\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Chelsea’s Blues (unavailable after the session) and read the accompanying article Chelsea’s Blues: A documentary of hope about growing up in youth care by Danny Keuppens.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Sabine and Danny!\n\nPoh is a practitioner interested in considering non-extractive and decolonial approaches to engaging with lived experience, whether this be in therapeutic, community or creative processes. For many years Poh was engaged in co-research with people and communities responding to themes of experience within family and state violence, displacement (from rights, land, home, body, identity, relationships), liminality and reclaiming practices of staying with experience and preference. Poh collaborated on the award winning film Island of the Hungry Ghosts (2018) with director, Gabrielle Brady and for the past decade has been innovating with narrative therapy to create workshops and consultations that offer anti-oppressive pathways, movements and possibilities in creative, research and therapeutic projects and practices. To find out more visit www.narrativeimaginings.com\n\nWhat happens when we shift from viewing our bodies as a single entity or story to experiencing and consulting our bodies as a community of diverse members each with their own experience, position and stories? What might it be like if we can resist narrating for members of body and instead be curious to lively, creative and community-centred exchanges? These practices and ideas honour decolonial feminist(s) movement within narrative co-research to actively reappear communities and the multiple members and bodies we are in relationship with moment-by-moment.\n\nThe accompanying video fragment is shared with the hope of offering a possible place on the landscape to invite a gentle unpacking around the theme of agreement. Recently, in a consultation group for our multi-storied bodies practice and ideas we began our conversation with a welcome/warm up exercise. Beginning with warm up/welcome exercises is a way we can begin to unlearn assumptions of how we are supposed to arrive. Warm up/welcome exercises can also support us in resisting ‘othering’ practices by beginning with centering our own lived experience. This is not a ‘complete’ exercise in the sense that it covers all possibilities or promises to arrive at a certain place, instead it is an invitation into experiencing a couple of questions and seeing what movement begins to emerge and how you might question, adapt or re-word according to your specific location of experience.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Our Bodies as Multi-storied Communities: Ethics and Practices and watch the short video Co-researching agreement.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Poh!\n\nMehmet Dinç is a narrative therapist living in Türkiye. He is an Associate Professor and Head of the Psychology Department at Hasan Kalyoncu University. He works on psychological resilience, with a focus on conducting extensive research, and has authored several books on the subject.\n\nMuhammed Furkan is a Turkish narrative therapist who works with adolescents and adults. He graduated from Istanbul Sehir University Faculty of Islamic Studies and the Psychology Department with a double major degree. He has a Master’s Degree in Narrative Therapy and Community Work from The University of Melbourne. He is currently working as a research assistant at Istanbul Zaim University. He is particularly interested in learning from people who are resisting the effects of trauma.\n\nCanahmet Boz works as a research assistant in the Psychology Department of Hasan Kalyoncu University and as a clinical psychologist/ narrative therapist in Türkiye. He conducts narrative therapy–based studies and practices on chronic diseases.\n\nTrauma represents a profound and emotionally intense experience within the human condition. Beyond its evident impacts on both the physiological and psychological dimensions of an individual, this complex phenomenon encapsulates moments of resistance and strength in the face of adversity. From a narrative standpoint, individuals invariably manifest unique responses to trauma, which necessitate a close and nuanced examination for recognition and comprehension. Muhammed’s paper proposes a framework for the systematic collection and organisation of diverse responses to trauma through a checklist of innovative moments of social and psychological resistance, contributing to a greater comprehension of this intricate phenomenon.\n\nMehmet and Canahmet’s article discusses the response of a university psychology department to the devastating earthquakes that struck Türkiye on 6 February 2023, resulting in significant loss of life and widespread destruction. Their paper focuses on the narrative practices undertaken by the department in the affected region, particularly the establishment of a psychological support telephone line staffed by volunteer psychologists. Beyond the initial establishment of the support line, the university extended its outreach to address the immediate needs of affected individuals in five cities, and subsequently, within the university premises. A “Tent of Hope” was established within a “container city” of displaced families to continue psychosocial support. This involved the volunteer efforts of psychology students to offer assistance to both children and adults. Initiatives also included the dissemination of a culturally sensitive booklet for the public and the development of a comprehensive booklet for therapists, aiming to empower individuals and communities in the aftermath of trauma. This paper includes reflections from people who contributed to these initiatives, sharing learning and insights relevant to others responding to natural disasters.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read:\n\nStanding upright against trauma and hardship: Checklists of innovative moments of social and psychological resistance by Muhammed Furkan Cinisli, and\n\nPsychosocial support initiatives in the aftermath of the 2023 earthquake: A university-led community approach by Mehmet Dinç and Canahmet Boz\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Mehmet, Muhammed and Canahmet!\n\nTiffany Sostar (they/them) is a bisexual, nonbinary, neurodivergent, disabled narrative practitioner and community worker. They usually live as a white settler on Blackfoot land in Treaty 7 territory in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but are living on Kaurna land right now. This work is undertaken in collaboration with Elliot Trimble (he/him) and with Nathan Viktor Fawaz (they/he/she).\n\nThis audio practice note and the collective document it describes are part of “narrative projects in support of trans lives”, a collection of work being undertaken by Tiffany Sostar, Elliot Trimble, and Nathan Viktor Fawaz. This practice note and collective document are the first to be published in this collection of work. Not to fix anything, but just to offer a millimetre of relief or breath or humour or companionship: A collective document about caring for trans community brings together many stories of care within and with trans community. Our hope is that this document will help connect readers to a sense of community and collective action, and will invite readers, regardless of gender identity, to join us in taking actions of care within a social context that is increasingly hostile to trans lives. These stories, reflection questions, and invitations describe and welcome a wide range of care, including small, personal, and beautifully imperfect actions taken by and alongside trans community.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by David Denborough. Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please listen to Caring for trans community, an audio practice note from Tiffany Sostar. The collective document described in the audio can be downloaded here: A collective document about caring for trans community\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Tiffany!\n\nKaur Serendipity is a mother, marathon runner, teacher, social justice activist, narrative therapist and chaplain of Eastern European and Middle Eastern cultural backgrounds. She writes under other pseudonyms , on issues of the stigma of sex working, feminism and the devastating effects of locating problems inside people. She works in communities where people experience marginalisation, and is committed to her journey and message of bringing dignity , safety and solidarity in relationships.\n\nJulia Sharp lives and works on the beautiful unceded land of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. Julia is from settler coloniser heritage and completed her Masters in Narrative Therapy in late 2022. Her work is strongly shaped by the feminist movement, and values of activism, solidarity and justice-doing. When Julia was involved in this piece of work, she was working in a sexual health clinic as a Social Worker and during her Masters she started becoming curious about ways to de-centre herself in conversations with people and ways to create space for those with lived experiences as the experts in their lives. In all Julia’s work she is interested in exploring alternate knowledges, peoples’ acts of resistance and responses to violence and abuse that often go unnoticed or are undervalued. Julia currently works for a Royal Commission for the Federal Government and as a counsellor for a Sexual Assault Service.\n\nKaur’s paper explores the use of narrative therapy and community work to respond to the complexities surrounding women’s experiences in the sex industry. It offers practices for therapists and community workers seeking to engage with sex workers in ways that are respectful of their hard-won knowledge and seek to elicit double-storied accounts in relation to hardship, thicken stories of preferred identities, and explore absent-but-implicit values, hopes and commitments. These practices include an innovative use of re-membering questions and a collective Tree of Life process adapted to the specific experiences of women in the sex industry. The paper elevates the insider knowledge of sex workers, particularly the lived experience of women engaged in sex work in which they have a high degree of choice and autonomy. It includes a collective document of sex workers’ insider knowledge about confronting stigma and isolation, addressed to people whose work intertwines with sex workers in some way: therapists, support workers, lawyers, police, activists.\n\nWestern culture and Western health care systems have created places of sexual health care that are highly individualised, privatised and professionalised. For people engaged in sex work, this reduces the possibilities for sharing skills and knowledges and instead leaves people with internalised feelings of shame, guilt and isolation. Julia’s paper describes collective therapeutic work that elicited insider knowledges, skills and sparkling moments from sex workers. These accounts sidestepped negative identity conclusions and fostered mutual support among the workers, even though the participants never met each other. The work was guided by narrative practice concepts including externalising, double listening, re-authoring, privileging insider knowledges and developing collective documents.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read:\n\nDeparting from stigma and secrecy and elevating storis of agency: Narrative practice in the voices of sex workers by Kaur Serendipity, and\n\nSafety and solidarity: using collective documents to share sex workers’ insider knowledges by Julia Sharp\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Kaur and Julia!\n\nKJ Wiseheart is a multiply neurodivergent counsellor and narrative practitioner. They are committed to co-creating neurocosmopolitan conversations and communities where all neurocognitive differences in experience, communication and embodiment are appreciated and affirmed. KJ is also enthusiastically exploring therapeutic applications of tabletop role playing games. KJ is a graduate of the Master of Narrative Therapy and Community Work program at The University of Melbourne.\n\nIn this video, KJ introduces the accompanying collective document “How we deal with Autistic burnout: A living document created by Autistic adults for Autistic adults”. This document was created through a series of interviews with lived experience experts who generously shared their skills and hard-won knowledges. KJ describes the process of creating this document, and how they endeavoured to adapt and localise existing practices of collective documentation, for accessibility and cultural resonance with Autistic community values and ways of being.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tiffany Sostar. Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch How we deal with Autistic burnout\n\nAnd then bring your questions for KJ!\n\nBelieve it or not, 30 April 2024 marks 40 years of Jane Hales working at Dulwich Centre! 40 years! So this meet the author is a very special occasion. It’s a celebration and a chance to share stories from behind the scenes of 40 years of narrative therapy and community work.\n\n40 years! Can you believe it?\n\nTo prepare for this meeting/celebration please read this conversation with Jane Hales, ‘Laughter and issues of class’, that appears in A Memory Book for the Field of Narrative Practice. And then bring your questions and stories.\n\nHugo Kamya is a Professor and the Associate Director of the Center for Innovation in Clinical Social Work at Simmons University, where he teaches clinical practice and trauma, family therapy, spirituality, group work and narrative therapies. He combines an interest in social work, psychology, and theology. His work has focused on immigrant and refugee populations as well as international efforts to assess the social service needs of people affected by HIV/AIDS and transactional sex. He practices, consults for, and develops collaborative partnerships with, agencies and organizations, as well as presents nationally and internationally on multicultural, diversity, racial justice, and cultural sensitivity issues. He collaborates in Caring Across Communities, a project of community-based services for refugees and immigrants that examines social, cultural, and human capital toward family functioning and well-being. He is the American Family Therapy Academy recipient for the 2003 Distinguished Contribution to Social and Economic Justice Award. In 2014, Dr. Kamya was accepted into the Fulbright Specialist Roster Program. Dr. Kamya is founding member of the Boston Institute for Culturally Affirming Practices (BICAP).\n\nThis video of Hugo’s presentation from the International Narrative Therapy and Community Work conference in Kigali, Rwanda in 2022, builds from his own cultural background and engages the audience to develop a conscious practice of spirituality. Hugo’s personal journey as Ugandan and as an African guides his reflections on how he engages spirituality in family therapy conversations. These conversations are anchored in African traditions, and they value prayer, metaphors and rites of passage through which they find their own sense of purpose and meaning. Attending to issues of history, context and social location, Hugo discuss ways in which he places himself as a spiritual being in his work with immigrants and refugees\n\n“People are full of stories. I still find myself at a crossroad of many stories. These stories shape who I am and where I belong. My story has been woven together by the threads of others. Stories of home. Stories of identity. Stories of belonging and longing, stories of connecting and encountering. Stories strung together across person, place, and time. They reveal passion and perseverance, surviving and thriving, fear, pain, hope, courage, and a will to live.”\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Harnessing spirituality within traditional healing systems\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Hugo!\n\nBen Shannahan is a family therapist who lives on Whajuk country in Perth, Western Australia. He has many years of experience working primarily in social work and child and adolescent mental health in London, UK, and in Perth. He is an associate of The Institute of Narrative Therapy (UK) and part of the teaching faculty of PartnershipProjectsUK and Dulwich Centre. In recent years, Ben has worked with families in diverse contexts, including with CYPRESS (Children & Young People’s Responsive Suicide Support). CYPRESS is a postvention counselling service provided by Anglicare WA, working with children, young people and their families bereaved by suicide. He also works in independent practice as a family therapist and supervisor.\n\nBen began meeting with Beth and her family soon after Beth’s older sister Amberly ended her own life. Their conversations lead to Beth writing a song in honour of Amberly. Here, Beth and Ben share the song along with the story of how it was written and eventually performed to family members and friends.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Zan Maeder. Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read and watch “It’s a sausage, not a scone”: A recipe for getting through hard times in response to the suicide of a loved one\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Ben!\n\nMarnie Sather works as a narrative therapist in Melbourne/Naarm, Australia. She has a long-standing passion for making room in therapeutic and community work for complex understandings of suicide, including with those bereaved by suicide. Her current research interest is women’s and children’s experiences of bereavement as a result of suicide.\n\nDavid Newman lives and works on the lands of the Gadigal people, also known as Sydney, Australia. He is a faculty member of Dulwich Centre and an honorary clinical fellow at The University of Melbourne’s Department of Social Work. Through his independent therapy practice, Sydney Narrative Therapy, he meets with individuals, couples and families. He delights in this work and narrative practices have offered invigorating company.\n\nIn Marnie’s presentation, made at the launch of the Narrative Practice Research Network, she introduces some of the possibilities and complexities of feminist insider research. Drawing on her experience of completing doctoral research with women who had lost a male partner to suicide, Marnie sets out some of the options for positioning the researcher in insider research – from not disclosing insider status to placing it as the centre – and describes how she came to a position of careful utilisation of her own experience in the research process and in the writing of her thesis.\n\nIn David’s paper, he explores Clifford Geertz’s distinction between experience-near and experience-distant language. In the process, he draws from mad studies and mental health service user epistemology, both written and generated through my work. David also draws on the work of the historian of emotion Tiffany Watt Smith. Three specific practices in relation to language use are proposed: how we can invigorate the agency or meaning-making in language use; how we can use language to assist people to become familiar with, not alienated from, their experience; and how we might name and question the values or obligations that get smuggled in with emotion talk. He also provides three exercises to explore these themes.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Zan Maeder.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please\n\nWATCH: Feminist insider research by Marnie Sather\n\nREAD: The effort and intricacies of generating experience-near language by David Newman\n\nENGAGE: Holding our Heads Up: Sharing stories not stigma after losing a loved one to suicide [an older resource that Marnie and David worked on together].\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Marnie and David!\n\nCarmen graduated from the Master of Narrative Therapy and Community Work in 2017 with theatre, music, writing and transpersonal art therapy as important foundations for her therapeutic approach. A therapist, supervisor, speaker and trainer based in (but not from) Vancouver (Canada, Coast Salish Territories), her independent practice Square Peg Therapy is a community centred endeavour that provides low barrier support prioritizing Artists, Queer & Gender diverse clients, in addition to ongoing practice based research employing a collaborative Narrative framework and harm reduction principles in support of substance users exploring Substance Assisted Therapies (aka psychedelic medicine).\n\nThis session provides a peek into some ways narrative practices might inform what you do and inspire some ways of doing them.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).

His family roots are Irish, which brings with it a rich appreciation of stories, music and community. He is interested in ways anti-oppressive practices and social justice can be foregrounded in professional healthcare contexts. James’s solidarity team includes: the narrative practitioners who have inspired him, including colleagues past and present; his family of origin, chosen family and wider LGBTQIA+ community; and the young people involved with the Rainbow Project.\n\nJaymie is a clinical psychologist working with young people with chronic health conditions at University College London Hospital. He also works at a service called TransPlus at 56 Dean Street with trans and gender-expansive people. Before qualifying as a psychologist, Jaymie’s work was in amplifying the voices of people using mental health services, supporting them to influence and shape services. Since qualifying, he has continued to be passionate about centring the voices of people in their own health care and empowering them to influence change. Important commitments to Jaymie are being creative and connecting with stories of hope, joy and community.\n\nThis article describes the use of narrative practices for LGBTQIA+ young people with a health condition. It presents a collective narrative practice: the Rainbow of Life. This adapts the Tree of Life metaphor to invite rich story development opportunities when working with LGBTQIA+ people. It involves exploring their commitments, special moments and those who stand alongside them in solidarity, and creatively mapping these on to a rainbow image. The authors outline Rainbow of Life events they have organised, including collective practices in which young people shared their wisdom for responding to oppressive storm clouds that darken the sky and dim their rainbow’s shine, as well as witnessing and honouring each other’s rainbows.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read The Rainbow of Life: A collective narrative practice with young LGBTQIA+ people with a health condition\n\nAnd then bring your questions for James and Jaymie!\n\nDr. Makungu M.

She is a clinical psychologist and a family therapist. Mariangels completed the inaugural Master of Narrative Therapy and Community Work in 2015. Mariangels works independently and is involved in many projects. She is a Joint Director of Riverbank Psychology and Atelier Narratiu. She has designed creative tools for therapy and is supporting the delivery of Team of Life across the UK, and is a faculty member of the UK Institute of Narrative Therapy. She greatly enjoys teaching narrative principles in Spanish and English. Mariangels’ primary interests are closely associated with Narrative Therapy Supervision within the context of Genetic Counselling. As part of the Whitworth Group, she has been involved in research to investigate narrative interventions in the field of genetics and co-hosting podcast conversations for the European Society of Human Genetics. Creative work, supervisory and therapeutic fields intersect for Mariangels.\n\nRhona is a Scottish woman who trained as a nurse in Glasgow before working at the Psychological Medicine Group at the Christie hospital in Manchester. She now works as a Consultant Genetic Counsellor at Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, with a special interest in genetic counselling for neurogenic conditions. Rhona’s connection to narrative practices is through Mariangels. She feels very fortunate to have been a member of the narrative supervision group facilitated by Mariangels since 2012. Together with Mariangels she is interested in how narrative practices may be useful to genetic counsellors in their day-to-day practice, particularly in the context of loss through illness or bereavement. Rhona is a member of the Whitworth group and is pathway lead for a 3-year MSc program in genomic counselling at University of Manchester.\n\nTo what extent are family systems approaches relevant in the genomics era? What difference does it make to remember the wider social context within which ‘problems’ associated with a genetic diagnosis reside? How does this influence the conversations we have with our patients? This paper considers these questions in relation to systemic approaches to genetic counseling practice. Increased uptake of genomic testing and the number of people seeking genetic counseling present opportunities to consider new ways of working, particularly around support following a new genetic diagnosis. Narrative therapy with an emphasis on people’s strengths, wishes, and ways of resisting the effects of a problem may be a particularly useful framework for genetic counselors. Family therapy and narrative practices have the potential to encourage communication and for families to learn from each other.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Steph Badman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read A family systems approach to genetic counselling: Development of narrative interventions\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Mariangels and Rhona!\n\nLarry Zucker is a Narrative Therapist in Los Angeles, California.

She works independently with a diverse population of adolescents and youth. Jonaki is passionate about gender justice and questions social norms in her practice. Outside of her professional endeavours, Jonaki enjoys reading children’s books, traveling, and daydreaming.\n\nMore often than not Jonaki meets young people who routinely compare and measure themselves with normative standards that lead them to a sense of ‘I am not good enough’ or a sense of personal failure. This video helps to understand the phenomenon of personal failure and its relationship with modern power. Jonaki has explored the usefulness of failure conversations map in subverting modern power, questioning ideas of inadequacy, and in generating preferred identity conclusions.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Joseph Kalisa and Zan Maeder will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch The ‘Not Good Enough feeling’ – Exploring the use of failure conversations map to address ideas of inadequacy in young people\n\nAnd bring your questions for Jonaki!\n\nKelsi (she/her) is a Canadian cisgender woman currently living in Adelaide/Tarntanya on Kaurna Land, in South Australia. She is feminist narrative practitioner and researcher who has a particular interest in supporting people with experiences of sexual abuse, interpersonal violence and associated trauma. Kelsi recently completed a PhD through the University of Melbourne (and Dulwich Centre) on the video archive of Michael White and his therapeutic practice in the realms of abuse and trauma. In this research project she was particularly interested in how she might investigate not only the archive (the past) but also explore the ways in which feminist-informed archival research could possibly influence contemporary narrative practice (the present). Specifically, Kelsi endeavoured to resist viewing White’s archive as a static thing to solidify the present (or current narrative practice), but as a way of continuously engaging with history in ways that might expand or complicate contemporary practice. Currently, Kelsi works as a psychologist at BlueSky Psychology in Adelaide, where she is enjoying being reconnected with therapeutic practice and the people who consult her.\n\nThe resource for this Meet the Author session, is a chapter from Kelsi’s PhD thesis on Michael White’s video archive, entitled: ‘Narrative practice at times when the therapist is more centred’. Specifically, this chapter was written with the aim of articulating what she learned from those moments in Michael White’s therapeutic conversations (as viewed in his video archive) when he appeared to be stepping into a relatively more centred and influential stance – in relation to the narrative therapeutic stance of being ‘decentred and yet influential’. In viewing many of White’s therapeutic encounters recorded in the video archive, it was Kelsi’s sense that the vast majority of White’s work took place on the ‘less imposing’ (decentred) but influential side of the continuum. However, she also noticed that there seemed to be instances when he travelled towards the ‘more imposing’ (centred) end of the continuum and/or he seemed to be doing something that didn’t seem to quite fit with what she previously knew about the decentred but influential position. These noticings left Kelsi pondering over questions such as:\n\nWhat might have been influencing White at these times?\n\nWhat might he have been thinking?\n\nWhat might he have been resisting or attending to?\n\nWhat can we learn for our own practice from these moments?\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Jill Freedman and Clare Kempton will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Narrative practice at times when the therapist is more centred.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Kelsi!\n\nJoseph is a licensed clinical psychologist and narrative therapy practitioner. He is interested in the intergenerational transmission of resilience, survival skills and resistance after genocide as well as collective approaches to mental health. He works at Dulwich Centre Foundation and Geruka Healing Centre and the University of Rwanda as well as being a clinical tutor at the University of Melbourne. Joseph has co-edited with other Rwanda Narrative Practitioners a book called “Land of a thousand stories: Rwandan Narrative Therapy and Community Work”.\n\nAfter the country was shattered by genocide against the Tutsi, they were many orphans, widows, children born of rape, fear, ongoing struggle, physical and emotional wounds, fractured communities, and families, and more than 120,000 people in perpetrators of the genocide, international organizations, and practitioners from around the world flocked to Rwanda, armed with models and practices that had proven successful in other contexts.\n\nBut Rwandans had different ways of doing things rooted in their own culture and traditions. They had tried Western models and found them not to fit not only in healing but also in social justice. Local ways of responding to these issues were very much needed. A team from Dulwich Centre together with Jill Freedman and Gene Combs started coming to Rwanda in 2007, when they came, they came to learn. The Ibuka counsellors spoke intensely and expressively of grief and pain and this would intersperse that talk with laughter, singing, jokes and dancing. These were really different ways than the conventional way of speaking about hardships and trauma. In a conversation with Jill Freedman and Gene Combs, Joseph speaks about growing up in this community of practitioners and himself. He speaks about witnessing this way of practice and how he’s been able to get inspiration as a young practitioner to support the people he meets in practice. He speaks what it means for his generation of practitioners.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Annonciathe Niyibizi and Clare Kempton will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Re-imagining Practice: Drawing Inspiration from Community Practitioners’ Responses to Adversity in Rwanda: An interview with Joseph Kalisa by Jill Freedman and Gene Combs\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Joesph!\n\nEmily is a transmisogyny-exempt narrative practitioner of settler-colonial ancestry and 2021 graduate of the Masters in Narrative Therapy and Community Work program. She holds multiple, often-invisible neurodivergences and disabilities and works remotely in private practice alongside fellow 2SLGBTQIA+ people located across a few continents. She lives and works on the unceded traditional and ancestral lands of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc and Nłeʔkepmx Tmíxʷ (Nlaka’pamux) peoples (colonially known as ‘kamloops, bc, canada’) and pays respects to elders past and present.\n\nLandscapes of Possibility holds an invitation to consider the impossible when in conversation with the people we walk alongside: what might happen if the limits of our material plane were not present? What might happen if you didn’t have to worry about whether you could pay this month’s rent, whether your mom would be mad if you changed your name, whether you could walk down the street and not be harassed? When we look outside the constraints of our material world, rich maps of possibility become, well, possible. This article and reflection builds on Michael White’s landscapes of action and meaning as well as re-membering practices, inviting the realms of fiction and magic as spaces for building stories that contradict deficit-focused conclusions people might hold about their lives.\n\n“A practice that has sustained me during the innovation of this project/work is walking the dog twice a day with my spouse, in the mornings and evenings, talking about anything and everything that flitted across my mind and chewing on questions until I had a solid idea of where I stood on them at the moment. Literary analysis has been a long love affair, and being able to puzzle out the ‘what was said, what wasn’t said, what was the personal and global context, and what multiplicity of conclusions can we draw from that’ of stories and ideas with someone has been a gift.”\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Zan Maeder. Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read:\n\nLandscapes of possibility: An introduction to fantasy in 2SLGBTQIA+ and disabled therapeutic contexts, followed by\n\nRe-membering with Fictional Characters – Revisiting Landscapes of Possibility.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Emily!\n\nRachael (she/her) is a Munanjali woman on her father’s side, and has Greek and English migrant connections on her mother’s side. Rachael runs a private practice as a counsellor and supervisor in Meeanjin (Brisbane). She is a current PhD candidate and has completed the Masters of Narrative Therapy and Community Work. Rachael has worked in community social and emotional wellbeing spaces, specifically with First Nations people, women and children escaping domestic violence and youth for the past 13 years. Rachael has co-facilitated the Teaching Narrative Practice to First Nations people and other workshops. Rachael’s PhD research is focusing on First Nations knowledges and ways of doing ‘supervision’ complimented by narrative practices.\n\nSomething that Rachael loves about the Narrative community is the meaningfully light-hearted accessibility to ‘therapeutic’ practices as a way of community living, as opposed to this strictly privatised, serious expert centric way of therapy for problemed people. As a consumer of podcasts, Rachael has thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from the availability and diversity of content and creators. Podcasting has made known the voices and ideas of people that not so long ago would not have been able to be present on such large platforms in mainstream media. The idea to merge both her own and a large societal love for podcasts with narrative informed yarns seemed too good to dismiss. The Bunjie Series was inspired by a number of people and works including storytelling and interview based podcasts, No Filter with Mia Freedman being one of those. Ian Maund’s work with the Soundtrack of Your Life, highlighting peoples intersectionality’s of identity, experiences and knowledge through yarns of folk psychology. David Denborough’s collective community works (all various examples) were big in helping her think about ways of showcasing collective values and contributions. Of course all the deadly yarns she has had with fellow First Nation practitioners along the way. Lastly, Rachael’s very different and treasured bunjie’s inspired her to showcase the power and significance for honouring bunjieships.\n\n“What has sustained me through this is a sense of desire to complete something that I have thoroughly enjoyed co-creating with Bunjies that are also excited about it. We collectively want these yarns shared and so this is what keeps me going in trying to squeeze in time here and there to edit and be sure that I don’t rush the quality of what is shared.”\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).

They are currently living and working on the unceded lands of the T’Kemlúps te Secwépemc and the Nlaka’pamux peoples. They have called these lands home after being displaced from their homeland (Kosovo) in 1999 due to genocide.\n\nEvren is also a nerd who loves young adult fantasy fiction (all books Tortall), animated shows (i.e., She-Ra; the Owl House) and movies, and ‘spoiling’ stories for themselves by watching or listening to literary analyses on YouTube. They have a growing collection of colourful pens, markers, and fountain pens, and is looking forward to The Good Place when they can learn and do all the things they want.\n\nA conversation with Zan Maeder about a practice of adapting whiteboard work to digital spaces for and within a queer, trans, neurodivergent, and remote-only context. Evren talks about the role of mapping in conversations; mapping, safety and power relations; effects of mapping for their conversation partners; how mapping shapes their questions; using illustration; and accessibility considerations.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Clare Kempton.

Through Arrernte kinship Kynan is an Ampetyane making him a Kwertengurle for Anapipe where he is continually learning in his traditional role as a caretaker for his Country. Kynan is a youth mentor with a Bachelor of Education (Primary) and a Master of Narrative Therapy and Community Work. He works with Clontarf Foundation at the Centralian Middle Academy and supports young Aboriginal boys and men to learn and grow across areas of sport, leadership, education, wellbeing and employment. Kynan is also the Chairperson of the Apmwerre Aboriginal Corporation working with the Board and his family on community development initiatives to care for Country as they strive to meet the community’s hopes and dreams for Apmwerre homelands. Kynan loves playing and listening to music, spending time on Country, playing footy and pottering around the house with his partner, dogs and his chickens aka the ‘Arrernte chicks.’\n\nThe Fire of Life methodology was inspired by the Ncazelo Ncube and David Denborough’s Tree of Life taking into account Aboriginal narrative practices including Tileah Drahm-Butler’s ‘yarning with purpose’ and Aunty Barbara Wingard’s approach in ‘telling our stories in ways that make us stronger.’ The practice was developed in opposition to deficit discourse surrounding Aboriginal young people, particularly in the education system, which I was involved in as an Aboriginal education worker at the time. However, this deficit discourse of Aboriginal people extends beyond the education system and into our society where narratives of disadvantage have been woven into the ‘stories’ of First Nations people. The Fire of Life hopes to explore and strengthen people’s ‘fires’ as they navigate their lives, hopefully by yarning around a fire with a cup of tea.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Joseph Kalisa will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Fire of Life: Exploring stories of passions, strengths, interests, skills and hobbies of our mob\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Kynan!\n\nSara Warkentin, MMFT, is a therapist working with newly arrived refugee individuals and families at Aurora Family Therapy Centre, and maintains a small independent practice, in Winnipeg, Canada.\n\nDunja Kovačević, MMFT, is a facilitator, writer, and therapist currently working in independent practice.\n\nKristin Millar, RSW, is entering her 4th year in the Masters of Marriage and Family Therapy program at the University of Winnipeg. Previously, she obtained a BSW degree from the University of Manitoba and a BA from the University of Winnipeg. She has worked in non-profits, healthcare, education, the arts and as a professional public speaker. She is passionate about the intersection of therapy, social justice, medicine and the arts.\n\nAs therapists working with newcomer communities, the practical needs of settlement often overshadow or blur with the needs of mental health for those accessing our services. The separation of mental health as a category in Canadian systems often does not reflect the more holistic vision of “a good life” more relevant to the non-Western cultures we collaborate with. In early 2023, we facilitated a therapeutic group composed of Afghan and Iranian women and youth who arrived in Winnipeg as refugees recently. Based on the Kite of Life collective narrative methodology developed at the St James Town newcomer housing in Toronto, we set out to explore intergenerational conflict in these families. What we found was disquiet in ourselves as therapists, as the work, led by the participants, deviated from this framework and focus into areas of practical resourcing, identity exploration, political outrage, and grief processing. Releasing ourselves from the fidelity to the original plan, what emerged was a space in which to create and play in the tension of dualisms. For the participants, this looked like exploring and integrating contrasted and coexisting realities like disappointment in/gratitude to Canada, longing for/feeling unsafe back home, and belonging with/rejection from family and culture. As emerging therapists, we leaned into our own felt tension between “doing Therapy” clinically in the way we had been taught, and supporting meaningful and healing experiences for participants. In this presentation we explore what constitutes a therapeutic experience, and what can be generated when we let go of the planned or proper way to do therapy.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Jill Freedman and Clare Kempton Sladden will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read the collective document here (or listen to an audio recording here) and watch Flying Kites and Changing Plans: Exploring & Editing the Kite of Life with newcomer families in Winnipeg\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Sara, Dunja and Kristin!\n\nWe are a Spider’s Web: the friendship in times of crisis storytelling project\n\nFrankie Hanman-Siegersma (they/them) is a descendent of Dutch, British and Irish immigrants, living on Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung country in narrm (Melbourne, Australia). Frankie is a queer peer worker and narrative therapy practitioner. They work within community-led LGBTIQ+ suicide justice space, and with folks whose lives have been shaped by the effects of ‘mental illness’. Frankie is interested in the movement of neoliberal, individualistic therapy towards activism, and collective liberation. They enjoy facilitating opportunities for ritual, poetry, music, cultural practice and pop culture in their work alongside community members.\n\nWe are a Spider’s Web: the friendship in time of crisis storytelling project aims to make visible the skills, knowledges, values, beliefs and histories that inspire community and friendship-based responses to ‘mental health crisis’. This video shares stories from the project, from people who helped their trans kin to access psychiatric support during a difficult time in their life, to the sustaining magic of queer covens, to home cooked meals, Uber eats ice-cream deliveries and chosen whanau. Our hope is that these stories travel to other networks of friends and communities who have their own practices of solidarity and peer support, and as such, that there is a building upon non-medicalised, and non-carceral approaches to responding to ‘mental health crisis’. We also hope this project is a useful resource for those working within the formalised mental health system here in Australia, and internationally, and that it might provide ideas and opportunities to uplift the insider knowledge of friendships and communities, in local contexts.\n\n“I really appreciated being able to acknowledge domains of sparkling achievement outside of the norm. For example, taking friendship as a site of resistance, and political change. This helped me sustain curiosity and commitment in regards to peoples stories about how friendship had helped them during a time of crisis.”\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Zan Maeder. Joseph Kalisa will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch We are a Spider’s Web: the friendship in times of crisis storytelling project\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Frankie!\n\nFrankie has chosen to share the song ‘I Can See Clearly Now’ by Johnny Nash. They share it in the spirit of connection that it was shared with them by one of the participants of the project. This person spoke about what it was like being one of the first peer workers with lived experience of psychiatric admission and mental illness, to be working on the wards, running a music group. He told me about where it all began…\n\nI had lots of psychiatric admissions, and every time I had an admission, I would ask my friends, “Please bring me a guitar”. I would sit there in the backyard with a guitar and people gathered around me. One day, I asked, “Why can’t we bring in some music groups, from a lived experience perspective?” So I became a peer worker.\n\nI had to go through this vetting process. As a worker it was extremely difficult. I remember my friend and I arrived together on our first day. We waited at the door for a nurse to let us in. Everyone was coming through with their swipe cards. I said to my friend, “Look, I can see a lot of people like us working on inpatient units”. He laughed at me, “This is never gonna happen, look at how they treat us, no swipe card, no nothing”.\n\nEventually there were a few of us on the ward, helping people out. I continued with my music. We had a group called ‘The Consumer Cover Band’. We used to play ‘I Can See Clearly Now’ by Johnny Nash. Because, you know, there’s times where we don’t see things as they really are. We can have dark, dark times.\n\nThere’s an image that will never ever leave me. There was a guy on the ward and had an excellent voice. One day, he said, “Brother, can I sing this song for you?” I said, ”Of course, let’s do it”.\n\nHe was always isolated, but whenever he saw the guitar, he came out to join us. It was pouring rain. I could see the rain hitting the glass windows as we were playing in the lounge. People in the entrance door to the psych unit, the nurses and the families coming in and out, everybody stopped to listen to him, they were so amazed. The rain stopped. It’s like his voice cleared away the rain. His voice cleared away the pain. The next day, I came into work, and asked about him, and he had passed away overnight. I will never forget him.\n\nAs we listen to this song, we can hold in our hearts those who continue to be impacted by coercive and punitive mechanisms of the mental health system. And we can be inspired to think of transformative responses that exist outside of these domains.\n\nCarla Galaz Souza is a feminist lesbian and narrative therapist from Abya Yala (South America) currently living in Galinyala / Port Lincoln, South Australia. Carla has worked as a therapist with women and children who have experienced violence and sexual abuse in central and southern Chile, as an undergraduate teacher, and in projects aimed at psychosocial, educational, and healthcare teams. As a feminist activist, she participated in the Feminist Autonomous Movement of Abya Yala and in collective projects. She is interested in bringing feminist ideas to therapy and in translating narrative practices to the Latin American context through culturally appropriate methods.\n\nIn this project, Carla explored using narrative ideas to engage with therapeutic meaning-making of dreams as a pathway to support the development of alternative stories in culturally appropriate ways with women and children from Chile. In the video, Carla shares three stories of practice to show how dreams were introduced in the conversation and, in the article, one story of practice is shared in a thorough way. In her therapeutic practice, dreams came to provide a way of connecting with complex ideas and experiences around fear, meaning and identity. The process of meaning-making of dreams also offered potent spaces of cultural connection, personal reflection, and strength beyond being internalised sensory experiences. Similarly, by drawing links between dreams and waking life, Carla’s narrative conversations focused on how dreams offer a way for recognising skills and knowledges that people already have for dealing with their predicaments.\n\n“The idea of bringing dreams into the conversation came as an invitation from Nina, one of the Chilean women I worked with online. In an exchange of emails to arrange our next session, Nina wrote that she had been having many dreams and nightmares, and she attached narrations of five of these dreams. Being aware of psychology’s influence and its traditions of interpreting and constructing meanings from dreams, I wondered how to embrace Nina’s desire to talk about dreams.”\n\nThis event will be facilitated by David Denborough.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Inviting Dreams to the Conversation or read Dreamtelling: Making meaning from dreams using narrative practices.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Carla!\n\nAt the time of writing this paper, Clare resided on the unceded lands of the Djab Wurrung and Jardwadjali peoples. She has worked across schools in both a rural and metropolitan context, and seeks to hear students’ expertise in matters relating to their own lives. Clare has a specific interest in finding micro-opportunities to unsettle practices of power within a duty-of-care context.\n\nClare’s article explores the use of narrative practices in a school-based setting to approach safety planning with young people. They/she proposes an alternative safety planning tool: The River of Life safety map, which draws on the migration of identity metaphor. Clare explores opportunities for collaboration in safety planning and risk management, drawing on feminist ethics. A story of practice gives suggestions for how one may use the map.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Zan Maeder and Joseph Kalisa will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read The River of Life safety map: Narrative journeys in a school-based setting\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Clare!\n\nThe Rev. Cody J. Sanders is Associate Professor of Congregational and Community Care Leadership at Luther Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. Prior to this, he was the pastor to Old Cambridge Baptist Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he also serves as American Baptist Chaplain to Harvard University and Advisor for LGBTQ+ Affairs in the Office of Religious, Spiritual, and Ethical Life at MIT. He is a pastoral theologian with teaching and research interests in the areas of LGBTQIA pastoral care and counselling, death and dying, corpse care and natural burial, narrative therapeutic theory, and practical theological approaches to care in the Anthropocene. His latest book is Corpse Care: Ethics for Tending the Dead (Fortress Press, 2023).\n\nIn this paper, Cody addresses the problem of human supremacy in the methods of practical theology. He puts forth a practical theological method for experimentation shaped around five interpenetrating dimensions: Ecological, Anthropological, Relational, Technological, and Health/Harm/Healing (the EARTH method). Cody’s anticipated outcome of this method is the construction of practical theological projects that aim toward practices of care that continue to address concerns of the human, but always and only as the human is understood to be inextricably situated in an expansive cosmic web of entanglement.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Tiffany Sostar will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Decentering the Human in Practical Theologies of Care: An EARTH Method. This article is available until September 27, 2023 – with thanks for permission from De Gruyter.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Cody!\n\nLaunch event for new version of the International Journal of Narrative Therapy and Community Work\n\nThere are exciting changes afoot for the International Journal of Narrative Therapy and Community Work. Please join us to launch the first issue of a new look journal!\n\nThis issue (and all future issues) will include not only the rigorous and practical peer-reviewed papers that we have always delighted in publishing, but also original audio and video content, interviews making connections with innovative thinkers, and a special focus on contributions from young and emerging practitioners. The journal’s new look will also enable more interaction, with invitations for readers to respond to and discuss papers.\n\nThe journal will be published on an Open Access basis, so our new papers and multimedia contributions will be freely available to read and share with no paywalls.\n\nThe other significant news is that after 20 years at the helm of International Journal of Narrative Therapy and Community Work – and 40 years editing Dulwich Centre’s journals and newsletters – Cheryl White is handing over the editorship of the journal. We are delighted to announce that the new Editor-in-Chief will be Shelja Sen. Based in New Delhi, India, Shelja is a narrative therapist, author and founder of Children First Institute for Child and Adolescent Mental Health. Cheryl will remain involved as Editorial Consultant.\n\nWe are really excited about all of these developments!\n\nTo celebrate, we are going to use this Meet the Author session to reveal the new issue! As well as to introduce our new Editor-In-Chief and talk with some of the people who have contributed to this first new-look issue.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, you can preview a sample of the contributions in the upcoming issue of the journal:\n\nWATCH: Unravelling trauma, co-creating relief and weaving resilience: Playful collaborations with children, families and networks, by Sabine Vermeire (Video presentation created for Turkish colleagues after the devastating earthquakes)\n\nREAD: Gamification: How game design and narrative therapy can work together (peer-reviewed article), by Luke Kalaf\n\nREVIEW: Addicted to Life: Written and directed by Pola Rapaport (2022), reviewed by David Newman\n\nLISTEN: Planet stories: Using AI-generated science fiction to externalise conflict in relationships, by Andrea Ng (Ng Siu Har) (Audio practice note)\n\nINTERVIEW: Curiosity, power and narrative practice: An interview with Perry Zurn, interviewed by Zan Maeder\n\nThis is just a small sample of the journal issue. Please preview these and bring your questions for the authors!\n\nChelsea is a narrative practitioner and ordained deacon in the Uniting Church of Australia. She lives on Kaurna Country in South Australia and is currently working as a spiritual care coordinator in aged care. Chelsea is committed to climate activism and is curious about how the sharing of resonant stories, connection to place and insider knowledges can encourage wider contribution to the climate movement.\n\nChelsea’s paper considers the confronting existential realities of the climate crisis and ways in which narrative practices can be used to help resist overwhelm and sustain climate activism. Recognising that stories shape our lives and the life of our planetary home, she examines both broad systemic issues and the everyday effects of living in a time of climate crisis. Recognition is given to modern/colonial ways of being and anti-colonial practices. Narrative questions are offered in connection to three themes: place, spiritualities and acts of resistance. Chelsea documents rich stories, insider knowledges and skills of living to invite further exploration of collective practice to respond to the climate crisis in urgent and significant ways.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Resisting the cycle of apocalyptic overwhelm: Exploring place, spiritualities and acts of resistance in the face of climate crisis\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Chelsea!\n\nRyo lives in Tokyo and works as a case officer at the Hague Convention Division, which concerns international parental child abduction. By hotline, she also counsels women who are facing challenges, such as domestic abuse, and bullied children, in English and Japanese. She also has counselled families on general matters and young people with hikikomori syndrome.\n\nRyo’s paper explores how narrative approaches – externalising, unique-outcomes, re-membering and re-authoring conversations – have been used in work at a domestic violence hotline to assist clients in deconstructing dominant stories and getting in touch with their personal agency. Examples are drawn from experiences in Japan and highlight certain aspects of Japanese culture. However, the focus is on the applicability of narrative techniques to counselling in a single telephone conversation.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Zan Maeder. Joseph Kalisa will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Narrative approaches in a domestic violence hotline.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Ryo!\n\nLoretta works in private practice through Narrative Therapy Connections Sydney, offering counselling and supervision. Prior to this, she spent 20+ years working in non-government organisations in communities facing intersecting oppressions. Loretta meets with people responding to a range of issues in their lives including relationship concerns, anxiety and depression, grief, stress and distress. Loretta is particularly passionate about assisting people where expressions of distress have arisen from witnessing or being subjected to violence, in reclaiming their lives from these effects. She enjoys her work very much, especially seeing the liberating effects of conversations deconstructing dominant ideas about ‘mental illness’ labels, gender, family, race and class.\n\nLater this year, Dulwich Centre Publishing will be publishing the book Honouring Resistance and Building Solidarity: Feminism and narrative practice by Loretta Pederson. At the next Meet the Author, you will have the chance to discuss the ideas raised in the chapter Working towards cultural change and against sexual assault on campus. In this chapter, Loretta shares stories of practice that connect local actions and initiatives to social movements, bringing a sense of solidarity and enhancing agency for those who are responding to sexual assault in their local community. Loretta also provides some example questions to deconstruct negative responses from authorities and from family and friends after disclosures of assault and requests for support. Additionally, there is an exploration of what may be absent but implicit in expressions of distress over sexual assault and inadequate support received.\n\nThis session will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Working towards cultural change and against sexual assault on campus from Loretta’s upcoming book. This preview chapter is not for further distribution.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Loretta!\n\nSekneh is a highly respected Senior Registered Psychologist and Narrative therapist with extensive experience in therapy, teaching, consultancy, and supervision. With over 20 years of national and international experience in various settings, including private, public, and academic. She values curiosity, kindness, and a collaborative therapeutic alliance, and is committed to continuous learning and professional growth. Outside of therapy, Sekneh is a community advocate, enjoys reading, and participates in competitive sports.\n\nBernard is an early career academic, currently engaged in a higher degree by research, and has a longstanding excellent teaching track record at the UTS School of Public Health. As a lecturer, Bernard’s main role centres around the design, development, and coordination of a range of subjects within the Bachelor of Health Science program since its initiation in 2016. As a researcher, Bernard is currently exploring the ways in which intersectionality impacts health, with a specific focus on ethnic and sexual community connectedness and health access for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men from Arab backgrounds.\n\nIn this Meet the Author session, come and chat about Sekneh’s paper and Bernard’s videos and podcasts. Together, they offer a groundbreaking insight into the transformative potential of nuanced therapeutic conversations that challenge prevailing western norms regarding sexual identity within queer communities. By deconstructing these societal ‘games of truth,’ this intersectional approach underscores the utmost significance of respecting an array of narratives and embracing creative acts of resistance.\n\nThe concept of “coming / inviting in” has emerged as a conscious effort to disrupt and expand upon the conventional discourse surrounding “coming out” within the LGBTQ+ community. While acknowledging that coming out holds immense significance, it inadvertently subscribes to a binary framework, leaving individuals either out or in “the closet.” This binary perspective can inadvertently uphold heteronormative standards, pressuring people to divulge their sexual orientation or gender identity according to predefined expectations and timelines. Coming/ inviting in fosters an inclusive environment where people can delve into and define their identities on their own terms, rather than adhering to societal pressures or predetermined narratives. This approach champions a sense of safety, fluidity and embraces the intricate nuances as people choose how, when, and to what extent they wish to share their identities with others.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Zan Maeder. Joseph Kalisa will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please:\n\nread Azima ila Hayati – An invitation in to my life: Narrative conversations about sexual identity\n\nwatch or listen to these short episodes of One Foot In\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Sekneh and Bernard!\n\nVikki is an activist and therapist who works from a Decolonising and Justice-doing framework. As a consultant, facilitator, and supervisor she has worked with refugees, survivors of torture — including Indigenous survivors of state violence in Canada — mental health and substance use counsellors, rape crisis counsellors, frontline and housing workers, and qt2sbipoc communities. Her specialties include ‘Trauma’ and Witnessing Resistance to Violence and Oppression and a Supervision of Solidarity.\n\nIn this Meet the Author session, come and chat with Vikki about the politicisation of forgiveness, and possibilities of transformation of accountable community practices that centre the person harmed and resist carceral logics and practices.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Loretta Pederson.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read The F Word: Vikki Reynolds on the Politics of Forgiveness, an interview with Natasha Sanders-Kay.\n\nYou are also invited to view the two part video of the interview that informed Natasha’s article: Vikki Reynolds interviewed by Natasha Sanders-Kay for SubTerrain.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Vikki!\n\nPeter loves Narrative Practice and enjoys photography. Narrative practice allows him to see the world from a different perspective, while photography enables him to capture the beauty that he sees. Through narrative practice and photography, he can connect with the world in a different way, appreciate everything around him, and love this world even more.\n\nThe “Pic of Life Journey” cards were designed to facilitate re-authoring conversations, allowing us to revisit the positive moments and emotions in our lives and open a door to our preferred memories. We can bring to light and enrich the stories that involve important people, events, and beliefs, so as to construct our preferred identities, helping us see the best version of ourselves. Peter hopes that the photos of the “Pic of Life Journey” can help us feel the things that we love and value, evoke important emotions, and through the lens of narrative practice, we can share the stories of our lives more deeply. He hopes that by combining these two things that he loves, everyone can explore and appreciate the beauty of life. In this session, Peter will exchange ideas about what inspires him to create the cards. He would also share some experiences of using these cards in therapy sessions. He would love to hear from all of you about how you plan to use them in your work.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please download the printable version of the cards.\n\nIf you are interested in printing a physical version of the cards, you can use a local printing company. There are 235 double-sided cards in total.\n\nSuggested printing information:\n\nMaterial: 300g double-sided coated paper\n\nFinished size: 105x148mm\n\nPrinting: Double-sided printing\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Peter!\n\nJoin us for an extra special launch of The Power of Hope in Action: Raising Our Heads Above the Clouds Facilitation Guide by the Mt Elgon Self-Help Community Project.\n\nThe Mt Elgon Self-Help Community Project, based in rural Uganda, uses narrative practices to spark and sustain local social action and economic development among isolated and disadvantaged communities. Quite often, people in vulnerable communities are positioned as passive recipients of aid programs developed elsewhere. The Mt Elgon approach is different. It starts with local knowledge and values.\n\nThis facilitation guide has been created to assist practitioners to use the ‘Raising Our Heads Above the Clouds’ methodology developed by the Mt Elgon Self-Help Community Project. The guide describes the local values this approach is built on, and the narrative assumptions and principles that underpin it. We take the reader through each step of this innovative process, and also share stories from practitioners in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda and reflections about how the Mt Elgon approach fosters community economy through collective narrative practice.\n\nThe mission of the Mt Elgon Self-Help Community Project is to improve the quality of life of rural people affected by poverty, disasters, conflict and disease through capacity-building, income generation, self-help groups and using our resources in ways that benefit people and the environment.\n\nPlease view The Power of Hope in Action: Raising Our Heads Above the Clouds Facilitation Guide and then bring your questions for Caleb Wakhungu and the rest of the Mt Elgon Self-Help Community Project team!\n\nDr Ian Percy MSW PhD is a therapist, supervisor, consultant, trainer and published author in narrative and mindfulness approaches. He is an Accredited Mental Health Social Worker. Ian teaches professional development courses in counselling and psychotherapy for social service agencies, universities, and private organisations. He has specialised in training colleagues in Narrative Therapy since 1997. Ian has given workshops and papers at state, national and global conferences, teaching in Aotearoa/New Zealand, Singapore, the USA, Spain and Bhutan.\n\nIn this Meet the Author session, come and chat with Ian about two linked articles, which present concepts and practices for expanding the territory of narrative therapy to include working with attention and present moment awareness. While the narrative literature richly describes how persons are recruited by normative discourses into problem stories and offers a wide range of practices for developing counter narratives, less has been written about how dominant discourse also captures moment-by-moment attention. Ian and co-author David Paré identify parallels and differences between narrative therapy and the attentional practices associated with mindfulness. Both traditions support persons in living in a manner congruent with their values. Practices are depicted in terms of the ethics of daily life, in the sense that enhanced moment-by-moment attention promotes ethical intentionality.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by David Denborough.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Ian and David’s articles from the Journal of Systemic Therapies:\n\nNarrative Therapy and Mindfulness: Intention, Attention, Ethics. Part 1.\n\nNarrative Therapy and Mindfulness: Intention, Attention, Ethics. Part 2.\n\nThese articles are available for free via link only until July 21, 2023 – with thanks for permission from Guilford Press.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Ian!\n\nA short intro from Cathy:\n\nI am a professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Montreal and a therapist in private practice. I work a lot with the Indigenous community addressing issues of historical violence as well as responses and resistance to oppression. I am a Metis woman with Cree, Gwichin and Dene ancestry, as well as a cancer survivor. I am a co-founder of the Centre for Response-Based Practice.\n\nIn this Meet the Author session, come chat with Cathy about her article Relating to illness in therapy: A pilgrimage through uncertain terrain. As Cathy describes: In this article, I author explore the subject of supporting clients living with illness in the context of my counselling practice. I weave this approach to clinical practice, informed by response-based practice and the use of metaphor, together with my personal story of illness and recovery. I contextualise my own history as a Metis woman and therapist into the life of my family, living in Canada’s north. There, my maternal family lived in the midst of uranium extraction, a form of mining that resourced the Cold War and fueled the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Canada’s implication in militarism had devastating effects on Indigenous community members. I explore the use of metaphor as a form of co-constructed meaning in therapy. I present my own symbolic journey through cancer and treatment as a sacred pilgrimage in Spain. The various key points in treatment parallel significant stops along the Camino de Santiago de Compostela. As well, I explore how clients negotiate medical systems, impositions and negative social responses, as well as how they resource love, strength and care from family and friends. I apply a framework of response-based practice, seeking to understand the ways in which people preserve dignity and try to maximize safety and well-being. This includes the ways in which patients manage unsolicited advice and undesirable procedures with courage and grace.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Zan Maeder.\n\nTo prepare for this session, please read Cathy’s article: https://murmurations.cloud/ojs/index.php/murmurations/article/view/34/12\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Cathy!\n\nThe concept of psychiatric genetics, the notion of a “family history” or “genetic loading” of so-called mental illness, has a long history in the conception, scientific status, and practice of psychiatry. There is much that is contested about this concept, including the effects of putting it to use and the construction of humanness it assembles, locating the historical contingency of the concept, and its scientific validity. When there is a history of psychiatric diagnosis in a family, there are alternative interpretations and practices that can contribute to more livable lives, or lives where individual, familial, and collective knowledge, as well as complexity, is honored.\n\nDavid Newman lives and works in Sydney. He is currently passionate about working with those who are struggling with suicidal experience, narrative approaches to mental health work and the possibilities of group work. He is the author of the influential paper ‘Rescuing the said from the saying of it: Living documentation in narrative therapy’; founder of Sydney Narrative Therapy Centre; and a member of the Dulwich Centre teaching faculty.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Joseph Kalisa will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session please read David’s paper, Psychiatric Genetics\n\nNewman, D. (2023). Psychiatric Genetics. In: Lester, J.N., O’Reilly, M. (eds) The Palgrave Encyclopedia of Critical Perspectives on Mental Health. Palgrave Macmillan, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12852-4_60-2\n\nAnd then bring your questions for David!\n\nAmelia (she/her) is a mental health social worker and narrative therapist working with people who have experienced trauma. She lives and works on both unceded Gadigal and Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung country. Amelia is interested in the intersection of social justice and therapy as well as the ways in which mindfulness can and does play a role in narrative conversations, connecting and reconnecting us to preferred stories and ways of living. Her work is as much shaped by a narrative lens as it is by the people she consults with, and her practice is always evolving.\n\nIn her work, Amelia talks about ways in which the body can be included in narrative therapy conversations through both mindfulness (of the present moment experience and the questions we ask) and deconstruction, fostering a greater sense of connection to, and preferred stories of, the body. Working with people who have experienced multiple traumas, it is acknowledged that both the body and mind are impacted, therefore both are included in therapy aimed at healing and recovery. There is a growing interest in the body in therapy and this conversation seeks to contribute to this space, demonstrating both how narrative therapy already works with the body in a multitude of ways, and what also might be possible within these conversations. As narrative therapists, we are always co-structuring safety with those we meet, never imposing our questions or approach, and always taking care that the conversations are in the control of those consulting us.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations).\n\nTo prepare for this session, please watch Amelia’s recent Friday Afternoon Video below.\n\nAnd then bring your questions for Amelia!\n\nTuesday 13th June / 4:30pm (Adelaide, SA time)\n\nOur next Meet the Author event will feature Dr Abdul Ghaffar Stanikzai who as medical doctor and human rights advocate was the first investigator of the war crimes by Australia troops in Afghanistan that are now widely acknowledged. Dr Stanikzai (aka Dr Cricket) now lives in Adelaide and has worked for Dulwich Centre Foundation on a range of community projects, including Overcoming the ocean of depression and a Friendship Cricket match between Afghan interpreters and Australian military veterans. His collaborations with David Denborough have resulted in the paper Moral injury and moral repair: The possibilities of narrative practice. This session will be a chance to hear Dr Stanikzai’s perspective on the search for justice in relation to war crimes in Afghanistan and also about his current community projects.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). David Denborough will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for this session please:\n\nRead this newspaper article about Dr Stanikzai\n\nCheck out these audio and video resources: Overcoming the ocean of depression and a Friendship Cricket match\n\nAnd read this paper Moral injury and moral repair: the possibilities of narrative practice\n\nEmily Salja (she/her) is a narrative practitioner whose ethics and politics often clash with clinical professionalism and institutionalism. She seeks to gather stories, learn and share in ways that strengthen community. Born on the west coast of ‘canada’, Emily lives and works on the unceded traditional land of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc, Secwépemcúl’ecw and Nlakaʹpamuxʷ (Nlaka’pamux) peoples (‘kamloops, b.c., canada’).\n\nIn this Meet the Author session, come chat with Emily about her article which introduces the concept of ‘landscapes of possibility’ as an extension of and prequel to Michael White’s landscapes of action and meaning. As Emily describes: This article focuses on landscapes of possibility found in fantasy realms as they affect 2SLGBTQIA+ populations and disabled populations (communities in which I and many people I am in conversation with hold membership). I discuss considerations and limitations for landscapes of possibility and offer examples that illustrate the mechanics of implementing landscapes of possibility and integrating the results into landscapes of meaning and action.\n\nThis event will be facilitated by Tileah Drahm-Butler (of the Darumbal/Kulilli and Wanyurr Majay Yidinji Nations). Jill Freedman will offer reflections.\n\nTo prepare for the session please read Emily’s article.\n\nAnd then bring your question"
