However, serving regional and national markets requires the adaptation of products, services, and business models to local conditions. Since the late 1990s, the L’Oréal Paris brand—which accounts for half the sales of the consumer products division—has dealt with that tension by nurturing a pool of managers with mixed cultural backgrounds, placing them at the center of knowledge-based interactions in the company’s most critical activity: new-product development. L’Oréal Paris builds product development teams around these managers, who, by virtue of their upbringing and experiences, have gained familiarity with the norms and behaviors of multiple cultures and can switch easily among them. They are uniquely qualified to play several crucial roles: spotting new-product opportunities, facilitating communication across cultural boundaries, assimilating newcomers, and serving as a cultural buffer between executives and their direct reports and between subsidiaries and headquarters.",
