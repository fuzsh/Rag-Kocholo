Hi! Welcome to my website. I’m a multi-award-winning children's book author from Hong Kong. Three of my books have received international book awards, including my debut picture book, Can You Hear Me, Daddy?

​

I was born in Hong Kong but grew up in sunny Brisbane, Australia where I had Christmas during summer and called everyone 'mate'. I returned to Hong Kong to teach English after graduating from university with a B.Ed in Primary Education (First Class Honours). I also have an MA in English Language Teaching and over fifteen years of teaching experience. When my father passed away, I took a break from full-time teaching to travel, read and write while tutoring English and working freelance. During the pandemic, I started to look into publishing and made a New Year's Resolution to write and publish my own book. I joined a program called Self-Publishing School and three months later, I launched my first book. Since then, I have published more than several books in different genres.

My publishing endeavours have slowed down a little, but I'm working on some new stories, doing a few collaborative projects, and publishing in an anthology. I'm looking forward to sharing more new books with you soon! I hope to connect with a wider audience and share my future stories and books as they come out.
