He was the third of the four children and the youngest of the three sons of Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein and his late wife Princess Marie of Liechtenstein, born Countess Marie Aglaë of Wchinitz and Tettau, who died in 2021.\n\nA statment released by the Princely House of Liechtenstein on December 6, 2023 said: “The Princely House regrets to announce that H.S.H. Prince Constantin von und zu Liechtenstein passed away unexpectedly on 5 December 2023.”\n\nPrince Constantin was born March 15, 1972. He received a law degree from the University of Salzburg in Austria and worked primarily in the financial field, holding positions at investment firms both in the United States and in Europe. He also served on the boards and management teams of several of the family’s companies. From 2012 until his death in 2023, Prince Constantin served as General Director and chairman of the board of directors of the Prince of Liechtenstein Foundation.\n\nIn 1999, Prince Constantin married Countess Marie Gabriele Franziska Kálnoky de Kőröspatak . and the couple had three children: Prince Moritz (born 2003), Princess Georgina (born 2005), and Prince Benedikt (born 2008).\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Prince Constantin of Liechtenstein\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Principality of Liechtenstein Index\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

However, among Hereditary Prince Alois’ ancestors are royals from Austria, Bavaria, Portugal, and Spain. Several members of the Liechtenstein princely family including two sovereign princes, Prince Aloys II and the current Prince Hans-Adam II, married into the Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau family. The Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau family originated in the Kingdom of Bohemia, now located in the Czech Republic, and rose from minor nobles to counts (1628) and to princely status (1747) under the rule of the Habsburgs.\n\nHereditary Prince Alois, the current heir, married Duchess Sophie in Bavaria, a member of the House of Wittelsbach, formerly the reigning house of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Sophie is also second in line to the Jacobite succession to the British throne. The Jacobites sought to restore the British crown to King James II of England after he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and subsequently, to his heirs. The current Jacobite heir is Sophie’s childless uncle Franz, Duke of Bavaria, who has never pursued the claim. Franz’s heir is Sophie’s father, Maximilian, Duke in Bavaria who only has five daughters. As the eldest of her father’s daughters, Sophie will be his heir to the Jacobite claim and her eldest son Prince Joseph Wenzel is her heir.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: The Jacobite Succession – Pretenders to the British Throne\n\nParents, Grandparents, Great-Grandparents, Great-Great-Grandparents, and Great-Great-Great-Grandparents of Hereditary Prince Alois of Liechtenstein (born June 11, 1968)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Hereditary Prince Alois of Liechtenstein\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Principality of Liechtenstein Index\n\nThe links below are from Unofficial Royalty, Wikipedia, Leo’s Genealogics Website, The Peerage, or Geni.\n\nParents\n\nPrince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein (born 1945)\n\nCountess Marie Aglaë Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1940 – 2021)\n\nGrandparents\n\nFranz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein (1906 – 1989)\n\nCountess Georgina von Wilczek (1921 – 1989)\n\nCount Ferdinand Carl Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1907 – 1969)\n\nCountess Henriette Caroline of Ledebur-Wicheln (1910 – 2002)\n\nGreat-Grandparents\n\nPrince Aloys of Liechtenstein (1869 – 1955)\n\nArchduchess Elisabeth Amalie of Austria (1878 – 1960)\n\nCount Ferdinand Maria von Wilczek (1893 – 1977)\n\nCountess Norbertine Kinsky von Wchinitz and Tettau (1888 – 1923)\n\nCount Ferdinand Vincenz Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1866 – 1916)\n\nAglae Franziska Marie Aloysie von Auersperg (1868 – 1919)\n\nCount Eugen von Ledebur-Wicheln (1873 – 1945) – died in a Nazi concentration camp\n\nCountess Eleonore Larisch von Moennich (1888 – 1975)\n\nGreat-Great-Grandparents\n\nPrince Alfred of Liechtenstein (1842 – 1907)\n\nPrincess Henriette Maria of Liechtenstein (1843 – 1931)\n\nArchduke Karl Ludwig of Austria (1833 – 1896)\n\nInfanta Maria Theresa of Portugal (1855 – 1944)\n\nCount Johann Nepomuk von Wilczek (1861 – 1929)\n\nCountess Elisabeth Wilhelmine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1865 – 1941)\n\nCount Oktavian Zdenko Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1844 – 1932)\n\nCountess Georgine Ernestine Festétics de Tólna (1856 – 1934)\n\nPrince Ferdinand Bonaventura Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1834 – 1904)\n\nPrincess Marie Josepha of Liechtenstein (1835 – 1905)\n\nPrince Adolf Wilhelm von Auersperg (1821 – 1885)\n\nCountess Johanna Festetics de Tolna (1830 – 1884)\n\nCount Johann von Ledebur-Wicheln (1842 – 1903)\n\nKaroline Ernestine Czernin von Chudenitz (1847 – 1907)\n\nCount Heinrich Larisch von Moennich (1850 – 1918)\n\nCountess Henriette von Mönnich (1853 – 1916)\n\nGreat-Great-Great-Grandparents\n\nPrince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein (1802 – 1887)\n\nCountess Ewa Józefina Julia Potocka (1818 – 1895)\n\nAlois II, Prince of Liechtenstein (1796 – 1858)\n\nCountess Franziska Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau (1813 – 1881)\n\nArchduke Franz Karl of Austria (1802 – 1878)\n\nPrincess Sophie of Bavaria (1805 – 1872)\n\nKing Miguel I of Portugal (1802 – 1866) (deposed in 1834 before his marriage)\n\nPrincess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg (1831 – 1909)\n\nPrince Ferdinand Bonaventura Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1834 – 1904)\n\nPrincess Marie Josepha of Liechtenstein (1835 – 1905)\n\nCount Johann Nepomuk Wilczek (1837 – 1922)\n\nCountess Emma Maria Emo Capodilista (1833 – 1924)\n\nCount János Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1815 – 1868)\n\nIphygenia Therese Dadanyi de Gyülvész (1821 – 1882)\n\nCount Georg Festetics von Tolna (1815 – 1883)\n\nEugénia Erdődy (1826 – 1894)\n\nPrince Rudolf VI Kinsky von Wchintz und Tettau (1802 – 1836)\n\nCountess Wilhelmina von Colloredo-Mansfeld (1804 – 1871)\n\nPrince Karl of Liechtenstein (1790 – 1865)\n\nFranziska von Wrbna and Freudenthal (1799 – 1863)\n\nPrince Karl Wilhelm II von Auersperg (1782 – 1827)\n\nFriedrike Luise von Lenthe (1791- 1860)\n\nCount Ernõ János Vilmos Festetics de Tolna (1800 -1869)\n\nJohanna Klára Mária Kotz z Dobrz (1809 – 1869)\n\nCount Adolph Benno von Ledebur-Wicheln (1812- 1886)\n\nCountess Johanna von Nostitz-Rokitnitz (1819 – 1870)\n\nCount Jaromir Czernin von Chudenitz (1818 – 1908)\n\nKarolina Franziska Marianne von Schaffgotsch (1820 – 1876)\n\nCount Johann Larisch von Moennich (1821 – 1884)\n\nFranziska Kast von Ebelsberg (1828 – 1902)\n\nLeo Larisch von Mönnich (1824 – 1872)\n\nHelene Ştirbey (1831 – 1864)\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He increased the size of the family art collection started by his father Karl Eusebius by purchasing works by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck and other artists. Hans-Adam also had a reputation as a master builder. Among his buildings were two grand palaces in Vienna, Liechtenstein City Palace, still used as a residence by the princely family, and the Liechtenstein Garden Palace. which is now a museum, the home to part of the private art collection of the Princely House of Liechtenstein, one of the largest private collections in the world.\n\nErdmuthe’s husband Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein died in Vienna, Austria on June 16, 1712, at the age of 49. He was buried in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Brno, Moravia, now Vranov, Czech Republic. Because Hans-Adam had no surviving sons, he had chosen his distant cousin Prince Joseph Wenzel, the great-grandnephew of Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein, even though he was not next in line. The actual heir was his uncle Anton Florian but he was not very popular with the family. Anton Florian later did become Prince of Liechtenstein.\n\nAccording to the marriage contract, as the widow of Hans-Adam I, Erdmuthe received the estate in Plumlov, originally in Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. The estate was acquired in 1590 by the House of Liechtenstein which owned it until 1931. Erdmuthe also received a lump sum of 25,000 guilders, and rooms in the Liechtenstein Palace (link in German) in Vienna which was demolished in 1913. Erdmuthe spent most of her time in Vienna and in Judenau-Baumgarten, which was owned by the House of Liechtenstein and where Erdmuthe founded a hospital. She devoted herself to philanthropic activities, including providing shelters for the poor.\n\nErdmuthe survived her husband by twenty-five years, dying on March 16, 1737, in Vienna, Austria at the age of 84. She was buried with her husband in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Brno, Moravia, now Vranov, Czech Republic.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born in 1575 in Vienna, then in the Archduchy of Austria, she was the elder of the two daughters of Baron Johann von Boskowitz and Černahora and Baroness Anna von Kraigk, both members of Moravian noble families.\n\nAnna Maria had one sister. When their father died in 1597, Anna Maria and her sister Katharina inherited their father’s lands, including Boskovic Castle, because he had no male heirs.\n\nKatharina von Boskowitz and Černahora (1579 – 1637), married Maximilian of Liechtenstein, brother of Anna Maria’s husband, Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein, no children\n\nIn 1590, Anna Maria married Baron Karl von Liechtenstein, a Moravian nobleman and the son of Hartmann II, Baron of Liechtenstein and Countess Anna Maria of Ortenburg, and the future first Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein\n\nAnna Maria and Karl had four children:\n\nPrincess Anna Maria Franziska of Liechtenstein (1601 – 1640), married Maximilian, 2nd Prince of Dietrichstein, had eight children\n\nPrincess Franziska Barbara of Liechtenstein (1604 – 1655), married Wenzel Werner of T’Serclaes, Count of Tilly, had nine children\n\nPrince Heinrich of Liechtenstein (died young)\n\nKarl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein, (1611 – 1684), married his niece Princess Johanna Beatrix of Dietrichstein, had nine children\n\nThrough his relationship with the brothers, the childless Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and Archduke Matthias of Austria (the future Holy Roman Emperor Matthias), Anna Maria’s husband Karl gained political positions and land, and ultimately became the first Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein. In 1592, Karl became the treasurer of Archduke Matthias. Karl and his younger brothers, Maximilian, the husband of Anna Maria’s sister, and Gundakar, had been raised in the Evangelical Lutheran faith, but they all converted to Catholicism in 1599. In 1599, Karl became the chief judge in Moravia. In 1600, Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II appointed Karl Chief Steward at the Imperial Court in Vienna, Austria. Four years later, Karl was appointed Governor of Moravia.\n\nBesides being the elected Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II also held the traditional Habsburg territories as King of Bohemia, King of Hungary, King of Croatia, Archduke of Austria, and Margrave of Moravia. A power struggle developed between the childless Rudolf and his heir and brother Matthias. In April 1608, Matthias besieged the city of Prague and forced his brother Rudolf to negotiate and sign a peace treaty. This resulted in the redistribution of power. Rudolf kept Bohemia, Silesia, and Lusatia while Matthias received Hungary, Austria, and Moravia. Karl of Liechtenstein had supported Matthias in the power struggle. On December 20, 1608, Matthias raised Karl from Baron of Liechtenstein to Fürst of Liechtenstein (Prince), a reigning sovereign ruler or monarch. (Non-reigning descendants of a Fürst are referred to in German as Prinz (prince) or Prinzessin (princess.)\n\nMatthias was elected Holy Roman Emperor upon Rudolf’s death in 1612 and reigned until he died in 1619. In 1614, Holy Roman Emperor Matthias gave Karl another reward, the Duchy of Troppau in Silesia. In November 1620, Karl and his brother Maximilian took lead roles in the imperial victory at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague during the Thirty Years War. In 1622, Karl was appointed governor and then Viceroy of the Kingdom of Bohemia.\n\nKarl’s younger brother Maximilian and his wife Katharina, Anna Maria’s sister, founded a Pauline monastery and had the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary built on the monastery grounds in the village of Vranov, then in Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. A crypt in the church served as the burial site for members of the House of Liechtenstein. When more room was needed for burials another crypt was built and the church then had the Old Crypt and the New Crypt.\n\nAnna Maria died at the age of 50, on June 6, 1625, in Plumov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. She was buried in the Old Crypt at the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary. Karl survived his wife by nearly two years, dying on February 12, 1627, aged 57, at the Liechtenstein Palace (link in German) on Lesser Town Square in Prague, Kingdom of Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic. He was also buried in the Old Crypt at the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
