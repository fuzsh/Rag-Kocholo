        "text": "Sometimes he goes by 'Wenzel Reitberg' on social media. But he doesn’t share anything about his private life.\n\nThis Czech article says that Liechtenstein court repeatedly refused to provide any picture of him for the newspaper.\n\nApparently they are hiding him or something. ?\n\nhttps://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/...&utm_medium=z-boxiku&utm_source=www.seznam.cz\n\nI don’t think it is odd for them to not to provide picture of Wenzel to the Czech press because the family still has issues with the Czech government over properties that were expropriated from them so why would they provide a picture of Wenzel to the Czech press.\n\nIt's strange that they didn't provide a photo of Joseph Wenzel. He has been interviewed and photographed before.\n\nIt is also strange that Joseph Wenzel still does not participate in official solo acts. He appears very few times and almost nothing is known about him.\n\nI don’t think it has to do with the media in general, but the fact that it is the Czech press.But the family is generally media shy so there’s that probably. The media in Liechtenstein only has two newspapers and only focuses on the works of the Hereditary couple, his parents not him so very little is mentioned of him.\n\nI don’t think it is odd for them to not to provide picture of Wenzel to the Czech press because the family still has issues with the Czech government over properties that were expropriated from them so why would they provide a picture of Wenzel to the Czech press.\n\nSo, is it your inference that the prince and his family have reacted to the rulings against them in court cases in Czechia by developing hostile sentiments towards the entire country of Czechia and its people?\n\nI think it can be summed up - we've seen pictures of him when he has been interviewed etc, if he agrees to another interview maybe we'll get another picture. They are a a relatively media shy family so I can see why they don't just hand out pictures of access easily, certainly without purpose.\n\nNonetheless, there are formal photographs of the reigning and hereditary princes on the official website of the family, as well as their biographies in Czech(!), English and German.\n\nhttps://fuerstenhaus.li/en/the-princely-house/h-s-h-hereditary-prince-alois/\n\nhttps://fuerstenhaus.li/en/the-princely-house/h-s-h-prince-hans-adam-ii/\n\nI don’t think it is odd for them to not to provide picture of Wenzel to the Czech press because the family still has issues with the Czech government over properties that were expropriated from them so why would they provide a picture of Wenzel to the Czech press.\n\nPrincess Marie of Liechtenstein (Wenzel's grandmother) was originally from Czech Republic herself. So I don't think Liechtenstein princely family has a problem with that country in particular.\n\nI noticed they are trying to keep Wenzel out of press as a much as they can, which it's quite odd. Sending some pictures of the future heir to the throne is not a violation of privacy.\n\nMaybe he is self-conscious about his physical appearance. Even his picture on Wikipedia was changed from a recent photo in his early twenties to a stamp of him when he was a child.\n\nIs Joseph Wenzel not very interested in inheriting the principality?\n\nOr would the family prefer Joseph Wenzel to have a normal life before becoming crown prince?\n\nThere are photos of Joseph Wenzel with his grandfather and father.\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nbglQloy...OTGGp8uACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/21903737_LDYBC.jpeg\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kw6X6Vhx...b4e-6b10-4035-80e0-fd05b712c57-resize-750.jpg\n\nThe media in Liechtenstein is very small and does not focus on the activities of Wenzel.\n\nPrincess Marie of Liechtenstein (Wenzel's grandmother) was originally from Czech Republic herself. So I don't think Liechtenstein princely family has a problem with that country in particular.\n\nI noticed they are trying to keep Wenzel out of press as a much as they can, which it's quite odd. Sending some pictures of the future heir to the throne is not a violation of privacy.\n\nMaybe he is self-conscious about his physical appearance. Even his picture on Wikipedia was changed from a recent photo in his early twenties to a stamp of him when he was a child.\n\nHis grandmother coming from the Czech lands doesn’t change the fact that the family including his late grandmother’s were expropriated of property. The family actually has issues with the government there over property. More importantly, I don’t think that Wenzel is image conscious, and it’s not really the concern of the Czech press to get pictures of a person who does not represent their country and Wenzel is a private person who is not a head of state and is entitled to privacy like anyone else. I simply think that Wenzel is media shy like most of the family.\n\nSo, is it your inference that the prince and his family have reacted to the rulings against them in court cases in Czechia by developing hostile sentiments towards the entire country of Czechia and its people?\n\nNonetheless, there are formal photographs of the reigning and hereditary princes on the official website of the family, as well as their biographies in Czech(!), English and German.\n\nhttps://fuerstenhaus.li/en/the-princely-house/h-s-h-hereditary-prince-alois/\n\nhttps://fuerstenhaus.li/en/the-princely-house/h-s-h-prince-hans-adam-ii/\n\nI don’t think they dislike Czech people, but the courts who have constantly ruled against their property claims. What I am trying to say is that why should the Czech media ask or request for pictures of a person who isn’t a citizen or resident of their country. But more importantly, Wenzel is a private individual and his life is just that a private one and the family is media shy and would prefer to keep media from developing interest in their private lives.\n\nWenzel is not just a private person. He is the future head of state of Liechtenstein... and most likely the next regent in-between - with much more power (at that point) than most of his contemporaries in a similar position.\n\nWould you also call the Duke of Cambridge a private person who is not a head of state and entitled to privacy like anyone else? Fortunately, he does realize that while he has a right of privacy, there are limitations to that right based on his position as the future head of state.\n\nBut he’s not going to be head of state for a very long time and he does no representational duties, so for now he’s a private person. You can’t compare him to Prince William in that regard because William does representational duties and is a publicly funded royal. The media in his country largely leave him alone. Why the Czech media is interested I don’t know why nor do I understand. More importantly, the focus is his parents activities, not his own."
