        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\nÂ© Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom marked seventy years on the British throne. On September 9, 2015, Queen Elizabeth II surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria, who reigned 63 years, 216 days, as the longest-reigning British monarch.\n\nThe top ten longest-reigning British monarchs:\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, reigned February 6, 1952 â September 8, 2022; 70 years, 214 days\n\nQueen Victoria, reigned June 20, 1837 â January 22, 1901, for 63 years, 216 days\n\nKing George III, reigned October 25, 1760 â January 29, 1820, for 59 years, 96 days\n\nKing Henry III, reigned October 18, 1216 â November 16, 1272, for 56 years, 29 days\n\nKing Edward III, reigned January 25, 1327 â June 21, 1377, for 50 years, 147 days\n\nQueen Elizabeth I, reigned November 17, 1558 â March 24, 1603, for 44 years, 127 days\n\nKing Henry VI, reigned August 31, 1422 â March 4, 1461, and October 31, 1470 â April 11, 1471, for 38 years, 347 days\n\nKing Ãthelred II, reigned March 18, 978 â December 25, 1013, and February 3, 1014 â April 23, 1016, for 37 years, 362 days\n\nKing Henry VIII, reigned April 22, 1509 â January 28, 1547, for 37 years, 281 days\n\nKing Henry I, reigned August 3, 1100 â December 1, 1135, for 35 years, 120 days\n\nAs of September 8, 2022, the day of her death, Queen Elizabeth II was second on the list of longest-reigning monarchs of internationally recognized sovereign states with verifiable reigns by exact date, after only King Louis XIV of France, who reigned for 72 years, 110 days (May 14, 1643 â September 1, 1715).\n\nRead more about Queen Elizabeth II at:\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom\n\n********************\n\nMay 12, 1937, Coronation Day of King George VI\n\nAs the second son of the sovereign, Queen Elizabeth IIâs father Prince Albert, Duke of York (known as Bertie) was not expected to inherit the throne. His role would be to support his father King George V of the United Kingdom, and then later his brother The Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII, known as David in the family.\n\nBertie married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 and they had two daughters: Elizabeth born in 1926 and Margaret born in 1930. However, things were soon to change for the York family. In January 1936, Bertieâs father King George V died. His elder brother became King Edward VIII and Bertie became heir presumptive to the throne. The new king was unmarried and involved with Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American. This relationship would soon bring about unheard-of events in the British monarchy. Failing to reach an agreement with the Government by which he and Mrs. Simpson could marry, King Edward VIII abdicated on December 11, 1936, giving his famous âwithout the woman I loveâ speech on the radio. Upon Parliamentâs passing of the Abdication Act, Bertie became the new King of the United Kingdom, taking the regnal name George VI, in honor of his father, and to stress the continuity of the British monarchy.\n\nKing George VIâs elder daughter, the 10-year-old Princess Elizabeth, was now the heir presumptive to the British throne. However, because there was always the possibility of a younger brother being born and becoming heir apparent, Elizabeth did not receive any of the titles traditionally held by the heir. For her fatherâs entire reign, she remained Princess Elizabeth.\n\nEventually, the British succession would be more equitable. The Succession to The Crown Act 2013, which formally went into effect on March 26, 2015, put in place absolute primogeniture, which means that for those born after October 28, 2011, the eldest child born becomes the heir to his or her parent, regardless of gender. On April 23, 2018, with the birth of her younger brother Prince Louis of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Queen Elizabeth IIâs great-granddaughter, became the first British princess not to be overtaken in the line of succession by her younger brother.\n\n********************\n\nKing George VI waving goodbye to Elizabeth and Philip on January 31, 1952\n\nIn 1947, when Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten, born Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark, her father was only fifty-two years old and it was thought she would not become Queen for years, enabling her to settle into married life and then life with children. By 1949, King George VIâs health was failing. He was suffering from lung cancer and several other ailments. Elizabeth and Philip began to take on more royal duties, often filling in for King George VI when he was unable to attend events. A tour of Australia had been postponed and on January 31, 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set off in King George VIâs place. He came to the airport to see them off, looking drawn and frail. It would be the last time he would see his daughter. On February 6, 1952, 56-year-old King George VI passed away in his sleep at Sandringham House in Norfolk, England.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II returning to London on February 7, 1952 after her fatherâs death\n\nDuring a stop-over in Kenya, on February 6, 1952, Elizabeth and Philip had just returned to Sagana Lodge, where they were staying in Kenya after a night spent at Treetops Hotel when the news arrived of the death of King George VI and consequently Elizabethâs immediate accession to the throne. Philip broke the news to the new queen. They immediately returned to London, where Queen Elizabeth II attended the Accession Council on February 8, 1952.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: When The British Monarch Dies: The Accession Council\n\nFor more information about what happens when the British monarch dies, see Unofficial Royalty: When The British Monarch Dies.\n\n********************\n\nQueen Elizabeth II does not intend to abdicate although her heir Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales and other family members have taken on more of her duties and she carries out fewer public engagements. The Platinum Jubilee was celebrated in 2022 to mark the 70th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth. The celebration plans were formally unveiled by Buckingham Palace on January 10, 2022. Events took place throughout the year, culminating in a four-day holiday weekend from Thursday, June 2, 2022 to Sunday, June 5, 2022.\n\nFor more information, see Unofficial Royalty: Queen Elizabeth IIâs Platinum Jubilee Weekend\n\nOn February 5, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II released a Platinum Jubilee message to the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. The highlight of the message was her statement that when her son Charles becomes king, âCamilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her loyal service.â\n\nQueen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom died at the age of 96, at Balmoral Castle, her home in Balmoral, Scotland, on September 8, 2022, at 3:10 PM, more than three hours before the public was informed. The death certificate, released by National Records of Scotland cites the Queen as dying of âold ageâ.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II Resources\n\nUnofficial Royalty: House of Windsor Index\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Ancestors of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Contemporary Monarchs of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nUnofficial Royalty: First Cousins of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Queen Elizabeth II and Lt Philip Mountbatten, RN\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

It is the ROYAL FAMILY PICTURE ANNUAL â Volume One, published âin association withâ The Daily Graphic by Pitkins Pictorials Ltd. In 1952. The volume of photos and narrative traces the Royal Familyâs activities from August 1951 to August 1952â¦ which is to say the final six months of the life of King George VI, and the first six months of Queen Elizabeth IIâs reign.\n\nOver the last few months, as we have drawn ever nearer to HM the Queenâs Platinum Jubilee observance, I have found myself picking up this little volume repeatedly, to remind myself of how the story of the Kingâs final months unfolded, as well as the more widely familiar story of his death and the Queenâs Accession to the Throne. I have found it a poignant storyâ¦ such as occurs for so many families. But in this case, it is the story of a very particular familyâ¦ of the last King-Emperor and his wife, his elder daughter and heir, with her husband and two children, his younger daughter who had only just come of age and an elderly mother who was beginning to experience her own decline. (Queen Mary died in March 1953.) In what follows, from this and various other sources, I want to briefly convey the broad outlines of King George VIâs final months, culminating in the first two weeks of February 1952.\n\nKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth (soon to be Queen Mother) departed London for Balmoral on the Royal Train on the evening of 2 August 1951. They were accompanied on the journey by their grandchildren, Prince Charles (age 2-3/4) and Princess Anne (just turning 1), and the childrenâs nannies. After fulfilling some engagements in Edinburgh on 4 August, Princess Elizabeth joined the children at Birkhall, followed by Prince Philip on 10 August. Princess Margaret arrived on 13 August. The immediate family was assembled.\n\nIt was intended to be a ânormalâ family holiday at Balmoral, essentially as it had been from the days of Queen Victoria to the present. The King and his guests would shoot grouse. The family would attend services at Crathie Kirk. Guests would come and go. But, there were also to be a couple of very special celebrations, the first birthday of Princess Anne on 15 August, and the twenty-first birthday of Princess Margaret on 21 August. A special family group photoshoot was arranged to mark the two occasions.\n\nThe royal family at Balmoral in August 1951\n\nThis holiday was additionally intended as a recuperative time for the King. His health had been concerning since May, including an inflammation in the lung. Advised to rest and recover, the King canceled his public engagements in June and July. By early September, however, concerns were renewed. The King and Royal Family attended the Braemar Gathering on 6 September, but the next day he flew to London for an in-depth examination by medical experts. After returning briefly to Scotland, the King departed his beloved Balmoral forever in mid-September. On 18 September it was announced that âstructural changesâ had occurred in the Kingâs lung. Three days later it was announced that he would be having surgery. An operating room was quickly fitted up at Buckingham Palace, and the surgery took place on 23 September. The Kingâs cancerous left lung was removed. (It is believed that he was never actually told he had âcancerâ â generally a taboo word in that generation â though he may have realized it.) He began an extended period of recuperation and recovery.\n\nThe Royal Family undertook to âkeep calm and carry onâ in the immediate aftermath of the Kingâs surgery. Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were due to depart for a tour of Canada, and a brief visit to the United States, shortly afterward. The decision was made for the trip to proceed, but they would fly out from the United Kingdom on 7 October, rather than travel by sea as first planned. They departed accordingly, leaving their children in the care of the Queen and Princess Margaretâ¦ and, of course, the nannies.\n\nElizabeth and Philip were away from 8 October to 17 November. They crisscrossed Canada and paid a brief visit to the United States, including an official dinner with President and Mrs. Truman at Blair House in Washington DC (the White House being under renovation at the time). This was Princess Elizabethâs first encounter with a sitting American President, although sheâd met Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt on several occasions during and since World War II. At the end of the trip, they returned to the United Kingdom by sea.\n\nThe future Queen Elizabeth II with American President Harry Truman in the autumn of 1951\n\nAs the King recuperated and grew stronger he returned to a few low-key duties, audiences, meetings, and so on. This included the post-General Election meetings on 26 October to accept Clement Atleeâs resignation as Prime Minister, and to ask Winston Churchill to form a government.\n\nHaving the grandchildren staying at Buckingham Palace meant that Prince Charles celebrated his third birthday with them, on 14 November. Much in the way that the little Princess Elizabeth (age 3) bonded with her grandfather during a recuperative period at Bognor Regis in the spring of 1929, the King now had the opportunity to bond more closely with his grandson. In fact, Prince Charles spent quite a lot of time around his grandparents during the Kingâs final monthsâ¦ at Balmoral, at Buckingham Palace, and then at Sandringham. (Princess Anne, too. But she was only 1 at the time.)\n\nKing George VI with his grandson Prince Charles on Charlesâ 3rd birthday\n\nOn 14 December, the Royal Family gathered at Buckingham Palace for a small luncheon to celebrate the Kingâs 56th birthday. Along with the Queen and Princess Margaret, the King was joined by Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Queen Mary, The Princess Royal, The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and the Duchess of Kent. Also on 14 December, the King knighted his surgeon, Dr. Price Thomas, and pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Marshall, who had attended him.\n\nAs in more recent times, the Royal Familyâs Christmas holiday began when the King and Queen, Princess Elizabeth and the children, Princess Margaret, and Queen Mary, departed for Sandringham on the Royal Train on 21 December. (Prince Philip followed on the 22nd.) It was the first public sighting of the King since his surgery. The Gloucester and Kent families joined the house party in the following days.\n\nChristmas at Sandringham was, then, much as it continued up to 2019. There were special services at St. Mary Magdalene Church. After the large Christmas Dinner, the King and his family listened to the pre-recorded Christmas Broadcast. In listening to the Kingâs âlastâ speech, you can hear not only the lingering post-surgical hoarseness but also the remnants of the old royal stammer.\n\nAs 1952 began, the King and Queen remained at Sandringham. The King attended to both his official boxes and estate business along. He even went out with the guns on several occasions.\n\nThe big upcoming event for Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip was the Commonwealth Tour they would be undertaking in the Kingâs stead, beginning in February. The pace of preparations picked up quickly in January, though they still spent nearly three weeks of the month at Sandringham. The children would once again be staying with the King and Queen while their parents were away. Elizabeth and Philip returned to London on 25 January for a week of engagements, packing, and last-minute details.\n\nKing George VI, Queen Elizabeth, and Princess Margaret came down to London on 28 January. Over the next couple of days, he undertook some âlight dutiesâ at Buckingham Palace, including several audiences. On the night of 30 January the King and Queen, Elizabeth and Philip, and Princess Margaret attended South Pacific at Drury Lane. The King received an ovation which he acknowledged with a wave from the Royal Box. It was King Georgeâs first true public outing since September. On the following morning the King, Queen, and Margaret were at London Airport with the Prime Minister and other relatives to send Princess Elizabeth and Philip off to Kenya, and the Commonwealth. The King looked gaunt and frail, hatless in the late January weather. The family returned to Sandringham the next day, 1 February.\n\nKing George VI at London Airport on January 31, 1952\n\nUpon their arrival in Kenya, Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip fulfilled a series of official engagements in Nairobi before journeying on to Royal Lodge, Saguna, their wedding gift from the people of Kenya. They were to spend a few quiet days at the lodge before departing on the Commonwealth Tour. Among their party was Philipâs cousin, Lady Pamela Mountbatten (Hicks), who was serving Elizabeth as a Lady-in-Waiting on the Tour. Along with the Queen, she is nowâ¦ at age 93â¦ the only surviving member of the immediate royal party.\n\nMeanwhile, at Sandringham, the King attended to business as he could. On 3 February he attended church with the Queen and Princess Margaret, walking back to the house with them afterward. All accounts say that Tuesday, 5 February 1952, was a âgoodâ day for King George VI. He spent the afternoon with the âKeeperâs Dayâ shoot on the estate, enjoying himself. He got to spend some time with Prince Charles and Princess Anne at Tea. After dinner Princess Margaret played the piano. He retired to his room to do a bit of paperwork, enjoyed a cup of cocoa, and went to bed. At midnight the policeman on duty saw him latching his bedroom window, after which he turned out the light. Sometime in the night, he died. âCoronary thrombosisâ is the longstanding official cause of death. More recently other possible causes have been suggested, such as an embolism or hemorrhage in his right lung.\n\nThe next morning, it is said, Prince Charles noticed one of the maids crying, and asked why? âBecause your grandfather has gone away.â He was told. The child was confused, but no further answers were forthcoming. Eventually Queen Elizabeth â the new âQueen Motherâ â came to see him and tell him that his parents would be coming home unexpectedly soon. As Iâve read, he then asked his grandmother where his grandfather was, at which point she broke down in tears. It was finally his mother who explained, as best one can to a 3-year-old, that his grandfather had died.\n\nIn Kenya, the royal party had spent an exciting night observing the wildlife at the Tree-Tops Hotel, Nyeri, before returning to the Saguna Royal Lodge. It was to be some hours before the news reached them, and was confirmed. Prince Philip took his wife out for a walk on the grounds to break the news. Observers remarked that he looked like the weight of the world had descended upon him. Her secretary duly asked by what name she wanted to be known? âWhy, my own of course.â And so the second Elizabeth acceded to the throne.\n\nThere remained the whirlwind of arrangements to head immediately back to the U.K., a trip delayed some hours by thunderstorms en route. Messages had to be sent. Mourning clothes had to be procured. (The Queenâs packed ones were in Nairobi, but they were flying more directly back. Fresh ones were rushed to the airplane when they got back to London.) At her request, no photos were taken of her until she reached London. As they departed Saguna Lodge the accompanying journalists lined the road in respect, with their cameras sitting at their feet.\n\nDressed in black Queen Elizabeth II sets foot on British soil for the first time since her accession as she lands at London Airport following the death of her father King George VI\n\nReaching London on 7 February, she descended the airplane stepsâ¦ discretely followed by Prince Philipâ¦ to be greeted by her Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, The Duke of Gloucester, and various officials. Arriving home at Clarence House, her first visitor was âher old Grannyâ, Queen Mary, who said she came to kiss her Sovereignâs hand. The next day, 8 February, was occupied by the official Accession Council and Proclamation. Then, finally, she could depart to her family at Sandringham.\n\nIt was three days later, 11 February 1952, that George VIâs body was brought to London to lie-in-state at Westminster Hall. Charles and Anne remained at Sandringham with the nannies. Perhaps the most striking photograph of all the solemnities emerged from the Lying-in-State, that of the three black-clad queens â Elizabeth, Mary, and Elizabeth (QM) â awaiting the arrival of the coffin at Westminster. Queen Mary looked spectral. After that, the aging Dowager (nearly 85, which was âolderâ then than now) did not in fact attend any of the rest of the funeral ritesâ¦ although she later watched the funeral procession pass down The Mall from her window at Marlborough House.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, Queen Mary, and The Queen Mother await the arrival of King George VIâs coffin at Westminster Hall in London on February 11, 1952\n\nKing George was buried at Windsor on 15 February 1952, in rites at St. Georgeâs Chapel not unlike those we saw for Prince Philip earlier this yearâ¦ except, of course, in scale. In 1969 the tiny George VI Memorial Chapel was added to St. Georgeâs Chapel, and the Kingâs remains were moved there.\n\nOn 6 February 2022, ninety-five-year-old Queen Elizabeth II is expected to follow her tradition of having a small service of remembrance for her father at Sandringham, 70 years to the day after his passing. For her, the accession anniversary is a day of remembrance, not celebration.\n\nThese coming weeks will also mark the twentieth anniversary of the deaths of Princess Margaret (9 February) and the Queen Mother (30 March), followed by the first anniversary of Prince Philipâs death (9 April).\n\nRecent months have seen increasing concern for the Queenâs health. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, The Princess Royal, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex have been taking most of her public engagements. In the few instances where she has been seen, shown at a private audience or glimpsed as she is being driven somewhere, she seems increasingly frail.\n\nIn the course of time, the Queen, too, will pass on. It is the âway of all fleshâ as it is said. When the time comes, the plan is for her to be buried in the George VI Chapel at Windsor, along with her parents, her sister Margaret, and her beloved Philip. But, for now, she continues carrying on, day by day. May God bless and keep her, always!\n\nYours aye,\n\nKen Cuthbertson, the Laird oâ Thistle\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances. It is permissible to use a link that directs to Unofficial Royalty.\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\nÂ© Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nOriginally, a Roman Catholic church, Uppsala Cathedral in Uppsala, Sweden became a Lutheran church during the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. It is now a Church of Sweden, the Evangelical Lutheran national church in Sweden. Uppsala Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Uppsala, the Primate of Sweden.\n\nAt the end of the Viking Age (circa 793 â 1066), the Viking temple at Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala) was replaced by a Christian church. The date of construction of the church at Gamala Uppsala is unknown but a Bishop of Uppsala was appointed in 1123. After the church was damaged by a fire, local church officials sought permission from Pope Alexander IV to build a larger church nearby. Permission was given with the condition that the location name of Uppsala would be preserved. A new site was chosen in nearby Ãstra Aros whose name was changed to Uppsala.\n\nConstruction started in 1272 on the site of an earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity. This earlier church is related to the story of Saint Erik IX of Sweden (reigned circa 1156 â 1160), Swedenâs patron saint who is buried at Uppsala Cathedral. Magnus Henriksson, a Danish lord and a claimant to the throne of Sweden, gathered an army near Ãstra Aros where Erik planned to attend Mass, in that earlier stone church, on the Feast of the Ascension, May 18, 1160. After Erik attended Mass, he armed himself, and with a few men, went out to meet Magnusâ troops. Erik was pulled off his horse by Magnusâ troops who stabbed him and then beheaded him. Magnus Henriksson reigned for a year as King Magnus II before he was killed.\n\nThe church was designed by unknown French architects who supervised the construction until 1281. Progress on the construction was slow because of the cold climate, the plague, and financial difficulties. In 1287, French master builder Ãtienne de Bonneuil and his assistants traveled to Sweden to work on the cathedral. By the end of the 14th century, the initial plans were completed. However, when the cathedral was consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii, it still was not complete. The cathedral was dedicated to Saint Lawrence (one of the seven deacons of the city of Rome who were martyred in 258) Saint Eric IX of Sweden (the patron saint of Sweden although he was never canonized by the Roman Catholic Church), and Saint Olaf (the patron saint of Norway).\n\nOver the years, fire damage required some renovations. From 1885 â 1893, the architect Helgo Zettervall oversaw comprehensive restoration work, seeking to give the cathedral a French High Gothic appearance. He added pointed French spires to the towers and in an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls. He has been criticized for not respecting the cathedralâs original Brick Gothic style. Further renovation work from 1963 â 1977 led by Swedish architect Ãke Porne (link in Swedish) improved the buildingâs structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of Zettervallâs cement additions to the exterior of the cathedral were removed.\n\n********************\n\nThe Shrine of Saint Erik IX of Sweden\n\nSaint Erik IX of Sweden is said to have been buried first in the church at Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala). In 1273, his remains were transferred to the new cathedral in Uppsala which was still under construction. The gilded silver casket that we see today was made in 1574 â 1579 by King Johan III of Sweden to replace an earlier casket that was melted down when he needed money.\n\nFrom 2014 â 2016, the remains in the shrine were examined. The researchers were 90% sure that the remains are those of Saint Erik IX of Sweden. Carbon-14 testing matched the date of Erikâs death and the manner of death fits the story of Erikâs death. The remains are from a person who died a violent death, probably decapitation. The remains also show that the person was about 35 years old at the time of his death, was strongly built, healthy, and physically active during his life.\n\n********************\n\nThe High Altar\n\nThe high altar is used for the cathedralâs most important services. It is also here that all Swedish bishops are ordained. The silver chandelier is from 1647. The large crucifix in silver and crystal was installed in 1976.\n\nThe altarpieces have changed over the years. From 1725 â 1731, Swedish-German furniture maker and sculptor Burchard Precht worked on a large Baroque altarpiece. It remained in Uppsala Cathedral until it was removed during Helgo Zettervallâs restoration at the end of the nineteenth century. At that time, Prechtâs altarpiece was replaced by a neo-Gothic oak altarpiece designed by Swedish architect Folke Zettervall, Helgo Zettervallâs son. However, Prechtâs altarpiece can still be seen at the high altar in the Gustaf Vasa Church in Stockholm.\n\nFolke Zettervallâs altarpiece was removed in 1964. It was replaced for several years by the SkÃ¥nelaskÃ¥pet, a late medieval altar cabinet in oak, made in Brussels during the early 16th century, purchased for the Uppsala Cathedral from SkÃ¥nela Church in 1912. The current altarpiece consists of a cross in silver and crystal. It was designed by Swedish architect Ãke Porne, who led the 1963 â 1977 renovation of Uppsala Cathedral, and was made by Bertil Berggren-AskenstrÃ¶m (link in Swedish), a Swedish sculptor and silversmith.\n\n*******************\n\nThe Pulpit\n\nThe ornate pulpit, the largest in Sweden, was designed by Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and carved by Swedish-German furniture maker and sculptor Burchard Precht. It was a gift from Queen Hedwig Eleonora, the wife of King Karl X Gustav, after the fire of 1702 and completed in 1710. Helgo Zettervall had the pulpit removed during the 1885 â 1893 renovation he led. He wanted to replace the Baroque masterpiece with a pulpit in the Gothic style. However, he did not have the funds for a new pulpit and so Prechtâs pulpit returned to its place.\n\n*******************\n\nThe Restored Frescoes\n\nDuring the Reformation, the medieval frescoes on the walls and ceilings had been whitewashed. Many of these beautiful frescoes were uncovered and restored during Ãke Porneâs 1963 â 1977 renovations.\n\n*******************\n\nCoronations\n\nFrom 1441 â 1719, all but three Swedish monarchs were crowned at Uppsala Cathedral.\n\nSeptember 14, 1441 â Christopher of Bavaria, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, crowned King of Sweden\n\nJune 29, 1448 â Karl Knutsson, King of Sweden and Norway, crowned King of Sweden\n\nJuly 2, 1448 â Katarina Karlsdotter, second wife of Karl Knutsson\n\nJune 29, 1457 â Christian I, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, crowned King of Sweden\n\nJuly 3, 1457 â Dorothea of ââBrandenburg, wife of Christian I\n\nJanuary 12, 1528 â Gustav I Vasa, King of Sweden\n\nOctober 6, 1536 â Margareta Leijonhufvud, second wife of Gustav I Vasa\n\nJune 29, 1561 â Erik XIV, King of Sweden\n\nJuly 10, 1569 â Johan III, King of Sweden and his first wife Katarina Jagellonica of Poland\n\nFebruary 19, 1594 â Sigismund III Vasa, King of Sweden and his first wife Anna of Austria\n\nMarch 15, 1607 â Karl IX, King of Sweden and his second wife Christina of Holstein-Gottorp\n\nOctober 12, 1617 â Gustavus II Adolphus the Great, King of Sweden\n\nJune 6, 1654 â Karl X Gustav, King of Sweden\n\nSeptember 28, 1675 â Karl XI, King of Sweden\n\nMarch 17, 1719 â Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden\n\n*******************\n\nWedding\n\nOctober 1, 1536 â Gustav I Vasa, King of Sweden and his second wife Margareta Leijonhufvud\n\n*******************\n\nBurials\n\nExcept for Saint Erik IX, all the royal burials at Uppsala Cathedral are members of the family of King Gustav I Vasa. He was the first king of the House of Vasa and is considered the founding father of the modern Swedish state. During the Swedish War of Liberation (1521 â 1523), Gustav Vasa successfully deposed King Christian II from the throne of Sweden, ending the Kalmar Union between Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. On June 6, 1523, Gustav Vasa was elected King of Sweden by the Swedish Riksdag (legislature) and soon all Danish troops were driven out of the country. King Gustav I Vasa ranks among Swedenâs greatest monarchs and some argue that he was the most significant ruler in Swedish history. He ended foreign domination in Sweden, centralized and reorganized the government, cut religious ties to Rome, established the Church of Sweden, and founded Swedenâs hereditary monarchy.\n\nSaint Erik IX (circa 1120-1125 â 1160)\n\nKatharina of Saxe-Lauenburg (1513 â 1535), Gustav I Vasaâs first wife\n\nMargaret Leijonhufvud ( 1516 â 1551), Gustav I Vasaâs second wife\n\nKing Gustav I Vasa (1496 â 1560)\n\nKatarina Jagellonica of Poland (1526 â 1583) Johan IIIâs first wife\n\nKing Johan III (1537 â 1592), son of Gustav I Vasa\n\nGunilla Bielke (1568 â 1597) Johan IIIâs second wife.\n\nGustav of Saxe-Lauenburg (circa 1570 â 1597), Gustav I Vasaâs grandson\n\nElisabet Vasa of Sweden, Duchess of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch (1549 â 1598), Gustav I Vasaâs daughter\n\nKaterina Stenbock (1535 â 1621), Gustav I Vasaâs third wife\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She is the second longest-reigning Danish monarch after King Christian IV who reigned for 59 years, 330 days, from April 4, 1588 until February 28, 1648. As of January 14, 2022, the only current monarchs who reigned longer than Queen Margrethe II were Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom (reigned since February 6, 1952) and Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan of Brunei (reigned since October 5, 1967). Queen Margrethe II stated several times that she had no intention of abdicating as several other European monarchs had done. She viewed her position as a job for life and recognized Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom as a source of inspiration for her devotion to duty.\n\nIn January 1972, shortly after King Frederik IX of Denmark had given his New Year speech, he became ill with flu-like symptoms. On January 3, 1972, he had a cardiac arrest and was rushed to Copenhagen Municipal Hospital. The king improved for a time but then took a turn for the worse, and on January 14, 1972, King Frederik IX died at the age of 72. His eldest daughter succeeded him as Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. She became the first female monarch in Denmark since Margrethe I, Queen of Denmark (reigned 1387 â 1412), Norway (reigned 1388 â 1412), and Sweden (reigned 1389 â 1412).\n\nMargrethe and her family in 1956: left to right Princess Benedikte, Princess Anne-Marie, Queen Ingrid, Princess Margrethe, and King Frederik IX\n\nIn 1947, King Frederik IX succeeded to the Danish throne upon the death of his father King Christian X. At that time, women were excluded from the line of succession. Having only three daughters, and unlikely that there would be more children, King Frederik IXâs heir presumptive was his younger brother Prince Knud. Frederik soon began to work toward changing the succession laws in Denmark. Finally, in 1953, a new Act of Succession was passed, changing the succession to male-preference cognatic primogeniture â meaning that sons would come before daughters. (A 2009 succession law now allows for the succession of the firstborn child regardless of gender.) The 1953 Act of Succession meant that in the absence of a son, King Frederik IXâs daughters could succeed to the throne, and Frederikâs eldest daughter Margrethe became the heiress-presumptive. Her uncle Prince Knud, who had held the title of Hereditary Prince of Denmark, was not very happy with the new laws, as he and his two sons were now pushed further down the line. In somewhat of a consolation, Knud was given the title Hereditary Prince Knud even though he was no longer the direct heir to the throne. However, Margrethe, as heiress-presumptive, was never given the title of Crown Princess.\n\nOn January 15, 1972, in keeping with tradition, Margrethe was formally proclaimed Queen of Denmark by Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag from the balcony at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. To the crowds gathered below, she gave a brief speech: âMy beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.â After being joined briefly on the balcony by her husband Prince Henrik, the couple traveled back to Amalienborg where they again appeared on the balcony, this time with their two young sons, three-and-a-half-year-old Crown Prince Frederik and two-and-a-half-year-old Prince Joachim.\n\nQueen Margrethe II with her husband Prince Henrik and their sons Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim on the balcony at Amalienborg on January 15, 1972\n\n*********************\n\nThe first official photograph of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, 1972\n\nDue to COVID-19, a number of the events that had been scheduled in mid-January 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary were rescheduled for September 2022. These include a celebration at the Copenhagen City Hall, a command performance at the Royal Danish Theatreâs Old Stage, a celebratory church service in Copenhagen Cathedral, and a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace.\n\nQueen Margretheâs youngest sister Queen Anne-Marie of Greece was unable to participate in the limited number of events on January 14, 2022. Her husband former King Constantine II of Greece was ill with COVID-19 and because she had been exposed to COVID-19, Anne-Marie was not allowed to travel to Denmark.\n\nThe program for January 14, 2022 was as follows.\n\n9:30 AM â Queen Margrethe II began the day with a Council of State at Christiansborg Palace together with her son Crown Prince Frederik\n\n10:00 AM â Queen Margrethe II, her son Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Crown Princess Mary, her son Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie, and her sister Princess Benedikte attended the Danish Parliamentâs official celebration of the anniversary of Her Majestyâs accession to the throne.\n\n12:00 PM â Queen Margrethe II, her son Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Crown Princess Mary, her son Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie, and her sister Princess Benedikte participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at King Frederik IX and Queen Ingridâs grave outside Roskilde Cathedral.\n\nFor more information see:\n\nDanish Royal House: The 50-year anniversary of HM The Queenâs accession to the throne\n\nDanish Royal House: The 50th anniversary of Her Majesty The Queenâs accession to the throne (adjusted schedule)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Queen Margrethe II and Henri Laborde de Monpezat\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Ancestors of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nUnofficial Royalty: First Cousins of Queen Margrethe II\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
