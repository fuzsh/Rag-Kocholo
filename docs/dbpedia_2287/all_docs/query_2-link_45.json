        "text": "The summer is often a time for reflection and recharging. It is easy to end up in mindless, time-filling activities that do not really add anything to our lives. With this post, my intent is to challenge you, dear reader, as well as myself to use part of the time to reflect on our lives and decide if you are squeezing the most out of it. And, if not, what you are going to do about it. In the end, life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it. Have a great summer! https://lnkd.in/d9rRTKat This blog will be back in the middle of August.\n\nDo you ever feel like you’re just going through the motions, taking care of everyone else’s needs before your own? You're not alone. It’s easy to feel stuck, to lose sight of what *you* really want when you’re constantly in service mode. That's why I'm so excited about the Second Sisterhood Retreat. We're setting up shop in Puerto Morelos, positioned perfectly between Playa del Carmen and Cancun on the stunning Caribbean Sea. But this isn't just a getaway; it's a deep dive into self-discovery. We all have parts of ourselves we hide—maybe you've stashed away your ambition because you're afraid it’s “too much,” or you mute your own needs because asking for what you want feels selfish. But here's the kicker: These hidden aspects, the ones we judge and try to \"fix,\" they also house our untapped potential and power. This retreat offers a week of clarity and freedom from your inner critic—the one who tells you that you shouldn't be a certain way, that you should play it small. You’ll leave with a newfound peace with all parts of yourself, especially the ones you've been hiding or judging. Mark your calendar: April 7-14, 2024. This retreat is about you, the *whole* you, discovering what you want and knocking down the barriers that have held you back. Want to know more?
