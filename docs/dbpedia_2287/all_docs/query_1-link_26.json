A building that has been transformed several times in the course of centuries. History is not revealed in all the details, but it can’t be washed away either. The different layers and characteristics of the many periods of time are easily recognized. A rich history that Maartje Jaquet cherishes.\n\nHer collection is broad and has a wealth of all kinds of storylines. There are works by Maarten Ploeg, Peter Klashorst and Moritz Ebinger. She presents her collection, in a generous way. Works that are related to each other, sometimes a strange piece of plastic, a casual gift, a found object or her own work. Works by American artists Vivienne Strauss, Chris Baker, Shelley Savor (from Canada) and Calvin Seibert, the latter with a surprisingly multifaceted oeuvre.\n\nMaartje Jaquet is also known for her versatility: she draws, paints, photographs, films, makes music and writes poetry. And she makes striking collages where an old image is revived and given a new meaning. Just like her house the story was still unfinished. This reflects on her personal art collection that consists of found objects, works by others and her own work. On her studio walls you see all kinds of frame narratives, opening into new windows, like in the stories of Sherazade. Her found objects are tangible reminders of what she, as a photographer and video artist, shows to the viewer in an unadorned way: everyday things become extraordinary when you look at them in a different way. The stories on her walls are a visual diary, they talk about the source of a work of art which lead to new creations or to the purchase of a new piece which then weaves into the collection to form a new story line. Thus, the creators of the works of art and the collection itself are incorporated into one big family.\n\nEach part of the collection can be seen as a beloved member of the family.\n\nOne can not do without them.\n\nMarch 2015\n\nHarald Schole\n\nWith the following artists:\n\nAnna Antonova, Chris Baker, Alison Bass, Marcel van den Berg, Marian Bijlenga, Jaap Blonk, Turi Braaksma – van Heerikhuizen, Susanne Breuss, Maarten Brinkman, Anja Brunt, Patricia van de Camp, Carlomaria, Colombel, Luísa Cortesão, Cathy Cullis, Eddie D., Rins Dekker, Moritz Ebinger, Cozue Endoh, Fitacola, Melle Hammer, Kirsten Haugaard, Femke van Heerikhuizen, Roza Horowitz, Jos Houweling, Gertie Jaquet, Maartje Jaquet, Jelle Kampen, Josephine, Kinska, Rinaldo Klas, Peter Klashorst, Jean Bernard Koeman, Dana Komjaty, Judith Koning, Nicholas Laughlin, Yara van Loghem, Miriskum, Najim Molenaar, Frenk der Nederlanden, Tomio Nitto, Ann O’Neal García, powerpaola, Angelica Paez, Goran Patljech, Anita Philipsen, Maarten Ploeg, Oscar van der Ploeg, Rogier van der Ploeg, Marcel Prins, Sabine Remy, Chrystl Rijkeboer, Brigitta Ruven, Lucy Sarneel, Shelley Savor, Herman Schouwenburg, Calvin Seibert, James Otto Seibold, Ines Seidel, Noel Sies, Myriam Simons,Martijn Smit, Sandra Soss, Birgit Speulman, Straatjutter (Krista Peters), Vivienne Strauss, Su Tomesen, Giotta Tajiri, Ryu Tajiri, Keiko Tsuji, Moniek van de Vall, Joke van Vlijmen, Moniek Voulon, Arnold Weel, Jim van der Woude, Yano, Marieke Zeeman.\n\n\"The place of John's burial in the southern aisle of the cathedral choir in front of the Vlašimská chapel was marked by a stone plaque with his name in the pavement.

According to the testimony of the Žitavska Chronicle, a lattice was placed around it from the middle of the 15th century. Another lattice was set up by St. Vitus dean Václav of Wolfenburg in 1530. Analysts record further modifications in 1595, 1621 and 1679, when Archbishop Jan Bedřich of Valdštejn held a service in front of the altar. An engraving from 1712 depicts an altar table with a coffin and a tabernacle. Promotional engravings of the canonization from 1729 show the state of the decoration to date.\n\nCountess Kinská, born in Fünfkirch († 1729), initiated the construction of the new Prague tombstone. Her financial donation was combined with a long-term public canonization collection, which ended up with a surplus. The mediators of the realization of the magnificent silver monument were Cardinal Bedřich of Althan and Privy Councilor Gundakar of Althan, with the support of Emperor Karl VI. the choice fell on a court artist: based on a sketch by Josef Emanuel Fischer from Erlach from 1733, the Italian sculptor Antonio Corradini created a wooden model of the figure of the saint kneeling on a sarcophagus between two angels, which, after approval by the emperor, he converted to a monumental scale in 1735. In the years 1735–1736, the Viennese silversmith Johann Joseph Würth cast and hammered the wooden hoods into silver with five journeymen, including Raffael Donner and Kašpar Gschwandtner. The silver mausoleum of John of Nepomuk was then assembled on the site of the former grave and altar in the choir of the St. Vitus Cathedral. The sculptures of flying angels date from 1771, the canopy for the mausoleum was ordered by Empress Maria Theresa. The marble balustrade was ordered by the Prague bishop Zdeněk Jiřík Chřepický from Modlíškovice in 1746. The six female figures on the corners – allegories of the Christian virtues – according to the models of the sculptor Platzer, were supplied by the Prague silversmith Jiří Vilém Seitz only in 1749.\n\nThe Metropolitan Cathedral of Saints Vitus, Wenceslaus and Adalbert (Czech: metropolitní katedrála svatého Víta, Václava a Vojtěcha) is a Catholic metropolitan cathedral in Prague, and the seat of the Archbishop of Prague.
