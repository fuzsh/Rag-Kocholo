        "text": "American, 20th century.\n\nBorn 1914, Memphis, Tennessee; died 2005, Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nHawkins Bolden was born September 10, 1914, in the Bailey’s Bottom section of Memphis, Tennessee. According to his late sister Elizabeth Williams, “Daddy was a Creole man from Middleton, Tennessee; Mama was an Indian lady from Alabama. Her daddy came as a slave from Africa and married this Indian lady after he was set free. Daddy and Mama had relatives from down in Georgia who talked Geechee (an African American dialect spoken along the Atlantic coast).”\n\nAs a child, Hawkins was always playing baseball in the streets or in vacant lots scattered throughout Memphis’ rows of small wooden shacks. One day, with Hawkins catching and brother Monroe at bat, a pitch was thrown high and outside, and catcher Hawkins, crouching, assuming Monroe would not swing, stood up to receive it. But Monroe did swing, and the bat missed the pitch and connected with Hawkins Bolden’s head. Soon after, Hawkins began to suffer seizures. One day, when Hawkins was eight, he collapsed to the ground, landed on his back, and stared up at the sun. He never saw again. “I couldn’t stop looking at the sun,” he says. “I just looked and my eyes went dark. I never did see nothing after that. I can feel things. I know the sunshine. I can feel the heat.”\n\nIn 1930, sixteen-year-old Hawkins moved to a small house in midtown Memphis with his family, where he remained until his death in 2005. Bolden must have sensed the gradual changes taking place around him, as his quiet residential neighborhood was incorporated into the Memphis’ downtown commercial center.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Bolden’s backyard was filled with totem-like figures lining his fence and sprouting in his garden. “I started making faces and things out of stuff I found, probably about 1965. One of my nieces said, ‘Put them in your garden to keep the birds out.’ So I guess you can call them things scarecrows.” Bolden’s art is made of whatever littered the Memphis streets and alleyways: plastic milk bottles, tin cans, hubcaps, automobile license plates, wagons, chairs, extension cords, radio wire, teapots, saucepans, and toys. Most of his works are representational, depicting human faces and bodies. Some may be self-portraits. “I use shoe soles and hose pipes and carpet pieces to make tongues,” he says. If there is any color or written inscription on an object, it is totally coincidental: “Sometimes I feel words on something, but I don’t know what it is. I don’t ask nobody about it or about color, neither. I don’t worry about color. I know when I can make something by how it feels.”\n\nA visitor once asked Bolden what he has in mind when he makes a piece for the yard, suggesting that surely he has a reason for doing all this. “Yes sir, I do!” He says emphatically. “The birds be thinking something going to get them. They get scared. They stay away.”\n\n- Phillip March Jones\n\nSelected Exhibitions\n\n2019, In The Hot Seat, KMAC, Louisville\n\n2019, Souls Grown Deep: Artists of the African American South, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia\n\n2016, A Cut Above: Wood Sculpture from the Gordon W.
