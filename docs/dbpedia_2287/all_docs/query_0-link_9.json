        "text": "The Wedding of Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein (eldest son of Prince Johann of Liechtenstein and Princess Clothilde of Thurn und Taxis) and Princess Marie d’Orléans (eldest daughter of Prince Henri, Count of Paris and Duchess Marie Thérèse of Württemberg, wearing the Bulgarian Fringe Tiara) at Schloss Friedrichshafen on this day in 1989. While the news of the wedding initially eased strained family relations, the decision of Princess Marie to have her wedding at the Württemberg summer home rather than the traditional Orléans Chapelle royale de Dreux angered her father and grandfather, the Count of Paris, and the decision to have the Civil Wedding at Dreux failed to appease them. The Countess of Paris (grandmother), The Duchess of Württemberg (paternal and maternal aunt of the bride), and the Duke of Orléans (uncle) were the only members of the Orléans family in attendance. Prince Gundakar and Princess Marie have five children.\n\nRelated"
