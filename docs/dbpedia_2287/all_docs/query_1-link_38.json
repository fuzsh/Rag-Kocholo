They always keep me from undertaking important things.\" Constantly frustrated by slow progress on his portraits, the paintings he called his \"big enemies,\" Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780— 1867) pretended to prefer to paint grand public decorations and huge altarpieces. But there was rarely a moment in his career when he did not have a portrait on his easel and another in the works. The demand for these portraits was unend- ing, a reflection of the immense value placed on them. By the end of Ingres's career, they were rightly considered to be his immortal work, his legacy. One critic neatly tied them to the artist's genre of choice, epic history painting: \"Ingres's portraits, worthy to be displayed next to those of the greatest masters, should be considered true history paintings: they are at once individuals and types.\" Charles Baudelaire considered them to be \"true portraits, that is . . . the ideal reconstruction of the individuals.\" As perfected reconstructions, Ingres's portraits are indeed an ideal reflection of his period, the true image of an epoch as it wished to be remembered. Spanning six decades — the last years of the Revolution, the Napoleonic Empire, the Bourbon Restoration, the July Monarchy, the Second Republic, and the Second Empire — Ingres's gallery of portraits constitutes a Who's Who of the ruling elite in France, the aristocracy of birth, beauty, politics, wealth, and intellect. With 42 paintings, loi independent drawings, and 22 studies, this exhibition — the first in Great Britain or the United States to be devoted to Ingres's portraits — is the most extensive of its kind in 132 years. Not since the memorial exhibition organized at the Ecole des Beaux- Arts, Paris, in 1867 have so many of the artist's portraits, painted and drawn, been brought together. For its remarkable size and scope, we are indebted to a host of generous private collectors, museum directors, and curators across Europe and America. Rarely have so many possessors so willingly parted with their greatest masterpieces in order to enjoy the delights of such a grand reunion. On the behalf of the fortunate visitors to the exhibition, we express our thanks. We congratulate the curators — Philip Conisbee, Christopher Riopelle, and Gary Tinterow — for their success in assembling the exhibition. For their informa- tive texts, we thank the many contributors to this cata- logue, which has been produced with the support of the Doris Duke Fund for Publications. The exhibition is sup- ported in Washington by Airbus Industrie. In New York the exhibition is supported by The Florence Gould Foundation. Finally, it is our pleasure to recognize the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities for grant- ing U.S. Government Indemnity and the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport for granting British Govern- ment Indemnity. Neil MacGregor Philippe de Montebello Earl A. Powell III ix ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First and foremost we thank the directors of our three museums — Neil MacGregor, PhiHppe de Montebello, and Earl A. Powell III — for their enthusiastic support of the exhibition. We are extremely grateful for their assistance, encouragement, and many important contributions to the project. No exhibition of Ingres's work could succeed without the cooperation of the great repositories of his art in France, and we are profoundly grateful to our colleagues there for their generous and enthusiastic contributions to the success of our endeavor. In Paris, at the Reunion des Musees Nationaux, we thank the director, Fran^oise Cachin, and Irene Bizot. At the Musee du Louvre, Paris, we thank the director, Pierre Rosenberg; in the Departement des Peintures, Jean-Pierre Cuzin, Sylvain Laveissiere, Olivier Meslay, and Anne Roquebert; in the Departement des Arts Graphiques, Frangoise Viatte, Arlette Serullaz, and Jean-Fran9ois Mejanes. At the Musee Ingres in Mon- tauban, Georges Vigne welcomed our project with open arms; in addition to handsome loans, he contributed an important essay to this catalogue and served at all times as a key source of information on Ingres's work and life. Throughout Europe and America, curators and col- lectors consented to lend their most cherished master- pieces or to share valuable information on the location of works by Ingres. In addition to the people and institu- tions named in the list of lenders, we extend our thanks to the following for their contributions to the project: Christina Acidini, Clifford Ackley, Pierre Arrizoli- Clementel, Jean Aubert, Joseph Baillio, Valerie Bajou, Sylvan Barnet, Isabelle Battez, Pierre Berge, Maria van Berge-Gerbaud, Danny Berger, Andre Bromberg, Dorine Cardyn-Oomen, Victor I.

V. Thaw, Margit and Rolf Weinberg, Jon Whiteley, Guy Wildenstein, Marc F. Wilson, and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman. We are indebted to Dr. Hans Naef, the doyen of Ingres scholars, for graciously allowing us to reproduce his texts on the artist's portrait drawings, since these essays remain the essential source for all studies of Ingres's portraiture. Mrs. Marianne Feilchenfeldt made an enormous contribution to the catalogue by reviewing with Dr. Naef the translations of his texts. These were prepared, with wit and grace, by Russell Stockman. We also thank Walter and Maria Feilchenfeldt for their many kindnesses. Many other \"Ingristes\" welcomed the project and shared with us their extensive knowledge. Robert Rosenblum contributed the insightful introduction. Pierre Rosenberg and Louis-Antoine Prat very kindly opened their Ingres archives to us and made a number of pertinent suggestions. Eric Bertin devoted countless hours to the task of correcting various portions of the cata- logue manuscript and provided a number of little-known exhibition and bibliographic references. Daniel Ternois furnished an index to his forthcoming edition of Ingres's letters to Charles Marcotte and answered a number of specific queries. Sylvie Aubenas gave access to the vast iconographic resources of the Bibliotheque Nationale de France. Paula Warrick and Andrew Shelton graciously shared their research materials with the organizers, and the latter kindly reviewed several texts. Jeff Van Gool, Librar- ian at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp, generously transcribed previously unpublished letters written by Ingres. Robert McDonald Parker pro- duced, as usual — and as if by magic — all sorts of unpub- lished and obscure documents and acted as the project's ambassador in Paris. We thank everyone most heartily. At the National Gallery, London, we thank Michael Wilson, who steered the project through every stage of its development, tirelessly assisted by Mary Hersov, Joanna Kent, and Anne Starkey. Rosalie Cass arranged numerous complicated loans with the help of Sarah Frances and Chloe Dodwell. We also thank conservators Martin Wyld and David Bomford and curators David Jaffe and Nicholas Penny. Humphrey Wine kept a careful eye on the project during the period when the National Gallery was without a curator of nineteenth-century paintings. Elspeth Hector helped ease all research in the library. Kathy Adler and Mari Griffith offered thoughtful insights throughout. John England and Isabella Kocum restored the beautiful frame for Madame Moitessier Seated. John Leighton, former curator at the National Gallery and present director of the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, launched the exhibition in London. Christopher Riopelle wishes to thank Christopher Brown, formerly of London and now director of the Ash- molean Museum, Oxford, for his advice and encourage- ment from both cities. He also wishes to thank Colin B. Bailey, Philippe Bordes, Ann Dumas, John Goodman, Katherine Crawford Luber, Joseph J. Rishel, Carl Bran- don Strehlke, and Caroline Riopelle for long, lively, and helpful discussions of Ingres problems. At the National Gallery of Art, we thank D. Dodge Thompson, Naomi Remes, and Jonathan Walz, Exhibi- tions; Mark Leithauser, Gordon Anson, William R. Bowser, Donna J. Kwerderis, and Barbara Keyes, Design and Installation; Sally Freitag and Hunter Hollis, Office of the Registrar; Andrew C. Robison and Margaret Morgan Grasselli, Old Master Drawings; David Bull and Sarah Fisher, Painting Conservation; Judith Walsh, Paper Conservation; Stephanie Belt, Loans Department; Neal Turtell and his Library staff, Frances P. Smyth, Editor's Office; Ira Bartfield and Sara Sanders-Buell, Imaging and Visual Services; Ann Leven, Office of the Treasurer; Nancy R. Breuer, Office of the Secretary— General Coun- sel; and Sandy Masur, Corporate Relations. Philip Conisbee would like to offer special thanks to his present and former curatorial colleagues Lisa Bot- tomly and Florence E. Coman for their bibliography and research; to Margaret Morgan Grasselli, Kimberly Jones, and Nancy Yeide for their catalogue entries; to Kate Haw and Ana Maria Zavala for their administrative zeal; to Professor Lorenz Eitner for making available his draft catalogue entries on the National Gallery's portraits by Ingres; to Eileen Ribeiro for her advice on costume; to Chiara Stefani for her research in Rome; and to Faya Causey for her usual support of many kinds. This handsome catalogue was produced at The Metro- politan Museum of Art. We thank John P. O'Neill for devoting his considerable resources to the project and Ann Lucke for shepherding the complicated manuscript from draft through proofed text. Margaret Donovan and Ellyn Allison edited the manuscript with exemplary insight, tact, and skill. We are especially grateful to them for their many indulgences and numerous improvements. Cynthia Clark and Kathleen Howard provided expert editorial assistance with captions and catalogue entries. Jayne Kuchna and Jean Wagner shaped the unwieldy lists of references and bibliography into a thing of beauty. Robert Weisberg supervised the typesetting with meticulous care and patience. Hsiao-ning Tu skillfully expedited the production schedule and supervised the scanning of images, many of which were ordered by Linda Hirschmann. Bruce Campbell provided the elegant design, and Gwen Roginsky supervised the color repro- duction, printing, and binding. At the Metropolitan Museum, we wish to thank for their generous collaboration the curators who provided loans from their departments — Everett Fahy, George Goldner, Colta Ives, and Laurence Kanter. We also thank Charlotte Hale, Dorothy Mahon, Marjorie Shelley, and Hubert von Sonnenberg for their insights and help regarding conservation. Nina Maruca skillfully made transportation arrangements. Daniel Kershaw and Sophia Geronimus designed the installation and graphics for the exhibition. Diana Kaplan and Carol Lekarew provided assistance in the Photograph and Slide Library. We thank Emily Rafferty and the Development Office for their efforts to secure funding. As always, Linda Sylling admin- istered the budget with skill and charm. Mahrukh Tarapor provided much-needed advice and assistance. Gary Tinterow wishes to extend his deepest thanks to Rebecca A. Rabinow for administering the exhibition with grace and accuracy and for contributing the excellent chronology to the catalogue. Both exhibition and cata- logue have benefited from her intelligent and attentive eye. He also thanks Olaiya Land and Gabriella de la Rosa for their careful and exhaustive research and Kathryn Calley Galitz for her remarkable synthesis of huge amounts of material into cogent notes. In addition, she updated information for all of Dr. Naef's catalogue entries. In the Department of European Paintings, Susan A. Stein, Dorothy Kehett, Samantha Sizemore, Julie Steiner, Eleanor Hyun, Andy Caputo, Gary Kopp, Theresa King- Dickinson, and John McKanna all contributed in impor- tant ways. Sylvain Bellenger, Guy Boyer, Jean-Loup Champion, and Tony Smith are warmly thanked for their research assistance and friendship and James F. Joseph for his patient support and companionship. Philip Conisbee Christopher Riopelle Gary Tinterow ACKNOWLEDGMENTS xi NOTE TO THE READER All works illustrated in this book are by J.-A.-D. Ingres unless otherwise stated. The first six chapters following the introduction offer a chronological overview of Ingres's portraiture. At the end of each chapter are the corresponding catalogue entries arranged in two chronological sections, the paintings preceding the independent drawings. The last two chapters discuss, respec- tively, the critical reception of Ingres's work during his life- time and his collaborations with his students and other artists. The dates given for works in this exhibition were assigned by the authors of the catalogue entries. In most cases, they also compiled the provenances, exhibition histories, and reference lists for the catalogued works. Additional information provided by Eric Bertin is indicated by his initials in brackets: [eb]. Information about mediums, dimensions, and inscriptions was supplied by the owners of the works. The paper on which drawings were made is white unless otherwise noted. Dimen- sions are given with height preceding width. Measurements are given in centimeters and to the nearest eighth of an inch. Unless otherwise indicated, catalogued works will be exhibited at all three venues: London, Washington, and New York. The letter \"W\" refers to Georges Wildenstein's Ingres, a catalogue raisonne of the artist's paintings published in 1954. Similarly, the letter \"N\" refers to Hans Naef's Die Bil- dungsv^eichnungen von J.-A.-D. Ingres, a catalogue raisonne of Ingres's portrait drawings pubUshed in 1977-80. Works by Ingres mentioned but not illustrated in this catalogue are identified by their Wildenstein or Naef number; if the work is in a public collection, that information is given as well. Bibliographical references are cited in abbreviated form in the catalogue entries and in the chapter notes. The corre- sponding full citations will be found in the bibliography that begins on page 557. Catalogue entries are signed with the author's initials, which are listed in the following key: p . c .

Nancy Yeide xii Portraits by Ingres IMAGE OF AN EPOCH INGRES'S PORTRAITS AND THEIR MUSES Robert Rosenblum Toward the end of a century in which the most revolutionary art attempted to annihilate vis- ible, earthbound realities and waft us to more exalted, imaginary domains, it may come as a shock to realize that the venerable traditions of portrai- ture are once again alive and well. While the conquests of modernism temporarily buried artists' recurrent fascina- tion with the unique data that add up to a particular per- son, the late twentieth century has witnessed infinite legions of singular people — formerly threatened by Machine Age uniformity and the iconoclasm of abstract art — begging to be scrutinized once more. Wherever we look in the last decades, particular faces keep turning up, whether in the paparazzi portraiture of Andy Warhol, the private worlds of Gilbert & George, the disarmingly magnified mug shots of Thomas Ruff and Chuck Close, or the self-portrait disguises of Cindy Sherman and Yasumasa Morimura. And, as usual, the concerns of new art change the way we look at old art. Amazingly, we had to wait until 1996 for eight decades of Picasso's art to be surveyed for the first time as the work of an important portraitist,' much as other recent exhibitions have turned to older masters such as Degas and Renoir^ in order to focus exclusively on their achievement as interpreters of specific people. In this recent rearrangement of subject priorities, many artists once neglected by modernism have taken on unexpected allure, so that, for instance, the cosmopolitan territory of high-society portraiture circa 1900 — the world of Sargent, Boldini, Zorn, Blanche^ — has begun to take shape as an important chapter in the history of art. As for Ingres, however, his achievement as a por- traitist hardly needed to be rediscovered. Both in his paintings and drawings, the scrupulous depiction of his contemporaries — whether family, friends, wealthy patrons, or sitters as famous as Napoleon and Cherubini — had always formed a major category of his work that demanded equal time with his intellectually more ambi- tious paintings. Given Ingres's own position as guardian of the academic faith that put the depiction of mere con- Opposite: Fig. I. Detail oi Madame Moitessier Seated (cat. no. 134) temporary mortals on a far lower level of subjects than, say, the idealized recreation of Jupiter or the Virgin, pos- terity's clear preference for his portraiture over his his- tory painting would presumably have made the master turn in his grave. Yet, like his own teacher David, Ingres never stopped making portraits, mirroring through his sitters the rapidly changing fashions, decor, and person- alities of two-thirds of the nineteenth century, from 1800 to 1867, the year of his death. Moreover, like David, he gave his portraits almost as much prominence in the official displays of his work as he did his narratives from mythology, the Bible, or history; they usually figured in the Paris Salons, where he exhibited regularly from 1802 to 1834, as well as in later group shows or one-man exhi- bitions that took place outside the Salon. Most telling was what was shown at Ingres's official apotheosis, a major retrospective of sixty-nine\"^ paintings held in 1855 on the occasion of the Exposition Univer- selle. Though he often grumbled about wasting his time on something as lowly as portraiture — after being cajoled back to earth by the entreaties of the rich and the famous, the high and the mighty, when he should have remained in the company of Homer and the Virgin — he apparently had no objections at all to mixing together with his most ambitious history paintings more than a dozen portraits of his contemporaries. And this number would total more than forty if one expanded the definition of his portraiture to include a state portrait and an allegory of Napoleon I, a Neo-Roman profile bust of Prince Napoleon, two scenes of Pope Pius VII holding services in the Sis- tine Chapel, and a group of Neo-Gothic portraits of members of Louis-Philippe's family masquerading as their namesake Christian saints in the guise of cartoons for stained-glass windows. Installation shots of the 1855 retrospective (figs. 2, 3) show clearly how Ingres's portraits were integrated into the totality of his work rather than being relegated to a different part of the display; they also demonstrate with equal clarity the continually shifting proportions of the facts of portraiture and the fictions of ideal art that he Fig. 2. View of the Ingres installation at the Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1855 often juggled to blur the distinction between these two realms. Even looking at the most famous symbol of Ingres' s academic orthodoxy, The Apotheosis of Homer (fig. 4), which had originally been designed as a ceiling painting for the Louvre but had been moved for the retro- spective from these mythological heavens to a vertical wall much closer to earth, we begin to realize that it, too, is a portrait gallery. Looked at this way, the painting, with its ritualized veneration of eternal classical values, is hardly so incompatible with the portraits of two of Ingres's illustrious contemporaries that were hung directly below Paris, 1855 PORTRAITS BY INGRES it, on either side of The Virgin with the Host: those of Comte Mathieu Mole (fig. 158), a prime minister under Louis-Philippe, and Comtesse Louise d'Haussonville (cat. no. 125), a distinguished woman of letters (and grand- daughter of Madame de Stael). The attention Ingres has given to the details of his sitters' clothing and hairstyles, for instance, also belongs to the same vision with which he reincarnated the cultural titans of a more recent past — Shakespeare, Poussin, Moliere, Gluck, et al. — whose appearances he could reconstruct from historical data copied from portraits made by their own contemporaries. For want of such information, the features of most of the classical men (and one woman, Sappho) in the upper ranks tend to be generically antique. Moreover, cropping these relative newcomers to the classical Hall of Fame at the waist makes them appear to be rising from the gravity- bound domain of the real world below the frame, just beginning their arduous, stepwise ascent to the most ideal- ized heights of classical perfection. In the 1855 installation, that real world is firmly anchored in Ingres's sharp-eyed depictions of sitters culled from the history of his own lifespan: the First Empire, the Bourbon Restoration, the July Monarchy, and the Second Empire. Yet these nineteenth-century men and women could also be transported by him to a realm of ethereal purity, where the classical gods reside forever. Napoleon, for instance, was presented by Ingres at the 1855 retrospective as both the most palpable of mortals and the most airborne of deities. In a painting of i8o4 (cat. no. 2), the thirty-five-year-old emperor-to-be is shown as he appeared in Liege on August i, 1803, wearing a consular uniform rendered with such precision of red velvet and gilded ornament that we feel it could almost be lifted right out of the painting and placed on a mannequin in a museum vitrine. But in another, posthu- mous vision of Napoleon I (fig. 5), commissioned in 1853 as a ceiling decoration for the salon of the new emperor, Napoleon III, at the Hotel de Ville, the ancestral emperor has soared even higher than the empyrean of Homer. Now presented in a state of ideal nudity like an antique god or warrior, Napoleon I, accompanied by a wreath- bearing allegory of Fame, is borne to the Temple of Immortality in a golden quadriga, while on the horizon below, a mountainous view of the exiled Napoleon's final residence. Saint Helena, is left behind, an earthbound memory of nineteenth-century historical fact.^ But even in his portraits of people less susceptible to mythmaking than Napoleon, Ingres would often attempt to cross the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the demands of portrait likeness and the Olympian heights of the academic tradition. In doing so, he was reviving the situation confronted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who, from the 1 760s on, often adjusted the empirical requirements of painting recognizable portraits of friends and aristocratic patrons to his own idealistic dream that Britain might at last absorb the abstract beauty of form and myth that was the legacy of Greco-Roman and Continental art. Working against the nineteenth century's ever-increasing demand for pictorial truths that were visible, specific, and mate- rial, Ingres tried in countless ways to elevate his portraits to more exalted planes than mere mirror images. At times, he would openly quote a broad span of art-historical sources that could cover antiquity and the Middle Ages as well as such old-master paragons as Raphael, Holbein, Bronzino, and Poussin. Elsewhere, he would juxtapose perceived facts with allegorical fictions. And often, he would subtly adjust the posture and expression of his sit- ter, so that they might evoke the mythic aura of an ideal personage culled from classical or Christian imagery. So it was that hanging beneath The Apotheosis of Napoleon at the 1855 retrospective were three portraits that may well represent the range of Ingres's varying mixtures of the extremities of modern facts and inherited fictions. In the middle hung a portrait of a patron of the arts and one of the primary organizers of the Exposition Uni- verselle. Prince Napoleon (fig. 6). Its placement directly under the apotheosis of the prince's uncle Napoleon I, as well as its repetition of the round format of the lofty alle- gory, helped to mythologize the newest political branch of the Bonaparte family tree — an allusion further under- lined by the transformation of the image of the thirty- three-year-old sitter into a Roman profile portrait bust in trompe I'oeil relief, as if the new prince had assumed the attributes of a Roman ruler. It was the kind of historical disguise that harked all the way back to one of Ingres's ear- liest portrait drawings, that of the French actor Brochard in the costume of a helmeted Roman (cat. no. 16), also ingres's portraits and their muses 5 Fig. 5.

Fig. 6. Napoleon-Joseph-Charles-Paul Bonaparte, called Prince Napoleon, 1855 (W 277). Destroyed Flanking the bust of Prince Napoleon were two por- traits of other famous contemporaries that descended to the most empirical world of photographic truth. \"Photo- graphic\" may be an anachronism in the case of the por- trait of the businessman and journalist Louis-Frangois Bertin (cat. no. 99), first shown at the Salon of 1833, since the invention of photography was not officially declared until 1839. But Ingres, like Delaroche, Horace Vernet, and other painters working at the same time as the pio- neer photographers, Niepce and Daguerre, often seemed to share their positivist goals of capturing absolute visual truth. Moreover, Ingres's own master, David, had already pointed the way to Monsieur Benin. Some of his male portraits — that of Cooper Penrose (1802; San Diego Museum of Art) and, above all, that of his friend and fellow political exile in Brussels, Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyes (fig. 7) — prefigure Ingres's masterful deception of offering nothing but unedited visual facts. And they also employ the monochromatic tonalities that foreshadow the sepia tints so conspicuous in Monsieur Bertin and in early photography. In the portrait of Sieyes, David, though as much a propagandist for classical idealism as Ingres, nevertheless makes us marvel at the rendering of the glints of light that touch the chair arm and the tobacco box and at the painstaking record of every wayward curl of the sitter's closely cropped auburn hair. This hyper- realist vision is pushed further in Ingres's depiction of Bertin, as if we were observing the sitter and his setting with a still more powerful magnifying glass. Now the touches of light on the chair arm and, still more diminu- tive, on the watch fob contain reflections of a mullioned window; and the myriad locks of disheveled hair, along with the wrinkles and creases of flesh and clothing, appear to have reached an even greater infinity of detail. Moreover, the head-on impact of Sieyes — an almost pal- pable presence who stares directly at the spectator — is, if anything, further intensified: Bertin' s overwhelming bulk and scrutinizing gaze can instantly humble the viewer. Ingres's mimetic genius reaches its fullest statement here. Not only does he create a daguerreotype avant la lettre, but he also offers to late-twentieth-century eyes an unex- pected ancestry for the quasi-photographic, confronta- tional portraiture of Alfred Leslie and Chuck Close. Yet Ingres's illusion of unmediated reality (for which there were, after all, as many preparatory drawings as there were for most of his ideal figures [see cat. nos. loo, loi, figs. 178, 179]) could also echo backward through the corridors of art history. One critic in 1833 was reminded of the obsessively realist portraits of wrinkled old men 6 PORTRAITS BY INGRES and women that had made the modest fame of the Ger- man painter Balthasar Denner (1685-1749; fig. 294)7 But in our century, a far loftier prototype has been cited — Ingres's Hfelong idol, Raphael,^ who, in his portrait of Leo X (almost as weighty a presence as Bertin), had also included a window reflection on the glistening knob of the papal chair. Apart from locating Ingres's inspiration in such contradictory sources as Denner and Raphael, responses to this seemingly unmitigated record of per- ception could also transform it into a social symbol tran- scending the particular sitter. So it was that in 1855, Theophile Gautier, surely Ingres's most observant, artic- ulate, and tolerant critic, referred to the then-deceased sitter as a \"bourgeois Caesar,\"^ a quip that might have been equally applicable to Prince Napoleon, portrayed nearby. Indeed, for Ingres's contemporaries, as for us, Bertin could quickly move from mere looking-glass truth to a social symbol of the July Monarchy, much as the Comte de Pastoret (cat. no. 98), with its close paraphrase of the refined demeanor of a portrait by Bronzino (fig. 174),'° could become a symbol of the revival of ancien regime aristocracy during the Bourbon Restoration. Paired with Bertin, on the left side of Prince Napoleon, was a portrait of one of the artist's close friends, the re- nowned Florentine composer Luigi Cherubini, who had lived and worked in Paris since 1788 and whose musical and artistic ties with Ingres had already been confirmed in 1826, when his Coronation Mass was performed in the cathedral of Ingres's native city, Montauban, to celebrate the installation of The Vow of Louis XIII. Cherubini' s portrait exists in two versions, which repeat as well as contradict each other. In one, dated 1841 (cat. no. 119), the sitter, then eighty-one years old, seems to belong to the same quasi-photographic domain as Monsieur Bertin — a largely monochromatic ambience in which we can scruti- nize every last wrinkle of the composer's black cape and aging flesh, and every last curl of his white hair and Legion of Honor rosette. Should we choose to look more closely, we can even read the titles on the spines of three of his operatic jcorej- — Medee, AliBaba, Les Deux Journees — propped up behind him on a table. These past achieve- ments move into the present tense with the quill pen and blank music score, on which he will soon jot down the (to us) inaudible sounds that must account for his expression and pose of intense concentration (index finger and hand against temple, as in many daguerreotypes of the 1840s). We seem to be intruders here in the cloistered realm of genius at work, where the sitter is consistently anchored to such material facts as a chair and a table. Fig. 7. Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825). Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyes, 1817. Oil on canvas, 33^// x 28^^ in. (86 x 72 cm). Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts That Ingres could aspire to far more exalted climes is revealed by the other version of the portrait (fig. 8).\"^ One of the first paintings ever to be recorded as a daguerreotype, in late 1841,'^ it was acquired by the king in June 1842, shortly after the composer's death. When this more ambitious version was exhibited at the 1855 retrospective, to the left of Prince Napoleon, it was subti- ded \"portrait historique.\" The use of the word \"historique\" suggests a shift from the empirical world to the eternal realm of history painting — a feat accomplished not only by removing the modern table and chair from Cherubini's study and letting his arm rest on a polychrome, Neo- Pompeian column base, but, more conspicuously, by including behind him the classical personification of Terpsichore, the Muse of Choral Song and Dance, who with one arm cradles her lyre and with the other inspires and protects her human charge. The conceit recalls Reynolds's earlier efforts to lift from earth to heaven such contemporary sitters as the actor David Garrick, who is torn between the Muses of Comedy and Tragedy, and the actress Sarah Siddons, who is raised to Michelangelesque heights as the Tragic Muse. But in Ingres's vision of modern genius and timeless Muse, the ingres's portraits and their muses 7 collision of these separate realms is much harsher, forcing us to seesaw rapidly between sharp-focus truth and classi- cal idealization. It is a clash that is spatial as well as conceptual, for the startlingly abrupt foreshortening of Terpsichore's arm makes her hover, despite her sculpturesque modeling, like a displaced spirit, oddly compressed between the opposing realms of near and far, fact and fiction. Yet her ideal character, underlined by the marble whiteness of her tunic, is also tinged with a surprising reality, as if she were coming to Hfe. The flesh of this Muse is pink, her lips and cheeks red. And as her features take on a specificity, we begin to realize that they in fact belong to a particular person whose portrait Ingres drew in 1841, Clemence de Rayneval, the sister of the French ambassador to Rome (fig. 9).^'* The Muse, then, begins to slip from Olympus down to the realm of contemporary portraiture, and the painting is almost transformed into a double portrait. She can, however, ascend once again to a different sphere of eternity, evoking another recurrent source of inspiration for Ingres, Poussin's Self-Portrait of 1650 (fig. 10). This venerable image of the ancestral deity of French classical painting (whose time-bound features and clothing had already been reincarnated by Ingres on the foreground steps in The Apotheosis of Homer) contains at the left a mysterious female profile, an unexpected presence that has Fig. 8. Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry, 1842 (W 236). Oil on canvas, 41 ^/^ x 37 in. (105. i x 94 cm). Musee du Louvre, Paris been interpreted most persuasively as a personification of the art of painting,^^ a personal muse who, like Cherubini's Terpsichore, could elevate the sitter to a far higher plane. Poussin's muse was to trigger Ingres's imagination in a far more magical way when her image later reappeared as a mirror reflection in the 1856 portrait of Madame Ines Moitessier (fig. i, cat. no. 134). This feminine profile — like Poussin's muse, which might at first be perceived as simply a fragment of a canvas stacked against the walls of the artist's studio — may be read initially as an optical truth that happens to mirror the sitter's own profile at exactly the right angle. Yet the sitter and her reflection swiftly soar far above the laws of optics. For one, Madame Moitessier's pose has been recognized since Ingres's own lifetime as having a Pompeian origin: it is now well known that she is assuming, almost as in a learned charade, the pose of an allegorical figure (usually identified as Arcadia) in a fresco from Herculaneum that was often copied in the nineteenth century. So it is that, for all the material splendor of her setting and costume (her spectacular white silk dress bursting with bouquets of roses was the latest word in Second Empire fashion), Madame Moitessier seems transformed before our eyes into something remote and oracular— a metamorphosis that unfolds still further when we go through the looking glass that covers almost the entire wall behind her. There, the descendant of Poussin's muse presents an even more unapproachable female persona, a filmy vision of ideal beauty and mystery whose eyes, like those of a classical bust, will remain forever open and whose profile, like that on an ancient relief, transports her to the same incorporeal realm in which Ingres, the year before, had located Prince Napoleon. But even in this other- worldly mirror image, we are obliged to return to mid- nineteenth-century reality by the full disclosure of the elaborate lace and ribbons adorning Madame Moitessier's cache-peigne cap. And, back on our side of the mirror, we begin to realize that this motionless sphinx can return to earth as a grande dame seated on a tufted pink damask sofa so palpable that, together with the gilt console and peacock-feathered fan, it might be moved to a period room displaying the conspicuous luxury of Second Empire decorative arts. In this and many other portraits, the contemporary prose of a sitter's features, clothing, and surroundings could merge seamlessly with the poetic extremes of Ingres's ideals of purity of form and nobility of subject, ideals he attempted to isolate in his many icons of classi- cal and religious perfection.

Musee du Louvre, Paris these, the 1854 Virgin with the Host (fig. 11), was hung directly below The Apotheosis of Homer at the 1855 retro- spective, affirming in Christian terms the axis of symme- try so conspicuous in the classical hierarchy above it. This inflexible ideal could even be, adapted to the images of the wealthy and powerful women who managed to coax Ingres into recording them for posterity. In this, Ines Moitessier was twice blessed. Her reincarnation via Poussin and Roman painting as a modern sibyl was pre- ceded, in the 1851 portrait (cat. no. 133), by her transfor- mation into something akin to Ingres's many fearsome images of the Virgin as the celestial epitome of femi- nine power and majesty. Holding her pearl necklace and fan as if they were emblems of regal authority, Madame Moitessier seems to reign from a height that would hum- ble a mortal spectator. Her implacable frontal gaze, fixed forever in the perfect oval of a head crowned by a halo of roses, further coincides with Ingres's fantasies of the Vir- gin's imperious beauty. Yet if Madame Moitessier dou- bles here as Ingres's queen of a Christian heaven, she might also be transported to Olympus as a descendant of David's 1799 portrait of Madame de Verninac (fig. 41), referred to as a \"calm and beautiful Juno.'\"^ Juno and Minerva were, of course, no strangers to Ingres, and they, too, provided ideal molds for his por- traits. In 1854, when he depicted them as part of a series of six decorative medallions of deities for the Paris resi- dence of the architect Jacques-Ignace Hittorff, his friend and occasional collaborator, Juno subtly bore the features of the architect's wife. As for Minerva, she needed only to remove her helmet to reveal her identity with Hittorff's daughter Isabelle (fig. 12).'^ Isabelle was again painted by Ingres, in precisely the same round-medallion format (fig. 13), not later than 1856, the period of Ines Moitessier's deifications.'^ Here, young Isabelle, in her early twenties, is transformed into one of the more bizarre creatures of Ingres's imagination, a head of such fearful symmetry and egg-shaped perfection that it might belong to an alien race. Beneath the unnaturally pure arcs of her eyebrows, which appear to continue uninterrupted into the bridge of her nose, she looks down from an abstract blue Olympus with the haughty, walleyed gaze that so often prevents Ingres's sitters from communicating with mere earthlings. Again we see that, like a modern Pygmalion, Ingres could turn ideal marbles into living beings or, reversing directions, could metamorphose his sitters into divinities. ingres's portraits and their muses In this context, it is telling that one of the most important Ingres discoveries of the last decades was a painting of 1852—53 described by the artist as an \"ebauche pour une Venus, portrait-tableau,\" that is, a study for a painting of Venus that was also a portrait of a woman who, in fact, can be identified as Antonie Balay, a member of a grand family from Lyons (fig. 14)/° These recurrent contacts with Olympian ideals of the human face and body — culled largely from a repertory of painting and sculpture by ancient Romans who them- selves had often recreated their imperial rulers as gods and goddesses — may partially account for the way Ingres's sitters, particularly women, so often transcend recognizable likeness, making us wonder about the pro- portions of modern flesh to ancient marble that fuse miraculously in order to create, for instance, the Comtesse d'Hamsonville (cat. no. 125). Although we may recognize some of the antique sources — statues of Polyhymnia and Pudicity, among others^' — that seem part of the sitter's very being, would we recognize this person herself were she to rise from the dead.^ We are persuaded, how- ever, that we would immediately recognize her dress or the bric-a-brac on her mantelpiece — a guess that was confirmed in 1985 by Edgar Munhall's illuminating study, which brought to light the jewelry, the porcelains, the fabrics that Ingres had fixed forever on the mirrorlike sur- face of his canvas. Of such tangible facts, costume (whether modern or historical) usually had the lion's share of Ingres's attention. It was certainly one of the rea- sons for his attraction to Holbein's portraits, which must also have appealed to him for their low-relief modeling as weh as their precision of outline, which often silhouetted the sitters against monochrome backgrounds made even flatter by inscriptions giving their names and dates (a device Ingres himself would use in the portraits of Bertin and Madame Moitessier, among others). When Ingres copied one of the versions of Holbein's famous portrait of Henry VIII (fig. 15),^^ he scrutinized every detail of the king's clothing and jewelry as fully as he did the face. But this was precisely what he would also do when drawing living sitters, such as the painter Charles Thevenin (cat. no. 74). With a quick change of wardrobe, Ingres's drawing of Holbein's sixteenth-century king might slip unnoticed into his painstaking accounts of how nineteenth- century people looked and dressed. Of Ingres's many hybrids of contemporary portrai- ture and remembered art and history, none reaches more stupefying heights than the state portrait of Napoleon on his imperial throne (cat. no. 10), which, in its willful Fig. II. The Virgin with the Host, 1854 (W 276). Oil on canvas, mounted on wood, diam. 44'/ in. (113 cm). Musee d'Orsay, Paris eccentricity, provoked a battery of hostile criticism at the Salon of 1806.^\"^ By comparison, other official portraits of 1805—6 by Ingres's contemporaries, including David, Franfois Gerard, and Robert Lefevre, offer relatively conservative solutions to the problem of legitimizing the brand-new emperor of France. Lefevre's Napoleon, for instance (fig. 68), looks as though he had quietly usurped the throne of a Bourbon monarch. In his ermine and vel- vet robes (which now, however, bear the symbol of the Napoleonic bee), he stands before the imperial globe, scepter in hand, in a variation of the aloof posture of command and superiority familiar to the succession of eighteenth-century state portraits that begin in 1701 with Rigaud's Louis Z/F (Musee du Louvre, Paris) and end in 1789 with Callet's Louis ZF/ (Musee Bargoin, Clermont- Ferrand). The turbulent gulf between the ancien regime and the Empire seems to have been bridged uneventfully. By contrast, Ingres's vision of Napoleon presents a startling, though eerily timeless intruder, whose almost extraterrestrial character is intensified by the icy over- head lighting, which one critic likened to moonbeams. Such otherworldliness is also underlined by the obses- sively detailed replication of Napoleon's coronation regalia, an awesome profusion of luxurious textures, pat- terns, and precious jewels and metals fit for a celestial god — an abundance that, on more earthbound levels, would be a recurrent theme in Ingres's portraiture. 10 PORTRAITS BY INGRES Fig. 12.

Musee des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble whether in the drawn copy of Henry VIII's doublet or the spectacular painted inventories of his female sitters' wardrobes and jewel boxes. Perhaps most strange is Napoleon's posture, which imposes a titanic immobility upon the swift reversals of political power that marked the origins of modern French history. Many sources have been proposed for this image of omnipotent authority, including the supreme deities of the classical and the Christian worlds: on the one hand, Phidias's Olympian Jupiter (which Ingres would use more literally for his Jupiter and Thetis of 18 11 [fig. 92]) and, on the other, Jan van Eyck's God the Father from the Ghent altarpiece (then displayed in Paris as part of Napoleon's loot; fig. 75).^^ To this fusion of classical idealism and Late Gothic hyperrealism can also be added an encyclopedic portrait gallery of pre-Bourbon French monarchs, an association that would permit Napoleon to join a more venerable dynasty. The Recueil des roys, a popular late-sixteenth-century compendium of historical texts and images ranging from Clovis to Fran9ois I (who had commissioned the survey), might well have provided archetypes of French medieval authority that could push Ingres's youthful imagination to still further excesses. Such works as the sixteenth-century fantasy portrait of the sixth-century Frankish king Clotaire I (fig. i6) foreshadow the magical mold of supernatural power and splendor into which Ingres would fit the new emperor, who, during Fig. 14.

Ingres himself, we might add, also kept one foot in reality. At the same Salon, he exhibited a self-portrait of 1804 (see cat. nos. 11, 147) that, although later repainted, originally showed the artist before a blank canvas. With a greatcoat casually tossed over one shoulder in a preview of the way he would depict the cape of another genius at work, Raphael (fig. 127),^^ he presents himself, cloth in hand, preparing what would in later reworkings of the painting become the underdrawing for the portrait of his friend the lawyer Jean-Fran9ois Gilibert (cat. no. 5). And this virtual advertisement for his professional credentials was glori- ously amplified at the Salon with the family portraits commissioned by a minor civil servant of the Empire, Philibert Riviere (cat. no. 9, figs. 57, 58). While these early masterpieces clearly announce that Ingres could descend from Napoleon's Valhalla to deal for a moment with less famous contemporary patrons and their offspring, even they hold constant reminders of more high-minded things. In the earliest of the three Riviere portraits, and the one most indebted to David, the paterfamihas is seated next to a haphazard array of objects that turn out to be calculated references to recent as well as remote genius. The bindings of the books inform us that two of the volumes contain the works of Rousseau, whereas the name on the unbound cahier is Mozart, who, being only twenty-four years Ingres's senior, would later figure in The Apotheosis of Homer as the immortal closest to the painter's own generation. In the foreground of this still life of books and papers, art is added to music and literature in the form of a print after Raphael's Madonna della Sedia (fig. 17), which had already mesmerized the precocious Ingres by the early 1790s, when he saw a copy of it made by his first art teacher, Joseph Roques — an epiphany he later described as being \"like a star that had fallen from heaven.\"^\" Raphael's paint- ing, in fact, went on to live many different lives in Ingres's work. It could be an appropriate stage prop in his narrative scenes from sixteenth-century historical legend, including Henry IF Playing with His Children (W 113; Musee du Petit Palais, Paris) and Raphael and the Fornarina (fig. 127), or the source of a headdress he favored, a turban known PORTRAITS BY INGRES as a scuffia, which is also worn in Raphael's portrait of La Fornarina (fig. 60) and which turns up often in Ingres's bathers and odalisques as well as in his recreations of the story of Raphael and his legendary love and inspiration.^' Formally speaking, the coiling rhythms of flesh and fabric in the Madonna della Sedia may also provide a point of departure for Ingres's portrait of Philibert Riviere's wife, Sabine (cat. no. 9), who in fact looks as though she were painted by a far more daring artist than the one who painted her husband. As revealed by X rays,^^ she was originally seated against a chairback, but the perpetuum mobile of arabesques, beginning with the Neo-Gothic quatrefoil pattern inscribed on the furniture frame in the lower right, finally triumphed over such a gravity-bound, sedentary structure. The result is a coloratura aria on a theme by Raphael, in which a dominant motif of the Madonna della Sedia — the mixture of a chair fragment with a cushioning roundness of clothing and exposed flesh — is brought to the highest pitch of caressing embellishment. Raphael's lucid circularity becomes a ser- pents' nest of ovoid patterns; his amply modeled figures and draperies are compressed to shadowless reliefs; his decorative fringes now quiver like sea anemones with delicately pulsating life. As for the robust limbs and soft, plump fingers of Raphael's mother and infants, these nor- mative anatomies are attenuated to audacious extremes, as if the sitters' flesh and bones were elastic enough to obey the artist's every command. In Ingres's hands, Raphael's more generalized rendering of textures takes on the sharp- focus precision of clothing and jewelry perceived as if through a magnifying glass, permitting us to discern every stitch of the cashmere shawl's minuscule pattern of exoti- cally stylized leaves and fruit. Raphael's ghost would be reincarnated in countless and often unexpected ways throughout Ingres's career, inhabiting his portraits as well as his more explicit homages to what he considered the perfection of the master's religious art. For instance, the portrait of the Rivieres' thirteen-year-old daughter, Caroline (fig. 58), has been seen as recalling, in its almost embalmed pose and gesture, Raphael's La Fornarina (fig. 60), which also haunted many of Ingres's nudes.\" Then there is the drama of the parted green curtains that Raphael used to disclose the luminous vision of The Sistine Madonna (fig. 18). When he painted The Vow of Louis XIII (fig. 146), Ingres resurrected this trompe I'oeil theater as an undisguised acknowledgment of his venerable prototype, but this Raphaelesque motif was also echoed more subdy in his portraiture. The similar curtains in the background of the 1804 Bonaparte as First Consul (cat. no. 2), which are drawn back to reveal the cathedral of Saint-Lambert in the Liege suburbs (damaged by Austrian bombardment in 1794 and later reconstructed, thanks to Napoleonic benevolence), might be only a coincidental parallel to the religious revelation of the Raphael's heavenly draperies. However, their appearance in the uncommonly dramatic portrait of Caroline Murat (cat. no. 34) is probably a much closer paraphrase. Here, the parted green curtains create the sudden illusion of grandeur, allowing us to see for a moment the queen of Naples, who reigns above us in an image that, as Carol Ockman has pointed out,^\"^ mirrors almost exactly Ingres's consular portrait of Bonaparte, the sitter's brother. Caroline's head, framed by window mullions and crowned by a flurry of black plumes, rises even higher than the clouds of Vesuvian smoke that are disclosed against the spectacular, blue-skied view of her kingdom's most famous landmark. Later, in 1828, Ingres used the same curtains descended from Raphael's Chris- tian skies in a harem bathing scene (fig. 19), where they produce the clandestine effect of a gentleman's peephole view into an erotic paradise. Ingres would have claimed that his greatest and most sustained loyalties were to Raphael, but, like Picasso, he could find inspiration in any chapter of art history and could use his sources in the most overt as well as covert ways.

Gemaldegalerie, Dresden reflect this encyclopedic diversity of references. Raphael and Poussin might be predictable ancestors, but others, like Boucher, may come as a surprise, especially for an artist who was a student of David. Ingres had entered the master's studio in 1797 as a seventeen year old, just in time to share the welling dissension of those fellow stu- dents who felt David had not gone far enough in purging himself of the lingering decadence of the ancien regime. As for David's heroic effort at regressing to a more puri- fied realm of Greek rather than Roman art. The Interven- tion of the Sabine Women of 1799 (^g- '\\'^-> these young Turks hurled such insults as \"Vanloo,\" \"Pompadour,\" and \"Rococo.\"^' Indeed, many of Ingres's paintings and drawings from 1800 to 1806 (including the double por- trait of the stiffly posed, cylinder-necked Harvey sisters [cat. no. 22]) reflect the preference for archaic art and lit- erature that would give David's most rebellious students the name \"Les Primitifs.\" Yet the Rococo traditions the younger generation wanted to exterminate in art as in politics would keep emerging in unexpected guises. In his study of the Comtesse d'Haussonville^ Munhall introduced as one source of inspiration Boucher's famous 1756 portrait of Madame Fig. 19.

Musee du Louvre, Paris de Pompadour (fig. 20), which provides a lineage for the mirror background to the sitter's meditative pose.^'^ Espe- cially for an artist like Ingres, who had worked on David's austere portrait of Madame Recamier in 1800 (fig. 306),^^ Boucher's painting could hardly have symbolized better the detested art of the Rococo. But its legacy in Ingres's portraiture was continually fruitful, starting about 18 14, with Madame de Senonnes (cat. no. 35), which offers a virtual Western pendant to the exotic luxury and indo- lence of the famous odalisque Ingres painted at the same time (fig. loi). Like Boucher's portrait, Madame de Senonnes contrasts the material opulence of the sitter's dress and jewelry with a filmy mirror background that also reflects a profil perdu and a bit of the billowing uphol- stery that cushions her pose of studied relaxation, a far cry from Madame Recamier's tense, upright posture on the hardest of chaises longues. As in the Boucher portrait, the potentially cloying surfeit of Madame de Senonnes's wardrobe (which includes, as a throwaway, the same kind of cashmere shawl worn by Madame Riviere) is instandy alleviated by the gold-framed vista of another room, hazily defined by rectilinear fragments of pilasters. The foreground congestion of feminine fashions, almost 14 PORTRAITS BY INGRES Fig. 20. Francois Boucher (1703—1770). Madame de Pompadour, 1756. Oil on canvas, 79 x 62 in. (200.7 x 157.5 cm). Alte Pinakothek, Munich accessible to touch, shifts abruptly to an atmospheric void, a welcome breathing space for the eye and the imagina- tion. This shifting contrast of near and far, of material density versus glassy illusion, became one of Ingres's most evocative themes, brought to further heights in his portraits of the Comtesse d'Haussonville (cat. no. 125) and Madame Moitessier (cat. nos. 133, 134). In view of the intense nostalgia for Rococo luxury that characterized so many aspects of Second Empire life and style, it is also plausible to consider the late portrait of Madame Moitessier (cat. no. 134) — a full-scale resurrec- tion of the style Pompadour so hated by David and his students — the more chiseled counterpart of Winterhalter's fashion-plate portraits of Empress Eugenie and her entourage. Here again, Ingres turned his master's swans into peacocks, leaving decades behind him the spare, white sinuosity of style and costume that marked so many Davidian paragons of femininity from the early century. Indeed, his rendering of Madame Moitessier's fringed and beribboned dress, with its tumbling roses, may find its closest rival in Boucher's loving description of Madame de Pompadour's extravaganza of green taf- feta, festooned with lace and garlands of roses. Whether he was faced with a queen of the drawing room or an emperor of France, a businessman or a bour- geois family, Ingres, throughout seven decades of paint- ing and drawing his contemporaries, never stopped adapting the facts of living people and ephemeral fash- ions to a multitude of references in the history of Western portraiture. Moreover, the taut contours and crystalline perception that marked his style could immobilize these mirrorlike images, transforming a variety of social and psychological types into icons. His genius, of course, was inimitable, but his portraits constantly provided themes for countless variations that would be reflected in the work not only of his own students but of many later gen- erations.^^ Such is the case in the 1838 portrait of Isaure Chasseriau by Amaury-Duval, the first student to enroll in the atelier Ingres opened in Paris in 1825 (fig. 21).^^ The young sitter, herself the niece of an Ingres student, Theodore Chasseriau, offers a precocious painted version of that hybrid of sacred and secular divinity Ingres so often created for his patrons. The girl's hypnotic stare and fixed symmetry are also found in earlier portrait draw- ings by Ingres of young women whose aura of sanctity suggests they may be playing the role of a Vestal Virgin or a novice in a nunnery. Already members of this pious soror- ity are Mademoiselle Jeanne Hayard (1815; cat. no. 51) and Mademoiselle Louise Vernet (1835; cat. no. 112), each of whom becomes a figure in an imaginary shrine. In Amaury- Duval's portrait, the framelike molding on the rear wall further distances the sitter from prosaic reality, much as the wreath of roses in her hair strengthens the aura of rit- ual mystery. This transformation into an ideal cult object is enforced by the Ingresque purities of line and contour, the perfect symmetry of her sloping shoulders matching the cylindrical clarity of her folded arms. On reaching maturity, Isaure, we feel, might well turn into the haughty, standing divinity that Ingres envisioned in his first portrait of Madame Moitessier (cat. no. 133). Ingres's iconic portrait formulas were reflected as well in the work of still later nineteenth-century generations. The portraits of Gerome, for instance, often rely as closely on Ingres's prototypes as do his marmoreal nudes. In one of an unidentified woman, perhaps the artist's wife (fig. 22), we may again feel the ghost of Ingres.\"^\" It was a particularly topical presence, given the fact that the painting probably dates from the years just after the master's death on January 14, 1867, which was quickly commemorated with a huge retrospective (584 works) that permitted the Parisian art world to see, among other things, Ingres's long-term achievement as a portraitist.\"^' ingres's portraits and their muses 15 The 153 portraits shown — 25 paintings and 128 draw- ings— included the 1806 Napoleon I on His Imperial Throne (cat. no. 10), whose poHtical and aesthetic excesses prompted Cezanne's parodistic response, a grotesquely \"enthroned\" portrait of his pitifully deformed painter friend, the dwarf Achille Emperaire (fig. 23).\"^^ But Gerome's position, of course, was one of respect, not youthful rebellion, and his portrait from the late 1860s seems, with its assorted memories of the comtesse d'Haussonville and Madame Moitessier, almost a rever- ent composite of Ingres's achievement. Nevertheless, the master's poetry has been translated into a far more literal prose, with Gerome playing Ter Borch to Ingres's Vermeer. Typically, Gerome adds more information to Ingres's more selective realities, including the full-length display of the sitter's dress and train, a mirror reflection not only of the back of her head but of a family portrait (possibly the sitter's father), and a beloved dog clutched over her heart. To be sure, Ingres, too, could occasion- ally include a pet dog in a portrait drawing, as in Made- moiselle Hennette- Ursule Claire and Her Dog Trim (cat. Fig. 21. Eugene-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval (1808-1885). Isaure Chasseriau, 1838. Oil on canvas, 46 x 35V in. (117 x 90 cm). Musee des Beaux-Arts, Rennes no. 73), but in the painted portraits, his more high- minded self would always win out. If Ingres's definitive depictions of well-to-do con- temporary women were reliable points of departure for nineteenth-century establishment portraiture, as they often were, in subder ways, for the milieu of Degas, Tissot, and Whisder, his no less decisive characteriza- tions of men also cast a long shadow. As just one exam- ple, there is the unforgettable portrait of Bertin (cat. no. 99), which created a norm for depictions of prominent men of action and power, whether intellectual or execu- tive. Two official portraits of the 1890s may illustrate this legacy. One is Constant's depiction of a major patron of the Louvre, Alfred Chauchard (fig. 24),^^ who scrutinizes us from his quasi-photographic monochrome setting as severely as did Bertin, whose portrait, in fact, entered the Louvre in the same year (1897) that Chauchard's stern image appeared at the annual Salon. Another is the com- memorative portrait of Ernest Renan, painted by Leon Bonnat in 1892, the year of the great historian's death (fig. 25). He, even more than Chauchard, has inherited Bertin' s probing gaze and hands-on-thighs energy, as well as his no-nonsense simplicity of setting and mono- chrome palette.'^'* The Renan portrait was exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, where it might well have reinforced the authority of the Bertin portrait for two artists who must have seen it there, Vallotton and Picasso. Both of them, it turned out, would soon absorb Bertin's image in their portraits of Gertrude Stein. Picasso, in 1906, deftly reincarnated this formula for heavyset men of action and letters in what is perhaps, among other things, a joking comment on Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference (fig. 26). One year later, Vallotton turned to the same source for his portrait of Stein (fig. 27), pointing out the resemblance, right down to the pudgy fingers, in an even more direct way than Picasso.\"^' It was Picasso, above all, who rejuvenated Ingres's portraiture for the twentieth century in ways both appar- ent and stealthy; in fact, his ongoing dialogue with the master is so long and so complex that it warrants a full- length study. For instance, he recreated his own mirror image in 1917 in the guise of Ingres's early self-portrait of 1804;'^'^ he transformed Marie-Therese Walter into the seated Madame Moitessier;'*'^ he mimicked Ingres's por- trait drawing style as an appropriate language to record an upwardly mobile milieu of the Parisian art world, including the wives and children of the dealers Georges Wildenstein and Paul Rosenberg, who handled modern artists as well as Ingres.\"^^ 16 PORTRAITS BY INGRES Fig. 22.

(200 x 120 cm). Musee d'Orsay, Paris Picasso particularly loved to materialize the specter of Ingres within his own domestic confines, envisioning his wife or lover in the role of this or that Ingres sitter. His first wife, Olga Khokhlova, was the constant object of this pictorial alchemy that blurred the boundary between art and life. Just before their marriage in June 19 18, he had Olga pose seated in an upholstered armchair, fan in hand, as if she were in the lap of Ingresque luxury, and then photographed her (fig, 28). The photograph, in turn, was transformed into a painting (fig. 29; now datable as spring 1918, not 1917)'^''' that appears to be an eerie resur- rection of the 1807 portrait of Madame Duvaucey (fig. 87). Suddenly, Olga has inhabited the body and spirit of Ingres' s sitter, whether one looks at the part in the center of the smoothly groomed dark hair that crowns the per- fectly oval head, or the cameolike modeling of porcelain flesh that runs from the neck through the tubular arms in sensual contrast with the inky blackness of the dress. And the strange expression of wistful aloofness mixed with confrontation adds yet another echo of Ingres. With Olga as medium, Ingres's ghosts often turned into flesh in Picasso's new domestic milieu. During the summer of 1920 at Juan-les-Pins, he could see his wife relaxing in a peignoir, instantly transform her head, shoulders, and decolletage into the imperious standing portrait of Madame Moitessier (cat. no. 133), and then bring this exalted reference back to earth with the joke of an obtrusive pair of bare feet (fig. 30). Or, as he spied Olga reading, one shoe on and one shoe off, in the cush- ioning embrace of an armchair (fig. 32), he might see, instead, the seated Madame Moitessier (cat. no. 134), one finger of her unforgettably invertebrate hand on her temple. Olga can also appear in the guise of Madame Marcotte de Sainte-Marie (cat. no. 97), reenacting her dour countenance and withdrawn posture in an odd col- lage of paper drawings mounted on canvas (fig. 31). Such adaptations of Ingres's portraiture seem to quote not only his sitters' postures and moods but also his own wide pictorial vocabulary, which can move from an almost pure outline to an illusion of fully modeled ingres's portraits and their muses Fig. 24.

Musee d'Orsay, Paris anatomy and clothing that is nevertheless undermined by the insistent spatial compression. The 191 8 portrait of Olga (fig. 29), for instance, provides just such a parallel, creating almost a collage effect of juxtaposed fabric and flesh patterns. Such illusory textures and volumes are immediately contradicted by the surprising expanse of unfinished canvas marked here and there by tentative pencil and paint marks, a reminder of the plain paper background exposed in a rapidly improvised papier colle. It is an effect related to such an overtly Cubist painting as that inspired in the summer of 1914 by an earlier lover, Eva Gouel, generally titled Portrait of a Young Girl (fig. 33), a \"portrait\" that might be considered a witty update of Ingres's Madame Riviere (cat. no. 9). Picasso here trans- lates the master's decorative profusion of shawls, lace, upholstery, and jewelry into his own Cubist patchwork quilt, which includes a feathery, serpentine boa rhyming with the upholstered curves of the armchair; an elaborate hat adorned with flowers that match the corsage on her breast; a jabot of speckled lace falling over her elongated, puffy sleeves; and snippets of a floral wallpaper pattern. ^° As for the sitter herself, her head and body have disap- peared under this surfeit of feminine fashions, leaving exposed only one ungloved hand which, in its relieflike Fig. 25.

It should be remembered that when it was first exhib- ited, Madame Riviere shocked critics because of its rejec- tion of conventional modeling, its anatomical distortions, its effect of blond, unshadowed flatness — all characteris- tics that would, to Cubist eyes, give the painting a sur- prisingly topical look.'\" Seen this way, Madame Riviere has that quality of abruptly colliding patterns which Picasso explored in his pasted-paper cutouts, a scrapbook style that he imitated in the completely painted surface of the 1914 \"portrait.\" Picasso's attraction to Madame Riviere and its progeny was, in fact, articulated clearly in 1921 in an article written for L'Esprit nouveau by Roger Bissiere, who, in the aftermath of Cubism, tried to bridge the gap between new and old masters. Referring to Madame Riviere^ among others, Bissiere stressed how Ingres's portraits anticipated those of Cezanne and Picasso by challenging, with their \"living geometry, everything that was once understood by aerial perspective,\" and by asserting how \"the painting remains an inflexibly flat sur- face in which distant planes are wrenched to the fore- ground.\"'^ Picasso had clearly seen this point earlier, and he may also have found inspiration in Madame Riviere's 18 PORTRAITS BY INGRES Fig. 26.

And in his mock portrait of an invisible Eva, he also revived most humorously Ingres's familiar lesson that \"clothes make the woman.\" Like other museum-goers, artists have never stopped marveling at the miraculous fusion of visible truths and abstract fantasies that marks the greatest of Ingres's por- traits. Even during the evolution of the antirealist lan- guages created by de Kooning and Gorky, Ingres's portraiture was often a talisman. We know, for example, that these two masters, on their frequent visits to the Metropolitan Museum, particularly venerated Madame Leblanc (cat. no. 88), whose walleyed gaze and fluid ana- tomy would often be resurrected in their figure paintings of the 1940s.\" Much younger generations made other surprising deductions from the premises of Ingres's por- traiture. Richard Pettibone, a pioneer of the art of repli- cation who, as early as the 1960s, had made diminutive copies of works by such contemporaries as Stella and Fig. 35. Cindy Sherman (b. 1954).

Edition of 6 ingres's portraits and their muses 21 Warhol, would in the next decade try his meticulous hand at creating equally small color reproductions of both the whole and the fragmentary details of paintings by Ingres, with results that look like jeweler's-glass views of the Comtesse d'Haussonville or the Princesse de Broglie (fig. 34). The fullest homage to Ingres's portraiture, however, is surely found in one of Cindy Sherman's many anthologies of self-portraits, the 1989—90 series of old-master portrait icons. Turning to Ingres from Fouquet and Botticelli, Raphael and Holbein, she recreates herself as a synthesis of decors, wardrobes, and postures culled from the most opulent of the master's society women (fig. 35). From Madame de Sennones (cat. no. 35), for instance, she bor- rows the papers wedged into the mirror frame and reflected there together with the sitter's back; from Madame Riviere (cat. no. 9), the rising and falling embrace of a sinuous shawl and the casual display of idle fingers adorned with precious-metal rings; from the first Madame Moitessier (cat. no. 133), the willfully wayward, off-center turn of a pearl necklace against a commanding bosom; from the second Madame Moitessier (cat. no. 134), the pensive head elegantly supported by an index finger and a curling wrist. From these and many other Ingres quotations, Sherman fashions and then physically inhabits a new Ingres portrait — one that rushes back and forth from contemporary (now literally photographic) reality to the remote sanctuaries of history and art museums, shuffling past and present in what is diagnosed these days as a symptom of postmodernism. But, current categories aside, isn't that what Ingres was doing, too.^ 1. See New York, Paris 1996—97. 2. See Zurich, Tubingen 1994-95, and Ottawa, Chicago, Fort Worth 1997—98. 3.

Carefully copied at the age of eleven from a drawing made by his father, it is in a well-established eighteenth-century tradi- tion of modest but carefully observed portrait drawings in profile, of which Charles-Nicolas Cochin the younger was perhaps the best-known exponent in the second half of the century. The artist's father, Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres (1755— 1 8 14), was originally from the regional capital of Toulouse. Fig- T,!- Jean Moulet, 1791. Red chalk on paper, 5^x4';/ in. (13.6 x I I.I cm). Musee Ingres, Montauban (867.335) He had established himself in the country town of Montauban as a successful jack-of-all-trades — sculptor, painter, decorative stonemason, and architect — who worked on a wide variety of local civic, religious, and private commissions. Doubtless he intended his first child, Jean-Auguste-Dominique, born on August 29, 1780, to follow in his footsteps; the boy was encouraged to draw, for instance, by making copies of his father's own draw- ings and small collection of engravings. Such domestic instruction may also have compensated for the deficiencies of formal schooling in Montauban, which had been disrupted by events in the early years of the French Rev- olution. Nevertheless, Ingres later expressed regret for his lack of conventional education, which hampered his ability to express himself both verbally and in writing.^ Fig. 38.

Detail Madame Riviere (cat. no. 9) His easiest and most directly emotional form of expres- sion, after drawing and painting, was making music: he was a talented violinist, even as a child. Although his parents were not completely happy in their marriage, the artist retained a strong affection for them both, which is borne out in his correspondence and in his portraits of them. Certainly closely bonded with his father, as both son and pupil, he retained a strong, affec- tionate memory of the man who was largely responsible for his own love of art and music. His mother, Anne (1758-1817), seems to have been long-suffering and was neglected by her inconsiderate and often absent husband. After Joseph Ingres' s death in 18 14, she was left in severe financial hardship, which perhaps accounts for her some- what pinched features in the portrait drawing Ingres made of her when she visited Rome that year (fig. 38). Her looks contrast strikingly with the healthy, confident appearance of her late husband when Ingres painted him ten years earlier (cat. no. 4). In 1 79 1 Joseph Ingres decided it was time for his son to receive more formal instruction in art. Abandoning Madame Ingres to look after two small siblings,^ the father set off with the boy for Toulouse, an important adminis- trative, legal, religious, university, and cultural center. Joseph, who was justifiably proud of his native city, planned to remain there for a couple of years to supervise the young student. The eleven-year-old was enrolled at the Academie Royale de Peinture, Sculpture et Architecture for the 1791-92 academic year. As the Revolution pro- gressed, the Academie lost its royal patronage, but Ingres continued to study there until 1797, practicing drawing and receiving instruction in the theory and history of art. At the same time, he was taught painting by several local artists, his principal instructor being the history and por- trait painter Joseph-Guillaume Roques. In the late 1770s Roques had studied in Rome, where he had been a pro- tege of Joseph-Marie Vien, director of the Academie de France there, and where he must also have encountered the young Jacques-Louis David and other rising stars from Paris. Roques's work displays a certain gritty real- ism that is characteristic of the Toulouse school and that also lies behind Ingres's own acute eye.\"^ At the Academie in Toulouse, the young student performed well and car- ried off a number of prizes for drawing during his six years of study. From his teachers there, and from Roques and other masters, he learned that history painting was supreme among the artistic genres, while also observing, on a more practical level, that being able to paint or draw a good portrait likeness was necessary to make a living. It was a fact of life for eighteenth-century painters who took the academic tradition seriously that their high aspirations as history painters were rarely matched by a desire on the part of their potential patrons for such intel- lectually demanding work. Most collectors were more interested in decorative pictures, light-hearted mytholo- gies, recognizable scenes of everyday life, landscapes, still lifes, or likenesses of men and women of their own class. This preference persisted throughout the nine- teenth century, as academically oriented artists waited and hoped for the patronage of state or church to satisfy their more elevated ambitions. The situation was particu- larly acute during the period of social unrest, war, and economic uncertainty in which Ingres began his artistic career. By 1800 a good many critics deplored the exces- sive numbers of portraits appearing at the Salon, espe- cially when they diverted history painters from their higher calling: \"It is often through vanity alone that so many people have themselves painted, and if there is any- thing useful about this behavior, one can say that it benefits painters, who thereby try to compensate for the few opportunities they have to exercise their talents and turn these to good account.\"' Admiring Anne-Louis Girodet's portrait Monsieur Bourgeon (fig. 39) at the Salon of 1800, another reviewer regretted that \"I know only one thing wrong with this artist, and that is to have painted this portrait with so much skill and realism that it seems to have cost him a great deal of time. What he has lost in polishing a suit of clothes could have been better spent in polishing a masterpiece of history painting.'\"^ Ingres himself would certainly come to share such feel- ings, when necessity all too often drove him to make like- nesses rather than to create works of art imbued with the classical ideal. A number of Ingres's portrait drawings survive from his years in Toulouse, some of them depicting friends, and others likely done to earn a little money. Several small heads in profile (see, for instance, cat. no. 14) show a gemlike hardness and precision of observation that give them the quality of carved reliefs or cameos. By their very nature as images in profile, their contours are bold, while the internal modeling is done with fine hatched lines. The exacting scrutiny and the precise response of the hand required in making these little portrait drawings were disciplines that would prove to be of inestimable importance for the rest of Ingres's long career as a drafts- man and portraitist. The drawings are usually signed \"Ingres fils,\" perhaps as an act of filial homage but also as a way to distinguish them from Joseph's works. Although 26 MONTAUBAN-TOULOUSE— PARIS Fig. 39.

Musee de I'Hotel Sandelin, Saint-Omer a drawing of the actor Brochard (cat. no. 15), which still exists in its original mount, proclaims with pride Ingres's authorship and his association with Toulouse, the young artist's proficiency as a draftsman clearly marked him for a destiny that was more than local. It was a normal progression for artists of talent to graduate to Paris to complete their professional training. In Ingres's time, a number of painters had made the jour- ney from Toulouse to receive instruction in the busy stu- dio of the celebrated David, for over a decade the virtual dictator of elevated painting in France.^ What was the experience of Paris and David's studio like for the young Ingres, when he arrived in the city in August 1797.'^ It must have been daunting to encounter a master who had voted for the death of a king — even though the former Jacobin David had been tried, imprisoned, and released by Revolutionary tribunals two years before. Yet by this time, the atmosphere of social unrest and political tension (which Ingres himself had experienced in Montauban and Toulouse) had been replaced by a greater equilibrium, both in Paris and elsewhere. Optimism was in the air, as the ongoing Revolution metamorphosed into the distant rumbling of expansionist foreign wars, and news was coming back from south of the Alps of the triumphs of a precocious General Bonaparte and his youthful armies. Thanks to these foreign campaigns, the mid-i790s saw Paris transformed into the greatest museum city ever, and over the next twenty years remarkable quantities of war booty arrived there from abroad. The French mili- tary campaign in Belgium and Holland during 1794-95 had already brought to Paris such masterpieces as Van Eyck's Adoration of the Lamb altarpiece from the church of Saint Bavo in Ghent, Rubens's Descent from the Cross from Antwerp Cathedral, and Rembrandt's Night Watch from the Amsterdam town hall. Between 1796 and 1799 the Italian campaigns brought altarpieces by Correggio from Parma; Titians, Veroneses, and Tintorettos from Venice; and Raphaels from Florence and Rome. It must surely have been heaven for any young artist to see on display in one place — the old royal palace of the Louvre, renamed the Musee Napoleon in 1803 — so many great works from the European canon, from antiquity to mod- ern times. ^ This treasure continued to arrive throughout the triumphant days of the Empire, and the experience for Ingres cannot be overestimated. To see such works as Raphael's Madonna della Sedia from the Pitti Palace in Florence (fig. 17), The Coronation of the Virgin from the Vatican, and Saint Cecilia from the Pinacoteca in Bologna must also have made the black-and-white engravings in his father's collection in Montauban seem like pale reflections indeed. The experience also provided the young painter with a bewildering variety of aesthetic choices: true as he was to the Neoclassical heritage of David, and steadfast in his devotion to Raphael, Ingres was exposed to so many historical options in his forma- tive years that he "
