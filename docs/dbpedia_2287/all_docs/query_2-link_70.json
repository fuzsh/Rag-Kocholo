        "text": "Opocno is one of my favourite castles in Bohemia. I like the connection to my own region in Italy (Friuli Venezia-Giulia) where the family Colloredo was coming from. I also like the renassaince loggiato (picture above), even if it proved not very comfortable for the climate of Northern Bohemia, but the attraction for Italian architecture was too powerful. The location and the castle itself are superb (well, most of the castles were positioned in nice locations, since those folks knew how to choose the spots, but at the end it is also a matter of personal taste). Opocno lies at the foot of the Eagle mountains (Orlickych horách) in the Northeastern Bohemia, not far from the city of Hradec Kralove. The hilly regions were always preferred locations, both for the presence of water for the agricultural and later industrial activities and for the presence of beautiful forests, rich of game, where the nobles were practicing they preferred leisure activity, hunting.\n\nThe events connected to the ownership of the castle are quite amazing and related to one of the major episodes of Bohemia history, the thirty years war at the beginning of the XVII century. The castle has very old roots and it was owned by several noble families, but finally in the XVI century, it was inhabited by the Trčka family. Unfortunately for them, during the thirty years war, they sided the wrong party, that of the Bohemian noble families, who lost the war against the Habsburg. Adam Trčka was one of the best and loyal friend of Albrecht von Wallenstein, originally the commander of the Imperial army, but at the end considered too powerful and dangerous. Therefore, at the end of the war, in 1634, they were both killed by the imperial forces. During the war, a knight of an Italian family, Rudolf Colloredo, stood out for his acts of courage and heroism and therefore he was rewarded by the Emperor Ferdinand II with the castle of Opocno (1635). Rudolf and his family became very rich with the income deriving from the agricultural and other economic activities around the castle. In fact he built as well for himself one of the most splendid palace in Prague, palace Schönborn, now hosting the US embassy.\n\nThe name Mansfeld came with the marriage of Franz Gundakar Colloredo with Maria Isabella Mansfeld, last descendant of a noble family from Saxony. To preserve the name it was granted to add it after Colloredo. The family provided several distinguished leaders to the Habsburg Empire (in the picture below, the portrait of Empress Maria Theresia is proudly displayed in the main sitting room of the castle) and one of the Colloredo was also the discoverer and protector of Mozart and ruled Salzburg for almost 30 years.\n\nIn more recent times (XX century) the prince Joseph II was a passionate hunter and traveller and, even if he spent most of his life abroad, in Opocno it is still possible to admire his collection of weapons (supposedly the most magnificent in Czech Republic) and trophies from hunting activities all over the world.\n\nThe visit to the castle is organized according the standard approach of guided tours that you can find in all Czech mansions. The tour is normally lasting around one hour and is held in Czech, but you have the possibility to have an English test explaining the most relevant facts of every room you will visit. In Opocno, you can visit the living rooms of the last 2–3 generations of its noble inhabitants and appreciate how much innovations they were able to introduce. The modern bathroom setup is a notable example. Other highlights are the precious fire arms collections and the hunting trophies (picture below).\n\nThe best way to finish the visit, is to take a stroll in the magnificent park, following the stairs just in front of the loggiato (picture below) and imagine the atmosphere of the hunting events organized until not so many years by the magnificent owners of this wonderful place."
