He died unexpectedly yesterday. How sad for Prince Hans-Adam to watch his son die. RIP\n\nOfficial statement from the Princely Family:\n\nThe Princely House regrets to announce that HSH Prince Constantin of Liechtenstein died unexpectedly on December 5, 2023. Prince Constantin was the youngest son of Prince Hans-Adam II. He leaves behind his wife, Princess Marie of Liechtenstein, née Countess Kálnoky of Kőröspatak, and his children Prince Moritz, Princess Georgina and Prince Benedikt.\n\nPrince Constantin was chairman of the supervisory board of Liechtenstein Group AG and a member of Board of Directors of Liechtenstein Group Holding AG.\n\nVaduz Castle, December 6, 2023\n\nhttps://fuerstenhaus.li/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MM_Prinz-Constantin_20231206_FINAL.pdf\n\nAfter the state parliament observed a minute of silence in today's session, apostolic administrator Benno Elbs sent words of mourning to the family and population:\n\n“It was with great sadness that I learned today of the death of HSH Prince Constantin of Liechtenstein. On behalf of the Archdiocese of Vaduz, I would like to express my most sincere condolences to HSH Prince Hans-Adam II, the deceased's wife Princess Marie and their children Prince Moritz, Princess Georgina and Prince Benedikt. I join them and the entire royal family in mourning and praying for the deceased.\n\nThis afternoon, at 3 pm, the bells rang in all the parish churches in the archdiocese. I invite all believers of the Principality to join in prayer for Prince Constantin and thus express their solidarity with the Princely House. I wish Prince Hans-Adam II, Princess Marie, the children and all who mourn the deceased much strength and comfort in the hope of the resurrection. You can feel supported by the many people who pray for the deceased across the principality. God grant Prince Constantin eternal rest.\"\n\nhttps://www.vaterland.li/liechtenstein/gesellschaft/prinz-constantin-ist-verstorben-art-551264\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Dec 6, 2023\n\nLady Chiara\n\nGentry\n\nJoined\n\nMar 11, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n86\n\nCity\n\nBergamo\n\nCountry\n\nItaly\n\nSo tragic!

But Constantin our dear Tino needs to be mentioned as he is gone much to soon and much too quick and leaves behind a huge whole in the hearts of his family . My husband Alexander and Tino are the same age and it makes you realize how quickly it can all end and how much we have to appreciate our loved ones as long that are with us . I am beyond sad for Marie his wife and her children . There are no words for my sadness and I wish we as a family can console them as good as possible but a loss of this grandeur is not consolable .
