        "text": "HR accuracy - walk\n\nHi\n\nThe HR accuracy for walking seems to have degraded. I walk every day along a route that is approximately 1.4 km. Towards the end of the walk there is a long steep hill. My heart rate for the flat part of the walk is generally around 100 but when I climb the hill my heart rate rises to just above 140. Recently I switch on the walk mode and my heart rate on the flat part is fairly accurate however I can get to the top of the long hill and my watch still shows aprox 97. I take my pulse manually and its 140+. If I don't use the walk mode and I just periodically flick to the HR widget whilst I walk up the hill it does show the elevated HR although it is also a bit lower than actual - but within reasonable tolerance. Is this a software update bug ?"
