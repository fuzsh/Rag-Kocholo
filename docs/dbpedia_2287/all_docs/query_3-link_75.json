        "text": "Hello Gundakar\n\nI can't see your gps tracks, as i don't seem to have permission to look at your links. Perhaps you should make a screenshot and post it here?\n\nI have used the original snowboard app (SW V 3.40) from Garmin and that is what i found out:\n\nThe app only records your track when skiing down. Once you are down an get a lift up again the app stops recording. It remembers where you got onto the lift and once you start going down the app draws a straight line up from the starting point of the lift to the point where you startet skiing down again (or more precisely where the watch registered you are skiing down again- witch is in your case in 10% of the cases the same point).\n\nI presume this way Garmin can safe battery life and memory space on the watch. Unfortunately the watch does not always detect you skiing again on time, then you don't get the top part of your descent recorded!\n\nThe IQ-SkiApp probably records the chairlift ascent with the gps as well and therefor will not miss the top part of your descent. But if you take a cable-car or train through a tunnel up the mountain, then you might have no or no good gps connection and your track will be completely wrong.\n\nAttached is a an example from me taking five times the same lift up and snowboarding six different runs down again. Notice that the lift takes a corner witch is completely ignored by the track (you might see the lift in the foto). In this example the VA3 startet recording three times at the correct place and twice to late on the run down.\n\nHi, came upon your topic when I wanted to buy a garmin Vivoactive 3 at the end of 2020. The only sports I practice is running from spring to autumn, and a lot of skiing in the winter. Because of this ski tracking was important to me and almost was turned down on buying a Vivoactive because of poor ski tracking detailed here. I also use Ski Tracks on my phone and have history data for the last 4 years and several phone models. What I want to specify here for others that mai want to buy one is that in 2021 the Vivoactive 3 is accurate for skiing compared to phone apps and other smartwatches, not perfect, but ok. My watch has firmware version SW 7.40 and GPS 2.50. Battery lasted from 9:00 to 17:00, 8 hours from 100% so not the advertised 13 hours, and that was with auto run turned On and screen locked, this on multiple days of skiing. I compared the track of the Vivoactive with Ski Tracks and look similar in general with no points outside the track. When zooming in on track sections, the phone map has more resolution with more data points than Garmin but this should be expected from a watch. Iâ€™ve also used an app from the IQ store that allows to configure triggers for when a run should be started, and also got similar results. The metrics I usually check is no. of runs, skiing distance, run distance, avg speed per run and general, max speed per run and general, heart rate info. Compared to the phone app, my Vivoactive recorded data was usually a bit less with about 3-5% regarding distances and speeds. Here is a sample from one of my recordings https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/6079121700#"
