The Colloredo family achieved the elevation to the noble rank of Freiherren by the Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II in 1588 and became immediate Reichsgrafen in 1724. Rudolph Joseph von Colloredo (1706-1788), Vice-Chancellor of Empress Maria Theresa, was appointed Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1763. The Colloredo-Mansfeld line emerged when his son Franz de Paula Gundakar von Colloredo in 1771 married Princess Maria Isabella of Mansfeld and was able to inherit her family's Bohemian estates upon the extinction of the dynasty's male line in 1780, while the original Mansfeld possessions passed to the Prussian Duchy of Magdeburg. The union of the Princely houses of Colloredo and Mansfeld was officially approved by decree of Emperor Joseph II in 1789 and was mediatised to the Austrian Empire in 1806. [wiki]\n\nLate Baroque church Church of the Most Holy Trinity (Kostel Nejsvetejší Trojice), consecrated in October 27th 1797, is a parish church of the Roman Catholic parish of town Dobríš. The church was built at the site of older Loretto Chapel by Franz (František Gundakar I. Prince of Colloredo-Mannsfeld in 1794-1797."
