        "text": "ONTD Original: \"I Don't Know Her\"\n\n\"I don't know her.\"\n\n\"I still don't know her.\"\n\n\"I don't know her either.\"\n\nThe iconic \"I don't know her (2003)\" by Mariah was popularized in the mid-2000s within stan community, and caught on with newcomer stan groups later on. This phrase garnered mainstream attention since Mimi was frequently asked about alleged peers who may or may not allegedly have had the management support to take artistic ideas from certain artists or sing hooks of certain rap and r&b collaborations when it was trendy. The truth is Mariah is a songwriter first, who demo'd tracks since she was 18... and what other people compared to her do is totally different.\n\nIt's sometimes safer to play nice in regards to people who are brought to your attention, and other times you are genuinely not familiar or properly acquainted with them. Inspired by legendary user and influencer stewie_e, we will use a rating system for these 6 celebrities who were inquired about other celebrities, and see what levels of petty were given. Sometimes we #spread our wings and #prepare to fly, and inadvertently our wings will cast a nice #shade under the light.\n\n6. J*stin Bieber on Shawn Mendes\n\nNotes: Does this one Ontario native know the other?\n\nRadio host: \"Do you look at a kid like Shawn Mendes and think 'I was going through what he was going through now?'\"\n\nJB: \"(turns to publicists) Who's Shawn Mendes...?\"\n\nRadio host: \"...He's got a song called \"Stitches\" doing well on pop radio.\"\n\nJB: \"Nice nice... good for him.\"\n\nPettoMeter: 🦋 🦋/10\n\nMaybe he was not having it that day, but it did sound like he did not know who Shawn was. Not a lot of petty, at the same time it could've been a shady remark with how popular \"Stitches\" was (still Shawn was more of a nobody then).\n\n5. Gabrielle Union on St*cey Dash\n\nNotes: Dionne has a long history of nuBlack Republican antics, especially when she declared how platforms like BET is regressive to black representation in entertainment. Anti-aging vampire Gabby had a response when being questioned about the Clueless tv personality.\n\nGabby: \"Is she like related to Damon Dash?\n\nWas she on Rockefeller?...\n\nI heard of a crazy lady once, maybe last week...\"\n\nPettoMeter: 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋/10\n\nPetty performative unawareness check, referring to the person as something else check, and a classy clock by bringing back the important subject. She knew, she didn't care.\n\n4. *ggy on H*lsey\n\nNotes: This is black on black crime between two very gifted musicians. Does anyone really win?\n\nHalsey called Azalea a \"moron\" and accused her of appropriating black culture, adding \"I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.\"\n\nIggy said: \"To me, because I'm a famous person and I know a lot of the time people have opinions and they're not always accurate, I really try very hard not to give my personal opinions about people that I don't know. I don't know her, I've never met her.\n\nI thought it was a bit of a strange thing to throw that out there,\" Iggy continued. \"She's young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental when she's kind of in the same shoes. I'm sure she's getting judged all the time as well by people who don't really know her. Maybe it'd be good for her to try to be a little more empathetic to other people that are in the same situation...I don't really think I had anything to do with it.\"\n\nPettoMeter: 🦋 🦋 🦋/10\n\nH*lsey was dominating the charts with the ear-grating \"Closer\" at the time, but not everyone might've known her as an artist. *ggy's response was relatively formal, and she was giving cute advice as one public person to another.\n\n3. Jhonni Blaze on Az*alia Banks\n\nNotes: Jhonni of Love & Hip Hop NY had a few names to address, including Orlando Brown and Azealia Banks in this particular interview.\n\nJhonni: \"What is that?\n\nThey found that new animal in Africa that got that new flu...\n\n... is that an animal or something?\n\nThis is a human?\n\nLike it breathes?\n\nNever heard of it...\"\n\nPettoMeter: 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋/10\n\nPEAK petty... the lil exchange between the interviewer... Sis spent a good minute with improv creative writing in her response, alluding to her mishearing 'Azealia Banks' as the 'zika' virus. She eventually addressed Azealia, the person, and the drama inflicted between them.\n\n2. Christina Aguilera on Lady Gaga\n\nNotes: Xtina was giving a quick interview about her greatest hits album, and coming up 10 years. Comparisons between her and Gaga after her 2008 VMA performance infamously catapulted then.\n\nInterviewer: \"What do you say to those on the Internet who are hinting that you borrowed Lady Gaga’s look?\"\n\nXtina: \"You know, that’s funny that you mention that. This person [Lady Gaga] was just brought to my attention not too long ago. I’m not quite sure who this person is, to be honest. I don’t know if it is a man or a woman. I just wasn’t sure. I really don’t spend any time on the Internet, so I guess I live a little under a rock in that respect.\"\n\nPettoMeter: 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋 🦋/10\n\nThe real tea is that Gaga WAS a new artist at the time that not everyone knew, and Just Dance did not hit number one until a few months later. Now if you would've heard the name \"Lady Gaga,\" it does sound it could have been a drag name, so Xtina genuinely might've not known about her, and gave the open-ended oblivious 'man or a woman' comment. BUT the unassuming/self deprecating \"I guess I live a little under a rock\" was a very Mariah style petty (re: \"Apparently I'm very forgetful.\").\n\nThe \"man or woman\" idea eventually refueled the public with an obscure concert clip of Gaga appearing to have a bulge during a performance. Gaga referenced the hermaphrodite rumors in the \"Telephone\" music video, in which we will die hoping will get a resolved sequel.\n\n1. Mariah Carey on Demi Lovato\n\nNotes: You do know that Mariah has to be on her own list. Countless times from Mariah I could mention but I'll just mention the following. Mariah played this \"Does! She! Know! Her!?\" game, and we got to feel her honest response to several names delivered.\n\nDemi: \"Mariah's a legend and she's so talented but she disses people, it's nasty the way she treats J*nnifer.\"\n\nMariah's response: \"I don't know her either... She should come up, introduce herself to me, say 'here's my opinion - what do you think about it?'That's how you handle shit, okay?\"\n\nPettoMeter: 🐛/10\n\nNo pettiness, no lil shrug, no dodging around the question, no imaginative story. You just gotta be upfront when you don't know someone and they're rude out of nowhere. This does not have anything on the pettometer, so I rate this caterpillar. Who knows what sources Demi was referring to when she made her public opinion about Mariah and the other artist. And if she was scouring shady diva moments online, it would have been nice if she did a little #herstory research as to where these riffs between divas are rooted.\n\nThis is not the only time Demi had something to say about Mimi when she made a comment on Instagram regarding a meme between Ari and Mariah.\n\nHowever you want to approach it, Mariah Carey taught us that there are four ways to address people you don't know when asked:\n\n1. In a blindly encouraging, but vague fashion\n\n2. In a way to still acknowledge unidentified, said person\n\n3. In solipsist wonderment\n\n4. Point blank\n\ntyfyt - badtz_m\n\nSources: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / me_Madonna.gif\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n#FlashbackFriday: 5 Recent Indie Songs Interpolating Hits\n\nI can't help but being taken aback when these indie songs randomly use a good chunk of music from familiar hits. Some of these songs range from \"contains elements of\" to using multiple verses, but still including different lyrics.\n\nDo you think you can guess the songs by listening to them?\n\n5. Right On Time by Jojo (2015)\n\n\"I Love You Always Forever\" by Donna Lewis\n\nPart used from the original:\n\nSay you love, love me forever\n\nNever stop, I'm there for whatever\n\nNear and far, you're always everywhere and everything\n\nNotes: Yes I know this is still a 'major label' release but Jojo has been rebirthed into indie pop and r&b status tbh. wendy_williams_hat.gif\n\n4. Back For More by Glassio (2018)\n\n\"Heaven\" by Bryan Adams\n\nPart used from the original:\n\nBut that's over now\n\nYou keep me comin' back for more\n\nNotes: This band used most of the melody and changed the words and it took me a minute as to why it was so familiar. Lettuce not forget the iconic trance DJ Sammy version.\n\n3. Where U Are by Rina Sawayama (2017)\n\n\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\" by The Jackson 5\n\nPart used from the original:\n\nCan it be I stayed away too long\n\nDid I leave your mind when I was gone\n\nIt's not my thing trying to get back\n\nBut this time let me tell you where I'm at\n\nNotes: A kind of obvious one.\n\n2. Down For You by Kehlani & BJ The Chicago Kid (2015)\n\n\"Just Friends\" by Musiq Soulchild\n\nPart used from the original:\n\nMaybe we can oh\n\nGo and see a movie girl\n\nOr maybe we can hang out girl\n\nWhatever you want to do\n\nJust let me know\n\nIt's up to you\n\nNotes: Kehlani was indie for this mixtape, and yes she might be too obvious of an example as she does this in her songs quite often.\n\n1. All That We Had Is Lost by Postiljonen (2014)\n\n\"How Will I Know\" by Whitney Houston\n\nPart used from the original:\n\nThere's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of\n\nLooks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mmm-hmm\n\nOh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough\n\nWhen I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love\n\n--\n\nOh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now, uh-huh\n\nSaid there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love\n\nNotes: Wig when I recognized this in this hazy ambient song.\n\nHappy Friday! What indie songs give you the throwback feels?\n\nSources: 1234\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: Bops That Almost Went to Other Artists\n\nToday marks the long-delayed (if not really awaited by more than a few) release of Tinashe Kachingwe's sophomore album 'Joyride,' a project that faced an almost mythic amount of obstacles since its announcement in September 2015. In the interim, the \"2 On\" singer released a string of vision-compromising singles, was frustrated to the point of tears on more than one occasion, and lost the title track of her album to pop juggernaut Rihanna.\n\nFortunately for Tinashe, the album for which \"Joyride\" was snatched up (2016's 'Anti') saw its own share of delays and revisions, and she was able to reclaim the song. Hearing it after all the buzz and controversy, though, it's hard not to long for Rihanna's interpretation to leak, and harder still to believe that the song wasn't written with her in mind all along.\n\n\"Joyride\" is hardly the first instance in which a song released by one pop star was written for or recorded by another before being given a pass. Below, a few more cases of pop sloppy seconds and second thoughts.\n\n\"Graffiti My Soul\"\n\nReleased by: Girls Aloud\n\nIntended for: Britney Spears\n\nPraised as one of the highlights of British girl group Girls Aloud's sophomore album 'What Will the Neighbours Say?' (2004), this Xenomania production boasts an ingenious Peplab sample and drew comparisons to the innovative early-2000s sounds of Madonna and The Prodigy. What you may not know is that the song was originally pitched to Team Britney during the sessions for what was arguably Spears' most ambitious project to that point, 2003's eclectic 'In the Zone.' Jive Records loved it, and Britney even recorded a demo - GA member Cheryl recalled Spears' delivery of the line You dream of touching me there being \"strange\" and \"freak[ing] [her] out\" - but it was ultimately passed on in favor of the career-defining \"Toxic.\"\n\n\"Dim All the Lights\"\n\nReleased by: Donna Summer\n\nIntended for: Rod Stewart\n\nThe third single off of the late Queen of Disco's best-selling album 'Bad Girls' (her seventh!) almost never was. Believe it or not Summer, who has sole songwriting credit on \"Dim All the Lights,\" originally intended to give the song to Rod the Mod (this nickname was news to me too). Something inside told her to keep it, though, and it would become the third top five single off of its mother album, peaking at #2. Another fun fact: \"Dim All the Lights\" is noteworthy for containing a note sustained by Summer for a total of 16 seconds.\n\n\"Black Widow\"\n\nReleased by: Iggy Azalea featuring Rita Ora\n\nIntended for: Katy Perry\n\nSomehow it was entirely unsurprising to me to learn that Iggy and Katy are/were friends, but I somehow missed the fact that Iggy's last real hit was a 'Prism' (2013) leftover. The white witches met via a mutual acquaintance at Island Records and became bosom buddies, but attempts at collaboration proved unsuccessful. When Iggy heard \"Black Widow\" and learned that it had been finalized too late to be included on her sis' junior slump, she fought to win it from another (unknown) artist that was set to record it and added her... verses. Rita, as per usual, was an afterthought, and took over for Perry singing the hook she had written. The song peaked at #3 on the Hot 100, and none of the artists involved were seen or heard from again.\n\n\"Boom Clap\"\n\nReleased by: Charli XCX\n\nIntended for: Charli XCX (stay with me), Hilary Duff\n\nThe unofficial theme song from 2014's 'The Fault in Our Stars' sat on the shelf for some time before being included on the film's soundtrack (as well as Charli's sophomore album 'Sucker,' also released that year). Originally composed during the writing sessions for 'True Romance' (2013), the song failed to make the cut. It was then offered to Hilary Duff for what would become 2015's 'Breathe In. Breathe Out.' Duff claimed to never have heard the song, and Charli told V Magazine that Duff's people rejected it for not being \"cool enough\" for the former Disney Channel star: \"So I was like, 'Fuck it. I'm going to sing it.'\"\n\n\"I'm a Slave 4 U\"\n\nReleased by: Britney Spears\n\nIntended for: Janet Jackson\n\nBritney Spears has commonly been considered the Princess to Madonna's Queen of Pop, but more than a fair share of her critics and fans have argued that she owes more to Janet Jackson than the Material Girl. Truth be told, she owes one of her most iconic singles to Damita Jo: the Neptunes pitched \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" to Jackson for 2001's 'All for You,' and an unreleased demo allegedly exists. Ultimately, however, the track went to Britney and changed the public perception of teen pop's reigning Lolita forever, for better or for worse.\n\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nVideos: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nChart positions via Billboard\n\nthere have been a few posts like this but surprisingly none of them included these!\n\n↧\n\nFrom Victoria to Kate: British Royal Brides and Their Gowns (ONTD Original)\n\nIn honor of the upcoming nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, here's a look back at notable British royal brides and the looks they chose for their big days.\n\nQueen Victoria began today’s custom of brides wearing white when she chose this gown, designed by William Dyce and made by seamstress Mary Bettans, to wed her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg on February 10, 1840:\n\nVictoria’s great-grandson Edward VIII abdicated his throne after less than a year to marry “the woman I love”, twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson. They were given the titles of Duke and Duchess of Windsor and married in Paris, where they would live the rest of their lives, on June 3, 1937.\n\nAmerican couturier Mainbocher made the Duchess’ wedding gown in what he dubbed “Wallis Blue”, to match her eyes. Unfortunately, an instability in the dye later caused the gown to lose all of its color, so it is displayed today next to an exact replica in the original shade.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth (now known as Queen Elizabeth II), wed her second cousin once removed, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, on November 20, 1947.\n\nHer gown, by Sir Norman Hartnell, was purchased with rationing coupons because Britain was still suffering severe shortages post-World War II. It was displayed for the couple's 70th wedding anniversary in 2017, having noticeably yellowed with age:\n\nQueen Elizabeth's younger sister Princess Margaret was the first British royal (but hardly the last) to divorce in the 20th century. Like her sister, she wore a gown by Sir Norman Hartnell at her wedding to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones on May 6, 1960. They divorced in 1978:\n\nKatharine Worsley became the Duchess of Kent upon marrying the Queen's first cousin, Prince Edward of Kent, on June 8, 1961. She wore a gown by John Cavanagh.\n\nThe Queen's first cousin, Princess Alexandra, married businessman Angus Ogilvy on April 24, 1963. She wore an all-lace gown (and a matching veil done in the same lace) designed by John Cavanagh.\n\nShortly after the wedding, the royal newlyweds were caught by a paparazzo having sex in a field, and although the Palace made sure the photographs were never published, they quickly became the stuff of legend.\n\nPrincess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, wed army captain Mark Phillips on November 14, 1973, wearing a gown by Maureen Baker. The couple divorced in 1992, and Anne later remarried to her mother's equerry.\n\nLove it or hate it, who could forget the gown that 20-year-old Lady Diana Spencer wore when she wed Prince Charles on July 29, 1981 and became Diana, Princess of Wales? Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, it was the ultimate '80s gown, featuring huge ruffles, giant puffed sleeves and a 25-foot train.\n\nThe marriage ended in an acrimonious separation in 1992 and divorce in 1996, only one year before Diana's death in a Paris car crash at age 36.\n\nPrince Charles finally married his longtime mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles on April 9, 2005. The new Duchess of Cornwall changed from the simple, short white dress and coat that she wore to the private civil ceremony into this grey-and-gold floor-length silk coat over a matching dress ensemble, worn for the blessing afterward. It was designed by the duo of Antonia Robinson and Anna Valentine and she accessorized it with a spray of gold feathers in her hair (which the press rather unkindly suggested looked like straw).\n\nSarah Ferguson wed the Queen's second son, Prince Andrew, on July 23, 1986, and they took the titles Duke and Duchess of York. She wore a gown by Lindka Cierach. The couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996:\n\nSophie Rhys-Jones married Prince Edward, the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, on June 19, 1999. She wore a simple satin gown and silk coat by Samantha Shaw and a black-and-white pearl cross necklace designed by her new husband. They are now known as the Earl and Countess of Wessex, and as of 2018, Edward is the only one of the Queen's children not to have gotten a divorce.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Kent's daughter, Lady Helen Windsor (who had been nicknamed \"Melons\" by the tabloids for her ample bosom) married art dealer Timothy Taylor on July 18, 1992. She wore a gown by Princess Diana's favorite designer, Catherine Walker.\n\nPrincess Margaret's son David Armstrong-Jones, now the Earl of Snowdon and a renowned maker of luxury furniture, wed Serena Stanhope on October 8, 1993. The bride wore a gown by Bruce Bobbins that many people felt resembled her new mother-in-law's own 1960 wedding dress (above):\n\nPrincess Margaret's daughter, Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, wore Jasper Conran to wed actor Daniel Chatto (who had coincidentally played her cousin Prince Andrew in the US television special Charles and Diana: A Royal Love Story) on July 14, 1994.\n\nThe gown that Kate Middleton, now known as the Duchess of Cambridge, wore to marry Charles and Diana's elder son Prince William on April 29, 2011 was designed by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen.\n\nSources: Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor/Me\n\nWhich of the British royal wedding gowns is your favorite, ONTD?\n\n↧\n\nDo You Remember: Forgotten Male Pop Artists of 2000s\n\nSo you got a collab with the biggest rappers.

We're familiar with pop girls who were very of their time, and we can't leave the fellas out either! Whether it's because male pop is inherently dry & beige and only can hold up for so long (counting down for Shawn and *d's time), these men range from one-hit-wonders to those who had a few hits to their name.\n\nJesse McCartney\n\nYou may also know: \"Beautiful #Sole\", \"Because You Live\"\n\nWhere are they now: Still with an active music career and dropped an album in 2014 which no one really knew about.

For the small cost of thousands of dollars, celebs get the privilege of being seen (and heard) by the players on the court; leading to some memorable moments caught on tape. In honor of the NBA Playoffs starting today, here's a list of celebrities that were caught heckling a player:\n\nSpike Lee vs Reggie Miller\n\nWhat happened: In the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, avid Knicks fan and trash-talker, Spike Lee, met his match in Reggie Miller. Miller was having a poor shooting night and it was only made worst by Lee’s jabs, particularly the ones about his sister - Cheryl Miller. (Cheryl was a legendary NCAA player and as the older sister of Reggie, she constantly casted a long shadow over him)\n\nDid it help: No, Miller used Lee’s comments to fuel his motivation, proceeding to score 25 points within the 4th quarter. As the Pacers made their comeback, Miller started to taunt Lee right back; leading to the infamous chock sign and nut grab aimed at Lee and his wife. The NY Daily News’ headline the next day was “Thanks A Lot, Spike.”\n\nDrake vs Justin Holiday\n\nWhat Happened: In the end of a close game between Drake’s Toronto Raptors and the Chicago Bulls, Bull’s player Justin Holiday had 5 seconds to inbound the ball to his teammates when Drake started yapping in his ear.\n\nDid it Help: Yes, Holiday failed to inbound the ball within the allocated time and the ball was turned over to the Raptors. (Though the Raptors did proceed to lose this game anyways)\n\nRihanna vs Kevin Durant\n\nWhat Happened: In the 2017 Finals, Rihanna, a well-known LeBron fan; yelled “Brick” at the opposing team player, Durant, while he was in the middle of shooting a three.\n\nDid it Work: No, Durant made the shot and proceeded to stare down Rihanna.\n\nJack Nicholson vs the Lakers\n\nWhat Happened: Jack Nicholson (and Adam Sandler) the iconic Laker fan, voiced his disgust at his team's level of play by leaving the game early.\n\nDid it Work: Well the Lakers haven't made the playoffs in the past five years...\n\nJimmy Buffett vs the Refs?\n\nWhat Happened: During a close game between the Miami Heats and the NY Knicks, Jimmy Buffett (yes, that Jimmy Buffett) was ejected by the referee. Apparently, Heat fan Buffett is not as mellow as most people would think since the ref found Buffett use of profanities as enough reason to remove him.\n\nDid it Work: Well the Heat did lose that game but Buffett can lord it over Lil Wayne that he was ejected first.\n\nSource: 1234456\n\nWhat was the best heckle you've heard aim at a player?\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: This Was Britney and Christina Fashion\n\nI want to show appreciation to Britney and Christina's fashion senses during their early days, which was quintessential turn of the millennium teeny bopper popstar. It's funny that at one point, people saw this as another dark age for style (and lbr the early '00 was not a good time for 99% of celebs), but now we're at a place to reflect and appreciate all of its vibrant and tacky glory.\n\nHere's a post showing a few moments that this style still lived on in the past decade, mostly through celebs like Charli XCX, Tinashe, Liz, and Rihanna. No, I'm not insinuating they started these trends that were of that time, but we're just gonna look back through their lens. *image heavy, probably not mobile-friendly post*\n\nColored tinted Glasses\n\nTinashe (2017), Drake (2016), Rina Sawayama (2017). Tinted glasses ARE back and even those type of glasses that are too small to be practical.\n\nA cropped corset top\n\nCharli XCX took cues for her \"Doing It\" music video.\n\nBritney's oversized athleisure\n\nLIZ (2013), Rihanna (2015). For when you're feeling very cool and interesting and 'urban'.\n\nChristina's revealing slit moment\n\nTinashe (2018).\n\nSuper hero tank tops\n\nLiz (2015).\n\nFlames\n\nI don't know if Guy Fieri should be accredited to the very graphic Hot Wheel flames when Britney wore it on her 'Oops!' tour in 2000. Rihanna (2017), LIZ (2015), and Kyl*e (2017) followed.\n\nBucket Hats\n\nKehlani (2017), LIZ (2015), Rihanna (2015). Schoolboy Q ain't got nothin on them.\n\nShiny, shiny ensembles\n\nCharli (2014), Bebe Rexha (2016), and Tinashe (2017). Zenon is #quaking.\n\nAnd bandana's...\n\nJorja Smith (2017), Tinashe (2016), Rihanna (2016), and Kylie Jenner (2016) pictured. Caution: this post does NOT encourage or is affiliated with gang activity.\n\nAn honorable mention to R*mney and Tr*mp supporter Trisha Paytas who, whether intentionally or not, can check off taking a few looks from Xtina's \"Come On Over\" music video.\n\nAnd also Gaga when she took note of the early Christina + Britney silhouette in 2011\n\nFashion post? ONTD, what y2k styles are you incorporating into your wardrobe?\n\nSources: 1 / 2 / 3 / me\n\n↧\n\nRoyal Brides of the World and Their Wedding Gowns (An ONTD Original)\n\nThe follow-up to Friday’s post: From Victoria to Kate: British Royal Brides and Their Gowns\n\nWhile the British royals may be best-known to most Westerners, there are royal families in many countries around the world, and they all love a big wedding.\n\nThis list doesn’t begin to cover all royal weddings; as I realized when I started putting together a post about royal wedding gowns a week ago, Europe alone is practically bursting at the seams with bluebloods (hence the splitting off of Great Britain into its own post and the limiting of this one to the 1950s and after).\n\nI've arranged them in alphabetical order by country and used a double cut to save browsers:\n\nBELGIUM\n\nMathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz became Princess Mathilde, Duchess of Brabant when she wed Crown Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant on December 4, 1999, and was one of the few winter brides among the royals of Europe. Her satin coat-and-dress combo was by Edouard Vermeulen.\n\nBHUTAN\n\nKing Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck wed Jetsun Pema on October 13, 2011 at 8:20 a.m., the time set by royal astrologers. Jetsun chose her raw silk kira (the national dress for Bhutanese women) from among several made by prominent weavers in the country, while King Jigme wore the same rose-patterned gho that his father and grandfather had worn at their weddings.\n\nDENMARK\n\nPrincess Margrethe, the future queen of Denmark, married French diplomat Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat on June 10, 1967, wearing a gown by royal couturier Jørgen Bender. She pinned a diamond daisy brooch on the bodice (“Daisy” being her family’s nickname for her).\n\nWhen the gown was displayed in Copenhagen in 2015, it appeared unembellished because the large piece of historic lace that had trimmed the front when she wore it had long since been removed to be used on other royal wedding dresses.\n\nPrince Joachim, the younger of Queen Margrethe's two sons, met Alexandra Manley (left) in Hong Kong, where she was born and raised, and married her on November 18, 1995. The bride wore a gown by Jørgen Bender, who had designed her new mother-in-law's wedding gown 28 years earlier. They divorced in 2005.\n\nPrince Joachim then got married for a second time, to Marie Cavallier (right) on May 4, 2008. The bride wore Arasa Morelli.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik married Australian Mary Donaldson on May 14, 2004. Her gown, by Uffe Frank, reportedly had the wedding ring of her mother (who had died in 1997) stitched into the lining near her heart.\n\nGERMANY\n\nPrince Christian of Hanover (son of Ernst August, Prince of Hanover, and stepson of Monaco's Princess Caroline) wed lawyer and former model Alessandra de Osma in her native Peru last month, March 16, 2018. The bride wore Jorge Vázquez.\n\nGREECE\n\nNote: King Constantine II was deposed in 1967 and the monarchy was abolished in Greece in 1973, but the family continue to use their royal titles in exile.\n\nEnglishwoman Marie-Chantal Miller, the daughter of a billionaire, married King Constantine's eldest son Prince Pavlos in London on July 1, 1995. Marie-Chantal's Valentino gown reportedly cost $225,000 and took 25 people four months to complete by hand.\n\nJAPAN\n\nCrown Prince (now Emperor) Akihito wed Harvard-and-Oxford-educated Michiko Shōda, the first commoner ever to marry into the Japanese Imperial family, on April 10, 1959. Michiko's jūni-hitoe, which literally means 'twelve-layered garment', weighed 30 pounds and took nearly two hours to arrange properly. She wore a white gown for the traditional \"First Audience\" ceremony before her new mother-and-father-in-law later that day.\n\nCrown Prince Naruhito, elder son of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, married Harvard-and-Oxford-educated Masako Owada on June 9, 1993. Masako had been reluctant to give up her promising diplomatic career and turned down the persistent prince's first two proposals before finally agreeing to marry him. The jūni-hitoe she wore for the traditional Shinto ceremony cost more than $300,000 and was designed by Hanae Mori.\n\nSadly, Masako has been subjected to a great deal of criticism for failing to produce a male heir (she had a daughter, Aiko, in 2001, after experiencing an earlier miscarriage, but only males can ascend the Japanese throne) and, suffering from severe depression, has rarely been seen in public for over 15 years.\n\nJORDAN\n\nAmerican-born Lisa Halaby would forever after be known as Queen Noor al-Hussein (\"Light of Hussein\") after she became King Hussein I's fourth wife on June 15, 1978. Her Bohemian '70s gown was by Dior.\n\nKing Hussein's eldest son, Prince Abdullah, proposed to Palestinian-born Rania al Yassin only two months after meeting her. They wed on June 10, 1993, with the bride in a gown by British designer Bruce Oldfield. They became King and Queen of Jordan in 1999.\n\nLIECHTENSTEIN\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Luxembourg was well-covered in her Balmain gown when she married Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein on March 20, 1982. It was the last wedding to join two reigning royal houses of Europe, a practice that was once the standard for royal marriages.\n\nIt was the tail-end of the 80s and big shoulders were finally on their way out, but the Paris-born Princess Marie de France wasn't about to let them go without a fight. She married Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein on July 29, 1989, amid a nasty family feud over the site of the wedding and who would walk her down the aisle that saw half of her family boycott the ceremony (and publicly urge other royals to do the same). I haven't been able to discover the designer of this gown, so if anyone knows, I'll add it to the post.\n\nPanama-born Angela Brown became the first person of known African descent to marry into European royalty when she wed Prince Maximilian on January 29, 2000. The new Princess Angela, a graduate of New York’s famed Parsons School of Design, designed her own gown and accessorized it with her new in-laws' Kinsky Honeysuckle Tiara at the New York religious ceremony.\n\nLUXEMBOURG\n\nPrince Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, wed Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy of Belgium (left) on October 20, 2012, with the bride in Elie Saab.\n\nGuillaume’s younger brother Prince Felix married German bioethics researcher Claire Lademacher (right) on September 21, 2013. Like her sister-in-law Princess Stephanie the year before, Claire chose Elie Saab to design her gown, and some critics found their looks a bit too similar.\n\nMONACO\n\nAmerican film star Grace Kelly became Princess Grace when she wed Prince Rainier III of Monaco on April 19, 1956, wearing a gown by Hollywood costume designer Helen Rose, who had designed her outfits for the movies High Society and The Swan.\n\nThey remained married until Grace's tragic death in 1982, when she suffered a minor stroke while driving and lost control of her car, which plunged over the side of a steep mountain road.\n\nPrincess Grace and Prince Rainier's son, Prince Albert II, wed South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock on July 2, 2011. The new Princess Charlene wore Armani.\n\nTHE NETHERLANDS\n\nFor her February 2, 2002 wedding to Queen Beatrix's son, Crown Prince (now King) Willem-Alexander, Argentinean banker Máxima Zorreguieta chose a gown by Valentino. They became King and Queen upon Beatrix’ abdication in 2013.\n\nWillem-Alexander’s little bro Prince Friso was struck from the royal line of succession for marrying Mabel Wisse Smit on April 24, 2004 without the consent of Parliament (the Dutch cabinet refused to seek such permission due to Mabel’s past as the girlfriend of a known Dutch drug lord, and the fact that they believed she lied when questioned about it). Friso and Mabel were later embarrassed when it was revealed that they themselves had been editing Mabel’s Wikipedia entry to gloss over her past.\n\nPrincess Mabel’s oft-mocked Viktor & Rolf wedding dress featured 248 crepe georgette bows, including a big old bunch weirdly placed on the end of the train. Prince Friso was buried in an avalanche while skiing in 2012 and slipped into a coma before dying a year later.\n\nPrince Floris, the son of Princess Margriete, married Aimée Söhngen on October 22, 2005. Lidy de Joode designed the royal bride's minimalist gown.\n\nNORWAY\n\nCrown Prince Harald was expected to make a royal match with a European princess for his bride, but he fell in love with a commoner he met at a party, Sonja Haraldsen. For nine years, their relationship was something of an open secret as he rejected every suggestion for a royal bride. He reportedly finally gave his father, King Olav V, an ultimatum: if he couldn’t marry Sonja, he would stay single forever and therefore could never produce a legitimate heir.\n\nSince Harald was the only male heir to the Norwegian throne, Olav relented and not only gave consent for the union, but walked Sonja down the aisle himself as a public show of support. Sonja wore a gown by Oslo clothing store Molstad at their wedding on August 29, 1968. They became King and Queen upon Olav’s death in 1991.\n\nMette-Marit Tjessem Høiby was an unexpected choice of bride for Harald and Sonja’s son, Crown Prince Haakon. Not only was the ex-waitress a commoner, but she was the single mother of a four-year-old son and she was forced to make a tearful public apology before the wedding for her party-girl past. Nonetheless, the couple wed on August 25, 2001, with Mette-Marit in a gown by Ove Harder Finseth.\n\nPORTUGAL\n\nNote: Like Greece, above, Portugal no longer has a monarchy, it having been dissolved in the 1910 revolution. But a number of Portuguese people from once-noble families continue to unofficially use their ancestral titles.\n\nDona Diana Álvares Pereira de Melo, the Duchess of Cadaval wed Prince Charles Philippe d'Orléans, a grandson of the Orleanist pretender to the French throne, Henri, on June 21, 2008. She wore Carolina Herrera.\n\nSPAIN\n\nCrown Prince (now King) Felipe wed television newswoman Letizia Ortiz on May 22, 2004, with the bride in a gown by Manuel Pertegaz that was embroidered with real gold.\n\nSWEDEN\n\nEven royals love a two-for-one bargain. Princess Birgitta had a gown made by Märtaskolan, a dressmaking school, for her wedding to Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern on May 25, 1961 (left). Three years later, Birgitta's younger sister Princess Désirée simply wore the same dress for her own June 5, 1964 wedding to Baron Niclas Silfverschiöld.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria, the eldest of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia’s three offspring, wore Par Engsheden when she married her former personal trainer, Daniel Westling, on June 19, 2010. She accessorized with the pearl-and-gold Cameo Tiara, which was originally a gift from the Emperor Napoleon to his wife Josephine around 1809.\n\nBecause not only are the Swedes the hotties of European royalty, they also get the best tiaras.\n\nVictoria’s younger sister Princess Madeleine married British-born American financier Christopher O’Neill on June 8, 2013. Her gown was designed by Valentino Garavani. She wore her favorite tiara, the diamond Modern Fringe (which can also be transformed into a necklace).\n\nSofia Heliqvist was a controversial choice of bride for King Carl and Queen Silvia’s only son, Prince Carl-Philippe, due to her career as a semi-nude model and reality show contestant. Nonetheless, the couple married on June 13, 2015, with the new Princess Sofia wearing a gown by Ida Sjöstedt. She showed off a generous wedding gift from her new in-laws: a new emerald-and-diamond tiara. The emeralds can be interchanged with pearls for a more subtle look.\n\nSources: Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor/Me\n\nMy favorite royal wedding gowns are those worn by Marie-Chantal of Greece and Maxima of the Netherlands.

Sometimes, they just want a day out and about without having to be hounded by the general public, fans, and chased by paparazzi when they don't call them on themselves. But such is the price to pay for fame. Today, we'll be rating five celebrities that snapped at the general public. Sometimes to fans, the paparazzi or even mouthy residents of a city to defend their big sister! I'm temporarily reviving MTV's Boiling Points here to measure just how red these celebs get - but we're not setting a time limit. We'll spin the concept into a BP thermometer and rate it. Shall we proceed?\n\nIan Somerhalder: “You guys, listen. No no, stop! Everybody listen! I love you guys, I'm not taking a single photo today. It's my day. Don't follow us. Please! I love you guys, you're so good to us. You're so awesome. Do not follow us okay? This is too much.”\n\nBoilingPoint™ Rating:\n\nTwink of Pop™ Shawn Mendes: “Because people like you! You sell this. Signatures! Yeah, so what'd you just tell me? Did you sell the signatures or not? [Man: No, it's for my sister] Say swear to god. So how old is your sister? And what's her name? Can you call your sister then for me?” And basically, this exchange goes on for a while longer but you get the idea.\n\nBoilingPoint™ Rating:\n\nJamie Lynn Spears defending big sis Britney Spears:\n\nLos Angeles Resident: “Nobody wants you in this neighborhood! You’re making the neighborhood unsafe!”\n\nJamie Lynn Spears: “Well then move the fuck out!”\n\nThe boiling point may be high, but it was for a good cause and to defend her big sis during a rough patch in her life. Jamie Lynn Spears is not the one to be trifled with.\n\nBoilingPoint™ Rating:\n\nJustin Bieber: Biebs doesn't say much. During his visit to Argentina, fans give the Biebs a flag from Argentina...he then throws it out the window. He may not have said much or verbally lost his cool here, but the disrespect is high and real.\n\nBoilingPoint™ Rating:\n\nHalsey: “Listen very quick, not for nothing but I'm getting a lot of really rude messages right now from people saying that I'm fucked up, that I swear you, and I'm being rude, and I'm being mean like not for nothing but, I've been in press since eight o'clock in the morning! I have a whole day of interviews to do, I'm still doing them. I would never just walk by you and not meet you so to abuse me like that online is kinda fucked up! I have a lot more interviews to do and I promise I'm going to meet people but please don't be mean to me! I have a very busy day too okay? So it really makes me upset, please don't be mean to me!”\n\nHonestly, the good sis Halsey just wanted a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Fair enough.\n\nBoilingPoint™ Rating:\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: 5 Coachella Performers You Should Have Checked Out (But Probably Didn't)\n\nSprinkled among the big names of Coachella this year were some lesser known acts that put on a great show and introduced their sound to a much wider audience through the festival live stream.

Mauricio, on the other hand, is never informed that the rich heiress is locked up in an asylum.

Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation’s history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo’s firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.\n\nIn 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo’s past—memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilde, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.\n\nBased on those interviews, featuring Cudjo’s unique vernacular, and written from Hurston’s perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon brilliantly illuminates the tragedy of slavery and one life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.\n\nThe Cemetery Keeper's Wife by Maryann McFadden\n\nHISTORICAL FICTION > Mystery\n\nExpected publication: May 8th\n\nRachel Miller is on the cusp of a new life when she moves to Union Cemetery after marrying Adam, the 7th generation cemetery keeper.

Well back in my day we didn't have those types of books. There was an interesting pocket of fiction pre-teen and teen girls loved in the mid-to-late 90s, and most of these books were written by one author: LURLENE MCDANIEL.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, Lurlene wrote a ton of books about teen girls. These books had one detail in common: they were all about straight white people. Ok, two things in common: EVERYONE DIED. These books were ALL about people with cancer and people in horrible accidents and everyone died and was miserable. Hearts were broken, lives were ruined before they had a chance to start, and we, the readers, LOVED IT.\n\nAll that being said, I have a few personal standouts from the collection. I bring you the 5 saddest books Lurlene McDaniel has written.\n\n5. Till Death Do Us Part 18 year old April has been suffering from headaches and fainting spells and enters the hospital for testing. There she meets the handsome Mark Gianni, a 21 year old with cystic fibrosis. While they both have feelings for each other, April has a jerk of a boyfriend who ruins everything. When April learns the seriousness of her condition(inoperable brain tumor, obviously)everything changes. Will April and Mark get together?(Yes, duh)Will one of them die?(Yes, duh)Who won the beach vacation?(idk)\n\n4. Six Months to Live (Dawn Rochelle #1) At just 13, Dawn's diagnosed with leukemia. While going through treatment she meets another girl fighting cancer, Sandy. They both go into remission and all seems to be alright...until Sandy gets sick again. Will Sandy live?(Nope)Will Dawn's cancer come back?(Not in this book)\n\n3. She Died Too Young (One Last Wish #9) The One Last Wish series followed a group of girls with life-threatening illnesses, and while they were all really depressing this one really packed a punch. Chelsea is a teenager who needs a heart transplant to live. While waiting for her transplant she meets a girl named Jillian who also needs a heart transplant. So they're waiting for a heart that only one of them can get, and the other one will likely die. There's also a subplot with Chelsea wanting to bone Jillian's hot twin brother Josh but come on Lurlene, we have more important things to worry about.\n\nWill Chelsea get a heart transplant?(Yup)What about Jillian?(Nope, RIP)Will Chelsea and Josh get together?(Who cares he sucks)\n\n2. Don't Die, My Love Julie and Luke are high school sweethearts who are madly in love and planning their future together. A happy young couple without a care in the world? Not in McDaniel's world. Luke comes down with a flu that won't go away(Cancer, obviously). What does this mean for the young couple's future?(NOT GOOD THINGS)\n\n1. The Angels Series As I always do when I make lists I'm completely cheating by putting a series on here. So while our girl Lurlene wrote some depressing stories, they all seem to end with kind of a \"good things can come out of horrible situations\" message. Not the motherfuckin' Angels trilogy, no sir. This series teaches you that everyone you care about will die and love isn't real and existence is pain.\n\nLeah goes into the hospital with what she suspects is a broken finger, but finds out she has leukemia. While in the hospital her roommate is a little Amish girl named Rebekah. Rebekah has an older brother named Ethan who is FIIIIINE and Leah is all over. Then an angel randomly shows up and cures them but no one really cares about that lbr.\n\nThat all sounds nice and wholesome, right? Except after that first book everything explodes.Rebekah dies when she gets run over by a fucking TRACTOR, which shakes up the entire family. Ethan has his Rumspringa and moves in with Leah and her family, and they start seriously dating.

When I start watching a show, I rarely stop watching it until its finale, but some shows just became too ridiculous to waste my time on, and some…well…didn’t last long enough for me to give up on them lmao\n\n.\n\nHere are some of the examples:\n\n1. The Vampire Diaries\n\nWhat it could have been: A fun fantasy show about a strong-willed, smart girl with moral compass who falls for a vegan vampire, solving new mysteries and murders in the city, fighting bad vampires and other creatures while keeping that humanity within herself (you know, a more interesting version of Twilight with a main character who isn’t dumb), with an actual compelling villain that Damon should have been and was at some point, and for one the main girl NOT falling for someone who fucking killed her brother (but happened to be lucky since the dude was wearing a ring that will bring him back to life later, but Damon didn’t know that.) It would have been nice for a main character not to go against her word because of a dick but oh well….\n\nWhat we got: A show where Julie Plec was living vicariously through Caroline who had to fuck every character on the show, and the whole show became about who’s fucking whom, when in first 2 seasons there were actual mysteries. People getting resurrected at every turn, no stakes etc. Also, the only black main character was neglected up until last season where she got somewhat of a storyline but in the end had to settle down with a tryhard like Enzo. Damon/Elena fandom was too loud and the writers instead of following their own vision for the show, kept trying to please them which ruined both of the characters in the process.\n\n2. Arrow\n\nWhat it could have been: A superhero show with a compelling storyline, great villains, strong female characters etc.\n\nWhat we got: No chemistry between the leads, the female lead getting fridged instead of getting her own badass arc, whole season 3, Malcolm not dying when he should have, villains not staying dead, pathetic Deathstroke etc.\n\n3. Selfie\n\nWhat it could have been: A cute sitcom with a non-stereotypical Asian co-lead.\n\nWhat we got: Cancellation.\n\n4. Pretty Little Liars\n\nWhat it could have been: An actually captivating teen mystery show with a hot lesbian main pairing.\n\nWhat we got: Every possible shit you can imagine.\n\n5. Impastor\n\nWhat it could have been: What it actually was. A really funny and unique sitcom that makes you laugh out loud like most of the sitcoms (apart from B99) nowadays can’t.\n\nWhat we got: Cancellation after a major fucking cliffhanger. Fuck you, TVLand.\n\n6. Glee\n\nWhat it could have been: A somewhat dark teen comedy with great singing and engaging storylines, doing what other shows were afraid of doing.\n\nWhat we got: Darren Criss. (jk, we got much much worse)\n\n7. Gossip Girl\n\nWhat it could have been: A teen drama to fill the void the O.C left, but with better storylines, hotter characters and better fashion, centered around a female friendship.\n\nWhat we got: Scumbags being rewarded for being scumbags and women being weak as fuck. Also launching of Ed Westwick’s shitty career.\n\n8. The Originals\n\nWhat it could have been: A period piece about an Original family of vampires strolling around being badass in great costumes.\n\nWhat we got: A show centered around a whiny pony-drawing main character in modern times pining after blondes.\n\n9. Suits\n\nWhat it could have been: A show to fill the void Boston Legal left but with hotter main characters, more racially diverse cast and less misogyny.\n\nWhat we got: A stupid soap opera with lawyers. (and I guess....a royal wedding??)\n\n10. Once Upon A Time\n\nWhat it could have been: A family friendly show with a well-crafted storylines that stay true to the fairytale characters they use, centered around a strong female character.\n\nWhat we got: A nonsensical mess.\n\nHonorable mentions: How I Met Your Mother, SMASH, The Gates, Supergirl, Teen Wolf, Legends of Tomorrow, Bad Teacher, Witches of East End, Telenovela, Misfits, Go On, Devious Maids, Dirty Sexy Money, Samantha Who, Pitch etc.\n\nObviously my memory is at this point a little foggy when it comes to all the storylines I hated on these shows but I’ve made this post to spark up a discussion, I’m fully aware not everyone will agree with my choices, so comment away about what you thought should have been done better and which shows had wasted potential, what were the worst storylines, where and why did the writers go wrong, without being rude, please.\n\nsource: my useless PhD in tv show watching\n\n↧\n\nIndie Release Guide: April 20th [An ONTD Original]\n\nThis week sees the arrival of I Feel Pretty, Super Troopers 2 (because 4/20, do you get it?!?), and Traffik in wide release.

Despite a public history of hetero relationships (even derailing her career by sleeping with the married male director of her film Snow White & The Huntsman), Stewart claimed the gay label during her SNL opening monologue in 2017. Lest you worry about invalidating her ⭐lesbianism, she does identify as bisexual.\n\nCynthia Nixon has made a lot of statements about her sexuality. Though she admits that \"the technically precise term for [her] orientation is bisexual\" (and once believed \"we’re all bisexual”), she now shies away from the word, claiming that lesbians get more respect for their same-sex attraction than bisexual women do. Cynthia, who has also called herself \"gay as a political stance,\" continues to use the lesbian moniker in her campaign for governor of New York.\n\nI gave a speech recently, an empowerment speech to a gay audience, and it included the line \"I’ve been straight and I’ve been gay, and gay is better.\" And they tried to get me to change it because they said it implies that homosexuality can be a choice. And for me, it is a choice. I understand that for many people it’s not, but for me, it’s a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me.\n\nI am very annoyed about this issue. Why can't it be a choice? Why is that any less legitimate? I don't pull out the \"bisexual\" word because nobody likes the bisexuals. Everybody likes to dump on the bisexuals... We get no respect.\n\nBethany Meyers is a self-identified lesbian who recently wed actor Nico Tortorella, her male romantic and sexual partner of 11 years. They have been together since Bethany was 16 years old and consider one another each others' husbands and wives. In September 2017, the couple appeared on the cover of The Advocate with the headline \"Yes, This Is a Queer Family.\"\n\nBonus. Nico identifies as bisexual and genderqueer. On whether 'pansexual' would be a more accurate label: \"The B in LGBTQ+ has been fought for, for so long. I’m not going to be the person that’s like, ‘No, I need a P, I need another letter!’ I stand by people that have paved this way for somebody like me.”\n\nMichael Stipe considers himself \"80% gay,\" someone who is attracted to both men and women but prefers men most of the time. “I hate and refuse to apply the term bisexual to myself. It doesn’t seem appropriate. It feels like just another label.”\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Michelle Rodriquez made a point to distance herself from the lesbian label after being included on the cover of Curve without her knowledge (which many fans took as her coming out). She said the misconception that she's gay could hurt her career.\n\nThere are certain things that can close doors between a celebrity and certain audiences…If I were Ellen [DeGeneres] I may get away with the ‘I’m gay’ level of exposure, but I’m not a comedian, I like men (real ones anyway) and I’ve only been in this business for seven years, not 20.\n\nMichelle later came out as bisexual, saying \"Eventually it's going to wrinkle up and I won't be able to use it. I wanted to be honest about who I am and see what happens.\"\n\nQueen Gillian Anderson, proud bisexual, speculated that her experience as a young woman was easier than a lesbian girl's because she still had a place in hetero society.\n\nI was in a relationship with a girl for a long time when I was in high school... If I had thought I was 100% gay, would it have been a different experience for me? Would it have been a bigger deal if shame had been attached to it and all those things that become huge life-altering issues for youngsters in that situation? It’s possible that my attitude around it came, on some level, from knowing that I still liked boys.\n\nIt wasGore Vidal's family that insisted on labeling him gay despite his identifying as bisexual. In this case, though, his family may have been right. Vidal, who was born in 1925, believed'gay' could only be used to describe sex acts and not a person's identityor orientation. For someone of his generation, 'gay' referred only to men perceived as weak because of their 'femininity' (including being the penetrated partner); Vidal was a socially and physically powerful man who reportedly always topped.\n\nClassical history major side note: This is somewhat similar to the ancient Greek understanding "
