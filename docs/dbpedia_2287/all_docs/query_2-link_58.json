On the River Inn, at its junction with the Wipp Valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass 30 km (19 mi) to the south, it had a population of 132,493 in 2018.\n\nIn the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, 2,334 metres or 7,657 feet) to the north and Patscherkofel (2,246 m or 7,369 ft) and Serles (2,718 m or 8,917 ft) to the south, Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. It also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The name means \"bridge over the Inn\".[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAntiquity\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.\n\nThe first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180.[4] In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol.[5] The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps. It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.\n\nIn 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tyrol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a stirps of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).\n\nThe university was founded in 1669. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.[clarification needed]\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province.[6]\n\nThe Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.\n\nDuring World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On 20 February 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded.[7] In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.[8]\n\nIn 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.\n\nAnnexation and World War II\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. During World War II, Innsbruck was the location of two subcamps of the Dachau concentration camp, including a special camp for prominent people from 16 countries and their families, who were held as hostages, including former Prime Minister of France Léon Blum, former regent of Hungary Miklós Horthy, former Chancellor of Austria Kurt Schuschnigg, Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi II and a nephew of Winston Churchill.[9] Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.\n\nEuroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) using 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm or oceanic climate (Cfb) using the original −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm[10] since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains. Winters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.\n\nSpring is brief; days start to get warm, often over 15 °C (59 °F), but nights remain cool or even freezing.\n\nSummer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool 17 °C (63 °F) and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting 34 °C (93 °F). In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being 12 °C (54 °F) on average, but sometimes dipping as low as 6 °C (43 °F).\n\nThe average annual temperature is 9 °C (48 °F).\n\nBoroughs and statistical divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages.[20] These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (Statistischer Bezirk) and 178 numbered blocks (Zählsprengel).[21]\n\nThe following are the nine boroughs with the population as of 31 October 2011:[22]\n\nInnsbruck (inner city) (18.524), consisting of Oldtown (Altstadt), Dreiheiligen-Schlachthof, and Saggen\n\nWilten (15.772), consisting of Mentlberg, Sieglanger, and Wilten West\n\nPradl (30.890), consisting of Pradler-Saggen, Reichenau, and Tivoli\n\nHötting (31.246), consisting of Höttinger Au, Hötting West, Sadrach, Allerheiligen, Kranebitten, and part of Hungerburg\n\nMühlau (4.750), consisting of part of Hungerburg\n\nAmras (5.403), consisting of Roßau\n\nArzl (10.293), consisting of Neuarzl and Olympisches Dorf\n\nVill (535)\n\nIgls (2.204)\n\nPlaces of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nMountains\n\n[edit]\n\nNordkette\n\nPatscherkofel\n\nBuildings and monuments\n\n[edit]\n\nOld Inn Bridge (Alte Innbrücke)\n\nAmbras Castle\n\nAndreas Hofer's tomb\n\nSt. Anne's Column (Annasäule)\n\nBergisel Ski Jump\n\nBüchsenhausen Castle\n\nCanisianum\n\nCasino\n\nCity Hall (Stadtsaal)\n\nGolden Roof (Goldenes Dachl)\n\nHelbling House (Helblinghaus)\n\nImperial Palace (Hofburg)\n\nHungerburgbahn\n\nLeopold Fountain (Leopoldsbrunnen)\n\nMaria-Theresien-Straße\n\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men (Schwarzen Männer)\n\nOld Federal State Parliament (Altes Landhaus)\n\nOld Town (Altstadt)\n\nSilver Chapel (Silberne Kapelle)\n\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\n\nTriumphal Arch (Triumphpforte)\n\nTyrolean State Theatre\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpine Club Museum\n\nAmbras Castle\n\nArmoury\n\nCity Archives\n\nGrassmayr Bell Foundry and Museum\n\nInnsbruck Stubaital station\n\nKaiserjäger Museum\n\nTyrol Panorama Museum (Das Tirol Panorama)\n\nTyrolean Folk Art Museum (Tiroler Volkunstmuseum)\n\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum or Ferdinandeum)\n\nTyrolean Museum Railways (Tiroler Museumsbahnen)\n\nChurches\n\n[edit]\n\nCourt Church (Hofkirche)\n\nInnsbruck Cathedral (Dom zu St. Jakob)\n\nOld Ursuline Church\n\nJesuit Church\n\nChurch of Our Lady\n\nChurch of Our Lady of Perpectual Succour\n\nServite Church\n\nHospital Church\n\nUrsuline Church\n\nWilten Abbey (Stift Wilten)\n\nWilten Basilica (Wiltener Basilika)\n\nHoly Trinity Church\n\nSt. John's Church\n\nSt. Theresa's Church (Hungerburg)\n\nPradler Parish Church\n\nSt. Paul's State Memorial Church in the Reichenau\n\nEvangelical Church of Christ\n\nEvangelical Church of the Resurrection\n\nOld Höttingen Parish Church\n\nHöttingen Parish Church\n\nParish Church of St. Nicholas\n\nParish Church of Neu-Arzl\n\nParish Church of St. Norbert\n\nParish Church of Maria am Gestade\n\nParish Church of the Good Shepherd\n\nParish Church of St. George\n\nParish Church of St. Paul\n\nParish Church of St. Pirminius\n\nChurch of the Guardian Angel\n\nParks and gardens\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpine Zoo (Alpenzoo)\n\nBaggersee Innsbruck\n\nInnsbruck University Botanic Garden\n\nHofgarten (Court Garden)\n\nRapoldi-Weiher Park\n\nAmbras Castle Park (Schlosspark Ambras)\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nAmbras Castle\n\nArmoury\n\nCity Tower (Stadtturm)\n\nHelblinghaus\n\nInnsbruck from the Inn river (looking towards Nordkette)\n\nMaximilian's Cenotaph and the Black Men in the Court Church\n\nOld Town (Altstadt) with the Goldenes Dachl\n\nSiebenkreuzkapelle\n\nTyrolean State Museum (Tiroler Landesmuseum)\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe results of the 2018 local elections were:\n\nAustrian Green Party 24.16% (left)\n\nFreedom Party of Austria 18.56% (right)\n\nFür Innsbruck 16.15% (conservative)\n\nAustrian People's Party 12.17% (conservative)\n\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria 10.32% (left)\n\nNEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum 4.73% (center)\n\nBürgerforum Tirol – Liste Fritz (FRITZ) 3.23%\n\nGerechtes Innsbruck (Gerecht) 3.10%\n\nTiroler Seniorenbund – Für Alt und Jung (TSB) 2.72%\n\nAlternative Liste Innsbruck (ALI) 2.38%\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nCultural events\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck is a very popular tourist destination, organizing the following events every year:\n\nInnsbrucker Tanzsommer\n\nBergsilvester (New Year's Eve)\n\nInnsbrucker Festwochen der Alten Musik (Innsbruck Festival of Early Music)\n\nLos Gurkos Short Film Festival[24]\n\nChristkindlmarkt (Christmas fair)\n\nIn 1971, author Douglas Adams was inspired to write the internationally successful The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series while lying intoxicated in a field in Innsbruck.[25] From 2003 onwards each year Towel Day is celebrated worldwide on 25 May.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for skiing in winter, ski-jumping and mountaineering in summer. There are several ski resorts around Innsbruck, with the Nordkette served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include Axamer Lizum, Muttereralm, Patscherkofel, Igls, Seefeld, Tulfes and Stubai Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.\n\nThe Winter Olympic Games were held in Innsbruck twice, first in 1964, then again in 1976, when Colorado voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the Denver games, originally awarded in 1970. The 1976 Winter Olympics were the last games held in the German-speaking Alps (Austria, Germany, or Switzerland).\n\nAlong with St. Moritz, Switzerland and Lake Placid, New York in the United States, it is one of three places which have twice hosted the Winter Games. It also hosted the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics.\n\nInnsbruck hosted the 1st Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012.[26]\n\nOther notable events held in Innsbruck include the Air & Style Snowboard Contest from 1994 to 1999 and 2008 and the Ice Hockey World Championship in 2005. Together with the city of Seefeld, Innsbruck organized the Winter Universiade in 2005. Innsbruck's Bergiselschanze is one of the hills of the famous Four Hills Tournament.\n\nInnsbruck is home to football clubs WSG Tirol and FC Wacker Innsbruck, who play in the Austrian Bundesliga and the Austrian Landesliga respectively. Former teams include the FC Swarovski Tirol and FC Tirol Innsbruck. The teams' stadium, Tivoli Neu, is one of eight stadiums which hosted Euro 2008, which took place in Switzerland and Austria in June 2008.\n\nThe city is home to the American football team Raiders Tirol. Innsbruck hosted an American football final, Eurobowl XXII between the Swarco Raiders Tirol and the Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna.\n\nThe city hosted opening round games in the 2011 IFAF World Championship, the official international American Football championship.\n\nIn 2018 Innsbruck hosted the IFSC Climbing World Championships 2018 from 6 to 16 September and the 2018 UCI Road World Championships from 22 to 30 September.[27]\n\nLanguage\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck is part of the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects and, more specifically, Southern Bavarian (Südbairisch).[28] Irina Windhaber, professor for linguistics at the Universität Innsbruck, has observed a trend among young people to choose more often Standard German language structures and pronunciation.[29]\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck is a substantial tourist centre, with more than a million overnight stays.\n\nIn Innsbruck, there are 86,186 employees and about 12,038 employers. 7,598 people are self-employed.[30] Nearly 35,000 people commute every day into Innsbruck from the surrounding communities in the area. The unemployment rate for the year 2012 was 4.2%.[31]\n\nThe national statistics office, Statistik Austria, does not produce economic data for the City of Innsbruck alone, but on aggregate level with the Innsbruck-Land District summarized as NUTS 3-region Innsbruck. In 2013, GDP per capita in the NUTS 3-region Innsbruck was €41,400 which is around 60% above the EU average.[32]\n\nThe headquarters of Tiroler Wasserkraft (Tiwag, energy production), Bank für Tirol und Vorarlberg (financial services), Tiroler Versicherung (insurance) and MED-EL (medical devices) are located in Innsbruck. The headquarters of Swarovski (glass), Felder Group (mechanical engineering) and Swarco (traffic technology) are located within 20 km (12 mi) from the city.\n\nResidential property is very expensive by national standards. The average price per square meter in Innsbruck is €4,430 (2015), which is the second highest per square meter price among Austrian cities surpassed only by Salzburg (€4,823), but followed by Vienna (€3,980).[33]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck is located along the A12/A13 highway corridor (Inn Valley Autobahn and Brenner Autobahn respectively), providing freeway access to Verona, Italy and Munich, Germany. The A12 and A13 converge near Innsbruck, at which point the A13 terminates.\n\nInnsbruck Hauptbahnhof, the most important railway station of Innsbruck and Tyrol, is one of the busiest railway stations in Austria. It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner Pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.\n\nInnsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations. During the winter, activity increases significantly, due to the high number of skiers travelling to the region. The airport is approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the centre of Innsbruck.\n\nLocal public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes. The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: line 6, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line STB, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and Völs in the west. Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.\n\nIn December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension under the Inn River and into central Innsbruck. The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city.[34] The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour.[35] It is operated by a private company, the 'Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen'.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nInnsbruck is a university city, with several locally based colleges and universities.\n\nInnsbruck is home to the oldest grammar school (Gymnasium) of Western Austria, the \"Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck\". The school was founded in 1562 by the Jesuit order and was the precursor of the university, founded in 1669.\n\nInnsbruck hosts several universities. The most well-known are the University of Innsbruck (Leopold-Franzens-Universität), the Innsbruck Medical University, and the university of applied sciences MCI Management Center Innsbruck.\n\nOrganizations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe international headquarters of SOS Children's Villages, one of the world's largest charities, is located in Innsbruck.\n\nThe internationally active NGO Austrian Service Abroad was founded in Innsbruck in 1992 by Andreas Maislinger and Andreas Hörtnagl. Its central office is located at Hutterweg, Innsbruck.\n\nInnsbruck has two universities, the Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck and the Innsbruck Medical University. The Innsbruck Medical University has one of Europe's premier ski injury clinics.\n\nThe international headquarters of MED-EL, one of the largest producers of cochlear implants, is located in Innsbruck.\n\nThe Aouda.X space suit simulator is being developed by the OeWF in Innsbruck. Also, the Mission Support Centre for many of the OeWF Mars analogue missions is situated in the city. This MSC used time delayed communication with Camp Weyprecht in the desert near Erfoud, Morocco for the MARS2013 expedition during February 2013.\n\nNotable residents\n\n[edit]\n\nMonarchy and aristocracy\n\n[edit]\n\nFrederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (1415–1493), Holy Roman Emperor from 1452 until his death, the first emperor of the House of Habsburg.[36]\n\nMargaret of Austria, Electress of Saxony (c. 1416–1486), member of the House of Habsburg, was Electress of Saxony 1431–1464 by her marriage with the Wettin elector Frederick II.
