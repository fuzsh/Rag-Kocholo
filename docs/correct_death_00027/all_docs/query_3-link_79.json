        "text": "The musician was found unresponsive in his car one day after Christmas last year.\n\nBy Tabie Germain\n\nThe Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's Office has determined what caused the death of Bob Marley's grandson Jo Mersa Marley.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by Rolling Stone, the 31-year-old, son of Stephen Marley, died of \"acute asthma exacerbation\" after being infected by a common cold virus. The Medical Examiner’s Office noted that the musician had a history of asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia and had not been taking his asthma medication at the time of his death.\n\nHis body had no evidence of injury, though his lung showed signs of congestion, hyper expansion, and increased mucus in its airwaves, along with “enlarged glottic tonsils” and black discoloration in his lungs, resulting from smoking.\n\nA toxicology report detected THC, the chemical in marijuana, along with naloxone, a drug used to reverse an overdose, and 0.08% of ethanol in his system at the time of his death. However, it’s unclear why naloxone was found in his body. The report stated, “Additionally, chronic smoking of combustible products such as tobacco or marijuana is dangerous in a person with asthma.”\n\nMarley was found \"unresponsive\" inside his vehicle in the parking lot of a Ross Dress for Less store one day after Christmas last year. Officers attempted to administer CPR at the scene but were unsuccessful. He was later pronounced dead.\n\nThe Comfortable musician had told his mother the day before \"he was feeling ill, ostensibly due to his asthma,” records show. Marley is survived by his wife and daughter."
