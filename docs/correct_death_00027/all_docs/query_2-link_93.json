        "text": "A cause of death for Bob Marley’s grandson, Joseph ‘Mersa’ Marley, has been revealed.\n\nThe musician was found unresponsive in a vehicle in Florida on December 26, 2022 and later pronounced dead at the age of 31.\n\nJoseph was the grandson of late reggae legend Marley and son of musician Stephen Marley.\n\nIt was not revealed how Joseph died at the time but now a coroner’s report has been issued.\n\nAccording to documents from the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office obtained by Rolling Stone, Joseph died of ‘acute asthma exacerbation’ after being infected by a common cold virus.\n\nJoseph, who himself was also a musician, had a history of asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia, and it’s said he was not taking his asthma medication at the time of his death. In March 2022, he visited a hospital in Florida to receive treatment for a chest abscess.\n\nThe Medical Examiner’s Office also found that Joseph had a history of smoking and had ‘enlarged glottic tonsils’ in addition to black discoloration in his lungs.\n\nA toxicology report was conducted and found he had the presence of THC — the chemical in marijuana — in his system as well as naloxone and 0.08% of ethanol.\n\nThe report noted: ‘An acute asthma exacerbation due to viral illness is a common occurrence and considered a non-allergic event. Additionally, chronic smoking of combustible products such as tobacco or marijuana is dangerous in a person with asthma.’\n\nIt’s said that Joseph spoke to his mother on Christmas Day, the day before his death, and said he was feeling unwell ‘ostensibly due to his asthma’.\n\nJoseph grew up in Jamaica before moving to Miami and forged a music career much like the rest of his family, including his famous grandfather Marley who was a pioneer of reggae music and died in 1981 aged 36 from cancer.\n\nIn 2014, Joseph released his debut EP Comfortable featuring six songs and guest appearances from reggae musicians Wayne Marshall and Jemere Morgan.\n\nHis second album, Eternal, was released in 2021 and featured the likes of Busy Signal and Melii.\n\nAs well as collaborating with his father Stephen, Joseph appeared on the Grammy-winning album Strictly Roots by Morgan Heritage.\n\nHe studied studio engineering while at Miami Dade College.\n\nMany paid tribute after news of Joseph’s death, with Jamaica’s Minister of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport, Honorable Olivia Grange, tweeting: ‘I am deeply saddened by the news that artiste Joseph Marley, son of Reggae star, Stephen Marley and grand son of Reggae super star, Bob Marley has died.\n\n‘We were graced by Joseph,whose stage name was Jo Mersa, performing at our Jamaica 60 Launch in Miramar, Florida, USA in May.\n\n‘I extend my deepest condolences to Stephen, Jo’s mom, Kerry, the Marleys and other family members. My heartfelt sympathies to Joseph’s friends and associates and to the Reggae music fraternity and fans everywhere.’\n\nShe added: ‘His untimely passing at the young age of 31y.o. is a huge loss to the music as we look to the next generation. May he find Eternal Peace as we mourn his loss during this season of goodwill when we celebrate with family and friends our love for each other.’\n\nJamaica’s leader of the opposition, Mark J Golding, also said at the time: ‘I’ve just learned of the tragic loss of Joseph “Jo Mersa” Marley. A talented young reggae artiste, son of Stephen Marley & grandson of Bob Marley at only 31 yrs old. The loss of a child is a devastating blow no parent should face, my condolences to Stephen & the entire family.’\n\nJoseph is survived by a wife and daughter.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Bob Marley’s grandson Joseph Mersa Marley dies aged 31 as Jamaican politicians lead tributes"
