Norval died when Nesta was 10 years old, and together with his mother, they relocated to the Trenchtown section of Kingston.\n\nThe late singer grew up alongside his four half-siblings, Richard, Anthony, Bunny Wailer, and Claudette Pearl.\n\nWhat was Bob Marley’s cause of death?\n\nAccording to the Skin Cancer Foundation, Bob Marley died due to a rare form of skin cancer known as acral lentiginous melanoma. By the time of his demise, the cancer had spread to his brain and lungs.\n\nHow did Bob Marley find his cancer?\n\nIn July 1977, Nesta was diagnosed with a type of malignant melanoma under the nail of one of his toes. At first, he thought that it was a football injury until doctors performed a biopsy to confirm that he had cancer.\n\nDespite his doctor’s advice to have the toe amputated, Robert rejected the idea due to his religious beliefs and did not want to interrupt his performing career. He continued his musical career, even planning the 1980 world tour.\n\nBob Marley’s treatment\n\nAfter rejecting various treatments, the late guitarist removed the nail and some affected tissue for a skin graft. Bob’s friend and personal physician, Dr Carlton, recalled in the 2012 documentary Marley that the star maintained a positive attitude despite his grim prognosis. Nesta said:\n\nListen, we are going to fight it. Regardless of what the doctors might say or do, we will fight because a Rasta never gives up.\n\nHow did Bob Marley pass away?\n\nIn May 1980, the Rastafarian collapsed while jogging in a park. The doctors later found out that Bob Marley’s cancer had spread to his entire body. In an interview with The New Yorker, his manager Danny Sims recalled what one medic told them after Nesta’s admission:\n\nHe has more cancer in him than I have ever seen in a human being.\n\nEight months later, on 11 May 1981, the music legend died at the University of Miami Hospital while receiving treatment.\n\nWhat were Bob Marley's last words before he died?\n\nDays before Marley’s death, Rita, his wife, gathered all of his kids at the hospital so they could bid their dad farewell.\n\nIn a 2024 interview with PEOPLE, Ziggly, Bob Marley’s son, shared his dad’s final words of inspiration to him. The late songwriter said:\n\nOn your way up, take me up. On your way down, do not let me down.\n\nWhere is Marley buried?\n\nOn 21 May 1981, Nesta was given a state burial that incorporated Rastafari tradition and Ethiopian Orthodoxy.\n\nHe was buried in a chapel near his birthplace with a Bible opened at Psalm 23. Edward Seaga, then Jamaican Prime Minister, read his eulogy, recalling his contribution to the industry.\n\nHis voice was an omnipresent cry in our electronic world. His sharp features, majestic looks, and prancing style are vivid etchings on our minds' landscape. Bob Marley was never seen. He was an experience that left an indelible imprint with each encounter. Such a man cannot be erased from the mind. He is part of the collective consciousness of the nation.\n\nWhy is Bob Marley so famous?\n\nWith a career spanning over a decade, Marley released several songs that propelled him to the spotlight.\n\nSome of his accolades include a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Below are some of his major hits:\n\nSoul Rebel (1970)\n\nJamming (1977)\n\nExodus (1977)\n\nZion Train (1980)\n\nBad Card (1980)\n\nBuffalo Soldier (1984)\n\nBob Marley's cause of death was an acral lentiginous melanoma that spread to his entire body by the time of his demise on 11 May 1981.
