        "text": "Smoke pon de chalawa.\n\nThree decades ago today, Bob Marley's essence floated off into the most high like a purple cloud of ganja smoke.\n\nWe won't get into the details of his death, except to say: Let's continue to fight cancer. And let's celebrate the life of the greatest musical ambassador the world has ever known by looking over some highlights from his extraordinary time on Earth.\n\nRobert Nesta Marley was born February 6, 1945 in 9 Mile, Saint Anne, Jamaica and grew up in a humble house in the countryside.\n\nHis mom was Cedella Booker, aged 18, and his dad was Norval Sinclair Marley, aged 50. Here are a couple of pictures of each of them in their younger days.\n\nBob 's first band, The Teenagers, formed in 1963 with Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Junior Brathwaite, Beverly Kelso, and Cherry Smith. Here's how Bob used to look around that era, before he had dreads.\n\nThe Teenagers eventually became The Wailing Wailers, and got discovered by Clement Coxsone Dodd, a famous producer and Sound System bashment king.\n\nHe got turned on to Rastafarianism and began growing his hair out.\n\nEventually he'd grown the dreads that people the world over recognize him for. Bob Marley loved soccer all his life.\n\nBob Marley loved to write songs, and play the guitar.\n\nIn December 1976 Bob Marley survived an assassination attempt, caught bullet wounds, and still played the first ever Smile Jamaica Concert two days later for 80,000 fans. Here's an image from that show.\n\nBob Marley loved him some marijuana.\n\nHe had a lot of kids too. Here are some Bob Marley family pics.\n\nGive thanks for Bob Marley. What an awesome dude, world peace visionary, and great musician."
