        "text": "Cedella Booker, the mother of Jamaican music legend Bob Marley, has died, according to South Florida Times news partner NBC 6 and The Associated Press. She was 81.\n\nBooker died in her sleep Tuesday night at her home in Miami, apparently from natural causes, family spokesman Jerome Hamilton said.\n\nBooker, a Jamaica native, was 18 when she married Norval Marley, a British man 32 years her senior.\n\nTheir son brought Jamaican reggae music to international prominence, becoming its international image. Bob Marley died in Miami of a brain tumor in 1981 at age 36.\n\n\"Mrs. Booker was the matriarch of a movement so powerful that the mystical qualities of the\n\nMarley musical legacy remain strong and potent,\" Jamaica Information Minister Olivia Grange said.\n\nAfter Norval Marley died in 1955, Booker married an American man and settled in Delaware. She wrote two biographies of her famous son and recorded two albums, \"Awake Zion!\" and \"Smilin' Island of Song.\"\n\n\"She was a star in her own right,\" Jamaica Prime Minister Bruce Golding said in a statement.\n\n\"Her life was one of hardship, struggle and eventual fulfillment, and through it all, she exuded hope, strength and confidence.\"\n\nEveryone in St. Ann's parish knew Booker as \"Mama B,\" said Harry Shivnani, a family friend and general manager of Bob Marley's mausoleum.\n\n\"She loved cooking,\" Shivnani said. \"Mama would make you the best pudding ever.\"\n\nRobert Lalah, a columnist for the Jamaica Gleaner, interviewed Booker in February while she celebrated her son's birthday.\n\n\"She was a typical Jamaican grandmother,\" he said. \"She was very warm, very friendly.\"\n\nBooker is survived by two children and several grandchildren, including Ziggy Marley, who won four Grammys with the Melody Makers, a band that included brother Stephen and sisters Sharon and Cedella.\n\nFuneral arrangements have not been announced."
