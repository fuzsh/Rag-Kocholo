        "text": "Reggae legend Bob Marley died on May 11, 1981. Today being the 30th anniversary of Bob's passing, MNI Alive would like to join in the chorus of tributes celebrating a life so extraordinary.\n\nQuite often, the term legacy is attributed to entertainers, politicians and other persons from different walks of life. But my question has always been, how do you define someone's legacy and who determines what this person's legacy should be? For Bob Marley, such questioning would for sure be rebuked forcefully, as Bob's legacy was assured even before the moment of his untimely death.\n\nIn Bob's classic track, Wake up and Live, he sang, Life is one big road with lots of signs, so when you riding through the ruts, don't you complicate your mind. Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy! Don't bury your thoughts; put your vision to reality, yeah! Those lyrics have special meaning for me, as I have often and do continue to use this song as a motivational tool. Many persons have their favourite Bob Markey song or songs that has helped them come through trying times, uplift them on personal journeys or simply served as food for the soul in a time when chaos seems to rule the world. Millions of people globally revere Bob in death, more so than they did during his short but accomplished life.\n\nGrowing up with a Rastafarian parent, Bob Marley's music along with a host of other conscious music was always being played. The love affair began from that early age but my appreciation for the great lyrical content of his songs did not ferment until later on. During my years at University, I can recall one Sunday I was blasting Bob Marley on my stereo. My housemate at the time, either offended or curious, asked me if I did not listen to gospel? I responded that yes I do listen to gospel but can he not hear the gospel messages in these Marley songs.\n\nAt the time, the lyrics of Bob's 'Jah Live' were blaring out as Bob sang, Jah live! Children yeah! Jah Jah live children yeah! The truth is an offence but not a sin. Is he who laugh last children, is he who win. Is a foolish dog bark at the flying bird. One sheep herd must learn, children to respect the shepherd. The spiritual undertones in those lyrics were clear for me and as far as I was concerned, I was getting a good filling of Sunday morning devotions!\n\nBob Marley lost his fight with cancer at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami in 1981 but his death did not confine him to the back pages of entertainment magazines. His legacy further thrived after his death and his vast treasure trove of music speaks to the world in the same profound way as when they were first created. Bob Markey today has millions more followers than when he was alive because his message of unity, peace, love and reconciliation still resound in the lives of people from as far as the outbacks of Australia to the baked turfs in rural Africa, to the sun kissed beaches of the Caribbean. Bob's star is global.\n\nThinking about it, many luminaries inside and outside the world of music have proclaimed that as large as Elvis was, or as large as the Beatles were; none of those stars have that global appeal as Bob Marley's music does, transcending barriers of race, religion and class. Bob's music was not simply about the plight of Rastafarians who at the time were facing public disapproval but his music's universal appeal was that he spoke to the human condition and sought to empower us to take stock of our lives, to take more responsibility for our selves and be better persons in the process. For me that is what Bob's music represents.\n\nTo be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is no easy feat, yet Bob was the first Reggae artiste to be granted such status. Global media corporation, The BBC, chose Bob's 'One Love' track as the identifying soundtrack to mark all its programming at the end of the last millennium. Further accolades include Time Magazine naming Bob's 'Exodus' album as the greatest album ever recorded.\n\nThe beauty about Bob's music is such that in places where you least expect to hear reggae, you will most certainly hear one of Bob Marley's songs. Two years ago I visited Singapore and on a stroll one evening in the midst of house, garage and other types of pop music, it was Bob Marley's 'Could You Be Loved' that blatantly stood out. I continue to be amazed at the fact that Bob's music has this timeless stamp that everyone can identify with.\n\nIn the beginning it was not just Bob. The Original Wailers consisted of the fiery Peter Tosh and the more measured Bunny Wailer. They all eventually went off to pursue solo careers and on their own have carved a niche for themselves but it's the sound of Bob Marley's music that has trumped them all to this massive global appeal. Of course, I am partial to think that Chris Blackwell's vision and investment played a key role but Chris's money did not buy creativity and handed it to Bob, the gift of music and the message that came from the music must have surely been an integral part of the DNA of Bob Marley.\n\nImage Credit to Jervis Creative"
