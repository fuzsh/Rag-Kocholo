        "text": "Joining the ranks of \"Rocketman\" and \"Elvis,\" the newest biopic profiling the King of Reggae, Bob Marley, was released Feb. 14, one week after what would have been the star’s 79th birthday.\n\n\"Bob Marley: One Love\" follows the revolutionary career of the musician, who stepped into international fame amid violent political unrest in his home country Jamaica in the 1970s. Born in 1945, the star died at the age of 36 in Miami, Florida, in 1981.\n\nZiggy Marley, Bob Marley's son, spoke with Entertainment Tonight about the film, saying it offers a never-before-seen perspective of his father.\n\n\"The Bob Marley that's in the TV and that you seen in the videos − that's not the Bob Marley we're really exploring. We're exploring the Bob Marley you don't know,\" Ziggy Marley said.\n\nThe film stars British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir as Bob Marley, alongside Lashana Lynch as Rita Marley and James Norton as Chris Blackwell.\n\nHere's what to know about the film.\n\nHow to watch 'Bob Marley: One Love' movie\n\n\"Bob Marley: One Love\" premiered in theaters Wednesday, Feb. 14.\n\nFor Cincinnati viewers, it's currently showing at Cinemark Oakley Station and XD in Oakley, AMC Newport on the Levee in Newport, Kenwood Theatre in Kenwood and Esquire Theatre in Clifton.\n\nThere have been no announcements about when the film will be available on streaming services. However, since \"Bob Marley: One Love\" was produced by Paramount Pictures, it could land on Paramount+.\n\nHow long is the new Bob Marley movie?\n\nThe film is 1 hour, 44 minutes long, according to IMDB.\n\nWho played Bob Marley in the 'One Love' movie?\n\nBritish actor Kingsley Ben-Adir stars as Bob Marley in the biopic. He was previously in five episodes of \"Peaky Blinders\" and seven episodes of \"High Fidelity.\" Ben-Adir was also in the summer hit \"Barbie.\"\n\nHow did Bob Marley die?\n\nMarley died from a case of melanoma skin cancer, which originated under his big toenail in 1977.\n\nInitially, Marley was told the lesion on his toe was a soccer injury, according to HealthCert.com. After the spot worsened, Marley consulted another doctor who biopsied the spot and discovered it was an aggressive form of melanoma. The recommendation was to amputate his toe, but Marley refused (reportedly due to religious beliefs) and chose to just remove the toenail instead.\n\nMarley collapsed in New York City in 1980. He was rushed to the hospital and discovered that the melanoma had spread to his brain, lungs and stomach. He opted for an alternative treatment plan in Germany that involved exercise, ozone injections and vitamins.\n\nA year later, on a flight from Germany to Jamaica, Marley deplaned in Florida and died at the University of Miami Hospital on May 11, 1981. His last words to his son Ziggy were, “Money can’t buy life.”"
