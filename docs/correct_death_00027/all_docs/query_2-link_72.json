        "text": "Here's everything to know about Norval.\n\nNorval Marley was a British naval officer\n\nOnly one known photo exists of Norval, a black-and-white image that shows him riding a horse while wearing a button-down shirt, tie, and hat. According to BBC, Norval supervised a plantation in Jamaica.\n\nAlthough he's known as \"Captain\" Norval, there's no evidence that he ever achieved a title higher than a private while serving in the British army, according to the 2012 documentary \"Marley.\"\n\nNorval and Cedella Booker, Bob's mother, met in Nine Mile, Jamaica. In the documentary, Cedella recalled seeing Norval riding his horse through the district and said that he became \"good friends\" with her father. Cedella was about 16 years old and Norval was in his 60s when they met, according to her sister.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBob, born Nesta Robert Marley on February 6, 1945, was named after Norval's brother, Robert Marley.\n\nNorval died in Jamaica in 1955\n\nIn \"Bob Marley: One Love,\" Bob has no substantial relationship with Norval. This is similar to the real-life events that transpired. After Bob's birth, he and Cedella only saw Norval a few times.\n\nGrowing up in Jamaica, Marley was bullied for being biracial. Per the documentary, Bob went to see his father and was rejected, which inspired him to write the song \"Corner Stone.\""
