        "text": "THE untimely death of the Jamaican singer shocked millions of fans around the world.\n\nBob Marley changed lives and inspired the world of music, long after his death at just 36-years-old.\n\nHow did Bob Marley die?\n\nBob died from an acral lentiginous melanoma - a form of skin cancer which had been diagnosed in 1977, spreading from under a nail of his toe.\n\nBob first discovered the melanoma during a game of football in 1977, when a foot injury seemed unusually bad, and worsened over time.\n\nWhen doctors discovered the cancer, he was advised to have his toe amputated, but refused as his Rastafarian faith considers it a sin to have a part of the body \"temple\" removed.\n\nHe did consent to a skin graft but this didn’t stop the disease spreading throughout his body by the summer of 1980.\n\nWhen and where did Bob Marley die?\n\nHaving collapsed while jogging in Central Park, New York during his final tour, Bob played his last ever gig in Pittsburgh in September 1980.\n\nHe then cancelled all remaining live dates and flew to Germany for a controversial diet-based treatment under Josef Issels.\n\nAfter eight months the treatment proved unsuccessful, and Bob boarded a plane home to Jamaica.\n\nHowever, on the flight his condition worsened, the plane was diverted and he was rushed to hospital in Miami.\n\nBob died at the Cedars Of Lebanon Hospital on May 11, 1981.\n\nWhere was Bob Marley's funeral?\n\nDue to his fame, Bob was granted a state funeral in Jamaica.\n\nIt was held on May 21, 1981, and attended by thousands of fans from around the world.\n\nThe eulogy was delivered by the Prime Minister Edward Seaga.\n\nHe is buried in a chapel near his birthplace with his Gibson Les Paul guitar.\n\nWhat are the conspiracy theories surrounding Bob Marley’s death?\n\nThe most prevalent theory is that, due to his growing political stature in Jamaica, Marley was murdered by the CIA.\n\nIt’s suggested that they were behind the attempted assassination at Hope Road and, having failed to kill him, went about more surreptitious means to see him off.\n\nIt’s said that Carl Colby, the son of late CIA director William Colby, later gave Marley a pair of boots and, when Bob tried them on, a radioactive copper wire inside pricked his toe, causing the cancer.\n\nOf course, none of these theories have been proven.\n\nWhat are Bob Marley's greatest hits?\n\nBob racked up a HUGE amount of hits during his time on the music scene.\n\nThe following are his the biggest songs he released (in order of popularity):"
