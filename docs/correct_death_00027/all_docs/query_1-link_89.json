        "text": "I was uncharacteristically nervous about interviewing Bob Marley. Not only was he Bob Marley and steeped in near-deity status (his repeated canceling of local concerts only added to his mystique), but he rarely granted interviews. If he did, I had heard, he was likely to put on an accent so thick as to be incomprehensible to someone who didn’t know Jamaican patois.\n\nIt was 1980 in Miami. I was the midday D.J. on Y-100, South Florida’s top-rated hit music station, using the on-air moniker “The Madame.” I had interviewed the Bee Gees, Michael Jackson, Bette Midler, K.C. and the Sunshine Band, and more. Charismatic artists on their best behavior would stop by the show and mug for the camera, and someone would send the photo on to trade publications. All I had to do was make it sound like we were having a breezy poolside chat.\n\nY-100 did not play Bob Marley’s music. There was no way he would ever be walking into the air studio covered with wallpaper that showed nude women lounging about like at a Roman orgy. King Sporty, a record producer friend of mine who had co-written “Buffalo Soldiers” with Marley (and was later married to singer Betty Wright) offered to set up an interview with him. I jumped at the chance.\n\n“Bob Marley agreed to an interview!” I said to my superior at Y-100, sure he would want to run it at some point. At night, maybe?\n\nHe barely knew who he was.\n\n“The Rastafarian reggae superstar,” I explained. His blank expression was replaced with mild annoyance. “Ever hear him on Y-100? What’s the point?”\n\n“It’s Bob Marley! That’s the point!”\n\nNo matter what his reaction, I wasn’t going to let this opportunity pass me by. Somehow I’d recoup the cost of booking a recording studio to do it. A handheld cassette recorder was out. I wanted it to be the best quality possible. Some people thought I was getting carried away, and suggested that he wasn’t that big of a deal, like Michael Jackson. But, to me, he was.\n\nThe interview was set to take place at the Miami recording studio Music Market near where Marley and his band were rehearsing. I would pick him up at the rehearsal studio, drive him to the recording studio, and then drive him back.\n\nI was a smug 25-year-old until I was on my way to retrieve Marley in my blue Pontiac LeMans with black tinted windows. My excitement turned to panic. Will I be able to understand him? There were rumors that he was dying. Could I ask him if it was true? Though I’d brought a camera with me, I was afraid to request a photo. I hoped someone else would do it for me without my asking.\n\nI walked into the rehearsal studio trying not to appear nervous and announced with a big smile to the first person I saw—a Rastafarian with short dreadlocks—“I’m here to interview Bob Marley.” He gave me an unfriendly look. I was relieved when I spied Sporty behind him, but he glared at me, too.\n\nBob Marley appeared. He was a slight man with dreads down to his elbows. On top of that brown mass sat a bright-yellow-and-orange knitted cap, which flopped to one side. He wasn’t pleased to see me. He nodded at me with a wary expression and did not reach out his hand to shake mine. I took his cue and didn’t offer my hand either. Something, most definitely, was not right. Or, maybe, this was the ultimate in cool.\n\nMy heart sank. I was getting the cold shoulder because Bob had better things to do. I felt out of place, powerless, a stupid young white chick. I waited to be told the interview wasn’t happening.\n\nSporty, Marley, and a few men I presumed were his band members rapidly exchanged words. I had no idea what they were saying, but it wasn’t nice. I assumed Sporty was trying to convince Marley to do the interview. Suddenly, Marley and two others—a young Jamaican man and woman—were heading my way. After a moment of confusion, I understood that they expected me to take them to the recording studio.\n\nMoments later, Marley was seated next to me in the passenger seat of my car. The man and woman sat in the back. They were never introduced. The tension in the air grew thicker. As I started to drive, I stole a few glances at Marley, who was wearing a navy blue jogging suit. He wasn’t tall, maybe five feet seven or five feet eight—thin, but solid. He wore sneakers. He looked healthy to me. He had played two shows at Madison Square Garden two weeks before, then one in Pittsburgh.\n\nI chatted him up about Jamaican politics, trying to connect with him and to prove that I’d done my homework with regard to his culture. He mostly nodded, giving me a “Should I trust her?” look.\n\nI switched to lighter fare and commented on his cap. “A fan made it,” he said.\n\nI thought about how thrilled that person must be to have his or her (probably her) creation resting on the head of Bob Marley. I felt like I might levitate. A long silence enveloped us as we rode along, punctuated by a few exchanges he made with his entourage that I couldn’t decipher.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for an interviewer and interviewee to say little before the on-air light goes on. You don’t want to “give the performance in the dressing room.” Still, I sensed this was not going to be an easy session.\n\nBy the time we reached the recording studio, Bob had loosened up a bit. He sat directly across from me at a small, square portable card table in the middle of a soundproofed room. I was accustomed to conducting my one-on-one, lighthearted interviews while we all stood in the small Y-100 air studio. This felt like an interrogation room with a spotlight burning into my subject while five other people observed every move and analyzed each word.\n\nAs a test was done for voice levels, Bob made sounds like “Bree!” and “Bop-bop.” He reminded me of an exotic bird briefly perched somewhere, taking in all that was around him. He now looked at me with kindness, openness, and a bit of intrigue. Female D.J.s were a novelty then, especially on hit radio. He probably knew I was the significant other of the singer Bobby Caldwell, one of Sporty’s best friends. It kept me from doing any shameless, embarrassing flirting. Thank God.\n\nHe often re-arranged his cap as we spoke. I kept expecting him, or someone with him, to light up a huge spliff and pass it around. None appeared.\n\nI understood most of what he said. We covered a wide range of topics: Jamaica, pot, religion, music, slang . . . even having children out of wedlock.\n\n“Well, I think maybe people try it,” he said, “but I don’t see it that prevalent in Jamaica. It causes problem.”\n\n“Yeah, it causes problems when it happens here,” I said.\n\nEveryone, finally, cracked up.\n\nI asked him if he ever wanted to record another style of music other than reggae.\n\nHe answered, “Although I like other music, I don’t think I really change it because I don’t get the same feeling.” He drove home his comment by pounding his chest with his fist several times on “feeling.”\n\nWhen asked about an assassination attempt, he said, “Even the best of us have to cry sometimes. No way man goin’ to go through life and him go through it easy, easy. Man like me got to defend life, man!”\n\nWhen the interview wrapped up, I chickened out of asking someone to take our photo together. That initial iciness still haunts me. I thought I might see him again and there would be another opportunity. No way could he be sick, much less on his way to the grave.\n\nI shuttled everyone back to the rehearsal studio and wasted no time calling Sporty to thank him.\n\n“I thought it wasn’t going to go down at first,” I said. “I felt the strangest vibe when I showed up.”\n\nIn his raspy voice, he said, “That’s because right before you showed up, someone rammed into my Corvette. No one would admit who did it. I’d just pulled out my gun and fired two shots into the ceiling when you walked through the door.”\n\nHad the Internet and its wealth of instantaneous information and images existed then, I would have known Marley had first been diagnosed with melanoma in 1977 when a wound on his big toe didn’t heal after he re-injured it playing soccer. Just two weeks before our interview he had collapsed while jogging in Central Park. The cancer had spread to his brain. A neurologist gave him one month to live.\n\nMan like me got to defend life, man.\n\nWe were both in denial.\n\nOver the years, I made attempts to interest syndication companies in the interview. I was often turned down because, strangely, he appealed to too wide of an audience for commercial radio with its well-defined boundaries and niches. Nearly two decades after our interview, I sold it to the Marley estate, making a nice return on my initial investment. But I still kick myself for not asking for that photo.\n\nA Diary of Dancehall\n\n1 / 14"
