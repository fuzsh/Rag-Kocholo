        "text": "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. – Miami Beach rolled out the red carpet on Thursday night for the premiere of a new movie about Bob Marley.\n\nBased on the true story of one of the most recognizable figures on the planet, it details the Jamaican star’s rise to fame and his quest for “One Love.”\n\nThe star studded screening took place at Regal Cinema on South Beach.\n\nPlaying the iconic role of Bob Marley was Kingsley Ben-Adir.\n\n“It’s hard to summarize,” he said when asked what it was like to play a legend. “There was a huge amount of trust.”\n\nThe film, which was produced in part by Marley’s family, tells the story of the legend behind his music. His highs, his lows and his struggles.\n\nFor the Marley family, bringing the movie to Miami meant bringing it to a place the global super star once called home.\n\nThe film is set to be released on Valentine’s Day."
