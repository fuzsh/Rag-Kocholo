        "meta_description": "Robert Nesta Marley was a Jamaican singer, songwriter and musician. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by blending elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as forging a smooth and distinct vocal and songwriting style. Over the course of his career Marley became known as a Rastafari icon.  He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for the legalization of marijuana, while he also advocated for Pan-Africanism. Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture.",

        "text": "Bob Marley was born on 6 February 1945 at the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica.\n\nIn February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, \"Judge Not\", \"One Cup of Coffee\", \"Do You Still Love Me?\" and \"Terror\", at Federal Studios for local music producer Leslie Kong. Three of the songs were released on Beverley's with \"One Cup of Coffee\" being released under the pseudonym, Bobby Martell.\n\nIn 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith were called the Teenagers. They later changed the name to the Wailing Rudeboys, then to the Wailing Wailers, at which point they were discovered by record producer Coxsone Dodd, and finally to the Wailers.\n\nIn 1966, Marley married Rita Anderson, and moved near his mother's residence in Wilmington, Delaware in the United States for a short time, during which he worked as a DuPont lab assistant and on the assembly line at a Chrysler plant in nearby Newark, under the alias Donald Marley.\n\nWailers released the album Burnin' which included the song \"I Shot the Sheriff\". Eric Clapton was given the album by his guitarist George Terry in the hope that he would enjoy it. Clapton was suitably impressed and chose to record a cover version of \"I Shot the Sheriff\".\n\nThe Wailers disbanded in 1974, with each of the three main members pursuing a solo career. Despite the break-up, Marley continued recording as \"Bob Marley & The Wailers\".\n\n\"I Shot the Sheriff\" became his first US hit since \"Layla\" two years earlier and reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 14 September 1974.\n\nOn 3 December 1976, two days before \"Smile Jamaica\", a free concert organised by the Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home. Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm.\n\nMarley's last concert occurred at the Stanley Theater (now called The Benedum Center For The Performing Arts) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 23 September 1980.\n\nMarley died on 11 May 1981 at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami (now University of Miami Hospital), aged 36. The spread of melanoma to his lungs and brain caused his death. His final words to his son Ziggy were \"Money can't buy life.\"\n\nMarley received a state funeral in Jamaica on 21 May 1981, which combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Rastafari tradition. He was buried in a chapel near his birthplace with his guitar, and the Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga delivered the final funeral eulogy to Marley."
