        "text": "Robert Nesta Marley was born on February 6, 1945, in Nine Miles, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica. His mother, Cedella Malcolm, was black, and his father, Norval Marley, was white. Norval’s family disapproved of his marriage to Cedella, and as a child Marley rarely saw his father.\n\nMarley spent his early years in Nine Miles, a small town in the countryside. As a teenager he lived in the neighborhood of Trench Town in Kingston, the capital of Jamaica. The poverty and cultural influences of Trench Town were especially important to Marley’s music.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Marley and several of his friends formed a band, which they eventually called the Wailers. The group had its first big hit, “Simmer Down,” in 1963. It gave a voice to the urban poor of Jamaica. Marley soon became a star performer. His songs were a combination of rhythm and blues, rock, and reggae. They helped make reggae popular around the world.\n\nIn addition to his musical career, Marley was active in politics. He tried to bring together groups in Jamaica that were fighting for control of the country. To do that he organized the One Love concert in 1978. Marley won an award from the government for his efforts. Soon after that, on May 11, 1981, he died of cancer in Miami, Florida.\n\nIn the years after his death, Bob Marley and his music became even better-known worldwide. Legend, an album of his songs released in 1984, became the best-selling reggae album of all time. Bob Marley’s music is still enjoyed by many today."
