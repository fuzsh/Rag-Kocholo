        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Bob Marley is everywhere in Jamaica. The world-famous reggae star has the status of a superhero in his native country. Walls, T-shirts and posters are just a few of the places you see his image in the birthplace of reggae. He is an idol and a role model for how far you can get with hard work.\n\nJEREMY COLLINGWOOD: \"Bob had that extra something, including that ability to work incredibly hard and practice and practice and practice because he wasn't a naturally gifted musician or a naturally gifted singer. But he learned and he had an amazing ability to learn and to develop and say 'OK, I've tried this. It didn't work. I'll try it another way.'\"\n\nNARRATOR: Bob Marley grew up poor in the ghettos of Jamaica's capital, Kingston, and he never forgot his roots. But Marley was more than a star - many forget that he was also a rebel who never ceased to use his music to raise his voice against oppression.\n\nCOLLINGWOOD: \"A lot of people have a very simplistic view of Bob Marley in their minds, of someone with dreadlocks and denim and smoking and, you know, 'Wasn't he some sort of hippy on the beach.'\"\n\nNARRATOR: Marley was also a believer in Rastafarianism, a religious movement that draws extensively from the Bible and aims to promote Black Pride. As a Rastafarian and a musician, Bob Marley had a tough time.\n\nDANNY SIMS: \"He wasn't allowed in the recording studios and he didn't want to go in. He wasn't allowed to go into radio stations and I guess he wanted to go in there but they didn't allow a Rasta in the stations. As difficult as it was for a Jamaican musician, outside of Jamaica he was a Rasta.\"\n\nNARRATOR: The house where Bob Marley once lived is now a museum. The reggae star would have relished the attention. Artifacts documenting every aspect of his life are exhibited here, including his former tour bus.\n\nSIMS: \"He knew he was going to be a superstar. He knew that he was a star. He always knew that. How he knew - because he was in his early 20s at that time or maybe he wasn't even 20 - but he knew.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Marley married his childhood sweetheart, Rita, and went on to have five children with her, four biological and one adopted. In addition, he is alleged to have fathered numerous illegitimate children. Almost 30 years after Bob Marley died of skin cancer at the age of 36, his music still makes the charts and his popularity remains unbroken in Jamaica and all over the world."
