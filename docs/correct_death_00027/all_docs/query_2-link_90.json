        "text": "As it turned out to be a melanoma and, after consulting two doctors, a biopsy showed he had acral lentiginous melanoma.\n\nThis type of skin cancer is considered to be one of the deadliest, and is not caused so much by sun exposure, but is often found in places where they are easy to miss such as under the toenails.\n\nBob could have had his toe amputated, but instead chose not to do this, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and covered over with a skin graft.\n\nHe continued to tour for some time after, and in 1980 was expected to embark on a world tour.\n\nAccording to reports, Bob sought alternative cancer treatment, known as Issels treatment, which includes “clean living” and avoiding certain food and drinks.\n\nAfter eight months of this, where it has been said very little progress was made in treating his cancer, he went home to Jamaica, but during the flight, his condition worsened a great deal.\n\nHe was forced to land in Miami, Florida, and went to a hospital there for immediate treatment, but he died on May 11, 1981.\n\nAccording to his son Ziggy, who was present, Bob’s last words were: “Money can’t buy life.”"
