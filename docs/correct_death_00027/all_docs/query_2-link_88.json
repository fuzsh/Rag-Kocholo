That’s the way we were raised,” she said. “I strongly believe the fame my parents earned, the success they have achieved, is because they’re gifted with kindness. I think Bob’s true purpose was — all the work, all his music — for him to achieve that level.\"\n\nJulian Marley, 1975\n\nJulian Marley, whose mother is Lucy Pounder, won the best reggae album Grammy in 2024 for \"Colors Of Royal.\" He has released several albums over the years.\n\nHe told The Guardian Nigeria in 2020 how he's found his own lane in the genre that his father popularized.\n\n“You can’t do twice as much; you have to do what you can do,” he said. “You have to do what you are supposed to do, (because) everyone has a mission. Everyone has something to do.”\n\nKy-Mani Marley, 1976\n\nKy-Mani Marley, whose mother is Anita Belnavis, is also an artist.
