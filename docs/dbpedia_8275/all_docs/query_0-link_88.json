        "text": "To follow up “Match Point,” his entertaining comeback picture, Woody Allen returns to England with “Scoop,” another mystery of sorts.\n\nWhile it’s not as crisp and perfectly honed as “Match Point,” “Scoop” is still plenty enjoyable — a comedy with just enough who-dun-it to keep things interesting.\n\nScarlett Johansson is the Woodman’s female star this time around, playing Sondra Pransky, an American journalism student vacationing in London who believes she’s discovered the identity of a serial killer who leaves tarot cards at the scene of the crime.\n\nHer unlikely suspect: Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), an aristocrat who is preparing for a career in politics while tending to his family’s considerable wealth.\n\nHer partners in sleuthing: Brooklyn magician Sid Waterman (Allen, in a very appropriate role) and the ghost of investigative reporter Joe Stombel (Ian McShane of HBO’s “Deadwood”), who points Sondra in the right direction, even though it’s hard to believe.\n\nGiven Lyman’s charm and considerable appeal, the story line here isn’t tough to figure out. It’s apparent from the moment that he and Sondra meet that she will fall for him, ever so slowly losing her journalistic distance.\n\nNervoused out about the whole thing is Sid, who masquerades as her dad and charms the upper-crust London set while sneaking about in true amateur detective fashion.\n\nWhile it takes a while for the bantering relationship between Sid and Sondra to fully settle in, it eventually becomes quite comfortable.\n\nJohansson is particularly strong, managing to be dimwittedly funny while playing a smart young woman and convincingly conveying the character’s changes.\n\nJackman is good in everything he does, coming off smooth and sauve here — a stark contrast to his “X-Men” appearance as Wolverine earlier this summer.\n\nThe picture is carried with lighthearted fun by Allen, who has crafted another of his witty, fast-moving screenplays with throwaway lines that are just as entertaining as those that concern the central story.\n\nAt one point, for example, Sid quips: “I was born to the Jewish persuasion but converted to narcissism.” Think Woody may be talking about himself?\n\nThat is about as heavy and introspective as “Scoop” gets. This, thankfully, isn’t an Allen effort at mining psychological depths or some kind of serious look at the various levels of deception that take place throughout the picture.\n\nInstead, Allen is aiming for intelligent entertainment with “Scoop,” and that’s just what he produces.\n\nReach L. Kent Wolgamott at 473-7244 or at kwolgamott@journalstar.com.\n\nScoop - 3½ stars\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nStars: Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman, Woody Allen, Ian McShane\n\nRated: PG-13 for sexual references and mild violence\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour, 36 minutes\n\nNow Showing: Grand\n\nThe Reel Story: Allen follows up “Match Point” with another mystery of sorts. Johansson is a journalism student who thinks aristocrat Jackman is a serial killer in this entertaining comedy.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
