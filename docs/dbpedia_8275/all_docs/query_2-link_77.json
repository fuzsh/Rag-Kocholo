Not only is he a hugely talented actor, singer, dancer and all-round entertainer, but he's regularly topping lists of the most attractive men in Hollywood.\n\nWith a glittering career that spans more than two decades, the hard-working Australian was already massively well-known around the world before 2017, thanks to his turn in the X-Men films as Wolverine.\n\nBut after 2017, when The Greatest Showman was released - starring Hugh as protagonist P.T Barnum - the world exploded with love for the 50-year-old.
