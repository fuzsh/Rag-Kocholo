        "text": "After a loooonnnngggg, llllooooonnnggggg week, here it is, Saturday again! Let’s get weird!\n\nI’m excited to share today’s film with you, as it comes from one of my all-time favorite filmmakers, Mr. Darren Aronofsky. Every couple years I revisit his entire filmography. It’s just about time I went through them again, which makes this particular film a perfect selection for this week’s Oddities Theater.\n\nSo what are we watching? Here are some screengrabs to give you a little hint:\n\nIf you haven’t seen this one yet, you’re probably thinking it’s not a real movie, right? It looks too incredible, too perfect. Well, I’m here to tell you IT IS REAL. It’s 2006’s The Fountain, starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. It’s truly a beautiful film and somehow I was able to find it available to watch on YouTube totally free.\n\nWatch this on the biggest screen available to you.\n\nAlright, folks… let’s get to it. Pull up those chairs, grab a blanket (it’s getting cold!), and take comfort in knowing you’re snug at home watching a stunning, moving art piece (for free!) while the rest of the world is packed into stuffy theaters to see the latest Marvel Studios offering.\n\nWith Oddities Theater, you win EVERY weekend.\n\nEnjoy!"
