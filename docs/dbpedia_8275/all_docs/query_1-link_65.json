        "text": "Given The Prestige’s combination of magic, murder mystery and David Bowie I’m amazed I’d not seen it before now but, somehow, it had slipped the net, so it was with some sense of anticipation I slid the disc into the Blu-Ray player this evening.\n\nMade between two of his trio of forays to Gotham City (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) and reuniting him with both Christian Bale and Michael Caine, The Prestige sees Christopher Nolan back in the same kind of territory that initially made his reputation in Memento, but with a much bigger budget and bigger stars.\n\nTelling the story of a rivalry between two magicians, Bale’s Alfred ‘The Professor’ Borden and Hugh Jackman’s Robert “The Great Danton” Angier, in late Victorian era London it quickly becomes obvious Nolan is playing with timelines again as we start with what feels like an ending before we jump from ‘the present’ to various stages of the past through a pair of diaries being read by the two leads and written by the other.\n\nThat probably sounds more confusing than it comes across on screen as Nolan handles these time shifts excellently, in fact possibly better than in either Momento or Oppenheimer, with Bale and Jackman both finding interesting ways to denote the time period in their performance.\n\nGenerally speaking both put in the sort of performances we’d expect and, as the story reveals itself, the performances become all the more impressive, which I can’t really elaborate on without crucial spoilers, while Jackman playing a drunk, out of work, doppelgänger of himself is a treat during the film’s second act.\n\nWith them Caine very much reprises his Alfred from the Batman movies role, with a suitable magical twist, and Scarlett Johansson adds a nice scheming twist to an otherwise fairly straightforward part while Rebecca Hall is somewhat disappointingly underserved.\n\nWhile it’s only really a cameo David Bowie is, of course, somewhat scene stealing when he does appear, as Nikola Tesla of all people, though, while crucial to the plot in so many ways, his presence alongside Andy Serkis as his assistant almost feel like they belong to a different movie and I should probably make it clear, this isn’t a true story but the touches of the real world do make one question that at points.\n\nWith some spectacular visual illusions, which going by Nolan’s reputation likely were done as real magic tricks, at least to some degree, and a few bigger effects moments, The Prestige manages to combine period drama with mystery and big budget special effects in impressive fashion.\n\nWhile all I’ve said so far is true, what really impresses about the film is how it deals with something that seems to be a key theme for Nolan – that of obsession.\n\nHere the obsession of both leads creates a kind of feedback loop which takes what could be a rather run of the mill murder mystery piece and elevates it to something far more fascinating and engaging, though there are moments while this is establishing itself earlier on that almost feel distancing, but once it gets rolling it’s irresistible and both Bale and Jackman embody the obsession in increasingly terrifying ways.\n\nAll of this makes The Prestige another standout film in Nolan’s oeuvre and one that deserves to be more well known as it feels like it’s somewhat lost in the shuffle between the Batmen and then his more extravagant and epic later work."
