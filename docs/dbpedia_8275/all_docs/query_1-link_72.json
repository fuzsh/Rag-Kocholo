        "text": "Hugh Jackman owes it all to Wolverine.\n\nThe comic-book-inspired movie character with the funky sideburns and the 12-inch retractable claws is responsible for everything good that has happened to Jackman in the past six years – the burgeoning movie career, the opportunity to win a 2004 Tony Award and certainly the free bathrobe from Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nStanding in his dressing room backstage at the “Ellen” show in Burbank, the actor clutches his new bathrobe, a gift for being a guest on the show, as if it were an Oscar.\n\n“Is this for me?” he asks excitedly. “This is so cool.”\n\nClearly, Jackman is enjoying the ride.\n\nThe ride began in 2000 with the unexpectedly huge opening of “X-Men,” Jackman’s first American film. It received a significant boost three years later with the sequel “X2,” and hits another peak today with the release of “X-Men: The Last Stand.” The first two movies grossed a combined $700 million worldwide.\n\nIn the third special-effects-laden installment of the franchise, the 37-year-old Australian reprises his role as Wolverine, one of the group of good mutants headed by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). They are locked in a death match with evil mutants led by Magneto (Ian McKellen) over a controversial cure for mutancy.\n\nHalle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey) all returned for the latest film.\n\nThe cure offers the mutant population a choice of sacrificing their uniqueness to conform to society’s norm. Filmmakers have made no secret that the cure is a euphemism for a variety of other social issues.\n\n“There are strong racial, political, social and even sexual aspects of the story,” explained the film’s director, Brett Ratner.\n\n“The movie is about choice and alienation. The very idea of eradicating that which sets individuals apart is the real villain of this movie. It raises a lot of questions, such as: ‘Is conformity an antidote to prejudice?’ Because of questions like that, I felt the movie was about something important, and not just a chance to cash in.”\n\nJackman, who was not contractually bound to return for another sequel, said the social issues addressed in the script intrigued him as well.\n\n“It’s not about the money for me,” he said. “I had no reason to do it financially because I’m doing quite well at this point. But I loved the script because it was about something. The action is fun, but how many times do you get to do an action film that is about something?\n\n“I think it will make people think. Any minority, or any group of people, can relate to what is being asked in this movie, and that is: ‘If you had a chance to not be who you are, would you take it?'”\n\nOK, Jackman conceded that he didn’t return to the “X-Men” franchise just to make people think. He admits that he enjoys the action stuff, too, and he loves the character Wolverine.\n\n“I see him as the classic anti-hero. He’s Mad Max, Dirty Harry and Han Solo. He doesn’t say a lot, but what he says is usually huge.\n\n“Wolverine is always struggling to find his place in the world,” Jackman added. “He’s a loner who keeps getting dragged into these tense situations. I love the guy.”\n\nLAST-MINUTE REPLACEMENT\n\nThe youngest of five children, Jackman was raised in Sydney by a single dad after his mother left the family when the youngster was 8. The actor now has two children of his own, and has been married for 10 years to actress Deborra-Lee Furness.\n\nAt a private all-boys school, Jackman played all sports but was obsessed with rugby. He says that if he had the talent, he would have preferred a career as a professional rugby player to show business.\n\nBut his dreams were effectively smashed on the rugby field, and he turned his attention elsewhere. He started auditioning for school musicals, which is not as strange as it might sound for a young man who only recently gave up rugby.\n\n“All my mates tried out for the musicals,” he said with a laugh, “because that’s the only way you could meet girls at an all-boys school. They would bring in the girls to be in the shows, so it was perfectly acceptable for big macho guys to sing and dance.”\n\nJackman continued his singing and dancing in college, where he majored in journalism. After graduation, he worked onstage, in movies and on Australian television before moving to London, where he was cast as Curly in Trevor Nunn’s 1998 revival of the classic musical “Oklahoma!”\n\nIn 1999, he and his wife decided to move to Los Angeles to look for work in films. Four days later, his agent called with the biggest break of his career.\n\nActor Dougray Scott had been cast as Wolverine in the first “X-Men,” but he had to back out when two extra months of filming were required on “Mission: Impossible.”\n\nThe studio was a week into shooting “X-Men,” and desperately needed another actor to fill the role. The handsome, 6-foot-2 Jackman seemed like a perfect fit, at least from his photos. But nobody at the studio had met him.\n\nHe was sent immediately to Toronto to meet director Bryan Singer, and then was flown back to Los Angeles to meet with top studio executives.\n\n“They took me from one meeting to another,” Jackman said. “In each meeting, there was somebody more important than in the previous meeting. After meeting with the studio president, I expected to walk into a room with (studio owner) Rupert Murdoch.”\n\nBut he never got that far. The studio was satisfied. The director was satisfied. Jackman was put on a plane and told to learn his lines as quickly as possible.\n\nThe actor said he had no idea what was in store for him.\n\n“I didn’t know anything about the ‘X-Men’ comics because I never read any comics when I was growing up,” he said. “I had no idea how big the fan base was. It was a big shock to me when it opened so big.”\n\nAn even bigger shock awaited him three days after the opening as he was walking on the studio lot where he was filming “Someone Like You.”\n\n“I was walking toward my trailer on New York Street when about 10 photographers started snapping pictures. I know this sounds like a cliché, but I literally turned around and looked to see who they were photographing. There was nobody standing behind me, and that’s when I realized it was me.\n\n“My life changed that fast. Three days after the opening, I was being photographed and my agent was getting a lot of movie offers.”\n\nJackman accepted a few of those offers – “Kate & Leopold,” “Swordfish” and “Van Helsing,” not to mention four more films scheduled for release this year – but he said he is most proud of his starring role on Broadway as singer-songwriter Peter Allen in “The Boy From Oz.” He won the Tony for Best Actor in a Musical.\n\n“It was a validation from my peers, and that’s important because the theater has always been my first love,” he said. “Success in the theater is less a surprise to me than success in the movies.\n\n“To tell you the truth, I can’t believe I’m in the movies.”"
