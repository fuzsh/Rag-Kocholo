        "text": "I’m Shawn Levy, the director, co-writer and co-producer of “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.” “So what made you finally wear an honest-to-God costume?” This scene happens at the midpoint of the film where Deadpool and Wolverine, this unlikely duo, are on this quest, and they come across an incongruous diner in the middle of this void landscape. And it’s really the first meaty dialogue scene between the two. This has always been one of Ryan’s and my favorite scenes from the moment we wrote it because it puts two iconic anti-heroes in this incredibly generic trope of the Americana road movie. So the mismatch of these visuals two superheroes sitting in a booth in a ‘50s diner. That was a thrill. “Want to talk about what’s haunting you or should we wait for a third act flashback? “Uhh, Go [muted] yourself.” As the scene evolves, What we reveal here in something of a monologue ... “In my world, you’re uh, [clears throat] You’re well regarded.” ... is he’s a fan. He is somewhat reverential and in fact envious of the mythic status of the Wolverine. It’s a quieter scene than we’re used to. It’s a longer dramatic monologue than I think Wade Wilson has ever done. “My girlfriend left me and — “You had a girlfriend?” “Yeah. Vanessa. When we met, she was a dancer. We had a whole life.” And it was a joy for Ryan and I to write because this film is as funny, I hope, as people expect and as action packed, but we were really aspiring to make it genuinely warm hearted and meatier on a character-rooted emotional basis than maybe people expect out of a “Deadpool” movie. And I think the emotionality of the film may very well prove to be its most subversive element."
