        "text": "Box Office: DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE Say No To Superhero Fatigue\n\nWe’ve been hearing about the death of the theatrical experience and superhero fatigue for so long now that we’ve all begun to believe it. Superhero flops like The Marvels, The Flash, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Madame Web made [...]\n\nBlu-ray Review: Ryan Gosling Takes The Hot Seat In Second Sight Films’ Release Of Nicolas Winding Refn’s DRIVE\n\nBased on James Sallis’ novel of the same name, Nicolas Winding Refn’s 2011 thriller, Drive sees Ryan Gosling play a character only known as Driver, a stuntman by day and getaway driver at night, whose relationship with single parent Carey [...]\n\nNotebook Reviews: X-MEN\n\nBryan Singer – 2000. Bryan Singer‘s X-Men is a comic book movie which really delivers the goods in a big, big way. A strong screenplay, good character development and a top-notch cast (Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle [...]\n\nUncovering Curiosities: Woody Allen’s SCOOP\n\nScoop isn’t one of Woody Allen’s finest movies but it’s an entertaining diversion that moves along at a decent pace. The 2006 mystery is one of Allen’s ‘London movies’ and it stars his latter day muse Scarlett Johansson alongside Allen [...]\n\nTrailer & Poster: Neo-Noir Thriller REMINISCENCE Starring Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson & Thandiwe Newton\n\nWriter/director/producer Lisa Joy’s Reminiscence seems to have strong echoes of Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner and Christopher Nolan’s Inception. That’s no criticism, because I’m impressed and intrigued by this trailer [...]\n\nBehind The Scenes: Ryan Gosling & Nicolas Winding Refn On The Set Of 2011’s DRIVE\n\nNicolas Winding Refn’s Drive is great filmmaking at its best – a story of enormous depth, told simply, which is visually stunning without being overly showy. There’s also that soundtrack. The film still holds-up a decade on. Drive is a [...]\n\nBehind The Scenes: James Mangold Directs Hugh Jackman On The Set Of LOGAN\n\nA neo-western told through the prism of a comic book movie, James Mangold’s Logan takes Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and breaks him into a thousand pieces, rebuilding him as a tragic character approaching the twilight of his life. Jackman’s [...]\n\nNotebook Reviews: SWORDFISH\n\nDominic Sena – 2001 Although somewhat disappointing considering the talent involved (John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Vinnie Jones and Sam Shepard, Dominic Sena and Joel Silver), Swordfish highlights that Jackman is a [...]\n\nNotebook Reviews: SOMEONE LIKE YOU / ANIMAL ATTRACTION\n\nTony Goldwyn – 2001 Someone Like You (released in the UK as Animal Attraction) is a somewhat disappointING romantic comedy. It lacks in the witty dialogue department – a must for this type of movie. The great cast works hard (Ashley [...]\n\nRemembering The Cinematic Atrocity That Is MOVIE 43\n\nMovie 43 totally beefed-it at the box office during its theatrical release in 2013 but its $6 million budget mean that it tuned a profit after grossing $8.8 million at the US box office and $32.4 million globally. This comes despite a top tier [...]\n\nJames Mangold Really Hates End Credits Stingers. In Fact, He Really F**king Hates Them\n\nThanks to Marvel studios, end credits stingers are now a common occurrence. One person who doesn’t like them is James Mangold, the man behind the rather great Marvel movie, Logan (read the Movies In Focus review). Mangold was the the 2018 [...]\n\nSee Hugh Jackman & Zac Efron In The New Trailer For THE GREATEST SHOWMAN\n\nI’m not going to make a song and dance about it – here’s the new trailer for The Greatest Showman starring Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya. This has strong visuals, but will it be style over [...]\n\nDVD Review: Hugh Jackman And James Mangold Give Us LOGAN – The Comic Book Movie We Needed\n\nA neo-western told through the prism of a comic book movie, James Mangold’s Logan takes Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and breaks him into a thousand pieces, rebuilding him as a tragic character approaching the twilight of his life. Jackman’s [...]\n\nYou Should Make A Song & Dance Over This Trailer For THE GREATEST SHOWMAN\n\nHere’s the first trailer for the big and bold Hugh Jackman musical The Greatest Showman. This might be a little light on tunes, but you can feel the energy tingle in the background. Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Zendaya (who???) and Rebecca [...]\n\nCracking LOGAN Trailer Inspires Movies In Focus\n\nI walked out of Bryan Singer’s X-Men in 2000 knowing that Hugh Jackman would be a star. While the previous two Wolverine movies haven’t been great, I’m shocked by how good this new teaser for Logan looks. I know a large part of that has [...]\n\nNew PAN Trailer Is Good Looking But Unnecessary\n\nIt remains to be seen if Pan will be successful. After all. Steven Spielberg’s Hook and P.J. Hogan’s Peter Pan failed to set the world on fire in a critical or commercial level. This movie ‘offers a new take on the origin of the classic [...]\n\n10 Things You Need To Know Before You See MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – ROGUE NATION\n\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation hits cinema and IMAX screens at the end of July. The fifth instalment in the franchise once again sees Tom Cruise conduct some gravity defying scenes as intrepid IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Before you check out the [...]\n\nSee Nightcrawler In X-MEN: APOCALYPSE; The End Of X-Men Movies As We Know Them?\n\nBryan Singer has unveiled the first look at Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler in X-Men: Apocalypse. Much like the recent Archangel image release, this sees a new actor slip into the mutant role. Alan Cumming played Nightcrawler in 2003’s X2. [...]\n\nPAN Teaser Poster – Is Peter Pan Getting Old?\n\nWarner Bros is betting big that Pan hits the mark. This big budget prequel to J.M. Barrie’s enduring tale needs to be something special in order to surpass the Disney cartoon and add something new to the tale that hasn’t been covered in [...]"
