        "text": "Looks like Scarlett Johansson’s level of tolerance gets visibly perturbed when directors get cranky on set, but not so much when they’re accused of s*xual abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s no secret that Johansson has stood by the side of the controversial filmmaker through thick and thin. But there were times when even the Black Widow actress, who’s perhaps one his most adamant supporters, couldn’t stand his excessively punctilious attitude and scalding anger. And yet, Johansson didn’t even bat an eye when Allen faced s*xual abuse allegations that were brought forth by his adopted daughter.\n\nShe clearly got mad at Allen for all the wrong reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated: “I believe him”: Scarlett Johansson Defended Woody Allen Amid S*xual Abuse Allegations Despite $140M Director Calling Her ‘S*xually Radioactive’\n\nWhy Woody Allen’s Behavior Upset Scarlett Johansson During Scoop\n\nScoop is a 2006 murder mystery which morphs into a romantic comedy, starring Scarlett Johansson, X-Men star Hugh Jackman, John Wick‘s Ian McShane, and the infamous Woody Allen who also helmed the movie. But while the film might be leaning toward a more comedic side of things, the situation behind the cameras was apparently the exact opposite comprising heated moments and angry retakes.\n\nTalking to Bruce Bozzi on his podcast, Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi, Johansson recalled the time from Scoop’s set when the 87-year-old filmmaker lost his cool while shooting a particular scene because he couldn’t get it right in one go, which ultimately led to multiple retakes and a livid Allen. “He was so angry with himself to the point where it was hysteria,” the Lucy star said of the “silliest, goofiest” scene they were filming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn’t all because Allen’s frustration ended up escalating to such an extent that they had to wrap up for the day which only fuelled his disappointment more. “It was crazy, and then everybody was pissed,” ScarJo remarked. She further explained how the whole thing had been immensely insolent to the rest of the crew as well because it wasn’t just Allen’s day that went to a waste, it was theirs too.\n\nJohansson admitted that at the end of the day, the take in the film didn’t turn out to be all too “great,” but that didn’t grant the director the right to displace his anger on his crew. “The point is, respect the crew. You gotta do the work. You gotta suck it up,” she stated.\n\nRelated: ‘Your sense of reality is completely skewed’: Scarlett Johansson Called Out Cancel Culture For Slamming ‘Ghost in the Shell’ Casting, Supporting Woody Allen Amidst Molestation Charges\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Time When Scarlett Johansson Defended Woody Allen\n\nWhen Mia Farrow accused the Annie Hall director of s*xually abusing their adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, in her 1997 memoir, a number of Hollywood stars distanced themselves from Allen and some even expressed their regret of having collaborated with him. But one person who continued to believe the actor and comedian was Scarlett Johansson.\n\nRelated: “I’m profoundly sorry”: Unlike Scarlett Johansson, Timothée Chalamet Donated Entire Salary from $25M Woody Allen Movie After Regretting Working With Disgraced Director\n\nNot only did Johansson, 38, refused to believe that Allen could ever commit such a vile act, but she also outright dismissed its possibility, claiming how unlike other celebrities who parted their ways with him, she would be up for working with him anytime. “I love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him anytime,” the Don Jon actress pointed out. “He maintains his innocence, and I believe him,” she told THR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScoop (2006) is available on Amazon Prime Video."
