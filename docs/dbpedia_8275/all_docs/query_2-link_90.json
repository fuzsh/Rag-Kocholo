        "text": "Like Robert Downey Jr. and Tony Stark, or Patrick Stewart and fellow X-Men favorite Professor Xavier, it’s near impossible to separate Hugh Jackman from Wolverine, the comic book character he helped immortalize on the big screen, so let’s just get that right out of the way. Jackman will forever be associated with the self-healing mutant with the adamantium claws, and now that he’s officially done playing the character, good luck to whoever attempts to fill his shoes next.\n\nOutside of the X-Men universe, though, Jackman has also proven to be a multi-faceted leading man, starring in romantic comedies (Kate & Leopold, Scoop), sweeping adventures (Australia, Pan), family films (Happy Feet, Real Steel), musicals (Les Misérables, The Greatest Showman), mysteries (The Prestige, Prisoners), and just about everything in between. It’s no wonder some of the biggest directors working today, from Christopher Nolan to Darren Aronofsky to Denis Villeneuve, have sought his talents for their films. And in 2024, he returned to his iconic Wolverine role in Deadpool and Wolverine.\n\n#1\n\nBad Education (2019) 94%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 101629%\n\nCritics Consensus: Anchored by an outstanding Hugh Jackman, Bad Education finds absurd laughs -- and a worthy message -- in the aftermath of a real-life scandal.\n\nSynopsis: A Long Island school superintendent and his assistant are credited with bringing the district unprecedented prestige.

[More]\n\nDirected By: Dexter Fletcher\n\n#8\n\nPrisoners (2013) 81%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 92775%\n\nCritics Consensus: Prisoners has an emotional complexity and a sense of dread that makes for absorbing (and disturbing) viewing.\n\nSynopsis: Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) faces a parent's worst nightmare when his 6-year-old daughter, Anna, and her friend go missing.

Like others of his kind, he needs to be able...
