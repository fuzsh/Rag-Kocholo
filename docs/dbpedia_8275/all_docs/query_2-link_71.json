        "text": "In slow motion, Hugh Jackman rises out of a tank of blue liquid. He shakes the water from his mutton-chop whiskers, veins throb in his neck, his shoulders bulge, claws extend, and he lets out an almighty, woodland- clearing roar. \"If we get it right,\" says Jackman animatedly, \"people are going to go, 'Fuck yeah!' That's the reaction I want. If we don't get that, I haven't done enough.\"\n\nJackman, of course, is talking about X-Men Origins, the latest instalment of the comic-book movie franchise that turned him from a workaday Australian actor into an action movie star. Now 40, Jackman has now made four X-Men films since the first in 2000. He played a gruff cowboy in Baz Luhrmann's Gone With the Wind down-under, Australia (where he tested his riding skills by joining a stampede of 200 wild horses). For Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain (2006), he did a year of intense yoga training to be able to perform the lotus position - underwater - for three days of shooting.\n\nBut while his work ethic is unstintingly impressive, the films can be less so. The Fountain was critically panned and the most notable scene in Australia turned out to be Jackman pouring water over his beefcake torso while a prim Nicole Kidman looked on in mock-horror. And then there was his turn as host of this year's Academy awards, in which he sang, tap-danced and jazz-handed his way into the hearts of most, if not all, of the TV viewing public. (In Newsday.com's online survey, 66.6% of participants rated him \"excellent\"; the New York Post likened him to \"a cheesy cruise-ship entertainer\".)\n\nFor the new Wolverine film, a prequel to the hugely successful X-Men series, he undertook what he himself describes as his most \"full-on\" exercise regime ever. (He dismisses rumours of steroids: \"I'm an actor, man. I don't want to kill myself.\") Up at 4am to eat, training from 6am, a second session in the afternoon, and a small meal every three hours - \"steamed vegetables and chicken, no sauce, no salt\" - until bedtime. His wife of 13 years, the actor and director Deborra-Lee Furness, was no doubt thrilled. \"She gets very annoyed,\" says Jackman. \"She says, 'A husband's job is to be fat and flabby and make me look fabulous.'\" He laughs. \"She said I wasn't living up to my end of the bargain.\"\n\nIt's hard to know what to make of Jackman. He is a likable guy who, despite obvious talent, has not yet scaled the heights of on-screen charisma as compatriots such as the late Heath Ledger or Russell Crowe (who turned down the role in Australia before it was offered to Jackman). Today, in a London hotel, the man with the dubious honour of being voted \"sexiest man alive\" last year by People magazine is looking relaxed, if not quite Wolverine-level buff, in black jeans, zip-necked jumper and just a glint of an expensive watch. Despite having been on extensive promotional duties, he is engaging, polite and happy to reel off cheery anecdotes as fast as my Dictaphone can record them.\n\nJackman is in town with his wife and the two children they adopted after failing to conceive through IVF (a subject on which he has spoken with surprising candour). Oscar Maximillian is now eight, and Ava Eliot, three. He says Furness has imposed a \"two-week rule\" - the maximum time the family can be apart - so where Hugh goes, the Jackman clan goes, too. Father and son spent five weeks together in the outback for Australia: \"We had campfires at night and he'd wake up in the morning and walk the dogs, clean out the chicken coops and do a couple of classes ... It was an unbelievable experience for him.\"\n\nJackman's devotion to his family is nothing if not obvious (his first question to me as we sit down is, \"Have you got kids?\"). Almost invariably when he is photographed on the streets of London or New York, he has Ava on his shoulders or Oscar scootering alongside him.\n\nPeople magazine described him, cringe-inducingly, as \"a hard body with a soft centre\", while even voracious American gossip website TMZ.com have given up hope of catching him on an off-day; after a recent impossibly good-natured exchange with one of their cameramen, they named him \"the world's greatest dad/husband/actor/humanitarian/bacci-baller/speller/ husband\".\n\nJackman was born in Wahroonga, a comfortable suburb of Sydney, the youngest of five children to English parents. His mother returned to the UK when he was eight years old; the children stayed with their father. He has understandably close links with Britain - \"I've got more family here than I do in Australia\" - though his first visit wasn't until 1982, for the wedding of his elder sister (his mum would visit them in Australia, to spare the quintuple airfares). He returned in his gap year, when he got a job as an assistant house master at Uppingham School - the prestigious boarding establishment in the East Midlands from which Stephen Fry was expelled. On one occasion he found himself drafted in to instruct a class of 14-year-olds. \"That's irony. An 18-year-old Aussie teaching English to a bunch of English kids. I thought, if that was my school fees, I'd be pretty annoyed.\"\n\nHis next visit to Britain was in 1999, when director Trevor Nunn cast him as Curly in Oklahoma! at the National Theatre. That same year, Dougray Scott pulled out of Bryan Singer's X-Men, an adaptation of the cult Marvel Comic series. Jackman came off the bench to play the part of Logan, aka Wolverine, the mutant soldier of fortune with an adamantium-clad skeleton, a rockabilly hairdo and advanced anger-management issues. \"Many people in Hollywood were like, 'Mate, before this thing comes out you've got to book another movie.'\" But Jackman stuck to it. With a budget of $75m, it took nearly $300m worldwide after its release in the summer of 2000. X2: X-Men United (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) were huge hits, too.\n\nThe argument for keeping the franchise going makes financial sense, no doubt, but Jackman says he was reluctant. \"For me, there wouldn't have been an X-Men 4. I didn't see any point. There's plenty of characters to exploit, but I thought we'd run the gamut.\" Step forward David Benioff, writer of The 25th Hour and a life-long X-Men fan, with a proposal for a film about Logan's 150-odd formative years. \"I was just blown away by it,\" says Jackman. So much so that he also signed on as producer - \"so it's really clear that I'm just as liable as anybody else to get the flak\".\n\nSure enough, the flak has arrived. First there were reported disagreements on set between the studio and the director, Gavin Hood (best known for South African thriller Tsotsi), resulting in additional shoots - later explained by Jackman himself in an email to the website Ain't It Cool News as scheduling complications. (\"Rest assured that Wolverine will be badass.\") Then, earlier this month, a rough cut of the movie was leaked online by an as yet unidentified source. The 100,000 or so viewers who downloaded it illegally were treated to unfinished special-effects shots of Jackman tumbling onto crash-mats and dangling from a precipice suspended from very prominent wires. Needless to say, the movie was not looking its best, and Jackman stated he was \"heartbroken\". The FBI is investigating the leak, though whether the extra attention the film has received proves a help or a hindrance at the box office remains to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Jackman will turn his attention to a Broadway musical about Harry Houdini, due to open in 2010. If there is any dirt to be dished about Jackman, it will stem from his unapologetic love of musical theatre. He is, by his own admission, a \"big old ham\" and seems to need no encouragement to slip into tap shoes and a singlet. In 2004, he appeared on Broadway in The Boy from Oz, a musical about the life of gay Australian entertainer and songwriter Peter Allen, and won a Tony for his efforts. Some felt the necessity to call Jackman's own sexuality into question (his Wikipedia page, featuring a picture of him surrounded by sailors, doesn't help matters); cue journalists asking about \"those rumours\" and rebuttals from Jackman with typical Teflon-coated humour. When he hosted the Tony awards in 2006 he stated: \"I'm Wolverine, and Wolverine does not do high-kicks,\" before launching into a five-minute jazz'n'tap routine.\n\nThere is one person who maybe, just maybe, gets to Jackman - a Sabretooth to his Wolverine, if you will. When talking about the Aussie community in Hollywood (\"I'm very good friends with Cate Blanchett, and we were friends with Heath, sadly; Eric Bana, I'm really good mates with Eric; Nicole we've been friends with for a long time ... \"), he gives an almost imperceptible pause at one name. \"I'm friendly with ... Russell ... We see each other. We just caught a flight together, had a long chat, you know. We were friendly...\" In Jackman terms, this is as about as close to a character assassination as you're going to get.\n\nLuckily, he has an anecdote to hand. Jackman is a keen supporter of Australian rugby league team Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, while Crowe owns rival club the South Sydney Rabbitohs. \"I was in the newspaper after being at a game and said I was a Manly supporter. The next day my wife and children received a pack of Rabbitohs scarves, jerseys and hats.\" Crowe's tactics converted Jackman's son Oscar, though Jackman himself still manages to be gracious: \"He's done a really good job with the merchandise...\"\n\nWith that, Jackman picks up a small Borders plastic bag and shakes my hand. He has an appointment at a Kensington Gardens playground with three admirers who he has no plans to disappoint."
