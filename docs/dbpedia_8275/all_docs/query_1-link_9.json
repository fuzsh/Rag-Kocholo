        "text": "The Avengers wasn't the only superhero team-up film of 2012. The DreamWorks animated feature Rise of the Guardians assembled Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Jack Frost (Chris Pine), the silent Sandman, and Hugh Jackman as the Easter Bunny! When the evil Pitch Black (Jude Law) attempts to cover the world in darkness, the team must hope that children still believe in them to continue their fight to prove that dreams are more powerful than nightmares. Guardians received mixed reviews, most likely due to CGI animation fatigue. Ultimately, the movie made a little more than double its budget at $306 million and outside of a poorly reviewed video game tie-in, we never saw these Guardians again.\n\n\"Even tots may emerge feeling slightly browbeaten by this colorful, strenuous and hyperactive fantasy, which has moments of charm and beauty but often resembles an exploding toy factory rather than a work of honest enchantment.\" —Justin Chang, Variety\n\nWe're still not sure why this one wasn't titled X3, but the third 20th Century Fox mutant film lost problematic X-Men and X2: X-Men United director Bryan Singer to another superhero film, Superman Returns, and picked up problematic Rush Hour director Brett Ratner in his stead. The film was essentially an adaptation of the Dark Phoenix saga from the comics and gave Famke Janssen's telekinetic/telepathic Jean Grey and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine a lot to chew on. Reviews were mixed, with many critics lamenting the lack of Singer's emotional pathos. Ratner's more action-oriented interpretation also introduced Kitty Pryde (Elliot Page) and Angel (Ben Foster).\n\n\"Following two superior entries, Ratner's slick placeholder of a sequel lacks that crucial X-factor called inspiration.\" —Nathan Rabin, The A.V. Club\n\nFollowing the disappointing first Wolverine solo film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Jackman teamed with director James Mangold for their first take on Logan with The Wolverine. Initially developed with writer Christopher McQuarrie and director Darren Aronofsky, but eventually landing with Mangold and writers Scott Frank (The Queen's Gambit) and Mark Bomback (Unstoppable), the film has Wolverine traveling to Japan to grapple with the past, fall in love, and battle the Yakuza. Critics appreciated the more grown-up vibe and change of scenery. They were also still taken by Jackman's more nuanced intensity this time around. SPOILER ALERT: Jackman and Mangold will return later on this list.\n\n\"The filmmakers work at creating a new take on an old protagonist and then don't really have much new to do with him once they've achieved that. It's a good effort. Just not an entirely successful one.\" —Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic\n\nJackman plays notorious real-life 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart, who was publicly disgraced via the tabloid-inspired political media over his extramarital affair with young Donna Rice. Directed by Jason Reitman (Ghostbusters: Afterlife), the little-seen film was likely a victim of timing, releasing during the Trump presidency when the last thing audiences wanted to see was a film that mixed politics and the media. That said, The Front Runner received mostly positive notices, with Jackman's performance receiving both accolades for leading a strong ensemble and criticism for portraying an underdeveloped and overly sympathetic protagonist. At worst, some critics claimed that Jackman was miscast, and others suggested that he was lost in the political storm.\n\n\"Jason Reitman's The Front Runner is so crowded with characters and overlapping conversations and crammed-full rooms that it's easy to miss the quiet at its center: the enigma that is Gary Hart.\" —Moira Macdonald, The Seattle Times\n\nAn adaptation of the legendary musical that itself was based on Victor Hugo's 1862 post-French Revolution Romantic novel, Les Misérables arrived in 2012 with Jackman playing lead Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who's freed from prison after serving for nearly two decades for stealing a loaf of bread. He joined Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for playing Fantine), Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, and Helena Bonham Carter in the mostly well-received musical that made a mint with over $440 million on a reported $61 million budget. Jackman received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, and he won Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes.\n\n\"After 2½ hours, the movie's become a bowl of trail mix - you're picking out the nuts you don't like and hoping the next bite doesn't contain any craisins. All the carefully crafted misérables turns into a pile of miz.\" —Wesley Morris, Boston Globe\n\nThe first motion-picture assembling of the X-Men was a long-overdue triumph for many comic book fans back in 2000 and went a long way in legitimizing comic book storytelling in the film space. Hugh Jackman would end up playing Logan/Wolverine, the most popular mutant, even though he wasn't exactly a one-to-one representation of the shorter and much hairier character from the Marvel books that birthed him. Critically, the changes didn't really matter, as we got a decent representation of one of the best teams in comics history, even if they all look like they came from the set of The Matrix with their leather-clad costumes. The film received above-average reviews and kicked off a franchise that is still in play 24 years later.\n\n\"I started out liking this movie, while waiting for something really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities if there is a sequel.\" —Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times\n\nJackman teamed with popular director Christopher Nolan in between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight for this story of competitive magicians in late-1800s London whose rivalry turns deadly. Batman and Wolverine—sorry, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman—play the two magicians with future Black Widow Scarlett Johansson as their shared assistant caught in between their egos. The film received mostly positive reviews, with many critics admiring Nolan's craft, but detractors complained that the attempts to create narrative twists à la M. Night Shyamalan didn't produce any real magic. The cast, which also included a sizzling supporting turn by David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, was widely praised.\n\n\"The result is a lopsided yet absorbing movie in which the director is less drawn to his main characters than to those on the periphery.\" —Scott Foundas, Village Voice\n\nOften referred to as one of the greatest comic-book movies, X2: X-Men United saw the beloved group of mutants return for a deeper and more engrossing story. Fan favorite character Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) joined the crew, we learned more about Wolverine's backstory, and Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters was violently attacked by a team led by William Stryker (played by Succession's Brian Cox). Jackman fought at the center of the chaos, and his physical, protective intensity is part of what makes him such a fan-favorite actor. In terms of franchise growth, this sequel made over $100 million more than its predecessor.\n\n\"About twice as good as the original ... bigger and more ambitious in every respect, from its action and visceral qualities to its themes.\" —Todd McCarthy, Variety\n\nWith great success comes the opportunity to lend your voice to animated features. Jackman has participated in several, and the first one to make the list is the LAIKA-produced Missing Link. The film is about a sasquatch, the titular missing evolutionary link (Zach Galifianakis, taking on the extra body hair this round), who comes out of hiding to find his long-lost family, the Yetis, in the Himalayas. Adventure ensues when he enlists the assistance of legendary explorer Sir Lionel Frost (Jackman) and his former flame, Adelina Fortnight (Zoe Saldaña) to help him return home. Reviews were solid, with most critics commenting on the impressive amount of work it takes to make a stop-motion animated movie.\n\n\"It all goes down easily if not exactly unforgettably; a wispy slice of hirsute whimsy.\" —Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly\n\nThe first American film directed by Dune and Dune: Part Two director Denis Villeneuve was the shockingly intense drama Prisoners, which starred Jackman as a father driven mad by the disappearance of two young girls, including his daughter, who violently takes it out on a young suspect played by Paul Dano. The film, which also stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, and Melissa Leo, was widely praised for its go-for-broke performances, with Jackman reaching levels of severity that rival his Wolverine berserker rages. It's still shocking that Prisoners only received a best cinematographer Oscar nomination, but the entire cast would be rightfully recognized by the National Board of Review for Best Ensemble.\n\n\"An impressive US debut for French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, dramatic thriller Prisoners is a potent mix of suspense, emotion and intrigue that draws intense performances from leads Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.\" —John Hazelton, Screen Daily\n\nIt seems that 2006 was an absolutely insane year for Hugh Jackman. He starred in X-Men: The Last Stand, Scoop, The Fountain, The Prestige, Happy Feet, and the Dreamworks/Aardman animated collaboration Flushed Away. The latter, London-based film stars Jackman as a posh rat named Roddy, who is flushed down into the sewers and must learn to survive while he works to get back to his above-the-streets existence. Many reviews referenced Wallace & Gromit studio Aardman's first crack at computer animation and compared the film to that year's big PIxar title, Cars. Notably, the film reunited Jackman with his Magneto X-Men co-star, Ian McKellen, who plays another baddie, Toad, who's looking to wipe out the rats from Ratopolis to make room for the rapidly growing toad population.\n\n\"For a movie that takes place mostly in the bowels of a sewer, Flushed Away has some surprisingly charming moments.\" —Peter Hartlaub, San Francisco Chronicle\n\nAfter striking out with Superman Returns, Valkyrie, and Jack the Giant Slayer, director Bryan Singer returned to the mutant franchise he helped launch with an adaptation of the legendary Chris Claremont and John Byrne's The Uncanny X-Men Days of Future Past story arc. Jackman returned as Logan/Wolverine for the seventh time and bridged the gap/timelines by going into the past and interacting with the younger prequel cast introduced in X-Men: First Class. The film was praised for having the best of both worlds cast, with Jackman's Wolverine navigating both timelines and sharing screen time with both Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy's Professor X and Ian Mckellan and Michael Fassbender's Magneto.\n\n\"With so much going on, and such a ferocious pace, several parts of the story feel undernourished... But what we do get here is largely fantastic.\" —Nick de Semlyen, Empire\n\nSold at the time as a swan song for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine (how will Deadpool & Wolverine retcon this?), Logan once again paired Jackman and director James Mangold for an R-rated ending (of sorts) for Logan/Wolverine at the movies. Frequently compared to Christopher Nolan's acclaimed The Dark Knight, Logan is set in the near future and has old man Logan and an older, dementia-ridden Professor X grappling with mortality and the possible eradication of the mutants. The film won over critics that were usually averse to comic-book content, and the screenplay by Mangold, Scott Frank (Out of Sight), and Michael Green (Blade Runner 2049) was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2018 Academy Awards.\n\n\"If Jackman and Stewart are serious about this being their mutual X-Men swan song, they could not have crafted a more heartfelt valedictory.\" —Peter Travers, Rolling Stone\n\nThe best-reviewed movie of Hugh Jackman's career is perhaps one of his more underseen titles. Bad Education premiered on HBO in the spring of 2020 (at the start of the pandemic) after getting buzz at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. The film is based on a 2014 New York Magazine article chronicling the true story of the largest public school embezzlement in United States history. Jackman plays Frank Tassone, the superintendent of a highly decorated high-school in Long Island, and his assistant Pam Gluckin is played by Allison Janney. The based-on-true-events drama and the performances were widely praised by critics. Jackman would go on to collect his fifth career Emmy nomination—all four prior ones came for appearing on awards shows—while the film won an Emmy for Outstanding Television Movie.\n\n\"It's Jackman, whose smile appears increasingly wolfish as the film goes on (and as Frank's face grows taut with cosmetic surgery), who ultimately owns Bad Education. It's a plum part, sure, but also a deeply unsympathetic one — a chance for the actor to channel his charisma toward dark, mischievous ends.\" —Ben Kenigsberg, The New York TImes"
