        "text": "Australian actor Hugh Jackman is known for his diverse leading man roles on stage and screen. Jackman gained stardom for his portrayal of the Marvel Comics superhero Wolverine from the X-Men film series in 10 films starting with X-Men (2000) to most recently, Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The role earned him the Guinness World Record for \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\", which was later given to Wesley Snipes in the same film.[1]\n\nOn film, he won the Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for his portrayal of Jean Valjean in the musical epic film Les Misérables (2012). He also portrayed Gabriel Van Helsing in the action film Van Helsing (2004), P. T. Barnum in the musical drama The Greatest Showman (2017), and Gary Hart in the political drama The Front Runner (2018). He took starring roles in the romantic comedy Kate & Leopold (2001), the crime comedy Scoop (2006), the thriller The Prestige (2006), the romantic drama The Fountain (2006), the romance adventure Australia (2008), the action film Real Steel (2011), the psychological drama Prisoners (2013), the science-fiction film Reminiscence (2021), and the drama The Son (2022).\n\nJackman started his career on stage in Australia in Beauty and the Beast (1995), and Sunset Boulevard (1996). He received a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical nomination for his breakthrough role as Curly McLain in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical revival Oklahoma! (1998) on the West End. He made his Broadway debut playing Peter Allen in the musical The Boy from Oz (2004) for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He returned to the Broadway stage playing Prof. Harold Hill in the revival of the Meredith Willson musical The Music Man (2021–2023).\n\nHe played a corrupt superintendent in the HBO television movie Bad Education (2019). Jackman hosted Saturday Night Live in 2001, the Tony Awards four times: 57th Tony Awards in 2003, 58th Tony Awards in 2004, 59th Tony Awards in 2005, and 68th Tony Awards in 2014, and the 81st Academy Awards in 2009. He has also voiced roles for Big Mouth in 2021, Human Resources from 2022 to 2023, The Simpsons in 2022, and Rick and Morty in 2023.\n\nActing credits\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Hugh Jackman film credits Year Title Role Notes Ref. 1999 Erskineville Kings Wace [2] Paperback Hero Jack Willis [3] 2000 X-Men Logan / Wolverine [4] 2001 Someone like You Eddie [5] Swordfish Stanley Jobson [6] Kate & Leopold Leopold Alexis Elijah Walker Thomas Gareth Mountbatten [7] 2003 X2 Logan / Wolverine [8] 2004 Van Helsing Gabriel Van Helsing [9] Van Helsing: The London Assignment Voice role [10] 2005 Stories of Lost Souls Roger Segment: \"Standing Room Only\" [11] 2006 X-Men: The Last Stand Logan / Wolverine [12] Scoop Peter Lyman [13] The Prestige Robert Angier and Gerald Root [14] Flushed Away Roddy St. James Voice role [15] Happy Feet Memphis [16] The Fountain Tomás, Tommy and Tom Creo [17] 2008 Deception Wyatt Bose Also producer [18] Australia The Drover [19] The Burning Season Narrator Documentary film; Voice role [20] 2009 X-Men Origins: Wolverine James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine Also producer [21] 2011 X-Men: First Class Uncredited cameo [22] Snow Flower and the Secret Fan Arthur [23] Butter [24] Real Steel Charlie Kenton [25] 2012 Rise of the Guardians Bunnymund / The Easter Bunny Voice role [26] Les Misérables Jean Valjean [27] 2013 Movie 43 Davis [28] Prisoners Keller Dover [29] The Wolverine Logan / Wolverine [30] 2014 X-Men: Days of Future Past [31] Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb King Arthur / Himself Uncredited cameo [32] 2015 Chappie Vincent Moore [33] Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Himself Voice cameo [34] Pan Blackbeard [35] 2016 Eddie the Eagle Bronson Peary [36] X-Men: Apocalypse Logan / Wolverine Uncredited cameo [37] 2017 Logan James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine and X-24 [38] The Greatest Showman P.
