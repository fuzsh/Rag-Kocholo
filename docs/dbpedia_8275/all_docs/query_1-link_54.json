        "text": "It's easy to say Hugh Jackman is a busy man, considering the number of films he has appeared in this year (X-Men: The Last Stand, Scoop, The Prestige, and coming soon: Happy Feet and The Fountain). But as he likes to tell people, \"The truth is: I probably work less than most people. It's hard work, but when you add it up, it's usually not a 40-hour work week. And the good thing about animation is: I can do it while working on another project.\"\n\nJackman's first foray into animation is Dreamworks and Aardman's Flushed Away, which opens nationwide this Friday. In the movie, he voices Roddy -- a well-mannered, sociable rat who finds himself disposed to the sewers beneath London.\n\nIGN recently spoke with Jackman about his work on Flushed Away, his venture into feature film producing, and the future of X-Men.\n\nQ: Being the father of two children now, it's probably quite a thrill for the kids to see their Dad involved with a movie they'll probably watch again and again.\n\nHugh Jackman: It is. I've got a 6-year-old and a 1-year-old now. So probably twice a week I've got an animated movie playing in my house. It's good to be actually involved in one of them. I think I've seen Shrek 100 times.\n\nQ: They've already seen Flushed Away?\n\nJackman: My son, Oscar, he's probably seen about 20 minutes of it -- a 20-minute version of it. He's very excited about it. He'd turned 4 when I started work on it, and now he's 6. Every time I did a [recording] session, he would ask me what happened. So I'd tell him the latest installment. Of course, he wants the half-hour version of it. So there were these characters I'd invented to sort of pad the story out a little bit for him. (He laughs) At this point, he's heard the Lord of the Rings-length version of the story.\n\nQ: What was his reaction? Did it seem kind of strange to hear his Dad's voice attached to an animated character?\n\nJackman: He loved it. I'm sure he'll love the whole thing. For kids, there's just enough fun, just enough bumps and jokes and slapstick to really keep it going for kids.\n\nQ: Has your son seen you in any of the X-Men movies? Is he aware that his dad's the guy who plays Wolverine?\n\nJackman: I've shown about 20 minutes of [the first] X-Men [movie] to Oscar. But I figure it's still a little weird for him to see his Dad slicing people in half. (He laughs) He'd probably like it. It'd give him license to go crazy and go to town at school. So I figured I'd better not do that. Kids at school would say things about his father being in X-Men. One time, all the kids at school were asked to draw a picture about who they want to be when they grow up. Oscar didn't say \"one of the X-Men\" or anything. He said, \"I want to be a Pharaoh.\" I was like, \"Excellent. We need one of those in the family. They have this instant path to the afterlife. This is great!\"\n\nQ: There's a scene in Flushed Away that X-Men fans are going to pick up on. A scene in which Roddy has to select his wardrobe, and one of the choices is a Wolverine costume.\n\nJackman: Ah! Very good! I loved that so much when I saw it. I don't know how many people are going to pick this up, but it's so brilliant. And, of course, I didn't know about this until I saw the movie. When I was voicing it, I was just going \"Hmm... Hmm.... Hmm...\" And that was it. I though it was brilliant when I saw it. For [Roddy], it was probably a smart choice not to go with the Wolverine costume. (He laughs)\n\nQ: In Flushed Away, you really have such a terrific chemistry with Kate Winslet's character [Rita]. Your voices are so entwined with each other, it's as if you're right there with her. Were you recording this together? Did you both ever work together before?\n\nJackman: No, but I do know Kate and we do actually get on very well together. To be honest, Kate is actually one of the best actors going around. She can make anything work. What happened was, when she started to record more, and I was recording, I would listen to her a lot. Sometimes they would even have her playback being played for me while I was recording so I could hear her. Also, I had a fantastic woman named Susan [Duerden] who would read opposite me. She was at every session I did. She was great. She would read every part. She was incredible. She'd go from Toad to Rita to Sid and Whitey; all of them. And the Frog. She did all of them. So I always had someone to work with. But Kate was just phenomenal.\n\nQ: The animation in the film, of course, is just top notch. And, of course, the characters retain that sort of Aardman look, being similar to Wallace and Gromit. What did you think of Roddy when you first got a glimpse of him and how did the character evolve? He does look to have similarities to you.\n\nJackman: I do see some similarities. It's amusing. And in a funny way it's a little frightening to see yourself looking like a rodent. But he's an adorable one. A pampered pet, shall we say. But there were some things, definitely. The way his look evolved or was created was: They were filming me all the time and creating the character as we went. It was great going back in to see how it was evolving and to see how they were using these things, this and that, to put him together. It was interesting.\n\nQ: One the movie's best scenes is with the slugs. A bit of an adventure there. Everyone's certainly going to love that.\n\nJackman: Yes, I loved that sequence! You know what was amazing about that? What I remember is just going, \"Aaaaa! Aaaa!\" in peril. And then they invented the slugs. And seeing them, they're so fantastic. I'm just laughing. They're brilliant. They steel the show, I agree. My son Oscar loves the slugs. They're his absolute favorite.\n\nQ: It was during your time on Broadway that you were able to get over to the studio and voice Flushed Away?\n\nJackman: Yes. I did Broadway for over a year. I started recording the animated projects [Flushed Away and Happy Feet] during that year I was doing the Broadway show. I think I started on Flushed Away in January of 2004. Then when I finished that, I did The Fountain. Then I had a bit of time off while my wife did a film. Then I did a Woody Allen movie, then X-Men, and then The Prestige. With those, there's been a bit of a gap in-between, but I've been busy. There was probably a month off in-between each.\n\nQ: With Flushed Away and then Happy Feet opening a little later, would you say doing voices for animation is something you'd perhaps like to do even more of as it's easy to put the work in while doing something else.\n\nJackman: I wouldn't say it's easy work. It's actually difficult -- the acting. But it's lovely to go to work. You walk into the studio, they turn on a button, and you record everything. There's no hair, no make-up, no nothing. And for 4 hours you can do the entire script. You ad lib and you play around, and you get a lot done. It's easy in that way. I really enjoyed it. I love these movies. I'd be happy to do more.\n\nQ: You've taken to producing now with four movies in the works, including Wolverine. How has the transition been for you?\n\nJackman: I find the transition easy, actually. I find myself thinking more about what's at stake, what the budget is and how soon we need to get things done. Producing ultimately sort of frees things up for me. Right now we're shooting a film in New York, and producing is sort of one of my goals. Apart from the things I love doing in movies, and the roles I want to play, and also being able to give back to people as a producer, I can do films in my hometown and New York is where we're based. Now I can do a film and sort of force the issue to film here instead of shooting somewhere else. I can make sure that film is happening where I live, and that way I can be with my family and I don't have to uproot. It's a great decision. It's a great feeling walking on set as a producer. I went on Thursday and two thoughts come in to mind. The first thought is, \"Wow, look at all these jobs I've created. Look at all these people! This is fantastic!\" And then about a minute later I'm like, \"Why are they all standing around? Come on, people! Let's go!\" (He laughs)\n\nQ: It's hard to believe this whole things started with the first X-Men movie.\n\nJackman: The great thing about having done Wolverine first, in terms of my life as an actor, is that for a year after that film came out, no one recognized me. Even fans, when I was walking down the street. They'd say, \"You kind of look like him, but you're not him.\" At one point, I even got out my driver's license to show him who I was because they were having an argument. To settle the argument I said, \"Actually, I am the guy.\" And the guy was like, \"Sure you are.\" He wasn't happy about it. So, it was this great kind of thing. The movie really opened up my career and gave me great opportunities that I'd never had before. It was something I will always be forever grateful for.\n\nQ: Beyond Wolverine, what's the future of X-Men? Would the movie keep you from making, say, X-Men 4?\n\nJackman: In the immediate future, [Wolverine] will preclude doing another X-Men movie. The plan right now is just to do the Wolverine movie. I don't know what the future is for [the X-Men] franchise. But, I'm almost sure there's no more X-Men movies as we know them. I have heard talk about doing a movie about the younger X-Men, sort of a more kid-oriented thing, which I might play a small part in. And then there's a possible Magneto movie. But beyond that, honestly, I've only heard what you've heard. I've heard nothing official. But I can say we're going to make the Wolverine movie."
