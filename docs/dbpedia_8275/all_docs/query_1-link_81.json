        "text": "I don’t just read, I also watch a lot of movies. I just love stories, in all the different ways they’re told. And I just got this Movie Bucket List poster with 100 movies must-see movies. I started with scratching off everything I’ve already seen.\n\nToday’s movie: The Prestige from 2006, directed by Christopher Nolan . This is, in fact, one of my favorite movies on this top 100 list!\n\nThe film critic :\n\nIt’s a movie where two great magicians, Bale and Jackman, do their damnedest to outdo one another after an accident, ended their friendship. They go beyond everything and everyone to be seen as the best, wrecking their personal lives and relationships along the way.\n\nOn the surface this movie is about rival magicians who want to be the greatest of all time. They trade off blows by one upping each other in various ways. The showmanship is turned up a notch when they each dress up to sabotage each others performances, even causing injuries to spectators. Things take a very impressive character turn when one magician sends his assistant to work for his rival to steal his secrets, only to have her fall in love and throw a wrench into the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Nikola Tesla pops up in a beautiful introduction and amazing piece of film. The sequences involving one magicians arrival to the lair of Tesla is impressive just for its cinematography and photography. Tesla, played by music legend David Bowie, provides a sinister service and really pushes the bounds of science fiction in such a subtle way that most people failed to recognize this film as science fiction for it. Tesla introduces the Angier to his coils of electricity, Angier begs for the machine to further help his theatrics and after a lot of convincing he gets his wish. But it becomes a true sinister plot twist towards the end of the film, and is the knife in the back of the viewer who thinks he’s got it all figured out, but I won’t ruin the ending.\n\nThe director is none other than Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight), and while he’s made other spectacular pieces of film, no one talks about how great this film really is on so many levels. It’s execution is really subtle, if you give it time. Seriously, you have to allow this to melt into your psyche as it can easily be written off due to length and lack of explosive action and typical script writing or twists and turns. There is also a dynamic of “identity” in this film that I won’t discuss or dare spoil the twists that are so carefully plotted.\n\nWhy it’s scary:\n\nThe reason why this film is scary is not so much because it is rival magicians battling for the number one spot, or the plot twists that involve the character Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Borden’s split personality really comes into the spotlight in the “prestige” or the “reveal” which is foreshadowed throughout the whole film by Michael Caine. Some people might focus on this portion of the film and miss Angier & Tesla’s venture into the science fiction world, but we’ll stick with why it’s scary and not the plot structure. To consider psychology, a person so dedicated to his craft that he would risk life and limb is not scary.\n\nI recommend this film ? of course , yes:\n\nI recommend this film. I recommend it for more than just the obvious pairing of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. I recommend it for more than seeing Scarlett Johansson’s beautiful costumes, or Michael Caine’s brilliant portrayal of Cutter.\n\nThe reason I say that is because of the wrench that Nolan throws into the traditional fictional account with Tesla and the “supernatural” that plays up the ending of this film. All I can say is that it involves clones, that’s even too much, but you’ll see why I call this a science fiction film if you watch the film for what it is, and not just the sum of its overall parts.\n\nMY OPINION :\n\nIn conclusion, I loved this movie every time I watched it, and it’s because you can’t get bored in front of it, there is too much mind-boggling revelations.\n\nFinally, I couldn’t really explain the genre of The Prestige, it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy."
