        "text": "The collision of Deadpool, Wolverine and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the 2024 threequel film for Ryan Reynolds’ Merc with the Mouth has much backstory, as does its two heroes, or anti-heroes as some consider, with their own sets of films that establish their histories.\n\nThe Deadpool franchise is pretty simple to follow, since Ryan Reynolds only has two previous standalone films iin the red suit, Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018). Ryan Reynolds does also appear in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). There are several references to Wolverine in the two Deadpool films.\n\nHugh Jackman’s journey as Wolverine is a bit more complicated, with multiple timelines and two actors playing Professor X, or Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart’s older version vs. James McAvoy’s 30 year-old X), and also Magneto (Michael Fassbender vs. Ian McKellen) and some memory loss on the part of James Howlett — or Logan, aka Wolverine.\n\nBelow find two ways to watch all the X-Men movies in which Wolverine appears — release order and chronological or timeline order, from Wolverine’s perspective:\n\nHow to watch Wolverine movies in order by release date:\n\nFilms in which Wolverine appears began with the start of the X-Men franchise in 2000. The 2009 prequel film sets up more of his backstory.\n\nHow to watch Wolverine movies in chronological order:\n\nHugh Jackman has always appeared as Wolverine within the X-Men universe, thought certain films focus more on him than others. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) takes place 20 years before X-Men (2000). The 2009 film covers over 125 years, and it starts with Logan at 12 years old discovering his mutant bone claws. It shows how he agreed to an adamantium bonding process which is how his skeleton and claws became coated in metal. X-Men Origins: Wolverine also ends with a mangled Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and a loss of memory for Logan. X-Men: First Class takes place in 1962 and involves Professor Xavier (McAvoy) and Magneto or Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) trying to recruit Wolverine. He made a surprise cameo in X-Men: Apocalypse during the Weapon X experiments. Sophie Turner’s Jean Grey restores his memory.\n\nRELATED: ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ Timeline: Trace The Development of Shawn Levy’s Threequel\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past resets the timeline in a way because the team prevents the assassination of scientist Bolivar Trask, who is a threat to mutants. involves Logan’s 2023 consciousness getting sent back to his younger self in 1973. X-Men sees Logan get recruited to the X-Men team of mutant soldiers, and he meets Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who becomes his love interest. X2: X-Men United (2003) saw Jean Grey sacrifice herself for the team, but she returned from the dead as the unstable Dark Phoenix, and the team had to decide if her life was worth the chaos she causes. The showdown between the X-Men and Dark Phoenix (Famke Janssen) takes place in X-Men: The Last Stand. The Wolverine (2013) sets the picks up the timeline in 2013, and his mortality begins to show as his healing factor falters. Logan is set in an alternate universe from the other X-Men films and concludes the character’s narrative in a tragic scene when young mutant Laura (X-23) watches him die.\n\nWhere to watch the ‘Deadpool’ & ‘Wolverine’ movies:\n\nLuckily, Logan’s storyline is streaming all on Disney+. A few films here and there are available on Starz and Fubo TV, FX Now or Max. Chronological order is used below to specify which film is where, but for those wanting to watch in release order, Disney+ is your best bet."
