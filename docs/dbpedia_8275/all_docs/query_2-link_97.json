        "text": "How old is Hugh Jackman and where was he born?\n\nHugh Jackman was born on October 12, 1968. He celebrated his 54th birthday in 2022.\n\nHe was born in Sydney, New South Wales, to parents Grace McNeil (née Greenwood) and Christopher John Jackman, a Cambridge-educated accountant.\n\nHis parents were English, and had moved to Australia in 1967 as part of the \"Ten Pound Poms\" immigration scheme.\n\nHugh Jackman shares beautiful moment with fan battling breast cancer - video\n\nWatch Hugh Jackman melt hearts by dancing with elderly superfan Pauline at live show\n\nBecause of this, in addition to his Australian citizenship, Hugh holds British citizenship thanks to his UK-born parents.\n\nHugh has four older siblings, and was the second of his parents' children to be born in Australia. He also has a younger half-sister, from his mother's remarriage.\n\nHis parents divorced when he was eight, and Hugh stayed in Australia with his father and two brothers, while his mother moved back to England with his two sisters.\n\nWho is Hugh Jackman's wife?\n\nIn 1995, Hugh Jackman got his first major acting job in Australian drama series Correlli. It was here that he met his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness.\n\nHe later said that \"Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it.\"\n\nHugh married Deborra-Lee in April 1996, at St John's in Toorak, Victoria, an area of Melbourne.\n\nThe actor personally designed an engagement ring for his partner, and their wedding rings include the Sanskrit inscription \"Om paramar mainamar\", translated as \"we dedicate our union to a greater source\".\n\nSadly, on September 15, 2023, Hugh and Deborra-Lee announced they were to divorce after 27 years of marriage.\n\n“We have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth,” the statement read.\n\n“Our family has been and always will be our highest priority. We undertake this next chapter with gratitude, love, and kindness. We greatly appreciate your understanding in respecting our privacy as our family navigates this transition in all of our lives.”\n\nHow many children does Hugh Jackman have?\n\nDeborra-Lee had two miscarriages during their marriage.\n\nThe couple later adopted two children: Oscar and Ava.\n\n“I don’t think of them as adopted – they’re our children,” the actor told The Herald Sun in 2011. “We feel things happened the way they are meant to. Obviously, biologically wasn’t the way we were meant to have children.”\n\nOscar and Ava are both of mixed race. “We specifically requested a bi-racial child because there was more of a need. People will wait 18 months to adopt a little blonde girl; meanwhile, bi-racial children are turned away,” Hugh told People in 2007.\n\nHugh Jackman interview: Marriage, missing Olivia Newton-John and more\n\nBorn in 2000, Hugh’s oldest child Oscar is 22 years old as of 2022. He is of African-American, Caucasian, Hawaiian, and Cherokee descent.\n\n“When my son was younger, he found out he was part Bosnian, so we went and got this Croatian/Bosnian cookbook and he was very proud to carry that around when he was 7 years old,” his mother Deborra told People in 2020.\n\nYounger sibling Ava is of half-Mexican and half-German descent. “My daughter does dance and I go watch her,” Hugh told Closer Weekly.\n\n“But after The Greatest Showman I had 60 young girls in their tutus coming up to me and my daughter says, ‘You are not coming to dance again!’”"
