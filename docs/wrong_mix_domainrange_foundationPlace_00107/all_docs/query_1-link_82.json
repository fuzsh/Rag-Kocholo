        "text": "NUTRITIOUS MEAL\n\nAdequate nutrition is necessary for health, functionality and the ability to remain independent. Healthy eating can increase mental acuity, resistance to illness and disease, energy levels, immune system strength, recuperation speed and the ability to manage chronic health problems. Meals on Wheels ensures that seniors have access to adequate nutrition even when family support, mobility and resources are lacking.\n\nFRIENDLY VISIT\n\nFor many, the trusted Meals on Wheels volunteer or staff member who shows up every day with a meal and a smile is the only person they see or speak with all day. This special delivery is the reason to get up in the morning, something to look forward to, and a reminder to take good care of themselves. Seniors able to travel to congregate meal sites also receive valuable social interaction and companionship. We can all attest that a meal can be more than the food on the plate, but also the company across the table.\n\nSAFETY CHECK\n\nAlong with the inevitable impacts of aging come the increased risks of medical emergencies, falls and other accidents. The safety check that accompanies each meal delivery ensures that, in the case of an emergency or problem, medics will be called, families will be notified and our seniors will not be forgotten."
