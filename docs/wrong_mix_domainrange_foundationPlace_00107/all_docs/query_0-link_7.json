Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com DRIVETEST, DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING WHAT DRIVETEST IS AND WHAT IT’S NOT Drivetest is a data collection tool on a radio network basically used during and for tuning and optimization. It is a tool for collecting network performance data depending on the radio access technology and such data is used during the tuning process or optimization. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TUNING AND OPTIMISATION You must have been wondering from the definition above about tuning and optimization. Lets consider the following scenerios: You just purchased a new mobile phone. What are the things you need to do before you start using it? 1. Update your contact by getting it from a backup location you have created from your previous mobile phone 2. You need to update your photos, music files, videos, etc 3. You want to setup your email exchange server for you to receive emails 4. You have started using the phone but you need to protect the body of the phone by purchasing a phone pouch or a purse. 5. The phone is infected by a virus, you need to purchase an antivirus online. 6. You need to recharge often so that you are not barred by the mobile operator. Tuning encompasses listing 1 – 3. It is the process whereby all planning parameters (that were considered before installing a site) are achieved before the site is open to the subscribers. It is a stage which is accompanied by after a site has been installed but not yet available for subscriber (traffic) to use. It involves making sure the following is achieved:  Proper handover (intra and inter)  Planning parameters (coverage, transmission, frequency, etc)  Physical properties of the cells including coordinate, azimuths, tilts etc. Optimization is the process which comes after a site has been opened to subscriber traffic. It is the technical term for maintenance as described in listing 4 – 6 above. Tuning can still be done during optimization whenever there is need for re-planning. PURPOSES OF DRIVETEST DT is carried out for various reasons which are stated below.  Coverage: To check if there is coverage or not in a particular location. This is checked with Voice Long call and idle mode (one mobile for long call and another for idle mode)  Retainability: This is the ability of the mobile network in allowing subscribers to make a phone call over a long period of time. The subscriber can be in one place or travelling in a car (a moving subscriber will cause handover to occur on at the instance of the call). This is tested with long calls.\n\n2. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com  Accessibility: This is the ability of the subscriber to dial a call and gets connected. The inability of the network to provide this capability may mean it has access problem. This is tested with short calls. TYPES OF DRIVETEST DT is divided into the various kinds of test or data that can be collected over the radio network. We shall discuss the common once shortly.  Voice calls(Long and short calls, Idle calls)  Data calls (FTP, HTTP, PING, EMAILS)  SMS  Roaming (With International sim cards)  IRAT (Inter Radio Access Technology Handover ie 2G and 3G handover and vice versa)  Benchmark (This is done to compare the performance of different network operators in other to improve the Quality of Service of the operator conducting the test)  Walktest (Indoor test)  Hand over analysis  Site verification and commissioning. TOOLS FOR DRIVETEST Drivetest tools vary due to vendors. For instance, Ericsson uses Tems Investigation and Route Analysis (presently changed to Discovery), MapInfo, MCom and so on while vendors like Nokia/Semens uses Nemo Analyzer, Nemo outdoor, actix analyzer, agilent , Huawei uses GeneX Probe and so on and so forth. Apart from the software, there are a list of DT hardware which must be in place. See list below.  A car/jeep/truck  An inverter to power the laptop and other hardware  Drivetest kit(Software with its respective dongle or license, test phones, GPS units, RF Scanners, portfolio – for benchmark)  A GPS unit for taking coordinates  Microsoft office word, excel and PowerPoint (for reporting). BEST DRIVETEST PRACTICES Before and during a DT, there are certain things that must be available and that must be done to aid the success of the job. They are categorized below: Logistics Make sure you are provided with enough petrol or diesel in your car. This would save you the embarrassment and disappointment of having to stop in the middle of nowhere and in the middle of a job. Also, always check to make sure that your inverter is off while your car engine is not running. It will save the battery life.\n\n3. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com Job Wise Make sure you get the details of the task you have been provided in your place of work. Do not assume the type of DT you are to do, do not assume the RAT(radio access technology – 2G, 3G, CDMA, LTE, WiMax, IS 95 etc) you are testing, ask when you do not understand a concept or a task, be a contributing and good member if you are in a team, be goal oriented, plan your time very well else if you are married you will be divorced and if you are single you will keep changing partners, aspire to learn more about your area of specialization and in the RF field not just DT and you will successfully complete a job and get lots of recommendations from professionals in the field who will want you to work for them. Take notes of radio problem while you do DT. You will work your way into analyzing logfiles or possibly on bigger positions. Equipment Handling DT equipment are very expensive. Some are intellectual property (Software and dongle or license) while some are hardware. Please handle them with care. Do not fold the GPS cables and neither should you fold the scanner cables. You cannot find them in the market for free neither for a token. DO NOT BREAK YOUR DT SOFTWARE DONGLE – YOU WILL KEEP YOUR EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE OUT OF BUSINESS!!! LABS MAKE IT A TASK TO SETUP A DRIVETEST EQUIPMENT PROVIDED BELOW:  A car/jeep/truck  An inverter to power the laptop and other hardware  Drivetest kit(Software with its respective dongle or license, test phones, GPS units, RF Scanners, portfolio – for benchmark) EXPECTED TASK  Make sure you properly connect the inverter in the right order to the battery and cover all bear wires.  Install the DT software you are provided and the driver software of the tools including the Test phones, GPS, Scanners and so on.\n\n4.

Basic understanding of the OSI/TCP network models is required and understanding of the layer 2 and 3 messages. The tables (layer 3, layer 2, events, mode reports) can all be opened one after another by using Presentation  Signaling  Appropriate table. DATA This tab displays PS information obtained from the data card or modem used during a drivetest. You can open each chat displayed here by using the presentation  WCDMA/GSM  Data Service  The chart/table in this picture.\n\n7. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com MAP One of the purposes of having one map in overview and here is that you can erase one of them while the other is used as a control to know where you have covered and where you need to cover during a DT. Maps are loaded here by using the Layer control  add  locate map and/or site data (in tab format)  edit (display and label) where necessary  click the OK button. SCANNER Scanner information (BSIC, interfering BCCH (2G), Scrambling codes (3G) are collected in this mode. You can setup the scanner to scan and what to scan by connecting the scanner, using the equipment dropdown to select the scanner and selecting the scan properties to change scanner frequencies/channels/behaviours as appropriate.\n\n8. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com EXERCISE: Provided you have a scanner, setup a CPICH scan, use an operator frequency in your resident country and provide the screenshot of the process. CTRL & CONFIG This is the control centre of all connected equipment. All equipment connected and supported by TEMS appear on the Equipment configuration table while command sequence is used for automatic calls (voice, sms and data). We shall talk about setting up command sequence later in this presentation.\n\n9. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com Equipment dropdown is active whenever UEs are connected. Equipment property is active whenever UEs are connected. REQUIREMENT FOR A SUCCESSFUL DRIVETEST  Create/save a workspace: This is necessary because it is necessary you create a custom workspace which contain all the tables you need on each interfaces(TABS) discussed above. Any table you do not need, please do not open and if it is open, close it. After you must have opened all the tables required for each interfaces (TABS), goto File  Save As  name your new workspace  click save.  A celref file (celfile) must be provided and if not provided. It is the duty of the DT Engineer to ask for it. It is either in .xml or .cel format and once it is loaded on TEMS, it will remain in the workspace. A replacement to the .cel or .xml is the .tab which can only be opened on the map. Celfile can be loaded into tems by using Configuration  General  Celfile Load  Add  Locate Celfile on your computer  OK  Drive Route And/Or Site list: You need a drive route prepared by the optimization engineer. Drive routes are prepared based on requirements and if you have the ability to create routes, you must follow appropriate instructions regarding it. Follow the presentation on MapInfo® on how to prepare the routes.  Configure the User Equipment (UEs). All test UEs must be connected using the equipment Configuration on the CTRL & COMFIG tab and using the appropriate connect all green button on the standard bar. When you are done with the DT, use the red disconnect all button on the standard bar before unplugging the UEs from the computer. EXERCISE 2.1: Provide the screenshots of how you carry out the lists above.  Locking On Bands, Scrambling Codes, BCCH and RATs In other to lock to the appropriate modes, the icons in the above image are necessary only if the equipment have been connected on TEMS. When you click on the Equipment property, a multi-tab dialog box appears. So follow the list below as it applies to each mode described above.  For bands: Select BAND CONTROL and Choose which band applies to your country and task requirement. You will find 800, 900, 1800, 1900 bands under GSM BAND CONTROL.  For RATs: Select RAT CONTROL or CAS SYSTEM CONTROL and select the technology under testing. You will find Normal, GSM and WCDMA. Normal mode is used for Inter Radio Access Technology HandOver test so that the MS can switch between GSM and WCDMA modes based on provisions on the radio network.\n\n10. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com  For SCRAMBLING CODES: Select WCDMA Cell Reselection and click on lock in the dropdown, select the appropriate operator frequency band, select the appropriate scrambling code(s) and click on APPLY and then the OK button.  For BCCH: Select GSM Cell Reselection and click on lock , select the appropriate BCCH(s) then click APPLY and then the OK button. EXERCISE 2.2: Provide the screenshots of how you carry out the lists above.  Configure the command sequence. The command sequence saves the test engineer the stress of manually dialing voice or data calls and also to ensure uniformity in the call process. The table below shows what must be considered in the appropriate order when you are creating command sequence. Note that one command sequence, one MS as a beginner. Whenever you are setting up the FTP DL, note the following.  The filename must match a particular file on the FTP server and you can confirm that by opening the server using an ftp client such as FileZilla, Limewire and many more.  The location must contain a file that has the same file name as the one in the download. So create a folder and insert a file in it, name the file the same name of the file to be downloaded from the server.  Insert the appropriate EQ, IP address, User name and password. EXERCISE 2.3: Create two sample command sequences, one for voice calls and the other for FTP DL. Use the table provided above and make sure you save your command sequences. Call type/settings Voice calls Data calls Setup a dialup connection and use it in the phonebook entry setting Dial number Loop yes no no yes Wait yes no no yes Dial yes no no yes FTP DL/UL No yes yes No HTTP No yes yes No ping No yes yes No\n\n11. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com EVENT LOGGING It is a good practice to note events that occur during a DT. One of the ways of doing this is by using the EVENT window. You can open it from Presentation  Signaling  Events. Any radio problem that is observed should be written down by noting the actual cell (not site please and if cell id is not available, use bcch or scrambling code). This helps in the optimization process as it enhances it and helps develop the DT engineer into acceptable forms. Also, the EVENT COUNTER which documents the call and KPIs statistics can also be used to provide a report (per logfile) on call statistics correlation and KPIs. This can be opened using Presentation  Analysis  Event Counters. EXERCISE 2.4: Open both Event Counter and Events windows as described above and provide their screenshots.\n\n12. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com REPORT GENERATION AND RAN TUNING REPORT. EXPORTING LOGFILES Exported logfiles are used in the analysis process. Logfiles can be exported to different formats based on the available tools. Due to the scope of this course, we shall focus on text file and MapInfo tab file. Text files can be opened with text editor or a spreadshit program while the MapInfo tab file can be opened on TEMS, MapInfo and other supported software for the purpose of creating pictorial representation of the radio environment and decision making. Logfiles can be exported using Logfiles  Export logfiles  Add export order  (What to look for) What to lookout for:  Format and settings which include what RAT is under testing, the parameters which must include longitude and latitude, cell characteristics (cell id, cell name, interference measurement) etc.  Add logfiles .  Merge output for more than one logfile.  Select the location for storing the exported results. EXERCISE 2.5: Provide the screenshots of how you carry out the activities above. REPORT GENERATOR The report generator tool is used for generating reports for multiple logs and proper understanding of parameters, KPIs, call statistics, MS behavior all of which are represented with chats and graphs. This report helps in the optimization process as it provides the necessary information needed for such purpose. We can use the Report Generator tool by using Logfiles  Report Generator. You will be requested to do the following.  Add logfiles  Edit properties (choose technology, events, parameters, messages)  Select where report is to be stored and the OK button. The report takes longer depending on the size of logfiles and configuration of the computer hardware and it is displayed on a web browser. EXERCISE 2.6: Use a sample logfile, generate this report and create a screenshot of the process as it applies.\n\n13. Please all exercises should be done with MS Word. Zapgrabber or Snippping tool (Win 7) can be used for taking the screenshots. Tosin Adeniyi Adekunle Light_tosin@yahoo.com RAN TUNING REPORT RAN TUNING REPORT is a decision support system report generated from the TEMS Investigation Route Analysis Application. It provides parameters, KPIs, call statistics, MS behavior all of which are represented with pictures, chat and graphs. This report can only be generated only and only if the software dongle is available on the computer and understanding of radio parameters, radio problems, thresholds, database, file types and so on is required. We can use Logfiles  RAN tuning report to generate and follow the appropriate instructions to generate a RAN tuning report. The following must be considered.  If you don’t have a standard database, you need to create new and the option is available in the first stage.  You must have a valid celfile for the cluster under investigation.  You must understand the appropriate threshold for the parameters under investigation.  You must know the appropriate file types you are creating. MIF files will open on MapInfo and can be used to create screenshots for manually generated reports.  You must also have the patience to wait or use the wait time to do other things. There is no time.  The use of computer with high RAM size and virtual memory is adviced to speed up the processing time. EXERCISE 2.7: Use a sample logfile, generate this report and create a screenshot of the process as it applies."
