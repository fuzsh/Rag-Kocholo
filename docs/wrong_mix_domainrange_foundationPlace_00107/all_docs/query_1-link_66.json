With over 700 physicians and 2,100 employees, we are prepared to provide advanced treatments for a wide variety of medical conditions. Our facilities include centers for advanced wound care, sleep disorders, cardiac services, cancer care, emergency services, and more. We’re here to provide members of our community with dedicated care you deserve.\n\nContinuing a Strong Legacy of Health Care\n\nOurs is the first hospital in the United States to be named after a nurse. Born in 1876, Clara Maass dedicated the most of her life to helping others. Her determination to save lives led her to participate in a bold yellow fever experiment in which she willingly subjected herself to bites from infected mosquitoes. The experiment led to her death, but the study was instrumental in the eventual creation of a yellow fever vaccine.\n\nWe are proud to carry on Clara Maass’ legacy by pushing health care to new heights through innovative treatments and supreme dedication to our patients. Our hospital was named in her honor so that we will never forget the incredible resolve a medical professional can have for helping people and saving lives."
