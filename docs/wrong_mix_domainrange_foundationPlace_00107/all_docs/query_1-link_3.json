In the states of Illinois and Missouri sinking concrete is all too common which is why our company has gone to great lengths to develop fast and effective concrete lifting and leveling solutions. PolyLevel® is a revolutionary product that is minimally invasive and not only lifts and levels concrete but also stabilizes it. The concrete lifting and leveling process begins with a few small holes drilled in the slab, then the PolyLevel® polymer is poured into the holes. After only about 15 minutes the polymer is dry and the concrete is ready to be walked and even driven on. This concrete lifting and leveling technique is faster, less disruptive and arguably more effective than mud jacking which is the procedure PolyLevel® replaces. To removed tripping hazards, stabilize concrete, and lift it back to a level height nothing is faster or more effective than PolyLevel®.
