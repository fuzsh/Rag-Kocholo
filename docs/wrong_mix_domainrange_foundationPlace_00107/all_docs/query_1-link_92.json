        "text": "Calvin Langdok was born on March 7, 1962 in Madison, Wisconsin to Ralph and Sharon (Bedessem) Langdok. He passed away on April 21, 2024 with his sister Susan (Langdok) Kaja, brother-in law, Rick Kaja and best friend, Arvid Berge by his side. Calvin experienced a very sudden decline in his health and was put under the care of Agrace Hospice while he was a resident in Community Living Connections (CLC). Calvin was just 62 years old.\n\nWith a heavy heart, I am writing my only brother’s obituary and find myself reflecting on what he taught me about living. One thing for sure is that he was adaptable, resilient and consistently learning how to navigate this thing called life.\n\nAt the tender age of seven years old, Calvin developed a brain tumor, which, upon its removal, caused delayed brain development. This kept him in a child-like state for the rest of his life. Our parents didn’t let that change how he was raised and encouraged him to be an independent and self-reliant individual.\n\nDuring his youth, there was never a day you wouldn’t witness his independence in action. Calvin navigated around the Village of Belleville effortlessly with his blue three-wheeled bike: catching up with folks at the Milk Pail restaurant, J&M’s or Borland’s bar. In 1983, Calvin graduated from Oregon High School. In 1985, he moved to Madison where he joined Residential Facilities Development Foundation (RFDF) that started supporting him with an apartment and roommate on Raymond Road. Several years later, he transitioned to Community Living Connections (CLC) where he lived in a few different apartments/homes in that same area for the next 35+ years, his most recent year of residency in Stoughton, Wisconsin.\n\nIn the late 1980’s, Calvin met Arvid Berge who was at the time volunteering for the Literacy Council Club of Madison where he was paired with Calvin to teach him how to read. After a few meetings, it was clear that Calvin was dyslexic, and any efforts in learning to read would be futile. Determined to keep spending time with Calvin, he committed one evening a week to do activities with him. For the next 35+ years, Calvin and Arvid did everything together – they both shared the same love of music and became well ingrained into the blue grass music community where Calvin would sing and play a few bars on his harmonica. They enjoyed making apple cider, attending many Madison or Belleville area festivals, including Brat Fest, visiting nursing homes singing “You are My Sunshine” to the residents, participating in Special Olympics along with being part of a billiards pool club and numerous bowling leagues. If there were people there, Calvin was sure to be visible in the crowd.\n\nIn early 1990’s, he became associated with Goodwill Industries where they helped him with job placements. He worked at a frozen custard shop, a few different food restaurants in the Westgate area, followed by his last meaningful job at Glass Nickels Pizza Company in Madison. He was so proud to have a job and he felt daily purpose in working and most importantly connecting with people which provided him with a well-rounded and fulfilling life.\n\nCalvin always enjoyed keeping busy and when he wasn’t exploring the Raymond Road neighborhood on his John Deere riding lawn mower, he was hanging with his friend Gene Bennet who was the owner of Bennett’s Bar. Gene encouraged Calvin to start a lawn mowing business. He started to make extra cash mowing many lawns in the neighborhood. Calvin loved that green tractor and was very resourceful using it as a mode of transportation. So much so, he burned through a few tractors and many, many sets of tires.\n\nIn early 2001, Calvin became an uncle for the first time. He loved his niece Emma and when he wasn’t seeing her would always ask what she was doing. In 2002, he became an uncle again to his nephew Austin. He loved being an uncle and would proudly boast showing their baby pictures to anyone around. Calvin was a big family man and was at nearly every relative celebration with his mom and dad by his side.\n\nThe one thing I will always remember about Calvin was that along with his enormous heart, he absolutely loved to give hugs. His loud presence, boisterous energy and infectious laugh could fill any room. He was like Norm from Cheers, and everyone seemed to know his name wherever he went. He loved being with people and his purpose in life was connecting with everyone and being needed.\n\nCalvin, although you were not dealt the most favorable cards in life, I will forever cherish all the gifts that you gave in showing others how to persevere and overcome obstacles, do what you love and find purpose in this crazy thing called life. Your energy and bear hugs will be dearly missed. Keep riding your John Deere in the forever green grasses of heaven!\n\nA public gravesite service will be held at 1pm on Saturday, April 27, 2024, at the Paoli Cemetery, 1217 Hwy PB, Paoli, WI. Following the service there will be a funeral luncheon at North and South Seafood & Smokehouse Restaurant, 958 Liberty Drive, Verona WI 53593.\n\nIf weather conditions are rainy, please bring an umbrella.\n\nCalvin’s family would like to extend a sincere thank you to all the organizations that provided support for Calvin throughout the years, including: Agrace Hospice, Community Living Connections, Residential Facilities Development Foundation, Care Wisconsin, Fiscal Assistance, Special Olympics, and Goodwill Services."
