        "text": "Building Your Foundation… Please complete your application below.\n\nWe have a dream to bring the World to Belleville – Aaron Rodgers, Josh Groban, Garrison Keillor, The Dali Lama, Danny O’Donnell, Dolly Parton, Bo Ryan and your favorite person or group. When each area household and business invests in one BACF membership share, we will have the greatest small town foundation in the World!\n\nYour membership in the BACF is a share in your community’s foundation that will make a difference for you and future generations in the Belleville area – forever.\n\nTHE FUNDS\n\nThe unique BACF membership plan places your tax deductible memberships fees in bank and investment funds. The principal is never spent! Only the interest earned is spent on new programs. The beauty of the BACF funds is that more members means a greater fund, greater earnings and greater programs.\n\nCurrent members have done their share. As your friends and neighbors, they make our programs possible. They need your support. If everyone does their share in the BACF, anything is possible for future programs and inspiration for our youth and future generations.\n\nYour BACF Directors have made it possible for every household and business to afford a $500 membership share with annual payments as low as $50 (the price of a tank of gas or a dinner out). Many of your neighbors, friends, businesses and organizations have joined.\n\nIt takes a village to build a Foundation. The sooner your membership donation becomes part of the fund, the sooner more programs can come to our community. The goals mean greatness for Belleville, our members, our children, grandchildren, future generations and our foundation. You cannot out-give your community.\n\nBENEFITS:\n\nPlease Complete Your Membership Share Form to begin sharing these benefits:\n\nYour membership share is a gift to your family and your community and the future.\n\nYou will be proud to be a member who has bought a share!\n\nYour investment with your neighbors makes the Belleville area a better place to live.\n\nYou help bring the arts, education, entertainment and special events to the area.\n\nYou help keep the cost of tickets at a minimum, even free.\n\nYou inspire your children and grandchildren with inspiring programs.\n\nYour support finances a BACF annual scholarship to a deserving student.\n\nYou can help select the educational and entertaining programs of the future.\n\nYour Foundation involves our youth in our programs when possible.\n\nYou will not have to drive to Madison to see great performances.\n\nYou help bring recognition to the Belleville area for our special events.\n\nYou help bring people and business to the Belleville area during programs.\n\nYou are recognized publicly as a contributor to your community’s welfare.\n\nYour investment in your community is the best form of business advertising.\n\nYour contribution is affordable and tax deductible.\n\nYour contribution helps the current members who are carrying the load.\n\nMEMBERSHIP APPLICATION:\n\nYour Membership Share involves the tax deductible donation of $500 payable $50 per year for 10 years, or $100 for 5 years, or $250 for 2 years or $500 when joining. The first payment is due when you join and each year thereafter in October until paid in full. The low $50 annual payments make it possible for most anyone to be a member. Your membership payments go into a permanent bank and investment funds of which only earnings are used to make future events affordable.\n\nYOUR BACF MEMBERSHIP SHARE APPLICATION FORM\n\nQuestions?
