        "text": "Buyers Guide: Ro<strong>of</strong>ing Structures, page <strong>25</strong> Vol. 10.4 <strong>25</strong> <strong>Years</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Lighting</strong> <strong>Springsteen</strong> Bruce <strong>Springsteen</strong> and the E Street Band’s tour in support <strong>of</strong> Working on a Dream is the culmination <strong>of</strong> <strong>25</strong> years <strong>of</strong> experience that lighting designer Jeff Ravitz brings to the table. The totally fog and haze-free show is a masterpiece <strong>of</strong> lighting using color and angles to underscore the emotion <strong>of</strong> the music. In the first <strong>Springsteen</strong> tour with non-IMAG video imagery, a low pr<strong>of</strong>ile LED display backs the low-key set and provides not only color and graphics, but also acts as a light source at times. The IMAG screens on either side <strong>of</strong> the stage along with the video backdrop all work with the lighting to reinforce the energy <strong>of</strong> the music. The lighting rig is a <strong>com</strong>bination <strong>of</strong> moving lights, a few conventionals and several followspots, all orchestrated by lighting directors Todd Ricci and John H<strong>of</strong>fman. H<strong>of</strong>fman runs an MA <strong>Lighting</strong> grandMA while Ricci operates an Avolites Diamond 2 console and calls followspots. Joining the lighting crew at the FOH position is Russ Hochstedler, who runs the Green Hippo Hippotizer media server, while video director Chris Hilsson resides in video world.

The agreement also applies to seven forth<strong>com</strong>ing NETworks productions. “This agreement will provide meaningful benefits to NETworks’ crews,” said Matthew Loeb, IATSE International president. “It also secures this work under IATSE jurisdiction and expands our presence in the one-night and split-week touring markets.” MAY 2009 RCF Group Buys Majority Stake in SGM TAVULLIA, Italy — RCF Group has purchased 51 percent <strong>of</strong> SGM Technology for <strong>Lighting</strong> S.p.A., based here. RCF, a public <strong>com</strong>pany listed on the Milan stock exchange, was formed by the <strong>com</strong>panies RCF and AEB (dB Technologies). “It is a great opportunity to us to be<strong>com</strong>e one <strong>of</strong> the <strong>com</strong>panies <strong>of</strong> the RCF Group,” said Gabriele Giorgi, managing director <strong>of</strong> SGM. “Over the years we have built a very dedicated team and, together with our worldwide distribution partners, we have significantly expanded our international sales. “Looking ahead we felt it was time to structure our <strong>com</strong>pany for a more demanding market and, being part <strong>of</strong> larger group, will provide SGM with immediate access to additional technical and financial resources,” continued on page 6 Mike Murphy Named President <strong>of</strong> J. R. Clancy, Inc. SYRACUSE, NY — Mike Murphy, executive vice president <strong>of</strong> J. R. Clancy, Inc., has been named president <strong>of</strong> the rigging design and manufacturing <strong>com</strong>pany. A veteran <strong>of</strong> the theatre rigging industry for more than 30 years, Murphy joined J. R. Clancy 12 years ago. His responsibilities have included administration <strong>of</strong> Clancy’s International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001 activities, making him responsible for the development and implementation <strong>of</strong> Clancy’s quality management program. continued on page 5 36 38 40 PROJECTION CONNECTION Starts on page 31 Old School Looks, Timeless Appeal DAVID SCHEINMANN In an era <strong>of</strong> movie and musical retreads, Billy Elliot: the Musical is not the kind <strong>of</strong> show you’d think you would enjoy, yet you do. Broadway’s take on the well-known tale <strong>of</strong> a boy born to dance in a mining-town milieu gets a classic theatrical look with veteran LD Rick Fisher’s old-school approach to new gear. Although the rig is dominated by moving lights, you might not know it from watching the show. “You rarely see a light just <strong>com</strong>e up in one place and be one thing and then morph into something else,” Fisher says. “Hopefully, when it does that, it does that more for an emotional reason than to mark a beat with music.” For more, turn to page 18.
