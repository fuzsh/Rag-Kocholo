        "text": "Last night, Bristol duo Fuck Buttons tore up the stage at Mercury Lounge, leaving ears deaf and feet eternally exhausted. Set apart by a table full of tricks, the set was an hour of pure experimental bliss, combining elements of techno and tribal beats (and everything in between.) It took the crowd a bit too long to get warmed up, but once Andrew Hung jumped into the crowd, no one was allowed to stay still.\n\nCompared to their opening slot last month at Bowery, it was nice to be up close and personal to really take a look at the technical work that goes into their set. It's quite extraordinary to see a fisher price tape recorder amongst the sea of synthesizers to execute their original sound. But once the game boy was whipped out, I knew we were in for quite a treat.\n\nI surprised myself with how amazing I think this \"band\" is. I'm not one for the experimental rock genre, nor do I have patience for instrumental music these days (sorry, I like to sing a long). But thinking about the first half of '08, I can't say that anyone has impressed me as much as Fuck Buttons. What started out as a funny name yielded me to pop in their incredible debut to take a listen. And while it does take a lot of patience for the pay off, it's well worth it in the end.\n\nMore pics under the cut.\n\n√Ç"
