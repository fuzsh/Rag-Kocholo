        "text": "PRINCE2® Foundation and Practitioner Certification Training FAQs in Belleville, IL\n\nWhat is PRINCE2?\n\nPRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured project management method based on experience drawn from thousands of projects - and from the contributions of countless project sponsors, Project Managers, project teams, academics, trainers and consultants.\n\nPRINCE2® is a method for managing projects. It helps you work out who should be involved and what they will be responsible for. It gives you a set of processes to work through and explains what information you should be gathering along the way.\n\nPRINCE2 may be similar to what you currently use, but what it does best is pull together common names and descriptions into a structure that anyone familiar with PRINCE2 can understand, regardless of background or industry.\n\nPRINCE2 is a non-proprietary method and has emerged worldwide as one of the most widely accepted methods for managing projects. This is largely due to the fact that PRINCE2 is truly generic - it can be applied to any project regardless of project scale, type, organization, geography or culture.\n\nIs PRINCE2 aimed at any particular type of project?\n\nPRINCE2 is designed to be applied generally to all types of project, be they construction, engineering, IT, business, financial or whatever. In the past, it has been aimed at IT projects, and so it is still well used in this area however there has been significant growth recently in other industries.\n\nWhich countries recognize PRINCE2?\n\nWith over a million exams already taken globally PRINCE2 is already recognized as the worlds most popular project management methodology.\n\nWhat will a PRINCE2 qualification do for me?\n\nA qualification in PRINCE2 will not only boost your skills and confidence when managing projects but will greatly improve your employment prospects. Many organizations, both private and public, mandate the use of PRINCE2 and therefore require their staff to be competent and qualified to practice the method.\n\nWhy do I need a PRINCE2 qualification?\n\nIndividual\n\nThe PRINCE2 project management methodology is the de-facto standard for project management in the UK and is practiced worldwide. It covers the management, control and organization of a project. A qualification in PRINCE2 will not only boost your skills and confidence when managing projects but will greatly improve your employment prospects. The majority of people that consider PRINCE2 as a qualification do so for career and personal development reasons. Often this is driven by a change of job or career, where you notice that to get to the top of the CV pile, you need to have an extra qualification like PRINCE2 (even if you have been managing Projects successfully for many years without it). In many advertised positions PRINCE2 has become a prerequisite.\n\nCompany\n\nThe majority of companies that implement PRINCE2 also encourage their employees to receive training and take exams. This often proves instrumental in facilitating the successful adoption and implementation of the PRINCE2 method into an organization. By training employees to the required qualification level you ensure a consistent approach, common language and a clear understanding of the defined processes, controls, roles and responsibilities required to help facilitate successful projects.\n\nHow do I get recognized in PRINCE2?\n\nIt depends on if you are an individual or company. To get recognized in PRINCE2 as an individual you need to achieve certification at either Foundation or Practitioner level. As a very rough guideline if you are involved in Projects in a supporting role (you may be in a marketing, administration or technical job), Foundation level may be suffice. If generally you are leading projects then Practitioner is the level you should aim at.\n\nFor companies wishing to adopt PRINCE2, the route tends to be slightly different. The biggest decision is decide if PRINCE2 is right for you, and that requires an investment of time, collecting and reviewing information from the marketplace.\n\nYou could just take the view that with over one million people having taken the PRINCE2 exams so far, it must be pretty proven and successful; otherwise it would not have the worldwide take-up it does.\n\nOnce you have decided to implement PRINCE2, then you need to plan an adoption strategy. The most common approach is to train an initial group of people, then run a PRINCE2 project to decide if PRINCE2 is right for you, or run a pilot PRINCE2 project. Remember that PRINCE2 is configurable, so from the initial Project you can start to look at what parts of PRINCE2 you may or may not use.\n\nWhat are the PRINCE2 qualifications and what will they teach me?\n\nThe PRINCE2 Foundation qualification will teach you the PRINCE2 principles, terminology and when qualified you will be able to act as an informed member of a project management team using the PRINCE2 methodology within a project environment supporting PRINCE2.\n\nThe PRINCE2 Practitioner qualification will teach you to apply PRINCE2 to the running and managing of a project within an environment supporting PRINCE2. Once qualified you will be able to apply and tune PRINCE2 to address the needs and problems of a specific project scenario. You will have a comprehensive knowledge of the relationships between the PRINCE2 principles, themes and processes and PRINCE2 products and will understand these elements.\n\nThe PRINCE2 Re-Registration qualification is designed for those who have passed PRINCE2 to Practitioner level and wish to maintain their Registered Practitioner status. The PRINCE2® Examination Board has determined that all PRINCE2 Practitioners should be re-registered within 3-5 calendar years of their original certification (failure to pass the Re-Registration examination after five calendar years as a Registered Practitioner will result in withdrawal of your registered status).\n\nAre there any prerequisites before taking a PRINCE2 examination?\n\nPRINCE2 Foundation: Delegates should have some understanding of Project Management but there is no formal prerequisite for the Foundation qualification. If you need to study a generic project management course then our APM Introductory Certificate course may be of interest.\n\nPRINCE2 Practitioner: Yes, you cannot attend the PRINCE2 Practitioner exam until you have successfully passed the PRINCE2 Foundation qualification.\n\nI've done the Foundation training and exam how do I become a Practitioner?\n\nYou need to sit a two day upgrade course - this is available as an intensive classroom course or as online learning.\n\nWhat is the PRINCE2 exam format?\n\nThe exam formats are as follows:\n\nFoundation Examination Design\n\nExam Design\n\nNumber of questions reduced to 60 (previously 75 with trial questions), and no trial questions\n\nExam duration unchanged (1 hour)\n\n(Pass mark may be adjusted following standard setting)\n\nNegative questions removed, except where it is part of the learning outcome to know that something shouldnt occur (e.g. NOT, FALSE, INCORRECT)\n\nNumber of list and missing word questions reduced, i.e. more standard questions\n\nFoundation Exam Structure\n\n5 Questions on key concepts\n\n8 questions on principles\n\n28 questions on themes\n\n3-5 questions on each theme\n\n19 questions on processes\n\n2-3 questions on each process.\n\nPractitioner Examination Design\n\nExam Design - Questions\n\nNumber of questions (marks) reduced to 75 (previously 80)\n\nExam duration unchanged (2.5 hours)\n\n(Pass mark may be adjusted following standard setting)\n\nQuestion styles removed:\n\nMultiple response\n\nAssertion reason\n\nQuestion styles retained:\n\nMatching (for BL3)  max 3 marks with 5-6 tokens\n\nClassic (for BL4) e.g. Yes, because\n\nPractitioner Examination Design\n\nExam Design  Scenario/Information\n\nCandidates will only need to refer to:\n\nA one-page project scenario\n\nOne page of additional information for the organization theme (person profiles)\n\nApprox. 4 lines of information before the question stem to provide the context (especially BL4 questions).\n\nIn other words:\n\nNo separate lengthy additional information (except for organization theme)\n\nNo delete entry 1, amend entry 1 questions!!\n\nPRINCE2 Re-Registration\n\nThe PRINCE2® Examination Board has determined that all PRINCE2 Practitioners should be re-registered within 3-5 calendar years of their original certification (failure to pass the Re-registration Examination after 5 calendar years as a Registered Practitioner will result in withdrawal of your registered status). This Re-Registration comprises a 1-hour examination set at the same standard as the Practitioner examination. If you have taken the PRINCE2 Practitioner certification since October 2000 you have agreed, or are agreeing, to this requirement as part of your initial application and so are now designated as Registered Practitioners.\n\nPractitioners certified prior to October 2000* have the opportunity to take the re-registration examination in order to demonstrate their commitment to professional development. Those who qualified after January 2001 or have voluntarily undertaken the re-registration certification are designated as Registered Practitioners, which enables employers and prospective employers to be confident with their knowledge and commitment to Continuing Professional Development.\n\nPRINCE2 Re-Registration Examination Format\n\n Objective testing 3 questions - 10 question items per question, each worth one mark\n\n 17 marks or more required to pass (out of 30 available) - 55%\n\n 1 hour (60 minute) duration, no additional reading time\n\n Open book exam (official PRINCE2 manual only)\n\nHow long are the PRINCE2 qualifications valid for?\n\nThe foundation examination is not valid for a defined period and will not expire.\n\nCandidates who pass the practitioner exam are recognized as a 'PRINCE2 Registered Practitioner'. Individuals will remain registered for a period of 5 years. To maintain the registered status, practitioners must complete and pass a PRINCE2 re-registration examination 3-5 years following their initial/previous practitioner certification."
