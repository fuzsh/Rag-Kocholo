        "text": "Types of foundation repair include leak repair, crack repair, stabilization, underpinning, and waterproofing.\n\nFor both leak repair and crack repair, a technician will come to your home, perform an inspection, and use various measures to fix leaks or cracks. The cost of these procedures will vary greatly depending on the size and root cause of the issue.\n\nStabilization reinforces bowing walls by inserting steel or carbon fiber strips. The cost will depend on the material chosen and the number of strips required. The cost of underpinning also varies. This process, also called piering or leveling, involves underpinning your foundation with concrete piers to level it; the cost depends on how many piers are needed.\n\nIf you're interested in waterproofing your foundation or basement, we suggest looking for a waterproofing specialist. This process might include outdoor waterproofing, indoor waterproofing, or both.\n\nIf you're constructing a new house, have a soil report completed. A soil report will contain information about how well the soil on a given piece of land can support a foundation, and can offer you a heads-up about any potential future issues. If you have concerns about an existing house, a few hundred dollars will cover an inspection and report by a structural engineer. The engineer can point you to any current problems that need attention, and give you advice on avoiding future problems.\n\nAlso ensure that the moisture around your foundation is appropriate. Don't let the soil around your Belleville home get too dry or too wet; at different times, you might find yourself having to reroute your gutters or water your foundation. You should also stay vigilant for leaky pipes or gutters, so you can get them repaired promptly.\n\nWe recommend that you do not put off foundation repairs. A single issue may have an underlying cause that could lead to numerous future problems, and it's best to get ahead of the issue as soon as possible. A small and moderately costly problem now could turn into a large and expensive one in the future if the signs are ignored."
