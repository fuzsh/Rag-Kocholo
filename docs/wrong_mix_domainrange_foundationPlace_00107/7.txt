Land Acknowledgement

The City of Belleville acknowledges we are meeting today on the territory of the Huron-Wendat, the Anishinaabeg, and the Haudenosaunee people. We recognize and honour the historic relationship of the Indigenous peoples to this land, and acknowledge our shared obligation to respect, honour, and sustain these lands and the natural resources contained within.

We recognize all First Nations, Métis, and Inuit who call Belleville their home, and support the need for cultivating a strong relationship with them. We look forward fostering a path towards reconciliation and show respect for the Indigenous peoples who first lived and currently live on the land where we now all reside together.

A great place to live

The city of Belleville is located on the north shore of the Bay of Quinte. Ideally situated between Toronto and Montreal, and less than one hour from the U.S. border, Belleville truly is at the center of it all. Approximately 55,000 people make Belleville their home and over 200,000 live within 30 minutes of the city. Belleville’s bustling city streets contrast the rolling rural landscapes that surround them.
