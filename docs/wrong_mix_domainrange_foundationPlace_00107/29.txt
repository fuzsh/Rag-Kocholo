Building Your Foundation… Please complete your application below.

We have a dream to bring the World to Belleville – Aaron Rodgers, Josh Groban, Garrison Keillor, The Dali Lama, Danny O’Donnell, Dolly Parton, Bo Ryan and your favorite person or group. When each area household and business invests in one BACF membership share, we will have the greatest small town foundation in the World!

Your membership in the BACF is a share in your community’s foundation that will make a difference for you and future generations in the Belleville area – forever.

THE FUNDS

The unique BACF membership plan places your tax deductible memberships fees in bank and investment funds. The principal is never spent! Only the interest earned is spent on new programs. The beauty of the BACF funds is that more members means a greater fund, greater earnings and greater programs.

Current members have done their share. As your friends and neighbors, they make our programs possible. They need your support. If everyone does their share in the BACF, anything is possible for future programs and inspiration for our youth and future generations.

Your BACF Directors have made it possible for every household and business to afford a $500 membership share with annual payments as low as $50 (the price of a tank of gas or a dinner out). Many of your neighbors, friends, businesses and organizations have joined.

It takes a village to build a Foundation. The sooner your membership donation becomes part of the fund, the sooner more programs can come to our community. The goals mean greatness for Belleville, our members, our children, grandchildren, future generations and our foundation. You cannot out-give your community.
