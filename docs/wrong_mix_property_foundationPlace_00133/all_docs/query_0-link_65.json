        "text": "Biography\n\nHi, my name is Kevin. I am a big OSS enthusiast, Testcontainers core-maintainer, Oracle Groundbreaker Ambassador and currently pursuing my PhD in computer science in the field of distributed systems engineering (more specifically Smart Contract security and verification in Blockchain networks). Besides enjoying to work on technical tasks and contributing to OSS, I also love to teach and mentor people and to interact with the community as a whole. Therefore I became an active conference speaker some years ago and especially like to give talks at JUGs and meetups, or to participate in more interactive formats, such as hackergarten. When Iâ€™m not doing tech or science stuff, I like to play make music and play guitar in one of my bands, such as Iron Kobra.\n\nApart from my involvement with the Java community, I started to collaborate with my wife on tasks related to her research and PhD work, such as data analysis in behavioural science and, more recently, animal tracking using neuronal networks and low latency video streaming."
