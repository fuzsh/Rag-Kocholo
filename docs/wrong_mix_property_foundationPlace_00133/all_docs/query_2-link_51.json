        "text": "Laid out in 1878, Bochum Stadtpark (City Park) is one of the biggest parks in North Rhine Westphalia. Forests and park areas such as the rose or rhododendron are complemented by ponds and monuments. The Bismarck Tower provides views over the officially protected site. You can walk to the park in ten minutes from the H+ Hotel Bochum.\n\nAs the biggest mining museum in the world, the German Mining Museum houses a wide range of exhibits from the history of mining and mining machinery. A viewing mine area explains the tunnel boring machinery and the process of coal production. The production tower provides a great view far across the Ruhrgebiet. The drive here takes a good five minutes from the H+ Hotel Bochum.\n\nStiepel Village Church is on eof the oldest preserved buildings in Bochum. The single-nave church was built in the 11th century and was decorated between the 12th and 16th century with murals including ornamentation, religious images and biblical stories. It is about 20 minutes away from the H+ Hotel Bochum by car.\n\nThe catholic provost church “St Peter and Paul” dates from the 11th century. It is the oldest, and until 1655, the only church in Bochum. In 1547, it was rebuilt as a Gothic single-nave church. The defensive tower has become Bochum’s trademark. It is about a 25-minute walk here from the H+ Hotel Bochum, or five minutes by car."
