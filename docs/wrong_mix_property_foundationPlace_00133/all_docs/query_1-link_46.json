        "text": "H5N1 Bird Flu Circulating in Dairy Cows Across the U.S.\n\nThe clade of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses causing outbreaks in wild and domestic birds around the world, is now appearing in dairy farms across several U.S. states. These viruses recently caused morbidity and mortality in over 60 mammalian species, mostly carnivores, after consuming infected carcasses. Although cows were until recently not considered to be at risk of infection, the current outbreak demonstrates influenza remains unpredictable.\n\nThe route of exposure of these dairy cows and the mode of virus transmission are still unknown. The virus RNA was found at high concentrations in raw milk. Several animal species at dairy farms and three farm worker were also affected. Initial data released by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service on GISAID show that the viruses in these dairy cows, other animals and several farm workers are closely related.\n\nFull details\n\n16,7 million hCoV-19 sequences shared: Where do surveillance efforts stand?\n\nAfter mixed efforts in 2020, followed by a massive explosion of Omicron data generated by late 2021 from 215 countries and territories, the number of unique submitting countries, and hence, representativeness of global surveillance, today remains at early 2021 levels, and well above 2020 levels.\n\nWhile the US, UK, and Germany contributed an outsized share in 2022, it is worth pointing out that increasing representation of diverse regions over time, and the timeliness of submissions are far more critical to ensure new variants are detected in real-time. The recent timely discovery of BA.2.86 and EG.5.1 are examples of continued effectiveness so far.\n\nH5N1 continues to impact global bird populations\n\nA clade of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, originating from poultry but subsequently identified in migratory birds, is severely impacting wild bird populations, including endangered bird species. Over 100 million birds have been killed across the globe, making this the largest outbreak in poultry in history. The current H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is also affecting South America where several countries have recorded their first ever cases.\n\nEvents with mammal-to-mammal transmission have been reported, including in farmed mink and in marine mammals. Although HPAI H5N1 can cause serious disease in humans, no known human-to-human spread has been identified. GISAID is closely working with its partners to help facilitate the timely sharing of the latest genomic data.\n\n> for more, see statements by WHO Global Influenza Programme and WOAH\n\nGISAID joins the G20 Joint Finance & Health Ministerial Meeting\n\nYogyakarta, 20-21 June. Under the motto ‘Strengthening Global Health Architecture’ a delegation from GISAID attended the G20 Finance and Health Ministers meeting hosted by Indonesia, to discuss with G20 Member States’ and its partners their vision for GISAID+ (GISAID plus).\n\nGlobal leaders reflected on the need to coordinate and strengthen resources during future pandemics. In particular Member States stressed the essential role GISAID plays in global health security, and discussed how global leaders could support GISAID’s expansion as a global resource to respond to other priority pathogens with major impact and pandemic-potential.\n\n> read more\n\nCBD Study finds 'GISAID might provide useful lessons and insight to ABS discussions'\n\nA peer-reviewed fact-finding and scoping study on digital sequence information on genetic resources in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol, highlights key advantages of GISAID’s sharing mechanism and a fair and equitable benefit-sharing resulting from access to data.\n\nWith the core principals of timely international sharing of health data for protecting populations against lethal infectious disease outbreaks and adherence to scientific etiquette of acknowledgement of the source of data has resulted in global trust and confidence in GISAID.\n\n> download the fact-finding & scoping study"
