        "text": "Abstract\n\nPrivacy dashboards and transparency tools help users review and manage the data collected about them online. Since 2016, Google has offered such a tool, My Activity, which allows users to review and delete their activity data from Google services. We conducted an online survey with n=153 participants to understand if Google's My Activity, as an example of a privacy transparency tool, increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. While most participants were aware of Google's data collection, the volume and detail was surprising, but after exposure to My Activity, participants were significantly more likely to be both less concerned about data collection and to view data collection more beneficially. Only 25% indicated that they would change any settings in the My Activity service or change any behaviors. This suggests that privacy transparency tools are quite beneficial for online services as they garner trust with their users and improve their perceptions without necessarily changing users' behaviors. At the same time, though, it remains unclear if such transparency tools actually improve end user privacy by sufficiently assisting or motivating users to change or review data collection settings.\n\nStudy Data\n\nFull data set of the participant's responds obtained from the online survey with 153 participants. The data set is in a comma-seperated values format (CSV). One participant's record per row; columns represent questions, execept from questions with multiple selections or repeated questions (these are represented by multiple columns). Questions are named as in the questionnaire presented in the appendix in the paper.\n\nDownload Data Set (.csv)\n\nR Scripts\n\nExcerpt of the R scripts that were used to generate the plots of the paper and to perform the regression analyses. The scripts are written in R and combined into one file written in R Markdown language.\n\nDownload R Scripts (.rmd)"
