Between 1986 and 1995, 429 hydrofracturing tests have been carried out in six now-abandoned coal mines and two coal bed methane boreholes at depths between 600 and 1950âm within the greater Ruhr region in western Germany. From these tests, stress magnitudes and orientations of the stress tensor are derived. The majority of hydrofracturing tests were carried out from mine galleries away from mine workings in a relatively undisturbed rock mass. These data along with detailed information have been disclosed recently. In combination with already published material, we provide the first comprehensive stress database of the greater Ruhr region. Our study summarises the results of the extensive in situ stress test campaign and assigns quality to each data record using the established quality ranking schemes of the World Stress Map project. The stress magnitudes suggest predominantly strike-slip stress regime, where the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress, Shmin, is half of the magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress, SHmax, implying that the horizontal differential stress is high. We observe no particular change in the stress gradient at depth throughout the Carboniferous layers and no significant difference between tests carried out in coal mines and deep boreholes. The mean SHmax orientation varies between 133âÂ±â13â in the westernmost located Friedrich Heinrich coal mine and 168âÂ±â23â in the easternmost located Westphalia coal mine. The mean SHmax orientation, based on 87 data records from this and already published studies, of 161âÂ±â43â is in good agreement with the regional stress orientation observed in northwestern Europe.

For an application example of this database, we estimate slip and dilation tendencies of major geological discontinuities, discovered during the 700-year-long coal mining activities in the region. The result, although burdened by high uncertainties, shows that the discontinuities striking in the NâS and NWâSE directions have a higher slip tendency compared to the ones striking ENEâWSW and NNWâSSE, whereas a high dilation tendency is observed for discontinuities striking NNWâSSE and a low dilation tendency for the ones striking ENEâWSW.

The stress state determines, among others, permeability anisotropy, extent and orientation of fractures created during hydraulic fracturing operations, slip, dilation, and stability of geological discontinuities, be it either natural fracture networks or major fault zones. To describe the 3D stress state, forward geomechanical models are used and calibrated with stress magnitude data records within the model volume (e.g.Â Reiter and Heidbach,Â 2014; Hergert etÂ al.,Â 2015). For the latter, not only are the number of data records important, but also their quality, which can be used as weights during model calibration (e.g.Â Lecampion and Lei,Â 2010; Ziegler and Heidbach,Â 2020). For the greater Ruhr region located in western Germany (Fig.Â 1a), mainly due to confidentiality reasons, a comprehensive and public compilation of in situ stress data was missing. As of the recent change of subsurface data regulations in Germany, these data have now become accessible. Furthermore, an assignment of qualities to the individual data records has only been done for some of the data records that show the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, SHmax (Reiter etÂ al.,Â 2015), using the quality ranking scheme of the World Stress Map (WSM) project (Heidbach etÂ al.,Â 2016). Only recently, Morawietz etÂ al. (2020) presented a quality ranking scheme for stress magnitude data developed for the first German stress magnitude database. However, in their compilation, stress magnitude data for the greater Ruhr region are missing (Fig.Â 1a).\n\nThe application of established quality ranking schemes is not only important for the model calibration, but also guarantees the comparability of stress data records that result from a wide range of different stress indicators, measurements, and indirect stress information (Amadei and Stephansson,Â 1997; Ljunggren etÂ al.,Â 2003; Schmitt etÂ al.,Â 2012).\n\nThis study presents the first comprehensive public database of stress orientation and stress magnitude data records for the greater Ruhr region, including the application of established quality ranking schemes from the WSM project for the assignment of qualities for each data record. Throughout the years, few publications have already published subsets of our compilation (i.e.Â KÃ¼ck,Â 1988; MÃ¼ller,Â 1989, 1991; Stelling and Rummel,Â 1992; Rummel and Weber,Â 1993; Kruszewski etÂ al.,Â 2021b, 2022d); however, without making critical information (i.e. test location, depth, testing method, or uncertainty) available. A lack of such information made utilisation of these data (e.g. for the calibration of geomechanical models) impossible and qualities, in most cases, could not be reliably estimated.\n\nWe now have access to internal reports that were recently disclosed by the Deutsche Montan Technologie GmbH (DMT) and ConocoPhillips (MeSy, 1994, 1995a, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, b, c, and d, and 1996a, b, and c). These reports contain essential and detailed information from 429 hydrofracturing tests, that were performed between 1986 and 1995, in 43 vertical and horizontal boreholes in the greater Ruhr region. This in situ measurement campaign spanned over an east-west range of around 100âkm, a north-south range of approximately 55âkm, and a depth range of 1.35âkm (i.e. between 600 and 1950âm depth) (Fig.Â 1b). Hydrofracturing tests were carried out in (i)Â mine galleries of six now-abandoned coal mines, located far away from mine workings in relatively undisturbed rock mass, using short, both vertical and horizontal, exploration boreholes, and in (ii)Â two deep vertical exploration coal bed methane (CBM) boreholes located to the north of the coal mines in the MÃ¼nster region.\n\nFrom the collected data, we derive data records of the magnitudes of the minimum, Shmin, and the maximum, SHmax, horizontal stresses. Additionally, for each borehole, the SHmax orientation was derived based on the orientations of the fractures induced during the hydrofracturing test. The majority of compiled data is presented for the first time to the wider scientific community with full open access. To our knowledge, we present all performed in situ stress tests in the greater Ruhr region along with a detailed description of testing and stress estimation methodology as well as an assignment of data quality using the WSM quality ranking schemes (Heidbach etÂ al.,Â 2016; Morawietz etÂ al.,Â 2020). Additionally, we provide all needed information for utilisation of such data in numerical modelling studies for planning future subsurface activities within the greater Ruhr region and for an evaluation of the state of stress of the Carboniferous layers and its vertical and spatial variability.\n\nThis study is split into eight main parts presenting the following: (i)Â an overview of the geological setting of the greater Ruhr region, (ii)Â theoretical background on the stress tensor, (iii)Â a description of each test location, (iv)Â a description of the hydrofracturing procedures and testing tools, (v)Â methodology for interpretation and evaluation of the principal stresses based on results from hydrofracturing tests, (vi)Â results with a quality assignment, (vii)Â discussion where few ways of utilising the database including slip and dilation tendency analysis of major geological discontinuities in the study region were presented, and (viii)Â conclusions.\n\nThe greater Ruhr region, located east of the WalesâBrabant Massif, is part of an external autochthonous fold and thrust belt of the latest stage of the Variscan orogeny and its Rhenohercynian and Subvariscan zones (Brix etÂ al.,Â 1988; Drozdzewski etÂ al.,Â 2009). The Variscan orogeny developed throughout the Late Paleozoic convergence of Gondwanaland and Euramerican continental masses, where the convergence and collision occurred during the Carboniferous and Devonian geological periods (Ziegler,Â 1990). The Variscan Deformation Front (VDF) is terminated in the north-east by the Osning fault zone (bordering the Lower Saxony Basin) with an offset of approximately 100âkm (Drozdzewski etÂ al.,Â 2009). Significant tectonic activity in the region followed during the Late Triassic. Furthermore, the Ruhr region was affected by the Late Cretaceous transpression and Tertiary extension (Drozdzewski,Â 1993). The greater Ruhr region constitutes the western part of the Eurasian Plate with its present-day state of stress being a result of a combination of the ridge push from the central and northern segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge as well as a northwards directed push of the African continent with respect to Europe (i.e. Alpine collision zone) (GrÃ¼nthal and Stromeyer,Â 1994). The studied region is located between the three natural regions of Germany, i.e. Westphalian Lowlands (being part of the North German Plain), composed of rocks of the Late Cretaceous and Quaternary geological periods, in the north; the Rhenish Massif, made up mainly from Paleozoic era rocks, in the south; and the Lower Rhine Plain, consisting mainly of Tertiary-age rocks, to the west (Fig.Â 1b).\n\nThe rock strata of the greater Ruhr region is under the influence of two major fault network systems (Fig.Â 1b) which both formed by the Variscan orogeny and its main NWâSE shortening direction. The first system is represented by the NEâSW oriented thrusts with steeply inclined to bed-parallel dip angles reaching lengths of 40âkm. These thrust faults have a horizontal displacement of tens to hundreds of meters with some reaching up to â¼â2.5âkm. Thrusts are dissected by a network of NWâSE striking normal faults, which results in a horst and graben structure of the region. Few strike-slip faults with varying orientations have also been seen in the region (Brix etÂ al.,Â 1988; Drozdzewski,Â 1988). The folds observed in the Ruhr region, oriented NEâSW, vary significantly in shape and dimension and have wavelengths of up to 10âkm, increasing towards the north, and amplitudes of several hundred meters.\n\nAcross the greater Ruhr region, 700-year-long coal mining activities exposed molasse-type clastic sediments of the Upper Carboniferous period, including shales, silt- to coarse-grained sandstones, and coal seams of varied strength, all heavily deformed by folding and thrusting (Bachmann etÂ al.,Â 1971). North of the Ruhr region, Cretaceous strata, in places up to 1.8âkm deep (Hesemann,Â 1965), overlay the Carboniferous layers (Drozdzewski,Â 1993). Four deep exploratory boreholes (i.e. MÃ¼nsterland 1 (Hesemann,Â 1965), Vingerhoets 93 (Eder etÂ al.,Â 1983), Versold 1, and Isselburg 3 (Drozdzewski,Â 1993)), located north of the Ruhr region, have all reached Devonian strata. The carbonate layers of the Middle and Upper Devonian period, which are part of the Devonian Reef Complex, outcrop south of the Ruhr region close to the city of Iserlohn (Fig.Â 1c). As of today, there is however no direct proof of Devonian carbonates underlying the coal-bearing Carboniferous strata below the Ruhr region. Nevertheless, the DEKORP 2N seismic line interpretations (DEKORP,Â 1990) indicate strong reflections, corresponding to a high material contrast at around 5âkm depth, which is thought to be the depth of Devonian platform carbonates, encountered in deep boreholes north of the region (Drozdzewski,Â 1988; Franke etÂ al.,Â 1990; Drozdzewski,Â 1993). Devonian carbonates below the Ruhr region have been considered as potential geothermal reservoirs (Balcewicz etÂ al.,Â 2021; Kruszewski etÂ al.,Â 2021b).\n\nGiven the large lateral variability of stiffness and density as shown in the geological cross-section in Fig.Â 1c, one of the key questions is if this also has an impact on the geomechanical stratification. Lateral density, strength, and stiffness contrasts have been proposed to cause changes in the stress field (Tingay etÂ al.,Â 2006; Rajabi etÂ al.,Â 2016); however, this has not been proven in general and not in particular for the Ruhr region. The unique data set that we investigate in the following study allows this question to be addressed.\n\nThe test locations where the hydrofracturing tests were carried out ranged from the city of Hoetmar in the MÃ¼nster region within the Westphalian Lowlands to the east, and mine Friedrich Heinrich in the vicinity of Kamp-Lintfort in the eastern part of the Lower Rhine Plain to the west. The detailed locations of the hydrofracturing tests as well as coal mines, active around the time of the tests, are presented in Fig.Â 1b. Below, a brief description of each test location and penetrated lithology is presented. The depth of measurements indicated throughout the paper are expressed using the actual depth below the surface and not the NHN values, with the latter being common for the German mining industry.\n\n4.1âKamp-Lintfort (Friedrich Heinrich mine)\n\nThirty hydrofracturing tests on the premises of the Friedrich Heinrich mine in the city of Kamp-Lintfort were carried out at a depth of 586âm, around 1000âm south-west from the shaft IV, in two boreholes. The first borehole is vertical with a length of 40âm drilled in compact claystoneâsiltstone series. The second is a 37âm long horizontal borehole drilled towards the NW direction in compact claystoneâsiltstone series. The tests were located in Middle Witten formations within the Westphalian A stage of the Carboniferous period.\n\n4.2âNeukirchen-Vluyn (Niederberg mine)\n\nOn the premises of the Niederberg mine in the city of Neukirchen-Vluyn, 27 hydrofracturing tests were carried out at a depth of 630âm in three boreholes from which two were horizontal and one vertical. The horizontal wells were drilled with azimuths of 120 and 97ââN in both sandstones and slates, whereas the vertical borehole penetrated mainly sandstones.\n\n4.3âDinslaken (Lohberg mine)\n\nOn the premises of the Lohberg coal mine in the vicinity of the city of Dinslaken, 84 hydrofracturing tests were performed in 10 boreholes. Four test locations were located on the fifth level (i.e. at a depth of 1315âm), near shaft II, with a maximum horizontal distance between test locations of around 2500âm. All test locations except one were located south of the Bruckhauser fault. Drilled boreholes had a length between approximately 33 and 60âm and penetrated either compact sandstone or claystone series with interlayering coal series. The horizontal boreholes were drilled in both NE and E directions. All boreholes were drilled in Upper Bochum formations within the Westphalian A stage of the Carboniferous period.\n\n4.4âRecklinghausen (General Blumenthal mine)\n\nIn three boreholes in the General Blumenthal coal mine in the vicinity of the city of Recklinghausen, 34 hydrofracturing tests were carried out. The drilling operations took place on the ninth level of the coal mine at depth of 975âm directly below the Dickebank coal seam. The horizontal boreholes were drilled along both NW and NNE directions. All boreholes, each 40âm length, were drilled in the sandstone series of the Upper Bochum formations of the Westphalian A stage of the Carboniferous period.\n\n4.5âBergkamen (Haus Aden mine)\n\nSeventy-six hydrofracturing tests were performed at two depths levels, i.e. 750 and 998âm in 10 boreholes within the Haus Aden coal mine in the vicinity of the city of Bergkamen. The boreholes drilled at 750âm depth, two of which were vertical and two horizontal, had a length of 38 to 42âm and penetrated mainly compact medium-to-fine grained sandstones, claystones, and few coal seams. The horizontal boreholes at those depths were drilled in the NE directions. At a depth level of 998âm, six boreholes (two of which were horizontal and drilled in the NE direction) with lengths ranging between 40 and 76âm were drilled. Tests at depth of 998âm were carried out in the Middle Bochum formations, whereas tests at depth of 750âm were carried out within the Upper Bochum formations. The formations penetrated by the boreholes in the Haus Aden mine belong to the Westphalian A stage of the Carboniferous period.\n\n4.6âHamm (Westphalia mine)\n\nIn the Westphalia coal mine in the vicinity of the city of Hamm (Westph.), 149 hydrofracturing tests were carried out in 13 boreholes at two depths levels, i.e. 1030 and 1250âm, where the maximum horizontal distance between tests amounted to approximately 2100âm. At depth of 1300âm, four boreholes, two of which were horizontal (drilled in both NE and NW directions), with a length between 40 and 50âm were drilled. The penetrated formations included mainly compact or fractured sandstone and, occasionally, coal layers. At depth of 1250âm, nine boreholes with lengths between 39 and 43âm were drilled into compact sandstone layers and some coal layers. All tests were carried out in the Middle Bochum formations of the Westphalian A stage of the Carboniferous period.\n\n4.7âMÃ¼nster area (Hoetmar and Drensteinfurt)\n\nAs a part of a coal bed methane exploration program, two deep vertical boreholes (i.e. Natrap-1 and Rieth-1) were drilled around 20âkm south from the city of MÃ¼nster, north of the Ruhr region. In both boreholes, located approximately 17âkm away from each other, hydrofracturing and permeability tests were carried out in cased and open hole borehole sections. In the Natrap-1 well, located approximately 1.5âkm north of the city of Hoetmar, cased hole tests were carried out in three perforated sections between 1380 and 1949âm depth, within eleven coal seams, and open hole tests between 1418 and 1935âm depth. In total, 17 hydrofracturing tests were carried out in both Westphalian A and B stages of the Carboniferous geological period in the Natrap-1 borehole. In the Rieth-1 borehole, located around 4âkm south-west of the city of Drensteinfurt, hydrofracturing tests were carried out in 10 perforated cased borehole sections at depths between 1082 and 1582âm and open borehole sections between depths of 1694 and 1705âm. In total, 12 hydrofracturing tests were performed in coal seams and coal-bearing formations in the Westphalian A stage of the Carboniferous geological in the Natrap-1 borehole. An estimation of hydrofracturing tensile strength and fracture breakdown pressure was only possible for open hole tests, whereas no tests of the orientation of SHmax were carried out in the deep boreholes, primarily due to the difficulty of estimating fracture orientation in perforated borehole sections.\n\nAll hydrofracturing tests were carried out by the former MeSy GmbH (now Solexperts GmbH) and their proprietary testing equipment designed for deep mines and conditions of high differential pressures ranging between 30 and 40âMPa. The packer system was designed for 48 to 60âmm diameter boreholes. The packer tool was tripped into a vertical borehole on a steel cable together with two hydraulic lines of 6 to 8âmm inside diameter for both packer and zonal pressurisation. The length of each packer element was about 1âm and the interval between packers had a length of around 0.6âm. Pressure data were recorded at the wellhead with a mechanical data acquisition system respecting the safety requirements. A schematic picture of a hydrofracturing test in a vertical and horizontal borehole in a coal mine is presented in Fig.Â 3. In each borehole, of about 40âm in length multiple interval sections were tested beginning from the bottom of the borehole and moving towards the wellhead. The following procedure was conducted at each interval: (i)Â inflation of the packer system at the desired depth; (ii)Â pressurising of the test interval to a small differential pressure to ensure that the selected location is suited for hydrofracturing test (i.e. proving that no significant open fractures exist at the depth of interest); (iii)Â pressurising the interval until formation breakdown (i.e. fracture initiation) with a pumping rate of a few Lâminâ1, termination of fluid injection, and system shut-in; (iv)Â several repressurisations of the test interval until constant injection pressure is reached (so-called refrac test), termination of injection and shut-in to determine refrac (or reopening) and instantaneous shut-in pressures; and (v)Â deflating the packer system and moving to another test section. A schematic example of a hydrofracturing test from one of the coal mines in the Ruhr region with its characteristic phases is presented in Fig.Â 4a. After all hydrofracturing tests were carried out in a given borehole, in most cases, the double packer tool was replaced with the impression packer tool consisting of a single packer element with a soft rubber membrane and a magnetic single shot for a test of the fracture orientation. In deep boreholes, in both cased and open hole borehole sections, similar procedures to the ones in coal mines, as described above, were utilised with few improvements including, among others, utilising an additional computer-based digital data acquisition system rather than a mechanical pressure recording device.\n\n6.1âCoal mines\n\nTo interpret stress magnitudes based on the pressure curves recorded during hydrofracturing tests conducted in anisotropic and fractured Carboniferous rock mass (Fig.Â 4), inversion techniques following the classical hydraulic fracturing theory (Hubbert and Willis,Â 1957; Amadei and Stephansson,Â 1997; Haimson and Cornet,Â 2003; Schmitt etÂ al.,Â 2012) were applied. For its application, it has been assumed that (i)Â a borehole is aligned with a principal stress axis. Such an assumption will be valid mainly for vertical boreholes, located away from mine workings or in deep boreholes; (ii)Â rock mass is homogeneous and isotropic. Neglecting coal seams, the compact sandstone and siltstone layers fulfill this assumption, i.e. fracture propagation remains not affected by the properties of the rock mass; (iii)Â fracturing fluid does not penetrate the rock prior to the fracture initiation. As the permeability of the rock mass of the Carboniferous rocks is extremely low, this assumption remains valid; (iv)Â once the fracture is initiated, it propagates in the direction perpendicular to the orientation of the Shmin. As this assumption remains true for vertical boreholes, it may not be true for the horizontal boreholes in cases when a borehole is not aligned with a principal stress axis. In few cases, drilling direction of horizontal boreholes was selected based on results from a vertical borehole accounting for mine geometry restrictions. For other cases, the orientation of horizontal principal stresses was unknown prior to testing and drilling direction was limited by the mine geometry. In a case of a borehole not being aligned with a principal stress axis, fracture orientation was excluded from the further analysis.\n\nA schematic example of a hydrofracturing test from one of the coal mines in the Ruhr region with estimates of the shut-in pressure during fracture closure, Psi, fracture reopening pressure, Pr, the rock mass (hydrofracturing) tensile strength, Pco, and the breakdown pressure at fracture initiation, Pc, is presented in Fig.Â 4a. Assuming negligible pore pressure, P0, in impermeable and compact Carboniferous rock mass within the Ruhr region, for a case of vertical boreholes, where a vertical fracture was induced, Shmin is assumed to be equal to Psi:\n\n(1) S hmin = P si .\n\nFor the case of vertical boreholes and vertical fracture, SHmax was computed as follows:\n\n(2) S Hmax = 3 S hmin - P r - P 0 .\n\nUtilising the bulk density, Ïb, of the rock mass of 2500âkgâmâ3, based on Ïb of the Ruhr sandstone (Brenne,Â 2016; Duda and Renner,Â 2012), and the true vertical depth (TVD) of a test location, z, Sv was computed using the following:\n\n(3) S v = â« 0 z Ï b ( z ) g d z .\n\nAlthough Ïb of the Carboniferous rocks in the greater Ruhr region could be lower (in the case of coal seams) or higher (in the case of siltstones or shales) than 2500âkgâmâ3, this Ïb value is considered as a good first-order average approximation for the study region.\n\nIn a case of a horizontal borehole aligned with SHmax orientation and a vertical fracture induced, estimation of Shmin was calculated according to Eq.Â (1). If a horizontal borehole was drilled along the SHmax orientation, instead of estimating SHmax magnitude as in the case of a vertical well, Sv magnitude was estimated instead,\n\n(4) S v = 3 S hmin - P r - P 0 .\n\nFor the case of horizontal boreholes aligned with Shmin orientation and a radial fracture, Shmin estimation follows Eq.Â (1). The same goes for the estimation of Shmin from horizontal boreholes aligned with Shmin orientation and a vertical fracture. Additionally, in this particular case, Sv was calculated with Eq.Â (4). For a case of horizontal boreholes aligned with Shmin orientation and a horizontal fracture, Sv was assumed to be equal to Psi,\n\n(5) S v = P si ,\n\nwhereas SHmax, for this particular case, was computed as follows:\n\n(6) S Hmax = 3 S v - P r - P 0 .\n\nThe results from vertical boreholes can be considered to yield better quality than horizontal boreholes, due to the uncertainty connected to their alignment with a principal stressÂ axis.\n\n6.2âDeep boreholes\n\nIn deep boreholes, the shut-in pressure was determined using a three-step analysis of the pressure plots which included: (i)Â pressure vs. flow rate plot, where the moment at which flow is stopped was used to estimate an upper bound on Psi; (ii)Â the so-called Muskat pressure plot (Muskat,Â 1937) for estimating the lower bound on Psi, assuming that the linear part of the plot characterises radial flow (i.e. stimulated fracture is closed); and (iii)Â within the two limits, Psi value marks the transition from a rapid linear pressure drop to a diffusion dominated pressure decrease, where the transition can be determined by a tangent (i.e. inflection point) method (Fig.Â 4b). In some hydrofracturing tests, determination of Psi could be only carried out through pressure versus flow rate plots. Considering the system stiffness, Pr was constrained based on the deviation of the linear pressure versus injected volume plot (Fig.Â 4c) which indicates fracture opening. Pc was determined as the maximum pressure registered during the fracture initiation phase of a hydrofracturing test (Fig.Â 4d). As the analysed deep boreholes were drilled vertically, Eqs.Â (1) and (2) were used to estimate Shmin and SHmax, respectively. EquationÂ (3) and an assumption of Ïb of the rock mass of 2500âkgâmâ3 was used to estimate Sv from the two deep boreholes.\n\n7.1âFracture initiation, refracturing, and shut-in pressure\n\nThe detailed results of Psi, Pr, Pc, and Pco averaged within each borehole and their uncertainties are presented in TableÂ 1. Both Psi and Pr show relatively small uncertainties amounting to values between 2 and 4âMPa and present no significant variations, except increasing magnitudes with depth. Characteristic pressure peaks for fracture reopening pressure during subsequent slow pumping rates were observed. Pressures only slightly decreased during shut in, which is an indication of extremely low rock permeability. Pc, on the other hand, shows significant variations due to local rock strength variations and relatively high uncertainties of about 5âMPa on average. Pc values are high, approaching, at times, technical limits of the testing tool. The tensile strength of the rock mass, computed from the in situ stress tests, can be considered as high, with an average tensile strength of 6.5âMPa for the study region. An increasing trend of Pco with depth was observed.\n\n7.2âIn situ stress magnitudes and quality assignment\n\nThe results of the determined in situ stress magnitudes are presented in TableÂ 2. Based on the collected data, it can be observed that Shmin is significantly lower than the vertical stress (with an average ratio of 0.6), whereas SHmax is on average around 1.9 times higher than the Shmin, proving high differential horizontal stresses at depth in the studied area. The vertical stress derived from the horizontal boreholes agrees with the vertical stress computed for the overburden bulk density of 2500âkgâmâ3, with a few tests slightly exceeding this value. The SHmax magnitude is higher than the vertical stress with an average ratio of 1.2. However, there is an always-present uncertainty related especially to the estimation of SHmax based on the classical hydraulic fracturing approach used in this study, values of SHmax from both coal mines and deep boreholes are comparable, and therefore should be treated as reliable. Generally, the studied region represents strike-slip stress regime, where Shmin<Sv<SHmax (Fig.Â 5a). Based on the average stress values from each test location presented in TableÂ 3, gradients of Shmin, SHmax, and Sv valid for depths between 0.6 and 1.7âkm with their coefficient of determination, R2, are as follows:\n\n(7)Shmin=0.0134z+1.2893;(R2=0.74),(8)SHmax=0.0248z+3.9588;(R2=0.52),(9)Sv=0.0234z+1.2675;(R2=0.92).\n\nDownload\n\nIt can be observed that at depths between 1000 and 1300âm, the horizontal stresses especially are slightly lower than for tests carried out at shallower or greater depths, pointing towards a more extensional stress regime. Based on Fig.Â 6, which presents a normalised stress polygon with averaged results from each location (differentiating depth levels) computed within this study (TableÂ 3), and assuming negligible pore pressure, one can see that the majority of stress tests fall predominantly into a strike-slip stress regime and only a few present normal stress regime. Looking at Fig.Â 5b, which presents a so-called mean stress ratio, k (i.e. a ratio of average horizontal stress, Sh, and Sv), it could be concluded that stress does not change significantly at depth and that an average k value of 0.86 represents the studied area most accurately. For comparison, stress ratio computed based on the approach by Sheorey (1994) for Young modulus, Esh, of 36âÂ±â11âGPa, which was based on 29 static measurements on fine-grained sandstone core samples extracted from the H13 borehole from the Westphalia coal mine at 1250âm depth (MeSy,Â 1994), is presented in Fig.Â 5b.\n\nAfter data evaluation, the quality ranking scheme developed by Morawietz etÂ al. (2020) was applied for the derived Shmin magnitudes. The test results collected within this study and ones from already published studies are summarised in TableÂ 4. In total, 429 hydrofracturing tests were carried out during the measurement campaign. Based on these tests, 429 unique Shmin data records were derived, from which 367 received the highest, i.e. A-quality, 19 data records received C-quality (due to the tests being carried out in cased borehole sections), and 43 data records where it was not possible to derive the Shmin magnitude received E-quality (due to either no pressure build-up in the tested interval or an estimation of Sv magnitude, instead of Shmin, in the case of several horizontal boreholes).\n\nFurthermore, based on 429 hydrofracturing tests, 188 data records of SHmax magnitudes and 341 data records of Sv magnitudes were derived. The magnitudes of Sv are a combination of stress magnitude values derived from hydrofracturing tests for horizontal boreholes and estimations of Sv magnitudes based on the bulk density of the rock mass of 2500âkgâmâ3 (Duda and Renner,Â 2012; Brenne,Â 2016) for vertical boreholes (TableÂ 2). The stress data record quality assessment developed by Morawietz etÂ al. (2020), as of today, refers to Shmin magnitudes only, and therefore no quality was assigned to SHmax or Sv magnitudes.\n\n7.3âSHmax orientations and quality assignment\n\nFollowing the WSM data assessment guidelines and the WSM quality ranking scheme (Heidbach etÂ al.,Â 2016), an estimation of the mean orientation of the induced fractures, assumed to be equal to the mean SHmax orientation, was carried out in each borehole. For the estimation of the mean SHmax orientation and its standard deviation from each borehole needed for the quality assignment (Heidbach etÂ al.,Â 2016), the statistics of bi-modal data (Mardia,Â 1975) were utilised.\n\nFrom 429 hydrofracturing tests, in 254 cases the orientation of the induced fractures was measured. From this data set, 38 SHmax orientation data records were derived. These acquired SHmax orientations increase the number of data records in the greater Ruhr region from 49, which are already available in the WSM database release from 2016 (Heidbach etÂ al.,Â 2018), to 87. In some hydrofracturing tests, several fractures were observed at the same test location. Once these fracture orientations differed from each other by more than 25â, the data record was not taken into account for further analysis. This procedure was performed to exclude data records with high uncertainties of fracture orientations being an actual indicator of the SHmax orientation. The resulting SHmax orientation, including its standard deviation using the statistic of bi-modal data, is provided in the second last column of TableÂ 2. FigureÂ 7a shows the final stress map of the greater Ruhr region with the distribution of SHmax orientations, whereas Fig.Â 7b and c present rose plots of SHmax orientations from this and already published studies. Since the boreholes in the six investigated coal mines areas are close to each other, derived SHmax orientations are represented with six polar plots presenting mean values (solid black line) and its standard deviation (dashed black line) from eachÂ mine.\n\nAs presented in TableÂ 2, the uncertainty of six SHmax orientations is considered as high, as it is either equal to or higher than 40â. These data records were assigned the lowest i.e. E-quality according to the quality assessment by Heidbach etÂ al. (2016). Due to the short length of the tested intervals (i.e. less than 40âm), the rest of 32 SHmax orientation data records from hydrofracturing tests were deemed to be of D-quality according to the WSM quality assessment (Heidbach etÂ al.,Â 2016).\n\nWithin this study, we present for the first time a comprehensive assessment of 429 hydrofracturing tests that were carried out in 43 vertical and horizontal boreholes located across the greater Ruhr region recorded between 1986 and 1995. The database presented here is the world's largest public database of stress magnitudes from a single region. Based on the analysis carried out in this study, we could derive 429 data records of Shmin magnitude with assigned qualities. This database nearly doubles the number of stress magnitudes currently available for Germany and its adjacent regions from 568 to 997 unique Shmin values. Additionally, based on 254 single measurements of the orientation of the induced fractures in exploration boreholes, we derived 38 new data records of the SHmax orientation, simultaneously nearly doubling the amount of already available stress orientation data records from 49 to 87 for the greater Ruhr region. We conclude from the principal stress magnitudes that the stress regime is predominantly strike-slip, where SHmax is approximately double the size of Shmin, implying high differential horizontal stresses in the subsurface. We also conclude no substantial spatial or vertical change of stress state or stress decoupling within the Carboniferous layers of the greater Ruhr region, implying a relatively homogeneous stress field. No significant difference between the results of tests carried out in coal mines and deep boreholes were observed, proving the small influence of the mine infrastructure on the test result (at least not in the areas where tests were carried out). The average SHmax orientation of the region amounts to 161âÂ±â43â. The high standard deviation of the SHmax orientation is caused not only by high uncertainties of the individual SHmax orientation data records, but also by local variability and a potential anticlockwise rotation of the SHmax orientation from E to W. Nevertheless, the mean SHmax orientation is overall in good agreement with the NWâSE SHmax orientation of northwestern Europe. Utilising results from this study, slip and dilation tendencies of major geological discontinuities within the Ruhr region were calculated. Considering average values of the in situ stress tensor of the greater Ruhr region and simplified fault geometries, the NâS and NWâSE-striking structures prove to be the most likely to be reactivated during, e.g. fluid injection, whereas the NNWâSSE-striking discontinuities are the most permeable structures and may be considered as potential exploration targets for geothermal energy provision. The database created within this study presents unique and high-quality stress input data for future reservoir and geomechanical numerical models and should aid the subsurface operations in the region. This study could also serve as a template for other national (and international) stress magnitude compilations.\n\nAmadei, B. and Stephansson, O.: Rock stress and its measurement, Chapman & Hall, 490 pp., https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-5346-1, 1997.âa, b\n\nBachmann, M., Michelau, P., and Rabitz, A.: Das Rhein-Ruhr-Revier Stratigraphie, Fortschr.
