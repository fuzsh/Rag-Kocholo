That means, by-and-large, ggplot2 itself changes relatively little. When we do make changes, they will be generally to add new functions or arguments rather than changing the behaviour of existing functions, and if we do make changes to existing behaviour we will do them for compelling reasons.\n\nIf you are looking for innovation, look to ggplot2’s rich ecosystem of extensions. See a community maintained list at https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/.\n\nLearning ggplot2\n\nIf you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic introduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual documentation pages. Currently, there are three good places to start:\n\nThe Data Visualization and Communication chapters in R for Data Science. R for Data Science is designed to give you a comprehensive introduction to the tidyverse, and these two chapters will get you up to speed with the essentials of ggplot2 as quickly as possible.\n\nIf you’d like to take an online course, try Data Visualization in R With ggplot2 by Kara Woo.\n\nIf you’d like to follow a webinar, try Plotting Anything with ggplot2 by Thomas Lin Pedersen.\n\nIf you want to dive into making common graphics as quickly as possible, I recommend The R Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang. It provides a set of recipes to solve common graphics problems.\n\nIf you’ve mastered the basics and want to learn more, read ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. It describes the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2 and shows you how all the pieces fit together. This book helps you understand the theory that underpins ggplot2, and will help you create new types of graphics specifically tailored to your needs."
