        "text": "With slightly more than 7,500 students, Bochum University of Applied Sciences is comfortably sized, offering a much more personal atmosphere than the larger universities in the surrounding area. In its original campus in Bochum itself and the new one at Velbert/Heiligenhaus, the university pursues an innovative path in teaching and research. Six departments cover the main focal areas of Construction(architecture, civil engineering, geodesy), Engineering (electrical engineering, informatics, mechatronics and mechanical engineering), and Business. With a good 50 bachelor's courses, the goal is to equip students with the knowledge and skills that will allow them to transition seamlessly into their careers. Part-time study courses stretching over 13 semesters make it possible for people to gain additional qualifications alongside their day jobs. Bochum University of Applied Sciences sees its 15 master's courses not just as opportunities to deepen the academic knowledge gained in bachelor's degrees but as qualifications in fields in which it is especially well versed and where its expertise is sought after.\n\nCollaboration with companies in its home region and beyond is very important to the university, on the teaching as well as the research level. Regular marketplace events offering dissertation or thesis opportunities on engineering or business topics make it possible for companies to research practical issues systematically with a minimum of outlay. More than 150 professors teach and research at Bochum University of Applied Sciences. All of them have spent several years as practitioners in the field, which was a basic precondition for their appointment to the teaching staff.\n\nMaster Program: \"Geothermal Energy Systems\" - completely in English\n\nThe securing of a reliable and sustainable energy supply for the next decades will be in the centre of the endeavours of the future academic generations. To be prepared for the future challenges, creative academics are needed, who think beyond their technical boundaries and develop new approaches towards the energy management issue. The broadly based integration of the geothermal energy utilisation into the future energy mix will be realised by specialists and managers of the building, energy and utility industries as well as by the governmental administrations.\n\nThe master program “Geothermal Energy Systems“ is offered to prospective graduates of the bachelor programs “Civil Engineering”, “Environmental Engineering” or similar programs. It is a specialization in the master program Environmental Engineering (Umweltingenieurwesen).\n\nFor more information regarding the program please contact Mr. Stephan Exner: stephan.exner(at)hs-bochum.de\n\nFor many years, the Architecture department has been placed among the Top 5 in the CHE ranking, primarily due to student ratings: All students are allocated their own workspace. Covering an area of 1,200 square metres, the Blue Box offers around 250 state-of-the-art workplaces with PC and notebook hook-ups. The Civil Engineering department has special strengths in the areas of water management and the environment. This is epitomised in the Hydraulic Engineering laboratory and the International Geothermal Centre, whose varied research and teaching activities (headquarters of the International Geothermal Association, geothermal energy network of the EnergieAgentur.NRW, Bochum Graduate School AGES, etc.) are recognised nationally and internationally as intrinsic to the university's reputation.\n\nThe Geodesy department with its focus on educating for real life practice is unique in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nCore Engineering disciplines at Hochschule Bochum are electrical engineering, informatics, mechatronics and mechanical engineering. And since 1995, the university has offered its courses in these areas as dual study courses with vocational training in a cooperating engineering education programme. At the Velbert/Heiligenhaus campus, this study model is a key feature implemented in close cooperation with local corporations who train apprentices. The successful training of engineers within the region is based on collaboration with the non-profit organisation \"Die Schlüsselregion\" (the Key Region), a network of local companies and institutions."
