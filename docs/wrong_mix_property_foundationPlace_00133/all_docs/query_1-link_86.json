        "text": "Figure 1 shows weekly extra-EU27 imports of natural gas for 2021 and 2022, compared with weekly minimum and maximum import values for the period 2015-2020. By selecting from the dropdown, the figure shows total imports but also imports exclusively from Russia, Norway, Algeria, Azerbaijan pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG, gas transported by ship from around the world), and the net imports from the UK.\n\nThe map (Figure 2) displays the most relevant pipeline import routes into the EU and the location of LNG terminals. The largest share of gas used to be delivered from Russia via four distinct corridors Nord Stream, Yamal (via Poland), Ukraine, and Turkstream (via Turkey). These different Russian gas routes are at the heart of current geopolitical tensions.\n\nFigure 2: Main EU Natural Gas Imports routes covered in our analysis\n\nSource: Bruegel\n\nFigure 3 shows weekly import data via each of these routes, again comparing to the minimum and maximum values from the period 2015-2020.\n\nFigure 4 displays EU27 LNG monthly imports by region of origin since January 2020. While in summer 2021 natural gas imported from Russia via pipeline started to diminish, Russian LNG volumed reaching European LNG terminals have, to date, remained unaffected.\n\nFigure 5 depicts quarterly EU imports of natural gas since Q1 2021, providing an overview of the evolution in volumes from different suppliers over time.\n\nFigure 6 shows the weekly rate of regassification usage in 2022 versus the 2019-2021 average for those EU countries having operative LNG terminals. The rate of regassification capacity use may signal where supply bottlenecks are located.\n\nFigure 7 shows actual daily imports for the last 30 days. Imports are split by Russian routes, as well as shown for Norway, Algeria, Azerbaijan, LNG and the net imports from the UK.\n\nAlongside import volumes, the levels of storage within the EUâ€™s borders are key for providing (or not) reassurance to markets.\n\nIn Figure 8, we provide data on current weekly levels of storage in the EU and in Ukraine.\n\nFigure 9 shows the natural gas gross-exports from EU countries to Ukraine. Flows might increase if the EU traders use more of the Ukrainian gas storage potential.\n\nIn the first tab of Figure 10, we show the current storage level and the relative maximum storage capacity by country. In the second and third tabs it is displayed the change in storage level occurred in the last 30 days."
