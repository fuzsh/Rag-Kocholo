        "text": "About Glossa: a journal of general linguistics\n\nThe journal is dedicated to general linguistics. It publishes contributions from all areas of linguistics, provided they contain theoretical implications that shed light on the nature of language and the language faculty. Contributions should be of interest to all linguists, independently of their own specialisation.\n\nNo specific linguistic theories or trends are given preference. Papers accepted for publication are strictly selected on the basis of scientific quality and scholarly standing.\n\nThis is a fully open access journal with no financial barriers to publishing for authors. Between 2016 and 2020, financial support for the journal was provided by LingOA with grants of NWO and the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU). From 2021 onwards, long-term funding is provided by the Open Library of Humanities (OLH). Authors are only asked to make a Voluntary Author Contribution (VAC) if they have access to institutional funding or grants for this purpose.\n\nSee here for further information."
