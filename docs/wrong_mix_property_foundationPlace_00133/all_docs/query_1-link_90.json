For example, if a page has both the max-snippet:50 and nosnippet tags, the nosnippet tag will apply.\n\nThe default values are index, follow and don't need to be specified. For a full list of values that Google supports, see the list of valid rules.\n\nYou can also specify this information in the header of your pages using the X-Robots-Tag HTTP header rule. This is particularly useful if you wish to limit indexing of non-HTML files like graphics or other kinds of documents. More information about robots meta tags.\n\n<meta name=\"googlebot\" content=\"notranslate\">\n\nWhen Google recognizes that the contents of a page aren't in the language that the user likely wants to read, Google may provide a translated title link and snippet in search results. If the user clicks the translated title link, all further user interaction with the page is through Google Translate, which will automatically translate any links followed. In general, this gives you the chance to provide your unique and compelling content to a much larger group of users. However, there may be situations where this is not desired. This meta tag tells Google that you don't want us to provide a translation for this page.\n\n<meta name=\"google-site-verification\" content=\"...\">\n\nYou can use this tag on the top-level page of your site to verify ownership for Search Console. Note that while the values of the name and content attributes must match exactly what is provided to you (including upper and lower case), it doesn't matter if you change the tag from XHTML to HTML or if the format of the tag matches the format of your page."
