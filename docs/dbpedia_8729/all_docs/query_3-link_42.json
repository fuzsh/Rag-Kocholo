        "text": "Robert L. Pendleton\n\nWhat exists is constantly changing. This fact requires that we take tense seriously.\n\n(Chisholm and Zimmerman, 1997, 262)\n\nChange is obviously real. But just how this real change might be related to a real time continues to puzzle philosophers. In this paper I argue that time, though in one sense unreal, nevertheless supervenes on change, which is real. I thereby support a theory of time that takes as its starting point the brute fact of change noted by Chisholm and Zimmerman.\n\nI am well aware that to \"take tense seriously\" in this way will not be an easy task in the current philosophical dialectic on space and time. The prospects remain uncertain for a metaphysics of time in which changing times or tenses might cohere with real physical changes. The arguments of McTaggart, Smart, Dummett, and Mellor have long since caused most philosophers to abandon the view that time is something that can be said to change. Many seem resigned to this view in the face of arguments by scientist-philosophers that the naive view of the \"progress of time\" is simply inconsistent with the modern physics of \"space-time.\"\n\n1 The resulting \"tenseless\" view of space-time has come to be embraced by philosophers, however reluctantly, as the \"standard\" metaphysics of time.\n\nThe embrace is indeed reluctant in many quarters. There has always been an uneasiness with tenseless time arising from its awkwardness in dealing with our intuitions that we all view the world from roughly the same time and that this shared time is constantly changing. Michael Tooley (1997, 380) provides a fascinating quote from Rudolf Carnap revealing that none other than Albert Einstein was troubled by the anomaly that \"the experience of the Now means something special for man, something essentially different from the past and the future, but that this important difference does not and cannot occur within physics.\" Even Mellor seems to abjure on the issue of tense in his most recent defense of tenseless time:\n\nNot only does [my theory] show that [tensed statements] are untranslatable, it also shows why we need the [tensed beliefs] those statements express. [W]e need such beliefs to make us act successfully when our success depends, as it nearly always does, on our acting only at certain times (1998, 4).\n\nBoth Carnap and Mellor suggest that the science of psychology might explain the anomalies associated with tenseless space-time. Carnap reassures Einstein that \"the peculiarities of mans experiences with respect to time...can be described and (in principle) explained in psychology.\" (Tooley, 1997, 380) But why should it be necessary, or for that matter even possible, to shore up the tenseless theory of time with human psychology?\n\nPerhaps out of this uneasiness with tenseless time philosophers have shown an increasing openness to theories aimed at providing a coherent \"third way\" with respect to the metaphysics of time, a new approach that might improve upon the static, tenseless theory of space-time while avoiding the contradictions demonstrated early in this century by McTaggart with regard to changing tense attributes. This trend has been evidenced in recent years by the publication of two important works that seek to lay the foundations for a \"dynamic\" theory of time and/or tense. The first was Quentin Smiths Language and Time, followed more recently by the appearance of Michael Tooleys Time, Tense, and Causation. Smith presents a theory in which tensed facts \"inhere in the present\" (1993, 159). He thus avoids McTaggarts paradox by allowing tensed facts about past/future events to change relative to the successive \"presents\" in which they inhere. By contrast, Tooley attempts a tenseless ontology based on the concept of a dynamic \"accretion\" of times, as events progress towards the future. Tooley claims to avoid McTaggarts paradox by his stipulation that the emerging relations between present facts and their future successors are external relationships that do not result in contradictory properties for the events thus related. (1997, 378) While we may grant, for the sake of argument, that Smith and Tooley provide formally coherent theories of time, each theory requires significant leaps of faith with regard to certain key concepts and features. One wonders, for example, why Smiths Present needs the peculiar tensed facts to inhere in its changing ontological fabric. Is it merely to provide the \"semantic relata\" for tensed propositions? Tooleys source of dynamism, while perhaps skirting McTaggarts paradox of contradictory events, seems to run afoul of J. J. C. Smarts reductio with respect to \"temporal motion\" (1967, 126). Tooleys universe tenselessly comprehends all existing times, but nevertheless changes as new events come to be, resulting in a puzzling, seemingly tensed, \"truth at a time.\"\n\nDespite their odd features the temporal ontologies of Smith and Tooley might be judged worth the trouble were it not for a well-known, and disarmingly simple, alternative answer to the paradox of the \"moving Now.\" This alternative is not new, being advanced in recent times by British logician Arthur Prior, among others.\n\n2 Prior held that our language of changing times and tenses is a modal idiom that we employ in dealing with an objectively changing world. To use a modern term-of-art, we might say that for Prior changing times and tenses supervene on ordinary physical changes. Just how we may want to say that \"time supervenes on change\" is the subject of this paper. In my view the spare, reductionist ontology of time suggested in various of Priors expositions of his \"tense logic\" constitutes a novel form of time supervenience. It is a theory with unexpected advantages in dealing with time puzzles both ancient and modern. There are, of course, important objections to Priors tense logic and its suggested metaphysics of \"presentism.\" As a part of the defense of my view that time supervenes on change I shall address in a later section some of the more fruitful objections to Prior, in particular those presented by Le Poidevin in his detailed critique of Priors \"temporal solipsism\" (1991, 36-57). Nevertheless, the advantages of Priors theory of time should not be overlooked. Le Poidevin notes that, if coherent, Priors tense ontology is perhaps the most plausible way to avoid McTaggarts paradox while maintaining McTaggarts A-series intuitions of the significance of tensed propositions. (1991,34) I shall argue that, though sustaining charges of paradox, Priors critics fail to prove a logical or metaphysical fault. Few but the most dogmatic would deny that human language in general, and time language in particular, might develop and flourish in a world characterized by the supervenient times envisaged by Prior. Finally, to confront an obvious modern objection, I will of necessity offer arguments to show that in rejecting the popular \"tenseless\" metaphysics of space-time we need not reject the \"data\" revealed in the modern physics of space-time.\n\nThe Riddle of the Stopped Clock\n\nWe think of time as a physical feature of the world, an objective phenomenon as real as the spatial extension of the common objects we take for granted. We assume that times are things we can simply see in everyday events, be it in the swift flow of a river, or in the snail-like course of the hands of a clock. \"Seeing time\" in this way, its quite natural to think of the times of events as forming a changing sequence, a \"progress of time\" somehow underlying the changing properties of the objects that we see as \"progressing through time.\" We thus picture time as flowing swiftly with the river current, or inching ever so slowly with the advancing clock hands. Try as we may to abstract our view of time from these concrete images, its hard for us to imagine the normal course of times as anything other than, at the very least, a subtle kind of change.\n\nOf course, the paradoxes tied to the view of time as a \"changing\" thing are by now quite familiar to philosophers. A brief review will serve to remind us of the difficulties. In the first place, how are we to imagine the advance, or \"flow\" of time? Is it best seen in the swift rush of the river or in the snails pace of the clock? A strange question, to be sure, but what do we see in these unlike spatial motions that could stand as a common \"flow of time\" that both could share? The answer would seem at first to be found in the familiar picture of time as a space-like dimension, a physical \"metric\" which seems to allow us to posit a special dynamic \"moment\" of time motion that dissimilar spatial motions might share. But this approach to time is far from unproblematic. For one thing, the progress of time along the space-like time dimension cannot be conceived as having a space-like direction or speed, at least not in any way that we can easily picture. First, consider times \"direction.\" Whatever the spatial orientation of the physical time dimension that we may imagine, there will always be some spatial motions that cannot share a positive \"moment\" of motion along the chosen time dimension. Next, consider the matter of times \"speed.\" Smart and others have noted that our normal concept of movement presupposes time. Thus, trying to measure the progress of time in the way we ordinarily measure movements results in an infinite regress of meta-time dimensions.(1967, 126) For this reason, the progress of time along the time dimension cannot be conceived to have a \"speed,\" at least not in the ordinary way we conceive of the speed of a natural motion.\n\nThere are more problems for the space-like time dimension. The progress of time is found not just in rushing rivers and creeping clock hands but also in the turning colors of autumn leaves and the ascending notes of a piano scale. Why should we assume that these non-spatial changes, in order to \"progress\" through time, must participate in \"motions\" along a quasi-spatial time dimension? Isnt it just a fluke of our language that we do not think of time as \"reddening\" with the maple leaves or \"ascending\" with the piano notes? One last, and perhaps most puzzling, problem for the notion of a physical dimension of changing time is that changing times do not seem to require physical changes at all. One would think that conceiving of time as a \"moment\" of motion along a special time dimension would require a \"dynamics of time motion\" as do the physical \"moments\" of motion we measure along more familiar spatial dimensions. But this does not seem to be so with the \"changingness\" of time. There is a strangely preternatural quality to our concept of time that has led some scholars to treat the change of time as a kind of philosophers change not clearly tied in a natural way to more familiar types of physical change. We think, for example, of the flow of time as marking a wind-up clock even if that clock has long-since wound down. What prevents us from saying that such a \"stopped clock\" points to the winding down of (its) time? We do, of course, continue to see changes outside the clock. Do we imagine that these external changes somehow insinuate themselves inside the stopped clock? Or, more likely, do we imagine subtle, unseen changes within the stopped clock itself? Imagine for the moment that there were no physical changes to be found within the stopped clock. Would we still suspect it of undergoing an ineluctable, \"temporal\" change? It seems that we would, but why would we?\n\nThese \"metaphysical\" features of the change of time form the basis of a familiar riddle about time which we might label The Riddle of the Stopped Clock.\n\n3 The Riddle of the Stopped Clock, simply put, is this: if all physical objects, and all physical clocks, are characterized by the passage of time, why cant a Stopped Clock tell the time? Well, of course, we say, its because a stopped clock doesnt move. But the movements of the hands of a normal, working clock represent not merely a movement in time but also a movement in space. Why do we need this extra \"qualitative\" motion to have a workable clock? Perhaps due to the hegemony of the paradigm of \"space-time,\" philosophers seem well-stocked with responses to traditional time puzzles like this. For example, a \"stopped clock\" is said to be no more puzzling than a stopped odometer, or a ruler without gradations. But the difference between these cases should be obvious from our discussion of the \"invisibility\" of time. We can simply see spatial extents in a way that is not open to us in the presumed perception of extents of time. This means that the operations of an odometer in measuring space can be understood in a way not possible in the \"measurement of time\" by a clock. We can imagine the space traversed, the operations of the wheels, the gears, and the representational dial or numeric display. We know immediately what it might mean for such an odometer to be \"broken.\" We must ponder the obvious fact that this kind of understanding is not available to us as our clocks measure the \"passage of time.\"\n\nWhy cant a Stopped Clock chronicle its own progress through time? One conceivable explanation, though one that does not work, is that change in time, like change in spatial location, can be measured only in relation to a frame of reference. Thus, since everything is constantly in motion at the same rate with respect to time, there is no temporal frame of reference in relation to which the change of time of the Stopped Clock can be directly perceived. On the one hand this argument proves too much. The moving hands of a working clock progress with respect to time at the same rate as any other object in the universe, including our Stopped Clock. By this argument, then, there should be no temporal frame of reference in relation to which the change of time of a working clock could be observed, any more than in the case of the Stopped Clock. How can it be, then, that a working clock can tell the time while a Stopped Clock cannot? On the other hand the frame of reference argument proves too little. It suggests a merely contingent relationship between a clocks motions and the passage of time. But we know with far more than inductive certainty that a normal, moving, clock can \"tell the time.\" If there were a merely contingent relationship involved, we might imagine a clock \"defect\" wherein moving clockhands falsely indicate the passage of time, much like a broken odometer whose wildly spinning dial falsely indicates the traversal of space. But we do not accept this notion, finding it odd that a clocks hand movements should occur \"in no time.\"\n\nSumming up, the Riddle of the Stopped Clock shows two things: first, that the passage of time is tightly linked, some might say intrinsically linked, to the occurrence of qualitative change, and second, that the presumed passage of time for changeless objects is a singularly elusive commodity. Change of time for changeless objects must, it appears, be inferred on the basis of a theory of time from the proximate existence of changing objects. Assuming, for example, that objects can interact only if they are both at the same time, and observing that changeless objects are capable of interacting with changing objects at various phases of their change, we reason that time must change for such changeless objects. How else could they \"keep up in time\" with their changing counterparts? We thus have what we might label an \"atmospheric\" view of time according to which changing objects impart their temporality to nearby objects, even to objects that exhibit no temporality of their own. This \"atmospheric\" view of time has become less tenable with the advent of modern physics. Consider a variant of the \"twin paradox,\" a fable of relativity where astronauts returning to Earth appear younger than their associates who have remained at home. Despite the measured differences in their \"times,\" the astronauts and their earthbound colleagues succeed in shaking hands. Strictly speaking, we cannot say that the handshakers are all \"at the same time.\" All are characterized by their own clocks and their own times. Only an arbitrary decision can determine which of their clocks is the \"true clock.\" It appears that contiguity and interaction in space can no longer serve as unambiguous criteria for contiguity and interaction in time.\n\nWe have remarked on the fact that, faced with these paradoxes, many philosophers and scientists in our era have abandoned the idea that time is something that changes. It is important to document this point somewhat, for it may well come as a shock to the uninitiated that a significant segment of the scientific community, perhaps the dominant segment, does not think of the normal course of events as representing a \"flow of time.\" This viewpoint is made clear in a revealing characterization of space-time by physicist Robert Geroch:\n\nThere is no dynamics within space-time itself: nothing ever moves therein; nothing happens; nothing changes. In particular, one does not think of particles as moving through space-time, or as following along their world-lines. Rather, particles are just in space-time, once and for all, and the world-line represents, all at once, the complete life history of the particle (1978, 20-1).\n\nGeroch is forced to this static, \"non-dynamic\" view of space-time as a direct result of the paradoxes we have recounted with regard to the change of time. But it seems that more is lost in this popular metaphysics of space-time than merely the problematic changingness of time. The doctrine of the tenseless space-time continuum abandons, along with changes of times, changes of other sorts as well.\n\nIts not surprising to see a backlash against this static picture of space-time. The blunt challenge of Chisholm and Zimmerman is only the most recent of a continuing \"minority opinion\" that has included Broad, Prior, Schlesinger, Geach, Smith, Tooley and others, many of whom seek to account for the transitory character of times in terms of the notion of \"tense.\" However, theories of \"changing tenses\" have encountered their own special problems of coherence. Philosophers in this century from McTaggart (1908) to Smart (1967) and from Mellor (1981) to Le Poidevin (1991) have pointed to the vicious circles encountered by theories that attempt to introduce changes of tenses or times, however construed, into the standard space-time continuum. I have suggested that the answer to this dilemma is to be found in the view that the relationship between time and change is one of supervenience. We shall say that changing times and tenses supervene on ordinary physical changes. This formula may at first seem too close to the standard way of dealing with time to be of much use. In our era philosophers routinely analyze change in terms of time. By merely reversing this formula I may be suspected of rehashing a banal truism. However, the kind of \"temporal analysis of change\" one finds in typical discussions seems at bottom to rest on procedures which relate changes of one sort, say the movements of a rocket ship, to changes of another sort, typically the movements of a physical device which we by convention refer to as a \"clock.\" We may therefore wonder where the claimed time phenomenon comes into this kind of \"analysis\" of change. Of course, conventional wisdom claims to simply \"see\" time in such procedures used to \"analyze\" change.\n\n4 But we have seen the elusiveness of the \"times\" accessible to experience in this way. I shall argue that time cannot figure in these procedures in any verifiable sense and that from the point of view of our experience of time we would lose nothing, were we to say, paradoxically, that change exists, but time does not. Tempering this view somewhat, I have no difficulty with the semantics of ordinary time language if that language is seen merely as a convenient way of talking about change. Change is indeed real. The paradox that I do support is that within this context of real change time itself is, as McTaggart suspected, unreal. Time is unreal in the sense that the commonly imagined physical or metaphysical referents for time concepts are either incoherent, unverifiable, or superfluous in a well-crafted theory of time supervenience. No doubt, the concept of time exists in order to make sense of change. But time is not a special kind of change undergone by changing objects. Time truly supervenes on change.\n\nHow Time Supervenes on Change\n\nSupervenience, as that notion has emerged in contemporary philosophy, is a term-of-art with no \"natural\" meaning that we might usefully drawn upon. For this reason, I must take some care to mark, among the various uses of the term, that specific sense that can frame precisely what I mean when I say that \"time supervenes on change.\" Indeed, there is a well-known association of the term that I want in particular to avoid. I do not want to suggest that the existence of time belongs to our \"mental\" phenomenology. This might suggest that the supervenience involved in Priors theory is akin to a kind of idealism that would deny the possibility of coming to an objective understanding of temporal facts. This view is encouraged by the use of such labels as \"temporal solipsism\" (Le Poidevin, 1991, 36-44) and \"instrumentalism\" (Earman, 1989,166) to characterize theories of the type that Prior has advanced. The kind of time supervenience that I wish to advocate is far from the kind of anti-realism suggested by Le Poidevin and Earman. If time supervenes on change, the core of objective reality that is left to us is nothing other than the changing world we see before us, a brute fact of such power that we may well wonder some day how twentieth century metaphysicians could have strayed so far from it in their theories of a tenseless space-time.\n\nIn framing a concept of time supervenience that can preserve this robust reality of change there are two useful sources to draw upon. The first is taken from tenseless theorists themselves in their characterizations of the unreality of tense. The second derives from the work of Jaegwon Kim on the notion of natural supervenience.\n\nLe Poidevin remarks that the theory of tenseless time in its modern formulation emerged early in this century in reaction to a celebrated argument by McTaggart on the \"unreality of time.\"\n\n5 McTaggart proposed a metaphysics in which temporal change consists in a changing \"A-Series\" of tensed facts about an event, starting as future, coming to be present, and thence receding ever farther into the past. McTaggarts paradox results from his failure to frame a coherent picture of this putative \"A-Series\" of events as changing attributes of the \"B-Series\" of earlier-than, later-than events. The response of tenseless theorists to this paradox was to argue, not for the unreality of time, but rather for the unreality of McTaggarts notion of tense. Le Poidevin notes that for the tenseless theorist only the B-Series exists. \"The A-Series does not exist in reality, but is merely a feature of our representation of reality\" (1996, 471). This notion of the unreality of tense provides a useful model for the kind of supervenience that I want to propose. 6 In arguing that time supervenes on change we shall say in a similar manner that neither the A-Series nor the B-Series exists in reality, and that both time series are in fact features of our representation of a real, objectively changing world. Although this may seem uncomfortably close to McTaggarts thesis of the \"unreality of time,\" extending the supervenience of tense in this way is in fact important in avoiding the charge of anti-realism with regard to temporal phenomena. The representation of tense claimed in the tenseless view of the A-Series does not have to be seen as a merely \"mental\" phenomenon, but might be the object of a natural science of the human faculty of representation. The supervenience of time on this model is therefore not merely a metaphysical relation between objective reality and our mental intuitions of time but rather a natural relation between an objectively changing world and our objective representations of that world, representations that include concepts of time.\n\nJaegwon Kim is a good source to draw upon in characterizing this kind of \"natural\" relationship between our representations of time and the underlying grounds for those representations. In an analysis of phenomenal properties, Kim distinguishes between \"nomological\" supervenience (which seems akin to a \"weak\" supervenience), and \"metaphysical\" supervenience (which seems more like a \"strong\" supervenience). Kims account of nomological supervenience is as follows:\n\nFor each phenomenal property P, whenever some organism x instantiates P there is a physical/biological property B such that x instantiates B at that time, and it is a law of nature (i.e., holds as a matter of nomological necessity) that whenever any organism y instantiates B, y instantiates P at that time. (1996,173)\n\nAlthough Kim raises some doubts about the adequacy of nomological supervenience in accounting for phenomenal properties, this kind of natural supervenience seems to be just what we need to characterize the lawlike relationship between an objectively changing world and our objective representations of that changing world. This is still, admittedly, a \"weak\" supervenience, which leaves open the logical possibility that a \"Martian\" observer might have a representation of \"time\" quite unlike our own. This is an interesting consequence in its own right, and in any case is a small price to pay for the avoidance of the anti-realism that might otherwise be suggested by the theory that time supervenes on change.\n\nPriors Theory of Time Supervenience\n\nFrom an historical perspective, Arthur Priors \"tense logic\" was prompted by the same intuitions of \"tensed facts\" that puzzled other tense theorists (1959,17). For Prior, as for many advocates of tense, there is a crucial distinction between talk of past (or future) events and talk of the present, a difference not easily captured by talk of temporal relationships. On the other hand, Prior was uneasy with tense theories which seemed to postulate a domain of changing tense properties of past or future events. He wonders, for example, how the changing \"tense\" characteristics of the death of Queen Anne might be represented coherently as a physical change (1968, 12). Priors well-known response to these tense paradoxes was to propose a logical grammar of tense, a \"tense logic\" based on the paradigm of modal logic rather than the more familiar semantics of tense properties or relationships. Priors theory recasts propositions about the past and the future as modal statements of the form Pp, or Fp, where the modal operators P and F are to be rendered by phrases like \"it was the case that p\" or \"it will be the case that p.\" Propositions about the present are not provided with such modal tense operators: such \"present-tensed\" propositions are to be regarded as true or false simpliciter. The ontological significance of these modal tense operators can be seen in the fact that Prior regards them as primitive. That is to say, they cannot be reduced to statements about the presumed relationships between past or future events and the present, nor to statements about the presumed temporal properties characterizing past, present, or future events. This is in line with the character of Priors tense logic as a modal logic. Priors central point is that the ontology of past and future events presents the same issues as does the ontology of possible or imagined events. Past worlds (remembered worlds?) in Priors theory have no more need of reality than possible worlds, and past and future events need be characterized by tense properties only in the dubious sense in which we might imagine possible events to be characterized by a special property of \"possibility.\"\n\n(1970, 245) In keeping with this view, Prior conceives of the present, not as having a time property which distinguishes it from the past or the future, but rather as identical to the concept of the real:\n\n...the present simply is the real considered in relation to two particular species of unreality, namely the past and the future... (1970, 245).\n\nPriors notion of the present as the real, as distinguished from the unreal but remembered past, and the equally unreal but anticipated future, captures quite nicely the tense theorists demand for sharp tense distinctions. But it does so without postulating events with changing tense properties or relationships, concepts which McTaggart, and others including Dummett (1960) and Mellor (1981), have found to be incoherent. Priors theory provides a simple and elegant solution to the Riddle of the Stopped Clock. The Stopped Clock, seemingly fixed in time, has no distinguishable events that would allow the employment of our usual tense grammar. In the ideal case the Stopped Clock is truly timeless. By contrast, the normal clock, in virtue of its simple motions, has everything it needs to \"tell the time,\" but without physical time properties or relationships.\n\nPrinciples of Time Supervenience\n\n1. Times are not physical properties of objects or events.\n\nThe Stopped Clock is useless in telling the time precisely because it has no discernible properties that might be tied to one time rather than another. But the normal, moving clock is no more forthcoming in disclosing a changing, physical property related to its changing times. The successive times indicated by a clocks moving hands cannot be identified with any discernible properties of the moving clock hands. If times could be so identified, then we would be forced to accept as literally true the old saw that a stopped clock \"tells the time twice a day.\" A stopped clock, whatever its physical properties, cannot tell the time. A moving clock does not tell the time by exhibiting specifiable physical time properties.\n\n2. Times are not physical relations between objects or events.\n\nOnce again, the Stopped Clock presents an anomaly: no perceptible traces of the presumed physical time relationships are revealed to us in our successive \"looks\" at the Stopped Clock. We assume that our own \"successive looks,\" or the motions of a normal, moving clock overcome this difficulty by revealing to us the physical relationships that comprise time. But is this really the case? We are perhaps fooled by our usual, spatial metaphor for time. We often think of the change of time in terms of a change of spatial position. We see a bus start at the corner, move to mid-block, and then come to a stop at the next corner. It seems natural to associate the various spatial positions of the bus with its presumed \"temporal positions.\" Imagined in this way, it seems almost trivial to conclude that the temporal relationships of the bus at various times somehow mirror the progressive spatial positions that we remember. The problems with this assumption of space-like time relations can be brought out with a consideration of a change that does not involve spatial motion. Consider, for example, change of color. In experiencing a change of color we see time as vividly as in the case of the moving bus. But it is more difficult to imagine time as a kind of space-like relationship. Change has surely occurred, but the temporal relationships between the changing colors seem far more abstract than with spatial motions. Because the only real change that has occurred is a change of color, we cannot talk of the relationship of the before and after colors except by a re-imagining of the change itself (it was green, and then it was blue). There is no \"temporal space\" apparent in the transition between the green and the blue. Although it may be difficult for us to transpose these results to the case of spatial motion, they are exactly analogous. Although we may imagine that we see the successive temporal positions of the moving bus as a space-like progression, we in fact see, and remember, only its successive spatial positions. And, as in the case of change of color, we can only make sense of the \"successive\" nature of these spatial positions by re-imagining the spatial change itself (it was here, and then it was there).\n\n3. Changeless objects are timeless.\n\n\"Times\" naturally come into play in our concepts of changing objects. We have seen that, insofar as our experience of time is concerned, changeless objects are \"timeless.\" This is part of the explanation of the Riddle of the Stopped Clock. A timeless object cannot serve as an empirical standard of time. Is there nevertheless a need for \"times\" in our consideration of changeless objects? Could changeless objects be literally timeless? That we do not readily accept this paradox is due to our unstated belief that we must assume \"hidden\" times of changeless objects in order to be assured of their \"synchronization\" with changing objects. But without physical time properties or relationships, \"synchronization\" reduces to coexistence. And the coexistence of a changeless object is in no way threatened by the \"changingness\" of its neighbors. Changing objects, though they exhibit successive properties through their changes, dont \"get anywhere in time\" by their changes. They simply change. Thus, changeless objects, although timeless, have no trouble \"keeping up in time\" with changing objects. Le Poidevin notes this timelessness of changeless objects as a consequence of Priors theory. If we take Prior as identifying instants with the conjunction of propositions true at a certain time, then,\n\n..this would seem to rule out the possibility of time without qualitative change, for such a period would consist of instants whose associated conjunctions of propositions were identical. (1991, 54)\n\n4. Times are not natural properties or relationships exhibited by changing objects.\n\nChanging objects do not differ from changeless objects in virtue of a special natural property called time. Nor are the times exhibited by changing objects due to their participation in special natural relationships called time relationships. Rather, changing objects differ from changeless objects in virtue of the character of the properties they possess, the character of change, which is amenable to our temporal concepts. Thus, physical clocks in telling the time do not so much point to an independently existing time, as serve as conventional embodiments of change, and thus of time. Change is real, and basic. Time language finds its use in the description of this basic, physical fact. There is no physical \"analysis\" of this basic physical fact into more basic components. The relations that exist between past and present, or between present and future, are rightly considered, as Prior does, as comprising a rule-governed relationship of ideas, a \"tense logic,\" rather than a presumed tense, or event, \"physics.\"\n\n5. Time is not in any verifiable sense a physical dimension.\n\nThis, of course, contradicts our accustomed (and much sanctioned) picture of time as a physical dimension (the fourth dimension). It would not be an exaggeration to say that for most scientists (and philosophers) this dimensional view of time has come to seem elementary, even trivial. But as philosophers we must observe that, by an extension of Smarts paradox of movement in time, (1967) we can show that attempts to verify the existence of this temporal dimension must lead to an infinite regress of meta-time dimensions. We verify the juxtaposition of bodies on a spatial dimension by discovering the physical interactions of such juxtaposed bodies. But the verification of such spatial interactions presupposes time (much as in Smarts argument). We thus are confronted with a paradox if we assume that time itself is a physical dimension rather than simply the spatial motion involved in the verification of the spatial interaction. To verify the juxtaposition of events along this independent time dimension we would need to establish physical interactions between the events comprising this temporal dimension. But to find interactions on the physical time dimension itself would require a meta time dimension in relation to which the temporal interaction could be verified. We thus have the same infinite regress noted by Smart with respect to the notion of physical movement along the time dimension. 7\n\n6. Lawlike behavior cannot be conceived as a series of verifiable, physical relationships between temporally distinct events.\n\nThis thesis can be seen as a further corollary of Smarts argument. Because temporal relationships in general are not verifiable as physical relationships, lawlike behaviors, if conceived as a necessary subspecies of such temporal relationships, are themselves incapable of verification as physical relationships. Lawlikeness, insofar as we can verify it, must therefore be conceived as a monadic property of objects rather than a dyadic, or polyadic, relationship between objects.\n\n7. In a strict, physical sense being \"at the same time\" is meaningless.\n\nCritics of Priors \"presentism\" have claimed that it requires a concept of absolute simultaneity that is foreign to modern physics. However, if time supervenes on change, there are no physical times that objects can share. Thus, being \"at the same time\" is meaningless, even for co-existing objects or events. With the evidence of modern physics it seems just as well that this be the case. For example, in our fable from the theory of relativity, we imagine astronauts returning to Earth younger than their associates who had remained at home. Despite their claimed differences in times, the astronauts succeed in shaking hands. It is only in an informal sense, therefore, that we can say that we compare times by noting the physical coexistence of changing physical objects.\n\nThis is one area where we clearly diverge from Priors own view of the Present. 8 In considering the events on a distant pulsing star, Prior maintains:\n\nWe now consider the pulsation immediately after the one we are observing, and we ask whether this next pulsation, although we wont of course observe it for a while, is in fact going on right now...On the view of presentness which I have been suggesting, this is always a sensible question... Just this, however, is what the special theory of relativity appears to deny.(1970,247-8)\n\nHowever, we may speculate as to whether Prior really ought to have held an absolutist view of the present given the informal nature of the simultaneity that seems to follow from his view of the present. Although Le Poidevin has characterized Priors present as a conjunction of contemporaries (1991,37), Prior himself defines the present in terms of the real, that is, all that coexists. To avoid circularity, it ought to follow that coexistence itself cannot be defined in terms of a singular time, but rather in terms of the various procedures, real or imagined, that we might use to establish the possibility of physical interaction between coexisting elements. It would seem that the relativity, or frame-dependence, of the descriptions of \"coexisting\" events that results from such procedures ought to place Priors view of the Present squarely on the side of the special theory of relativity.\n\nNevertheless, we can appreciate Priors resistance to such a relative view of his Present, violating as it does what for Prior is most likely a logical concept of coexistence. Peter Geach expresses a similar objection to the view of simultaneity as a physical, as opposed to logical, matter (1980, 312). It appears that both Geach and Prior would reject the view that the relativity of our procedures for establishing coexistence entails the relativity of coexistence itself.\n\nThis matter is of course not closed with these brief remarks, and in fact remains one of the chief issues with presentism when confronted with modern physics. I shall have further remarks on the possible resolution of this issue in a section dealing with so-called \"time dilation.\"\n\nObjections\n\n1. Temporal Solipsism.\n\nOne criticism of Priors modal tense ontology has been the claimed \"solipsism\" resulting from Priors insistence on the \"unreality\" of the past and the future. Smith (1993,166) and Tooley (1997,235) point out the lack of \"semantic relata\" or \"truth-makers\" for past-tensed propositions. But the lack of such \"relata\" in no way lessens the practical validity of our memories of the past or our anticipations of the future. We can attribute as much practical weight as ever to lessons from the past and form as easily as ever prudent anticipations of the future. The roles of tensed statements in our \"language games\" are unchanged by Priors ontology of time.\n\n2. Problems of Fission and Fusion.\n\nLe Poidevin notes a problem with Priors anti-realist position concerning the past having to do with the identity of objects across times in the cases of object fission and/or fusion (1991,41-4). With a four-dimensional domain, it seems easy to account for such cases through the lawlike relationships between an object and its subdivided progeny, or between separate objects and their merged descendent. But without such \"causal relationships\" It may seem mysterious how fission and fusion are to be conceived at all. In response, we must first distinguish cases of \"mereological\" fission and fusion from those that involve what we might call \"metaphysical\" fission and fusion. In mereological cases, an object is in reality a group of more basic \"atoms\" which in separating or converging give the impression of object fission and fusion. There does not seem to be any problem for Prior with this kind of case. Fission and fusion here constitute variations in the spatial \"topology\" of a set of atoms, a kind of change that Prior can easily countenance. However, cases of \"metaphysical\" fission and fusion do seem to be a problem for a theory where changes in times supervene on changes. In these metaphysical cases there seems to be a \"coming to be\" of new atoms, or a \"ceasing to be\" of existing atoms. Priors theory does have a problem with such metaphysical changes, as I attempt to explain in the following section on Ramseys problem of Cardinality.\n\n3. The Paradox of Cardinality.\n\nExtending an argument from Frank Ramsey, Le Poidevin notes that it is a consequence of Priors ontology that the number of individuals in the his universe is necessarily fixed over time. (1991, 48-53) This does not seem to be a problem in a four-dimensional domain because the fixity of the domain applies across all of time as well as space. Thus, Earman has no difficulty in postulating for both classical and (certain) relativistic space-times objects which exist at some times but not at others (1989, 177-9). But for Prior, for whom the real exists only Now, this paradox of cardinality seems to fix the number of individuals that Now exist to all future and past \"presents\" as well. I shall not comment directly on Ramseys or Le Poidevins proof in this regard, other than to note that it rests on an important axiom of modal logic, namely, that:\n\nIf NOT(a=b), then NECESSARILY\n\nNOT(a=b).\n\nNevertheless, I do want to discuss a way in which Priors ontology of time lends itself to this kind of paradox. The problem for Prior is to provide a satisfying account of the metaphysical flavor of \"coming to be\" and \"ceasing to be.\" Consider \"ceasing to be.\" Immediately ruled out would seem to be the \"ceasing to be\" of a changeless object, since it has no times at which it might cease to be. So \"ceasing to be\" would appear to involve change. But how are we to understand this kind of \"metaphysical\" change in Priors ontology? Normal change we can attribute to an object that continues to exist (it was green, and then it was blue). But an object that ceases to exist results in a contradiction if understood in this sense (it was green, and then \"it\" was not). Normally, we would answer this by referring to a natural void, a continuing object to be sure, existing where the \"it\" used to be. But how do we know this natural void is \"where\" the object used to be? Only, it would seem, by observations of lawlike traces of the disappearing object. But this then negates the \"metaphysical\" nature of the presumed \"ceasing to be.\" Of course, we might view this \"problem\" for Prior as an advantage. It puts him in the respectable company of Kant, for example, on the eternity of time. And is it just an accident that our natural laws seem to rule out the kind of \"metaphysical\" change that Priors theory fails to comprehend?\n\n4. The Theory of Propositional Instants.\n\nLe Poidevin claims that the temporal solipsist is committed to an untenable \"theory of propositional instants.\" (1991, 53-7) He makes two points in this regard. The first is that an ontology of instants as \"events\" is foreclosed by the solipsists anti-realism with regard to past and future events. The second is that an acceptable theory of propositions must include the time of reference as part of its content. Responding to the first point, I need only two types of entities for a world in which time supervenes on change. I need substances and properties capable of change. Events might be thought of as a way of describing the changes of such substances and properties. Denying that such events might exist, or insisting that such changes do not support an adequate ontology of events is question-begging.\n\nThe second point may be related to a point by Zimmerman (1997, 83) and others about the difficulties in individuating events that have no \"time\" attribute. Zimmerman imagines an oscillating Universe wherein the attributes of events during each cycle are identical. Maintaining the distinctness of the otherwise identical events without physical time attributes amounts, in Zimmermans view, to a kind of \"event-existentialism.\" In response, there are two possible courses open to the proponent of events without times. The first is simply to embrace event-existentialism, the irreducible \"haecceity\" of events. This is, by the way, a familiar recourse in the example of the absolute vs. relative views of space, where the same problem arises in individuating spatially identical objects in a symmetrical universe without stipulating absolute spatial locations. But there is another option for a theory of supervenient time. We might admit a truly reversible change, from A to B to A, that would nevertheless be represented in a supervening B-Series as \"first A, then B, then A,\" but of course the \"knower\" is then conceived as being outside the perceived \"world.\"\n\n5. The Lack of a Physical Time Metric.\n\nJohn Earman voices a kind of objection that amounts to a methodological dismissal of certain theories that do not seem to provide a satisfactory semantic grounding for space-time theories. Thus, Earman claims that a Machian space-time, which contains no physical time metric, is incapable of supporting a physical theory that can express what we mean when we say that an object is moving at a certain speed, or is accelerating at a certain rate (1989,30). Using Newtonian formulas to express principles of moving bodies in such a Machian space-time is for Earman akin to a kind of \"instrumentalism\" (1989,128). Note that the anti-realism suggested by Earman is not really a fair assessment of the situation. We can simply perceive such facts as the relative \"speed\" of a change and sense the change in motion involved in an \"acceleration.\" Although the universe might be more satisfying if we could provide the graphical analysis afforded by the imagined time metric, we do not really need a physical time metric for events like velocity and acceleration to be recognized as objective facts.\n\n6. Time \"Dilation\".\n\nThis brings us to that puzzling artifact of modern physics, the phenomenon of \"time dilation.\" It should come as no surprise that a theory that rejects the physical \"time dimension\" must view an hypothesized \"dilation\" of that dimension with a certain skepticism. No doubt, there are real, objective facts to be explained, whether encountered today in the laboratory with the extensions of the brief lives of speeding mu-meson particles, or tomorrow in the palpable agelessness of light-speed astronauts. But a theory of supervenient time has many avenues open to it to explain such facts. One approach, which appears to be shared by Smith and Tooley, is to regard modern frame-dependent views of simultaneity as resulting from the limitations in our verification procedures, which are of necessity affected by the limitations of the signal speed of light. This empirical limitation is thought to mask an underlying \"metaphysical\" simultaneity which is absolute. A second approach might be to treat frame-dependent relativity as a reflection of a real complexity in the actual coexisting Present. This approach would postulate additional space-like dimensions to explain the different objective points of view accessible to different reference frames. Although ingenious, this second approach is to my way of thinking less attractive, sacrificing as it does the elegant simplicity of Priors time supervenience for a suspiciously ad-hoc \"hyperspace.\" Moreover, in cases like our variant of the \"twin paradox,\" it seems that we want to say that the returning light-speed astronauts and their homebound colleagues co-exist in a very absolute sort of way. They really do shake hands despite their differing \"times.\" We must suspect from our discussion of the \"invisibility\" of time that, if time supervenes on change, the astronauts differing times can only mean differing changes for the astronauts. Its hard to escape the conclusion that changes of one sort (high translational velocity) result in changes of other sorts (e.g. clock movements and natural aging processes). Insisting upon the absolute co-existence of the astronauts shifts the focus from their differing \"space-time locations\" to the real mystery of the matter: the obvious and profound differences in the changes the astronauts have experienced. 9\n\nAdvantages\n\n1. In what sense can there be a direction, or \"arrow,\" of time?\n\nIf time weakly supervenes on change, the issues surrounding the \"arrow\" of time are changed in several respects. In one sense, the \"arrow\" seems tied to the idea of time as a physical dimension. In this sense we must conclude that, if the time dimension itself is unreal, so must be the \"direction\" of time evidenced by any particular change. However, the \"asymmetry\" of time often seems to refer to the asymmetry or irreversibility of change itself. Regarding asymmetry, though changes are \"necessarily\" asymmetric, they are so only in the trivial sense that a change is always from some A to some B, a change from A to A not counting as a change at all. Further, because time weakly supervenes on change, the perceived \"direction\" of the change is determined by our natural faculty of perceiving change. Although hard to imagine, what we perceive as a change from A to B might be perceived by a \"Martian\" as a change from B to A. Regarding reversibility, in a theory of supervenient time it is not clear that a reversible change can mark a reversible time. If changing objects dont \"get anywhere in time\" by their changes, they cannot be conceived to \"get back in time,\" however reversible their changes may be. Finally, as our theory shows, even with a truly reversible change from A-to-B-to-A, our representation of the B-series might remain as \"first A, then B, then A.\"\n\n2. In what sense can \"time travel\" be possible?\n\nThe astronaut fable shows the problem with time travel. From the point of view of the homebound astronauts, the laws of physics have slowed the times of the returning astronauts. But it makes no more sense to say that the returning astronauts have traveled to the future than it does to say that the homebound astronauts have traveled to the past in order to participate in the same handshake. If times supervene on changes, there are no times one can \"be at\" or \"travel to.\" With supervenient time, the times of co-existing true clocks may differ, but there is no sense in which such clocks can \"travel in time.\"\n\n3. Nelson Goodmans \"new riddle of induction\".\n\nThe \"new riddle of induction\" was the puzzle that some physical attributes quite easily imagined by philosophers do not seem to qualify for scientists as potential lawlike, or \"projectable\" predicates. Goodmans celebrated example of a non-projectable predicate, the \"Grue\" predicate, appears to be tied to a view of time. It is thus an interesting consequence of Priors theory that the \"Grue\" riddle is rebutted. Goodmans \"Grue\" objects are green until time t, thence are blue. But we can see that the supposed \"Grue\" property, including as it does the supposed property \"at time t\" does not, in a world of supervenient time, specify a verifiable natural property at all. Time by itself wont do, because time is, as Leibniz insisted, nothing at all but the changing objects that comprise it. Saying that an object is Grue thus says no more than that the object changes from green to blue. 10\n\n4. Free-will and Determinism.\n\nPhilosophers have often hypothesized \"deterministic\" constraints on human freedom resulting from our position as creatures within a lawlike, natural world. However, in the face of these presumed constraints our experience presents us with a puzzling anomaly. Apart from the familiar limitations posed by our physical environment, we generally think of ourselves as \"free.\" Of course, this kind of naive empiricism has not often proved convincing among philosophers, who have been quick to propose various arguments to show that, even if not experienced, deterministic constraints might still be real. The metaphysics of time is involved in this debate because one of the familiar arguments proposed to justify deterministic constraints assumes a certain picture of time. According to this view, deterministic constraints occur because they are the \"necessary temporal antecedents\" of our lawlike behavior. It is reasoned that, even if not experienced, these necessary temporal antecedents might be theoretically justified as constraints on the basis of their analogy to the more familiar constraints on freedom posed by our experienced, physical environment. However, on the basis of the arguments from Smart (1967, 126) and Newman (1988, 545), it becomes clear that this imagined temporal analogy is a deeply flawed notion. 11 It is therefore an advantage of Priors ontology of time that this presumed analogy is ruled out from the start. 12\n\nLawlikeness in a world of supervenient time presents a very different face from that imagined in a world of relational time. Because of the nonrelational, monadic character of lawlikeness in this view, the past (or the future) cannot be thought to present a credible threat to freedom in any way analogous to those physical constraints familiar to us in dealing with the present. Actual constraints achieve their constraining character by their continuing physical relationships to us in the present, that is, as coexisting objects. In a world of supervenient time, lawlikeness has no special role to play in determining which coexisting physical properties we come to see as constraints on our freedom. While it is true that many of our constraints are lawlike phenomena, constraints can just as easily be random, or anomalous, phenomena. One is reminded of Wittgensteins imagined railroad tracks that \"suddenly change their shape\" (Smythies, 1989, 85). An indeterminate railroad, though less predictable, might still constrain. We cannot even say with confidence that the elimination of our lawlike environment would result in freedom. Real, palpable, constraints on freedom can arise from the absence of a lawlike environment that would normally enable free action (think of the hapless astronaut on a space walk).\n\n5. Peter Van Inwagens \"Consequence Argument.\"\n\nConstraints on human free will have also been claimed to follow as logically necessary consequences of past facts and the existence of natural laws. However, within Priors tense logic it is difficult even to express coherently the idea of a logically necessary consequence spanning time. Thus, Peter van Inwagens Consequence Argument comes into question. (1983, 16) In Priors tense grammar, the idea that temporally prior conditions plus natural laws can logically entail a temporally advanced consequence comes out something like the following:\n\nP (p & (p -> Fq ) ) -> P (Fq).\n\nThe meaning of the modal consequence \"P(Fq)\" is open to question in a way that a simple, non-modal consequence \"q\" would not be.\n\n6. The Reality of Change.\n\nAlthough I have suggested that a coherent alternative to Priors supervenient time is provided by the Standard tenseless theory of space-time, I want to conclude with an argument against that theory. The problem for the Standard theory of time, as is evident in the remarks of Mellor and Einstein, is to account for our undoubted experience of change in such a changeless, tenseless, space-time continuum. Mellor, and Carnap before him, suggest that this experience of the \"moving Now\" is due to our human psychology. Our psychology accounts for the changing succession of our experience. But how, within the Standard theory, are we to give an objective account of this \"psychology\" of changing perceptions? Only, it would seem, through a picture of a succession of experiences of the changeless space-time continuum from a succession of positions in this continuum. But, according to the Standard theory, this succession itself can be nothing other than a series of \"experience events\" corresponding to the occurrence of our experiences at the times claimed. This series of experience events can no more involve change than can the events that we claim to experience. Moreover, no number of apperceptive layers of experience can remedy this essential changelessness of the standard view of space-time. Ultimately, our conclusion must be that Priors theory of supervenient time is superior to the Standard theory, not on the basis of bald coherence, but rather on the basis of our undoubted experience of change. Priors theory starts from that experience, while the Standard theory struggles, and ultimately fails, to explain it.\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\nSee McTaggart (1908), Smart (1967), Dummett (1960), and Mellor (1981); on scientist-philosophers, see Hawkings (1988), Geroch (1978), Price (1996), and Earman (1989).\n\n2\n\nSee Prior (1970, 245).

(1981, 47)\n\n4\n\nMellor (1981, 27) states that \"Nothing is more observable than temporal order,\" and in an e-mail suggests this knowledge is derived from experience of simple motions of, for example, clocks.\n\n5\n\nLe Poidevin (in his forthcoming Questions of Time and Tense) states that an early protagonist of the tenseless theory of time contra McTaggart was Bertrand Russell.\n\n6\n\nBoth Le Poidevin (1991, 3) and Tooley (1997, 17) have characterized this relationship between the \"unreal\" A-series and the real B-series as a kind of \"supervenience.\" But in a private conversation Le Poidevin was not happy with the term \"supervenience\" used in this context.\n\n7\n\nThe \"Smart Argument\" I attribute to J.J.C. Smart (1967, 126). Steve Savitt also uses it (1995, 8).\n\n8\n\nI am indebted to Dean Zimmerman for identifying this divergence from Priors theory.\n\n9\n\nIn an e-mail Alan White confirms this effect on the changes of the \"twins\" that affects not only their clocks but their biological processes. Professor White is quick to caution against viewing these changes as \"caused\" in some way by an external force. They are simply intrinsic to the reference frame of the light-speed astronaut. See V. Allen White \"Whitehead and the Twin Paradox\" available via Professor Chalmers' Individuals with On-Line Papers in Philosophy.\n\n10\n\nThis is the account of Nelson Goodman's new riddle of induction in Barker and Achinstein (Nidditch,1968, 149).\n\n11\n\nSee Smart (1967, 126), and Newman (1988, 545). Andrew Newmans argument in particular seems air-tight: \"Given any two distinct events between Et1 and Et2, however close together, they still exist at different times and are separated by a finite distance. There is no more possibility of them interacting than there is for Et1 and Et2 themselves. ...Events are not, and cannot be, the sort of things which interact with each other.\"\n\n12\n\nFor more on the relationship of time supervenience to Free-Will see my Time and Free-Will (Pendleton, 1999).\n\nReferences\n\nS.
