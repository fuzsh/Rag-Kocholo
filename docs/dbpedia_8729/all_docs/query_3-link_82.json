McTaggart's Paradox argues that a theory combining a tenseless ontology of events with intrinsic temporal properties like pastness and futurity leads to contradiction. The paradox assumes events exist tenselessly in a B-series and successively acquire properties like presentness. Contemporary defenders of the paradox similarly assume a B-series ontology coupled with A-theoretic becoming. However, the paradox does not apply to a pure A-theory where only the present is real, like presentism. It really argues against a hybrid A-B-theory, not A-theory itself.",
