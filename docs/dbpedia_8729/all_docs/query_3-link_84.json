        "text": "Language\n\nIf a lion could talk, we could not understand him.\n\nPhilosophical problems can be compared to locks on safes, which can be opened by dialing a certain word or number, so that no force can open the door until just this word has been hit upon, and once it is hit upon any child can open it.\n\nPhilosophy is like trying to open a safe with a combination lock: each little adjustment of the dials seems to achieve nothing, only when everything is in place does the door open.\n\nLanguage is a part of our organism and no less complicated than it.\n\nMy difficulty is only an â enormous â difficulty of expression.\n\nPhilosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of our language.\n\nThe limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n\nThe limits of my language are the limits of my mind. All I know is what I have words for.\n\nThe world is my world: this is manifest in the fact that the limits of language (of that language which alone I understand) mean the limits of my world.\n\nThis remark provides the key to the problem, how much truth there is in solipsism. For what the solipsist means is quite correct; only it cannot be said, but makes itself manifest.\n\nLogic pervades the world: the limits of the world are also its limits.\n\nSo we cannot say in logic, \"The world has this in it, and this, but not that.\" For that would appear to presuppose that we were excluding certain possibilities, and this cannot be the case, since it would require that logic should go beyond the limits of the world; for only in that way could it view those limits from the other side as well. We cannot think what we cannot think; so what we cannot think we cannot say either.\n\nThe aim of philosophy is to erect a wall at the point where language stops anyway.\n\nFor a large class of cases â though not for all â in which we employ the word meaning it can be explained thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n\nThe meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n\nIt is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that it exists.\n\nThere are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nThe difficulty in philosophy is to say no more than we know.\n\nWhat can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.\n\nPhilosophizing is: rejecting false arguments.\n\nMy aim is: to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to something that is patent nonsense.\n\nPhilosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and then ask the grown-up \"What's that?\" â It happened like this: the grown-up had drawn pictures for the child several times and said \"this is a man,\" \"this is a house,\" etc. And then the child makes some marks too and asks: what's this then?\n\nIt is one of the chief skills of the philosopher not to occupy himself with questions which do not concern him.\n\nOne of the most difficult of the philosopher's tasks is to find out where the shoe pinches.\n\nLogic takes care of itself; all we have to do is to look and see how it does it.\n\nThe world is the totality of facts, not things.\n\nYou won't â I really believe â get too much out of reading it (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus). Because you won't understand it; the content will seem strange to you. In reality, it isn't strange to you, for the point is ethical. I once wanted to give a few words in the foreword which now actually are not in it, which, however, I'll write to you now because they might be a key for you: I wanted to write that my work consists of two parts: of the one which is here, and of everything which I have not written. And precisely this second part is the important one.\n\nMy propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them... He must so to speak throw away the ladder...\n\nA serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.\n\nPhilosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not result in 'philosophical propositions', but rather in the clarification of propositions. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries.\n\nPhilosophy is not a theory but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. The result of philosophy is not a number of \"philosophical propositions.\" but to make propositions clear.\n\nEvery explanation is after all an hypothesis.\n\nFreud's fanciful pseudo-explanations (precisely because they are brilliant) perform a disservice.\n\nNow any ass has these pictures available to use in \"explaining\" symptoms of an illness.\n\nPhilosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language; it can in the end only describe it.\n\nA tautology's truth is certain, a proposition's possible, a contradiction's impossible. (Certain, possible, impossible: here we have the first indication of the scale that we need in the theory of probability.).\n\nLike everything metaphysical the harmony between thought and reality is to be found in the grammar of the language.\n\nWhat we do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.\n\nWhat we are destroying is nothing but houses of cards and we are clearing up the ground of language on which they stood.\n\nWhen I obey a rule, I do not choose. I obey the rule blindly.\n\nScience\n\nMan has to awaken to wonder â and so perhaps do peoples. Science is a way of sending him to sleep again.\n\nPhilosophy unravels the knots in our thinking; hence its results must be simple, but its activity is as complicated as the knots that it unravels.\n\nWittgenstein was basically unscientific. He knew that science was partly driven by a desire to generalize, and he rejected generalization. Scientific questions were of no great interest to him; they merely addressed the working of the natural world. Wittgenstein spent much of his later life examining the way in which language may shape our reality. This is not a subject that is irrelevant to science. ~ Brian L. Silver\n\nKnowledge\n\nKnowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement.\n\nIt is quite impossible for a proposition to state that it itself is true.\n\nOne often makes a remark and only later sees how true it is.\n\nIn philosophy the race is to the one who can run slowestâthe one who crosses the finish line last.\n\nLife\n\nIf people did not sometimes do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.\n\nIt's only by thinking even more crazily than philosophers do that you can solve their problems.\n\nNever stay up on the barren heights of cleverness, but come down into the green valleys of silliness.\n\nDon't for heaven's sake, be afraid of talking nonsense! But you must pay attention to your nonsense.\n\nDon't get involved in partial problems, but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem, even if this view is still not a clear one.\n\nDeath is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present. Our life has no end in just the way in which our visual field has no limits.\n\nIf you use a trick in logic, whom can you be tricking other than yourself?\n\nNothing is so difficult as not deceiving oneself.\n\nResting on your laurels is as dangerous as resting when you are walking in the snow. You doze off and die in your sleep.\n\nIf you want to go down deep you do not need to travel far; indeed, you don't have to leave your most immediate and familiar surroundings.\n\nI don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.\n\nWe are asleep. Our Life is a dream. But we wake up sometimes, just enough to know that we are dreaming.\n\nTell them I've had a wonderful life. ~ Wittgenstein before his death\n\nGod and and the purpose of life\n\nThe way you use the word \"God\" does not show whom you mean â but, rather, what you mean.\n\nMake sure that your religion is a matter between you and God only.\n\nWhat do I know about God and the purpose of life? I know that this world exists.\n\nTo believe in a God means to see that the facts of the world are not the end of the matter.\n\nTo believe in a God means to understand the question about the meaning of life.\n\nTo believe in God means to see that life has a meaning.\n\nThe meaning of life, i.e. the meaning of the world, we can call God.\n\nTo pray is to think about the meaning of life.\n\nThis meaning does not lie in it but outside of it.\n\nThat life is the world.\n\nThat my will penetrates the world.\n\nThat my will is good or evil.\n\nTherefore that good and evil are somehow connected with the meaning of the world.\n\nCertainly it is correct to say: Conscience is the voice of God.\n\nTherefore that good and evil are somehow connected with the meaning of the world.\n\nFor a truly religious man nothing is tragic.\n\nEthics and Aesthetics\n\nThe World and Life are one. â¦ Ethics and Aesthetics are one.\n\nEthics does not treat of the world. Ethics must be a condition of the world, like logic.\n\nI am either happy or unhappy, that is all. It can be said: good or evil do not exist.\n\nA man who is happy must have no fear. Not even in the face of death.\n\nOnly a man who lives not in time but in the present is happy.\n\nOne might say: art shows us the miracles of nature. It is based on the concept of the miracles of nature.\n\nQuotes about Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\nHe was the kind of man who would never have noticed such small matters as bursting shells when he was thinking about logic. ~ Bertrand Russell\n\nJust about at the time of the Armistice his father had died, and Wittgenstein inherited the bulk of his fortune. He came to the conclusion, however, that money is a nuisance to a philosopher, so he gave every penny of it to his brother and sisters. Consequently he was unable to pay the fare from Vienna to the Hague, and was far too proud to accept it from me. â¦ He must have suffered during this time hunger and considerable privation, though it was very seldom that he could be induced to say anything about it, as he had the pride of Lucifer. At last his sister decided to build a house, and employed him as an architect. This gave him enough to eat for several years, at the end of which he returned to Cambridge as a don... ~ Bertrand Russell\n\nThere are two great men in history with whom he [Wittgenstein] somewhat resembles. One was Pascal, other was Tolstoy. Pascal was a mathematician of genius, but abandoned mathematics for piety. Tolstoy sacrificed his genius as a writer to a kind of bogus humility which made him prefer peasants to educated men and Uncle Tom's Cabin to all other works of fiction. Wittgenstein, who could play with metaphysical intricacies as cleverly as Pascal with Hexagons or Tolstoy with emperors, threw away this talent and debased himself before the peasants â in each case from an impulse of pride. I admired Wittgenstein's Tractatus but not his later work, which seemed to me to involve an abnegation of his own best talent very similar to those of Pascal and Tolstoy.... [M]ental torments which made him and Pascal and Tolstoy pardonable in spite of their treachery to their own greatness. ~ Bertrand Russell\n\nWhen I met Wittgenstein, I saw that Schlick's warnings were fully justified. But his behavior was not caused by any arrogance. In general, he was of a sympathetic temperament and very kind; but he was hypersensitive and easily irritated. Whatever he said was always interesting and stimulating and the way in which he expressed it was often fascinating. His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer. When he started to formulate his view on some specific problem, we often felt the internal struggle that occurred in him at that very moment, a struggle by which he tried to penetrate from darkness to light under an intense and painful strain, which was even visible on his most expressive face. When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation. Not that he asserted his views dogmatically â¦ But the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment of analysis of it would be a profanation. ~ Rudolf Carnap\n\nFinally, toward the end of my time in Cambridge, I ventured to speak to him. I told him I had enjoyed reading the Tractatus, and I asked him whether he still held the same views that he had expressed twenty-eight years earlier. He remained silent for a long time and then said, âWhich newspaper do you represent?â I told him I was a student and not a journalist, but he never answered my question. Wittgensteinâs response to me was humiliating, and his response to female students who tried to attend his lectures was even worse. If a woman appeared in the audience, he would remain standing silent until she left the room. I decided that he was a charlatan using outrageous behavior to attract attention. I hated him for his rudeness. Fifty years later, walking through a churchyard on the outskirts of Cambridge on a sunny morning in winter, I came by chance upon his tombstone, a massive block of stone lightly covered with fresh snow. On the stone was written the single word, âWITTGENSTEIN.â To my surprise, I found that the old hatred was gone, replaced by a deeper understanding. He was at peace, and I was at peace too, in the white silence. He was no longer an ill-tempered charlatan. He was a tortured soul, the last survivor of a family with a tragic history, living a lonely life among strangers, trying until the end to express the inexpressible. ~ Freeman Dyson\n\nWhat is it about the study of philosophy that tends to make brilliant minds stupid when it comes down to what are known as actual cases? Consider Martin Heidegger, Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, the four great names in twentieth-century philosophy: the first was a Nazi, the second died certain that America was responsible for all the worldâs evil, the third was a Stalinist long after any justification for being so could be adduced, and the fourth lived on the borders of madness most of his life. Contemplation of the lives of philosophers is enough to drive one to the study of sociology. ~ Joseph Epstein\n\nHe was like an atomic bomb, a tornado â people don't appreciate that. ~ W. A. Hijab, a student of Wittgenstein\n\nWell, God has arrived. I met him on the 5:15 train. He has a plan to stay in Cambridge permanently. ~ John Maynard Keynes, after meeting with Wittgenstein at his arrival in Cambridge, in a letter to his wife\n\nA good guide will take you through the more important streets more often than he takes you down side streets; a bad guide will do the opposite. In philosophy I'm a rather bad guide. Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\nBach wrote on the title page of his OrgelbÃ¼chlein: \"To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.\" That is what I would have liked to say about my work. Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\n1. If you do know that here is one hand, we'll grant you all the rest.\n\nWhen one says that such and such a proposition can't be proved, of course that does not mean that it can't be derived from other propositions; any proposition can be derived from other ones. But they may be no more certain than it is itself. (On this a curious remark by H.Newman.)\n\n4. \"I know that I am a human being.\" In order to see how unclear the sense of this proposition is, consider its negation. At most it might be taken to mean \"I know I have the organs of a human\". (E.g. a brain which, after all, no one has ever yet seen.) But what about such a proposition as \"I know I have a brain\"? Can I doubt it? Grounds for doubt are lacking! Everything speaks in its favour, nothing against it. Nevertheless it is imaginable that my skull should turn out empty when it was operated on.\n\n6. Now, can one enumerate what one knows (like Moore)? Straight off like that, I believe not. â For otherwise the expression \"I know\" gets misused. And through this misuse a queer and extremely important mental state seems to be revealed.\n\n7. My life shows that I know or am certain that there is a chair over there, or a door, and so on. â I tell a friend e.g. \"Take that chair over there\", \"Shut the door\", etc. etc.\n\n8. The difference between the concept of 'knowing' and the concept of 'being certain' isn't of any great importance at all, except where \"I know\" is meant to mean: I can't be wrong. In a law-court, for example, \"I am certain\" could replace \"I know\" in every piece of testimony. We might even imagine its being forbidden to say \"I know\" there. [A passage in \"Wilhelm Meister\", where \"You know\" or \"You knew\" is used in the sense \"You were certain\", the facts being different from what he knew.]\n\n12. - For \"I know\" seems to describe a state of affairs which guarantees what is known, guarantees it as a fact. One always forgets the expression \"I thought I knew\".\n\n14. That he does know remains to be shown.\n\n15. It needs to be shown that no mistake was possible. Giving the assurance \"I know\" doesn't suffice. For it is after all only an assurance that I can't be making a mistake, and it needs to be objectively established that I am not making a mistake about that.\n\n16. \"If I know something, then I also know that I know it, etc.\" amounts to: \"I know that\" means \"I am incapable of being wrong about that.\" But whether I am so must admit of being established objectively.\n\n18. \"I know\" often means: I have the proper grounds for my statement. So if the other person is acquainted with the language-game, he would admit that I know. The other, if he is acquainted with the language-game, must be able to imagine how one may know something of the kind.\n\n19. The statement \"I know that here is a hand\" may then be continued: \"for it's my hand that I'm looking at.\" Then a reasonable man will not doubt that I know. - Nor will the idealist; rather he will say that he was not dealing with the practical doubt which is being dismissed, but there is a further doubt behind that one. - That this is an illusion has to be shown in a different way.\n\n53. So one might grant that Moore was right, if he is interpreted like this: a proposition saying that here is a physical object may have the same logical status as one saying that here is a red patch.\n\n54. For it is not true that a mistake merely gets more and more improbable as we pass from the planet to my own hand. No: at some point it has ceased to be conceivable.\n\nThis is already suggested by the following: if it were not so, it would also be conceivable that we should be wrong in every statement about physical objects; that any we ever make are mistaken.\n\n55. So is the hypothesis possible, that all the things around us don't exist? Would that not be like the hypothesis of our having miscalculated in all our calculations?\n\n61. ...A meaning of a word is a kind of employment of it.\n\nFor it is what we learn when the word is incorporated into our language.\n\n62. That is why there exists a correspondence between the concepts 'rule' and 'meaning'.\n\n65. When language-games change, then there is a change in concepts, and with the concepts the meanings of words change.\n\n==========\n\n66. I make assertions about reality, assertions which have different degrees of assurance. How does the degree of assurance come out? What consequences has it?\n\nWe may be dealing, for example, with the certainty of memory, or again of perception. I may be sure of something, but still know what test might convince me of error. I am e.g. quite sure of the date of a battle, but if I should find a different date in a recognized work of history, I should alter my opinion, and this would not mean I lost all faith in judging.\n\n71. If my friend were to imagine one day that he had been living for a long time past in such and such a place, etc. etc., I should not call this a mistake, but rather a mental disturbance, perhaps a transient one.\n\n83. The truth of certain empirical propositions belongs to our frame of reference.\n\n84. Moore says he knows that the earth existed long before his birth. And put like that it seems to be a personal statement about him, even if it is in addition a statement about the physical world. Now it is philosophically uninteresting whether Moore knows this or that, but it is interesting that, and how, it can be known. If Moore had informed us that he knew the distance separating certain stars, we might conclude from that that he had made some special investigations, and we shall want to know what these were. But Moore chooses precisely a case in which we all seem to know the same as he, and without being able to say how. I believe e.g. that I know as much about this matter (the existence of the earth) as Moore does, and if he knows that it is as he says, then I know it too. For it isn't, either, as if he had arrived at this proposition by pursuing some line of thought which, while it is open to me, I have not in fact pursued.\n\n89. One would like to say: \"Everything speaks for, and nothing against the earth's having existed long before...\"\n\nYet might I not believe the contrary after all? But the question is: What would the practical effects of this belief be? - Perhaps someone says: \"That's not the point. A belief is what it is whether it has any practical effects or not.\" One thinks: It is the same adjustment of the human mind anyway.\n\n90. \"I know\" has a primitive meaning similar to and related to \"I see\" (\"wissen\", \"videre\"). And \"I knew he was in the room, but he wasn't in the room\" is like \"I saw him in the room, but he wasn't there\". \"I know\" is supposed to express a relation, not between me and the sense of a proposition (like \"I believe\") but between me and a fact. So that the fact is taken into my consciousness. (Here is the reason why one wants to say that nothing that goes on in the outer world is really known, but only what happens in the domain of what are called sense-data.) This would give us a picture of knowing as the perception of an outer event through visual rays which project it as it is into the eye and the consciousness. Only then the question at once arises whether one can be certain of this projection. And this picture does indeed show how our imagination presents knowledge, but not what lies at the bottom of this presentation.\n\n91. If Moore says he knows the earth existed etc., most of us will grant him that it has existed all that time, and also believe him when he says he is convinced of it. But has he also got the right ground for this conviction? For if not, then after all he doesn't know (Russell).\n\n92. However, we can ask: May someone have telling grounds for believing that the earth has only existed for a short time, say since his own birth? - Suppose he had always been told that, - would he have any good reason to doubt it? Men have believed that they could make the rain; why should not a king be brought up in the belief that the world began with him? And if Moore and this king were to meet and discuss, could Moore really prove his belief to be the right one? I do not say that Moore could not convert the king to his view, but it would be a conversion of a special kind; the king would be brought to look at the world in a different way.\n\nRemember that one is sometimes convinced of the correctness of a view by its simplicity or symmetry, i.e., these are what induce one to go over to this point of view. One then simply says something like: \"That's how it must be.\"\n\n93. The propositions presenting what Moore 'knows' are all of such a kind that it is difficult to imagine why anyone should believe the contrary. E.g. the proposition that Moore has spent his whole life in close proximity to the earth. - Once more I can speak of myself here instead of speaking of Moore. What could induce me to believe the opposite? Either a memory, or having been told. - Everything that I have seen or heard gives me the conviction that no man has ever been far from the earth. Nothing in my picture of the world speaks in favour of the opposite.\n\n94. But I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its correctness; nor do I have it because I am satisfied of its correctness. No: it is the inherited background against which I distinguish between true and false.\n\n95. The propositions describing this world-picture might be part of a kind of mythology. And their role is like that of rules of a game; and the game can be learned purely practically, without learning any explicit rules.\n\n96. It might be imagined that some propositions, of the form of empirical propositions, were hardened and functioned as channels for such empirical propositions as were not hardened but fluid; and that this relation altered with time, in that fluid propositions hardened, and hard ones became fluid.\n\n97. The mythology may change back into a state of flux, the river-bed of thoughts may shift. But I distinguish between the movement of the waters on the river-bed and the shift of the bed itself; though there is not a sharp division of the one from the other.\n\n98. But if someone were to say \"So logic too is an empirical science\" he would be wrong. Yet this is right: the same proposition may get treated at one time as something to test by experience, at another as a rule of testing.\n\n99. And the bank of that river consists partly of hard rock, subject to no alteration or only to an imperceptible one, partly of sand, which now in one place now in another gets washed away, or deposited.\n\n100. The truths which Moore says he knows, are such as, roughly speaking, all of us know, if he knows them.\n\n101. Such a proposition might be e.g. \"My body has never disappeared and reappeared again after an interval.\"\n\n102. Might I not believe that once, without knowing it, perhaps is a state of unconsciousness, I was taken far away from the earth - that other people even know this, but do not mention it to me? But this would not fit into the rest of my convictions at all. Not that I could describe the system of these convictions. Yet my convictions do form a system, a structure.\n\n105. All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system. And this system is not a more or less arbitrary and doubtful point of departure for all our arguments: no, it belongs to the essence of what we call an argument. The system is not so much the point of departure, as the element in which arguments have their life.\n\n106. Suppose some adult had told a child that he had been on the moon. The child tells me the story, and I say it was only a joke, the man hadn't been on the moon; no one has ever been on the moon; the moon is a long way off and it is impossible to climb up there or fly there. - If now the child insists, saying perhaps there is a way of getting there which I don't know, etc. what reply could I make to him? What reply could I make to the adults of a tribe who believe that people sometimes go to the moon (perhaps that is how they interpret their dreams), and who indeed grant that there are no ordinary means of climbing up to it or flying there? - But a child will not ordinarily stick to such a belief and will soon be convinced by what we tell him seriously.\n\n107. Isn't this altogether like the way one can instruct a child to believe in a God, or that none exists, and it will accordingly be able to produce apparently telling grounds for the one or the other?\n\n108. \"But is there then no objective truth? Isn't it true, or false, that someone has been on the moon?\" â¦â¦â¦â¦.\n\n109. \"An empirical proposition can be tested\" (we say). But how? and through what? â¦â¦â¦â¦\n\n110. What counts as its test? - \"But is this an adequate test? â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦\n\n111. \"I know that I have never been on the moon.\" â¦â¦â¦..\n\nI want to say: my not having been on the moon is as sure a thing for me as any grounds I could give for it.\n\n114. If you are not certain of any fact, you cannot be certain of the meaning of your words either.\n\n115. If you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty.\n\n121. Can one say: \"Where there is no doubt there is no knowledge either\"?\n\n122. Doesn't one need grounds for doubt?\n\n124. I want to say: We use judgments as principles of judgment.\n\n141. When we first begin to believe anything, what we believe is not a single proposition, it is a whole system of propositions. (Light dawns gradually over the whole.)\n\n142. It is not single axioms that strike me as obvious, it is a system in which consequences and premises give one another mutual support.\n\n156. In order to make a mistake, a man must already judge in conformity with mankind.\n\n160. The child learns by believing the adult. Doubt comes after belief.\n\n174. I act with complete certainty. But this certainty is my own.\n\n189. At some point one has to pass from explanation to mere description.\n\n191. Well, if everything speaks for an hypothesis and nothing against it - is it then certainly true? One may designate it as such. - But does it certainly agree with reality, with the facts? - With this question you are already going round in a circle.\n\n192. To be sure there is justification; but justification comes to an end. 193. What does this mean: the truth of a proposition is a certain?\n\n194. With the word \"certain\" we express complete conviction, the total absence of doubt, and thereby we seek to convince other people. That is subjective certainty.\n\nBut when is something objectively certain? When a mistake is not possible. But what kind of possibility is that? Mustn't mistake be logically excluded?\n\n200. Really \"The proposition is either true or false\" only means that it must be possible to decide for or against it. But this does not say what the ground for such a decision is like.\n\n201. Suppose someone were to ask: \"Is it really right for us to rely on the evidence of our memory (or our senses) as we do?\"\n\n202. Moore's certain propositions almost declare that we have a right to rely upon this evidence.\n\n203. [Everything that we regard as evidence indicates that the earth already existed long before my birth. The contrary hypothesis has nothing to confirm it at all.\n\nIf everything speaks for an hypothesis and nothing against it, is it objectively certain? One can call it that. But does it necessarily agree with the world of facts? At the very best it shows us what \"agreement\" means. We find it difficult to imagine it to be false, but also difficult to make use of.] {crossed-out in MS}\n\nWhat does this agreement consist in, if not in the fact that what is evidence in these language games speaks for our proposition? (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus)\n\n204. Giving grounds, however, justifying the evidence, comes to an end; - but the end is not certain propositions' striking us immediately as true, i.e. it is not a kind of seeing on our part; it is our acting, which lies at the bottom of the language-game.\n\n205. If the true is what is grounded, then the ground is not true, not yet false.\n\n206. If someone asked us \"but is that true?\" we might say \"yes\" to him; and if he demanded grounds we might say \"I can't give you any grounds, but if you learn more you too will think the same.\"\n\nIf this didn't come about, that would mean that he couldn't for example learn history.\n\n207. \"Strange coincidence, that every man whose skull has been opened had a brain!\"\n\n220. The reasonable man does not have certain doubts.\n\n223. For mightn't I be crazy and not doubting what I absolutely ought to doubt?\n\n224. \"I know that it never happened, for if it had happened I could not possibly have forgotten it.\"\n\nBut, supposing it did happen, then it just would have been the case that you had forgotten it. And how do you know that you could not possibly have forgotten it? Isn't that just from earlier experience?\n\n243. One says \"I know\" when one is ready to give compelling grounds. \"I know\" relates to a possibility of demonstrating the truth. Whether someone knows something can come to light, assuming that he is convinced of it.\n\nBut if what he believes is of such a kind that the grounds that he can give are no surer than his assertion, then he cannot say that he knows what he believes.\n\n263. The schoolboy believes his teachers and his schoolbooks.\n\n272. I know = I am familiar with it as a certainty.\n\n273. But when does one say of something that it is certain?\n\nFor there can be dispute whether something is certain; I mean, when something is objectively certain.\n\nThere are countless general empirical propositions that count as certain for us.\n\n274. One such is that if someone's arm is cut off it will not grow again. Another, if someone's head is cut off he is dead and will never live again.\n\nExperience can be said to teach us these propositions. However, it does not teach us them in isolation: rather, it teaches us a host of interdependent propositions. If they were isolated I might perhaps doubt them, for I have no experience relating to them.\n\n275. If experience is the ground of our certainty, then naturally it is past experience.\n\nAnd it isn't for example just my experience, but other's people's, that I get knowledge from.\n\nNow one might say that it is experience again that leads us to give credence to others. But what experience makes me believe that the anatomy and physiology books don't contain what is false? Though it is true that this trust is backed up by my own experience.\n\n282. I cannot say that I have good grounds for the opinion that cats do not grow on trees or that I had a father and a mother.\n\nIf someone has doubts about it - how is that supposed to have come about? By his never, from the beginning, having believed that he had parents? But then, is that conceivable, unless he has been taught it?\n\n283. For how can a child immediately doubt what it is taught? That could mean only that he was incapable of learning certain language games.\n\n284. People have killed animals since the earliest times, used the fur, bones etc.etc. for various purposes; they have counted definitely on finding similar parts in any similar beast.\n\nThey have always learnt from experience; and we can see from their actions that they believe certain things definitely, whether they express this belief or not. By this I naturally do not want to say that men should behave like this, but only that they do behave like this.\n\n285. If someone is looking for something and perhaps roots around in a certain place, he shows that he believes that what he is looking for is there.\n\n286. What we believe depends on what we learn. We all believe that it isn't possible to get to the moon; but there might be people who believe that that is possible and that it sometimes happens. We say: these people do not know a lot that we know. And, let them be never so sure of their belief - they are wrong and we know it.\n\nIf we compare our system of knowledge with theirs then theirs is evidently the poorer one by far.\n\n287. The squirrel does not infer by induction that it is going to need stores next winter as well. And no more do we need a law of induction to justify our actions or our predictions.\n\n288. I know, not just that the earth existed long before my birth, but also that it is a large body, that this has been established, that I and the rest of mankind have forebears, that there are books about all this, that such books don't lie, etc. etc. etc. And I know all this? I believe it. This body of knowledge has been handed on to me and I have no grounds for doubting it, but, on the contrary, all sorts of confirmation.\n\nAnd why shouldn't I say that I know all this? Isn't that what one does say?\n\nBut not only I know, or believe, all that, but the others do too. Or rather, I believe that they believe it.\n\n289. I am firmly convinced that others believe, believe they know, that all that is in fact so.\n\n290. I myself wrote in my book that children learn to understand a word in such and such a way. Do I know that, or do I believe it? Why in such a case do I write not \"I believe etc.\" but simply the indicative sentence?\n\n291. We know that the earth is round. We have definitively ascertained that it is round.\n\nWe shall stick to this opinion, unless our whole way of seeing nature changes. \"How do you know that?\" - I believe it.\n\n292. Further experiments cannot give the lie to our earlier ones, at most they may change our whole way of looking at things.\n\n293. Similarly with the sentence \"water boils at 100 C\".\n\n294. This is how we acquire conviction, this is called \"being rightly convinced\".\n\n295. So hasn't one, in this sense, a proof of the proposition? But that the same thing has happened again is not a proof of it; though we do say that it gives us a right to assume it.\n\n296. This is what we call an \"empirical foundation\" for our assumptions.\n\n297. For we learn, not just that such and such experiments had those and those results, but also the conclusion which is drawn. And of course there is nothing wrong in our doing so. For this inferred proposition is an instrument for a definitive use.\n\n298. 'We are quite sure of it' does not mean just that every single person is certain of it, but that we belong to a community which is bound together by science and education.\n\n299. We are satisfied that the earth is round. [In English]\n\n3/10/51-4/29/51\n\n300. Not all corrections of our views are on the same level.\n\n308. 'Knowledge' and 'certainty' belong to different categories. They are not two 'mental states' like, say 'surmising' and 'being sure'. (Here I assume that it is meaningful for me to say \"I know what (e.g.) the word 'doubt' means\" and that this sentence indicates that the word \"doubt\" has a logical role.) What interests us now is not being sure but knowledge. That is, we are interested in the fact that about certain empirical propositions no doubt can exist if making judgments is to be possible at all. Or again: I am inclined to believe that not everything that has the form of an empirical proposition is one.\n\n314. Imagine that the schoolboy really did ask \"and is there a table there even when I turn around, and even when no one is there to see it?\" Is the teacher to reassure him - and say \"of course there is!\"?\n\nPerhaps the teacher will get a bit impatient, but think that the boy will grow out of asking such questions.\n\n315. That is to say, the teacher will feel that this is not really a legitimate question at all.\n\nAnd it would be just the same if the pupil cast doubt on the uniformity of nature, that is to say on the justification of inductive arguments. - The teacher would feel that this was only holding them up, that this way the pupil would only get stuck and make no progress. - And he would be right. It would be as if someone were looking for some object in a room; he opens a drawer and doesn't see it there; then he closes it again, waits, and opens it once more to see if perhaps it isn't there now, and keeps on like that. He has not learned to look for things. And in the same way this pupil has not learned how to ask questions. He has not learned the game that we are trying to teach him.\n\n316. And isn't it the same as if the pupil were to hold up his history lesson with doubts as to whether the earth really...?\n\n317. This doubt isn't one of the doubts in our game. (But not as if we chose this game!)\n\n318. 'The question doesn't arise at all.' Its answer would characterize a method. But there is no sharp boundary between methodological propositions and propositions within a method.\n\n319. But wouldn't one have to say then, that there is no sharp boundary between propositions of logic and empirical propositions? The lack of sharpness is that of the boundary between rule and empirical proposition.\n\n320. Here one must, I believe, remember that the concept 'proposition' itself is not a sharp one.\n\n321. Isn't what I am saying: any empirical proposition can be transformed into a postulate - and then becomes a norm of description. But I am suspicious even of this. The sentence is too general. One almost wants to say \"any empirical proposition can, theoretically, be transformed...\", but what does \"theoretically\" mean here? It sounds all to reminiscent of the Tractatus.\n\n322. What if the pupil refused to believe that this mountain had been there beyond human memory?\n\nWe should say that he had no grounds for this suspicion.\n\n323. So rational suspicion must have grounds?\n\nWe might also say: \"the reasonable man believes this\".\n\n324. Thus we should not call anybody reasonable who believed something in despite of scientific evidence.\n\n325. When we say that we know that such and such..., we mean that any reasonable person in our position would also know it, that it would be a piece of unreason to doubt it. Thus Moore wants to say not merely that he knows that he etc. etc., but also that anyone endowed with reason in his position would know it just the same.\n\n326. But who says what it is reasonable to believe in this situation?\n\n327. So it might be said: \"The reasonable man believes: that the earth has been there since long before his birth, that his life has been spent on the surface of the earth, or near it, that he has never, for example, been on the moon, that he has a nervous system and various innards like all other people, etc., etc.\"\n\n329. 'If he calls that in doubt - whatever \"doubt\" means here - he will never learn this game'.\n\n330. So here the sentence \"I know...\" expresses the readiness to believe certain things.\n\n331. If we ever do act with certainty on the strength of belief, should we wonder that there is much we cannot doubt?\n\n332. Imagine that someone were to say, ..... \"I don't know if I have ever been on the moon; I don't remember ever having been there\"....\n\n333. I ask someone \"Have you ever been in China?\" He replies \"I don't know\". ....\n\n334. That is to say: only in such-and-such circumstances does a reasonable person doubt that.\n\n335. The procedure in a court of law rests on the fact that circumstances give statements a certain probability. The statement that, for example, someone came into the world without parents wouldn't ever be taken into consideration there.\n\n336. But what men consider reasonable or unreasonable alters. At certain periods men find reasonable what at other periods they found unreasonable. And vice-versa.\n\nBut is there no objective character here?\n\nVery intelligent and well-educated people believe in the story of creation in the Bible, while others hold it as proven false, and the grounds of the latter are well known to the former.\n\n341. That is to say, the questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on which those turn.\n\n342. That is to say, it belongs to the logic of our scientific investigations that certain things are in deed not doubted.\n\n343. But it isn't that the situation is like this: We just can't investigate everything, and for that reason we are forced to rest content with assumption. If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put.\n\n344. My life consists in my being content to accept many things.\n\n345. If I ask someone \"what colour do you see at the moment?\", in order, that is, to learn what colour is there at the moment, I cannot at the same time question whether the person I ask understands English, whether he wants to take me in, whether my own memory is not leaving me in the lurch as to the names of colours, and so on.\n\n346. When I am trying to mate someone in chess, I cannot have doubts about the pieces perhaps changing places of themselves and my memory simultaneously playing tricks on me so that I don't notice.\n\n347. \"I know that that's a tree.\" Why does it strike me as if I did not understand the sentence? though it is after all an extremely simple sentence of the most ordinary kind? It is as if I could not focus my mind on any meaning. Simply because I don't look for the focus where the meaning is. As soon as I think of an everyday use of the sentence instead of a philosophical one, its meaning becomes clear and ordinary.\n\n348. Just as the words \"I am here\" have a meaning only in certain contexts, and not when I say them to someone who is sitting in front of me and sees me clearly, - and not because they are superfluous, but because their meaning is not determined by the situation, yet stands in need of such determination.\n\n349. \"I know that that's a tree\" - this may mean all sorts of things: I look at a plant that I take for a young beech and that someone else thinks is a black-currant. He says \"that's a shrub\"; I say it is a tree. - We see something in the mist which one of us takes for a man, and the other says \"I know that that's a tree\". Someone wants to test my eyes etc.etc. - etc.etc. Each time the 'that' which I declare to be a tree is of a different kind.\n\nBut what when we express ourselves more precisely? For example: \"I know that that thing there is a tree, I can see it quite clearly.\" - Let us even suppose I had made this remark in the context of a conversation (so that it was relevant when I made it); and now, out of all context, I repeat it while looking at the tree, and I add \"I mean these words as I did five minutes ago\". If I added, for example, that I had been thinking of my bad eyes again and it was a kind of sigh, then there would be nothing puzzling about the remark.\n\nFor how a sentence is meant can be expressed by an expansion of it and may therefore be made part of it.\n\n350. \"I know that that's a tree\" is something a philosopher might say to demonstrate to himself or to someone else that he knows something that is not a mathematical or logical truth.....\n\n351. Isn't the question \"have these words a meaning?\" similar to \"Is that a tool?\" asked as one produces, say, a hammer? I say \"Yes, it's a hammer.\" But what if the thing that any of us would take for a hammer were somewhere else a missile, for example, or a conductor's baton? Now make the application yourself.\n\n352. If someone says, \"I know that that's a tree\" I may answer: \"Yes, that is a sentence. An English sentence. And what is it supposed to be doing?\" Suppose he replies: \"I just wanted to remind myself that I know thing like that\"?\n\n353. But suppose he said \"I want to make a logical observation\"? - If a forester goes into a wood with his men and says \"This tree has got to be cut down, and this one and this one\" -- what if he then observes \"I know that that's a tree\"? - But might not I say of the forester \"He knows that that's a tree - he doesn't examine it, or order his men to examine it\"?\n\n354. Doubting and non-doubting behavior. There is the first only if there is the second.\n\n355. A mad-doctor (perhaps) might ask me \"Do you know what that is?\" and I might reply \"I know that it's a chair; I recognize it, it's always been in my room\". He says this, possibly, to test not my eyes but my ability to recognize things, to know their names and their functions. What is in question here is a kind of knowing one's way about. Now it would be wrong for me to say \"I believe that it's a chair\" because that would express my readiness for my statement to be tested. While \"I know that it...\" implies bewilderment if what I said was not confirmed.\n\n356. My \"mental state\", the \"knowing\", gives me no guarantee of what will happen. But it consists in this, that I should not understand where a doubt could get a foothold nor where a further test was possible.\n\n357. One might say: \" 'I know' expresses comfortable certainty, not the certainty that is still struggling.\"\n\n360. I know that this is my foot. I could not accept any experience as proof to the contrary. - That may be an exclamation; but what follows from it? At least that I shall act with a certainty that knows no doubt, in accordance with my belief.\n\n361. But I might also say: It has been revealed to me by God that it is so. God has taught me that this is my foot. And therefore if anything happened that seemed to conflict with this knowledge I should have to regard that as deception.\n\n362. But doesn't it come out here that knowledge is related to a a decision?\n\n366. Suppose it were forbidden to say \"I know\" and only allowed to say \"I believe I know\"?\n\n367. ..... As a result a mistake becomes something forbidden.\n\n369. If I wanted to doubt whether this was my hand, how could I avoid doubting whether the word \"hand\" has any meaning? So that is something I seem to know after all.\n\n370. But more correctly: The fact that I use the word \"hand\" and all the other words in my sentence without a second thought, indeed that I should stand before the abyss if I wanted so much as to try doubting their meanings - shows that absence of doubt belongs to the essence of the language-game, that the question \"How do I know...\" drags out the language-game, or else does away with it.\n\n373. Why is it supposed to be possible to have grounds for believing something if it isn't possible to be certain?\n\n374. We teach a child \"that is your hand\", not \"that is perhaps (or \"probably\") your hand\". That is how a child learns the innumerable language-games that are concerned with his hand. An investigation or question, 'whether this is really a hand' never occurs to him. Nor, on the other hand, does he learn that he knows that this is a hand.\n\n375. Here one must realize that complete absence of doubt at some point, even where we would say that 'legitimate' doubt can exist, need not falsify a language-game. For there is also something like another arithmetic.\n\nI believe that this admission must underlie any understanding of logic.\n\n376. I may claim with passion that I know that this (for example) is my foot.\n\n378. Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement.\n\n379. I say with passion \"I know that this is a foot\" - but what does it mean?\n\n380. I might go on: \"Nothing in the world will convince me of the opposite!\" For me this fact is at the bottom of all knowledge. I shall give up other things but not this.\n\n381. This \"Nothing in the world\" is obviously an attitude which one hasn't got towards everything one believes or is certain of.\n\n382. That is not to say that nothing in the world will in fact be able to convince me of anything else.\n\n383. The argument \"I may be dreaming\" is senseless for this reason: if I am dreaming, this remark is being dreamed as well - and indeed it is also being dreamed that these words have any meaning.\n\n384. Now what kind of sentence is \"Nothing in the world...\"?\n\n385. It has the form of a prediction, but of course it is not one that is based on experience.\n\n386. Anyone who says, with Moore, that he knows that so and so... - gives the degree of certainty that something has for him. And it is important that this degree has a maximum value.\n\n387. Someone might ask me: \"How certain are you that that is a tree over there; that you have money in your pocket; that that is your foot?\" And the answer in one case might be \"not certain\", in another \"as good as certain\", in the third \"I can't doubt it\". And these answers would make sense even without any grounds. I should not need for example, to say: \"I can't be certain whether that is a tree because my eyes aren't sharp enough.\" I want to say: it made sense for Moore to say \"I know that that is a tree\", if he meant something quite particular by it.\n\n388. Every one of us often uses such a sentence, and there is no question but that it makes sense.\n\nBut does that mean it yields any philosophical conclusion? Is it more of a proof of the existence of external things, that I know that this is a hand, than that I don't know whether that is gold or brass?\n\n389. Moore wanted to give an example to show that one really can know propositions about physical objects. - If there were a dispute whether one could have a pain in such and such a part of the body, then someone who just then had a pain in that spot might say: \"I assure you, I have a pain there now.\" But it would sound odd if Moore had said: \"I assure you, I know that's a tree.\" A personal experience simply has no interest for us here.\n\n390. All that is important is that it makes sense to say that one knows such a thing; and consequently the assurance that one does know it can't accomplish anything here.\n\n401. I want to say: propositions of the form of empirical propositions, and not only propositions of logic, form the foundation of all operating with thoughts (with language). - This observation is not of the form \"I know...\". \"I know...\" states what I know, and that is not of logical interest.\n\n403. To say of man, in Moore's sense, that he knows something; that what he says is therefore unconditionally the truth, seems wrong to me. - It is the truth only inasmuch as it is an unmoving foundation of his language-games.\n\n404. I want to say: it's not that on some points men know the truth with perfect certainty. No: perfect certainty is only a matter of their attitude.\n\n405. But of course there is still a mistake even here.\n\n406. What I am aiming at is also found in the difference between the casual observation \"I know that that's a...\", as it might be used in ordinary life, and the same utterance when a philosopher makes it.\n\n408. For if someone says he knows such-and-such, and this is part of his philosophy - then his philosophy is false if he has slipped up in this statement.\n\n410. Our knowledge forms an enormous system. And only within this system has a particular bit the value we give it.\n\n411. If I say \"we assume that the earth has existed for many years past\" (or something similar), then of course it sounds strange that we should assume such a thing. But in the entire system of our language-games it belongs to the foundations. The assumption, one might say, forms the basis of action, and therefore, naturally, of thought.\n\n414. ....When I say \"how do I know?\" I do not mean that I have the least doubt of it. What we have here is a foundation for all my action. But it seems to me that it is wrongly expressed by the words \"I know\".\n\n415. And in fact, isn't the use of the word \"know\" as a preeminently philosophical word altogether wrong? If \"know\" has this interest, why not \"being certain\"? Apparently because it would be too subjective. But isn't \"know\" just as subjective? Isn't one misled simply by the grammatical peculiarity that \"p\" follows from \"I know p\"?\n\n\"I believe I know\" would not need to express a lesser degree of certainty. - True, but one isn't trying to express even the greatest subjective certainty, but rather that certain propositions seem to underlie all questions and all thinking.\n\n420. Even a proposition like this one, that I am now living in England, has these two sides: it is not a mistake - but on the other hand, what do I know of England? Can't my judgment go all to pieces? Would it not be possible that people came to my room and all declared the opposite? - even gave me 'proofs' of it, so that I suddenly stood there like a madman alone among people who were all normal, or a normal person alone among madmen? Might I not then suffer doubts about what at present seems at the furthest remove from doubt?\n\n421. I am in England. - Everything around me tells me so; wherever and however I let my thoughts turn, they confirm this for me at once. - But might I not be shaken if things such as I don't dream of at present were to happen?\n\n422. So I am trying to say something that sounds like pragmatism.\n\nHere I am being thwarted by a kind of Weltanschauung.\n\n425. .... It would be completely misleading to say: \"I believe my name is L.W.\" .... I cannot be making a mistake about it. But that does not mean that I am infallible about it.\n\n426. But how can we show someone that we know truths, not only about sense-data but also about things? For after all it can't be enough for someone to assure us that he knows this.\n\nWell, what must our starting point be if we are to show this?\n\n429. What reason have I, now, when I cannot see my toes, to assume that I have five toes on each foot?\n\nIs it right to say that my reason is that previous experience has always taught me so?\n\nThat previous experience may very well be the cause of my present certitude; but is it its ground?\n\n432. The utterance \"I know...\" can only have its meaning in connection with the other evidence of my 'knowing'.\n\n438. It would not be enough to assure someone that I know what is going on at a certain place - without giving him grounds that satisfy him that I am in a position to know.\n\n439. Even the statement \"I know that behind this door there is a landing and the stairway down to the ground floor\" only sounds so convincing because everyone takes it for granted that I know it.\n\n440. There is something universal here; not just something personal.\n\n441. In a court of law the mere assurance \"I know...\" on the part of a witness would convince no one. It must be shown that he was in a position to know.\n\nEven the assurance \"I know that that's a hand\", said while someone looked at his own hand, would not be credible unless we knew the circumstances in which it was said. And if we do know them, it seems to be an assurance that the person speaking is normal in this respect.\n\n442. For may it not happen that I imagine myself to know something?\n\n446. But why am I so certain that this is my hand? Doesn't the whole language-game rest on this kind of certainty?\n\nOr: isn't this 'certainty' (already) presupposed in the language-game? Namely by virtue of the fact that one is not playing the game, or is playing it wrong, if one does not recognize objects with certainty.\n\n447. Compare with this 12x12=144. Here too we don't say \"perhaps\". For, in so far as this proposition rests on our not miscounting or miscalculating and on our senses not deceiving us as we calculate, both propositions, the arithmetical one and the physical one, are on the same level. I want to say: The physical game is just as certain as the arithmetical. But this can be misunderstood. My remark is a logical and not a psychological one.\n\n448. I want to say: If one doesn't marvel at the fact that the propositions of arithmetic (e.g. the multiplication tables) are 'absolutely certain', then why should one be astonished that the proposition \"This is my hand\" is so equally?\n\n449. Something must be taught us as a foundation.\n\n450. ...... A doubt that doubted everything would not be a doubt.\n\n454. There are cases where doubt is unreasonable, but others where it seems logically impossible.\n\nAnd there seems to be no clear boundary between them.\n\n455. Every language-game is based on words 'and objects' being recognized again. We learn with the same inexorability that is a chair as that 2x2=4.\n\n456. If, therefore, I doubt or am uncertain about this being my hand (in whatever sense), why not in that case about the meaning of these words as well?\n\n457. Do I want to say, then, that certainty resides in the nature of the language-game?\n\n458. One doubts on specific grounds. The question is this: how is doubt introduced into the language-game?\n\n459. If the shopkeeper wanted to investigate each of his apples without any reason, for the sake of being certain about everything, why doesn't he have to investigate the investigation? ......\n\n462. Why doesn't Moore produce as one of the things that he knows, for example, that is such-andsuch a part of England there is a village called so-and-so? In other words: why doesn't he mention a fact that is known to him and not to every one of us?\n\n463. This is certainly true, that the information \"That is a tree\", when no one could doubt it, might be a kind of joke and as such have meaning.\n\n467. I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; he says again and again \"I know that that's a tree\", pointing to a tree that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell him: \"This fellow isn't insane. We are only doing philosophy.\"\n\n469. In the middle of a conversation, someone says to me out of the blue: \"I wish you luck.\" I am astonished; but later I realize that these words connect up with his thoughts about me. And now they do not strike me as meaningless any more.\n\n475. I want to regard man here as an animal; as a primitive being to which one grants instinct but not ratiocination. As a creature in a primitive state. Any logic good enough for a primitive means of communication needs no apology from us. Language did not emerge from some kind of ratiocination [Raisonnement].\n\n476. Children do not learn that books exist, that armchairs exist, etc.,etc. - they learn to fetch books, sit in armchairs, etc.,etc.\n\nLater, questions about the existence of things do of course arise, ....\n\nHow did one learn the method for determining whether something exists or not?\n\n478. Does a child believe that milk exists? Or does it know that milk exists? Does a cat know that a mouse exists?\n\n479. Are we to say that the knowledge that there are physical objects comes very early or very late?\n\n480. A child that is learning to use the word \"tree\". One stands with it in front of a tree and says \"Lovely tree!\" Clearly no doubt as to the tree's existence comes into the language-game. But can the child be said to know: 'that a tree exists'? Admittedly it's true that 'knowing something' doesn't involve thinking about it - but mustn't anyone who knows something be capable of doubt? And doubting means thinking.\n\n481. When one hears Moore say \"I know that that's a tree\", one suddenly understands those who think that that has by no means been settled. The matter strikes one all at once as being unclear and blurred. It is as if Moore had put it in the wrong light.\n\nIt is as if I were to see a painting (say a painted stage-set) and recognize what it represents from a long way off at once and without the slightest doubt. But now I step nearer: and then I see a lot of patches of different colours, which are all highly ambiguous and do not provide any certainty whatever.\n\n482. It is as if \"I know\" did not tolerate a metaphysical emphasis.\n\n483. The correct use of the expression \"I know\". Someone with bad sight asks me: \"do you believe that the thing we can see there is a tree?\" I reply \"I know it is; I can see it clearly and am familiar with it.\" - A: \"Isn't N.N. at home?\" - I: \"I believe he is.\" - A: \"Was he at home yesterday?\" - I; \"Yesterday he was - I know he was; I spoke to him.\" - A: \"Do you know or only believe that this part of the house is built on later than the rest?\" - I: \"I know it is; I got it from so and so.\"\n\n484. In these cases, then, one says \"I know\" and mentions how one knows, or at least one can do so.\n\n487. What is the proof that I know something? Most certainly not my saying I know it.\n\n488. And so, when writers enumerate all the things they know, that proves nothing whatever. So the possibility of knowledge about physical objects cannot be proved by the protestations of those who believe that they have such knowledge.\n\n493. So is this it: I must recognize certain authorities in order to make judgements at all?\n\n495. One might simply say \"O, rubbish!\" to someone who wanted to make objections to the propositions that are beyond doubt. That is, not reply to him but admonish him.\n\n496. This is a similar case to that of showing that it has no meaning to say that a game has always been played wrong.\n\n498. The queer thing is that even though I find it quite correct for someone to say \"Rubbish!\" and so brush aside the attempt to confuse him with doubts at bedrock, - nevertheless, I hold it to be incorrect if he seeks to defend himself (using, e.g., the words \"I know\").\n\n499. I might also put it like this: the 'law of induction' can no more be grounded than certain particular propositions concerning the material of experience.\n\n500. But it would also strike me as nonsense to say \"I know that the law of induction is true\".\n\nImagine such a statement made in a court of law! It would be more correct to say \"I believe in the law of...\" where 'believe' has nothing to do with surmising.\n\n501. Am I not getting closer and closer to saying that in the end logic cannot be described? You must look at the practice of language, then you will see it.\n\n503. I look at an object and say \"That is a tree\", or \"I know that that's a tree\". - Now if I go nearer and it turns out that it isn't, I may say \"It wasn't a tree at all\" or alternatively I say \"It was a tree but now it isn't any longer\". But if all the others contradicted me, and said it never had been a tree, and if all the other evidences spoke against me - what good would it do to me to stick to my \"I know\"?\n\n504. Whether I know something depends on whether the evidence backs me up or contradicts me.\n\nFor to say one knows one has a pain means nothing.\n\n505. It is always by favour of Nature that one knows something.\n\n509. I really want to say that a language-game is only possible if one trusts something (I did not say \"can trust something\").\n\n510. If I say \"Of course I know that that's a towel\" I am making an utterance. I have no thought of a verification. For me it is an immediate utterance.\n\nI don't think of past or future. (And of course it's the same for Moore, too.)\n\nIt is just like directly taking hold of something, as I take hold of my towel without having doubts.\n\n511. And yet this direct taking-hold corresponds to a sureness, not to a knowing.\n\nBut don't I take hold of a thing's name like that, too?\n\n519. Admittedly, if you are obeying the order \"Bring me a book\", you may have to check whether the thing you see over there really is a book, but then you do at least know what people mean by a \"book\"; and if you don't you can look it up, - but then you must know what some other word means. And the fact that a word means such-and-such, is used in such-and-such a way, is in turn an empirical fact, like the fact that what you see over there is a book. Therefore, in order for you to be able to carry out an order there must be some empirical fact about which you are not in doubt. Doubt itself rests only on what is beyond doubt. But since a language-game is something that consists in the recurrent procedures of the game in time, it seems impossible to say in any individual case that such-and-such must be beyond doubt if there is to be a language-game - though it is right enough to say that as a rule some empirical judgment or other must be beyond doubt.\n\n520. Moore has every right to say he knows there's a tree there in front of him. Naturally he may be wrong. (For it is not the same as with the utterance \"I believe there is a tree there\".) But whether he is right or wrong in this case is of no philosophical importance. If Moore is attacking those who say that one cannot really know such a thing, he can't do it by assuring them that he knows this and that. For one need not believe him. If his opponents had asserted that one could not believe this and that, then he could have replied: \"I believe it\".\n\n521. Moore's mistake lies in this - countering the assertion that one cannot know that, by saying \"I do know it\".\n\n532. So when Moore sat in front of a tree and said \"I know that that's a tree\", he was simply stating the truth about this state at the time.\n\n533. Well, if it was correct to describe his state out of context, then it was just as correct to utter the words \"that's a tree\" out of context.\n\n550. If someone believes something, we needn't always be able to answer the question 'why he believes it'; but if he knows something, then the question \"how does he know?\" must be capable of being answered.\n\n551. And if one does answer this question, one must do so according to generally accepted axioms. This is how something of this sort may be known.\n\n552. Do I know that I am now sitting in a chair? - Don't I know it?!In the present circumstances no one is going to say that I know this; but no more will he say, for example, that I am conscious. Nor will one normally say that of the passers-by in the street.\n\nBut now, even if one doesn't say it, does that make it untrue??\n\n553. It is queer: if I say, without any special occasion, \"I know\" - for example, \"I know that I am now sitting in a chair\", this statement seems to me unjustified and presumptuous. But if I make the same statement where there is some need for it, then, although I am not a jot more certain of its truth, it seems to me to be perfectly justified and everyday.\n\n554. In its language-game it is not presumptuous. There, it has no higher position than, simply, the human language-game. For there it has its restricted application. But as soon as I say this sentence outside its context, it appears in a false light. For then it is as if I wanted to insist that there are things that I know. God himself can't say anything to me about them.\n\n555. We say we know that water boils when it is put over a fire. How do we know? Experience has taught us. - I say \"I know that I had breakfeast this morning\"; experience hasn't taught me that. One also says \"I know that he is in pain\". The language-game is different every time, we are sure every time, and people will agree with us that we are in a position to know every time. And that is why the propositions of physics are found in textbooks for everyone.\n\nIf someone says he know something, it must be something that, by general consent, he is in a position to know.\n\n558. We say we know that water boils and does not freeze under such-and-such circumstances. Is it conceivable that we are wrong? Wouldn't a mistake topple all judgment with it? More: what could stand if that were to fall? Might someone discover something that made us say \"It was a mistake\"?\n\nWhatever may happen in the future, however water may behave in the future, - we know that up to now it has behaved thus in innumerable instances.\n\nThis fact is fused into the foundations of our language-game.\n\n559. You must bear in mind that the language-game is so to say something unpredictable. I mean: it is not based on grounds. It is not reasonable (or unreasonable).\n\nIt is there - like our life.\n\n560. And the concept of knowing is coupled with that of the language-game.\n\n579. It is part of the language-game with people's names that everyone knows his name with the greatest certainty.\n\n653. If the proposition 12x12=144 is exempt from doubt, then so too must non-mathematical propositions be.\n\n654. But against this there are plenty of objections. - In the first place there is the fact that \"12x12 etc.\" is a mathematical proposition, and from this one may infer that only mathematical propositions are in this situation. And if this inference is not justified, then there ought to be a proposition that is just as certain, and deals with the process of this calculation, but isn't itself mathematical. I am thinking of such a proposition as: \"The multiplication '12x12', when carried out by people who know how to calculate, will in the great majority of cases give the result '144'.\" Nobody will contest this proposition, and naturally it is not a mathematical one. But has it got the certainty of the mathematical proposition?\n\n4/27/51 (This is the last entry written two days before Wittgenstein died on April 29th, 1951)\n\n670. We might speak of fundamental principles of human enquiry.\n\n671. I fly from here to a part of the world where the people have only indefinite information, or none at all, about the possibility of flying. I tell them I have just flown there from... They ask me if I might be mistaken. - They have obviously a false impression of how the thing happens. (If I wepacked up in a box it would be possible for me to be mistaken about the way I had travelled.) If I simply tell them that I can't be mistaken, that won't perhaps convince them; but it will if I describe the actual procedure to them. Then they will certainly not bring the possibility of a mistake into the question. But for all that - even if they trust me - they might believe I had been dreaming or that magic had made me imagine it.\n\n672. \"If I don't trust this evidence why should I trust any evidence?\"\n\n673. Is it not difficult to distinguish between the cases in which I cannot and those in which I can hardly be mistaken? Is it always clear to which kind a case belongs? I believe not.\n\n674. There are, however, certain types of case in which I rightly say I cannot be making a mistake, and Moore has given a few examples of such cases.\n\nI can enumerate various typical cases, but not give any common characteristic. (N.N. cannot be mistaken about his flown from America to England a few days ago. Only if he is mad can he take anything else to be possible.)\n\n675. If someone believes that he has flown from America to England in the last few days, then, I believe, he cannot be making a mistake.\n\nAnd just the same if someone says that he is at this moment sitting at a table and writing.\n\n676. \"But even if in such cases I can't be mistaken, isn't it possible that I am drugged?\" If I am and if the drug has taken away my consciousness, then I am not now really talking and thinking. I cannot seriously suppose that I am at this moment dreaming. Someone who, dreaming, says \"I am dreaming\", even if he speaks audibly in doing so, is no more right than if he said in his dream \"it is raining\", while it was in fact raining. Even if his dream were actually connected with the noise of the rain."
