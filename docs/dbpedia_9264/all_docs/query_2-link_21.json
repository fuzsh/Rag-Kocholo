        "text": "Discussion\n\nStroke occurrence in Alberta is on the rise, likely due to a growing population (from 2.8 million in 1997 to 3.9 million in 2012).Reference Jeerakathil, Burridge, Thompson, Fang and Hill12 There is a single HHT center for the province. Given Alberta’s widely dispersed population, screening individuals for HHT even after a stroke can be difficult. Our study contributed a better understanding of both age and sex-related trends regarding HHT and stroke in Alberta, namely that the age-standardized rate of stroke was significantly higher for persons with HHT compared with the baseline population (Figure 1) and that, despite a wide confidence interval and small population size, there is a higher rate of stroke in HHT.\n\nRegardless of age, an individual diagnosed with HHT is 1.73 times more likely to suffer morbidity and mortality from a stroke than if he or she were not diagnosed with HHT. As HHT predisposes patients to strokes via multiple mechanisms, we attribute this trend to the likely higher probability of an underlying genetic component in strokes occurring before age 60. Screening for HHT through an HHT center should be considered in this group in high risk individuals using historical information (epistaxis, telangiectasia, absence of traditional stroke risk factors). This approach may prompt clinicians to identify patients at risk of having HHT before patients present with sentinel diseases such as stroke at a young age. HHT Centers of Excellence are multidisciplinary care centers, specifically accredited by the Cure HHT Foundation of North America.\n\nAnother objective of this study was to understand if any particular age groups were more likely to have strokes with concurrent HHT diagnosis. The database yielded limited data on pediatric strokes as only one documented stroke occurred in the diagnosed HHT group. These findings were expected since pediatric strokes are also rare in the general population, thus the data were not adequately powered to elucidate correlations between HHT and strokes in pediatric patients.\n\nThe majority of strokes in both HHT and non-HHT populations occur in those over 60 years of age; a considerable portion of these cases were susceptible to cardiovascular risk factors. The lower risk middle-age strata is an important population because strokes occurring in patients between 31 and 60 years of age are more likely to have atypical causes for their stroke including genetic conditions such as HHT.Reference Kjeldsen, Oxhøj, Andersen, Green and Vase13, Reference Liebeskind23\n\nWe also found that stroke occurrence is steadily increasing throughout the 16-year span of this study in the non-HHT group, which concurs with findings from other studies that show a growing proportion of strokes occurs in middle-aged patients.Reference Kissela, Khoury and Alwell14 Individuals with strokes occurring in this age range, in the absence of a substantial risk factor burden, may benefit from an assessment for HHT. It is suspected that out of the general population, some individuals who have experienced a stroke within this age group may have HHT, but may have never been screened for the condition.\n\nOur study found HHT to be more common in Alberta than previously reported, at a prevalence of 1 in 3800. There is a wide range for HHT prevalence worldwide. Populations with Dutch genetic backgrounds seemingly have a higher prevalence than others. One such population comes from the Dutch Antilles, where the highest prevalence of HHT exists at 1 in 1331.Reference Westermann, Rosina, de Vries and Coteau15 The Alberta prevalence falls within the available published data. There are many Dutch settlements in AlbertaReference Bletz16 and many rural communities with large family units affected by HHT.\n\nAnother significant finding of this study includes the difference between males and females who have been diagnosed with HHT. Interestingly, over the 16 years of our study, females were on average 3.25 times more likely to be diagnosed with HHT. Other studies have shown similar trends, however, not quite as pronounced difference as our data suggests. An HHT population-based study by Donaldson et al found the female to male ratio for HHT diagnosis to be 1.7:1.Reference Donaldson, McKeever, Hall, Hubbard and Fogarty17 Our results do not accurately portray the genetic nature of HHT: it is not sex-linked. This discrepancy, which is unexpected given the autosomal inheritance of HHT, points to two possible reasons that the data show a female gender preponderance and males are being under-diagnosed or females may experience higher penetrance and thus are more symptomatic at the population level.\n\nThere are a number of explanations for the discrepancy between our results and the literature with regard to HHT prevalence in females. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia under-diagnosis in males is a likely contributor as clinical vigilance for rare diseases like HHT is often inadequate. Signs and symptoms of HHT may escape a clinician’s suspicion because they are often obscure or non-specific, such as chronic epistaxis, occult gastrointestinal bleeding, telangiectasias in the oral or nasal mucosa, chronic fatigue, or headaches. Moreover, probably men are less likely to bring such complaints to their primary care provider’s attention as compared with women. These views are supported by the Statistics Canada report “Women and Health” that showed females are more likely than males to have a family physician and are also more likely to seek medical attention.18\n\nOutside of these behavioral considerations, existing literature suggests women are also more likely to have more severe symptoms in HHT. Females have a greater physiological potential to present with bleeding manifestations given that they are prone to all of the bleeding opportunities of males (such as epistaxis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage) as well as uterine bleeding. The combined likelihood of hemorrhage could also increase the chances of presenting to medical care because of iron deficiency anemia. Shovlin et al identified patients to be particularly susceptible to cerebral ischemia if they have iron deficiency anemia in HHT.Reference Shovlin, Chamali and Santhirapala19 Accordingly, we see that women in Alberta with HHT are 1.88 times more likely that males to have a stroke or TIA. Another factor that makes women more vulnerable to severe complications of HHT is pregnancy. This is especially true when obstetricians and patients have no prior knowledge of an HHT diagnosis, so complications such as PAVM hemorrhage, stroke, and maternal death proceed in about 1% of pregnancies in mothers with HHT without the added benefit of clinical vigilance.Reference Shovlin, Sodhi, McCarthy, Lasjaunias, Jackson and Sheppard20\n\nBeyond age and gender trends, our study quantified rates of stroke subtypes in HHT in Alberta. There are multiple etiologies conferring strokes and transient ischemia upon HHT patients. Acute ischemic stroke was the most frequent subtype of stroke in the HHT population at 40 events out of 78. Transient ischemic attacks were also quite frequent at 32 events out of 78. Patients with HHT are at particularly high risk for these two stroke subtypes because of key hallmarks of HHT that predispose to cerebral ischemia, such as PAVMs, CAVMs and brain abscess, or thrombus formation. Abnormal vascular maturation in the pulmonary circulation can result in a right-to-left shunt (RLS) from PAVMs. Velthius et al found a significant correlation between higher-grade pulmonary RLS and cerebral complications (21%).Reference Velthius, Buscarini and van Gent21 Ischemic strokes and TIAs may be seen in individuals with HHT who have PAVMs with larger feeding arteries and not treated with standardized thoracic embolization protocols. Patients who have both CAVMs and PAVMs are also at particularly high risk of cerebral abscess that can lead to ischemia since PAVMS lack the capillary beds that often filter out typical lung pathogens.Reference Akers, Ball and Clancy9 Mathis et al postulate that emboli from PAVMs produce cerebral infarcts where hypoxia and polycythemia produce the necessary conditions for abscess development.Reference Mathis, Dupuis-Girod and Plauchu22 Patients with CAVMs in the context of HHT are at particular risk of thrombus formation. This is a reactive process within the CAVM because of hemodynamic changes that may diminish perfusion, exacerbate venous congestion, and lead to stasis and thrombosis.Reference Liebeskind23, Reference Kristensen, Malm and Calberg24\n\nIn contrast to ischemic strokes, cerebral hemorrhage was rare in the HHT group, with three cases each of intracranial and SAH, respectively. This finding contrasts the non-population based, but clinically rigorous study by Easey et al found a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke in a retrospective cohort of HHT probands and their families.Reference Easey, Wallace, Hughes, Jackson, Taylor and Shovlin3 Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients are theoretically at risk of hemorrhage as well, since rupture of abnormal intracerebral vasculature from CAVMs can lead to hemorrhagic strokes.Reference Maher, Piepgras, Brown, Friedman and Pollock25, Reference Nataf, Meder and Roux26 These discrepancies in findings might be partially explained by the ease of diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke and the condition being less subjective to recall bias than ischemic stroke in the retrospective design.Reference Easey, Wallace, Hughes, Jackson, Taylor and Shovlin3 Alternatively, our population-based design would be unlikely to miss cases of ICH that would be very likely to present to emergency departments. However, we may be subjected to misclassification bias and may fail to identify some persons with ICH having probable or possible HHT.\n\nThe strength of this study is the population-based design allowing examination of databases of an entire province. Limitations of this study include relatively small number of HHT cases because of the strict method of defining HHT diagnosis. This more stringent definition means we are erring on the side of specificity, biasing toward missing HHT rather than overestimating the rate of HHT. Consequently, our estimates of HHT cases and strokes within the HHT population are conservative. Using a longer period for this study or including more provinces may increase the sample size to show differences between stroke subtypes or age groups more clearly. As HHT is a rare disease, the administrative health data set represents an efficient and cost-effective way to estimate prevalence and impact.\n\nAnother shortcoming of this study is the lack of data on AVMs in those patients who experienced strokes. Correlating PAVM and CAVM data with stroke subtypes would offer an added robustness to the study methodology. As similar ratios of different stroke subtypes were seen in the non-HHT population as well, it is difficult to postulate without this information, how much these mechanisms of stroke in HHT factored into the risk of stroke for HHT patients compared with the baseline population. Another limitation of our design is the lack of integration with other provincial data. For example, even if one or two patients with ICH present to neighboring provinces, this skews our data as there were only three ICH events over 16 years in the HHT population.\n\nIn conclusion, stroke incidence rate is higher among individuals with HHT. As the age-adjusted stroke rate is higher in the HHT group, there may be an underlying genetic contribution. As such, affected individuals should be screened by history for additional stroke risk factors. This is especially true for male patients, as there seems to be an under-diagnosis of HHT in males in Alberta or under-presentation of males to HHT centers or stroke centers. Given that women have unique risk factors for stroke (oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, migraine with aura, and hormone replacement therapy), special consideration should be given to women with HHT who possess additional risk factors. As HHT is a rare, multi-system, chronic disease, these patients should be referred to an HHT Center of Excellence."
