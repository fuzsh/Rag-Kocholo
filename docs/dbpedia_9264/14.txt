(Optionally: A. Container is labeled - __. The specimen is received in formalin and consists of ) 1 fragment(s) of pink-tan tissue with a vaguely recognizable mucosal surface. The tissue measures __ cm. (The surgical margin is inked black. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for microscopic examination in one cassette.)

Microscopic evaluation

Anatomic/Histologic location

Describe mucosa as squamous (or ectocervical), endocervical (generally mucinous and glandular) or transformation zone mucosa.

Squamous (or ectocervical) mucosa at left and endocervical (mucinous) mucosa at right, in an example with abrupt transition.

Transformation zone mucosa, consisting of a mix of stratified squamous epithelium and mucinous glands, in an example with gradual transition.

Endocervical mucosa, with mucinous columnar epithelium and mucinous glands. H&E stain

However, the endocervical mucosa may appear columnar and non-mucinous.

A cervical biopsy may contain nabothian cysts, which are single or multiple cysts that contain mucin, lined by a single layer of columnar, cuboidal to flat cells with variable amounts of mucinous cytoplasm and small, basal, round to oval nuclei with fine chromatin, without conspicuous nucleoli or mitotic activity.[1]

The anatomic level of the transformation zone varies:[2]

Type 1: Completely ectocervical (common under hormonal influence).

Type 2: Endocervical component but fully visible (common before puberty).

Type 3: Endocervical component, not fully visible (common after menopause).

If you see fragments of non-mucinous epithelium and glands, it is likely endometrial, so evaluate it like an endometrial curetting.

Pathologies

Look for cervical dysplasia. It is mainly seen as nuclei with hyperchromasia, coarse chromatin and irregular contours.[3]

Spectrum from normal to high grade SIL.[4]

Further information: Cervical dysplasia

Other common findings:

Acute cervicitis, having a largely neutrophilic intra-epithelial infiltrate.

Chronic cervicitis, displaying mononuclear inflammatory cells. When clearly forming follicles as shown it can be called follicular cervicitis

Endocervical polyp: With endocervical epithelium and glands (mucinous columnar linings), edematous stroma and clear congestion. H&E stain.[5]

Example report

Endocervix, curettings:

Fragments of squamous and endocervical glandular epithelium without significant histopathologic changes.

Negative for dysplasia.

Cervical cone

Unless otherwise specified, the primary focus is any cervical neoplasia.

Fixation

Generally 10% neutral buffered formalin.

See also: General notes on fixation

Gross processing

Measure length, as well as the transverse and sagittal diameter of the ectocervical surface.[1]

Optionally, weight the sample.[1]

Note the symmetry of the sample, and the position of the cervical canal.[1]

Note whether the circumference is complete. If not, and the directions are indicated on the cone, determine the approximate position of the defect.[1]

Cones excised by knife should be inked on the excision surfaces. Those excised by laser do not need inking.[1]

Selection and trimming

If the cone is more than 1 cm long, take transverse slices from the top of the cone and towards the ectocervix, and stop when approximately 1 cm of the ectocervical portion of the cone remains.

Cut the portion into radial or sagittal slices. Sagittal slices are made perpendicularly to the portion surface, and should be divided into at least the four quadrants.[note 1][1]

In cases where the cone is small and fragmented, try to orient the preparations and divide them if possible to obtain sagittal slices.[1]

Look whether there is normal epithelium on each side of all slices where neoplasia is seen, and when the epithelium is missing in any direction, consider ordering additional serial sections or step sections.

HPV changes

Also look koilocytic changes of human papillomavirus (HPV), with such cells typically displaying:

Nuclear enlargement (two to three times normal size).

Irregularity of the nuclear membrane contour, creating a wrinkled or raisinoid appearance.

A darker than normal staining pattern in the nucleus, known as hyperchromasia.

Perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization ("nuclear halo").

Microscopic evaluation

The main objectives are:

Making a diagnosis of endometrioid polyp. An endometrial polyp may be diagnosed in the presence of 2 of the following 3:

Thick-walled vessels

Collagenous stroma

Epithelium on at least 3 sides

Look for signs of atypia or malignancy.

Endometrial polyp (without atypia), with a thick-walled blood vessel in middle - typical of endometrial polyps. Glands are regular.

Endometrial polyp (without atypia), with tubal metaplasia (black arrow, showing ciliated epithelium) and a thick-walled blood vessel (white arrow). The stroma is hemorrhagic in this case.

Myometrium (smooth muscle cells) versus endometrial stroma (more cellular) versus endometrial polyp stroma (more collagenous).[image 1]

Atypia (mainly seen as signs of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), which has the following criteria:[6]

- Architectural gland crowding

- Altered cytology relative to background glands

- Minimum size of 1 mm

- Exclusion of adenocarcinoma

- Exclusion of mimics

Mitoses should also preferably be seen.

Endometrial adenocarcinoma[7] arising in an endometrial polyp. These are most commonly endometrioid, in which case low-grade carcinoma is distinguished from hyperplasia with atypia by the presence of glandular crowding with endometrial stromal exclusion, and significant cribriform, confluent glandular, labyrinthine, papillary/villoglandular, or non-squamous solid architecture.[8]

Subserosal pedunculated uterine leiomyomas may present as endometrial polyps. They typically show smooth muscle in a fascicular pattern[9] Further information: Smooth muscle tumor

Endometrial curettings

Gross processing

Generally submit all tissue for microscopy, even larger volumes.

Look for products of conception if indicated from referral and/or history

Microscopic evaluation

Describe the anatomic/histologic type of epithelium.

Look mainly for:

Endometrial hyperplasia, atypa and/or malignancy.

Products of conception if indicated from referral and/or history

If a polyp is mentioned in the history or referral, also evaluate as endometrial polyp.

Anatomic/histologic epithelium type

(Determine the type or phase of the endometrium:)

The most superficial layer of the endometrium usually consists of a simple columnar epithelium.

Postmenopausal (atrophic) endometrium: Thin epithelium, and scattered glands lined by columnar cells with small inactive nuclei, supported by a dense fibrous stroma of spindle cells. (H&E stain)

The phases of endometrium through the menstrual cycle:

Proliferative endometrium: long curving glands (G) and some stromal edema (H&E stain)

Secretory endometrium: Prominent glands (G), which have a dilated lumen and an irregular outer border stretching down into the basal compartment. In the luminal (functional) layer immune cells are readily detected (most of these are likely to be macrophages and uterine natural killer (uNK) cells), as are areas of decidualised fibroblasts (DEC) close to arterioles. (H&E stain)

If you want to specify the phase by day, then it's more accurate to state it as days past ovulation where applicable, since the follicular phase may vary substantially.

Hyperplasia, atypa and/or malignancy

Look for signs of atypia or malignancy:

Endometrial hyperplasia: Cystically dilated endometrial glands lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium, without atypia.[1]

Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), has the following criteria:[2]

- Architectural gland crowding

- Altered cytology relative to background glands

- Minimum size of 1 mm

- Exclusion of adenocarcinoma

- Exclusion of mimics

Mitoses should also preferably be seen.

Endometrial adenocarcinoma[3], most commonly endometrioid, in which case low-grade carcinoma is distinguished from hyperplasia with atypia by the presence of glandular crowding with endometrial stromal exclusion, and significant cribriform, confluent glandular, labyrinthine, papillary/villoglandular, or non-squamous solid architecture.[4]

Microscopy report

Example in a normal case:

(Endometrial curettings:

Benign proliferative endometrium and endocervical mucosa without significant histopathologic changes.) Negative for neoplasia ((or viral cytopathic changes)).

Endometrial thickening

Hysterectomy sampling

A regular hysterectomy grossing is performed, but with the following sampling:[5]

2 longitudinal sections through ecto/endocervix (1 anterior and 1 posterior)

2 longitudinal sections through upper endocervix/lower uterine segment (1 anterior and 1 posterior), immediately adjacent to the sections taken from the cervix

4 full-thickness representative sections of endomyometrium (2 anterior and 2 posterior)

Transversely section the remaining anterior and posterior endomyometrium (~1 cm thick). Submit the entire endometrium from the lower uterine segment to the fundus, maintaining orientation.

Submit entire fimbriae (longitudinally sectioned) and 2 representative cross-sections on each side.

Microscopic evaluation

Look for signs of atypia or malignancy:

Endometrial hyperplasia: Cystically dilated endometrial glands lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium, without atypia.[6]

Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), has the following criteria:[2]

- Architectural gland crowding

- Altered cytology relative to background glands

- Minimum size of 1 mm

Reporting

Most importantly:

Presence or absence of atypia.

Hysterectomy

For a freshly received uterus, generally gross it fresh to include either opening it up (small specimen, no suspected malignancy seen) and/or serial sectioning, in order to let the formalin penetrate it properly. Ensure the endometrium is immersed in the formalin (such as having the serosa oriented upwards).

Gross processing

Gross examination

For orientation:

The round ligament lies anterior to the tubes and ovaries.[8]

The peritoneum extends further down along the cervix posteriorly than anteriorly.[9] Its ends bluntly posteriorly and sharply anteriorly.[9]

When received the same day as the surgery, perform the following steps at least to serial sectioning before putting (back) in formalin, preferably with paper towels between slices, so that it fixes properly:[8]

(Remove the adnexa.[8] Weigh the uterus without the adnexa.)

Perform a general inspection

Measure the 3 dimensions, including the cervix. (Also measure the length of the cervix, the maximum diameter of the cervix, and the width of the cervical os.)

(Ink the surgical margin of the cervix for orientation, such as black on the posterior side.)

Open the uterus by transmural radial cuts on both sides of the uterine cavity.[note 1] The cavity is sometimes be squeezed or rolled around a leiomyoma, and you'll you have to improvise and perhaps go around the leiomyoma to open the cavity properly.

Inspect the mucosa. If any polyps: Further information: Endometrial polyp

If more extensive tumor, gross as per endometrial cancer

Serially section through almost the entire depth of the myometrium at approximately 1 cm intervals, still keeping the specimen together.

Measure the thickness of the mucosa and myometrium

Inspect the myometrium. If any tumor: Further information: Smooth muscle tumor

Endometrial adenocarcinoma[15], most commonly endometrioid, in which case low-grade carcinoma is distinguished from hyperplasia with atypia by the presence of glandular crowding with endometrial stromal exclusion, and significant cribriform, confluent glandular, labyrinthine, papillary/villoglandular, or non-squamous solid architecture.[4]

Adenomyosis (endometrial glands in the myometrium). Look at these at high magnification to exclude dysplasia, as for endometrium.

Microscopy report

Examples of reports:

Normal cases

[note 2]

Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:

Benign cervix.

Benign inactive endometrium.

{{Leiomyomata and adenomyosis.}}

Benign ovaries.

Benign fallopian tubes.

Negative for malignancy.

Microscopy of hysterectomy shows ecto and endocervix without atypia. The glands have columnar epithelium without atypia.

In the uterine cavity, there is endometrial mucosa with ordinary thickness and regularly arranged endometrial glands. (Optionally: Description of likely menstrual phase.) Sharp delimitation between endometrium and myometrium. The myometrium contains no focal changes. No evidence of malignancy.

Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia

Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:

Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia; entire endometrial/myometrial junction submitted for microscopic exam.

Benign lower uterine segment.

Benign bilateral tubes and ovaries.

Smooth muscle tumor

Gross processing

Gross examination

When finding fibroids (spherical tumors with whorled pattern, which in the uterus can be presumed to be smooth muscle tumors), examine and describe:[8]

Location. If in the uterus:

Intramural/submucosal/subserosal (see image)

(Posterior/anterior/right or left lateral.)

Number of tumors, if multiple. May be described simply as "multiple".

Size (may be described as "up to ___ cm in greatest dimension".

(Presence or absence of any hemorrhage or necrosis.)

((Demarcation))

Selection

In case of hysterectomy, submit pieces from all fibroids >5 cm in diameter.[8]

Submit any macroscopically abnormal parts of the fibroids (hemorrhagic, necrotic, brittle or softening areas, and areas with blurry delimitation).[8]

For fibroids that are significantly calcified, a gross-only description as a calcified fibroid is generally sufficient, without the need to decalcify it to dissect it or sample from it.[note 3]

Microscopic examination

Distinguish leiomyoma (benign) from leiomyosarcoma (malignant) by looking at the latter's criteria:[16]

Marked cellular atypia

Mitoses: > 10 mitoses/10 high power fields

Necrosis

Diagnosis of conventional leiomyosarcoma requires 2 of these 3 histologic features.[16]

Leiomyomas typically show smooth muscle in a fascicular pattern (arrows point at fascicles).[17][image 1]

Leiomyoma, with areas where the cellularity is relatively lower (left) and higher (right).

Leiomyoma with nuclear pleomorphism, yet within benign limits.

Epithelioid leiomyoma

Leiomyoma with palisading pattern

Leiomyosarcoma: Variable atypia, often with cytoplasmic vacuoles at both ends of nuclei, and frequent mitoses.[18]

Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma

Microscopic report

Report:

Microscopic findings, including any visible linings

Diagnosis or most probable one

Any linings or borders.

Example, for a cervical polyp:

Intrauterine device

Gross processing

These are generally just visually described, with no samples for microscopic examination. Example report:

T-shaped item with metal-coated arms and stem (Optionally: consistent with an intrauterine device with copper), with attached threads measuring 6.5 cm each.

Products of conception

Gross processing

Look up the gestational age of the pregnancy.

Look for fetal tissue (fetus, fetal membranes or chorionic villi). They are generally easier to distinguish from decidua (which is maternal tissue) when fragments are put in clear fluid and shaken, with chorionic villi having a consistency like orange pulp, whereas decidua is more rubbery. The fluid may be formalin if no sample for genetic workup is needed. If chorionic villi are found, no lengthy search is needed for other kinds of fetal tissue, just a quick look for obvious ones. Membranous material is less reliable, and may still indicate further sampling. Inspect any found fetal tissue for gross anomalies. If found, submit one piece of the fetus and one piece of the placenta.[19]

Fresh chorionic villi (arrows), surrounded by decidua, at 10 weeks of gestational age.

Chorionic villi (arrow) become more characteristic when held in fluid, having a fibrillary shape

Fresh chorionic villi (left) compared to decidua (right).

Chorionic villi become more pale when fixed in formalin.

Macropathology of fixed umbilical cord, amnion and chorionic villi at 7-13 weeks of gestational age

Fresh chorionic villi in a term placenta for comparison, being more granular.

If fetal parts are not visually found, search for diagnostic placental tissue, which is soft and shaggy or spongy (as opposed to membranous, which is likely to be decidua or blood clots).[19]

If no fetal or placental tissue is found, all presented tissue generally needs to be submitted.

(If transported or processed together with other cases, put any chorionic villi in thin-mesh cassettes or tissue bags to limit contamination).[note 4]

Gross report

(Labeled - products of conception.) The specimen (is received <<fresh / in formalin>>) and consists of multiple fragments of soft tan-pink decidua, blood clots and amniotic sac measuring about 5 cc in aggregate. The intact amniotic sac measures 2.3 cm in greatest dimension. Fetal tissue is identified within the amniotic sac, measuring 1.0 cm in crown-rump length. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic examination (in 1 cassette).

Microscopy

The most important is to detect the presence of chorionic villi.

Products of conception, with chorionic villi (arrow) among decidualized endometrium

Immature chorionic villi, having loose stroma and few capillaries.

Necrotic chorionic villi in a tubal pregnancy.

Scantly cellular decidua may look like chorionic villi, but lack the thick trophoblastic lining.

In the absence of chorionic villi, look for implantation site intermediate trophoblasts (ISITs):

ISITs, having relatively large and dark nuclei.

Histology of decidua for comparison, having smaller and brighter nuclei.

In the absence of both chorionic villi and ISITs, preferably perform cytokeratin immunostaining of each tissue sample, such as CAM5.2.[20]

In the absence of chorionic villi and ISITs even after staining, call the clinician, since there may be an ectopic pregnancy.

Microscopy report

Examples:

Fallopian tube

Gross processing

(Look in the history for any intra-fallopian coils (Essure devices).)[note 5]

For sterilization

Measure length and average diameter of each tube

Serially section at 3-4 mm intervals,[21] or 2-3 mm if suspected malignant (including BRCA mutation).[22] Submit

Submit 1 (or 3) circumferential transverse sections. If the specimen is only a segment of the tube of less than <5mm((, ink the surgical cut surfaces and)) submit all tissue.[21]

Example gross report:

(A. Labeled - __. The specimen is received in formalin and consists of) two fimbriated segments of fallopian tube measuring __ cm in length and __ cm in average diameter. On sectioning, each displays a patent lumen. No gross abnormalities are identified. The tubes are unoriented. The specimen is serially cross-sectioned and representative sections are submitted for microscopic examination in two cassettes.

Microscopic examination

Ensure there is at least one full cross-section from each tube, and take further samples otherwise.

Check for patency of the lumen.

Tumor

The most common tumor of the fallopian tubes is adenomatoid tumor:[23]

An adenomatoid tumor of the fallopian tube, low magnification, displaying infiltrative-like borders.

High magnification of the same case, showing the typical[23] features of tubular spaces of varying size composed of flattened cells resembling endothelium.

Reporting

Example of a normal report in sterilization:

(Right and left fallopian tubes, ((laparoscopic)) bilateral salpingectomy:)

Complete cross-sections of histologically unremarkable fallopian tubes.

When included in a uterus specimen, normal tubes and ovaries may simply be mentioned as:

Bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, unremarkable.

When done for ectopic pregnancy, report any rupture, either from the gross report or from microscopy, for example:

Benign ruptured fallopian tube with ectopic products of conception, including degenerated immature chorionic villi and implantation site with fresh hemorrhage.

Further information: Products of conception

Notes

↑

In the US, the cut goes from side to side, through the cervix and uterine cavity, keeping the anterior and posterior halves attached by a relatively thin connection left at the fundus. It is done by cutting with scissors with the blunt end in the cervix and then uterine cavity, or by a blade guided on each side by the shanks of a pair of forceps inserted through the cervix.

In Sweden, the uterus is usually opened at the front in the midline, optionally with an incision towards each corner.

It can be done by scissors, or by inserting a probe or forceps to guide a long blade.

↑ The first example is used in Connecticut, and the second example is used in Sweden.

↑ When a fibroid has calcifications it has been there a long time, and can be assumed to be benign.

↑ Chorionic villi are promiscuous contaminants of other tissues, and may cause a false positive finding for another cassette containing products of conception.

Ovary

Gross processing

The ovary is cut in the longitudinal plane (through the "long axis").

Ovaries, including those with cysts, are almost never inked.

Gross report

Template:

(A. Labeled - __. The specimen is received in formalin and consists of) an ovary measuring ___. The ovarian capsule is tan-pink and smooth. Cut sections reveal solid, white and whorled parenchyma, and no gross lesions. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic examination in __ cassettes.

Microscopic examination

Apart from any obvious tumor, also look for signet ring cells, which is a major feature of metastatic tumors to the ovary.

Placenta

Gross processing

Determine the shape of the placenta

Look for any accessory lobes

Determine the completeness of placental membranes, opacity, color and consistency (slimy/slippery?)

Determine the point of rupture from nearest margin

Note where the membranes are inserted

Examine the umbilical cord

Measure the distance between the insertion point and the nearest placental margin

Measure the cord length and give proximal and distal diameter. In placental pathology, the proximal umbilical cord refers to the segment closest to the placenta, and distal is the segment closest to the fetus.[note 1]

Count the number of vessels away from the insertion

Weigh the trimmed disk, after having trimmed away the cord and membranes, and after having removed excess amounts of loose retroplacental blood clots over the maternal surface.

Examine the fetal surface (chorionic plate):

Note its color, in particular if it is green (often faint and tan-green, brown-green to yellow-green (which indicates meconium staining).

Look for any pathologies including granular excrescences, subchorionic fibrin or subamniotic hemorrhage

Look at the integrity and extent of the vasculature, including any traumatic damage. Also palpate the vasculature for any thrombosis. If a thrombus is grossly found for a live birth, the baby may have thrombosis, so the finding must immediately be reported to the clinician in care of the baby.

Examine the maternal surface (basal plate) for completeness, adherent blood clots, depressions, calcifications and fibrin

Take a membrane roll and cord sections, before sectioning the placenta

With the fetal surface down on the cutting board, cut the placenta at 1cm intervals so that it can be reconstructed.

Making a fetal membrane roll.

Placental tissue after cutting, here showing severe intervillositis, with dark red and soggy tissue.

Palpate the parencyhmal sections for areas of induration.

Note the color of the parenchyma and describe any pale areas, cysts, thrombi, increased fibrin, calcifications and infarcts. For possible infarcts, estimate the total amount of infarcted tissue as a percentage of the placental volume. Infarction is clinically significant if it involves at least 5-10% of the placental volume.

If you see a true knot (rather than "false knots" which are merely bulges or protuberances that may look like knots), report whether the diameter of the cord is significantly different before versus after the knot (which is a sign of constriction caused by the knot).

Tissue selection

Distal (toward fetus) membrane roll and cross section of distal cord. It should include the area of rupture.

Proximal (toward placenta) membrane roll and cross section of proximal cord ( 2-3 cm from insertion). They should include membranes up to the chorionic plate.

A membrane roll is created by cutting a strip, about 3 cm wide, of membrane, from the rupture site to the placental insertion. Hold the edge with forceps and roll it around the forceps, and then cut a transverse section of the roll.

Cord sections should be no thicker than 4mm.

Placental section including fetal surface ( full thickness if possible)

Placental section including maternal surface (full thickness if possible)

Any lesions or abnormalities

Avoid taking placental sections near the margin. (If transported or processed together with other cases, put the placental in thin-mesh cassettes or tissue bags to limit contamination).[note 2]

Example report:

Container A. Labeled "bladder tumor". The specimen is received in formalin and consists of multiple fragments of tan-gray, friable soft tissue measuring about __ x __ x __ cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted for microscopic examination in __ cassettes.

Gross report

Example in a normal case:

(A. Labeled with patient's name and medical record number. The specimen is received fresh and consists of a) placenta with attached membranes and umbilical cord. The membranes are tan-red( with a marginal insertion. The site of rupture is __ cm from the nearest placental margin. There is no accessory lobe.) The trimmed placental weight is __ gramsTemplate:Comprehensive-begin-Corresponding to the __th percentile for the gestational age)). The placental disc measures __ cm and varies in thickness from __ to __ cm. The umbilical cord is tan-pink and eccentrically inserted(, __ cm from the nearest placental margin, and measures __ cm in length, __ cm in proximal diameter and __ cm in distal diameter.) Cut sections of the cord reveal three blood vessels. The fetal surface is blue-pink, smooth with normal vasculature and << minimal / moderate / major>> subchorionic fibrin deposition. The maternal surface is complete with <<minimal / moderate / major>> physiologic calcifications. Sectioning reveals a red, spongy, homogenous parenchyma without gross lesions. (Representative sections are submitted for microscopic examination in 4 cassettes.)

KEY OF SECTIONS (example):

1- distal membranes and umbilical cord

2- proximal membranes and umbilical cord

3- placental section including fetal surface

4- placental section including maternal surface

Microscopic examination

Look for inflammation, especially by the fetal surface in the intervillous spaces and around the fetal blood vessels.

Acute subchorionic intervillositis, with neutrophils (annotated) in Langhan’s layer of fibrinoid (by the fetal surface, at the base of a chorionic villus, seen at top right).

On the other hand, a small amount of intervillous neutrophils by the fetal surface like this is insignificant.

Umbilical cord: Acute phlebitis and funisitis (inflammation of a vein and the connective tissue, respectively) with neutrophils.

Acute chorioamnionitis, with neutrophils in the chorion. Also seen are fibrin thrombi, which indicate a severe fetal inflammatory response.[4]

Acute choriodeciduitis, with neutrophils seen in the chorion and decidua.

At least if there is a suspicion of meconium in the amniotic fluid (from clinical history and/or the gross exam), look for the following histopathologic signs of it:[5]

The pigment-laden macrophages are presumably meconium-laden "meconiophages", the pathologic diagnosis can be termed "meconium histocytosis"

Other relatively common findings

Calcifications, are normal in term placentas. Report if seen in a placenta younger than 36 weeks of gestational age.[6]

Villous fibrinoid necrosis. Only needs mention when severe ((or moderate)).

Chorangiosis, an abundance of blood vessels within the chorionic villi.

Increased syncytial knotting of chorionic villi, with two knots pointed out. Causes include both hypoxia and hyperoxia.[7]

Microscopy report

Generally, also include major gross findings, such as an area of placental abruption.

Example of normal report:

(Placenta, <<vaginal/Caesarean>> delivery:)

Third trimester placenta with term villous histology. Placental weight (__ gm), at __th percentile for gestational age. Membranes without significant histopathologic changes((, negative for chorioamnionitis)). Trivascular umbilical cord, with no significant histopathologic changes((, negative for funisitis)).

Mild to moderate inflammation in the decidua alone can be ignored (as it is most commonly a physiological response and doesn't have a clinical significance for the fetus).

Example in a twin placenta:

Twin placenta, Caesarean section:

Third trimester dichorionic, diamniotic twin placenta.

Villous morphology histologically appropriate for gestational age.

Placental weight approximately 25th percentile for gestational age.

Two three-vessel umbilical cords.

Negative for chorioamnionitis and funisitis.

Vulva

Gross processing

Generally as per skin.

Microscopic examination

Mainly look for squamous vulvar intraepithelial lesions:

Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL):[8]

Acanthosis, papillomatosis, and/or atypical koilocytosis in upper layers

Usually mild atypia and mitoses, limited to the lower third of stratum spinosum and basale

Binucleated epithelial cells

High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL):[8]

Enlarged atypical nuclei and mitoses involving middle and upper third of the epithelium.

Also telling are atypical mitoses and/or extension in hair follicles and skin appendages.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.

Staging of vulvar cancer

Tumors of the vulva are staged as per the AJCC, 8th Ed:[9]

Primary tumor (T) TNM FIGO Criteria TX Primary tumor cannot be assessed T0 No evidence of a primary tumor Tisa Carcinoma in situ (preinvasive) T1a IA Lesions ≤2 cm, confined to the vulva or perineum and with stromal invasion ≤1 mmb T1b IB Lesions >2 cm or any size with stromal invasion >1 mm, confined to the vulva or perineum T2 II Tumor of any size with extension to adjacent perineal structures (distal third of the urethra, distal third of the vagina, anal involvement) T3 IVA Tumor of any size with extension to any of the following proximal two thirds of the urethra, proximal two thirds of the vagina, bladder mucosa, or rectal mucosa or fixed to pelvic bone

Regional lymph nodes (N) TNM FIGO Criteria NX Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed N0 No regional lymph node metastasis N1 1 or 2 regional (inguinofemoral) lymph nodes with the following features (see N1a, N1b) N1a IIIA 1 or 2 lymph node metastases, each < 5 mm N1b IIIA 1 regional lymph node metastasis ≥5 mm N2 Regional (inguinofemoral) lymph nodes with the following features (see N2a, N2b, N2c) N2a IIIB 3 or more lymph node metastases, each < 5 mm N2b IIIB 2 or more regional lymph node metastases ≥5 mm N2c IIIC Regional lymph node metastasis with extracapsular spread N3 IVA Fixed or ulcerated regional lymph node metastasis

Distant metastasis (M) TNM FIGO Criteria M0 No distant metastasis M1 IVB Distant metastasis (including to pelvic lymph nodes)

Cervical cytology

Clinical information

It is not necessary to look through more than readily available reports from previous cervical cytologies.

Magnification

While being fairly new to cervical cytology, preferably start looking at a high magnification such as 20x objective (with 10x eye piece). For suspicious findings, you may magnify up to maximum. On the other hand, once the pattern feels repetitive you can try switching to a slightly lower magnification such as 10x.

Adequacy

Adequacy should always be stated, either as "Satisfactory" or "Unsatisfactory". For estimating the number of cells, determine the following:

The area of your field of view at high power (see the Evaluation chapter)

The total size of the relevant area on the microscope slide. A ThinPrep is about 360 mm2.

Look at 10 representative high power fields (HPFs) within that area, and calculate the average number of cells per high power field.

You may count 10 fields either across the slide, or 5 fields in each direction.[10]

Total number of cells = Average number of cells per HPF * Total size of area

HPF area

Conventional smear cellularity should be at least 8,000 cells. Liquid-based cytology cellularity should be at least 5,000 cells. Also a conventional smear is inadequate if >75% of cells are obscured by blood, exudate or air-drying artefact.[10]

Eventually you will be able to tell when most cases are adequate or inadequate without performing a detailed calculation.

Transformation zone presence

State whether the endocervical/transformation zone is present or absent. Count an endocervical component as present if there are 10 or more endocervical or squamous metaplastic cells.[11]

Endocervical cells can be viewed from the side as nuclear polarity (margination towards the same side as others) in a “picket-fence” configuration.

Sheets of endocervical cells have a honeycomb pattern.

In patients with previous hysterectomy, simply report glandular or squamous metaplastic cells as such, rather than stating the presence of a transformation zone, since they are likely vaginal in origin in such patients.[12]

Very common findings

For reporting, acute inflammation should be a background of ample dispersed neutrophils, and not only aggregates of neutrophils with cells or mucus.

Vaginal squamous cell with normal vaginal flora versus bacterial vaginosis on Pap stain. Normal vaginal flora (left) is predominantly rod-shaped Lactobacilli, whereas in bacterial vaginosis (right) there are clue cells, covered in bacteria. A significant amount of clue cells can be reported as "Shift in vaginal flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis".

Candida, seen as pseudohyphae.

Main conditions to exclude or confirm

Squamous atypia, seen mainly as cells with increased nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, nuclear hyperchromasia and irregular nuclear outline.

Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), with only few slightly atypical cells

Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), here compared to an unremarkable intermediate squamous cell.

High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), showing even more prominent features, and decreased cytoplasm, causing a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio.

Cytopathology of squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing variant, with typical features.[13] Pap stain.

LSIL and changes consistent with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the presence of koilocytes, which show perinuclear cavitation, binucleation, nuclear hyperchromasia, and nuclear enlargement.

Distinguish HPV-changes from glycogenated squamous cells. Glycogen confers a yellowish color to the cytoplasm. It can look like the perinuclear cavitation of koilocytes, but has more rounded edges.

Clinical implication

If you are uncertain of the degree of dysplasia, it can be useful to look up how much difference it will likely make for the management of the patient. You may make an Internet search for the management of abnormal cervical screening in your region (such as The ASCCP tool for management in the US). A change from close follow-up to colposcopy is not that big of a deal, but if one of the alternatives will lead to a diagnostic excision, make sure that the case is looked upon by commensurate expertise.

Report

Example in a normal case:

Cervical/endocervical ThinPrep:

Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM).

Male reproductive system

Phimosis

Gross processing

Generally sample one or two representative sections in a cassette, in addition to sections of any grossly visible lesions.

See also: General notes on gross processing

Microscopic evaluation

Look for:

Signs of lichen sclerosus[17]

Epithelial hyperplasia, dysplasia, or early invasive carcinoma.[18]

Optionally, note any sclerosis and/or fibrosis.

Reporting

Description of objective findings, and any suspected underlying disease.

Presence or absence of dysplasia.

Vas deferens

Gross processing in sterilization

In sterilization:[19]

Measure length and diameter.

Serially section

Submit 2 cross sections measuring 5 mm in length.

Communicate to the histology lab to section the specimen as tubular structures, in order to get proper cross-sections.

Microscopic examination in sterilization

Confirm that there is a complete cross-section from each side. Example images of normal vas deferens:

Report

Example report:

Right and left vas deferens segments, excisions:

Complete cross-sections of vasa deferentia without significant histopathologic changes.

In table above, each top image shows recommended lines for cutting out slices to be submitted for further processing. Bottom image shows which side of the slice that should be put to microtomy. Dashed lines here mean that either side could be used. Further information: Gross processing of skin excisions

Microscopic evaluation

If the lesion was pigmented on gross examination, evaluate as a dark skin focality. If not:

Look for atypical cells, possibly by scrolling through the epidermis at intermediate magnification and then through the dermis at a lower magnification. If atypical cells are found, look for:

Similarity to epidermal basal cells, evaluate as suspected basal-cell carcinoma

Similarity to squamous cells: See below:

Squamous cell-like skin proliferations: Differential diagnosis

Main differential diagnoses and their characteristics:[22]

Invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin: Atypical and pleomorphic keratinocytes, involving the dermis and the sub-cutis with a potential metastatic spread.

Squamous-cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen’s disease): Atypical keratinocytes at every layer of epidermis.

Actinic keratosis: Atypical keratinocytes that do not span the full thickness of the epidermis (or, in Bowenoid variant, are less disordered with less nuclear atypia and crowding).

Keratoacanthoma: Symmetrical and circumscribed proliferation of keratinocytes, with central horn plug, with epidermis that extends over the tumor. It can be regarded as a highly differentiated SCC.

Crush artifacts: Needles used to orient the skin sample may create crush artifacts (black arrow) mimicking cellular atypia with mainly hypereosinophilia and nuclear pleomorphism. Image also shows folding artifacts (white arrows).

Adnexal carcinomas: Squamous differentiation, but does not show connection with the epidermis and highlights adnexal features.

Adenosquamous carcinoma: Mixed glandular and squamous differentiation.

Verruca vulgaris: Marked hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis. Rete ridges slope inward at the borders of the lesion.

Verrucous squamous cell carcinoma[note 5]: Exophytic squamous proliferation with marked papillomatosis and low atypia and the presence of koilocyte-like changes. Found in head and neck locations, as well as in the genitalia and sole of the foot.

Inverted follicular keratosis:[note 6]: Sharply circumscribed endophytic verrucous proliferation with prominent squamous features.

Seborrheic keratosis: Acanthosis, absence of atypia, pseudo-horn cysts, in inflamed lesions, mitoses may be present.

Bowenoid papulosis: Atypical keratinocytes and mitoses. Histology similar to Bowen’s disease.

A melanoma may have relatively plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm, and be seemingly continuous with the squamous epithelium (at left in image), thus resembling a squamous cell carcinoma. However, the nesting of cells at right in the image is more characteristic of a melanoma.

Metastasis: Personal medical history of the patient, nodular proliferation without connection to epidermis, immunohistochemical evaluation. Squamous-cell carcinoma metastasis from lungs to the skin is pictured.

General benign imitators of skin malignancy

Granulomatous skin inflammation often contains giant cells that may appear atypical.

Further workup of malignant findings

In case of skin cancer, determine whether the peripheral/radial and deep margins are clear, close or continuous.[23][note 7] A close margin has various definitions for different malignancies, but for basal-cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma it is defined as being closer than 1 mm from the edge (but yet non-continuous with it),[23][24] but 2-3 mm for melanoma.[25]

Previous biopsy

(At least if there is a known previous biopsy, look for changes that are consistent with a biopsy site, to confirm that it was taken from the excised area.) Such changes in the skin include:

Granulation tissue in more fresh biopsies

Dense collagen

Fibrosis with vertical blood vessels

Fibrosis that replaces solar elastosis

Reporting

Preferably see specific article on the condition at hand, if available.

Optionally, the presence of a keratinized squamous epithelium.

Any abnormalities, generally preceded by location in terms of epidermal, dermal or more specific layers thereof.

If malignant:

Degree of differentiation

Radicality, mainly into either of the following:

>___ mm (Definitions vary for the distance as per Further workup of malignant findings above): "Clear margins" (or: "Clear margins at over __ mm")((or the exact distance thereof)).))

<___ mm but not continuous with edge: "Close margins at __ mm at (location). [[Locations are mainly the deep edge, or the (superior/inferior/medial/lateral) radial edge.]]." Numbers are generally given at an exactness of 0.1 mm.[23]

Continuous with margin: "Not radically excised at (location)."

For skin shave biopsies, non-radicality may be reported as: "Extending to base and peripheral edges of biopsy" (as they may not be regarded as "margins" on a biopsy).

Perineural or vascular invasion if present.

Basal-cell carcinoma

Author: Mikael Häggström [note 1]

Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC):

Fixation

Generally 10% neutral buffered formalin.

See also: General notes on fixation

Gross processing

Gross examination

Note:

Color

Well-defined or diffuse border

Size

Any elevation

Tissue selection

Tissue selection from suspected malignant skin lesions, by lesion size:[1][note 2] <4 mm 4 - 8 mm 9 - 15 mm

In table above, each top image shows recommended lines for cutting out slices to be submitted for further processing. Bottom image shows which side of the slice that should be put to microtomy. Dashed lines here mean that either side could be used. Further information: Gross processing of skin excisions

Microscopic evaluation

Broadly consists of determining the following:

Whether it is basal-cell carcinoma or a differential diagnosis.

Aggressiveness pattern

Radicality

Optionally, further subtyping of basal-cell carcinoma can be made.

Characteristics

Nests of cells appearing similar to epidermal basal cells, and are usually well differentiated.[2]

Palisading is a typical feature.

Cleft formation is fairly specific, but may not be seen in smaller nests.

In uncertain cases, immunohistochemistry using BerEP4 can be used, having a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting only BCC cells.[3]

Differential diagnoses

Main histological differential diagnoses of basal cell carcinoma:

Hair follicles

Hair follicles: Peripheral sections may look like nests, but do not display atypia, and nuclei are smaller.

Also, hair follicles generally display more distinct features when looking at adjacent levels.

Hair follicle tissue may be superficial, resembling a superficial basal-cell carcinoma.

The edges of hair follicle cells may resemble palisades, but are less pronounced, and are generally more diffusely delineated compared to surroundings.

Squamous-cell carcinoma

Squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin is generally distinguishable by for example relatively more cytoplasm, horn cyst formation and absence of palisading and cleft formations.

Yet, a high prevalence means a relatively high incidence of borderline cases. In such cases, look particularly at the surface and attempt to classify as either of the following:

Basal-cell carcinoma with squamous cell metaplasia or metatypical (squamoid) basal-cell carcinoma. It is basal-cell carcinoma with subepidermal (but no intraepidermal) areas resembling squamous-cell carcinoma.

Basaloid squamous-cell carcinoma, in this case showing a biplastic pattern with basaloid elements associated with both conventional dysplastic squamous surface (arrow heads) and conventional squamous cell carcinoma (arrow).[4]

In unclear cases, the most useful immunohistochemistry marker appears to be MOC-31, which essentially always stains metatypical basal-cell carcinomas but not basaloid squamous-cell carcinomas.[5] UEA-1 appears to be the second most useful marker, staining almost all basaloid squamous-cell carcinomas but only a few metatypical basal-cell carcinomas.[5]

Others[6]

Trichoblastoma: Absence of cleft, rudimentary hair germs, papillary mesenchymal bodies.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma: Lack of basaloid cells disposed in peripheral palisades; adenoid-cystic lesion without connection to the epidermis; absence of artefactual clefts

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: Bland keratinocytes, keratin cysts, ductal differentiation. BerEp4- (in 60% of cases)[7], CEA+, EMA+

Trichoepithelioma:[note 3] Rims of collagen bundles, calcification, follicular/sebaceous/infundibular differentiation and cut artefacts. Cytokeratin (CK)20+, p75+, Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1 + (PHLDA1+), common acute lymphoblastic leukemiaantigen + (CD10+) in tumor stroma, CK 6-, Ki-67- and Androgen Rceptor- (AR-)

Merkel cell carcinoma: Cells arranged in a diffuse, trabecular and/or nested pattern, involving also the subcutis. Mouse Anti-Cytokeratin (CAM) 5.2+, CK20+, S100-, human leukocyte common antigen- ( LCA-), thyroid transcription factor 1- (TTF1-)

Aggressiveness

Aggressiveness can be classified as low-level aggressive, moderately aggressive and highly aggressive, based mainly the cohesion of cancer cells, but also upon other histopathologic subtypes:

Low-level aggressive patterns

Nodular. Also known as "classic basal-cell carcinoma". It accounts for 50% of all BCC.[6] It typically has relatively cohesive aggregates of basaloid cells with well-defined borders, showing palisading and one or more clefts.[6] Central necrosis with eosinophilic, granular features may be also present, as well as mucin. The heavy aggregates of mucin determine a cystic structure. Calcification may be also present, especially in long-standing lesions.[6] Mitotic activity is usually not so evident, but a high mitotic rate may be present in more aggressive lesions.[6]

Fibroepitheliomatous pattern: anastomosing basaloid epithelial strands enclosing round islands of fibrous stroma[8]

Moderately aggressive pattern

Moderate cohesion

Highly aggressive patterns

Cicatricial or morphoeic pattern: Narrow strands and nests of basaloid cells, typically with sharp edges, surrounded by dense sclerotic stroma.[9]

Micronodular pattern: Small and closely spaced nests.

Radicality

Determine if there are basal-cell formations continuous with resection margins, or if they are closer or farther than 1 mm from the closest edge.[10] If closer, measure the distance.

If uncertain, immunohistochemistry with BerEP4 helps in distinguishing the BCC cells.

Further information: Evaluation of tumors

Reporting

Aggressiveness pattern, at least if highly aggressive.

Radicality, mainly into either of the following:

>1 mm (as per Radicality above): "Clear margins" (or: "Clear margins at over __ mm")((or the exact distance thereof)).))

<1 mm but not continuous with edge: "Close margins at __ mm at (location). [[Locations are mainly the deep edge, or the (superior/inferior/medial/lateral) radial edge.]]." Numbers are generally given at an exactness of 0.1 mm.[10]

Continuous with margin: "Not radically excised at (location)."

Optionally, subtype of basal-cell carcinoma

Example:

(Skin excision with stratified squamous keratinized epithelium, where the dermis contains) moderately aggressive basal-cell carcinoma, not radically excised at the right margin.[note 4]

Actinic keratosis

Authors: Mikael Häggström; Authors of integrated Creative Commons article[1] [note 1]

Actinic keratosis may present as suspected malignant skin excisions.

Fixation

Generally 10% neutral buffered formalin.

See also: General notes on fixation

Gross processing

Gross examination

Note:

Color

Well-defined or diffuse border

Size

Any elevation

Lesions of actinic keratosis are typically ill-marginated, erythematous, scaling, and rough papules or patches. These will typically be found in areas displaying other signs of solar damage, such as atrophy, uneven pigmentation, and telangiectasias.[1]

Tissue selection

Tissue selection from suspected malignant skin lesions, by lesion size:[2][note 2] <4 mm 4 - 8 mm 9 - 15 mm

In table above, each top image shows recommended lines for cutting out slices to be submitted for further processing. Bottom image shows which side of the slice that should be put to microtomy. Dashed lines here mean that either side could be used. Further information: Gross processing of skin excisions

Microscopic evaluation

Evaluation mainly consists of:

Establishing a diagnosis of actinic keratosis rather than differential diagnoses:

Excluding any presence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in the lesion.

Characteristics

By definition, actinic keratosis is confined to foci within the epidermis.[1]

it also generally has:[1]

Aggregates of atypical, pleomorphic keratinocytes which show nuclear atypia, dyskeratosis, and loss of polarity.

Hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, the latter overlying the abnormal cells in the epidermis. Due to the sparing of segments of the epithelium overlying adnexal structures, a characteristic pattern of alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis, referred to as the “flag-sign,” can often be seen (Figure 1(a)).

Atypical keratinocytes will not span the full thickness of the epidermis (Figure 1(b)), although those in the basal cell layer will frequently extend into the granular and cornified layers. The exception to this criterion is the Bowenoid variant of actinic keratosis, which resembles cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen's disease) but is less disordered with less nuclear atypia and crowding.

A more basophilic basal layer than normal, which is generally thought to be a consequence of the close crowding of atypical keratinocytes (Figure 1(b)).

Some cases will also show basal layer degeneration and the formation of Civatte bodies (Figure 1(c)), the result of a lichenoid infiltrate with irregular acanthosis. This can be distinguished from lichenoid dermatitis by the presence of keratinocyte atypia.

Dermoepidermal junction irregularities, with small round buds at the basal cell layer that will protrude slightly into the upper papillary dermis (Figure 1(d)).

There is almost always an associated solar elastosis in the dermis, and a lack thereof can often be sufficient to prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis.

1(b). Early actinic keratosis with keratinocyte dysplasia confined to the lower third of the epidermis.[1]

Civatte body (in a case in lichen planus).

1(d). A more established lesion of actinic keratosis demonstrating nearly full thickness keratinocyte dysplasia and prominent budding of the basal layer into the superficial dermis.[1]

Squamous cell-like skin proliferations: Differential diagnosis

Main differential diagnoses and their characteristics:[3]

Invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin: Atypical and pleomorphic keratinocytes, involving the dermis and the sub-cutis with a potential metastatic spread.

Squamous-cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen’s disease): Atypical keratinocytes at every layer of epidermis.

Actinic keratosis: Atypical keratinocytes that do not span the full thickness of the epidermis (or, in Bowenoid variant, are less disordered with less nuclear atypia and crowding).

Keratoacanthoma: Symmetrical and circumscribed proliferation of keratinocytes, with central horn plug, with epidermis that extends over the tumor. It can be regarded as a highly differentiated SCC.

Crush artifacts: Needles used to orient the skin sample may create crush artifacts (black arrow) mimicking cellular atypia with mainly hypereosinophilia and nuclear pleomorphism. Image also shows folding artifacts (white arrows).

Adnexal carcinomas: Squamous differentiation, but does not show connection with the epidermis and highlights adnexal features.

Adenosquamous carcinoma: Mixed glandular and squamous differentiation.

Verruca vulgaris: Marked hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis. Rete ridges slope inward at the borders of the lesion.

Verrucous squamous cell carcinoma[note 3]: Exophytic squamous proliferation with marked papillomatosis and low atypia and the presence of koilocyte-like changes. Found in head and neck locations, as well as in the genitalia and sole of the foot.

Inverted follicular keratosis:[note 4]: Sharply circumscribed endophytic verrucous proliferation with prominent squamous features.

Seborrheic keratosis: Acanthosis, absence of atypia, pseudo-horn cysts, in inflamed lesions, mitoses may be present.

Bowenoid papulosis: Atypical keratinocytes and mitoses. Histology similar to Bowen’s disease.

A melanoma may have relatively plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm, and be seemingly continuous with the squamous epithelium (at left in image), thus resembling a squamous cell carcinoma. However, the nesting of cells at right in the image is more characteristic of a melanoma.

Metastasis: Personal medical history of the patient, nodular proliferation without connection to epidermis, immunohistochemical evaluation. Squamous-cell carcinoma metastasis from lungs to the skin is pictured.

Clinical clues

Biopsy from sun exposed area (including the face, neck, dorsal hands, and forearms, upper chest, back, and scalp).[1]

Generally middle-aged or older individuals.[1]

Further workup

Once a diagnosis of actinic keratosis is established, optionally characterize the degree of atypia into either mild, moderate or severe.

Histopathology report

Objective findings

A diagnosis of actinic keratosis

Optionally: The degree of atypia.

Even absence of evidence of malignancy.

Example for the case in "Further workup":

(Skin excision with squamous stratified epithelium with moderate) atypia in the basal epidermis (, with enlarged and dark cell nuclei as well as slightly disrupted cell arrangements.) No evidence of malignancy.

Squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin

Authors: Mikael Häggström; Authors of integrated Creative Commons article[1] [note 1]

Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin may present as suspected malignant skin excisions.

Fixation

Generally 10% neutral buffered formalin.

See also: General notes on fixation

Gross processing

If re-excision, see separate section at bottom.

Gross examination

Note:

Color

Well-defined or diffuse border

Size

Any elevation

Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (essentially synonymous with Bowen’s disease) often presents as an erythematous, well-demarcated, scaly patch or plaque, with a fairly irregular border. They occasionally present as dark skin focalities, especially when found in the genital region and the nails.[1]

Invasive SCC typically has ill-marginated, erythematous, scaling, and rough papules or patches.[1]

Tissue selection

Tissue selection from suspected malignant skin lesions, by lesion size:[2][note 2] <4 mm 4 - 8 mm 9 - 15 mm

In table above, each top image shows recommended lines for cutting out slices to be submitted for further processing. Bottom image shows which side of the slice that should be put to microtomy. Dashed lines here mean that either side could be used. Further information: Gross processing of skin excisions

Microscopic evaluation

Evaluation consists of:

Determining whether it is a SCC rather than a differential diagnosis.

Distinguishing a SCC in situ from an invasive SCC

Radicality, and if radical, determine the least distance to a margin.

Characteristics

Malignant keratinocytes demonstrating intense mitotic activity, pleomorphism, and greatly enlarged nuclei. They will also show a loss of maturity and polarity, giving the epidermis a disordered or “windblown” appearance.

In situ

In SCC in situ (Bowen’s disease) the epidermis will show:

Atypia spanning the full thickness of the epidermis, being the main finding.[1]

Hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis.[1]

Marked acanthosis with elongation and thickening of the rete ridges. These changes will overly keratinocytic cells which are often highly atypical and may in fact have a more unusual appearance than invasive SCC.

Typical squamous-cell carcinoma cells are large with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, often vesicular, nuclei.[3]

Two types of multinucleated cells may be seen:[1]

Multinucleated giant cells

Dyskeratotic cells engulfed in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes.

Occasionally, cells of the upper epidermis will undergo vacuolization.[1]

There may be a mild to moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltrate detected in the upper dermis.[1]

Atypia spanning the full thickness of the epidermis is enough in this case for the diagnosis of SCC in situ. There is also a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.

In contrast to actinic keratosis, the basal epidermal layer in SCC in situ is frequently spared, and will show little to no visible atypia. Additionally, SCC in situ will almost always involve both the interfollicular and adjacent follicular epithelium and adnexal structures.[1]

Overlap of squamous-cell and basal-cell carcinoma

Basal-cell carcinoma is generally distinguishable by for example relatively less cytoplasm, palisading, cleft formations and absence of horn cyst formation.

Yet, a high prevalence means a relatively high incidence of borderline cases. In such cases, look particularly at the surface and attempt to classify as either of the following:

Basal-cell carcinoma with squamous cell metaplasia or metatypical (squamoid) basal-cell carcinoma. It is basal-cell carcinoma with subepidermal (but no intraepidermal) areas resembling squamous-cell carcinoma.

Basaloid squamous-cell carcinoma, in this case showing a biplastic pattern with basaloid elements associated with both conventional dysplastic squamous surface (arrow heads) and conventional squamous cell carcinoma (arrow).[4]

In unclear cases, the most useful immunohistochemistry marker appears to be MOC-31, which essentially always stains metatypical basal-cell carcinomas but not basaloid squamous-cell carcinomas.[5] UEA-1 appears to be the second most useful marker, staining almost all basaloid squamous-cell carcinomas but only a few metatypical basal-cell carcinomas.[5]

Clinical clues

Biopsy from sun exposed area (including the face, neck, dorsal hands, and forearms, upper chest, back, and scalp).[1]

Generally middle-aged or older individuals.[1]

In situ versus invasive

Invasive SCC

Invasive SCC is defined by dermal infiltration.

Superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCCSI). These lesions often do not show the marked pleomorphism and atypical nuclei of SCC in situ, but demonstrate early keratinocyte invasion of the dermis.[1]

High magnification demonstrates the pleomorphism of the invading keratinocytes.[1]

Invasive nests with characteristic large celled centers. Ulceration (at left) is common in invasive SCC.

This infiltrate can be somewhat difficult to detect in the early stages of invasion: however, additional indicators such as full thickness epidermal atypia and the involvement of hair follicles can be used to facilitate the diagnosis. Later stages of invasion are characterized by the formation of nests of atypical tumor cells in the dermis, often with a corresponding inflammatory infiltrate.[1]

Radicality

Determine whether the distances between atypical cells are more or less than 1 mm from the deep and radial edges. If less than 1 mm, quantify the distance.[6]

Degree of differentiation

This is applicable to invasive SCC.

Well-differentiated (and yet invasive) SCC, showing prominent keratinization and may form “pearllike” structures where dermal nests of keratinocytes attempt to mature in a layered fashion. Well-differentiated SCC has slightly enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with abundant amounts of cytoplasm. Intercellular bridges will frequently be visible.[1]

Moderately differentiated lesions of invasive SCC show much less organization and maturation with significantly less keratin formation.[1]

Poorly differentiated, where attempts at keratinization are often no longer evident. This is a clear-cell squamous cell carcinoma. The dysplastic cells here infiltrate in cords through the dermis. Poorly differentiated SCC has greatly enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei demonstrating a high degree of atypia and frequent mitoses.[1]

Poorly differentiated clear-cell squamous cell carcinoma. For this type of SCC, immunostains will likely be required to classify it unless other areas of the tumor show obvious squamous cell features such as seen here (keratinization in center).

Perineural or vascular invasion

In SCC, look for any perineural invasion,[note 3] and at least a quick glance for any vascular invasion.

Perineural invasion: the arrow indicates a large peripheral nerve that has been surrounded by tumor cells.[1]

Vascular invasion: the arrow indicates a small cluster of atypical squamous cells in a small vessel.[1]

Perineural invasion is defined as tumor in close proximity to nerve and involving at least 33% of its circumference or tumor cells within any of the three layers of the nerve sheath (epineurium, perineurium and endoneurium).[7] First look along the border of the tumor, followed by surrounding tissue, and if still not found, look through the rest of the tumor area as well.[1]
