        "text": "They say old is gold. When it comes to car brands, we think that the saying stands to be quite the truth. You might not be aware, but some auto brands started their journey over a hundred years ago! These ten oldest car companies were the precursors of automobile innovation back then and even now. Let's have a look at the oldest car companies around the world.\n\nPeugeot\n\nPeugeot set foot in the market in 1810. Do you know that this auto manufacturer initially started as a family-run coffee mill? It wasn't until 1882 that Peugeot began producing cars!\n\nTatra\n\nThis Czech automaker launched itself in the 1850s. It was famous for making automobiles that could ace the Dakar rally motorsport tournament. The brand started its journey by making horse-drawn carriages.\n\nOpel\n\nThe history of Opel dates back to 1862. Like our previous two carmakers, Opel didn't start with automobiles. The brand started as a sewing machine manufacturer. To date, Opel remains one of the top names in the industry.\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nMercedes Benz kicked off its journey as a gas engine and industrial machine producer in 1883. It was only three years later when this now-luxury brand patented the Benz Patent Motorwagen to produce motor vehicles. The brand launched the first Mercedes vehicle in 1926.\n\nSkoda\n\nWhen the brand started in 1896, it went by \"Laurin & Klement.\" Back then, the brand indulged in manufacturing human-powered land vehicles or velocipedes. After WWI, Skoda started producing trucks.\n\nLand Rover\n\nLand Rover rolled with different names and ownership over the years. Lancashire Steam Motor Company was the first moniker for this auto brand in 1896. After stints under Ford and BMW ownership, the brand became a subsidiary of Tata Motors in 2008.\n\nRenault\n\nRenault corporation was founded in 1899 by brothers Fernand, Marcel, and Louis Renault. The first launch by Renault was the Voiturette 1CV. The brand enjoys a rich heritage in motorsports as well!\n\nFiat\n\nFiat flooded the roads with city cars and attractive little superminis. Since its inception in 1899, it rapidly catered to Italy's growing demands for automobiles. In 2014, the brand merged with Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nCadillac\n\nCadillac entered the world of automobiles in 1902 with a close relationship with Ford. It operated from the Henry Ford factory to produce stunning models like Tonneau and Runabout. General Motors acquired the brand in 1909.\n\nFord\n\nIf you've heard stories about automobile revolutions, you sure would've heard about Ford. Henry Ford made sure that automobiles were more accessible to people. With the mass production of Model T, Ford established its dominance in the market.\n\nThese historic age-old brands have gifted the auto industry with numerous innovations, don't you think!"
