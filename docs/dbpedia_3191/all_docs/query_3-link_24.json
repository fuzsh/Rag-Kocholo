        "text": "Ferrari’s past isn’t about nostalgic memories. It represents a constant source of inspiration and a driver of innovation, both in terms of technology and design. It is in this spirit that Ferrari Design and the Tailor Made Department have created 70 exclusive liveries, paying homage to the design cues from 70 of the most striking road and racing cars in the company’s history. These liveries were created on occasion of Ferrari’s 70th Anniversary, for five vehicles (488 GTB, 488 Spider, California T, GTC4Lusso and F12berlinetta) and resulted in 350 unique designs. A tribute to the past with an eye to the future, in the true spirit of Ferrari.\n\n“Inspired by AF Corse’s no. 51 car, with which Alessandro Pier Guidi and James Calado won the 2017 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) Drivers’ and Manufacturers’ titles, this special finish for the new Ferrari 488 Pista is available exclusively for customers involved in the company’s motor sports programs.\n\nThe exterior features a new livery with stripes in the colours of the Italian flag recalling the racing version of the 488 GTE, embellished by a laurel celebrating the WEC title, the logo of the championship and the word “PRO” indicating the class the car raced in. The Italian flag livery features again along the car’s flanks which are also adorned with the personal race number each client will be able to add. The matte black S-Duct and the natural carbon-fibre ‘dovetail’ suspended rear spoiler and vent surrounds round off the personalization of the exterior.\n\nThe interior, in black Alcantara®, includes seats upholstered with a special perforated version of the same material that incorporates the Italian flag in the central band of the backrest. The national colours are also clearly visible on the edge of the gearshift paddles and on the floormats which, like the carpeting itself, are made of a special technical fabric. The number that features on the external livery also appears on the base of the steering wheel, while all the carbon-fibre trim parts have a matte finish"
