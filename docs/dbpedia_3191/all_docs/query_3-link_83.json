        "text": "When you think of pricey supercars, a few companies come to mind: Bugatti, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, and Pagani, among others. These manufacturers have cemented themselves as the top dogs in the premium space, extending to their wealthiest clientele the fastest, rarest, prettiest—and in this case—most expensive cars on the planet.\n\nBut to find out which of these unattainable-to-most vehicles is the priciest, we've scoured the invoice sheets and uncovered 50 cars all worth $1 million or more. The group includes hybrid Ferrari convertibles, an American speed king, a few electric Hypercars, and a trio of one-of-a-kind Rolls-Royce cars built exclusively for royalty.\n\nIt should be noted, though, that the prices listed here reflect the price of the vehicles when new. So we’re not counting auction cars like the Ferrari 250 GTO, or overpriced secondhand sales. But don’t worry, there are still hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cars here to whet your appetite.\n\nMcLaren Senna GTR\n\n$1.7 Million\n\nThe McLaren Senna GTR costs nearly $2 million, and you can’t even drive it on the road. The track-only supercar is much more aggressive than the road-going version, featuring a big splitter and diffuser that helps generate 2,200 pounds of downforce. It only weighs 2,619 lbs while making 813 horsepower from its twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine, so it’s no surprise owners have to keep them on the track.\n\nCzinger 21C\n\nPrice: $1.7 Million\n\nYou might not know the name Czinger yet, but this California-based boutique automaker is responsible for the $1.7 million 21C supercar. With 1,250 horsepower on tap thanks to a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V-8, the 21C can rocket to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds and a top speed of around 281 miles per hour.\n\nFerrari Monza\n\nPrice: $1.7 Million\n\nMuch like the roof-less McLaren Elva, the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 are all about al fresco motoring. As the name implies, the SP1 is the single-seater option while the SP2 has just enough room for you to bring along a friend. Both cars come powered by the same naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V-12 engine capable of 809 horsepower and 530 pound-feet. Unfortunately for US buyers, neither of these models are street legal in the States. But f you have the funds to afford the car’s $1.75 million price tag, getting onto a track probably won’t be an issue anyway.\n\nGordon Murray T.33\n\nPrice: $1.7 Million\n\nThe second and slightly more affordable supercar in the new Gordon Murray lineup is the T.33. With 607 horsepower courtesy of a naturally aspirated 3.9-liter V-12, the T.33 revs to a ridiculous 10,500 RPM. With a price tag of around $1.7 million at current conversion rates, Gordon Murray automotive promises to sell this car globally, in both right- and left-hand-drive configurations. Too bad it's already sold out.\n\nKoenigsegg Gemera\n\nPrice: $1.7 Million\n\nOne of two Koenigsegg models on this list, the Gemera is actually the Swedish supercar maker’s first four-seater. But that doesn’t mean it’s some family car. With a twin-turbocharged 2.0-liter engine under the hood and three electric motors, the Gemera has 1,700 horsepower and will hit 60 in just 1.9 seconds. The company only plans to build 300 of them, each one costing at least $1.7 million.\n\nHennessey Venom F5\n\nPrice: $1.8 Million\n\nThe Hennessey Venom GT was a record-breaker, topping out at 265.7 miles per hour in a world record run. But the new F5 plans to beat its predecessor with an estimated top speed of 311 mph, and with that comes a higher price, too. The Venom F5 starts at $1.8 million, according to the company, which makes it just a bit pricier than its $1.2-million predecessor.\n\nBentley Bacalar\n\nPrice: $1.9 Million\n\nWith just 12 total units produced, the Bentley Bacalar makes some of the \"limited\" cars on this list look plentiful by comparison. Although the car’s opulent design may be the first thing to grab your attention, the Bacalar is no slouch in terms of performance either. With Bentley’s signature turbocharged 6.0-liter W-12 turbocharged engine, this car delivers 650 horsepower and 664 pound-feet. If you have a spare $1.9 million lying around and are considering buying one, you’re already too late—Bentley says that every example is now in customer hands.\n\nHispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne\n\nPrice: $1.9 Million\n\nTo call the Hispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne beautiful would be... a stretch. But this interesting-looking supercar made its US debut at this year's Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance boasting a 1,114-horsepower electric powertrain and a 0-60 time of 2.6 seconds. The Boulogne version pictured here – the lighter and more powerful of the two—costs close to $1.9 million.\n\nBentley Mulliner Batur\n\nPrice: $2.0 Million\n\nThe electric onslaught is coming. Bentley says it will be a fully electric automaker by 2030. But before the luxury brand transitions to battery power fully, the Mulliner Batur helps send the iconic W12 engine off in style. With 710 horsepower from that twin-turbocharged engine, the Batur is the most powerful Bentley ever. And since it's limited to just 18 examples globally, the Batur costs a whopping $2.0 million.\n\nSSC Tuatara\n\nPrice: $2.0 Million\n\nAlthough initially cloaked in controversy, SSC did manage to hit 282.9 miles per hour with its Tuatara hypercar, breaking a world record. But not only is the Tuatara one of the fastest vehicles on the planet, it’s also one of the priciest. The cost for all that speed is estimated to be around $2.0 million for the base Tuatara, limited to just 100 units worldwide.\n\nLotus Evija\n\nPrice: $2.1 Million\n\nWith a new Emira sports car and an Eletre electric SUV, Lotus is on the brink of a comeback. The automaker plans to roll out a number of new products within the next few years, with part of that strategy including the range-topping Evija. This supercar comes in at a cool $2.1 million and produces nearly 2,000 horsepower via four electric motors. Lotus plans to build just 130 road-going examples of the Evija.\n\nAston Martin Vulcan\n\nPrice: $2.3 Million\n\nAs with a few other cars on this list, the Aston Martin Vulcan was a track-only special. The British supercar made its world debut in 2015, powered by a naturally aspirated 7.0-liter V-12 that produced 820 horsepower, and limited to just 24 examples worldwide. An even more track-focused AMR Pro model followed, but even the base Vulcan was a pricey commodity, costing about $2.4-million from the factory.\n\nDelage D12\n\nPrice: $2.3 Million\n\nYou may have heard of Delage before. In the early 1900s, this French automaker was competing on the track with Bugatti and Ferrari. Now Delage is back and with a beautiful new hypercar dubbed the D12. Powered by a 7.6-liter V-12 engine, the new D12 produces upwards of 1,010 horsepower and costs a cool $2.3 million.\n\nFerrari Daytona SP3\n\nPrice: $2.3 Million\n\nThe Ferrari Daytona SP3 is the brand’s most aerodynamically efficient model ever—and doesn’t even have any active aero. Debuting in 2021, the limited-edition SP3 has a 6.5-liter V-12 borrowed from the 812 Competizione that gives it 828 hp and a 0-62 mph time of about 2.8 seconds. Ferrari never disclosed how many Daytona SP3s the company would produce, but each one cost about $2.3 million when new.\n\nMcLaren Speedtail\n\nPrice: $2.3 Million\n\nWhat would you pay for the fastest production McLaren ever? Well, at least $2.3 million. With 1,035 horsepower courtesy of a gasoline-electric hybrid V-8 powertrain, the Speedtail tops out at 250 miles per hour and is able to reach 186 mph in just 12.8 seconds—2.7 seconds faster than the P1. Unfortunately, if you didn't get your hands on one new in 2020, you'll have to shell out serious cash on the used market. McLaren only built 106 examples.\n\nRimac Nevera\n\nPrice: $2.4 Million\n\nThe Rimac Nevera takes the title of most expensive EV with its $2.4 million price tag—but only by a few hundred thousand dollars over the next priciest electric supercar. Packing 1,914 horsepower and 1,740 pound-feet of torque, the Nevera can hit 60 in under 2.0 seconds and will continue on to a top speed of 258 miles per hour. Those lucky enough to order one should see it in their driveway before the end of 2022.\n\nPagani Utopia\n\nPrice: $2.5 Million\n\nFirst came the Zonda, then the Huayra, and now the Pagani Utopia. With 852 horsepower and an available seven-speed manual gearbox, the Utopia is the most powerful road-going Pagani ever produced and it’s limited to just 99 examples worldwide. The cost for one is a cool $2.5 million.\n\nPininfarina Battista\n\nPrice: $2.5 Million\n\nAptly named after the company’s founder, Battista Farina, the Pininfarina Battista delivers the kind of performance (and price!) to make its namesake proud. Revealed at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, the Battista is completely electric, putting out 1,827 horsepower. If a normal supercar’s 0 to 60 time sounds too leisurely for you, the company says that the Battista will take you there in under 2.0 seconds. Pininfarina plans on building 150 examples of the Battista, costing $2.5 million each.\n\nGordon Murray T.50\n\nPrice: $2.6 Million\n\nIf the name Gordon Murray sounds familiar, it’s because he's the man behind the design of the iconic McLaren F1. These days, Mr. Murray has his own supercar venture, and the handsome T.50 is the crown jewel of the lineup. At $2.6 million, the T.50 packs a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter V-12 that makes 654 horsepower. The car itself weighs a mere 2,174 pounds, and at 392 pounds, the T.50 has the lightest V-12 on the road today.\n\nLamborghini Countach\n\nPrice: $2.6 Million\n\nThe name Countach may be iconic, but is it worth $2.6 million? That's what Lamborghini hopes you will spend on its new Aventador-based model. Debuting in August of 2021, the Countach LPI 800-4 has a 6.5-liter V-12 with a light hybrid assist that gives it a whopping 803 horsepower, allowing for a 60 time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of more than 220 miles per hour.\n\nHennessey Venom F5 Revolution\n\n$2.7 Million\n\nWith the new F5, Hennessey moved into building bespoke models. And the Venom F5 Revolution continues that effort. The track-focused hypercar uses the builder’s 6.6-liter Fury V-8 engine, making the same 1,817 horsepower and 1,193 pound-feet of torque as the road car. However, the F5 Revolution has enhanced aerodynamics, doubling the downforce at 186 mph with a larger front splitter, a rear diffuser, and dive planes.\n\nMercedes-AMG Project One\n\nPrice: $2.7 Million\n\nMercedes has promised a production version of the Project One hypercar for quite a while now. The first official announcement was in March of 2017 before the first concept debuted later that same year. But after nearly five years of teasing, it appears as if the Project One will finally hit public roads. And when it does, the hybrid hypercar will have over 1,200 horsepower and a price tag of $2.7 million.\n\nZenvo Aurora\n\nPrice: $2.8 Million\n\nZenvo wowed at Monterey Car Week 2023 with the new Aurora hypercar, in both track- and road-focused guises. With a quad-turbocharged 6.6-liter V-12 hybrid underhood, the rear-wheel-drive Aurora Agil has 1,250 horsepower while the all-wheel-drive Tur model haas 1,850 horsepower. The starting price for the Aurora is a cool $2.8 million with the first deliveries slated to take place in 2026.\n\nAston Martin Victor\n\nPrice: $3.0 Million\n\nThe folks at Aston Martin know a thing or two about exclusive vehicles, and the Victor might be the most exclusive project for the British brand to date. Based on the One-77 platform, the Victor uses parts from several donor Astons including the track project Vulcan and the upcoming Valkyrie. And talking about limited production—the Victor is one-of-one and rumored to cost nearly $3 million.\n\nHennessey Venom F5 Roadster\n\n$3.0 Million\n\nThe same Hennessey Venom F5 hypercar we all know and love, but with less roof. The F5 Roadster has the same twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V-8 as the coupe, producing the same 1,817 horsepower and 1,193 pound-feet of torque. Hennessey estimates a top speed of over 300 miles per hour, but if you want one, it will cost you at least $3.0 million.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily.\n\nFor more information, read our\n\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nKoenigsegg Jesko\n\nPrice: $3.0 Million\n\nThe Koenigsegg Jesko, apart from being the fastest car the company has made to date, is also the most expensive. At $3.0 million out of the box, the handsome hypercar has 1,600-horsepower courtesy of the brand's ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Opt for the Absolut model, and the Jesko, in theory, will be able to hit 300 miles per hour.\n\nAspark Owl\n\n$3.1 Million\n\nThe Aspark Owl is all about its big numbers. The electric hypercar has 1,985 horsepower and 1,475 pound-feet of torque, which rockets it to 60 mph in a claimed 1.69 seconds. It can reach 186 mph in 10.6 seconds while on the way to its 249 mph top speed. All that power requires big, 10-piston front brakes and four-piston rear to keep it under control. They are limited, but you can buy one for a cool $3.1 million.\n\nAston Martin Valkyrie\n\nPrice: $3.2 Million\n\nThe upcoming Aston Martin hybrid hypercar hasn’t even hit the market yet, but already the $3.2 million Valkyrie has sold out. For what it’s worth, Aston Martin hasn’t officially released pricing. Estimates suggest the hypercar could go for anywhere between $2.6 and $3.9 million—but $3.2 million seems to be the magic number. Whatever the case, this machine is impressive. Its Cosworth-sourced 6.5-liter V-12 produces 1,160 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque, meaning its top speed should be well over 200 miles per hour. The company will build just 150 examples of the standard Valkyrie, with a limited 25-run AMR model arriving later.\n\nW Motors Lykan Hypersport\n\nPrice: $3.4 Million\n\nDubai-based W Motors shocked the world with its edgy Lykan Hypersport supercar in 2013. With titanium LED headlights housing 420 15-carat diamonds and a holographic display in the center console, it's no surprise it was the third most expensive car ever when new. It falls to number six on our list here, but it's still a wild hypercar with a powerful heart; the twin-turbocharged 3.7-liter six-cylinder engine underhood produces 780 horsepower and 708 of torque.\n\nMcLaren Solus\n\n$3.5 Million\n\nOne seat, 829 horsepower, and a top speed of over 200 miles per hour. The new McLaren Solus is about as close as you can get to a Formula 1 car from the factory, powered by a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V-10 engine with a 0-62 mile-per-hour time of just 2.5 seconds. Estimates suggest a McLaren Solus will set you back about $3.5 million.\n\nPagani Huayra Evo R\n\n$3.5 Million (est.)\n\nThe Pagani Huayra Evo R is somehow a hotter version of the Huayra R track car that the automaker launched in 2021. It debuted earlier this year with an updated version of the Huayra R’s naturally aspirated, 6.0-liter V-12 engine, which makes 900 horsepower and 567 pound-feet of torque. Pagani also tweaked the Evo’s aerodynamics, which resulted in a 45 percent increase in downforce. There isn’t an official price on the Evo R, but estimates put it at around $3.5 million.\n\nLamborghini Sian\n\nPrice: $3.6 million\n\nIn several ways, the Sian represents a bridge to Lamborghini’s future. Though it’s based on the Aventador SVJ, this wild-looking Lambo is the brand’s first production electrified offering. In addition to the SVJ-sourced 6.5-liter V-12, the Sian uses a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Total system output is 819 horsepower, which also makes it the most powerful Lamborghini ever. As confirmed by the 63 stuck on either side of the Sian’s wing, Lamborghini will produce just 63 units. And each will cost far more than the Aventador SVJ, carrying a price of $3.6 million.\n\nKoenigsegg CC850\n\nPrice: $3.7 Million\n\nThe Koenigsegg CC850 was a surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one. Borrowing the twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V-8 from the Jesko, it notches that output up to 1,385 horsepower and 1,022 pound-feet of torque, with a so-called “TWMPAFMPC” transmission that shifts (pun intended) between manual and automatic functions. Of course, all that performance technology will cost you; the CC850 starts at $3.7 million.\n\nBugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+\n\nPrice: $3.9 Million\n\nEarlier this year, Bugatti captured the collective attention of the automotive world by announcing that it broke the 300 miles per hour barrier with a modified version of the Chiron. The Super Sport 300 + is a road-going version of that car, meant to celebrate the occasion. Limited to just 30 units, the Super Sport 300+ is a beautiful version of the Chiron, with flowing, slippery bodywork and a sweet stripe motif. Despite having hit 304.8 mph on the track with a production vehicle, Bugatti does limit its Chiron 300+ to 273 mph in top speed mode.\n\nGordon Murray Automotive T.50s Niki Lauda\n\n$3.9 Million\n\nThe GMA T.50s Niki Lauda has hundreds of new parts compared to the standard T.50, making the car even more capable on the track. The unique car features a new aerodynamics package that increases downforce and a different version of the Cosworth-sourced 3.9-liter V-12 engine, making 761 horsepower at 11,500 rpm. It’s also the priciest of the Gordon Murray lineup at $3.9 million.\n\nPagani Huayra Roadster BC\n\n$4.0 Million\n\nThe Pagani Huayra Roadster arrived several years after the coupe, and the Roadster BC showed up a few years later in 2019. The V-12 in this version churns out 791 horsepower and 775 pound-feet—more than the standard Roadster—and gets a slight weight reduction. It cost a cool $4.0 million when new.\n\nLamborghini Veneno\n\nPrice: $4.5 Million\n\nLamborghini built just 14 examples of the Aventador-based Veneno between 2014 and 2015. Each one cost around $4.5 million, depending on how it was spec'd, and was available in both convertible and coupe configurations. Underhood Lamborghini fitted a more-powerful iteration of the Aventador's 6.5-liter V-12, now producing 740 horsepower and 509 pound-feet of torque, which gave it the ability to sprint to 60 miles per hour in a blistering 2.9 seconds. To date, it’s the most expensive new Lamborghini ever.\n\nBugatti Bolide\n\nPrice: $4.7 Million\n\nProduced in extremely limited numbers atop the body of a Chiron, it's no wonder Bugatti's one-of-40 Bolide track car is this pricey. At $4.7 million, the 1,824-horsepower hypercar has more power than the Chiron Super Sport 300+, and more extreme bodywork that allow it to lap tracks like the Nurburgring in record time (in theory). Bugatti says the Bolide would be able to conquer the ‘Ring in record time.\n\nPininfarina B95 Speedster\n\nPrice: $4.8 Million\n\nThe Pininfarina B95 Speedster is an open-top beaut. Based on the Battista coupe, the B95 has 1,877 horsepower courtesy of a 120.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack and four electric motors. That means it takes the B95 less than 2.0 seconds to hit 60 mph with a top speed of 186. But as the brand’s first coachbuilt vehicle, it isn’t cheap; the B95 costs about $4.8 million USD.\n\nBugatti Mistral\n\nPrice: $5.0 Million\n\nThe Bugatti Mistral sends the iconic W16 engine off in style. With 1,577 horsepower and no roof, the Mistral takes the best bits of the Chiron and borrows elements from the Bolide and Divo to create a truly unique roadster. Of course, Bugatti plans to build just 99 examples of the Mistral at the cost of around $5.0 million in the US—and all of them are already accounted for.\n\nBugatti Divo\n\nPrice: $5.8 Million\n\nAmong Bugatti’s recently debuted vehicles, the Divo is a staff favorite. Though it shares much in common with its cheaper (!) sibling the Chiron, the Divo has a lot going for it to justify the extra money. By adding lighter wheels, a carbon fiber intercooler and removing some sound deadening, Bugatti made the Divo 77 pounds lighter than the Chiron. Though power is unchanged from the Chiron’s 1,500 ponies, The Divo features a different aerodynamic setup, which makes it 8 seconds quicker around the Nardo test track. Finally, the moment you’ve been waiting for: Bugatti is making 40 examples of the car, each costing $5.8 million.\n\nPagani Huayra Imola\n\n$6.0 Million\n\nBased on the Huayra, the Pagani Imola has an AMG-sourced 6.0-liter, twin-turbo V-12 engine that makes 838 horsepower and 811 pound-feet of torque. And it weighs just 2,776 pounds. The numerous fins, wings, and scoops help cool all the components and feed the thirsty engine, propelling it to an electronically limited 217-mph top speed. Pagani says the coupe costs $5.4 million and the Roadster is even more expensive at $6.0 million.\n\nPagani Codalunga\n\nPrice: $7.4 Million\n\nThe long list of pricey (new) Paganis ends with the Codualunga. Inspired by 1960s Italian coachbuilding, the stunning exterior and steampunk-esque interior—while equally stunning—are only part of what makes this Pagani so pricey. Under the hood is a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V-12 producing 829 horsepower and 809 pound-feet of torque, paired to a seven-speed sequential transmission for a real race-car–like feel. The cost for this one-of-five Pagani is $7.4 million.\n\nMercedes-Maybach Exelero\n\nPrice: $8.0 Million\n\nLike many others before it, the Mercedes-Benz Maybach Exelero is a one-off. Commissioned by Fulda, a German subsidiary of Goodyear, to test its new tires, the Exlero debuted in 2004. Mercedes built the Exelero on the bones of a Maybach, and gave it the same twin-turbo V-12 engine producing 690 horsepower and 752 pound-feet of torque. Top speed is listed at 218 miles per hour and adjusted for inflation, the Exelero would cost more than $10 million in today's money.\n\nBugatti Centodieci\n\nPrice: $9.0 Million\n\nBugatti debuted the Centodieci at last year’s Pebble Beach car week, showing off yet another ultra-rare, super-expensive model to the world. Limited to just 10—dieci—units, the car is a modern throwback to the Bugatti EB110. At the same time, it’s meant to celebrate Bugatti’s momentous 110-year anniversary. Its unique styling cues won’t make everyone fall in love, but at least you won’t have to worry about seeing another one on the road. Carrying a price just shy of $9 million, the Centodiece is one of the most exclusive cars ever made.\n\nBugatti Chiron Profilée\n\nPrice: $10.8 Million\n\nWhile it may not look that different from a normal Chiron, the Profilée is quite literally one-of-a-kind. Bugatti built it initially as a test for a limited run of Profilée models, but this Chiron ended up being the only example. Boasting the same 1,476-horsepower quad-turbocharged W-16 engine ubiquitous throughout the Chiron range, the Profilée has unique bodywork and a custom spoiler that helps separate it from the rest of the range.\n\nRolls-Royce Sweptail\n\nPrice: $12.8 Million\n\nRolls-Royce, expectedly, takes two of the top three spots on this list, with the stunning Sweptail one-off from 2017 coming in at number three. With a monumental price tag of $13.0 million, it was, at the time of its debut, the most expensive new car ever. It's been outpriced since then, but the 453-horsepower luxury car is still a jaw-dropper.\n\nBugatti La Voiture Noire\n\nPrice: $13.4 Million\n\nWith a price tag of $13.4 million, the one-off Bugatti La Voiture Noire is officially the most expensive new Bugatti ever made. And understandably so. A modern interpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal Type 57 SC Atlantic, the La Voiture Noire uses the same quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W-16 engine as the Chiron, producing 1,479 horsepower. It has six—that's right, six exhaust tips—radical new wheels, an aggressive, bespoke fascia, and a gigantic light-up badge in the rear that spells out the name of the brand. Of course, this one-of-one Bugatti already has a home.\n\nRolls-Royce Boat Tail\n\nPrice: $28.0 Million (est.)\n\nRolls-Royce is back in the business of coachbuilding with the gorgeous new Boat Tail. A successor to the stunning Sweptail from 2017—which itself cost a reported $12.8 million—the Boat Tail has a unique two-tone exterior, custom high-end finishes inside, and even a \"hosting suite\" complete with a champagne fridge and built-in sun umbrella. Although Rolls-Royce doesn’t officially announce pricing for one-off builds such as this, rumor has it that the Boat Tail cost a whopping $28.0 million new.\n\nRolls-Royce La Rose Noire Droptail\n\nPrice: $30 Million (est.)\n\nAfter last year’s lovely Boat Tail, Rolls-Royce released yet another exceptionally pricey coachbuilt car called the La Rose Noire Droptail. The Droptail debuted during Monterey Car Week as the first of four unique Rolls-Royce Droptail commissions—followed shortly thereafter by the Amethyst version—and wears a lustrous exterior color called True Love. Rolls-Royce rarely releases official pricing details on these special models, but at an estimated $30 million (some reports even suggest as much as $35 million), the new Droptail is one of the priciest cars on the planet.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat Is The Most Expensive Car In The World?\n\nThe most expensive car in the world—officially—is the Bugatti La Voiture Noire.
