        "text": "Are you looking for a new car? Want to find out more about an existing vehicle? With over 38.9 million cars licensed at the end of last year, it’s clearly a booming trade with a wide range of choice. To help you along, we’ve had a look at where the best car brands like Audi, Tesla, and more are manufactured. Read our top ten list below.\n\nTen Countries with The Best Quality Cars\n\n1. Germany\n\nGermany is famous for producing iconic cars from brands like Audi, Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. It’s particularly well-known for making vehicles that are reliable, packed with innovative features, and with popular designs to match. Their bestselling cars are from Volkswagen, with Mercedes-Benz following close behind.\n\n2. United Kingdom\n\nAre you a James Bond aficionado? Then you’ll definitely recognise the UK-manufactured Aston Martin, a car that exudes pure class. Jaguar Land-Rover is another luxury brand, based in Solihull, with the most advanced vehicle manufacturing technology in the world. Or, if you’re an F1 fan, you’ll know the name McLaren, another British manufacturer, which provides its customers with the ultimate driving experiences.\n\n3. Italy\n\nItaly is another country well-known in the industry for providing quality cars. You don’t need to look any further than Ferrari to find elegant excellence, or following in its footsteps, Lamborghini – which actually started as a tractor business! If you’re looking for more of an everyday car, Fiat can help, and even used to own Ferrari back in 2016.\n\n4. USA\n\nIf you’re after modern sophistication (and an electric car) then look no further than Tesla, which is based in California. You then have your family brand, Buick, which manufactures its cars in Michigan – though it’s worth knowing that Buick is owned by General Motors, based in China. Or, there’s Ford, who also produce their cars in Michigan, but their largest factory, the Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant, is in Missouri.\n\n5. Sweden\n\nIn Gothenburg, Sweden, you’ll find the Volvo brand – which designs cars with quality and superiority, to suit any requirements. Or, did you/do you own a Saab? Produced in Trollhättan, the Saab 900 was voted as the best car in the group. Although it seized trading back in 2011, the brand continues to work in defence and security systems.\n\n6. South Korea\n\nIf you own a Hyundai, then you’ll be happy to hear that it’s one of the leading car brands in South Korea. Their headquarters is based in Seoul, providing consumers with reliable cars daily. Another brand produced in South Korea is Kia, which falls under the same umbrella as Hyundai.\n\n7. Japan\n\nHonda, Suzuki, and Toyota, are all manufactured in Japan – so you’re sure to find a quality Japanese vehicle that suits your needs. Interestingly though, Toyota was originally a textile weaving business in the late 19th century. And, Honda developed from making motorised bicycles to executive jets in just 70 years – this brand certainly knows how to establish an eclectic mix of quality automobiles!\n\n8. India\n\nTata Motors is the largest car manufacturer in India. This brand produces a huge range of vehicles, from cars to buses – and back in 2008, they acquired Jaguar Land-Rover to add to their portfolio of motors.\n\n9. France\n\nFrance is another country with a multitude of options to choose from, including Renault, Citroen, and Peugeot. French cars offer diversity, quality (and a bit of romanticism) to suit any lifestyle, though Peugeot originally started out grinding coffee beans – now we know why French coffee tastes so good!\n\n10. Czech Republic\n\nThe most well-known car brand in the Czech Republic is Skoda. Established globally for producing quality cars, this brand represents reliability, integrity, and quality. Did you know though, that Skoda falls under the umbrella of Germany’s Volkswagen group?"
