If you’re looking to see where your car can from, the first three letters or numbers of the VIN are your clue – as these are known as the ‘World Manufacturer Identifier’ – and tells you the country of origin or final point of assembly for the vehicle, the manufacturer or region where the vehicle was produced, and the manufacturing division.\n\nThere’s a number of combinations for the WMI, although there are a number of free VIN decoders available online to give you the full breakdown of your vehicle’s information and manufacturing history.\n\nDoes it matter if your car is foreign-made?\n\nA new car is hefty purchase to make. So, it’s understandable that many are worried about driving away with a lemon. And with a shiny new car often seen as a symbol of wealth and/or success, many can feel pressured into going with what badge is on the grill rather than the inner workings of the car itself.\n\nGiven there’s plenty of competition in Australia, motorists may find that brands that were considered to be less than desirable a few years back may be exactly what you want out of a car now. As a result, it’s best to look into all of your options when it comes to buying a new car, including test driving models and looking into warranties and guarantees to ensure the wheels keep turning.
