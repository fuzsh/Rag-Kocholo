        "text": "Ferrari Tailor Made is the exclusive Ferrari programme for those customers who want to customise each element of their car for a perfect fit, creating an unmistakable, one-of-a-kind vehicle which reflects their personality and tastes.\n\nThe Tailor Made programme continues the tradition that began in Maranello back in the 1950's and grew over the years that followed. This was the era in which every car was personalized to suit each customer, with an extensive range of fabrics, leathers, woods, colors and finishes to choose from, creating truly unique, \"tailor-made\" Ferrari masterpieces to meet the requirements of the most passionate and imaginative buyers of that period. Today, the choice of materials, workmanship and color shades are unlimited, courtesy of the tireless research conducted by the Ferrari Design team in this area, using the values of the brand - passion, innovation and elegance - as a key point of reference. This expression of creativity and character leads to the creation of truly original Ferrari cars, destined to gain increasing prestige and value over time.\n\nThe customer at the heart of the creative process\n\nThe Tailor Made programme is directed at a limited number of buyers, each assisted by a team of experts led by a Personal Designer, who is tasked with ensuring that each and every element of the car is unique, whilst upholding the traditions and prestige that epitomize the Ferrari brand. The programme includes a customer visit to one of the Tailor Made centers located in the Maranello facility, Shanghai, or New York City: at these design studios, buyers can choose and touch the materials that they wish to use, selecting the samples themselves. During this meeting, the designer interprets the desires of the customer, presenting a range of potential configuration suggestions and showing a real-time virtual preview of the car.\n\nâ€‹The Tailor Made Collections\n\nThree collections are available as a starting point for the Tailor Made Programme, and each is closely connected to Ferrari's DNA: these collections - Scuderia, Classica and Inedita - reflect the sporting soul, the heritage and the innovation of the brand respectively. Ferrari customers can then take inspiration from one or more of these collections, adapting the various elements according to their tastes. Customers are given maximum freedom of choice with regard to the combinations they use, enabling an unprecedented level of exclusivity to be achieved, with a range of new solutions and innovative materials to choose from - the result of continuous experimentation and the influence of new trends from outside the automotive industry.\n\nAs part of the numerous initiatives to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Prancing Horse, the Tailor Made experience has enabled Ferrari to provide a modern take on some of the most distinctive features that have characterised seventy of the most beautiful Ferraris in history, breathing life into as many unique \"outfits\".\n\nSeventy exclusive liveries - each of which can only be used once for each of the cars in the range - serve to marry past and future, creating the icons of tomorrow.\n\nEach of the cars is easy to distinguish thanks to the exclusive 70th anniversary celebratory logo and an identification plate that bears the name of the model that inspired it."
