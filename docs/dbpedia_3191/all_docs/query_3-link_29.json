        "text": "An icon amongst icons, Ferrariâs âColomboâ V12 had it all â cutting edge technology, race wins, plus a home in the most glamorous and sought after road cars Ferrari ever built.\n\nThroughout this guide we track its star-studded life.\n\nHere at JBR Capital we love Ferraris, and we enjoy sharing this love with you. So we thought weâd put together another definitive guide, this time to the legendary V12 engine. Thereâs an awful lot to talk about, so weâve tried to cover it from all angles â factual, historical, mechanical and cultural. We very much hope you enjoy it, and if so donât forget to share it with your fellow enthusiasts.\n\nAnd if youâd like your own copy of this guide just send us your email address on the form at the bottom of this pageÂ and weâll send you a downloadable and printable PDF version. Weâre nice like that.\n\nThe History of V12\n\nIn their formative decades Ferrari actually used two very different V12 engines, often alongside one other. The physically larger one was designed by Aurelio Lampredi, but the V12 weâre focussing on here â the one that most fuelled Ferrari V12 legend â was the brainchild of Gioacchino Colombo. This was not only Ferrariâs original road car engine but it went on to power classic icons like the 250 Testa Rossa, 250 GTO and Daytona. Surely no other engine in history can match this V12âs pedigree.\n\nColombo came to Enzo Ferrariâs attention when he designed a supercharged straight-eight engine for the 1938 Alfetta 158 Grand Prix car. After WW2 Enzo took Colombo on to design him a V12 . Ferrari had long admired that layout and wanted his own cars to be V12s.\n\nWhat Colombo came up with was a lightweight silicon-aluminium 60-degree V12 engine of just 1.5 litres, using a 55mm bore and 52.5mm stroke. It would safely rev to a then-amazing 7000rpm in high compression 118bhp form. The block was short, only coming down to crankshaft centre line, and each cylinder head had a single chain-driven camshaft.\n\nAt first, cylinder heads were sealed by copper rings, not gaskets, and another quirk was the use of âhairpinâ rather than coil springs for the valves. Both ideas would later revert to traditional methods. Press-fit cast iron liners were used for the cylinders, and these had their bore centres set 90mm apart, which with such relatively narrow bores shows that Colombo had planned capacity growth from the start. In fact that original 55mm bore would later grow to 77mm before the engine block had to be modified.\n\nThis is a good point to explain how Ferrariâs model numbering system relates directly to their engines. Itâs a system they employed from the very first car, rarely deviated from and only recently dropped. Grab your calculator and divide that first engineâs 1496cc capacity by the number of cylinders. Round it up to the nearest whole number and you have the Ferrari 125, the marqueâs first production car, launched in 1947.\n\nThe following year the engine was adapted for what Enzo Ferrari was really interested in: racing. In supercharged 1.5-litre form it produced 230bhp at first, then up to 315bhp when twin camshafts were adopted. Alas, it was not enough to bring success. So Enzo Ferrari turned to Lampredi for a normally aspirated 3.3-litre V12 in 1950, at which point Colombo fell out with Ferrari and returned to his old job at Alfa Romeo. He was replaced by his old mentor from Alfa, Vittorio Jano, who continued to develop Colomboâs design until his death in 1965 at 74 years of age.\n\nDERIVATIVES & DEVELOPMENTS\n\nBefore he left, Colombo was responsible for the V12âs first capacity increases, swiftly taking it to 1995cc for the Ferrari 166 using a 60mm bore and the 58.8mm stroke measurement that would remain in used until 1967 â until then the engine continued to grow all the way to 3.3 litres on just bore increases. Colomboâs final input was to stretch the bore to 65mm for the 1950 Ferrari 195S, displacing 2431cc and now developing 160bhp at 7000rpm.\n\nFurther development in Colomboâs absence first saw a short-lived 2562cc using 68mm bores, then the capacity that stuck for a long time, the 2953cc that fell nicely into the sub-three-litre category used in sports car racing. That used a 73mm bore and was perhaps the engineâs greatest incarnation, appearing not only in the Testa Rossa, in which it almost became the first normally aspirated road engine to develop the almost mystical 100bhp per litre, but also the 250 GTO, where in competition form it was putting out as much as 300bhp. All this necessitated a little strengthening, so main bearings were enlarged from 55m to 60mm, extra cylinder head bolts were added and the con-rods were redesigned.\n\nThe original blockâs biggest stretch was in 1960 for the 400 Superamerica. That went all the way to 3967cc with a 77mm bore and 71mm stroke. If you whip the calculator out again and divide that capacity by 12 youâll also see that this should really have been the 330, not 400, but in this case they were persuaded that the latter, based on the four litres, was more marketable in America. It was a rare occurrence.\n\nThe same 77mm bore was then combined with the old 58.8mm stroke for the 275 range of cars, the 275GTB/4 becoming the first Ferrari road car to have twin-camshaft cylinder heads. These aided breathing and gave the engine much greater torque and flexibility.Â With an eye to the future and larger capacities the block was lengthened by four inches in 1964 to allow bore centres to be moved from 90mm to 94mm apart.\n\nThe first of these engines used the 77x71mm bore/stroke measurement from the 400, but in the now (for Ferrari tradition) correctly named 330 GT series. In Ferrari circles these are referred to as âlong blockâ engines and the previous ones âshort blockâ, naturally. Three years later they took proper advantage of the âstretchâ and created a 4.4-litre engine with an 81mm bore for the 365 series of cars. The king of these, helped by the reappearance of the twin-cam heads, was the 365 GTB/4 âDaytonaâ, a proper 175mph supercar.\n\nIncreasing the stroke to 78mm gave useful extra torque for the heavyweight 400 GT, which was upgraded from carburettors to fuel injection to become the 400i in 1979. The final roll of the dice for the Colombo engine was an extra 1mm of bore to turn the 400 into the 4942cc 412 in 1985. The Colombo V12 finally ceased production in 1989.\n\n166 Inter & MM\n\nEighteen months after completing their first racer cam Ferrariâs first official road car, the 166 Inter, launched in November 1948 at the Turin motor show. That makes them serious collectors pieces, especially as only 38 were built, and they rarely change hands. Most were coupÃ©s with bodies by Touring, though other coachbuilders like Vignale supplied bodies and Farina did four drop-top cabriolets. They were built alongside the 166 MM â the initials being for Mille Miglia to celebrate a Ferrariâs victory in the 1948 race. Thatâs the clue that this was a serious racing model, mostly open cars with scant Perspex windscreens, though many were later adapted for road use when they were no longer competitive on track. Their two-litre engines were tweaked to offer 25bhp more than the same unit in the Inter, whose figures are quoted below. A total of 46 MMs were built over a five-year run and they command values five or six times higher than Inters.\n\nEngine 1995cc 105-115bhp Top speed 112mph 0-60mph\n\n195 Inter\n\nThe one-year-only 195 Inter first appeared in late 1950 of early 1951, depending on which source you believe. It isnât even clear exactly how many were built, though the best estimate is around 25. All were coupÃ©s, mostly with sleeker styling than the 166 Inter, from the hands of coachbuilders Vignale and Ghia, though Touring also produced a trio with similar bodywork to the earlier car. The big change was under the bonnet, where the V12 had been bored out to 2.3 litres, bringing a chunk more power. That output quoted below was for the standard model with a single twin-choke Weber 36 DCF carburettor, though a triple-carb option was also offered for a more sporting output. The rest of the drivetrain remained the same. There was also a 195 S racing version, though details on that are even more sketchy and several marque experts believe that only one was built.\n\nEngine 2341cc 135bhp Top speed 112mph 0-60mph\n\n212 Inter\n\nThe 195 Inter was short-lived because Ferrari were quick to increase the V12âs capacity, this time to 2.6 litres, creating the 212 Inter, launched amid the glamour of the 1951 Paris Motor Show. As before there was also a competition version, this time named âExportâ. Around 26 of those were made, along with 84 Inters in just over a year, so Ferrari was at last getting production numbers for their rolling chassis up to match the growing demand brought by the marqueâs competition successes. An even larger number of coachbuilders âcarrozzeriaâ weighed in this time â five of them, with a variety of bodies too numerous to cover here. Most were coupÃ©s though, with just 14 open cars included in the above figure.\n\nThe larger engine brought a 15 per cent increase in power, which in turn gave Ferrari some serious figures to shout about. The 212âs top speed really was eye-catching in an era when people still saw 100mph as a magic number. In a few short years since its launch, Ferrari had made its name and was ready for big things.\n\nEngine 2563cc 155-170bhp Top speed 120mph 0-60mph 10.5secs\n\n340 America\n\nLaunched around the same time as the 212 Inter, the 340 took Ferrari up to another level with its 4.1-litre engine. It was the first time this particular V12 was used in a road car. Completely unrelated to previous Ferrari engines, it was a downsized version of Aurelio Lamprediâs new 4.5-litre Grand Prix car unit, the â340â â as had become the Ferrari tradition â being the individual cubic capacity in ccs of each of the engineâs 12 cylinders.\n\nSource of the carâs âAmericaâ tag has been lost in the mists of time, like so much from this period of Ferrari history, but is widely believed to point to where the company wanted and expected to sell its big-capacity cars.\n\nAlso unconfirmed is the exact number of 340s built, but is was somewhere around 25, with a rough half-and-half split between open and closed bodies. One of the latter was driven to victory in the 1951 Mille Miglia by Gigi Villoresi. The car was described as a real monster in the wet, adding further to the Prancing Horse legend.\n\nEngine 4101cc 220bhp Top speed 136mph 0-60mph n/a\n\n250 Europa/GT Europa\n\nAlso sometimes referred to as SI and SII Europas, these were in fact two quite different cars, joined together by their name and similar appearance. Even their engines â though both nominally of the three-litre capacity that would serve most Ferrari road cars for the next decade â were completely different. The first Europa, launched in 1953, used a small-bore version of the 340âs Lampredi V12. It also had a much stronger chassis than previous cars, and a longer wheelbase too: 2800mm. Eighteen were built, all but two bodied by Pinin Farina, now establishing themselves as Ferrariâs coachbuilder of choice.\n\nA year later at the Paris Motor Show Ferrari presented what looked like a small update to go with the addition of âGTâ to the carâs name. Under the skin, however, was an all-new chassis with a shorter (2600mm) wheelbase, at last with coil springs for the front suspension in place of the previous transverse leaf arrangement, vastly improving the carâs handling. The engine was a big-bore version of the Columbo-designed V12 used in the Inter models â smaller, lighter and freer-revving than the Lampredi unit. This time 36 were built, all coupÃ©s and all but one by Pinin Farina.\n\nEngine 2963/2953cc 200/220bhp Top speed 135-143mph 0-60mph 5.9secs\n\n410 Superamerica\n\nAs well as serving the desires of their super-rich clients, who required something more number one than your everyday playboy drove, Ferrari had learned the headline-grabbing and show stand-filling potential of building cars most could only gasp at. Bring on the 410 Superamerica, which made its debut at the 1956 Brussels Motor Show. For this they bored out the larger Lampredi V12 to five litres and provided either 2800mm or 2600mm chassis. Over the next three years just 37 Superamericas were built, and itâs unlikely that any two are identical as the wants of individual buyers were incorporated in the build. At the very top of the pile sit a handful of Superfast models with space-age befinned or âAerodinamicaâ styling. For one of those you needed the term âmagnateâ on your LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe 410 Superamerica remains the preserve of the super-rich today â owning one makes the statement that you could afford five 250 GTs from the same era, but probably already have one of those in your collection too.\n\nEngine 4963cc 340bhp Top speed 165mph 0-60mph 6.6secs\n\n250 GT SWB\n\nFollowing on from the TdF in the dual-purpose road car and weekend racer role, the SWB â as those initials suggest â was built on a 200mm âshorter wheelbaseâ chassis. The bodies were in a stunning and era-defining design by Pininfarina, offered with either steel or aluminium panels â one of the latter being worth around a million pounds more than a steel car in the current market, and even those âlesserâ SWBs are valued in the Â£5.25m-Â£6.75m range. You can add even more for one of the out-and-out Competition versions, which got an extra 40bhp from their 3.0-litre engines, especially those piloted in period by notable race-drivers like Sir Stirling Moss.\n\nSo thereâs quite a bit to sort out if a 250 GT SWB catches your interest, but they are breathtaking to drive in any form and at least they were made in larger numbers than previous Ferraris â the figure is generally believed to be 153 built from 1959-62. One of the gold-standard cars among Ferrari collectors, and thereâs always another buyer waiting in the wings.\n\nEngine 2953cc 240-280bhp Top speed 155mph 0-60mph 6.4secs\n\n250 GT Cabriolet SII\n\nThis is perhaps the model for those who dream of a California Spider but canât afford the ticket. Built at the same time as the SWB Spider, at a glance the two cars look handily similar, but the Devil is of course in the detail of Pininfarinaâs styling. The Cabriolet was built on the longer-wheelbase chassis, with the less fruity engine, and was intended as more of a relaxed GT alongside the full-on sportscar Spider. So look closer and youâll see the Cabriolet has a more upright windscreen, with slim quarterlights in the doors. It also has a longer bonnet and bootlid, the latter making it easier to stow luggage for that weekend away in St Tropez or San Francisco. It also provides another instant recognition point: on the Spider the number plate sits on the panel below the bootlid; on the Cabriolet it has to be placed on the bootlid itself.\n\nAs well as lower prices â SII Cabrioletâs trade for around a tenth the price of a SWB Spider â youâll have more choice as Ferrari built around 200 of these.\n\nEngine 2953cc 240bhp Top speed 160mph 0-60mph 7.1secs\n\n400 Superamerica\n\nIt is often wrongly assumed that this was a continuation from the 410 Superamerica mentioned above; after all, they have very similar names. But though the 400 was aimed at the same super-rich clientele, this was a completely new car. It also marked a departure from the Ferrari tradition of creating model numbers from the cubic capacity in ccs of a single cylinder. That would have made this the 330 Superamerica, but 400 was chosen to represent the 4.0-litre overall capacity of this fresh development of the âColomboâ V12, and because, well, it just sounds like more and this properly set the car apart from the lesser 250 GTs.\n\nAround 47 were built from 1960 to â64, most of them with striking âAerodinamicaâ coupÃ© styling by Pininfarina, though that number also includes 11 or 12 cabriolets which are unsurprisingly very highly sought after and generally make at least 50 per cent more than coupÃ©s â on the rare occasions that they are sold.\n\nEngine 3967cc 340bhp Top speed 162mph 0-60mph 7.8secs\n\n250 GT Boano/Ellena\n\nBy 1956 Pinin Farina had struck a deal to design and build the bodies for all Ferrariâs road cars, and they produced this fresh design for the 250 GT chassis â largely the same as that under the 250 GT Europa and with the same three-litre engine. However, Pinin Farinaâs new production plant on the outskirts of Turin was still under construction and the old one was working to capacity, so construction of the bodies was handed over to Mario Boano, a former Farina employee who had set up on his own. He slightly revised the design and built 80 bodies by spring 1957 before passing the coachbuilding business and contract on to his son-in-law Ezio Ellena, explaining these modelâs unusual names. Ellena built a further 50 cars, slightly redesigned with slightly raised roof and deeper front and rear screens to improve visibility. Some enthusiasts simple refer to them as low-roof and high-roof 250 GTs. The later cars also gained a ZF steering box and an extra 20bhp for the engine; brakes were slightly uprated but still drums all round.\n\nEngine 2953cc 220-240bhp Top speed 140mph 0-60mph 7.1secs\n\n250 GT Berlinetta TdF\n\nThe initials at the end stand for Tour de France, added to celebrate Alfonso de Portagoâs win in the 1956 event of that name, though in fact never officially by Ferrari. The TdF was one of that dying breed of racecars you could drive on the road, and most of the 67 built from 1957-59 took part in some form of competition â with a great deal of successes. However, that does mean many were also damaged bodily or mechanically. Complete and unblemished paper trails histories are rare with these cars, which affects their values â they have to taken on a case-by-case basis and it would be dangerous to buy one without expert advice from someone steeped in the world of Ferraris. Particularly as those wide-ranging values are in the Â£4m-Â£6m zone.\n\nEngine 2953cc 260bhp Top speed 143mph 0-60mph 6.8secs\n\n250 GT California Spider\n\nNever mind Ferraris â the âCal Spiderâ is considered to be one of the best looking cars of all time. In this case the V12 almost comes as a bonus. With bodies styled by Pininfarina â of course â and built by Scaglietti, the first 46 Spiders were long-wheelbase (LWB) models and as the name suggests, the cars were largely aimed at the American market. Those LWB Spiders got the 240bhp version of the V12 and were built in a 14-month period from 1958-59, the â59 cars also gaining the welcome benefit of front disc brakes. Then came the crowning glory: the short-wheelbase (SWB) Spiders. Built on the 200mm-shorter chassis of the SWB coupÃ©s, they were also fitted with the higher output engine â larger Weber carburettors and a higher compression helping raise matters to 280bhp. But they remained an number one car with just another 50 built over the next two years.\n\nBy reading the above youâll know that the SWB is the most valuable of the two versions, though all Cal Spiders are the preserve of the hyper-collectors. While values of LWB cars are in the Â£5m-Â£6.5m range at 2017 prices, you are looking at more like Â£9m-Â£11m for a SWB Spider.\n\nEngine 2953cc 240-280bhp Top speed 155mph 0-60mph 7.0secs\n\n250 GT Pininfarina CoupÃ©\n\nIn Ferrari terms this was almost a mass-produced carÂ â Â theyâd previously struggled to make 100 cars a year in total â with 335 built from 1958-60, and it was designed from the outset to be easier to build that previous creations. The Pininfarina tag is a non-official one, a name extension added later to distinguish these from the Boana/Ellena coupÃ©s that preceded them. Always intended as a touring road car with no competition pretensions, the PF wore an elegant, classy, perhaps even sober suit penned by Pininfarina. So while they might not pump adrenaline either visually or from behind the wheel in the same way as other Ferraris with the 250 GT prefix, they are a whole lot cheaper â a fact that has sadly resulted in more than one being rebodied as a California Spider evocation.\n\nEngine 2953cc 240bhp Top speed 145mph 0-60mph 8.0secs\n\n250 GTE 2+2\n\nThe companyâs first production four-seater, this marked a major change in company philosophy and proved an instant success. In all 955 were sold between 1960 and â63, making this the most successful Ferrari to date. A further departure from tradition was that most were finished in classy metallic rather than the usual Rosso Corsa. Which all adds up to three reasons why Ferrari purists have always sneered at the GTE as being some kind of lesser beast â too many seats, too many built, and just not red enough. Despite that they have found a place in the collector market, with values trebling between 2009 and 2017. That has helped â once used as donor cars to restore or create more valuable Ferraris, 250 GTEs are now being restored in their own right.\n\nThey are understandably less sporty to drive. To help create cabin space without making the car too big, the engine was moved forward eight inches (200mm) in the chassis, and they weigh about 200kg more than two-seater Ferraris from the same era. But thereâs still that 240bhp V12 heart beating under the bonnet.\n\nAt the end of 1963 another 50 250 GTE bodies were fitted with 300bhp 4.0-litre V12s and sold (mostly in the US) as the Ferrari 330 GT America.\n\nEngine 2953cc 240bhp Top speed 136mph 0-60mph 8.0secs\n\n250 GTO\n\nAppropriately launched on the world in 1962 â the same year as the Fab Four â the GTO provided Ferrari with their âBeatles momentâ, a legend that would echo through the ages and still be regarded as an all-time great over fifty years later. It remains perhaps the ultimate collectorsâ car, with prices known to have touched Â£40m and rumoured to have topped Â£50m. We may never now as most deals are brokered quietly behind closed doors.\n\nThis was a car that had everything: looks to shame a Hollywood screen goddess, crafted in lightweight aluminium, a racecar engine, star drivers and a string of competition successes that included wins in the Sebring 12 Hours, twice in the Tour de France, and two Goodwood Tourist Trophy victories, the latter in 1963 with Graham Hill at the wheel. Oh, and the World GT Championship three years running. Just 39 GTOs were built between 1962 and â64, the tiny number also helping to fuel the legend.\n\nPerhaps the most famous owner is Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, who has had his, with the UK registration 250 GTO, for decades. That was a smart investment that could theoretically earn him almost as much as his musical exploits.\n\nEngine 2953cc 280bhp Top speed 174mph 0-60mph 5.9secs\n\n500 Superfast\n\nThis was the replacement for the 400 Superamerica, a limited-build car for Ferrariâs most exalted clients. As such it followed the 400âs lead in being named for its five-litre engine capacity, and had a development on Pininfarinaâs Aerodinamica styling, stretched over a slightly longer wheelbase and almost excruciatingly elegant and expensive looking. The exclusivity of course extended to build numbers â just 36 over the carâs two year run, including a surprisingly high number â eight of them â in right-hand drive.\n\nThe exclusivity extended to the engine, with its cylinder spacing, bore and stroke created especially for this car and never used in another Ferrari. A fact that does make them a little tricky, and doubtless more expensive, to rebuild. However, the 400bhp it produced did help the 500 Superfast to live up to its name.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly given all the above, the market values them at around 10 per cent less than the 400 Superamerica.\n\nEngine 4962cc 400bhp Top speed 174mph 0-60mph 7.8secs\n\n250 GT Lusso\n\nWith the 250 GTO as the track star, the 250 SWBâs replacement could be drawn as a pure road car. Pininfarina turned the taps on full and created possibly the most stunningly elegant of all 1960s GTs, and what remains one of the best looking Ferraris of all time. Itâs one of those rare cars you can look at from any angle and still feel all warm and fuzzy. The GT Lusso also marked the end of the line for the 250 series of cars which had started back in 1954. The last GT Lusso was built in August 1964 after a relatively short production run lasting just over 18 months. During that time 350 were built.\n\nThe Lusso shared the GTOâs short-wheelbase chassis, but with the engine moved forward to increase cabin space. The V12 was the usual capacity and a kind of halfway house spec between those used in the racier SWB cars and the cruising GTE 2+2. Much like the GTE, it is also common to find Lussos in other colours than red, with metallic blues of various hues really enhancing the bodyâs curves and delicate use of chrome detailing.\n\nFor many years these cars were undervalued, but proper recognition came during the post-2007 classic car boom and values for good ones are now firmly in the seven-figure range.\n\nEngine 2953cc 250bhp Top speed 149mph 0-60mph 8.0secs\n\n330 GT 2+2\n\nSuccessor to the commercially successful four-seater 250 GTE, the 330 GT 2+2 built on that, and along the way gained another distinction. A year after its 1964 launch, in February 1965, one of these became the first car of one John Lennon, ordered the very day after he passed his driving test. That car has now been restored and in May 2013 Classic Cars magazine took it back to be photographed outside Kenwood, the Weybridge, Surrey house where Lennon lived at the time.\n\nPowered by a 4.0-litre engine that significantly was larger than that in Ferrariâs two-seater offerings at the time, the 330 GT 2+2 was produced in two distinct series. The first run wore twin headlamps, the inner pair being slightly smaller, which gave the car a slight squint. They proved a little controversial, with plenty of barbed comments in the press, so it was no surprise to see the SII cars appear in mid-1965 with a more traditional single headlamp on each side. However, history tells us that Ferrari sold 625 with the twin headlamps and only 455 of the arguably prettier single-headlamp 330 GTs. Tot those up and you have the first Ferrari to top the thousand sales mark.\n\nEngine 3967cc 300bhp Top speed 150mph 0-60mph 7.1secs\n\n275 GTB & GTB/4\n\nLaunched in 1964, the 275 GTBâs body may have been a gentle and logical evolution from the 250 GTO, but it clothed a major step forward in Ferrari chassis technology. At last they had a road car with all-independent suspension (amazingly theyâd all had live axles on leaf springs prior to this), four-wheel disc brakes and a five-speed gearbox mounted in unit with the rear axle to aid weight distribution. There was a ten per cent increase in engine capacity too, and the new 3.3-litre unit came as standard with three twin-choke carbs or the option of six of them. That released an extra 20-25bhp.\n\nBodies were available in steel of aluminium, the latter now commanding a 25% price premium, and after a year they got a longer nose and smaller front grille to reduce front-end lift at speed.\n\nIn 1966 the model was further updated with a four-cam version of the engine â a Ferrari first. All these came with six carburettors and a healthy power boost right across the range. Ferrari were always improving things, but were now in a kind of arms race with their new noisy neighbours at Lamborghini.\n\nEngine: GTB: 3286cc 250-275bhp Top speed 150mph 0-60mph 6.4secs GTB/4 3286cc 300bhp Top speed 165mph 0-60mph 5.5secs\n\n330 GTC\n\nIn a way, the 330 GTC felt a bit like a step backwards, certainly in visual terms. Far less sportily aggressive than the 275 GTB/4 that continued to be sold alongside it, the GTC had in effect a fixed-roof version of the 275 GTS body, with the nose of a 500 Superfast. That looks better from some angles than others, and has certainly held these back in the value stakes â they are worth less than half what youâd pay for a 275 GTB.\n\nYou canât blame that on any lack of performance as these got a 4.0-litre version of the older single-cam-per-bank V12, kicking out the same 300bhp as the 275âs smaller four-cam unit. They also shared the new development of all-independent suspension and five-speed transaxle (rear-mounted) gearbox. And at the time the 330 was very much considered a success as Ferrari sold 600 of them in a two-year production run.\n\nEngine 3967cc 300bhp Top speed 150mph 0-60mph 6.8secs\n\n365 California\n\nThis was another of Ferrariâs âelite clienteleâ cars, and as ever was used to test new styling ideas and wow the crowds at motor shows. This time only 14 would be built, all during 1966. They replaced the 500 Superfast and were based on that carâs chassis, so unlike the rest of Ferrariâs range at the time didnât offer the advance of independent rear suspension. Most buyers would either not have noticed or worried â they were buying both exclusivity and a far more important detail: this was at the time the worldâs fastest convertible, thanks to a 4.4-litre version of the long-blockâ Colombo V12.\n\nPininfarina also pulled out all the stops on the styling, apart from the front end that was largely carried over from the Superfast â which is not a criticism. It was packed with details, like the door handles being hidden in the taped air channels carved into the carâs sides, pop-up high-beam driving lamps, and the bootlid that sat lower than the rear wing tops, a feature that Pininfarina would employ widely in the following years. This was the future; this was expensive.\n\nEngine 4390cc 320bhp Top speed 152mph 0-60mph 6.8secs\n\n365 GTB/4 Daytona\n\nNot just another Ferrari but a motoring legend from the day it appeared at the Paris Motor Show in 1968. It was both a massive leap forward for Ferrari, bearing little relation to anything that had gone before, and also an instant dinosaur. The rest of the supercar world was going mid-engined, but at this point Enzo was having none of it and kept the V12 up front. Thatâs one thing that was carried over â the 4.4-litre engine, though tuned and topped with six Weber 40DCN carburettors to release ten per cent more power than in its previous form.\n\nThe styling was by Pininfarinaâs star aerodynamicist and chief designer Leonardo Fioravanti, and even he recalls it as his favourite piece of work.\n\nTo drive, itâs a brute â more civilised racecar than laidback GT â and everything about the driving experience requires proper physical input, from the meaty pedals and gearshift to the steering wheelâs upper body workout. Itâs no wonder that many owners fit aftermarket power steering systems, which do remove some feel, but allow to drive the car a lot further. And you will want to â a Daytona is quite intoxicating. Around 1300 were built, along with just over a hundred of its soft-top brother the GTS/4 Daytona Spider. One of the great collectorsâ cars, as a rule of thumb expect to pay four times the price of a coupÃ© for one of these.\n\nEngine 4390cc 352bhp Top speed 174mph 0-60mph 5.9secs\n\n365 GTC/4\n\nLaunched at the 1971 Geneva Show, the GTC/4 was in theory a replacement for the 365 GT 2+2. In practice however, it was nothing like that car, in reality being a more civilised version of the Daytona with more up-to-date styling and just about enough room to squeeze two children in the back who were willing to suffer anything for a ride in a Ferrari. The engine was largely to Daytona spec, too, but with slightly smaller carburettors that were also side- rather than down-draft, which nipped 12bhp off the power output. On the plus side, the GTC/4 came with power steering, softer suspension â with the rear self-levelling of the 2+2 â and a delightfully lighter clutch action. They are, in short, much nicer cars to drive, which compensates for them being less visually dramatic. The deformable resin front âlipsâ in particular take a little getting used to. Then again, they are appealing enough that Sergio Pininfarina used one as his daily driver for some time.\n\nTheir other great appeal is that you can buy one for less than half the cost of a Daytona. The model only lasted 18 months, with 500 built.\n\nEngine 4390cc 340bhp Top speed 163mph 0-60mph 6.2secs\n\n275 GTS\n\nThough sold as a sister car to the GTB, and exactly the same under the skin, the GTS was not simply a drop-top version of the coupÃ©. In fact its styling was a lot closer to that of the 330 GT 2+2, which gave it a more genteel appearance. It didnât do a great deal for sales appeal and only 200 were sold â about t quarter of the total number of GTBs made, though they had a longer run. Weâll come back to that. The lower appeal has continued into the classic era, giving us the unusual situation where the open version of a model is actually worth less than the hardtop, something for which there are only a tiny handful of other examples. The difference is around 15-20%, which adds up to a tidy sum when you are dealing at seven-figure levels.\n\nThe GTS was dropped from the range in 1966 when the GTB got the four-cam engine, so there was never a GTS/4 as such, though Ferrariâs American importer, Luigi Chinetti, did order ten open-topped GTB/4 NART Spiders in 1967, though the styling of these was based on that of the coupÃ©.\n\nEngine 3286cc 260bhp Top speed 150mph 0-60mph 7.2secs\n\n365 GT 2+2\n\nHereâs one for those who like to collect useless facts: at 4974mm, this 1967 creation remains the longest road car that Ferrari has ever built. This was an (almost) full four-seater rather than the previous 2+2s, yet Pininfarina managed to contain all that and the length in a most elegant body that hid the bulk and still looked like a sports car. With almost 1.5 tonnes to move, it wasnât the quickest car around, but it had levels of luxury and technical advances that set it apart from previous Ferraris, which had largely traded on looks and muscle. The 365 2+2 got the independent rear suspension that was lacking in the California, further aided by a Koni self-levelling system, so it rode and handled well. There was also power steering, standard air-conditioning, electric windows and Connolly leather.\n\nIt ran for four years, during which time 800 of them were built. Something else that for decades was held against them by Ferrari enthusiasts. Thankfully those prejudices are now behind us and the 365 GT 2+2 has gained acceptance for what it is â one of the most stylish and driveable of all 1960s GTs. Oh, one more useless fact: it shares its door handles with the Alfa Romeo Spider.\n\nEngine 4390cc 320bhp Top speed 152mph 0-60mph 7.2sec\n\n365 GTC/GTS\n\nThe 365 GTs were short-lived stopgap models that used the bodies of the 330 GTC and GTS and standard-tune versions of the new 4.4-litre V12. In fact the only sure way to quickly tell them apart from the older model was by the engine cooling vents, now a pair set in the rear corners of the bonnet rather than the âgillsâ behind the front wheelarches used previously.\n\nIntroduced late in 1968, the GTS ran for less than a year before being discontinued when the Daytona Spider was launched in mid-1969. In that time only 20 were built, so they are highly sought after. The hardtop GTC continued on into 1970 and racked up a total of 150 examples. That relative rarity and the larger engine means they command a 15 per cent premium over 330 GTC values.\n\nEngine 4390cc 320bhp Top speed 152mph 0-60mph 6.3secs\n\n365 GT4 2+2\n\nOver a year passed before the âfamily Ferrariâ void left by the 365 GT 2+2âs demise was filled. Then at the Paris Show in 1972 they surprised us with this ultra-modern Pininfarina take on the four-door Ferrari, a shape so ahead of its time that it survived in production with only minor tweaks for 13 years. All that survived from the old 2+2 was the Alfa Spider door handles and the engineâs 4.4-litre capacity, though the rest of it was different, boasting four rather than two camshafts and six rather than three carburettors.\n\nThe carâs whole geometry was from another era to the older four-seater too, with a 164mm shorter body sat on a 50mm longer wheelbase â clever packaging that meant nothing was lost but plenty was gained in dynamics. The glass area was markedly larger too, creating an airy cabin that wanted for no luxury. That only 470 were sold over four years looks disappointing, but can be explained by Ferrari never homologating a version for the American market. They would have to wait.\n\nEngine 4390cc 340bhp Top speed 147mph 0-60mph 6.7secs\n\n400 Series\n\nThe grand 365 GT4 2+2 of 1972 had ushered in a new era of Pininfarina styling for Ferrari, eschewing traditional curves for a more angular, imposing appearance. Four years later, Ferrari felt little need to update its wedge profile when it metamorphosed the car into the 400. Debuting at the 1976 Paris Motor Show, the 400 featured new five-stud alloy wheels in place of the original knock-off hub items, plus a subtly reprofiled front spoiler and six circular tail-lamps instead of just four. Well, even Ferrari had to show restraint sometimes. The interior was also revamped. The quad-cam V12 was increased in size to 4823cc, giving 340bhp courtesy of six Weber carburettors. But the big news about this big Ferrari was the option of the marqueâs first automatic transmission, no doubt leaving many purists aghast. Fuel injection made an appearance in 1979, which dropped power down to 311bhp, but at least cleaned-up emissions so what was now the 400i could still be sold in the USA. A more comprehensive reworking came in 1982 â power swelled slightly to 315bhp, the cabin received attention and a narrower grille and more sculptured door mirrors were adopted. Production ceased in 1985.\n\nEngine 4823cc 315-340bhp Top speed 152mph 0-60mph 7.1secs\n\n456 GT, GTA and M\n\nFerrari had gone three years without a four-seater GT model when it returned to this less frenetic marketplace with the 456 in 1992. Curves were once again in vogue on this practical Pininfarina aluminium-bodied design, which had little in common with its 412 predecessor, save for its passenger capacity and a predilection for pop-up headlamps. It would turn out to be the final Ferrari to sport them. The styling doffed its hat to the Daytona, especially around the rear end, but the retro cues werenât allowed to overpower an otherwise modern appearance. That back also incorporated an electronically-activated spoiler. Rather than carry over the earlier V12, the 65 degree-angled engine took the Dino V6 unit as its inspiration, albeit in 12-cylinder form and boasting a considerable 436bhp from its 5474cc. Only the F40 had been a more powerful Ferrari. An automatic (GTA) joined the line-up in 1996, followed by the modified 456M of 1998, which boosted the bhp to 442 and made some minor interior and exterior alterations. Specials included a pair of four-door saloons, seven estate versions â six of which were bought by Prince Jefri of Brunei â and four convertibles. Manufacture finished in 2003.\n\nEngine 5474cc 442bhp Top speed 188mph 0-60mph 5.0secs\n\nF50\n\nIf the F40 had demonstrated anything, it was that Ferrari really liked to celebrate its major birthdays. And if it could come up with something as radical as the F40 to mark the start of middle age, what might it unleash for its half-century in 1995? The logically-named F50 was the answer, and while the rounded looks werenât as extreme and aggressive as the F40, it was still an eye-catching Pininfarina creation, complete with a removable hardtop for those who wanted their thrills as raw and windswept as possible. The 4699cc mid-mounted V12 was descended from the 1989-90 engines of Ferrariâs Formula One racers and the car also borrowed from motorsport with its composite construction monocoque chassis, plus an interior largely stripped of creature comforts. At 520bhp, it was monstrously powerful, able to polish off the 0-60 sprint in just 3.8 seconds and go on to a terminal velocity of 202mph. But it also gulped down fuel at less than 10mpg. Exclusivity was guaranteed, with only 349 examples made from 1995 to 1997, although there were just five colours available. Two of which were, naturally, different shades of redâ¦\n\nEngine 4699cc 520bhp Top speed 202mph 0-60mph 3.8secs\n\n412\n\nWhat a difference just 1mm makes. Thatâs how much the 400iâs engine was bored out to increase its capacity to 4943cc for 1985âs 412 model, which in turn gave 335bhp. Although the basic Pininfarina shape dating back to 1972 was retained, there were lots of subtle tweaks to freshen it up for the 1980s. These included a bigger boot, body-coloured bumpers instead of the previous black items and a deeper front spoiler, which Ferrari did opt to finish in black instead, along with the rear valance. As was the trend at the time, the side window trim also changed from chrome to black. The five-spoke alloys went from being dished to flat-faced, although they retained kept the general appearance of what had gone before. The effect was quite a successful mild facelift and one that didnât make automatic owners feel inferior to their manual-wielding counterparts, for the transmission type was no longer branded on the body. The 412 also pioneered the use of anti-lock brakes on production Ferraris. 576 412s were produced until this long-in-the-tooth GT design finally had time called on it in 1989.\n\nEngine 4943cc 335bhp Top speed 158mph 0-60mph 6.3secs\n\n550 Maranello/Barchetta\n\nMid-engined machines had dominated Ferrariâs two-seater 12-cylinder offerings since 1973 when the 550 marked a return to up-front engines in 1996. Technology now meant the layout could be made to behave as impeccably as a car with mid-mounted power, and Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine, Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter were on hand at the NÃ¼rburgring launch in July 1996 to prove it. Electronic suspension and traction systems managed the 550âs hi-tech underpinnings, concealed by a lightweight aluminium alloy body welded to a steel frame using the Feran sandwich material process. The engine was that of the 456 GT, albeit breathed upon to provide 485bhp, and mated to a six-speed transmission. Initially, the 550 â its numerical designation suffixed by âMaranelloâ in tribute to Ferrariâs home town â was only available in hardtop coupÃ© form, but at the 2000 Paris Motor Show the Barchetta roadster appeared. It was a very fair-weather car, for the flimsy soft-top it was supplied with wasnât recommended for use above 70mph. And a 550 could reach almost three times that! Some racing 550 versions were developed by private teams and dubbed the GT, GTO and GTS. The type was updated into the 575M for 2002.\n\nEngine 5474cc 485bhp Top speed 199mph 0-60mph 4.2secs\n\nEnzo\n\nIn 2002, Ferrari decided to showcase its Formula One know-how on a road car, albeit one that just 399 specially selected customers could buy for $659,330 (around Â£446,600 at the time). The Enzo Ferrari â its name needs no explanation, of course â had a very dynamic and distinctive carbonfibre body, with its chassis of the same material bolstered by aluminium in a honeycomb sandwich. Pininfarinaâs Ken Okuyama was the man responsible for designing this most dramatic-looking Ferrari since the F40, his emphasis on function rather than form. The Enzoâs mid-mounted 5999cc V12 was a completely new design, albeit enthused by F1 expertise, and packed a 660bhp punch. Its six-speed F1-style clutchless paddle gearbox shifted ratios in just 150 milliseconds â which proved rather too abrupt for some â while carbon-ceramic brakes were on hand to quickly rein this absolute monster of a car in. Production ended in 2004, when a 400th example was built and donated to the Vatican for charity. However, the FXX, based on the Enzo but intended for track days and as a development prototype, ran from 2005 to â09 and Pininfarina rebodied one Enzo in 2006 for American collector James Glickenhaus, dubbing it the P4/5.\n\nEngine 5999cc 660bhp Top speed 221mph 0-60mph 3.1secs\n\n612 Scaglietti\n\nWith its name paying tribute to Sergio Scaglietti, the coachbuilder behind some of the most stunning Ferraris of the 1950s and â60s, itâs no surprise that the four-seater 612 Scaglietti of 2004 looked to the past for some of its design cues. Although a Pininfarina creation, the Scaglietti works in Modena, now owned by Ferrari, was used to build it. What made the all-aluminium 612 particularly stand out were the side-scallops and sculptured headlamps, both clear references to the beautiful 1954 Ferrari 375 MM that director Roberti Rossellini commissioned wife Ingrid Bergman. And if it was good enough for Casablancaâs Ilsa Lundâ¦ However, a very modern touch was the panoramic electrochromic glass roof. The engine, placed as far back as possible under the long bonnet, was that of the 575, although Ferrari couldnât resist upping power to 533bhp. Before manufacture finished in 2011, 3025 examples had been built. Specials included the 2006 30th Anniversary Edition (20 built for Japan), the Giugiaro GG50 concept of the same year, the 2007 Sessanta (a 60th birthday model, limited to 60 units) and a single 612 Kappa. There was even a police variant, which toured Britain during 2007 and probably terrified criminals.\n\nEngine 5748cc 533bhp Top speed 199mph 0-60mph 3.8secs\n\n575M Maranello\n\nPininfarina gently wafted its styling pencil over the 575M Maranello of 2002, just doing enough to give the original 1996 550 design a new lease of life through to its 2006 replacement. A new front spoiler, redesigned headlights and some minor aerodynamic flourishes were all that was needed outside, although inside, the cabin was refreshed. It was under the skin where the real evolution took place, with bigger brakes, more electronics to control the suspension, and most significantly of all, a bigger front-mounted V12. At 5748cc, the muscle now exceeded 500 horses, maxing out at 515bhp. An F1-style gearbox was also part of the spec too, although if required a conventional manual six-speeder could be had instead. The result was a car that felt much sportier than its predecessor, yet still managed to be practical and luxurious. Owners could also customise styling and accessories using the Carrozziere Scaglietti Personalisation Programme, while the GTC handling package focused on performance and handling. Uprated motorsport-standard brakes, a tweaked suspension and exhaust, and special 19in wheels were part of that option. Zagato built a single 575 GTZ in 2006 to theatrically commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 250.\n\nEngine 5748cc 515bhp Top speed 202mph 0-60mph 4secs\n\nSuperamerica\n\nYou donât need to be too clever to work out which international market Ferrari was aiming this 2005 model at. The marque revived a name it had last used during the 1950s and â60s, for an al fresco version of the 575M. The new kid on the block became a convertible in a rather novel way; the electrochromic glass roof rotated through 180 degrees to lie flat on the boot between the two rear pillar buttresses when open air motoring was called for. The whole process took a just a few seconds and was guaranteed to draw a crowd. Strategically placed hinging meant the bootlid could be cleverly opened even with the roof back. Additional strengthening to maintain body strength called for more engine power, so the Superamerica had a 533bhp version of the 575Mâs 5748cc V12. That allowed a top speed of 199mph, meaning that Ferrari could confidently boast it was the fastest convertible in the world. That convinced 599 customers to purchase one during the two years the model was available.\n\nEngine 5748cc 533bhp Top speed 199mph 0-60mph 4secs\n\n599 GTB Fiorano\n\nCarrying on the new game of adding names to their model numbers, Ferrari paid tribute to their 34-year-old Fiorano test track with the 599 GTB. As so often with a Ferrari, when the new model arrived in 2006 it didnât just replace the outgoing 575M, it eclipsed it.\n\nOnce again the model number referred to the engine capacity divided by ten, but that small increase in capacity was just part of a raft of improvements that saw output jump by 105bhp. To help contain all that power everything else under the skin was upgraded too: a new magneto-rheological suspension system, improved traction control, a tougher and faster-reacting gearbox with optional steering wheel controls and a multi-display unit with F1-style data readouts. This was the perfect super-swift Grand Tourer for the new millennium.\n\nThe styling was equally radical. With more of wedge profile, smaller side windows and dramatic slashes and scoops breaking up the bodylines, the Fiorano screamed speed and aggression. Park one alongside a 575M and the older car suddenly seems a little too pretty and polite. There was a new kid in town.\n\nEngine 5999cc 612bhp Top speed 205mph 0-60mph 3.7secs\n\nFF\n\nThis marked Ferrariâs return to the four-seater GTs that Enzo was so fond of, but with a twist or two. The first of these was the three-door sports shooting brake styling â kind of how BMW must have wished their Z3M CoupÃ© had turned out. And just like the FF that Jensen used to build, those initialsÂ â standing for âFerrari FourâÂ âannounced this as Ferrariâs first four-wheel drive production car. Not just any old 4WD set-up either, but their own patented intelligent 4RM system that is around 50 per cent lighter than conventional system and can be engaged when needed from a steering wheel control. The rest of the time the car runs in regular rear-drive mode with a seven-speed semi-automatic gearbox.\n\nIt was announced as the worldâs fastest four-seater and cost Â£227,000 in the UK. Even with that price tag Ferrari still sold 800 in 2011, the first year of production.\n\nDespite its blistering performance the interior is more luxury than sports car, and the ride is superb thanks to a third generation version of the companyâs magneto-rheological suspension system.\n\nEngine 6262cc 650bhp Top speed 208mph 0-60mph 3.7secs\n\nLaFerrari\n\nSometimes building the worlds most desirable supercars isnât enough; you need the cache and media buzz that comes from producing what we can only describe as a hypercar. The LaFerrari proved that the guys in Modena still had it. Where do we start? Perhaps with the carbon-fibre monocoque developed by F1 technical director Rory Byrne. Thereâs more F1 influence in the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) technology that adds bursts of an extra 161bhp to the already outrageous midmounted 789bhp V12 engine.\n\nA further shock is to discover that this is the first Ferrari since 1973âs 308 GT4 to be designed without input from Pininfarina, it being an in-house project led by Ferrariâs design director Flavio Manzani.\n\nStarting in 2013, just 500 were built, along with 209 open-topped Aperta models from 2016. The list price was Â£999,999. Donât expect them to depreciate far from there. As instant collectibles, few will rack up many miles, which is a shame as CAR magazine said of it, âThe most outrageous front-end response this side of a pitwall. It makes the McLaren P1 feel almost ordinary.â\n\nEngine 6262cc 789bhp* Top speed 219mph 0-60mph 2.9secs\n\n(*plus short bursts of up to 161bhp more from F1-style KERS system)\n\nF12 Berlinetta\n\nIn a world where every car is larger than the one it replaces, Ferrari welcomely bucked the trend in 2012 with the F12. In every dimension â length, width and height â it was smaller than the 599 Fiorano it replaced, yet roomier inside. It was a lot more powerful too, thanks to a tweaked version of the FFâs 6.3-litre V12.\n\nThe body was equally hi-tech, using a spaceframe chassis clothed in 12 different aluminium alloys. It came out a similar weight to the 599 but with improved weight distribution including a lower centre of gravity. Not that it matters greatly to most Ferrari owners, but the new engine is also cleaner and offers a 30 per cent improvement in fuel consumption over the 599. I suppose we all have to tighten our belts at some point.\n\nUnsurprisingly it uses the same seven-speed semi-auto âbox and suspension system as the FF, but the F12 does have some clever aerodynamic tricks. Thanks to plenty of F1 wind tunnel time, at 120mph it develops a meaningful 123kg of downforce â 76% more than the 599.\n\nFerrari also produced a run of ten roadster versions in 2014 called the F60 America. All had been sold even before they were revealed to the public.\n\nEngine 6262cc 730bhp Top speed 211mph 0-60mph 3.1secs"
