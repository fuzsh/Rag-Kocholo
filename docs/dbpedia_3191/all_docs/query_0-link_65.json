        "text": "Ferrari has opened its e-building. The new plant will build sports cars with combustion engines and hybrid drives as well as Ferrari's first electric model.\n\n×\n\nFerrari's new e-building has been built on an area of around 42,500m² to the north of the Ferrari Campus, where Ferrari models with all types of drive will be produced in future. The production and development of combustion engines, hybrid drives and the new electric motors in one place increases the Italian sports car manufacturer's flexibility. Components required for the electric sports car, such as high-voltage batteries, electric axles and electric motors, are also produced there. System technology is located in the basement of the 25 m high building, with vehicle assembly and logistics on the first floor. A mezzanine floor is intended for general facilities and offices, while the assembly of vehicles, motors and components takes place on the upper floor.\n\nErgonomic workstations, relaxation areas and acoustic and visual comfort will ensure the well-being of the more than 300 employees in the e-building, who will be trained to work with digital twins and collaborative robots. A photovoltaic system with 3,000 solar panels on the roof will provide 1.3 MW of energy. This means that Ferrari will probably be able to switch off the combined heat and power plant previously operated in Maranello at the end of the year. A 200m³ basin is available for rainwater treatment and there is also a 1,000m³ retention basin for heavy rainfall."
