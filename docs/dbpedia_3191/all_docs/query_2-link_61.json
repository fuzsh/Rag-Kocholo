        "text": "Not by chance is the area surrounding Bologna known around the world as “Motor Valley”. Indeed, along the Via Emilia, an area of just 50 square kilometres contains an exceptional concentration of famous automotive companies: from Ferrari and Lamborghini to Maserati and Ducati, in addition to the Imola and Modena race tracks.\n\nFollow this route in an adrenaline-packed journey from Imola to Modena, taking in the most important factories and museums in the sector.\n\nWe set off from the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, one of the most famous race tracks in the world, where the most important Italian racing events are held, including the recent return of Formula 1. As well as hosting major live music events in summer, the Museo Checco Costa is located here, packed with automotive exhibits.\n\nFrom Imola we move on to Bologna, or more precisely Borgo Panigale, home of Ducati Motor Holding. Here at the Ducati Museum you can relive the most important moments in the history of the company and its racing division, with its history-making bikes. You can also take a factory tour of the plant and see the production lines of the most popular current models in person.\n\nHeading back out of Bologna we run into another great name in motoring history, Lamborghini. In Funo, the Museo Ferruccio Lamborghini museum offers a tour incorporating legend, history and innovation dedicated to the founder of the House of the Raging Bull. Here, amongst cars, tractors and helicopters, the industrial genius who created one of the most famous brands in the world of supercars is celebrated.\n\nA little further west, in Sant’Agata Bolognese, the roar of modern Lamborghinis dominates the area – they are manufactured here and displayed in the Automobili Lamborghini museum. The company's most beautiful cars, from the Miura through to the Huracán, are on display here at the museum, and can be visited in conjunction with a factory tour to provide a unique and unmissable experience for all petrolheads.\n\nMoving on to Modena and we find arguably the most famous brand in motor racing history, Ferrari, whose headquarters and museum are located in nearby Maranello: here you can experience the world of the Prancing Horse, with the company's road, track and Formula 1 models, accompanied by simulators and temporary themed exhibitions. Museo Enzo Ferrari is in Modena itself, on the other hand – a futuristic structure which envelops the birthplace of Enzo Ferrari, the \"Drake\", founder of the eponymous company.\n\nMaserati – although originally founded in Bologna – also has its headquarters in Modena. The well-known luxury car brand allows visitors to visit the showroom and take part in a factory tour."
