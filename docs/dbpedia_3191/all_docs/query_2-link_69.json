        "text": "At duPont REGISTRY, our knowledge of luxury automobiles is unmatched. Over time, we’ve seen stunning vehicles, both old and new, emerge from the world of luxury car manufacturing and, with them, similarly stupefying price tags, ostensibly in keeping with the perfection of design and engineering that accompanied them. In light of this, we’ve put together what is quite possibly the most rigorous selection out there that features the 25 most expensive cars in the world, going strictly by their original market prices and not by the tens of millions that many of them bring in at the auction block or in private sales.\n\nOur list includes some of the world’s best-known and most desirable carmakers, makers at the top of their game. From Ferrari’s engineering to Bugatti’s technology, Koenigsegg’s design to Rolls-Royce’s luxury, and Pagani’s art, these brands represent the pinnacle of road cars in terms of luxury and performance. These brands have defined luxury and exclusivity for many years, and their vehicles have set the benchmark for what is possible in luxury cars.\n\nWhat’s the most expensive car in the world? Just search this page, which compiles all current list holders for this record: a collection that almost certainly includes the latest cars to incite such fantasies, expanding the parameters of opulence and price for automobiles sold today. You will find the most expensive vehicle in the world right on this page. While these aren’t the fastest 0 to 60 mph cars in the world or the cars with the fastest quarter mile times, there are some insanely quick cars, as well as some that take opulence to another level.\n\nScroll down now to immerse yourself fully in an exclusive journey through ultimate automotive extravagance!\n\n25. Ferrari F60 America\n\nPrice: $2.6 million\n\nThe F12berlinetta-based F60 America was a Ferrari built to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Ferrari’s U.S. operations. It was released on 10/10/14, and with only ten examples produced, it did so quite auspiciously. With an open-top, a V12 good for 730 horsepower, and a gorgeous blue color scheme reminiscent of the historical NART livery, what more could an American Ferrari lover want?\n\n24. Aston Martin Valkyrie\n\nPrice: $2.6 million\n\nLike Mercedes-AMG did with the One, Aston Martin poured all their Formula One knowledge, experience, and engineering talent into the Valkyrie, and what resulted is a truly formidable car that looks the part as well. A Cosworth-developed V12 is matched by exterior design and stance that makes the Valkyrie look like it could pounce at any moment, and it can.\n\n23. Ferrari LaFerrari FXX-K Evo\n\nPrice: $2.7 million\n\nWe thought that Ferrari pushed its limits with the LaFerrari, being a hybrid hypercar in the Holy Trinity, but when they turned the LaFerrari into the track-only FXX-K, we were proved wrong. Only 40 units were produced, and all are kept by Ferrari to let their owners drive for track day events, which is a good thing because only Ferrari could keep a 1,036 horsepower car capable of 217 mph truly safe.\n\n22. Koenigsegg Jesko\n\nPrice: $2.8 million\n\nAnyone with the privilege of opening the “dihedral synchro-helix” doors of a Koenigsegg knows that something incredibly powerful (and costly) lies inside. This couldn’t be truer than in the case of the Jesko, as it seems that with each passing year, Koenigsegg’s capabilities get even more outlandish and unprecedented. With up to 1,603 horsepower, a top speed that we don’t even know yet, and creature comforts like power-adjustable seats and Apple CarPlay, the Jesko might be the best Koenigsegg yet.\n\n21. Ferrari Pininfarina Sergio\n\nPrice: $3 million\n\nA tribute to design house Pininfarina’s late former chairman, Sergio Pininfarina, this 458-based Barchetta is a beautiful tribute to the spirits of both Ferrari and Pininfarina alike. Pininfarina’s signature sweeping lines make the car into an ultra-futuristic, sculpted, and serene vehicle, with design elements that echo the iconic Ferrari Pininfarina Mythos concept of the 90s. Such an artful statement is surely worth its price.\n\n20. Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport\n\nPrice: $3.3 million\n\nBugatti calls it “the purest Bugatti Chiron ever.” Substantial improvements in the chassis, gearbox, and engine back that claim up. For the onlooker, styling cues like the number on the grille echo Bugatti’s rich and proud racing heritage. If you want a Bugatti that strives to achieve the pinnacle of driving experience, the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport is likely your best bet.\n\n19. Mansory Vivere Bugatti Veyron\n\nPrice: $3.4 million\n\nMansory is a German coachbuilder known for making some of the most exciting, rare, luxurious, and expensive cars we’ve ever seen. One of their greatest efforts is the Vivere Bugatti Veyron, which is a modified Veyron that features a signature “V” design throughout and an impossibly classic black-and-white color scheme. Few cars match its price, but even fewer match its level of sophistication.\n\n18. W Motors Lykan Hypersport\n\nPrice: $3.4 million\n\nThis car became quite notorious when it was seen skyscraper-hopping in Fast and Furious 7, but the Lykan Hypersport is a notorious exotic car in itself. Having doors that are somehow both suicide and scissor doors, holographic interior display, and literal diamonds in the headlights, W Motors didn’t even need a movie to get people talking about the Lykan.\n\n17. Pagani Huayra Roadster BC\n\nPrice: $3.5 million\n\nIt is meant to be the last Pagani Huayra, and that’s no surprise because it’s a car fit for a grand finale. Only 40 examples exist, and they are as gorgeous as they are powerful. A bright silver, black, and red color scheme with tan leather seats and a distinctive wood shift knob give the car the elegant, sporty look that only the best in the automotive world can offer. A removable carbon-fiber hardtop that makes the Roadster only 66 pounds heavier than it’s coupe counterpart adds bite to the Huayra BC Roadster’s bark, doing the model justice as it bows out.\n\n16. Lamborghini Sian\n\nPrice: $3.6 million\n\nThe Sian is Lamborghini’s most innovative effort yet, with a hybrid system that uses lithium-ion supercapacitors to its advantage, making for a hybrid that doesn’t compromise weight for immense power. Drivers can expect 819 horsepower, 2.8 seconds to reach 60 mph, and a top speed of over 220 mph. And with design inspiration coming from the Countach, even at a glance, the Sian is unmistakably iconic.\n\n15. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ and Chiron Super Sport\n\nPrice: $3.9 million\n\nIt’s human nature to try to improve, to test the limits of whatever is in front of you. But nobody has done that quite like Bugatti for the past 15 or so years. They changed the world when the Veyron was found to be capable of 253 mph, and now they are changing the world again because the Chiron Super Sport 300+ can speed above 300 miles per hour. The price can easily be justified for the chance to travel at that velocity alone.\n\n14. Lamborghini Veneno\n\nPrice: $4.5 milion\n\nThe Lamborghini, packed full of incredible innovation and stirring design, is surely worth all the hype and all the money, not least because it was a clear symbol to the world that Lamborghini had entered a new era. Squeezing 740 brake horsepower out of the Aventador’s V12 was the first part of the equation, with an entirely new but still very Lamborghini body design that was optimized for cooling and aerodynamics to follow. The Veneno was and is one of Lamborghini’s greatest icons.\n\n13. Bugatti Bolide\n\nPrice: $4.6 milion\n\nThe Bugatti Bolide is what happens when one of the world’s most historic automakers goes all out for the sake of performance. When it was first revealed, Bugatti had planned for this hypercar only to be a study project, but later on, they decided on a production run of 40 Bolide examples. The Bugatti Bolide is such a special car, in fact, that it was duPont REGISTRY’s November 2021 cover car. Each of these examples comes with a price tag of our million euros, or around $4.6 million USD.\n\n12. Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita\n\nPrice: $4.8 million\n\nThe name “Trevita” is Swedish for “three whites,” which is what describes the Trevita’s completely unique and gorgeous finish. For this car, Koenigsegg developed a completely unique carbon fiber diamond weave to create its look. Because of how difficult this process was, only two Trevitas ended up being made, one of which was entrusted to Floyd Mayweather. It takes quite the car to justify that price, and the CCXR Trevita does the job.\n\n11. Bugatti W16 Mistral\n\nPrice: $5 million\n\nThe new Mistral will be the last of the W16-powered Bugatti road-going models, marking an end to an era. Because of this, the Bugatti W16 Mistral will certainly be a collector’s car for decades to come. For those who got in early and purchased one of the 99 examples planned in the production run, the starting price was set at just over $5 million. It should be noted that all of those 99 examples were already sold when the Mistral was revealed in August 2022.\n\n10. Pagani Huayra Imola\n\nPrice: $5.4 million\n\nThe Huayra Imola is a car entirely dedicated to speed. Pagani even developed a special paint to finish the car in that saved 11 pounds of weight, achieving a dry weight of just 2,747 pounds. Combine that with 827 horsepower, and you end up with a car that is just about as formidable, unique, and extravagant as anything can get on the road.\n\n9. Bugatti Divo\n\nPrice: $5.9 million\n\nAs if Bugatti’s offerings weren’t serious enough, the Divo is just about as serious as any of their cars have ever gotten. While Bugattis are known for being cars that reach incredible speed in a straight line, the Bugatti Divo is also meant to dominate in the corners. And with an elongated, more aerodynamic body, increased downforce, and 1.6 Gs of lateral acceleration, that’s exactly what it does. With Bugatti always being at the forefront of performance, we had no clue that things could take a turn for the better.\n\n8. Pagani Huayra Codalunga\n\nPrice: $7.4 million\n\nJust five examples of the new Pagani Huayra Codalunga will be created, so seeing one of the world’s most expensive cars out on the road will be a rare event. This new model was created to be a tribute to the racing cars of the 1960s that were defined by the shapes created by the classic Italian coachbuilders. The most notable exterior feature of the Huayra Codalunga is the Long Tail, which houses a twin-turbo V12 engine that produces 840 horsepower.\n\n7. Bugatti Centodieci\n\nPrice: $9 million\n\nThe Bugatti Centodieci is an homage to a modern classic: the EB110. The 200+ mph icon of the 90s, combined with Bugatti’s body of work today, can only make for a truly amazing, one-of-a-kind, and inherently expensive car. There will only be 10 of these, which is unfortunate because nostalgia isn’t the only reason the Centodieci is amazing. It improves upon the Chiron, shedding nearly 45 pounds and adding downforce.\n\n6. Bugatti Chiron Profilée\n\nPrice: $10.8 million\n\nThe Bugatti Chiron Profilée came into the world as a one-off creation that would be the final Chiron to be created featuring the legendary W16 engine. While the Chiron Profilée did not have an MSRP, it was auctioned off by RM Sotheby’s for an astonishing $10.8 million. That was enough to make the Chiron Profilée the most valuable new car ever to be sold at auction. That’s why it deserves to sit on this list.\n\n5. Rolls-Royce Sweptail\n\nPrice: $13 million\n\nThe Sweptail’s defining feature and namesake is the tapered rear end, which evokes a yacht and the pure pleasure and luxury that only a Rolls-Royce can offer. With a glass roof that extends from front to back and wood and leather decorating nearly every interior surface, the Sweptail is just like a yacht, but maybe even better; hence, it is priced like one.\n\n4. Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta\n\nPrice: $17.5 million\n\nThe Pagani Zonda is a car we know to be epic and historic in the world of supercars. Its completely distinct look, formidable Mercedes-Benz 7.3 liter V-12, and outstanding performance have made it a classic and a legend. That makes a car like the HP Barchetta the perfect way to do it justice. As if the Zonda wasn’t eye-catching enough, the HP Barchetta features rear wheels that are partially covered by a carbon fiber panel and a roofless (and almost windshield-less) body design, hence the Barchetta name, making it truly deserving of the title of being one of the most expensive cars of all time.\n\n3. Bugatti La Voiture Noire\n\nPrice: $18+ million\n\nThis one-of-a-kind Bugatti, known as La Voiture Noire, pays homage to the legendary Type 57 Atlantic from Bugatti’s illustrious past. Designed to capture the Atlantic’s elegance, mystery, and aura, La Voiture Noire represents a contemporary reimagining of what many consider the perfect car. It features distinctive design elements reminiscent of the Atlantic, such as six exhaust tailpipes and a pronounced dorsal seam that runs the length of the vehicle, splitting it down the middle.\n\nLa Voiture Noire stands out for its breathtaking design and engineering excellence, making it one of the most expensive cars in the world. Its allure comes from its aesthetic beauty and technical prowess, reflecting Bugatti’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of automotive design and performance.\n\n2. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail\n\nPrice: $28 million\n\nThe Rolls-Royce Boat Tail, an exquisite creation by Rolls-Royce Coachbuild, is among the most expensive cars in the world. It draws inspiration from the grace and elegance of nautical design. This automotive marvel is distinguished by its Caleidolegno veneer on the “Aft Deck,” a wrap-around windscreen, and numerous other maritime-inspired details. One of its most notable features is the rear compartment that transforms into a sophisticated hosting suite, perfect for luxurious al fresco dining experiences.\n\nFurther enhancing its exclusivity, the Boat Tail includes two custom-made BOVET 1822 reversible timepieces, which can either be worn or mounted on the dashboard as clocks. This level of customization and detail underscores Rolls-Royce’s commitment to unparalleled luxury. The Boat Tail made a significant impact with its debut at the prestigious Concours d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, setting a new standard for bespoke automotive luxury and craftsmanship.\n\n1. Rolls-Royce Droptail\n\nPrice: Over $30 million\n\nThe title of the world’s most expensive new production car currently belongs to the Rolls-Royce Droptail, a masterpiece of bespoke automotive luxury. Rolls-Royce has introduced this exclusive model with only two examples so far: the Amethyst and La Rose Noire Droptails, each showcasing unique themes and unparalleled craftsmanship. The plan includes crafting four Droptail cars, with each vehicle tailored specifically to the individual preferences and desires of its owner, embodying the pinnacle of personalized luxury.\n\nThe Droptail is the spiritual successor to the illustrious Rolls-Royce Boat Tail and the Sweptail, continuing a legacy of ultra-exclusive, coachbuilt automobiles. This model reflects the highest standards of design and engineering and represents a remarkable expression of status and prestige. With its distinct silhouette and exquisite attention to detail, the Droptail sets a new benchmark for luxury, pushing the boundaries of customization in the automotive industry."
