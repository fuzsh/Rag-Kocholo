        "text": "It may be that a car brand makes more gluttony than a fresh Coke or makes you dream more of Walt Disney? That's right, it's about the Ferrari brand.\n\nFerrari, the queen of cars\n\nAlready in 2014 the Ferrari brand, made in Italy pride, had been the most popular brand in the world. In the ranking of Brand Finance, a company that since 1996, from London, draws up the rankings of the most popular brands. This is a case where popularity equals quality. A quality that has its roots in the historical past of its founder and in current events, not only as regards the well-known production of sports cars, but also as regards the well-being of its workers. Ferrari, based in Maranello, near Modena, is the biggest Formula 1 racing winner since the 50s. Enzo Ferrari (1898-1988), shy businessman and tied to his world. Pilot with big dreams. Orphaned at sixteen, \"saved\" from pleurisy, he was discharged from the front. He was one of those \"boys of '98 -'99\", the very young people who a century ago left for the trenches of the Great War.\n\nThe creation of Enzo Ferrari\n\nGrowing up in his father's workshop, he was twenty, he worked at FIAT (in Turin he met his wife) and participated in various car competitions, when the car was still the fresh futurist invention, launched on the promontory of the centuries. The instrument of the new man, destined to change the idea of ​​movement of the twentieth century. Ferrari took the \"prancing horse\" from our plane \"Red Baron\", Francesco Baracca, one of the first \"knights of the skies\". The drawing was given to him by Baracca's widow. He made it the trademark of his team (initially Alfa Romeo racing branch) and of his factory: Auto Avio Costruzioni. It was 1939, Ferrari soon converted its production into the construction of components for military aircraft, for the Second World War. Therefore the Ferrari was bombed by the Allies. After the war, a climb began in the Italian economic boom, which has led it to be today the most popular manufacturer of sports cars, the most famous international brand in the world in 2018. It has remained firmly linked to Maranello, where it has headquarters on Ferrari Museum.\n\nHow the Ferrari Factory works\n\nFerrari has 3500 employees and produces 8500 cars per year. Workers enjoy full annual check-up service for themselves and their families. They work in a bright environment, designed by great architects. Their excellent restaurant is called Il Podio, because everyone wins in Ferrari. They have green and recreational areas, complete fitness gyms. In the last year they have all had a production bonus equal to three months. This is also what, continuing in the spirit of the founder, makes the Ferrari brand great. Behind this luxury production there is in fact a group of happy workers, with high comforts available. A worldwide production model. However, a request made by the Ferrari workers concerns the establishment of crèches.\n\nNests in factories are a large social institution, very common in Germany and in the factories of the Nordic countries. And it is important to remember Ferrari's attention to workers, in a world where rights are progressively dismantled and multinationals, especially the giants of the ungoverned online market, are doing good and bad times for workers, following the path of delocalization, founded often about the exploitation of workers in countries with backward rule of law and the acceptance of unemployment in the countries of origin.\n\nThe state of rights\n\nDevelopment often did not coincide with the export of the European Enlightenment model of the rule of law, but often with the search for labor without rights, thirsting for crumbs of technical-consumer development, which, however, after years of senseless pollution and uprooting in our world , we realized that without the rights and defense of health and the environment, it is not worth it. All the more so if by once again placing countries and continents in competition. Today we are therefore perhaps going backwards, as demonstrated for example by the Audi workers in Gyor, Hungary, in the heart of Europe, who have been on strike for days. Their alternative is to agree to work twice as much, with overtime paid in installments, or to accept their replacement with robots.\n\nTo think that Henry Ford, the American pioneer of the automotive industry, when Enzo Ferrari came into the world, had written a handbook in which he considered the right pay as high as possible, the machine tool to improve man's work and not to take it away and give it some subsidy. Ford was the first to accomplish the five-day and eight-hour workweeks per day. It is hoped that these principles, observed by Ford and Ferrari, will remain and will continue to be the yardstick of good industrial brands in the future, even by the public."
