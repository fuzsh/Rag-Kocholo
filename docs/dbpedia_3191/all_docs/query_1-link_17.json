        "text": "Yes this is possible to do a Tailor Made post delivery. I know of multiple cars from other regions which have had this exact process done.\n\nThis is not the case. There are actually certain things that the dealer can install directly as it stands. This includes any Ferrari Genuine accessories which includes the carbon fiber options etc.\n\nIn the case for the Tailor Made program, it is generally speaking for much more prevalent changes such a repaint, fully reupholstored interior etc. For this, the car must be sent back to the factory. As far as I am aware, this service is reserved mainly for limited production run cars, where the original owner did not have the option to spec the car through Tailor Made in the first instance.\n\nSuch modification work would most probably be outsourced by the factory to nearby Zanasi in Maranello.\n\nMarcel Massini\n\nOther than bragging rights that the work was physically performed under the factories supervisor ( passive or directly ) I cannot think of anything short of custom body work that most / many Dealerships in the USA couldn't facilitate. And even then, rebody wouldn't be TM anyways..\n\nAs ttforcefed asked, I am interested in what it is you are wanting to have done\n\nSteve\n\nI didn't get to spec my TDF. I had a red one I traded for a Bianco Italia one - which is beautiful but you can find BI with a black and very minor red accent interior without too much trouble I think. There may very well be an exact spec out there somewhere.\n\nSo, I'm looking to spec a bold one through tailor made and I'm hoping for it to be unique without a twin.\n\nThis would include repaint, tinting carbon, and interior reupholster in a combination of colors and materials I've yet seen.\n\nI'm hoping to be able to re-spec my TDF. Reason for going TM besides unlocking all of the options available only through TM is to also get the TM badge and to have a new official options plaque that would match the car. If I had the work done locally, the plaque would say Bianco Italia over black interior, but the car would be a totally different color inside and out. Basically, I want to change the exterior colors/stripe and interior colors/materials.\n\nIt’s an awesome idea.\n\nHere’s the link for zanasi.\n\nhttps://www.zanasigroup.com/modern-car-services/\n\nI was looking at a 599 and I wanted to send it to Italy to have a manual transmission place and I asked about having the interior changed out and I was told that service was no longer available for that model although I am aware of a couple of European cars who have had that conversion done at the factory.\n\nThat said I am in awe of the idea of doing that to a TDF and would love to know if they would do it.\n\nIf it is primarily done at zanasi atelier what does that do to the provenance of the car as opposed to the factory sending it there.\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nI very recently have made that inquiry after hearing from JK101 that this is indeed a possibility. They are looking into it and will get back to me with info!\n\nThank you Steve! My local dealer Ferrari of Seattle has been amazing over the years and so I’ve got to put the inquiry through them first!"
