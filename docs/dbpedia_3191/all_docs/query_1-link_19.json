        "text": "This factory is established at a location which was chosen by the company’s founder Enzo Ferrari in 1947. The total area covered by the plant is 165,000 m2 in Maranello, Italy which produces 8400 cars and employs about 1300 workers.\n\nEvery Ferrari car takes roughly 3 months to complete. And it all begins in the foundry of the company where the most critical job of casting the engine is done. These parts are then delivered to the assembly line where 147 engines are hand-built everyday!\n\nOnce the engine is completed the two robots which are nicknamed Romeo and Juliet connects the valve mechanics of the engine and it’s the only process not done by hand.\n\nBefore arriving in the assembly line each car chassis is painted in the Ferrari’s iconic colors along with anti-corrosive layer.\n\nIn the assembly line each car frame is held by individual mechanical lifts made from steel hooks to move the vehicle from one station to the next, automatically adjusting the height and rotating the chassis for the next task.\n\nAt the start of the assembly line, all of the electrical components are installed in the vehicle. Next, the wheels and bumpers are hand-installed, followed by the windshield. Then, the interior is trimmed to fit each Ferrari, ensuring your seat, sunroof, and any special touches are unique to your vehicle.\n\nThe doors of all Ferraris are made from aluminum, and are pressed and cut at the Scaglietti factory in nearby Modena, 22km from Ferrari’s main facility. The doors are only attached to a completed car body once it has reached the end of the production line.\n\nFinally, technicians perform a static engine test — the first of many tests to ensure your new Ferrari is ready for the road.\n\nLearn more on : www.ferrari.com"
