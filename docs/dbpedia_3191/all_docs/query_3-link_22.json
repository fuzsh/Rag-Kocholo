        "text": "Article content\n\nThere are automotive brands, and then there is Ferrari. Even on the playground, it’s a name that comes out in hushed and reverent tones. Ferraris are so far above the realm of ordinary cars that they don’t even really need to bother coming up with decent names for their current road cars (the 812 Superfast? Not very imaginative, paisans).\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nDon't navigate the car buying road alone!\n\nJoin our thriving community on social media and connect with other car searchers and enthusiasts.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\n3 Non-Ferrari cars that got Ferrari engines, and 3 that didn't Back to video\n\nPart of the reason for the company’s success is its ability to fan the flames of past glory, and then monetize the reflected glow. Is the cheapest Ferrari more than you can afford, pal? No problem: just get yourself a Ferrari hat, Ferrari jacket, Ferrari travel mug, Ferrari LEGO set, Ferrari socks, Ferrari luggage, or a pair of Scuderia Ferrari gaming headphones by Thrustmaster. Yes, that’s a real thing. As Mel Brooks says in Space Balls: “Moichandising!”\n\nThe same thing happens in the automotive world, where some brands hope to lay claim to some of that Ferrari magic, and ride Maranello’s coat-tails to sales success. Mostly, it doesn’t really work, as buyers don’t mind a Ferrari hat that was actually mass-produced in Asia, but don’t want a Pontiac Fiero in a Halloween costume.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLearn more about the cars\n\n2025 Alfa Romeo Giulia 2025 Alfa Romeo Giulia\n\nMSRP $62,295\n\n2025 Alfa Romeo Stelvio 2025 Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n3.50\n\nout of 5\n\nMSRP $63,795 to $70,295\n\n2025 Alfa Romeo Tonale 2025 Alfa Romeo Tonale\n\n3.63\n\nout of 5\n\nMSRP $47,495 to $63,995\n\neditor's pick\n\n2023 Ferrari 296 2023 Ferrari 296\n\nMSRP $312,986 to $364,650\n\n2023 Ferrari 812 Competizione 2023 Ferrari 812 Competizione\n\n2.75\n\nout of 5\n\nMSRP $598,513\n\nSometimes though, the claims are genuine. Here are three examples of cars that really did come with some Ferrari pedigree, and three cars that don’t.\n\nLancia Stratos\n\nWe’ll begin with an obvious one, though possibly not from a brand that’s familiar to most people. Lancia is an Italian carmaker that’s even older than Alfa Romeo, with its own beautiful and interesting history of racing success and pioneering innovation.\n\nThe Stratos HF, a wild-looking wedge of speed from the 1970s, remains a pillar of the Lancia legend. Shaped by Marcello Gandini, the key designer behind the Lamborghini Miura and Countach, the Stratos had a very Italian take on visibility: a wild field of view up front, almost nothing visible out the rear. Who cares what was happening behind you? Andiamo!\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIf the driver couldn’t see behind them, they could hear it. Mounted amidships was the 2.4L Ferrari-designed V6 that was used in the lithe and beautiful Dino. The Dino was a Ferrari in everything but name, and when Lancia took its engine and reworked it for rally-racing, the result was as much as 320 hp against less than 900 kg. The Stratos won the world rally championship three years in a row, from 1974 to 1976.\n\nLancia Thema 8.32\n\nWho says all Italian machinery is infused with romance? This boxy sedan is about as alluring as an old Volvo. Boring.\n\nNot boring is what’s under the hood: a 3.0L 32-valve V8 of the same type you got in Magnum P.I.‘s Ferrari 308. Coupled to a five-speed manual gearbox (no automatic option) the Thema 8.32 was a performance sedan with the heart of a Ferrari.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nYes, there were faster rivals, and the Thema’s front-wheel-drive layout wasn’t much of a match for the likes of an early BMW M5. But still, a genuine Ferrari engine transformed the practical four-door Thema into an absolute screamer.\n\nMaserati MC12\n\nFerrari acquired Maserati in the early 2000s, and put its signature touch under the hood of a few models. There are arguments to be had, for instance, over how closely related the V8 in a GranSport is to the flat-plane-crank engines of a contemporary Ferrari.\n\nWith the MC12, however, there’s no confusion. Created to allow the trident-badge of Maserati to compete in FIA GT racing, the MC12 lifted the engine and gearbox out of the mighty Enzo, and borrowed much of the Enzo’s chassis as well. It even had the same windshield as the Enzo.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn many cases, the MC12 was even quicker around a race track than the Ferrari that bore its founder’s name. That can’t have pleased Ferrari executives much. It also had a reputation as being a bit less twitchy than the Enzo, while just as extreme.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nNot so fast! These are the 5 slowest Ferraris ever made\n\nMaserati puts an F1 spin on old tech to make 621 hp from a 3.0L engine\n\nMaserati MC20\n\nThe MC12 was the fastest Maserati road car ever made, but the new MC20 has an even more important mission. While Ferrari has supplied engines to Maserati for years, that arrangement stops shortly. The twin-turbo 3.8L in something like a Ghibli Trofeo will still be Ferrari-derived for a few years yet, but the new car gets a new engine.\n\nIt’s a twin-turbo 3.0L called the Nettuno, and it’s going to be made entirely by Maserati. Yes, it does appear as if Maserati has been copying Ferrari’s homework a bit here, as there are similarities to some Ferrari V8s, but it’s not like the new V6 turbo in Ferrari’s own 296 GTB.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd here’s the other bit of a secret, not about the MC20, but about the Ghibli and the Levante crossover. While Maserati is supplied with V8s and V6s assembled by Ferrari, some of those engine blocks are actually made by Chrysler. They’re cast in the Trenton Engine Complex in Kokomo, Indiana, then shipped to Italy.\n\nAlfa Romeo Giulia Quadrofoglio\n\nOne of the best-driving sports sedans around, the Giulia Quadrofoglio is equipped with a fiery twin-turbo V6 that makes a blistering 505 hp. The engine is often touted as “Ferrari-derived,” but that’s not quite the case.\n\nWhile the Giulia’s V6 has certain engineering resemblances to the Ferrari 488’s 3.9L twin-turbo V8, it’s not just a V8 with two fewer cylinders. Things are actually a bit more interesting than that. Alfa didn’t borrow Ferrari’s engines — they stole Ferrari’s engine guy.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen the Giulia was undergoing its incredibly short development cycle, Alfa Romeo essentially poached some of Ferrari’s top executives to oversee the project. Gianluca Pivetti, Ferrari’s head of gasoline engines, was suddenly moved to the head of Alfa Romeo engines. Pivetti had no engines under development at the time, so he had to get cracking.\n\nSo no, your Alfa Romeo Giluia or Stelvio Quadrofoglio doesn’t have a Ferrari engine under the hood. It did, however, have ex-Ferrari engineers helping to make it sing.\n\nBizzarrini 5300 GT\n\nConsider this car included not because it pretended to be a Ferrari, but because it was, effectively, the anti-Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari once memorably scoffed that “Aerodynamics were for people who couldn’t build engines.” One of his ex-engineers effectively disproved him, with one of the most beautiful and rare cars ever made.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGiotto Bizzarrini was something of a genius. He began as a test-driver and problem-solver for Alfa Romeo, and went to work for Ferrari in the 1950s. Among his credits are the Ferrari 250 GTO, currently one of the most valuable classic cars in the world.\n\nIn 1961, some of Ferrari’s best engineers walked out in a major upheaval for the company — Enzo was not an easy man to work for. Bizzarrini would go on to design the V12 used by many Lamborghinis, but for the car that bore his name, he used a 5.4L V8 sourced from Chevrolet.\n\nSuch an engine was hardly exotic, but it didn’t matter. The 5300 GT won its class at the 1965 running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and a concours-quality example passed the million-dollar mark long ago. Bizzarrini is nowhere near the household name Ferrari is, but I’d much rather have a drive in one than a Scuderia Ferrari keychain.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Blind-Spot Monitor and follow our social channels on Instagram ,Facebook and X to stay up to date on the latest automotive news, reviews, car culture, and vehicle shopping advice.\n\nMore in More Features\n\nReader Review: 2025 Mazda CX-70 MHEV Signature | Reviews\n\nAre off-road accessories safe, secure, and practical for daily use?\n\nBernd Mayländer: F1's Mr. Safety Car\n\nCommercial trucks are going electric, but it's going to be a long road\n\nEvolutionary: The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen has never strayed far from its roots\n\nSee more\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nBrendan McAleer\n\nBrendan McAleer is a full-time professional writer, editor, and photographer based in North Vancouver, BC.
