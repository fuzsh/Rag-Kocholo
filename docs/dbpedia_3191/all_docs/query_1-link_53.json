        "text": "Ferrari CEO Bendetto Vigna confirmed that the automaker intends to complete construction on an additional plant at Maranello specifically targeting electric vehicles by next June, according to a report out of an investor conference hosted by Bloomberg.\n\nVigna previously announced Ferrari’s intentions to become a carbon neutral company by 2030, with the new facility at Maranello playing a role in that lofty goal. Known internally as the “e-building”, Ferrari intends to use the new facility to build components for hybridized internal-combustion and fully-electric vehicles, including motors, battery packs and inverters. Ferrari will continue to develop its own powertrain components in the EV era, with specific goals surrounding industry-leading capacity and mass ratings. Vigna also confirmed that the site will serve as the production base for the brand’s first fully-electric vehicle, with the plant aiming to be online by next summer. The Ferrari EV won’t make its actual debut until the fourth quarter of 2025 however, with Vigna pointing towards volume production beginning in earnest in 2026. It is thought that the upcoming EV model could be an SUV, following the Purosangue in expanding Ferrari’s segment reach."
