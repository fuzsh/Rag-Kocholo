        "text": "Some of the world's most famous luxury sports car brands have their headquarters in the center of Italy, in the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\nFerrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Ducati, to name just a few, were established and grew up there and, despite being known and sold worldwide, maintain deep roots in the territory.\n\nNo wonder, therefore that, in partnership with the Universities of Bologna, Ferrara, Modena&Reggio Emilia and Parma, and together with other big brands like Magneti Marelli, Toro Rosso, Dallara and Haas, they are launching a top educational hub to attract and train the best talents in the automotive engineering industry.\n\nThe Motorvehicle University of Emilia Romagna (MUNER), as it has been dubbed, will offer two master's degree programs, both open to international candidates.\n\nUp to a maximum of 120 students will be selected each year for the course in Advanced Automotive Engineering focused on the design of sports and racing cars; taught subjects will range from advanced sports car manufacturing to high-performance car design.\n\nSkills acquired will be linked to the design and development of: combustion, hybrid and electric motor propellers, energy storage and conversion solutions and production systems tailored - through the use of robotics, advanced supply chain management and the analysis of the so-called \"big data\" - for new manufacturing 4.0 environment.\n\nJust 30 students will be able to access the other course, in Advanced Electronic Engineering which will deal - you guessed! - with everything related to the electronic part of a vehicle. For geek and nerd candidates this field of study will likely be most appealing of the two, for its focus on information technology and connectivity, two key aspects of driverless cars, and of all future cars in general.\n\nThe teaching, which will be fully imparted in English, will include both a theoretical part and laboratory activities carried out in the universities and in the company labs of corporate partners, so that students may develop high-level professional skills, in the spirit of the “learning by doing” approach.\n\nThe mandatory internships will take place at the manufacturing partners’ facilities, while the dissertation activities, based on the “project work” format, will be carried out both inside academic and corporate research labs.\n\n\"This is a one-of-a-kind project in the national and international landscape; it confirms Emilia-Romagna not just as the European center of the new manufacturing, which is being reshaped globally by the cooperation of science, research and production, but also as a platform for advanced training with great added value,” the president of the Emilia-Romagna Region, Stefano Bonaccini, said in a statement.\n\nCourses will start this fall, with the launch of the 2017-2018 academic year."
