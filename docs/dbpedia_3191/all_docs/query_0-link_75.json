I took this last year. It‚Äôs a Ferrari, beautiful and powerful, one of the best in the world. The story I am going to tell is one of the biggest corporate rivalry between two super car companies - Ferrari and Lamborghini. The year is 1963. Ferruccio Lamborghini, a successful tractor manufacturer, is unhappy with his Ferrari. He thinks the car's clutch breaks too easily. He drives to the neighbouring village of Maranello and knocks on the door of none other than Enzo Ferrari. The meeting, which was quite short, would change the fate of supercars forever. It would be a textbook example of how to not treat your customers. Mr Lamborghini explained that the clutch was bad. He also made a suggestion on what Mr Ferrari, with simple means, could do for the clutch to last much longer. Enzo Ferrari had a very hard time accepting constructive criticism. Instead of listening to the proposal, he rejects Ferruccio with the now-famous words: ‚ÄúLet me make cars. You stick to making tractors.‚Äù - Enzo Ferrari Ferruccio drove home. Furious. Instead of being well received for his ideas, he had been rejected in the worst possible way. The insult was painful. Really bad. He was also an engineer. His tractors were the best in Italy. On the way home, he made a fateful decision. He would also build sports cars. And ‚Äì they would be faster and better than Enzo Ferrari's. Lamborghini, as we know it, was born. (Source - https://lnkd.in/dBPevktN) Imagine, if that day Enzo Ferrari listened to his customer patiently, with empathy and tried to solve, he may have avoided the biggest competition ever. Think about it. Have a great weekend üòä. #competition #empathy\n\nFerrari has mastered the art of cultivating desire and exclusivity, not just in their cars, but in the entire ownership experience.

Ferrari, the epitome of luxury and performance in the automotive world, maintains an exclusive production approach to preserve its allure and prestige. Each year, the number of cars Ferrari manufacture is a topic of interest for car enthusiasts and industry analysts alike. Typically, the car manufacturers only makes around 14 cars a day, a huge difference from other car companies like Ford and Toyota that make anywhere from 8K-10K cars a day. There are a few main reasons why Ferrari production is this way, including, craftsmanship, quality control, exclusivity and tailor-made cars for their buyers. In 2022 the company set a new sales record of 13,221 cars for that year.\n\n2 Men. 2 iconic last names/companies : A long-drawn saga of ego, rejection and rivalry. This is the story of Ferrari and Lamborghini. A chain of events, changing the automobile industry forever. Ferruccio Lamborghini, a young Italian engineer was drafted into the Air Force as a mechanic in 1940. 3 years later, after nearly escaping capture by German forces, he opened a small vehicle workshop. After the war ended, he made tractors in his spare time. Soon started Lamborghini Trattori in 1948, quickly finding success. With success, came money. Soon he buys a couple of Ferraris, but his experience was mediocre. The problem? Ferrari's clutch.üòÖ The year is 1962. After not getting any help from the Italian Manufacturer, Lamborghini decides to go to Maranello, to speak directly to THE Enzo Ferrari himself! The meeting was very short: Enzo, egotistical as ever, quickly dismissed his complaint. He went on to say: ‚ÄúThe clutch is not the problem. The problem is you don‚Äôt know how to drive a Ferrari\". Reportedly he even said ‚ÄúLet me make cars. You stick to making tractors.‚Äù This got to Ferruccio and got him bad! Hi reply? \"I'll never buy your cars again. From now on I‚Äôll make my own cars!\"üî• The very next year, he started Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.with just one mission in mind - to make better and faster cars. The rest, as they say, is history. Today, the two names are intertwined with each other. - and to think it all started with an insult!üí• #Automobile #Cars #History #Motorsports\n\nCrazy to see how many cars must be sold by each OEM to realise the same profit margin as Ferrari ! Thanks Felipe Munoz for this very interesting article ! The price war just start for some of them and others worked on volume limitations üí∏ FERRARI MAKES EVEN MORE MONEY IN 2023 One thing is to sell cars and lead the volume rankings and a different one is to make money by selling cars. To be popular does not necessarily mean to make money. And there are two brands in the automotive industry that know this perfectly. Ferrari and Porsche, two of the most iconic car brands recorded the highest margins in 2023 despite being at the bottom of the volume ranking for the year. https://lnkd.in/ebcDw4dy"
