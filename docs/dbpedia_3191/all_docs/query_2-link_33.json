        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn May 2020, something fierce happened to the automotive stock. The market value of Italian carmaker Ferrari soared to $ 30 billion above all 3 U.S. automakers. “General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler- which was once Ferrari parent company.”\n\nCompared to these automobile colossi Ferrari is the tiny carmaker. It just makes only 10k units. Despite the fact, Ferrari is the tiny carmaker it has a huge name in the automobile world.\n\n(Source- CNBC)\n\nIn May, a 2003 Ferrari Enzo fetched $ 2.6 Million on an online auction, making it the most valuable car sold in dedicated online-only collector car auction to date.\n\nFerrari is the name that has given Italy its reputation for producing some Fastest, Sleekest, and Eye-catching cars on the planet. This reputation is so strong that Ferrari bets it can carry its world-class name beyond automotive production and sell other goods to legions of admire unable to afford a six or seven-figure sports car.\n\n(Image Courtesy- CNBC)\n\nThis gamble of stamping the brand name of Ferrari on Fashion, Merchandise, and Theme Parks is not a safe one. This may lead to a risk of brand dilution, especially if the famous pony emblem ends up on some less than premium products. The company has acknowledged the same.\n\nHistory of Ferrari\n\nFerrari got its name from an Italian race-car Enzo Ferrari who was also the founder of Ferrari. He had been racing the Alfa Romeo car since 1924. In the year 1929, Ferrari founded his racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, which exists to this day based in Modena, Italy.\n\n(Image Courtesy- Carthrottle.com)\n\nScuderia Ferrari was at first a team-centered racing Alfa Romeos. But about a decade later, Enzo set up manufacture called Auto Avio Construzioni and moved his headquarters from Modena to the city of Maranello, which would become Ferrari’s legendary home thereafter.\n\nFerrari commissioned the engineer Dwar Keno Colombo, to build him a new car in 1945. Ferrari's first racing car was Ferrari 125 S made in 1947. It came with the 12-cylinder engine, which became frequent on Ferrari later.\n\nFerrari 125 S (Image Courtesy- Pinterest)\n\nA year after Ferrari launched a street vehicle called the Ferrari 166 Inter. Ferrari also started competing in Formula One, the elite global racing series in 1950, and won its first world title two years later.\n\nFerrari 166 Inter (Image Courtesy- Carstyling)\n\nRacing has always been at the heart of the Ferrari. Scuderia Ferrari is the oldest Formula One racing team and has also participated in famous races such as endurance races at Le Man, France, and Daytona, Florida. Ferrari is the only brand that has been continuously part of Formula One racing from 1950 onwards when the world championship was established.\n\nBeing a small manufacture of a highly sophisticated car is never an easy path to travel. Many such automakers have either form partnerships with larger companies or been acquired entirely. Ferrari was no different. In the year 1969, the Italian automaker Fiat took a 50% stake in the company 1969 and increase its stake to 90% in 1988. In 2016, Fiat, which had since become Fiat Chrysler, spun Ferrari out into a separate, publicly-traded company, trading under the ticker symbol Race.\n\nThe Journey from Car maker to a Luxury Brand\n\nFerrari is always known for its cars. But the company has extended its reach beyond these small rarefied worlds of racing fans and lovers of supercars.\n\nThe late Sergio Marchionne, Former CEO FCA Group & Ferrari, had said in 2014 that he thought Ferrari had a future that went far beyond driving. “I actually think cars are almost incidental to Ferrari. It sounds sacrilegious. But it is truly a luxury brand. ”- Sergio Marchionne (2014).\n\nTill Ferrari IPO Marchionne maintained Ferrari was worth at least 10 billion euros, around $ 11 billion, according to May 2020 exchange rates. But some analysts thought that number sounded a bit high.\n\nAccording to “Max Warburton of Bernstein Research the figure was around 5-6 billion euros.” But if the market capitalisation is any indicator, the company is worth about three times that just a few years later. Its revenues have not tripled in that time.\n\n(Source- Ycharts)\n\n(Source- Macrotrends)\n\nRather, the company and investors have been betting that brand recognition is an underexploited asset. At Ferrari, the Ferrari name and the famous yellow and black prancing horse logo are recognized the world over brand finance, a firm that measures the impact of various brands, considers Ferrari to be the most powerful brand in the world. Its fame either rivals or exceeds that of not only other global luxury symbols such as Rolex and Hermes but also the brand power of massive information technology and entertainment names such as Disney and Google and even purveyors of seemingly ubiquitous products such as Coca-Cola.\n\nThis is especially striking when one considers Ferrari sells 10,000 cars per year and Coca-Cola says it hands out 1.9 billion servings of one of its drinks every day. So, Ferrari is looking for new ways to leverage its brand power.\n\nThe Company said it plans for branded goods to contribute 10% of EBIT (Earnings before interest and tax) within the next decade. This includes merchandise such as clothing, coffee mugs, and watches. The company operates its stores and sells goods online. Through the years Ferrari has stamped its logo on an array of products, including some very offbeat ones like Acer laptop computers and Mahjong sets. There is also a Ferrari world theme park in Abu Dhabi, complete with roller coasters.\n\n(Image Courtesy- CNBC)\n\nRisks Associated\n\nThe company acknowledged in filings that its attempts to reach more customers through merchandising could lead to some missteps. Branding is a tricky business part of what gives Ferrari its brand identity is exclusivity. The 10,131 cars sold in 2019 came after the company decided to lift its once strict production limit of 7000 cars per year.\n\nThe waiting list for Ferrari cars is long. Buyers wait four to five years for delivery of most customised Ferraris. The company is also known for being very picky about who it will even sell some of its limited-edition vehicles to. Late racing legend and devoted Ferrari collector Preston Henn, who passed away in 2017 had sued Ferrari, alleging that the company refused to sell him a Ferrari Aperta. Henn had gone to great lengths to get the car. Even mailing million dollars cheque to Sergio Marchionne. The cheque was returned.\n\n(Image Courtesy- ABC News)\n\nHenn then slapped Ferrari with a defamation suit, which he later dropped. Then he brought Acura NSX, a supercar from Honda’s premium brand which he said was better than Ferrari. The company has at times seemed even aggressive in controlling what its cars are associated with.\n\nFerrari Aperta (Image Courtesy- Motorauthority)\n\nHonda Acura NSX (Image Courtesy- Youtube)\n\nIn 2019, German fashion designer Philipp Plein reportedly received a letter from lawyers representing the automaker complaining about pictures on his Instagram account. The lawyers considered per se distasteful, including pictures of shoes on the car and other photos. The letter said, tarnished the brand’s image.\n\nThe letter demanded Philipp remove the pictures within 48 hours. The pictures and the images of the letter, Philipp also posted, were later removed.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the company will be able to use Ferrari baseball caps and key chains. These efforts can fit Ferrari’s Lux brand image in 2019 it formed a partnership with high-end Italian clothier Giorgio Armani for example.\n\nThe company has cut back on its number of licensing partnerships and reduced the number of licensed products. Apart from preserving its exclusive brand image, the automaker takes seriously the need to its engineering prowess and capability on the racetrack.\n\nScuderia Ferrari has a remarkably successful overall record in Formula One. But Ferrari noted in its 2019 annual report that the team had struggled that year. Sponsorship brings in about 14% of Ferrari’s net revenue, but its reputation as a winner on the track is difficult to put a price on speed, as at the very heart of Ferrari’s identity. One of its most famous vehicles is referred to as the super-fast.\n\nRacing is also very important for Ferrari research and development. Many of the innovation that begins life on the track eventually make their way into Ferrari’s street vehicles.\n\nUncertain times\n\nFerrari unveiled a record of five models in 2019. Among these, the company introduced its first production plug-in hybrid.\n\n(Image Courtesy- CNBC)\n\nElectrification is a trend many in the automobile industry are at least ambivalent about an often divided among themselves over. On the one hand, many see it as an inevitable and welcome development that reduces pollution while delivering in many ways comparable or even superior performance. Part of owning a supercar, say some, is the experience of driving one. And the distinctive engine note produced by high-end engines is part of that experience.\n\nSome also argue that cars stand to lose some of their distinctive performance characteristics. There are tremendous differences in performance among various types of engines. But some argue electric motors are vulnerable to the commodification.\n\nHaving said that, going after high-end customers was precisely how Tesla built its reputation. Whereas previous attempts at electric and hybrid vehicles stressed their eco-friendliness, Tesla’s roadster, and later Model S and X emphasised luxury and lightning-fast acceleration.\n\nWhen Tesla debuted its Model S performance sedan in 2016, CEO Elon musk boasted there were only a few other cars that could beat the model S zero to 60 times of 2.5 seconds. One was the Porsche 918 Spyder and the other was the Ferrari LaFerrari.\n\nFerrari is also working on a Sport utility vehicle codenamed the Purosangue which means the pureblood. The coronavirus pandemic’s stands to severely threaten the automotive market around the world. But the high-end market is, for better or worse, just not the same as the rest of the market. Investors appear to be betting that companies like Ferrari, which cater exclusively to the wealthy, might be a bit better protected from an economic downturn.\n\nFerrari’s margin doesn’t hurt either. Some analysts indicate Ferrari makes an average of about 80 thousand dollars of profit on each car it sells based on the prices of the cars and its annual production volume. That is enough of the cash to buy a high-end Mercedes, BMW, or Porsche. Its margins are healthy around 24%, compared with about 5% for most automakers.\n\n(Source- CNBC)\n\nIn 2020, the company raised its dividend 10% over the previous year. However, it’s not bulletproofed. Ferrari said in its May earnings announcement that it was lowering guidance on net revenue to between $ 3.7 billion and $ 3.9 billion, down from $ 4.5 billion previously. It cut its forecast for adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation to a top range of $ 1.31 billion from a top range of $ 1.51 billion.\n\n(Source- CNBC)\n\nFerrari CEO Louis Camilleri told investors on a call that “the company had seen orders canceled in the USA and Australia but so far there were no red flags.”\n\nConclusion\n\nStill, Ferrari’s performance beat expectations and encouraged investors faced with an unprecedented economic situation. What Ferrari makes is not essential. It isn’t toilet paper, soap or food. But Ferrari does have a world-class brand built over generations. It also has a product devoted fans will wait for 4 years, pay millions, and even file lawsuits to own. That might be, in its way, a very safe bet.\n\nReferences\n\n(Image Courtesy- Ferrari 125S)\n\nhttps://itsbrucemclaren.tumblr.com/post/121126169073/1947-piacenza-125-s-cortese-11-mai-8\n\n(Image Courtesy- Scuderia Ferrari)\n\nhttps://www.carthrottle.com/post/dol8x67/\n\n(Rise of Ferrari)\n\nhttps://www.cnbcafrica.com/\n\n(Image Courtesy- Ferrari Revenue)\n\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RACE/ferrari/revenue\n\n(Image Courtesy- Ferrari Market Cap)\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/companies/RACE/market_cap\n\n(Image Courtesy- Ferrari Aperta)\n\nhttps://www.motorauthority.com/news/1112488_ferrari-laferrari-aperta-built-for-charity-fetches-10m\n\n(Image Courtesy- Honda Acura NSX)"
