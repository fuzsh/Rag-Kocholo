        "text": "Few brands can compete with the legendary status of vehicles bearing the prancing horse logo: Ferrari cars. With a history spanning over seven decades, the Italian carmaker has crafted an array of models for enthusiasts. This collection of Ferrari car models demonstrates the evolution of this auto manufacturer as well as its impact on the industry and its fans.\n\nFounded by Enzo Ferrari in 1947, the company established itself as a force in both racing and road car production. Various types of Ferraris, built for roads or racetracks, have left a mark on automotive design and engineering. Each new model showcases innovative features and cutting-edge technology while staying true to the brand's core values: power, speed, beauty, and exclusivity.\n\nAmong these Ferrari models are cars such as the Ferrari 250 GTO, Enzo Ferrari, and Ferrari 288 GTO. The 250 GTO is a good example of elegance combined with power - a testament to its status as one of the most valuable collector cars today. On the other hand, Enzo Ferrari represents a more modern era of sophistication with its rare limited production run and Formula One-inspired technology. The 288 GTO harkens back to Group B rallying dominance while featuring sleek aesthetics that continue to inspire contemporary designs. These exceptional vehicles are good examples of what makes Ferrari special.\n\nAs we reflect on this diverse array of Ferrari types, it becomes apparent that they are far more than just high-performance machines. Ferrari's craftsmanship and innovation has created vehicles that stand out. As long as there remains passion for driving excellence, Ferrari will continue to shape the automotive landscape.\n\nThe Ferrari 365 GTB/4, better known by the unofficial name Ferrari Daytona, is a grand tourer automobile produced from 1968 to 1973. It was first introduced to the public at the Paris Auto Salon in 1968 and replaced the 275 GTB/4. The Daytona was replaced by the mid-engined 365 GT4 Berlinetta Boxer in 1973.\n\nClass : Sports car\n\nThe Ferrari 250 GTO is a racing GT car which was produced by Ferrari from 1962 to 1964 for homologation into the FIA's Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. In May 2012 the 1962 250 GTO made for Stirling Moss became the world's most expensive car in the history, selling in a private transaction for $38,115,000 to US communications magnate Craig McCaw. In October 2013, Connecticut-based collector Paul Pappalardo sold chassis number 5111GT to an unnamed buyer for a new record of $52 Million. The numerical part of its name denotes the displacement in cubic centimeters of each cylinder of the engine, whilst GTO stands for \"Gran Turismo Omologato\", Italian for \"Grand Touring Homologated.\" When new, the GTO cost $18,000 in the United States, and buyers had to be personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and his dealer for North America, Luigi Chinetti. 39 250 GTOs were manufactured between 1962 and 1964. This includes 33 cars with 1962-63 bodywork, three cars with 1964 bodywork similar to the Ferrari 250 LM and three \"330 GTO\" specials with a larger engine. Four of the older 1962-1963 cars were retrofitted in 1964 with an updated body.\n\nClass : Sports car\n\nThe Ferrari 275 was a two-seat front-engined Gran Turismo automobile produced by Ferrari between 1964 and 1968. It used a 3.3 L Colombo 60Â° V12 engine and produced 280-300 hp. The Pininfarina-designed body was a graceful evolution of the car's predecessor, the 250, and strongly contrasted with its replacement, the Daytona. The 275 introduced Ferrari to the \"transaxle\", where the transmission and rear axle are integrated.\n\nFerrari 599 GTB Fiorano\n\nThe Ferrari 599 is an Italian sports car produced by Ferrari. It was the brand's two-seat flagship, replacing the 575M Maranello in 2006 as a 2007 model, but was replaced for the 2013 model year by the F12berlinetta. Styled by Pininfarina under the direction of Ferrari's Frank Stephenson, the 599 GTB debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in February 2006. It is named for its total engine displacement, Gran Turismo Berlinetta nature, and the Fiorano Circuit test track used by Ferrari.\n\nClass : Grand tourer\n\nThe Ferrari F430 is a sports car that was produced by the Italian car manufacturer Ferrari from 2004 to 2009. A successor to the Ferrari 360, it debuted at the 2004 Paris Motor Show. Its replacement, the Ferrari 458, was unveiled on 28 July 2009.\n\nClass : Roadster, Sports car\n\nThe Ferrari 250 is a sports car built by Ferrari from 1953 to 1964. The company's most successful early line, the 250 series included several variants. It was replaced by the 275 and the 330."
