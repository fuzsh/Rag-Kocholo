A few years later in 1904, the company was reorganized into a joint-stock company and renamed as ‘Horch & Cie. Motowagenwerke AG’. Following a dispute with the board members, August Horch parted ways with the company and in 1909 he went on to form his second company- ‘August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH’. Horch was sued by his former partners for trademark infringement and the German supreme court agreed. As Horch was prohibited from using \"Horch\" as a trade name in his new car business, he called a meeting with close business friends to discuss a new name for his company. Horch’s friend Franz Fikentscher hosted the meeting at his apartment. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. On multiple occasions he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue studying, until he suggested the name “Audi” out of the blue. Horch means ‘listen’ in old German and its equivalent in Latin is ‘Audi’. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting. On 25 April 1910 the ‘Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau’ was registered and the brand AUDI was born.\n\nTrivia: Audi was the first car manufacturer to win the famous Le Mans 24 hours endurance race with both Diesel (R10 TDI in 2005) and Hybrid(R18 e-tron Quattro in 2012) powered cars.

It was in 1958 he bought his first Ferrari- 250 GT, and went on to add a few more to his stable. Although he liked his Ferraris, he found them to be too noisy and rough to be proper road cars and wasn’t happy with a few quality aspects of his cars. He then decided to report the imperfections to Enzo Ferrari directly. The constructive criticism did not go well with Enzo Ferrari due to his pride. It is believed that Enzo retorted asking Ferruccio to focus on his tractor business than paying attention to his cars. Enzo was of the opinion that Ferruccio did not know a thing about his cars, or cars in general. Enzo’s comments spurred Ferruccio to prove him wrong and decided to pursue his vision of a perfect sports car.
