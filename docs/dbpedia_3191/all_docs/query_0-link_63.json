        "text": "THE Ferrari mystique exerts a powerful draw, reaching well beyond those fortunate drivers who have experienced the sublime sports cars made in Maranello, Italy, and extending beyond the devoted fans of its Formula One racing team.\n\nSix decades after its founding, the company has an image so strong that its followers eagerly scoop up clothing, wristwatches and laptop computers decorated with its prancing horse logo. In coming weeks, Ferrari loyalists will gather to celebrate the 60th anniversary with festivities in Maranello that include a concours, a parade of racecars and the arrival of a relay tour that began Jan. 28 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and will have traveled through 50 countries over 148 days.\n\nPlans to spread the Ferrari influence further yet are heading in a new, and perhaps unexpected, direction — a Ferrari theme park that is scheduled to open on an island in the Persian Gulf in 2009. The entertainment it will offer is intended to appeal to a range of car enthusiasts, from the Six Flags daytrippers to those whose dream is to someday own a vintage Testa Rossa or Daytona.\n\nThe construction of the theme park is a logical extension of existing marketing efforts intended to build on the loyalty of Ferrari followers. At the Bahrain Grand Prix in April, the chief executives of Ferrari and of Aldar Properties, an Abu Dhabi real estate development company, signed a contract to begin construction of the entertainment complex. Among Aldar’s principal shareholders is the Mubadala Development Company, a wholly owned arm of the emirate of Abu Dhabi that owns 5 percent of Ferrari.\n\nThe park is to be built on Yas Island, a resort of nearly 10 square miles in the Persian Gulf about a 30-minute drive from Abu Dhabi. The island project is an effort to increase tourism to Abu Dhabi and provide an alternative to the emirate’s economic reliance on oil revenues.\n\nThe park’s plans call for two dozen attractions, including a Formula One-themed roller coaster on which two sets of cars will race against each other on separate tracks. Other features will include virtual reality racing simulators, a pit-lane team experience, go-karts, dune buggies and a high-tech interactive museum.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
