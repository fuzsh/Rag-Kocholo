        "text": "Navigating the world of car manufacturers and their parent companies can be a tricky task. Many consumers may assume that a brand is independently owned, but it is actually a part of a larger corporation. This applies to both luxury and mainstream car brands. In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the major car brands and the companies that own them.\n\nBMW The German luxury car company BMW is the parent company to Mini cars and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. BMW was originally founded as an engine producer called Rapp Motorenwerke, but later changed its name to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1917. In 1922, BMW merged with the aircraft company Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke. Today, BMW Group owns BMW, Rolls-Royce, Mini, and BMW Motorrad.\n\nVolkswagen Group The German car giant Volkswagen Group is the owner of many well-known vehicle brands. Volkswagen currently holds a majority share in Audi, Scania, and Porsche, and also wholly owns Skoda Auto, Lamborghini, and Ducati. The Volkswagen Group is headquartered in Wolfsburg, Germany.\n\nDaimler AG Daimler AG is the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, Fuso, Western Star, Smart, Freightliner, Bharat Benz, Setra, and Thomas Built. Daimler AG was originally founded as Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1899 and later merged with Benz & Cie in 1926 to become Daimler-Benz AG. Mercedes-Benz is one of the oldest car brands in the world, dating back to 1900.\n\nGeneral Motors Company General Motors is one of the world's most well-known companies and owns a large portfolio of car brands. These include Holden Special Vehicles, Corvette, Peugeot, and CitroÃ«n. General Motors was founded by William C Durant in 1908 and later acquired brands such as Cadillac and Oldsmobile. However, in 2009, the company went bankrupt and closed brands such as Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac, and Oldsmobile. Today, General Motors controls Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Holden, Opel, Jiefang, Wuling, and many more.\n\nHyundai Motor Company Hyundai Motor Company started as a construction firm in 1947 and entered the auto business in 1967. The company first built a version of the Ford Cortina under license and later revealed its own model, the Pony, in 1976. Kia Motors, another popular car brand, was originally a firm that specialized in making parts for bicycles and officially entered the auto industry in 1944. Today, Hyundai Motor Company owns Hyundai and Kia.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some car brands are owned by multinational corporations, such as Toyota and Lexus, which are both owned by Toyota Motor Corporation, and Honda and Acura, which are both owned by Honda Motor Company. Additionally, some car brands are owned by luxury conglomerate companies, such as Jaguar and Land Rover, which are owned by Tata Motors, and Volvo and Polestar, which are owned by Geely.\n\nAnother example is the luxury car brand Ferrari, which is owned by the Italian holding company, Exor. Exor also owns other luxury brands such as Maserati and Alfa Romeo, which are both car brands under FCA Italy S.p.A.\n\nIn today's globalised market, it is becoming increasingly common for car brands to be owned by multinational corporations or luxury conglomerate companies. Understanding the parent company behind a car brand can provide valuable insight into the brand's history, future plans, and the larger industry as a whole.\n\nIt is very common for a major car brand to be owned by a larger corporation. It's important to know the parent company behind the brand as it can provide insight into the brand's history and future plans."
