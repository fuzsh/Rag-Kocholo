        "text": "SK On recognized for driving continuous improvement\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- SK On, a leading global electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturer, announced today it has been recognized by Italian luxury sports carmaker Ferrari during the Podio Ferrari supplier convention.\n\nSK On was one of the eight companies that was recognized at this year’s Podio Ferrari event in Maranello, Italy, on June 26. The traditional event hosted by Ferrari saw the attendance of some 700 suppliers and strategic contributors of the automaker, emphasizing their specific contribution to the “Prancing Horse’s” technological progress, competitiveness and innovation.\n\nSK On received the supplier award in the Fearless Organization category for its resolution, rigor and transparency in having addressed Ferrari's challenging technological needs in the development of cells for the batteries of Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars since 2019.\n\nThe company started providing battery cells for Ferrari with the launch of the marque’s first-ever range supercar and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), the SF90 Stradale, and its open-top variant, the SF90 Spider. SK On’s cells are also used in the battery that powers the 296 GTB and the 296 GTS PHEVs that were launched in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\nIn March, SK On signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Ferrari to renew the two companies’ on-going collaboration and share valuable insights into the innovation of cell technology. Under the MoU, these exchanges will help both companies envision new possibilities to drive continuous improvement.\n\n“We are honored to be recognized at the Podio Ferrari,” Chung Goo-pil, Head of Europe Sales at SK On, said. “We are working together to combine each company’s expertise to proactively support Ferrari’s drive to envision new potential solutions for its high-performance electric vehicles.”\n\n###\n\nAbout SK On\n\nSK On is a leading global electric vehicle (EV) battery developer, manufacturer, and solutions provider whose mission is to make our world a cleaner and more convenient place. Established in October 2021 following a battery business split-off from SK Innovation, South Korea’s largest energy company, SK On aims to become a leader in the clean energy industry by leveraging its global production base and R&D capabilities, as well as its manufacturing and quality management know-how.\n\nHeadquartered in Seoul, South Korea, SK On has a worldwide presence with battery plants currently operating or in construction across the United States, Europe, and Asia."
