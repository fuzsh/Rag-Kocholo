In addition, neither is a recommendation, offer or solicitation to sell or buy any security or to purchase of shares in any fund or establish any separately managed account. It should not be assumed that any recommendations made by GBM.com in the future will be profitable or will equal the performance of any securities discussed herein.

There is no assurance that any account or fund will achieve its investment objectives. Accounts and funds are subject to price volatility and the value of a portfolio will change as the prices of investments go up or down. Before investing in a strategy, you should consider the risks of the strategy as well as whether the strategy is suitable based upon your investment objectives and risk tolerance.\n\nThere may be additional risks associated with international and emerging markets investing involving foreign, economic, political, monetary, and/or legal factors. International investing is not for everyone. You can lose money by investing in securities.\n\nThe S&P 500® Index is a widely used stock market index that can serve as a barometer of US stock market performance, particularly with respect to larger capitalization stocks. It is a market-weighted index of stocks of 500 leading companies in leading industries and represents a significant portion of the market value of all stocks publicly traded in the United States. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.\n\nInvestors often use these well-known and widely recognized indices as one way to gauge the investment performance of an investment manager’s strategy compared to investment sectors that correspond to the strategy. However, global brands strategies are actively managed and not intended to replicate the performance of the indices: the performance and volatility of any brands strategies may differ materially from the performance and volatility of their benchmark indices, and their holdings will differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. You cannot invest directly in indices, which do not take into account trading commissions and costs."
