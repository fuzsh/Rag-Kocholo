        "text": "Ferrari is about emotions, style, success and legend. A legacy built on decades of sporting successes and the inimitable style. it is a source of inspiration for millions of car enthusiasts. Every Ferrari is unique. The brand is synonymous with speed, performance, innovation, technology, design and most importantly driving a pleasure. The most difficult challenge Ferrari always faces when it decides to develop a new model, is to push the boundaries of its own achievements yet again. The exclusivity and quality that only the Prancing Horse can deliver.\n\nThe successful automaker still designs and builds their vehicles at their Maranello workshop. Ferraris are sold in over 60 markets worldwide through a network of 164 authorized dealers operating 185 points of sale. But Ferrari is not just about cars. The Italian company holds all the cards when it comes to brand recognition. The Prancing Horse logo found on clothing, accessories, toys, sports goods, etc is loved by all.\n\nThe Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi and Ferrari Land in PortAventura Park near Barcelona, attract fanatics and give them a feeling of technology and innovation gains.\n\nIt all began in 1947 when the first car built under the Ferrari marquee, the 125 S- a 1500cc; 12-cylinder, drove through the historic factory gates on Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello. Franco Cortese drove the 125 S in its maiden race at the Piacenza Circuit on May 11, 1947, and again to its first victory in the Rome Grand Prix at the Terme di Caracalla circuit on the 25th of the same month. That said, Ferrari’s origins are inextricably linked to its founder’s entire life story. Born in Modena on February 18, 1898, Enzo Ferrari himself was a motor driver who devoted his entire life to car racing. It is this personal experience as a driver, combined with his commitment to improved engineering that has revolutionized the luxury sports cars industry.\n\nToday, the city of Maranello hosts thousands of visitors in Museo Ferrari, the incredible museum devoted to the brand. While in the museum, visitors can enjoy a ride on one of the semi-professional Ferrari simulators, feel the enthralling experience of driving in Grands Prix and immerse themselves in Ferrari’s story. Another museum, the MEF or Museo Enzo Ferrari, is built in the city of Modena, around the house in which the marque’s founder was born.\n\nFerrari’s history is rooted in the history of motor racing. It is also reflected in the evolution of-of its road cars, characterized by craftsmanship and technological research from the racing world. This is why Ferrari’s brand has left a lasting impression on its fans.\n\nEver since the conception of the brand in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s Ferrari has always favored the personal touch of their clients to their cars. Nowadays Ferrari offers its customers a range of programmes that enable buyers to custom design almost every component of their car. Owners can choose everything from livery colors, interior trims, finishes, and accessories using the configurator tool. Ferrari’s offers a special customization programme named “Tailor Made”, taking inspirations from three collections closely connected to Ferrari’s DNA: Scuderia (racing-influenced selections); Classica (modern takes on the iconic Ferrari GT); and Inedita (innovative and out-of-the-box combinations). Once a buyer makes these choices, the owner comes in possession of a one-of-its-kind Ferrari. Despite the fact that Ferraris are available in a wide range of colors, most customers even now choose the signature red color for their beast. Such is the charisma of the brand.\n\nThe newly appointed Mr. Camilleri now serves as CEO of Ferrari. He currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”). From March 2008 to May 2013, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PMI. From April 2002 and August 2002 until March 2008, he was Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Altria Group, Inc., respectively. From November 1996 to April 2002, he served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Altria Group, Inc. He had been employed continuously by Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (including PMI) in various capacities since 1978. Mr. Camilleri was appointed to the Board of Directors of América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. in April 2011, and previously served on the Board of Telmex International SAB from December 2009. Mr. Camilleri was President and CEO of Kraft Foods International in 1995 and then he was director of Kraft Foods Inc. (“Kraft”) from March 2001 to December 2007 and was Kraft’s Chairman from September 2002 to March 2007. Mr. Camilleri has a degree in Economics and Business Administration from HEC Lausanne, the Faculty of Business & Economics at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland)."
