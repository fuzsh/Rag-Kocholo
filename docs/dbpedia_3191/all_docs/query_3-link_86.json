        "text": "Manzoni began his career in 1993, working for FIAT, Lancia, Volkswagen, and SEAT before joining Ferrari as the company’s Head of Design in 2010. Since the Italian car manufacturer was founded in 1947, he is the first head designer to have succeeded in building a successful Ferrari design team. In an interview for Design Father, he confessed: \"When I was a young boy, it was certainly my dream to design cars, but I could never have imagined that the dream would become a reality. I was very lucky! But I think when I was young, I expected to see flying cars by 2000.\"\n\nIn his early days at Ferrari, Flavio Manzoni saw the necessity of establishing an in-house design team and creating a facility that could house all the design-related activities of the Prancing Horse. Thanks to his revolutionary thinking and his incredible team, the Centro Stile Ferrari was opened in September 2018. Tasks are now easier, the synergy between design and engineering has evolved, and design has expanded in bright new directions.\n\nDesign-wise, \"Our objective was to create a ‘wow’ effect, a surprise when you walk in from the old Ferrari entrance to the Maranello site. There is great precision in its construction, and there is a strong relationship between the form of the building and our cars. The surfaces suggest Ferrari design with these concave and convex surfaces and the interplay between light and shadow.\" stated Manzoni."
