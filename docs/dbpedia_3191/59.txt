Ferrari overview

Ferrari is one of Italy’s premier sports car manufacturers. Known for their sleek lines and racing pedigree, Ferrari is the textbook example of an exotic car. As with most exotics, Ferrari pricing reflects their bespoke nature.

Interestingly enough, the story of Ferrari begins with another famous automaker. Enzo Ferrari had started his racing career with Alfa Romeo, but eventually turned to producing his own cars by the end of the 1940’s. In an effort to fund his racing efforts, Ferrari began production of road cars. These would include the 250 GTO, 365 Daytona, and F40, just to name a few.

While most manufacturers have expanded their lineups to include sedans and SUVs, Ferrari continues to specialize in the production of iconic supercars. Decades later, the Prancing Horse is still remains an industry leader of high performance.
