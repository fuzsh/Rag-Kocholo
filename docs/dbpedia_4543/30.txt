Welcome to Afghanistan: Send More Ammo!, is a new book that has been written by U.S. soldier Captain Benjamin Tupper.

Tupper, an infantry officer, was a member of the U.S. military’s embedded trainers, known as “ETTs” and he spent a year assigned to the Afghan National Army, living and working with the ANA and leading them in combat operations.

The ANA is, of course, the key for the U.S. and Canadian militaries, as well as other western militaries, in leaving Afghanistan.

As part of the promotional material for the book, Capt. Tupper provides answers to a number of questions regarding the ANA, the Afghan war and the personal affect it has had on him.

Question and Answer with Captain Benjamin Tupper

1) How would you describe the average day in the life for an American soldier in the ANA?

Our daily life was tied into the Afghan culture. We would be awoken by the call to prayer well before sunrise, and our training events and planning would be directly affected by Afghan customs of multiple daily prayers. Fridays, which is known as “Juma”, was the holy day, and no one worked or did much of anything unless we were attacked. Out on missions, we tended as Americans to be interested in getting the job done quickly and efficiently, but the Afghan soldiers were more inclined to sit and drink chai for hours with village elders, as was their custom. So we had to learn to live, think, and act like Afghans while on mission. One other aspect of the unique life of the ETTs was that because we had limited access to American foods on the Afghan Army Base in Ghazni, we were able to really get to know Afghan cuisine, and had many opportunities to break bread with Afghan soldiers and interpreters, which was a key to bonding with our Afghan soldiers.

2) How are ETT’s selected?

ETTs are mid level Officers and NCO’s with a broad range of experience. Most ETT Officers were captains, like me. Over the last five years, ETTs primarily came from the National Guard because the Army recognized that citizen soldiers from the Guard would be better equipped in their attitudes and experiences to deal with the unique nature of being embedded in a foreign army. Because we, as National Guardsmen, spend most of our lives in the civilian world, we are less indoctrinated into the rigidity and strict adherence to regulations you find in the Regular Army. Rigidity is not an attribute that is beneficial when working with the Afghans, who are not inclined to follow strict rules and regulations. Moreso, as citizen soldiers bring a civilian skillset to their ETT job, in addition to the military training. We had police officers, carpenters, and farmers on our team, all of which were skills that were used on a daily basis while in Afghanistan.

3) What is your prognosis for the war in Afghanistan?

My personal opinion is in conflict with my objective analysis. Personally, I feel the war is worth fighting, and worth the resources and blood of my comrades that has been spilled. But being a student of history, I recognize that Afghanistan is the grave of empires, and that no country has every successfully prosecuted a war in the country. I feel that a political settlement is both desirable and inevitable, even if it means the Taliban has some influence in the government. The nature of the Afghan people is such that a foreign presence, regardless of its benevolence, will be unwelcome in the long run.

4) What advice would you give President Obama on this war?

To follow his current course of increasing forces with the goal not of a military victory (which is not achievable), but of creating conditions where the Government of Afghanistan can negotiate from a position of strength a political settlement the ends the war and brings the moderates within the Taliban back into government. A sole reliance on military force will only result in decades of protracted and bloody conflict with no end in sight.

5) What advice would you give the head of the ANA?

To instill greater discipline and ethics among his Officer Corps. They remain the weak link in building a strong national army. Afghan Officers are the most notorious in their abuses of power, excessive leave from duty, theft and graft, and incompetence. The new younger soldiers and NCOs of the Afghan Army deserve better leaders.

6) What do you feel is the most important thing for American citizens to understand about the war in Afghanistan?

That it is more complicated than the media or our government could ever portray to us. There are no blacks and whites in Afghanistan, instead a spectrum of greys exists. A tradition of switching sides and changing alliances is common. A lack of national identity exists. Tribal and family relations trump national loyalty, and our simple “us vs. the Taliban” really means little, as the definition of who is or isn’t a Taliban supporter can change weekly if not daily.

7) How has your time as an ETT affected you personally?

While I am proud to have served as an ETT, my experiences in combat have severely impacted my personal life. I suffer from PTSD, and am in regular counseling. I was married for fifteen years prior to leaving for war. I returned from the war, but never returned home due to problems with PTSD. This led to a divorce, excessive drinking, and violent and unpredictable behavior.

8) How are soldiers treated for PTSD and how effective are treatments?

I have found services for returning veterans with PTSD to be adequate and appropriate. I attend a local Vet Center for counselling, as do many of my peers. For those with more severe PTSD issues, such as my ETT partner Corporal Polanski, more intensive programs and options are available. CPL Polanski had such severe behaviour problems and suicidal ideations, that he was committed to a special ward for extreme PTSD cases, and will soon be attending a 45 day inpatient program for veterans.

9) Would you return as an ETT? What are your plans for the future?

Being an ETT is such a rewarding job that it is hard to ever say NO to an offer to return. However, right now, I am not in a place yet personally that I can say I could function in such a dangerous and high stress environment due to my PTSD. I believe in the war effort, and I am proud of the Afghan soldiers I trained and led into combat, but I am also honest about how the war affected me, and I know that I have not gotten “better” enough yet to go back and perform in the manner required to stay safe and alive.
