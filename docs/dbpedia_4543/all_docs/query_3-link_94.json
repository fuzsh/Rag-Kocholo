        "text": "STATE CAPITOL\n\nA STANDARD HISTORY OF\n\nGeorgia and Georgians\n\nBy LUCIAN LAMAR KNIGHT\n\nILLUSTRATED\n\nVOLUME III\n\nTHE LEWIS PUBLISHING COMPANY\n\nCHICAGO : : NEW YORK\n\n'\n\n1917\n\nCOPYRIGHT 1917 BY\n\nTHE LEWIS PUBLISHING Co,\n\nPART I\n\nGEORGIA IN THE REALM OF ANECDOTE, WIT, HUMOR, EPISODE AND INCIDENT\n\nGeorgia and Georgians\n\nSHELLMAN HEIGHTS: A KOMANCE OP SHERMAN's MARCH\n\nOn January 1, 1911, there fell a prey to the devouring flames, a splendid old mansion on the Etowah, near Cartersville, Georgia, known as Shellman Heights. It crowned an eminence overlooking the river and represented an investment of several thousands of dollars, not a penny of which, for lack of insurance, could be recovered. Little sur vives to mark the spot; hut associated with it there is a romance of the '60s surpassing anything to be found in the melodramas. Shellman Heights was built in 1861 by Capt. Charles Shellman, and the first mistress of the mansion was one of the most famous belles of her day. As Miss Cecilia Stovall, she spent her summers at West Point, and there she became a prime favorite with the handsome young cadets. The circle of her admirers included two stalwart youths who were destined to attain high honors in the iron days of battle: Joseph Hooker and William Tecumseh Sherman. Both were captivated by this bewitchingly beauti ful Georgia girl. But she married a man from her own section, much to the chagrin of her disappointed lovers.\n\nYears elapsed. In the spring of 1864, en route to New Hope Church, where one of the great battles of the campaign was fought, General Sherman and General Hooker both halted at Shellman Heights. General Sherman was the first to arrive. On approaching the mansion .which he was about to ransack, the Federal commander was attracted by the pathetic wail of an old negro woman, who sat at the front entrance and, in accents hysterical with grief and fear, .repeatedly sobbed:\n\n\"0, Lawd, what's Miss Celia gwine ter do now?\" Catching the sound of a name which was once most charmingly familiar to his ear, there flashed across the old soldier's mind a vision of West Point, and, in a tone of inquiry which was not without some touch of tenderness, he inquired: \"What is the full name of your mistress? Come, answer me quick.\" \"Her name,\" replied the distracted servant. \"Hit's Miss Cecilia Stovall Shellman.\" General Sherman started. But instantly a smile broke over his rugged face. \"Why, that's my old sweetheart!\" exclaimed he; and into the eyes of the man of blood and iron there crept a far away look. . But it was only for. a moment. Tearing a leaf from his note book, the grim warrior hastily scratched the following lines, addressed to Mrs. Shellman:\n\n1273\n\n1274\n\nGEOKGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n'' My dear Madam You once said that you pitied the man who would ever become my foe. My answer was that I would ever protect and shield you. That I have done. Forgive all else. I am but a soldier.\n\n\"W. T. SHERMAN.\"\n\nOrders were immediately given to the soldiers to replace what they had taken, while a guard was stationed about the mansion to protect it from further molestation. Even iron will melt in the heat of a blaze fervent enough to soften it; and for the sake of an old love affair of his youth, the grim despoiler spared Shellman Heights. Sentiment often crops out in unexpected places. Now and then we find violets growing in the clefts of volcanic rocks. Sherman moved on. Later came Hooker, who learning the same particulars in regard to the ownership of the mansion issued the same order to his troops.\n\nIt is said that another unsuccessful suitor for the hand of this beautiful southern ^woman was gallant Dick Garnett, a young West Pointer, in charge of the arsenal at Augusta, then the girlhood home of Miss Stovall. To the handsome youth's proposal of marriage, the fair object of his affection was by no means indifferent. But the young girl's father did not favor this match. The lovers were forbidden to meet and the obstinate lass was finally sent to visit relatives in South Carolina. There was probably no objection to the young man himself. The best Virginia blood rippled his veins; but his profession was hazardous and his income small. Mr. Stovall wished to see his daughter wedded to a lord of many acres. In this whim he was gratified. While visiting the Palmetto State, Miss Cecilia smiled on the suit of a gentleman to whom her father interposed no objection arid whose means enabled him to build for his bride the beautiful old home on the Etowah. But the young officer whose suit she was forced to decline always remained true to his first love. He never married; and when he fell on the battlefield of Gettysburg, in 1863, the image of sweet Cecilia Stovall still ruled the heart of Gen. Richard B. Garnett, one of the, bravest soldiers in the army of Northern Virginia.*\n\nJEFFERSON DAVIS'S ARREST\n\nTwo miles from Irwinville, Georgia, in what is today a dense thicket of pines, there occurred at the close of the Civil war an incident concern ing which a host of writers have produced for commercial purposes an endless amount of fiction. It was here, in the gray morning twilight of May 10, 1865, while encamped on land today the property of Judge J. B. Clement, of Irwinville, that Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, was overtaken by the Fourth Regiment of Michigan Cavalry and put under arrest. More than half a century lias elapsed since then: and happidly with the flight of time some of the fairy tales of this dramatic period, when the imagination was inflamed by passion, have been dispelled. To prejudice the popular mind against Mr. Davis and to bring upon him speedily the punishment to which he was exposed\n\n* 'Vol. I, \"Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1275\n\nby reason of his fallen fortunes, there appeared in the northern papers a story concocted by some evil genius with malice aforethought to the effect that when arrested the President was clad in his wife.'s calico wrapper and that, among other articles of feminine attire which he wore at this time, were a hoop-skirt and a sun-bonnet.\n\nShades of Ananias! The facts are these: Mrs. Davis, with four of her children, left the Confederate capital, under an escort, several days in advance of the final evacuation of Richmond. Mr. Davis followed in the course of a week's time, proceeding southward by slow stages. It was not until Lee and Johnston had both surrendered that he ceased to cherish some hope of ultimate success. After the final meeting of the Confederate Cabinet in AYashington, Georgia, he leisurely resumed his journey toward the trans-Mississippi region, there quietly at home to await results. It was not in the character of a fugitive that he bade adieu to his friends in the little Georgia town; and so deliberate was he in the matter of saying farewell that Dr. H. A. Tupper, an eminent Baptist divine with whom he stopped, turned to Judge Garnett Andrews and said:\n\n'' I really believe that Mr. Davis wishes to be captured.'' It is certain that he manifested every sign of indifference, though he must have known that the country was full of armed men who were panting like blood-hounds upon his track. Word having reached him of a conspiracy on the part of desperate men to rob the wagon train in which Mrs. Davis was journeying, he hastened to overtake her, going some distance out of the direct line of travel. Such a change in his plans meant that he was certain to be either arrested or killed; and, turning to the faithful comrades in misfortune who accompanied him, Mr. Davis urged them to feel in nowise bound to attend him upon this hazardous trip. But not a man in the party availed himself of this loop hole to escape danger, , Mrs. Davis, in the course of time, was finally overtaken; and the President, with his party, was preparing to move in advance of her when, just at the hour of dawn, on May 10, 1865, he was suddenly halted. Besides the members of his family there were with Mr. Davis at the time the arrest was made, Postmaster-General John H. Reagan; Captain Moody, of Mississippi, an old friend; Governor Lubbock, of Texas; and two members of his personal staff, Col. Burton Harrison and Col. William, P. Johnston. At this point we will let PostmasterGeneral Reagan continue the thread of the narrative. Says he:'\n\n; \"Under cover of the darkness, Colonel Pritchard (a Federal officer) moved to where we were, and posted one battalion in front of us and another across the creek in our rear, and each took the other in the dimness of the morning for Confederates. Both .battalions were armed with repeating rifles and a rapid fusillade occurred between them, with the result that one or two were killed and a few Wounded. When this firing occurred the troops in our front galloped upon us. The major of the regiment reached the place where I and the members of the Pres ident's staff were encamped, about a hundred yards distant from where the President and his family were located. When he approached me I was watching a struggle between two Federal soldiers and Governor\n\n1276\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nLubbock. They were trying to get his horse and saddle bags away from him and he was holding onto them and refusing to give them up; they threatened to shoot him if he did not, and he replied for he was not as good a Presbyterian then as he is now that they might shoot and be damned but they would not rob him while he was alive and looking on. I had my revolver cocked and in my hand, waiting to see if the shooting was to begin.\n\n\"Just at this moment the major rode up, the men contending with Lubbock disappeared, and the major asked if I had any arms. I drew my revolver from under the skirt of my coat and said to him, ' I have this.' He observed that I had better give it to him. I knew that they were too many for us and surrendered my pistol. I asked him then if he had not better stop the firing across the creek. He inquired whether it was not our men. I told him that it could not be; that I did not know of an armed Confederate within a hundred miles of us, except our little escort of half a dozen men, who were not then with us. We learned afterwards that they, or the most of them, had been captured at Irwinville. The major rode across the creek and put an end to the skirmish.\n\n\"When the firing began, President Davis afterwards told me, he supposed it to be the work of the men who were to rob Mrs. Davis's train. So he remarked to his wife: ' Those men have attacked us at last; I will go out and see if I cannot stop the firing; surely I have some authority with the Confederates.' Upon going to the tent door, however, he saw the blue-coats and turned to his wife with the words, 'The Federal cavalry are upon us.' He was made a prisoner of war.\n\n\"As one of the means of making the Confederate cause odious, the foolish and wicked charge was made that he was captured in woman's clothes; besides which his portrait, showing him in petticoats, was after wards placarded generally in show cases and public places in the North. He was also pictured as having bags of gold on him when captured. This charge is disproven by the circumstances attending his capture. The suddenness of the unexpected attack of the enemy allowed no time for a change of clothes. I saw him a few minutes after his surrender, wearing his accustomed suit of Confederate gray.''\n\nColonel William P. Johnston confirms the postmaster-general's state ment in regard to the President's apparel. Says he: \"Mr. Davis was dressed as usual. He had on a knit woolen visor, which he always wore at night for neuralgia; and his cavalry boots. He complained of chilli ness, saying that some one had taken away his raglan or spring overcoit, sometimes called a waterproof. I had one exactly similar, except in color. I went to look for it and either I, or some one at my instance, found it and he wore it afterwards. His own was not restored.\" Gov ernor Lubbock testifies to the same effect. Mr. James H. Parker, of Elburnville, Pennsylvania, a Federal soldier who witnessed the arrest, makes this statement: \"I am no adftiirer of Jeff Davis. I am a Yankee, full of Yankee prejudice; but I think it wicked to lie about him or even about the devil. He did not have on at the time he was taken any such garment as is worn by women. He did have over his shoulders a waterproof article of clothing, something like a Havelock. It was not\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1277\n\nin the least concealed. He wore a hat and did not carry a pail of water on his head.\" Mr. T. H. Peabody, a lawyer of St. Louis, one of the captors of Mr. Davis, declared in a speech before Ransom Post, of the G. A. R., that the hoop-skirt story was purely a fabrication of newspaper reporters. So the whole affair resolves itself into something like the compliment which an old parson paid one of his deacons in the churcti:\n\n\"Said Parson Bland to Deacon Bluff, Seated before the fire:\n\n'Deacon, I like you well enough, But you're an awful liar.' \" *\n\nHow THE TEXAN FLAG ORIGINATED\n\nIt is a well authenticated fact that the famous \"Lone Star\" flag of Texas was born on the soil of Georgia. This beautiful emblem, which was destined to .win historic immortality at Goliad, was designed by a young lady of Crawford County, in this state: Miss Joanna E. Troutman. The following account has been condensed from a brief history of the flag, written by Macon's pioneer historian, Mr. John C. Butler, who was thoroughly conversant with the facts. His story is corroborated by an article recently found in an old copy of the Galveston News. Says Mr. Butler:\n\n\"On November 12, 1835, a public meeting was held in Macon. Rob ert Augustus Beall, John Rutherford, and Samuel M. Strong were among the speakers who endorsed the claims of Texas, Lieutenant Hugh M. McLeod, from West Point, addressed the meeting in a spirited appeal, pledging himself to resign his commission and to embark as a volunteer. He declared that what Texas needed was soldiers not resolutions.\n\n\" Captain Levi Eckley, commander of the Bibb Cavalry, presided, with Simri Rose as secretary. Colonel William A. Ward, of Macon, pro posed to form a company of infantry to enlist in the Army of Texas, whereupon thirty-two gentlemen came forward and enrolled as volun teers. On motion, the chair appointed General R. A. Beall, Colonel H. G. Lamar, Colonel T. G. Holt, James A. Nisbet, Esq., and Dr. Robert Collins, a committee to solicit subscriptions; and before the meeting adjourned $3,150 was handed in to the committee, Dr. Collins paying in cash the greater part of the amount.\n\n\"As the company passed through other towns en route to Texas other recruits were added. At Knoxville, in Crawford County, Miss Joanna E. Troutman afterwards Mrs. Vinson a daughter of Hiram B'. Troutman, made and sent a beautiful banner of white silk, with a blue lone star upon it, to Lieutenant McLeod to present to the company at Columbus. The following is a copy of the letter acknowledging the receipt of the flag:\n\n\" ' COLUMBUS, GA., November 23, 1835. \" 'Miss JOANNA:\n\n\" 'Colonel Ward brought your handsome and appropriate flag as a present to the Georgia Volunteers in the cause of Texas and Liberty.\n\n' Vol. I, '' Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\n1278\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nI was fearful from the shortness of the time that you would not be able\n\nto finish it as tastefully as you would wish, but I assure you, without an\n\nemotion of flattery, it is beautiful, and with us the value is enhanced by\n\nthe recollection of the donor. I thank you for the honor of being the\n\nmedium of presentation to the company; and, if they are what every\n\ntrue Georgian ought to be, your flag will yet wave over fields of victory\n\nin defiance of despotism. I hope the proud day may soon arrive, and\n\nwhile your star presides none can doubt of success.\n\n\" 'Very respectfully your friend,\n\nSigned:\n\n\" 'Hirei-i\n\n\"This patriotic standard, made in Crawford County, by Miss Troutman, became renowned in the history of the gallant young republic as the first flag of the Lone Star State ever unfurled on Texas soil! As they were not permitted to organize within the limits of the United States, Colonel Ward proceeded with his followers to Texas, where they were organized according to regulations. He gathered about one hun dred and twenty men who were formed into three companies. These were then organized into a battalion, the officers of which were: Wil liam A. Ward, major; William J. Mitehell, surgeon; David I. Holt, .quartermaster; and Henderson Cozart, assistant quartermaster. The captains were: W. A. 0. Wadsworth, James C. Winn and Uriah J.\n\nBulloch. \"After several engagements with the Mexicans, the battalion joined\n\nthe command of Colonel Pannin and formed a regiment by electing Fannin colonel and Ward lieutenant-colonel. The regiment numbered five hundred and was stationed at Fort Goliad. On March 13, 1836, the original battalion, under Ward, was sent thirty miles to the relief of Captain King who had thirty men protecting a number of families in the neighborhood of a church at the mission of Refugio. On the arrival of the battalion, they found Captain King surrounded by a large force i of Mexicans who disappeared on discovering that he was re-enforced. Afterwards, on leaving the mission, King, with his command, was cap\n\ntured and killed. '' Re-enforced to the number of fourteen hundred men, the Mexicans\n\nthen intercepted Ward, who retired to the church. Breast-works were made by the battalion of pews, grave-stones, fences and other things, and the fire of the Mexicans was resisted for two days, with a loss to the enemy of one hundred and fifty men, and of only six to the Ameri cans. But the ammunition of the battalion was exhausted on the third day of the battle, when Colonel Ward was reluctantly forced to capitu late, signing the regular articles according to the rules of war.\n\n\"It was stipulated that the battalion would be returned to'the United States in eight days. Colonel Fannin, in the meantime, sent four differ ent couriers to ascertain the cause of Ward's delay, each of whom was captured and shot by the Mexicans. The latter were again heavily reenforced and advanced upon Fort Goliad. Ward's battalion was in cluded in this massacre, having been brought in as prisoners of war.\n\n\"From an old copy of the Galveston News the following account is taken: ' The flag of the Lone Star which was first unfurled in Texas\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1279\n\nwas borne by the Georgia battalion, commanded by the late LieutenantColonel AYard, who with almost his entire command was massacred at Goliad, in the spring of 1836, in what is known as \"Fannin's Massacre,\" he being next in command to the lamented Colonel James W. Pannin. The flag was presented to Colonel Ward's command as they passed through Knoxville, Crawford County, Ga., by the beautiful Miss Joanna E. Troutman. It was made of plain white silk, bearing an azure star of five points. On one. side was the inscription in rich but chaste colors: \"Liberty or Death\"; and, on the other, the patriotic Latin motto : \"Ubi Liber tas habitat, ibi nostra patria est.\" '\n\n\"The flag was .first unfurled at Velasco on January 8, 1836. It floated to the breeze from the same liberty pole with the first flag of Independence which had just been brought from Goliad by the valorous Captain William Brown. What became of the flag of Independence we do not know, but the beautiful star of azure was borne by Fannin's regi ment to Goliad,'and there gracefully floated from the staff. On March' 8, 1836, an express arrived at Goliad from Washington, oil the Brazos, officially announcing that the convention then in session had formally made solemn declaration that Texas was no longer a Mexican province but a free and independent republic.\n\n\"Amid the roar of artillery, the beautiful 'Banner of the Lone Star' was hoisted to the top off the flag staff, where it proudly streamed over the hoary ramparts and the time-shattered battlements of La Bahia. But just as the sunset gun was fired and the usual attempt was made to lower the colors, by some unlucky mishap, the beautiful silk banner be came entangled in the halyards and was torn to pieces. Only a small fragment remained adjusted to the flag staff; and when Colonel Fannin evacuated Goliad to join General Houston, in accordance with received' orders, the last remnant of the first 'Flag of the Lone Star' was still fluttering at the top of the staff from which first-floated the flag of Texari Independence.\n\n\"With the capture of Santa Anna, at the battle of San Jacinto, the silver service of the wily commander was also captured, and some of the trophies of victory, including his massive forks and spoons, were forwarded by General Rusk to Miss Troutman, in token of the regard which this Georgia lady had inspired in the stern, scarred patriots of the Revolution. On the meeting of the first Congress, the Flag of the Lone Star was adopted as the flag of the Republic and the seals of office ordered engraved with the star upon them. The public recognition of the ma ternity of the first Flag of the Lone Star as belonging to Georgia was made by General Memmican Hunt, the first minister from the Republic of Texas to the United States.\" *\n\nHow A FAMOUS BALLAD CAME TO BE WRITTEN\n\nIn the opinion of many competent literary critics, a war poem which deservedly ranks among the finest ballads in the English language is \"Little Giffen of Tennessee.\" The author of this poem, Dr. Frank 0. Ticknor, was an eminent physician of Columbus, Georgia, and, in making\n\n* Arol. I, '' Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\n1280\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nthe rounds of his country practice, he often anmsed himself by dashing off spirited lines, not a few of which were-written on the backs of pre scription blanks. Doctor Ticknor's verses, while lacking, perhaps, in literary finish, are full of lyric fire. Most of them are merely song skele tons, but they possess a rhythm most captivating to the ear. \"Little Giffen\" was written during the last year of the war. The circumstances which led to its composition are narrated in the following graphic sketch from the pen of Col. Charles J. Swift, a resident of the City of Colum bus and a prominent member of the Georgia bar. It is the first authentic version of the story which has yet appeared in print. Says Colonel Swift:\n\n\"After the battle of Chickamauga, there was continual fighting be tween the two hostile armies from Dalton to the Chattahoochie River. The pressure of the advancing enemy was persistent, but at every stand he was opposed by the stubborn resistance of the retreating foe, under Gen. Johnston, who adopted the tactics of the famous Roman general Pabius Maximus, in order to draw Gen. Sherman from his base of sup plies. Gen. Johnston was removed in the summer of 1864, and the determination of what the final issue of his plans might have been has become purely a matter of speculation.\n\n\"Gen. Hood succeeded Gen. Johnston in command. Subsequent to the battles of Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, etc., the cities and towns which could be conveniently reached by train from Atlanta began to receive a great many sick and wounded Confederate soldiers. These increased as Johnston's army approached Atlanta, and the battles be tween Hood and Sherman caused every available building in these cities and towns,to be converted into Confederate hospitals. One of these in Columbus was the old Banks building on the east side of Broad street, nearly opposite the fire engine house. One of the inmates of this hospital was a mere youth, so badly wounded in one of his legs, that gangrene had supervened.\n\n\"Dr. Carlisle Terry, then and afterwards a leading physician of Columbus, was the general surgeon in charge of the hospitals. Mrs. Evelyn P. Carter, Mrs. W. D. Woolfolk and Mrs. Rosa N. Ticknor were sisters, who, with other ladies of Columbus, made frequent visits to the hospitals to minister to the sick a-nd wounded. These sisters were the daughters of Major Thos. M. Nelson, formerly of Virginia, -and related to the Byrds, Pages and Nelsons, who have been distinguished in the Old Dominion from the earliest Colonial days.\n\n\"In going through the old Banks building hospital, Mrs. Ticknor and her sisters came to the cot on which was lying the wounded youth. He was very young, and was wasted away to a mere skeleton, and so weak and emaciated that he seemed more dead than alive. Moved by an unusual sympathy and motherly tenderness that the sacrifice of war and the toll of battle should include one so young, they asked permission to remove him and to take him to one of their homes. Dr. Terry looked at the apparently dying soldier lad and consented to his removal but said somewhat sardonically to the visitors, that they would probably be put to the trouble of sending him back dead, in a day or two.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1281\n\n\"Following these preliminaries at the hospital, Newton Giffen was taken to the home of Dr. and Mrs. Ticknor, at Torch Hill, five miles south of Columbus. For days and nights the unequal struggle went on, between the faintest signs of life in the patient and the gangrenous poison which pervaded his system. But Torch Hill was on the heights where the breezes were refreshing and the air pure and balmy, and there 'Little Giffen' had a physician's attention and the gentlest nursing from the host, her sisters, and others in this Southern home. When he had somewhat advanced toward recovery he told them that he was New ton Giffen from East Tennessee, where his mother was still living; that he could neither read nor write; that since he had enlisted in the army he had been in eighteen battles and had been wounded seriously for the first time by the one which had brought him to his present affliction.\n\n\"Dr. Douglas C. Ticknor, son of the poet, is now a practicing phy sician in Columbus. To avoid seeming anachronisms in the recital, this Dr. Ticknor will be in several places spoken of as Douglas. He was about six years younger than Newton Giffen, but as the eldest of the Ticknor children, he well remembers the request his mother and aunts made to take Newton from the hospital, and he has never forgotten his impressions of Dr. Terry's manner and expression, betokening the utter uselessness of the change to save the life of the patient.\n\n\"At Torch Hill, Newton's improvement was slow and protracted. When he was able to sit up and to prop himself on his elbow, he took his first daily lessons in the art of reading and writing. This latter accom plishment enabled him to pen his first letter to his mother far away in the wilderness of her Tennessee mountain home. The second letter was to his captain. The one written to his mother probably never reached its destination, but the one to his captain did, and the answer was almost literally as the poem has it. When Newton was able to get out of doors, he and Douglas Ticknor were good chums and companions. The latter recalls that Newton was very industrious, gave a great deal of attention to the wrapping of the apple trees to keep the rabbits from eating the bark, and that both of them went forth on occasions to pick blackberry leaves to make green tea. Dr. Douglas Ticknor describes Newton as hav ing very light hair, fair complexion, of unusual tallness for his age, and very thin.\n\n\"Before he had entirely recovered, Newton received a letter from his captain urging him to return to his company at the earliest possible moment. On receipt of this letter, Newton made preparations for an immediate start. He -bade a tearful farewell to Dr. and Sirs. Ticknor and all the members of the family and promised, if spared, to write to them. His manly character and bearing, his sincerity and gratitude, left no room for doubt that he would write at the first opportunity; but no letter ever came. Hence the inference by those who were looking for a letter from their former charge, that he had been killed in the first engagement after his return to the front. This is the only statement in the poem which cannot be positively substantiated. All others are actual facts go much so, indeed, that when Dr. Ticknor wrote 'Little Giffen,'\n\nhe read the first draft of it to Mrs. Ticknor and was about to tear it up,\n\n1282\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nremarking 'it was too true to be good poetry.' Mrs. Ticknor interposed\n\nand saved the poem from destruction.\n\n'' On the morning when Newton Giffen left Torch Hill on his way to\n\nhis company, passage was taken on an old gray army horse, Newton\n\nriding in front and Douglas riding behind. Getting near to Bull Creek\n\nbridge, about half way between Torch Hill and Columbus, they found\n\nthe waters of the creek at flood height and covering all the lower lands\n\non the side of their approach to the bridge. The old horse, getting a\n\nlittle off the road where the water covered it, fell into a big washout and\n\nin struggling to extricate themselves, both of the boys were unhorsed, and\n\ncame near being swept down the stream and drowned. Douglas Ticknor\n\nand the horse got ashore on the side next to home. 'Little Giffen' was\n\ncarried by the current to a point where he gained a footing close to the\n\nbridge. About the time the excitement and danger was over, a negro\n\ndrove up with a four-mule team on his way to Columbus. He kept in\n\nthe track of the submerged road and met with no mishap such as that\n\nto the boys and the old gray horse. With no other possession than his\n\ndripping and muddy clothes, 'Little Giffen' climbed into the four-horse\n\nwagon and standing up waved a last farewell to his friend, Douglas, on\n\nthe other side of the raging waters.\n\n/\n\n\"It is said by some that Newton, was wounded in the battle of Murfreesboro. However, it is more probable that he was wounded in the bat tle of Cbickamauga, Sept. 10, 1863. This would not be inconsistent with the order of time belonging to the events of which the poem treats. The letter that Newton received urging his return, was very likely co-eval with the general order by Johnston for his officers and captains to get every man back to his command -who might be able to return.\n\n\"Many of the surviving veterans of the army of Tennessee under Johnston remember the urgency of these recalls. It is very well estab lished that 'Little Giffen's' name was.Isaac Newton Giffen, and that his father was a blacksmith. He was brought to Columbus in September, 1863. and left Torch Hill in March, 1864. The big overflow at Bull creek bridge was presumably from the equinoctial storm,\n\n\"Johnston took command of the army of Tennessee in December, 1864. The winter having ended, the operations known as the DaltonAtlanta campaign commenced in the spring, after this; and it is more than likely that in making readiness for this campaign, 'Little Giffen' and other absentees received notices to return to the front. Dr. Ticknor was born in Jones county, Georgia, and in 1874 he died in Columbus, Ga., in his fifty-second year: He is buried in -Linwood cemetery, in Columbus. Mrs. Ticknor is in her eightieth year (1909), and is living in Albany, Ga,, with her son, Mr. Thos. M. Ticknor.\"*\n\nSuch in brief is the history of this famous ballad whose exquisite versification has charmed the ears of thousands on both sides of the water. The poem has been translated into numerous foreign tongues.

It is practically certain that Little Giffen fell in battle soon after leaving Torch Hill. The character of the lad, his promise to write if spared, the kindness which was lavished upon him by devoted friends, the sense of gratitude which he must have felt for favors received, and the long silence which followed his departure, these preclude the suppo sition that he could possibly have survived the clash into which he again plunged. Doubtless he was numbered among the unknown dead in one of the battles which occurred soon thereafter; but Doctor Ticknor has happily rescued the lad's name from oblivion and blazed it immortally upon the heights of song.\n\nHISTORY OF \"MARYLAND, MY MARYLAND\"\n\nIt is not the least among the favors which Fortune has showered upon Augusta that it was long the home of the gifted poet who wrote the immortal war lyric, \"Maryland, My Maryland.\" James Ryder Randall, its author, though a Marylander by birth, was a Georgian by adoption. For many years he was an editorial writer on the staff of the famous Chronicle, and today his ashes rest in Augusta's beautiful city of the dead. Mr. Randall was educated at Georgetown, D. C.; afterwards he taught for a while in Poydras College, in Louisiana, and then he drifted to New Orleans. On account of hemorrhages frorii the lungs he was mustered out of the service soon after enlistment in 1861; but there was not a soldier in the ranks who possessed more of the fire of battle. He resided for a \"brief period in Anniston, Alabama, where he edited the Hot-Blast; but, to quote a terse commentator, '' for Randall to be at the head of a journal devoted to such hard facts as pig iron looks to us like putting Saladin to carving gate-pegs with a scimitar.''\n\nMr. Randall was at one time private secretary to Congressman Wil liam IT. Fleming, of Georgia, afterwards to Sen. Joseph B. Brown; and, during this period, he was brought into close personal contact with many national celebrities. His Washington letters were widely copied and arestill replete with interest to the student of politics. Says Prof. Matthew Page Andrews, his accredited biographer:*'\n\n\"Except for these visits to Washington, Randall established himself, for forty years or more, far from his native city and State. But in 1907, under the auspices of the appreciative Edwin Warfield, then Governor of Maryland, a plan was suggested for the official recognition and ma terial support of the poet who had so immortalized his State in song. He was the guest of the city of Baltimore in the home-coming festivities of 1907. He renewed his friendship with the Hon. William Pinkney White, then at the age of 84, an active member of the United States Senate, who made arrangements for the publication of his poems, the compilation of which his later and most devoted friend, Miss Lilian McGregor Shepherd alone was able to induce him seriously to begin. To her was penned his last words of longing for his native State of Mary-\n\n* The '' Poems of James Eyder BandaH,'' edited by Matthew Page Andrews, New York, 1910.

Sustained by an unfaltering religious faith, he had no fear of dying, but his days had been the days of a dreamer, buffeted by a sea of troubles. He gave the best he had to his friends; his life to his home and family; to his native State an immortal name; and to the English language per haps the greatest of all battle-hymns.\"\n\nProfessor Andrews thus narrates the circumstances under which the famous song was composed. Says he:\n\n\"The date was April 23, 1861. Mr. Kandall was then at Poydras College, in Louisiana. The poem was inspired during the sleepless night which followed the reading of an account of the clash between the citi zens of Baltimore and the Sixth Massachusetts marching through the city to Southern soil, in which the first citizen to fall was a friend and college mate of the poet. Kandall was then but twenty-two years of age. Poy dras College was a tolerably well-endowed Creole institution at PointCoupee. But subsequent fires have destroyed every object associated with the writing of 'Maryland, My Maryland,' from the desk of the poet-teacher to the buildings of the college itself. The morning after the composition was finished the poet read it to his English classes, who received it with enthusiasm. Upon being urged to publish it, the youth ful instructor at once sent the manuscript to the New Orleans Delta, where it first appeared on April 26, 1861; and from this paper the words were reprinted by newspapers throughout the Southern States.\n\n\"In Maryland the poem was first published several weeks later in a paper, the South, established in Baltimore by Thomas W. Hall, who was shortly thereafter confined in Fort Warren for spreading such seditious sentiments. It was published in various forms in the poet's native city of Baltimore, where it was evident that a majority of the leading people, through close association with Southerners in business and social relations, sympathized with the South and were bitterly op posed to the intended coercion of the seceding States. While the words and sentiments of the song thrillmgly appealed to Southern sympathizers, the music lovers of Baltimore saw in the swing and melody of the verse unexampled opportunity for some immediate musical adaptation in song. Henry C. Wagner, of the poet's native city, was the first to sing it to the tune of 'Ma Nonnandie,' then a familiar air. But though the French language was the means of starting the poem upon its melodious song-life, it was through the medium of the German that it reached the final form in which it now appears.\n\n\"Among the famous beauties of Baltimore in 1861 were the Gary sisters, to whose home as loyal Southerners 'My Maryland' soon came. The fiery appeal to Southern valor was declaimed again and again by one of these, Miss Jennie Gary, to her sister Hettie, with the expressed intention of finding an appropriate musical accompaniment for the verses; and this search was continued until the popular 'Lauriger Horatius' was tried and thereupon adopted. The risk of reducing it to pub lication was somewhat serious, but Miss Rebecca Lloyd Nicholson spoke out: ' I will have it published. . My father is a Union man, and if I am put in prison, he will take me out.' She then took 'Lauriger Hora-\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1285\n\ntins' in a Yale song-book to her father's house near-by; and after copy ing the music carried it to Miller and Beacham. They supplied her with the first copies from the press, besides sending her other songs until they were arrested and put in prison.\" There were some minor variations made in the text to fit the music. Says Miss Jennie Gary: '' The addi tional 'My Maryland' was a musical necessity and it came to me as a sort of inspiration.\" It has been stated that Mr. Rozier Dulaney, of Baltimore, originally proposed this addition; but to Miss Gary belongs the credit.\n\nAccording to Professor Andrews it was furthermore an extraordinary coincidence that the young girl, Miss Rebecca Lloyd Nicholson,* who undertook to have the song published on her own responsibility, should have been the grand-daughter of Judge Joseph H. Nicholson, whose wife, Rebecca Lloyd, figured so largely in adapting '' The Star Spangled Ban ner\" to the tune of \"Anacreon in Heaven,\" and who had it published in musical form. Says he: \"The grand-daughter carried the words and music of 'Maryland, My Maryland' to the publishers in 1861 as her 'grand-mother had done with the 'Star-Spangled Banner' nearly fifty years before.'' Subsequently Charles Ellerbrock, a young German music teacher and a southern sympathizer, changed the musical adaptation of '' My Maryland'' from the Yale song to the statelier measure of its origi nal, \"Tannenbaum, 0 Tannenbaum\"; and in this way it was finally per fected.! Subsequent to .the first battle of Manassas, the famous war-lyric was rendered for the first time at the headquarters of General Beauregard, near Fairfax Court House, Virginia, by the Gary sisters, on July 4, 18614\n\nOliver Wen dell Holmes pronounced \"Maryland, My Maryland\" the finest anthem produced 6y the Civil war. He is also said to have placed it among the very foremost of the world's martial lyrics. But while the author's fame will rest undoubtedly upon this gem, there are many com petent critics who consider his '' Resurgam'' in no wise inferior. To this number belongs ex-Congressman William H. Fleming, who places it, in point of merit, even, above Cardinal Newman 's '' Lead Kindly Light.'' Though importuned'to cast his lot in the North, where larger salaries were offered, Randall refused to leave his beloved Southland. He often felt the pinch of adverse fortune, but he was never charmed by the glitter of gold. It is of interest to note that Randall was the first to plead effectively the cause of an American memorial to Edgar Allan Poe, and to his loyal pen is due the hastening, in some degree at least,, of the final reward into which the .author of the \"Raven\" has at last come.

The fact is that an appreciative reader and friend sent him, as author of the poem, some time after its publication, $100 in Confederate currency, with which he may possibly have been able to pur chase a pair of shoes, but he did not solicit or receive direct compensation for any of his poems, a statement which, in all probability, can be recorded of no other modern poet of genius or reputation.\"\n\nVol. Ill 2\n\n1286\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nare notes of bitterness in the great war-lyric of Randall, they were wrung from his loving heart by the passionate hour in which they were penned. He was himself the apostle of tenderness; and one needs only to turn to the poems of Whittier to find that the gentle Quaker bard of New Eng land has indulged in no less caustic terms. There can be no doubt that the poem will live. The breath of immortality is in its lines, and the fame of Randall is secure even from death itself.*\n\nBARNSLEY GARDENS : A LOST ARCADIA\n\nSix miles from Kingston, Georgia, may still be seen the picturesque ruins of a palatial old southern home of the ante-bellum days. It is a sort of Alhambra, not unlike the wasted citadel of the Moors. The locality is today known by the name of Barnsley Gardens; and, standing amid the pathetic remnants of this old estate, once feudal in magnifi cence, it is not difficult for the imagination to picture here a castle, with ivy-covered walls, such as might have overlooked the Rhine or the Danube in the Middle Ages. To a resident of Kingston, Miss Belle Bayless, who has often visited this historic spot, we are indebted for the following brief account:\n\n\"Three-quarters of a century ago, Mr. Godfrey Barnsley, one of Savannah's captains of industry, decided to establish such an estate as he remembered to have seen in England, his native land. So he pur chased from the Cherokee Indians 10,000 acres of ground in what is now the county of Bartow. Gradually he cleared away the forest and tixrned the red hills into cotton fields and built a stately manor house where it overlooked a magnificent sweep of country, reaching far back until blue hills merged into bluer skies. He then planted around it the famous gardens which for two generations have been a. Mecca for pleasure seek ers and holiday excursionists in this part of Georgia,\n\n\"To embellish the gardens, rare trees and shrubs and plants were brought hither from the most remote corners of the earth. Some of these still flourish amid the decay into which everything else has fallen. Hem locks and spruces from Norway may still be seen brushing the old ter races with verdant branches of evergreen. Scotch rowans glow with scarlet berries in the autumn. Lindens and other foreign shade trees vie with those of the native woods in adding pieturesqueness to the naturally beautiful location; while great lichen-covered boulders, hauled by oxteams from the surrounding mountain-tops, form rookeries on either side of the main entrance to the grounds. The drive-way sweeps up the long hill and around the box-bordered area which encloses a central foun tain just in front of an embroidered terrace. Mr. Barnsley, like his forebears, built always with an eye to the future and did not hasten his work. So the Civil War came on before the interior of the house was finished and the gold which he had sent to England came back to reenforce the coffers of the Confederate government.\n\n\"Domestic industries were fostered on this baronial estate of Mr. Barnsley; for not only the manor house itself but the quarters for serv ants and the small office buildings on the estate were constructed of brick ^\n\n* Vol. I, \"Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1287\n\nmade by slave labor from materials found on the plantation. The pala tial old home place was divided into three parts the central being two stories in height and surmounted by a tower. The main entrance to the house was approached by marble steps. On either side of the hallway were spacious drawing rooms, libraries, and the like, with sleeping apart ments above, sixteen in all. The right wing contained an immense dining room or banquet hall, on the first floor, besides billiard and smoking rooms, with kitchen, store rooms, and cellars below. The left wing was used for temporary residence purposes while the rest of the building was in process of erection. The owner was not to be deprived of any of the luxuries of life merely because he lived in the country; so, on the tower, a cistern was built to which pipes were laid and a reservoir constructed in one of the chimneys to furnish hot water for the lava tories. Plans were also made for lighting the house by means of a gas made from resinous pine.\n\n'' In the rear of the manor house is another terrace; and here we find a ghost walk, for a castle without a promenade for spooks at the witching hour of midnight is romantically incomplete. Just over the brow of the hill is the grave of Colonel Earl, a Confederate officer, who was buried on the spot where he fell during the Civil War. Relatives .came to re move his body but they could get no one to dig into the earth, so strong was the superstitious feeling among the mountaineers; and even to this day the locality furnishes material for weird tales among the country folks.\n\n\"At the foot of the slope is one of the prettiest spots in which the imagination could possibly revel. It is the ivy-covered spring-house set against the out-cropping gray rock. Inside a bold spring bubbles up and finds its way out and across the fields, where it becomes a good-sized stream. And who could wish better dairy products than the milk and butter cooled in such pure water ? One can almost fancy here a sprightly Lady Betty presiding over the burnished vessels and scolding her maids for some trivial neglect; or more realistic still, Madame Barnsley nee Miss Scarlett, one of the South's great beauties standing in the shadow of the half-circle of live-oaks about the door, directing her servants as does her grand-daughter, the present chatelaine.\n\n\"But Mr. Barnsley, in gratifying his artistic tastes, did not stop with plants and flowers for his extensive grounds. He was also an industrious collector of rare \"curios, objects of virtu, costly bric-a-brac, and expensive ornaments. His mahogany dining-table which was large enough to seat forty people and his elegant side-board, which was of equally generous proportions, were made for Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil. The gilt library clock once belonged to Marie Antoinette; and an exquisite mar quetry table, together with several delicate wood carvings, had bits of history connected with them. Over the dining room fire-place hung a rare painting. Its wealth of color undimmed by several centuries and its resemblance to Murillo's Madonnas told of the influence of the great Spanish master; while a built-in vault contained a quantity of family silver. In one of the bed-rooms was a mahogany bed-stead of huge pro portions, but the four eagles intended to surmount the posts stood demurely in a corner, for not even the high ceiling of this spacious\n\n1288\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nboudoir would permit them to occupy the places intended for them as guardians of the curtains of yellow satin damask. Wardrobe and dresser matched the bed, all heavy, hand-carved and handsome.\n\n\"But these, together with a quantity of rare old wine, were taken to New York a decade ago and sold, the dealers paying only a song for what was worth almost a king's ransom.\n\n\"Today the Last Sigh of the Moor seems aptly to fit the old place. Time has wrought fearful havoc. The Barnsley household has scattered to every continent on the globe; a cyclone unroofed the main house years ago; members of a vandal picnic party daubed tar over the front walls, while others amused themselves by shattering- window panes; and the one time immaculate flower beds are now waist-high in weeds. It is well nigh impossible to maintain so large an establishment now-a-days, when labor for necessary work can scarcely be obtained for love or money; but rich minerals recently discovered on the property may yet provide the means not only for making needed repairs but for realizing the splendid dream of the founder of Barnsley Gardens.\" *\n\nTHE MARK HANNA HOME: WHERE THE McKiNLEY PRESIDENTIAL BOOM WAS LAUNCHED\n\nMany years have elapsed since the political wheel of fortune rotated William McKinley into the White House in AVashington; but the world has not forgotten the meteoric campaign of 1896. It was an epoch-mak ing fight. The tall figure of the peerless Ncbraskan in this heated contest began to loom for the first time across the western plains. His conquest of the Chicago convention was the wonder of modern politics. Nothing to equal the dramatic effect of his marvelous \"Cross of Gold\" speech has even been known-in the history of conventions. To this very day there are democrats in every part of the Union who look upon Bryan as a mere dreamer, who deplore the great scenic battle which he waged for free silver, at the famous ratio of sixteen to one, who call him an apostle of discontent, and who belittle his splendid abilities. But the fact remains that he was the herald of a new era in national politics. Nor can it be gainsaid that the campaign of 1896 was the cradle of the present-day progressive movement. Mr. Bryan's eloquence lashed the masses into a frenzy of enthusiasm. The spell of his personality was felt in the crowded centers of population and-in the sparsely settled rural districts. The money power was panic-stricken with alarm. Wall Street stood aghast, The program of the republican organization seemed to be queered. And altogether it is doubtful if there has ever been a campaign in which the rattle of coin has played a more spectacular part; but despite the combined activities of the trusts to defeat him Bryan might still have been elected President of the United States had it not been for the shrewd generalship of a man to whom the country at large still needed an introduction when the campaign opened, but whose name was destined to become a household word in every hamlet Marcus A. Hanna.\n\nOn North Dawson Street, in the City of Thomasville, stands the historic winter home in which, according to every sign of the zodiac, were\n\n* Vol. I, \"Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1289\n\nlaid the plans, the outcome of which was Mr. Bryan's undoing. It seems a trifle singular that the state which put Mr. Bryan in nomination at Chicago, under circumstances, which no one can ever forget, should fur nish an asylum to1 his most inveterate enemies, wherein they might intrigue to compass his defeat. But while this little by-play of politics was in Georgia, it was not of Georgia. It came from a source entirely outside and remote. Mr. Hanna was a practical business man of large wealth whose business operations ramified the whole State of Ohio and brought him rich returns from commercial traffic on the Great Lakes. lie was also something of a slate-maker in Buckeye politics. For years Mr. Hanna had been an intimate personal friend to Major McKinley, a creditor, so it is said, for certain large sums of money, which the latter had borrowed from him, without compromise of honor; and it was due almost solely to the adroit manipulation of this masterful strategist that the nomination of Major McKinley then governor of Ohio was accom plished at St. Louis. The next move on the political chessboard was the reciprocal act of the nominee in choosing his campaign manager; and finally to end the game, there was to be a seat for Mr. Hanna in the President's cabinet; or, what he most desired the coveted toga. Worthy the brain of a Richelieu was this brilliant strategy of the Ohio coal baron.\n\nWithout going into details, it is the commonly accepted belief that the whole plan of campaign which resulted in putting Governor McKin ley into the White House was concocted in the Town of Thomasville, among the fragrant pines of the Georgia lowlands. During Mr. Hanna's occupancy of the North Dawson Street mansion, in the winter of 1895-96, Mr. McKinley was an honored guest of the Hannas; and thither also flocked other members of the Grand Old Party whose love for the game of politics was not only well-known but notorious. As pre-arranged, the nomination of Mr. McKinley took place in June and his election to the presidency followed in November. For a time the issue hung in sus pense. The Nebraskan's fiery eloquence threatened to upset the plans of Mr. Hanna. It was furthermore discovered, after the nomination was made, that it took place on the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, a coincidence which viewed in connection with the nominee's marked facial resemblance to Napoleon, caused some forebodings in the repub lican ranks. But if there was any virtue in the omen, it only served to bring him Wellington's luck. Mr. Hanna was the best advertised man in the country, while the campaign lasted, due chiefly to the famous cartoons of Homer Davenport, in which some of his physical peculiarities were most amusingly caricatured and he was made to vaunt himself in clothes bespangled with the omnipresent dollar-mark. Meeting the artist one day when the fight was over, Mr. Hanna said to him:\n\n'' Davenport, I admire your execution, but hang your conception.''\n\nIt was under the terms of a lease from the owners that Mr. Hanna occupied the North Dawson Street mansion during the winter which preceded Mr. McKinley's election. The house was leased in the follow ing year to Judge Lynde Harrison, one of the executors of H. B. Plant, the founder of the Plant system of railroads. Since then the historic place of abode has remained unoccupied. It is owned by the estate of the late John W. Masury, of New York, a formerly well-known manu-\n\n1290\n\nGEORGIA AND. GEORGIANS\n\nfacturer of paints. By reason of the fact that the building is supposed to have played a stellar part in the eventful campaign of 1896, it has become the most conspicuous land-mark in Thomasville : an object of very great interest of sight-seers and of no small local pride to the inhabitants of the town. Some of the statements herein made may be purely con jectural; but sifting the chaff from the wheat it still remains that Mr. I-Ianna leased the Thomasville home for the winter season preceding Mr. McKinley's nomination; that he here played the host not only to Mr. McKinley himself but to some of the big political king-bees of the repub lican party who came here to buzz; and that when the election was over he quietly stepped from a business office on the lake front, in the City of Cleveland, Ohio, to a seat of historic renown in the American House of Peers.*\n\nHow MR. BKYAN SECURED His NOMINATION IN 1896\n\nAs the result of a single speech delivered with marvelous oratorical effect, at an opportune moment, in the famous Chicago convention of 1896, William J. Bryan made himself the standard-bearer of the National Democracy in. three separate presidential campaigns, and shaped the history of the democratic party in the nation for more than a score of years. But it was due largely to the prompt initiative and to the bugletoned eloquence of a gifted Georgian that his.nomination for the high office of President, in 1896, became an accomplished fact. The distin guished member of the Georgia delegation who presented his name to the convention was the late Judge Henry T. Lewis, of Greensboro, afterwards elevated to a seat on the Supreme Court bench. Hon. Clark Howell, for years a member of the National Democratic Executive Committee, took a prominent part in the proceedings of this convention; and, in a racy article which he afterwards wrote for his great paper, he tells the story of Bryan's nomination. Says Mr. Howell:\n\n\"The Democratic convention of 1896 was fruitful of dramatic epi sodes. The second. Cleveland administration was drawing to a discredited close when the 1896 convention met. The opponents of Cleveland and the friends of free silver were in control. It was a crusading lot of Democrats who gathered in Chicago that year to nominate a President and to sail the Democratic ship into unknown seas.\n\n\"Several men were candidates for the nomination, among them 'Sil ver' Dick Bland and 'Horizontal Bill- Morrison. The man who secured the nomination had never been thought of in that connection, save by himself and one member of the Georgia delegation. The man who thought he would be nominated, and who was nominated, was, of course, William J. Bryan. The member of the Georgia delegation who had thought of Bryan in connection with the nomination was Hal Lewis, an ardent free silver man, as were all the members of the Georgia delegation, and he had been attracted by some speeches Bryan had made while in Congress.\n\n\"Bryan was not even a delegate when he reached Chicago. He came as a member of a contesting delegation. J. Sterling Mortem, who was in\n\n5 Vol. I, \"Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1291\n\nCleveland's Cabinet, controlled the machinery in Nebraska,'and he had sent an anti-silver delegation to Chicago. Bryan came with a delegation to fight the admission of the Morton faction. I was a member of the sub committee of the national committee which passed on this contest and reported in favor of Bryan and his friends, and they were seated. That' report gave Bryaii an opportunity to get into the convention and to make his 'Cross-of-Gold' speech, which made him the nominee. It is curious to speculate as to what would have been the history of Bryan and the Democratic party if our report had been in favor of the J. Ster ling Morton faction.\n\n\"Bryan, once seated in the convention, watched for his opportunity, and when it came unloosed that crown-of-thorns and cross-of-gold speech, which not only gave him the nomination for the Presidency, but shaped the course of the Democracy through many campaigns.\n\n\" Bryan's speech was a great oratorical effort, and it spell-bound the convention. Hal Lewis, of Georgia, however, was the man who turned that speech into practical benefit for Bryan. When the Georgia delega tion got together, after Bryan's speech, Lewis at once began to urge the Nebraskan as available for the nomination, and soon had the delegation agreeing with him. Bryan was seen, and it was agreed that his name should be presented by Lew;is.\n\n\"When Georgia was called, Lewis was carried to the platform on the shoulders of the Georgia delegation. Lewis was a remarkable man. He was a fine speaker, with a magnificent voice, but he spoke only on the rarest occasions. When he did speak, however, he was \"like a volcano in eruption, and he was certainly volcanic when he presented the name of Bryan to the convention. His speech was second only to the cross-of-gold effort of Bryan, and long before Lewis ceased to speak the nomination of Bryan was a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"The curious thing about the 1896 convention was that the result, so far as Bryan was concerned, was no surprise. Bryan came to the con vention believing he would be the nominee and had everything arranged to that end. Mr. Bryan himself is authority for this statement. I was very close to Mr. Bryan in those days, and remained close to him long afterwards. After the convention I had a conversation with Bryan in the old Clifton Hotel in Chicago, and I asked him if he were not surprised when the convention turned to him.\n\n\" 'Not a bit,' said Bryan. 'I came to Chicago expecting to capture the convention by a speech and be nominated. It has worked out just as I expected.'\n\n'' I then asked Bryan if the cross-of-gold speech was extemporaneous, resulting from the inspiration of the moment. Bryan greeted the ques tion with a hearty laugh.\n\n'' ' There was nothing extemporaneous about it,' he said. ' I prepared that speech weeks in advance; memorized it so I could repeat it backward or forward and declaimed it over and over again. Extemporaneous! No, indeed!' And Mr. Bryan continued to laugh. So you see the climax of the 1896 convention was as carefully rehearsed and staged as any pro duction ever presented by that master of stage-craft, David Belasco. By way of contrast, it is worth mentioning that Georgia, which did so much for Bryan in 1896 and 1900, had completely broken with him by 1908.\n\n1292\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nIn the latter year at the Denver convention, although Bryan controlled, he never received a vote from the Georgia delegation.'' *\n\nWOODROW WILSON: AN INCIDENT IN His CAREER AS A LAWYER\n\nWoodrow Wilson, the twenty-eighth President of the United States, began his career as a lawyer in Georgia's state capital. He was formally admitted to the bar in 1882; and his license to practice law in the courts of this state bears the signature of Hon. George Hillyer, judge of the Atlanta Circuit. Entering into a legal partnership with a brilliant young barrister like himself, Edward J. Renick, the professional shingle of the new firm was displayed from a modest office on the second floor of the old Hulsey Building, on the corner of Broad and Marietta streets. But there was no immediate rush of clients, and becoming discouraged as weeks lengthened into months without materially swelling the bank account of either, they decided to dissolve the partnership agreement and to set out in quest of new pastures.\n\nMr. Renick became in after years assistant secretary of state under President Cleveland. Still later he was made special representative of the great banking house of Coudert Brothers. He died in the City of Paris while on a very important mission concerning the Gould interests, and his death was deplored on both sides of tke water. Mr. Wilson went to Baltimore, to pursue a special course of study at Johns Hopkins. He was then called to an adjunct professorship of history at Bryn Mawr; thence in 1888 he went to Wesleyan University, at Middletown, Connecti cut, where he taught political science; and two years later accepted the chair of jurisprudence and politics at Princeton, relinquishing this chair in 1902, to become president of the institution. The policy of his admin istration was to make this great seat of learning a democracy. On account of a disagreement with his board of trustees touching a matter which he considered too vital to admit of compromise or surrender, he resigned the helm of affairs, only to be tendered the democratic nomina tion for governor of New Jersey.\n\nSince his entry into politics, the career of President AVilson has been an open book. The following incident of his sojourn in Atlanta is taken from the files of the Constitution, under date of November 6, 1912:\n\n'' Two years after his arrival here the tariff commission appointed by President Hayes to visit the various sections of the country and report of the tariffs workings came to Atlanta and sent out invitations asking any one interested to meet with them and point out unjust discriminations as they saw them. John W. H. Underwood was the Georgia member of the commission. When the board assembled in the convention hall of the Kimball House they were greeted by a single man, come to talk over the tariff. For two hours or more he fired question after question at the tariff experts, turned the 'evidence meeting' into a debate between him self, and the board and showed those gentlemen just what the situation was in the South, says Henry Peeples, one of Atlanta's best-known attor neys, in recalling the scene:\n\n\" 'What is your name?' asked the commission of the young man. \" ' I am Woodrow Wilson, a lawyer,' he answered.'' *\n\nJ Vol. II, '' Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,'' by L.

Knight.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1293\n\nHABRIET GOLD : A ROMANCE or NEW EGHOTA\n\nOn a knoll, overlooking the site of New Echota, there is still to be seen a lonely wayside grave around which cluster the incidents of a pathetic tale of the wilderness. When Elias Boudinot was attending the Moravian School, at Cornwall, Connecticut, he there met and loved Har riet Gold, At the expiration of two years they were married, much to the displeasure of her father and brother, who little relished the thought of her marriage to an Indian, even though of mixed breed. But she took this step with her mother's full consent. It was an affair of the heart, which a mother could well understand, despite the separation from home and the life of isolation among an alien people, which such a marriage necessarily involved. So the happy pair came to Georgia; and here, in the course of time, the bride's mother made them a visit and found her daughter well provided with domestic comforts and little .disposed to complain.\n\nAVith true missionary zeal, the young bride soon became intent .upon the task of bettering the conditions of life among the Indians. She founded, some time in the early thirties, the first Sunday school in Gordon County; and to her husband, who was editor of the Phoenix, she was both a companion and a helpmeet. She did much for the uplift of the tribe, and the life which she lived among them, though brief, was one of beautiful unselfishness. \"When John Howard Payne was impris oned in the block-house, she frequently went to see him, making his bonds less burdensome by her sympathetic attentions. The story goes that he taught her to sing his famous air of \"Home Sweet Home\"; and how ever reconciled she may have been to her lot by reason of the one thing needful to make it rosy, there were doubtless minor chords of love in her heart which sounded a sad response when her memory reverted to her old home in far-away Connecticut.\n\nBut satisfied though she was with the man of her choice, the days of her joyful wedlock were numbered. Stealthily the fingers of disease began to clutch at the vital cords. Perhaps she foresaw the bolt which was destined to descend upon the Cherokees. It was not difficult to read the future at this troublous hour. There was scarcely a moment when her husband's life was not. in danger. The nation was divided into rival camps. The anxieties incident to this vexed period may have been too severe for an organism attuned to gentler surroundings. At any rate she faded day by day; and one afternoon in midsummer they bore her to the hillside, where a slab of marble, yellow with age, still marks the spot. It requires no great stretch of the imagination to picture the broken hearted man who survived her, bending over the low mound, on the eve of his departure for the West, and reading, through tear-filled eyes, the following inscription: *\n\n\"To the memory of Harriet Ruggles, the wife of Thomas Elias Boudinot. She was the daughter of .Colonel Benjamin and Eleanor Gold, of Cornwall, Conn., where she was born June 1, 1805, and died at New Echota, Cherokee Nation, August 12, 1836.

Knight.\n\n1294\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n'' THERE 's MILLIONS IN IT !\"\n\nBefore the discovery of the rich gold fields of California, in 1849, Dahlonega, Georgia, was the chief center of gold mining activities in the United States; and hither flocked hundreds of argonauts in feverish quest of the yellow metal. According to the late Professor Yeates, who was at one time state geologist of -Georgia, an expression which Mark Twain has made classic in two hemispheres originated at Dahlonega. Says Professor Yeates:\n\n\"One of the most active and enthusiastic spirits of the flush times was Dr. M. F. Stevenson, an amateur geologist and mineralogist, who was full of the belief that Georgia was one of the richest mineral States in the Union. AVhen, in 1849, the miners around Dahlonega gathered to take action, on the project of deserting the mines in Georgia and going in a body to the new fields of California, this earnest believer in Geor gia's great mineral wealth mounted the court-house steps in Dahlonega, and, addressing a crowd of about 200 miners, plead with them not to be turned by the stories of the wondrous discoveries in California, but to stick to the Georgia fields, which were rich in possibilities. Pointing to Findley Ridge, which lay about half a mile to the south, he exclaimed: 'Why go to California? In that ridge lies more gold than man ever dreamt of. There's millions in it.' This last sentence was caught up by the miners and taken with them to California, where for years it was a by-word among them. It remained for Mark Twain, who heard it in common use, in one of the mining1 camps of California, to broadcast it over creation by placing it in the mouth of his world-renowned charac ter, Colonel Mulberry Sellers.\"*'\n\n\"HOME, SWEET HOME\": JOHN HOWARD PAYNE'S GEORGIA SWEETHEART AND IMPRISONMENT\n\nIt is one of the ironies of Fate that the poet from whose pen has come the best-known lyric of the hearthstone was himself a homeless wanderer. With little knowledge of domestic happiness, he sang of home, not as a possession, but as a want; and, for more than thirty years, he was even fated to fill an exile's grave, on the far shores of the Mediterranean. The absence of any strong domestic ties first led him, when a mere lad, to seek his fortune abroad. On returning to America, after a lapse of two full decades, his wandering footsteps at length brought him to Geor gia, where two experiences of a widely different character awaited him a jail and a sweetheart. From the former of these binding spells he was soon released, through the prompt intervention of an influential friend. But, in gentle bondage to the latter, he remained a lifelong prisoner. His heart underwent no change. As for the fair object of his affections, she retained her maiden name to the end of her days and, dying at the ripe age of seventy-six, carried to her grave in Oconee Cemetery, at Athens, an undimmed image of her poet-lover: the immortal author of \"Home, Sweet Home.\"\n\n'Vol. I, \"Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1295\n\nThe world has not forgotten the pathetic story of John Howard Payiie. But the tendency to exaggerate has led a host of writers, eager for dramatic effect, into gross misstatements. Indeed, there are few, who, in sketching Payne's life, have not drawn more largely upon fancy for materials than upon fact.\n\nPayiie was never at any time the shiftless, lie 'er-do-well, or the penni less vagabond which he has often been made to appear by these carica ture artists. Most of his life, it is true, was spent in bachelor quarters and among remote scenes. He also lacked business acumen; but those upon whom Nature bestows the divine afflatus are seldom merchants or bankers. AVith the conveniences of an assured income, he was unac quainted ; and the caprices of Fortune often entailed upon him financial embarrassment. On more than one occasion he knew what it was to be without a dollar in his pocket when creditors were clamorous. But he earned a fair livelihood. At times his wares brought him a substantial recompense and, while his money lasted, he was a prince of bohemians. During the last years of his life, he held an important consular position at Tunis, in Morocco.\n\nBorn in the City of New York, on June 9, 1792, the early boyhood days of John Howard Payne were spent at East Hampton, on Long Island, where the old family homestead, a quaint two-story structure, with an attic built of cedar shingles, is owned and preserved as a literary Mecca, by Mr. Buek, of Brooklin, a wealthy admirer of the poet. In summer the cottage is charmingly covered with wistaria vines, contrast ing with the silvery tones of color which nearness to the sea invariably , gives. Stretching away to the rear of the house is an old apple orchard, while in the distance can be seen the sand dunes of the North Atlantic. The interior paneling of the house is said to have been the work of a ship carpenter, trained in one of the navy yards of England. The build ing is heated by a huge central chimney, twelve feet in diameter, in which is built a fireplace after the ample pattern of the Dutch. The house is furnished exactly as it was in the days of Payne's childhood, with quaint dressing tables, high bedsteads, old Windsor chairs, and other furnishings reminiscent of the Colonial period. It was doubtless a recollection of this early home beside the sea which, in after years, inspired his deathless anthem.\n\nBut to go back. At the age of thirteen, when a clerk in a mercantile establishment in New York, Payne began secretly to edit a weekly news paper, devoted to the drama. Such precocity of genius induced the lad's father to plan for him a good education; but, while a student at Union College, his prospects were suddenly disturbed by the elder Payne's fail ure in business. John Howard then decided to go upon the stage. His debut as an actor was made at the Park Theater in New York, on Feb ruary 24, 1809, as Young Norval in the \"Douglass;\" and the suc cess of his initial performance, both from a pecuniary and from an artistic standpoint, was such that he afterwards toured the New England\n\nand Middle states.\n\nIn 1813 he sailed for England; and from this time dates his pro-\n\n1296\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\ntracted sojourn abroad. As an actor he was well received by the public; but, anxious to increase his earnings, he essayed theatrical management,\n\nwith disastrous results. Due to his lack of business ability, he found himself frequently in financial straits. Fortune did not seem to favor\n\nhim. In 1815 he published a volume of verse entitled \"Lispings of the\n\nMuse,\" from which his returns were only meager. Better success\n\nattended him as a playwright. He produced a number of musical dramas, for one of which, an opera, entitled \"Clari, or the Maid of Milan,\" he\n\ncomposed the world-renowned stanzas of \"Home, Sweet Home.\" This opera was first produced at Covent Garden Theater, in May,\n\n1823. The music was adapted by Henry R. Bishop, from an old melody which caught Payne's fancy while visiting one of the Italian cities. It is said that the song itself came to him when, oppressed by debt, he\n\nwandered one day, in great heaviness of spirit, along the banks of the Thames River. During the first year it netted his publishers over two thousand guineas. Payne himself derived little pecuniary profit from\n\nthe song which was destined to make him immortal, but he lived to see it put a girdle of music around the globe, to charm alike the king and the peasant, and to become in literal truth the song of the millions.\n\nThe original draft of '' Home, Sweet Home'' ran as follows:\n\n'Mid pleasures and palaces, though we may roam, Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home; A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,\n\nLike the love of a mother Surpassing all other, Which, seek through the world, is ne 'er met with elsewhere. There's a spell in the shade Where our infancy played, Even stronger than time and more deep than despair.\n\nAn exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain, 0, give me my lowly thatched cottage again! The birds and the lambkins that came at my call\n\nThose who named me with pride Those who played at my side-^Give me them, with the innocence dearer than all. The joys .of the palaces through which I roam Only swell my heart's anguish there's no place like home.\n\nLater Payne re-wrote the poem. But in order to secure brevity he sacrificed poetic charm. The lines with which the public are today familiar hardly measure up to the original; but they are doubtless better adapted to the air. Here is the poem as re-written:\n\n'Mid pleasures and palaces, though we may roam, Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home. A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there, Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.\n\nHome, home, sweet, sweet home! There's no place like home! There's no place like home!\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1297\n\nAn exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain, 0, give me my lowly thatched cottage again! The birds singing gaily that came at my call Give me them and the peace of mind dearer than all.\n\nHome, home, sweet, sweet home ! There's no place like home! There's no place like home!\n\nIn 1832 Payne returned to New York. The question agitating the public mind at this time was the removal of the Cherokee Indians to a traus-Mississippi region. To one of Payne's fine poetic temperament, the idea of using force to drive these primitive inhabitants of the soil these native Americans into an unwilling exile was most repugnant. He thought of himself as an outcast and a wanderer; and it was only natural for the man who wrote \"Home, Sweet Home\" to espouse the cause of those who were soon to be homeless, even though they were savage tribes of the forest.\n\nTo ascertain the real facts in regard to the Cherokees, Mr. Payne came to Georgia in 1836, on the eve of the famous deportation. It so happened that, at this time, Georgia was in a turmoil of excitement. Events were rapidly approaching a climax; and in order to deal, on the one hand, witli meddlesome interlopers whose purpose was to inflame the red men, and, on the other, with lawless characters escaping across the state line into Indian Territory, it was necessary for Georgia to extend her jurisdiction, with a rod of iron, over the domain of the Cherokees.\n\nThere was, at this time, among the Indians two distinct parties, one of which, under Major Ridge, strongly favored removal as the wisest course for the nation to adopt. The other, headed by John Ross, stren uously opposed removal; and these were regarded as the sworn enemies of the state. Between the two factions there was war to the knife, deadly and bitter. When John Howard Payne came to Georgia, he visited the Cherokee nation as the guest of John Ross, then, as afterwards, the prin cipal chief. His object in making this visit was unknown to the civil authorities; but his affiliation with John Ross put him at once under suspicion. He contemplated nothing sinister. His purpose was merely to gather information. But Tray was in bad company, at least, to Georgia's way of thinking, and, while visiting John Ross, he was put under arrest and imprisoned in the old Vann house, at Spring Place, in what is now Murray County, Georgia. Capt. A. B. Bishop, who com manded the Georgia Guards, at this place, made the arrest. He found the poet at Ross' hom^ near the head of the Coosa River.\n\nIt is said that while imprisoned at Spring Place he heard the soldiers singing his familiar anthem, \"Home, Sweet Home,\"\"and that, when he eventually satisfied his captors that he was the author of this renowned song, he received from them the most considerate treatment. Neverthe less, he was held a prisoner until his release was finally procured by Gen. Edward Harden, of Athens, to whom he had brought a letter of intro duction. The historic site of the poet's imprisonment at Spring Place is soon to be marked by the John Milledge Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\n1298\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nAs stated, Mr. Payne, on coming to Georgia, brought with him a letter of introduction to an old citizen of Athens, Gen. Edward Harden. The latter was formerly a resident of Savannah, and during the famous visit of LaFayette to this country, in 1825, he entertained the illustrious nobleman of France. General Harden was typically a gentleman of the old school, courtly in his manners, refined and cultured, in fact, a man of letters, though his chosen profession was the law. Payne expected to stop at the public inn; but to this General Harden demurred, insisting that he become his guest for an indefinite stay.\n\nThus it was that the author of '' Home, Sweet Home'' found himself an inmate of the famous old Harden home in Athens. The story that Payne caught the inspiration for his poem, at this time is, of course, sheerest fiction, for more than twelve years had elapsed since the first rendition of the song in public. Equally imaginative is the yarn that on entering the door of his prison at Spring Place, he raised both hands in anguish above his head, exclaiming with bitter sarcasm, \"Home, Sweet Home,\" and then proceeded to write the poem, in a moment of silent\n\ncommunion with the Muses. But while Payne did not write his poem in Georgia, he enjoyed the\n\nhospitality which General Harden lavished without stint upon friend and stranger alike; and there came into his life at this time an influence which, for the rest of his days, was destined to cast upon him the spell of a most subtle enchantment. He became acquainted with the general's lovely daughter, Mary. So fascinated was the poet with this gentle lady of Athens that the main purpose of his visit to Georgia was almost for gotten. The poor Cherokees became a secondary consideration. Even his Yankee scruples against southern biscuit were overcome when he tasted one of the dainty products of Miss Mary's oven.\n\nStill, he did visit the Cherokee nation; and it was while on this trip that his imprisonment at Spring Place occurred. On hearing of his predicament, General Harden hastened to his release. But the poet was so mortified over the treatment to which he had been subjected that he lost no time in returning to the North, avowing his purpose never again to visit Georgia, without a formal invitation. To this resolution he adhered. However, there were some memories connected with his visit which he did not care to forget and which, through the lonely days and nights succeeding his return to New York, continued softly to serenade him, to the music of his own '' Home, Sweet Home.''\n\nBetween Miss Harden and Payne there doubtless passed a number of letters. But one in particular deserves our attention. In a wild flutter of hope, he wrote to her, on July 18, 1836, telling her that he could offer her naught save his hand and heart and entreating her to smile upon his suit. What her answer to this proposal of marriage was, no one knows. She was always silent upon the subject; but the fact remains that they were never married, though each remained loyal till death. Perhaps the old general himself barred the way. He knew that Payne was a rolling stone; and while he admired the poet's genius he may\n\nhave doubted his ability to support a helpmeet.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1299\n\nIn after years, Payne was sent with a consular appointment to Mo rocco, by the United States Government. On the eve of his' departure Miss Harden requested of him an autographed copy of his renowned song, a boon which he promptly granted. In some mysterious manner this copy disappeared at the time of Miss Harden's death, giving rise to the not unnatural presumption that it was buried with her; but her niece, Miss Mary Jackson, to whom the old Harden home in Athens was willed and who assisted in preparing the body of her beloved aunt for burial, states that, for this supposition there is no ground whatever. It is not unlikely that Miss Harden herself, when warned of approaching death, destroyed with her own hands what was never meant for the eyes of the idly curious.\n\nPayne, after leaving for Morocco, returned to America but once in life. On this occasion he received a wonderful tribute from the famous Jennie Lind, who, turning toward the box in which he sat, in a crowded theater, sang in the richest accents which have doubtless ever been heard on this continent, the familiar words of his inspired song. The great Daniel Webster was a witness to this impressive scene, the memory of which he carried to his grave at Marshfield.\n\nSoon after returning to Morocco, Payne died, on April 9, 1852, at the age of threescore years. He was buried at Tunis, where his body rested for more than three full decades, in a foreign exile, on the shores of North Africa. But finally, in 1883, through the efforts of the great philanthropist, Mr. W. W. Corcoran, of Washington, D. C., the ashes of the poet were brought back to his native land and reinterred in Oak Hill Cemetery, on the outskirts of the nation's capital. Here, underneath the same ground slab which marked his grave in Tunis, sleeps the gentle poet of the hearthstone. But overlooking the sacred spot there stands a more recent structure of pure white marble, reared by thousands of voluntary contributions. It is surmounted by a life-size bust of the lamented bard and lettered underneath it is the following epitaph: *\n\nJOHN HOWARD PAYNE\n\nAuthor of \"Home, Sweet Home.\"\n\nBorn, June 9, 1792.\n\nDied, April 9, 1852.\n\nSure, when thy gentle spirit fled To realms above the dome,\n\nWith outstretched arms God's angels said: \"Welcome to Heaven's home, sweet home.\"\n\nME. CRAWFORD AT THE COURT OF NAPOLEON\n\nShortly before the drooping banners of the Old Guard had com menced to trail vvpon the field of. Waterloo, there appeared at the Court of France an arrival of unusual dignity of bearing whose whole aspect\n\n* Vol. IT, \"Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends,\" by L. L. Knight.\n\n1300\n\nGEOKGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nseemed to suggest that a new emperor had come to Paris. It was evident from the most casual glance that the handsome stranger was no ordinary individual. He clearly bore the majestic stamp; but, coming unheralded and unescorted, he was probably of lesser rank, perhaps some earl or duke, with family connections on the throne. However, an examination of his official papers dispelled the imperial illusion by making it apparent .that he boasted neither rank nor title, for he hailed from the lower edge of the Cherokee belt and was none other,.than the American ambassador, William H. Crawford, of Georgia.\n\nGigantic in stature, Mr. Crawford stood considerably over six feet tall, but was well proportioned and delicately featured. His ruddy com plexion told that he had never known an hour's illness. His broad shoul ders, Atlas-like in strength, were surmounted by an immense leonine head such as Phidias might have carved for Jupiter; while, underneath an expansive brow of tinted marble, darted the quick glances of an eagle which seemed to be looking from some mountain eyrie. Before the eyes of one who saw him for the first time, there immediately shot up the figure of the pine, but his courtly bearing and his native ease of manner suggested, on more intimate acquaintance, the richer sheen of the mag nolia or the softer velvet of the cedar.\n\nAccompanying Mr. Crawford to France, as secretary of legation, went Dr. Henry Jackson, an accomplished young educator, who had recently, been called to the faculty of Franklin College. Doctor Jackson was a, younger brother of the famous Gov. James Jackson, who fought the Yazoo Fraud, and was the father of Gen. Henry E. Jackson, who wrote \"The Eed Old Hills of Georgia.\" As the result of a deep personal inter est, Mr. Crawford had invited Doctor Jackson to accompany him abroad, and the board of trustees granted the young professor a special leave of absence for the purpose of making this trip.\n\nMr. Crawford remained abroad some two years; and, if not in France at the time of the battle of Waterloo, he at least appears to have wit nessed the return of Napoleon from Elba. The period was most eventful; but, even amid the waning fortunes of the empire, the Court of France was surpassingly brilliant. It was on this occasion that Mr. Crawford received from the emperor an involuntary tribute the like of which he is said to have paid to no other mortal man. Doctor Jackson has happily preserved the incident. He says that when the superb figure of the American ambassador was arrayed for the first time in the gorgeous apparel of the French court, he riveted upon himself the astonished gaze of everyone present.\n\nStruck by Mr. Crawford's distinguished appearance, the bewildered Napoleon instinctively bowed his imperial forehead twice; and in speak ing of the affair afterwards he frankly confessed that Mr. Crawford was the only man to whom he ever felt actually constrained to bow. This story is well attested. An examination of the old newspaper files will serve to unearth many a racy incident of like character, but none perhaps more striking than this episode of .the French court in which William II. Crawford, by wresting tribute honors from the conqueror of Europe, forestalled the triumph of the Duke of Wellington.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1301\n\n.How MB. CBAWFOBD MISSED THE PBESIDENCY\n\nOn Mr. Crawford's return from France in 1815 he accepted from President Madison the portfolio of war in the cabinet of President Madison, but he was afterwards transferred to the Treasury Depart ment. He discharged the duties of this position so ably that he was retained under President Monroe; but pending the campaign which ushered the new chief executive into the \"White House, it became evi dent that Mr. Crawford himself was no mean favorite for the nomina tion. On counting the votes cast in the convention, it was found that, out of a total of 119 votes, 54 were cast for Mr. Crawford.\n\nNor did his popularity wane. In 1824 he received the endorsement of his party over Mr. Calhoun, and entered the race under the most nat tering prospects of success; but just before the election, by the most untoward caprice of fate, Mr. Crawford was stricken with paralysis. Though defeated, the contest was so close that, like the famous BurrJefferson fight of 1801, it was thrown into the national House of Repre sentatives. The candidates were William H. Crawford, Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Mr. Adams was finally elected, due, it is said, to the agency of Mr. Clay, who gave his support to the New Englander.\n\nGovernor Gilmer states that the attack of paralysis was superinduced by an improper use of lobelia, administered by an inexperienced phy sician, to relieve an attack of erysipelas. But the malady did not entirely check Mr. Crawford's usefulness. He became judge of the northern circuit of Georgia, a position which he held from 1827 to 1834. Even amid the wreck of his brilliant powers he seems to have retained, in a very marked degree, his wonderful memory. He never lost his love for the old Latin and Greek authors, but still read Homer and Virgil, Cicero and Xenophon, fluently in the originals, and could no doubt have dis tanced many of the college professors. Moreover, he was a perfect encyclopedia of general knowledge, an index rerum of his generation.\n\nBut it was always a pathetic spectacle to see the palsied figure of the old giant as he ambled toward the bench or stammered out the words which once leaped to his lips with such charm of music and such felicity of phrase. Feeble glints of the old fire still gleamed in his eyes, and dim traces of the old Apollo were still visible in his emaciated form, but it was difficult to realize that this infirm old jurist was the great William H. Crawford, of Georgia, for whom the presidential chair of the nation was not considered too high an honor, and to whom even the great Napoleon had twice bent the crown of France.*\n\nANECDOTE OP MB. CBAWFOBD'S SCHOOL-DAYS\n\nJoseph Beckham Cobb narrates the following incident of Mr. Craw ford's school-days at Mount Carmel:\n\n'' It was determined by himself and some of the elder school boys to enliven the annual public examinations by representing a play. They selected Addison's Cato; and, in forming the cast of characters, that of\n\n*Vol. I, \"Reminiscences of Famous Georgians,' by L. L. Knight.\n\nVol. Ill--3\n\n1302\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nthe Roman senator was of course, assigned to the usher. Crawford was a man of extraordinary height and large limbs, and was always ungrace ful-and awkward, besides being constitutionally unfitted, in every way, to act any character but his own. However, he cheerfully consented to play Cato. It was a matter of great sport, even during rehearsal as his companions beheld the huge, unsightly usher, with giant strides and sten torian tones, go through with the representation of the stern, precise old Roman. But, on the night of the exhibition, an accident, eminently characteristic of the counterfeit Cato, occurred, which effectually broke up the denoument of the tragedy. Crawford had conducted the Senate scene with tolerable success, though rather boisterously for so solemn an occasion, and had even managed to struggle through with the apostrophe to the soul; but, when the dying scene behind the curtain came to be acted, Cato's groan of agony was bellowed out with such hearty good earnest as totally to scare away the tragic muse, and set prompter, play ers and audience in a general, unrestrained fit of laughter. This was, we believe, the future stateman's first and last theatrical attempt.\" *\n\nOLD JUDGE DOOLY, OP LINCOLN\n\nOver in what Judge Longstreet calls \"the dark corner of Lincoln,\" there lived during the early part of the last century, an eccentric old judge of the western circuit by the name of Judge John M. Dooly. His wit was proverbial. Perhaps there never sat on the bench in Georgia a man whose faults were more pronounced; and, strange to say, he made no effort to conceal them. He could play a better game of poker and drink a stouter glass of ale than almost any one of the hardened offenders who quailed under his sentences; and he even made his accom plishments in this respect a matter of jest. But in spite of his failings he possessed many sturdy and robust characteristics; and, whatever else may be said of him, he was certainly not a hypocrite. He was unfail ingly generous and kind-hearted, and ofttimes the sympathetic tear is said to have lurked behind the judicial frown.\n\nHowever, his saving grace was his unrivaled wit. This invested him with an outward glamour which made even his faults, in the eyes of the masses, seem virtuous and heroic; and usually the courtroom was crowded with spectators who were less eager to hear the eloquent pleas of counsel than to catch the luminous sparks which fell from the judge's anvil. Lawyers seldom twitted or provoked him, dreading the effect upon the jury-box; but the ordinary proceedings gave him frequent occasions for droll comment. Judge Dooly was notably opposed to shed ding blood; albeit he came of fighting stock. His father, Col. John Dooly, was killed by the Tories in an unexpected assault upon his home at the outbreak of the Revolution; and his uncle, Capt. Thomas Dooly, suffered death in like manner at the hands of the Indians several years previous. But the judge himself possessed little of the martial instinct. He detected no music in the roar of musketry; he snuffed no perfume in the smell of gunpowder. He was pronouncedly a man of peace; and, if tradition can be trusted, he even carried his preference for the olive-\n\n* Joseph Beckham Cobb in '' Leisure Hours.''\n\nGEOBGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n1303\n\nbranch so far that when someone ventured to call him a liar he accepted the epithet as gracefully as if the offender had tendered him the instru ment which Apollo gave to Orpheus.\n\nHappily for Judge Dooly, his genial humor has served to keep him in green remembrance. Indeed, his name leaps glibly to our lips, when we find it difficult to recall many of his contemporaries who were dis tinguished for much greater achievements; and it all goes to show that for preserving purposes at least the salt of Attica is better than the spice of Sparta. In politics, Judge Dooly was a federalist. This accounts in some measure for the fact that he rose no higher than a circuit judgeship. Election day almost invariably found him short at the polls. But he scored heavily on his opponent while the campaign was in progress; and kept the countryside in a good humor. Pie was a musketeer and a swordsman both in the use of the King's English; and few and far be tween were the politicians who had the temerity in joint debate with this dreaded Ajax to hazard the fire of his deadly batteries or to challenge the flash of his Damascus blade. Concerning Judge Dooly's peculiar whimsicalities there are still enough legends afloat in Georgia to fill an ordinary octavo volume of anecdotes. Most of them are spurious, but enough are genuine and well authenticated to establish the primacy which he enjoyed among the great jurists of his day for pure and un adulterated wit. If Dickens could only have met this unique character, he might have improved upon the drolleries of Pickwick.*\n\nJUDGE DOODY'S BEE-GUM\n\nOn a certain occasion, when the famous feud between Clark and Crawford was at its height, Judge Dooly became involved in a contro versy with his predecessor upon the bench: Judge Charles Tait. As a result Judge Tait challenged him to mortal combat. There are several versions to this story, but, according to one of them, Judge Dooly ac cepted the challenge and actually appeared upon the scene of encounter, though he was notoriously opposed to shedding blood, especially from his own veins.\n\nGeneral Clark was Judge Dooly's second, while Mr. Crawford, in a like capacity, served Judge Tait; and the affair was probably planned with the utmost seriousness by the friends of both parties. Now, it happened that one of Judge Tait's bodily infirmities was a wooden leg, and it was a knowledge of this fact which inspired Judge Dooly's singular feat of valor. At the appointed time, Judge Tait, with his second, Mr. Crawford, appeared upon the scene of action, where he discovered Judge Dooly sitting patiently alone upon a stump. In reply to an inquiry from Mr. Crawford, concerning the whereabouts of General Clark, with whom he wished to confer in advance of the duel, Judge Dooly replied:\n\n'' General Clark is in the woods looking for a bee-gum.'' \"May I inquire,\" asked Mr. Crawford, \"what use he intends to make of a bee-gum?\" ''I want to put my leg in it,'' replied Judge Dooly. \"Do you suppose for a minute that I am going to risk a good leg of flesh and blood against\n\n* Vol. I, '' Reminiscences of Famous Georgians,\" by L.

If I hit his leg, he can get him another one before tomorrow morning; but if he hits mine I may lose my life, certainly my leg; and to put myself on equal footing with Tait, I must have a beegum for protection. I can then fight him on equal terms.''\n\n\"Then am I to understand that you do not intend to fight Judge Tait?\" inquired Mr. Crawford.\n\n\"Well,\" responded Judge Dooly, \"I thought every one knew that.\" \"Perhaps so,\" replied Mr. Crawford, \"but you will fill a newspaper column in consequence of this day's business.\" \"So be it,\" replied the judge, with an arch smile, \"I would rather fill a dozen newspapers than one "
