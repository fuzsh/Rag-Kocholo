        "text": "At 10:00AM on Thursday May 25th, there is a Revolutionary War Patriots of the Northwest Territory Memorial Service.\n\nThis will be hosted by the Marietta Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution.\n\nThe location will be in Marietta Ohio at the Mound Cemetery at the intersection of Fifth and Scammel Streets.\n\nGPS Coordinates: 39.419886, -81.452796\n\nThere will be updates on the Eagle Scout project and presentation on the “Boston Massacre and other Pre-Revolutionary Activities”.\n\nThere will be a memorial service, including wreath presentations and a musket salute by Color Guard participants.\n\nFollowing the formal service, there will be a tour of the Mound Cemetery and a lunch to follow at St. Paul’s Evangelical Church (across from the cemetery).\n\nColor Guard participates are requested to muster at 9:30AM at Mound Cemetery.\n\nAll SAR, DAR, CAR, Scouts, their families and public are invited and encouraged to attend.\n\nSee the attached flyer for more complete information and contact info:\n\n2023-RWP_NWT-Event-Flyer\n\nBelow is information on Mound Cemetery as provided by Wikopedia:\n\nMound Cemetery in Marietta, Ohio, is a historic cemetery developed around the base of a prehistoric Adena burial mound known as the Great Mound or Conus. The city founders preserved the Great Mound from destruction by establishing the city cemetery around it in 1801.\n\nThe city of Marietta was developed in 1788 by pioneers from Massachusetts, soon after the American Revolutionary War and organization of the Northwest Territory. Many of the founders were officers of the Revolutionary War who had received federal land grants for military services. Among high-ranking officers buried at the cemetery are generals Rufus Putnam and Benjamin Tupper, who were founders of the Ohio Company of Associates; as well as Commodore Abraham Whipple and Colonel William Stacy. The cemetery has the highest number of burials of American Revolutionary War officers in the country.[2][3]\n\nGreat Mound or Conus\n\nMain article: Marietta Earthworks\n\nThe conical Great Mound at Mound Cemetery is part of an Ohio Hopewell culture mound complex known as the Marietta Earthworks. Archaeologists estimate that it was built between 100 BC and 500 AD. Early European American settlers gave the structures Latin names. The complex includes the Sacra Via (meaning “sacred way”), three walled enclosures, the Quadranaou, Capitolium (meaning “capital”) and at least two other additional platform mounds, and the Conus burial mound and its accompanying ditch and embankment. The complex was surveyed and drawn in 1838 by Samuel R. Curtis (at the time a civil engineer for the state of Ohio). This survey was incorrectly attributed to Charles Whittlesey by E. G. Squier and E.H. Davis in their Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1848.[4] At the time the complex “included a large square enclosure surrounding four flat-topped pyramidal mounds, another smaller square, and a circular enclosure with a large burial mound at its center.”[5]\n\nThe Conus mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1973 as the Mound Cemetery Mound, site listing number 73001549.[1] In 1990 archaeologists from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History excavated a section of the Capitolium mound and determined that the mound was definitely constructed by peoples of the Hopewell Culture.[6]\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War soldiers\n\nThe city of Marietta was developed in 1788 by migrant pioneers from Massachusetts, soon after the American Revolutionary War and organization of the Northwest Territory. The cemetery has the highest number of burials of American Revolutionary War officers in the country.[3][7] The original pioneers, city founders from the Ohio Company of Associates, preserved the Great Mound from destruction by establishing the city cemetery around it.\n\nMany of the founders were officers of the Revolutionary War who had received federal land grants for military services. Among high-ranking officers buried at the cemetery are generals Rufus Putnam and Benjamin Tupper, who were founders of the Ohio Company of Associates; as well as Commodore Abraham Whipple and Colonel William Stacy.\n\nIt was stated at the Conference that “more officers of the Revolution are buried in the Old Mound Cemetery, Marietta, than at any other place in the United States.”\n\n— DAR, American Monthly, Vol. 16 (Jan–Jun 1900), 329.\n\nIn 1825, General Lafayette of France, who fought with the Americans during the Revolution, visited Marietta. He said of the city’s veterans: “I knew them well. I saw them fighting the battles of their country … They were the bravest of the brave. Better men never lived.”[8]\n\nThe Washington County Historical Society compiled the a list of Revolutionary soldiers buried in Mound Cemetery, notable persons in that list shown below:[9]\n\nCol. Robert Taylor, first burial in the cemetery\n\nGen. Rufus Putnam\n\nGriffin Greene, Sr., Quartermaster\n\nCommodore Abraham Whipple\n\nCol. Ebenezer Sproat\n\nCol. William Stacy, Sr.\n\nGen. Benjamin Tupper\n\nMaj. Anselm Tupper\n\nCapt. Nathaniel Saltonstall\n\nSamuel Hildreth, Sr. (father of Samuel Prescott Hildreth, also buried here)\n\nThe books of Samuel Prescott Hildreth (1783–1863), buried here, provide insight into the early history of Marietta and the Northwest Territory, and the lives of the soldiers and early pioneer settlers.[10][11]\n\nMajor General James Mitchell Varnum (1748–1789) was originally buried in the Mound Cemetery. His remains were later moved to Oak Grove Cemetery in Marietta."
