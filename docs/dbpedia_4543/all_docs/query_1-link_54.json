        "text": "It’s hard to believe in just over a month my oldest son will graduate from The Citadel. The time, for me at least, has flown by. Looking through photos from his college career, I’m forced to believe the time really has gone by.\n\nOur daughter, Chelle, is the measuring stick. She was a little girl in 3rd grade when Nelson started his knob year (freshman). She is now a young lady in 6th grade and about 12 inches taller. The photos tell the story best. During the 2007-08 school year she always brought a treasured stuffed animal on our visits to The Citadel. Now she brings a book.\n\nMy oldest son and my youngest child have shared a very special bond since she was a baby and he was the protective 10-year-old brother. For a recent language arts assignment, Chelle was asked to write about the person she admires most and use the lyrics for a song. She wrote about her oldest brother and composed a song for him since she couldn’t find one to sum up her admiration. As she sang it for me this morning, a tear came to her eye. I had a lump in my throat as well.\n\nLast night, I attended a production of Theater of War presented at Emory University. The production is making it’s way around the country. Through the ancient readings of Sophocles’ Ajax and Philoctetes the audience hears how the warrior and his/her family can be affected by war both physically and psychologically. The production is supported by a grant from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and the USO.\n\nListening to my daughter sing of her admiration for her brother this morning after attending the performance of Theater of War last night it struck me that we stand in a long line of military families. For thousands of years, families have sent their loved ones of to do battle, never sure if they will see their son or daughter again. We will enter that ancient tradition once our oldest goes through his officer training.\n\nMy 12-year-old daughter tears up during prayer time in her youth group at church just thinking about her older brother joining the Army. I listen to the stories of my fellow Citadel Ya Ya’s as they tell of the jumping in happy anticipation every time the phone rings in the hope that it is their child calling from over seas.\n\nFor the past 10 years I have studied traumatic stress and it’s affect on people exposed to trauma. My last year at Columbia Theological Seminary, I developed a model of chaplaincy for journalists of all faiths or none at all who cover traumatic events. This work has offered me the opportunity to meet leaders in the field of traumatic stress studies like Dr. Frank Ochberg, Dr. Jonathan Shay, and Dr. Steven Southwick, as well as individuals who have a traumatic stress diagnosis. During this time, I have had the honor and privilege to have attended conferences hosted by the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies and the Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy.\n\nI now serve on the board of the nonprofit, Care For The Troops, an organization that teaches civilian therapists about military culture so we will all be more sensitive to the needs of members of the military and their families.\n\nMy studies in the area of traumatic stress began years before my son decided the military is the career for him. I’ve lectured to faith-based communities and journalism programs about traumatic stress. I have come to realize that sometimes as a mom, you can know too much.\n\nMy son has received an excellent education and training at The Citadel and in the Army ROTC program there. I know he is as prepared as anyone can be to enter the U.S. Army. I also know it will still be tough.\n\nGraduation is a month away. My son will report for officer training June 8. After that who knows.\n\nI do know I can draw on the strength of my friends and fellow military moms to get us through, just as generations of families before us have done.\n\nPrevious entries by Dorie Griggs:\n\nThe Making of a Military Mom\n\nMom Readies for Son’s Military College\n\nThe Citadel: Year One a No Fly Zone for Hovering Parents\n\nHow The Citadel “Ya-Yas” Came to Be\n\nLearning Leadership and Ethics at The Citadel\n\nThe Citadel Trained Me as Well as My Son\n\nThe Citadel: BVA’s and Summerall Guards\n\nThe Citadel: Recognition Day and Ring Weekend\n\nCare Packages for Cadets: The Citadel Heroes Project\n\nThe Citadel Bond Renews Parents’ Long Time Friendships\n\nThe Citadel: Unofficial Tips for Families of Incoming Knobs\n\nThe Citadel: Saying Good-Bye, But Always Connected\n\nFiled under: Air Force, Coast Guard, Deployment, Education, Health - Physical and Mental, Marines, Military families, National Guard, Navy, PTSD, U.S. Army | Tagged: Army ROTC, Cadet, Dorie Griggs, Emory University, Facebook, International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, military families, Palmetto Battalion, postaday2011, Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Polidy, The Citadel The Military College of South Carolina, The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, Theater of War, United States Air Force, United States armed forces, United States Army | 6 Comments »\n\nAs we get closer to my son’s graduation in May, I’ve been reflecting on all the things I’ve learned about The Citadel and being a supportive parent to a cadet in this leadership school. I thought I’d share a few of my insights in the hope that a parent just starting their journey will find these insights helpful.\n\nIf you don’t have a Facebook page, get one. Once you are set up, join the group for your cadets battalion. You can find it by searching “Citadel (enter 1st – 5th) Battalion Parents Group.” Also, join the page for “The Citadel External Affairs” for regular campus updates and photos.\n\nThe best gift you can give your cadet is to learn as much as you can about the school and the process so you can be an encouraging presence to them. Reading the various sections of the school website is a great start.\n\nRemember, once they are on campus as a first year cadet, or knob, they are not in control of their time. YOU have to defer to THEIR instructions about when and where to meet and what they want to do.\n\nThe best gift you can give your cadet before they report is to help them purchase all the items they will need as listed in the Success Packet and Nice to Have lists. The lists are updated each year around May/June. Make sure you have the most up-to-date information. Differ to your cadet on what items they want on the “Nice to Have” list. This may be the hardest lesson for the parents. You must begin to allow your child to make their own decisions.\n\nEncourage your cadet to be fully prepared to report by doing physical training daily before Matriculation Day. If they can meet or exceed the physical training requirements prior to Matriculation Day, they will be better off. Each year they post a Physical Fitness Information packet. Read it thoroughly.\n\nRead the Parent Tips for unofficial advice on preparing to report to Matriculation Day.\n\nMake sure the black leather oxfords, military boots, and athletic shoes are fully broken in prior to Matriculation Day.\n\nBuy thick white socks and black socks. Don’t spend much on the sheets for their bed.\n\nYou do not have to mark their clothes/belongings before they arrive. They will learn the system to mark their things after they report.\n\nThe best way to learn about the school is read through the website. If you ever have a question about he school and the process, you can always contact the Ombudsperson’s office for a confidential conversation. The Cadet Activities office is very helpful for information about special weekends.\n\nDo not send large boxes of goodies. You can order free boxes from usps.gov – #01096L will fit into their mail box and is the size of a book when they put it in their “Knobbie bag,” a brief case like book bag.\n\nThe A-Z search and the Search window on the main website are terrific tools.\n\nBecome familiar with ALL the information on the Office of the Commandant website page. The yearly planning calendar, training schedules, regulations, and a flow chart of the promotions process can be found here.\n\nThe big weekends for visits during the year are Parents Weekend, Homecoming, Corps Day Weekend and Graduation Weekend. You can learn about the history of each on the web site. Learn the traditions of the school: Alma Mater, Cadet Prayer, Citadel Code, Knob Knowledge, The Ring.\n\nDo not listen to rumors and hearsay. If your cadet does not have first hand knowledge of a situation, do not become worried about a story. If at any time you are concerned about a story, call the Ombudsperson’s office for clarification.\n\nLearn how to read the training schedule and you won’t need to ask as many scheduling questions.\n\nHave your own copy of The Guidon. It will help you learn about what your cadet is going through. You can download it from the website or purchase a copy at the campus bookstore.\n\nThe book “In the Company of Men” by Nancy Mace gives you a terrific overview of knob year and the terms you’ll hear from your cadet.\n\nDon’t be in a rush when you visit. The knobs are not in control of their time. Bring a book and just be happy to see them when they can meet you.\n\nThe Citadel Family Association (CFA) volunteers are fellow parents. Email or call them for support as you learn the system. They are all parents of cadets who have gone through what you are going through. They can help you understand the system. Each Company/Battalion and Area of the country has a volunteer you can contact.\n\nThe CFA web site is a great resource especially the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section.\n\nSee the links below for other entires by Dorie Griggs:\n\nThe Making of a Military MomMom Readies for Son’s Military College\n\nThe Citadel: Year One a No Fly Zone for Hovering ParentsHow The Citadel “Ya-Yas” Came to BeLearning Leadership and Ethics at The CitadelThe Citadel Trained Me as Well as My Son\n\nThe Citadel: BVA’s and Summerall Guards\n\nThe Citadel: Recognition Day and Ring Weekend\n\nCare Packages for Cadets: The Citadel Heroes Project\n\nFiled under: Air Force, Education, Marines, Military families, National Guard, Navy, U.S. Army | Tagged: Air Force, Cadet, Cadet Prayer, CFA website, Citadel, Citadel Code, Citadel Family Association, Corps Day Weekend, Dorie Griggs, Facebook, Family, Guidon, In the Company of Men, Knob, Knob Knowledge, knob year, Marines, matriculation day, Milblogging.com, Military, military families, National Guard, National Guard of the United States, Physical Fitness Information, postaday2011, Success Packet, The Citadel The Military College of South Carolina, The Ring, United States Air Force, United States Army, United States Navy | 20 Comments »\n\nIn two months, my son will graduate from the Citadel and also be commissioned as a 2LT in the Army. I find myself filled with a jumble of emotions. While he has been the one to endure the many challenges of the 4th Class System and succeed, I feel like I’ve gone through my own type of training.\n\nAfter a recent conversation with a Brigadier General, I realize my training as an Army mom began when my son was in JROTC in high school. This past weekend, I had the opportunity to speak with the General on the transport train at the Atlanta airport. I made a joke of how I have found ways to learn about the Army training, much to the chagrin of my son. The General laughed and said HIS mother still has her ways to find out things about him.\n\nI know I’m not alone in wanting to learn about the process to better understand and support my son. My years as a volunteer in the Citadel Family Association and with the Atlanta Citadel Club’s parent group has proven that you should never underestimate the abilities of a mother to support their children. I made some wonderful friends the past several years. As I wrote about in a previous post, The Citadel Ya-Ya’s continue to be a source of friendship and support even after many of the group now have graduates of The Citadel.\n\nThere are so many neat friendships that I can’t list them all. A couple of people really do stand out though because I’ve been reunited with long time friends through our cadets.\n\nLast year some time in the early fall, I received an email asking if I am the same Dorie Griggs that went to Sparta High School in Sparta, NJ. I am. The note came from a long time friend Gwen Lynch Christ. It turns out her oldest son was a knob (first year cadet) last year. She saw my name of some Citadel Family Association correspondence and had to reach out.\n\nThe last time I remember seeing Gwen was in December of 1979. We were at our friend Chelle Chaudoin’s house. I’ve had a photo of us from that night on my desk for almost 30 years. Our friend Chelle died 5 months after the photo was taken in an airplane collision while she was at Arizona State. Chelle’s mother put the photo in a collage for me with a few other photos.\n\nAs life happens, I was in school in Virginia and rarely went back to NJ to visit. Gwen stayed in the north to finish school, work, marry, and raise her family. Here we are 30+ years later in regular contact because of our children. Gwen’s son Andrew is also in the Army ROTC at The Citadel, so we are both future Army moms too.\n\nYears ago, I met a great friend when by the luck of the draw she was assigned to my younger son as his occupational therapist. Marie McKenzie Dopson worked with Taylor for a few years. We developed a friendship, but after Taylor no longer needed therapy on a regular basis, we saw each other less often.\n\nWell this past summer, I found out we’d be in touch regularly again when Marie’s son’s name appeared on the list of incoming knobs at The Citadel. Marie attended the orientation I hosted in June for incoming knobs. We marveled how life has a way of bringing friends together, but we had no idea what would happen in just a few months.\n\nMarie’s son was assigned to the same company as my son. On Matriculation Day, the day first year cadets report, I told my son he knew the mother of one of the knobs. (Nelson would attend the therapy sessions with his younger brother years ago.) Apparently my little heads up to Nelson didn’t register. About a month later during a brief phone call, Nelson told me he selected his new knob mentee. His name is Dopson, he said. He is Marie’s son! The mentoring relationship solidifies friendships between cadets. Our sons will be friends for life, therefore connecting us as well.\n\nThe ties between the cadets at The Citadel are very strong. No one else besides the graduates who wear the ring can truly understand the bond that is formed from that shared experience.\n\nThe parents of the cadets may understand that bond better than anyone.\n\nPrevious posts by Dorie Griggs:\n\nThe Making of a Military Mom\n\nMom Readies for Son’s Military College\n\nThe Citadel: Year One a No Fly Zone for Hovering Parents\n\nHow The Citadel “Ya-Yas” Came to Be\n\nLearning Leadership and Ethics at The Citadel\n\nThe Citadel Trained Me as Well as My Son\n\nThe Citadel: BVA’s and Summerall Guards\n\nThe Citadel: Recognition Day and Ring Weekend\n\nCare Packages for Cadets: The Citadel Heroes Project\n\nFiled under: Air Force, Coast Guard, Education, Marines, Military families, National Guard, Navy, U.S. Army, Uncategorized | Tagged: 4th class system, Air Force, Atlanta Citadel Club, Cadet, Citadel Family Association, Dorie Griggs, Facebook, Family, military families, National Guard, NJ, postaday2011, Sparta, The Citadel The Military College of South Carolina, U.S. Army ROTC, United States Air Force, United States armed forces, United States Army | 12 Comments »\n\nThere is a time and place. Fellow blogger Harold’s Woodcrafting suggests military funeral protestors find a better time and different place to demonstrate. Harold wrote the following open letter to picketers with Westboro Baptist Church:\n\nFirst, I will congratulate you on the Supreme Court decision. It is a slippery slope when American’s rights start to be taken away. Where will it end when it starts?\n\nYou have kept the right of free speech and places free speech can be used.\n\nNow it is time to use those freedoms wisely. Why not go to Washington D.C.? It is after all our government and its policies you are protesting isn’t it? If you want governmental change use government centers for your protest, not military funerals.\n\nThose who have died and those in mourning are individuals just like you. They are not the government whose policies you do not like.\n\nWhy do you have the desire to picket funerals of our country’s military? They volunteered to serve our country and to protect the freedoms we have. They were then sent by our government, which is their boss, without a choice, into harms way and paid the ultimate sacrifice with their life.\n\nShouldn’t those mourning the loss of a loved one, get to lay them to rest with the respect and dignity deserved? Don’t they need love and compassion and our sympathies?\n\nI ask what Jesus would do? He came to seek those who were lost with love and compassion. In what you do where is the love and compassion of Jesus? Do your voices sound loving? Are your signs compassionate? Do your faces show the love of Jesus? For without love you are nothing but a clanging cymbal.\n\nJesus loved ALL and showed no partiality. He went to the sinners and was associated with them. He did not condone their sin, but still loved the sinners. He forgave their sin and He told them to sin no more. This He did with love.\n\nYes, Jesus had righteous anger. That was reserved for those taking advantage of the down-trodden and in the wrong place, the temple of worship. Also it was for those who thought they were better than others and were self-righteous. This is not the case with your actions. I and others see no love, only anger and hate. Jesus is not being seen through you.\n\nIt is not a sin to serve in our military. It is not a sin to die while serving in our military. Our military personnel should be held in high esteem for their desire to serve our country, and when told, to go into harms way. There is no greater sacrifice than laying your life down for another. That is what each one of those who die in service to our country, do for each of us. They gave up their rights to serve and their families are affected also.\n\nWhen it is time to mourn their death and remember their service, it should be done with honor and pride, and yet the deserved somberness, with no acrimony. It is what Jesus would do.\n\nWe must use our freedoms wisely and appropriately. Protesting at a funeral is not appropriate and it definitely shows a lack of wisdom, love and discernment.\n\nWith Jesus love,\n\nA sinner saved by Grace,\n\nHarold\n\nThe following is a PBS segment featuring the father of a Marine who sued the Westboro Baptist Church for protesting at his son’s funeral:\n\nFiled under: Air Force, Coast Guard, Marines, Military families, National Guard, Navy, U.S. Army, Veterans | Tagged: Arlington National Cemetery, First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Harold's Woodcrafting, Military funeral, military funeral protestors, postaday2011, Westboro Baptist Church | 4 Comments »"
