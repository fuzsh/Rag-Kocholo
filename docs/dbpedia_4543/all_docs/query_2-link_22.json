Harrison to Colonel Tupper\n\nv6:445\n\nR&dot; H&dot; HARRISON TO COLONEL TUPPER.\n\nNew-York, May 14, 1776.\n\nSIR: His Excellency received yours of the 13th instant, and it is his desire that you take every possible means to prevent an intercourse and communication with the ship-of-war, and to hurry the fitting of the other boats.\n\nAs to dislodging the people at the Light-House, he does not mean to advise an attempt, unless you are morally certain that it will be attended with success. A miscarriage would damp the spirits of the men at the first set-out, be held disgraceful, and the experiment in such case be considered as a departure from the plan and design you went on.\n\nI am, sir, yours, &c&dot;,\n\nR&dot; H&dot; HARRISON."
