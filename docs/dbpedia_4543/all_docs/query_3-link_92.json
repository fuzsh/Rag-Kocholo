        "text": "\"A tale of uplift, with the antislavery settlers embodying a vision of all that was best about American values and American ideals.\"\n\nâ The New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice\n\nâDavid McCullough has become perhaps our best-loved chronicler of Americaâs past. . . . The Pioneers is the account not just of one Ohio settlement but of myriad such places across America, where innumerable immigrants (as the settlers were known) came to make a fresh start in a strange land. It is a story as resonant today as ever.â\n\nâ Gerard Helferich, The Wall Street Journal\n\nâMcCullough is among the most thoughtful and thorough historians of the past two generations. . . . [A] great American mind.â\n\nâ John S. Gardner, The Guardian\n\n\"McCullough is a master of research along with being a wonderful storyteller. He takes the history of the area and turns what could be dry and dull into vibrant and compelling tales. . . . Lovers of history told well know that McCullough is one of the best writers of our past, and his latest will only add to his acclaim.\"\n\nâ Jeff Ayers, Associated Press\n\n\"To read The Pioneers is to understand that the settlement of the Northwest Territory was, in some ways, a second phase of the American Revolution â a messy experiment, touched by high ideals and bitter conflicts, that still resonates in ways weâre only beginning to grasp.\"\n\nâ Danny Heitman, Christian Science Monitor\n\nâLike McCullough's other books, The Pioneers succeeds because of the author's strength as a storyteller. The book reads like a novel, with a cast of fascinating characters that the average reader isn't likely to know about. . . . A worthy addition to McCullough's impressive body of work.â\n\nâ Michael Schaub, NPR.org\n\n\"Readers will immediately recognize that storytelling is one of Mr. McCulloughâs great literary strengths. He consistently produces engaging prose about a particular period of time, and makes history come alive.\"\n\nâ Michael Taube, The Washington Times\n\n\"A lively history of the Ohio River region in the years between the Revolution and the Civil War. . . . [McCullough's] narrative abounds with well-recognized figures in American historyâJohn Quincy Adams, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Johnny Appleseedâwhile highlighting lesser-known players. . . . Vintage McCullough and a book that students of American history will find captivating.\"\n\nâ Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\n\nâIn his usual revealing style, McCullough has crafted another dynamic volume of American history. With clarity and incisiveness, he details the experience of a brave and broad-minded band of people who crossed raging rivers, chopped down forests, plowed miles of land, suffered incalculable hardships and braved a lonely frontier to forge a new American ideal. They were indeed the pioneers.\"\n\nâ Dave Kindy, The Providence Journal"
