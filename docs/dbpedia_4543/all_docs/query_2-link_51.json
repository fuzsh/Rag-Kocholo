Book: A genealogy of the Allen family from 1568 to 1882, 1882. 5\n\nDr. James Tupper, a gentleman of education, was born in England, and came to this country previous to the Revolution. During that war he was a resident of Martha's Vineyard, where he married Deborah, daughter of Jonathan Allen. Afterwards he removed to Pownalboro, now Dresden. In company with Capt. William Allen, he purchased a vessel, loaded it with produce and sailed on a trading voyage to Halifax, N. S. The voyage was long and stormy. On their return, delayed by head winds and almost exhausted, they anchored at Cape Ann, where the crew went on shore. Doctor Tupper looked back and exclaimed: \"Now blow, Mr. Devil, the vessel is in a good harbor, well anchored.\" The wind rose in the night, the cable parted, and before morning the vessel was ground to fragments on the rocks. At Pownalboro the Doctor built the timber ship called the \"Experiment,\" of 513 tons. It was built and stowed with lumber, leaving only room for the navigators. He intended to sell the whole for timber in England, but the experiment was not successful. The vessel on its voyage to England was abandoned by the crew off the coast of Labrador. Doctor Tupper was the pioneer New Churchman, or Swedenborgian, in this state, scrupulously honest and, though eccentric, was ever regarded as an earnest and consistent Christian. He had a family of nine children who lived to adult age. Tristram, settled in Charleston, S. C. and died near the close of the Rebellion, loved by his large family and respected by all who knew him. Frederic Allen settled in Savannah, Ga., a ship broker. Capt. Jonathan Allen commanded several vessels built by Barzilla White of Richmond, Me., who married his sister Cordelia. Capt. Tupper died at an early age, leaving a widow and several children. Homes, the fourth son, was a ship broker in Savannah ; removed to Hallowell in 1832, and to Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1854, and died in 1865. Mary, one of the daughters, married Rev. Thomas N. Lord. Deborah, the youngest, died in Wintbrop, about 1836.\n\n5.

Thomas, Thomas), born in Nantucket, Mass., 12 Apr. 1754, died in Staten Isalnd, N. Y. 15 (19) Sept. 1819. He married in Nantucket, 15 May 1758, Deborah Allen, of Chilmark, Mass., born 3 Jan 1763, died 18 July 1829, daughter of Jonathan and Deborah (Gardner) Allen.\n\nDr. Tupper was educated in Sandwich and studied medicine there and in Martha's Vineyard. He lived in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard, from 1797 to 1805, Pownalboro (Dresden), Maine and in Richmond, Maine, living latterly in Dresden. In Maine he was recognized as a man of high intelligence and as a liberal entertainer. Among his descendants are the Charleston, South Carolina, families of distinction. While a resident of Maine, Dr. Tupper, in company with William Allen, purchased a vessel, loaded it with produce and sailed on a trading voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The voyage was long and stormy. On their return they anchored at Cape Ann, where the crew went ashore. Dr. Tupper looked back and exclaimed: \"Now blow, Mr. Devil, the vessel is in good harbor, well anchored.\" The wind rose in the night, the cable parted and before morning the vessel was found in fragments on the rocks. Dr. Tupper was credited with being \"the first position to advocate fresh air and out of door sleeping.\" \"Deborah, his wife, was a lovely and charming woman. The story is told of her riding his horse into the vestibule of the church in Dresden and hitching the bridle to the bell rope while she spent several hours visiting and shopping. As the horse was lively the result may be imagined.\" - From Nomie Davis Tupper, great-granddaughter of Dr. Tupper and granddaughter of Tristram Tupper.\n\nJames married Deborah Allen, daughter of Jonathan Allen and Unknown, on 17 May 1785 in Chilmark, Dukes, MA.1 (Deborah Allen was born on 3 Jan 1763 in Chilmark, Dukes, MA and died on 18 Jul 1829 in Winthrop, Kennebec, ME.)"
