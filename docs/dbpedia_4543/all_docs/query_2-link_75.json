The annual event marks the first battle of the 42nd Division in World War I, when on July 15, 1918 the division, acting as part of the 4th French Army, assisted in containing the final German offensive at the Battle of Champagne. The July anniversary also commemorates the reactivation of the division for service in World War II, when thousands of Soldiers reformed the division at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma for service in Europe.\n\nToday, the 42nd Infantry Division serves as part of the New York Army National Guard, based in Troy, N.Y. The division headquarters overseas the training and preparations for combat or disaster response of some 14,000 Soldiers across five states, including New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\n\nThis year's reunion brings together hundreds of WWII veterans, their legacy families and modern-era veterans of the 42nd Infantry Division.\n\nThe chairman of the foundation, retired Maj. Gen.
