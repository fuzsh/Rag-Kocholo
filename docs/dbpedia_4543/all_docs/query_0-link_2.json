        "text": "Statistics on the Army\n\nMonthly Rate of Pay - 1785\n\nFrom: William L. Otten. Frontier Major: (1783 - 1791). Colonel J. F. Hamtramck: his life and times, vol. 2. Port Aransas, Texas: Otten, 2003.\n\nArmy Definitions\n\nADJUTANT- In the U.S. Army of the Early Republic (1784 - 1815) the position of adjutant within a battalion or regiment was held by a commissioned officer who basically was the chief of staff for that organization. Lieutenant Colonel - Commandant and later Brigadier General Harmar had Ensign / Lieutenant Ebenezer Denny fill that position. Major General Arthur St. Clair had his Northwest Territorial Secretary / Lieutenant Colonel Winthrop Sargent fill that position in 1791 and Major General Wayne had Captain John Mills in that position in 1794 as well as commanding a battalion in his regiment during the campaign that year. These officers were paid an additional ten dollars per month and authorized additional rations (or the monetary value of those rations per month) which was added to their monthly base pay. After the 1796 revision of U.S. Army organizations, there wasn’t an Adjutant General or Inspector General position until 1813 when Colonel Thomas Cushing was promoted to Brigadier General and assigned as the next Adjutant General. An Adjutant General is commander of an army's administrative services.\n\nAIDES-DE-CAMP- Aides-de-camp could be anyone the commander wanted to appoint to the position and that person was paid extra money. General St. Clair had Lieutenant Ebenezer Denny as his aide-de-camp as well as two civilians who were not military in any sense of the term.\n\nBREVET PROMOTIONS- In the 19th century United States Arm, brevet promotions were extremely common. New officers received brevet rank until authorized positions were made available.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n​\n\nCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS- Very few commissioned officers in the U. S. Army of the Early Republic had military training other than what they received during the revolutionary war, if they were in that war. Fully trained junior leaders could not be had from the U.S. population unless they were foreign-born and had training in Europe. The training of future leaders was done prior to 1807 by something similar to an apprentice program with two cadets authorized per regiment at any one time. Frequently, those cadet positions went to worthy enlisted men. However, most new officers came from civilian life, had a better education than most, and had influencial friends or family who could recommend them to the War Department for a specific, congress approved commission. Their commissioning warrent was a specific, signed document. In that sense, they were different from warrent officers who served by federal administrative authority without receiving the blessings of specific congressional action. New junior officers began receiving military training after the Military Academy was established in 1807.\n\nFORAGE- Food for domestic animals.\n\n​\n\nNON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER- A non-commissioned officer is an enlisted member of an armed force who has been given authority by a commissioned officer.\n\nLEVY- The enlistment or conscription of men for military service.\n\nQUARTERMASTER- In land armies, the quartermaster is an individual who specializes in supplying, provisioning and transporting troops. A quartermaster did not necessarily have to be a soldier. Certainly no military unit commander of that time would tolerate a non-military quartermaster. However, the positions of Quartermaster General and Commissary General were civilian postions within the War Department and they managed military logistics operations which supplied each military garrison and operating field force. General St. Clair had ten male War Department civilians in his camp on November 4, 1791, who were horse wranglers for the Quartermaster and Commissary pack trains which tried to keep his army supplied with food and other items of equipment.\n\nSUBALTERN- A subaltern is a military term for a junior officer and the literal meaning is “subordinate.” Prior to about 1807, the junior officer ranks consisted of ensigns and lieutenants just like the U.S. Navy uses today. Then that was changed to 3rd, 2nd and 1st Lieutenants. The dividing line between 3rd and 2nd lieutenant depended on time and distance from the date they were appointed as 3rd lieutenant to when they actually reported to their command for duty and their unit commander recommended their elevation to 2nd lieutenant status. Promotion to 1st lieutenant depended upon a vacancy in the authorization tables maintained for each regiment and promotion within a regiment or from one regiment to another was determined by the War Department. Time and distance can mean the time it took for travel over the distance from their appointment location to their duty station and can include whatever length of time the individual claimed was needed to complete their personal affairs before they could depart home.\n\nFrom: Richard Lytle, the author of The Soldiers of America's First Army, 1791. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2004 and Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSome of the Men Serving at Fort Harmar or in the Indian Wars\n\nAs of 2009, no one has compiled a complete list of the officers and soldiers serving at Fort Harmar from the fall 1785 to late 1789. Men were moved in and out of Fort Harmar on a fairly regular basis – ordered to other forts on the frontier.

Josiah Harmar solicited a court of inquiry to examine his conduct on the last campaign during October 1790. Gen. Richard Butler served as the president of the court and several days were spent in examining testimony. The court made a report to George Washington that was highly honorable to Gen. Harmar.\n\nIn 1791, St. Clair succeeded Harmar as the senior general of the United States Army. He personally led a punitive expedition comprising of two Regular Army regiments and some militia. This force advanced to the location of Indian settlements on the Wabash River, but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by Miami Chief Little Turtle and Shawnee chief Blue Jacket. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, called St. Clair's Defeat, the \"Columbia Massacre,\" or the “ Battle of the Wabash.” It was the greatest defeat of the American army by Native Americans in history with some 623 American soldiers killed in action as opposed to about 50 enemy dead. After this debacle, he resigned from the army at the request of President Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory. From Wikipedia.\n\nOn November 7, 1791, Denny wrote, “when the army advanced from Fort Jefferson, it did not exceed 2,000 men; discharges, desertions and the absence of the first regiment, reduced the effective strength of the day of action to about 1400. The second regiment had but one battallion with the army – it was well appointed, but young in service. The officers and men, however, did their duty; they, with the battalion of artillery, were nearly all cut off. The whole loss, as now ascertained by the different returns, is 37 officers and 593 privates killed or missing; 31 officers and 252 privates wounded.

His mother was Elizabeth Harmar (died in 1780). Entering the Continental Army as a Captain in the First Battalion of the First Pennsylvania Regiment on October 27, 1775, he was promoted to Major of the Third Pennsylvania Regiment on October 1, 1776; transferred to the Second Regiment on January 1, 1777; promoted Lieut. Colonel of the Sixth Pennsylvania Regiment on June 6, 1777, and served actively until the end of the war. He was with Washington’s army in the campaign of 1778-80, being appointed Lieut. Colonel Commandant of the Seventh Pennsylvania Regiment on August 9, 1780, and was with General Greene’s Division in the South in 1781-82. He was transferred to the Third Pennsylvania Regiment on January 17, 1781, and to the First Pennsylvania Regiment on January 1, 1783. He was brevetted Colonel on September 30, 1783, and served to November 3 of the same year. On October 19, 1784, he married Sarah Jenkins (born March 14, 1761), sister of Mary Jenkins (who married Major Samuel Nicholas), and the same year bore to France the ratification of the Definitive Treaty. On January 20, 1785, he was Indian Agent for the Northwest Territory, and a party to the Fort McIntosh Treaty. On August 12, 1784, he was appointed Lieut. Colonel of the First United States Regiment of Infantry and subsequently became Commander of the Army, serving as suchfrom September 27, 1789, to March 14, 1791. In 1790, he commanded an expedition against the Miami Indians. On July 31, 1787, he was brevetted Brigadier General by solution of Congress. He resigned his commission on January 1, 1792; and on Thursday, April 11, 1793, was\n\nappointed Adjutant General of the Pennsylvania Militia, which office he held during the Whisky Insurrection, and until Wednesday, February 27, 1799, when he resigned and was succeeded by Peter Baynton. He was an active member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati, serving as its Secretary from 1783 to 1785 and again in 1793. He died in Philadelphia at his home near Gray’s Ferry, on August 20, 1813, when 60 years of age, and was buried in St. James’ Churchyard, Kingsessing. His son, Josiah Harmar (born 1802) died on December 31, 1848, in his 47th year.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Philadelphia, PA: Historical Society of Pennsylvania, vol. XLVI, 1922, pp. 364-365.\n\nFort Harmar\n\nIn November 1785 a detachment of U.S. troops under the command of Major John Doughty constructed Fort Harmar, named for Colonel Josiah Harmar, on elevated bottom land on the west side of the Muskingum River at its confluence with the Ohio River.\n\nConstruction of the pentagonal fort, which enclosed about three fourths of an acre, was completed in 1786.\n\nThe main walls, 120 feet in length, were constructed of large timbers laid horizontally, to a height of 12 or 14 feet.\n\nAt each of the five corners were bastions made of logs set upright in the ground. Three of the bastions were mounted with cannon; the two facing the two rivers were not.\n\nBarracks for the enlisted men extended along the main walls, with their roofs sloping inward. They were divided into rooms about 30 feet long and furnished with fireplaces.\n\nOfficers’ quarters, made of hewn logs and one and a half or two stories high, were part of the bastions. They had kitchens in the back and stone chimneys.\n\nThe barracks on the wall facing the Ohio River were topped with a cupola that served as a sentinel post. A flagstaff was mounted atop the cupola with a room beneath serving as a guardhouse.\n\nA well near the center of the fort supplied water in case of a siege. Water for ordinary purposes was carried from the river.\n\nGardens and orchards were located west and northwest of the fort.\n\nBetween the fort and the Muskingum River stood three large log buildings that served the blacksmith, carpenter, and mechanics.\n\nIn 1788 a treaty bower, or cabin, was built outside the northeast bastion of the fort, where the treaty with the Indians was held in 1788-9.\n\nFrom Samuel P.

Clements Library, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\nFort Harmar Military Field Headquarters on the Ohio\n\nCongress authorized it, Major General Richard Butler picked the site, Josiah Harmar gave the order, Major John Doughty designed it, and the men under his command and the commands of Captain Jonathan Heart, Lieutenant James Bradford, and Lieutenant Ebenezer Frothingham built the fort.\n\nOn October 25, 1785, Captain Doughty and his company, along with Heart, Bradford, and Frothingham and their commands, left Fort McIntosh for the Muskingum. The 150 men arrived on November 5 and began construction of pentagonal Fort Harmar on the west side of the mouth of the river. Although the first regular detachment moved into their new quarters on November 30, the fort was not completed until spring 1786.\n\nThe fort was one of the first built by the U.S. military and site of the first U.S. artillery brought into Ohio. Perhaps unique in U.S. frontier history, one of the original purposes of the fort was to forcibly evict\n\nFort Harmar plaque at Marietta, Ohio, September 2012\n\nsettlers already living north of the Ohio, derided as “squatters,” not to protect them from Indians. Congress mandated their eviction because they lacked government-issued land titles. Another purpose of the fort was to protect federal survey crews charged with gridding the Seven Ranges in southeastern Ohio for sale at public auction. The fort was unusual in other ways. Its log walls were laid up horizontally rather than stuck vertically into the ground; it had five sides rather than the usual four; and for three years, 1786-9, it served as U.S. Army field headquarters for the entire western frontier. Ultimate military command, however, rested with Secretary at War Henry Knox in New York City. Fort Harmar also was distinctive due to its extensive gardens and orchards west and northwest of the fort. For their own use, officers and soldiers planted beans, peas, squashes, and melons which, given the rich river bottom soil surrounding the fort, grew in abundance. They also planted a peach orchard, a variety of which came to be known as the Doughty peach.\n\nOn April 7, 1788, a vanguard of 48 Ohio Company settlers, led by Rufus Putnam, arrived from New England to establish a town, first called Adelphia, across the Muskingum from the fort. In July Northwest Territorial Governor Arthur St. Clair and Territorial Secretary Winthrop Sargent arrived at Adelphia — the name soon changed to Marietta — to establish civil government and federal control of the territory. A pressing task of the federal officials was to conduct a treaty with discontented Indian tribes in order to satisfy their grievances, including land claims. After an initial attempt to treat with select tribes at the falls of the Muskingum (present Philo) failed in summer 1788 (due\n\nFort Harmar depicted in Benson J. Lossing - The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812\n\nto a surprise attack by renegade Chippewa), St. Clair rescheduled the treaty for late fall and, for protection, relocated it to the vicinity of Fort Harmar. The sessions began December 13, 1788, and ended one month later. On January 9, 1789, two separate treaties were signed near Fort Harmar. However, these treaties failed to prevent increasingly frequent raids by both whites and Indians along the Ohio frontier, especially to and from Kentucky. As immigrants flooded downriver in search of land, so did the location and intensity of violence. To protect those settlers, in early 1789 the government decided to relocate both its territorial capital and its military headquarters from Marietta to Losantiville (Cincinnati). In December 1789 St. Clair and Harmar left Fort Harmar for the new headquarters at newly constructed Fort Washington. By January 1790, and throughout the year, only a few soldiers were stationed at Fort Harmar. In their stead, local militia provided defense for Marietta and the Company’s nascent perimeter settlements at Belpre and Waterford. Although used for various purposes for short times, the neglected fort decayed, became more or less derelict, and was finally demolished in the summer 1791. A plaque near Harmar Elementary School marks its approximate location. The precise location of the fort cannot be determined. As the large influx of settlers in the early 1800s cleared more and more fields and forests in the Muskingum valley, the river became increasingly muddy, filling its bottom with silt and sediment. The increased side pressure eroded its banks and broadened the river, encroaching upon the site and carrying it away piecemeal. By 1850 more than half of the original ground enclosed by the fort, including remnants of the stone well which had stood in its center, had slipped over the bank of the Muskingum. Later dam construction on the Ohio likely further inundated the site, leaving most of it under the Muskingum at its mouth, extending out into the Ohio.\n\nFrom Richard Walker, Ph.D., The Theft of Ohio: Treaty of Fort Harmar 1789. (MSS., 2009).\n\nEvents that had an Impact on Fort Harmar and the War on the Indians\n\n1784 June 2\n\nCongress passed a resolution disbanding the last remnants of the Continental Army.\n\n1784 June 3\n\nCongress passed a resolution establishing a peacetime regiment of 700 men, to be furnished by four states. These men were to occupy posts vacated by the British on the northwest boundaries of the United States and to discourage settlers or “squatters” from moving into the Ohio country.\n\n​\n\n1784\n\nCol. Josiah Harmar, a Revolutionary War veteran who was now 30 years old, assumed command of the First American Regiment.\n\n1785\n\nThe Land Ordinance of 1785 set forth the first rectangular system of land survey for the area north and west of the Ohio River. It also specified the division and sale of the land. Although Congress authorized the survey of 13 ranges, threats by Indians, the difficulty and seasonality of the work, the cost of military protection, and the lackluster sales of the first five ranges at auction in New York caused the scope of the project to be reduced from 13 to 7 ranges. That portion, beginning near present-day East Liverpool, Ohio, became known as the Seven Ranges. The newly formed army protected the surveyors from Indians and settlers.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n1785 November\n\nFort Harmar was built in the fall 1785 at the mouth of the Muskingum River and garrisoned by one battalion of the regiment under Major John Doughty.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n​\n\n1786 February 8\n\nAccording to one officer (name unknown), Fort Harmar was“ very commodious and completely finished – the gates are all shut at night, and we rest secure.

A regiment of infantry and a battalion of artillery, in all about 700 officers and men, were retained at the close of the war to guard public stores and property and to occupy posts vacated by the British on the northwest boundaries of the United States. By act of Congress of June 3, 1784, it was resolved, ‘As it appears absolutely necessary to have 700 non-commissioned officers and men properly officered, it is recommended to the following States as most convenient to the posts shortly to be vacated by the British to furnish from their militia: Connecticut, 165; New York 165; New Jersey, 110; Pennsylvania, 260, to serve 12 months, unless sooner discharged.’\n\n​\n\nThe troops this provided for were formed into a regiment, consisting of 8 companies of infantry and 2 companies of artillery, under the command of Lieut.
