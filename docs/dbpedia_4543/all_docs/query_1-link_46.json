        "text": "People also got mad about taxes, especially that Stamp Act in 1765,. What nerve!. Forcing folks to buy expensive stamps for their legal papers.. That's when the \"Sons of Liberty\" got started. . Oh, there was lots of anger - all headed for bloodshed. And sure enough, five years later British soldiers killed four men and wounded seven in Boston. People don't forget things like that. For the next thirteen it was remembered every fifth of March when somebody would give a speech in Boston's Old South Meeting House - until 1783 when they changed it to Fourth of July speeches. But that so-called \"massacre\" wasn't the only trouble in Boston. There was that Boston Tea Party in 1773. Fifty men dressed up like Indians. And one of them was your ancestral uncle, Colonel John May. uncle to Amariah Dana's wife. (31)\n\nHe and the rest of those men boarded three ships, cut open more than 300 chests of tea, and dumped it overboard. After that we were headed toward war. Patrick Henry knew that when he spoke out in 1775. (32)\n\n\"It is too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery. The war is inevitable and let it come. The next gale that weeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms. I know not what course others may take but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.\"\n\nThat Patrick Henry knew what he was talking about. War did come in 1775 when General Gage sent 800 redcoats to Lexington where they were supposed to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock before going on to Concord where patriots had stored some military supplies. Every schoolboy knows what happened then. Yes, Paul Revere saw the lantern signal in Boston's North Church belfry, sending him on his way to tell everybody that the British were coming. So when the redcoats got to Lexington on April 19, they were met by Captain John Parker and fifty minute-men. You've heard Parker's famous words.\n\n\"Stand your ground. Don't fire unless fired upon; but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.\"\n\nAnd stand they did. That's where it all began. Eight minute-men were killed and ten were wounded. At Concord, more than 400 minute-men turned back the British regulars. By noon the British were hightailing it back to Boston. Next day Governor Gage was hemmed in at Boston by an army of 16,000 patriots. And one of the minute-men there was my grandfather, Hezekiah Mehuren. (33)\n\nWe've already talked about Amariah Dana connecting with Ethan Allen and the \"Green Mountain Boys,\" but you're not sure when or where. Was it in Pomfret, Connecticut, where he might have been trying to protect his land grant? If he was up against the Crown then, that could have been a bad time for Amariah. If so, it wasn't his only bad time at Pomfret. Both of his parents died there in 1770. (34) Three years later Amariah moved his pregnant wife and family from Pomfret to Amherst, Massachusetts. Now maybe that move had nothing to do with land grant problems but who knows? If such troubles forced him to move, he very well could have been bitter and angry toward the Crown, especially when his baby daughter, Lucretia, fell under a wagon wheel when they were going through Belchertown. How painful it must have been when they had to bury the poor babe there. But they had to move on and they did. They settled in Amherst where Dorothy Dana gave birth to another baby girl in October, 1773. They named her Lucretia too, in memory of the poor baby killed at Belchertown. (35)\n\nDid all those events have anything to do with Amariah joining up with Ethan Allen? Maybe and maybe not. But whatever the reason he did hook up with Ethan and his \"Green Mountain Boys,\" helping them to capture Fort Ticonderoga. (36) (37) Now isn't that a much better story than what happened in that same area back in 1758 when my poor grandfather, Seth Willis, was fighting with the British against the French. So let's take a look at how Amariah Dana might have gotten involved with all that.\n\nAmariah may have been recruited by Colonel John Brown, a young lawyer in Pittsfield who wanted Ethan Allen and the \"Green Mountain Boys\" to take Fort Ticonderoga as soon as any fighting broke out. (38) Brown gathered up a bunch of Massachusetts men. Some say about forty. Others say more. (39) Whatever the number, it's likely that Amariah Dana was one of them. They joined with another sixteen men who came up from Connecticut, commanded by Colonel Samuel Parsons. This was probably around May, 1775, just two weeks after Amariah's daughter, Mary, was born. Then they all went to the Catamount Tavern in Bennington where they joined the leaders of the \"Green Mountain Boys\" to plan what they were going to do next. From there they went to Richard Bentley's farmhouse at Castleton where they assembled, organized, and made some more plans. And maybe that's where it was decided that the Massachusetts men would be commanded by Colonel James Easton. After that meeting, Ethan Allen went on ahead to spy out the land. While he was out doing that, some of the men were sent to Skenesboro to capture Major Philip Skene, a big Tory landholder in those part, and then to find some boats for crossing the lake. (40) (41)\n\nYou're wondering if Amariah Dana might have been with those soldiers going after Major Skein. But maybe he was with all those who stayed back at Bentley's farmhouse and were there when Benedict Arnold arrived. Arnold busted into the room where Ethan Allen was making plan, waving a fancy commission around and demanding command of the force. Can you picture what happened when the two of them went outside to announce that to Amariah and all those other men who didn't give a hoot about the commission even if it was from the Massachusetts Provincial Congress's Committee of Safety. They didn't care that it said that Arnold could raise a force, appoint officers, and go on to take Fort Ticonderoga so he could capture some cannon. Yes, it must have been some scene. Here's one of the stories about what happened:\n\n\"Colonel Arnold strode into the place where Ethan was laying out his plan, produced his commission and announced that he had come to take command. Ethan looked at Arnold and the paper. It was a fine commission, written in an ornate hand on long paper. Ethan had no such commission. All he had was a document from the Connecticut legislature. So Ethan nodded and asked Colonel Arnold to come outside, so Ethan might say a few words to explain the change to the troops. Colonel Arnold was gratified. He followed Ethan, who was dressed in his ragged Green Mountain Boys uniform. (Ethan was one of the few who had any uniform at all) and they moved among the Boys, who were squatting and sitting among their campfires. Summoning them with his loudest voice, Ethan explained that the handsome debonair colonel had come to lead them all into battle and he showed the commission. The plan would be the same. The pay would be the same, about two dollars per man. Only the command would be different. The Boys in their buckskins scrutinized the cockatoo colonel in the blue uniform, and in a very leisurely way got up and began to stack their arms, the symbol of a camp at rest. It was their announcement of their intention. Colonel Arnold watched, at first in unconcern and then in growing dismay as the import of the action grew on him. The Boys began to speak up. They were not going to serve under some pipsqueak ordered from Boston. Ethan Allen was their colonel and had been for four years. Arnold still wanted that command - the glory was there to be seized. Then Ethan said no, he was not going to jeopardize the success of the expedition, and Arnold could not have command. But here is what Ethan would do; Arnold could walk with him and see what happened, though he was not to interfere.\" (42)\n\nYou don't know one way or another but when you read that piece, you did like the thought that your 4th great-grandfather might have been one of the men who spoke up and object to Arnold. In that spirit you enjoyed this more colorful version.\n\n\"He appears to have told Ethan curtly that the Committee had ordered him to take charge of the expedition. An imperious manner was not the thing to try on Colonel Allen. Exactly what happened next has been lost in one hundred and sixty-five years of controversy but it is certain that a violent row ensued. Ethan vowed, by God, that he had been elected to lead the attack. Arnold, proud as a peacock and dressed much like one, waved his commission from Cambridge. Somebody, doubtless old Peleg Sunderland, suggested hanging 'the fancy barstard,' and men shouted that if they were not to be commanded by their own officers, the hell with the War, if that was what is was; they would shoulder their arms and go home. Knowing they had no time to spare and that a controversy might wreck the expedition, Ethan and his second in command, Easton, told the unruly soldiers that Allen should lead them. Privately, it would appear from the record, Allen gave Arnold permission to march with him at the head of the column.\" (43)\n\nFrom that account you might guess that Amariah Dana was about ready to head back to Amherst if Arnold took command. But it seem that he and Allen worked out some sort of compromise. It was a shaky sort of truce and Arnold tried again to take over when they got to Fort Ticonderoga. And you're not really sure how large their force was when they got there. The Dana genealogy sources say that Amariah was one of 63 men at Ticonderoga. Other sources say that around eighty men were with Ethan Allen when he took the fort. (44) (45) (46) (47)\n\n\"After the invasion force of some eighty men had landed on the shore near the fortress... Colonel Arnold stuck in his horn again. He stepped forward and demanded that he command the attack. An now Colonel Allen, his nerves already much frayed, exploded. 'By God, sir,' he roared, laying hand to his sword, 'I'll have you to understand I am in command here!' Then turning to Amos Callender, one of his old Green Mountain Boys, Ethan asked, 'What shall I do with this damned rascal? Shall I put him under guard?' But Ethan took no further step just then. There wasn't time if the attack was to be a surprise. Stepping to front and center of his army, the tall commander delivered a brief army-style pep talk, full of bombastic praise for his gallant troops. He told the Boys that they were the scourge and terror of all arbitrary power. He said that the fortress before them must be taken quickly, once the attack was begun. He called it a desperate attempt which none but the bravest of men would dare undertake at all and gave the faint-hearted a chance to get out before it was too late... 'You that will undertake voluntarily,' he said, 'will poise your firelocks.' Up went an assortment of rifles, pistols, fowling pieces, blunderbusses, clubs, hangers, hunting knives. It is doubtful if a greater range of weapons was used in any engagement of the Revolution. Ethan looked the mob over and was content. 'Forward march,' he ordered. He was at the head of the column with Arnold beside him, the only figure of military appearance in the lot.\" (48)\n\nWhat kind of a weapon do you suppose Amariah had? Probably a good one because he knew what he was doing as a solider, having gotten a taste of it during the French and Indian War. You can imagine that he might have relished the thought of attacking the British after all that trouble with his land grant. And this tale gives you an idea of how eager the \"Green Mountain Boys\" were to take them on.\n\n\"When they entered the fort, the men were at best pseudo-soldiers. Now, even though they had not tasted blood, they became as wild as the Indians. Some of them were accustomed to fighting. Howling 'No quarter!' and imitating the war cries of Mohawks, they tore through the parade ground to batter at the many doors of the barracks. Bedlam had come to Ticonderoga.\" (49)\n\nCan you picture my father-in-law whooping it up like an Indian and changing through the fort looking for redcoats. What a sight Amariah must have been that day! Could he have been the one that the British soldier lunged at in the next part of this story. If so, he would have been right on the spot to see Ethan Allen confronting the sleepy British lieutenant who came out without any pants on.\n\n\"One brave but careless redcoat came out of the guardroom to lunge at an invader with his fixed bayonet. Ethan saw the move and fetched the redcoat a terrific swipe over the head with the flat of his sword, felling him to the ground. A heavy comb in the man's hair saved his skull. Quarter, quarter!\" he begged. Ethan poised is sword as if to run the man through, then thought better of it. 'Take me to your commander,' he bellowed. The fallen man jumped to his feet to lead the way to the foot of a short stairway to the upper portion of the west barracks. 'The officers' quarters are there,\" he said.\n\nWith a leap like a catamount, Ethan started up the stairs.. 'Come out of there, you sons of British bitches,' he called in a right clear voice. As he spoke the door opened revealing an officer wearing coat and waistcoat and a pair of drawers. He carried his breeches over one arm. The apparition was not, as Ethan believed, the fort's commander. It was Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, second in command to Captain Delaplace.\n\nThe pantless lieutenant faced enough trouble on the stairs to have made many an officer lose his head. There was the gigantic figure of Allen with a sword , not seen every day. Next to Allen was the very military Colonel Arnold. And back of Arnold, crowing the stairs, was a mob of shouting, howling wild men, every one of them displaying arms and most them crying aloud for British blood.\" (50)\n\nAmariah very well might have been one of those shouting that he wanted to kill some redcoats. Or maybe he was just laughing at the sight of a lieutenant minus his pants and trying to keep his dignity while talking to Ethan Allen, Benedict Arnold, and a mob of Allen's followers. Amariah may not have been impressed by the sight of that lieutenant but he surely must have been impressed by Ethan Allen's colorful language.\n\n\"The lieutenant was as brave as they came. He remained cool. Stalling for time in the hope that his garrison would rally and begin shooting into the invaders, he asked for silence which was accorded. Then he spoke. 'By what authority have you entered His Majesty's fort? he demanded.... Then Colonel Ethan Allen... let him have it. 'In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress,' he answered with some dignity. (51)\n\nLieutenant Feltham...continued to stall for time, still hoping that his soldiers would appear below stairs and run these hoodlums out of the fort. 'Who are you people?' he began, 'and who - '\n\nEthan leaped to the landing beside Feltham. 'By God,' he swore, 'I shall have possession of this fort and all the effects of George the Third!' And he waved his great sword over and around the lieutenant' head. The mob below stairs set up a shouting. The leveled their muskets at the one lone and trouserless redcoat while Ethan ripped out a series of oaths so shocking that his own men listened in rapt wonder. 'And if you don't immediately comply,' he concluded, 'no man, woman or child shall be left alive in this goddam place.'\n\nFeltham replied correctly that he was not the commander. Sensing now that the man he wanted to see was in the room behind Feltham, Ethan started to batter in the door. Arnold dissuaded him and presently Captain Delplace, fully dressed, came out. Shoving Feltham into the upper room and placing two sentries, Allen and Arnold took Delaplace below to discuss affairs. While these events were going forward, the invaders had broken into all the barrack rooms, finding several redcoats still in bed. The garrison's arms were collected and thrown into a room and a guard set. Captain Delaplace was ordered to parade his men without arms, which was done. Ticonderoga was taken, the first British position to fall.\" (52)\n\nSo what do you think Amariah and all those other men did after they secured the fort? Think they curled up quietly for a nap? Hah! Not very likely. No, they probably celebrated, getting drunk on the British liquor supplies and generally raising hell.\n\n\"The attention of the victors, naturally enough, was first directed not to the ordnance captured, but to the vast stores of rum in the fort. The door leading to the private cellar of Captain Delaplace was quickly breached by strong thirsty men wielding musket butts and artillery rammers. It yielded an even ninety gallons of strong excellent stuff. The garrison's issue rum stores were also attacked with vigor.. With things running so smoothly, Colonel Allen, Colonel Easton, and John Brown bellied around the ex-commandant's tale tin the officers' quarters. They filled mugs to the brim and tossed them down in the manner of two-fisted drinking men. The rank and file went hog-wild. Yelling like crazed devils, they ran everywhere through the fort, breaking into every room, cellar, shed and cupboard, plundering or scattering whatever they happened on The twenty-odd women and children must have been frightened out of their wits but there was then or later no charge of ill-treatment in this quarter.\" (53)\n\nAmariah and his fellow soldiers weren't the only ones celebrating. Folks from all over the countryside came into the fort when they heard all the commotion. This account sound like they got caught in the spirit of the festivities and had a wild time\n\n\"By now more than two hundred American swarmed in and around the fort and they wee joined throughout the day by country folk from near-by farms, come to see what was up. Soldiers and farmers fell downstairs, tumbled off walls; broke jugs, bottles, windows. Matthew Lyon, the ebullient Irish-Yankee, who later became a national character, felt that .something special was needed to mark the day. Fetching a bucket of powder from the magazine, he poured it down the gullet of Old Sow, a thirteen-inch mortar, and let her go. It was a blast so mighty, legend has it, that the fort fairly rocked and five patriots, snoozing dead drunk in Delaplace's cellar, were immediately revived and were able to finish the day on their feet, much to the credit of the Green Mountain Boys.\" (54)\n\nI suppose that Amariah and just about everybody else was having a fine old time. Except for one unhappy man, Benedict Arnold. As a disciplined army officer, he just couldn't understand the \"Green Mountain Boys.\" He must have hated the way they treated him.\n\n\"Colonel Arnold was aghast at the pillage and drunkenness. He attempted to put a stop to it and to force some degree of discipline but to no avail. And later he reported that Colonel Allen was 'a proper man to head his own wild people' but was wholly unfit for military command. Arnold again brought up the matter as to his own 'rightful' command of the fort, pointing out that Allen had no commission at all. Hot words passed between the two colonels. The convivial soldiers also took a hand, and again they declared that if Ethan was not their commander, then by God, they'd up and go home, the whole lot of them - an empty threat so long as the liquor held out... Colonel Arnold put in some very bad hours. The soldiers hooted him, called him vile names, and he wrote in his memorandum book that at least two of them fired their muskets in a manner to send balls whistling close by him.\" (55)\n\nHow about that? Now we speculate that my father-in-law might have been one of those shooting at Benedict Arnold. Who knows? But considering what a traitor Arnold turned out to be later on, maybe it would have been just as well for Amariah or some other patriot to kill him. I'd bet they were all getting fed up with Arnold's repeated posturing and his efforts to take command away from their cherished Ethan Allen. Bet that as it may, Arnold did manage to gather some new recruits a few days later. With those as his new command, he left Allen and set off on his own, capturing the single remaining British sloop on the lake at the little village of St. Jean on May 18. Coming back on that boat, he met Ethan and ninety of his mean in a fleet. They were headed toward St. Jean, intending to occupy and hold it. That was against Arnold's opinion that the adventure was useless and not practical since the American now controlled the lake. Despite Arnold's advice, Allen and his men arrived at St. Jean and learned that some British troops were advancing toward the village. At first they decided to ambush the redcoats but then decided against it. Then they crossed the Richelieu River and encamped for the night. But the next morning they woke up to a volley of grapeshot and musketry from British artillery. They fled to their boats and all but three escaped. (56)\n\nOnce again you can only wonder if Amariah Dana among those in that expedition. And you do n't know exactly when he left Ethan Allen and went back to his home in Amherst. You know only that by May 22 Ethan's St. Jean's expedition was back at Crown Point while Arnold was at Ticonderoga. And you know that his men had been steadily departing for their homes and that in another week they were all gone, leaving Allen with no command. (57)\n\nAnyway Amariah was probably back with his family by the end of May, perhaps enjoying a well-deserved rest. Ah, but do you wonder if he might have been tempted to be part of the next great battle of the Revolution? For it was only weeks later that more than a thousand British and more than four hundred patriots were killed and wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill in Charlestown. (58)No, Amariah was not there but he must have been intensely interested in it. Not just because it was an important battle but because part of the battleground had once belonged to his mother's uncle, Edward Sumner. (59) You learned that from this account.\n\n\"Immediately after the Battle of Bunker Hill... some trees in Edward Sumner's orchard... were cut down, sharpened to points and then so placed as pickets to protect the portions exposed to attack. Five hundred men and officers constituted the main and picket guard for this line where Edward Sumner once lived so peacefully. (60)\n\nIt wasn't too long after Bunker Hill that Amariah Dana was back in action. This time he was a Revolutionary War soldier with Captain James Hendrick's company in Charlestown on Jan 13, 1776, less than a week after he death of his twelve year old son, Ezra.. Six months later the Declaration of Independence was signed. That must have inspired Amariah to name my wife \"Freedom Dana\" when she was born about sixteen months later on May 2, 1777. Her birth didn't slow down Amariah's soldiering.. Five days after that event he enlisted again, serving two months before returning home where he remained for the next five weeks until he joined up again. But this time for only three days, responding to an alarm. (61)\n\nNo record of any other military service for Amariah. You don't know what he did during the rest of 177, that awful year when Washington's men suffered through Valley Forge. So many men with bloody, bar, frost-bitten feet. So much sickness. Feisty as Amariah was, he might not have survived that winter. But he wasn't there. And you have no idea what he did in 1778. But you do know that his wife, Dorothy, died of dropsy the next year, Dec 9, 1779, after bearing Amariah eight children. My poor wife. Freedom was only about two and a half years old when her mother died. Amariah was left with six motherless children, That must about when he decided to let one of his wife's relatives adopt six-year old Lucretia. Why little Lucretia? Do you suppose it had anything to do with her being named after that poor baby Lucretia that fell under the wagon wheel? Maybe her name brought back painful memories for Amariah. But maybe the decision had nothing to do with that. And who was the relative of Amariah's wife who adopted the second Lucretia. Why none other than her uncle, Colonel John May of Boston Tea Party fame.\n\nAmariah soon realized that he needed another wife to help raise all those children. So he married Ruth Williams in 1780 and had eight more children (62)\n\n.\n\nAfter being with Ethan Allen and soldiering in the Revolution, you would think that Amariah would have had enough of rebellion. But not my father-in-law. Amariah and his grown son, Eleazer, were both active in Shays Rebellion. You got some idea of why they did so when you read about how Daniel Shays led a rebellion by farmers in western Massachusetts ho were sick of the high taxes, the unstable currency, and the expenses of lawsuits in land disputes. For Amariah, such mismanagement of government might have been just as galling as the land-grabbing actions of the New Yorkers years earlier.\n\nOn August 19, 1786, Shays' rebel mobs stormed the courthouse in Northampton to prevent the trial and imprisonment of debtors. Then in September Shays and 600 armed farmers stormed the courthouse in Springfield. Amariah and Eleazer could have been with Shays during either or both of those courthouse attacks. And maybe they were with him on January 25, 1787, when he led 2000 rebels to Springfield to storm the arsenal. The rebels were subdued, captured and sentenced to death but were later pardoned. Amariah and Eleazar were very possibly among those because they both took an oath of allegiance in February, 1787, probably as a condition pardon after their actions in the rebellion. (63) (64)\n\nAmariah might have come close to execution in 1787 but he seems to have settled down after that. He was probably as patriotic as ever in 1812 when that second war with Britain broke out. At age 74, he was then much too old to fight again. However his son, Joseph, and his grandson, Austin, were soldiers in that war. (65)\n\nAmariah Dana's second wife, Ruth Williams, died of dropsy on April 14, 1822. You don't have any information about how he lived his next eight years but you do know that he was living with his son, Joseph, at Amherst in 1830 and that he died on October 29th of that year at the ripe old age of ninety-two. You visited his grave in the South Amherst cemetery in 1993. (66)\n\nMEHURIN AND WILLIS ANCESTORS\n\nIN WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS\n\nI've notice that as you've studied how your Willis ancestors moved from the Stoughton/Easton area of Norfolk county to western Massachusetts, you've learned to pay more attention to little pieces of information. Like what you read about Seth Willis living in North Easton not far from Josiah Keith's family. So they were neighbors. Josiah's daughter, Silence, was a young widow when Seth married her in 1746, having married Benjamin Smith in 1739. (67)\n\nYou don't know when Seth and Silence moved to Worthington in western Massachusetts but you are guessing that it was probably around 1774 which was the year of Seth's last land sale. (68) You also know that they were in Worthington in 1790, as was their son, Amasa, who married Hezekiah Mehurin' daughter, Maria. And of course Amasa and Maria were my parents. Hezekiah was among the first settlers of Worthington after 1764 and his wife, Abigail, was one of the first people recorded in the Worthington church. (69) (70)\n\nYou also saw that another of your ancestors, Reverend Stephen Tracy, from nearby Partridgeville, had one of his daughters, Susanna, baptized in the Worthington Congregational Church on 24 May 1778. She was a sister to Mary Tracy who married Titus Doolittle. Their daughter, Sarah, married my son, Russell and they became your great-great grandparents. So you see you have a lot of ancestors connected with the Worthington church. (71)\n\nLouis, I know that on one of the walls in your home, you've got a picture of the present Congregational Church in Worthington that replaced the large colonial steepled church that burned in 1887. I remember that older church and many other things about Worthington. Especially the story that the old settlers told about the cave on Goffe Hill. They said that three men had once come there and lived in the cave, probably in the winter of 1677 and 1678. One of them died and the other two went north.... The story was that the three men were three of the judges who signed the death warrant of King Charles I and then fled to New England when King Charles II was restored to the throne - Edward Whalley, William Goffe, and John Dixwell. Ah, that story reminds you of your visit to a cave in New Haven where Whalley and Goffe hid because you knew that the cave was on land that once belonged to another one fo your ancestors, Richard Sperry, who helped hid and feed the regicides. And you read somewhere that when they left New Haven, they went north to Hadley and that a third regicide, John Dixwell, joined them there but later went back to New haven. But all of that was many years before any of your Willis or Mehurin ancestors lived in those parts. In fact it was about a hundred years before Seth Willis suffered some terrible misfortunes in his old age. (72) (73)\n\nReading the records of the Congregational Church in Worthington, you found an entry dated July 7, 1789, which recorded the church's concern with some incident in which Eli Metcalf was accused of cheating Seth Willis . (74) (75)\n\nExamining earlier church records, you saw that Metcalf joined the church in 1774, was accused of lying in 1785, and in 1786, confessed to the church his fault \"for uttering a false report about himself, or for calling himself a Doctor or professed physician.\" Looking ahead you found that the church minutes for August 17, 1789 provided more details about Eli Metcalf's conduct toward Seth Willis.\n\n\"The Chh met according to adjournment at 9:00 o-clock A.M. at the Meeting House, and whereas Eli Metcalf then stood charges, by the aforesaid Complaint, with injustice and fraud in keeping back a part of what was charitably bestowed on or for the above named S. Willis and entrusted to the care of said Metcalf to deliver to said Willis, who was then in needy circumstance on account of his dwelling house, household furniture, provision &c being consumed by fire, which took place about the close of the year 1788: Willis was committed a few weeks after this..\" (76)\n\nYou were saddened to learn that my grandfather's house burned down, leaving him a pauper. And you were shocked to learn that Eli Metcalf cheated him out of money that was donated for his welfare. lost everything when his house burned down. Finally you puzzled over the last sentence is this part of the church minutes. What was the \"commitment\" of Seth Willis? You wondered if my grandfather was committed to an almshouse or whether the sentence merely meant that he was committed to the welfare of the church. Who knows? . Anyway from further reading of the church minutes, you learned that the church supported the charge against Metcalf and also charged him for being a liar. (77).\n\nYes, the Worthington church saw that Eli Metcalf did indeed cheat my grandfather. Reading further in those church records you found there was a second admonition by the church to Metalf over his keeping money that was supposed to go to Set Willis. Looks like that first admonition didn't do much good. Metcalf must not have been truly penitent. And this was still a hot topic for the church. They weren't about to forget it. But they did want to give Metcalf another chance to own up and repent. So they did the second admonition a month after the first. (78)\n\nYou'd think that Metcalf would have learned his lesson by then. But it's plain that he didn't. Even though he was given nine months in which to repent. So it was in the summer of 1790 when the church got together again. The minutes for June 24 showed that Metcalf hadn't yet satisfied the church for the offenses proved against him though he had been \"kindly and faithfully warned and admonished hor his Offences once and again\" The church then voted to have the pastor write up an act of Excommunication which was put before them on July 11. (79)\n\nI remember hearing a lot talk about that excommunication when I was about ten. I thought it served Metcalf right for the shameful way he cheated my grandfather. But you're wondering what happened next, after the ex-communication was delivered. There is nothing more about matter in the rest of 1790 church records. But the 1790 census told you that Seth Willis was living in Worthington with one female, probably his wife. My father, Amasa. Willis, is also listed on that census with two other males, both under 16, and three females. (80)\n\nNot long ago you learned of a sad sequel to the life of Seth Willis. You knew that his daughter, Silence, had married John Fenton at Worthington in 1776 and apparently moved some time after that to Rutland, Vermont. (81) (82) Misfortune and tragedy by fire seemed to follow Seth's daughter and son-in-law into Rutland, Vermont. On July 19th, 1799, John Fenton's barn was \"struck by the lightning, and consumed with a considerable quantity of hay.\" (83) But the most tragic event occurred in 1818 when John lost his life and Silence was seriously injured when their home was destroyed by fire as related in the following newspaper account: (84)\n\n\"From the Rutland Herald, of Wednesday, we copy the following melancholly event: - On Sunday morning, between the hours of 3 and 4 o'clock, the family of Mr. John Fenton, of this town, were awakened by the burning of flames in their dwelling - Unable to secure an article of clothing, they were compelled to buffet the wintry storm in a mere nightly attire. In this situation, Mrs. Fenton, a feeble lady of near 70, ran to her son's a distance of between 30 and 40 rods for assistance. In a similar attire, her son repaired to the scene of conflagration; but only to witness a spectacle more awful than the mere destruction of an earthly tenement. - Notwithstanding the first escape of the family from the house, and the almost hopeless prospect presented of preserving any thing from the devouring element, it seems Mr. F. thought it advisable to attempt the rescue of certain articles of property. He again entered: but not to return! Suffocated, as is supposed, by smoke, he was unable to extricate himself. The scanty assistance then present, and the want of knowledge as to what part of the house he was in, rendered it impossible to afford him relief. Indeed, human aid could not, probably, have preserved him. After the falling of the building, and the extinguishing of a part of the fire, his body was discovered on a remnant of the lower floor, though nearly consumed. Being found near the place where a window had been, it is conjectured that he attempted to escape through it; but that suffocation ensued ere he could raise the sash. Mr. F. was in his 69th year of age, and a man of unblemished character. His loss is deeply lamented. The fir is supposed to have originated from embers which were taken up in a wooden vessel the afternoon preceeding, and which were placed in a back part of the house. Another warning to persons to be cautious how they deposit their ashes. The hands and feet of the family, we understand, were frozen- the feet of Mrs. Fenton and of a young man who lived in the house severely. We are happy to learn that many donations have already been made to the sufferers. A charitable disposition which so pre-eminently characterizes the citizens of this town, we hope will continue to be manifest.\"\n\nThere were other changed in the family during that same general period. From the Worthington church records for October 31, 1790, you learned that my mother's parents, Hezekiah and Abigail Mahurin, were no longer in that community. From other records you found that they had moved to Middletown in Rutland county, Vermont, were Hezekiah apparently died about 1806. (85) (86)\n\nDuring those years my father's household was growing. So were my responsibilities as the oldest son. By 1790 I had two younger brothers, Lyman and Elijah, and three younger sisters; Meriam, Maria, and Silence. We were all still living in Worthington in 1797 when my father bought land there from Timothy Moeech. But four years later I left the nest when I married Freedom Dana. (87) (88) When you examined a number of land records, you figured out that Freedom and I moved from Worthington to nearby Chesterfield in 1803. (89) And when you read a history of the families of Chesterfield, you found that most of my children were born there. By 1803 I had three daughters - Abigail, Lucretia, and Silence. Poor little Silence died at the end of August of that year. My namesake son, Rufus, was born in 1806. Those were the four children we had by 1807 when Grandfather Seth died. (90)\n\nMy grandfather, Seth Willis was eighty-seven years old when he died on September 2, 1807. That was seventeen years after Eli Metcalf was ex-communicated for swindling him. His death was recorded in the Worthington church records but the history of the families of Chesterfield said that he died in that town. You had hoped that you might settle the location question when you visited Chesterfield in 1993 but that was not to be. You found that many of the tombstones in the old Ireland Street cemetery were missing and that over the years neighboring farmers had taken them to use for walkways or for construction. What a shameful thing to do with tombstones that families put up to remember their loved ones! (91)\n\nGoing back to the Worthington church records, you saw the following record that Eli Metcalf came back to the church five days after Seth Willis died and convinced them that he was finally repenting that he had cheated my grandfather. (92)\n\n\"Sept 7, 1807... Mr. Eli Metcalf made a public confession of the sins for which he was excommunicated many years ago, and was restored to his former standing in the church.\n\nSeventeen years of excommunication before he confessed! And then only after my grandfather had died. Do you wonder why it took him so long to repent? Did Grandfather's death have much to do with Metcalf's repentance? Was Metacalf really as penitent as the church thought he was. Did my grandfather ever forgive him? You'll never really know, will you? More mysteries.\n\nWhat do you think about a Congregational church excommunicating one of its members? Unusual? Ah, but you must remember that in my grandfather's time, the affairs of the Parish in Worthington were managed and conducted by the town in regular town meetings, acting in the double capacity of town and parish. The covenant members agreed that they would watch over their Brethern and that when any Brother was offended with anyone of the church he shall not complain until has laboured with the one he is offended with in a Gospel way. That means that before Newcomb Cleveland brought his complaint to the church, he must have tried to talk with Eli Metcalf about his shameful treatment of Seth Willis. (93)\n\nAs you read those old church minutes, you saw that church members admonished those who were not attending church. But some of the Worthington men were not easily intimidated by such admonitions. One of these was Timothy Meech whom my father knew well. He bought land from Timothy in 1797 and then sold land to him in 1806. (94) Meech joined the church in 1780 but did not attend. (95) He was an independent man and not at all impressed by the church's admonitions. That's evident from this description. (96)\n\n\"Apparently the members of the Brotherhood were a contentious lot and pretty independent... One such man was Timothy Meeck. At the meeting in February of 1782, a committee was chosen to admonish Brother Meeck for the first time, and in March they reported that in February they had called upon Meeck 'to inquire of the reasons of his absenting himself (from church) as he had not attended once since he had joined.' To which he replied:\n\n'No, nor I never intend to have any more concern with this church than I would with the Devil.'\n\n\"Either at this time or at another meeting with the committee he is reported to have said, 'And, by God, I'll say 'by God' whenever I want, by God.'\n\n\"In February, a year later, the church meeting voted that Meeck be rejected by the church and excluded all the privileges for withdrawing and absenting himself at sundry times when the Moderator had requested him to tarry and do business and for his 'Daring and presumptuous and extravagant talk and behaviour, and, after being properly admonished, for his obstinacy in refusing to make satisfaction for his disorderly walk.\"\n\nThat was Meech, all right. Not about to let church folks or anybody else tell him what to do or not to do. But in truth, what the Worthington church did with their admonishments and excommunications was mild compared to what some other Massachusetts churches and towns did in earlier times. You're read some accounts of worse practices. (97)\n\n\"Anyone who should dare to speculate too freely about the nature of Christ, or the philosophy of the plan of salvation, or to express a doubt as to the plenary inspiration of every word between the two covers of the Bible, was subject to fine and imprisonment. The tithing-man still arrested Sabbath-breakers and shut them up in the town-cage in the marketplace; he stopped all unnecessary riding or driving on Sunday, and hauled people off to the meeting-house whether they would or not.\"\n\nEli Metcalf's punishment was nothing compared to what he might have faced in a town with such a tithing master. Ah, some folks might have thought that he belonged in a town cage. But maybe he suffered enough from those seventeen years of excommunication. He was probably shunned and scorned by most of the people in Worthington. And in our own Chesterfield community, none of the Willises had much good to say about him.\n\nYou don't know what became of Seth Willis's wife, Silence. You do know from your examination of the 1810 census that she wasn't in my father's household where my two brothers, Elijah and Lyman, and two of my sisters were living. Nor was she in my household where Freedom and I were raising five children, all under ten. Abigail was eight years old, Lucretia was seven, Rufus Jr was five, Russell was four, and John was one. (98) (99)\n\nAfter 1810 Freedom and I had two more daughters. Silence was born in January, 1812, a few months before the second war with England broke out. We baptized her with the name \"Silence\" in memory of our little daughter of the same name who died in 1803. Then our youngest daughter, Wealthy, was born in December, 1813. It wasn't long after that when I started thinking about moving the family out to New York. I learned that a lot of land in western New York was being sold on easy terms which was about all that I could then afford. Well, we didn't have much but I decided it was too good an opportunity to pass up. (100) So my father and I packed up the families and moved in the winter of 1818 to Little Valley.\n\nWILLIS ANCESTORS IN NEW YORK\n\nLouis, you can't imagine how hard that ox-sled trip was when my father and I moved our families to New York. So here's a story about me that tells you something about what we faced making that trip and getting settled in what was then really just a wilderness:\n\n\"Rufus Wyllys settled on lot 30, 1819. He was born in Massachusetts, 1780, and moved from that State a distance of 500 miles, upon an ox-sled, being twenty-three days on the road. The sled carried the family of eleven persons and all their worldly effects. John Wyllys, a son, says their bread for much of the time was obtained by pounding corn on a block of wood. They would try and pound it fine enough to get out a little fine meal for a \"Johnny\" cake for breakfast, make the same for dinner, and the same for supper, if they found the cows. For a table, for several years, they used a slab split from a large cucumber log, (101) with four holes bored in the corners, into which logs were driven; and the only chairs were made in the same rude manner. \"Catamounts\" were used for bedsteads. At first they had to go to Fredonia to mill. Afterwards, Kent's Mill was built on the headwaters of the Connewango. Their usual mode of going to mill was with an ox team, drawing a crotch. Afterwards they dug a canoe from a pine log, and carried their grists in that on the Connewango. Mr. Wyllys and Samuel Farlee built a sawmill on Elm Creek in 1823. ........John Wyllys, a son, lives on lot 27, aged sixty-nine years, having lived in town fifty-nine years, and with one exception is the oldest resident of Connewango. In speaking of the customs of the pioneer times he says, \"It was against the rule of the neighborhood for any one to build a chimney until they had first burned out three logs of the house. (102)\n\nLife was wild and dangerous for us and for our few neighbors. During our first winter there, Sampson Crooker's wife had to use a pair of tongs to kill a wildcat that was invading her hen roost. Bears and wolves were always a problem. John Darling got trapped overnight by wolves one evening when he was out boiling maple sap (103)\n\nAll of us in that area struggled during those early years, but things gradually got better for our family after Sam and I built that sawmill. With a lot of hard work over many years, we eventually got to a place where we had a comfortable living. We weren't rich, not by a long shot. But far better than when we first came to New York.\n\nFrom census records you got an idea of who was on our farm in 1820. Freedom and I were raising Rufus Jr, Russell, John, Silence, Wealthy, Abigail, and Lucretia. And you saw that our neighbors included my brother, Lyman, Daniel Grover and Thomas Darling. Another neighbor was Cyrus Childs, who was the third man to settle in Connewango. His wife, Miriam, had been born in Worthington. (104) (105)\n\nAs our children grew up, most of them got married. Abigail married Daniel Grover's son, Lewis.. Alvin, the first of their twelve children, was born about 1829. Rufus Jr married Dorcas Darling in 1830, about the same time when Lucretia married John Seaman. Russell married Sarah Doolittle in 1834. By 1836 Wealthy and Hiram Seager were married. And by 1839 Rufus Jr. had moved his family to Ohio. In 1850 Lucretia's family was living in Michigan. Three years later, Rufus Jr had left Ohio and also moved to Michigan.\n\nThen it wasn't too many years until the Civil War broke out. Five of my grandsons were in that war. Four of them were Abigail Grover's children. In 1861 Gustavus Grover and Delos Grover both enlisted in Co. K, of the 64th New York Volunteers. Both got out in 1863. Gustavus's regiment was in the battles at Fair Oaks, Williamsburg, Second Bull Run, and Portsmouth. He was wounded and was then mustered out at a convalescent hospital in Virginia. (106) William Grover and Elisha Grover both went into artillery. William was in the Company A. 13th New York Heavy Artillery in 1864 and 1865. (107) Elisha was in Company G of the 7th Regiment , New York Heavy Artillery. The fifth grandson in the war was Russell's son, my namesake, Rufus T. Willis. He was 19 in August, 1864 in Company A, New York 13th Heavy Artillery Regiment and was mustered out ten months later at Norfolk, Virginia. (108).\n\nFreedom and I are proud of all our children. Our oldest ,Abigail, married Lewis Grover, a school teacher who was so large that a special chair had to be made for him. Four of their sons were soldiers in the Civil War. (109)\n\nLucretia married John Seaman and moved to Michigan where they had a farm. Rufus Jr and his wife, Dorcas Darling, also moved to Michigan and farmed. You did hear a tale that he got interested in the Mormon religion, left his family for a time and moved to Nauvoo where the Mormons wanted him to sign over his farm. The story goes that she refused, he gave up his Mormon beliefs, and returned to his family. Well, I'm not going to confirm or deny that story. So it's just one more thing for you to wonder about. (110) As for our other children, Wealthy Willis, married Hiram Seager. They lived near us in New York where they too farmed. John and Silence never married but they too remained in New York for the rest of their lives. Russell married Sarah Doolittle . Sometime between 1860 and 1870, they moved to Missouri where Russell died in 1879. (111)\n\nSarah moved back to New York where she lived in 1880 in a household with John and Silence, very close to the home where Hiram and Wealthy were living. . (112)\n\nRussell and Sarah's only daughter, Augusta, remained in New York where she had married Henry Ewing in 1855. Their oldest son, Frank (your grandfather), was born a year later. Let's talk about him. He was educated at Ellington Academy, studied for the bar with a lawyer in Dunkirk, New York, and was admitted to practice in 1878. (113)\n\nTwo years later he was a boarder in the household of his uncle, Edson Augustus Willis, at Clarion, Marion County, Kansas. (114) But then he decided his prospects might be better elsewhere, so he moved to Stillwater, Minnesota in 1881. Thee he married Lila Jenkins in 1883 and practiced law in Stillwater until 1888 when he moved his family to St. Paul, where he continued his career as a lawyer. His first two children were born in St. Paul, Gail Louise in 1889 and Earl in 1891. Then Lila died in 1894, leaving Frank as a young widowed father. That was when Henry and Augusta moved to St. Paul to help him care for the two little children. (115) They took Augusta's 82 year old mother, Sarah Willis, with them. That didn't turn out very well because Henry died of stomach cancer in August of that same year. A year later Frank had his mother, his grandmother, and his two brothers; Arthur and Sidney, living in his household. Earl and Louise were being cared for in the home of young woman, Carrie Lawson, living in the same neighborhood.. (116)\n\nIt must have been a terrible time for your grandfather. He married Julia Ewing two years later in Taylors Falls, where Julia, and her sister, Anna, were spending the summer. (117) (118)You have guessed that since they were both Methodists, they might have met in church.\n\nAbout a year later, Frank's grandmother, Sarah Willis, died in St. Paul. She is buried there in Oakland Cemetery. And since she is the your most recent of your Willis-named ancestors to die, this is where I shall end my talk with you. I have said enough. Now I will encourage you to continue trying to learn what you can from stories of your ancestors. And no matter how much you learn, there will always be more to discover.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBlodgett, Samuel - biographical information. www.williams.edu/library/\n\n>\n\nChaffin, Wm.

A John Willis was born in Chettle Parish, Dorsetshire, about 1600 or 1610. A John Willis, age 29, came to New England on the ship \"Paul\" which sailed from Gravesend London, England 3 Apr 1635, a claim also asserted by Warrington Willis, \"Certain Willises and Their Wives.\" and by the Dorchester Atheneum, ( http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=520) A John Willis has been said to have been certified by the minister of St. Kathrins \"nere to Tower of London,\" before sailing to New England. There is a church in London called \"Saint Katherine By the Tower.\" The church register shows the christening of a Johy Wyllis 4 Oct 1601, son of Richard Wyllis. (4) A John Willes was christened 23 May 1610 at St. Botolph Bishopsgate, son of Thomas Willes. (5) A John Willis was born in 1610 the son of Thomas Willis who was born in 1575 in Fenny Compton, Warwickshire, England.

Smith\", Amariah Dana, then 37 years old, was one of the \"Green Mountain Boys\" with Ethan Allen at the taking of Fort Ticonderoga on May 10, 1775, a year after the Boston Tea Party. Just how and when Amariah developed his relationship with Ethan Allen is not clear. But it may well have been related to Amariah's problems with the New Hampshire Grants. The \"Green Mountain Boys\" formed as a reaction to New York making grants of land already settled by other settlers who had received their land grants between 1749-1764, from New Hampshire's Governor Benning Wentworth who assumed that the Province of New Hampshire extended to a line drawn northward from the western boundaries of Connecticut and Massachusetts. (Sources - Chittenden, Lucius E. \"Annual Address Before the Vermont Historical Society Delivered at Montpelier, VT, Oct 8, 1872\" Rutland, Tuttle, & Co.) As one of the grantees, Amariah Dana probably found title of his land disputed - leading to Amariah eventually joining Ethan Allen's \"Green Mountain Boys\n\n37.
