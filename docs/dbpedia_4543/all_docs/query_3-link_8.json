Intelligence of his movements in the rural districts reached Toronto from time to time, but he sent no direct messages either to Rolph or Morrison, who, for some days, supposed that he was merely ascertaining the sentiments of the Radicals on the subject of the insurrection which he had so vehemently advocated. Erelong, however, intelligence of a most surprising nature reached their ears. They were informed that Mackenzie, Lount, Matthews, Fletcher, Gorham, Jesse Lloyd and others had had a secret meeting in the township of East Gwillimbury, at which an immediate rising had been resolved upon. It appeared that plans of more or less definiteness had been arranged, and that Thursday, the 7th of December, had been named as the time for taking possession of the capital and inaugurating a Provisional Government under the direction of Dr. Rolph. This astounding intelligence came to Rolph and Morrison from seven or eight different persons, all of whom had received it either directly or indirectly from Mackenzie himself, some by letter and some by personal communication. They were all persons who could be depended upon not to betray the plot, but [Pg 10] it was well-nigh inconceivable that Mackenzie should have communicated so momentous a secret to so many individuals before notifying the prospective head of the new Government himself, who had thus had no opportunity of expressing either approval or disapproval. It furnished one more example of Mackenzie's utter unfitness for any position in which discretion and judgment were needed.\n\nRolph and Morrison took counsel together. They felt that they were unsafe in the hands of so leaky a vessel as Mackenzie, who had evidently been so impressed by a sense of his own importance that he had been utterly incapable of keeping the secret, although he must have been conscious that upon the keeping of it the success of the movement, as well as the personal safety of those participating in it, might probably depend. They moreover learned that in the course of his peregrinations about the country he had made the most unwarrantable use of their names, and had most culpably misrepresented their views and sentiments. He had held them up to the Radicals as the real projectors of the movement, and as most anxious to place themselves at its head. There could be no doubt that their names had been a tower of strength to him in his machinations, and that he had used them without scruple, thereby inducing persons to acquiesce in the rising who would otherwise have held aloof from it. There could be equally little doubt that the mainspring of his action at this time was not patriotism, but a burning desire to revenge himself upon the Government. To this desire every other feeling had become subordinate, and he was prepared to risk the sacrifice of everything and everybody on the chance of attaining his end. Such were the deliberate, conclusions, at which Rolph and Morrison arrived, and they determined that they would work no longer with such an ally, unless, after becoming acquainted with all the facts, they should be of opinion that the rising was inevitable, and that it was likely to be conducted by cooler and wiser heads than Mackenzie's.\n\nDuring the third week in November Mackenzie reached Toronto from the north. Soon after nightfall he presented himself at Dr. Rolph's house, to whom he briefly communicated what had been done. Between four and five thousand men, he declared, would repair to Montgomery's tavern in small detachments during the early days of December, and [Pg 11] would place themselves under the command of Samuel Lount and Captain Anthony Anderson, of Lloydtown. The latter had had some military experience, and was a man of great courage and firmness. He had drilled hundreds of the farmers in North York into a state of comparative efficiency, and they would follow with confidence whithersoever he might choose to lead them. This was a subject of grave anxiety to Dr. Rolph. Owing to the want of preparation on the part of the Government, there seemed to be no likelihood of any actual conflict. Still, it was highly expedient that the revolutionary movements should be directed by some one of competent military knowledge and experience, who would know how to act in case of any unforeseen emergency. Mackenzie, in response to repeated and searching questions from Dr. Rolph, represented Anderson as being thoroughly competent to the military leadership. \"The men,\" said he, \"will follow his lead as if he were the Duke of Wellington.\" The insurgents were to be at Montgomery's[1] in full force on Thursday, the 7th, when they would march into the city, possess themselves of the arms at the City Hall, seize Head and his advisers, and proclaim a Provisional Government. The revolution would then be complete, and it was almost certain that all this might be accomplished without the loss of a single life. The people, so Mackenzie declared, were not only ready, but eager for the decisive moment to arrive. He fortified many of his statements by what seemed to be satisfactory evidence. For instance, he produced portentously long lists of signatures appended to a formal and distinct agreement to rise in arms against the Government.[2] He produced letters from several trusted Radicals, in which the state of public opinion in their respective neighbourhoods was reported upon in terms not to be mistaken. All that was asked of Dr. Rolph was that he would give the project his sanction, and that he would agree to accept the direction of the new Government.\n\nThe Doctor was thus led to regard the prospects of the impending revolution as decidedly hopeful. He however required time for consideration; [Pg 12] whereupon Mackenzie proceeded to the house of Dr. Morrison, whither he arrived about nine o'clock at night. Dr. Morrison did not receive him with as much complaisance as Dr. Rolph had done. Morrison considered that Mackenzie had abused his confidence, and did not fail to tell him so in good round terms. He informed him that he had assumed an authority which had never been conferred upon him; that in determining upon the rising, and more especially in fixing it for so early a day, he had acted rashly and without consideration. Mackenzie received the reproof with an ill grace. \"He appeared,\" says Dr. Morrison, [3] \"to be greatly agitated and exceedingly terse in his conversation with me, censuring me for not taking a more active part in the matter; whereupon I rejoined I had done all I could, and all that had been required of me in respect to it.\"\n\nIn the course of the same night Rolph and Morrison had a private consultation at the house of the former. Morrison keenly felt Mackenzie's remarks about lukewarmness in the cause of the people, and was prepared to go heart and soul into the enterprise if there was really a good prospect of success. Rolph considered that the prospect was at any rate sufficiently bright to justify them in taking a hand in the game. But they were both of opinion that a skilled military leader should be had, and that until this was effected they ought not to permit themselves to be regarded as finally committed to the project. They resolved to present this view of the case strongly to Mackenzie, and to cooperate with him in securing the services of such a leader as seemed to be called for by the nature of the enterprise and the magnitude of the interests involved.\n\nDuring an interview between Rolph and Mackenzie on the following day, the Doctor pressed this view of the matter very earnestly. Mackenzie, who was exceedingly anxious to secure the coöperation of Rolph and Morrison, and was comparatively indifferent as to mere matters of detail, readily gave in his acquiescence. In response to questions as to where an available person might be found, he stated that he could obtain the services of one of the most efficient and thoroughly trained officers in the country. This was Colonel Anthony G. W. G. Van Egmond, a native of Holland, who had formerly served under Napoleon Buonaparte, and [Pg 13] who is also said to have held a commission in the British service. [4] He had at this time been a resident of Canada for some years. His home was in the Huron Tract, of which he was the pioneer settler, and where he owned some thousands of acres of land. He held advanced opinions in political matters, and had unsuccessfully contested the representation of Huron with Captain Robert Graham Dunlop, the Tory candidate. His opposition to the Compact was such that he might safely be depended upon to enter into any project which held out a fair prospect of putting an end to their rule. He was somewhat advanced in life, having entered upon his sixty-seventh year; but he was hale and hearty, and as he had served with distinction under the most famous soldier the world has ever seen, there could be no reasonable doubt as to his military qualifications. It was arranged that Mackenzie should lose no time in communicating with him. This and other preliminary arrangements having been agreed upon, Drs. Rolph and Morrison appear [Pg 14] to have given in their assent to Mackenzie's proposal, though neither then nor at any other time was it understood that either of them was to take any part in directing the movements of the insurgents.\n\nAnd here it becomes necessary to deal with a series of misrepresentations deliberately and repeatedly made by Mackenzie, and echoed with great variety of circumlocution by numberless writers who have accepted his statements without investigation. In several published accounts of his exploits, he declares that the rebellion was due to the action of twelve leading Reformers, who met in Toronto \"one day in November,\" [5] and agreed to assemble a force on Yonge street, which was to advance upon and capture Toronto on the 7th of December. Mr. Lindsey, following this version of the story, says: \"There were about a dozen persons present when the decision was come to...The management of the enterprise was to be confided to Dr. Rolph as sole Executive, and the details were to be worked out by Mr. Mackenzie.\" [6] This presentment having been accepted as true by Mackenzie's biographer, has been followed by all subsequent writers who have dealt with the subject. As a consequence, the most erroneous ideas have been disseminated with reference to the inception of the movement, and as to the true reason of its failure. The simple fact of the matter is that there was no meeting of \"twelve leading Reformers\" in Toronto as stated by Mackenzie, nor was any meeting ever held in Toronto at which a scheme of rebellion was determined upon. [7] Neither the management of the enterprise nor the responsibility of an Executive was ever conferred upon or accepted by Dr. Rolph. It suited Mackenzie's purpose, after the collapse of the insurrection, to concoct several inconsistent and self-contradictory stories, with the design of removing the obloquy of failure from his own shoulders to those of others. He acted a most ignoble [Pg 15] part, and betrayed the confidence of every man who had trusted him. This would appear to have been done from a feeling of envy and disappointed ambition. In spite of all his protestations and prevarications, in spite of all his successive twistings and turnings, in spite of the narratives which he periodically gave to the world, the indubitable fact remains that Mackenzie and he only was the originator of the Upper Canadian rebellion. It was in his ill-balanced brain—inflamed by hatred of the Government by whose machinations he had been expelled and excluded from Parliament—that the seed of insurrection first germinated. It was by him that the project was first communicated to Lount, Lloyd, Matthews and others in the rural districts. It was by his urgency and stimulating arguments that the latter were induced to embark in it. It was by him that rebellion was first mooted at the secret caucus held at Doel's brewery in Toronto during the second week in October. It was by him that the scheme was afterwards submitted to Dr. Rolph and Dr. Morrison. It was owing to his representations that those gentlemen were induced to give a qualified assent to it. It was by him that the people were finally roused to take up arms, many of them being led to do so through his culpable misrepresentations of the attitude of Rolph and Morrison. It was in large measure due to his hot-headed incompetence and self-importance that the project proved a total and ignominious failure. Finally, it was to his disclosures that a vengeful Government were indebted for information which enabled them to successfully prosecute many persons who had been to a greater or less degree concerned in the rising, but who would have escaped the consequences of their complicity therein but for his published revelations. His conduct in this respect appears the more blameworthy, inasmuch as the sufferers had been led into rebellion by Mackenzie himself, who, at the time of his disclosures, had escaped from the Province, and was beyond the reach of its tribunals. While he was enjoying a safe asylum in the United States, and taking the whole world into his confidence with respect to the movement and the persons concerned in it, his victims filled the gaols of Upper Canada or suffered ignominious deaths upon the scaffold. No language is too strong to characterize his conduct at this crisis. If ever there was a case in which silence [Pg 16] would have been becoming—nay, in which silence was imperatively inculcated by all laws of honour and right feeling—that case was furnished by Mackenzie's circumstances after his escape from Upper Canada. Yet, instead of maintaining silence, he unbosomed himself to every stranger who would listen to him, and poured out oceans of ink in a vain endeavour to prove that he had acted the part of a wise man, while all those with whom he had been associated had acted the parts of poltroons or fools. This course of action would have been bad enough, even if he had kept to the truth. As remarked by Dr. Rolph [8]: \"Had the American Revolution in its infancy been conducted with these sorts of patriotic narratives after every reverse, criminating every one but Washington, and exposing in the first six months every secret friend and secret association in revolutionary operations, it would have effectually and speedily extinguished that spark of liberty which the wisdom, freedom and fidelity of our forefathers husbanded into a flame.\" Unfortunately, Mackenzie did not confine himself to truth, or to anything in the most distant degree resembling the truth. Whenever he had any purpose to serve he did not permit himself to be hampered by any squeamish considerations as to facts. In order to make proselytes he invented the most improbable stories. During his incessant journeyings hither and thither before the outbreak, he not only wilfully misrepresented the sentiments of leading Reformers, but he actually succeeded in convincing a number of people that Chief Justice Robinson and his brothers were cognizant of the contemplated Rebellion, and that they secretly favoured it. He repeated the same absurd story, both orally and in print, [9] long after the enterprise had collapsed, and when so outrageous a falsehood could deceive nobody except the people of the United States, who knew nothing of the facts. A sensible man would have accepted defeat and made the best of it; but Mackenzie had no sooner set foot on [Pg 17] United States soil than he appeared to lose what little judgment he had ever possessed. He allied himself with the very lowest class of border ruffians, many of whom were so imposed upon by his representations that they banded themselves together to invade Canada, and to harass the peaceable citizens along the frontier. When he found that even these persons were beginning to fathom the pettiness and malignity of his motives, he began to pour out his various narratives, in which he did what he could to throw the blame of failure upon his several collaborateurs, and to exalt himself into something resembling a hero. All the other chief participants in the revolt maintained silence, and determined to let the dead, irrevocable past alone. Thus it came about that Mackenzie's own narratives have hitherto furnished almost the sole groundwork for the most important passages in the history of the Upper Canadian Rebellion.\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, the 24th of November, Mackenzie once more left Toronto for the north. It had been resolved that he should notify as many of the different unions as possible of the intended movement, and that he should make final arrangements for the assembling of not fewer than two thousand persons at Montgomery's, all of whom were to reach there between six and ten o'clock in the evening of the 7th of December. The insurgents, having mustered in force, were then to advance upon the city and proceed diect to the City Hall, where they were to be joined by Rolph, Morrison, and such other of the Toronto Radicals as should meanwhile have been intrusted with the secret. The arms in the City Hall having been secured, Head and his advisers were to be seized and held in durance. Dr. Rolph was then to be called upon to assume the direction of the Civil Government. Morrison and other leading Radicals were to give in their adhesion, after which there could be no doubt of the coöperation of the great bulk of the city's population. It was believed that a permanent military occupation would be wholly unnecessary, as, when once the sceptre should have passed away from the hands of Sir Francis Head, a very small proportion of the people would be ready to take up arms to restore him to power. Rolph and Morrison were meanwhile to hold themselves in readiness to carry out their share [Pg 18] of this programme. It was understood between them and Mackenzie that they were to communicate the project to such of the Toronto Radicals as they might deem safe, but that no active cooperation was to be expected from them until the insurgents should have actually entered the city in force. Rolph's assumption of the direction of affairs was to be in response to a demand from the insurgents themselves, after they should have possessed themselves of the insignia of office. Mackenzie's assertion that the \"Executive in the City\" was, to \"join the army at Montgomery's\"[10] is a clumsy falsehood, invented by him for the purpose of self-exoneration, and contradicted by all the facts and circumstances of the case, independently of the assertions of Rolph and Morrison.\n\nFrom the time of setting out northward on the 24th, Mackenzie appears to have conducted himself with greater indiscretion than ever. He was full to overflowing of the momentous project, and brimmed over whenever he found an opportunity for so doing. His first stopping-place was the house of a Radical farmer near Hogg's Hollow, on Yonge Street, about six miles north of Toronto, where he remained all night. He had supplied himself with some type, paper, and a small printing-press, by means of which he was enabled to strike off and distribute a handbill in which the \"brave Canadians\" were adjured to get ready their rifles, and \"make short work of it.\" \"A connection with England,\" it ran, \"would involve us in all her wars, undertaken for her own advantage, never for ours; with governors from England we will have bribery at elections, corruption, villainy and perpetual discord in every township, but independence would give us the means of enjoying many blessings. Our enemies in Toronto are in terror and dismay; they know their wickedness and dread our vengeance.\" Before leaving the neighbourhood of Hogg's Hollow on Saturday morning he divulged the plan of the intended rising to at least two persons, one of whom [11] was friendly to the Government, and lost no time in communicating the news to Sir Francis Head. As [Pg 19] it happened, the revelation did little or no harm to the insurgents, for the Lieutenant-Governor and his Councillors refused to believe that there was anything in the story, which they persisted in regarding as one more exhibition of Mackenzie's malignant imbecility.\n\nFrom Hogg's Hollow Mackenzie proceeded northward to the house of David Gibson, which, as previously mentioned, was near the present village of Willowdale.[12] Gibson was still unaware of the intention to rise on the 7th of December, and Mackenzie, with his usual inconsistency, abstained from acquainting him with it.[13] This reticence, as Mackenzie afterwards alleged, was due to the fact that Gibson was a member of the Provincial Parliament, and that it was only fair to him that he should be left in ignorance as long as possible. There was no doubt as to Gibson's cordial acquiescence and cooperation when once the outbreak should have begun, but Mackenzie deemed it advisable that he should be left in the dark until the insurgents should be actually in arms.\n\nFrom Gibson's Mackenzie proceeded to the township of King, where, in conjunction with Lount, Fletcher, Anderson and others, he set himself to prepare his adherents for the coming enterprise. It would be as difficult as it is wholly unnecessary to trace his operations in detail. He moved about with his customary energy, and was well seconded by his rural coadjutors. Silas Fletcher acted as a medium of communication between Mackenzie and Rolph, and was twice in Toronto during the eight or nine days preceding the outbreak. Dr. Rolph learned, through him, that Colonel Van Egmond had consented to lead the insurgents into the city, [Pg 20] and that he would be at Montgomery's for that purpose in the forenoon of the 7th. Rolph and Morrison still continued to keep the most important details of the plot locked in their own breasts, though a number of persons in the city were so far taken into confidence that they were made aware of the fact that an early subversion of the Government was in contemplation. And so the last days of November glided quietly by.\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XIX.\n\nI have taken the responsibility of stating, in the text, that no meeting of twelve leading Reformers was ever held in Toronto at which a scheme of rebellion was agreed upon, and that neither the management of the enterprise nor the responsibility of an Executive was ever conferred upon, or accepted by, Dr. Rolph. As these statements go to the root of the whole story of the Rebellion, and as they are in direct contradiction to Mackenzie's account, upon which all others have been founded, it is incumbent upon me to adduce satisfactory evidence of the truth of my assertions. This I now proceed to do. In the first place the story which has hitherto obtained currency rests upon the sole and unsupported word of Mackenzie himself, to which no one who knew him would attach much importance. To any one familiar with his peculiar style of writing, the bald manner in which the statement is made is in itself sufficient to awaken doubt. If such an important meeting was held, how is it that we have no particulars of the proceedings from Mackenzie's pen, more especially as he gives a very full account of the infinitely less important meeting which took place at Doel's brewery during the second week in October? See Lindsey's Life of Mackenzie, vol. ii., pp. 53—56. He would have been certain to preserve very full notes of such an event, and would have rushed into print with them upon every conceivable opportunity. Yet, in his Narrative, the whole matter is disposed of in one brief, bald paragraph which bears the clearest evidence of his powers of invention. He even abstains from saying, in so many words, that the meeting was held in Toronto, though the context plainly shows that he intended his readers to believe so. See his Narrative, as above quoted, p. 8; and Lindsey's account, founded upon it, in Life of Mackenzie, vol. ii., pp. 56, 57. But it is not necessary to resort to arguments founded upon conjecture, however plausible. Who were these \"twelve leading Reformers\"? If they belonged to Toronto, they must certainly have included Dr. Rolph, Dr. Morrison, M. S. Bidwell, the two Baldwins, James Hervey Price, the two Lesslies, and the Armstrongs, as well as Mackenzie himself. Yet of all these, Mackenzie, so far as appears, is the only one who ever heard of the meeting, or of the appointment of an Executive, until the appearance of Mackenzie's Narrative. Doctor Rolph never alluded to the matter without giving the most vehement denial to both statements. The denial is constantly reiterated in his correspondence, and some of the most cogent arguments in his Review of Mackenzie's Publications are founded upon such a denial. So much, then, for Dr. Rolph. What about Dr. Morrison? The following is a copy of a written statement made by him about ten years subsequent to the Rebellion. It has never hitherto been published, and merits a careful perusal. It is an unstudied document, and its syntax is in some places very defective, but it bears the impress of sincerity and truthfulness in every line. As will be seen, it not only negatives the story about the meeting of \"twelve leading Reformers\" and the appointment of an Executive, but also confirms many other statements contained in the text.\n\nDR. MORRISON'S STATEMENT.\n\n\"About the middle of October, 1837, Mr. Mackenzie urged on myself, and told me he had conversed with Dr. Rolph, that the troops having all left for Lower Canada, and the Lower [Pg 21] Canadians being about to make a revolutionary move, we (meaning the Upper Canadians) were bound to do so also, and that a messenger ought to be immediately sent to Lower Canada in order that a mutual understanding might exist between the Reformers of both Provinces in the matter, and pressed it upon me very earnestly that I should be that messenger, against which I remonstrated, declining from prudential motives engaging in it. Some short time after he came to me again, and informed me he had prevailed on Mr. Jesse Lloyd, of Lloydtown, in the Township of King, to go, and said he could give him letters to Papineau, T. S. Brown, of Montreal, and others, and wished me to write also to introduce Mr. Lloyd as a person confided in by the Reformers. I accordingly gave him a simple letter of introduction to Dr. O'Callaghan, editor of the late Montreal Vindicator.\n\n\"Mr. Lloyd proceeded to Montreal, and in a short time returned, bringing no letters for any one except Mr. Mackenzie, who professed to have received only one, and that was from Mr. Brown, and which he showed to Dr. Rolph and myself at Dr. Rolph's, in presence of Mr. Lloyd. It seemed to be merely a letter on business, alluding to some particular time when he might correspond with him again. This, Mackenzie said, was the subject agreed upon between them as a signal, if he coincided with his views on a revolutionary movement, and Mr. Lloyd stated the Lower Canadians were all ready and prepared, and stated so soon as the ice began to float in the river opposite Montreal, they intended to cross over and entrench themselves in some part of the country adjacent, but wished us, the Reformers of Upper Canada, to make the first move, giving them notice of the time when we should do so, and that they would second us; whereupon Mr. Mackenzie, Dr. Rolph and myself agreed to meet at my house that evening to take the matter into serious consideration. On the same evening Dr. Rolph, Mackenzie and myself met as agreed upon, and we discussed the propriety of an immediate revolution or any at all. Dr. Rolph and myself having much doubt as to whether the people were desirous of it, or would engage in it, Mr. Mackenzie strenuously opposed our views, by insisting that the people desired it, and that forthwith. And as a proof that they were, he assured us he had received lists, signed by some thousands, for the avowed purpose, and upbraided us very vehemently for forsaking the people if we did not go with them in their wishes, which were to depose the Government and establish one of their own, and especially under so favourable a crisis, there being no troops left in the garrison. We therefore consented that he might proceed into the country, and consult with the different political unions on this important subject, and bring it to their decision, and if they were for a revolution, and willing to effect it; and when he had done so to inform us of the result. And we then also laid down a plan by which we might take possession of the arms, and put into custody the different officers of Government, establish a Provisional Government, and, if possible, by such a plot achieve a bloodless victory over the enemies of Canada.\n\n\"It was then perfectly understood by Dr. Rolph and myself that the whole sanction we then gave to Mackenzie was to make the foregoing investigation, and to which he agreed, provided we would allow him to make use of Dr. Rolph's and my own name to the people in his communications with them relative to his mission. To this we consented, on the principle that we wished to accomplish nothing but what the people were desirous of doing themselves. If they voluntarily desired to effect a revolution we would give them our countenance. In this sense and no other was Mackenzie authorized to mention our names.\n\n\"Mackenzie then left the house, Dr. R. and myself remaining. When in conversation together Dr. R. observed that he would call on Mackenzie and get him to point out on his lists such persons as he thought would be suited to execute such an undertaking, and get them to meet together and enter into two resolutions, one expressive of a determination to effect the independence of the Province, and another to unite to do so by physical force. These were to be entered into without recording them.\n\n\"While Dr. R., Mackenzie and myself were discussing these points together, I did not understand that any wish was expressed or understood that either Dr. R. or myself were to have [Pg 22] any command over the forces of the insurgents. In fact, it was always a source of regret to us that individuals fit for it were not among us, although it was often insisted upon by Messrs. Lloyd and Mackenzie that they were to be met with among the people north of the Ridges. Never at any time in the course of these conversations was it even hinted that such services were expected of us; and during the interview above alluded to Dr. Rolph and myself repeatedly and peremptorily laid down the injunction that private property was to be respected, and that we considered all moneys in the banks, not actually belonging to the Government, as private property....No appointment of an Executive Committee was made; neither were any powers delegated to Dr. Rolph or to Mackenzie or any other than those before stated, nor am I aware that there was any meeting early in November of twelve leading Reformers of the city, appointing an Executive Committee, of which Dr. Rolph was one, or in any way deliberating on the subject. If there had been such a meeting, no doubt I would have known it, conferring either on Dr. Rolph the powers of an Executive or on Mackenzie the details, arrangement or whole management of revolutionary movements.\n\n\"I saw nothing again of Mr. Mackenzie till about the Wednesday week before the outbreak, when he called at my house between eight and nine at night, or maybe a little later. I had casually heard before from various persons, to whom by some means the intelligence must have come through Mackenzie, of the intended outbreak and the time fixed upon, and was greatly surprised, as at the primary interview already spoken of at my house, Mr. Mackenzie especially, as well as Dr. Rolph and myself, entered into the strictest assurances to each other of secrecy and confidentiality. Mackenzie then informed me for the first time that he had appointed Thursday, the 7th December, for the rising, without entering into any details or further particulars. I then told him that it was not intended that he should take upon himself any such authority, and was very fearful he had been premature. I enquired if he had acquainted Dr. Rolph with this, and what was his remark. He replied that he had, and that Dr. Rolph had made no objections. He appeared to be greatly agitated, and exceedingly terse in his conversation with me, censuring me for not taking a more active part in the matter; whereupon I rejoined I had done all that I could, and all that was required of me in respect to it.\n\n\"(Signed) T. D. MORRISON.\n\n\"As to Fletcher, when I heard of the assemblage on Yonge Street, I was convinced in my own mind that it would prove a failure, and was glad of the opportunity of making Fletcher the medium of my advice, which was that they should disperse at once. I then sent Fletcher to Dr. Rolph, who gave him a similar advice with myself, and sent him up Yonge Street to the multitude.\"[14]\n\nIt is thus sufficiently clear that neither Rolph nor Morrison had any knowledge of the meeting of twelve leading Reformers, or of the appointment of an Executive. Mr. Bidwell's ignorance of the whole enterprise has been made sufficiently clear on a former page. See vol. i., pp. 362, 363, note. From Robert Baldwin's own testimony we know that he was equally ignorant. See his evidence as given before the Committee on Privileges, and printed in the Appendix to the Journal of Assembly for 1837-'8, p. 406. Dr. Baldwin was informed of the impending insurrection, but not until after the actual arrival of the rebels at Montgomery's, and it is clear that he knew nothing about any meeting of Reformers or appointment of an Executive. See Appendix, as above. James Hervey Price, John Armstrong, Robert McKay, and John Elliott were all examined in open court on the trial of Dr. Morrison for high treason at Toronto, on Wednesday, the 24th of April, 1838. They were all leading Reformers, and must have known if any such important steps had been taken as [Pg 23] alleged by Mackenzie. Yet they all emphatically denied upon oath any knowledge of either the meeting or the appointment. Mr. Price \"never heard of the existence of an Executive Committee until he read Mackenzie's narrative,\" and solemnly disavowed ever hearing of it before. See p. 18 of the pamphlet giving an account of the trial. Armstrong testified that he knew nothing of an Executive Committee to cooperate with Mackenzie. Ib., p. 3. McKay stated that he did not believe there ever was an Executive Committee in Toronto, such as stated by Mackenzie in his narrative. Ib., p. 3. Elliott testified that he had no knowledge of any Executive Committee to correspond with Mackenzie, or to coöperate with him in the Rebellion. Ib., p. 3. James Lesslie assured me a short time before his death that the story about twelve leading Reformers was a clear invention of Mackenzie's. He added that the Rebellion was first conceived by Mackenzie, who by his persuasions obtained the cooperation of Lount, Matthews, Lloyd and others, as stated in the foregoing pages. David Gibson's oral and written communications abound with evidence that he never heard of either meeting or appointment, and that he regarded both as inventions of Mackenzie. In a letter written by him, and now lying before me, are the following words: \"I am not aware of any Executive Committee having existed—never heard of their appointment by any body of Reformers—never was at any meeting of the kind for such an appointment, nor ever heard of such Executive Committee from Mr. Mackenzie until I met him in the State of New York.\" Mr. Gibson adds that Mackenzie, while in John Montgomery's house in Rochester, after the latter's escape from Upper Canada, prepared with his own hand a statement which he induced William Alves to sign, and which he afterwards published on pp. 100-102 of the Caroline Almanac. In this statement Dr. Rolph is referred to as \"our own Executive,\" but the phrase—indeed the sntire narrative—is Mackenzie's, and not Alves's, although the latter was induced to append his name. The authenticity of Silas Fletcher's letter, in which Rolph is also referred to as the Executive, is dealt with at full length in a note to p. 34, post, to which note the reader may refer if he deems it worth while. But further testimony is surely unnecessary. It is plain that the idea of the Rebellion was originally the work of Mackenzie; that he won over Lount, Matthews, Lloyd and several others in the rural districts; and that the plan, so far as there was any plan, was arranged by them without any conference with the Radicals in Toronto, who were only made aware of it after the day of rising had been fixed upon.\n\n[Pg 24]\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nSIR FRANCIS DOES NOT APPREHEND A REBELLION.\n\nTop\n\nM eanwhile, in spite of repeated warnings, the Government continued to rest in undisturbed confidence. Anyone who ventured to hint to them that Mackenzie's agitation had at last produced fruit, and that a good many people in the Home District were ripe for revolt, was laughed at and ridiculed for his pains. Nothing could rouse them from their fatuity. All through the autumn they received regular intelligence of the secret drillings, of the manufacture of pikes, and of other seditious proceedings on the part of the Radicals throughout the Home and Gore Districts. But all was to no purpose. \"If a prophet had risen from the dead,\" wrote Charles Fothergill, [15] a few weeks later, \"his admonitions would have been ineffectual.\" They persisted in regarding all the preparations as being merely for effect, and to intimidate the Government. Colonel Fitz Gibbon, whose superabundant loyalty prompted him to be ever on the alert, appears to have obtained early intelligence of the intention to rise in arms. It will be remembered that he had long before begun to make preparations for such a contingency. [16] He had from time to time bored Sir Francis Head and other members of the Government on the subject, and his incessant importunities had led to his being regarded in the light of an alarmist. As for Sir Francis himself, he felt as secure as though he had had ten thousand armed veterans at his back. When Sir John Colborne had applied to him to know how many of the Upper Canadian troops he could spare for service in the Lower Province, he had promptly and unhesitatingly replied \"All,\" and all had been sent. Not only the capital, but the whole of the Province was thus left [Pg 25] defenceless. The last troops sent out of the Upper Province for service in Lower Canada were withdrawn from Penetanguishene in November. They consisted of a subaltern officer and thirty men. When they were on their way from Penetanguishene to Toronto, Colonel Fitz Gibbon urged the Lieutenant-Governor to keep them in the city, in order that their presence might have an effect upon the local militia. \"No, not a man;\" answered his Excellency—\"the doing so would destroy the whole morale of my policy. If the militia cannot defend the Province, the sooner it is lost the better.\" \"Then, sir\" entreated the Colonel, \"let us be armed, and ready to defend ourselves.\" \"No,\" responded Sir Francis \"I do not apprehend a rebellion in Upper Canada. \" [17]\n\nRemonstrances from other quarters were met in a similar spirit. The Government appeared to have been smitten with a most unaccountable blindness, and could not be made to understand that there was any cause for either alarm or preparation. They took no steps to guard the arms in the City Hall, which, as previously mentioned, had been committed to the charge of the municipal authorities, who had appointed two constables to watch over them at nights. There was absolutely nothing to prevent the seizure of these arms by a handful of determined men. Colonel Fitz Gibbon was apprehensive lest the rebels should come into the city separately, so as to attract no attention, and conceal themselves in the houses of Radical citizens until they should be in sufficient force; when, at a given signal, they might rush to the City Hall at midnight, and gain easy possession of the temporary arsenal. To guard against such a possibility he induced his rifle corps, whom he continued to drill with vigilant regularity, to volunteer a nightly guard of fifteen or twenty men to watch the City Hall, and to furnish two sentries to guard the approaches to Government House. Having brought matters to this pass, he presented himself before Sir Francis to gain the requisite permission, which, to the Colonel's chagrin, was refused. \"But that I do not like to undo what I have already done,\" remarked his Excellency, \"I would have those arms brought from the City Hall and placed here in the Government House, under the care and keeping of my own domestics.\" [18]\n\n[Pg 26]\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor seemed to believe that he was hedged by a sort of divinity, and he lived in a Fool's Paradise of over-confidence until the rebels were veritably at his gates.\n\nWhen the crisis was over, it suited Sir Francis Head to represent himself as having long anticipated the Upper Canadian Rebellion, [19] and as being fully prepared for it by reason of his unbounded confidence in the loyalty of the great bulk of the people. He even went so far as to record that he had purposely ignored all the preparations of the rebels, in order that they might be led on to commit some overt act which would enable him to strike them with greater effect. \"I considered,\" he wrote \"that if an attack by the rebels was inevitable, the more I encouraged them to consider me defenceless the better.\" [20] Again: \"I felt that, instead of either trying to conciliate Mr. Mackenzie, or make his fortune by a Government prosecution, I had better let him come within the reach of the law, and then let it hang him.\" [21] He does not seem to have been conscious that in so writing he was doing his utmost to brand himself with infamy. If he had really encouraged men to rebel in order that he might have an excuse for hanging them, he would have been one of the basest of mankind. But it is clear that this idea was a mere afterthought, adopted and placed on record for the purpose of conveying the impression that he was a shrewd and far-seeing man. [Pg 27] [22] That he was kept well-informed respecting the preparations of the rebels is quite true. It is also true that he forebore to prosecute Mackenzie for treasonable articles in the Constitution, and that he did so for the deliberate purpose of thereby leading the editor to publish something so grossly treasonable that it could not be ignored. [23] But, so far as the actual outbreak was concerned, he and his Councillors were taken completely by surprise. They did not \"apprehend a rebellion in Upper Canada.\" They did not for a moment believe that any practical results were to follow the drilling and other preparations, and they greatly underestimated the number of the disaffected. That any deliberate attempt would be made to capture the city and overturn the Government seemed too utterly absurd to be gravely discussed.\n\nTowards the end of November news reached Toronto of the repulse of Colonel Gore by the Lower Canadian rebels under Dr. Wolfred Nelson. This could not fail to have an inspiriting effect upon the disaffected in Upper Canada. Colonel Fitz Gibbon was keenly alive to this fact, and relaxed none of his vigilance. He felt certain that an outbreak was imminent, and took such precautions against a surprise as were within his power. He prepared a list of those persons living west of Yonge Street, and within the city limits, upon whom he felt that he could depend for assistance in case of a revolt. This list he submitted to the Lieutenant-Governor, stating that it was his intention to call personally upon each of the men, and to warn them to keep their arms loaded and ready to hand, so as to be constantly prepared to repel an attack. His plan was that the Mayor, Mr. Gurnett, should prepare a list of the loyal men residing in that portion of the city lying east of Yonge Street, who should receive a similar warning. Arrangements were to be made for the ringing of the bell of Upper Canada College at any hour of either day or night whenever an outbreak should take place.\n\n[Pg 28]\n\nThis was to be the signal for the ringing of other bells, throughout the city. Upon hearing the sound, every man west of Yonge Street was to seize his arms and run to Parliament House; while the men east of Yonge Street were to repair to the City Hall. \"For the doing of this,\" remarked Colonel Fitz Gibbon, \"I desire to have your Excellency's sanction; but permit me to tell your Excellency that whether you give me leave or not I am determined to do it. I say so with all respect to your Excellency as the representative of my Sovereign. You are so convinced that we are in no danger that you will take no measure of precaution; but I, being fully convinced that the danger is most imminent, am determined to take every measure in my power to devise for the protection of my family and friends.\" [24] Sir Francis gave a sort of reluctant sanction to the plan, and the Colonel proceeded to the City Hall and communicated it to the Mayor. That functionary had heard various rumours of an impending insurrection, and had been urged by several members of the Council, as well as by other citizens, to take some precautions for the public safety; but up to this time he had not been disposed to attach much weight to the rumours, or to encourage what he regarded as a spirit of timorousness on the part of the inhabitants. In any case he would do nothing at the instigation of Colonel Fitz Gibbon, whose conduct he regarded as a piece of officious interference. He accordingly warned no one, and gave no instructions as to the ringing of bells. The Colonel himself, before the day closed, started on his rounds from house to house to warn the trusted loyalists west of Yonge Street. He got very little thanks for his pains from the loyalists themselves. They regarded him as a well-meaning but troublesome fanatic, who had pondered so much on the wickedness of the Radicals that he had become a monomaniac on the subject. Some of them believed that his exuberant zeal ought to be checked by the authorities, lest he should create unnecessary alarm in the public mind. Among the names on his list was that of Chief Justice Robinson. Calling at the latter's abode, he was shown into the library, where he received an unmistakable snub. \"I cannot partake of your apprehensions,\" said the Chief Justice, \"and I am sorry to see you alarming the people in this way.\" [25] In deference to the Chief Justice's wishes, the Colonel agreed to [Pg 29] warn the heads of families only, in order that the young men might not be thrown into a state of unnecessary excitement. There were a hundred and twenty-six names on his list, and he continued to leave his warnings at house after house from day to day, but the Rebellion broke out before his self-appointed task had been half accomplished.\n\nThe Constitution meanwhile continued to appear with regularity, [26] but its tone was not perceptibly worse than it had been for the past twelvemonth, and there was no additional ground known for instituting proceedings against its editor. On the 29th of November a document purporting to be a draft of a constitution, intended to be submitted to the proposed Reform Convention, appeared in its columns; but, like everything else from the same source, it was regarded as a mere ebullition of Mackenzie's teeming fancy, and not worth serious consideration from men of sober minds. Mackenzie, however, had by this time succeeded in widely disseminating his handbill, and in causing most of the disaffected in the Home District to be notified of the contemplated rising on the 7th of December. The feeling throughout some of the townships was so restless that it could not be concealed. The local supporters of the Government in these places could not shut their eyes to what was going on about them. They felt certain that the Radicals were preparing for an early attempt against the established order of things, and they lost no time in communicating their convictions to the Government. Several copies of the handbill were laid hold of and forwarded to headquarters. James Hogg, who had been informed by Mackenzie of the actual day of the intended outbreak, [27] had ridden into town and acquainted Sir Francis Head therewith, but as he admitted that Mackenzie had been his informant no weight whatever had been attached by the Lieutenant-Governor to his communication. Intelligence was now brought into the city at almost every hour of the day from Pickering, King, East Gwillimbury, Markham and elsewhere, to the effect that mischief was in the air, and that Upper Canada was on the [Pg 30] verge of troublous times. The warnings continued to arrive in such numbers that they could no longer be absolutely ignored, more especially as many of the inhabitants of the city were beginning to share in the belief that there was something of a very unusual nature in the atmosphere, and to urge upon various dignitaries that some steps ought to be taken for the protection of the city. Accordingly, on Friday, the 1st of December, a meeting of the Executive Council was held. There were various matters requiring consideration, and after a session of several hours an adjournment took place until the morrow. The adjourned meeting on the following day does not appear to have been a formal or official meeting of the Council, as it was not confined to members of that body. It was attended by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Hon. William Allan, the Hon. R. B. Sullivan, Chief Justice Robinson, Judge Jones, Attorney-General Hagerman, Solicitor-General Draper, and Allan MacNab, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. The probability of a Radical revolt against the Government was discussed at considerable length. The only person who took no part in the discussion was Mr. Allan. All the rest were clearly of opinion that the idea of a revolt was too absurd to occupy their attention. Attorney-General Hagerman declared his firm conviction, as he had done many a time before during the past few months, that not fifty people in the Province could be got to take arms against the Government. This sentiment was echoed all round the table, except by Mr. Allan, who, so far as then appeared, had no opinion whatever on the subject. While the matter was thus being disposed of, Colonel Fitz Gibbon's name was announced, and a moment later he was admitted into the Council Chamber, hot and breathless with haste and excitement. He reported certain information which had just reached his ears. A magistrate from one of the northern townships had a few minutes before called upon him and acquainted him with the nature of the preparations for rebellion in the rural districts. It appeared that a blacksmith whose forge was not far from the magistrate's house had for some time past been engaged in the manufacture of pike heads; that this had been done secretly, no persons except trusted Radicals being admitted to the shop; that other persons in the same neighbourhood had been engaged day and night in the manufacture of [Pg 31] hickory handles, and that when questioned on the subject they had represented these as being intended for handles for hay-rakes and pitchforks. Drilling was practised nightly, and everything pointed to the conclusion that the public peace would erelong be seriously disturbed. This was certainly important news, but the Colonel's proclivities for scenting out rebellion were so well known, and he was moreover in such a state of excitement, that his account of the matter was accepted at a very large discount. These repositories of official wisdom could not or would not credit the possibility of rebellion. It seemed as if nothing could rouse them to a true sense of their position. Some of them could not forbear from actual rudeness to the Colonel when he expressed himself as to the state of matters in the northern part of the Home District. \"You do not mean to say,\" queried Judge Jones, turning towards him with a scarcely repressed sneer in his voice and tone, \"that these people are going to rebel?\" \"Most distinctly I do,\" responded Colonel Fitz Gibbon; upon which the Judge turned towards the Lieutenant-Governor, and in a contemptuous tone exclaimed, \"Pugh, pugh!\" [28] But the Colonel was not to be flouted out of his convictions, and continued to state them with a vigour and an earnestness which at least proved his perfect sincerity. He urged that his informant should be questioned in person by the gentlemen present. After some deliberation it was determined to adopt this course. The magistrate, being close at hand, was sent for, and upon his arrival he was examined by the Lieutenant-Governor and the Attorney-General in an adjacent room. Upon the return of the inquisitors to the Council Chamber, the Attorney-General remarked: \"The statement made to us by Mr.____ does not make half the impression upon one's mind as was made by Colonel Fitz Gibbon's statement: the information he brings us at third or fourth hand.\" Mr. Allan, who up to this time had maintained silence, now spoke out. \"What would you have, gentlemen?\" he asked—\"Do you expect the rebels will come and give information at first hand? How can you expect such information but at second, third or fourth hand? I am as long in the country as most of you, gentlemen. I know [Pg 32] the people of this country as well as most of you, and I agree in every word spoken here to-day by Colonel Fitz Gibbon, and think that an hour should not be lost without preparing ourselves for defence.\" [29] These plain words of common sense produced their effect, but the others surrendered their opinions with an ill grace, and as though deferring to a spirit which should be checked rather than encouraged. Sir Francis himself sided with the quietists, and for a time it seemed as though no steps whatever would be taken for the defence of the city. While the discussion was at its height Colonel Fitz Gibbon urged the immediate putting into the garrison of all the half-pay officers and discharged soldiers who could be found in and around the city. To this Sir Francis objected. \"What,\" he enquired, \"will the people of England say, if they hear that we are thus arming? And besides, it will offend the militia if we pass them by and employ the military.\" The Colonel very emphatically expressed his opinion to the contrary, adding that the militia would be glad of an opportunity to rally round the regular military as a nucleus. At last, after several hours' conference, his Excellency said: \"My opinions are unchanged. I hold that there is no danger whatever; but if, as I am informed, the magistrates and principal inhabitants of the city are apprehensive of danger, let them address me to that effect. I will tell them that I entertain no fears for the public peace; but to allay theirs, and in compliance with their solicitations, I will order measures of precaution to be taken.\" [30] At this very moment, [Pg 33] the Mayor, who had at last become awake to the possibility of danger, was waiting in the next room to have an interview with his Excellency on the subject. [31]\n\nThe result of the day's deliberations was that the Government resolved upon the arrest of Mackenzie and the organization of two regiments of militia. It was also deemed prudent to place the fort in charge of a body of militia, and to invest Colonel Fitz Gibbon with the authority of Adjutant-General. [32] There was however no undue haste in the carrying out of these arrangements, and the Colonel was not made acquainted with his accession of dignity until the morning of Monday, the 4th. On the same day a General Order was drawn up, appealing to the various militia officers in the Province, and embodying instructions for their guidance. This was sent to the printer to be put in type, but everything was done with the utmost calmness and leisure, there being no suspicion on the part of the Government that there was any need for unusual despatch. At this very moment Samuel Lount, Anthony Anderson, Jesse Lloyd and Silas Fletcher, with a considerable body of insurgents at their backs, were on the march to Montgomery's.\n\nAnd yet Sir Francis Head did not apprehend a rebellion in Upper Canada.\n\nIt was known to a good many persons in the city on Saturday that a special meeting of the Council was in session, and that some of the judges and chief officers of State had been summoned to attend. Dr. Rolph, who obtained early intelligence thereof, felt a good deal of anxiety on the subject. Knowing, as he did, that the revolt was to burst forth in five days, and knowing how much was involved in success or failure, the proceedings of the Government had a special significance for him. What could this unusual session portend? What was the nature of the Council's deliberations? Had they become acquainted with the plot? Mackenzie's imprudent methods and his abnormal length of tongue rendered such a contingency not very unlikely. In the course of the afternoon several [Pg 34] items of news reached the Doctor which tended still further to disturb his equanimity. Several persons who had been examined before the Council during the morning spoke openly of what they had seen and heard while in the Council Chamber. From these revelations it appeared that the Government had seen copies of Mackenzie's handbill, and that they had received repeated warnings of an approaching insurrectionary movement. During the afternoon Silas Fletcher called upon Dr. Rolph with a message from Mackenzie to the effect that all was going on well, and that their friends would be at Montgomery's in full force on the night of the following Thursday. The information received up to this time as to the intentions of the Government was too vague to justify the Doctor in sending any discouraging message to Mackenzie, so he contented himself with merely informing Fletcher of what he had heard, and instructing him to communicate the same to Mackenzie. [33] But Fletcher had hardly [Pg 35] taken his departure for the north ere other unpleasant items of intelligence began to reach Dr. Rolph's ears. One of these, which emanated from a trustworthy source, was to the effect that Mackenzie's arrest had been determined upon, and that a warrant for the purpose had actually been issued and placed in the hands of the Sheriff. Allan MacNab, before starting for his home in Hamilton that evening, informed several persons that the Provincial militia were to be notified to hold themselves in readiness, and that he himself was at once about to organize the militia of the Gore District. Other rumours, some true and some false, were whispered about from mouth to mouth as the evening passed by for instance, that the Orangemen of the city were to be supplied with arms from the City Hall; that the garrison was to be filled with pensioners; that within the next week the city was to be placed in a state of defence, [Pg 36] and that active measures were to be resorted to for the punishment of persons disaffected to the Government, whether in Toronto or elsewhere throughout the Province. With such apparently well-founded rumours as these reaching him at every turn, it is not strange that Dr. Rolph should have felt much disquietude. It seemed not improbable that the Executive had become aware of Mackenzie's design in all its details, and that they were even now taking measures for his destruction. It was certain that if the insurgents were in a position to anticipate their proposed attack by two or three days they might easily succeed in capturing the city, for it was evident that the Government were not prepared for immediate action. After consulting with Dr. Morrison, Rolph determined that at all events Mackenzie and his men should not fall into a trap without warning. Mackenzie's exact whereabouts was not known to the [Pg 37] Doctor, but he took it for granted that Gibson would know where he was to be found, and he accordingly despatched a messenger named John Mantach to Gibson's house out on Yonge Street. It was not deemed prudent to commit anything to writing, but the intelligence which had reached the Doctor from credible sources was briefly communicated to the messenger, with instructions to recapitulate the same to Gibson for transmission to Mackenzie. Rolph expressed the opinion that if even so small a force as thre hundred resolute men could be got together and mustered secretly on the outskirts of Toronto by the following Monday, it would be quite practicable to take the city, as the Government were not contemplating an attack at so early a date, and would be completely taken by surprise. [34]\n\nIt was late at night when Mantach reached Gibson's house. Gibson was much surprised at the message, having only heard that day for the first time thatthere was to be a rising on the 7th. [35] He did not know where to find Mackenzie, whom he had not seen since Saturday, the 25th ultimo; [36] but the message would be equally effective if delivered to Lount, and it was safe to assume that Lount was either at or in the immediate neighbourhood of his home. Thither, accordingly, at 4 o'clock on the morning of Sunday the 3rd, another messenger—one William Edmundson, a friend of Gibson's—was despatched with the important tidings, which he received direct from the mouth of Dr. Rolph's own emissary.\n\nWhen Edmundson reached Lount's abode, near Holland landing, he was compelled to deliver the message to Mrs. Lount, her husband being from home. It will thus be seen that this verbal message, involving various important details, passed through several intermediaries after [Pg 38] leaving the lips of Dr. Rolph. It was delivered first by the Doctor to Mantach, next by Mantach to Gibson and Edmundson, then by Edmundson to Mrs. Lount, and finally by Mrs. Lount to her husband. It is thus quite possible that when it reached its final destination it varied somewhat from what it had originally been. The only reason, however, for supposing that any such variation took place is the fact that Mackenzie, when all had been lost, sought to throw the blame of failure upon Dr. Rolph, by representing the message delivered to Lount as a peremptory mandate from the Executive—a mandate which he, Lount, was bound to obey. The message, as despatched by Dr. Rolph, and as received and re-despatched by Gibson, was as above stated, and Mackenzie, instead of endeavouring to misrepresent or find fault with it, ought to have been grateful therefor from the bottom of his heart, as it saved his limbs from the racking rheumatism of the prisoner's cell, and his neck from the hangman's noose. [37] It would have been impossible for him to avoid arrest until Thursday, if he had been going about the townships as usual, and if he had once found himself in the custody of the Sheriff he would never have escaped therefrom but by the scaffold, as his papers would themselves have been amply sufficient to ensure his conviction, and the Government would have been glad enough to avail themselves of such an opportunity of ridding themselves of him.\n\nLount and Anderson had meanwhile been busy with preparations, and had everything in readiness for conducting their forces to Montgomery's in time to make the descent upon Toronto on the following Thursday. Early on the morning of Sunday, the 3rd, they had despatched Nelson Gorham and a Radical named McCarty to Montgomery's to make arrangements for providing the men with food when they should reach the tavern. Lount returned home within a few hours after Edmundson's visit. Upon receiving the message from his [Pg 39] wife, he again sought out Anderson, who was at a house in the immediate neighbourhood. The two resolved to act upon the message. It was clear to them that, \"if the townships could accomplish the enterprise on Thursday, when the Government would be prepared, it would be still easier to do it before the preparation was effectually begun.\" [38] They accordingly sent out notifications to the men composing \"the Lloydtown Company\" to hold themselves in readiness to march to Montgomery's on the morrow instead of on Thursday. The company consisted of more than a hundred volunteers, nearly all of whom mustered on the following (Monday) morning, according to command, at a point a few miles south of Holland Landing. The leaders divided the men up into several parties, and proceeded by different routes, in order that their march might be less likely to attract attention. While moving towards their destination they permitted nobody to pass them on the way, lest the news of their march might be conveyed to the Government. A few persons were turned back, and made to promise not to attempt to pass southward. Others, known to be zealous supporters of the Government, were taken prisoners and compelled to march to Montgomery's. The largest detachment of insurgents, consisting of about forty persons, marched southward with Anderson at their head. Lount proceeded alone by a more circuitous route, in order to notify several other small companies, and to conduct such of them as were available to the appointed place.\n\nAnderson and his men reached Montgomery's between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. They had had a long day's march of more than thirty miles, and were weary and footsore. They had brought few arms with them, partly because the advance of a body of armed men along the public highways would have proclaimed their purpose to every one encountering them on their march, but chiefly because Mackenzie, at a meeting held at Machell's Corners [39] a few nights before, had stated that a small supply of arms and ammunition was concealed at Montgomery's, and ready for use. A few muskets would have been sufficient, as the men depended upon supplying themselves from the [Pg 40] stores in the City Hall. It was found, however, that nothing whatever had been provided in the way of arms and ammunition; and, worse still, there were no rations for the men. The change of day had of course deranged the plans which had been formed for the commissariat, and there was practically nothing to eat in the house. It was not until the larders of the neighbours had been pressed into service that the weary volunteers were enabled to in some measure appease their hunger by a limited supply of such comestibles as dry bread, doughnuts, crackers and cheese. They felt not unreasonably disposed to grumble, but the arrival of Lount a short time afterwards, with eighty or ninety men whom he had collected on the way, and most of whom were armed in some fashion or other, restored them to good humour. Some of them proposed to march into the city and carry out their designs forthwith, but the general opinion was in favour of resting for the night and making an attack after an early breakfast on the following morning. This plan was finally adopted, and the men were informed that when they were ready for repose they might stretch themselves out upon the bare floor wherever they could find room. Foragers were out during the greater part of the night, picking up such provisions as were to be had from the farmers. But events of a more exciting nature than foraging expeditions were to take place before the dawn of another day.\n\nAnd still Sir Francis Head did not apprehend a rebellion in Upper Canada.\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XX.\n\nWhen Dr. Rolph's papers came into my hands some months ago, I found among them a written statement made more than thirty years since by John Hawk, a nephew of Samuel Lount, and a former resident of the township of King. Mr. Hawk, who took an active part in the Rebellion, is still living, and resides near the village of Harley, in the County of Brant. He distinctly remembers all the matters referred to in his statement, which he confirms in every particular, and no one conversing with him could entertain any doubt either as to the accuracy of his memory or the clearness of his convictions. I have thought it best to insert the statement in this place, as a considerable part of it deals with matters treated of in the foregoing chapter. The other portions, dealing with matters subsequent in point of time, will be referred to in future pages.\n\nSTATEMENT OF JOHN HAWK, NEPHEW OF SAMUEL LOUNT.\n\nI was down at Mitchell's [Machell's i.e., Aurora] Corners on Sunday, the 3rd day of December, 1837, to speak for a keg of powder and one hundred pounds of lead for Thursday, the 7th, which was the day my brother, who had attended a meeting held by Mackenzie a short time previously, told me Mackenzie had fixed for the rising.\n\n[Pg 41]\n\nI had just left the Corners, about two o'clock in the afternoon, when Wm. Edmundson overtook me and told me the day of the rising had been altered to Monday, the 4th. I asked him who altered the day, and he said to the effect that the word had come from Gibson. I went on and told the news at Lloydtown, and the next morning started with the Lloydtown company, numbering about one hundred, commanded by Anthony Anderson and my brother. We [40] got to Montgomery's at between ten and eleven o'clock on Monday evening. Lount had not then arrived. We did not find the arms which Mackenzie had stated at the meeting above mentioned were concealed at Montgomery's, nor anything to eat. We did not expect a large quantity of arms, as we relied on the four thousand stand of arms in the City Hall, but we looked for what had been promised. I and many others wanted to go into the city on Monday night, but we were overruled. We could have taken the city that night or the next morning easily. On Tuesday morning, at Montgomery's, Mackenzie, mounted on a white horse, made us a little speech, before we started for the city. He said he would be the Commander-in-Chief for that day, or \"for the time being,\" or words to that effect. Mackenzie afterwards went west towards Captain Baldwin's. When the Flag of Truce came up the first time we gave a cheer when we saw Dr. Rolph and Mr. Baldwin with it. My uncle, Mr. Samuel Lount, said to me: \"Here, Jack, hold my rifle I will have to talk with them, as Mackenzie isn't here.\" I remember his words and the whole scene vividly. I wasn't more than ten yards distant from my uncle during the conversation, which lasted, I should think, from three to five minutes. When the party turned and went back towards the city I handed my uncle back his rifle. He said nothing to me about the object or result of the truce. Mackenzie joined us before the Flag of Truce came up the second time.\n\nI saw Mackenzie strew papers on the floor in a room in Horne's house, and then set fire to them. When the fire was well started he came out and mounted his horse and rode up towards Montgomery's, and the word was to follow him. We were all very much surprised at his going from, instead of towards the city. We all expected to push right into the city at once. There were then between four and five hundred of us, besides those at the College Avenue and the Don. I heard Mackenzie say he burnt Horne's house because he was the worst Tory in the city. Everyone I knew was angry and disgusted at our going back to Montgomery's. The men began to say that Mackenzie was afraid to go into the city. I remember John Fletcher, a son of Silas Fletcher, [41] who came out from the city and arrived among us while Mackenzie was setting fire to Horne's house, saying to me, \"What are they fooling about here for? If they come in they can take the city without firing a shot.\" When we got back to Montgomery's there was nothing to eat. I think about one-third of the Lloydtown people left that night in disgust.\n\nI left the next morning (Wednesday) with Nelson Gorham, who was to take a message to Dr. Charles Duncombe. We did not expect Dr. Rolph, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Bidwell or Dr. Morrison to join us, though we thought they were favourable to the rising. I didn't hear any one asking for them.\n\n(Signed) JOHN HAWK.\n\n[Pg 42]\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nTHE REBELS AT MONTGOMERY'S.\n\nTop\n\nI t is now time to return to Mackenzie, who at last accounts was making his final tour in the northern townships of York. Having successively visited Lloydtown, Stouffville, Machell's Corners, Newmarket and other centres of Radical opinion, and having notified the adherents of his cause to be on hand at Montgomery's on the night of the 7th, he retraced his steps southward. All that remained to be done prior to the moment for decisive action was to make arrangements for the commissariat. On Sunday, the 3rd of December, about five o'clock in the afternoon, he reached the house of David Gibson. He then learned for the first time of Dr. Rolph's message, and of its transmission to Lount. He displayed much angry excitement, which Gibson believed to be due to chagrin at Rolph's presumption in venturing to interfere with his plans. Gibson was not able to inform him whether Lount intended to act upon Dr. Rolph's suggestion, as there had been no time to hear from Holland Landing since Edmundson's departure. Mackenzie, however, who had provided for an attack on the city on Thursday night, and had made all his calculations accordingly, determined to prevent any variation from his programme, and to that end he despatched one of Gibson's servants to Holland Landing with instructions to Lount to keep to the original arrangement. [42] Another messenger was despatched to Dr. Rolph [Pg 43] in the city, requesting him to come out and confer with Mackenzie, in order that they might take counsel as to what was best to be done. Dr. Rolph was absent from his house on professional employment, and his reply did not reach Mackenzie until next day, as will presently be mentioned. Mackenzie passed that night at Gibson's house. At a late hour Gorham and McCarty arrived, with the intelligence that they had been to Montgomery's, as instructed by Lount, to arrange for supplies, but that the proprietor had declined to undertake such a responsibility. This news caused a loud ebullition of temper from Mackenzie, who declared his intention of coercing Montgomery into compliance. On the following morning—Monday, the 4th—he and Gibson repaired to the tavern to see what arrangements could be made for the reception of the men on Thursday.\n\nMontgomery's tavern was a large wayside inn, with a broad platform in front, and with a lamp suspended over a central doorway. It stood within a few feet of the site now occupied by the brick hotel at Eglinton. It was owned by John Montgomery, a prominent Radical of those days, but was leased to a tenant named John Linfoot, who had taken possession on the previous Friday. [43] Montgomery, however, was a temporary boarder in the house, and in this way became identified with the Rebellion. [44] He had for years taken a conspicuous part in the local elections, and had all along been a violent supporter of Mackanzie. He was a man of considerable means, and had sunscribed liberally to the fund for defraying Mackenzie's expedition to England in 1832 and 1833. Two or three months before the outbreak he had seen [Pg 44] fit to take exception to some of Mackenzie's methods, which he had criticized in tolerably plain language. This had led to his being excluded from the most secret of the Radical councils ever since, though he continued to do his utmost for the advancement of the general Radical policy. As a consequence of his exclusion from the inner mysteries, he was not in the secrets of the conspirators. Like almost every other Reformer in the country, he was aware that some scheme was on foot for subverting the Government, but he had no knowledge as to its nature, nor as to the time when it was to be consummated. He received his first intimation on the night of Sunday, the 3rd, when Lount's messengers arrived with a request that he would act as commissary to the insurgents. The request took him completely by surprise. It seemed to him that the project was altogether premature, and that its success was more than doubtful, more particularly when conducted under such auspices. He declined to have anything to do with furnishing supplies, and advised the messengers to return to their homes. The messengers then repaired to Gibson's as previously mentioned, and there they remained all night.\n\nMackenzie had no sooner reached the tavern on Monday morning than he poured out the vials of his wrath upon Montgomery's head with unstinted hand. He reproached him for having deserted the cause in refusing to act as commissary, and with being much more desirous of advancing his own interests than those of his party. Montgomery appears to have taken these reproaches very coolly. He replied that he had deserted no cause, and that his regard for the welfare of his party was too well known to stand in need of any confirmation. While Mackenzie fumed and stormed about, a messenger arrived from Dr. Rolph, with a reply to Mackenzie's request for an interview. The Doctor sent word that he would be at the house of James Hervey Price about one o'clock in the afternoon. Mr. Price's house was several hundred yards away across the fields to the north-west.\n\nMackenzie, accompanied by Gibson, repaired to Mr. Price's at the hour appointed, and found Dr. Rolph there before him. The disasters which had recently befallen the insurgent arms at St. Charles, in Lower Canada, had exercised a dispiriting influence upon the Doctor. The [Pg 45] movement in that Province, from which so much had been anticipated, had practically come to an end. It had proved a signal failure, and its collapse had been attended by many deplorable circumstances. The insurgent forces under \"General\" Thomas Storrow Brown had been routed, slaughtered, and dispersed. Some of the leaders had been arrested; others had sought safety in an ignominious flight. Martial law was about to be proclaimed, and the disaffected districts would soon be swept by devastating troops. White flags were encountered at every turn, and in some instances they proved an inadequate protection to the inhabitants. There seemed too much reason to fear that Sir John Colborne, after achieving so complete a triumph in Lower Canada, would turn his arms in a westerly direction, and that he would have a force at his back which would be irresistible. Full particulars of the nature of Sir John's preparations to stamp out insurrection had reached Toronto within the last twenty-four hours, and Dr. Rolph felt that the insurgents of Upper Canada should govern themselves accordingly. His own belief was that the defeat at St. Charles and its attendant circumstances had wrought an entire change in the prospect as regarded both Provinces, and that anything beyond a temporary success, even in Upper Canada, was of extremely doubtful achievement. He was not the man to advocate the playing of a game where the probabilities seemed largely against him, and he was in favour of an immediate abandonment of the movement by all persons concerned in it. The only alternative was to act with promptitude and vigour. The Doctor informed Mackenzie and Gibson that on the forenoon of the previous day (Sunday), before the news of Sir John Colborne's preparations had reached him, he had sent a messenger to Lount direct, informing him that the Government seemed to be less on the alert than he had supposed, and that Lount should govern himself accordingly. [45] It was certain, however, that a warrant was out for Mackenzie, and that it would be executed if any opportunity were afforded. The Doctor did his utmost to impress upon Mackenzie that the wisest thing to do would be to abandon the movement and send [Pg 46] the men back to their homes, by which means their prosecution for treason would be avoided. To this counsel Mackenzie would not even listen with patience. It was too late, he said, for him to talk about withdrawal. If he had embarked in a leaky vessel he would stand the consequences, and \"the men\" would share his fortunes. [46] Finding him immovable on this point, Dr. Rolph then urged that not a moment should be lost. The Government were unprepared, but they were to some extent alive to the importance of making preparation, and would not long be without adequate means of defence. The intention to take the city on Thursday night had by this time become known to thousands of persons, and if it had not already been communicated to the Government, it would certainly be so before many hours. Everything was to be gained by precipitating the movement. The merest handful of resolute men could effect the capture of the city, provided that they set about it at once. All these matters were distinctly pointed out by Dr. Rolph to Mackenzie and Gibson. The latter fully concurred in the Doctor's arguments; but Mackenzie, while admitting that they were not without weight, was still disposed to abide by the Thursday arrangement, as by that time the insurgents would have assembled in such force that no effective opposition on the part of the Government would be possible. It was evident, however, that the question of accelerated movement must in great measure depend upon Lount, from whom nothing had yet been heard. If he were actually on the way, with a force of men openly at his back, there could no longer be any pretence of concealment, and the sooner the attack upon the city was made the better. [47] During this interview Mackenzie made no pretence whatever that Rolph was entitled to act in an executive capacity. Indeed he rather seemed to find fault with the Doctor for having taken upon himself to interfere. [48] However, after a conference [Pg 47] of nearly two hours, it was understood that they were to be guided by Lount's action. Should he, in the course of the next few hours, present himself at Montgomery's with any considerable number of men, there could be no doubt that an immediate advance would be advisable. If, on the other hand, Lount should have concluded to act upon the previous arrangement, the only thing to be done would be to take every conceivable precaution, and to move with effect when the appointed time should arrive. On this understanding the trio separated, Rolph riding back into town to await the course of events.\n\nMackenzie and Gibson, upon leaving Price's house, proceeded separately by devious routes to an old structure a short distance in the rear of Gibson's farm, known as Shepard's mill, which had long been a secret rendezvous for the Radicals of the neighbourhood. There, according to a previous arrangement, they found several local insurgents engaged in casting bullets. They had not long been there ere Gibson's servant, who had been sent north to communicate with Lount on the previous day, arrived with the intelligence that Lount, Anderson, Lloyd and Fletcher, with the Lloydtown Company and a number of other volunteers, were already on the road, and might be expected at the tavern during the evening. The course of future action, therefore, was no longer doubtful. The rebels were in arms, and the Rebellion had begun. Their southward march had already aroused the whole country side, and their designs would certainly be known to the Government before the night was over. The city must be theirs before the next sunrise.\n\nMackenzie accepted the inevitable with apparent cheerfulness. Recognizing the importance of as far as possible cutting off communication with the city, and thereby preventing news from reaching the Government, he returned to Montgomery's and placed three lines of guard across Yonge Street. The first of these was placed directly opposite the tavern, the second about seventy yards farther north, and the third about sixty yards to the south of the tavern. A line of guard was also placed on the first road to the westward, running for some distance almost parallel with Yonge Street. No one who was not recognized as friendly to the rising was permitted to pass southward, and a good many persons who sought to do so were arrested and conveyed [Pg 48] within the tavern as prisoners. Soon after eight o'clock the insurgents began to arrive in small detachments of ten to twenty at a time. [49] By nine o'clock they mustered about ninety men, among whom were all the original organizers of the insurrection except Lount, who did not present himself until somewhat later. They were accompanied by a few loyalists who had been taken prisoners en route in order to prevent them from carrying intelligence into the city. The dissatisfaction of the jaded volunteers at finding that no arrangements had been made for providing them with food has already been referred to. Mackenzie was furious at Linfoot, the landlord, who refused to take any steps to obtain supplies unless he were supplied with payment in advance. Linfoot was not a Radical, nor even a sympathizer with Radicals. He was simply a man of no polities whatever, who believed in looking sharply after his own interests, and was not desirous of opening an account with such doubtful customers as the insurgents. In vain Mackenzie shrieked and screamed at him, shook him by the collar, and threatened the direst consequences. [50] He was too stoical to be moved by any such means. Mackenzie had been supplied with a limited amount of money collected by subscription among the men in the north to carry on the campaign, and to this fund he was now compelled to have recourse. By dint of great exertions, as mentioned towards the close of the last chapter, a very light and meagre supper was at last provided. It went some distance towards allaying the hungry cravings of the men, who however were weary with their long and unaccustomed march. They were moreover dispirited at the apparent lack of method and organization. They had been led to suppose that they would find great numbers of volunteers at the tavern, ready and anxious to join them in invading the city and overturning the Government. The reality fell so far short of their anticipations that some of them gave utterance to their disappointment, and charged their leaders with having deceived them. A few words of explanation, however, quieted these murmurings, and a good many of them expressed a desire to be led into Toronto at once.\n\n[Pg 49]\n\nThe consideration of future action could no longer be postponed. A Council of War was held, at which Mackenzie advocated an immediate advance, and even offered to lead the men into the city himself. He was however overruled by the other leaders, who urged, truly enough, that the men were in no condition to engage in such an enterprise until they had had a night's rest after their unwonted fatigue, and had been provided with suitable food. It was further pointed out that reinforcements might confidently be expected during the night, so that by postponing action until the morning, their operations might be undertaken with a tolerably assured prospect of success. Mackenzie yielded to these representations, and the men were informed that nothing would be required of them for that night, except from time to time to relieve guard. Colonel Van Egmond was not to be looked for until Thursday, but little importance was attached to his absence, as the men professed their readiness to be led by Lount and Anderson. It was evident that Anderson had inspired them with great confidence in his military skill and experience, and that they would follow him with enthusiasm whenever, he thought proper to place himself at their head. An understanding was accordingly arrived at that the advance on the city was to be made at daylight on the following morning, which would be Tuesday, the 5th.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the proper thing would have been to seek repose and get through the night as quietly as possible. But Mackenzie's nerves were strung up to a high pitch, and his restless spirit would not permit him to remain tranquil at the tavern. He proposed that he, accompanied by two or three more, should advance into the city on a reconnoitring expedition, in order that the precise state of affairs there might be ascertained. This was a foolish proposal, due simply and solely to the state of Mackenzie's nerves. Such an expedition was wholly unnecessary, as Dr. Rolph had acquainted him with the state of the city at mid-day, since which time no very remarkable change could very well have taken place. It was as useless for any practical purpose as was Brewer's master-stroke on behalf of Mr. Veneering, in going down to the House of Commons to see how things looked. [51] Under all the circumstances, however, a proposal of this kind was certain to find [Pg 50] seconders. Four of the insurgents promptly volunteered to accompany Mackenzie. One of these was no less important a personage than Captain Anthony Anderson himself, upon whom the men chiefly relied to lead them on the morrow. Another was Joseph Shepard, a member of a well-known Radical family resident on Yonge Street, near Gibson's. [52] The other two were respectively named Edward Kennedy and Robert Smith. The little party set out for the city a few minutes before ten o'clock. [53] Before recording the exciting adventures which they were destined to encounter, it will be well to glance at the state of affairs in the capital, and at the efforts made by the loyalists to the north to convey intelligence of the true state of affairs to the authorities.\n\nColonel Fitz Gibbon had no sooner received his appointment as Acting Adjutant-General of Militia, on the morning of Monday, December 4th, than he began to display more vigilance than ever. He allowed himself no rest, but hurried about from place to place on very slight pretexts, or on no pretext at all. His condition appears to have been very much like Mackenzie's on the evening of that day, his nerves being strained to such a pitch that inertia was impossible to him. It is undeniable that his vigilance amounted to fussiness, and that he was greatly disposed to magnify the importance of his office; but it is equally certain that he was almost the only supporter of the Government in the city who truly appreciated the gravity of the situation. He continued in a state of preternatural excitement throughout the day, and indeed for many days afterwards. He did his utmost to kindle a corresponding excitement in the hearts of everybody with whom he conversed, but, so far as Monday was concerned, with little or no effect. When he buttonholed and harangued his acquaintances on the streets they either laughed outright at his predictions of [Pg 51] danger, or else humoured him by pretended acquiescence. In short, he was treated like an unruly or hysterical child, with whose wildest fancies it is deemed best to comply, lest his excitement may be intensified by opposition. As night approached his apprehensions of danger increased. He believed that he had been marked out by the Radicals for destruction, and feared to remain at his own house lest he might be assassinated by some emissary of Mackenzie. He determined to pass the night at his office in the Parliament Buildings, and invited a number of friends to watch with him there. [54] Those who accepted the invitation noticed that he was in a restless, disturbed state, and feared lest his mind should give way. [55] Before ten o'clock his solicitude for the city's safety became so much intensified that he could not resist an impulse to communicate his fears to the Lieutenant-Governor in person. Leaving his friends on guard at his office, he proceeded to Government House, where he was ushered into the presence of his Excellency's daughter and his sister, Mrs. Dalrymple. In reply to his request for an interview, he was informed by Mrs. Dalrymple that the Lieutenant-Governor had been fatigued during the evening, and had gone to bed. The Colonel, however, was so importunate that his Excellency was roused from his repose, and soon presented himself in his dressing-gown. \"I told him,\" writes Colonel Fitz Gibbon, [56] \"that I apprehended some outbreak would take place that very night, which fear I deemed it my duty to communicate to him.\" Sir Francis, concealing his irritation as best he could, and doubtless inwardly cursing this officious busybody for intruding upon his slumbers without cause, received the communication without appearing to be in the least affected thereby, and anon got back to his bedroom. He did not in the least apprehend a rebellion in Upper Canada. The Colonel returned to his office, where he was soon after informed by a man who had ridden into the city by way of Crookshank's Lane that a body of rebels was approaching [Pg 52] the city from the north. This was news calling for immediate action. Among the friends collected around him was a young student at law, who was destined to attain high eminence in the forensic annals of this Province, and whose name was John Hillyard Cameron. This youth was straightway despatched by Colonel Fitz Gibbon to ring the bell of Upper Canada College. He proceeded to carry out his instructions, but had hardly begun to tug at the bell-rope ere he was requested by one of the teachers to desist, upon the ground that there was probably no truth in the story about the approach of the rebels. The Colonel himself mounted a horse which had been kept in readiness in a stable near by, and galloped to the houses of the principal personages residing west of Yonge street, calling upon the occupants to turn out and defend the city. The latter were for the most part incredulous. Some of them flatly refused to cross their thresholds on any such absurd pretext. An emissary of Colonel Fitz Gibbon presented himself in front of Judge Jones's house, and summoned him in stentorian tones to come forth. The Judge's Welsh blood boiled up at being disturbed at such an hour. \"What is all this noise about?\" he asked, emerging into the street \"who desired you to call me?\" \"Colonel Fitz Gibbon,\" was the response. \"Oh!\" exclaimed the Judge, \"the over zeal of that man is giving us a great deal of trouble.\" [57]\n\nHaving done his utmost to arouse the friends of the Government io a sense of their danger, Colonel Fitz Gibbon proceeded on horseback up Yonge Street on a reconnoitring expedition. He was accompanied by George Brock, a student at law, and W. Bellingham, afterwards an officer of the 32nd Regiment. The trio rode rapidly northward as far as the ravine in front of Sheriff Jarvis's residence at Rosedale, fully two miles from Government House. As they encountered no one on the way, and as everything seemed quiet and still, the Colonel began to doubt the truth of the news he had heard. In order to make certain, however, he sent Brock and Bellingham forward in the direction of Montgomery's, with instructions to ascertain whether any rebels were approaching, and to return and report to him in the city, whither he immediately returned to organize and arm the inhabitants. On his way southward he met [Pg 53] two persons on horseback, [58] who proved to be Archibald McDonald, wharfinger, of 36 Front Street, and John Powell, one of the aldermen representing St. Andrew's Ward in the City Council. They informed him that they had heard of the approach of the rebels, and that they intended to ride out as far as Montgomery's to ascertain if the rumour were true. As they were both well-known Tory supporters of the Government, the Colonel expressed his satisfaction, and begged them to make haste, so that they might overtake Broc"
