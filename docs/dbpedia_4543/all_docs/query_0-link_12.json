TO THE PIONEERS OF OHIO WHO SERVED THEIR COUNTRY IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR This volume is respectfully and gratefully dedicated THE F. J. IIEER PRINTING CO. Columbus, Ohio 1929 Bound at the State Bindery. AUTHORIZATION H. B. No. loi Providing for the publication and distribution of the roster of the soldiers of the revolutionary war, buried in Ohio. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio: Section i. The adjutant general of Ohio is hereby authorized to secure the publication in book form of a complete roster of all the sol- diers and sailors of the revolutionary war, buried in Ohio, the data for which has already been collected by the Ohio Daughters of the American Revolution, and presented to the state. Section 2. Such roster shall contain the principal items of the record of each soldier or sailor of the revolutionary war who is buried in Ohio. All names in such roster shall be arranged in alphabetical order in such a manner as to render all information contained therein ready and accessible, and shall be thoroughly indexed. The binding shall be done at the state bindery under the direction of the superintendent of purchase and printing. Section 3. Two thousand copies of such roster shall be printed, to be distributed as follows : three hundred copies shall be delivered to the state librarian for distribution by him, to the libraries of Ohio and other states, provided that one copy be sent to a library in each county ; two hundred copies shall be delivered to the Daughters of the American Revo- lution for distribution among their own chapters ; fifty copies to the adjutant general; and two copies to each member of the General As- sembly. In addition to the above free distribution, the remaining copies shall be delivered to the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, to be sold by it at cost, and the proceeds thereof paid into the state treasury to the credit of the general revenue fund. Section 4. For the printing, stock and binding of the roster as provided for in this act there is hereby appropriated out of any moneys in the state treasury to the credit of the general revenue fund, and not otherwise appropriated, not to exceed the sum of two thousand dollars. The appropriation herein made shall be for the use of the adjutant general in carrying out the provisions of this act. Adopted by House Bill 502 — Appropriation Bill. Published by direction of Frank D. Henderson, Adjutant General. John R. Rea, Military Registrar. (3) FOREWORD The records contained in this Roster were presented by the Daughters of the American Revolution to the State of Ohio as a tribute of respect to the hardy pioneers who transplanted to this State the noble ideals for which they fought from 1775 to 1783, and who now sleep the last sleep beneath its soil. The 87th General Assembly of Ohio accepted the gift of these records from the Daughters of the American Revolution and provided an appropriation for their publication as a part of the Military records of the State. The Roster is not designed as a genealogical reference book, although it may be of service in tracing pioneer ancestry. Its primary object is to present an authetic and complete list of Revolu- tionary soldiers buried in this State. Research has extended over a quarter of a century, and had it not been for the patriotic service given gratis by Ohio men and women the compilation of these records would not have been possible. No detail was too insignificant for these searchers; county cemeteries were investigated by faithful Chapter chairmen of the D. A. R. ; newspapers gave freely of their space ; the U. S. Bureau of Pensions gave valuable aid and many persons were assiduous in searching the D. A. R. lineage books and the published lists of the Sons of the American Revo- lution. Contained herein are many records of proven service, but there are some which may never be proved though the service given by the individuals is beyond question. Information in many instances was meager, but this, it is felt, can l)e corrected by adding to the Roster additional records which are now or will be in the future under investigation. The chapter or person who filed the data is responsible for the au- thenticit}' of the record and any communication should be carried on with them. Filing of the records was begun by Mrs. Eugene Kennedy, Dayton, Ohio, during her term as State Chairman of Historical Sites and Revolutionary Graves, 1920 to 1923, and the Roster was compiled by the present State Chairman who submits the work in answer to the toast of Davidi Morris, Revolutionary soldier, who pleaded at a patriotic meeting held at Troy, Ohio, July 4, 1827 — \"May the precious blood that was spilt between the years '75 and '83 as a sacrifice for our liberty and independence be ever commenorated.\" Lest the reader should wonder at the large number of Revolutionary soldiers buried in Ohio, it should be recalled that the present boundaries of Ohio were nearest the original colonies, and when land grants were given to the soldiers thither came the hardy New Englanders to the Western Reserve and the region of Lake Erie ; sturdy Pennsylvanians crossed over into central Ohio and the Virginian and Carolinian took up his abode in the southern part of Ohio. Here in the Northwest Territory they lived and died; they were fathers of a race who inherited the invincible courage and sterling qualities of the Revolutionary soldier and who took up the burden of founding the Nation by pressing westward.
