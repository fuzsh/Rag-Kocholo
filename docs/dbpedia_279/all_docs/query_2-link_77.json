If you were forced to do something in drag, what would you choose to do? \"\n\nGerard: \"Karate.\" (Everyone breaks out in laughter]\n\nFrank: \"I liked the 'if you were forced, what would you choose to do.'\"\n\nGerard: \"It's like the drag fairy comes by and says 'What would you like to do?' Um, yeah, karate\"\n\nFrank: \"Really?\"\n\nGerard: \"No. Really, I would do what I did when I dressed in drag this one time before. I went to school in drag, in art school and my day was completely different because everybody thought I was a chick.\"\n\nFrank: \"He looked like Christina Ricci.\"\n\nGerard: \"You should see me as a chick. So I went as a girl, as like an experiment and it worked really well and everyone was really nice to me but I couldn't talk obviously... You know train conductors were really cool to me on my commute...\"\n\nFrank: \"I would date Gerard.\"\n\nGerard: \"HA! I looked hot as a chick.\"\n\noh an where the hell are these from?\n\n\"Gerard.. Well, he's just himself. We talk.. We cry.. And he's still Gerard Way.\" - frank\n\n\"Gerard, in my view, is the second coolest motherfucker on this planet. Second because I'm first, and therefore cooler\" - frank\n\nsambouvieer\n\nHey guys! I was so happy to see that somebody had the idea to create a community like that. In this case, it's really helpful for me.\n\nI read this quote a long time ago, like the beginning of the year, and it's stuck to my head ever since. I think it was Mikey that said it, and it was basically about high school being the worst time of your life or something like that. So, I would really appreciate if someone could find it for me so I can live in peace without this half quote I remember haunting me, lol."
