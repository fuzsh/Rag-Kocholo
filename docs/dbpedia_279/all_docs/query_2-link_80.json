        "text": "Allow me to begin by stating, quite plainly, that last night was an electrifying experience.\n\nAs a long time fan of Frank Iero, the former guitarist of My Chemical Romance, I jumped at the opportunity to attend his performance on August 3rd at the Paper Tiger. I expected nothing but greatness from Iero and his new cast of talented musicians, The Future Violents, who all come from various walks of life, most notably Tucker Rule, his drummer and the drummer of the legendary post-hardcore outfit, Thursday, along with Matt Armstrong on bass, Evan Nestor on guitar and backing vocals, and Kayleigh Goldsworthy on the keys and violin. My expectations were spot on.\n\nAfter a beautiful opening performance from Geoff Rickly (the lead vocalist of Thursday) complete with performances of classic Thursday tunes, Geoff’s own brooding ballads, and stories reminiscing on a tortured past that led to a few funny encounters and, later, a long road to recovery, I realized that the greatness I had expected was most certainly going to be exceeded throughout the night\n\nAfter, Rickly’s set, I chatted with the girls around me as we anticipated the Future Violents’ arrival on stage. As the lights dimmed, I could actually feel the excitement in the room building, and once the band was on stage, the rest was a whirlwind. Heads were bobbing, hands were clapping, girls were screaming, and the band’s energy was nothing short of intense.\n\nThe band performed old hits and new, including “.weighted.,” “BFF,” “Young and Doomed,” and the song from their newest music video, “Great Party,” and the crowd did not stop moving until the band was off stage for good. If you have ever been a fan of Frank Iero, punk-rock, or just an all-around good show, I suggest catching this band on one of their remaining tour dates listed here: https://frank-iero.com and if you can’t make it to one of their upcoming dates, I suggest listening to both Frank Iero and the Future Violents and Geoff Rickly on Spotify/Bandcamp and keeping up with the members on their Instagrams, listed below.\n\n-RCT, photographer\n\nMy portfolio (which will soon include more images from the show): https://rinichristinaphoto.wixsite.com/rinichristinaphoto\n\nThe amazing Geoff Rickly:\n\nMusic: https://geoffrickly.bandcamp.com/album/mixtape-1\n\nThursday (Rickly & Rule): https://open.spotify.com/artist/61awhbNK16ku1uQyXRsQj5?si=KkXzchoLSfuCwXiBBqsoaQ\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/geoffrickly/\n\nThe dazzling Frank Iero and the Future Violents:\n\nMusic: https://open.spotify.com/artist/75CziSb5bEWIj1m8TdMwYy?si=jt5HuPaGQoeYenP_IUJ8zw\n\nMembers:\n\nEvan Nestor (Guitar): https://www.instagram.com/tipgiblets/\n\nMatt Armstrong (Bass): https://www.instagram.com/thesituationist/\n\nTucker Rule (Drummer): https://www.instagram.com/tuckerrule/\n\nKayleigh Goldsworthy (Keys/Violin): https://www.instagram.com/kayleighgolds/"
