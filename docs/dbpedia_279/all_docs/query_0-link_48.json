        "text": "Background\n\nFrank Anthony Iero, Jr. is a celebrated band member, guitarist, and vocalist with several songs in his arsenal. He was born on October 31, 1981, and his birthplace is Belleview, New Jersey. Iero is of Italian and Polish descent. He’s also a Scorpio by design. Iero’s parents separated during his childhood, and he grew up living with his mother. Iero’s father and grandfather were musicians who influenced his career. His father taught him to play the drums, and he attended Queen of Peace High School. Iero enrolled in Rutgers University but didn’t complete his tertiary education due to touring with the band.\n\nIero picked an interest in the guitar even though he could play the drums. At 11, he began playing in local New Jersey punk bands. Iero was the frontman for Pencey Prep, the punk band, and in 2001, they released their debut studio album, “Heartbreak in Stereo.” Pencey Prep disbanded shortly after this album, and Iero performed for multiple bands after. These bands include American Nightmare, Sector 12, I Am A Graveyard, and Hybrid. This was all before he joined My Chemical Romance in 2002 as a rhythm guitarist. Iero contributed to tracks two and eight on their debut studio album, “I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.” The band released three more albums before disbanding in 2013. Iero had multiple side projects as an M.C.R. band member. He was the lead vocalist on Leathermouth and released their debut album, “XO” (2009). He also fronted the digital hardcore band Death Spells with James Dewees in 2013 before beginning his solo career that year. Iero released his debut solo album, “Stomachaches,” in August 2014 under the moniker “frnkiero andthe cellabration.” He released a second album, “Parachutes,” in 2016 before changing his alias to “Frank Iero and the Future Violents.” With this new moniker, Iero released his third studio album, “Barriers,” in 2019, before his 2022 reunion with My Chemical Romance.\n\nIero has a celebratory career as a vocalist and guitarist. With such a successful yet public career, Iero’s personal life is seldom in the media. He married Jamia Nestor in February 2007. The couple has three kids, whom they adore."
