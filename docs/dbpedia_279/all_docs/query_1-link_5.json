He is best known as the guitarist and backing vocalist for My Chemical Romance, as well as the singer for the hardcore band Leathermouth, and electronic/noise outfit Death Spells. Frankâ€™s solo career started in 2013 shortly after My Chemical Romance disbanded, and as Frnkiero and the Cellebration, he will release Stomachaches, his first solo album, on August 25, 2014 through Staple Records. You can follow him on Twitter here.\n\nMy Chemical Romance's former guitarist thought he had the Murder City Devils all figured out. Their new album proved him wrong."
