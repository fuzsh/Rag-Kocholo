The only thing that we don't have is you and how weird you are inherently. That's the good shit, the stuff that makes you a little bit broken or a little bit off-kilter, a little bit strange, a little bit awkward and uncomfortable in your own skin. That's the best part. That's why people are so amazing and so interesting, not because they all look the same. Be a little bit ugly. I find beauty in it.\"\n\nIn this episode of String Theory, Ernie Ball speaks with Frank Iero about his history with My Chemical Romance, touring the world, discovering who he was as a musician, his inspirations, and more."
