What's not so on-brand for the My Chemical Romance guitarist is the gift his dad gave him to celebrate the big 4-0 this year.\n\nHe took to Instagram to share the hilarious present: a sweatshirt and matching baseball hat that say \"Genuine Antique Iero. Been There, Done That, Can't Remember.\"\n\n\"yes, i turned 40 years old on sunday,\" he captioned the photo. \"yes, based on some of the gifts i received this year i believe my dad has started shopping through either catalogs or facebook ads.\"\n\nSee the funny post below."
