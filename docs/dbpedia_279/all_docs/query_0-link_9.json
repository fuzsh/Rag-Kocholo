        "text": "American musician Frank Iero, best known for his work as rhythm guitarist and backup vocalist of the rock band My Chemical Romance, was born in Belleville, New Jersey. He first learned how to play the drums from his father, who had also been a musician, but later transitioned to playing the guitar. By age 11, he was already playing in local bands on the New Jersey punk scene. He played in several bands before My Chemical Romance, even fronting Pencey Prep, with which he released an album, before joining Gerard Way's group. Iero eventually dropped out of college to go on tour with My Chemical Romance, and worked with the group on the release of their debut album, \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" (2002), and all their subsequent albums over the years until their breakup in 2013. During this time, he also fronted the hardcore punk group Leathermouth and The Love Cats, a tribute band to The Cure. His first solo song was featured in the film \"Frankenweenie\" (2012). After the end of My Chemical Romance, Iero focused on his solo work, releasing his debut solo album, \"Stomachaches\" (2014). His third solo album, \"Barriers\" (2019) was elected by Loudwire as one of the 50 best rock albums of that year. He has since reunited with his My Chemical Romance bandmates for a new tour in 2023."
