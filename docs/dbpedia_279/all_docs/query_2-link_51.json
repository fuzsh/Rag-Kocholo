        "text": "My Chemical Romance hasn’t been an active band for six years, though the rumor mill got cranked last month by a most unusual source in Joe Jonas.\n\nMCR guitarist Frank Iero has now poured cold water on that reunion gossip, and he questions why on earth a JoBro was the cause of it.\n\nJoe Jonas set things off when he told the U.K.’s KISS FM Breakfast show, “I’ve got some dirt.” MCR was “apparently rehearsing” next to the pop band in New York recently, “which I thought they broke up, so I don’t know,” he said.\n\nMaybe he heard wrong. In an interview with the Asbury Park Press, MCR guitarist Frank Iero went on the record by saying it ain’t so, and he’s doubled-down in an interview for the Zach Sang Show.\n\n“I don’t understand why you would do an interview about your band and talk about someone else’s band,” Iero said in the interview, which aired Wednesday. “I think they’re trying to rebrand their band as a real rock band and they’re trying to mention as many rock bands and trying to get, like, synonymous with other things. And people aren’t gonna forget that you’re a Disney band, bro. Sorry, it’s not gonna happen.”\n\nSo that’s that.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe Jonas Brothers, Kevin, Joe and Nick, have been flying high since reforming. Their comeback song “Sucker” breezed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking their first leader on the list. And the album it’s lifted from, Happiness Begins, bowed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last month.\n\nMCR disbanded in March 2013, announcing at the time it was simply “time for it to end” after 12 years and four albums as a unit."
