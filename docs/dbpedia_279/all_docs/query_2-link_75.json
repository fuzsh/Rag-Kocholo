        "text": "2. Frank Anthony Iero was born on October 31st, 1981 (making him a Scorpio), in Belleville, New Jersey. Not many people know how to say his last name, which is correctly pronounced \"eye-year-oh\". Frank is 5'4'' and has hazel eyes with a dark drown natural hair color (now dyed black). He grew up with his mom, Linda, who divorced his dad (a great influence to him over the years). Just like fellow band mate Gerard Way, he has been playing in bands since he was eleven. Frank went to a catholic school growing up, he was bullied in high school, he went to Rutgers University on a scholarship, but dropped out to join My Chemical Romance. Frank married his childhood sweetheard Jamia Nestor in March 2008 and he became the proud father of twin baby girls in September 2010.\n\n3. He currently is the rhythm guitarist for My Chemical Romance, and is the youngest member of the band. He was recruited after the band decided they needed another guitarist (in addition to Ray Toro) to fill out the sound. He also dropped out of college (and another band, Pencey Prep, scroll down for more) to pursue the band full time. Before he started playing with My Chemical Romance. Prior to joining My Chemical Romance Frank fronted Pencey Prep, he previouslly has also played with the bands Hybrid, Sector 12, and Give Up the Ghost. At the time when he joined My Chemical Romance, he had dreadlocks. Frank plays an Epiphone Elitist Les Paul Custom guitar with an Alpine White finish, among others. Frank has a penchant for naming his guitars such as \"Texas\", \"Bela\", \"Sinatra\", \"Angel\" and the one best known by fan was \"Pansy\". The demise of \"Pansy\" was long attributed to an unfortunate MTV Tech but it was later revealed that Frank had broken the guitar himself. Frank still has what is left of \"Pansy\".\n\n5. Frank has a lot of tattoos, he has the word \"HALLOWEEN\" tattooed on his fingers, a Jack O Lantern on his back, \"Keep the Faith\" on his upper back, the letters \"N.J.\" inside his lip standing for New Jersey, \"I wish I were a ghost\" around his right wrist, a dove on his left lower chest, an anchor on the lower part of his right bicep with an \"N\" and \"J\" on either side, a large chest piece, a scorpion on the right side of his neck and portraits of his grandparents on both arms to name but a few. Frank revealed in Life On The Murder Scene that he got the scorpion tattoo as high up on his body as he could once he decided that he didnâ€™t want a real job."
