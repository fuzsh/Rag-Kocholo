        "text": "My original project was supposed to be a poetry and/or creative writing blog, so I chose Frank Iero’s website as my mentor blog, because I absolutely have to include him in every single blog I create.\n\nI have, in a way, always been his ‘mentee’, from songwriting, stage appearance, general attitude and style.\n\nWhile an adventure to see perform or to speak to in person, Frank is fascinating online. While many artists choose to have public relations directors to craft and post on social media for them, Frank runs his Instagram page, Twitter account, and Tumblr-powered news blog simultaneously, enlightening the words with sentiments such as …\n\nOften Frank will mix personal and professional life on his social media, posting pictures of his dogs one minute and a banner for his upcoming concert the next.\n\nHe loves to interact with fans, for good or for bad.\n\nHis blog contains excerpts about important upcoming events, written in a very casual tone. Almost friend-to-friend.\n\nHe is working on a number of projects, from his mystifying new band, name yet to be revealed to the public (or yet to actually be named) to his podcast mentioned above.\n\nFrank gets a huge kick out of this situation he found himself in in 2009.\n\n“I was on tour [overseas] with My Chem at the time, and every time I turned around, there were Anti-American rallies. I wrote a song from the standpoint of the rest of the world. It wasn’t from my personal point of view–it was just from someone who sees warmongering going on. I wrote the song, and the title is as blatant as humanly possible, because I wanted it to be that way.”\n\nWith his band LEATHERMOUTH, Frank had written a song called “I Am Going to Kill the President of the United States of America” on their debut, and final, album XO. This was during the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\n“Iero says he’s not sure who it was, but opines that it was a British writer who contacted the Office of Homeland Security looking for a comment. […] ‘I had a long talk with the gentlemen of the Secret Service.’ [says Iero].”\n\nFrank is sincerely and honestly not a fan of the current president…\n\nbut at the time, the song was simply about perspective."
