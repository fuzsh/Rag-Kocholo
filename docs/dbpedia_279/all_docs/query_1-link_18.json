        "text": "Holiday’s career is cited to include significant complexity in regards to the standard social and cultural perspectives. The complexity of her life provides vital lessons on talent proliferation. Through Holiday, it is deducible that success in music depends on a variety of personal characteristics including self-determination, attitude, and one’s commitment to the career. Holiday made it in music owing to the love for music despite the limitations of her background ( Greene 18) . However, the misery of career affirms that social engagements posit potential impacts that can easily destruct the continuity of a singer’s determination in music ( Greene 19) . For instance, poor choice of social engagements facilitated the emergence of crucial miseries such as drug addiction and sexual abuse that fuelled her death. The unusual characteristics of her options are therefore cited as feasible lessons to the musicians in the present\n\nI grew up in Washington D.C with my dad’s recording studio in the basement. Day and night, I would hear the beats of R&B and jazz surfing up through the floorboards. My parent’s were always listening to everything from Motown to John Lennon, Broadway musicals to Otis Redding. I loved it all - Etta James, Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, The Supremes, Elvis, Billie Holiday, musicals. To this day, those musicians inspire me. The second I knew that I had to be a singer was the day I fell madly in\n\nSurprisingly, despite his mentality of seeing himself as the next great singer, Frank had some trouble singing at first. In his article, “Taking Sinatra Seriously”, Terry Teachout stated that Sinatra’s voice tended to sound a bit awkward, unaware, and uncomfortable in faster-paced songs; it would take around a decade for him to reach full vocal development (55). As a result, his friend Hank Sanicola prompted Frank to take singing lessons. One of Sinatra’s instructors was former Metropolitan Opera singer, John Quinlan. Quinlan had him do vocal exercises as well as pronunciation work: attempting to eliminate his Hoboken accent from songs. Fortunately, these lessons did work to Frank’s overall advantage; he felt much more confident with his singing, despite his old friends mocking him for sounding so proper (Kaplan 53).\n\nThis women Mandy Harvey has gave me the inspiration to make better music because of how she went on with a passion with roadblocks in her way, but that did not stop her. I see myself as entrepreneur so when I see the courage of Mandy harvey it inspires me to never be afraid, but to be creative. So overall what Mandy showed me is Deaf people are just as talented and creative as hearing people and all you need is\n\nThroughout my life, I have been taken by music. However, it was not until my 8th grade year in middle school that I realized that I could be a musician for the rest of my life. Before that, music just seemed like something to keep me out of trouble. I wasn’t the best player at that time, and I still knew very little about it all. How could something like that ever support someone? Still, it was the only talent that I could find any success in, and it was still very enjoyable, so I wanted to still give it a shot.\n\nOnce i got to highschool i started to take my music a little more serious. I feel like i can express myself in music, just speak my mind. I’ve been writing since i was 10 years old, and started realizing recently that i feel something different when it comes to music. I just write about anything, whether its a dream, what i’m feeling or even things going on in the world. When we look at people we dont look deep enough, This is who i\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, as Sinatra was commonly known, decided to start his solo career in 1942, after a brief period singing with Harry James and the Tommy Dorsey Band. Many well-known singers preceded him, such as Billy Holiday and Bing Crosby. None of these performers, however great, led completely self-sufficient careers of their own. Gardner attests that “Sinatra’s success cemented the notion of the interpretive singer as an autonomous musician – in service to the song but also owning it, at least for the duration of the performance”. Given the type of personality he possessed, this was not surprising. Frank had the “street-smarts”, the intelligence, drive, and talent to sustain a solo career.\n\n“I was determined to play my horn against all odds, and I had to sacrifice a whole lot of pleasure to do so.” Louis Armstrong said this and it shows the amount of dedication he had towards music. In a time of segregation he was born a kid in poverty, but over time he grew up to become the best jazz musician in the world. Louis Armstrong set goals for himself and developed into a major musical force as an innovator, trumpeter, singer, and entertainer. Armstrong had a neglectful mother and father. His father abandoned Armstrong leaving him with a irresponsible mother. To raise money Armstrong would sing in the street for pennies, and did odd jobs for a jewish family who in return took him in with their family.Growing up in New Orleans he loved listening to the many brass bands. These bands motivated him to buy his own cornet. In 1912 he shot a pistol into the sky, and immediately got him arrested.The court decided his mother was not capable of raising Armstrong, so they put him in “Waif’s Home for Orphans.” Life looked gloomy for the youngster but he was given hope as he eventually developed his love for music. Day after day he would continuously practice his instrument, soon making him the leader of Waif’s Band. Soon he developed the skills to work with legendary performers such as Joseph Oliver, and Kid Ory which made his reputation skyrocket in the music community. Heros stay devoted to their goals no matter how low the odds are in their life. This describes Louis Armstrong as he found motivation to improve his skills.\n\nFrom the day we’re in our mother's stomachs, to the day we die, we have always been listening to music. For me, listening to music all my life helped me develop a passion for it. When I was around the age of 6 my dad introduced me into the world of Rock. The very first band I remember listening to was System of a Down and ever since then, I fell in love with rock music and all its possible variations; for a long time this was all I listened to. It wasn’t until high school that I started listening to all sorts of genres and realized that I wanted to have a career in the music industry. That's when I learned about producing music.\n\nIn the past decade I have managed to produce several albums, and every such production has been a real learning moment for me. I learned the stages of production from the beginning, and most of all I knew the language I did not need to learn to understand and be moved by it- the language of music, a language full of emotion. To be truthful, the secrets of the profession were not known to me at first, but strong will and motivation can overcome any challenge."
