(we tend to not give ourselves that luxury often enough.)\n\nas i said, you may not know me, but my name is frank iero and i made these songs for you… and i believe that after these twelve tracks have echoed against your heart you will finally really know me. and deep down i suppose thats all we can ever really hope for.\n\nforever true, xofrnk\n\n• 27 October 2016 • 2,819 notes\n\nto whom it may concern…\n\ndearest frendz,\n\ni know by now most, if not all of you, have heard the news of our unfortunate accident in sydney last thursday… and also the fact that with heavy hearts we must cancel all upcoming tour dates for this year due to the severity of the injuries we sustained in that crash. we can’t thank you all enough for the overwhelming flood of love and support throughout this horrific ordeal. it’s truly been amazing, and has helped us to feel not so alone even though we are stranded so far from home. there is nothing we want more than to all heal and be able to get back to our families as quick as possible. it’s strange how an in an instant everything can change and we become fully aware of what is truly important. we have been through a lot this week …and i know none of us will ever be the same again.\n\nas a thank you for your love and understanding i’ve decided to release one of my favorite songs from our new record, Parachutes, a little bit early. Oceans is a song about accepting love even though you are unsure if you actually deserve it …and eventually letting it surround you and drowning in a sea of it. it feels fitting to our situation, and i hope it brings a smile to your beautiful faces.\n\ni am unsure of what the future holds, but at least i know that my friends and i have a future… and for now that is certainly good enough for me. so here’s to those that wish us well, and those who don’t …well they can certainly catch a sydney bus to hell.\n\nso until we meet again friends, hold the ones you love close and keep the faith.\n\nforever true xofrnk\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jD-cApWvDSI\n\n• 21 October 2016 • 1,639 notes\n\nPsyched to hit both sides of the road with our friends Taking Back Sunday in February… You can find these dates along with FIATP Russian Tour 2017 dates at www.frank-Iero.com/dates\n\n• 13 September 2016 • 206 notes\n\nNEW ALBUM ‘PARACHUTES’ 10/28\n\nParachutes are life saving devices. We rely on them to bring us back from the brink of death. Whether we fall or jump they are the only things keeping us alive. Such as with life, we are all just falling or plunging to an eventual end, but the love of my family and my ability to create art and music has always been my parachute.The act of living can be random and strange, beautiful and ugly at the same time and the only thing that is undeniably certain is eventually we are all gonna hit the ground. Some of us plummet at an incredible rate and it’s over in a flash, but some of us get saved and are able to enjoy the view for a little while….\n\nThis album is one of my parachutes. xo frnk.\n\nStream “I’m A Mess” on YouTube\n\nPre-Order on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/ParachutesIT\n\nStore/Vinyl: http://smarturl.it/ParachutesDC\n\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/ParachutesAZ\n\nNEW TOUR DATES ADDED / CLICK HERE\n\n• 7 September 2016 • 1,622 notes"
