        "text": "By Deb Draisin\n\nFrank Iero, now that his stint in My Chemical Romance is behind him, is nothing if not a man with 25 irons in the fire while the flames lick the ceiling. His current undertakings this year include a six month world tour, which commenced with two months in Russia, for the October release of “Parachutes,” the fledgling project of his latest outfit, Frank Iero and The Patience (which includes all members of frnkiero andthe cellabration, save for newcomer Alexander Paul, replacing Rob Hughes on bass.) He is also releasing a four-track EP entitled “Keep the Coffins Coming,” has contributed a track to the ACLU benefit album put together by Taking Back Sunday’s John Nolan entitled “Music For Everyone,” all while the patience recover from a terrible accident which almost claimed the lives of his bandmates – and it’s only April.\n\nFrank was sweet enough, as he always has been, to give JB a bit of his time this morning as the band gears up to hit the road next week, with their first stop being the iconic Music Hall of Williamsburg.\n\nQ: Good Morning, Frank – it’s been a while since we’ve spoken last - how are you doing?\n\nFrank: Good Morning, Deb. Yeah, it has. I’m great, thanks, and you?\n\nQ: I’m good. Tough year though, for both of us: death, accidents, insanity, lost wages.\n\nFrank: So just like every day, in other words (laughs.)\n\nQ: Point. Okay, first things first, since we’re both aficionados: best horror films to come out within the last decade?\n\nFrank: “Fun and Games” was fantastic.\n\nQ: Thank you, I’m gonna go check that out, because everything that I’ve watched is just awful. Like “Annabelle” had such high ratings – it was terrible.\n\nFrank: I’m so disappointed by every one of those movies. Like “The Conjuring,” all of those movies – they’re all fucking bullshit.\n\nQ: Awful. “American Horror Story” was awful. The only thing decent was “Lights Out,” that one was alright – you should check it out.\n\nFrank: I heard “Get Out” was really, really good.\n\nQ: Yeah, but here’s the thing: “Get Out” had some slasher stuff, but it’s more like a comedy. You think you’re going to get scared out of your wits, but you’re laughing the entire time. It’s kinda like a Freddy Kruger movie.\n\nFrank: Ah, okay – well, that doesn’t bum me out too much; I like the campiness. If somebody were to try and do that in a newer realm, that could get really dumb, but, for the most part, I can really appreciate camp.\n\nQ: All the Vincent Price shit was really, really good.\n\nFrank: Oh yeah, anything with Vincent Price, you can’t go wrong. Like “Last Man On Earth,” when he’s putting the stake in?\n\nQ: Oh, yeah!\n\nFrank: (laughing) You couldn’t cut an apple with the amount of force that he’s using. I love that fucking movie.\n\nQ: He was the master. There’s a scene in “Dr. Phibes Rises Again”where he’s eating fish through his tracheal hole. He starts choking on a bone, so he pulls it back out through the side of his neck. That will never be topped. The Hitchcock movies were also really good. What was the best classic, for you?\n\nFrank: Maybe “House on Haunted Hill” - I love that movie. The Universal stuff was fantastic, but I have a specific memory of watching “House on Haunted Hill” with my father as a kid.\n\nQ: Yeah, I used to watch with my dad too. We used to have Horror Saturdays.\n\nFrank: Totally, yeah. I definitely got to see a lot of shit that there’s no way I should have (laughs.) My dad went to go see “House on Haunted Hill” when he was a kid, and it scared him shitless. You know that scene where they have the skeleton go across on a cable?\n\nQ: I love that scene, it’s so fucking funny.\n\nFrank: So, they did that in the theater when it first came out, and people lost their fucking minds.\n\nQ: Yeah, they used to do things like that. Like that fifties alien movie, when they ran all this viral marketing on the radio, and people thought aliens were really landing.\n\nFrank: “War of the Worlds?”\n\nQ: I think that was it, yeah - I fucking love that shit. Speaking of Vincent Price, there was a scene in one his films where he addresses the audience directly - the one with the hand that comes to life by itself?\n\nFrank: Oh, was that “The Tingler?”\n\nQ: Pretty sure. The theater would turn all the lights off, and while Price is telling the audience “Nobody move, it’s amongst you!” the theater would zap them with buzzers underneath their seats. They don’t do shit like that anymore, Man.\n\nFrank: Nowadays, people would just have a heart attack and sue.\n\nQ: True, you’re probably right. So, let’s take a moment for this, since all of us parents love to crow about our kids: name one really cool thing about each of your little guys.\n\nFrank: I love how fearless they are to be themselves. That is one of the things that’s so precious about youth, you know? There’s no self-consciousness at this point; they just have this inherent weirdness that they’re not afraid to show.\n\nQ: Well, that’s you guys, too. If your parenting style allows them to express themselves, then they’ll feel comfortable doing so.\n\nFrank: I hope so. That’s the thing: once you smother that – if you snuff that out, then you’re in for a long haul of shit. We have our entire lives to feel self-conscious - you don’t need that at six.\n\nQ: No, but they’re fucking schoolmates will do that for you. Also, you know, the therapy bills will get really high once they start blaming you for everything that you sucked at. Now, considering the current unfortunate political climate, is it maybe time to resurrect “I Want to Kill the President?” You could give it another name, they won’t know.\n\nFrank: Oh, man…that was an expensive, expensive mistake (both laugh.)\n\nQ: Nobody prepares you for that, unfortunately.\n\nFrank: That kinda shit is funny if you’re a single person, but not if you have, like, kids and a wife - putting other people at risk, that’s not cool.\n\nQ: They don’t tell you these things when you become a grown-up.\n\nFrank: No, they don’t, it’s a shame. I should have been smarter about it.\n\nQ: You should have just given it another title – that’s all you had to do. They would have never known the difference; it’s artistic license.\n\nFrank: Well, you know, when you’re young, you don’t have any fear of anything.\n\nQ: And then they teach you really quickly that you definitely should. So, let’s talk about this EP that’s coming out, “Keep the Coffins Coming.”\n\nFrank: Once the touring for “Stomachaches” was over, I had a conversation with my manager, Paul, around January, and he was like “Alright, what do you want to do? What’s the next thing?” I really wasn’t sure just yet, so we had this discussion about bucket lists. I was writing a little bit, but I really didn’t know what the next record was going to be yet. It came up that I had always wanted to work with Steve Albini.\n\nWe called Steve, and he had like three days free, so we packed the cars up, and I drove out to Chicago and recorded this EP. The only songs that I had, as far as new stuff, was “I’m A Mess,” and this demo idea for “Veins.” “Veins” never got finished, but we recorded “Mess,” an alternate, full-band version of “Best Friends Forever,” “No Fun Club” and a cover version of “You Are My Sunshine.” So, those four songs are the EP.\n\nIt’s weird, though: I don’t consider that version of “Mess” to be a demo - it’s still a full version, just different than the LP version. When we went in with Ross, I didn’t know if we needed it, but I love it just as much. I love both versions the same, and I think it’s really cool to hear where that song started from, and then where it ended up. Both versions have validity, you know? That’s why releasing this EP made so much sense, I think – it’s such a bridge between “Stomachaches” and “Parachutes.”"
