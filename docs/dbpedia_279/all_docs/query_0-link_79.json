        "text": "Name: Frank Anthony Iero\n\nDate of Birth: October 31st, 1981 (HALLOWEEN! :D)\n\nHeight: 5'6\" or 5'7\"\n\nLivejournal: frankenmouth\n\nFamed for / How we might know him or her: Frank is the rhythm guitarist (sometimes backup vocals/scream) for My Chemical Romance. He is also the singer/lyricist for his side project Leathermouth (a post-hardcore punk band) and the founder and cerebellum (head honcho) of Skeleton Crew which is a clothing and publishing company as well as record label.\n\nTo what extent will he or she be 'AU'?: He will follow any and all tour schedules for both MCR and Leathermouth including studio time. However, I don't mind bending dates by a day or two from time to time if he's needed for another function.\n\nSexual Orientation/Preference: Heterosexual\n\nPlayer's preference for romantic or erotic SL's: Heterosexual although Frank has been known to kiss/make out with other guys (especially Gerard on stage) and I wouldn't be surprised that he'd follow that pattern here as well.\n\nBrief notes about your character's personality: Frank's well known for having incredibly strong family values. He loves his family more than anything and will do just about anything to protect them. He even has a tattoo of his grandfather on his left arm. He's friendly, appreciative, outgoing, and has a tendency towards mischief. Ever the prankster, no one is safe from him however everything is harmless fun. Frank will always speak his mind and always weigh his decisions as to what is right and wrong for him. He is opinionated but open-minded and all-around has a punk rock core.\n\nBrief history/background information: Born and raised in Belleville, New Jersey into a Catholic/Italian family, Frank is the only child of Frank (Cheech) and Linda Iero. His parents divorced when he was a meer 2 years old so he has always been fairly adjusted to the situation almost considering that the \"norm\" until he was old enough to understand. While growing up and getting better on guitar Frank was in many different bands starting when he was 11 years old. Most notably were the bands Pencey Prep and I Am A Graveyard, the two bands that Frank was part of directly prior to joining My Chemical Romance. He, as well as bandmate Mikey Way, dropped out of college to pursue full-time touring in My Chemical Romance and hasn't looked back since."
