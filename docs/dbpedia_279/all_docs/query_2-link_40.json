They’re all tagged with Frank/Gerard, but as far as I can tell most of them aren’t very shippy.\n\nGerard Has Mental Health Issues and Frank Comforts Him\n\nSchizophrenia {A Frerard Story} by Shadow_Hunter_8, 14k [WIP], Teen And Up Audiences. Gerard Way and Frank Iero have been dating since high school. Their lives seem perfect. Gerard is a comic book artist, while Frank works as a teacher. Their love for each other is so strong, they're sure that nothing can tear down their relationship. Then Gerard gets diagnosed with schizophrenia. Frank, having taken a psychology course in college, is determined to take care of Gerard instead of sending him to an institute. But as Gerard's condition worsens, will Frank be forced to admit that he isn't prepared to care for him?\n\nin paper armor by sweetchems, 9k [WIP], Teen And Up Audiences. Gerard Way doesn't know what the hell to do. His mind is a wreck that he can't handle half the time, with a bunch of locked away memories causing said wreckage. He needs help, but you couldn't pay him to see a shrink. So he gets the other kind of help. The kind that just... directly helps. Frank Iero is a free working caretaker who feels a bit like he's an all ages nanny. Doesn't mind the fact. It's good work, though he does tend to see his client-slash-patients shift into other care at their family's hands. Or get help. It makes him feel impressively job-well-done to see someone he cared for improve. His one surprise of a patient though is a certain Gerard Way, an agoraphobic artist with a mind that blocks out his past sufferings in any way it can hope to.\n\nPainfully Me by BasementVampire, 1k, Mature. In which Gerard is insecure and Frank is the sweetest boyfriend ever.\n\nBaby, Won't You Lock the Door? by BasementVampire, 879 words, Teen And Up Audiences. Frank comforts Gerard during a psychotic episode.\n\nThe Mess We've Made by ViciousVenin, 122k, Explicit. Gerard isn't sure where his life is going. It feels like the world is shifting and changing around him and he's stuck in place, unable to move forward. But when he meets a guy at a club who tells him he's meant for something better, Gerard wants to believe him, and suddenly he's taking steps he never thought he would.\n\nOff Month by orphan_account, 2k, Mature. Frank understands that if someone has depression, there will be times when they're blatantly miserable. Maybe they'll lock themselves away for a day or two, maybe a week. Maybe they go about their normal lives, but everything drags on longer and longer everyday until their mood boosts or the pills do their job again.\n\nLost Caves by trashanonymous, 8k [WIP], Explicit. Gerard's place of solitude is replaced with a dark, musty basement forced to follow his captors demands. Frank, a therapist, finds himself in charge of intergrating Gerard back into a world he's uneasy about rejoining.\n\nput away the pills (come waste away with me) by endlessnighttimesky, 2k, Teen And Up Audiences. It’s three days after Osaka that Gerard’s breaks down and tells Frank everything. He thinks that maybe he should’ve done it sooner, at least the telling-Frank-everything part, but then he thinks that, perhaps, this is how it should be.\n\nI'm Lying Here (In Despair) by thirstingdragon, 3k, Teen And Up Audiences. Gerard - who is in the beginning of his sobriety - thinks that things look bleak and dark. Frank tries to ease things if only for a moment."
