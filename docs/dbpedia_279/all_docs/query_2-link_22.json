        "text": "Three cheers for sweet allyship.\n\nFormer My Chemical Romance guitarist Frank Iero took to Twitter on Thursday, letting fans know he’s got a plan for some sweet new merch that not many musicians offer: chest binders.\n\nAlthough Iero admitted binders are something he knows “very little about,” he said fans had asked for binders so often that he wanted to make their requests a reality, and asked followers to send pictures and feedback about their favorite brands and styles.\n\n“I’ll see what’s available out there to make some of you smile a little more,” Iero finished.\n\nSince My Chemical Romance disbanded in 2013, Iero has formed several other groups, including the post hardcore band Leathermouth and his current project, Frank Iero and the Future Violents. Of course, he’s still maintained a dedicated following from his Black Parade days, and that definitely includes an army of emo transmascs who’d doubtless be thrilled to wear a binder Iero himself signed off on — even if they wouldn’t sport any MCR logos or branding (since those are still owned by Warner Media). And even folks who think they’re too cool for emo — and they aren’t — can probably appreciate the aesthetic of a binder with a barbed-wire heart across the chest.\n\nSome of Iero’s trans fans have already recommended he talk with gc2b, one of the most prominent manufacturers of chest binders. Others have asked that he not directly profit from sales to the trans community, and donate binder profits to trans organizations.\n\nOf course, it’s not even clear yet whether this project will make it out of Iero’s brain and into the real world, but it’s pretty rad that binders are slowly becoming less niche — which will hopefully make them cheaper, more comfortable, and easier to find for trans people who need them. Truly, Iero is bringing us binders, and we’re bringing him our love."
