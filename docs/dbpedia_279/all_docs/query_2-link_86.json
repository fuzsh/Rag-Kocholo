        "text": "Leathermouth (Frank Iero side project) play first show on current US tour\n\nDemolitionlove on LiveJournal has reviewed the first Leathermouth set on their current US tour with Reggie and the Full Effect:\n\n\"If you take one thing away from the Reggie & The Full Effect/Leathermouth shows, it's that James Dewees loves him some Miley Cryus and Frank has a lot of shit to be pissed off about although we're not quite sure what. Words cannot begin to describe how epic this show was.\n\nFrank wants us all to know that this is not fucking MCR shit (despite the beautiful fact that all their equipment is labeled with red tape that clearly says MCR and Revenge on it) and after asking for a show of hands of who was under 18, declared that having underage girls at a show is a new thing for him. He's so special. We also learned that Frank still has all his best kindergarten skills in tact despite his knack for wanting to burn you in your fucking house now. He loves to play and share with others... his hands, his mic and perhaps his spit. Frank Iero needs to work a little on his 'indoor voice' but we can make an exception just this once.\n\nThe show itself was clearly amazing and despite the wind and rain that pelted Leathermouth on their way to Florida and continued to fall during the show soaking all of us in line and on the way out the door, they managed to make it here and put on a fucking kick ass show. The Social, in Orlando, is a venue that wasn't meant for more than 300 people, maybe 400 so it was hard to wander around without running into someone incredibly wonderful in all their screaming glory. We all screamed because we couldn't hear a fucking thing but that's why it's so great. At some point, Frank promised that some day they'd out out a CD but it was blantantly obvious that with the way we were all screaming back, none of us were holding our breath for that to come to fruition.\n\nDressed all in white with t-shirts that they had made themselves with handwritten letters, that had you lined them up for mugshots would have spelled out MOUTH, they looked pure like the virgins we are sure they all are. Frank showed us just how virginal he claimed to be since he spent a good part of the show kneeling on stage. Could those screams be actual prayers to prevent him from being mobbed in the latter part of that show by the massive attack of the aforementioned underage girls? Sadly, no. God doesn't love thieves and when we caught a glimpse of Frank sporting sunglasses that looked much like Gerard Way's Starsky & Hutch lenses, we knew that he had either stole them from his MCR bandmate or Gerard had taught him well. The band sounded amazing. They were tight (random mention of pants is fleeting) and performed well together, especially for their first show of the tour.\n\nThe setlist was as follows:\n\nCatch Me If You can\n\nI'm Going to Kill the President of the United States of America\n\nSunsets are for Muggings\n\nBodysnatchers Forever\n\nLeviathan\n\n5th Period Massacre\n\nThis Song Is About Being Attacked By Monsters\n\nMy Love Note Has Gone Flat\n\nMurder Was the Case that they Gave Me\n\nYou can view pictures here:"
