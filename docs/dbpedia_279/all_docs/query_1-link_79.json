        "text": "Frank Iero and The Future Violents – A New Day’s Coming\n\nfrom the album, Barriers\n\nLet’s get deep. Like existential deep. But at the same time, let’s not talk about My Chemical Romance. So how do we do that? Well for starters, let’s head across the Delaware to New Jersey. The weather is currently decent and it’s a pretty damn good place to find good music. Okay, now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk briefly about Frank Iero‘s third solo album, Barriers. For those that ever wished for an album that is pure chaos in it’s alignment, Frank Iero and The Future Violents‘ Barriers is for you. It’s deliberately disorganized and expertly crafted with total precision. This is an album that doesn’t just live up to it’s name. Nope. It goes completely against it and destroys everything that word comes symbolize. It’s equal parts haunting, high energy, and visceral.\n\nToday’s song is the album opener of Barriers. It’s A New Day’s Coming. First off, Iero summoned himself a hell of an all-star band. You have: guitarist Evan Nestor, bassist Matt Armstrong (from the band, Murder by Death), drummer Tucker Rule (from the band, Thursday), and multi-instrumentalist Kayleigh Goldsworthy (from the band, Dave Hause and The Mermaid). That needed to be said because it’s this dream team/all star band backing him makes this song pretty cot damn amazing. A New Day’s Coming opens Barriers with a mid-tempo rocker that is more like a 1950’s ballad. A New Day’s Coming is quite literally the perfect opener both album-wise and if it were a pitcher on the Tampa Bay Rays, as it makes the punk that follows all the more interesting. It also throws the listener a curveball, as you aren’t expecting a song in that kind of style right off the bat. Usually a song or track like that is saved for the second half of the album, were it’s fine to experiment. It definitely gives the listener (and me for that matter) a false sense of security in that you’re expecting the rest of the album to be rather placid, lighthearted, and warm. Nope. Iero and Goldsworthy team up and harmonize perfectly together, creating a kind of warm and hopeful soundscape. Rule’s steady drumming, Armstrong’s thumping bass, and Nestor’s guitar riffs help power the song and helping to create contrast with the rest of the album… especially once Young & Doomed starts. A perfect opener.\n\nA new day’s coming… and it’s already arrived.\n\nGot Social Media?

But at the same time, let’s not talk about My Chemical Romance. So how do we do that? Well, for starters, let’s stay in New Jersey. The weather is currently decent and it’s a pretty damn good place to find good music. Okay, now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk about today’s song from the former (I guess, it’s back to being current) rhythm guitarist for My Chemical Romance, Frank Iero and his band, The Future Violents. “But Brian, you said, ‘let’s not talk about MCR!’” and we’re not. We’re talking about Frank Iero and The Future Violents. A very brief introduction, you already know who Iero is, but let’s meet his band. He assembled a veritable dream team/all star band of musicians backing him: guitarist Evan Nestor, bassist Matt Armstrong (from the band, Murder by Death), drummer Tucker Rule (from the band, Thursday), and multi-instrumentalist Kayleigh Goldsworthy (from the band, Dave Hause and The Mermaid). This all star band backing Iero, puts him in the Bryce Harper tier of singer-songwriters.\n\nI’ve mentioned many, many, times before that I am a fan of musical contrasts. Open an album with something light and gentle with hope and promise. Then heighten the contrast with something harder and crunchier… like today’s song, Young and Doomed from the album, Barriers.\n\nI promise that I’m not okay, oh wait, that’s the other guy\n\nWith that lyric of Young and Doomed, Iero triggered millions of MCR fans worldwide. Young and Doomed is about as raucous punk as can be. The music video for the song utilizes the collective use of silhouettes, projected imagery, as well as vibrant colors to channel the song’s acute rage. It definitely feels like an experimental punk anthem that was designed for those who are feeling the frustrations or the burdens of life in our current time. But let’s go back to the song’s music video for second. The existential crisis playing during the video for the song appears in the form of cameos of members of the band with their childhood portraits superimposed to distort their features. Let’s be honest, I think Iero just wanted to scare the shit out of the viewer for some shits and giggles.\n\nHEY WAIT A MINUTE… I THINK HE FORESAW MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE REUNITING!\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was released on May 31, 2019 through UNFD.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nLet’s get deep. Like existential deep. But at the same time, let’s not talk about My Chemical Romance. So how do we do that? Well, for starters, let’s stay in New Jersey. The weather is currently decent and it’s a pretty damn good place to find good music. Okay, now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk about today’s album from the former (I guess, it’s back to being current) rhythm guitarist for My Chemical Romance, Frank Iero and his band, The Future Violents. “But Brian, you said, ‘let’s not talk about MCR!'” and we’re not. We’re talking about Frank Iero and The Future Violents. A very brief introduction, you already know who Iero is, but let’s meet his band. He assembled a veritable dream team/all star band of musicians backing him: guitarist Evan Nestor, bassist Matt Armstrong (from the band, Murder by Death), drummer Tucker Rule (from the band, Thursday), and multi-instrumentalist Kayleigh Goldsworthy (from the band, Dave Hause and The Mermaid). This all star band backing Iero, helped him to create and craft his greatest solo work to date.\n\nI gotta say, this sounds nothing like previous offerings from Iero. However, it is just as good, if not better than his previous releases. What makes it interesting is the opening sequence of songs. Barriers opens with A New Day’s Coming, a mid-tempo rocker that is more like a 1950’s ballad. But it’s A New Day’s Coming that makes the punk that follows all the more interesting. A New Day’s Coming is definitely a good track. It sets up the following tracks perfectly. It also throws the listener a curveball, as you aren’t expecting a song in that kind of style right off the bat. Usually a song or track like that is saved for the second half of the album, were it’s fine to experiment. It definitely gives the listener (and me for that matter) a false sense of security in that you’re expecting this album to be lighthearted and warm. Nope. Iero and Goldsworthy harmonize perfectly together, creating this kind of hopeful and warm soundscape. A steady drumbeat, thumping bass, and bluesy rhythm guitar riff help power this song. Once again, it’s that contrast I love. Opening with such hopeful and gentle promises only heightens that contrast with the rest of the album, especially once Young and Doomed begins.\n\nI promise that I’m not okay, oh wait, that’s the other guy\n\nWith that lyric of Young and Doomed, Iero triggered millions of MCR fans worldwide. Young and Doomed is about as raucous punk as can be. The music video for the song utilizes the collective use of silhouettes, projected imagery, as well as vibrant colors to channel the song’s acute rage. It definitely feels like an experimental punk anthem that was designed for those who are feeling the frustrations or the burdens of life in our current time. But let’s go back to the song’s music video for second. The existential crisis playing during the video for the song appears in the form of cameos of members of the band with their childhood portraits superimposed to distort their features. Let’s be honest, I think Iero just wanted to scare the shit out of the viewer for some shits and giggles.\n\nYoung and Doomed crashes right into Fever Dream. It’s like someone having a fever during a nightmare. A screaming and wailing guitar riff completely overrides Iero’s guttural and gritty scream before it slides into a low whine. It’s very Nirvana-esque in that, it is something unexpected that works incredibly well within the context of the album. Both Young and Doomed and Fever Dream have subdued charms about them, but manage bursts of frenzied energy which keep the listener on their toes. There’s Moto-Pop which channels some of the punk forefathers of the 1970s. Moto-Pop has this effortless swagger about it. Definitely an album highlight.\n\nOne of things that Barriers does excellently is that there is such a wide and diverse variety of styles and sounds found throughout the tracks. None of them can be pigeonholed exactly into one genre. It’s definitely an album that is a rollercoaster and the ride is through Iero’s brain. Iero hasn’t forgotten his roots from his work in earlier bands. Nope. His vocals on this album are like butter: smooth and textured. This is no more evident than on The Unfortunate and the cleverly titled Medicine Square Garden, which sit in the geographic center of the album.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor those that ever wished for an album that is pure chaos in it’s alignment, Frank Iero and The Future Violents‘ Barriers is for you. It’s deliberately disorganized and expertly crafted with total precision. This is an album that doesn’t just live up to it’s name. Nope. It goes completely against it and destroys everything that word comes symbolize. It’s equal parts haunting, high energy, and visceral. It’s a lyrically dense and sonically expansive album that highlight’s Iero’s evolution and growth as a musician and songwriter. Backed by an all-star cast of musicians, Frank Iero delivers his best to date.\n\nHEY WAIT A MINUTE… I THINK HE FORESAW MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE REUNITING!\n\nGot Social Media?
