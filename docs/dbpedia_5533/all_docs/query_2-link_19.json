He studied at universities in Paris, Berlin, and Leipzig. He served in the infantry during the First World War, ultimately becoming a captain and receiving the National Order of the Legion of Honour. After the war, he taught at the University of Strasbourg, and then at the Sorbonne in Paris. When the Second World War broke out, Bloch again took up his position as captain in the French military. When France was defeated by Germany, Bloch joined the French Resistance. After being captured by the German secret police in 1944, Bloch was tortured and finally executed.\n\nBloch co-founded the Annales School with colleague Lucien Febvre in 1929. This new approach took a sweeping view of history and considered the effect of collective mentalities, an approach Bloch had previously explored in his 1924 work, The Royal Touch: Sacred Monarchy and Scrofula in England and France, on the popular belief in a monarch’s ability to cure scrofula through touch. In other works, Bloch examined rural French life and the impact of technology over the longue durée (the long term). During the Second World War, Bloch worked on a manuscript about the role of the historian – published posthumously in English as The Historians’ Craft –but it was left unfinished upon his death.\n\nImportant Works:\n\nThe Royal Touch: Sacred Monarchy and Scrofula in England and France (1924)\n\nFrench Rural History (1931)\n\nStrange Defeat: A Statement of Evidence Written in 1940 (1940)\n\nThe Historians’ Craft (1949)\n\nFernand Braudel\n\n(24 August 1902 – 27 November 1985)\n\nFernand Braudel was a French historian and one of the key contributors to the Annales School.

Butterfield was a professor at Cambridge from 1928 until his death. He held the prestigious position of Regius Professor of Modern History there from 1963-8. In 1968, Butterfield received a knighthood in recognition for his historical accomplishments.\n\nButterfield’s The Whig Interpretation of History, published early in his career in 1931, was his best-known work and, informed by his own conservative political views, was critical of the approach of some liberal historians who saw history as a straight-line narrative leading to the present liberal order. Butterfield’s interests extended widely: he also wrote about the development of modern science and – influenced by his devout Christian views – the history of Christianity.\n\nImportant Works:\n\nThe Whig Interpretation of History (1931)\n\nThe Englishman and His History (1944)\n\nThe Origins of Modern Science, 1300-1800 (1949)\n\nChristianity and History (1949)\n\nMoral Judgments in History (1959)\n\nWilliam Camden\n\n(2 May 1551 – 9 November 1623)\n\nWilliam Camden was an English historian and antiquarian who, through his access to the State Papers, wrote the first history of Elizabeth I’s reign.

Carr\n\n(28 June 1892 – 3 November 1982)\n\nEdward Hallett Carr was born in London and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a degree in Classics. Carr joined the British Foreign Office after his graduation in 1916. In this position, which he held for 20 years, Carr was able to see first-hand the end of the First World War, the emergence of the Soviet Union, and the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany. Over this time, Carr became increasingly fascinated with Russian culture and was impressed by what he saw in his visits to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1936, Carr left the Foreign Office to take up a position at the University of Aberystwyth as a professor of international politics. During the Second World War, Carr was a commentator and encouraged accommodation with the Soviet Union. He left Aberystwyth in 1947 and had only a brief stint at Oxford from 1953-5; otherwise Carr’s softer views on the Soviet Union made him somewhat of a pariah. It was this interest in the Soviet Union that led Carr to conduct his research into its history, leading to the fourteen-volume, A History of Soviet Russia (1950-1978). Carr’s work made other scholars realise that the study of the Soviet Union was a legitimate pursuit. Carr’s other noted work, What is History? (1961), criticised recent trends in historiography: he disputed the supposed objectivity of historical facts, but also argued that history is deterministic and counterfactual history is a futile exercise.\n\nImportant Works:\n\nThe Twenty Years Crisis, 1919-1939: An Introduction to the Study of Foreign Relations (1939)\n\nA History of Soviet Russia (14 volumes) (1950-1978)\n\nThe New Society (1951)\n\nWhat is History?

Gibbon started with one major question {-} what caused such a mighty empire to collapse? {-} and he embarked on his reading of the historical records with that question always in view. His conclusion, that it was due in large part to the debilitating effects of Christianity, was in line with the radical thinking of the Enlightenment but created a storm of public controversy. © Bridgeman Art Library/Private collection.\n\nEdward Gibbon\n\n(8 May (Old Style: 27 April) 1737 – 16 January 1794)\n\nEdward Gibbon was an English historian and Member of Parliament.

Hobsbawm\n\n(9 June 1917 – 1 October 2012)\n\nEric John Hobsbawm was born in Alexandria, Egypt to a Jewish family. In his youth, Hobsbawm and his family lived in Austria and Germany, and moved to England in 1933, when Hitler came to power. He received his PhD from Cambridge University for his dissertation on the Fabian Society and, after serving in the engineer corps during the Second World War, Hobsbawm went on to work primarily at Birbeck, University of London. Hobsbawm was active in left-wing politics throughout his life, remaining a member of the Communist Party until just before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, when he opted not to renew his membership.\n\nHobsbawm’s most famous works are his trilogy about the long nineteenth century (1789-1914) – a term he coined – and one on the short twentieth (1914-1991). His Marxist approach to history led to one of his key innovations, the idea that the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution (in Britain) should be treated as the political and economic halves of a ‘dual revolution’, making way for the rise of liberal capitalism in the nineteenth century. Hobsbawm was also a cultural critic and coined the term ‘invented traditions,’ traditional or national myths supposedly of ancient origin but actually quite recent, in his 1983 work, co-edited with T.O. Ranger, The Invention of Tradition.\n\nImportant Works:\n\nThe Age of Revolution: Europe 1789-1848 (1962)\n\nThe Age of Capital: 1848-1875 (1975)\n\nThe Invention of Tradition (1983, co-edited with T.O.

Marx was born into a wealthy, middle-class family and attended the University of Bonn and the University of Berlin. At university, Marx became interested in G.W.F. Hegel’s theory of dialectical materialism and established himself among German radicals, most importantly Friedrich Engels. He was awarded a PhD from the University of Jena in 1841, but was unable to secure a position given his political and anti-religious views. Due to his radicalism, he was forced to leave Germany and he sought refuge in various European countries, eventually settling in England in 1849, where he continued his advocacy for communism.\n\nMarx wrote one of his most important works, The Communist Manifesto, in 1848 in Belgium with Engels. This work laid out Marx’s theory of history as a series of class struggles, which would eventually culminate with the victory of the proletariat (working-class) and the creation of socialism. He published the first volume of his masterwork, Capital, in 1867, which further analysed and critiqued the capitalist system. The remaining two volumes would be assembled from Marx’s notes by Engels after his friend’s death.\n\nImportant works:\n\nThe Communist Manifesto (1848)\n\nThe Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852)\n\nCapital, Volume 1 (1867)\n\nCapital, Volume 2 (1885)\n\nCapital, Volume 3 (1894)\n\nSir Lewis Namier\n\nSir Lewis Namier\n\n(27 June 1888 – 19 August 1960)\n\nLewis Bernstein Namier was born Ludwik Niemirowski in what was then the Russian Empire, but is now in Poland, to a secular Jewish family. Namier was educated at the University of Lvov (in what is now Ukraine), the University of Lausanne (in Switzerland), the London School of Economics, and Balliol College, Oxford. He immigrated to the UK in 1907 and anglicised his name in 1913, at the same time he became a British subject. Namier fought in the First World War, but was discharged due to his poor eyesight. He continued to serve in a variety of capacities throughout the war and was a member of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. After the war, Namier taught briefly at Balliol College, and later at the University of Manchester from 1931 to 1953.\n\nNamier’s most important work concerns his use of prosopography, or collective biography, to uncover the workings of the eighteenth-century British Parliament. By examining the biography of every Member of Parliament during that century, Namier analysed their motivations and interests to uncover that the Tory and Whig Parties were far from monolithic groups, but rather were shifting coalitions on various issues. Namier also examined wills, tax records, and memberships of various MPs to further understand their goals.\n\nImportant Works:\n\nThe Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III (1929)\n\nEngland in the Age of the American Revolution (1930)\n\n1848: The Revolution of the Intellectuals (1946)\n\nDiplomatic Prelude, 1938-39 (1948)\n\nThe House of Commons, 1754-1790 (3 volumes) (1964, co-edited with John Brooke)\n\nLeopold von Ranke\n\nLeopold von Ranke\n\n(21 December 1795 – 23 May 1886)\n\nLeopold von Ranke was born in Wiehe, Saxony (in modern Germany). Ranke studied theology and ancient history at the University of Leipzig. Ranke, born into a devout Lutheran family, studied history in order to see the working of God in great historical events. On the strength of his 1824 book, History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514 (which contained his famous maxim to show ‘how things actually were’), and after eight years of teaching Classics at a secondary school, Ranke became a professor at the University of Berlin in 1825.\n\nIt was at Berlin where Ranke developed the seminar method of teaching and disseminated his ideas about the objective study of history through careful evaluation of primary sources. He wrote a number of multi-volume histories of large topics over long time periods, including the history of the papacy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Reformation in Germany, and his final work, a six-volume history of the world, which was left incomplete at his death. Ranke was also a conservative thinker. He wrote various works defending the established order in the German states and rejected any talk of revolution.

As a teenager, Samuel joined the Communist Party (but left the party in 1856 over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Hungary). He studied history at Balliol College, Oxford University, where he was involved in the Communist Party Historians’ Group, which included a number of prominent Marxist historians. In 1962, he became a tutor at Ruskin College, Oxford University, and taught there until his death in 1996. He established the East London History Centre (since renamed the Raphael Samuel Centre) at the University of East London in 1995.\n\nSamuel was keenly interested in social history and in 1967 established the History Workshop movement at Ruskin that emphasised ‘history from below’ and a democratic approach to history which flouted academic distinctions and encouraged collaboration between professional and amateur historians. He also played an important role in launching the History Workshop Journal in 1975. Samuel’s historical work focused on the experience of working people in Britain and left-wing politics.\n\nImportant works:\n\nVillage Life and Labour (1975)\n\nTheatres of Memory, Volume 1: Past and Present in Contemporary Culture (1994)\n\nIsland Stories: Unravelling Britain: Theatres of Memory, Volume 2 (1998)\n\nThe Lost World of British Communism (2006)\n\nThrough his popular works and TV programmes, Simon Schama is one of the leading public historians.\n\nSimon Schama\n\n(13 February 1945 –)\n\nSimon Schama is an English historian who focuses on art history and European history.

H. Tawney\n\nR.H. Tawney\n\n(30 November 1880 – 16 January 1962)\n\nRichard Henry Tawney was born in Kolkata (Calcutta), India, then still part of the British Empire. Tawney was educated at Rugby School and then Balliol College, Oxford University, where he studied modern history. Following his graduation in 1903, Tawney lived at Toynbee Hall, a centre for social outreach to the working classes and home to the Workers’ Educational Association. Here he combined his strong Christian faith with a growing belief that simple philanthropy was inadequate and that deeper social change was required to assist the poor. As a Christian Socialist, Tawney was active in various left-wing political causes and ran three times (all unsuccessfully) for a seat in Parliament as a member of the Labour Party.\n\nTawney was a lecturer and later professor at the London School of Economics from 1917 until 1949, after which time he was a Professor Emeritus. His works reflected his interest in the rise of capitalism and his advocacy for social change. Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, perhaps his most important work, decried how the growth of capitalism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries seemed to put the pursuit of material wealth ahead of Christian social morality. This concern is also reflected in other works, which critiqued the selfishness Tawney saw as inherent in capitalism and provided a framework for greater social equality.\n\nImportant works:\n\nThe Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century (1912)\n\nThe Acquisitive Society (1920)\n\nSecondary Education for All (1922)\n\nReligion and the Rise of Capitalism (1926)\n\nEquality (1931)\n\nE.P. Thompson\n\n(3 February 1924 – 28 August 1993)\n\nEdward Palmer Thompson was born in Oxford and, leaving school early in 1941, enlisted to fight in the Second World War, serving in the Italian campaign. After the war, Thompson went to study at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where – as a member of the Communist Party – he would form the Communist Party Historians; Group, which included other important historians like Christopher Hill and Eric Hobsbawm. The group would launch the influential journal, Past and Present, in 1952. Like many other communists, Thompson broke with the party over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Hungary in 1956.\n\nThompson’s most important contribution, The Making of the English Working Class, was published in 1963. In this work, Thompson sought to uncover voices previously overlooked by historians. He examined the English working class from 1780 to 1832 and investigated their development of a class-consciousness. Far from a deterministic process, Thompson emphasised the agency of individuals in shaping this consciousness. Thompson taught at Warwick University until 1971, when he broke with the university for what he saw as the commercialisation of higher education. He worked mainly as a freelance writer from that time and was also at the forefront of the peace movement and the campaign for nuclear disarmament in Britain.\n\nImportant Works:\n\nWilliam Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary (1955)\n\nThe Making of the English Working Class (1963)\n\nWriting by Candlelight (1980)\n\nDouble Exposure (1985)\n\nWitness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law (1993)\n\nG.

She studied at Harvard University and the University of Michigan, where she received her doctorate. In the 1950s, Davis and her husband both encountered difficulties because of their left-wing political activities, both having their passports confiscated for a time. Davis has taught at Brown University, University of California Berkeley, Princeton University, and currently is a professor at the University of Toronto.\n\nDavis incorporated the techniques of various disciplines, including anthropology and literary theory, into her works on social and cultural history, often using new ways to highlight marginalised voices. Her best-known work, The Return of Martin Guerre (1983), came out of her experience working as a historical consultant on a French film of the same name in 1982 and examined a case of identity theft in a sixteenth-century French village as a window into wider conceptions of personal identity. For her innovative work, Davis has received numerous awards including the National Humanities Medal, awarded in 2012 by President Barack Obama, and she became a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2010.\n\nImportant Works:\n\nSociety and Culture in Early Modern France (1975)\n\nThe Return of Martin Guerre (1983)\n\nFiction in the Archives: Pardon Tales and their Tellers in Sixteenth-Century France (1987)\n\nWomen on the Margins: Three Seventh-Century Lives (1995)\n\nSlaves on Screen: Film and Historical Vision (2002)\n\nTrickster Travels: A Sixteenth-Century Muslim between Worlds (2006)"
