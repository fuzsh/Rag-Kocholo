        "text": "With the efflorescence of palaeoscientific approaches to the past, historians have been confronted with a wealth of new evidence on both human and natural phenomena, from human disease and migration to landscape change and climate. These new data require a rewriting of our narratives of the past, questioning what constitutes an authoritative historical source and who is entitled to recount history to contemporary societies. Humanities-based historical inquiry must embrace this new evidence, but to do so historians need to engage with it critically, just as they do with textual and material sources. This article highlights the most vital methodological issues, ranging from the spatiotemporal scales and heterogeneity of the new evidence to the new roles attributed to quantitative methods and the place of scientific data in narrative construction. It considers areas of study where the palaeosciences have “intruded” into fields and subjects previously reserved for historians, especially socioeconomic, climate, and environmental history. The authors argue that active engagement with new approaches is urgently needed if historians want to contribute to our evolving understanding of the challenges of the Anthropocene.\n\n4 Though there have been earlier phases of such interest within the discipline of history, in particular in the context of the Annales school. See, for instance, “History and Climate: Interdisciplinary Explorations,” special issue, Journal of Interdisciplinary History 10, no. 4 (1980). The contemporary phase addressed in the present article is distinguished by huge advances in the scope, accuracy, and precision of the data now provided by the natural sciences, but also by access to historical archives on an unprecedented scale thanks to digitization and new methods of content analysis.\n\n5 Recent examples include Nicholas P. Dunning, Timothy P. Beach, and Sheryl Luzzadder-Beach, “Kax and Kol: Collapse and Resilience in Lowland Maya Civilization,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, no. 10 (2012): 3652–57; Steven Hartman et al., “Medieval Iceland, Greenland, and the New Human Condition: A Case Study in Integrated Environmental Humanities,” Global and Planetary Change 156 (2017): 123–39; Amorim et al. “Understanding 6th-Century Barbarian Social Organization”; Joseph R. McConnell et al., “Lead Pollution Recorded in Greenland Ice Indicates European Emissions Tracked Plagues, Wars, and Imperial Expansion during Antiquity,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 115, no. 22 (2018): 5726–31; Dan Penny et al., “Geoarchaeological Evidence from Angkor, Cambodia, Reveals a Gradual Decline Rather than a Catastrophic 15th-Century Collapse,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116, no. 11 (2019): 4871–76.\n\n7 One of the most classical applications of the climate history model is Christian Pfister and Rudolf Brázdil, “Social Vulnerability to Climate in the ‘Little Ice Age’: An Example from Central Europe in the Early 1770s,” Climate of the Past 2, no. 2 (2006): 115–29. For the “feedback” approach, see for instance the introductions to Richard C. Hoffmann, An Environmental History of Medieval Europe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014); and Verena Winiwarter and Martin Knoll, Umweltgeschichte. Eine Einführung (Cologne: Bölau, 2007).\n\n12 Spearman’s correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. The Spearman rank correlation test does not carry any assumptions about the distribution of the data (unlike the Pearson correlation, which requires normally distributed variables) and is the appropriate correlation analysis when the variables are measured on a scale that is at least ordinal. Spearman’s correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1. The sign of the coefficient indicates whether it is a positive or negative monotonic relationship. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. A negative correlation signifies that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. Values close to −1 or +1 represent stronger relationships than values closer to zero.\n\n21 The “question of scale” was one of the major concerns during the “crisis” of the Annales in the 1980s; see “Histoire et sciences sociales. Un tournant critique ?” Annales HSS 43, no. 2 (1988): 291–93. For a fuller treatment of the debate over micro vs. macro scales of analysis in French historiography, see Jacques Revel, “Micro-analyse et construction du social,” in Jeux d’échelles. La micro-analyse à l’expérience, ed. Jacques Revel (Paris: Gallimard/Éd. du Seuil, 1996), 15–36; Revel, “Paysage par gros temps,” in La forza delle incertezze. Dialoghi storiografici con Jacques Revel, ed. Antonella Romano and Silvia Sebastiani (Bologna: Il Mulino, 2016), 353–69.\n\n22 Such approaches have also been pioneered within the broader tradition of the Annales school, if we consider the work of the Genoa-based Laboratory of Environmental History and Archaeology led by Diego Moreno. In this case, detailed historical work, particularly in the field of historical geography, provides a new basis for the interpretation of archaeological finds and palaeoenvironmental data. See, for instance, Giulia Beltrametti et al., “Les cultures temporaires, entre longue durée et chronologie fine (Montagne ligure, Italie),” in Cultures temporaires et féodalité. Les rotations culturales et l’appropriation du sol dans l’Europe médiévale et moderne, ed. Christine Rendu and Roland Viader (Toulouse: Presses universitaires du Midi, 2014), 235–58; Valentina Pescini, Carlo Alessandro Montanari, and Diego Teodorico Moreno, “Multi-Proxy Record of Environmental Changes and Past Land Use Practices in a Mediterranean Landscape: The Punta Mesco Cape (Liguria – Italy) between the 15th and 20th Century,” Quaternary International 463 (2018): 376–90.\n\n24 The most comprehensive were probably two studies focused on the late antique world: Michael McCormick et al., “Climate Change during and after the Roman Empire: Reconstructing the Past from Scientific and Historical Evidence,” Journal of Interdisciplinary History 43, no. 2 (2012): 169–220; and John Haldon et al., “The Climate and Environment of Byzantine Anatolia: Integrating Science, History and Archaeology,” Journal of Interdisciplinary History 45, no. 2 (2014): 113–61. Another well-known example is Büntgen et al., “Cooling and Societal Change during the Late Antique Little Ice Age.” The survey-type approach can also be deployed on a larger scale, even within a historical monograph, as demonstrated by Adam Izdebski, A Rural Economy in Transition: Asia Minor from Late Antiquity into the Early Middle Ages (Warsaw: Taubenschlag Foundation, 2013). A recent example of a large-scale application of this approach is Lee Mordechai et al., “The Justinianic Plague: An Inconsequential Pandemic?” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116, no. 51 (2019): 25546–54.\n\n26 There are numerous examples of such situations. For instance, a study presenting a record of lead pollution in a Greenland ice core—most probably related to silver production in Iberia and France during antiquity and the early Middle Ages—was broadly promoted as a reconstruction of Roman GDP, even though the study itself did not go beyond inferences about Roman economic growth (McConnell et al., “Lead Pollution Recorded in Greenland Ice”). Perhaps even more revealing is the career of the “Digitizing Historical Plague” dataset made available in 2012 by a team consisting predominantly of climate scientists: the dataset is based on a positivistic reading of an incomplete and western Europe-focused catalog of late medieval and early modern plague outbreaks published in the 1970s, not meant to be used as a complete quantitative dataset on European plague in preindustrial times. See Ulf Büntgen et al., “Digitizing Historical Plague,” Clinical Infectious Diseases 55, no. 11 (2012): 1586–88, based on Jean-Noël Biraben, Les hommes et la peste en France et dans les pays européens et méditerranéens, 2 vols. (Paris/The Hague: Éd. EHESS/Mouton, 1975). Since its publication, and especially since March 2020, this dataset has served as the basis for many papers on the epidemiology, demography, economic impacts, etc., of the Black Death and later outbreaks of plague in Europe.\n\n32 This is true as long as we consider only the chronology of their issuing: coins could remain in use for much longer periods and it is difficult to provide a general estimate for how long they might circulate. For further discussion, see Marcus Phillips, “Currency in Seventh-Century Syria as a Historical Source,” Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 28, no. 1 (2004): 13–31.\n\n33 As the authors observe, this may have been linked to Sicily’s decreasing agricultural productivity, so central to the interests of the imperial government in its struggle for survival against the caliphate: Sadori et al., “Climate, Environment and Society in Southern Italy,” 182. See also John Haldon, “Some Thoughts on Climate Change, Local Environment, and Grain Production in Byzantine Northern Anatolia,” in Izdebski and Mulryan, Environment and Society in the Long Late Antiquity, 200–206.\n\n36 These sources can nevertheless exhibit biases. For instance, they often fail to capture longer-term changes in background average climate conditions, especially if such trends occur over or beyond the lifespan of individual observers, as noted by Raymond S. Bradley and Philip D. Jones, introduction to Climate since A.D. 1500, ed. Raymond S. Bradley and Philip D. Jones (London: Routledge, 1995), 1–16; and M. J. Ingram, D. J. Underhill, and G. Farmer, “The Use of Documentary Sources for the Study of Past Climates,” in Climate and History: Studies in Past Climates and Their Impact on Man, ed. T. M. L. Wigley, M. J. Ingram, and G. Farmer (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), 180–213. Indeed, a similar challenge is faced when reconstructing long-term changes over centuries and millennia from tree-ring samples that individually span smaller segments of time: Edward R. Cook et al., “The ‘Segment Length Curse’ in Long Tree-Ring Chronology Development for Palaeoclimatic Studies,” The Holocene 5, no. 2 (1995): 229–37.\n\n39 A scarcity that has long been noted: Hubert H. Lamb, Climate, History and the Modern World (London: Routledge, 1995). For prominent examples of such usage, see Michael McCormick, Paul E. Dutton, and Paul A. Mayewski, “Volcanoes and the Climate Forcing of Carolingian Europe, A. D. 750–950,” Speculum 82, no. 4 (2007): 865–95 (as well as the statistical appendix by Nick Patterson); and Christian Pfister et al., “Winter Air Temperature Variations in Western Europe during the Early and High Middle Ages (AD 750–1300),” The Holocene 8, no. 5 (1998): 535–52.\n\n58 Allowing for some small uncertainties in revolt onset and eruption date. Experimentation with a fuller (though potentially less accurate) list of possible revolt onsets was also conducted and a statistically significant association still observed. See Francis Ludlow and Joseph G. Manning, “Revolts under the Ptolemies: A Paleoclimatological Perspective,” in Revolt and Resistance in the Ancient Classical World and the Near East: The Crucible of Empire, ed. John J. Collins and Joseph G. Manning (Leiden: Brill, 2016), 154–71.\n\n66 This problem extends beyond historical climatology. For instance, in the context of the proliferation of histoire sérielle (quantitative history) in twentieth-century French historiography, several major figures remarked on the “impossibility of concluding” (l’impossibilité de conclure). This term was used by Bernard Lepetit in a review article from 1989, in which he refers to earlier quantitative historians such as François Furet, who had made the same observation two decades before: Bernard Lepetit, “L’histoire quantitative. Deux ou trois choses que je sais d’elle,” Histoire & mesure 4, no. 3/4 (1989): 191–99, here p. 193. This observation resembles more recent critiques of the “cliometric” approach in economic history: see Francesco Boldizzoni, The Poverty of Clio: Resurrecting Economic History (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011). The cliometricians (economic historians focused solely on analyzing quantitative data from the past) have been accused of being inconclusive or at times forcing a priori theories on the historical evidence before analyzing the data itself.\n\n69 Richard B. Stothers and Michael R. Rampino, “Volcanic Eruptions in the Mediterranean before AD 630 from Written and Archaeological Sources,” Journal of Geophysical Research 88, no. B8 (1983): 6357–71, brought together and recontextualized four writers from the late antique Mediterranean, each of whom made incidental reference to strange climatic and meteorological disturbances that, when taken together, suggested the existence of a powerful volcanic eruption. Signs of post-eruption cooling in the tree-ring data were found by M. G. L. Baillie, “Dendrochronology Raises Questions about the Nature of the AD 536 Dust-Veil Event,” The Holocene 4, no. 2 (1994): 212–17. Apparent dating discrepancies were resolved in Sigl et al., “Timing and Climate Forcing of Volcanic Eruptions.” For a recent overview, see Newfield, “The Climate Downturn of 536–50,” 452–63.\n\n71 Stothers and Rampino, “Volcanic Eruptions in the Mediterranean before AD 630.” A global perspective on the eruption, from Yucatán to China, is found in the papers collected in Gunn, The Years without Summer: without the volcanic framework, there would be little to tie together such varied subjects as Roman epistolography and Mayan hydraulics. Cassiodorus’s account of the 536 event is discussed in both its climatic and philosophical contexts in Harper, The Fate of Rome, 251–52, with a broader discussion of the event at pp. 249–59. The bibliography on the 536 event is both vast and steadily accumulating. For more references, see recent works by Kyle Harper and Timothy Newfield.\n\n88 Czerwiński et al., “Environmental Implications of Past Socioeconomic Events.” Note that the same research team has demonstrated that large-scale colonization with a profound ecological impact could also occur within one generation, in special circumstances when the financial and institutional capacities were available. See Mariusz Lamentowicz et al., “How Joannites’ Economy Eradicated Primeval Forest and Created Anthroecosystems in Medieval Central Europe,” Scientific Reports 10, no. 1 (2020): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75692-4.\n\n96 Of course, such approaches have made their way into the discipline of history, where they have attracted much public attention. See, for instance, Ronnie Ellenblum, The Collapse of the Eastern Mediterranean: Climate Change and the Decline of the East, 950–1072 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012); and in particular Harper, The Fate of Rome.\n\n98 There are many definitions of resilience, but “the tendency to understand resilience as resistance to change is ubiquitous in the literature”: Lennart Olsson et al., “Why Resilience Is Unappealing to Social Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations of the Scientific Use of Resilience,” Science Advances 1, no. 4 (2015): http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1400217, here p. 2.\n\n99 Inter alia, see Adam Izdebski, Lee Mordechai, and Sam White, “The Social Burden of Resilience: A Historical Perspective,” Human Ecology 46, no. 3 (2018): 291–303; Elena Xoplaki et al., “Modelling Climate and Societal Resilience in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Last Millennium,” Human Ecology 46, no. 3 (2018): 363–79; Xoplaki et al., “The Medieval Climate Anomaly and Byzantium: A Review of Evidence on Climatic Fluctuations, Economic Performance and Societal Change,” Quaternary Science Reviews 136 (2016): 229–52; Xoplaki et al., “Hydrological Changes in Late Antiquity: Spatio-Temporal Characteristics and Socio-Economic Impacts in the Eastern Mediterranean,” in Climate Change and Ancient Societies in Europe and the Near East: Diversity in Collapse and Resilience, ed. Paul Erdkamp, Joseph G. Manning, and Koenraad Verboven (Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2021), 533–60; Tamara Lewit, “A Viewpoint on Eastern Mediterranean Villages in Late Antiquity: Applying the Lens of Community Resilience Theory,” Studies in Late Antiquity 4, no. 1 (2020): 44–75. A 2018 special issue of the journal Human Ecology was devoted to the question of historical resilience in the face of climatic strain; see John Haldon and Arlene Rosen, “Society and Environment in the East Mediterranean ca. 300–1800 CE: Problems of Resilience, Adaptation and Transformation; Introductory Essay,” Human Ecology 46, no. 3 (2018): 275–90."
