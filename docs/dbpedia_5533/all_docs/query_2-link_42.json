        "text": "Montaillou\n\nBy Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Barbara Bray (translator),\n\nFrom my list on the amazing history of the south of France.\n\nBy T.C. Kuhn Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile using the city of Albi in southern France as a base for visiting some cave art locations I became fascinated with the history of the early Christians of the region and the brutal Cathar Crusade which happened there. I was also surprised to learn this was the home of Toulouse Lautrec and other later artists. As an archaeologist studying cave art, I became caught up in the long and important history of this one small area. The idea for a story intertwining different religious movements and art over thousands of years quickly emerged. I couldn’t resist this unique opportunity to reveal a piece of the past from a perspective I hadn't considered before.\n\nT.C.'s book list on the amazing history of the south of France\n\nWhy did T.C. love this book?\n\nIt is virtually impossible to write or even investigate medieval southern France, especially the famous Cathar Period without delving into this classic work.\n\nStill available in different translations, Le Roy Ladurie takes us into the life of a 14th-century French mountain village and its people in a way no one else has ever attempted. Based upon meticulous church records of contemporary individual interviews and interrogations with alleged heretics in one small village by Church Inquisitors, the author gives us a look into the lives of common people of that time that has never been equaled.\n\nI found myself returning to this small book time and again in creating my own setting and characters (including borrowing authentic names at times) for a near-contemporary portion of the story I wanted to build within the larger framework of time and place I was focused upon.\n\nThe reader gets a true sense of the…\n\nBy Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Barbara Bray (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Montaillou as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has had a success which few historians experience and which is usually reserved for the winner of the Prix Goncourt...Montaillou, which is the reconstruction of the social life of a medieval village, has been acclaimed by the experts as a masterpiece of ethnographic history and by the public as a sensational revelation of the thoughts, feelings, and activities of the ordinary people of the past.\"―Times Literary Supplement.\n\nWith a new introduction by author Le Roy Ladurie, this special edition offers a fascinating history of a fourteenth-century village, Montaillou, in the mountainous region of southern France, almost…\n\nPreview\n\nKnowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies\n\nBy Lynne Kelly,\n\nFrom my list on ancient oral traditions.\n\nBy Patrick Nunn Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBecoming immersed in oral cultures was a massive wake-up call for me! Taught to privilege the written over the spoken word, as most literate people are, it took me years of living in the Pacific Islands, travelling regularly to their remoter parts, to appreciate that people who could neither read nor write could retain huge amounts of information in their heads – and explain it effortlessly. We undervalue orality because we are literate, but that is an irrational prejudice. And as I have discovered from encounters with oral traditions throughout Australia and the Pacific, India, and northwest Europe, not only are oral traditions extensive but may be thousands of years old.\n\nPatrick's book list on ancient oral traditions\n\nWhy did Patrick love this book?\n\nI had been immersed in oral cultures for more than two decades when I read this book by Lynne Kelly and it was like a curtain being lifted for me. Suddenly I found affirmation that oral traditions indeed had meaning and purpose but – more than this – that they were supplemented in this by art, by dance and performance, by poetry and music. Lynne’s clever and readable book has had a lasting impact on me and the research questions I endeavor to answer. Everyone interested in human pasts should read it.\n\nBy Lynne Kelly,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this book, Lynne Kelly explores the role of formal knowledge systems in small-scale oral cultures in both historic and archaeological contexts. In the first part, she examines knowledge systems within historically recorded oral cultures, showing how the link between power and the control of knowledge is established. Analyzing the material mnemonic devices used by documented oral cultures, she demonstrates how early societies maintained a vast corpus of pragmatic information concerning animal behavior, plant properties, navigation, astronomy, genealogies, laws and trade agreements, among other matters. In the second part Kelly turns to the archaeological record of three sites, Chaco Canyon,…\n\nPreview\n\nWhen They Severed Earth from Sky\n\nBy Elizabeth Wayland Barber, Paul T. Barber,\n\nFrom my list on ancient oral traditions.\n\nBy Patrick Nunn Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBecoming immersed in oral cultures was a massive wake-up call for me! Taught to privilege the written over the spoken word, as most literate people are, it took me years of living in the Pacific Islands, travelling regularly to their remoter parts, to appreciate that people who could neither read nor write could retain huge amounts of information in their heads – and explain it effortlessly. We undervalue orality because we are literate, but that is an irrational prejudice. And as I have discovered from encounters with oral traditions throughout Australia and the Pacific, India, and northwest Europe, not only are oral traditions extensive but may be thousands of years old.\n\nPatrick's book list on ancient oral traditions\n\nWhy did Patrick love this book?\n\nWhen I first read this book, not only was I struck by its central theme that ‘myths’ have meaning but also by the fact that it is our problem that we cannot today recognize myths for what they once were. All oral traditions evolve through time, sometimes over thousands of years and across hundreds of generations of retelling, but if their core is sufficiently memorable, then it can remain recognizable. It is up to us to unpack the stories we hear today, to learn how they changed through time, and try to see whether there is an empirical core in their hearts. This book is a must for anyone interested in learning more about the meaning of ‘myth’ rather than romanticizing it.\n\nBy Elizabeth Wayland Barber, Paul T. Barber,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked When They Severed Earth from Sky as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhy were Prometheus and Loki envisioned as chained to rocks? What was the Golden Calf? Why are mirrors believed to carry bad luck? How could anyone think that mortals like Perseus, Beowulf, and St. George actually fought dragons, since dragons don't exist? Strange though they sound, however, these \"myths\" did not begin as fiction. This absorbing book shows that myths originally transmitted real information about real events and observations, preserving the information sometimes for millennia within nonliterate societies. Geologists' interpretations of how a volcanic cataclysm long ago created Oregon's Crater Lake, for example, is echoed point for point in the…\n\nPreview\n\nOral Tradition as History\n\nBy Jan Vansina,\n\nFrom my list on ancient oral traditions.\n\nBy Patrick Nunn Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBecoming immersed in oral cultures was a massive wake-up call for me! Taught to privilege the written over the spoken word, as most literate people are, it took me years of living in the Pacific Islands, travelling regularly to their remoter parts, to appreciate that people who could neither read nor write could retain huge amounts of information in their heads – and explain it effortlessly. We undervalue orality because we are literate, but that is an irrational prejudice. And as I have discovered from encounters with oral traditions throughout Australia and the Pacific, India, and northwest Europe, not only are oral traditions extensive but may be thousands of years old.\n\nPatrick's book list on ancient oral traditions\n\nWhy did Patrick love this book?\n\nThe second edition of this book is the one I read, more than thirty years ago, and it taught me a respect for oral traditions that I had not then fully rationalized. Literate people often disparage those who can neither read nor write, suggesting they could not possibly have any useful knowledge to contribute to a literate world. This is what I have termed ‘the arrogance of literacy’ and is something Vansina, following decades of familiarity with African oral traditions, shows to be baseless. Orally communicated knowledge was key to survival and to understanding one’s place in the world. This is a pioneering study that should never be forgotten.\n\nBy Jan Vansina,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Oral Tradition as History as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nJan Vansina's 1961 book, Oral Tradition, was hailed internationally as a pioneering work in the field of ethno-history. Originally published in French, it was translated into English, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, and Hungarian. Reviewers were unanimous in their praise of Vansina's success in subjecting oral traditions to intense functional analysis.\n\nNow, Vansina-with the benefit of two decades of additional thought and research-has revised his original work substantially, completely rewriting some sections and adding much new material. The result is an essentially new work, indispensable to all students and scholars of history, anthropology, folklore, and ethno-history who are concerned with the transmission…\n\nPreview\n\nOrkney Folk Tales\n\nBy Tom Muir,\n\nFrom my list on making you fall madly in love with Orkney.\n\nBy M.A. Grant Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I stepped off the ferry onto Mainland Orkney, a piece of myself I never knew was missing suddenly slotted into place. Orkney became my geographic soulmate and I knew that The Darkest Court trilogy’s final book—and final battle—would have to take place there. Whenever I find myself longing to return, I pick up one of these books and throw myself back into the stories and histories that caught hold of my imagination all those years ago. I hope they stir your sense of magic and wonder the same way.\n\nM.A.'s book list on making you fall madly in love with Orkney\n\nWhy did M.A. love this book?\n\nThe best way to learn a new place is to read its folk tales. Muir’s curated collection not only gives a sense of the community values found throughout the wide spread of Orkney islands, but also of magic and wonder that pervades the place. You can easily take a tour to the specific locations mentioned in the stories, and I can assure you that rereading the stories in those places, with Muir’s charming, poetic prose, makes them come to life in fascinating new ways.\n\nBy Tom Muir,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Orkney Folk Tales as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Orkney Islands are a place of mystery and magic, where the past and the present meet, ancient standing stones walk and burial mounds are the home of the trows. Orkney Folk Tales walks the reader across invisible islands that are home to fin folk and mermaids, and seals that are often far more than they appear to be. Here Orkney witches raise storms and predict the outcome of battles, ghosts seek revenge and the Devil sits in the rafters of St Magnus Cathedral, taking notes! Using ancient tales told by the firesides of the Picts and Vikings, storyteller Tom…\n\nPreview\n\nIllustrated Myths & Legends of China\n\nBy Dehai Huang,\n\nFrom my list on to see the hidden side of Chinese culture.\n\nBy Justine Laismith Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBeing half-Chinese and half-Peranakan, I grew up in a mixed cultural environment but went to secondary school with a strong Chinese culture. I became aware of my inferior knowledge, not just of the language, but also Chinese culture and history. Hence I immersed myself in the Chinese environment. But there is so much in this long and illustrious history of one of the oldest civilisations that my initial motive to learn was soon replaced by a genuine interest. Now I am always on the lookout for anything related to China, its history, and the Chinese culture.\n\nJustine's book list on to see the hidden side of Chinese culture\n\nWhy did Justine love this book?\n\nThis book stands out because it delves deeper into popular characters that appear repeatedly in similar books. I have also enjoyed coming across new names and places not previously found. But far from being obscure names, I have encountered these in Chinese fantasy dramas.\n\nBest of all, it includes pictures of relevant artwork and museum artifacts. I get to see these without having to travel to the four corners of the world. Giving us a sense of where we are in place and time, these displays show that throughout the long Chinese history, these legends and myths are integral to the lives of Chinese people.\n\nBy Dehai Huang,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Illustrated Myths & Legends of China as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIllustrated Myths & Legends of China is a profusely illustrated collection of 32 carefully chosen tales of Chinese myth and legend.\n\nWith more than 100 illustrations drawn over two thousand years of all aspects of Chinese art—including painting, pottery and porcelain, jade, bronzes and tomb decoration—Illustrated Myths & Legends of China is a vividly written collection of tales of the universe's emergence from chaos, the creation of the world in which the first Chinese people appeared and a depiction of how the many strands of myth and legend have influenced Chinese culture.\n\nAn impressive array of heroic figures and rich…\n\nPreview\n\nGolem\n\nBy David Wisniewski,\n\nWhy did Hannah love this book?\n\nGolem’s illustrations are certainly not detailed in the same way as the others on this list; the imagery in this retelling of the Golem of Prague story is composed entirely of colorful cut paper, layered and woven into bold, dynamic scenes. Whereas the first four books I’ve recommended invite hours of poring over worldbuilding detail and density of information, Golem compels readers to marvel over the construction of its illustrations. How does the golem pierce through the spidery paper web of paper smoke? How are the sheets stacked to imply depth and shadow? Is this seriously all paper?!\n\nBy David Wisniewski,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Golem as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nRetold from traditional sources and accompanied by David Wisniewski's unique cut-paper illustrations, Golem is a dramatic tale of supernatural forces invoked to save an oppressed people. It also offers a thought-provoking look at the consequences of unleashing power beyond human control. The afterword discusses the legend of the golem and its roots in the history of the Jews. A Caldecott Medal Book.\n\nPreview\n\nTwo Old Women\n\nBy Velma Wallis,\n\nWhy did Cathy love this book?\n\nThis is a small gem of a book that I’ve had for years and have read multiple times.\n\nIt’s a retelling of an Athabaskan legend that has been passed from mother to daughter for generations on the upper Yukon River in Alaska. The old women of the title belonged to a large migratory tribe that was slowly starving to death in a bitter Arctic winter. The chief and his male council determined the tribe had a better chance of survival if it left the useless old women behind to die.\n\nWhat happened next? Read the book. I know you’ll love it as much as I do. It’s a triumphant story of the courage of women set against the inadequate leadership of men.\n\nBy Velma Wallis,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Two Old Women as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"No one should miss this beautiful legend.\" —Tony Hillerman\n\nVelma Wallis’s award-winning, bestselling novel about two elderly Native American women who must fend for themselves during a harsh Alaskan winter\n\nBased on an Athabascan Indian legend passed along for many generations from mothers to daughters of the upper Yukon River Valley in Alaska, this is the suspenseful, shocking, ultimately inspirational tale of two old women abandoned by their tribe during a brutal winter famine.\n\nThough these women have been known to complain more than contribute, they now must either survive on their own or die trying. In simple but vivid…\n\nPreview\n\nBritain Begins\n\nBy Barry Cunliffe,\n\nWhy did Brian love this book?\n\nI was attracted to this book as it uses the most up-to-date archaeological evidence together with new work on DNA and other scientific techniques to tell the story of the origins of the British and the Irish peoples, from around 10,000BC to the eve of the Norman Conquest. Whilst there are new archaeological discoveries made every week, one or two of which could potentially challenge some of the ideas in this work, at the moment it is the most up-to-date book on the subject which we have, and as such should be treasured.\n\nBy Barry Cunliffe,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Britain Begins as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe last Ice Age, which came to an end about 12,000 years ago, swept the bands of hunter gatherers from the face of the land that was to become Britain and Ireland, but as the ice sheets retreated and the climate improved so human groups spread slowly northwards, re-colonizing the land that had been laid waste. From that time onwards Britain and Ireland have been continuously inhabited and the resident population has increased from a few hundreds to more than 60\n\nmillion.\n\nBritain Begins is nothing less than the story of the origins of the British and the Irish peoples,…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Arthurian Encyclopedia\n\nBy Norris J Lacy (editor), Geoffrey Ashe (editor), Sandra Ness Ihle (editor) , Marianne E. Kalinke (editor) , Raymond H. Thompson (editor)\n\nWhy did Helen love this book?\n\nThis was one of the first Arthurian reference books and remains one of the best.\n\nIts comprehensive scope, covering Arthurian legends and characters across many European literatures, provides answers to all possible questions about the world of Arthur. The format of short alphabetical entries is perfect for browsing – you will find all you need to know about the Bleeding Lance or the ‘Gargantuan Chronicles’ among many other lesser-known Arthurian curiosities.\n\nI found this book invaluable when I was preparing my own book and I still dip into it when teaching students.\n\nBy Norris J Lacy (editor), Geoffrey Ashe (editor), Sandra Ness Ihle (editor) , Marianne E.
