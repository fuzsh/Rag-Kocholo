        "meta_description": "For an unprecedented ninth year in a row, (2002-03), Emmy Award-winning drama series \"ER\" was television's highest-rated drama among key advertising demographics during the 2002-03 season. Created by best-selling author Michael Crichton (\"Jurassic Park\"), the series centers on the medical personnel in the emergency room of a Chicago hospital. Crichton is also an executive producer, along with John Wells (\"China Beach\") and Christopher Chulack. Now in its 10th season, \"ER\" stars Noah Wyle (\"Enough\"), Laura Innes (\"Deep Impact\"), Mekhi Phifer (\"Clockers\"), Alex Kingston (\"Croupier\"), Goran Visnjic (\"The Deep End\"), Maura Tierney (\"Insomnia\"), Sherry Stringfield (\"NYPD Blue\"), Ming-Na (\"Mulan\"), Sharif Atkins (\"Light It Up\"), Parminder Nagra (\"Bend It Like Beckham\") and Linda Cardellini (\"Scooby-Doo\"). A winner of the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award, the series has also earned 21 Emmy Awards and 108 nominations - breaking an all-time industry record. Also, the cast has won four Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Ensemble Performance in a Drama Series. \"ER\" was named Outstanding Drama Series at the Emmy Awards in 1996. \"ER\" tracks the inner workings of County General Hospital, a Level One Trauma Center where heroic doctors and nurses are faced with life-and-death decisions on a daily basis. The staff is led by Attending Physician Dr. John Carter (Wyle), who, after nine years at County, has risen to a role of respect and moral leadership in the ER. The chief of staff, Dr. Kerry Weaver (Innes), a tough and determined administrator, finds herself at a personal crossroads, trying to strike a balance between her life as a doctor and the life she now wants as a woman. Dr. Elizabeth Corday (Kingston) is the dedicated surgeon who must now face the challenges of starting over and raising a baby daughter alone following the death of her husband, Dr. Mark Greene. Also on staff are Dr. Luka Kovac (Visnjic), an ER attending physician from Croatia who is searching - sometimes self-destructively - for something to fill the void of his lost family and failed relationships; Abby Lockhart (Tierney), nurse and fourth-year medical student, was involved in a tumultuous relationship with Carter and has been plagued by her family's history of mental illness, she has stopped drinking and smoking and is making a serious effort to turn her personal life around; Dr. Jing-Mei Chen (Ming-Na), an attending E.R. doc who, having sacrificed so much for her work, is looking to lighten up and get out more; Dr. Susan Lewis (Stringfield), who, after a few years away has readjusted to the emergency room and is currently dating a man she married in Las Vegas on a whim; Dr. Gregory Pratt (Phifer), a brash, second-year resident with a checkered background that won't stop haunting him; and Dr. Michael Gallant (Sharif Atkins), who worked his way through medical school on the U.S. Army's ticket. Recent additions to the ER include, Neela Rasgotra (Nagra), a British-Indian medical student who arrives in Chicago after finishing her undergraduate degree in biophysics and molecular biology at Yale. Despite her impeccable credentials, Neela must now suffer the humiliations of being the new kid on the block and the racism she encounters from the patients and some of the staff; and Samantha Taggart (Cardellini), a nurse and spirited single mother determined to save lives in a place where nothing is taken for granted. \"ER\" is a production of Constant c Productions and Amblin Television in association with Warner Bros. Television.",
