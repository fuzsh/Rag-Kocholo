        "text": "British actress\n\nParminder Kaur Nagra (born 1975) is a British actress. She is known for portraying Jess Bhamra in the film Bend It Like Beckham (2002) and Dr. Neela Rasgotra in the NBC medical drama ER (2003–2009). Her other television roles include Meera Malik in the first season of the NBC crime drama The Blacklist (2013–2014) and a recurring role in the ABC/Marvel series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2016–2017) as Ellen Nadeer for season four. More recently, Nagra has starred as the titular character of the ITV series DI Ray (2022).\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nParminder Kaur Nagra[1] was born in 1975[2] in Leicester, England, to Sukha and Nashuter Nagra, who emigrated from India in the 1960s. Her parents separated when she was a young child, and her mother remarried and she was raised in this family.[3]\n\nNagra attended Soar Valley College.[3]\n\nA few months after sitting her A-levels and leaving school, Nagra was approached by Jez Simons, her former drama instructor, about becoming part of the Leicester-based theatre company Haithizi Productions, for which he served as the artistic director.[4] She accepted and was cast as a chorus member in the 1994 musical Nimai, presented at the Haymarket Theatre in Leicester.[3] Only a week into rehearsals, she was switched from the chorus to replace the lead actress, who had dropped out.[3] Simons recalls that Nagra, a good singer and actress, also had a quality that raised her above other actresses which led him to select her as the new lead, despite the inconvenience of performing with her arm in a cast.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1990s to early 2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nNagra left Leicester for London and decided not to go to university. Instead she pursued her childhood ambition of becoming an actress.[3] Nagra's first London theatrical job came in 1994, when she was cast as the Princess in the pantomime Sleeping Beauty at the Theatre Royal Stratford East.[3] After Sleeping Beauty, Nagra worked with small Indian theatre companies such as Tara Arts and Tamasha. These roles eventually led to radio and television appearances that defined her career throughout most of the 1990s.\n\nNagra appeared in \"The 6th Wonder of the World: The Kali Tutti Story\", in 1994. In 1996, Nagra took a small part in Chikamatsu Monzaemon's Fair Ladies at a Game of Poem Cards that was performed at Cottesloe, Royal National Theatre.\n\nDespite lacking formal theatrical training, Nagra signed with Joan Brown, a veteran London-based agent,[5] after which she was cast in minor television roles in the British medical drama series Casualty, and in the made for television film King Girl, in which she played an abusive member of an all-girl gang. In 1997, Nagra appeared in the three-part drama Turning World alongside Roshan Seth.\n\nThe following year, she appeared on Casualty again. In 1999, she played a convenience store clerk in the television film Donovan Quick, opposite Colin Firth. Also of note were appearances on the British comedy Goodness Gracious Me. Nagra also co-starred in radio plays including, among others, plays by Tanika Gupta. In 1998, Nagra co-starred in the radio play Dancing Girls of Lahore which was co-written by her future Bend It Like Beckham co-star Shaheen Khan.\n\nNagra's other notable stage roles during this period include:\n\nSkeleton (1997), with critical acclaim for her \"bright-eyed vivacity\" as the village girl[6]\n\nA Tainted Dawn (1997) where she played a Hindu boy accidentally left in Pakistan and brought up by a Muslim couple\n\nFourteen Songs, Two Weddings & A Funeral (1998) where she showed her skills as a romantic comedian, also to critical acclaim[5]\n\nKrishna's Lila—A Play of the Asian World (1999) where she was part of a five-person cast in a controversially titled piece[3]\n\nThe Square Circle (1999) in the demanding role of an illiterate peasant girl who becomes a rape victim[3]\n\nRiver on Fire (2000), as Kiran, in a retelling of Sophocles' Antigone\n\nIn 2001, Nagra voiced a Muslim girl in the docu-drama Arena: The Veil about women who choose to wear the Muslim head scarf. In 1997, not long after Fair Ladies at a Game of Poem Cards, Nagra was cast in Oh Sweet Sita, an adaptation of Indian mythology about Rama and his wife Sita, in the title role of Sita. During that time, Nagra caught the attention of director Gurinder Chadha.[3]\n\nBend It Like Beckham (2002)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bend It Like Beckham\n\nNagra played the lead role in Gurinder Chadha's 2002 comedy-drama Bend It Like Beckham, which became her breakthrough film, alongside Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Anupam Kher, Archie Panjabi, Shaheen Khan, and Keira Knightley, for whom this film also became a career breakthrough. Nagra played Jesminder \"Jess\" Bhamra, a teenage Sikh football player who idolises football superstar David Beckham and defies her traditional parents to pursue her dreams of playing football. The small-budget film was a critical and financial success in the United Kingdom, eventually making the leap around the world and to Canada and the United States where it earned over $30 million at the box office. The script was written by Chadha with her husband Paul Mayeda Berges and Guljit Bindra with Nagra in mind. While initially indifferent to the game of football, Nagra found the football-centred story to be both funny and touching. She agreed to audition and eventually accepted the role. An intensive ten-week training course in the game Futebol de Salao, coached by Simon Clifford, put Nagra through rigorous nine-hour-a-day workouts. Nagra learned to \"bend\" or curve the ball in flight, as she did in a scene in the film.[7] Acknowledging Nagra's actual burn-scarred leg, Chadha wrote it into the film.\n\nNagra received critical and professional acclaim for her performance. She was nominated, and won, several awards, including the FIFA Presidential Award (2002), making her the first woman to have done so.[8]\n\n2002–2019\n\n[edit]\n\nNot long after filming ended on Bend It Like Beckham, Nagra co-starred in the fantasy romantic comedy Ella Enchanted alongside Anne Hathaway where she played Areida, the best friend of Hathaway’s's title character.[5] In addition, she took on two notable television roles for Channel 4—as Viola/Cesario in a multicultural version of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, and as Heere Sharma in the two-part Anglo-Indian drama Second Generation, loosely based on Shakespeare's King Lear, directed by Jon Sen and starring Om Puri. Although Second Generation was a ratings flop, it was a critical success, earning a place in The Observer newspaper's top 10 British TV programmes of 2003.[citation needed] It garnered Nagra an Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy (EMMA) Award.[5] For the role, Nagra had to gain the courage to do some of the love scenes that she had vowed not to do as an actress.[citation needed] Her visit to Calcutta to film the final scenes set there was Nagra's first visit to India.[9]\n\nWhile on a promotional junket in Los Angeles for Bend It Like Beckham, Nagra was informed by her agent that John Wells, one of the producers of the NBC medical drama series ER, was interested in meeting her.[5] Bend It Like Beckham writer and director Gurinder Chadha revealed during a 2007 episode of BBC's Movie Connections that she arranged the meeting, because she had recommended Nagra for the role of the new Indian character in ER during a conversation with her friend Wells.[citation needed] Not long after the meeting, Nagra signed a one-year contract that included an option for three additional years. Despite her new status, Nagra said, \"I don't think Hollywood has changed me at all. The first thing I did when I arrived was buy chapati flour and lentils.\"[citation needed]\n\nNagra made her first appearance on ER on 25 September 2003, in the tenth-season premiere titled \"Now What?\" as Neela Rasgotra, a new Yale-educated Anglo-Indian medical student at County General Hospital. Wells adapted the role to suit Nagra, so she could use her own English accent while working. Nagra appeared in twenty-one of the season's twenty-two episodes, including the twelfth episode titled \"NICU\" and the seventeenth episode titled \"The Student\", episodes in which her character played a central role. Noah Wyle, announcing his departure from the series in 2004, described Nagra as \"the future\" of ER,[10] and the media concurred, anointing her as one of the show's \"golden girls\".[11] In October 2008, following the departures of Goran Visnjic, Maura Tierney, and Mekhi Phifer, Nagra became the longest-serving cast member and lead actor of ER and remained so until the series concluded with season 15: episode 22, the two-hour series finale titled \"And in the End...\" which aired on 2 April 2009.\n\nWhen Nagra finished filming the eleventh season of ER in 2005, she returned to her native Leicester to star in Love in Little India directed by Amit Gupta.[12] She was nominated in 2006 for an Asian Excellence Award, in the category of Outstanding Female Television Performance, for her work in ER, and won the award the following year.[13] In 2008, Nagra voiced Cassandra in the DC animated film Batman: Gotham Knight.[citation needed]\n\nShe played Miss Lovely in the children's film Horrid Henry: The Movie (2011).[2] She then starred as Dr Lucy Banerjee in the Fox science fiction drama series Alcatraz which ran for one season from 16 January to 26 March 2012.[14]\n\nNagra starred as CIA agent Meera Malik in the first season of the NBC crime drama series The Blacklist from 2013 to 2014.[15]\n\nIn 2016, Nagra joined the second season of British arctic psychological thriller Fortitude. In 2018, Nagra joined the second season of the Netflix web television series 13 Reasons Why as Priya Singh, the new counsellor of Liberty High.\n\n2020s\n\n[edit]\n\nNagra starred as the titular character of the ITV series DI Ray. The first series of four episodes aired in 2022, with a second series of six episodes beginning filming in May 2023.[16] and broadcast from 16 June 2024.[17]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1996, while on the set of the play Fair Ladies at a Game of Poem Cards, Nagra met Irish actor Kieran Creggan, with whom she later moved into a flat in Kennington, South London. They were in a relationship for five years.[3]\n\nOn 17 January 2009, after a seven-year relationship, Nagra married photographer James Stenson. Her ER co-stars Scott Grimes and John Stamos performed at the ceremony, and her friend and former ER co-star Maura Tierney officiated.[18] The couple had a son together,[19] but divorced in July 2013.[20]\n\nNagra was one of the bearers of the Olympic torch as it passed through London on its way to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.[21]\n\nAs of 2022, she lived in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles.[22]\n\nRecognition and honours\n\n[edit]\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery in London holds a pencil drawing of Nagra by Stuart Pearson Wright created in 2004.[2]\n\nNagra was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctors of Letters by the University of Leicester on 11 July 2007.[23]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1991 Dushmani Jattan Di 1999 Park Stories Short film 2002 Bend It Like Beckham Jasminder \"Jess\" Bhamra 2004 Ella Enchanted Areida 2005 B13 Narrator Voice 2008 In Your Dreams Charlie Batman: Gotham Knight Cassandra Voice 2011 Horrid Henry: The Movie Miss Lovely 2012 Twenty8k Deeva Jani 2014 Postman Pat: The Movie Nisha Bains Voice 2018 Bird Box Dr. Lapham 2019 Five Feet Apart Dr. Noor Hamid Piney: The Lonesome Pine Bus driver Voice 2021 Awaken Rakhi Singh\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1996, 1998 Casualty Ayisha / Asha Guptah 2 episodes 1997 Turning World Sabina 3 episodes 1998 Faxbir Babu Frik TV movie 1999 Donovan Quick Radhika TV movie 2000 Goodness Gracious Me Various 2 episodes 2000 Holby City Tina Episode: \"The Trouble with the Truth\" 2001 Judge John Deed Ishbel McDonald Episode: \"Exacting Justice\" (Pilot) 2002 Always and Everyone Sunita Verma Episode: \"A New Breed\" 2002 The Swap Hotel Receptionist TV movie 2003 Twelfth Night Viola TV movie 2003 Second Generation Heere/Sonali Sharma TV movie 2003–2009 ER Dr. Neela Rasgotra Main cast (Seasons 10–15) 2009 Compulsion Anjika Indrani TV movie 2010 The Whole Truth Pilar Shirazee Episode: \"Liars\" 2012 Alcatraz Dr. Lucille \"Lucy\" Banerjee Main cast 2012 Tron: Uprising Ada Episode: \"Isolated\", voice 2013 Psych Rachael 4 episodes 2013–2014 The Blacklist Meera Malik[a] Main cast (Season 1) 2015 NCIS: Los Angeles Ella Desai Episode: \"Expiration Date\" 2016–2017 Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
