        "text": "Photo Courtesy of NBC\n\nThis medical drama centers on the doctors and nurses who work in the Emergency Room – ER – of Chicago’s County General Hospital. Its large recurring cast includes patients, paramedics and hospital staff of all kinds, and by the end of its fifteen seasons, not a single character from the first season remains.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) – Mark Greene is a doctor who specializes in emergency medicine. He is chief resident and dedicated to his job as well as his wife, Jen (Christine Harnos), and their daughter, Rachel (Yvonne Zima-later played by Hallee Hirsh). On the brink of completing law school, Jen wants Mark to leave the ER for a private medical practice with less demanding hours. His refusal to do so puts their marriage under strain.\n\nDr. Doug Ross (George Clooney) – Doug Ross is the ER pediatrician, single mindedly committed to helping his patients and not afraid to break the rules. Raised alone by his mother after his father deserted them, Doug also has a son he doesn’t know. Despite his messy personal life, he is totally dedicated to medicine and the children he takes care of every day.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) – Susan Lewis is another doctor specializing in emergency medicine. She is in her second year of residency, and is in a relationship with a psychiatrist at County General which later falls apart when he has a nervous breakdown. Highly competent, Susan is close to her co-workers but at first lacks the assertiveness needed to cope with the fast-pace of the ER.\n\nDr. Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle) – Peter Benton’s specialty is general surgery. A surgical resident, he is brilliant at what he does – and knows it. Peter met Mark Greene in college, but at first he tends to keep a healthy distance from his co-workers. As the series progresses, he becomes more friendly with the rest of the staff.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) – John Carter is a third year medical student from a wealthy family. He lost his brother to leukemia when he was just a young child, kindling his desire to study medicine – something he has pursued despite not always finding it easy. His family would prefer that he devote his time to their philanthropic endeavors, but he eventually wins the support of his grandmother. He later decides to go into general surgery and completes the first year of surgical residency before his experience in the ER sees him opt for emergency medicine instead.\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) – Carol Hathaway is a registered nurse and the nurse manager of the County General Emergency Room. A great advocate for her staff, she does not appreciate the lack of recognition they receive. Carol is capable and well-liked – so everyone is shocked when she is wheeled into ER after a failed suicide attempt. Many of the staff suspect the cause is her failed relationship with Dr. Doug Ross. She recovers and appears eventually to put the incident behind her.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nJeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben) – Jeanie Boulet is a physicians’ assistant, unhappily married to philandering Al (Wolfgang Bodison, later played by Michael Beach). She later has an affair with Dr. Benton after he hires her to care for his senile mother. Soon after that relationship ends, Jeanie finds out that she and her husband are both HIV-positive.\n\nDr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) – Kerry Weaver is another specialist in the field of emergency medicine. She is hired by Mark Greene as chief resident, much to the displeasure of both Susan Lewis and Doug Ross. Kerry is a good doctor who has a limp and uses an arm-crutch, although the reason for this is not revealed for many seasons. At first appearing cold, over time we learn that Kerry’s ambition is combined with a willingness to do whatever it takes help her patients and her colleagues.\n\nDr. Anna Del Amico (Maria Bello) – Anna Del Amico is a doctor specializing in pediatrics but wants to become certified in both pediatrics and emergency medicine. Having already completed a residency in pediatrics, she arrives at the hospital as an Emergency Medicine Intern. She becomes good friends with Nurse Hathaway and a few others, but while she and Carter develop romantic feelings for one another, nothing serious comes of it.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) – Elizabeth Corday is a trauma surgeon from England. After working there for two years after completing her residency, she accepts a fellowship at County General to gain experience with American medicine. At first the culture clash creates some problems between Elizabeth and her colleagues, but these are soon resolved. Direct and honest, she is a skilled surgeon and soon after her arrival starts a relationship with Peter Benton.\n\nLucy Knight (Kellie Martin) – Lucy Knight is a third year medical student. Assigned Dr. John Carter as her resident, the two have a difficult relationship from the outset. Though popular with most of the nurses and attendings, who treat her as an equal, she encounters a problem with Nurse Carol Hathaway. Soon after beginning her ER rotation, she asks Carol for help starting an IV. She fails to tell Carter that she cannot perform the procedure and the truth is only exposed in a trauma situation. We later learn that she is taking the drug Ritalin, which has been prescribed to her since she was in high school.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Robert Romano (Paul McCran) – Robert Romano is a surgeon. He is also bigoted, surly and cruel, and will stop at nothing in his quest to get to the top. He does, however, have a soft spot for medical student Lucy Knight, who won his respect by giving him a piece of her mind when he refused to perform surgery on a patient.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac (Goran Visnjic) – Croatian Luka Kovac specializes in emergency medicine. Before coming to Ameriaca, he lost his wife, small daughter and infant son in the Croatian War of Independence. He has survivor’s guilt as well as PTSD, which is evidenced in his personal relationships. He is a very committed doctor and gives his time to a range of different organizations.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Cleo Finch (Michael Michele) – No-nonsense Cleo Finch is a skilled pediatric fellow at County General. She begins a relationship with Dr. Peter Benton and is especially good with his son, Reese, who is deaf and with whom she communicates by ASL. Her relationship with Reese’s mother, Carla (Lisa Nicole Carson), however, is not so smooth, Carla maintaining that Cleo is untrustworthy after Reese has an accident while under her care.\n\nDr. Dave Malucci (Erik Palladino) – Dave Malucci is an emergency medicine physician. He has a reputation for being shoddy and uncaring, although on occasion we see he has a sensitive side. He has a habit of breaking the rules to get things done.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Jing-Mei Chen (Ming-Na) – Jing-Mei (sometimes called Deb) appears during the first season but leaves after deciding to pursue a career in research. Several years later she returns to County General in her third year of residency, explaining that she decided to return to medicine not long after leaving, after she saved a man’s life. Dr. Carter is pleased to see her and they resume their friendship.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) – Abby Lockhart begins as a registered nurse, eventually becoming a doctor specializing in emergency medicine. She has several relationships, the most serious with Luka Kovac and John Carter. During her relationship with Carter, it is revealed that she is a recovering alcoholic and when she receives a visit from her mother, Maggie (Sally Field), the family history is revealed, including the fact that both Maggie and Abby’s brother, Eric (Tom Everett Scott) – who was in the US Air Force but has gone AWOL – have bipolar disease.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt (Meki Phifer) – Gregory “Greg” Pratt is a highly skilled doctor, but takes risks that often leave him at odds with his chief resident, Dr. John Carter. He lives with his stepbrother, Leon (Marcello Thedford), who is mentally handicapped as a result of a gunshot wound to the head. Because of his disability Leon often gets into trouble, distracting Greg from both his personal and professional life.\n\nDr. Michael Gallant (Sharif Atkins) – Michael Gallant is a third year medical student and member of the US Army Reserve. Having been on active duty, the Army are now paying for his medical school tuition. Although he at first clashes with a new intern, Dr. Gregory Pratt, they soon resolve their differences and become good friends. Michael is a skilled and dedicated physician as well as a soldier, and is liked by everyone.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Neela Rasgotra (Parminder Nagra) – Neela Rasgotra is a talented but shy medical student from England who suffers from claustrophobia. She graduates from medical school but after an identity crisis leads her to turn down an internship, she becomes a store clerk. She returns to work at County General after asking Dr. Kerry Weaver for a job.\n\nNurse Samantha Taggart (Linda Cardellini) – Samantha Taggart is the head nurse at County General. She has raised her son, Alex (Oliver Davis and later played by Dominic Janes), born when she was only fifteen years old, almost entirely by herself – her own family consists almost entirely of alcoholics and deadbeats. She is tough, smart, talented and assertive, and she knows how to fight for herself and her son.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Ray Barnett (Shane West) – Ray Barnett is a doctor who specializes in emergency medicine. He is also a member of a rock band, a dual role which sometimes causes a conflict. He later falls in love with Dr. Neela Rasgotra, despite many barriers to their relationship.\n\nDr. Archie Morris (Scott Grimes) – Archie Morris is a second year resident. Snide, inept and lazy, despite his many mistakes Archie somehow always seems to come out on top.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Tony Gates (John Stamos) – Tony Gates first appears at County General as a paramedic, later returning as an intern. When a paramedic he met Dr. Neela Rasgotra and revealed to her that he was in medical school. They soon became friends and later had a brief, romantic affair. It is later discovered that he is being put through medical school by Meg Riley (Paula Malcomson), the wife of a deceased friend with whom he served in the Gulf. After the death of Meg’s husband, he goes to live with her and her daughter, Sarah (Chloe Greenfield), to help them out for a while.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nDr. Simon Brenner (David Lyons) – Simon Brenner is first seen as a new ER Attending. Although as talented a physician as he is with the ladies, he refuses to recognize that County General is a teaching hospital. When Dr. Pratt goes to surgeon and chief-of-staff Dr. Donald Anspaugh (John Aylward) to voice a complaint, Dr. Brenner is revealed as Anspaugh’s nephew.\n\nDr. Catherine Banfield (Angela Bassett) – Tough Catherine “Cate” Banfield is brought to County General to be Chief of the Emergency Department, but she puts her new colleagues on edge from the beginning. One of the nurses, Haleh Adams (Yvette Freeman), thinks she recognizes her, but Dr. Banfield says she is mistaken. Later we learn through a flashback that Banfield brought in her son after a seizure where he was diagnosed with acute leukemia, and later died from the disease. She is later able to deal with her son’s death and the part she felt she had played in it.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nMain Cast\n\nCharacter Actor Seasons John Carter Noah Wyle 1994-2009 Kerry Weaver Laura Innes 1995-2009 Chuny Marquez Laura Ceron 1995-2009 Abby Lockhart Maura Tierney 1999-2009 Malik McGrath Deezer D 1994-2009 Haleh Adams Yvette Freeman 1994-2009 Luka Kovac Goran Visnjic 1999-2008 Mark Greene Anthony Edwards 1994-2008 Peter Benton Eriq La Salle 1994-2009 Doris Pickman Emily Wagner 1994-2009 Elizabeth Corday Alex Kingston 1997-2009 Pamela Olbes Lyn Alicia Henderson 1995-2009 Susan Lewis Sherry Stringfield 1994-2009 Jerry Markovic Abraham Benrubi 1994-2009 Gregory Pratt Mekhi Phifer 2002-2008 Carol Hathaway Julianna Margulies 1994-2009 Neela Rasgotra Parminder Nagra 2003-2009 Frank Martin Troy Evans 1994-2009 Lily Jarvik Lily Mariye 1994-2009 Samantha Taggart Linda Cardellini 2003-2009 Robert Romano Paul McCrane 1997-2008 Jing-Mei Chen Ming-Na Wen 1995-2004 Dwight Zadro Montae Russell 1995-2009 Lydia Wright Ellen Crawford 1994-2009 Connie Oligario Conni Marie Brazelton 1994-2003 Archie Morris Scott Grimes 2003-2009 Doug Ross George Clooney 1994-2009 Jeanie Boulet Gloria Reuben 1995-2008 Brian Dumar Brian Lester 1996-2009 Donald Anspaugh John Aylward 1996-2008 Nurse Shirley Dinal Lenney 1995-2009 Randi Fronczak Kristin Minter 1995-2003 Ray Barnett Shane West 2004-2009 Tony Gates John Stamos 2005-2009 Lucien Dubenko Leland Orser 2004-2009 Michael Gallant Sharif Atkins 2001-2006 Yosh Takata Gedde Watanabe 1997-2003 Christine Harms Michelle Bonilla 1999-2009 Cleo Finch Michael Michele 1999-2002\n\nPhoto Courtesy of NBC\n\nAdditional Cast\n\nCharacter Actor Seasons Morales Demetrius Navarro 1998-2009 Paramedic Bardelli Louie Liberti 2003-2009 Dave Malucci Erik Palladino 1999-2001 Lucy Knight Kellie Martin 1998-2000 Dawn Archer Angel Laketa Moore 2006-2009 Maggie Doyle Jorja Fox 1996-1999 David Morgenstern William H.
