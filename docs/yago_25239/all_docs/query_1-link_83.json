The character was appointed County General's new Chief of Staff after South Side closed and merged with County. In 1999 Anspaugh resigned as Chief of Staff because of his son's death and was replaced by Robert Romano. He remains both a surgeon and a leading board member but his exact position wasn't specified for several seasons. He, along with Peter Benton, succeed in saving John Carter's life after he and medical student Lucy Knight were stabbed by a patient. At the end of season 8, he was among those that paid their respect at Mark Greene's funeral and assisted in the small pox evacuation, trying to save Dr. Romano from losing his arm. Toward the end of Season 9, Anspaugh fired Romano over his insubordinate attitude and gave Kerry the job. Anspaugh later resurfaced in Season 12 to deal with the lawsuit issue caused by Clemente. In the second episode of season 13, Kerry herself told him that it was her fault that Clemente kept working at County as long as he did, despite concerns from the staff and mishaps before. Dr. Anspaugh was originally going to fire Luka Kovac until Weaver spoke up. Afterwards, he immediately decides to relieve Dr. Weaver of her position of Chief of Staff, which he takes over himself for until a search for a full-time successor was found. In Season 14, Greg Pratt appealed to Dr. Anspaugh to have him replace Kevin Moretti as Chief of Emergency Medicine, a proposal that the doctor still didn't accept despite Pratt's persistent efforts, citing Pratt's lack of leadership initiatives and youth. Donald Anspaugh is still a recurring character, a surgeon working at County General as well as the Chief of Staff and member of the hospital board. Dr. Anspaugh is seen through out season 14, interviewing Dr. Pratt for the Chief's job, promoting Dr. Wexler and informing the ER of Dr. Moretti's departure and later meeting with Abby Lockhart and the rest of the board after her rehab stint. He then met with her again when she interviewed for an Attending position.\n\nDr. Anspaugh is portrayed by John Aylward.\n\nimon Brenner\n\nInfobox character\n\nname =Dr. Simon Brenner\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = April 10, 2008 (Episode: Owner of a Broken Heart)\n\nlast =\n\ncause =\n\nnickname =\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Male\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = Physician in Emergency Medicine\n\ntitle = Attending\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse =\n\nchildren =\n\nrelatives = Dr. Donald Anspaugh, (Uncle)\n\nepisode =\n\nportrayer = David Lyons\n\ncreator =\n\nA new ER attending who was first seen in bed with two women before arriving on his first shift. His character is superficially very charming, especially with the ladies. While Brenner is a talented physician, he has an unwillingness to share his knowledge and teach the new med students. Even when consistently reminded that Brenner works in a teaching hospital, he still refuses to teach procedures to those who need/want the practice, and he slept with one med student and later insulted both her romantic and professional skills. When Pratt informs Dr. Anspaugh of Brenner's attitude, it is then revealed that Brenner is Anspaugh's nephew.\n\nAt the end of season 14, Simon and Neela get into a heated argument where she told him he was only at County because of his family ties to Dr. Anspaugh, ripped his attitude and said no one else wanted him around. This somehow led to them sleeping together.\n\nDr. Brenner is portrayed by David Lyons.\n\nVictor Clemente\n\nInfobox character\n\nname = Victor Clemente\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = October 20, 2005 (Episode: Wake Up)\n\nlast = May 11, 2006 (Episode: The Gallant Hero & the Tragic Victor)\n\ncause = Fired\n\nnickname =\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Male\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = ER attending physician\n\ntitle =\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse =\n\nchildren =\n\nrelatives =\n\nepisode = 12\n\nportrayer = John Leguizamo\n\ncreator =\n\nVictor Clemente first appears in the 250th episode of \"ER\", \"Wake Up\", as a new attending physician from Newark who is seeking to be Chief of Emergency Medicine and attempting to introduce modern equipment and diagnostics to the ER. He enters the series in an unusual way, by posing as a patient. This causes him to take an instant dislike to doctors Archie Morris, Gregory Pratt and especially Luka Kovac. Clemente and Luka clash over just about every case that comes through the ER, and Luka is so annoyed by Clemente that he decides to seek the ER Chief job for himself. In the end, Kovac does become Chief, after which Clemente claims to have earlier decided not to seek the position, citing time constraints. The audience soon learns that Victor is not the consummate professional he was originally portrayed as. Clemente's former girlfriend Jodie (portrayed by Callie Thorne), whose relationship with Victor in Newark caused unspecified problems that Kerry Weaver said were not his fault, tracks him down to Chicago and initiates a new relationship between them. This causes Clemente to become careless and even miss work to stay with her. Eventually, Jodie's controlling husband (a violent police officer who apparently beats her) appears in his apartment. He shoots both Clemente and Jodie after Jodie asks for a divorce. Clemente has relatively minor injuries while Jodie ends up in a coma, but he becomes the prime suspect of shooting her himself due to the cocaine found in his apartment and the fact that Jodie's husband has vanished. Clemente is subjected to drug tests and is kept under close watch by Luka Kovac and other staff; Luka wants him gone but neither he nor Kerry take any steps to fire Victor from his job.\n\nJodie does survive and helps him get out of trouble by telling the cops what really occurred, but more problems occur when Jodie's husband continues to harass Clemente by phone, leaving threats and other comments to him. In the episode \"The Gallant Hero and the Tragic Victor\", Clemente finally succumbs to the troubles plaguing him. Dr. Clemente's behavior included relieving himself in public, property damage, and threats of violence. He is hospitalized and medically classified as being in an altered psychiatric state. He is treated at County. A psychiatric consultant rules his peculiar behavior is caused by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or sleep deprivation, assumedly from his vigilance in avoiding his stalker. In the Season 12 finale \"Twenty-One Guns\" Luka Kovac states that Clemente has finally been fired from his position at County, and Kerry faces stern questions from Dr. Anspaugh when a former patient files a lawsuit against Clemente and he is listed on a medical watchdog website as a bad doctor. When the board plans to fire Luka over his Kerry-insinuated negligence in Clemente's hiring and terrible history at County, Kerry admits she was responsible for those problems, and is demoted from her Chief of Staff position as a result of that, which also led into her departure from the ER altogether in Season 13.\n\nDr. Clemente was portrayed by John Leguizamo.\n\nJanet Coburn\n\nInfobox character\n\nname =Dr. Janet Coburn\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = March 7, 1995 (Episode: Love's Labor Lost)\n\nlast =\n\ncause =\n\nnickname =\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Female\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = Physician in Obsetrics & Gynaecology\n\ntitle = Chief of Obstetrics & Gynecology\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse = Husband (Divorced)\n\nchildren =\n\nrelatives =\n\nepisode =\n\nportrayer = Amy Aquino\n\ncreator =\n\nJanet Coburn is the head of the OB department and has been since season 1. Oftentimes her character appears, she is in some kind of conflict with the ER staff, most notably in her first appearance in season 1 when Mark Greene mis-diagnosed Jodi O'Brien who later died as a result. Coburn later in the series revealed she once had a drinking problem and has since become Abby's sponsor. Coburn convinced Abby to get back into a program after she started drinking again, and also convinced her to fly to Croatia to make amends with Luka after revealing she was unfaithful.\n\nDr. Coburn is portrayed by Amy Aquino.\n\nMaggie Doyle\n\nInfobox character\n\nname = Maggie Doyle\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = October 10, 1996 (Episode: Don't Ask, Don't Tell)\n\nlast = March 25, 1999 (Episode: Sticks and Stones)\n\ncause =\n\nnickname =\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Female\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = ER resident\n\ntitle =\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse =\n\nchildren =\n\nrelatives =\n\nepisode = 33\n\nportrayer = Jorja Fox\n\ncreator =\n\nMaggie Doyle was an intern during season 3 and a resident during seasons 4 and 5. Maggie's older sister (by three years) is identified as a former classmate of Carol Hathaway in a Catholic school. In the ER, she became friends with John Carter, who became attracted to her, but it is later revealed that she is a lesbian. During season 5, she accuses Dr. Romano of sexual harassment. She asked Elizabeth Corday to back her up, but Corday refused when Romano blackmailed her using some personal information. Kerry Weaver started an investigation and forced Romano to retract an inaccurate, critical review of Maggie's job performance, but this did not prevent Maggie from leaving the ER. Her absence from the show was not explained, but in the season 7 episode \"Rampage\" when Weaver & Romano were arguing over Dr. Legaspi's termination, Weaver suggested that Maggie Doyle was forced out due to Romano's dislike (which he never directly admitted to) of gay people. Doyle could have left her job in the ER after the mess of the sexual harassment lawsuit she had on Romano was never going to be pursued.\n\nDr. Doyle was portrayed by Jorja Fox. In real life, Doyle left \"ER\" because Fox kept getting larger roles on successful drama shows, starting with \"The West Wing\" and peaking with her work as Sara Sidle on the blockbuster CBS drama \"\".\n\nLucien Dubenko\n\nInfobox character\n\nname = Lucien Dubenko\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = October 14, 2004 (Episode: Try Carter)\n\nlast =\n\ncause =\n\nnickname = \"teeny\"\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Male\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = Attending Trauma Surgeon\n\ntitle = Chief of Surgery (2004-2008)\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse =\n\nchildren =\n\nrelatives =\n\nepisode = 50 (2004-2008)\n\nportrayer = Leland Orser\n\ncreator =\n\nLucien Dubenko is the current Chief of Surgery. He was first introduced shortly before Elizabeth Corday departed, as an arrogant but obviously talented surgeon, bragging about, and then showing his ability to run the bowel with a laparoscope . Dr. Corday bitterly protests his hiring to Kerry Weaver. Corday's anger causes her to conduct an illegal organ transplant between two HIV+ men, which leads to her being reprimanded and being forced to take a demotion. Corday eventually quits the hospital altogether, though Dubenko praises her actions in doing the transplant. Dubenko is portrayed as a very dedicated and talented surgeon, with a keen interest in medical science, lecturing the interns on physiology. Dubenko becomes friends with residents Abby Lockhart and Neela Rasgotra, and later seems to fall for both of them, most notably Neela after she becomes a surgical intern. He has a baby sister who lives in an assisted-care facility because she was in a car crash caused by her drunken teenage boyfriend that left her with brain damage. After he discovers he has cancer, he asks Abby to have sex with him but reacts with equanimity when she declines the offer. During Luka and Abby's wedding, he asks Luka to take care of Abby. He was involved in a \"friends with benefits\" relationship with new ER Chief Dr. Skye Wexler, which later ended after he lashed out at her for excluding him from her life and accused of her of being a slut. It later looks like Dr. Dubenko resigns in protest over the death of patient Sheryl Hawkins, when he had to leave the OR and leave Dr. Rasgotra (Junior Resident) to finish the operation, because he was the only attending available in the hospital, this ouburst enraged Dr. Anspaugh during the M&M.\n\nDr. Dubenko is portrayed by Leland Orser.\n\nAngela Hicks\n\nInfobox character\n\nname = Angela Hicks\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = December 8, 1994 (Episode: Blizzard)\n\nlast = October 2, 1997 (Episode: Something New)\n\ncause =\n\nnickname =\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Female\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = Attending; Surgeon\n\ntitle =\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse = Unknown\n\nchildren = She mentioned something about a son. She has at least one kid\n\nrelatives =\n\nepisode = 24\n\nportrayer = CCH Pounder\n\ncreator =\n\nAngela Hicks arrived in the episode \"Blizzard\" in Season One and had to start working immediately because of a blizzard which resulted in many patients. She worked at County General between 1994 and 1997 and gave both Peter Benton and John Carter advice in many aspects. Dr. Hicks' absence was never explained, however, Dr. Romano started to appear in episodes as an OR attending (which was Hicks' position in the OR) after Hicks stopped appearing. Though she stopped appearing her locker could still be seen in the background for a few more years.\n\nDr. Hicks was portrayed by CCH Pounder.\n\nJack Kayson\n\nInfobox character\n\nname = Jack Kayson\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = September 29, 1994 (Episode: Going Home)\n\nlast =\n\ncause =\n\nnickname =\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Male\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = Chief of Cardiology and member of the board\n\ntitle =\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse = A wife (name unknown)\n\nchildren = Possible\n\nrelatives =\n\nepisode = 19 (1994-2007)\n\nportrayer = Sam Anderson\n\ncreator =\n\nJack Kayson is the chief of Cardiology and member of the hospital board. He usually appears in board discussions, and is sometimes called down to the ER for cardiology consults. He has at times, been shown doing procedures in the cardio cath lab. He is easily angered when residents in the ER question his medical decisions. In the first season, Kayson had a disagreement with Susan Lewis about the treatment a patient should receive who had a Myocardial Infarction. Susan tries to give Kayson the correct treatment but he overrules her, the patient dies, and Kayson later hauls Susan in front of a hospital review board--only to see the board largely side with her and chastise him for his behavior. Later Kayson is admitted with the classic signs of an acute Myocardial Infarction and Susan gives him the treatment he wants and eventually saves his life. After this, Kayson asks Susan to be his Valentine's date, but Susan declines. He later clashed with med student Michael Gallant over the death of a hypochondriac and tried but failed to stop Dr. Greg Pratt from helping treat desk clerk Frank after he suffered a massive heart attack. Dr. Kayson later returns twice in season 11, in which he is on the Hospital Board that investigates Dr. Elizabeth Corday. Then later returns to treat patient Ruby Rubadoux with Dr. Anspaugh. Dr Kayson is not seen again until season 14 in which he misdiagnoses a patient and argues with Dr. Gates.\n\nDr. Kayson is portrayed by Sam Anderson.\n\nAbby Keaton\n\nInfobox character\n\nname = Abby Keaton\n\ncaption =\n\nfirst = October 10, 1996 (Episode: Don't Ask, Don't Tell)\n\nlast = January 16, 1997 (Episode: Night Shift)\n\ncause = Left for Pakistan.\n\nnickname =\n\nalias =\n\nspecies =\n\ngender = Female\n\nage =\n\nborn =\n\ndeath =\n\noccupation = Pediatric Surgeon\n\ntitle =\n\nfamily =\n\nspouse =\n\nchildren =\n\nrelatives =\n\nepisode =\n\nportrayer = Glenne Headley\n\ncreator =\n\nAbby Keaton was a pediatric surgeon from Southside Hospital reassigned to County when Southside closes. She supervises a pediatric surgical rotation with Dr.Benton.

She hired him as an Attending Physician in the ER at County General. During his brief appearance, Dr. Lawrence shares his experiences with the members of the ER staff. It quickly becomes apparent that Lawrence is in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's disease. Mark Greene's well-founded suspicions are mistaken for jealousy, and Lucy Knight's notice of this is also dismissed by John Carter. At first Lawrence does not want to admit to what's happening, but he can't hide it because it is shown that he's slowly losing his mind. For example looking for his car on the third floor while he parked on the fourth floor, or forgetting he told a patient to wait for him to write out a prescription. He later he realizes he has no choice but to retire. He makes amends with his son in California, and goes to live with him. As he waits for his son to pick him up, he gets the chance to make one more diagnosis, and save one last life--a patient with a rare case of strychnine poisoning that had baffled other ER physicians."
