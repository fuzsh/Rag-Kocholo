        "text": "Neela!!! Even if I liked ER's first five or so seasons the best overall, when I think of ER, I think of Abby and Neela. These ladies were the characters that I truly fell in love with. Neela had a great growth curve and probably the most satisfying ending - finally ending up with Ray, answering the will-they-won't-they question that had tingled me more than any other relationship on this damn show. Neela's storyline had so many little twists and turns that I found so interesting. I thought it was romantic as hell that she and Michael ended up together basically as a result of a long-distance penpal relationship - I used to write letters a lot in my teens, so I understand how amazing it can be to receive and write letters with all the secrets that you can't tell anyone else because somehow it doesn't make as much sense when you say it out loud. Haha. I know they already had interest in each other prior to that, but letters, man. Letters.\n\nOf course, the decision to MARRY Michael was dodgy to me, but somehow Neela's odd mid-to-late-twenties decisions just made her more realistic and relatable. How could she have known that Michael was so much his father's son. I also loved when she quit her medical training and worked as a cashier for a while when confused about what to do with her life. I'm still confused, too, but am trying to apply to grad school, so we'll see if I can become a pro like Neela.\n\nAnd oi I've just remembered that Neela underwent some major bodily and emotional harm during her time on the show. She got STOMPED ON for god's sake, her husband DIED and Ray lost his legs because of her phone call (of course it wasn't her fault, but I know if that happened to me I'd feel like shit forever), and that lil Sara blamed her mom's suicide on her, too. For most people just one of these experiences would be traumatic enough to fuck them up for good. This show was harsh on its characters, mang."
