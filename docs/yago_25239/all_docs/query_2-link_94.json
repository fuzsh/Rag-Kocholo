        "text": "The 37-year-old actress lived with James Stenson for six years before marrying him in January 2009 and filed for divorce in February 2012.\n\nStenson claimed that he stopped working as a photographer, which according to him earned him 300,000 dollars a year, to manage their life after Nagra won the role of Dr Neela Rasgotra in the long-running NBC show, ER, in 2003, News.com.au reported.\n\nHe claimed that Nagra channelled money through a company that she controlled, and bought three homes during their premarital relationship.\n\nStenson asked for 500,000 dollars in damages plus half the value of the properties.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed last June in Los Angeles Superior Court."
