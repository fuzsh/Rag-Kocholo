        "text": "Season ten of ER begins with yet another bang! Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) returns to the place he began his career, Chicago County, after being abroad with Doctors Without Boarders in the Congo. It has been reported that County coworker Dr. Luka Kovac (Goran Visnjic) has been killed during fighting in the Congo. This seems to be inaccurate as Kovac actually reappears at County - much to everyone's relief! The previous relationship that Carter and nurse Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) has gone to the wayside as it seems Carter had a relationship with Doctors Without Borders coworker Kem Likasu (Thandie Newton); since she's having his baby! Joining the ER group is new med student Neela Rasgotra (Pardminder Nagra), someone who proves to be quite the asset to the ER team, both on the show and as an actress. Neela is mentored by Dr. Michael Gallant (Sharif Atkins), a previous med student who is now a doctor at County himself. Neela is a very talented med student, and an attractive one, and she catches the eye of Gallant's longtime friend (and rival) Dr. Pratt (Mekhi Phifer). This doesn't sit well with Dr. Deb Chen (Ming-Na) as she has her own interest in Pratt.\n\nDuring season ten Neela ends up passing her medical boards, even though nurse Abby who has more experience does not. Glenn Howerton also joins the cast as Dr. Nick Cooper who is a second year resident. As for departures in season ten, nothing more major happens then the departure of Dr. Robert Romano (Paul McCrane). Seemingly Romano has become nastier since he was fitting with a prosthesis when he lost his hand and forearm in a helicopter accident. Ironically though, Romano's exit is actually due to another helicopter accident. A helicopter crashes off of the roof of the hospital and killing Romano. Romano's death does open up the door for Dr. Archie Morris (Scott Grimes) who, funny enough, was caught smoking pot in the parking lot of the hospital by Dr. Romano. Dr. Elizabeth Corday begins a new relationship of her own after recovering from the death of her husband, two seasons ago, Mark Green (Anthony Edwards). She starts up a steamy romance with Dr. Eddie Dorset (Bruno Campos), someone who is still married) and then later on juggles Dorset and being made head of surgery all while dating other men as well.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) begins a friendship with a suicidal architect, played by Bob Newhart, while Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) has a baby boy with her partner Sandy Lopez (Lisa Vidal). Lopez gives birth to a baby boy, who they name Henry, but later in the season she dies due to a fire. Weaver gets caught up in a bitter custody battle with Sandy's family over Henry. Season ten concludes with the usual cliffhanger, this one involves Dr. Pratt and Chen being seriously wounded while involved in a terrible case of \"road rage.\"\n\nNo great extras show up on the DVD as there are a few deleted scenes and a gag reel that are pretty typical. Nothing you would want to brag about or waste time watching, especially since these are the only extras you get."
