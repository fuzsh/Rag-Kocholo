        "text": "Scott Jung\n\nScott Jung\n\nMedical Technology Journalist and Advocate\n\nPublished Jan 30, 2015\n\nToday, I turned 28.\n\nI'm extremely grateful for the people I've met, the experiences I've had, and the lessons I've learned over the past year.\n\nAnd yet, every January 30, I find myself looking back and contemplating why my life is going at the pace it's going and what the next 365 days will be like. Many of my friends are moving onto bigger and better opportunities with new careers. Even within my social spheres, more and more of my friends are disappearing to get married and have their first, and second kids. Life seems mundane and stagnant while the world around me moves ahead at warp speed.\n\nER was one of my favorite TV shows growing up, and for the past seven January 30th's, I've been reminded of a particular scene from a 2008 episode because one of the subplots really hit home for me in this regard.\n\nHere's the scene and some summary context below:\n\nEnter Neela Rasgotra, a new surgeon who is starting her 24th straight hour on duty. She struggles to stay awake during her shift, even dozing off in the shower. She nearly takes off before a torn aorta procedure calls her back on. Throughout the episode, she is constantly asked to take care of procedures, has her judgement questioned, and worst of all, the daughter of a patient who lashed out in fury out at her in a previous episode returns with her grandfather.\n\nBy the end of the episode/shift/hour, she’s extremely exhausted, and, in her sleep-deprived state, makes a confession to her associate, Dr. Dubenko. She questions her job, mentioning that she’s still single, that she turns down potential dates to sleep from her long shifts, that she has nope hope of any potential relationship in her department, and worst of all, no one remembered her 31st birthday. Yet she stays devoted to her job thinking everything is okay when it’s not.\n\nDr. Dubenko then takes Neela out of the physicians’ lounge they are in to the ICU where families of the patients are. Asking Neela what she sees, she begins to respond by saying “A happy family”, but Dubenko interrupts, saying he sees a mother who nearly died from a torn aorta, but survived because of Neela’s critical diagnosis, and a grandfather who nearly died because of a bowel problem, but will be able to eat normally because of Neela’s quick thinking. Dubenko tells Neela no matter how many dates she turns down or how many babies her friends have, few can do what she did today. Dubenko tells her she has a gift, and that the minute she starts comparing herself to others is the minute she forgets she’s doing exactly what she was meant to do.\n\nAs she walks toward the exit of the ICU, the girl whose grandfather was in the ICU and who blamed Neela for the death of her mother in a previous episode, smiles and thanks Neela, which brightens her day just a little bit.\n\nIndeed, it is so easy to compare yourself to others and feel down on yourself because your life isn't like theirs. But I do believe that there is within each of us, a gift, a talent, a quality that makes every single one of us unique. Our job is to discover what this is, develop it, and embrace it without shame. The minute we avert our gaze to the side, or in any direction other than ahead as we run the marathon of life, we endanger ourselves in falling back with the crowd and losing sight of what gives us the advantage.\n\nAnd as a Christian, I need to constantly remind myself to trust that I am exactly where God wants me to be. Nothing in this world, not the seeming monotony of life, not my career aspirations, not a lack of relationship can alter God's will for me going into my 29th year of life, and beyond.\n\nSo whatever stage of life you're in, find that gift and use it without abandon to transform lives."
