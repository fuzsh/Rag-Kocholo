        "text": "Parminder Nagra and her husband, photographer James Stenson, welcomed a baby boy on Tuesday! Parminderâs rep told US Weekly that âMother, daddy and baby are all doing great.â They named their son Kai David Singh Stenson, which is pretty cute. Although Kai has become something of a standard baby name amongst celebrities – Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts named their second son Samuel Kai, and General Hospital star Ingo Rademacher named his son Peanut Kai. Kai is a Hawaiian name meaning âseaâ, and it is traditionally for boys.\n\nParminder Nagra, best known for her role as Dr. Neela Rasgotra on NBC’s ER, has welcomed a baby boy.\n\n“Parminder Nagra and her husband James Stenson are thrilled to announce the birth of their son, Kai David Singh Stenson,” her rep tells Usmagazine.com exclusively. “He was born on Tuesday, May 19. Mother, daddy and baby are all doing great.”\n\nUs reported last December that Nagra, 33, was expecting.\n\n“We are thrilled and overjoyed at the prospect of becoming first time parents,” she told Us at the time.\n\nA month later, Nagra and Stenson, a photographer, tied the knot.\n\nThe series finale of ER aired this past April.\n\n[From US Weekly]\n\nParminder and Stenson had been together for seven years when she got knocked up – they married only a month after she announced her pregnancy. Nothing wrong with a shotgun marriage, and they seem very happy and low-key. At their civil ceremony in California, ER friend and costar Maura Tierney officiated, and John Stamos played the drums, which is so cute. Congratulations to the happy family!"
