Parminder Nagra, who plays Dr. Neela Rasgotra on “ER,” and her photographer beau James Stenson, are expecting their first child this summer, the actress told US Weekly magazine. “We are thrilled and overjoyed at the prospect of becoming first-time parents,” Nagra told the mag. The couple, who have been together for nearly seven years, plan to eventually tie the knot, too. “Yes. our plans are to get married but there’s no confirmed date yet,” Nagra said. The 33-year-old actress, who was born in England, will continue to live in Los Angeles with Stenson.
