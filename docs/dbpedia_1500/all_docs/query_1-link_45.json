        "text": "Dirk is correct in stating that the non-conference SOS has its flaws. It only takes into account the won-lost records of who you played, not where you played the game, not the outcome of the game, and most importantly, not the strength of the team you played. For instance, for non-conference SOS purposes, a game at home against 9-6 Penn has a more positive impact on non-conference SOS than a game on the road against 7-5 Indiana because winning 9/15 games is a better decimal than winning 7/12.\n\nNon-conference SOS is not a predominant tool in selections.\n\nAgain, while non-conference SOS is a number referred to by the committee and the public, it is not the non-conference SOS that the committee looks at but the non-conference games with specifics that the committee looks at. Did you give the committee a picture of whether or not you should be in consideration for an at-large spot or a high seed in the tournament if you did not win your conference tournament?\n\nTHirt;544339 wrote: I think the rules are different for men... I believe you can only play in one exempt tournament per year, and cannot play in any individual tourney more than every four years. Neutral site events are different, such as our game against Northwestern a couple years ago... but there are only so many of those around. I know UD wanted to get another neutral game for this past season but couldn’t make it work. In general, these events love to have UD involved because of how well our fans travel, and it is a creative way for us to get games against better competition that wouldn’t agree to a home and home series.\n\nAnyway, I’m 100% sure UD would like to play more neutral site games, but we are a little limited there. Most bigger schools only want to play in these events if it is another big school.\n\nThe preseason tournaments remain by far our best way to get games against P5 schools.\n\nPosted via Mobile Device\n\nTHirt;544363 wrote: This would be great, and I think UD would happily trade a home game for one of these. There just are not that many opportunities that work. The rumored Ohio Classic with UD/UC/OSU/other would be perfect. A neutral game every year against an AAC/B1G/Big East school? Yes, please.\n\nOtherwise, I’m not sure who would agree... most of the schools that would be worth playing also want/need a certain # of home games. Maybe with Coach Grant’s southern ties, we can get a game against an SEC/ACC/AAC type opponent in Tennessee, Carolina, Georgia or somewhere which would be reasonable for the Flyer Faithful to travel.\n\nBetter yet, let’s get a game at the Q against say, Michigan State (I was unable to think of a realistic team kinda near Cleveland who would be willing to play us and also would be worth it for us to play. Suggestions?)\n\nPosted via Mobile Device\n\nTHirt;544363 wrote: This would be great, and I think UD would happily trade a home game for one of these.

Notably they played at Evansville so Tyler Zeller could have a game near his home in Indiana and played at Northern Iowa to get Marcus Paige a game back near his Iowa hometown.\n\nSterling Manley for them is going to be a junior next year and is from suburban Columbus. If they don't get something set up with Ohio State we could offer to play a neutral site game against them at Nationwide Arena and give them a home game on top of it.\n\nThey've got another guy, Jeremiah Francis, coming in from Columbus next year so that might make them more interested in playing a game there."
