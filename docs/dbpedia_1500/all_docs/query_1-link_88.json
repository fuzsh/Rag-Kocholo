        "text": "The Center for U.S. – Mexico Studies cordially invites you to its Lecture Series 2006 – 2007. This year’s series will highlight various perspectives on nanotechnology, geospatial science, geometry, Mexican reproductive behavior, and Mexican poetry and fiction.\n\nThe Center for U.S. – Mexico Studies, seeking to foster greater understanding between our two nations, is pleased to host and promote lectures on issues of interest to both Mexico and the U.S. Previous lectures have included such issues as the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), analysis of domestic politics and foreign policy, issues in science and technology, transborder population, and cultural development in both countries. The Center has hosted Carlos Fuentes, Andres Oppenheimer, Elena Poniatowska, Ana Maria Salazar, Monica Verea, Peter M. Ward, Victoria Rodriguez, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, Jacqueline Peschard, Arexi Urrutia, Mario Moises Alvarez, Adolfo Sanchez, Thomas Linehan, Larry D. Terry, Stephanie Newbold, Paul Ching-Wu Chu, Douglas Watson, and Juan Carlos Romero Hicks, among others, under the frame of this series.\n\nAnvar Zakhidov, Brian J.L. Berry, Jose Carlos Gomez Larranaga, Juan Guillermo Figueroa Perea, and C.M. Mayo are scheduled in this academic year. The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) students, faculty and staff, and those interested in U.S. – Mexico affairs from The University of Texas System (UT), from the metropolitan area of Dallas – Fort Worth, Institute of Physics of the University of Guanajuato, and the National Polytechnic Institute will benefit from the experience and expertise shared by these scholars.\n\nIf you have questions or need further information, please contact Naida Rodriguez, U.S.-Mexico Lecture Series Coordinator.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you in this series.\n\nAnvar Zakhidov\n\nInstitute of Physics, University of Guanajuato\n\n10:00 a.m., September 19, 2006, Leon, Guanajuato.

Baughman (UTD).\n\nCo-sponsored by the Institute of Physics, University of Guanajuato, Mexico\n\nDr. Anvar Zakhidov graduated “cum laude” (with distinction) from Tashkent Technical University ( Uzbekistan, USSR) in 1975, obtained his M.S. in 1977 and Ph.D. in Physics (Optics) from Institute of Spectroscopy of USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow in 1981. He spent five years in Japan ( Okazaki, Kyoto and Osaka) as Visiting Professor (1990-1995), and a year in Italy ( Bologna) at the Institute of Molecular Spectroscopy. From 1996 March until July 2000 he was a Senior Principal Scientist working with advanced materials at Honeywell Inc. (formerly AlliedSignal).\n\nHe is currently Institute Professor of Physics and Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at The University of Texas at Dallas. His “Nanophysics for Devices” research group of 4 Ph.D. researchers and 9 students (7 grad students, 2 undergrads) is actively involved in broad investigations of physical properties of advanced nanomaterials: carbon nanotubes, photonic crystals, organic and hybrid multilayers. They study electrical, thermal, optical, magnetic, photonic, MW, structural, etc. properties in wide temperature range from 2 K to 500 K, using state-of-the-art equipment: SQUID, PPMS,ESR, Raman, etc. with the aim to design and create novel types of electronic and photonic devices.\n\nBrian J.L. Berry\n\nMexican National Polytechnic Institute\n\n11:00 a.m., September 28, 2006, Mexico City\n\nThe Emergence of Geospatial Science\n\nCo-sponsored by the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City and the Mexican National Polytechnic Institute\n\nBrian J.L. Berry is Lloyd Viel Berkner Regental Professor. He received his B.Sc. (Economics) degree at University College, London in 1955, the M.A. in geography from the University of Washington in 1956 and the Ph.D. in 1958. He was a chaired professor at the University of Chicago (1958-1976) and at Harvard (1976-1981), followed by a period as dean of the Heinz School of Public Policy at Carnegie-Mellon University (1981-1986), joining UTD in 1986. In the 1960s his urban and regional research sparked geography’s social-scientific revolution and made him the most-cited geographer for more than 25 years. Subsequently, his inquiries have focused on long-wave dynamics and their relationships to macrohistorical phasing of economic development and political behavior. The author of more than 500 books and articles, he has attempted to bridge theory and practice via involvement in urban and regional development activities in both advanced and developing countries. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975, is a fellow of the British Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, AAAS and University College, London. He received the Victoria Medal from the Royal Geographical Society in 1988. In 1999 he became the first geographer and one of the few social scientists ever to serve as a member of the Council of the National Academy of Sciences and in 2004 he was one of the founding members of the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas (TAMEST). In 2005 Dr. Berry was the recipient of the Vautrin Lud Prize, the highest award that can be bestowed on a geographer and modeled after the Nobel Prize, which does not have a category for geography.\n\nAlberto Herrera-Gomez\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas, Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science 2.302\n\n9:00 a.m., October 10, 2006, Richardson, TX.
