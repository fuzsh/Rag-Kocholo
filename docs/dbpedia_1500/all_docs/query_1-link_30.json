Submit obituary content and photos with contact information and telephone number to citizencontent@losalamosdailypost.com.\n\nGORDON NEAL KEATING 1966–Feb. 14, 2013\n\nGordon Neal Keating of Los Alamos, New Mexico died peacefully February 14, after a lengthy illness. He passed away at home surrounded by close family and friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his mother, Jody Keating, and is survived by his father, Richard Keating (of Edwardsville, IL.), wife, Elizabeth, daughters, Flannery and Zoë, and brother Phillip (of Denver, Colo.)\n\nHe grew up in Edwardsville, IL., and attended Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. He was passionate about geology, especially volcanology. After college, Gordon worked for the U.S. Geological Survey at the Cascade Volcano Observatory where he met Elizabeth.\n\nThey moved together to Houghton, Mich., where Gordon obtained a Masters Degree in Geology from Michigan Technological University in 1991. Later, they moved to New Mexico with two young daughters and he received his PhD in Geology from the University of New Mexico in 2000.\n\nSince 1995, Gordon has worked for Los Alamos National Laboratory. He published numerous papers in volcanology, helping to develop eruption and erosion histories for volcanic centers in Nevada.\n\nHe also contributed to projects related to energy sustainability. Those around him not only appreciated his sharp scientific mind, but also his gift for communication. Gordon was an attentive listener, and his flare for humor and light-heartedness was a keystone of his contributions to the scientific community.\n\nGordon was always clear that family was his first priority. He was a loving husband and devoted father to his two daughters. He worked a part-time work schedule for many years, to make it possible to be home with ‘his girls’ and organized many family backpacking, camping, rafting, canoeing and cycling trips.\n\nGordon’s gift for working with young people extended beyond the close family – he also felt a strong commitment to working with the youth groups at the Unitarian Church of Los Alamos. He was very generous in his time and energy with the UCLA.\n\nMany people who know Gordon think of him first as a musician. He played string instruments since age 9, including violin, guitar and mandolin. Gordon loved traditional music, particularly Irish and Oldtime American, and played them with great skill and feeling.\n\nHe played for many years in a local traditional music band and was generous in sharing his knowledge and talent with band members old and new. He was as generous with his time as he was with his talent, playing in many community and charity events over the years.\n\nA Celebration of his Life will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday, Feb 20 at the Unitarian Church of Los Alamos with a reception to follow.\n\nKATHERINE (PAT) PATTERSON KRIKORIAN Oct. 25, 1921–Feb. 10, 2013\n\nROBERT H. SPRINGER Nov. 3, 1920–Jan. 21, 2013\n\nRemembering the Life of Robert H. Springer: Robert was born in Chicago, Ill at the beginning of the roaring 20’s. His Dad was a pharmacist and owned a drug store.\n\nDuring the 20’s, they packed up and took a touring Ford and drove across country to California and settled in Covina.\n\nHe grew up there and lived through the Great Depression. He had some interesting adventures such as finding and repairing a chain driven motorcycle, which he kept secret from his parents.\n\nDuring the 30’s, he bought a Model A Ford in peach baskets, and put it together and souped it up. He raced his Dad in a 1936 Ford and made the mistake of winning. Of course, he was forced to sell the car. In his late teens, be became a theater projectionist and began college. World War II broke out and in 1942, he enlisted.\n\nOne of his commanding officers sent him off to Officers Candidate School. He was commissioned and assigned to the 5th Army signal corps under General Mark Clark. While overseas he met his wife to be, a nurse named Margaret. When they came back to the states, they were married in the Little Church Around the Corner in New York City, May 28, 1945.\n\nHe was to be on the beaches of Japan during the invasion, filming the landing in color and sound for the Generals back home. Fortunately, the Bomb was finished and saved him and unknown numbers of casualties on both sides when Japan surrendered. He, like many GI’s, came back to no jobs. He found one with RCA and became a field service engineer installing and repairing real theater systems.\n\nHe installed the sound system in William Randolph Hearst’s San Simeon castle in California. After finishing the system, he sat in Hearst’s special chair and watched a movie to make sure that everything was working properly. Shortly after this time he was let go from RCA. He found a job at American Broadcasting Company TV in Hollywood. He worked there in general field servicing until the advent of video tape. He quickly took to this new technology and eventually rose to the department head. During that time, he and his crew pioneered the cutting and splicing of the tape to produce a useable air time show.\n\nThis was 2” mylar tape and computers with enough memory to provide storage and editing didn’t exist. Toward the end of his career he was given some plumb jobs such as designing the studio for the old Palladium Theater in Hollywood. This was for the show The Hollywood Palace, which is where Raquel Welch was first discovered as one of the sign girls to introduce the next act. He was also involved with the Lawrence Welk show and knew many of the band members from that time.\n\nAfter 28 years there, he retired. For a while, he had a small home business of rebuilding video tape capstan assemblies. This was critical to adjusting the speed of the tape to allow machines to interchangeably play tapes. He also did gun smithing, something he really enjoyed.\n\nIn the mid 90’s he and Marge moved to Albuquerque and lived there. After Marge passed away in 2000, he lived in the general area until 2010 when he came to live in Los Alamos. For the first year here, he lived with his son and wife until they could no longer provide facilities for easy bathing, etc. He then moved to Aspen Ridge, which he really enjoyed. But after a few hospitalizations, his strength and general health required him to be in the Sombrillo Nursing Home. He was there for about seven months before he passed away.\n\nHe lived an interesting and full life until about the last year. He is now free of his worn body and in peaceful rest in God’s kingdom.\n\nA memorial service for Robert H. Springer will be held at 10 a.m. Friday, Feb. 15, 2013 at Trinity on the Hill Episcopal Church, 3900 Trinity Dr. in Los Alamos.\n\nBENJAMIN WHITMORE July 18, 1980–Jan. 18, 2013\n\nBenjamin David (Ben) Whitmore, age 32, died unexpectedly at his home in Albuquerque Jan. 18, 2013.\n\nBen was born in Bozeman, Mont., July 18, 1980.

His grandfather (Papa) Dave Swanson taught him to play golf, tie flies and took him camping along the rivers to fly fish. He spent many happy times with family in Montana, New Mexico and Colorado.\n\nBen and Desiree (Gilpin) McBrayer had a daughter Mikayla in 2001, a primary focus of Ben’s life. He was a devoted father, reveling in Mikayla’s academic and athletic accomplishments.\n\nThey enjoyed time together playing board games, musical instruments, riding bikes, camping and just hanging out. Ben and Mikayla enjoyed watching the antics of his dog (Sasha) and cat (Darby) playing together.\n\nBen had recently begun taking Mikayla to some of the places that he had enjoyed growing up, including Chaco Canyon, Tsankawi and Bandelier.\n\nThey had many more trips in New Mexico and Montana on their wish list.\n\nBen was loving and kind. He could talk for hours with close friends and family. Some of his longest heart-to-hearts were with his sister Lora, with whom he shared a close bond that started in childhood.\n\nHe was a mix of philosopher and debater, engaging us all in discussions on many topics. He loved the out-of-doors, golf games, scuba diving, watching football, camping and fishing trips with family and friends.\n\nBen, we know you didn’t mean to leave so soon. We love you and will miss you. You will be remembered fondly.\n\nA fund for Ben’s daughter, “Mikayla Whitmore College Fund” has been set up at Los Alamos National Bank. Supporting his daughter’s education was one of Ben’s highest priorities.\n\nSELMA KRON Nov. 11 1931–Jan. 13, 1931\n\nSelma Kron, 81, passed away on Jan. 13, 2013 in the presence of her beloved family.

He was born, the second twin, June 6, 1930, to Bruno A. Hoffman and Anna Angeline (Karels) Hoffman.\n\nGordy spent his early life on the family farm in Rosen, MN. At age 13, as a freshman, he entered Nazareth Hall Minor Seminary in the Twin Cities, and following graduation from Naz Hall, attended the St. Paul Seminary. After completing eight years of college and post-graduate education, he was ordained to the Roman Catholic Priesthood in June 1956.\n\nHe served eight years at St. Francis de Sales German National parish in the West 7th Street neighborhood of St. Paul. In 1964, he was transferred to St. Joseph Church in Hopkins, MN, where he was assigned until 1968. “Crazy Gordy” leaves legions of friends in both parishes. He was known for initiating fun activities for seniors, youth, and other parish members, most famously hay rides, picnics, canoe and ski trips. His love of sports, athletic activities, and physical fitness was legendary, at every opportunity playing hockey on Twin Cities neighborhood rinks and handball with St. Paul police and firemen.\n\nGordy’s decision to leave the active ministry led him to study Spanish at the American University in Puerto Rico and to participate in the pastoral chaplaincy program at Ft. Logan in Denver, Colo. Acting on a suggestion from his colleague and good friend, Jack Dolan, he entered Adams State College in Alamosa, Colo, to pursue a master’s degree in Guidance and Counseling. It was there that he met his future wife, Wendy Rawson. After their 1971 graduation, they were married March 4, 1972, celebrating their 40th anniversary earlier this year. Gordy and Wendy were blessed with not only their two children, Nicholas Joseph and Angela Eileen, but with their many friends who became a whole family of “extra kids” at Hoffman House.\n\nHe accepted a position as Guidance Counselor at Los Alamos High School in 1971 and retired in 1997 after 26 years of service. He then obtained his realtor’s license, with many of his sales being to former students, who continued to seek his assistance whatever profession he might be practicing. He cherished his association with Mary Deal Realty and the Deal family, whom he considered among his dearest friends.\n\nGordy leaves a legacy of love and inspiration far too extensive to detail, but he will always be known for his dedication to physical fitness, for his soccer & hockey coaching philosophy of making sure the kids had fun while developing skills, and for his own active lifestyle and love of the outdoors.\n\nThroughout his life, he remained an active supporter of Laketrails canoe base camp on Lake of the Woods, having attended its 60th reunion in August. He played his last hockey game at 73 and never gave up his passion for the sport he loved most, to the extent of building – in his garage – a whole set of new boards for the Los Alamos Ice Rink, in the days when the rink was powered by volunteer labor. When Nick and Angela were playing varsity collegiate sports, he spent hours arranging flights or road trips to their games, and through these travels, he and Wendy gained yet another family of young teammates, many of whom have remained lifelong friends.\n\nMost of all, Gordy will be remembered as someone who inspired instant affection from those with whom he interacted. He never met a stranger, forgave easily, loved deeply, and lived life to its absolute fullest. He was truly larger than life.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 40 years, and his children, Nick (Dr. Peggy C. MacLean Hoffman) and Angela (Dr. Marcos J. Gutierrez). Gordy considered his son- and daughter-in-law to be his own children, and he adored the three grandsons they gave him, James Gordon and Joseph Marcos Gutierrez, and Camden Joseph Hoffman. He is also survived by his twin brother, Maurice M. (Agnes) Hoffman, and his sister Kathleen (Gene) Wolfe, as well as numerous nieces and nephews. He was a member of a very large Minnesota extended family, so he also leaves countless cousins and their families who loved him dearly. Also left behind are his “co-padres,” George and Denise MacLean and Marcie and George McClaflin, his “extra” daughters-in-law, Nancy MacLean Davidson and Jenna Lapaglia, and his very special friend and helper, Joe Chavez.\n\nGordy was predeceased by his parents; his parents-in-law, H.T. and Mary Eileen Rawson; brothers, Roland and Richard Hoffman; sisters, Regina Hoffman Collins and Eveleth Hoffman Rowe, his brothers-in-law, Robert Collins and Dan Rowe; plus one feline and seven beloved canine best friends.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be Monday, Dec. 10, at 11 a.m. at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church.

She won awards for her preaching and identified a need to serve small churches, moving to Wisconsin to lead three Presbyterian congregations over the next 15 years: Weyauwega, Wausaukee, and Athelstane. Her parishioners noted that her Scottish accent brought a certain authenticity to her powerful sermons and her sense of humor and life experiences brought God’s love to their hearts. One of her more memorable children’s sermons focused on the question: what is God’s favorite color? She suggested it was tartan—a fabric woven of many colors with special meaning for those who wear it. (She was of the Thomson clan and wore the Thomson dress blue tartan.)\n\nShe served leadership roles in regional Presbytery committees and local community outreach, establishing monthly open-house dinner for anyone in town, a food pantry for those in need, mission programs, and serving as chaplain for local hospice and sheriffs’ departments. Her work mentoring women in the church created a ripple effect, with more than eight women in different denominations entering ministry with her encouragement and guidance. For many years, she led small, personalized group tours from the States to Scotland, sharing her country, life-long friends, and favorite Celtic spiritual “thin places” with many from Los Alamos and Wisconsin. Upon retirement in 2006, she returned to Los Alamos, where she continued ministry with invited Sundays in Chimayo, Truchas, Peñasco, Magdelena, Jemez Springs, and Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Los Alamos.\n\nAnne’s survivors include her daughter, Alison Grieggs; son-in-law, Tony Grieggs, and granddaughter, Roxanne of Los Alamos; her son, Bruce Caughran, daughter-in-law, Octavia Kincaid; granddaughter, Ailsa, and grandson, James of Oak Park, Illinois; dear friends and family in Scotland and the States; and three congregations.\n\nCelebrations of Anne’s life and ministry are planned for August with memorial services in Los Alamos at United Church and Weyawega, Wisconsin at the First Presbyterian Church (dates to be announced.) If you wish, memorials may be made to Ambercare Hospice [410 South Paseo de Oñate, Española, New Mexico 87532], who provided exceptional comfort and care to Anne and her family.

He was larger than life in his six-foot-two-inch frame, integrity was how he lived his life, but, his defining characteristic was his tremendous love for his family. Pete never met a stranger so, being a master carpenter by trade, he’ll no doubt, have much to talk over with Jesus.\n\nCheers Dad; to a life well lived!

Lois, his beloved wife of 62 years, preceded him in death last summer. Don was born in Brookings, South Dakota to Valde and Sue Petersen. He served during WWII as a Navy ensign, and was scheduled to pilot an amphibious landing craft in the planned invasion of the Japanese mainland. He married Lois Ullman of Brookings in 1949. He received a B.S. in chemistry and zoology from DePauw University, an M.S. in biochemistry from South Dakota State University and a Ph.D. in pharmacology from the University of Chicago, where he then taught from 1954 to 1956.\n\nHe and Lois moved to Los Alamos in 1956 where they raised four children. He worked as a scientist in LASL’s Biological Research Group H-4, and during his long and varied career with LANL, served as Section and Group Leader for Cell Biology and as Division Leader for the Life Sciences Division. He also served as Program Manager for Department of Defense Health Effects Programs and as a member of the Advanced Concepts Group. In retirement, he continued to serve on editorial boards, committees and advisory panels on radiation effects, radiotherapy and other interests for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command. He was a charter member of the Los Alamos Education Group and an insightful and widely published essayist, advocating for the expanded use of nuclear energy.\n\nDon was a loving husband and father, a brilliant scientist, an enthusiastic gardener and avid outdoorsman. He was fond of horses, German shorthaired pointers, hunting and fishing. He was a tireless tinkerer- framing pictures, tying flies, reloading shotgun shells and myriad other projects in his basement workshop. He learned carpentry in his 40’s, hiring and working alongside a master carpenter to completely remodel his North Community group 12 home. He was generous with the community, offering his skills as both a pharmacologist (performing emergency toxicology for drug overdose cases at the Medical Center), and marksman (tranquilizing and relocating bears that strayed into Los Alamos neighborhoods). His memory was astounding and his encyclopedic recall of off-color jokes and limericks was legendary. His life, though not without tragedy (the beautiful home he transformed and landscaped was destroyed in the Cerro Grande fire), was a textbook example of how one can work hard and have a lot of fun at the same time.\n\nHe is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Hans Petersen and Tracee Hudson of Cedar Crest, daughter Christine and Lee Huffman of Santa Fe, grandson Troy Huffman of Las Vegas, daughter Sarah and Jo Bridge of Tijeras, son Carl and Susan Petersen and grandsons Oskar and Gunnar all of Albuquerque, brother Dick of Livingston, Montana and brother Daryl of Brookings, South Dakota. His parents, his wife Lois, and his grandson Nolan Huffman preceded him in death. Funeral arrangements are pending. In lieu of flowers the family requests that donations be made to the American Cancer Society."
