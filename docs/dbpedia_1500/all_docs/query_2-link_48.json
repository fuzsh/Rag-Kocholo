        "text": "By Rob Nikolewski │ New Mexico Watchdog\n\nSANTA FE — One of the features touted by the taxpayer-funded Rail Runner Express commuter train is the use of free Wi-Fi so patrons can work on their personal computers as they ride between Albuquerque and Santa Fe.\n\nBut commuters have told New Mexico Watchdog the Wi-Fi system is spotty at best and some of them have simply given up trying to log on.\n\n“It’s frustrating,” said Donna Shaffers, who commutes between her home in Rio Rancho and her work place in Santa Fe. “It’s a one-hour ride for me and I’d like to be able to do some work on my computer, but I can’t.”\n\nNew Mexico Watchdog approached five commuters last Wednesday at the South Capitol Station in Santa Fe. All five said they were regular customers on the Rail Runner and all five said they had major problems logging on to the train’s free Wi-Fi system.\n\n“I’d like to get stuff done on my computer but the Wi-Fi never seems to work,” said Derek Van Lee of Albuquerque.\n\nAugusta Meyers. communications manager for the Rio Metro Regional Transit District, acknowledged the Wi-Fi system has had problems for months along an eight-mile stretch in the Waldo Canyon area of the Rail Runner route.\n\n“We have a tower down,” Meyers said, citing an incident that occurred back in September.\n\nBut that was four months ago. Why is it taking so long to get fixed?\n\nMeyers referred New Mexico Watchdog to the New Mexico Department of Transportation.\n\nNMDOT Rail Bureau Chief William Craven blamed multiple incidents of theft at the base of one of the repeater towers on the corridor.\n\n“The solar batteries that store power for the communications equipment and several solar panels that provide power to the batteries were stolen,” Craven said in an email. “The cabinet holding the communications equipment was destroyed. Stronger locks and other security devices installed on the cabinets after the initial break-in were either stolen or destroyed.”\n\nSo what’s taken so long?\n\n“Replacements for the stolen equipment will not be installed until there is an effective security system in place,” Craven said, but didn’t give an estimate on when that might happen.\n\nWhile Meyers said the Wi-Fi problems are restricted to an eight-mile stretch, a number of commuters told New Mexico Watchdog they’ve experienced problems throughout the system and that the service has been spotty for years.\n\n“I don’t use it very much but whenever I do, I can never get on,” said William Zinn, who said he’s been riding the Rail Runner for five years. “It’s been this way since they announced they had Wi-Fi.”\n\n“There have been issues with Wi-Fi service performance throughout the corridor,” Craven admitted.\n\nTed Gaudette, information systems officer with Rio Metro, confirmed that up until December, there were “problems for an extended period of time” but insists they’ve been fixed.\n\n“We had a bad period where (the Wi-Fi connection on) the cars were dropping like files on the fleet,” Gaudette said.\n\nHe said the contractor, Presidio, has fixed the problem so that commuters should be able to get up to a 3G connection.\n\n“They finished replacing (the power supplies) in December so it hasn’t been long so I suspect some of the passengers have had a bad taste dating back to last summer when we had cars going down,” Gaudette said.\n\nGaudette said commuters should be able to get consistent connections now, but not through the eight-mile stretch near Waldo Canyon until NMDOT repairs the problems at the repeater tower. And there’s no timetable for that yet.\n\nGaudette pointed to a link on the Rail Runner website where customers can lodge Wi-Fi complaints. Click here for that link.\n\n“If there are problems, we will look at it and fix it the best we can,” Gaudette said.\n\nThe Wi-Fi issue is part of a larger debate about the Rail Runner since its launch.\n\nCreated with the strong support and the political influence of former Gov. Bill Richardson, the Rail Runner has been praised by supporters as a forward-thinking project that promises to alleviate traffic problems along the busy Interstate 25 corridor that runs between Santa Fe and the greater Albuquerque area.\n\n“This is a historic day in New Mexico,” Richardson told reporters from a passenger rail car when the Albuquerque-Santa Fe leg was completed in December 2008. “Because what we’re doing today is changing transportation in the state.”\n\nThe train has its share of critics.\n\nTaxpayers who live outside the Rail Runner route complain about having to pay for a train that doesn’t service their towns. State Sen. George Muñoz, D-Gallup, unsuccessfully tried to pass a bill in the 2012 legislative session to create an excise tax applying only to those who live in counties serviced by the Rail Runner while exempting taxpayers who don’t.\n\n“Why are we paying for it when we don’t get to use it?” Muñoz asked at the time.\n\nIn addition, fiscal conservatives howled about costs.\n\nOriginally estimated by Richardson at $122 million, the figure was later adjusted to $400 million and by January 2012, the estimated infrastructure costs jumped to $843.3 million.\n\nThere are also two balloon payments totaling $230 million that come due to taxpayers starting in 2024.\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski\n\nBy Rob Nikolewski │ New Mexico Watchdog\n\nSANTA FE — The federal government is expected to pick up tab to repair road damage sustained during last month’s record rainfall.\n\nThe head of the New Mexico Department of Transportation told New Mexico Watchdog he expects the federal government to pay the $20-million repair bill.\n\n“At this time we anticipate that all of the requested funds will be reimbursed to the state,” NMDOT Secretary-designate Tom Church said in an email.\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration already has released $2 million in emergency relief funds in the aftermath of the flooding. NMDOT has sent the feds a revised request for an additional $17.8 million.\n\nEarlier this month, some state lawmakers questioned the price tag because they heard of initial estimates of $9 million, but NMDOT officials confirmed the $20 million figure, saying it has been verified by the federal agency.\n\nWhile getting the feds to pay for the repairs sounds like good news, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., offers a note of caution.\n\n“The money isn’t free,” Emily Goff said Friday. “It’s coming from somewhere. Some motorists and taxpayers somewhere are paying for that.”\n\nGoff said a more fiscally efficient way to pay for highway repairs would have individual states shoulder a larger burden.\n\n“If the state isn’t picking up the tab, there is often zero incentive for states to spend those dollars wisely,” Goff said. “For example, when it comes to selecting bids for road construction, you want sure the contracts are going to the lowest or best bidder. There’s less incentive for that if the federal government is paying the bill … It’s like the millions and billions spent in stimulus money.”\n\nThe fall monsoon season wreaked havoc on New Mexico’s roads, in particular in rural communities. The town of Mogollon in Catron County in the western part of the state saw a two-mile stretch washed out that is estimated to eat up $13 million of the repair costs.\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski\n\nBy Rob Nikolewski │ New Mexico Watchdog\n\nSANTA FE – Flooding in the state last month was a once-in-a-century event, the New Mexico Secretary-designate of the Department of Transportation said.\n\nBut some lawmakers are questioning nearly $20 million to repair roads damaged by the downpours.\n\nIn particular, a two-mile stretch in Catron County estimated to cost taxpayers $13 million to repair and a two-tenths-of-a-mile stretch in Socorro County that the DOT says will cost $3.075 million.\n\n“I question whenever we’re told at a meeting that it’s $6 million and then it jumps to $20 million,” state Sen. Clemente Sanchez, D-Grants, said after a hearing of the Transportation Infrastructure Revenue Subcommittee at the Roundhouse. “I wonder about that. I heard it was going to be $6 million at a commission meeting in Zuni (Pueblo).”\n\nAt first, DOT Secretary-designate Tom Church said he would have to take a closer look at the cost estimates for the two projects but after speaking to one of his district engineers, Church said the figures were accurate.\n\nThe Catron County repair between mile markers 8 and 10 on New Mexico Route 159 “involves a complete slope realignment,” Church said, and the Socorro County project between mile markers 23 and 23.2 on NM 1 is expensive because it requires “an entire streambed alignment.”\n\n“The big one that jumps out is the $13 million (project),” said Rep. Larry Larrañaga, R-Albuquerque, a longtime Roundhouse veteran and a cabinet secretary at DOT under Govs. Toney Anaya and Garrey Carruthers in the 1980s. “Unless it’s a bridge or some big structure, I would think maybe those numbers have to be reviewed again.”\n\nAt the same time, Larrañaga said he wouldn’t be surprised if the overall cost of the repair project exceeds the $19.845 million price tag Church gave to the subcommittee to repair some 92 locations.\n\n“Outside of that $13 million project, I would suspect all of the other numbers are pretty low,” Larrañaga said, pointing to 31 projects that came in at $10,000 or less. “You couldn’t even get contractors relocated for some of the amounts they’re showing there.”\n\nThe DOT handed out photos of some of the washed-out areas.\n\nHere’s a picture of the washout on Route 159 in Catron County:\n\n“Personally, I think this is a hundred-year flood,” Church, a 21-year veteran of the DOT told New Mexico Watchdog. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”\n\nOf the 92 projects listed on a spreadsheet, the Catron and Socorro projects make up 81 percent of the nearly $20 million requested to fix the roads.\n\n“I just question the numbers we’ve been given here,” said Sanchez. “I’m not saying they’re lying. They just need to a little more research to see if those are accurate numbers … I’m kind of a hawk on that with taxpayers’ dollars.”\n\nThe subcommittee passed a motion to have state agencies, including the Legislative Finance Committee, work with the DOT to look into the costs and funding of the proposed project.\n\nHere’s NM Watchdog video of Sen. Sanchez and Rep. Larrañaga:\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski\n\nFirst the Torrance County Commission angered open government advocates by trying to restrict and even ban cameras from their public meetings.\n\nThen there were questions about whether one commissioner who also worked at the Department of Transportation should be allowed to remain.\n\nNow there’s yet another controversy for the commission that represents 16,000 residents in the county located within the metropolitan area of Albuquerque: over a financial investigation conducted by State Auditor Hector Balderas.\n\nCommissioners on Wednesday (May 9) voted to draft a letter complaining that Balderas has talked to the media about his audit of the county before he talked to the commission itself — something the commissioners say is a violation of state policy.\n\nBalderas has fired back, saying the commission is simply try to obstruct the investigation into some $700,000 of county contracts that ended up going to a single vendor.\n\nAs reported by KOB-TV, commissioner Lonnie Freyburger said Balders “is in violation of [state] policy [by talking to the media about details of the audit] and I would like for the county to send a letter of complaint to the state auditor that we don’t like it.”\n\nBalderas responds by saying he has not released any details of the investigation and the audit hasn’t been completed.\n\n“They are using their official power to hire lawyers to jam the audit and its improper use of public dollars,” Balderas told KOB-TV. “They should not be asking any lawyers to engage in obstructing an audit, especially when it’s required by state law.”\n\nFreyburger has been in the center of the debate about cameras at commission hearings and he’s also been questioned about whether he should even serve on the commission at all.\n\nAs we reported last month, Freyburger — who was employed by the state Department of Transportation — appeared to be in conflict with the State Personnel Act and the State Personnel Board Rule relating to classified state employees and their ability to hold public or political office.\n\nSince then, the Mountain View Telegraph reported that Freyburger has retired from his DOT position and showed a reporter from the Telegraph a 2011 e-mail from the DOT human resources director saying that “it is allowable” for employees to serve in public office as long as they recuse themselves from voting on matters that could be a conflict of interest — something that appears to directly contradict state personnel rules.\n\nThe Telegraph reports an investigation is underway by the DOT. Freyburger — who has served on the commission for more than a year — told the newspaper that although he retired from the DOT he will “pursue legal alternatives.”\n\n***\n\nTo see the KOB-TV report about the flap between the commissioners and Balderas, click here.\n\nAnd to get some background on the controversy over cameras at commission hearings, click here.\n\nSome county commissioners in Torrance County have a real problem with cameras.\n\nTwo months ago, they flirted with violating not only the state’s Open Meetings Act but the US Constitution when they introduced a resolution banning the public from recording their commission hearings.\n\nThat resolution has since been tabled but now a revision has been introduced and that’s causing another flap.\n\nThe revised proposal calls for:\n\n1) 24 hours written notice for any recording of meetings\n\n2) requires cameras to be pointed only at commissioners, not members of the public who may be addressing commissioners\n\n3) requires all members of the media and the public recording meetings to be placed in a designated area\n\n“We were getting interrupted and different things and there was editing being done on the YouTube and we wanted to get a true and accurate recording of what was going on,” commissioner Lonnie Freyburger told KOB-TV last week.\n\nBut Gwyneth Doland of the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government says the restrictions — especially the demand for 24-hour written notice and directing the cameras to focus only on commissioners — are way out of line.\n\n“This proposed policy is absolutely unacceptable,” Doland told Capitol Report New Mexico. “I don’t understand what the commission is so afraid of.”\n\nTaping commission meetings have been a sore spot for members of the commission — especially Freyburger, who complained earlier this year that “the meetings are being edited and commented on inaccurately.”\n\nA member of the public, Edwina “George” Hewett, has videotaped commission hearings and strenuously denied the videotape she uploads on YouTube segments has distorted the proceedings, saying the only time the camera is turned off is when she changes batteries. Besides, Hewett says, “the segments are in place for the comfort of the public, not the comfort of the commission.”\n\nThe commissioners are discussing having the county record the meetings and place the video on the county’s website.\n\nBut that does not — and should not — preclude the right of members of the public and the media from recording Torrance County commission meetings that are held in a public facility paid for with county taxpayer dollars, Doland says.\n\n“This seems like a misguided effort to control the public’s effort to see the working of the Torrance County Commission,” Doland said.\n\nWhat’s the basis for her argument against the county’s proposal?\n\n“It’s called the First Amendment,” Doland said with a laugh. “That and the Open Meetings Act.”\n\nThe act applies to public bodies constituting a quorum of members discussing public business, formulating public policy or taking any such action.\n\nThe act requires governing bodies give the public 24 hours notice of the a scheduled meeting but does not require the public or reporters to give advance notice to governing bodies that members of the public or the media will record the meetings.\n\nFreyburger has argued that the cameras can be disruptive and while Doland acknowledges that sometimes equipment can occasionally be distracting, “demanding 24 hours’ notice [for the public and reporters] is unreasonable.”\n\n“I am certain it is possible to come to a reasonable compromise,” Doland said, adding that “I’m confident in their hearts commissioners want to preserve public access.”\n\nIn an article in the Mountain View Telegraph, county attorney Dennis Wallin said he’ll work with the fire marshal to find an appropriate area in the chambers for people with cameras.\n\nBut if passed, the new proposal could spark a lawsuit — something the county of 16,000 located in the Albuquerque metropolitan area can ill-afford — and the issue in a larger context has roiled some residents who think their right to be heard is in jeopardy.\n\n“To … put citizens in a pen in the back of the room is not an acceptable use of your power,” Ched MacQuiqq said at a commission hearing last Wednesday (April 11).\n\n“We are now getting closer to what we need to do so that all involved can attend meetings, watch the meetings in their entirety, and hopefully move forward,” Freyburger told a reporter from the Telegraph in an e-mail.\n\nFreyburger himself has a knack for getting in the news.\n\nBack in 2008, he and his wife Lois won $500,000 in the state lottery’s Scratchers game.\n\nAnd now there’s a discussion over whether he’s even eligible to sit on the Torrance County Commission — where Freyburger has served for the last 15 months.\n\nThat’s because Freyburger is a classified employee at the New Mexico Department of Transportation.\n\nBut there could be a conflict with the State Personnel Act and the State Personnel Board Rule relating to classified state employees and their ability to hold public or political office.\n\nAccording to an article in the Telegraph, NMDOT adjutant secretary Mike McEntee said classified employees “may hold only a nonpartisan county or municipal political office” and may only do so “if … they are authorized full-time continuous leave without pay.”\n\nMcEntee said Freyburger was notified of this after another NMDOT employee who sought to run as a Democrat for the Torrance County Commission withdrew from an upcoming election.\n\n“McEntee did not know why the DOT was not aware of the conflict [involving Freyburger] before now,” the Telegraph story said.\n\nFreyburger told McEntee he doesn’t intend to resign as commissioner or step down from his job at DOT. A meeting is scheduled to resolve the matter.\n\n“The department has always treated me fairly, and I expect them to treat me fairly now,” Freyburger told the Telegraph.\n\n****\n\nHere’s the KOB-TV story regarding the latest camera proposal in Torrance County:\n\nA member of the state Transportation Commission called the balloon payments that taxpayers are facing in funding the Rail Runner as a “hand grenade” that the Department of Transportation is trying to defuse.\n\nPete Rahn and DOT secretary Alvin Dominguez appeared before the Transportation and Public Works Committee on Monday (Jan. 16) and expressed their concerns about how the department can grapple with keeping the state’s roads in decent shape with diminishing public and federal dollars while the Rail Runner’s costs add an extra layer of complications.\n\n“The major problem is the 100 percent [of] state road fund dollars going to pay for the capital investment, the $420 million in capital investment that was made into the Rail Runner,” Dominguez told Capitol Report New Mexico after the hearing. “It drains dollars that should be going into our roadways.”\n\nThen there are the two estimated $235 million balloon payments that must be paid between 2024-2026.\n\n“It’s a huge obstacle,” Rahn told lawmakers, adding the balloon payments represent “a hand grenade set in our modeling.”\n\nI spoke to Rahn right after the committee meeting:\n\nSo what are some of the possible solutions?\n\n“Well at this point, we’re looking at the way the bonds were financed and possible restructuring of the bonds,” Dominguez said. “Hopefully that will save us some money in the long run.”\n\nThe Rail Runner was a darling of former Gov. Bill Richardson, and opened in 2006 and was extended in 2008 at a total cost of about $385 million. To its supporters, the Rail Runner offers people in the Albuquerque-Santa Fe area an affordable way to commute back and forth while lessening the expected congestion and pollution from cars in the coming years.\n\nBut the rail has plenty of detractors who have criticized its cost to construct and its chronic financial losses. Gov. Richardson billed the cost of building the Rail Runner at $122 million. The figure was later adjusted to $400 million and last summer, the estimated infrastructure costs jumped to $843.3 million.\n\nAmong the fiscal challenges before the DOT is replacing $5.4 million in federal funds that have expired.\n\n“We know there’s local support for the Rail Runner,” Rahn told committee members Monday but said the DOT budget officers “do not have the financial wherewithal to put more money into the Rail Runner.”\n\nLoved by some, cursed by others, the Rail Runner is now a Monday through Friday public employee.\n\nOn Friday (June 17), the the Rio Metro Regional Transit District Board voted to eliminate weekend service for the Rail Runner Express due to state budgetary constraints, starting in mid to late August.\n\nHere are the details from a news release:\n\nThe board had been considering two weekday schedule options to address the budget reduction, but in a six-to-five vote earlier today, board members instead took action to eliminate weekend service to balance the Fiscal Year 2012 Federal budget.\n\n“This was originally envisioned as a commuter service, and that’s the piece we want to maintain without affecting anybody”, said Steve Shaw, Chairman of the Rio Metro Board. “While we recognize the weekend service from a tourism and convenience point of view, we think it’s more important to support the initial mission of the train without affecting the people who use it to get to and from work.”\n\nWhen service began to Santa Fe in 2008, a portion of that service was paid for with CMAQ funds – Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Funds – which can only be used for a three-year period to support operations based on federal regulations. That three-year clock runs out in FY12, and has resulted in a 1.2 million dollar budget reduction. To date, there has been no alternative funding source identified to make up the difference.\n\n“We’re having ongoing conversations with the state looking at all options”, said Dewey Cave, Executive Director for the Mid-Region Council of Governments. “We’re partners in this endeavor and we’re looking at every option available to minimize the impact of service cuts.”\n\nThe commuter rail system — a darling of then Gov. Bill Richardson — opened in 2006 and was extended in 2008 at a total cost of about $385 million. For its supporters, the Rail Runner offers people in the Albuquerque-Santa Fe area an affordable way to commute back and forth while lessening the expected congestion and pollution from cars in the coming years.\n\nBut the rail has plenty of detractors who have criticized its cost to construct and its chronic financial losses. Last December, members of the Legislative Finance Committee were shocked to hear that the Department of Transportation had spent $5 million on nearly 200 miles of track that has no plans for being used. And on top of that, the track — which was purchased from from BNSF Railway Company between Lamy and the Colorado border — could put the state on the hook for $6 million a year in maintenance because of 10 potential environmental “hotspots” along the line.\n\nFull disclosure: Capitol Report New Mexico is funded by the Rio Grande Foundation, which has been a sharp critic of the Rail Runner since its inception.\n\nGov. Susana Martinez is scheduled to make a public appearance late Friday afternoon. We’ll try to get a reaction from her regarding today’s news.\n\nUpdate: Here’s the governor’s reaction:\n\nYou’ve heard of the “Bridge to Nowhere” in Alaska.\n\nNow, there’s fear New Mexico may have bought the “Railroad Track to Nowhere.”\n\nMembers of the Legislative Finance Committee (LFC) are alarmed to hear that the Department of Transportation has already spent $5 million on nearly 200 miles of track that has no plans for being used. And on top of that, the track — which was purchased from from BNSF Railway Company between Lamy and the Colorado border — could put the state on the hook for $6 million a year in maintenance because of 10 potential environmental “hotspots” along the line.\n\nThe 200-mile stretch was bought in the hopes of extending the Rail Runner into northern New Mexico some time in the future.\n\nDepartment of Transportation officials spoke to members of the LFC Monday (Dec. 6) and, according to the Albuquerque Journal, the DOT rail manager admitted that “we have just started to do an environmental analysis,” which led LFC members to ask why the analysis wasn’t done before the purchase.\n\nDOT Secretary Gary Girón tried to assure legislators that “until we can resolve those environmental issues, we should not sign (the agreement with BNSF).” But it’s still not clear whether the state can walk away from the deal or get its money back.\n\nI spoke to LFC member Rep. Rhonda King (D-Stanley) about the flap:\n\nIn addition to the potential $6 million a year in maintenance, DOT officials said Monday that the state must pay about $200,000 a year in additional liability insurance for that 200-mile portion of track. Hoo-boy.\n\nHere’s more with Rep. King:\n\nYou can read the entire Albuquerque Journal story here."
