        "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Gov. Susana Martinez wrapped up her first legislative session Saturday, feeling grateful that she was able to make good on at least some of her campaign promises to trim state spending, crack down on criminals and start reforming New Mexico’s education system.\n\nThe Democratic- controlled Legislature handed the Republican executive some key victories in the waning hours of the 60-day session as they worked through a flurry of bills. Consensus was reached on a measure that allows for grades from A to F to be assigned to New Mexico’s public schools based on student performance, as well as on a bill to expand DNA testing to any felony arrestees.\n\nAbsent though was agreement on a package that would have financed $ 240 million in capital improvements, including millions of dollars for NativeAmerican water rights settlements, state highway improvements and projects at colleges and universities.\n\nLegislation that also languished included bills increasing penalties for public officials convicted of corruption, ending social promotion in grade schools and reversing course on the state’s practice of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants.\n\nMartinez vowed to continue pushing the initiatives and blamed their failure on politics in the Senate.\n\nMartinez herself was accused of playing politics during the session, a charge she flatly denied.\n\n“ To fight for the majority of New Mexicans and what they are demanding of their elected officials is not politics. It’s doing the people’s business, and I intend to continue to do so,’ she said, fl anked by a group of school children outside a Santa Fe elementaryschool blocks from the state Capitol.\n\nLawmakers acknowledged that many bills never made it to the House or Senate floor after getting caught in the committee process. They said part of the reason stemmed from a change in the dynamics at the state Capitol with a new conservative governor in control and more Republicans in both chambers.\n\nMartinez wasn’t shy about pressing her agenda through a series of radio advertisements and other pleas to voters that resulted in a fl ood of calls and emails to legislators. Her staff also videotaped legislative proceedings on issues that the administration advocated, such as ending licenses for illegal immigrants.\n\n“ The governor told everybody what she wanted. We knew what the priorities were,’ said Rep. Larry Larranaga, R- Albuquerque. “ We got some of the reforms she wanted … but being a governor who’s on the minority side, the majority always has to test that person to find out what kind of backbone she has.’\n\nDespite the bipartisan denials, Sen. John Arthur Smith, D-Deming, said election- year politics pervaded much of the session.\n\nThe votes of legislators on hot-button issues probably will become campaign fodder during the 2012 election, when all 112 state representatives and senators are up for election.\n\n“ With the filming stuff going on, it’s not discreet. It’s very obvious. That’s\n\nSESSION Page 7\n\nFrom Page 1\n\nprobably the most politics I’ve observed taking place during a session that I’ve been cognizant of,’ said Smith, who was one of two Democrats who backed the governor’s immigrantlicense proposal.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Michael Sanchez, D- Belen, said it was a productive session and that Senate Democrats were more unified because there was a Republican governor.\n\n“ The Democrats, in my opinion, stood up for what they believed in, and I’m really proud of our Democrats,’ he said.\n\nMartinez didn’t back down either, and claimed three large victories: — A locomotive fuel tax deduction targeted to the Union Pacific Railroad, which plans to spend more than $ 400 million for a rail yard project in in Santa Teresa. The project was expected to result in more than 600 permanent jobs.\n\n— School grading based on standardized tests taken by students, the growth of student performance in reading and mathematics, and other factors such as high school graduation rate. Supporters contend the measure will make schools more accountable and help parents understand where their child’s school can make improvements.\n\n— Expansion of “ Katie’s Law,’ named in memory of Kathryn Sepich, a New Mexico State University student who was raped and murdered in 2003. Sepich’s killer was identified more than three years later with DNA evidence after he was convicted of another crime. Under a compromise worked out late Friday, a DNA sample would be taken upon booking and remain unanalyzed until probable cause is established or the defendant fails to appear in court.\n\nSeveral of the governor’s other initiatives failed to be revived in the final hours of the session. Those included proposals to reinstate the death penalty and to provide tax credits for people who donate to nonprofits giving privateschool scholarships.\n\nThe Senate also failed to confirm four of Martinez’scabinet appointments: Hanna Skandera, Public Education Department; Jon Barela, Economic Development Department; John Bemis, Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department; and Retta Ward, Aging and Longterm Services Department. The secretaries can retain their positions despite the lack of confirmation.\n\nMuch of the work done during the session revolved around crafting a blueprint for spending $ 5.4 billion next year on education and governmental programs.\n\nA critical piece of the budget package will save $ 111 million next year by lowering government contributions to public employee pensions while state workers and educators offset that by paying more into their retirement programs. The measure also allows the government to skip making higher contributions to an educational pension program.\n\nThe other key piece capped rebates at $ 50 million a year for film production in New Mexico.\n\nMartinez said she will review the budget proposal line and continue to look for permanent savings.\n\nThe governor also said she planned to veto a tax increase on employers that is aimed at shoring up the state’s unemployment compensation program. The unemployment fund is projected to run out of money by next March without any changes, but Martinez believes the state has time to change the environment in New Mexico to bring in more jobs and reduce the number of people drawing benefits from the fund.\n\n“ The best thing we can do is make sure people get back to work,’ she said."
