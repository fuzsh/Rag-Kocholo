        "text": "Albuquerque Journal covers AFSCME legal win\n\nSunshine Portal Will Lose Names\n\nJudge orders removal of public record\n\nCopyright © 2012 Albuquerque Journal By Dan Boyd Journal Capitol Bureau\n\nAn Albuquerque judge on Monday ordered Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration to remove the names of rankand-file state employees from a state-run online database that includes their salaries, granting a victory to a public employee union that challenged the practice.\n\nA Governor’s Office spokesman said the administration will look into whether the information can be posted on another public website after the ruling by 2nd District Judge Valerie Huling.\n\n“This is public information that is routinely produced and is even available on other websites in New Mexico,” Martinez spokesman Scott Darnell said. “The judge ruled that it cannot be displayed on the Sunshine Portal itself, so we will explore options for making the user-friendly version of this data available on another public website.”\n\nDarnell also said Martinez’s office will push for legislation in 2013 to expand the Sunshine Portal — the state’s online database — to include the names of classified state workers, along with their job titles and salaries. An attempt to pass such legislation failed this year.\n\nSen. Sander Rue, R-Albuquerque, who sponsored the 2010 bill that created the Sunshine Portal, said he will sponsor the legislation to expand the portal.\n\n“It is unfortunate that a judge has rendered a decision to deny the citizens of New Mexico easy access to public information about how their taxpayer dollars are being spent,” Rue said Monday. “This decision is a blow to open and transparent government.”\n\nThe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 18 filed a lawsuit last month challenging the Martinez administration’s decision to post the names and salaries of all state workers — from janitors to elected officials — on the Sunshine Portal.\n\nAlbuquerque attorney Shane Youtz, who represented AFSCME in the case, said the law that created the online portal says that only the job titles, state agency and salary levels of the roughly 18,000 rank-and-file state workers are to be posted on the site — no names.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that such information is available under the state’s Inspection of Public Records Act.\n\n“We don’t assert there’s an absolute right to privacy here,” Youtz said Monday. “It’s publicly available information, but if someone wants to know a classified employee’s name and salary, they have to file a (public records) request. That provides for some sort of accountability.”\n\nIn addition to salary information, the Sunshine Portal offers a sortable database containing information on state spending, revenue and more.\n\nPreviously, the online portal listed both the names and salary information only for certain political appointees, or so-called exempt employees, and elected officials.\n\nMartinez announced in October 2011 that the names and salaries of all workers — including classified employees — would be added to the site, saying at the time that citizens pay the salaries of state workers and should know what they earn.\n\nAFSCME, which represents more than 10,000 public sector employees in New Mexico, sent Martinez a letter in February asking that the names of classified employees be removed. When Martinez’s office did not oblige, the union responded by filing the lawsuit.\n\nAFSCME Interim Executive Director Connie Derr lauded Monday’s ruling, saying, “This is, once again, a demonstration that the governor can’t pick and choose which laws she’s going to abide by.”\n\nMeanwhile, the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government has backed Martinez’s decision to expand the Sunshine Portal, asserting that the names and salaries of state workers is public information.\n\nAlbuquerque Journal North Covers Cayetano Trujillo Story\n\nCorrections Appealing Ruling\n\nWorker Seeks Reinstatement\n\nBy T.S. Last\n\nJournal Staff Writer\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Corrections is appealing an arbitrator’s ruling to reinstate a former state prison employee and union representative involved in an investigation into sexual harassment charges that led to the firing of the Penitentiary of New Mexico warden.\n\nThe department filed the appeal in 1st Judicial District Court on July 2, one month after an arbitrator ruled that Cayetano Trujillo should be reinstated to his position as a warehouse supervisor at the prison south of Santa Fe.\n\nThe department appealed a similar ruling in favor of another former prison employee and union leader, Lee Ortega, in district court in Albuquerque late last year. That appeal is still pending.\n\nTrujillo and Ortega are plaintiffs in a whistle-blower’s lawsuit against the Corrections Department filed in September 2011.\n\nOrtega, who is the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees’ state president for correction workers, was fired in June 2011 for distributing a confidential report to the news media regarding harassment charges against the warden.\n\nTrujillo, who is secretarytreasurer and union steward for AFSCME Local 3422, was fired three months later for giving the same report to an unauthorized person and being untruthful during an investigation.\n\nIn their roles as union representatives, Trujillo and Ortega were involved in an investigation into complaints made by three women against former penitentiary warden Lawrence Jaramillo. The women claimed Jaramillo made inappropriate comments toward them, and Jaramillo was later fired for sexual harassment after failing to pass a polygraph test.\n\nRob Trombley of AFSCME Council 18, who represented both Trujillo and Ortega during arbitration hearings, said both men had unblemished records with the department before they brought their concerns about how the Jaramillo investigation was being handled to Corrections Secretary Lupe Martinez in spring 2011.\n\nOrtega had worked for the department for 16 years, while Trujillo had been employed there for 28 years.\n\n“The state’s employment actions against these two men are, without a doubt, retaliation for their exposing the Department of Corrections’ protection of a serial harasser,” Trombley said.\n\nJim Brewer, general counsel for Corrections, denied Trujillo’s dismissal was retaliatory.\n\n“Trujillo was not treated differently because he was a union official. Trujillo was held to the same standard of conduct (to) which all employees, including bargaining unit employees, are held,” Brewer said in a written statement. “The New Mexico Corrections Department is appealing the arbitrator’s ruling because it is arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law, and not based on substantial evidence.”\n\nAccording to the arbitrator’s report, the department contended that Trujillo was fired for just cause. The department’s investigation determined that Trujillo had given a copy of a confidential document to an unauthorized person — his union representative — and was uncooperative during the investigation. The department maintained that his conduct was “egregious” and appropriate discipline was imposed.\n\nThe arbitrator disagreed, though he indicated Trujillo hadn’t been completely forthcoming during the investigation. The arbitrator, Ira Epstein, wrote in his report that Trujillo was “quibbling” and “overly literal” when he told a department investigator that he did not possess the confidential report when, in fact, it was in his truck. Epstein also found it hard to believe that Trujillo didn’t know the report was confidential since, as a union officer, he had processed grievances related to discipline.\n\nHowever, Epstein ruled that the department took too strict a line by firing Trujillo. He noted that the department had imposed five-day suspensions against officers who had committed offenses he deemed far more serious, including forgery, theft and filing false reports.\n\nThe arbitrator said that a written reprimand would have been the appropriate action.\n\n“While there is evidence of a degree of misconduct, the discipline imposed was extremely excessive in light of the offense,” Epstein wrote.\n\nEpstein’s decision states that Trujillo was fired without just cause, that his termination should be reduced to a written reprimand and his personnel file expunged of his previous suspension and discharge. The department was also directed to “make whole” any wage or benefit loss that resulted from his firing.\n\nWhile the department claims the arbitrator’s ruling was flawed, Trujillo’s counsel doesn’t think so.\n\n“We don’t believe the arbitrator’s decision was in any way arbitrary or capricious,” Trombley said. “The department’s appeal of Epstein’s decision about Trujillo was solely an attempt to hurt him personally for legal communication between him and his authorized union representative. The appeal was solely for the purpose of suppressing dissent and the exercise of free speech necessary for good government.”\n\nIn this Update:\n\nAFSCME Honors The Fallen - National Law Enforcement Week\n\nAFSCME Local 601, Belen Police Department Takes Major Stand for Community\n\nEspanola City Council and Taos County Commission Pass Proclamations Honoring Law Enforcement and Public Safety\n\n[WATCH!] AFSCME Law Enforcement Documentary on the true spirit of law enforcement\n\nNational Law Enforcement Week: Honoring Heroes Who’ve Sacrificed\n\nIn 2016, 143 officers were killed; the names of more than 20,000 officers are engraved on the wall of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington D.C.\n\nIn 1963, President John F.

A hearing on the matter was held on March 21 by Public Employee Labor Relations Board Hearing Officer Tom Griego. Based on the evidence presented, the hearing officer ruled that the officers job description did not make them \"managers\" or \"supervisors\", as defined by the state Public Employee Bargaining Act; and therefore, the officers are eligible to organize.\n\nElection ballots have been mailed to each eligible officer by the PELRB and must be returned (postmarked) to the PELRB by May 22, 2017.

The DOC agreed to abide by the vote of the membership.\n\nAFSCME Council 18 and the leadership of the facilities held meetings in April and May at the facilities to discuss the pros and cons of the 12 hour shift, with the membership subsequently voting the issue up or down.

The decision affirms previous arbitration awards in the unions’ favor which require the state to issue back pay checks to employees in an unknown amount, but which is estimated to be in the $5 - $10 million range.\n\nThe dispute arose when the state refused to pay wage increases agreed to by the parties. The unions’ previous contracts with the state required a wage increase for fiscal year 2009. Claiming that the Legislature did not appropriate the necessary money to fund those wage increases, the state paid its union employees a smaller wage increase than what was called for in the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe unions filed grievances and arbitrated the state’s decision. Arbitrators for AFSCME and CWA separately ruled that the Legislature did appropriate sufficient funds to pay the agreed upon wage increases and ordered the state to retroactively increase the wage rates and back pay all union employees working for the state. The state appealed these decisions in state District Court but lost again. The state appealed again, this time arguing its case before the New Mexico Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals issued its decision Aug. 8 affirming the arbitrators’ awards.\n\nThe state of New Mexico has the option to seek review by the New Mexico Supreme Court.

Metropolitan Detention Center\n\nThanks for reading, \"Solidarity is how we win!\"\n\nAfter an eight-year struggle, AFSCME has finally made the State follow the collective bargaining agreement. Article 21, Section 5 of the agreement between AFSCME Council 18 and the State of New Mexico provides that \"an employee who is assigned to shift work in a twenty-four hour facility and who does not utilize sick leave for a calendar quarter shall receive credit for eight hours of administrative leave....\"\n\n“The State had interpreted that section only to apply to employees in those facilities who are part of a rotating shift to allow 24-hour coverage,” said Connie Derr, AFSCME Council 18 Executive Director,“whereas AFSCME has always believed that it meant what it says: anyone who works a shift at a 24-hour facility is entitled to the benefit.”\n\nAFSCME arbitrated that case on behalf of CO Specialists at the Springer Correctional Center, and won an award in March of 2009. Rather than accept the arbitration award, the State Personnel Office issued regulations in an attempt to undo the arbitrator’s final and binding interpretation of the contract. AFSCME filed suit alleging that the State unconstitutionally impaired the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nHere is the original step one grievance filed in 2008\n\nAfter numerous twists and turns, AFSCME has now resolved the dispute with the State. As a result, all current employees who work at 24-hour facilities are entitled to the benefit. Moreover, those employees who earned the leave from March 31, 2010 (the date on which the State tried to undo the arbitration award by issuing the regulation) to October 9, 2014 (the date on which, pursuant to a court order in the case, the State started awarding the benefit required by the CBA) will have their leave accounts credited accordingly.\n\nThe State will be sending notification to the more than 2,500 affected bargaining unit employees within the next few weeks.\n\nClick and complete a safe & secure online membership application using our online system: #UNION-MEMBERS-LIFT-NEW-MEXICO!\n\nOur continuing mission:\n\nTo organize, inspire, and empower workers\n\nto take action at work and in their communities\n\npromote democracy and hold government accountable.\n\nUNITED, we fight for dignity and respect\n\nto achieve social and economic justice for ALL!\n\nOnly AFSCME members have a voice and a vote in union business matters, are able to play a pivotal role as a local leader, steward. and are eligible for member-only benefits.\n\nIn Solidarity!\n\nSee another action call below: STOP Privatization of public sector jobs.\n\nPUBLIC SAFETY UPDATES\n\nMeanwhile, there's lots of other action.

A result, Corrections Officers are working maximum level (72) hours of mandatory overtime, weekly, at some facilities. This work schedule prevents officers from having adequate time for recovery, self care, or their families.\n\nResulting fatigue, stress, and break-down of well-being, commonly referred to as “corrections fatigue” is a major factor increasing the dangers of accidents or incidents at work.\n\nNM Corrections Officer pay remains uncompetitive and below the median income level for corrections officers (nationally and regionally). Low pay is a major factor preventing the department from recruiting and retaining men and women into the career. The domino effects created by heavy workloads and high vacancies are undermining the department’s mission.\n\nThrough its Labor Management Committee, the New Mexico Corrections Department and AFSCME have recognize all these life and death realities and agreed that addressing them need to be an urgent priority.\n\nAFSCME strongly calls upon Governor Martinez, her administration, and the NM Legislature to tackle the issue of corrections fatigue by working with the union, and one another to develop and implement concrete strategies and solutions addressing the crisis.\n\nSave New Mexico Corrections by Miles Dylan Conway\n\nAFSCME Statement Regarding Taos County \"Runaway Shop\" / PPC 120-12 before the PELRB\n\nDedicated union employees working for Emergency Medical Services, Adult and Juvenile Detention Facilities in Taos County are experiencing what we refer to in the labor movement as a \"runaway shop\". A runaway shop is characterized as a workplace where quality of management has been corrupted and managers have fallen into a cycle where unwarranted discipline is dispensed rampantly; where management engages in systematic retaliation against employees who are perceived as questioning compromised management style.\n\nOften, at times like these, management points the finger at the workers' union for playing a role in making things worse. AFSCME Council 18 condemns any assertion along these lines in the strongest terms possible. Local leaders have filed a number of grievances in an attempt to mitigate a hostile work environment and protect employees' rights at EMS, JDC and ADC. In the midst of a runaway shop, union leaders are compelled to use EVERY tool at their disposal to protect employees rights, livelihood and quite frankly, their safety.\n\nOutspoken employees are being targeted by management and as a result, employees have closed ranks standing in support of these leaders. In one especially egregious attack by management, where the deepest level of an employee's character was brought into question, an overwhelming majority of the employees in that division spoke up in support of their fellow worker.\n\nTaos News has reported on the rash of top level county government firings that have occurred over the past months. What does not make the news are the front line employees who have also been fired, quit, or transferred.\n\nThe PPC which AFSCME Council 18 filed specifically addresses the County's move ignoring shift bidding practices protected by collective bargaining agreements. Without these rules being adhered to, employees are seeing schedules and work assignments changed arbitrarily without sufficient notice or in compliance with contract language. Management has used the opportunity to avoid paying overtime, splitting shifts, and reassign employees to far flung work areas as a form of punishment.\n\nAFSCME Council 18 is responding due to great concern that unprofessional alliances between elected leaders and county employees have set in motion the abuse of civic responsibility, with front line employees, Taos County citizens, and public safety bearing the brunt of the consequences.\n\nCommunity Demands Sheriff Dan Houston Apologize to Women & Resign\n\nTue, Oct-16-2012\n\nNew Mexican women stand in solidarity and demand the resignation of Sheriff Houston for his disparaging remarks and illegal actions against women\n\nAFSCME Members working under Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston have a list of grievances a mile long. Well aware of a disdain for the labor movement, AFSCME members mount active resistance to his clandestine efforts to diminish worker’s’ rights and voices on the job. It was not a surprise when Albuquerque Journal broke a story October 11, detailing Houston’s disparaging remarks directed at women working in his department.\n\nHouston admits calling women working for him. \"A couple of whores.\" He told the Albuquerque Journal that he called another Hispanic woman a \"fat slob,\" said a breast cancer victim couldn't have had cancer because \"her breasts are too small,\" and another woman couldn't have been sexually harassed because she's too plain. When a Hispanic female employee blew the whistle, he fired her.\n\nBernalillo County Court Specialists filed a discrimination lawsuit againsty the Sheriff and department which has been transferred to Federal Magistrate Court. Pending sexual harrasment charges against Houston’s chief deputy, EEOC charges from early 2012, and another Houston top Leutenant on a “performance improvement plan” for stalking allegations, paint a clear picture that Houston’s regime is in need of serious overhaul.\n\nOn Friday, October 12th a group of concerned women and community members held a press conference outside of the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office and demanded the resignation of Sheriff Dan Houston. This group not only aimed to hold Sheriff Houston accountable for the remarks he has made against women, but delivered letters from community members demanding his resignation. Speakers included Dr. Martha Burk, former Chair of the National Council of Women's Organizations who led the effort to open the Augusta National Golf Club to women, and Micaela Cadena of Young Women United.\n\nCommunity members displayed a three-foot poster of Sheriff Dan Houston and the remarks he made against women and held smaller posters and signs calling for his resignation.\n\n\"In New Mexico, we will not stand for this type of sexist and bigoted behavior by anyone, let alone our elected officials,\" said Marsha Garcia, Hispano Media Director with ProgressNow New Mexico. \"Not only were the comments and actions made by Sheriff Dan Houston completely unacceptable, but he did this against the very people he was elected to serve and protect. We will not allow this behavior to go on one more day. We demand the resignation of Sheriff Dan Houston, Bernalillo County deserves better!\"\n\nConsidering the laundry list of grievances on Sheriff Houston’s watch, AFSCME members agree that a change in leadership in Bernalillo County Public Safety is right on target.\n\nBackground: http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2012/10/11/news/sheriff-sued-over-firing.html and http://www.progressnownm.org/blog/2012/10/a-couple-of-whores.html\n\nCongressman Lujan Attends Dedication of AFSCME Hall to Speaker Ben Lujan and Carmen Lujan\n\nFri, Sep-28-2012\n\n\"Those are the lessons we learn from labor, when there's someone in need, we step forward.\" Congressman Lujan shared these words while accepting an award on behalf of his father, Speaker Lujan, for his lifetime of work fighting for working people.\n\nThe American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Council 18 honored long time Speaker of the House Ben Lujan and his highly respected wife, Carmen Lujan in a dedication ceremony on Saturday, Sept 22nd. AFSCME’s main meeting hall at 1202 Pennsylvania NE, Albuquerque was be dedicated with a plaque and named “Lujan Union Hall” after the venerable couple.\n\nThe ceremony will ran from 10:00 a.m. until 10:45 a.m., followed by the Lujan family and union members canvassing and phone-banking on behalf of candidates who want to carry on the Speaker's work as he retires from the legislature.\n\nThe Speaker and Mrs. Lujan’s son, Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, attended to represent the family. AFSCME members and several NM State Representatives paid tribute with personal stories of how the Speaker has made a real, tangible difference in union members' lives.\n\nSpeaker and Carmen Lujan and have long been revered as champions for working families throughout New Mexico, and are held in high esteem by AFSCME and the state’s labor movement. Speaker Lujan himself was a union iron worker at the Los Alamos Laboratory early in his career.\n\n“He not only believes in the missions that union workers--and all workers--carry out every day, but he believes deeply in giving those workers a path to America's great middle class,” said Carter Bundy, political and legislative director for AFSCME in New Mexico.\n\nSpeaker Lujan announced his three year fight against lung cancer in January at the start of the Legislative session and did not run for reelection. He believes his cancer is a direct result of years of exposure to asbestos while working at the lab.\n\nThe Speakers legacy includes work strengthening laws protecting building trades, manufacturing, educational, and public sector employees. “His battles have been our battles, and our battles have been his battles. He hasn't just been a political leader, he has been a leader in the movement for basic human rights, civil rights, and social and economic justice,” concluded Bundy.\n\nABQ Journal Publishes AFSCME Op-Ed by Secretary-Treasurer Saunders\n\nEconomic Justice Key Part of Dream\n\nTue, Jan-17-2012\n\nBy Lee A. Saunders / Secretary-Treasurer, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO on Mon, Jan 16, 2012\n\nThousands of New Mexicans will join their fellow citizens across America today in honoring Martin Luther King Jr., who still stands as our greatest symbol of progress, and whose courage transformed our nation. While New Mexico and the rest of the country claw out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, Dr. King’s legacy has the power to inspire a new generation to fight for justice and ensure New Mexico and the rest of the country thrive and grow.\n\nOn what would have been Dr. King’s 83rd birthday, his words continue to ring true for America and many here in New Mexico. During the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, he spoke of Americans living “in a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.”\n\nThat same problem remains today. Middle- and lower-income Americans have been hit especially hard in the downturn, and thousand of working families, including many here in New Mexico, continue to lose their homes because of high unemployment rates.\n\nAs New Mexicans turn out for parades or events in Albuquerque, Las Cruces and Santa Fe, they will remember a leader who not only championed civil rights but also economic justice. Both were essential parts of his Dream for America. That is why he fought so strongly for the right of American workers to organize and bargain collectively. He was a longtime supporter of unions and understood the role of organized labor in creating the middle class. As he said in a 1961 speech to the delegates at the AFL-CIO Convention: “Our needs are identical with labor’s needs.”\n\nAFSCME, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, had an especially close bond with Dr. King. On three occasions in 1968 he traveled to Memphis to stand with the sanitation workers of AFSCME Local 1733 – 1,300 men who went on strike to secure their right to collective bargaining. They were public employees earning poverty wages, working long days in backbreaking labor. When the workers went on strike they were risking everything. But the signs they carried, “I AM A MAN,” made it clear: Their action was about much more than wages. It was also about dignity.\n\nDr. King understood. “All labor has dignity,” he told the AFSCME members in Memphis. “You are reminding the nation that it is a crime for people to live in this rich nation and receive starvation wages.” Dr. King recognized that civil rights and workers’ rights are intertwined. If workers do not have a voice in the workplace or the right to stand up for themselves to negotiate at the bargaining table, then the voices of some people – those with wealth and power – matter more than others.\n\nDr. King would be gratified today that New Mexicans and their fellow citizens share his commitment to justice. Moreover, they are mobilizing in numbers that have been rarely seen since the 1960s. Throughout the country we see the beginnings of a social justice movement that will reinvigorate and revive Dr. King’s hope for a community where all Americans work together for the common good.\n\nThis movement has brought together working families, civil rights organizations, church groups, students, environmentalists, the LGBT community and others to counter the efforts of those who have tried to turn back the clock to a time when only the powerful had a voice and a future. As we commemorate Dr. King on his birthday, we need to remember the challenge he posed to all of us: to create a nation that provides every citizen with the opportunity to stand with dignity. We need to be involved in this struggle and to do everything in our power to revive the dream for which Dr. King gave his life.\n\nLee A. Saunders is the secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, a labor union that represents 1.6 million workers across the United States, including 13,000 public employees and health care workers in New Mexico.\n\nLots of News Coverage for Our Recent Clean Water Jobs Coalition Press Conference!\n\nTue, Dec-13-2011\n\nCoalition Pushes NM Lawmakers To Support Jobs Act -- KOAT\n\nhttp://www.koat.com/news/29980477/detail.html\n\nCoalition Pushing for N.M.

The Fraternal Order of Police and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have similar perspectives.\n\n“We haven’t gotten to the major issues yet,” David Heshley, executive director of the FOP’s state lodge, tells SFR. “I’m not expecting anything to get done [this month], and we’ve been going since July.”\n\nEvery three years, each union collectively bargains for new contracts with the state. Altogether, they represent just over 10,000 employees, although CWA political coordinator Miles Conway says past contracts have affected as many as 26,000 state employees.\n\nThe three unions’ current contracts expire Dec. 31, although an “evergreen” rule allows them to extend beyond the expiration date while negotiations continue.\n\nThis time, though, the state’s proposals are more far-reaching, prompting lengthy negotiations. They include eliminating requirements for employee breaks, ending employees’ abilities to use sick time to care for family members and cutting the unions’ power to contest negative performance evaluations, among others.\n\nOne proposal calls for eliminating all contract rules that overlap with State Personnel Office rules, Jakob Schiller, an AFSCME spokesman, says. Employee sick time accrual rates, for example, are spelled out both in the current AFSCME contract and Personnel Office rules.\n\nSchiller argues that keeping Personnel Office rules in union-negotiated contracts serves a purpose: They bind the state to enforcing them. He fears that the Personnel Office could change its own rules at any point, putting employee benefits at the agency’s mercy.\n\nSchiller also laments the state’s proposal to strike the words “fairness” and “equitable” from the new contract.\n\n“They’re arguing those are suggestive terms,” he tells SFR. “We’re saying, ‘Who wouldn’t want “fair” and “equitable” in any contract?’”\n\nGould blames a state strategy to “start from scratch,” rather than build off of current contracts.\n\n“We were quite shocked,” Gould tells SFR. “The proposal from the state eliminated half of the contract.”\n\nBut Gene Moser, director of the State Personnel Office, says building completely off of past contracts is unfair to taxpayers because the state is subject to giving union employees perks that nonunion employees don’t have. Some union employees, he says, are paid to do union work on the state’s dime.\n\nThe state built off of prior contracts during the last two negotiations, held under former Gov. Bill Richardson in 2006 and 2009. In neither case did the state request givebacks (cuts from previously won benefits). Robert Tinnin, an Albuquerque lawyer who consulted with the state during both contract negotiations, says the decision not to ask for givebacks was a “huge concession to the unions.”\n\nThough Gould says her union wasn’t expecting anything different this time around, the sluggish economy may be affecting the state’s proposals.\n\n“It’s probably partly because of the economic situation, and everyone is feeling that impact,” Heshley says.\n\nMiles Conway, a political coordinator for CWA, suggests a more sinister motive coming from Management Associates, the Albuquerque firm hired by the state to help negotiate the new contracts.\n\n“They are the go-to union-busting firm in New Mexico,” Conway says.\n\nAlthough Gould says previous, separate negotiations she undertook with Management Associates went well, Schiller says current discussions over four Albuquerque city contracts involving AFSCME and Management Associates are officially in impasse. That means both sides must weigh in on a randomly chosen arbitrator, who in turn picks one side’s proposal over the other.\n\nThe state’s contract with Management Associates, which Moser says it won through a standard bidding process, is worth up to $250,000 over fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The firm, which works jointly with SPO, charges the state $125 an hour for professional labor services and $150 an hour for legal services, public money that comes from gross receipts taxes.\n\nThe firm’s lawyers refused to discuss the current negotiations with SFR.\n\nMoser estimates his side is meeting with the three unions at least three times a month. Hiring a private contractor to help with negotiations—a point of contention from the union side—is nothing new, he says, dismissing any criticism as the unions “blowing smoke.”\n\nBefore this year, the state contracted with Tinnin’s law firm to negotiate union contracts, although he didn’t play a direct role in negotiations for the previous two contracts.\n\n“I was aware of what was going on,” Tinnin says about the previous two negotiations. “I was consulted, but was not at the table.”\n\nTinnin’s behind-the-scenes role cemented as the relationship between the unions and the state “matured,” he says. Before, Gov. Gary Johnson refused to renew the collective bargaining law, which had expired in 1999. In 2003, Richardson and the state Legislature reaffirmed it.\n\nNow, the unions are accusing Martinez of attempting to take away as much power as possible from the unions, albeit in more subtle ways than the governors of Wisconsin and Ohio.\n\n“Martinez doesn’t control the [state] Senate or the House, so it’s a long shot for her to strip collective bargaining legislatively,” Conway says. “But we do bargain with the executive branch.”\n\nAs protests over collective bargaining rights exploded in Wisconsin in February, Martinez fired every member of the state Public Employee Labor Relations Board, to the detriment of local unions. In April, the state Supreme Court found her firing of two board members unconstitutional.\n\nThis summer, CWA Local 7076 President Michelle Lewis was laid off from her position in the Public Education Department. (She was later offered another department job at lower pay.) By fall, Expo New Mexico had cut Maxine Velasquez, the secretary-treasurer of New Mexico Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. Martinez’ office has stated that the cuts had nothing to do with employees’ roles in organized labor.\n\nAllthough previous negotiations took less time—roughly three to six months—Moser says the current discussions are still far from impasse. In the meantime, though, talks are slow going.\n\n“Each side feels they’re correct in their positions,” Moser says. “It’s tedious right now.”\n\nCouncil 18 Speaks Out Against Gov's Decision to Cut Flex Time\n\nAFSCME Council 18 is speaking out against Governor Martinez's vindictive decision to cut flex time for state employees. Both the Albuquerque Journal and Channel 13 covered the story.\n\nPasted below is the Journal story and a link to the story on their website.\n\nGov. Tells Agencies To Halt Flex Schedules\n\nBy Dan Boyd / Journal Staff Writer on Thu, Oct 27, 2011\n\nhttp://www.abqjournal.com/main/2011/10/27/news/gov-tells-agencies-to-hal...\n\nSANTA FE – It’s back to the old “8 to 5″ for more state workers.\n\nTwo more New Mexico state agencies have done away with alternative work schedules for employees, prompted by Gov. Susana Martinez’s directive to boost government efficiency.\n\nThe Martinez administration has questioned whether the alternative, “flex” schedules compromise service to taxpayers and customers.\n\nGreg Blair, a spokesman for the first-term Republican governor, said Martinez has directed cabinet secretaries to make their own decisions about what’s the most effective and efficient work schedules for their agencies.\n\n“The governor believes each agency must be accessible to the people they serve, and having adequate staffing in the office during normal business hours is one way to ensure that New Mexicans are able to receive the services that their tax dollars fund,” Blair said.\n\nPublic employee unions are challenging the move away from flex-time schedules, claiming there is no evidence a stricter policy on employee schedules will save the state money.\n\n“It’s a vindictive, anti-worker move on (the governor’s) part,” said Carter Bundy, the New Mexico political director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. “The state will lose workers because of this policy.”\n\nThe Children, Youth and Families Department rescinded alternative work schedules for most employees on Oct. 15, meaning employees have to work prescribed shifts – not four 10-hour days or schedules that otherwise deviate from normal work hours.\n\nThe change won’t take effect for the agency’s juvenile probation officers until Saturday, and a department spokesman said agency officials are considering allowing certain employees to keep their current schedules, depending on client needs.\n\nAbout 200 of the agency’s 2,000 employees have submitted requests to continue working flex schedules, according to the department.\n\nCYFD Secretary Yolanda Deines said all schedules will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n“We need to make sure the needs of CYFD clients are a priority and that we are operating as efficiently as possible,” Deines said in a statement. “We want to accommodate staff needs and be flexible when possible, but we must place the needs of CYFD clients first and be accountable to New Mexico taxpayers.”\n\nHowever, one affected CYFD employee said no warning was given prior to the flex time announcement and predicted the move would ultimately hurt productivity.\n\nFlex schedules allow employees to work modified shifts – such as coming into work one hour early in order to leave early – so they can attend to family obligations or for other reasons.\n\nIn addition to CYFD, the Department of Health is also rescinding flex schedules for an unspecified number of employees, Blair said.\n\nThat comes after the Taxation and Revenue Department and the Regulation and Licensing Department made similar policy changes earlier this year.\n\nThe state’s current collective bargaining contract allows union employees to apply for alternative schedules. State government cannot “unreasonably” deny or rescind such a schedule, according to the contract.\n\n“There is no reason someone shouldn’t be able to drop off their kids and come to work 15 minutes early and then leave work 15 minutes early to pick them up,” Bundy said.\n\nWhile some state workers have been working alternative schedules for years, the changes enacted by the Martinez administration effectively run contrary to a policy implemented by first-term Republican governor’s predecessor, Democrat Bill Richardson.\n\nThree years ago, Richardson directed the State Personnel Office to look into four-day work weeks featuring extended hours in an effort to cut down on state vehicle use and rush-hour congestion on state roadways.\n\n— This article appeared on page A1 of the Albuquerque Journal\n\nFri, Oct-14-2011\n\nLocations for Saturday's statewide protests\n\nThese rallies areimportant to show politicians and the world that many of us understand that our problems have been created by Wall Street gambling and a lack of regulation, not by the hard working families of New Mexico and America--who are the ones suffering the most right now. If you're sick of the giant multinational corporate ownership of politics, this is just the start of how we fight back.\n\nThese protests against politicians and corporations who put millionaires and billionaires above the needs of 99% of America (teachers, construction workers, police officers, the middle class, students, seniors, anyone with a job not on Wall Street, the unemployed) are for all of us, regardless of party, age, or any other category that is used to divide us.\n\nBe heard on Saturday, October 15, all over New Mexico.\n\nSanta Fe: Come to the Roundhouse, starting at 10 a.m. on Saturday, October 15. It will go all day, so come by whenever you can, and if you can bring water, snacks, soda, or other food, please do!\n\nAlbuquerque: In Albuquerque, protesters will meet from noon until 2 p.m. at the Nob Hill Wells Fargo on the SW corner of Central and Richmond SE.\n\nLas Cruces: Possibly 2 events planned, one possible at Aggie tailgate, other at banks, please visit the Occupy Las Cruces facebook site for details.\n\nOther locations: please visit Occupy New Mexico's facebook page for details, or see if your town has its own page.\n\nSun, Oct-2-2011\n\nGov’s Team Demands End to 25 Years of Gains for State Employees!\n\nDon’t Let This Happen to Your Public Workers.\n\nIn the first bargaining sessions with the State, its negotiators told New Mexico’s public employee unions— the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), and the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP)—to rip up all but a couple of the pages in their contracts.\n\nState workers were told that their rights and protections don’t need to be in writing anymore.\n\nWe Are:\n\n• Corrections Officers • Disability Workers\n\n• Healthcare Workers • Personal Homecare Aids\n\n• Highway Workers • Construction Laborers\n\n• Law Enforcement Officers • Social Workers\n\n• Income Support Workers • Building Inspectors\n\n• Probation and Parole Officers • Protective Services\n\nAnd hundreds of other positions across the state.\n\nWe provide quality services that New Mexico citizens deserve. Don’t let the State of New Mexico step on workers’ rights!\n\nCall Gov. Susana Martinez Today and Tell Her To “Negotiate a Fair Contract With State Workers!”\n\nGov. Martinez’s Office: 505-476-2200\n\nFri, Sep-16-2011\n\nPOLITiCAL UPDATE\n\nLEGISLATIVE SPECIAL SESSION\n\nIt's been a very busy September already: AFSCME is fighting for jobs at the Roundhouse, supporting an in-state preference bill that Governor Martinez vetoed last year. We need to give New Mexicans a chance to work on New Mexico projects, and all our neighboring states give their own companies and workers an in-state preference. Fortunately, it looks like it may get signed if it can get passed, but distractions such as drivers' licenses and other issues may get in the way. We're lobbying to ensure that politics stays out of what should be an easy win for New Mexico workers.\n\nLikewise, we're supporting capital outlay, which was also killed by Governor Martinez and some of her allies who filibustered in the Senate last year. This means thousands of New Mexico jobs, which helps state and local budgets. The more the private sector can get to work, including our sisters and brothers in the building trades, the better off public employees are.\n\nThe biggest fight we have at the Roundhouse is Governor Martinez' attempt to steal $130 million from reserves and the general fund to protect a business tax break on unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is a payroll-based fund. Not only did Governor Martinez cut unemployment benefits last year, but she tried to line-item veto the necessary payroll contributions to keep the fund solvent.\n\nLegislators took her to court, but while we wait for a decision, the governor is now trying to raid money that is meant to be used for basic public programs like K-12 education, universities, public safety, and roads, and to give us a cushion in case revenues don't rebound. On top of that, the governor's movida might possibly extend public employee paycuts of 1.75% for yet another year. This is an added insult on top of her attempts in negotiations to strip state employees of almost every gain we've made over the last 20 years (she even wants to prohibit parents using sick leave to care for a sick child--unbelievable, but true). Governor Martinez' raid on reserves and the general fund is fiscally irresponsible, reckless, and an attack on state workers, educational employees, and basic state services that citizens need.\n\nCall Governor Martinez' office and ask her to fund unemployment thorugh payroll, not from reserves and the general fund. Her number is 505-476-2200.\n\nALBUQUERQUE ELECTIONS\n\nThe city council elections are less than a month away. The Central Labor Council, AFSCME, and other unions have endorsed Bill Tallman in district 4. We have a real chance to win this seat, but not unless we get to work soon. We have to get a pro-worker voice in that seat, or our Albuquerque members will continue to take pay cuts and watch as politicians' pet projects get funded instead of core city services.\n\nWe will be holding union member-to-member walks out of the AFSCME hall starting this Saturday, the dates are (but not limited to)\n\nSaturday September 17, 10am\n\nSaturday September 24, 10am\n\nSaturday October 1, 10am\n\nSunday October 2, 3pm\n\nWe will have free food and drink and $30 gas stipend for all AFSCME members and immediate family members over the age of 16. For more information, please call Council 18 Political Coordinator Josh Anderson at 505-350-2200.\n\nPlease spread the word. See you this Saturday!\n\nSANTA FE RALLY\n\nFed up with the governor attacking state employees and raiding state funds for political gain? Come to our workers' \"Where are the Jobs, Susana\" rally at 1 p.m. on Saturday, September 17 on the East side of the Roundhouse. The more workers and friends we have, the more the rest of the state will realize how wrong the governor's priorities are.\n\nJune 28, 2011\n\nHelp the Los Alamos Fire Victims!\n\nThe people in these communities have had to evacuate and move to shelters.The Northern New Mexico Central Labor Council is joining with labor and community organizations to ask the community of greater Santa Fe to assist our neighbors in SSanta Fe, Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Taos, San Miguel, Mora, and Colfax Counties!\n\nYou can send food and other items in the list below to:\n\nThe Food Depot\n\n122 Slier Road\n\nSanta Fe, NM\n\n(505) 471-1633\n\nBottled water\n\nHandheld snacks such as granola, breakfast bars, trail mix, nuts, dried fruit, etc.\n\nProtein items such as peanut butter, beef jerky, etc.\n\nMeal supplies such as dried beans, rice, pasta, etc.\n\nPersonal care items such as deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, shampoo, hand wipes, etc.\n\nPaper products such as toilet tissue, napkins, cups, plates, towels, plastic cutlery, etc.\n\nPlease DO NOT SEND clothing or household items.\n\nLabor unions and other socially active organizations may also donate money to help purchase some of these items.\n\nItems should be delivered on Tuesday afternoons (1:00 PM to 4:00 PM), on Wednesday mornings (9:00 AM to 12:00 Noon) , Wednesday afternoons (1:00 PM to 4:00 PM), and Thursday, if necessary.\n\nThanks To All Who Can Lend A Hand.\n\nJune 27, 2011\n\nAFSCME Members Stand in Solidarity with Nurses at St. Vincent\n\nAFSCME members from across New Mexico joined their brothers and sisters at CHRISTUS St. Vincent Regional Medical Center during a rally on June 24th in Santa Fe.\n\nCSV and the nurses are currently in contract negotiations and CSV is proposing to get rid of basic safety enforcement standards, even though our nurses our so committed to safety that they're willing to give up millions of dollars in the next contract to ensure that staffing levels are safe. There are a number of other issues where CSV is, frankly, putting the entire Northern New Mexico community at risk:\n\nCSV continues to understaff the ER (ER waits are up to 24 hours long not because of a shortage of beds, but because CSV is too cheap to staff the ER properly), but magically they were able to raise CEO pay from $257,872 to over HALF a MILLION DOLLARS. A year. For one guy.\n\nThey won't staff at safe levels, but to avoid hiring New Mexico union nurses, they hire traveling nurses from Texas and California at twice the price. All while New Mexicans are begging for jobs."
