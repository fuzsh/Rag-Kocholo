DAD. i i a BY RACHEL WEINER THE WASHINGTON POST A longtime fraudster who hired prostitutes to steal identities was sentenced to 14 years in prison Friday. Michael Oginni stole more than $650,000 over two years, spending the money on call girls, high-end appli- ances for his Rockville, Maryland, home and tuition for his four children at exclusive private schools, according to prosecutors .\n\nWhen he was arrested at a supermarket in Ohio last July, court papers say, Oginni was carrying 54 fake credit cards, 35 debit cards, several phones and a laptop filled with hacking and counterfeiting software under the filename Big Fraud Package.zip.‚Äù During his sentencing hearing Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Oginni said he had not appreciated the human cost of his crimes after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft. not a he said. not an evil But prosecutor Laura Fong called him a who hired vulnerable people to do his dirty work and beat them when they failed to comply. A native of Nigeria, Oginni came to the United States in 2007 after getting out of prison in the United King- dom for student-loan fraud. In the Washington area, according to court filings, he recruited a band of pros- titutes and heroin addicts to buy gift cards at conve- nience stores, wash the markings off with acetone and encode them with stolen credit card information .\n\nFrom a laptop at a Rockville Starbucks, Oginni would instruct his co-conspirators on what to wear and say when they used the cards, Fong said. When credit card companies began using chips to prevent this kind of fraud, Oginni turned to opening new credit accounts in names. He scouted online records for people with high credit scores and substantial wealth, then ordered counterfeit licenses with their information but his photos. 14-year sentence for longtime fraudster Man hired prostitutes to steal identities ASSOCIATED PRESS WACO, Texas A New Jersey man who died from a rare amoeba was likely exposed to it during his visit to a Texas water resort last month, health officials said Friday. The Waco-McLennan County Public Health District said testing done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found evidence of Naegleria fowleri a rare but deadly amoeba that can cause a brain infection at one of the four attractions at the BSR Cable Park and Surf Resort in Waco, and conditions favorable for its growth at the other three .\n\nHealth officials said the amoeba was found at the attraction a natural body of water, but remain open because risk of exposure is considered the same as at any natural body of water. But officials added that the other three attractions reopen until health and safety are addressed. Fabrizio Stabile 29, died Sept. 21 after contracting the deadly amoeba. People are usually infected when contaminated water enters the body through the nose, according to the CDC .\n\nThe CDC reports the amoeba is usually found in warm freshwater, such as lakes, rivers or hot springs. The New Jersey Department of Health said the man had visited the park on Sept. 8. Symptoms generally start about five days after infection, with death occur- ring about five days later, according to the CDC. The infection can start out with a headache, fever and nausea, and worsen into a stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures .\n\nThe CDC said only four of the 143 people known to have been infected in the U.S. between 1962 and 2017 have survived. Officials: Man got amoeba at Texas park BY ROBERT MOORE AND MICHELLE YE HEE LEE THE WASHINGTON POST The campaign of Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto on Friday said it had raised $38.1 million in the past three months, bringing his total to nearly $62 million an enormous haul that makes him one of the most successful fundraisers in American politics. The three-term congressman far outstripped Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz, who reported rais- ing $12 million over the past three months, bringing his total for 2017 and 2018 to about $28 million .\n\nNevertheless, Cruz maintains a lead over in recent polls, with a new Quinnipiac University poll finding Cruz ahead by nine percent- age points. The cascade of cash propelled past some of the biggest fundraisers on the national level, includ- ing then-Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, who broke records when she raised nearly $52 million for her 2006 reelection. The money reportedly raised from July through September shattered the previous record for a Senate candidate set by New York Republican Rick Lazio, who raised $22 million in one quarter during his unsuccessful 2000 run against Clinton, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. nearly $62 million haul exceeds the amounts raised by 2016 presidential candidates such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen .\n\nMarco Rubio of Florida, then-New Jersey Gov.

When two roof- ing workers beat a young gay man to death in Wyoming in 1998, the grue- some crime quickly reverberated around the U.S .\n\nand turned the sandy- haired college student into a powerful symbol of the quest for acceptance and equal rights. But two decades after Matthew Shepard was bludgeoned, tied to a rail fence and left to die on the cold high prairie, the emotions stirred up by his slaying linger in Wyoming, which still struggles with its tarnished identity and resists changes sought by the LGBTQ community. nowhere near said Sara Burlingame, executive director of the Cheyenne-based LGBTQ advo- cacy group Wyoming Equality. The work today the same thing that was there 20 years As recently as Tuesday, days before the anniversary of death, about 200 people attended a forum in Laramie questioning the prevailing view that he was murdered because of his sexual orientation. Wyoming Equality protested by holding a dance at a civic center down the street, using the slogan They Go Low We Go The acrimony over lega- cy runs high here, just as it did when anti-gay and gay-rights protesters squared off at his funeral in Casper .\n\npeople find out from Laramie, they still zero in on this hate said Trudy McCrak- en, who spoke at the forum and was mayor at the time of the slaying. Wyoming remains defen- about the idea that Shepard was targeted because he was gay, Burlin- game said. Known as the Equality State, Wyo- ming got its nickname for being the first to let women vote. Today it has fewer women in its Legislature than any other state and remains hesitant to adopt policies to counter anti-gay bias and violence. It is among just five states along with Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina that have not passed laws focused on crimes moti- vated by the identity, such as their sexual orientation .\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed a federal hate crime prevention act named after Shepard in 2009, a law that mother, Judy Shepard, said has been helpful. Laramie did not pass an ordinance barring discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identi- ty until 2015. The University of Wyo- ming created its diversity office only last year. Attorneys for Wyoming in 2014 argued in defense of the defi- nition of marriage as only between a man and a woman, a case later ren- dered moot by higher court rulings.
