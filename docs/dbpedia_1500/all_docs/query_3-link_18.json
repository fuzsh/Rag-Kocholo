        "text": "James “Jim” P. White, age 78, died peacefully in his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Friday, January 15, 2021.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Jennifer White, Julie Goldblatt (John), Christopher White (Angela Wehr); sisters, Joyce Bousquet and Karen Brienzo; brother-in-law, William Stadnik (Jan); grandchildren, Mitchell, Jessi, Dallan, and Justine; and an aunt; cousins; nieces; and nephews he held dear. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 49 years, Jacqueline, and his brother, Stanley “Bud” White.\n\nJim grew up on the southside of Chicago. He caddied at the Oak Park Country Club throughout high school, earning the Evans Caddie Scholarship. In college, he met his wife Jacquie on a blind date. They were married in 1965 and immediately set off for Jim’s flight training school in Texas to begin a long adventure together in the Air Force. Initially flying KC-135 and C-130 planes, Jim later shifted to piloting helicopters, namely the HH-3 “Jolly Green Giant”. He served more than 13 tours of duty, flew search and rescue in Vietnam, and lastly served as Chief of Staff for Air Force Special Operations Command in Florida. He retired honorably in 1992 as a Colonel after 26 years of service, having earned numerous awards including the AF Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross. He then began a brief career as Airfield Operations Manager for the Albuquerque International Airport.\n\nAfter seven years, he retired again to support his wife’s career and to have the time to enjoy his family. In 2009, his sense of duty compelled him to answer the call to join the New Mexico State Legislature. His quiet, introspective, and calm demeanor earned him the respect of members of both parties. He served five years as a State Representative and another five years as State Senator.\n\nJim was devoted to his family. He regularly kept in touch with his children, grandchildren, siblings, and extended family members. He was always ready to celebrate the news of a wedding, graduation, promotion, or new family member. An avid lifelong golfer, Jim’s appreciation for the game mirrored his approach to life: respect the game, play by the rules, celebrate the birdies, and don’t dwell on the bogies. He often teed off before the sun, walked the course with the bag over his shoulder, and finished the 18th in time for breakfast. He meticulously kept score, marking not just his score for each hole, but also the number of putts taken.\n\nHe never shied from adventure. His stories are treasured family folklore: getting slightly tangled in The Great Train Robbery due to an abandoned car in France, an illegal U-turn in South Korea’s royal palace, a passport debacle in Malaysia, dancing with the Maasai Mara in Kenya, hiking the Grand Canyon with a torn ligament, and cycling down Mauna Kea at the break of dawn. A true storyteller, he told each one with a healthy dose of humor. He touched a great many lives with his love, kindness, and compassion. He quietly supported his family, friends, community, and country, with his wisdom, advice and simply leading by example. He earned the love and respect of many.\n\nJim will be laid to rest with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Mass will be celebrated Wednesday, January 27, 2021, 10:00 a.m. at Our Lady of the Annunciation Catholic Church, 2621 Vermont Street NE, Albuquerque, NM with Msgr. Bennett Voorhies."
