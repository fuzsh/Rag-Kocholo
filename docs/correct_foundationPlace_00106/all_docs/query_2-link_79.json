        "text": "GRID 2 associate producer Iain Smith has said the formula for BAFTA award-winning GRID 1 is in place with the second outing, but once more, Codemasters plans on expanding upon such a strong foundation by immersing players to the point they feel as if they're an actual race driver.\n\nSpeaking with OPM, Smith said the team is \"absolutely going to nail it\" with GRID 2, by developing a \"crystal clear\" experience; an experience executive producer Clive Moody said has taken the team four years to build, and it's in no rush to get it out the door.\n\n\"[Codemasters] wanted it to be fantastic and we wanted it to be fantastic,\" said Moody. \"I guess in the grand scheme of things four years is a maybe little longer than we would’ve liked to have taken over it, but you know, there’s good reasons behind that and I think we’ll have a much better end game experience for being able to take that time.\n\n“I think that’s one of the cool things about Codemasters – they really understand what we do within the development studio, so there was absolutely no pressure on us to rush the game.\"\n\nThe ultimate goal for the development team, is to ship a racing product which has more believability, and to give the player moments where they \"really get that spark and that sort of holy moment of gaming.”\n\nGRID 2 launches on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 during summer 2013."
