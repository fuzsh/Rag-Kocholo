        "text": "Donations\n\nThe Keep Fighting Foundation is a non-profit limited liability company based in Germany. It receives its funds mainly from the private assets of Michael Schumacher and his family and diverted income such as profit from collaborations and/or merchandising. The foundation does not conduct proactive fundraising.\n\nIf you would like to support the goals and work of the foundation, you can see our bank details below. To avoid misunderstandings, we would like to emphasise that the funds are of course NOT intended for Michael Schumacher. Rather, they are distributed in his place; in continuation of his years of charitable work.\n\nThank you very much for your trust in the Keep Fighting Foundation.\n\nBank details:\n\nDE97 4585 0005 0000 4177 74\n\nBIC: WELADED1LSD\n\nSparkasse Lüdenscheid\n\nMerchandise\n\nBy purchasing the VR goggles, the mouth/nose mask and other products, you are making a direct contribution to the Keep Fighting Foundation.\n\nYou can find the products at www.michaelschumachershop.com.\n\nFurther products are in preparation.\n\nThe Michael Schumacher coin collection began with coins commemorating the 25th anniversary of Michael's first FIA Formula One World Championship in 1994.\n\nIn cooperation with Formula One and the Keep Fighting Foundation, Rosland Capital now proudly offers its 2022 gold and silver proof coins. The 999.9 fine gold coins are 0.25 Troy oz. and the .999 fine silver coins are 2.5 Troy oz. All 2022 coins bear the portrait of Michael Schumacher along with his signature/logo and the F1 logo. They also honor the late Queen Elizabeth II with a portrait designed by Ian Rank-Broadley. The protective packaging shows Mr. Schumacher’s logo and signature as well as a certificate number, statement of metal fineness, weight, proof quality statement and the signature of the Swiss assayer.\n\nAll coins in the 2022 collection are minted by the Swiss-based PAMP, renowned for being one of the finest international producers of precious metal coins.\n\nThe Keep Fighting Foundation receives a share from the sale of each coin. A special thanks goes to our friends and partners of Formula 1.\n\nTo celebrate Michael Schumacher's 50th birthday, a unique collection of fine art print art prints and posters celebrated his first title win with Ferrari at Suzuka 2000. Automobilist partnered with Scuderia Ferrari and the Keep Fighting Foundation to create a series of unique art prints and posters.\n\nThe limited edition artwork and a series of premium posters fuses 3D models and digital photography with a technique all its own. The computer-generated image achieves a breathtaking quality. A team of artists, technicians and designers worked for several months on the process, which included a 3D scan of Michael Schumacher's F1-2000 F1 car and helmet.\n\nIn addition, there is a series of five posters that tie in with scenes at Suzuka on that day. One of these, depicting a bird's eye view of a pit stop, is also available as a numbered Unique & Limited edition. Further prints are in the works.\n\nComputer games\n\nThe Keep Fighting Foundation is partnering with EA Sports and Codemasters to celebrate Michael Schumacher's career with a bespoke deluxe edition within the official video game of the FIA Formula One World Championship.\n\nFans who purchase the F1 2020 Deluxe Schumacher Edition will be able to race as Michael Schumacher in four of his most iconic cars. Players will also receive exclusive content such as themed car liveries and driver customisation items, including a unique podium celebration and a very spectacular 'Keep Fighting livery'.\n\nThe four cars included in the F1 2020 Deluxe Schumacher Edition are:\n\n- 1991: Jordan 191\n\n- 1994: Benetton B194\n\n- 1995: Benetton B195\n\n- 2000: Ferrari F1-2000\n\nwww.codemasters.com\n\nThe Starbox\n\nAs a special highlight, Keep Fighting Foundation presents the STARBOX in a limited edition of 91 copies, hand-signed by Michael Schumacher.\n\nThe 7 selected photographs, embossed with Michael Schumacher's logo, represent his 7 world championship titles. Spanning a quarter of a century and documenting the various aspects of Formula 1, the 7 photographs are part of Michael Schumacher's selection of his favourite images by internationally renowned photographer Michel Comte.\n\nWhen Michael Schumacher's first career came to an end in 2006, they both envisaged the launch of such a compilation; Michael Schumacher personally signed the inserts at the time\n\nA part of the proceeds go to the Keep Fighting Foundation.\n\nwww.alberszimmermann.com"
