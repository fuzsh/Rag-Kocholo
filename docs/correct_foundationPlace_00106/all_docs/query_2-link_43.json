        "text": "The course focuses on video games design and communication. You will gain a grounding within the industry’s design and production principles while developing your creative and teamwork skills.\n\nDeveloping you as a professional developer\n\nThe course covers core video game design methodologies and video game development tools, as well as contemporary agile software development techniques to make you a competent and adaptable game designer, capable of finding employment in the sector or preparing you for further academic study.\n\nYour first position in the video game industry\n\nBuilding upon your core design skills, in the second year you will be tasked with a specific role within our in-house game development studio over the summer term. This work experience gives you the opportunity to apply the knowledge and professional practices you’ve learnt on the course in a safe and supportive environment. Typically for these projects you’ll be using industry standard game development tools such as Unity and Unreal.\n\nThe work students produce during these summer placements can act as excellent portfolio pieces, which demonstrate their ability as both a professional game developer and effective team member.\n\nBest of class facilities and staff\n\nTeaching takes place in a modern production studio based in Birmingham City Centre where you’ll be provided with studio space to complete projects and access to the software you’ll need for the duration of the course.\n\nYou will be taught by staff with significant experience in the video game development industry, having worked with game developers including Psygnosis, Rage Software, Codemasters, FreeStyleGames and EA Games.\n\nReal experience\n\nBy the time you graduate, you’ll have three years of tangible games development studio experience under your belt, ready to launch your dream career as a games developer.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to apply for one of our one-year Gamer Camp courses, to gain even more in-depth skills, and experience.\n\nThe course is structured around teaching you new skills and allowing you the freedom to experiment and experience putting your new skills into practice through stakeholder-directed live projects.\n\nTypically, this means modules are split into taught modules and studio-based project modules.\n\nIn the taught modules the focus is on your personal development as a professional designer. You will also learn professional project management methodologies to help you deliver your design projects. You will take modules which focus on the development of skills for specific roles within the sector, for example, understanding the history and fundamentals of Game Design, looking at 2D and 3D Game Spaces, and advanced and strategic Game Design.\n\nThe Video Game Design course is all about providing you with crucial experience-based learning you'll need for your career. To this end during the summer you will be required to attend an in-house work placement. It is during these modules you’ll be using development tools such as Unity & Unreal.\n\nThis undergraduate degree course has professional game development studio experience embedded as part of your learning journey.\n\nYou'll be assessed in a variety of different ways, including practical project work – both group and individual – presentations, written reports and practical portfolios.\n\nAssessment is embedded into the course, which will mean your learning experience isn't constantly interrupted by assessment. You are also assessed on your work within a project delivery team while you are based in our simulated in-house studio environment.\n\nThe course culminates with a project you define yourself which targets a specific subsector of the video games industry, for example; working as a component and technical designer or even managing a project using Agile Project Management methodologies (note this is not an exhaustive list of roles). You have the choice of either proposing your own individual project or collaborating with other students to create another video game project for your portfolio.\n\nPlacements\n\nDuring the summer term of your first year, you will have the opportunity to work in a video game development team as part of the in-house placement element of the course.\n\nDuring the summer on the first year of your course after the foundation year, you’ll have a guaranteed placement in an in-house development studio. Our students previously worked directly with The Wellcome Trust on an interactive, online awareness campaign which involved making, video games, web apps, mobile apps and video material to promote The Crunch initiative.\n\nStudents have also worked along postgraduates to make a mobile version of the PlayStation 4 Xtreme Drone Racing game which is being developed as part of the PlayStationFirst initiative. The mobile versions features racing against 40 drones in a variety of locations in Birmingham, geotagged content and extensive drone customisation.\n\nGraduate stories\n\nArthur Fostier\n\nGameplay Designer, Pixel Toys\n\n“I’m currently working on a mobile strategy title entitled “Realm War” where I’m responsible for balancing the different units in the game. This involves a deep understanding of all kinds of interactions and mechanics of each unit, as well as being informed in regards to how users are playing the game. The production element of the course has been immensely useful for my role at Pixel Toys, as it gave me a better understanding of how to realistically go through the many steps of content development when I first joined the studio.”\n\nFind out more about Arthur's role\n\nBirmingham City University is a vibrant and multicultural university in the heart of a modern and diverse city. We welcome many international students every year – there are currently students from more than 80 countries among our student community.\n\nThe University is conveniently placed, with Birmingham International Airport nearby and first-rate transport connections to London and the rest of the UK.\n\nOur international pages contain a wealth of information for international students who are considering applying to study here, including:\n\nDetails of the entry requirements for our courses\n\nSome of the good reasons why you should study here\n\nHow to improve your language skills before starting your studies\n\nInformation relevant to applicants from your country\n\nWhere to find financial support for your studies."
