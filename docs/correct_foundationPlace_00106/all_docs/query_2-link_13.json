        "text": "Formula 1 New Balance Esports Series To Kick Off Its Third Season\n\nApril 2nd, 2019 by Isher Dhillon\n\nFormula 1®, the pinnacle of motorsport, has announced that the third instalment of the F1 New Balance Esports Series will kick off on 8 April 2019. Building on the success of last year, the stakes for the 2019 season have been raised. Not only has the Series been extended to include even more adrenaline fuelled racing, but the official F1 teams will be battling it out for more than double the prize money – with a staggering $500,000 prize fund to be won.\n\nLike the 2018 season, which reached a record audience of 5.5 million viewers across selected TV networks and a dedicated live stream, this season will be split into Qualifying, a Pro Draft and the Pro Series. However, each segment of the 2019 Series has been expanded, making this the biggest and most ambitious season yet.\n\nA longer qualifying window will give even more of the world’s top drivers and aspiring gamers the chance to compete for a place in the prestigious Pro Draft. All entrants will compete in F1 2018, the official game of the FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP™, on the PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system, the Xbox One family of devices including the Xbox One X and PC.\n\nFor the first time ever, one lucky esports fan will also be given the unique opportunity to experience the adrenaline and excitement of both the 2019 F1 New Balance Esports Series and real-world F1. An all-expenses paid trip to the Pro Draft, as well as tickets to the Formula 1 Rolex British Grand Prix on 14 July is up for grabs. To enter, fans simply need to complete one attempt during the three online qualifying events hosted between April and May as well as ensure they are signed up and registered on www.f1esports.com, with the winner chosen via a random prize draw.\n\nThe Pro Draft will take place over two days in July and is where the official F1 teams will select the drivers they want to add to their roster to represent them in the Pro Series. A series of high stakes race-offs on day one will identify the best of the best from the drivers that qualified. The slowest drivers will be eliminated, while the fastest will make up the final pool from which the teams will make their picks on day two. Every official F1 team must select at least one of its drivers from the Pro Draft.\n\nThe expanded season means that at the Pro Series, the official F1 teams and their drivers will now compete in four live events, compared to just three events last year, between September and December 2019. These races will determine the 2019 F1 New Balance Esports Series Teams’ and Drivers’ World Champions, with an increased prize fund of $500,000.\n\nFollowing the success of the competition last year, which saw Great Britain’s Brendon Leigh crowned champion for the second time, F1 has renewed its partnership with Codemasters and Gfinity for the 2019 F1 New Balance Esports Series. New Balance, the footwear and lifestyle brand, will remain as Title Partner and will be fully integrated into the Series, with all drivers wearing New Balance socks and shoes whilst racing in the Pro Series. Fanatec also remain on board as Official Sponsor, supplying the championship with elite and advanced equipment.\n\nThe 2019 F1 New Balance Esports Pro Series will also follow the World Championship rule change, to award the driver of the Fastest Lap a point, and DHL will once again reward the overall winner of the Fastest Lap with an award. Plus, to celebrate their 50th anniversary, DHL are working with F1 to deliver the time-trial invitational event ahead of the Pro Draft.\n\nA new and exclusive agreement with Juss Intellisport Co. Ltd will also bring the electrifying world of F1 Esports to China for the first time ever. The F1 New Balance Esports Series – China Championship will launch in the late summer of 2019, expanding F1’s reach and presence in one of the leading esports nations in the world. A special event will take place at the Formula 1 Heineken Chinese Grand Prix 2019 to celebrate this landmark moment at F1’s 1000th Grand Prix, signalling the progression, new era and refreshed direction of F1. Top Chinese gamers will be invited to race off in a warm up exhibition event ahead of the full launch of the China Championship later in the year. The China Championship will give a select number of the fastest and most skilled Chinese gamers automatic entry into the prestigious Pro Draft in 2020.\n\nSean Bratches, Managing Director, Commercial Operations at Formula 1, said: “Last season was a decisive year for F1 Esports with the inclusion of the first official teams and record audience figures. As we move into this 2019 season, F1 will remain at the forefront of this explosive industry. The potential within this space is extremely exciting both as a commercial opportunity, but importantly, as a way for the sport to engage with the next generation of motorsport fans. We are committed to exponential growth in the world of esports, and as a result the 2019 season is going to be even bigger and better. Having more than doubled the prize fund, we plan to attract even more talent to the series and to continue the upward trajectory we are on.”\n\nFrank Sagnier, CEO at Codemasters, said: “The F1 New Balance Esports Series creates exciting opportunities for Codemasters to further engage with our core community and develop experiences for fans with a passion for both virtual and real-world racing. We’re always investigating ways to better integrate esports into our F1 games, as this will encourage more players to test their race skills against the top professionals, and we look forward to welcoming the new talent who will emerge this season.”\n\nGarry Cook, Executive Chairman at Gfinity plc, said: “F1 New Balance Esports Series has captured the imagination of the global gaming community. It delivers incredible racing and through entertaining content, such as the draft show, gives fans a reason to care about the drivers. Esports fans want it all. They want the back stories, the drivers’ journeys to greatness, the emotion of being chosen to represent an F1 team. And they want to experience daring manoeuvres on the track. F1 New Balance Esports Series delivers this. That is why a new and younger audience is embracing the F1 story. Series 3 is going to be bigger, bolder and more entertaining than ever.”\n\nFor more information on the 2019 F1 New Balance Esports Series visit www.f1esports.com.\n\nClaire Edwards, Communications Manager E: CEdwards@F1.com M: +44 (0)7876 859 634\n\nFormula 1 Press Office E: f1media@f1.com T: @f1media\n\nEdelman Press Office E: Formula1@edelman.com\n\nAbout Formula 1® Formula 1® racing began in 1950 and is the world’s most prestigious motor racing competition, as well as the world’s most popular annual sporting series.

A total of 26 drivers representing 12 different nationalities joined their F1 Esports teams to compete on the F1 2018 official video game developed by Codemasters, for the coveted prize fund of $200,000 – allocated to the teams based on their positions in the team standings. More than 3,000 laps were completed, covering at least 1,000km of virtual track and taking over four hours of combined race time.\n\nFrank Arthofer, Director of Digital and New Business at Formula 1 said:\n\n“The viewing figures for this year’s series are a testament to the series’ growing interest and engagement with a new audience. The younger generation has truly embraced the F1 Esports Series. Looking to next year it is our ambition to continue to grow participation and engagement with the series and we will be building on various elements, such as giving fans the opportunity to go from living room to podium, which has clearly resonated with this audience.”\n\nJulian Tan, Head of Growth & F1 Esports at Formula 1 said:\n\n“The 2018 F1 Esports Series has been a resounding success, and it’s fantastic to see such a strong response in the viewing figures and levels of engagement. We have also had great partners in New Balance, DHL and Fanatec come on board to support the programme. With esports being a new direction for F1, we came into this season with a test and learn approach, and this is something we will continue into 2019. The introduction of components such as the Pro Draft mechanic helped to drive another layer of excitement that captured imaginations, and a key goal for next year will be to continue to move towards building a\n\nsustainable series structure.”\n\nThe F1 New Balance Esports Series was operated in partnership with Codemasters, the developer and publisher of the official Formula 1 video game franchise and Gfinity, one of the world’s leading esports companies.

As Lewis Hamilton secured his fifth FIA Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship at the Mexican Grand Prix last weekend, reigning F1 Esports champion Brendon Leigh – who now has a 43-point lead on Frederik Rasmussen– is on track to secure his second title. Mercedes AMG Petronas Esports leads the Teams’ Championship with 208 points, with Toro Rosso Esports Teams second (137) and Red Bull Racing Esports third (59).\n\nThe first race of the event was held at the Circuit Paul Ricard, where the French Grand Prix took place last June. With two laps to go, Leigh and Toro Rosso’s Frederik Rasmussen made contact in their battle for the lead, with the Dane finishing off track and then overtaken by his teammate Patrik Holzmann. Leigh was initially given a five second penalty as a result, but then the decision was later reversed by the stewards – securing him the win.\n\nSilverstone was the stage for the second race of the event and the continuing battle between Leigh and Rasmussen. After Hype Energy eForce India’s Donoso Delgado was given a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, Leigh and Rasmussen were left to fight it out for the race win. The Mercedes driver eventually secured his fourth win, followed by Rasmussen in second. The podium was rounded out by Hype Energy eForce India’s Marcel Kiefer.\n\nThe final race of the event took place at the infamous Spa-Francorchamps. With Mercedes AMG Petronas Esports’ Daniel Bereznay out in front by some margin, an intense battle for the other podium place developed on the final lap. Red Bull Racing Esports Team’s Joni Tormala took second after Donoso Delgado was given a penalty for exceeding track limits. Rasmussen stole third in the four-way battle across the line, with Sauber F1 Esports Team’s Salih Saltunc taking fourth from Leigh on the final straight.\n\nThe second Pro Series event was streamed live via Facebook and broadcast globally on selected TV networks. Viewing figures are expected to be strong, after the first live event of the Pro Series accumulated 23m impressions and 3.2m views on social media, bringing the excitement and exhilaration of Formula 1 to a new generation of fans across the globe.\n\nThe F1 New Balance Esports Pro Series has brought together the most talented motorsport gamers in the world for the second year in a row. This year, the drivers had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to race with the backing of some of the most prestigious names in motor racing following an intensive selection process.\n\nThe Pro Series comprises of three live events held at London’s Gfinity Esports Arena, with drivers competing for the coveted prize fund of $200,000 – allocated to the teams based on their positions in the team standings.
