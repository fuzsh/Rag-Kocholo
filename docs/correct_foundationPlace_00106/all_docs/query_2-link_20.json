        "text": "Monday 14th June/... Set to put the fun back into the gun, Codemasters ® today released the E3 gameplay video for Bodycount TM . Designed by Stuart Black, Bodycount is the first game from an all-star team at Codemasters Studios Guildford and scheduled for release in the spring of 2011. The video is available to view at the newly launched game blog www.bodycountgame.com.\n\nThe ‘Welcome to The Network’ reveal video is entirely captured from the pre-alpha E3 build and gives a work-in-progress insight into the stylish, outrageous arcade action Bodycount blasts from both barrels. Opening in a desolated African landscape, intense fire-fights rage between military and militia factions as the player tears though cover in an orgy of bullets and destruction to take them down.\n\nThe video shows a wide range of environmental elements shredding and exploding in real time as Bodycoun t’s super-charged weaponry rips them to pieces, dynamically changing the environment and presenting unique tactical challenges and opportunities for players. Gamers are also introduced to the ‘Psycho Tank’, a mini-gun wielding maniac who stops at nothing as he smashes through walls to get to his target.\n\nIn Bodycount , players assume the role of a young renegade who finds himself in a deadly situation way beyond his control when he becomes ensnared by a shadowy organisation known only as ‘The Network’. He becomes a ‘John Doe’, an anonymous yet powerful ‘combat asset’, dropped into the world’s most dangerous warzones to carry out overt assassinations with extreme prejudice.\n\nPlayers can deploy a mouth-watering selection of contemporary weaponry and unleash a range of heavy-duty tactical support, including mobile gun platforms and fearsome air support by collecting Intel and chaining kills to rack up their Bodycount . Guided by a female operative, who is as enigmatic as her employers, players are encouraged to leave no witnesses as they engage in chaotic, close-quarters combat and best in class gun play.\n\nBodycount rips apart the FPS with a single-minded focus on the bullet and its impact on the world. Whether it’s the bone-jarring, blood-spattering devastation of firing into an enemy or shredding scenery with a hail of bullets, every pull of the trigger is turned into a moment of exhilaration and power. Bodycount will put the fun back into the fun as the player takes on enemy squad AI who hunt in packs and experience the carnage caused by richly varied shredding technology, all powered by Codemasters’ EGO ® Game Technology platform.\n\nSet to feature online and co-operative multiplayer modes, Bodycount is in development for the Xbox 360 ® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft ® and PlayStation ® 3 computer entertainment system. See the new video by tearing over to the all new blog at www.bodycountgame.com, the new home for all things Bodycount . Set to feature behind the scenes access, developer interviews, exclusive features, screens, videos and competitions, the site will connect fans to the studio from now until launch and beyond.
