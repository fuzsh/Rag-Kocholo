As soon as the intrusion was detected, we immediately took\n\ncodemasters.com and associated web services offline in order to prevent\n\nany further intrusion.\n\nDuring the days since the attack we have conducted a thorough\n\ninvestigation in order to ascertain the extent and scope of the breach\n\nand have regrettably discovered that the intruder was able to gain\n\naccess to the following:\n\nCodemasters.com website\n\nAccess to the Codemasters corporate website and sub-domains.\n\nDiRT 3 VIP code redemption page\n\nAccess to the DiRT 3 VIP code redemption page.\n\nThe Codemasters EStore\n\nWe believe the following have been compromised: Customer names and\n\naddresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, encrypted passwords and\n\norder history. Please note that no personal payment information was\n\nstored with Codemasters as we use external payment providers, meaning\n\nyour payment details were not at risk from this intrusion.\n\nCodemasters CodeM database\n\nMembers' names, usernames, screen names, email addresses, date of birth,\n\nencrypted passwords, newsletter preferences, any biographies entered by\n\nusers, details of last site activity, IP addresses and Xbox Live\n\nGamertags are all believed to have been compromised.\n\nWhilst we do not have confirmation that any of this data was actually\n\ndownloaded onto an external device, we have to assume that, as access\n\nwas gained, all of these details were compromised and/or stolen.\n\nThe Codemasters.com website will remain offline for the foreseeable\n\nfuture with all Codemasters.com traffic re-directed to the Codemasters\n\nFacebook page instead. A new website will launch later in the year.\n\nAdvice\n\nFor your security, in the first instance we advise you to change any\n\npasswords you have associated with other Codemasters accounts. If you\n\nuse the same login information for other sites, you should change that\n\ninformation too. Furthermore, be extra cautious of potential scams, via\n\nemail, phone, or post that ask you for personal or sensitive\n\ninformation. Please note that Codemasters will never ask you for any\n\npayment data such as credit card numbers or bank account details, nor\n\nwill Codemasters ask you for passwords or other personal identifying\n\ndata.

We assure you that we are doing\n\neverything within our legal means to track down the perpetrators and\n\ntake action to the full extent of the law.\n\nWe apologise for this incident and regret any inconvenience caused.\n\nWe are contacting all customers who may have been affected directly.\n\nShould you have any concerns or wish to speak to a member of our\n\nCustomer Services team, please email them at\n\ncustservice@codemasters.com.\n\nYou have been sent this email as part of your Codemasters Code M\n\nmembership.
