Linux is yet to be among them.\n\nSteam User Gets The Ball Rolling\n\nOver on the Steam forums one gamer decided to check in on their plans for Linux going forward, asking:\n\n“Honestly doubt that this is a thing since you don’t have any other Linux games but any chance for support? If not at launch but even post launch?”\n\nBen Warwickshire, community manager at Codemasters, replied with refreshing candidness:\n\n“Not at launch but it is something we’re looking at and having discussions around. We’d love to support Linux, is a matter of when not if and for what titles.”\n\nWhile Warwickshire’s response is far from being the sort of concrete commitment that many within Linux’s band of gaming enthusiasts would like, it’s undoubtedly more optimistic than the ‘we’ll see’ statements other major games companies have given when asked."
