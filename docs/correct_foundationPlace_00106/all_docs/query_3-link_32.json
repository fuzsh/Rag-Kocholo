        "text": "Previously I have enjoyed Codemasters' previous racing game instalments The TOCA series (one of my personal favourite series of racing games) Grid 1, Dirt 1 and 2 and Colin Mcrae rally 1 and 2. But in my opinion Codemasters have gone down Dirt 3 onwards. F1 2010 I enjoyed a lot but all the F1 games have been boring and repetitive afterwards with the exception of the classic DLC in 2013 which still got pretty dull after about a month. Other Codemasters games after F1 2010 are crap and basically a ton of ads for DLC pop up in ugly boxes. Dirt 3 may as well be called Pointless drifting and gymkhana in a rally car. F1 2011 had terrible console graphics. Dirt: Showdown ARRRRRRRRRRRRRGH! Two real cars and a load of stupid fake ones demolition derbies and try to knock cars out of a circle along with MORE GYMKHANA and DRIFTING! It's rally not FD! F1 2012 is boring. F1 Racestars is a Mario Kart Rip-off. F1 2013 is probably the most bearable since F1 2010. And F1 2014 sucks.\n\nI think a different studio should take F1 on. My favourite F1 game is F1 Championship Edition by Studio Liverpool. Far Superior to F1 2011 onwards. Realistic, tough and above all fun. Wouldn't mind EA taking the rights it would be better than Codemasters. I would love SL to take it on again and make another great game. Sorry Codies but your definitely not as good as you used to be.\n\nWouldn't mind EA taking the rights it would be better than Codemasters.\n\nSo you can have \"pay-to-win\" options, eh? Or you just might be too young to remember the old EA F1 games. Prefer F1 races with \"Slipstream Turbo\" boost? I think Codemaster's represent modern F1 insanely well - because the whole point of the F1 games is to generate those who don't really have an interest. I think they do that well, as well as serving the existing fanbase.\n\nBut you got to understand the complexity of working multi-plat global market. F1CE was PS3 only, I wouldn't hold it exactly high but it was also for the first F1 game to grace the American market in yeeeears. Who liked practicing in that awful dawn/dusk hour all the time? How was that an incredible remember-able experience? I marked that as misery.\n\nBut of course, Codemaster's have things they could work on - but nothing is perfect. The thing's that are messed up title after title don't numb the experience at all. I've done multiple seasons throughout F1 2010-F1 2014. The Codemaster's games are quite good IMO. Probably not as good as the unlicensed PC sims mods. But that's alright.\n\nF1 2014 wasn't remotely as bad people say. It's an F1 game - lower your standards. You don't buy new NASCAR licensed games year after year to drive Richard Petty's winning Superbird right? Yeah content was lowered, but with F1 2013 classic packs, don't forget. We paid extra for that at launch. Take away 2013's classic pack, guess what? It's the same $60 updated game you've bought since 2010.\n\nThey had plenty of opportunities to better the franchise. Don't know what the actual reason is. Maybe they should outsource GRID AS and F1, while pooling all their strengths towards Dirt. IMO, Dirt is the best series to come out of their studios.\n\nDirt 1, 2 and the Early Access one on Steam are great. Turn GRID back into Touring Cars or Race Driver esque series. Give the F1 franchise to someone else.\n\nBut of course, Codemaster's have things they could work on - but nothing is perfect.

Dunno 'bout NASCAR I can't really relate to that. It's an F1 game lower your standards????????????????????? What the heck? As an F1 fan I expect the highest standard of game for the best racing series on earth.\n\nPreviously I have enjoyed Codemasters' previous racing game instalments The TOCA series (one of my personal favourite series of racing games) Grid 1, Dirt 1 and 2 and Colin Mcrae rally 1 and 2.

Sorry Codies but your definitely not as good as you used to be.\n\nSL have been dissolved for years now so there's no chance of them getting the license.\n\nI like Codemasters' F1 games, they make the game for the F1 fan rather than hardcore racing fans. Which is what they should be for at the end of the day.\n\nMuch better and more realistic than Codemasters F1. Name another company? ISI, PD and SMS all could top Codemasters.\n\nEDIT: Sector 3 Studios (or SimBin to those of you unacquainted with the name change) could also do a better job.\n\nISI? So they can alienate the console gamers and make a hardcore sim on an ancient engine with awful Ai? PD with its lacklustre open wheel physics, lifeless tracks, poor sounds or sms who will spent 5 years developing a game that released broken and still isn't fixed? Sector3 speciality is tin top touring and gt racing so no I don't want them doing open wheel racing.\n\nWhen EA held the license, I enjoyed the games they were making, F1 career challenge is probably the highlight for me on the original xbox. Then sony got the license exclusively and started adding features we always wanted, making our own driver, proper career mode, podium scenes and eventually classic cars and formation laps. But they all lacked something. Through this whole time I wished that codemasters would get the license. Then that announcement came. It was probably higher profile than normal because 06 was the last season that got made, 09 was wii o ly and outsourced so by the time it dropped it has been 3 years since a proper F1 title.\n\nThey found what was missing from previous games, a passion for F1. 2010 and 2011 ooze passion. 2012 lost some of the live the life aspects and 2013 was, imo, the best of the series till now. Aside from 2014, every game improved one way or another. 2014 was what it was because of the next gen development. They couldn't justify putting all their resources into that game and risk throwing the development for next gen into disarray. It's also why 2015 is the way it is. It's a new lead, a new team, a brand new engine for graphics and physics. Fact is 2015 may as well have been made by a new studio because the whole thing is new. Too many people are blinded by hatred for codemasters when they haven't really done much wrong. In the eyes of most the main thing they have done wrong is not put what they want in th games. 2915 is a platform, a foundation for the future F1 games. If everyone took a step back and saw the bigger picture life would be great. At this current time there is no better studio than codemasters to be working on the F1 license. They are building a good relationship with FOM and the teams, which is crucial to getting the features people want. To ruin that now would be stupid and ruin the next 5, 6, 7 F1 games.\n\nISI?

One of the best sims I've played. Sector 3 games are awesome. Also Formula Raceroom I feel was a realistic interpretation of an open wheel racer which was in Race 07. Sony had some proper racing stuff in it and Codemasters is just a step backwards. 09 was also released on PSP. The Wii version was surprisingly great craic.\n\nPassion? Is that really what matters make a crap sim and say its better because it has passion is absolute garbage. How did the other games lack passion what passion is in the Codemasters one. Oh wait there is absolutely no freaking difference that makes no sense. It would not ruin the next seven games! It would improve the game immensely.\n\nYes they were basically made by ISI, however the console games were completely different games to the versions the PC gamers got which are the versions isi had the most input in. And as i am predominantly talking about cinsole gaming that is my main focus. This is also over 12 years ago. Project cars is so bug ridden I can't bring myself to play it, bugs that have existed since the earliest builds of the game and are still there. It might well be a good simulation of motorsport but it's still riddled with bugs that kill the enjoyment. Formula raceroom was fun for a car, fairly realistic I guess. AI still ducked in it.\n\nThe Wii version was poor. Your now only saying it was great because codemasters didn't make it.\n\nPassion doesn't make simulations no, but since when was this about being a simulation? Why do people always want racing games to be harder because \"that's more realistic\". The difficulty is perfectly balanced for 99% of F1 fans, which this game is aimed at. F1CE was too easy, that's just a fact, the driving physics are not as good as F1 2015s, the only thing it has going for it over 2015 is a career mode which we know we are getting in 2016. Passion for a sport is what makes sports games better because the people making them actually love the sport. They understand what makes a sport tick and what the fans enjoy because they are fans as well. Previous F1 games were too lifeless and bland, F1CE wasn't too bad in this respect but doesn't hold a candle to codemasters F1 games.\n\nIf the PC sims you have mentioned are so good, why are you here? F1 games will never be the super realistic hardcore pc sim experience you seem to want.\n\nYes they were basically made by ISI, however the console games were completely different games to the versions the PC gamers got which are the versions isi had the most input in.

F1 games will never be the super realistic hardcore pc sim experience you seem to want.\n\nHere because I want a realistic F1 game that is like F1CE. Codemasters is easier all day long. How was F1CE lifeless and bland? Has more life than Codemasters. Podium, commentary, brilliant display graphics just like you were watching on TV.\n\nOP did exactly that - Studio Liverpool made far better use of the official license in one game (F1:CE) than Codemasters has after seven whole years of holding it.\n\nAs for naming another, MicroProse.\n\n^THIS\n\nOh whoops forgot to include MicroProse (Geoff Crammond's games were great) I guess that makes five companies.\n\nCodemaster's strength is in the atmosphere of the game, that I don't deny and I don't think there is another developer that can do it as well as they do. But they fall short in the physics department and Q&A (bugs, glitches, etcetera).\n\nThat being said, I think the solution moving forward is for F1 to diversify its license use. Have Codemasters do the complete annual games, but also sublicence the cars and tracks freely to any other game developer that wants it. That way we can have a smattering of the most popular cars and tracks (from the past and present) in as many sims as possible (AC, PCARS, GT, FM, GSCE, RRRE, etc). Casual fans are happy with Codies forgiving handling. Hardcore fans are happy that they can run the full season in Codies games. Those who just wants to drive the cars with the best physics can do so in other games without paying full price for an official game with lacklustre physics. Everyone wins! (even FOM because they get to sell more licenses)\n\nOn the basis of what, exactly? Let's look at the facts:\n\n- No official overlay graphics\n\n- No commentary\n\n- No interviews (removed for who knows what reason)\n\n- No safety car (I don't care how infrequently it was issued in the previous games, it's a staple of the season and more importantly it's an officially licensed game)\n\n- No formation lap\n\nTake a look at this:\n\nNow I defy you to find anything in F1 2010-2015 that isn't a PC mod that has the same level of presentation as just the first six seconds (after the MGTV intro) of this video. F1:CE has a presence about it that every CM F1 game lacks, there's simply nothing to disagree upon regarding that.\n\nFirst game I bought for the PS3 in 2006. It was a terrific first attempt by Sony/Studio Liverpool. Shame they didn't do another one. Maybe because the fat and expensive PS3 wasn't doing well at that time and the game didn't sell well... Although the physics weren't that great compared today's driving games, it was a much better game than anything Codemasters has produced, in my opinion. I was rubbish at the QTE pit stops though.\n\nI think that codemasters have done a good job with the F1 games to be fair, but too many people are butt hurt over it not have the same career mode that their previous F1 games had. Fact is there is nothing at all wrong with the current championship mode, and I like the fact that all the role playing rubbish has gone for now. I don't play a racing game for the cutscenes, I play them for the racing and the driving of F1 cars. Sure there are other studios out there that could do a better job in terms of the physics, but the chances are very slim on it moving to a studio who would do that. The reason being, is that it needs to be brought too a wide player base. The game needs to cater to the casuals and the hardcore players alike, much like the WRC games made by milestone.\n\nIf Codemasters where to lose it though, I don't see why it would be a problem if EA got the chance to have another crack at it. As it stands, there old games where decent for the time, and I had a lot of fun playing those F1 games they made along side ISI. I also really enjoyed the F1 manager game they made, as it was something different. As it stands, EA and Dice could probably do a fairly decent job for F1. Dice themselves have made racing games in the past, and some pretty good ones at that.\n\nI would love to see T10 also have a go at an F1 game, but at the same time, I wouldnt want the F1 games to become locked out to one platform again. It was so annoying when F1 whet to a Sony exclusive, and it had the effect of me not playing them until F1 2013 came around. Which I only bought because I tried the demo for F1 2012 on my xbox 360. As it stands though, I am buying the F1 game for PC, as I can use my G27 on there.\n\nPersonally I am enjoying F1 2015, it has more atmosphere that the last 2 games have had, even if a little scripted. Driving the cars also feels a hell of a lot better than the last 2 games, and for me, the FFB is also improved. Though they really do need to add a wheel calibration tool in the settings menu, as for setup they have on Dirt Rally is far better.\n\nI also have to agree with @MildAshers . I also wouldn't want SMS to have a go with the F1 license.\n\nF1:CE was a great game when it came out on ps3, and had really nice graphics for it's time too. What I don't agree with is that it has better physics than the codies games. I bought a second hand copy of it for ps3, when F1 2013 was new (I had CE when it was new, but sold it). I started a career on it, and as soon as I hit the track I started remembering why I sold it. It was great in it's day, but the physics are really poor. It's ridiculously easy. Since F1 2012, the Codies games have been light years ahead of CE. Only missing some of the nice little bits CE had, like the official overlay, comentary (although in CE it was repetitive and annoying, and felt fake as hell), and the warm up lap and podium. I am glad they got rid of the stupid interviews in the Codies games though, they were so repetitive, it didn't seem even remotely real lol.\n\nI don't think Codies' games are perfect, far from in fact. I do however think they're doing a great job with 2015. Official F1 games just won't be realistic these days, as they want the games to target a wider audience than sim racers. I think the Codies games have gotten better and better, and I think next year's title will be by far the best in the series.\n\nWith that said, I think @LeGeNd-1 has a great idea there. I would also like to see the licence for F1 cars, old and new, to be sold to some of the sim studios. I like having the official game, but a yearly release game is never going to have deep physics. If SMS made the official game, we'd only get one every 5 or 6 years. So I think it'd be great if they could just buy the licence for certain years of F1 cars to include in their current sim. Same goes for the PC sim studios, although you can already get F1 mods for PC sims."
