I would recommend it to anyone looking to get an immersive crash course in web development and jumping straight into the industry. The teachers are active in the industry, know what they’re talking about, and genuinely care about you as a person and your future. Highly recommend.”\n\nBen Programmer @ Integranet\n\n“Studying Full Stack Web Development at Codemaster was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made for my professional life - and the added bonus was making friends for life among my fellow students and the staff. Not only did I have so much fun over the three months, but I graduated feeling accomplished (comparing my day one HTML/CSS exercise and my final day HTML/CSS, JavaScript and PHP website project was the difference between a Kindergarten painting and University essay), and confident that I now have a solid foundation to learn whatever else I want to in web development.\n\nThe Codemaster tight-knit team was the most supportive environment to learn in (and included lunches topped off the whole 5-star experience). ”\n\nBeth Digital Media Manager @ Hope Media\n\n“Really good course to get your head around what you need to know, I think this course has set me up with a good foundation and now I know what I need to focus my energies on. Thank you, Codemaster Institute.”\n\nKasonde Specialist Data Science and Analytics @ South32\n\n“Great experience and one of the best decisions I have ever made. Current knowledge from developers working in industry and an institution who genuinely cares about the future of its students.”\n\nSharne Project Mngr @ Humaan\n\n“Brilliant group, brilliant course. Tutor was very knowledgeable, and happy to tailor training to the needs of the participants. Great small class sizes, so you got plenty of chance to ask questions, do practice examples, and learn content. All other staff were very friendly, and it definitely felt like a home away from home. Will definitely be recommending to others.”\n\nFritha Data Coordinator @ Main Roads\n\n“I can go out into the industry and build stuff straight away.”\n\nJulian Programmer @ Browns\n\n“Excellent course. I started the course without any notion of A.I and Python. The first day introductory course in Python was the perfect start to equip me with the necessary skills to undertake the Machine Learning course. The knowledge gained from the course is invaluable. It was all hands-on learning approach, finding solutions to real world problems. A great thank you to Oliver, a highly skilled and dedicated lecturer, and also to the management who are truly professionals and well organised. I will definitely recommend this course to any aspiring Data Scientists and Machine Learning experts to enrol in this course. You won’t regret it. It’s the perfect start to a rewarding career. I will also recommend this course over any online Data Science or Machine Learning short courses, because the hands-on approach and support that you will get is second to none.”\n\nHerve Freelancer\n\n“Fantastic course for beginners and early career professionals. Has leapfrogged my skills forward a year.”\n\nAlex Data Analyst @ Deloitte\n\n“I started with Codemaster Institute because I really wanted to keep my career moving.”\n\nMandy Freelance Developer"
