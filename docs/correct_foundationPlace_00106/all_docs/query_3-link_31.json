        "text": "I love it when racing becomes more than a sport and turns into a force for good. Today is one of those times. Codemasters has just announced a new DLC pack being released today called the “Keep Fighting Foundation” pack.\n\nThe DLC contains a brand new car livery, racing suit, helmet, gloves, badge and podium emote all inspired by Michael Schumacher. To be clear, these cosmetics are completely different than the ones that come with the Michael Schumacher edition of F1 2020.\n\nProceeds from the DLC will go straight to Michael Schumacher’s “Keep Fighting Foundation” organization that supports several charitable causes that support public health and education. Which are areas I think we can all agree need more support.\n\nThe DLC is set to go live today on the PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 versions of F1 2020 while the Google Stadia version will get the DLC tomorrow. As of the time of writing this post I haven’t seen the DLC go up yet on Xbox One but it is currently live on PC (via Steam) for $4.99.\n\nTo get a better look a the new livery, check out the gallery below.\n\nPress release:\n\nF1 2020 Supports ‘Keep Fighting Foundation’ in Honor of Michael Schumacher\n\nNew premium Michael Schumacher charity DLC available starting today\n\nLarkspur, Calif (Aug 10, 2020) – Codemasters today announces its support for the Keep Fighting Foundation, which is inspired by Michael Schumacher. Launching today on PC, F1® 2020, the official videogame of the 2020 FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP™, features a set of Keep Fighting Foundation DLC. The premium items, which can be purchased together in-game, features a car livery, podium emote, helmet, gloves, suit and badge. PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Google Stadia will go live on Tuesday, Aug 11. Proceeds from the sales will go directly to the Keep Fighting Foundation.\n\n“It was an honor for the studio to focus on Michael’s record-breaking F1 career for the F1 2020 Deluxe Schumacher Edition,” said F1 Franchise Game Director at Codemasters, Lee Mather. “We are equally proud to support the Keep Fighting Foundation. Many of our players regard Michael as the greatest of all time, and we know the exclusive items will prove incredibly popular.”\n\nThe June Schumacher trailer can be viewed here – https://youtu.be/8Ei5N_xBiqg\n\nF1 2020 released on Friday, July 10 for PlayStation 4, the Xbox One and Xbox One X, PC (Steam), and Google Stadia (MSRP $59.99)."
