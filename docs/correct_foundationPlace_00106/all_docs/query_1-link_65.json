        "text": "On February 18 2021, Electronic Arts (EA) completed the acquisition of UK-based game developer and publisher Codemasters, with the deal worth around $1.2 billion.\n\nThe deal means that Codemasters' popular racing brands including Formula 1, Need for Speed, DIRT, DiRT Rally/WRC, GRID, Project CARS, Real Racing and more will now sit under EA's existing racing/sport brands such as Need for Speed, Real Racing, EA Sports FIFA and more.\n\nEA was already one of the biggest game developers and publishers in the world, with a portfolio of popular brands such as EA SPORTS FIFA, Battlefield, Apex Legends, The Sims, Madden NFL, Need for Speed, Titanfall and Plants vs. Zombies.\n\n* Click here to subscribe to Level up! The Esports and Gaming Show, the podcast is available on Spreaker, Spotify, Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.*\n\nWhen the acquisition was first confirmed by EA on February 18, they stated that: \"The union will open significant growth opportunities for Codemasters franchises with access to Electronic Arts’ network of more than 430 million players and industry-leading multi-platform subscription services.\n\n\"Electronic Arts also brings deep data and analytics capabilities to the Codemasters development and publishing teams, providing audience insights to accelerate the performance of key franchises.\"\n\nOne of Codemasters' most popular brands is the Formula 1 gaming series, with the latest title within the series being F1 2020, which was released on July 10, 2020 for PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Stadia.\n\nThe Warwickshire-based game developer have developed and published twelve Formula 1 games in total, having secured the official Formula One video game licence back in 2008, with their latest release reaching number one in the United Kingdom sales charts in the first week of its release.\n\nF1 2020 is also the game used in official F1 Esports competitions and virtual races, with these events seeing huge surges of interest over the last 12 months, matching the rise in popularity of the esports industry as a whole.\n\nThe F1 Esports Pro Series enjoyed more than 11 million views in live stream views alone in 2020, which is almost double the in-session watch time from 2019. In addition, the incredibly popular Virtual Grand Prix Series was seen more than 30 million times around the world, but that number rises to 85 million if you include figures from Twitter, Instagram, and China channels Huya and Weibo.\n\nBut it's not just watch time, because more people want to participate in F1 Esports than ever before. In fact, more than 237,000 people attempted to qualify for F1 Esports in 2020, an increase of 117% from 2019, which goes to show the incredible growth in popularity of F1 Esports and the esports industry as whole.\n\nAnd it's this that makes EA's acquisition of Codemasters incredibly interesting because, amid the remarkable success of the game, the growing popularity of esports and the upcoming release of their next Formula 1 gaming title, will EA be able to help push the franchise onto even greater heights?\n\nFollowing EA's acquisition of Codemasters, Mirror Sport have received exclusive quotes from Steve Pointon, SVP of 3rd Party Content Development at EA, who participated in a Q&A session to give more detail on EA's vision for Codemasters, including details on the development of the F1 gaming franchise, budgets, esports, looking ahead to F1 2021 and more.\n\nHow much influence will EA have in terms of the development of the game (F1 2021)? Or, will Codemasters still retain complete control over development?\n\n\"We will be treating the Codemasters’ studios as an independent group for the foreseeable future, whilst giving them all the support they need to deliver their much-loved games and exploring all opportunities for growth as we go,\" said Steve Pointon, SVP of 3rd Party Content Development at EA.\n\n\"We’re incredibly excited about what the future holds for them and while they will remain independent, we will be there to pour fuel on their growth capabilities.\n\nHow excited are EA about the potential of F1 Esports, given it's success over the last 12 months?\n\n\"We’re very excited about the future of F1®.\n\n\"What’s been brilliant to see is how our competitive gaming division enables our players and communities to come together to play and be entertained.\n\n\"Video games are now a spectator sport and we know that this drives new players to engage in new ways.\n\n\"This is of course against a backdrop where sports video games represent huge potential to broaden the overall interactive sports experience.\n\n\"This in turn opens new audiences up to real world sports through our amazing games and content, allowing players to be truly immersed, whereas previously it was more of a linear experience.\n\nWill EA be able to help the popular F1 gaming series become even more popular, considering their EA's speciality with sports titles? And, how?\n\n\"We know there’s a huge market for racing games and we believe it’s one that has significant room for growth and potential. We’ve long admired Codemasters, their development and creative capabilities and innovation are world-class.\n\n\"Bringing their skills and expertise with our own could revolutionise the genre. The passion and drive of our two groups to deliver amazing racing games, with the combined technical abilities, strength in arcade racing, simulation and narrative makes for a heady mix for any petrolhead.\n\n\"Add to that the player insights, the competitive capabilities, the in-market presence, the partnership potential and the technical capabilities that EA has, we know this will mark the beginning of a new, unrivalled racing powerhouse.\n\n\"It’s going to take this critically acclaimed content and new innovative ideas available to more players, on more platforms in more places.\n\nWill Codemasters have a bigger development budget due to EA's takeover?\n\n\"While I can’t comment on specific development budgets, I can say that the union brings opportunities for Codemasters to benefit from access to our EA functions and resources to help further grow its amazing racing titles.\n\nHow much impact will EA's takeover have over the soon-to-be-launching F1 2021? Or, will EA's influence become clearer next year?\n\n\"At this point we are just beginning to talk about what we can do to help and support Codemasters’ growth objectives and plans have not yet been defined.\n\nHow excited are EA about the potential of Codemasters' range of gaming titles under their new ownership?\n\n\"Our industry is growing and the racing category is growing worldwide, making this a very exciting time for us to welcome Codemasters and their critically-acclaimed titles to the EA family.\n\n\"Bringing together EA and Codemasters immediately creates an opportunity to grow existing franchises, and we see opportunities across the entire Codemasters portfolio, from Formula One® to DIRT and DiRT Rally, GRID and Project CARS.\n\n\"We can see what’s ahead for some of these already, but are most excited by what we don’t yet know is to come. Codemasters and our own studios are highly creative and innovative groups, and with this collaboration we truly believe we can hit new heights for the next era of racing entertainment.\"\n\n*Electronic Arts (EA) is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. The Company develops and delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, mobile devices and personal computers."
