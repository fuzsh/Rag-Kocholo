        "text": "Run by the University of Melbourne, in partnership with the Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative (VLSCI), the half-day contest on 9 April saw teams from a number of schools and colleges competing to master six programming challenges in two hours. Internet access was banned, and competitors were compelled to rely solely on their programming expertise.\n\nAfter attempting to solve the given problems, the teams convened in one of the University’s lecture theatres to learn how a professor would approach each task and look at various solutions.\n\nThe winning teams in both the junior and senior categories were then presented with prizes.\n\nThree Foundation Studies (FS) teams, each consisting of three students, took part in the competition. Having scored full marks, Trinity’s winning team was presented with its prize by Dr Bernard Pope from VLSCI.\n\nParticipating students from FS were Ryan Jit Ming Tan, Yi Siu Maria Choo, Claudia Sim, Linus Peng, Mark Jiang, Siris Wang, Zijun Chen, Robin Liu and Michael Xu, the final three making up the first place team.\n\nTrinity warmly congratulates all students who took part for representing Trinity College Foundation Studies to such a high standard."
