My name is Patxi PelÃ¡ez and I work as Character Designer and Visual Development.\n\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\n\nIn my student days I worked part time as a waiter in different cafes and pubs of my town.I even worked on the beach putting drinksâ€¦ sounds fun, but it was a shit.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you’re proud to have been a part of?\n\nI have worked as character designer for feature films and TV series, as illustrator and comic artist, 2D animator and story boarder,here in Spain. I am not particularly proud of either. I always hope that the next project will be better than previous, and to do my job better. Â Anyway, I’m happy with the different children’s books I’ve illustrated. It was fun to make them, it is very gratifying to work for children.\n\nHow did you become interested in animation?\n\nAs a child, my favorite pastimes was the comics and animation series on TV.

I am currently seeking character and background design work.\n\nWhat are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation?\n\nBefore working in animation I hosted at a seafood restaurant, was a cashier at my college campus bookstore, and one summer I did manual labor landscape work to â€œbuild characterâ€ as my parents said.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you’re proud to have been a part of?Â\n\nI had the great pleasure to work on the new Spongebob movie that came out a couple months ago. It was such a huge project, and I was completely overwhelmed. The work itself was really challenging, and it definitely pushed me, which I was grateful for. Most recently I was character and prop designer for a Comedy Central pilot, which was a lot of fun because it was a super small team of us, and it was all new. I really enjoyed being at the beginning of a project, helping set the style and look of the characters and props, as well as setting them all up in flash. It was cool to see it all start to come together. I have yet to see the fully finished pilot since I was there for the first half of production, but I still loved being apart of the small hectic group.\n\nWhere are you from and how did you get into the animation business?\n\nI am from Marin County, which is north of San Francisco and south of wine country. Itâ€™s a pretty, but kind of boring suburb in the bay area. I went to a small high school in San Francisco, so I was able to hang out in more exciting places.

When I was young I used to work in a gift company testing pens like an assembling line, checking the ink and testing on a paper. I used to test more than 1000 pens per day, It was really exaustive and boring hahahahah.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you’re proud to have been a part of?\n\nAll these shows are from Brazil, so probably many people from other countries don’t knowÂ Fudencio e Seus Amigos season 6 – MTV Brazil (2009 Â Popota – pilot (2010)Â Gui e Estopa season 3 (2011-2012)\n\nWhere are you from and how did you get into the animation business?\n\nI’m from SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil), I always breathed animation since my childhood.

But in the end, I think I learned somethingÂ from each one of them.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you’re proud to have been a part of?\n\nThatâ€™s hard â€” but I really enjoyed working onÂ the pilot episodes ofÂ â€˜Popotaâ€™ andÂ â€˜CheeseÂ Gangâ€™ TV series.

There were some crazy managers who would do things like chase shoplifters out of the store with a broomstick. You encounter a lot of interesting people when working in retail.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite projects you’re proud to have been a part of?\n\nBeing a freelancer has given me the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects. Iâ€™m working with some friends on a short film called â€œAsylumâ€. Its been a fun process and Iâ€™ve learned a lot through it. I also had a great time while working temporarily at DisneyToons. I donâ€™t know if my sequence will make it through to production, but it was extremely fun to work on! And my other favorite would be my first animatic I created and designed with Epipheo for Crowd Equity. It turned out really neat and I enjoyed working on it a lot.\n\nWhere are you from and how did you get into the animation business?\n\nI was born and raised in Jacksonville, FL.
