        "text": "Notes\n\nEstablished by brothers David & Richard Darling and their father Jim in October 1986 after a year of writing games for Mastertronic. Prior to that, the Darling brothers had written VIC-20 games as Galactic Software while at school. Code Masters published on the ''pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap'' principle in their formative years, aiming to sell lots of titles, all at budget impulse buy prices. An extraordinary high profile PR campaign in 1988/89 by West End consultants Lynne Franks shone the spotlight on the Darling brothers nationally in both TV and print media, making them one of the very few programming ''celebrities'' at the time. Code Masters' first published title was BMX SIMULATOR (all formats) and, as of March 1990, it was still their best ever seller."
