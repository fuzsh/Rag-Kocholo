The closure of the Guildford studio means we're not likely to see any more shooters from Codemasters in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe studio closure has affected 66 members of staff, who \"are now involved in a consultation period.\" The Codemasters statement says that employees at Guildford \"will be encouraged to apply for suitable positions on campus and in the Birmingham studio,\" where Codemasters plan to form another team to start work on a new racing title.\n\n\"As Codemasters looks to take greater leadership in the racing category, the company is proposing a studio structure that adds resource and strengthens our best-in-class racing teams.\" reads the statement. \"The output from the studios on the Warwickshire campus and in Birmingham is on the increase.\""
