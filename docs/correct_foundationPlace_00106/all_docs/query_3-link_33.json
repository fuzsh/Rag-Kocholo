        "text": "What they could do, and have indeed done is introduce us to a bunch of major car and track licensors - itâ€™s up to us now to make the numbers work and develop a relationship with these companies. Some licenses are already in the bag, some are in progress and some will depend on how the game performs financially after release to become reality.\n\nIt will sell well, giving a look around AMS2 is the big game people was looking for, there are some concerns due to PC2 bad reputation but who loved it and who loves your work (and knows will perform different from PC2) will take care of spreading the love for AMS2\n\nNow...talking of licenses...you should aim for Panoz cars too, quite esotic cars and fitting the AMS2 mood, specially if you are looking for a GT4 car to fight the Ginetta one\n\nMaybe you will have an input in next F1 game. I mean, if codies has a braincell it wpuld be logical tp gt the company that makes the best Formula cars in sim racing helping them out.\n\nWhat are you on about? I find reiza formula cars easier to drive as they have actual aero forces modelled and that makes braking much easier. Also, if those 12 year old's are fast in F1 games, chances are they will be fast in AMS. Lots of overlap in both titles.\n\nIt goes even further in my opinion...titles with a less deep physics model are a perfect foundation, to create a good racer and lapper in my opinion. You can focus more on essential things first, before caring more about setup, target times (even F1 has this feature, pretty well done) and own strategy, without assisting and pushing limits violently and so on...it takes you by the hand more and leads to some awesome results (i experienced similar things with a Codemasters game, too...DTM/TOCA Racedriver 2)\n\nF1 is a game for the mass market, but not shallow anymore, by any means!\n\nSometimes it was happening with me as well, during testing bulk sms service. When mobile provider sent us some messages via it's bulk sms program, we understood that sms group message can help any company to grow up, if only you would know how to handle with technical issues, and maybe if you will know where to get some great psychological tricks as well.\n\nIt will sell well.But if they fall short it's gonna get crazy.Look what happend with ACC 1.0 after all that time in EA wasn't until a month ago game feels great now.But that burned alot of people man.\n\nAMS2 is high on people's list i'm treading very very carefully,Even though i backed them was because of AMS1,Few alarm bell's started pinging when i jumped in pcar's 2 the other day after watching a few of Ams2 video's.But we'll see when game fullyed released next year\n\nThat's fine if you hate the companies, but the Madness engine itself, it has such huge (unfulfilled so far unfortunately) potential... instead of being worried, I think it's better to just hope that the Reiza guys will just make it justice!"
