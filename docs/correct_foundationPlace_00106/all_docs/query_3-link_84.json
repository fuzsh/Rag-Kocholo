        "text": "This week, the world’s best golfers are descending on Augusta, Georgia for the 83rd edition of the Masters golf tournament. Augusta National Golf Club is famous for more than green jackets and pimento cheese sandwiches—legend has it that it’s the impetus for one of the taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. code’s many exemptions.\n\nSection 280(A) of the Internal Revenue Code outlines the tax treatment of residential property. In general, the imputed rent from owning a primary residence is not taxable and home-ownership expenses are not deductible, except for mortgage interest and real estate taxAn estate tax is imposed on the net value of an individual’s taxable estate, after any exclusions or credits, at the time of death. The tax is paid by the estate itself before assets are distributed to heirs. es, with limitations. Conversely, owners of rental real estate must include rental income in their income calculations, but they can deduct ownership expenses to reduce their taxable incomeTaxable income is the amount of income subject to tax, after deductions and exemptions. For both individuals and corporations, taxable income differs from—and is less than—gross income. .\n\nSection 280(A)(g) provides an exemption, however. The provision states that “if a dwelling unit is used during the taxable year by the taxpayer as a residence and such dwelling unit is actually rented for less than 15 days during the taxable year, then…the income derived from such use for the taxable year shall not be included in the gross incomeFor individuals, gross income is the total pre-tax earnings from wages, tips, investments, interest, and other forms of income and is also referred to as “gross pay.” For businesses, gross income is total revenue minus cost of goods sold and is also known as “gross profit” or “gross margin.” .” In other words, if a property is rented out for 14 days or less in a year, the income is not taxable, a large caveat.\n\nBut what does that have to do with the Masters tournament?\n\nThe story goes that when Congress debated the taxation of rental income in the 1970s and which deductions should be allowed, the well-to-do residents of Augusta, Georgia lobbied to have this exemption added. They previously had been allowed to collect the rent tax-free, and they wanted that treatment to continue. As the story goes, they succeeded, keeping their tax break.\n\nResidents of Augusta are famous for renting out their properties for the tournament and leaving town for a spring vacation. The price of rentals in Augusta for the Masters makes this a profitable enterprise for owners of real estate close to one of the world’s most famous golf courses. According to the Masters Housing Bureau, a suggested rental price for a five-bedroom house close to the golf course is $9,000-$11,000 for the week. Eight- to 10-bedroom houses can go for as much as $25,000 for the week.\n\nThese prices make Section 280(A)(g) a generous tax savings. At a 37 percent top marginal tax rateThe marginal tax rate is the amount of additional tax paid for every additional dollar earned as income. The average tax rate is the total tax paid divided by total income earned. A 10 percent marginal tax rate means that 10 cents of every next dollar earned would be taken as tax. for the federal government, an individual with $25,000 in rental income avoids a more than $9,000 tax bill.\n\nThis week when you watch Rory McIlory, Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson, and others battle it out in Amen Corner, remember that Bobby Jones’s course is home to more than just blooming azaleas: it’s home to one of the tax code’s many tax breaks.\n\nStay informed on the tax policies impacting you.\n\nSubscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nShare"
