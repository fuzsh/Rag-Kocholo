        "text": "read again! The age rating determine how far they can go with sim or lack off it! Mostly children play f1 now as the arcady feel sells to the masses as sanctioned by governing bodies.. It will never be a proper racer where skill tactics and race craft come into it\n\nYou keep saying over and over that F1 games are only for little children, but I don't see any proof of your claims. Also, it may not be a realistic simulation (which it was never meant to be), but tactics and race craft absolutely do come into play.\n\nAs far as your odd assumption that age classification on games has anything at all to do with realism or difficulty, you are just plain wrong. I own Project CARS, Driveclub, F1 2015 and The Crew. Guess which one is PG... The Crew... the least realistic one. The other three are all G rated. In fact, all racing sims are G rated. The easiest game I own, regardless of genre, is The Order 1886, and that is rated R18+.\n\nFrom the videos I like F1 2015 presentation. I actually like playing as a F1 driver instead of creating your own player. I would like to have full race commentary and very little or no voice from pitwall. The Commentary can give enough info about the lead cars and talk about the players perspective. Like when I am suppose to pit, who is in pits. My team mate etc ... and TV style presentation please.\n\nGameplay, simulation wise I think CM do a decent job. I have played 2012 and 2013 with controller only. Like F1 2012 from gameplay to menu etc. Menu are much slower in 2013. Not sure how many years contact CM is having or who could be potential competitor for the license. I doubt CM F1 game reach 5million mark\n\nAlso EA F1 Challenge 99-02 which has 4 seasons all in one, combined with ISI's engine that would become the base of rFactor, and the most detailed telemetry for a game that isn't MoTeC linked.\n\nThis is just 1 page out of 15 or so.\n\nI played this game many years ago with a normal laptop keyboard, and I never felt the sim physics too demanding once you turn on TCS. F1 cars have so much grip even sim physics are effectively noob proof. You don't need to make it any more arcady like Codemasters.\n\nI never played Geoff Crammond's games, but I heard they are excellent too. Oh, and don't forget GPL either, which to this day still has a cult following and mods coming out every once in a while.\n\nKeeping in mind all the above games, it's safe to say that Codies' efforts have not been advancing the franchise much beyond the presentation department (which is pretty, but let's face it, it's not essential to the driving and gameplay).\n\nF1 challenge was PC only and GPL isn't really a comparison that can be made.\n\ndon't understand you m8. Your missing the point completely! You have obviously bought into theF1 2015. Hype and bull.. Course it's made for children.. It's a game that's supposed to be accessible all ages up! Jeese man. Lol.. Mike_grpA..\n\nIt's not me who has trouble comprehending the way games are classified buddy. Why would an F1 game be made for children? You do realise the vast majority of F1 fans are adults right? Children are more into mario kart type games, which was the point of that F1 track stars game (was that the name of it?).\n\nA game that is classified as G for all ages just means there's no offensive content that children shouldn't see. It has nothing to do with how hard or realistic the game is. I actually explained that already, and you either didn't understand, or you're purposely ignoring it to try and troll the forum.\n\nThe easiest (and most unrealistic) game I own is rated R18+. The most realistic racing sim I own (pcars) is rated G all ages. How is it you don't comprehend this?\n\nF1 challenge was PC only and GPL isn't really a comparison that can be made.\n\nThe point I was trying to make is, 10 years ago with inferior hardware other developers have made F1 games that are more complete and more satisfying to play, even by today's standards (graphics notwithstanding). All Codemasters need to do is look back and implement most of the same things, improve graphics and add their beautiful menu presentation, and we've got a perfect game. Instead they keep bumbling around for 5 years (6 if you count the 2009 Wii version) with the same formula, not advancing the franchise at all. Which brings us back to the thread question: Would I want somebody else to take a shot at the license? Absolutely.\n\nOn the basis of what, exactly? Let's look at the facts:\n\n- No official overlay graphics\n\n- No commentary\n\n- No interviews (removed for who knows what reason)\n\n- No safety car (I don't care how infrequently it was issued in the previous games, it's a staple of the season and more importantly it's an officially licensed game)\n\n- No formation lap\n\nTake a look at this:\n\nNow I defy you to find anything in F1 2010-2015 that isn't a PC mod that has the same level of presentation as just the first six seconds (after the MGTV intro) of this video. F1:CE has a presence about it that every CM F1 game lacks, there's simply nothing to disagree upon regarding that.\n\nI really did think F1CE was a great game, despite a lot of people suggesting it was purely a demonstration of the PS3s graphical capabilities.\n\nI still think F1 2015 is the best F1 game to date though, even without the immersion (interviews, championship etc.). F1 2016 had better be damn good though...\n\nF1:CE was a great game when it came out on ps3, and had really nice graphics for it's time too. What I don't agree with is that it has better physics than the codies games. I bought a second hand copy of it for ps3, when F1 2013 was new (I had CE when it was new, but sold it). I started a career on it, and as soon as I hit the track I started remembering why I sold it. It was great in it's day, but the physics are really poor. It's ridiculously easy. Since F1 2012, the Codies games have been light years ahead of CE. Only missing some of the nice little bits CE had, like the official overlay, comentary (although in CE it was repetitive and annoying, and felt fake as hell), and the warm up lap and podium. I am glad they got rid of the stupid interviews in the Codies games though, they were so repetitive, it didn't seem even remotely real lol.\n\nI don't think Codies' games are perfect, far from in fact. I do however think they're doing a great job with 2015. Official F1 games just won't be realistic these days, as they want the games to target a wider audience than sim racers. I think the Codies games have gotten better and better, and I think next year's title will be by far the best in the series.\n\nWith that said, I think @LeGeNd-1 has a great idea there. I would also like to see the licence for F1 cars, old and new, to be sold to some of the sim studios. I like having the official game, but a yearly release game is never going to have deep physics. If SMS made the official game, we'd only get one every 5 or 6 years. So I think it'd be great if they could just buy the licence for certain years of F1 cars to include in their current sim. Same goes for the PC sim studios, although you can already get F1 mods for PC sims.\n\nAgree with all of the above. For what it is (officially licenced game, updated yearly, appeals to a wide audience), Codemasters are doing a great job\n\nThat was the last F1 game i bought iirc. So here is a question, If a dev held (or will) the licence for so long, Why in that time dont they at least make a more sim based version at least once? It would keep the more serious players happy for a few years\n\nHonestly, I've lost faith in Codemaster's ability in making realistic driving games.\n\nThe TOCA Race Driver was such a wonderful era; they could have built on that, but instead, they wanted to compete with the rest of the pack and join the casual racing market.\n\nG.Autosport was a disappointment, as they touted that as an authentic motorsport game... the engine sounds were hit and miss, and the physics were not exactly what I'd call realistic, though far better than their previous GRID games.\n\nDIRT 2 and 3 are two games that are really really good for some reason... alive with atmosphere, visuals and OMG those engine sounds... !\n\nOn the subject of F1, I want it to be as close to the real thing as possible. Given the current state of affairs in F1, even if any developer manages to make a really good F1 game that does justice to the racing discipline, I will not be getting it... largely due to how they've changed F1 cars, particularly the sound. Yes... the sound is a major factor... and I do not want to drive a stupid-fast open wheel car that sounds like a blender on roids.\n\nThe F1 sport and the games that came as a result were the best between the 90s and 2005 probably.\n\nOn DIRT, that's one Codemasters game I will continue to buy even if it doesn't lean towards sim (though I very badly want it to), because the game is just that damn good - D2 and 3.\n\nThe WRC games are about as bland as the F1 games... in fact, last good WRC game I played was on the PS2: WRC 2. Twitchy control, but once tamed, a game that really came into its own. Sebestial Loeb rally is on the Horizon though for some reason, I'm most excited about the next Dirt game, not F1 or any other rally game.\n\nHonestly, I've lost faith in Codemaster's ability in making realistic driving games.\n\nThe TOCA Race Driver was such a wonderful era; they could have built on that, but instead, they wanted to compete with the rest of the pack and join the casual racing market.\n\nG.Autosport was a disappointment, as they touted that as an authentic motorsport game... the engine sounds were hit and miss, and the physics were not exactly what I'd call realistic, though far better than their previous GRID games.\n\nDIRT 2 and 3 are two games that are really really good for some reason... alive with atmosphere, visuals and OMG those engine sounds... !\n\nOn the subject of F1, I want it to be as close to the real thing as possible.

Dirt rally and F1 2015 are great games."
