        "text": "F1 2020 developer Codemasters has announced DLC in honor of former Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher. The Keep Fighting Foundation DLC will be released today on PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Google Stadia, and will include a car livery, podium emote, helmet, gloves, suit and badge. All proceeds from sales of the DLC will go towards The Keep Fighting Foundation.\n\n\"It was an honor for the studio to focus on Michael's record-breaking F1 career for the F1 2020 Deluxe Schumacher Edition,\" said F1 Franchise Game Director at Codemasters, Lee Mather, in a press statement. \"We are equally proud to support the Keep Fighting Foundation. Many of our players regard Michael as the greatest of all time, and we know the exclusive items will prove incredibly popular.\"\n\nF1 2020 also has a Schumacher Edition that can be purchased separately, which features four bonus cars to use in races and extra liveries that can be applied to vehicles in multiplayer events. Considered to be one of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time, Schumacher still holds the record for the most World Championship wins.\n\nMercedes driver Lewis Hamilton recently equaled Schumacher's all-time record of 155 podium finishes at the Silverstone 70th Anniversary Grand Prix, and is on the verge of matching Schumacher's World Championships wins.\n\nHaving retired from Formula 1 in 2006, Schumacher briefly returned for to the track from 2010 to 2012. In 2013, Schumacher suffered a head injury during a skiing accident and has been in treatment ever since."
