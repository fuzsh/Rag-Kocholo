01/12/2023\n\nLife is a perpetual renewal just like the SimHub development is … For the next updates I will give some focus on ShakeIt, lot of new lessons and new internal tooling are allowing me to go deeper in the data and understand better some of the subtilities of the simulators, and I plan to take benefit of this new knowledge to improve the existing effects 😉 To be followed 😉\n\nGeneral\n\nFeat : Added local velocity extraction to many games\n\nFeat : Added basic defender folder access protection detection to help with game configuration troubleshooting\n\nFeat : Updated

loss” shakeit effect (similar to the motion effect), games like IRacing were containing this component in the slip effect, it’s now separate for more control.\n\nFeat : Added “Landing” effect support for ea wrc (and reworked it for dirt rally 1/2)\n\nFeat : Added some informations messages in the effects when the effects are not supported or the game does not provide accurate informations (primarily slip data)\n\nFeat : The “traction loss” component is removed from the RPM vs speed slip detection algorythm (IRACING)\n\nFixed suspension velocity “weirdness” on codemasters games.\n\nFeat : added gear grinding info and effect to BeamNg\n\nFeat : “Jump” detection to suspens slip effect in Dirt rally 1/2, EA WRC\n\nNCALC/JS\n\nFeat : added two new function maptwocolors and mapthreecolors allowing to include the same computations as the color binding in a formula\n\nDevices\n\nFix : Leds computations were done even if the device was not connected.\n\nFix : Removed toggle switches color control for the Cubecontrols GTPro v2 which are causing display artefects (wrong colors …) on other leds.\n\nFeat : Added Printed Sim Racing GT5.0 Elite Dashboard support\n\nFeat : Added symProject GearUp device support\n\nFeat : Added SimRep P9XX device support\n\n9.1.12 – 16/11/2023\n\nFix : Improve EA WRC end of stage detection (even if still perfectible due to lack of data)\n\nFeat : Add EA WRC stage names and more car names\n\nFeat : Add support for Racing Fuel Academy devices\n\nFeat : Update Soelped XR-5 default profile.\n\nFeat : Extracted Forza turbo data\n\nFix : F123 – F12018 read

11/11/2023\n\nFix : Axis swap was not taken into account on Simagic P1000 inverted.\n\nFix : New “only when pressed” option on P1000 and TB-RS was always active.\n\nFeat : More complete car names (Adding brand) for WRC 23\n\n9.1.10 – 10/11/2023\n\nFeat : Add EA WRC car names\n\nFeat : Added TrackPositionMeters computed property\n\nFix : yaw/pîtc/roll/ local velocity were not fed when using a simhub replay.\n\nFix : Improved govee light detection/reconnect speed and reliability\n\nFix : Loading dashboards with embedded video was failing.\n\n9.1.9 – 09/11/2023\n\nEA WRC PC UDP Telemetry support (Warning final lap times, and stage end are wrong, I’m still looking for a workaround if somehow it’s possible)\n\nFix : Iracing oil pressure conversion issue\n\nFeat : Simagic TB-RS haptic motors support\n\nFeat : Added RBR wheel speed allowing to compute more shake it effects\n\nFeat : RBR : Faking telemetry during intro to make game show as connected earlier\n\nFix : Dynamic added repetitions sometimes not in sync on the HTML render engine\n\nFeat : Make usb devices update asynchronous (to reduce faulty devices impact on others)\n\nFix : F123 event deserialization during simhub replays fix\n\nFix : custom launcher path : Deduce working directory from exe path\n\nFeat : Added DashStudio group content auto arangement/alignement\n\nFeat : Added direct structured game rawdata object access to JS engine.\n\nFeat : updated some devices default profiles\n\n9.1.7 – 9.1.8 – 02/11/2023\n\nWRC 23\n\nAdded support for Motion4All telemetry patch https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/wrc-telemetry-patch.38991/ , it’s very basic, but gives some life 😉\n\nIt has been tested successfully only on steam version ! Hopefully, this is only a temporary way and Codemasters will release true telemetry soon.\n\nGames data\n\nAdded FM23 car names (thanks to forzurda )\n\nMisc\n\nClear Adalight at exit/disabling\n\nBelt tensioner profiles support\n\nGT7 compatibility for the new “spin and lock” effect\n\nDevices support\n\nAdded support for PSE DD-X, DD-R, GPX+ (Vocore based refresh)\n\nAdd raw

no telemetry is available yet, however there is still hope : it’s announced to be available in a “future” patch.\n\nDash studio\n\nLot of work have been done on DashStudio on this version : lot of optimizations and rewrites to unleash various new design possibilities, the following condensed list does not reflect the massive amount of internal reworks 🙂\n\nRepetitions :\n\nBindable layer repetitions\n\nRepetitions are now showing as “1” by default, 0 hides the whole layer (this makes it more coherent with the actual use, set it to “15” to have 15 lines overall.\n\nRepetitions “offsets” can now be bound\n\nIt’s now possible to get nested repeatindexes using repeatindex(depth) function (allowing some nested rows/columns disposition for instance).\n\nMake repeatindex available to widgets variables\n\nGroups\n\nAdd dashstudio “groups”, and shortcut to create groups (Ctrl + shift + G)\n\nNew dashstudio items get’s added to the current group/layer\n\nDashstudio Buttons can now host components (like a group)\n\nComponents tree now always show the group expander if the item is a container (group, layer, button at this date), group expander will be grayed and

a “magic” header to BeamNg telemetry mod to push away “parasite data” (like routers sending unwanted data on 9999 UDP port)\n\nCar included in ahead/behind are now configurable in SimHub settings (Trackonly, track + pitlane, track + pitlane + pits)\n\nAdded class colors settings in Car Settings > Car class colours (Iracing will always use the game provided colours)\n\nAdded track map class colouring (enabled by default, you can opt out from it in the map properties)\n\nOptimized ncalc function “readtextfile” to poll file for changes only every 2 seconds maximum\n\nAdded new Javascript “run once” section to formulas to allow declaring settings, constants and helper functions only once in order to save significant performances on dash repeating a lot of time the same routines (IE

screen” dash windows management with a complete rewriting of that part , and ended to affect all aspects of dash management … desktop, web, overlays, usb screens …. as well as many little (but significant 😉 ) changes along the road.\n\nTake a deep breath …. here comes the “condensed” changelog of almost 5 months of work !\n\nDashstudio Desktop\n\nUnlimited dashboard saved locations\n\nIt can be a monitor, a predefined windowed location, or simply the last location.\n\nSaved locations creates a “device” offering a similar “all in one” experience as other usb devices\n\nVarious “Start mode” (At simhub startup, at game process start, at game connected or even manual).\n\nIndividual controls for each location (next screen, previous etc …).\n\nControls to open/close the dash.\n\nWhen opening on a location from the dash list the dash will replace the previously displayed one.\n\nIf the dash is configured to be displayed on a specific monitor it will automatically close/open depending if the monitor is available.\n\nDash Playlist management\n\nAbility to choose precisely the next/previous dash content :\n\n– All dashboards\n\n– Favourite dashboards\n\n– Specific playlist\n\nAdded explicit per game default dash/idle dash reloading\n\nIt’s now possible to assign car specific playlists.\n\nBetter handling of “transparency” for dashboards (it will automatically detect if transparency is available in the design and remember the last state).\n\nBetter handling of dashboards previous/next actions : they will now take care of switching automatically to the last saved rendering engine and transparency settings)\n\nReplaced the desktop HTML Rendering engine from CefSharp to Microsoft WebView 2.\n\nUpdated CefSharp to the latest version (Still Used by USB displays and webpage component in WPF rendering engine)\n\nHtml engine rendering rate is now separately configurable depending of the usage : desktop or browser\n\nIt’s now possible to choose the default rendering engine globally (HTML or WPF)\n\nDashboards resizing can now be done in a more window standard way by grabbing any side\n\nWorkarounds for monitor resolution changes, when in full screen if the dash is pushed away from the monitor (IE : during primary monitor resolution change), the dash will recover its intended screen automatically.\n\nScalable dash UI : Buttons and title bar can be scaled up or down\n\nBetter monitor identification (a kind of mix of monitor name, windows id, serial number, eeid informations ….) allowing to more consistently keep track of a unique monitor\n\nWorkaround for windows taskbar sometimes losing track of fullscreen windows and sometimes covering a dash.\n\nDashstudio USB devices (Vocore, usbd480 …)\n\nAdded dithering algorithm\n\nUpdated support to add the new dash playlist management system (see above)\n\nDashstudio WEB (Mobile, browser ….)\n\nIt’s now possible to create a mobile device “slot” with complete remote control giving a similar experience and control as an usb device\n\nAutomatic dashs changes\n\nPer car playlist management\n\nForce landscape support\n\nMirror support (for aftermarket phone Hud mirrors)\n\nEasier controls assignment (one slot => one set of controls)\n\nList of connected devices to the “slot”\n\nDashstudio Overlays\n\nReworked the “overlay editor” to get it more friendly\n\nAdded overlay edition control\n\nAdded overlay close control\n\nAdded semi transparent background during overlay edition to make it easier to locate parts\n\nOverlay layout control window is now only “Top most” when focused allowing to bo above the overlays when used, but behind the game and overlays when not focused.\n\nOverlay layouts auto start :\n\nIt’s now possible to choose a global default overlay layout or a specific one for each game\n\nAutostart can now occur right at start/game change, or can be deferred to game start\n\nMultiple deferred auto start behaviours available (Only start once, start every time, start and close automatically\n\nDashstudio Editor\n\nAdded video (webm) component (this might not work on IOS where “autoplay” is messy)…\n\nGames\n\nAdded eXpansim support\n\nAdded volvo the game support\n\nAdded RDS – The Official Drift Videogame support\n\nCompletely took back from the ground BeamNg support with a dedicated telemetry mod providing significantly more data than the combination of official OutGauge/Motionsim outputs.\n\nUpdated game “start options” to add “VR” (SteamVR) /”OtherVR” (Oculus) options for games supporting it (for steam).\n\nDevices\n\nSince a saved dashboard can now be used as a “device” any HDMI screen can benefit from it :\n\nAdded a new standard device : standard leds + hdmi screen\n\nUpdated the DDU10 device to offer dash control (it needs to be deleted/added back).\n\nRemoved the now obsolete “load legacy settings” option when adding devices.\n\nAdded support for Chimaera Racing CR-5 Pro\n\nAdded support for SimCore STD98\n\nUpdated default soelpec default device profiles\n\nBelt tensioner\n\nUI styling changes\n\nAdded pitch/roll acceleration effects\n\nExpanded smoothing ranges\n\nSplitted Gain and Max actuator travel for better flexibility\n\nAdded a connection status indicator\n\nAdded a button to test that max travel is not losing steps\n\nAdded a recalibrate button and action\n\nOther\n\nThanks to the lessons learned during the dash window rewrite a workaround for the extremely annoying NV surround behaviours has been added (Shaking window during maximizing, taskbar position randomly taken into account …). The window will resize itself to the correct location instead of letting the system (and nvidia) do it avoiding the Nvidia surround “approximate” behaviors. (Added to the simhub main window as well as the dash studio editor.\n\nSince administrator rights are no longer mandatory in most of the “normal” uses cases,\n\nSimHub won’t prompt anymore for administrator rights at first start\n\nGame setup will use an external “elevated” process, time to install the plugins/make required config files changes instead of requiring whole simHub privileges elevation.\n\nSimHub will check for game process elevation and alert in case the game runs in higher privileges.\n\nMore homogeneous styling of game alerts (manual configuration,auto configuration, udp conflits, admin rights)\n\nReworked Tab control styling (it clearly had a “visibility” issue)\n\nAdded an option to the installer to install/update the default dashs/overlays\n\nA new welcome screen will ask for your preferred units at the first Simhub start\n\nNotes\n\nKnown plugins requiring an update :\n\nleoxz plugin won’t work with v9 version (SimBridge 1.4.1 at the time of this writing) until it gets updated (due to the CEFSharp upgrade)\n\nAndroid app has been updated :\n\nExisting Android App must be uninstalled before installing the new one, to download it simply open the dash list from the mobile browser and download it from here.\n\nAre you still here ? 🙂\n\nThanks to everyone who have been providing ideas, feedbacks or encouragements along this very long road !\n\n8.4.11 – 18/08/2023\n\nFixed GPbike support broken by Beta21 structures changes\n\nFixed BeamNg automatic configuration\n\nAdded support for multiple FN buttons in the control mapper plugin\n\nAdded support for “press and hold” in the web control mapper mapping assistant.\n\nAdded support for AlphaTecRacing Dashboard GT3\n\nAdded joystick “buffered data” reading (in both joystick and control mapper plugin) allowing to catch insanely shortly timed button presses sometimes occurring on encoders.\n\nAdded a “forget device” confirmation prompt in the arduino settings\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.4.10 – 04/08/2023\n\nFix : 3Drap VOTA buttons physical ordering\n\nNew : Simutec SDU3 support\n\nFix : Windows location on startup was wrong on a screen with scaling > 100%\n\nFix : Serial number on leds device was still taken into account when the option was unchecked but a serial was already picked.\n\n8.4.9 – 02/08/2023\n\nAdded Experimental support Drift21 support\n\nAdded support for BavarianSimTec Omega Pro\n\nAdded support for 3DRap Vota\n\nAdded support for multiple leds devices of a kind for the standard protocol using unique serial number (documentation and sample code to be updated soon)\n\nAdded support for GRID brows extensions (up to 4 modules)\n\nAdded support for incoming GRID leds devices firmware with unique serial number (DDU10/5) allowing multiple device support.\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.4.7 – 8.4.8 – 06/07/2023\n\nLibUSB upgrade (Vocore, AX206) , this seems to solve screen not detected issues on some systems.\n\nAdded support for GSI X29\n\nAdded support for some Reiza Studios “oldies” (rfactor 1 based) :\n\nCopa Petrobras de Marcas\n\nFormula truck 2013\n\nFix for a crash suspending telemetry in iracing when still in the menus.\n\n8.4.6 – 01/07/2023\n\nGap computation\n\nAdded a setting to SimHub gap compuration algorythm choice : Micro sectors vs Distance to time (legacy), default is legacy Distance to time.\n\nSmoothed micro sectors computation\n\nMicro sectors computation is now working on replays\n\nFix : Reading the sound input status could lead to a dead lock.\n\nFix : Static map render in HTML (mobile, usb displays) will now render the player on top (like the desktop engine)\n\nAdded ShakeIt information messages when there are no effects and/or no outputs configured.\n\n8.4.4 – 8.4.5 – 27/06/2023\n\nAdded dashboard variables (reusable variables at dashboard level which can be transmited to child widgets)\n\nAdded new dashstudio images tool window\n\nAdded dashboard local javascript extensions (so extensions can be exported/imported with the dashboard)\n\nAdded Drag’n’drop support for rpms segments (led editor)\n\nAdded shortname (F.

Games uses many different computations/estimations which can’t be reproduced exactly unless the game provides directly in telemetry the shown values.\n\nNB : When games gives those values, this computation is overriden by the game reported values.\n\nRelative gap (ahead/behind on track) now uses the previously mentionned “micro sector approach”\n\nWorkaround for invalid ACC opponents data when they are crossing start line (Completed laps + Spline position inconsistencies) messing the leaderbaord order\n\nAdded support for Zen’s Simwheels Uniflex-Elite\n\nReworked F123 RaceControlDRSEnabled raw property to reflect the three states (no information sent = null, enabled = true, disabled = false)\n\nF123 : Added red flag status reset when the start lights are starting.\n\nNew : ACC, Use temperatures (air, road) from Braodcasting API when not availalble from shared memory telemetry\n\n8.4.5 Hotfix :\n\nRemoved some now useless constraints before ahead/behind data were made available\n\nFix for the BestLapOpponentSameClassPosition not giving the correct value\n\n8.4.2 – 8.4.3 – 16/06/2023\n\nF1 23 : updated teams names from the latest F123 specifications.\n\nF1 23 : extracted Tyresetdata\n\nNCALC/JS engine : added bestsectortime function\n\n8.4.3 HOTFIX : Fixed automatic game detection only working once\n\n8.4.1 – 13/06/2023 – Hotfix\n\nFix : F1 23 reading could crash when reading the new tire set data, the data has been removed time to get a better understanding of how it works.\n\n8.4.0 – 12/06/2023\n\nAdded initial support for F1 23 (Thanks for everyone who helped to add it during the beta phase)\n\nImproved Fake CH340 chips detection and added automatic driver fix prompt when the required conditions are met (fake ch340G with latest driver)\n\nImproved serial port device name detection for HID devices (it will show the USB descriptor device name instead of a generic Serial port name), available in both simhub and setup tool.\n\nImproved package manager (Arduino, drivers …) cancel handling.\n\nNew devices added :\n\nGRID DDU5 native support (needs an incoming firmware update)\n\nGRID DDU10 leds native support (needs an incoming firmware update)\n\nPrecision Sim Engineering PSP support\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.3.13 – 29/05/2023\n\nAdded new ACC Mclaren 720s gt3 evo brake bias correction\n\nAdded Fanatec pedals rumble data stream timeout to avoid getting SimHub getting stuck in case of hardware/usb issue.\n\n8.3.12 – 25/05/2023\n\nSince a recent driver update delivered through windows update, some counterfeit CH340G won’t work correctly (used on some Arduino clones) : Added warnings about these chips issues and links to help diagnose it. Those messages will appear when:\n\nA CH340G based serial port is selected in the Arduino Setup tool\n\nA CH340G based serial port has been scanned without success in SimHub (unrecognised)\n\nFixed : Dash studio Z-order menu wrong labels.\n\nFixed : On Dash studio button component the simulated keys property was readonly.\n\nNB : Overall it’s not possible to detect automatically if a CH340G chip is genuine, those messages are purely informative and shown for any CH340G chip to help you troubleshoot issues if unfortunately you are victim of a fake CH340G chip.\n\nMore information about counterfeit CH340G : https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Arduino—Counterfeit-Fake-CH340G-chips-driver-issues\n\n8.3.11 – 19/05/2023\n\nNew\n\nDefault wheels buttons colors changes are now visualized in real time on the device instead of being applied after validating the dialog.\n\nAdded rim model detection for the control mapper plugin for Fanatec bases (thanks to Fanatec for making it possible).\n\nIf a javascript extension is invalid SimHub will continue executing other extensions instead of rejecting the whole JS expression.\n\nAdded a search box in the “add device” dialog.\n\nFixed\n\nDashboards/designer could freeze after a game was taking/releasing fullscreen (old <=DX11 games) when running a dashboard with Dial Gauges\n\nNew RF2 plugin data were getting mixed.\n\nLogging was creating an useless empty file when starting as administrator\n\nNew devices added :\n\nAscher Racing McLaren Artura SPORT-SC\n\nAscher Racing McLaren Artura PRO-SC\n\nGRID Brows V2 (this does not cover old Grid Brows “V1” still emulating the arduino sketch).\n\nAdded support for multiple HSR fans in the ShakeIt wind plugin (Multiple fans support requires new hardware versions embedding an unique identifier)\n\nCP-S Formula (Collaboration between TwentyOne Performance, Pro-Sim and Cool Performance)\n\nReorganized Grid devices to offer simple/advanced devices profiles instead of a limited generic “Grid by simlab” profile.\n\nTechnical :\n\nUpgraded VC++ x86 2019 redistributable to VC++ 2015-2022 x86 redistributable package.\n\n8.3.10 – 08/05/2023\n\nAdded new ACC DLC cars brake-bias offsets\n\nUpdated RF2 plugin to the latest version (adding some electric data support to the rawdata), this version is the same as Crew Chief to avoid any useless conflicts.\n\nFixed controller plugin not showing all the devices when the list was too long\n\nStartup screen is now showing in taskbar.\n\nAfter USBD480 disabling / disconnecting touch is now disabled (to avoid some sticky issues with non touch versions requiring a physical power cycle to get touch disabled internally. This was causing extra bandwidth usage and display shifts on an overloaded USB port/hub and making hard to diagnose such bandwidth issues)\n\nAdded two global shortcuts (working from SimHub main window) :\n\nCTRL + L : Opens the log folder\n\nCTRL + O : Starts current game\n\nOutGauge (LFS, BeamNg) now binds to any IP instead of being restricted to 127.0.0.1 (local computer)\n\nFixed “save opened dashboards” locking simhub exit (and dash studio options saving).\n\nFixed a memory leak occurring when enabling VJoy output option in the control mapper while VJoy is not installed on the computer.\n\nChanged extension of all logging files from .log to .txt to make it easier to open.\n\nReworked the watchdog traces to make them easier to open (pure developer convenience :D)\n\nUpdated most of the SimHub libraries dependencies : Log4Net, Xceed, AvalonDock,, asp.net core, Jint (Javascript engine library) ….\n\n8.3.8 – 8.3.9 – 24/04/2023\n\nFix : Control mapper/Controllers input plugin : Reading the controller buttons/pov count could create interference with Wheel FFB, any references of it has been removed.\n\nDuring the previous bug hunt, the controllers input plugin has been mostly rewritten, as a bonus it’s now possible to control which controller simhub will connect to.\n\nFix : Dashstudio web engine would not load properly dashs and widgets with special characters in the file name.\n\nFix : In Simulight plugin it was not possible anymore to edit adalight led layout.\n\nCleanup : Another wave of unused dlls has been removed from the installer, This hopefully should be the last one thanks to an huge internal rework of Simhub dependencies management. As a result to all the recent work about installer size, it went from 240MB to 133MB, helping with download size as well as installation/update speed.\n\n8.3.9 Hotfix : dashboards with spaces/special characters names would not load on USB devices.\n\n8.3.7 – 13/04/2023\n\nFixed an issue with ATMega32U4 based arduinos not reconnecting after game switching\n\nFixed a false UDP conflict detection with ACC happening if the game was started before SimHub (The message was not affecting game data reading)\n\nSpring cleaning : Make way ! Make way !\n\nLog tab can now be disabled/enabled in SimHub settings (fresh installs will get it disabled by default, on previous installs it can be disabled in settings)\n\nAdditional plugins tab is now hidden if no plugins uses it\n\nArduino plugin settings tabs have been reordered to give priority to RGB leds and matrixes which are the most used now.\n\nRemoved some unused dlls\n\nDashstudio widgets\n\nInitial screen index can now be bound and allows to change dynamically the screen\n\nScreens roles and activation in widgets can now be enabled in the widget properties (EnableScreenRolesAndActivation)\n\nUpdated IT translation thanks to Marco G.\n\n8.3.6 – 08/04/2023\n\nEh windows I need a bit more time to shutdown all those devices !\n\nFix : Windows was randomly closing SimHub prematurely when shutting down the computer. This was occasionally not giving the required time to SimHub to close and clear properly all devices currently running (leds displays …), SimHub will now ask to windows this required extra time.\n\nIn addition Simhub actual shutdown time has been improved by closing displays in parallel instead of one at a time. (Shutdown time can vary a lot depending of the enabled devices, current tasks running etc …)\n\nReworked some logging to make it a bit easier to read the logs.\n\nFix : Preventing a plugin UI crash to block SimHub loading (a message will show instead notifying the error)\n\nFix : Shakeit advanced output settings would not get saved sometime (Suspend settings, automatic restart etc …)\n\nFix : I got a couple of reports of Simucube 2 Pro FFB not working when things were started in a specific order (at windows startup for instance) I’ve not found yet any causes or been able to reproduce it, But It could be related to the wheel detection in the new Control Mapper plugin. As a safety measure :\n\nSC2 rim detection does not run anymore when the option is not checked. Detection when enabled will start after 5s and only if Truedrive is already running to make absolutely sure to not interfer with its startup.\n\nStopped all the background routines running when the control mapper plugin is enabled but the output option is “Disabled” (which is the default out of box)\n\nAs a double safety the plugin is not enabled anymore on fresh installs (if you don’t use and it’s enabled you can disable it in SimHub settings).\n\n8.3.5 – 04/04/2023 – Hotfix\n\nFixed an issue I was tracking since a few days without success : default shake it bass shaker profile created on a fresh install were having effects not correctly initialized and were not outputting any sounds.\n\nFixed the new stream deck control mapper plugin not showing the selected input after reloading the editor : uninstall first the old plugin version using right click on the action in the stream deck software then reinstall it using simhub\n\nRemoved the new fixed TCP port (49876) for web API which seems to interfere with other services on some machines.\n\n8.3.4 – 04/04/2023\n\nReworked installer :\n\nArduino IDE is now installed on demand and not part anymore of the installer.\n\nUSB displays drivers (USBD480, Vocore, AX206) can now be installed through installer (enabled by default). As installing these drivers is a long process they won’t be installed on updates, only on first install.\n\nMost installer dependencies (vc++ etc …) are now using proper silent install switches\n\nMonster games plugin (nascar heat …) is now downloaded “on demand”, some antiviruses being picky about it and not part anymore of the installer.\n\nThe installer will now try to shutdown Simhub in a proper manner before installing.\n\nAll the above work made the installer significantly slimmer with some positives side effects : Antivirus scan after download is significantly faster, actual installation is faster\n\nControl mapper\n\nControl mapper <3 Stream deck : Added a stream deck plugin to allow triggering control mapper outputs from a stream deck device : https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Control-Mapper-plugin#stream-deck-integration\n\nControl mapper is now enabled by default on new installs.\n\nUSB Displays\n\nAll usb displays (Vocore, USBD480 …) now have a framerate limit available according to their actual capabilities\n\nImproved framerate limiting algorythm\n\nAdded contrast control\n\nFixes :\n\nFix : ShakeIt wind could go above 100% of wind speed making actual wind speed overflowing and starting back from 0 (issue primarly visible in shakeIt wind when using manual max speed)\n\nFix : Dashstudio widgets “initialscreenindex” was not taken into account on web engine (usb displays, browsers)\n\nFix : Devices not allowed to be suspended (when screen is off) would still show a suspended state (primarily visible in remote desktop mode)\n\nFix : Fixed a crash when using an USBD480 with builtin leds (SRH G-force LCD Pro) with a non led compatible device profile\n\nFix : Dashboard repetitions were not initialized when switching dashboards using actions\n\nImprovements :\n\nSerial port characteristics retrieving through WMI is now restricted to the essential properties, hopefully making simhub faster to load when a device is making WMI slow to respond.\n\nIf an application is using already the same TCP port as SimHub internal server port (Fiddler …), simhub will peek automatically a new TCP port the the session, avoiding issues with usb screens.\n\nA new fixed TCP port (49876) has been added for API interactions between apps and SimHub (avoiding some extra settings to set the current port or failure is the TCP port has been changed through the settings).\n\n8.3.3 – 26/03/2023 – Hotfix\n\nFix : Shakeit effect folders were removed from profiles while trying to automatically remove incompatible effects between bass shakers and motors.\n\nFix : Dashstudio buttons were not showing the pressed image when defined in HTML mode.\n\nFeature : Reintroduced the UDP games conflict detailed detection , the conflicting app name will now be shown again (the feature was removed as an attempt to workaround Windows defender false positive detection).\n\nThe installer will now be delivered as an exe instead of a zip file. Size variation does not justify anymore to deliver it as a zip.\n\n8.3.0 – 8.3.2 – 24/03/2023\n\nControl remapper plugin :\n\nNew “FN” virtual modifier allowing to use buttons/povs combos and virtually double the number of inputs of your controller https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Control-Mapper-plugin/#about-fn-feature\n\nAdded wheel model detection for simucube allowing to create input profiles per wheel (optional), Huge thanks to Mika from Simucube for the information making it possible\n\nReworked settings storage to be more future proof (all settings should be kept in most cases).\n\nAdded some indications when a VJoy issue is detected about :\n\nTarget VJoy not available\n\nVJoy already used by another app\n\nButton count mismatch vs the 128 recommended buttons.\n\nAmbient lights plugin :\n\nAdded support for “Razer chroma” compatible govee lights offering a wide selection of leds devices : https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Ambient-lights#govee-lights\n\nImproved UX of light devices area placement :\n\nNew placement grid\n\nArea focus to move it easily\n\nDevices area groups (for multiple leds devices)\n\nPerformances optimizations (less pixels are processed to get the average color)\n\nReworked color processing settings :\n\nLight/dark scene settings\n\nColor correction,brightness and gray level mode are now per device\n\nImproved minimum color handling to reduce blinking at low brightness\n\nFixed a few errors showing in the log during resolution/screen mode changes etc … but not affecting the normal working mode.\n\nAdded an option to turn off lights when monitor is off.\n\nAdded a control input to freeze the current picture allowing to switch and make capture areas/ color correction adjustments much more easily\n\nInputs\n\nJoystick plugin now reads all controllers POVS instead of just the first one.\n\nKeyboard input plugin finally supports key modifiers combo (CTRL+xxx… ALT+xxx… SHIFT+xxx… CTRL + SHIFT + xxx…)\n\nShake It\n\nWind\n\nReduced idling delay of HRS fans\n\nFixed an issue with drafting effecting ACC online and making the draft stop the fans;\n\nBass shakers / motors :\n\nLoading a profile coming from motors in bass shakers and the opposite would fail and bread the output settings, incompatible effects of the target mode are now removed during import.\n\nDash studio\n\nAdded an option to choose the widget initial page at loading\n\nDash studio automatic backups are now cleaned at SimHub startup instead of just when saving a dashboard.\n\nBetter windows standard fonts cleaning in dashboards\n\nDevices\n\nAdded GSI Hyper P1 support\n\nAdded GSI GTMax-32 support (needs a firmware update, which will be delivered through GSI control center)\n\nAdded GSI Formula Pro Elite support (needs a firmware update, which will be delivered through GSI control center)\n\nAdded AlphaTecRacing Dashboard Formula support\n\nAdded power settings : All devices are now closed (shutdown) when the monitor goes to sleep.\n\nAdded a “Device extension SDK” allowing to add a custom control panel to devices.\n\nDevice defaults can now be overridden without getting overwritten by installer by adding a device settings file inside DeviceDefaults\\Overrides folder\n\nAX206 Improvements\n\nAdded multiple AX206 support based on serial number (warning AX206 serial number seems based on manufacturing date and the needed could not be unique depending of the batches)\n\nAdded framerate limiting for AX206\n\nAX206 physical disconnect is now detected instead of remaining connected.\n\nGames\n\nImproved RF1/GTR2 disconnect status\n\nImproved UDP Games conflicts detection with other applications, the conflicting app is now indicated when possible allowing to solve more easily the conflict.\n\nSystem infos\n\nRemoved embedded “Open hardware monitor” component, unfortunately all variations of this component even the most recent contains some security breach rightly pointed by some antivirus.\n\nAdded a few vitals information read directly by SimHub in replacement of “Open hardware monitor”\n\nCPU load\n\nMemory load\n\nProperty about the monitors state (ON/sleeping)\n\nOther\n\nWorkaround for .net framework serial ports releasing after physical disconnect keeping the serial ports visible in the system.\n\n8.3.1 Hotfix : Antivirus were unusually aggressive toward the installer (even if false positives are usual with new versions) : changed the installer compression method and install order, everything seems quiet now … Antivirus hammer mysteries striked again.\n\n8.3.2 Hotfix : Windows Defender was still randomly flagging the installer while not blaming any SimHub files once installed. As a workaround :\n\nThe installer got updated the the latest innosetup version with a little face lift for the occasion.\n\nRemoved UDP conflicts application name (conflicts will still be detected), it could have been triggering windows defender.\n\nThe installer got updated the the latest innosetup version with a little face lift for the occasion.\n\nRemoved UDP conflicts application name (conflicts will still be detected), it could have been triggering windows defender.\n\nWindows defender seems quiet for now … until next false positive.\n\n8.2.3 – 27/02/2023 – Hotfix\n\nFix : AC pitlimiter and revlimiter were mixed since previous release.\n\nFix : Some DashStudio buttons could catch a wrong pressed event when using desktop engine and dashboard was windowed.\n\nFix : Control mapper web interface was going back to top after each button press.\n\nFeat : Added bashshaker idle mode : when not in game the audio interfaces will be stopped allowing computer sleep after an idle timer.\n\nFix : BassShakers “forget all disconnected outputs” feature was forgetting all audio outputs.\n\nFix : Multiple Vocore would not connect at SimHub launch and require unplugging/replugging the screen to get it connected\n\nFix : Ahead/Behing best lap time was lost on last update\n\nNew SimCore firmware exclusion from Arduino serial scan\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.2.2 – 17/02/2023\n\nNew control mapper plugin (Documentation : https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Control-Mapper-plugin)\n\nAn alternative to various “Joy to joy” solutions already available, but primarily focused on wheels hot swapping, it allows to aggregate multiple wheels buttons / controllers to a single one allowing easy in game controller/wheel hot swapping.\n\nMany simple use cases :\n\nWheel hot swapping : no matter if you have two or ten wheels, diy or commercial , wheel swapping dream is often broken by in game mappings to be done again\n\nSequential shifter vs paddles ? you can have both ready to go.\n\nControllers limits ? ATS/ETS2 limits you to 4 controllers : one handbrake, one split shifter, one shifter, one wheel … No room available anymore for your button box or any fancy controller you might still have.\n\nSome key features :\n\n“role name” based mapping, because most wheels have many buttons nowadays who can remember what does “button 1” or “button 42” ? It allows to quickly add a new wheel based on names instead of numbers.\n\nMultiple virtual controller options available to fit as best as possible your existing setup :\n\nVjoy : as it is THE known software only solution for such cases, but it went so popular that it’s maybe already busy for another software, and adding multiple Vjoy controllers is not always handled fluently by all games.\n\nArduino Pro micro / leonardo bridge: just plug one of those arduino boards and after a two clicks flash process, benefit of a driver less and conflict less virtual controller.\n\nA simple web interface accessible from your phone allows to do all your in game bindings avoiding tinkering with HIDHide and similar softwares to avoid double inputs.\n\nSimHub internal actions bindings will use “roles” in priority allowing to bind actions independently of the actual device.\n\nGT Sport/ GT7\n\nIt’s now possible to configure the UDP receive port (to allow usage together with another application forwarding data or any UDP forwarder)\n\nIt’s now possible to configure the Console IP (if somehow your network/firewall does not let broadcast UDP go through.\n\nFixed low speed slip giving really high values (against walls etc …)\n\nAC\n\nAdded AC UDP API support for reading the TC and ABS active status.\n\nSome improvements on valid lap checking (AMS2, PCars2)\n\nAdded support for the SimCore DDU line (DS1-S, DS5, UD2-J)\n\nDS5 and UD2-J requires a firmware update which will be available shortly here https://simcore.com.au/simcore-support/\n\nDashstudio buttons improvements (pressed state, pressed opacity)\n\nFix : When hot swapping vocore displays it would not reconnect sometimes.\n\nFixed RF2 opponents name special characters issues\n\nFixed VPG Pro led ordering as well as updated picture and defaut settings\n\nProperties and data\n\nAdded LapsToPlayer, LapsToLeader and speed to Ahead/Behind opponents data\n\nAdded simulated blood pressure data for Heart sensor for easy chart.\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.2.1 – 20/01/2023\n\nHappy new year !\n\nAdded support for standard BLE Heart rate monitor devices (compatible watches, band …).\n\nReplaced some devices pictures to unformize look.\n\nR3E telemetry update.\n\nChanged some popups look to match the latest popups look and feel.\n\nFixed an issue with dash web rendering not correctly taking into account dynamic component resizing.\n\nReworked the look of the device leds modules.\n\nNew in dash navigation support for touch panels.\n\nAdded support for the Symprojects DDU10\n\nAdded support for the SimLab MPX\n\nImproved support for Iracing 360hz\n\nFixed the keyboard reader plugin not able to catch inputs when simhub was started minimized.\n\nFixed Vocore 6.8 touch being reversed\n\nAdded esportsim wheel arduino serial scan exclusion\n\nRenamed “ForceFeel Pad” to “ForceFeel Pad / Next Level Racing HF8 Haptic Gaming Pad” (Both devices sharing the same electronic)\n\nFixed device picture replacement which was reducing the picture size\n\nAdded multiple corsair nexus support / Framerate limiter\n\nDevices activation status is now saved and restoread accross simhub restarts.\n\nFixed GT7 tyre temp telemetry mapping.\n\nAdded support for remote dash rendering : https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Dashstudio-remote-rendering\n\nFixed a crash of the leds test data editor not working when using a specific game group.\n\nOpened support for standard leds devices :\n\nFirmware is now publicly available : https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Getting-started-with-the-SIMHUB-STANDARD-ARDUINO-PRO-MICRO-LEDs-sketch\n\nThe majors devices combos are now directly available :\n\nLeds only\n\nVOCORE + leds\n\nUSBD480 + leds\n\nImproved invalid lap handling for ACC\n\n8.2.0 – 16/12/2022\n\nThe dilemma release … should I or should I not add Gran Turismo support ? SimHub is dedicated to PC games support and supporting Gran Turismo games which are console “only” was creating such big dilemma ! After a long (really long !) I finally decided to release it ! Have fun !\n\nSpecial thanks to Nenkay and GTPlanet members who opened the way to GT telemetry !\n\nHappy Holidays Season to all of you !\n\nAdded support for Gran Turismo 7\n\nAdded support for Gran Turismo Sport\n\nNew devices support\n\nAdded support for P1Sim Arnage wheel, EVO Plus\n\nAdded support for 3Drap Viri\n\nAdded support for Ascher Racing 4″ and 5″ DDU\n\nAdded support for VPG RRSPG Pro\n\nFixed the plugin SDK not targetting .net 4.8 by default.\n\nAdded a device brand filter to help with device type picking.\n\nWinter cleanup :\n\nRecompressed lot of picture to save size/loading time\n\nReviewed unused dlls\n\nLEDS devices and LCD devices now have brightness control mappings (warning : some vocore models do not support very well changing the brightness on the fly)\n\nFixed SRH Gforce Pro not working when not migrating old leds settings.\n\nBlocked serial ports for all Simucube devices (Simhub won’t scan those serial ports)\n\nRemoved 8.1.0 and earlier automatic controls mappings migration to save on settings files size (If you come from 8.1.0 and earlier, please install and run 8.1.3 first to migrate the buttons mappings first)\n\nImproved WRC telemetry automatic setup : the game tends to generate the setting file “when it wants”, SimHub will now create the file during configuration if it is still missing\n\n8.1.3 – 05/11/2022\n\nWRC Generations support\n\nNew devices :\n\nSimutec SDU-2 support (requires a firmware upgrade)\n\nNew VPG Wheel support\n\nIntegration of a standard protocol for commercial devices using ATMEGA32U or serial based devices (please contact me for more infos)\n\nInstaller weight-loss program :\n\nMost of the embedded pictures have been recompressed\n\nNextion dependencies are not bundled anymore, it’s available now as a separate installer : see https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Nextion—End-of-support\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.1.2 – 09/10/2022 – Maintenance release\n\nDevices updates :\n\nit’s now possible to replace the device picture (right click on the picture to replace it)\n\nVocore based devices not using touch had the touch related options removed.\n\nFixed devices dashboard lists not refreshing when adding/removing/cloning a dashboard\n\nAdding CubeControls CSX3 support\n\nAdding P1sim P1-Eau Rouge EVO support\n\nSplitted support for GRID BY SIM-LAB Porsche 911 RSR wheel.\n\nFew appearance adjustments to the devices sections.\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.1.1 – 10/09/2022 – Maintenance release\n\nFix for Iracing Mission R not working (the car is lacking lot of telemetry channels)\n\nAdded support for multiple input mapping in dynamic actions (Devices inputs, shakeit …)\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.1.0 – 03/09/2022\n\nReworked “devices” management introducing a new “devices” section with all in one settings (leds, screens ….)\n\nMigrated all devices to this section\n\nReworked all the defaut settings management.\n\nAdded support for Vocore 6.8″\n\nAdded support for CubeControls FPRO\n\nAdded support for Innato DDU\n\nAdded support for Innato GT30 Panel\n\nAdded support for Innato LMP2\n\nDashStudio :\n\nFixed some issues occurring with some fonts variations not being recognised correctly (bold, ….) affecting web rendering.\n\nIt’s now possible to enable / disable a screen using a formula.\n\nFixed “F7 to focus editor”\n\nUSB Displays (Vocore, USBD480 …) can now remember the last dash used depending of the car model / Idle screen of the selected game.\n\nAdded “value” filter in the property list\n\nShakeit :\n\nIt’s now possible to “clear” a custom channel map\n\nIt’s now possible to show disconnected sound devices in order to transfer/export settings\n\nNB : It’s possible to recover old leds settings when adding a new device by checking the option during “add” dialog\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.0.4 – 09/07/2022\n\nAdded manual maximum speed selection for wind plugin\n\nAdded “Edit” menu (copy/cut/paste) to dashstudio\n\nFixed next/previous dash actions not working on wpf engine.\n\nFixed MXbikes vs GP Bikes automatic detection issue.\n\nFixed dash studio list not refreshing when converting a dash to an overlay and the opposite.\n\n8.0.3 was triggering kasperspy detection without any specific reasons. A simple recompilation with the very little changes listed above solved it … without any specific reasons neither … Antiviruses mysteries …\n\nHave fun !\n\n8.0.3 – 03/07/2022\n\nAdded automatic telemetry setup for F1 22 VR.\n\nFixed vertical centered linear gauges\n\nFixed dashstudio next/previous dash actions not taken into account in web mode rendering.\n\nAdded more raw telemetry properties for ACC\n\nFixed dash studio copy/paste of components with images.\n\n8.0.2 – 28/06/2022 – F1 22 release day !\n\nF1 22 Support\n\nAMS2 Telemetry definitions update (V12)\n\nSymprojects devices support : Fan controller, Iflag, GI Max gear indicator\n\nGrid by SimLab wheels support.\n\nNB : F1 22 telemetry specification does not specifies yet 22 team names as a fallback until EA/Codemasters updates their documentation current names are coming from f1 2021 and might be wrong.\n\n8.0.0 – 8.0.1 – 29/05/2022\n\nWarning : SimHub V8 contains some braking changes due to a major rework of DashStudio internal structure :\n\nDashStudio Dashboards created with versions 7.X and prior will be automatically upgraded to the new file version. If you were using an older version and want to be able to rollback to versions 7.X make sure to do a backup first of your DashStudio dashboards contained in SimHub\\DashTemplates folder.\n\nSome malformed NCalc formulas are not supported anymore\n\nIf you wan’t to stay on SimHub version 7.X you can download the last version (7.4.23) here\n\nAfter a few months of hard work it’s time for a big release !\n\nThis rework gets DashStudio editor closer to real life race dash editors (like Motec Display Creator), and gets the experience more in line to the designers “UX” standards like Visual Studio or similar. I sincerely hope you will like it !\n\nFor the occasion I thought that upgrading to “V8” was a nice symbol for a Sim Racing software !\n\nLets go for the change list !\n\nBig rework of dashstudio !\n\nNew tool windows “Docking” system\n\nReworked toolbox\n\nReworked components “tree” :\n\nDrag and drop is easier\n\nEach component has an icon representing its kind\n\nA combo box allows to
