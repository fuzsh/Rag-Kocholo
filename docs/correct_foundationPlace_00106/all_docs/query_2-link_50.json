        "text": "Block teaching designed around you\n\nYou deserve a positive teaching and learning experience, where you feel part of a supportive and nurturing community. That’s why most students will enjoy an innovative approach to learning using block teaching, where you will study one module at a time. You’ll benefit from regular assessments - rather than lots of exams at the end of the year - and a simple timetable that allows you to engage with your subject and enjoy other aspects of university life such as sports, societies, meeting friends and discovering your new city. By studying with the same peers and tutor for each block, you’ll build friendships and a sense of belonging.\n\nRead more about block teaching\n\nUCAS tariff information\n\nStudents applying for courses starting in September will be made offers based on the latest UCAS Tariff.\n\nContextual offer\n\nTo make sure you get fair and equal access to higher education, when looking at your application, we consider more than just your grades. So if you are eligible, you may receive a contextual offer. Find our more about contextual offers.\n\nWe welcome applications from mature students with non-standard qualifications and recognise all other equivalent and international qualifications\n\nEnglish language\n\nIf English is not your first language then an IELTS score of 6.0 overall with a minimum of 5.5 in each component (or equivalent) is essential.\n\nEnglish Language tuition, delivered by our British Council accredited Centre for English Language Learning, is available both before and throughout the course if you need it.\n\nGame Art Studios\n\nWe have excellent specialist facilities that include a games studio with a range of industry standard software and high spec PCs for producing 3D game content and for studying games on PC, Playstation, Xbox as well as the next generation hardware as it becomes available. We also have VR development facilities to support students who wish to work in visualisation and VR. The 2D elements of the course benefit from a dedicated drawing studio, and you will have access to a professional-standard suite of Cintiq tablets. We also have fully AV-equipped lecture/ seminar rooms to support other learning and teaching activities.\n\nLibrary and learning zones\n\nOn campus, the main Kimberlin Library offers a space where you can work, study and access a vast range of print materials, with computer stations, laptops, plasma screens and assistive technology also available.\n\nAs well as providing a physical space in which to work, we offer online tools to support your studies, and our extensive online collection of resources accessible from our Library website, e-books, specialised databases and electronic journals and films which can be remotely accessed from anywhere you choose.\n\nWe will support you to confidently use a huge range of learning technologies, including the Virtual Learning Environment, Collaborate Ultra, DMU Replay, MS Teams, Turnitin and more. Alongside this, you can access LinkedIn Learning and learn how to use Microsoft 365, and study support software such as mind mapping and note-taking through our new Digital Student Skills Hub.\n\nThe library staff offer additional support to students, including help with academic writing, research strategies, literature searching, reference management and assistive technology. There is also a ‘Just Ask’ service for help and advice, live LibChat, online workshops, tutorials and drop-ins available from our Learning Services, and weekly library live chat sessions that give you the chance to ask the library teams for help.\n\nMore flexible ways to learn\n\nWe offer an equitable and inclusive approach to learning and teaching for all our students. Known as the Universal Design for Learning (UDL), our teaching approach has been recognised as sector leading. UDL means we offer a wide variety of support, facilities and technology to all students, including those with disabilities and specific learning differences.\n\nJust one of the ways we do this is by using ‘DMU Replay’ – a technology providing all students with anytime access to audio and/or visual material of lectures. This means students can revise taught material in a way that suits them best, whether it's replaying a recording of a class or adapting written material shared in class using specialist software.\n\nGraduate Careers\n\nFrom Grand Theft Auto V to Star Citizen and Assassin’s Creed, our graduates make the games you play. Many have progressed to work as concept artists, character artists, lead artists, technical artists and directors, for leading companies such as Artificial Life, Rockstar North, SEGA, Sony and Ubisoft.\n\nGame Art graduate Patrick Herbison is a vehicle artist at Codemasters, where he builds accurate 3D models of real-world cars for games such as Dirt Rally 2, Grid, F1 and Forza Horizon 4.\n\nHe said: “The industry links on the course keep it up-to-date and relevant, as well as providing a forum for feedback from people working in the industry. I believe this helped me to secure a job at Codemasters before I had even finished the course.”\n\nDMU Global\n\nOur innovative international experience programme DMU Global aims to enrich your studies and expand your cultural horizons, helping you to become a global graduate, equipped to meet the needs of employers across the world.\n\nThrough DMU Global, we offer a wide range of opportunities including on-campus and UK-based activities, overseas study, internships, faculty-led field trips and volunteering, as well as international exchanges.\n\nGame Art students have visited New York’s Intrepid Museum to help inspire and bring their game designs to life."
