        "text": "Developing you as a professional developer\n\nThe course covers core programming languages and video game development tools, as well as contemporary agile software development techniques to make you a competent and adaptable programmer, capable of finding employment in the sector or preparing you for further academic study.\n\nYour first position in the video game industry\n\nBuilding upon your core language and software development skills, in the second year you will be tasked with a specific role within our in-house game development studio over the summer term. This work experience gives you the opportunity to apply the knowledge and professional practices you’ve learnt on the course in a safe and supportive environment. Typically for these projects you’ll be using industry standard game development tools such as Unity and Unreal.\n\nThe work students produce during these summer placements can act as excellent portfolio pieces, which demonstrate their ability as both a professional game developer and effective team member.\n\nPutting you in control of your final project\n\nThroughout the three years you will be provided with a structured programme of learning, in line with your chosen specialism of video game development. The course culminates with a project you define yourself which uses a specific programming language and technology you have learned on the course, such as JavaScript, C#, C++, Three.js, SFML, Unity and Unreal.\n\nYou have the choice of either proposing your own individual project or collaborating with other students to create another video game project for your portfolio.\n\nBest of class facilities and staff\n\nTeaching takes place in a modern production studio based in Birmingham city centre, where you’ll be provided with studio space to complete your projects and access to the software you’ll need for the duration of the course.\n\nYou will be taught by staff with significant experience in the video game development industry, having worked with game developers including Psygnosis, Rage Software, Codemasters, FreeStyleGames and EA Games.\n\nReal experience\n\nBy the time you graduate you’ll have three years of tangible games development studio experience under your belt, ready to launch your dream career as a games developer.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to apply for one of our one-year Gamer Camp courses, to gain even more in-depth skills, and experience.\n\nThe course is structured around teaching you new skills and allowing you the freedom to experiment and experience putting your new skills into practice through live projects.\n\nTypically, this means modules are split into taught modules and studio-based project modules.\n\nTaught Modules\n\nIn the taught modules the focus is on your personal development as a professional coder. You will take modules which focus on your individual development as computer programmers for interactive software, for example; Computer Science fundamentals, object oriented programming, maths for game development, physics, using existing software library & software development practices. It is during these languages you’ll learn the programming languages, JavaScript, C# and C++.\n\nGuaranteed in-house placement (Project Modules)\n\nThe video game development course is all about providing you with crucial experience-based learning you'll need for your career. To this end during the summer term you will be required to attend an in-house work placement. It is during these modules you’ll be using development tools such as Unity & Unreal.\n\nAssessment\n\nThis is a two year accelerated undergraduate degree course, with an additional foundation year, with professional game development studio experience embedded as part your learning journey. You'll be assessed in a variety of different ways, including practical project work – both group and individual – presentations, written reports and practical portfolios.\n\nAssessment is embedded into the course, which will mean your learning experience isn't constantly interrupted by assessment. You are also assessed on your work within a project delivery team while you are based in our simulated in-house studio environment.\n\nOn the course, you'll be taught by established industry professionals with a wealth of expertise and enthusiasm, who are experienced at recognising and responding to the rapidly changing demands within the industry.\n\nExperience on the course\n\nCourses within the School of Games, Film and Animation are built upon workplace simulation and industry-standard work, ensuring you behave less like a student and more as a professional, gaining the workplace experience and attributes you need.\n\nAs well as gaining course-specific skills, you could also gain broader tools through our Graduate+ programme, which will help enhance your employment options by helping with careers development, employability activities, volunteering and part-time work experience.\n\nLeading up to and upon graduation\n\nAt the end of your studies you’ll complete a final major project, which may lead you to working directly with a client. This direct contact will give you the experience, confidence and freedom to put into action all you’ve learned on your studies. Allied with this course-specific experience, you will also have access to a range of support staff and services from the University’s Careers Service, who can help with:\n\nReviewing CVs, covering letters and application forms\n\nCareer planning and decision making\n\nPreparing for interviews and assessment centres\n\nDeveloping portfolios\n\nNetworking with employers\n\nAdvice about self-employment and entrepreneurship\n\nPlacements\n\nDuring the summer term of your first year, you will have the opportunity to work in a video game development team as part of the in-house placement element of the course. Previous, projects have included a ‘Doctor Who’ interactive comic book project with the BBC and Red Bee Media, an integrated web and mobile suite of mini games with The Wellcome Trust and Xtreme Drone Racing with Sony PlayStation First.\n\nWorking on live projects\n\nStudents have also worked along postgraduates to make a mobile version of the PlayStation 4 Xtreme Drone Racing game which is being developed as part of the PlayStationFirst initiative. The mobile versions features racing against 40 drones in a variety of locations in Birmingham, geotagged content and extensive drone customisation.\n\nBirmingham City University is a vibrant and multicultural university in the heart of a modern and diverse city. We welcome many international students every year – there are currently students from more than 80 countries among our student community.\n\nThe University is conveniently placed, with Birmingham International Airport nearby and first-rate transport connections to London and the rest of the UK.\n\nOur international pages contain a wealth of information for international students who are considering applying to study here, including:\n\nDetails of the entry requirements for our courses\n\nSome of the good reasons why you should study here\n\nHow to improve your language skills before starting your studies\n\nInformation relevant to applicants from your country\n\nWhere to find financial support for your studies."
