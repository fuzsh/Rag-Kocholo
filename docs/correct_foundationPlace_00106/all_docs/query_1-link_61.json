        "text": "Here’s Why Dallas Burston Polo Club Is More Than Just A Polo Venue\n\nStag and Hen Parties\n\nCelebrate the beginning of your new life, or welcome your best friend into his/hers with the ideal venue for a unique and memorable stag/hen party. Not only could you spend a day learning to play polo, but Dallas Burston Polo Club’s stunning 600 acres of woodland, polo grounds, parks, meadows and tarmac roads allow for a range of other activities.\n\nTry learning to shoot with Honesberie Shooting School. The Southam-based business offers mobile event packages, and is well-equipped to bring their Shooting Experience days to you. Your group can enjoy a range of different shooting styles, including clay pigeons, archery, crossbow, air rifle and air pistols, with prices starting at £40 a person. Honesberie also offer pre-ceremony wedding packages, for couples seeking something a little different as entertainment.\n\n….. With that in mind, consider having your wedding at Dallas Burston Polo Club.\n\nWith four premium venues available on site, all with stunning views of the immaculately-kept polo pitches and Warwickshire countryside, there really is no better place to host your wedding. The Club has venues to suit every size of ceremony, ranging from 30 dining guests to 750, with two professional wedding planners available to help you craft your perfect day down to the very last detail. The award-winning caterers, Sanjay Foods, are the exclusive providers of Asian-style cuisine for Dallas Burston Polo Club; providing a luxury, professional service and exquisite food for weddings, charity events and corporate dinners. Their team of international chefs specialise in a variety of different style including North and South Indian, Indo-Chinese, Thai and Lebanese, as well as regional variations such as Punjabi and Gujarati.\n\nFamily Fun Days and Corporate Team-Building\n\nThe possibilities are endless with Dallas Burston Polo Club’s huge amount of outdoor space. Fun days are perfect for bringing your staff together and helping them bond over fun, engaging activities; whether as part of an anniversary or office celebration, or a team-building programme. The Club’s exclusive partner, Bright Vision Events, are a spectacular supplier of fun day equipment and packages. They offer specialist advice for planning and executing a constructive, successful Fun Day event, with a range of activities available. Some are suitable for family fun days with young children or birthday parties; such as fun fair stalls, giant inflatables, bouncy castles, helter skelters, photo booths and magicians. There is more than plenty for adults on corporate motivation programmes to enjoy, too; climbing walls, F1 simulators, laser clay shooting, falconry and inflatable quasars.\n\nCommendations come from business such as Atlantic Airlines and Code Masters. Both found their corporate celebrations to be a huge success with the staff and their families.\n\nDressage\n\nMore interested in the finesse and discipline of Dressage than the Sport of Kings? Dallas Burston Polo Club became an approved venue for British Dressage competition in May 2016, and has received glowing support since. Spectators and judges can enjoy the terrace viewing gallery that overlooks the huge arena (around 4x the size of a conventional dressage arena) which has a superb all-weather surface, perfect for competitions. They also host Preliminary to Advanced classes mid-week for those who wish to learn the discipline."
