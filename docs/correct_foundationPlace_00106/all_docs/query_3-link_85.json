Please also note that you are responsible for any costs incurred in travelling to and from your work placement, and for any accommodation costs.\n\nAs soon as you start the course, you’ll begin to develop a portfolio. This will include creating games, studying game artificial intelligence and physics, computer graphics using DirectX and OpenGL, and network programming for multiplayer game development. You’ll learn programming languages such as C++ and C# as well as the software engineering skills needed to develop large, efficient programs.\n\nDuring Year 2, you’ll work in a team to develop a game from an initial concept to a finished product and in your final year you will work in a group to create your own framework on which you will develop a game. Additionally, you can specialise in your own area of interest in your final year modules (Graphics, AI or Mobile) and can work towards a research project in any games / software development related field for your Games Technology Research Project.\n\nAs soon as you start the course, you’ll begin to develop a portfolio.

We’ll also give you the opportunity to pitch your games to commercial games studios such as Matmi, Team 17 and Media Molecule.\n\nYou’ll complete a one-year placement in industry after your second year.\n\nIn your final year, you can specialise in your own area of interest. You’ll work in a group to complete a game development project that simulates game industry working practices. You’ll also undertake an individual final year project. This could involve developing a complete game, or researching and implementing an advanced topic in game development.\n\nAcademic year\n\nThe course operates on a modular basis that provides flexibility and choice. Typically the majority of modules are 30 academic credits with a smaller number of 15 credit modules. Each credit taken equates to a total study time of around 10 hours. Total study time includes scheduled teaching, independent study and assessment activity. Full-time students take modules worth 60 credits per semester, with part-time students taking proportionately fewer credits per semester. All students take a total of 120 credits per level and 360 credits for the degree as a whole. Your overall grade for the course and your degree classification are based on the marks obtained for modules taken at levels 5 and 6. The full-time course has one start point in September.\n\nThe course operates on a modular basis that provides flexibility and choice.
