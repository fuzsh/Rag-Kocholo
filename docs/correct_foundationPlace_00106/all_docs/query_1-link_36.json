        "text": "The Royal Leamington Spa colour palette\n\nThe artwork is made up of several large colour swatches, each one representing themes relating to the town, which include Arts & Culture, Innovation, Sports & Leisure, Nature and Natural Environment, Entertainment, History, and Community.\n\nWarwick District Council’s Tourism and Culture spokesman Councillor Liam Bartlett said:\n\n“The Royal Leamington Spa Colour Palettes will be a great visual improvement for the gateway into the town. Welcoming visitors and spectators from all over the world during this year’s Commonwealth Games. This piece of public art will showcase what we are proud of in Royal Leamington Spa and provide a fantastic opportunity for the people of the district to be part of this project.”\n\nMembers of the public were invited to help shape the development of the Royal Leamington Spa Colour Palette by making suggestions, via an online form and social media, on people, places, objects, and things residents and people who visit and work in the area associate with the town. The artist then turned suggestions into the final artwork.\n\nHow was the artist and artwork selected?\n\nWarwick District Council, with the support of Warwick District Creative Compact, worked with Network Rail and Warwickshire County Council to explore various suitable options for creative interventions for the pedestrian tunnel at Leamington Spa Station. Due to the nature of the superstructure, there were a number of significant challenges to overcome. Considerations around safety, security, maintenance, vandalism, cost, return on investment, appropriateness, and overall aesthetic had to be taken into account.\n\nLarge wall mounted panels and anti-graffiti vinyl was finally selected as a final solution as it provided not only a safe and clean surface on which to install artwork, but it could be re-used in the future for new pieces of work in the space.\n\nThree options were pitched by officers to Warwick District Council’s Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games Project Board, including street art, digitally generated graphics, and the Royal Leamington Spa Colour Palette. It was agreed that the Colour Palette methodology, which had proven successful in Birmingham’s Grand Central, was the best fit due to the community engagement element, which would allow the people who live, work, and visit the area to have a say in the palette’s contents, making the work site specific and relevant to Leamington. It was also agreed that it would help to broaden the mix of wall-based art in the area by providing a different approach and style.\n\nWho is the Artist?\n\nStacey Barnfield is a Birmingham-based artist, designer and former newspaper editor with a fascination for the heritage and history of the Midlands from a design, typography and ‘place’ perspective. More of Stacey’s work can be seen through the Draw My City artworks project, which encourages people to think of lesser-known places that might not always win architecture awards but are no less important to the people who worked, danced or dined there. Calling on his production journalism skills, Stacey has been commissioned to produce publications in various formats that celebrate architecture and design. Stacey Barnfield said:\n\n“The Colour Palette artworks are all about celebrating local; the areas we grew up in, the people who inspire us, the places we love and the buildings we cherish. It’s wonderful that the Royal Leamington Spa Colour Palettes are being shaped by residents of the town and my thanks go out to everyone who submits a suggestion.”\n\nHow was the artwork funded?\n\nIt is funded by Warwick District Council and Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership, which has provided £1.8million for infrastructure improvements ahead of the games. The total cost for the Royal Leamington Spa Colour Palette project will be a little over £30k which includes the printing, production, and installation of the 14 panels and the artists fee.\n\nHow were the colours selected?\n\nWe received over 300 suggestions from members of the public during the month-long call-out (240 via the survey and over 60 via Social Media channels). The content that features is a combination of the most popular responses and responses chosen by the artist to make a more interesting piece of work.\n\nWe must stress that the palettes are not designed to be a comprehensive representation of the town’s illustrious history, but it is intended to be a snapshot of how the respondents to the call-out see Royal Leamington Spa in 2022, and how the artist interprets these as part of his artistic practice.\n\nIn some instances, the colour is taken directly from the thing it is referencing. In other instances it is more cryptic, which encourages the viewer to think a little harder about its meaning.

So, pink makes sense to represent the community on the Colour Palette.” - Daniel Browne, Chair of Warwickshire\n\nStreet Art Indigo - Leamington Spa is now famed for its street art. It boasts work from highly respected artists on walls in Old Town and on the canals and waterways, thanks largely to efforts from Brink Contemporary Arts.\n\nIs this a good use of public money?\n\nAbsolutely! The space was in urgent need of updating. It is the gateway to our beautiful town, and this new piece of artwork provides not only a talking point but helps signposts visitors the types of things they can expect to discover and see during their visit. We’re proud of our town, and this is a brilliant way of celebrating what it has to offer in an interesting and fun way. The panels can also be used in the future to host different kinds of artworks, so we believe it is an excellent use of public money, which will allow us to curate the space over the coming years.\n\nI don’t agree with some of the inclusions in the palettes.\n\nThat’s OK. Art is a brilliant way to encourage discussion and debate and see the world from different views and through different lenses. We encourage you to formulate your own opinions about the work. You might consider designing your own colour palettes and sharing them with us.\n\nWhy wasn’t a local artist chosen?\n\nWe are fortunate to have many extremely talented artists in the area, but the colour palette concept, which was approved by stakeholders during the planning phase, remains the intellectual property of Stacey Barnfield, who was commissioned to deliver the work. Stacey’s work has received hugely positive feedback in other towns and cities, so we were reassured that the colour palette would be well received by the people who live, work, and visit the area.\n\nHow will it be maintained?\n\nEach of the 14 panels are planned to be installed using similar methodology to the existing artwork in situ in the underpass. Existing wooden batons are to be replaced with aluminium batons, and plywood panels with aluminium panels to improve their durability. The panels will be faced with vandal-resistant anti-graffiti vinyl that can also be replaced if damaged in other ways.\n\nWill the pedestrian tunnel get a fresh lick of paint?\n\nYes. The walls will be repainted as part of the wider on-going maintenance programme. The water staining, which finds its way into the space below from the tracks, is an on-going challenge which is beyond the scope of this project.\n\nWhat’s happening with the existing artwork in the tunnel?\n\nThe existing artwork, produced in partnership with the Friends of Leamington Station, Network Rail and the Community Payback Service and installed in 2012, has been digitally recorded and will be made available here.\n\nPrevious page\n\nNext page"
