Some of his prominent works include Last Ninja 2 and Driller.\n\nMusic Development\n\nCommodore 64\n\nInitially, Gray used Soundmonitor and the Ariston driver, sometimes optimized by game programmers and at that sometimes with declined quality. Soon after, the founders of Codemasters convinced him to write his own driver. Following that, he jammed on a Casio MT-45 and typed the data in assembly.\n\nNES\n\nAccording to Gray, he had to compose the music in 6502 assembly. He used a sound driver by Gavin Raeburn.
