        "text": "OWN THE SPOTLIGHT\n\nAs you begin to get your feet wet and make a buzz in the racing scene, you catch the eye of Alex Janiček or AJ, (voiced by Troy Baker). An undisputed superstar and fan favorite in the world of DIRT, AJ quickly takes you under his wing, showing you what it takes to rise to the top of the sport he has dominated for years.\n\nIn addition, you’re not the only new racer making a splash, though. Enter Bruno Durand – the ultra-competitive, cold, calculated veteran (voiced by Nolan North). A champion in other off-road disciplines, Bruno’s talent and star power mean a clash with AJ is inevitable, but the fallout from an epic race between these two icons lays the foundation for you to create your own legacy in the sport.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR PATH\n\nThe Career is split into five chapters to cover the key moments in the narrative. Each chapter offers multiple paths for the player to take, meaning you can choose which events you want to participate in through the chapter. If you want, you can still race in everything there is to offer, which is over 130 events across nine different race types, featuring every location in DIRT 5.\n\nComplete races to open new events in the chapter; the higher you place, the more Stamps you will earn. A certain amount of Stamps are needed to unlock the Main Event of each chapter, so the better you perform, the quicker you can progress.\n\nREPRESENT THE WORLD’S BIGGEST BRANDS\n\nTo travel the world, race incredible vehicles and be part of this vibe, you’ll need sponsors.\n\n20 real-world brands are available to sponsor you in Career mode, including the likes of Monster Energy, Sparco, Michelin, Fatlace and, yours truly, Codemasters. Each sponsor will have unique rewards when you sign with them, including an exclusive livery of that brand, stickers to use in the livery editor, and a currency signing bonus.\n\nMoreover, players can switch to a new sponsor whenever they want in Career, though the earlier you leave a sponsor, the fewer rewards you may receive, especially if you don’t meet your sponsor’s minimum race contract.\n\nSHARE THE JOURNEY\n\nWanna take some of your friends along for the ride? DIRT 5’s split-screen mode for up to four players is included in Career mode!"
