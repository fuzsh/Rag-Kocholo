        "text": "Physical description\n\nA black cassette tape with a white label and black writing that says âDIZZYâ at the top and âAMSTRAD 464/664/6128â and the âCodemastersâ trademark on the bottom with an explosion background.\n\nA paper insert leaflet on the front of which is a picture of the âDizzyâ character, a cartoon egg with a face and red boxing gloves and red boots, falling down a waterfall in a brown cave. There are two men, âbaddiesâ in the background grinning and glaring at Dizzy and another egg locked in a cage. At the top is the word, âDIZZYâ in red capital lettering in a green cloud and an orange corner label stating the game is for the âAmstrad Schneider 464/664/6128â. At the bottom of the image is the âCodemastersâ yellow and blue trademark and two black and white labels stating, âThe Ultimate Cartoon Adventureâ and âBy the Oliver Twins authors of GRAND PRIX SIMULATORâ.\n\nA clear transparent plastic box with a hinged back.\n\nSummary\n\nThis game was owned and played with by Samantha Lawson, b. 08/01/1978, and her brother Thomas b. 30/11/1974. Dizzy â The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure was the first video game featuring the character Dizzy, an anthropomorphic egg. The game was designed by two British brothers, Philip and Andrew Oliver, frequently referred to as the Oliver twins. The game is a platform adventure where Dizzy must search the fairy tale land of Katmandu for a Leprechaun's Wig, a Cloud's Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux Feather, and a Troll Brew and deposit them in a cauldron to make a potion to defeat the evil wizard Zaks. The gameplay involves collecting items and moving to other locations where the item is required; for example, at one point a raincoat is needed to protect against damaging rain. This is made more difficult because only one item can be carried at any given time. Unlike later games in the series, which focus more on the inventory-based puzzles, this game features a very large number of hazards that impede the player's progress. This object was published by Codemasters, one of the oldest British video game developers."
