The last of the enormous extermination centers which is tangibly preserved. The largest of all the Nazi German concentration camps.\n\nIf the world we would like to build is to be safer, peaceful and more welcoming, it is imperative that we keep the authenticity of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial viable and palpable.\n\nNo one can change the past; however the future is in our hands. Help us to preserve the authenticity of Auschwitz-Birkenau. Help us to warn humanity against itself. Do not allow history to become a deafening silence. Save the memory.\n\nDr. Piotr M.A. Cywi≈Ñski\n\nPresident of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation"
