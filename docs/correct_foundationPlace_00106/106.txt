Studio officials have announced the foundation of a new Merritt Island, Florida office for Firebrand Games, a specialty developer of racing games like Cartoon Network Racing, and Codemasters' Race Driver Create and Race. The new U.S. office extends the developer's Glasgow reach, in a move that the company calls "a natural move for the company and will help them serve their US clients even better." Having created racing games for Codemasters and The Game Factory, the developer says it is now working on three yet-unannounced racing titles. Said company CEO Mark Greenshields, “I am really excited to be opening our first Studio based in the USA. Being based in Florida gives us a really great location to create games. We are minutes from the beach and with the great Florida weather, are in an ideal place for a great lifestyle for our team and our clients. Our quality will go from strength to strength.”
