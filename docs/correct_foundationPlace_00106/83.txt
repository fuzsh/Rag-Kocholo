Codemasters has announced that it is now focusing exclusively on racing games.

Codemasters [http://www.codemasters.com] isn't an industry heavyweight by any stretch of the imagination but it's been around since 1986, it employs 700 people and it's put out a lot of games over the years, some of which are actually pretty good. Its best-known titles tend to be racing games, like the Dirt and F1 franchises, but it's also responsible for games like Bodycount and Operation Flashpoint. But no longer!

Codemasters announced today that it is moving to a racing-only formula, beginning with the launch of a new label, Codemasters Racing, which will serve as the home for the F1 [http://www.amazon.com/Dirt-3-Playstation/dp/B004Q8L46G/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1334862631&sr=8-5] franchises. As for non-racing games, well, there are no more non-racing games.

"Racing is the absolute razor focus for all titles currently in development and those slated for future development across the studios in Warwickshire and Birmingham," the company said. "The focus is an exclusive one, there are no other genre properties in development at this time; racing is everything."

Codemasters is confident enough in the move to full-time racing that it's actually expanding, adding another 100 employees over the course of the year. It's also launching Dirt Showdown [https://www.facebook.com/CMRacenet] playable demo, which comes out on May 1.

This sounds interesting. Codemasters consistently puts out great racing games and are a great example of the best the UK has to offer. Hopefully this means we will finally start getting news of GRID 2. The DiRT and F1 games are all good, but GRID is what I've always been interested in. I've been itching for a sequel for ages, especially since they have released 2 (soon to be 3) DiRT games and 3 F1 games since they brought out GRID!

Makes sense to me, I mean the earliest exposure I had to codemasters was colin mcrae on the PS1 I think, and to my knowledge they're still cranking out top notch racing games.

Though I'll admit I do kinda like Flashpoint, it's good fun if you can get a few friends to play it with you. But it's not like I'll miss it really, something will fill the 4 player co-operative tactical shooter gap.
