        "text": "Feasibility Study for a new Catholic High School\n\nCapital Campaign\n\nRA conducted a pre-campaign feasibility study for a new Catholic high school in the West Valley. We were subsequently retained for a second micro-study and an assessment of their Stewardship Office. It was determined through the assessment that the Stewardship Office required restructuring and additional staffing in order to meet its short and long-term fundraising needs. We then successfully completed searches for a new Executive Director of Mission Advancement and a Director of Campaign Activities. The Stewardship Office transitioned into a fully staffed and multi-faceted Office of Mission Advancement and commenced with a $100 million capital campaign with RA providing counsel.\n\nPre-Campaign Study\n\nTwo Capital Campaigns\n\nCampaign #1: Exceeded $3 million goal for debt reduction.\n\nCampaign #2: $1.4 million raised for renovations/debt reduction (goal of $1 million)\n\nCampaign follow-up and Parish-wide communication\n\nCurrently conducting a 2-year increased offertory campaign"
