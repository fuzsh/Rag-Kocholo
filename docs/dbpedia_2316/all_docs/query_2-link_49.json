        "text": "Bob Hankins\n\nBob attended ASTC from 1947-1951. He was a student of Cordrey’s and pointed out that Cordrey would invite students over to his house at 1725 Bruce Street for hamburgers and french fries. After completing his Ph.D. at the University of Missouri (Analytical, research emphasis in atomic spectroscopy), Bob worked for two years at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He then joined the faculty at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, LA and remained at McNeese throughout his career first as faculty member, then department chair, dean, and finally Vice-President and Provost. Bob was Chair of the Department of Chemistry at McNeese when Joe Smith left ASTC as Professor and Head of Physical Science in 1964 in order to join the chemistry faculty at McNeese State University. Bob reflected on his own time as a faculty member and said that at least once per semester, when asked a question by a student, he would say that he didn’t know the answer (even at times when he actually did know the answer) but would find out and get back to the student. He said that he was trying to make the point to students that faculty members don’t know everything and that they are learning every day, just like the students are. Bob is currently retired and resides in Little Rock where he is close to his brother and his good friends, Mary Good and Anne Butler.\n\n1952\n\nJohn Nelson\n\nAfter graduation from ASTC, John went to graduate school at the University of Missouri and then worked for City Service Oil Company (now Citgo).\n\n1953\n\nBob Butler (1953 chemistry alumnus) and Anne Halter Butler Hickman (1951-53 chemistry major)\n\nAnne Hickman (maiden name Anne Halter, first married name was Anne Butler, married name is now Anne Hickman): Anne was a chemistry student at ASTC from 1951-1953 and then went to the University of Missouri and earned a BS in Chemistry (ACS-certified) at the age of 19, in 1954. She then went to Buckeye Cotton Oil in Memphis, using monochloroacetic acid to combine with cellulose to form carboxymethylcellulose, which is used as a bulking agent in ice cream. She married Bob Butler in 1955 and Bob then went to work at Lion Oil Company in El Dorado. In 1961, they moved to St. Louis, MO and she raised two kids during this time. Bob then decided he no longer wanted to be a chemist and they moved to Florida where Bob opened an auto/boat repair shop and she taught AP chemistry from 1981-1999. She earned a masters in physical/inorganic chemistry in 1986 at the University of Southern Mississippi during the summers. The title of her thesis was “Electrolytic Oxidation/Reduction Chemistry of Chromium.” While teaching in Florida, she won the Chemistry Teacher of the Year Award, awarded by the state of Florida, in 1997. While she was teaching in Florida, she completed a summer workshop in 1986 at UC Berkeley where she met Glenn Seaborg. She recalls Seaborg had retired as president of Berkeley, but he would still come into his office while he was in his 80s. Seaborg told her “never to apologize for being a high school chemistry teacher because you are the source of our university students!” Bob died in 2003. She then taught chemistry at Sacred Heart School in Morrilton and Scotland High School in Scotland, AR. Anne recently married James Hickman, a 1954 graduate of ASTC. In Anne’s 1951 Conway High School annual, James (Jimmy) Hickman wrote “I never would have made it in chemistry without your help.” She has a son, Les Butler, who has been on the chemistry faculty at LSU since 1982, where he is an expert in NMR and XRF. He received a B.S. from UA-Fayetteville, a Ph.D. at Illinois and did a post-doc at Cal Tech. She also has a daughter who is a family practice doctor in Columbus, Ohio, and a granddaughter who has a Ph.D. in physics and works at Los Alamos. This granddaughter is a twin and her twin sister is a business attorney in DC who has served in India as an advocate for women’s rights. She also has a younger granddaughter, who is in graduate school in biology at Harvard.\n\nRichard Scalon\n\nAnne Butler said that Richard Scalon went to chemistry graduate school at the University of Arkansas and was there from 1953-56, but was not sure whether he graduated since she lost touch with him. Anne thinks that Richard moved to the Houston area.\n\nAllen Robinette\n\nAllen was the son of C.V. Robinette, long-time chair of biology at ASTC, and grew up only a few blocks from the ASTC campus. He was a neighborhood friend of Bob Hankins, a 1951\n\nalumnus. Robinette’s family were close friends with Harvel Wright (1956-58 ASTC faculty member) and his family. Anne Butler (oral interview) said that there were three chemistry graduates in 1953: Bob Butler, Richard Scalon, and Allen Robinette and all three of them went to chemistry graduate school at the University of Arkansas. All of them began in 1949 and had Cordrey in class. Bob Halter reported that Cordrey was a “laid-back, friendly person” and that Bob “thought the world of him as a teacher and a person.” Allen earned a masters degree in chemistry from the University of Arkansas in 1956 and served on the ASTC faculty from 1956-1964. He left his faculty position at ASTC in 1964 to return to Fayetteville and completed his Ph.D. there. Allen was then employed by Teva Pharmaceutical in northwest Arkansas. Allen taught physical chemistry and during the 1964-65 academic year there was no one on the staff to teach this course so students enrolled in the course offered at Hendrix. Art Hoyt (personal e-mail) recalls having Allen Robinette for general chemistry and remembers that Allen had one finger missing as a result of an explosion during his work in industry. Denver Prince (personal interview) noted that Allen’s daughter taught geology for the physics department in the Lewis Science Center.\n\n1958\n\nDennis Faulk\n\nDennis grew up on a farm near Kensett, Arkansas and stated “working on a farm without modern herbicides and harvesting equipment produces a strong incentive to go to college.” He worked his way through Harding and ASTC as a projectionist in movie theaters in Conway and Kensett. After graduation from ASTC in 1958, Dennis was accepted to medical school but decided to take a position with Gulf Oil in Port Arthur, Texas, where he developed lubricating greases. After 3.5 years there, he decided to further his education and attended graduate school in chemistry at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He then accepted an industrial position with Shell Oil with a salary that was the highest in the history of any Ph.D. graduate of the University of Arkansas Department of Chemistry. He worked for Shell for 16 months where he enriched p-xylene in feedstock for use in making polyesters. Dennis then decided to pursue an academic career (referring to it as a “calling”), so he accepted a position as a faculty member at Central Missouri State University in 1967. He then served as Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Physics at Central Missouri for 17 years, retiring in 1998. He and his wife, Emily, are currently retired in Hot Springs Village where they enjoy playing golf.\n\n1963\n\nJim Howard\n\nFor the first two years, after graduation, he taught high school chemistry, in Texas and Arkansas. Since 1966, he has worked for the same company, as an Analytical Chemist. Like UCA, in these 52 years, the company has changed names several times, but it is still located in Louisville, KY and now is known as Clariant. He has worked in many areas of analytical chemistry. Including classic “wet” chemistry, physical measurements (surface area and pore volume), gas chromatography, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. For the last 32 years, He has worked with X-ray diffraction. His titles have been Chemist, Analytical Chemist, Senior Analytical Chemist, Group Leader, and now Senior Research Scientist.\n\nJim was married 54 years to Sharon Asbury Howard (d. Oct 2017). Sharon attended ASTC, one year. They had 3 children. Two sons, 49 and 46, there was also one daughter, who is deceased, and 4 grandsons.\n\n1966\n\nJohn David Richardson\n\nJohn David taught in the public schools in northeast Arkansas for many years and is currently retired.\n\nKaren Shewbart\n\nKaren received an MS in Chemistry from UALR (GIT) in 1969 and then moved to Texas and went to work for Dow in analytical services. After 7 years, Karen moved to Environmental Services for Dow and ultimately became the Environmental Manager for Dow’s Texas Operations. Karen moved to Urethane Manufacturing for 3 years managing isocyanate and Polyol manufacturing and then to Epoxy Manufacturing in 1990 and was responsible for all of Dow’s $250 million dollar Epoxy business. In 1996, Karen became the Global Training Manager responsible for uniting the Dow and Union Carbide folks under one standard system. Karen retired in June, 2001 and has become a golfer full time. In 2004, she won the Executive Women’s Golf Association Houston Championship, went on and won the state of Texas tournament in San Antonio, and placed second in Nashville at the Nationals. Karen spends lots of time with the granddaughters, traveling (with golf clubs) and playing lots of golf. Karen has been on the Governor’s Commission on Education, the Governor’s Commission on Environmental Policy and other state boards. In December, 2002, she gave the Commencement address at the Univ. of Texas in Austin. Karen is currently Chair of the University of Texas in Austin, College of Natural Science, Advisory Board.\n\n1967\n\nCecil Ritter\n\nCecil and his wife, Ann, began teaching in the Crossett Public Schools after graduation. Cecil taught chemistry and physics and also completed an MSE degree at UCA. In 1995 he moved to the UAM Technical Campus Crossett as an instructor and retired from there in 2002. Cecil serves on the city water commission and on several committees concerned with school and educational improvement. Cecil and Ann have two children, Beth and Daniel, as well as seven grandchildren. Cecil says, “I have only fond memories of my time at UCA and in the chemistry department. It prepared me well for a career which I enjoyed very much as interacting with the brightest kids in the district helped keep me young! I often run into former graduates and am always interested to discuss ‘old times’ with them as well as their successes.”\n\nBill Shewbart\n\nBill did graduate work at the Univ. of Arkansas in Little Rock for 1.5 years. He went to work for Dow Badische in 1969 doing Pilot Plant R&D Nylon chemistry and transferred to Dow Chemical Hydrocarbon Process research in 1971 where he worked with hydrocarbon catalysts, and light hydrocarbon processes. In 1981, Bill changed to Urethanes Research and worked with proplyene and butylene oxide chemistry, catalysts for polymerization of oxides. Bill moved to the safety area for R&D in 1985 and became North American R&D Safety Director in 1988. In 1990, he became Global Reactive Chemical Manager for Dow and promoted programs for safe handling of chemicals and investigated chemical reactivity incidents. Since retiring from Dow in Sept 1994 at the age of 50, traveling with wife, golfing, and grand kids keep him busy. We have 2 children and have been married 38 years now.
