        "text": "Joplin Public\n\nschoolsjoplinschools.org\n\nA well-rounded educational experience at an early age provides a valuable boost for children, which is why the Joplin School District opened the state-of-the-art Joplin Early Childhood Center in 2018.\n\nAbout 260 students ages 3-5 are educated at the 38,000-square-foot center, with about 51 percent of the students requiring special education services.\n\nThe early childhood center includes 20 classrooms, plus common learning spaces, activity areas and a learning grove that is situated in the middle of the building.\n\n“We have so many features that are different than other preschools in the area,” said Mindy St. Clair, JEC director. “Some of these features are a huge sand and water table, center space outside of the classroom that can be changed to follow each unit the students study, bathrooms for every room and small group learning spaces. Also, we have the most wonderful staff to help educate our youngest learners.”\n\nJoplin started its early childhood program in 1990 and hopes to grow the number of students it serves even more in the coming years.\n\nThe $10 million cost of the JEC was funded equally by the federal and state governments. The building also won two awards for architecture and design: International Interior Design Association Mid-America – Silver Award in K-12 Education; and American Institute of Architects Kansas City – Citation Award in Interior Architecture.\n\nJEC is just one of the impressive aspects of the Joplin School District, which serves more than 7,800 students from per-kindergarten to 12th grade in 11 elementary schools, three middle schools, one high school, a career and technical center and an alternative center.\n\nTechnology is incorporated throughout the curriculum. The student-to-computer ratio is 2-to-1 for grades K-7 and 1-to-1 for upper grades.\n\nServing as the largest district in the area, Joplin Schools offers a plethora of course offerings and extracurricular activities. Joplin High School students have the ability to graduate with an associate degree. They can engage in technology education, and take classes in per-engineering and robotics to name a few. Also, the high school offers Advanced Placement courses, dual-credit courses, Project Lead the Way courses and online learning opportunities. In addition, Franklin Technology Center offers students opportunities to prepare for the workplace directly after high school.\n\nAmong the honors, the district, leaders, staff and students have achieved:\n\nA long-standing history of recognition with Top 100 Missouri Scholars, state and national qualifiers in SkillsUSA, FBLA state, DECA state, along with many state and national qualifiers in fine arts and athletics.\n\nStudents with perfect scores on the ACT, with averages from the 2017-18 school year:\n\n– Top 15 students composite score was 31.95.\n\n– Top 40 students composite score was 29.22.\n\n– Top 50 students composite score was 28.58.\n\n– Top 150 students composite score was 24.86.\n\n100 years of JROTC.\n\nContinued success at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair Regional Science Fair for high school students, including a first-place winner who competed at the international competition in 2019.

The system now encompasses three schools: St. Mary’s Elementary School, St. Peter’s Middle School and McAuley High School. The schools are accredited through the Missouri Nonpublic School Accrediting Association and educate the heart, mind and soul of their students as Christian values in the Catholic tradition are included in all studies as well as weekly church services. The schools are one family, one community educating children for life.\n\nSt. Mary’s is the home to the early childhood program where children ages 2-5 experience the joys of learning at an early age, and continue at St. Mary’s with kindergarten through fifth grade. Children in grades 6-8 attend St. Peter’s and their high school career continues at McAuley with the opportunity to take Advanced Placement and dual-credit courses.\n\nThe JACS system is a member of MSHSAA and is in the Ozark Seven Conference. The girls’ volleyball team earned the 2018 district championship. Students in the JACS system have a greater opportunity to play varsity-level sports from freshman to senior year at McAuley in sports such as volleyball, soccer, cross country, basketball, track and golf. Students at St. Mary’s and St. Peter’s actively participate in athletic activities. JACS student/athletes have won 31 district championships.\n\nThe 2018 graduating class at McAuley completed more than 2,600 hours of community service, and earned more than $1 million in scholarships. Approximately 99 percent of students graduate and attend four-year universities and colleges across the country.\n\nCollege Heights Christian School\n\ncollegeheights.org\n\nCollege Heights Christian School recently celebrated its 40th year as a college prep non-denominational school in Joplin.\n\nThe school, which has an enrollment of approximately 550 in preschool through high school, is a Christ-centered learning environment where students attend weekly chapel and have Christian values and Biblical lessons incorporated into all studies.\n\nCHCS competes against area schools in sports such as cross country, track, basketball, volleyball, soccer, baseball, softball, tennis and golf as a member of the Missouri State High School Activities Association.
