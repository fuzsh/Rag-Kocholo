        "text": "For more than 40 years, Lou Crists unmistakable voice has echoed across Kinnick Stadium and at bowl games, parades, and other events.\n\nAs the inspiring voice of the Hawkeye Marching Band, Crists pregame cue, Its time to get ready for the BOOM! rouses every home game crowd. He also supports the band as a mentor and donor.\n\nCrist received both of his degrees at Iowa, where he and his brother, Lyndon (66BM, 90MA), were Hawkeye Marching Band members. Crist marched in the 1959 Tournament of Roses Parade and at the Rose Bowl. Following graduation, the Des Moines native was a radio announcer for 22 years before moving to Iowa City to work in health care, retiring from the UI Carver College of Medicine in 2007.\n\nIn 1981, Crist became the announcer of the Hawkeye Marching Band, and hes announced every performance since then. Crist has added his familiar voice to pre-season shows, the Band Extravaganza, and more. This included virtually announcing the 2022 Citrus Bowl halftime show from Iowa when he was unable to travel due to COVID concerns. He also mentors band members interested in helping with the groups public relations and social media.\n\nCrist and his wife, Jan Olson Crist (61BSN, 77MA), have established the Lou Crist Legacy Fund to support the bands future. Eric Bush, associate director of bands and director of the Hawkeye Marching Band, says, The Hawkeye Marching Band will feel the positive impact from Lou and his family for as long as the band is in existence.\n\nChad Greenway and Jenni Capista Greenway have translated their leadership as top Hawkeye student-athletes into a legacy of community service. The couple is passionate about childrens health and youth sports, creating and nurturing Chad Greenways Lead the Way Foundation while juggling careers, family, and a business.\n\nDuring their time at Iowa, Jenni ran cross country and track and field, while Chad was an All-Big Ten linebacker. Jenni became certified as a personal trainer and has excelled as a fitness instructor. Chad organized and leads the Wayzata Girls Basketball Association; they are both coaches.\n\nIn 2006, Chad became a first-round draft pick for the Minnesota Vikings, where he remained for his 11-year career. Chads peers recognized his service leadership by naming him the 2015 Whizzer White NFL Man of the Year and as the Vikings Walter Payton Man of the Year Award nominee. After retiring in 2017, Chad co-founded Gray Duck Spirits. He is also a sports consultant.\n\nIn addition to raising four daughters, the Greenways have focused on directing the Lead the Way Foundation and its mission to support families of seriously ill children. Whether building accessible playgrounds at hospitals, fulfilling childrens wishes, or serving respite luncheons for mothers of ailing children, the foundation has touched thousands of lives. The UI Stead Family Childrens Hospital is one beneficiary of Chads Locker, a program that supplies video games and other electronics to engage kids during treatment.\n\nJennis former coach, Layne Anderson, says giving back is in their DNA.\n\nThey have displayed the Hawkeye spirit through their incredible spirit, love for others, and willingness to step up and support others with their time and resources.\"\n\nThomas T.J. Johnsrud is a visionary in health care, business, and service to others. For the past 50 years, he has cultivated a pharmacy in Conrad, Iowa, into a multifaceted organization serving thousands of patients daily in the upper Midwest and Texas. In addition, Johnsrud has maintained involvement in the pharmacy industry at the local, state, and national levels and served as a lifelong advisor to the UI College of Pharmacy.\n\nAs president of NuCara Management Group, Johnsrud oversees more than 39 community pharmacies specializing in traditional, compounding, and infusion therapy. NuCara also includes 10 medical equipment locations and two LTC pharmacies serving multiple nursing home facilities.\n\nHe has achieved success based on an inclusive, motivational approach that values innovation and elevating others, says NuCara CEO Brian Wegmann.\n\nJohnsrud authorized NuCara pharmacies to participate in pilot programs that advance pharmacy practice, and he innovated the tech check tech program that freed up pharmacists to provide more direct patient care. He continues to enhance health care through the Iowa Pharmacy Association and other industry organizations.\n\nIt brings him joy to bring everyone to the top with him, says Pamela Wiltfang (08BA, 12PHR, 12MPH), director of clinical services and innovative practice at NuCara. T.J. always puts family, friends, colleagues, employees, and patients, first.\n\nA lauded alumnus and constant champion of the UI College of Pharmacy, Johnsrud has served as a guest lecturer, donor, and advisor. He shared ideas and support for the development of the new pharmacy building and currently serves as chair of the Executive Leadership Board. The college honored him with distinguished alumni and lifetime achievement awards.\n\nJohnsrud is a pillar in his profession and an alumnus who advances the careers of Hawkeye pharmacists while improving health care nationwide.\n\nBob Mitchell is renowned across Iowa for his human resources expertise as well as a lifetime of volunteerism to UI alumni organizations, Kiwanis, and other endeavors near and dear to his heart.\n\nMitchell is president of Bob Mitchell and Associates, a human resources and management consulting firm. Before that, he was a human resources professional in education and financial services and co-founded a nationally recognized job fair sponsored by Iowas state universities. A longtime member of the Polk County I-Club, Mitchell served on the UI Alumni Advisory Board and Alumni Leadership Council. He was named 1999 Co-Volunteer of the Year for his service.\n\nMitchell has channeled considerable energy into the Des Moines Kiwanis Club for more than 35 years. Most notably, he led a campaign to develop the Kiwanis Miracle League at Principal Parkan accessible facility where children and adults with disabilities can enjoy playing baseball. Opened in 2000, it was the first of its kind in Iowa. It has since hosted hundreds of games at which Mitchell can be found doing whatever requires attention.\n\nBob makes sure every kid on every team in every game feels like a baseball player, says Jeff Pierson, a fellow Kiwanis Club member. He also notes that Mitchell always thanks everyone involved for their contributions to the organization.\n\nMitchell was a Kiwanis Distinguished Governor of the Nebraska-Iowa District, and for his longtime service received the organizations Legion of Honor Award. Mitchell has also supported the West Des Moines Library Friends Foundation and the Society for Human Resource Management. He was inducted into the Iowa Volunteer Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nChuck Swanson, retired executive director of Hancher Auditorium, has had a remarkable influence on the University of Iowa. His 37 years with Hancher elevated it to new heights, even after the loss of its original home. While putting people first, he has cultivated relationships that enrich the arts, university, and state of Iowa.\n\nDuring college, Swanson attended performances at Hancher, which was built in 1972. Upon graduation, he worked in finance before becoming Hanchers business manager in 1985. He was promoted to associate director in 1991, which ushered in a golden era. Swanson began strengthening partnerships to continue bringing world-class artists and innovative programming to the stage. He was promoted to executive director in 2002.\n\nWhen the original building was destroyed in the 2008 flood, Swanson shepherded the organization through the redesign and rebuilding process. The new Hancher opened in 2016 with a celebratory gala, and the house was packed. That is, until the COVID-19 pandemic stunted arts venues worldwide. Swansons solution was to take performances outside and across the statesimilar to a collaborative 2007 Joffrey Ballet venture.\n\nThrough thick and thin, Swanson went above and beyond to ensure people came first, involving others in refining Hanchers role as the largest classroom on campus and a key recruiting tool for the university.\n\nJane Downer worked with Swanson for 25 years. She credits him as one of the UIs best ambassadors for helping all Iowans recognize the contributions the UI makes to our states citizens.\n\nDescribed as a phenomenal leader, caring, courageous, and enthusiastic, Swanson has made an impact that will be forevermore.\n\nA skilled lawyer and business executive with a passion for philanthropy, H. Mitchell \"Mitch\" D'Olier has been advocating for the people of the 50th state for the last 50 years. He also has helped his fellow Hawkeyes by serving as a member of the Iowa Law School Foundation Board of Directors.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Iowa College of Law, the Chicago native became a partner in the Honolulu law firm of Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn, and Stifel, where he practiced tax and corporate law for more than two decades.\n\nD'Olier went on to work as chief operating officer of Hawaiian Airlines and as chief executive officer of Victoria Ward, Limited, and currently is chair of Kaneohe Ranch Company and the Harold K.L. Castle FoundationHawaii's largest private foundation.\n\nHis expansive volunteerism has had far-reaching and positive effects on the state's citizens and ecosystems. The breadth of his service includes reforming real estate policies, restoring coral reefs, fundraising for Hawaii's largest community center, and promoting educational change.\n\n\"Throughout the 25 years I have known Mitch, I've witnessed and admired the quality, impact, and sheer quantity of his community service in Hawaii,\" says Terrence George, president and chief executive officer of the Harold K.L. Castle Foundation.\n\nThanks to a lifetime of exemplary community service, legal counsel, and corporate leadership, D'Olier has demonstrated a commitment to service that may be even stronger than his Midwestern work ethic. He has devoted himself to investing in the communities and causes most important to him.\n\nBob Franklin is a savvy entrepreneur and devoted Hawkeye who has used his business acumen to create connections and inspire philanthropy in the University of Iowa community.\n\nAs a member owner and CEO of Tin Roofa live-music joint based in Nashville, with 21 locations across 14 statesFranklin has donated space for alumni events and used fan engagement to give back to the university.\n\nHis Nashville Tin Roof has been home to the Nashville Iowa Club game watches since 2019, and he has hosted Hawkeye Huddle events for football, women's and men's basketball, and wrestling at many of his other locations.\n\n\"Bob is an outstanding businessman and a true Hawkeye,\" says Steven Miller (76BSPh), past president of the Nashville Iowa Club. \"Through his philanthropy and partnership . . . he has made a tremendous impact on many Iowa alumni across the country.\"\n\nEven when the pandemic was affecting his venues, Franklin continued investing in Iowa by participating in the university's Chat from the Old Cap, a virtual engagement program that helps alumni and friends stay connected to campus.\n\nIn addition, he opened Elray's Live & Dive, which provides high-quality live music in downtown Iowa City, in July 2020and he also is known for inventing the \"High Porch Picnic\" drink, named in memory of Hayden Fry. The beverage comes in a Hawkeye-yellow cup, and a portion of every drink sale goes to Iowa, as do proceeds from the sale of Nashville Iowa Club T-shirts.\n\nThrough his hard work and tireless efforts on behalf of the university, this loyal Hawkeye supporter has helped change lives on campus and beyond.\n\nJoe Gaylord ranks among the nation's most seasoned political consultants and is an accomplished strategist, fundraiser, and educator who has shared his knowledge with thousands of political candidatesand Hawkeyesfor more than 50 years.\n\nHe began his political career right after graduating from Iowa and held leadership roles at both the state and national levels, working with the Iowa Republican Party, the Republican National Committee, and the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nGaylord is best known for spearheading the campaign that resulted in the first Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in 40 years. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich says, \"In the 40 years Joe and I have worked together, he has been cheerful, caring, and relentlessly honest. From 1994 to 1998, he led the political side of everything I did. Together, we led the 1996 campaign, which reelected a Republican House majority for the first time in 68 years.\"\n\nGaylordwho developed the Republican National Committee's Campaign Management College and also founded the American Campaign Academyhas taught at Iowa since 2012. From 2015 to 2020, he served as president of the Alumni Advisory Board for the UI Department of Political Science and he and his wife, Molly, have been generous university supporters, establishing scholarships in 2005 and bequeathing property in 2013.\n\n\"Joe's historic work in national political campaigns continues to influence American politics,\" says Brian Lai, associate professor and chair of the UI Department of Political Science. \"That, combined with his service to the university, are testaments to why he is more than deserving of this award.\"\n\nDonald Gurnett was a pioneer in the field of plasma wave research whose innovative instrumentation captured a profusion of data during more than 30 exceptional space research missions, including Voyager, Cassini, and Galileo.\n\nA scientific scholar through and through, the longtime professor in the University of Iowa Department of Physics and Astronomywho died in January 2022also gave generously to ensure the future of space research at Iowa.\n\nJames Van Allen's discovery of Earth's radiation belts deepened Gurnett's interest in space plasma physics, inspiring him to join Van Allen's research group. Throughout his extraordinary 60-year career, Gurnett went on to establish the field of space plasma wave research, leading a team that developed numerous plasma wave instrumentsincluding one that proved Voyager I had entered interstellar space. He also mentored more than 60 graduate students and authored or co-authored two textbooks and more than 750 publications.\n\n\"Don made tremendous contributions to faculty life, student experience, and research at Iowa,\" says Philip Kaaret, professor and chair of the university's physics and astronomy department.\n\nPhysicists, astronomers, and scientists around the world admire Gurnett, who also was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He and his wife generously established the Donald A. and Marie B. Gurnett Chair of Physics at the University of Iowa in 2015.\n\nNASA senior advisor James L. Green (79PhD), Gurnett's former student, recognized his professor's leadership in international space researchand his dedication to students: \"He advised and mentored an entire generation of graduate students. It is important to recognize his lifetime of excellence and achievements in space science, as well as the service he offered the UI, the planetary science community, and the nation.\"\n\nFarah Towfic has helped fast-track global health care advances, using her leadership skills, determination, and practical experience to develop critical standards for administering COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAs director of chief executive officer operations for United States Pharmacopeia, the independent organization that sets medication quality standards, Towfic has proven her capacity to lead and serve.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Iowa and completing a residency in association management and leadership for the American Pharmacists Association Foundation, the Dubuque, Iowa, native returned to the Midwest to help patients manage their medication therapiesand to improve operations for pharmacies in Wisconsin and Iowa.\n\n\"As a student, Farah's qualities of leadership, and the ability to excite her peers, were evident,\" says Towfic's former employer, Robert J. Osterhaus (52BSP, 12DSC), of Osterhaus Pharmacy. \"At our pharmacy, she not only demonstrated patient-centered clinical skills brilliantly, but also enhanced our use of technology and improved our outcomes.\"\n\nTowfic's relationship-building experiences have been key to her career success. In May 2020, she was assigned to help develop the nation's COVID-19 Vaccine Handling Toolkit, which launched in January 2021. It allows health care providers to maximize doses and efficiently prepare, label, and administer the vaccines, which was particularly crucial during the initial period of limited vaccine supplies.\n\nTowfic, who also volunteered to administer vaccinations, further advances her profession through service and is chair of the UI College of Pharmacy Genesis Advisory Board.\n\nDonald E. Letendre, Iowa pharmacy's dean, is grateful for her support: \"Farah embodies the college's core values by being an enthusiastic and intellectually driven lifelong learner, a highly dedicated patient-care provider, and a professionally engaged citizen.\"\n\nHarold Bradley Jr. was a true Renaissance man. Whether it was his illustrious career as a Hawkeye and NFL football player or his time as an actor, artist, and music sensation, Bradley Jr. succeeded in everything he pursued.\n\nBorn in 1929 on Chicago's southside, Bradley Jr. enrolled at the University of Iowa in 1946 to study art and found mentors in Paul Engle (32MA), founder of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and Helen Lemme (28BA), Iowa City's iconic civil rights activist. While Iowa opened his eyes to the world and shaped his international destiny, Bradley Jr. also faced racial discrimination on campus. He was not allowed to live in the university dorms, and instead, resided in Lemme's boarding house.\n\nBradley Jr. excelled on the field in college and the NFLearning Iowa football MVP honors in 1950 and winning two NFL titles with the Cleveland Browns. The arts, though, were his true calling. Bradley Jr. landed a scholarship to study in Italy and moved to Rome, where he painted and began a career as an actorlanding roles in more than 20 films, including starring alongside Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra. His art studio eventually morphed into a music venue, II Folkstudio, which became a hub for hip culture in Rome and attracted the likes of Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger.\n\nThough Bradley Jr. eventually returned to the U.S. for 19 years to work for the Illinois Arts Council, University of Illinois, and Illinois State Board of Education, he went back to Rome in 1987 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his music venue and never leftbecoming a world-renowned ambassador to the Italian public on Black music styles and culture. Bradley Jr. would go on to record six albums later in his life and sing before individuals such as the Pope and Nelson Mandela.\n\nTed Wheeler (57BA), 1956 Olympian and former Iowa track and field head coach, was his college classmate. He said of Bradley Jr. who died earlier this year: \"From the day I met Harold, it was obvious to me that this man was indeed a special person. Harold's commitment to excellenceto be the best he could bewas an inspiration to all who knew him.\"\n\nA business trailblazer, Sandra Davis has used her leadership position at Goldman Sachs to help chart new paths for women and underrepresented finance graduates following in her footsteps.\n\nAs co-head of global client marketing and communications for the Investment Banking Division in the firm's New York office, Davis helps to amplify thought leadership content and franchise activity for clients around the world.\n\nWhile her 17-year career has involved intense professional demands, Davis helped create a job-sharing position that paved the way for a more flexible solution at Goldman Sachs. \"Sandy is an advocate and a leader in the finance industry,\" says Amy Kristof-Brown, the Henry B. Tippie Dean of the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business.\n\nDavis completed her bachelor's degree at Iowa, with a double major in finance and marketing and a minor in Spanish. She was a member of the Hawkinson Institute for Finance, the Tippie College's undergraduate investment banking program, and maintains a close connection to her alma mater. She serves on its Finance Advisory Council, where she's championed diversity initiativesand she also mentors and recruits students and speaks at campus events.\n\nAfter graduation, Davis spent several years in Goldman Sachs' Equity Capital Markets group, guiding companies through their initial public offerings. She moved to her current role in 2015 and always has made it a priority to meet with Tippie College students.\n\nBrian Richman, a Tippie College professor and director of the Hawkinson Institute of Business Finance, says, \"There is a generation of Iowa alumni who owe, in part, the successful starts of their careers to Sandy.\"\n\nSeung Min Kim (07BS) is an acclaimed national politics reporter in Washington, D.C., who also mentors and inspires journalism and political science students at the University of Iowa.\n\nA White House reporter for The Washington Post, Kim covers President Joe Biden's administration, focusing on its legislative agenda and interactions with Capitol Hill. She previously covered the Donald Trump administration and worked for eight years at Politico, a political journalism media company, where she focused on the Senate and immigration policy.\n\nAn on-air political analyst for CNN, Kim has served as a guest for the National Press Club and appeared on several national television programs, including Face the Nation and Washington Week. She was recognized by the National Journal as one of 50 people changing the game in Washington and is an active member of the Asian American Journalists Association and Washington Press Club Foundation.\n\nThe Iowa City native deepened her interest in politics as an editor and reporter for The Daily Iowan, where she covered the 2004 caucuses. Kim majored in journalism and political science at Iowa and returns to advise students and speak on alumni panels about her experiences. She also serves on the university's Political Science Department Advisory Board, providing guidance to best serve the department's students.\n\nSays Brian Lai, associate professor and chair of the UI Department of Political Science: \"Kim's work has provided a vital service to the people of this country, and she has been a model alum with her willingness to engage our students.\"\n\nJohn S. Westefeld knows all too well the importance of suicide awareness and prevention. A close friend of John's committed suicide many years agoan event that played a significant role in John's career choice.\n\nThroughout his 42-year professional careerincluding 25 years at the University of IowaJohn has been a passionate teacher, scholar, and leader who dedicated his life's work to suicide awareness and prevention. In 1991, he came to Iowa as director of the counseling psychology PhD program.\n\nWhile at Iowa, John was a significant mentorboth personally and professionallyto many doctoral students who have gone on to a wide variety of careers. His mentorship culminated in being awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award in Mentoring by the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP). In both undergraduate and doctoral-level classes, he has taught students about how to work with suicidal patients, how to research the issue, and how to conduct suicide prevention workshops.\n\nJohn has been a national leader in his profession, as well as a community advocate. He has served as president of SCP, written numerous pieces in leading academic journals, and spoken on the topic of suicide and suicide prevention at countless events, training seminars, and lectures. He has also advocated in multiple venues for increased suicide awareness.\n\nJohn retired in 2016 as an emeritus professor and then worked until 2020 in private practice. Today, he continues to stay active in the university and psychological community through a variety of consulting activities, including providing suicide prevention workshops.\n\nDaniel Clay, dean of the UI College of Education, says: \"It is impossible to know how many lives have been saved thanks to John Westefeld and the ripple effect of students he mentored and inspired. John's work in the college and in the community is marked by passion for people, and he has a tremendous legacy of making a difference in the lives of so many.\"\n\nJeff Chapman (79BBA) is a highly accomplished attorney and dedicated civic leader in Dallas, Texas, who gives back to the University of Iowa and his community in numerous ways.\n\nA co-chair of the Global Mergers and Acquisitions Practice Group at Gibson Dunn, he represents private equity firms and public and private companies in diverse cross-border and domestic transactions in a broad range of industries.\n\nChapman is consistently regarded as one of the top mergers and acquisitions lawyers in the country. Chambers USA has recognized him for many years in its most elite \"Band 1\" category, and in 2013, elevated Chapman to \"Star Individual.\" He remains the only corporate lawyer in Texas history to be so designated.\n\nChambers USA reports, \"Chapman is widely acknowledged as the superstar of the Texas corporate legal market and provides clients with service that is truly exceptional in every regard.\"\n\nHe and his wife, Kim Engman Cain Chapman, support the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business, UI athletics, and the Iowa Writers' Workshop. Chapman also established the Gordon Chapman Memorial Athletic Scholarship for men's tennis in honor of his father and the Sheila Rivin Chapman Memorial Scholarship for women's soccer in memory of his late wife.\n\nChapman has served as a civic leader for several organizations, including chairman of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center President's Advisory Board and as coordinator of the Governance Review Task Force for the board of regents at Baylor University.\n\nSays Michael Frankel, an attorney and former colleague: \"Jeff embodies the character traits and values that best reflect all that is good about the University of Iowa.\"\n\nAs section chief and director of dental education at Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines, Iowa, Hayley Harvey (94DDS, 96MS) has been a champion for increasing access to dental care and improving the oral health of underserved populations.\n\nA native of Detroit, Michigan, and daughter of an Army veteran, Harvey came to the University of Iowa and discovered a passion for improving oral health and access to care for at-risk and rural populations. After earning two degrees from Iowa, Harvey—who served for a decade in the Army National Guard—practiced dentistry and later became the dental director for Baldwin Family Health Care. Her clinic provided dental care to at-risk populations in Baldwin, Michigan, which resides in one of the poorest counties in the state.\n\nShe returned to the Hawkeye state as the public health dental director for the Iowa Department of Public Health, which then led her to a position at Broadlawns Medical Center. Harvey has helped Broadlawns establish a new $24 million facility with 22 operatories—six of which are for extramural rotations of University of Iowa dental students. Through her work at Broadlawns, she ensures that future generations of dentists will have a solid understanding of the dental and health disparities facing Iowa's low-income populations.\n\nHarvey is a wife and mother of two daughters, Hannah and Hadley. She is active in many community organizations and serves on the Mid-Iowa Health Foundation Board of Directors. In 2019, Harvey was awarded the University of Iowa Dental Alumni Service Recognition of the Year honor.\n\nPeter Damiano (82BS, 86DDS), one of Harvey's professors from her time at the UI College of Dentistry and Dental Clinics, says: \"She represents all that we would want in a Distinguished Alumni Service Award recipient: passion for her field, a lifetime commitment to using her UI education to help those less fortunate, and a continuing role in educating Iowa's students.\"\n\nJeffrey Parsons (89BA) is a third-generation Hawkeye who is a tireless and passionate advocate for his alma mater.\n\nA native of Burlington, Iowa, Parsons graduated from the University of Iowa in 1989 with a theatre degree, and he credits Iowa for helping him continue to achieve his dreams. In addition to 16 years with United Airlines, he launched IGC & Associates, Inc., in 2007, a consulting firm focused on leadership and organizational development. His firm supports a range of global industriesfrom Fortune 20 to nonprofit.\n\nParsons also has been dedicated to advancing the mission of the Chicago Iowa Club by expanding it beyond game watches—all in an effort to build an inclusive, welcoming network of Hawkeyes in the Chicagoland area. He joined the Chicago Iowa Club Board of Directors in 2018, and after serving as its vice president, he now acts as a club consultant.\n\nAs a Chicago Iowa Club volunteer, Parsons has supported 14 official Chicago Iowa Club event locations through promotions and business development; served as guest speaker for a number of university events in Chicagoland; formed the Women In Business network and has helped build other network groups; led and participated in club business development strategy, outreach, and partnerships; and has coordinated and promoted arts outreach in the city. He also has partnered with the university's more than 60 Iowa Clubs to share best practices for increasing business networking opportunities.\n\nOn campus, Parsons has become an active contributor and facilitator with the Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center within the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business.\n\nSays Lenee Wolf (89BGS), Chicago Iowa Club president: \"Jeffrey is more than a fan or an alum. He's an ambassador to all things Iowa. He lives, breathes, and loves as a Hawkeye should. He embodies Once a Hawkeye, Always a Hawkeye.\"\n\nMark Stinski, PhD, devoted his career at the University of Iowa to the study of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a pathogen that can cause birth defects and infections in the immunosuppressed.\n\nHis laboratory discovered the CMV promoter, a mammalian gene expression enhancer that dictates the fate of HCMV infection. The CMV promoter has been used by research laboratories around the world and by pharmaceutical companies to facilitate high expression of proteins. The first successful therapeutic protein was Rituxan for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nThe CMV promoter patent generated more than $160 million. The patent's royalties helped the UI recruit at least five professors, retain senior faculty members, and establish the Mark Stinski Endowed Chair in Microbiology and Immunology and the Stinski Undergraduate Research Fellowship.\n\nStinski, who published peer-reviewed articles in top journals, was elected Fellow in the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also received the Alexander Von Humboldt Award from Germany and conducted research at the Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology in Erlangen, Germany.\n\nThe success of his teaching and mentoring is evident in his mentees, who have become leaders in biomedical research at academic institutions and biotech companies.\n\nOne of those trainees, Eain Murphy, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at SUNY Upstate Medical University, says: \"Mark instilled a scientific ethic and sense of quality in each of his mentees. This led to a generation of Iowa-trained virologists who have made major contributions to a broad range of scientific fields.\"\n\nA brilliant scientist with the spirit of an entrepreneur, Joseph A. Walder, MD, PhD, has helped everyone from farmers and scientists to physicians and patients thanks to his breakthroughs in biological research. Along the way, he also has inspired colleagues and championed the University of Iowa, where he launched his illustrious career.\n\nAfter earning his MD and PhD degrees from Northwestern University, Dr. Walder joined the UI in 1978 as an assistant professor of biochemistry. He eventually became a full professor and conducted cutting-edge biochemical research that included developing anti-sickling compounds and a hemoglobin derivative blood substitute.\n\nIn 1987, Dr. Walder established Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) through a seed grant from Baxter Health Care, which was interested in his work on hemoglobin and sickle-cell disease. Before selling the company in 2018, he grew IDT into the world's leading provider of synthetic oligonucleotides—or short DNA fragments—that benefit researchers in a range of disciplines.\n\nKnown for his creative solutions in the field of molecular medicine, Dr. Walder's notable honors include CEO of the Year from the Technology Association of Iowa and Entrepreneur of the Year from the Iowa Biotechnology Association.\n\nThough he left the UI in 1994, Dr. Walder remained a loyal supporter of the UI Department of Biochemistry. His company also invested in biochemistry graduate education and donated $1 million to create a sibling play space in UI Stead Family Children's Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nA visionary researcher, innovative thinker, and transformative philanthropist, Dr. Walder embodies the best of Iowa's values. As Charles Brenner, the UI Roy J. Carver Chair and Head of Biochemistry, says, \"Dr. Walder's accomplishments in biotechnology and philanthropy have made him a living legend at the University of Iowa.\"\n\nCori Zarek (01BA, 05JD) is a public interest technologist and lawyer whose role in helping governments maximize technology and strive for greater transparency has taken her to the White Houseand around the world.\n\nAn expert on everything from technology strategies and digital rights to freedom of information, Zarek has worked to transform both government and the private sector. She also has assisted numerous countries in crafting policies related to technology, transparency, and press freedom.\n\nZarek graduated from Iowa with degrees in journalism and mass communication, political science, and law. As an undergraduate, she rose from reporter to editor-in-chief of The Daily Iowan, and after law school, she became a legal fellow for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Washington, D.C. She eventually became that organization's freedom of information director before accepting a role as attorney advisor for the United States National Archives and Records Administration in 2009.\n\nShe joined President Obama's White House in 2013, first as senior advisor for open government and then as deputy U.S. chief technology officer. While there, Zarek helped improved how the federal government uses data and technology to deliver its mission.\n\nIn addition, she led the nation's involvement in the Open Government Partnership, a global collaboration that empowers citizens, combats corruption, and harnesses new technologies. As part of that initiative, Zarek represented the United States at global summits in Mexico, South Africa, and France, and she also traveled to more than a dozen countries to advise on open government and technology. Such efforts earned her induction into the National Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nToday, Zarek is on the faculty at Georgetown University and serves as director of data and digital for its Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation. In that role, she helped create the U.S. Digital Response organization during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also is president of the board of MuckRock, a nonprofit news organization.\n\n\"Cori's name is synonymous with freedom of information and open government,\" says Randy Evans (72BA), executive director of the Iowa Freedom of Information Council. \"She's an outstanding University of Iowa representative and has lived and worked in a manner that combines service, leadership, and humility.\"\n\nAs a superintendent of schools in the suburbs of Chicago, Jake Chung (96BA), has dedicated his career to helping students achieve their dreams. The same can be said for his commitment to students at the University of Iowa. In the two-plus decades since earning his bachelor's degree in elementary education, Chung continues to give back to his alma mater as a mentor, scholarship provider, and leader for the UI College of Education's Advisory Board.\n\nA native of Glenview, Illinois, Chung began his teaching career in Houston before returning to the Chicago area, where he received the state's Sallie Mae First Class Teaching Award. An advocate for marginalized students, Chung became a principal in the Arlington Heights and Schaumburg school districts, then assistant superintendent for personnel and planning for Arlington Heights. This past year, Chung was named superintendent for the Salt Creek School District near Chicago. Chung earned a master's degree and EdD from National Louis University in Wheeling, Illinois, and a second master's from the University of Illinois.\n\n\"Jake is the epitome of compassionate leadership and service to others, paying it forward and helping make our world a better one in which to live, learn, work, and serve.\"\n\nIn 2013, Chung and his wife, Kimberly Dierks Chung (98BA), established the Jake and Kimberly Chung Scholarship at the UI, which is awarded to College of Education undergraduates during their semester of student-teaching. Chung also has served on the former UI Alumni Association's board and is currently chairman of the College of Education's advisory board. In Illinois, he works with numerous professional and community organizations, including the Dryden Place Project, an innovative program he helped create to help disadvantaged Arlington Heights students and their families succeed.\n\nSays Daniel Clay, dean of the UI College of Education: \"Jake is the epitome of compassionate leadership and service to others, paying it forward and helping make our world a better one in which to live, learn, work, and serve.\"\n\nA health care executive who served in the White House, Adaeze Enekwechi (98BA, 07PhD) is widely admired for tackling complex policy challenges and studying how the health system can work for everyone, particularly vulnerable populations.\n\nFrom 2015 to the end of the Obama administration, Adaeze was the White House's associate director for health programs in the Office of Management and Budget, where she oversaw a health budget of more than $1 trillion. Holding what's been described as the government's most important health post, Adaeze was a key policy advisor to President Obama and worked with Congress and the executive branch to implement the federal budget.\n\nAlthough she was less than a decade removed from earning her doctorate from the UI College of Public Health, Adaeze was well-equipped for the high-profile position. She began her career as an analyst at the Congressional Budget Office after completing her master's degree in public policy at another institution. She returned to the University of Iowa to obtain her doctoral degree and went on to work at the University of Chicago School of Medicine, after which she became the associate director for innovation and new product development at Joint Commission Resources in Illinois.\n\n\"Adaeze worked in the White House with integrity and calm in an intense and sometimes difficult environment.\"\n\nAdaeze then became a senior researcher for Health Research and Educational Trust, a Chicago-based arm of the American Hospital Association. In 2010, she moved to Washington to work in health care policy. There, she was a senior analyst for the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the first senior program officer at the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and a managing consultant at the Lewin Group, where she led several payment policy evaluation and research projects for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nSince leaving the White House, Adaeze has returned to the consulting world. She's currently president of IMPAQ International, a $100 million policy research and technology firm in the Washington, D.C., area that helps governments, businesses, foundations, nonprofits, and universities enhance their programs and policies. She also is a member of the National Academy of Medicine's Emerging Leaders in Health and Medicine group, and she serves on the Board of Public Health Institute and other advisory boards.\n\n\"Adaeze worked in the White House with integrity and calm in an intense and sometimes difficult environment,\" says Shaun Donovan, former director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"I never saw her lose her cool despite enormous stakes, and her intelligence and knowledge always made a difference.\"\n\nGeraldene Felton, dean emerita of the University of Iowa College of Nursing, is highly celebrated as a national trailblazer in nursing research and education.\n\nRaised in Philadelphia, she joined the U.S. Army Nurse Corps in 1949 and rose through the ranks to become deputy director of the nursing division at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. In 1975, she discharged from the Army as lieutenant colonel and began a new career in nursing education. In 2018, the UI honored her military service with the Hawkeye Distinguished Veterans Memorial Award.\n\nFelton came to the UI in 1981 to serve as professor and dean of the College of Nursing. She retired in 1997, though she remained a leader for various national nursing education and research organizations. Among her many accomplishments as nursing dean were starting the college's PhD and nurse anesthesia programs, strengthening ties with the UI Hospitals & Clinics, and building a research-based culture.\n\n\"Because of Dean Felton, our facultyand nurse researchers across the countryhave been able to carry out programs of research that have significantly improved the health care of so many individuals across Iowa and beyond.\"\n\nAnn Marie McCarthy (90PhD), professor and associate dean for research and scholarship at the College of Nursing, says, \"Because of Dean Felton, our facultyand nurse researchers across the countryhave been able to carry out programs of research that have significantly improved the health care of so many individuals across Iowa and beyond.\"\n\nFelton continues to invest in the College of Nursing through her longtime support of the Nursing Progress Fund and by establishing the Geraldene Felton Graduate Student Scholarship Fund and Geraldene Felton Student Success Center. Recognized in 2000 as a \"Living Legend\" by the American Academy of Nursing, Felton had made enduring contributions to her field that will undoubtedly influence generations of future nursing students and professionals.\n\nA career naval officer, aide to the 38th president of the United States, and CEO of three corporations, Howard Kerr (60BA) is a leader through and through. Beyond his military and business accomplishments, he continues to lead through service to his community and his alma mater, the University of Iowa.\n\nA Des Moines native who earned two master's degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Kerr served for 21 years in the U.S. Navy during the Cold War and Vietnam eras. He commanded the USS Hawkins and USS Kinkaid, was commodore of Destroyer Squadron 33, and received the Bronze Star with combat valor and eight Vietnam combat-era awards. In 1973, Kerr was assigned to the White House staff of Vice Presidents Spiro Agnew and Gerald Ford, where he served as an advisor on defense and national security issues. The following year, he became naval aide to President Ford and executive assistant to the counselor of the president. When Kerr left the White House, Ford awarded him the Legion of Merit Medal in an Oval Office ceremony. Kerr retired from the Navy in 1981 and became president and CEO of Custom Technologies Corporation and two other Chicago-based corporations. He also was a board member of Van Kampen and InVesco Mutual Funds and served on the Marrow Foundation.\n\n\"His intelligence, integrity, and communication skills have been the essential tools in his effective management of the most important resources in any organizationits people.\"\n\nKerr was active in civic service, including serving as mayor for three terms in Lake Forest, Illinois. Now a resident of Lake Bluff, Illinois, he regularly returns to the UI to lecture in the Department of Political Science and work with students. He has been a member of the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dean's Advisory Board and was the 2016 recipient of the UI's International Impact Award. Kerr and his wife, Patricia, have established a scholarship for the Iowa Writers' Workshop.\n\nThe late Navy admiral E.R. Zumwalt once wrote of Kerr: \"His intelligence, integrity, and communication skills have been the essential tools in his effective management of the most important resources in any organizationits people.\"\n\nDavid J. Skorton, president and CEO of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and former president of the University of Iowa, is one of the nation's most ardent champions of the sciences, arts, and humanities. Throughout his distinguished career in medicine, higher education, and government, he has advocated for the support of education and the arts as a wise investment in the success of the country.\n\nSkorton began his affiliation with the UI in 1980, serving over 20 years on the medicine and engineering faculty. A board-certified cardiologist, he co-founded the UI Adolescent and Adult Congenital Heart Disease Clinic, one of the first in the nation. His pioneering research on cardiac imaging and image processing continues to influence the cardiology field.\n\nRespected for his tremendous vision and insight, Skorton was appointed the 19th president of the UI in 2003. During his presidency, Skorton set Iowa on a path of innovation that included revitalizing the International Writing Program and implementing the Year of the Arts & Humanities and Year of Public Engagement.\n\n\"David remains a true leader and representative of all that is treasured in higher education.\"\n\nSkorton's quickness to grasp complexity, assemble effective teams, and inspire action make him a highly sought-after leader. In 2006, he left Iowa to assume the presidency of Cornell University. Then, in 2015, he was appointed the 13th Secretary of the Smithsonian, where he oversaw 19 museums, 21 libraries, the National Zoo, numerous research centers, and education programs. In July 2019, he became president and CEO of the AAMC, which represents the nation's medical schools, teaching hospitals, and academic societies. Skorton also is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, as well as a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nBringing integrity, authenticity, and generosity to all his endeavors, Skorton embodies the core values of Iowa. As John C. Keller, dean of the UI Graduate College, says, \"David remains a true leader and representative of all that is treasured in higher education.\"\n\nWhile Nancy (77BA, 80JD) and Craig (75JD) Willis have practiced law for more than three decades, their avocation is community service. Deeply committed to two cornerstones of the University of Iowa's missionhealth care and the artsthe Willises have transformed the campus and surrounding community through their involvement.\n\nThe real estate attorneys, who recently merged their Willis & Willis law firm and Security Abstract Company with Meardon, Sueppel & Downer law firm in Iowa City, are particularly passionate about ensuring a vibrant future for the UI Stanley Museum of Art. They have lent their unwavering support and wise counsel to help the museum establish a new permanent home following the 2008 flood. As members of the Stanley Museum of Art's Elliott Society, the Willises have exhibited leadership on the museum's Members Council and the advisory, green campaign, envisioning, and building campaign committees.\n\n\"Iowa City is a significantly better place because of their generosity and commitment to both our community and our university.\"\n\nThe couple's faithful service to the university extends to areas such as Hancher, Iowa Writers' Workshop, and several university presidential and dean search committees. Since 1992, Nancy has brought her keen business sense and fundraising expertise to the UI Foundation Board, including as part of the development committee and For Iowa. Forever More. campaign cabinet. The couple also belongs to Friends of UI Health Care, a volunteer group dedicated to providing greater access to health care, where Craig serves on the leadership council.\n\nBeyond campus, the Willises have joined the board of directors for many local organizations, including the Iowa City Community School District, Iowa City Public Library Foundation, Iowa City Parks and Recreation Commission, Iowa City Hospice, Johnson County United Way, and UNESCO City of Literature. They also have made significant contributions to area arts organizations and received many volunteerism awards over the years.\n\nAs Cathy Zaharis (82BBA), chair of the UI Center for Advancement board of directors, says, \"Iowa City is a significantly better place because of their generosity and commitment to both our community and our university.\"\n\nNicholas Colangelo is an innovative leader whose many contributions have advanced the university and the field of gifted education in significant ways.\n\nColangelo arrived at the University of Iowa in 1977 and quickly established himself as one of the earliest voices and leading experts in the emerging field of gifted education. As the result of extensive outreach to educators, the Connie Belin and Jacqueline N. Blank International Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development was established in 1988, with Colangelo named as its founding director. Through his effective leadership, the center has grown to serve the needs of thousands of students and hundreds of educators. Colangelo's scholarship may be best known through the internationally acclaimed report, \"A Nation Deceived: How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest Students,\" which has been translated into nine languages and downloaded more than 150,000 times with greater than four million hits to the website.\n\nColangelo dedicated his entire professional career to the University of Iowa and has served in various capacities, including on faculty senate and the Presidential Committee on Athletics. He served with distinction as dean of the UI College of Education from 20122016. As emeritus dean, Colangelo continues to represent the university as an active donor and advocate.\n\n\"Nick leaves things much better than he finds them,\" says UI College of Education Professor Debora Liddell. \"We are a better university because of his love and commitment.\"\n\nHear from Nicholas\n\nJay Daniliuk (99BBA) is at the forefront of the U.S. government's efforts to fight poverty and hunger in Africa. In his current position as private sector advisor in the Bureau for Food Security at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Daniliuk is working to make sure famine is a thing of the past.\n\nDaniliuk's seven years at the USAID build upon a series of distinguished positions in the private, public, and international sectors. After a successful career in advertising, he took the unusual step of giving up his career on Madison Avenue to serve as a Peace Corps volunteer in Togo, a tiny country in West Africa.\n\nThis experience changed his personal goals. After completing a master's degree in foreign service at Georgetown University, Daniliuk moved into a career in the federal government with a specific bent toward agencies who serve developing nations. In his current role, he travels the world to help build and maintain partnerships related to food production and distribution.\n\nThe work has taken Daniliuk to more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and he has been recognized for its creativity and impact by the U.S. government, foreign donors, and international nonprofit organizations.\n\n\"Jay's journey is still unfolding,\" says Kristi Ragan, DAI Chief of Party for the USAID Invest Project. \"His commitment to service will continue to make a difference for the invisible poor whose voices we don't hear on a daily basis.\"\n\nHear from Jay\n\nKelly Ortberg (82BSME) is a visionary and an accomplished business leader who gives back to the university, community, state, and nation in many ways. As CEO of Rockwell Collins, Ortberg's primary goal was to accelerate the company's growth, which he has done organically and with a major acquisition. Under his leadership, Rockwell Collins has been added to the Forbes 500 list with more than $5 billion in annual revenues; has been named one of \"America's Best Largest Employers\" by Forbes magazine two years in a row; and is the only aerospace and defense company named as one of the \"World's Most Ethical Companies\" by the Ethisphere Institute.\n\nOrtberg is a strong supporter of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. He takes every opportunity to encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue STEM careers. As a key member of the University of Iowa College of Engineering Advisory Board, he helped double undergraduate enrollment with ideas to attract and retain the highest quality students.\n\nHis work to advance economic development across Iowa and the country can be seen through the considerable time and energy he devotes to building a STEM-skilled workforce and elevating the nation's global integrity.\n\n\"Mr. Ortberg is the epitome of an Iowa success story,\" says Debi Durham, director of the Iowa Economic Development Authority. \"He is someone who has persevered to advance his company, his community, and the people around him.\"\n\nHear from Kelly\n\nStephen E. Corbeil, 84MA, is an innovative leader of hospitals and health care systems who has charted a stable course through the industrys turbulent changes.\n\nDuring his distinguished careerwhich began with a role as chief executive officer of a 137-bed regional referral center, just five years after his graduation from the University of Iowa College of Public Healths master of health administration programCorbeil has earned a reputation as an inspiring mentor and forward-thinking executive.\n\nFor more than 25 years, he has successfully managed multiple health care organizations in numerous cities and states. He has held senior management positions with Tenet Healthcare in St. Louis and the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) in Nashville. In December 2016, he retired as president of TriStar Health, a division of the HCA comprised of 22 hospitals, nine ambulatory surgery centers, and 275 employed physicians in Tennessee, Georgia, and Kentucky. He now serves as a consultant with HCA, primarily engaged with its executive development program.\n\nFundamental changes sweeping the health care arena have required health systems like those under Steves direction to develop new business and patient models, says Sue Curry, the UIs interim provost and dean of the College of Public Health. Amid the changes and challenges, Steve has been a steady and strategic guide for the health systems he has served.\n\nSuch guidance included the creation of new business and patient-care models; the integration of patient populations and technologies; and the expansion, renovation, and consolidation of facilities in the various communities served.\n\nAlong the way, Corbeil has stayed true to his Hawkeye roots. He is deeply connected to his alma mater, serving on the alumni board for the UI College of Public Healths Department of Health Management and Policy from 2000 to 2012 and receiving the colleges 2011 Outstanding Alumni Award. He has been active on the colleges campaign committee, and he and his wife, Mary Kay, generously established a fellowship fund for deserving UI master of health administration students.\n\nCorbeil is passionate about nurturing tomorrows health care leaders. Not only was he instrumental in developing the HCAs executive leadership development programs, but he also has been a professional and personal mentor to many UI health management and policy studentsand a preceptor for summer interns and post-graduate fellows.\n\nA familiar HCA saying is that good people beget good people, says R. Milton Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of the Hospital Corporation of America. This is clearly evident in Steves mentorship of young leaders.\n\nCorbeil also gives back to his community. A fellow of the American College of Health Care Executives, he has served on numerous boards and service organizationsincluding the board of trustees for Tennessee State University in Nashville, the Governors Foundation for Health in Tennessee, the Federation of American Hospitals, and the American Hospital Association.\n\nWith great insight and compassion, Stephen E. Corbeil has helped transform our nations health care system and ensured patients well-being for years to come.\n\nCorbeil is a member of the UI Alumni Association and the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nPhilip R. Currie, 62BA, brought the news to life for countless readers, thanks to his cutting-edge work in the field of journalism and mass communication.\n\nFrom his earliest days as editor of the University of Iowas student newspaper to his later years as senior vice president of news in Gannetts U.S. publishing division, Curries journalistic integrity made him a pacesetter for an entire industry.\n\nPhil brought forward-thinking practices to the often arcane world of journalism, insisting on professionalism, accuracy, and honesty, says Michelle Foster, president of Media Management and Marketing and a former colleague of Curries. He strongly believes that a newspapers content should reflect the communities it serves, in all their rich diversity.\n\nThroughout his four decades in the business, Currie pushed for positive changes in news reporting. His emphasis on quality journalism in local communities brought ethical reporting to the fore, and he established criteria for ensuring that newsrooms embraced diversity in their hiring practices.\n\nSuch values stem back to his UI educational experiences, which shaped his exemplary career. I learned the basics of good journalism while attending Iowain classes and on the Daily Iowan, says Currie. That foundation has served me throughout my career and provided me with the direction to support ethical and balanced reporting and editing.\n\nAn esteemed journalist, Currie directed the coverage of the Attica State Prison riots in Attica, New York, which led to two reporters from the Rochester Times-Union winning a 1971 Pulitzer Prize. Later as a corporate news executive, he went on to craft a pioneering ethics policy for the Gannett newspaper division that prohibited the use of unnamed sources (except in rare circumstances). This policy was the first of its kind in corporate newspaper journalism and became a model for similar policies at other news organizations. Currie also helped lead the transition of Gannett newsrooms from a print- to digital-first emphasis until his retirement in December 2008.\n\nCurrie is a staunch defender of the First Amendment, and this commitment has driven his many personal and professional accomplishments. Not only did he focus on fact-based and watchdog journalism during his years with Gannett, but he also has been deeply involved with the Newseum Institute. A national organization based in Washington, D.C., the institute promotes, explains, and defends free expression and the five freedoms of the First Amendment. Currie was appointed to its board of trustees in 2016.\n\nIn addition, Currie chaired the American Society for Newspaper Editors diversity committee and has served on the advisory boards for the Morgan State University School of Global Journalism and Communication in Baltimore and the Penn State College of Communications. He is also a member of the professional advisory board for the UI School of Journalism and Mass Communication, where he established a student scholarship and was instrumental in raising money for a new facility. The school inducted him into its hall of fame in 2014.\n\nWith a passion for strong news coverage, a deep commitment to diversity, and an unwavering belief in First Amendment responsibilities, Philip Currie has made an indelible mark on the nations rich journalistic tradition.\n\nCurrie is a member of the UI Alumni Associations Old Capitol Club and the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nSteven Davis, 01BS, 03MS, developed a groundbreaking software program for his masters thesis that served as the foundation for a thriving company enabling advanced life science research.\n\nThe journey began at the University of Iowa, where Davis, the president and co-founder of Bio::Neos, got his professional start. He received academic all-Big Ten honors as a member of the Hawkeye mens gymnastics team and worked as a research assistant in the College of Engineerings Coordinated Laboratory for Computational Genomics.\n\nAs a student, Steve was brilliant. His raw intelligence set him apart from his peers from the first time I met him, says Thomas Casavant, who was Daviss UI professor and advisorand now is his business partner. He started conducting research in high-performance computing, machine intelligence, and genetics while still an undergraduate, and by the time he finished his masters degree, his thesis software embodied solutions to myriad problems in human genetics research.\n\nThis complex and integrated software system, TrAPPS, lets clinicians and human genetics researchers sift through billions of pieces of information to discover genomic variations that account for hundreds of blinding eye diseases. It also allowed Davis to launch a successful business venture. I like to create things, whether that means software to help researchers, new jobs, or my business itself, he says. Im motivated to create things that improve our world.\n\nDavis and his partners, who won the John Pappajohn New Venture Business Plan competition in 2003 and the Storer Entrepreneurial Business competition in 2004, established Bio::Neos, in the Bedell Entrepreneurship Learning Laboratory (BELL)14 years ago.\n\nToday, their companywhich is located in the BioVentures Building on Iowas Oakdale Campuswrites customized software that allows life sciences companies to analyze large volumes of data. David Conrad, the UI assistant vice president for economic development, says, Steves work is very valuable to researchers inside the University of Iowa and at biotechnology companies across the globe.\n\nNot only does Bio::Neos benefit researchers, but it also helps students. His firm regularly recruits UI graduates for both internships and full-time positions, and Davis was a charter member of the College of Engineering young alumni advisory board and currently serves as a member of the College of Engineering advisory board.\n\nDavis has shared his story with thousands of UI entrepreneurial students; judged numerous student business plan competitions; and mentored students in the BELL, the UI Venture School, and the Student Accelerator. In addition, he was the main instructor in the Dev/Iowa Bootcamp, a foundational web application development course. He also finds time to teach STEM Innovator curriculum as a Tippie College of Business adjunct lecturer, as well as to serve as an officer of the Hawkeye Endurance Athletic Team, a nonprofit triathlon club that he co-founded.\n\nThrough his leadership, hard work, and inspired thinking, Steve Davis has helped pave the way for the game-changing innovators and entrepreneurs who will follow in his footsteps.\n\nDavis is a member of the UI Alumni Association.\n\nNancy Frank Hauserman, 76JD, spent more than three decades at the University of Iowa as a leader and scholar who invested in worthy causes, created new opportunities, and helped change students lives.\n\nThe retired professor, associate dean, and ombudsperson has had a profound effect on the university in all her roles. Throughout her years on campus, she exemplified what it means to be a mentor, an innovator, a feminist, an academic, and an activist.\n\nAfter finishing law school and working in the legal field, Hauserman accepted a position as a lecturer and visiting professor in what is now the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business. She became a full professor in 1995 and also took on various leadership roles in the university, including as associate dean of the colleges undergraduate business program. Though she retired in 2013, Hauserman still teaches MBA students in Hong Kong and Italy.\n\nA strong believer in the importance of undergraduate education, Hauserman was instrumental in developing a number of student-focused programs at Tippie, including the Hawkinson Institute for Business Finance, the Tippie Early Admission Program, the Tippie Senate, and the Tippie Young Alumni Boardwhich became a model for other UI colleges.\n\nAmanda Miller, a 2002 UI business graduate, worked closely with Hauserman as a student in establishing the young alumni board. Miller remains close to her former professor: I trust her advice. She never tells me which road to take, but instead helps me evaluate the options so I can be confident in my own decision. My hope is that, one day, someone will admire and respect me as much as I do Nancy Hauserman.\n\nUI graduates such as Miller also have Hauserman to thank for launching the Judith R. Frank Business Communication Center. Named in honor of Hausermans mother and funded by her father, this centerone of the first of its kind in the nationhelps undergraduate students improve their writing and public speaking skills.\n\nSuch innovative contributions extend beyond the Tippie College of Business. Hauserman also used her expertise in the areas of whistleblowing, women and employment law, and business ethics to play a pivotal part in several research projects for the universitys Council on the Status of Women, which gathered data about incidences of sexual harassment on campus.\n\nAdditionally, she was a fellow of the UI Center for Human Rights and served on the Diversity Review Task Force, the Year of the Arts and Humanities steering committee, and the national steering committee for the UI Foundations Good. Better. Best. Iowa. fundraising campaign. She currently serves as president of the UI Retirees Association.\n\nFor her commendable work at Iowa, Hauserman has received such accolades as the Michael J. Brody Award for Faculty Excellence in Service, the Jean Jew Womens Rights Award, and the Hancher-Finkbine Medallion.\n\nKarla Miller, former executive director of the UI Rape Victim Advocacy Program, for which Hauserman was a volunteer emergency advocate and board member, says Nancy strives to live her life by the tenets she teaches others.\n\nAn extraordinary teacher and role model, Nancy Hauserman has helped shape a new generation of business leadersand an improved University of Iowa community.\n\nHauserman is a life member of the UI Alumni Association and a member of the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nDan Gable is a gold medal-winning Olympic wrestler and former University of Iowa multinational championship head coach who has dramatically elevated American amateur wrestling by becoming the sport’s greatest ambassador.\n\nAfter going to the mat in Munich in 1972 and famously taking the gold without surrendering a single point, Gable accepted a job as an assistant wrestling coach at the UI. This decision launched his career as the most successful head coach in American collegiate history.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1997, Gable led the Hawkeyes to 15 NCAA national wrestling titles and 21 Big Ten championship titles. During those years, he coached 152 all-Americans, 45 national champions, 106 Big Ten champions, and 12 Olympians.\n\n“When you finally decide how successful you want to be, you’ve got to set priorities,” says Gable. “In 25 years as a head coach and assistant, I think I might have missed one practice. Why? Because practice was my top priority.”\n\nThis ethos guided Gable’s work as an Olympic head coach on three different occasionsin 1980, 1984, and 2000. His 1984 Olympic team, which featured four Hawkeye wrestlers, won seven gold medals. He also served as head coach of the World Team for six different years.\n\n“The UI has been blessed with many outstanding faculty, staff, and students who have been national, and even international, icons in their endeavors,” says UI Athletics Director Gary Barta. “Such is the case with Dan Gable and wrestling. He stands in his own class.”\n\nGable has been the subject of several ESPN and HBO documentaries, and has been named to the U.S.A. Wrestling Hall of Fame, the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, and the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. In June 2002, President George Bush appointed him to the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.\n\nRecent accolades include being named top wrestler of the 20th century by Gannett News Service and one of ESPN’s top coaches of the 20th century. In 1996, Gable made the list of “100 Golden Olympians,” which honors the top 100 U.S. Olympians of all time, and during the 2012 Olympic Games, he was inducted into the elite FILA Hall of Fame Legends of the Sport. In 2015, Gable added New York Times best-selling author to his impressive résumé with the publication of his memoir, A Wrestling Life: The Inspiring Stories of Dan Gable. From his childhood in Waterloo to the pressures of the Olympic stage to coaching the Brands brothers, Gable offers an intimate glimpse into his personal lifeincluding the people and experiences that shaped his indomitable, resilient spirit.\n\nWhen the International Olympic Committee decided in 2013 to drop wrestling as one of the core sports of the 2020 Olympics, Gable was instrumental in reversing the decision later that year.\n\n“Dan Gable’s name works magic in many circles and carries with it his enduring association with the University of Iowa,” says Mike Chapman, a former sports editor of the Gazette in Cedar Rapids.\n\nThanks to Dan Gable’s uncompromising talent and grit, both on and off the mat, Iowa’s most successful coach has become a legend in the world of wrestling.\n\nKevin Gruneich, 80BBA, was able to attend college thanks in part to others generosity, and now he uses his own Wall Street success to help hundreds of University of Iowa students pursue their dreams.\n\nKnown as one of the top publishing analysts in the world, Gruneich retired in 2004 from a senior leadership role at the Bear Stearns Companies. However, he remains actively engaged in private business ventures and serves on several corporate and philanthropic boards. He and his wife also administer the Kevin and Donna Gruneich Charitable Foundation, which focuses on education, religion, and environmental protectionand on helping the underprivileged.\n\nThe Park City, Utah, resident, who earned an M.B.A. degree in finance from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, got his start in finance and industrial relations at the UI. The undergraduate years are so important, he says. What one experiences, learns, and practices during college is key to attaining life goals.\n\nThis belief is what has inspired Gruneich to help open doors for students at Iowa. The Gruneichs foundation helped fund the UIs new business hub, a study center now under construction at the Henry B. Tippie College of Business. For the past 11 years, Gruneich has also been instrumental in underwriting the Iowa Edgea program that provides orientation, programming, community building, and counseling support for Iowas minority and first-generation college students.\n\nLike Kevin Gruneich, I did not have any big advantages growing up, says Jose Diaz, a student at the Tippie College of Business, who graduates this year and will work for J.P. Morgan Chase & Company. With the help of the Iowa Edge program, I submerged myself in the UIs wonderful culture and became heavily involved with student organizations. My parents, who never went past the sixth grade, still cant believe the strides that one generation in our family has made through the help of Iowa and Kevin Gruneich.\n\nGruneich has helped students such as Diaz attend college and has inspired a new generation of philanthropically minded graduates. Gruneich played a key role in launching and underwriting the Fundraising and Philanthropy Certificate Program in the UI School of Journalism and Mass Communication. This program, one of the few undergraduate philanthropy studies programs in the nation, helps students from all majors prepare for careersand leadership rolesin the nonprofit sector.\n\nI am just beginning to return the investment others have made in me, Gruneich explains. I believe the students I help will eventually be there to help others, creating a virtuous cycle that will improve the university, the state, and society as a whole.\n\nIn addition to his work in nurturing and mentoring students, Gruneich also has been a member of the University of Iowa Foundations board of directors since 2006 and serves on its investment committee.\n\nIn all that he does, both personally and professionally, Kevin Gruneich demonstrates a deep understanding of the power of philanthropyand the importance of paying it forward for University of Iowa students.\n\nGruneich is a life member of the UI Alumni Association and a member of the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nJames Jim P. Hayes, 64JD, has tirelessly pursued a vision to keep renowned American Gothic artist Grant Woods legacy alive at the University of Iowaand far beyond.\n\nA highly regarded attorney and passionate arts advocate, Hayes has dedicated himself to ensuring a better understanding of, and appreciation for, Iowas most famous artist. And Hayess quest has brought a vital community back to life on the UI campus.\n\nThe Grant Wood Art Colony grew out of Hayess purchase of a house at 1142 East Court Street in Iowa City in 1975. This landmark residence was Grant Woods home while the artist was on faculty at the University of Iowa, and as Hayes worked to restore the historic property, he began to imagine a way to honor Woods Iowa Idea of connecting studio artists and art history scholars.\n\nIn partnership with the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the School of Art and Art History, Hayes turned his brainchild into reality in 2011, and today, he serves as chair of the colonys national board of advisors. The Grant Wood Art Colony nurtures creative work and teaching in disciplines associated with Wood, including studio and performance art and art history. It brings Grant Wood Fellowsartists-in-residenceto the School of Art and Art History, the Department of Theatre Arts, and the Department of Music, and it also hosts a biannual Grant Wood symposium and state outreach efforts.\n\nThis community of artists and scholars has become a major force, with artistic energy and global reach, says Sean OHarrow, who is the former director of the UI Museum of Art and current director of the Honolulu Museum of Art.\n\nTo help ensure a lasting home for the colony, Hayeswho envisions a vibrant cultural hub of interconnected living quarters, studios, and gardensplans to bequeath his residence and its four surrounding properties to the university, upon his death. It is my wish that it be a cultural center a living place of activity, of people talking and doing things and meeting one another, says Hayes. Thats what it is now, and thats what Id like it to continue to be.\n\nHis path from UI student to benefactor included roles as the Iowa deputy commissioner of public safety and as the first director of the Iowa Crime Commission. He also worked with Meardon, Sueppel, Downer, and Hayes before going on in 1999 to establish his own firm, Hayes Lorenzen Lawyers.\n\nThroughout these career changes, Hayes has remained deeply invested in Iowa. He serves on the universitys Realizing Educational and Career Hopes (REACH) advisory board, which helps students with cognitive and intellectual disabilities learn to live independently. He also has filled multiple volunteer roles for the UI Museum of Art, serving on its advisory, building, and envisioning committees, as well as on its members council.\n\nLike the artist and UI faculty member who inspired him, Jim Hayes has used his time and talent to create a vibrant artistic community here that will enrich the student experience for generations to come.\n\nHayes is a member of the UI Alumni Associations Old Capitol Club and the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nNancy J. Humbles, 97MA, has been a strong advocate for diversity and equity at the University of Iowa, and she helped forge new paths for students of color and other underrepresented groups on campus.\n\nAs the founding creator and retired director of the UI Center for Diversity and Enrichment, Humbles was instrumental in establishing programs that provide a welcoming climate for students, faculty, and staff from marginalized communities. She also fostered meaningful personal connections with students who were navigating the ins and outs of college for the first time.\n\nNancy had a keen ability to connect with individual students, says John Laverty, a senior associate director of the UI Office of Admissions. She helped them succeed, and she took many of them under her wing, without fanfare, to help them maximize their personal potential and keep moving forward each day.\n\nSuch guidance came naturally to Humbles, who earned a masters degree in student development in postsecondary education from the UI College of Education while working at Iowa.\n\nShe first joined the UI in 1990 as an academic planning counselor in Special Support Services and then as an advisor in the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business. As the assistant director of advising at Tippie, she developed the Student Incentive Program, a summer program for minority and first-generation students. She also served as multicultural affairs coordinator and interim program coordinator for Opportunity at Iowa.\n\nIn 2007, Humbles became the director of the UI Center for Diversity and Enrichment. That is my favorite UI memory because it validated all of my hard work, she says. In this role, she coordinated outreach opportunities and resources for underserved students from diverse backgrounds, including students of color, first-generation college students, and students from low-income families.\n\nTevin Robbins was one such studentand credits Humbles with helping to shape who he is today. Robbins was an Advantage Iowa Scholar and a single-parent student at Iowa; now he is the assistant director for student leadership development at Tippieand he says Humbles made that possible. The impact she made on my life could never be repaid, says Robbins. She pushed me to pursue graduate school, and she even persuaded me to join her in her field, serving college students.\n\nSince retiring from the UI in 2015, Humbles has widened her reach as a community volunteer. She was elected as the first African American to serve on the Cedar Rapids Community School District Board of Education in 2009 and was re-elected in 2013. She is president of the Area Substance Abuse Council, volunteers on the United Way Healthy Solutions committee, co-chairs the African American Museum of Iowas History Makers Gala, and serves as the finance chair at Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church in Cedar Rapids. Humbles also previously co-chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Freedom Fund Banquet and served as a board member for Four Oaks in Cedar Rapids, president of the Jane Boyd Community House in Cedar Rapids, and president of the UI African American Council.\n\nThrough her steady guidance and unwavering belief in personal potential, Nancy Humbles has helped countless University of Iowa students achieve their academic dreams.\n\nPhillip O. Mayberry, 67BSIE, is a true Hawkeye, through and through, and he has channeled his passion for the University of Iowa into a lifetime of good works on its behalf.\n\nWhen Mayberry first arrived on the UI campusfollowing in his siblings footstepshe made a conscious decision to take full advantage of the student experience. He attended everything from football games and lectures to dances at the Iowa Memorial Union. He also worked in the residence halls and in his fraternity house to help cover the costs of attending the UI College of Engineering.\n\nAfter graduating from Iowa with a degree in industrial engineering, Mayberry landed a position as a sales engineer with Fisher Controls Company, and he later joined Emerson Process Management in Marshalltown, Iowa. Though he recently retired from Emerson as vice president of sales-marquee accounts, he continues to work part-time for the company as director of customer events.\n\nMayberrys early lessons in networking and engagement are what keep him so involved with the university now. He has been on the UI College of Engineering advisory board since 2000 and was a key member of its enrollment management committee, which helped the college dramatically increase its numbers. Mayberry also plays a key role in helping recruit new students to the college.\n\nPhil is consistently a positive and enthusiastic supporter of the university and collegeand a tremendous ambassador, says Robert E. Kress, a partner at Accenture who chairs the UI College of Engineerings advisory board. When students are considering Iowa for engineering, he is supportive and explains the strengths of the college. He has maintained relationships with many of these students he helped recruit, and he provides career guidance and mentoring.\n\nNot only does Mayberry serve as a mentor for students, but he also helps some of them attend college, thanks to the Phillip O. Mayberry Engineering Scholarship for deserving undergraduate students from the state of Iowa.\n\nHis commitment to supporting new Hawkeyes extends beyond the College of Engineering. Mayberry is an avid fan of UI athletics, and as the longtime president of the Marshall County I-Club, he has organized many large annual spring banquets and inspired two of his friends to establish fully endowed scholarships for Hawkeye student-athletes.\n\nIn addition, Mayberry has secured generous sponsorship support for the Polk County I-Club Senior Dinner in Des Moinesan annual event that helps Hawkeye student-athletes connect with business leaders from throughout the state. He is also a past member of the UI Alumni Associations board of directors.\n\nSuch efforts earned Mayberry the 2004 Volunteer of the Year Award from the National I-Cluband a recent nomination to the National I-Club board of directors. Phil is one of the most animated Go, Hawks cheerleaders for student-athletes, coaches, and the entire Hawkeye nation, says Alec Scranton, dean of the UI College of Engineering. He has defined the very meaning of service for his alma mater.\n\nFrom one-time student to successful volunteer, Phil Mayberry has helped ensure that the University of Iowa remains a vibrant and welcoming place.\n\nMayberry is a member of the UI Alumni Associations Old Capitol Club and the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nVince Nelson is an enthusiastic University of Iowa champion who shared the Hawkeye spirit with countless alumni and friends during his 26 years at the helm of the UI Alumni Association (UIAA).\n\nUnder his leadership, the UIAA thrived, growing its membership to an all-time high of more than 52,000 and introducing programs that reflected Nelsons deep passion for Iowa. Although he spent 20 years at Drake University in Des Moinesfirst as a student and then as a faculty member and director of alumni relationsNelson devoted the bulk of his career to the UI, and he was its loyal promoter.\n\nIn 1997, UI President Mary Sue Coleman appointed Nelson as executive director of the UIAA, following his 18-month stint as interim executive director. Vince was the kind of leader who was enormously important for a strong and effective association, says Coleman. He worked to reflect the voice of the alumni, but he also clearly understood that the university has many constituencies.\n\nNelson found innovative ways to connect with these many groups. When he joined the UIAA, its IOWA Clubs did not yet exist; however, within months, he had helped establish several in Iowa and surrounding states. Today, the clubs are among the most popular of the UIAAs programs, celebrating the Hawkeyes in 53 U.S. cities and 15 international locations.\n\nThe familiar slogan, Once a Hawkeye, Always a Hawkeye, which so resonates with Hawkeye fans around the country, can be traced directly to Vince Nelson and his relentless and enthusiastic support for the University of Iowa, says Ron Steele, a past chair of the UIAA board. He always focused on improving the relationship between the university and its alumni.\n\nNelson, whose title changed from executive director to president in 2001, helped usher in a number of new programs and initiatives, including volunteer service trips through Iowa Voyagers and the Students Today, Alumni Tomorrow organization (now known as the Future Alumni Network). He also forged stronger links between the UIAA and its campus partners, including the colleges and UI Athletics.\n\nIn his time at the UIAA, Nelson oversaw the growth of the organizations annual budget from $2.1 million to $3.3 million, and he increased its staff from 18 to 27. The alumni association also won 33 national awards from the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE)including the prestigious CASE national gold medal for overall alumni relationsduring his tenure. Nelson was a member of CASE, Big Ten Alumni Executives, and the Council of Alumni Association Executives (CAAE).\n\nAs UIAA president, Nelson hosted numerous UI Homecoming programs, in addition to a variety of alumni events and Hawkeye Huddles across the country. I valued the opportunity to meet so many wonderful alumni and friends of the university through all of our programs, says Nelson, who retired in 2014. I will always be proud to wear the black and gold and to embrace the history and heritage of this great institution.\n\nThrough his energy, humor, and hard work, Vince Nelson ensured that the UI Alumni Association was a trusted partner for the University of Iowaand a true friend to legions of Hawkeye fans.\n\nNelson is a member of the UI Alumni Associations Directors Club Honors Circle and the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nMargaret Peg OConnor Stessman, 84BS 12MBA, has used her nursing skills and hard-won business acumen to create a company that combats fraud and waste within the Medicare and Medicaid system.\n\nThe savvy entrepreneur is founder, CEO, and chair of StrategicHealthSolutions, a business that was born in 1997 and came fully to life in 2005. Today, Stessman has grown her firm to encompass two locations, in Nebraska and Maryland, and 250 employeeswith revenues of $40 million.\n\nStessmans start-up success began with her nursing degree at the University of Iowa, which set her on the path to a career as a nurse and hospital administrator. She eventually took on the role of a quality assurance administrator for the state of Nebraska, overseeing its Medicaid Managed Care Program, and went on to join IntegriGuard in 1999, moving up through its ranks to become CEO.\n\nHer decision to launch a business prompted Stessman to return to her alma mater for an MBA degree. The two-time UI graduate is also a loyal Hawkeye athletics fan dedicated to both of her colleges. She is a member of the Tippie Advisory Board and offers critical counsel to the Henry B. Tippie College of Business dean. Says Stessman: Receiving a portion of my education from Tippie, and now having a hand in guiding its future, is a great honor for me.\n\nStessman has created hands-on projects for students in the MBA Business Solutions Center and has spoken to both UI business and nursing students. She was the keynote speaker at the 2012 Women in Business Leadership Conference, as well as a panelist at #TippieWomen Summit.\n\nPeg provides generous financial support to both of her UI colleges, but for the CEO of a successful start-up company, time is more valuable than money, says Tippie Dean Sarah Gardial. Pegs true measure of loyalty to the UI is her gift of engagement.\n\nThis ability to connect with and mentor others is one of Stessmans greatest talents. Not only does she apply it in her own business, establishing a CEO Chat program that allows employees to meet with her informally, but she also uses it in her many civic roles. She is deeply involved with the Omaha Salvation Army Kettle Club and served on the board of directors of the Nebraska chapter of the Entrepreneurs Organization (EO).\n\nPegs willingness to share both her accomplishments and struggles has helped the business owners in our forum, says Chris Andersen, EO member and SunCo president. Being an entrepreneur can be a lonely job, but Peg made me feel like I wasnt alone.\n\nStessman also knows how to rally others to worthy causes. She and her husband, Dennis, have established a trust that matches employee donations to the charities of their choice. To date, more than 100 charities have been supported through this program. She has served on the Salvation Armys Tree of Lights Cabinet, participates in the Salvation Armys Adopt-a-Family program, and donated jerseys to a local basketball team.\n\nWhether she is supporting local initiatives, giving back to her alma mater, or working alongside colleagues, Peg Stessman brings the best of both her UI degrees to the business of being a leader.\n\nStessman is a member of the UI Alumni Associations Old Capitol Club and the UI Foundations Presidents Club.\n\nV.C. Patel is a world-renowned engineering professor who profoundly influenced the field of fluid mechanicsand the lives of his University of Iowa students.\n\nBorn in Kenya and educated at London and Cambridge Universities, Patel arrived at the UI in 1971 and quickly established himself as one of the leading experts in hydraulics and computer simulation. He became a full professor in the College of Engineering in 1975, and his expertise in boundary-layer theory, turbulent shear flows, wind engineering, and ship hydrodynamics helped Iowa take the lead in solving crucial fluids-engineering problems.\n\nThroughout his four decades on campus, Patel also filled a number of important administrative roles during critical junctures in the colleges history. He was the departmental officer of mechanical engineering, director of the Center for Computer Aided Design (CCAD), director of IIHRHydroscience and Engineering, and chair of the Engineering Faculty Council.\n\nHis most significant of these positions was his directorship of IIHR, a highly regarded center for education, research, and public service focused on hydraulic engineering and fluid mechanics. During a decade of leadership, Patel implemented many forward-looking changes.\n\nV.C. ushered IIHR into the 21st century, says Larry Weber, IIHRs current director. He also oversaw the creation of a new research station on the Mississippi River and initiated a study-abroad class, International Perspectives in Water Resources Planning. His changes laid the groundwork for the broad-based, diverse research that now characterizes IIHR.\n\nIn spite of his many administrative duties, Patel still found time to work closely with students, and he supervised 32 doctoral students who completed their degrees. His former graduate students have filled the campuses of the most prestigious universities worldwide, says Karim Abdel-Malek, UI engineering professor and director of the Center for Computer-Aided Design. The most extraordinary and remarkable observation is that V.C. has remained in touch with almost all of his previous students.\n\nPatel is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, as well as a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Society of Engineering Education, and the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. He has authored or co-authored four books and more than 200 publications, and has presented at nearly 200 lectures and seminars. He was a United Nations consultant in India from 1992 to 1994, and in 1995, he was a USAID consultant to Egypt.\n\nSuch accomplishments earned Patel numerous awards and honors, both off campus and on. He became a UI Foundation Distinguished Professor in 1990 and the Edwin B. Green Chair in Hydraulics in 2000. He also received an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Civil Engineering in Bucharest, Romaniaamong many international honorsand was one of three UI recipients of the 1994 Iowa Regents Faculty Excellence Awards. He retired from the UI in 2007.\n\nA quintessential academic leader and mentor, V.C. Patels globally important work has guided aspiring engineers and enhanced the University of Iowas distinguished reputation.\n\nRosebud Roberts, 90MS, is a highly regarded scientist whose pioneering research in the field of dementia and mild cognitive impairment could benefit millions worldwide who suffer from such conditions.\n\nThe professor of epidemiology and neurology and chair of the division of epidemiology has spent more than 20 years at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, but she began her career far from there, in her home country of Ghana. She earned a medical degree from the University of Ghana Medical School in 1982 and then completed a masters degree in preventive medicine and environmental health in 1990 at the University of Iowa.\n\nRoberts work has had a profound impact on clinical care and national decision-making related to aging and cognitive impairment. She studies how specific diseasessuch as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, heart disease, and high cholesteroland dietary habits might affect the risks of developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia.\n\nAnything that is worth doing is worth doing well, she says. Im driven by a desire for my research to make a difference in people's lives.\n\nA highly published scholar and dedicated mentor, Roberts has been author or co-author of more than 160 peer-reviewed publications and has influenced the careers of numerous graduate students, research and clinical fellows, and junior faculty. She has served as a reviewer for several medical journals and has presented at dozens of national and international meetings. In addition, she has served on study sections of the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, as a member of the American Academy of Neurology Science Committee, and as associate editor of the Journal of Alzheimers Disease.\n\nColleague and fellow physician Ronald Petersen has worked with Roberts since 2004, when she joined the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging as its epidemiologist. He says that she was instrumental in the design of the study protocols, and her continued involvement has been crucial to the overall success of the study. Her work is highly respected and frequently cited by investigators in the field.\n\nSuch impressive contributions have earned Roberts recognition throughout her career. In 1981, she received the University of Ghana Medical School Award for an elective in internal medicine at the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. She was the recipient of the Kellogg Fellowship at the UI in 1989, and in 2015, she received the UI College of Public Healths Outstanding Alumni Award and also was inducted into the Delta Omega Honorary Society in Public Health.\n\nBeyond such professional accolades, Roberts also is an active member of her local community. She acted as a Rochester, Minnesota, facilitator for the American Anthropological Associations project RACE: Are We So Different? and routinely presents her own research to seniors in the area.\n\n[Roberts] humility and scholarly attitude make her a role model for all of us, says Peterson. She is a prime example of the type of scholar one expects from the University of Iowa.\n\nFrom Ghana to the Midwest, Rosebud Roberts has found meaningful ways to enhance medical scholarship, and she continues to conduct first-rate research that can dramatically improve peoples lives.\n\nRoberts is a member of the UI Alumni Associations Old Capitol Club.\n\nDoug True, 71BS, has a head for numbers and a steady hand, and he used these talents to expertly guide the University of Iowa for 27 yearsmost notably through the devastating flood of 2008.\n\nThroughout his exceptional career, True played a crucial role in managing the universitys finances and advising four presidents and three interim presidents. He also provided leadership and counsel to thousands of UI employees and helped new collegiate deans effectively navigate the campus culture.\n\nThere was no better employer than the UI, says True. Where else can a person serve students, patients, and faculty, all in one place?\n\nHe managed to do all of thatand moreduring his UI tenure. After graduating from Iowa with a degree in chemistry, True earned a masters degree in business administration from Drake University. He then worked for the Board of Regents, State of Iowa, before returning to the UI campus in 1988 as treasurer. True quickly rose to the position of vice president for finance and operations in 1991 and senior vice president and university treasurer in 2005.\n\nFor Doug True, stepping onto campus always felt like coming home, says UI Foundation President Lynette Marshall. He eagerly anticipated each new project and relished the opportunity to advance the university through innovative initiatives.\n\nThis was especially true of his work in the aftermath of the flood of 2008, one of the most challenging economic periods in UI history. He was instrumental in helping to rebuild campus and partnered closely with insurers, as well as state and federal officials, to advance major building renovations and replace those facilities damaged by the floods.\n\nDoug earned the deepest respect from his colleagues during the crisis of the flood in 2008, says P. Barry Butler, former UI executive vice president and provost. His subsequent oversight of the recovery has resulted in the UI having one of the finest campuses in the country.\n\nTrue also helped guide the UI Foundation, becoming a charter member of the joint UI and UI Foundation development committee and serving on the search committee for UI Foundation President Lynette Marshall. He is a generous UI philanthropist, and following his retirement in 2015, the chemistry department named its buildings entrance in his honor.\n\nAfter his retirement, True accepted a special one-year assignment as an advisor for UI flood recovery and investments. This position allowed him to assist university leaders in transition.\n\nDoug has provided the UI with decades of fiscal integrity, informed vision, essential continuity, and unmatched commitment, says UI President Emerita Sally Mason, who worked closely with True during Iowas flood recovery efforts. He has deep institutional knowledge, a sharp mind, and wise counsel.\n\nThanks to his innate wisdom, financial acumen, and exceptional loyalty, Doug True helped the University of Iowa flourish during a time of grea"
