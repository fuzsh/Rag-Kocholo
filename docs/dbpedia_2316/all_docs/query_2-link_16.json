The first priest was Father Grace. The building erected there was of logs, about 24x40 feet in size, and was in existence until 1886, when it fell down. It was used as a church until 1859, when the foundations of the present brick building in Pacific were laid by Father Miller, then of Kirkwood, Mo., who attended this church as a mission for a number of years. During the war the Union soldiers, in erecting a fort for protection against the rebels, commenced the demolition of the foundations of this church building, seeing which an old lady, named Mrs. Kennedy, went to the officer in command and made such earnest protestations against the work of destroying the foundations of the church that he ordered it discontinued. The church building was completed in 1867, on the foundations thus saved, by Father E. Berry.

At the time of the organiza­tion of this committee it was agreed to have a picnic for the benefit of the building fund, which was held on July 4, 1867, Thomas Tobin and Henry Williams being the committee to col­lect the tickets at the dinner. The total receipts of the picnic, it was learned August 1, were $864.15, and the net proceeds $443.10. The building fund was further augmented by dona­tions in sums of various size, the larger donations being as fol­lows: Father E. Berry, $100; Bleckman & Co., $51; Dr. Calkins, $52; William Donohue, Edward Henry and James William, each $50; Daniel Kennedy, $40, and John Burns, Daniel Donohue, James Devine, J. M. Anlt, Phil.

His work has been the building up of the parochial school, which he established in 1885. The building is a frame one 28x44 feet, and cost about $1,500, and the furniture cost $400. At first the school was conducted by two Ursuline Sisters from St. Louis, but at the present time it is in charge of two Sisters of St. Francis, of Manitowoc, Wis. About fifty-five children are in attendance. The parsonage was erected by Father Stemker.

The pastor of this church was educated at high schools in Germany, and completed his theological studies at the Evangelical Lutheran Ooncordia Seminary, at St. Louis, Mo. He served as missionary in Nebraska from 1868 to 1881, organizing in that State twelve congregations, in nine different counties, these congregations each now having their own pastors.\n\nGerman Evangelical Protestant St. John's Church, is situated two and a half miles north of Union.

Meetings were held for some time at his house, but in 1846 a log church building was erected, which was used by the congre­gation until 1875, when the present church edifice was erected on the same site as that occupied by the log building. It is a fine brick building with a stone basement, the lower story being used for school purposes. The cost of the structure was $3,300, and the pipe-organ therein cost $425. For the first ten years of this church's existence it had frequent changes of ministers, but from 1853 to 1883 it had but one ministerthe Rev. Fred Mantels. He was succeeded by the Rev. John Simons, and he by the Rev. Joseph Gruess, neither of whom remained long. The present pastor, the Rev. Albert Muecke, commenced his labors here in October, 1886. The school connected with the church was established at the same time with the church. It has now an attendance of from thirty to forty pupils, and is taught by the pastor, the German language being used in the school.

A brick church was erected in 1858,at a cost of $6,000, which was dedi­cated by Rev. E. M. Marvin, afterward Bishop Marvin, in 1859. During the war the building was occupied by the Union soldiers, by whom the records of the church were destroyed, hence the paucity of information regarding the originators of the church itself. Previous to the war, however, Washington had been a preaching point for several years, and during this time the pres­ent commodious church edifice was built, mainly through the liberality of William A. Lack. The membership before the war never exceeded ten or twelve. The pastors have been since the war: Revs. J. E. Godbey, E. F. Chew, B. K. Thrower, J. E. Tredwell, E. T. Tidwell, S. W. Emory, S. A.

In October, 1884, a meeting of the members was held to consult in reference to the building of a church, and a building committee was appointed, consisting of Dr. William J. Dunn, E. M. Peck and L.

It was dedicated by the organizer of the church, Rev John Meyer. The pastors have been the Revs. John Meyer, H. Brinkmeyer, John Wanner, John Aslink, Henry Faust, Henry Diener, Henry Flotminn, Henry Schlueter. This church had its origin from the following circumstances: Rev. Benjamin Link, a Presbyterian and a schoolteacher, while engaged in his profession as teacher, was, on several occasions, invited to the homes of his patrons to hold prayer-meetings in the evening. On such occasions the neighbors would come in to spend the evening. Among them were members of the Evangelical Church. The preacher of this church was much displeased and complained bitterly; and when one of his church members, P. Schmidtkamp, died, the remains were refused admittance into the church. Upon this refusal Rev. John Meyer mounted the wagon on which lay the corpse and paid the last tribute of respect for the dead. Feeling their religious freedom outraged by the pastor of the Evangelical Church, those who had attended the prayer meet­ings of Rev. Benjamin Link came together and organized the Salem Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nZion Methodist Episcopal Church was organized about the year 1843, by Rev.
