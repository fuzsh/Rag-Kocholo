The Green Team wanted to help educate students and community members about environmental concerns and reduce negative environmental impacts in Rockport. The group fundraised, purchased and constructed a greenhouse with participation of community members. Since the greenhouse construction, the project has grown tremendously, engaging students and community members on sustainable agriculture. The team has grown vegetables locally in order to reduce the waste and pollution from transporting food. This project also has given students the opportunity to learn how to plan a garden, plant vegetables, maintain plants, and harvest produce, all while using sustainable practices. NO chemical pesticides have been used on the plants; instead students find environmentally friendly ways to control pests, such as using beneficial insects and hand soap. During the school year, the produce was given to our school's cafeteria and used in school lunches. During the summer, the students sold the produce, as well as starter plants, to the community at the local farmers' market where they engage with community members on a variety of environmental topics and help them start their own gardens. Also, at the farmers' markets, they educated the community about some solutions to the problems facing our environment and how to use sustainable practices to lead by example. They distributed educational materials in order to spread the word about environmental stewardship. The students educated community members on single-use plastics and were involved in the process of the town-wide adoption of a single-use plastics ban. One of the Green Team's primary goals was to help our community learn to become more environmentally conscious by connecting our project to the community, which this project has accomplished.\n\nEPA Region 2\n\nBridgewater Raritan High School Green Infrastructure Team\n\nBridgewater Raritan High School\n\nTeam Members: Sujay, Pravar, Amogh, Aneesh, Ritika\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFive students from Bridgewater High School discovered a stormwater runoff problem on their school grounds. After extensive research, they concluded that the creation of a rain garden would be an effective way to fix the flooding problem and prevent pollutants from entering the nearby Raritan River. They involved elementary, middle, and high school students in the development of the rain garden, creating an outdoor science laboratory for students in the school district. In 2019, the rain garden treated 3,950 gallons of rainwater. The students are in the process of planting 600 bulbs to keep the rain garden going in 2020. This project significantly improves the environment for students, teachers, and members of the surrounding community.\n\nEPA Region 3\n\nEffective Repeated Filtration of Amoxicillin from Wastewater Using Activated Charcoal Filters\n\nby Lea W.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLea is a 10th grade student who during the summer of 2019, was granted the opportunity to conduct research through the Teen Research and Education in Environmental Science (TREES) program on “Effective Repeated Filtration of Amoxicillin from Wastewater Using Activated Charcoal Filters”.\n\nAntibiotics from human and animal consumption have increasingly polluted drinking water, enabling bacteria and fungi to develop resistance and rendering some illnesses increasingly difficult to treat. However, many wastewater treatment facilities do not employ existing remediation technologies because of high costs, so an effective, economical filtration option is needed. This study investigated the efficacy of the repeated use of activated charcoal (an inexpensive, scalable alternative) in filtering a common amoxicillin-class antibiotic from water.\n\nThe TREES program is funded by a National Institute of Health grant and run by Dr. Jeffrey Field, a Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. Through this program, Lea had an opportunity to work on independent research projects with high school mentors and graduate students; as well as sit in on lectures from esteemed professors regarding human and animal consumption of antibiotics through drinking water.\n\nTREES made it possible for her to visit several local wastewater treatment plants prior to her experimentation to learn about the treatment process. Lea was also fortunate enough to sit in on a meeting of the Chester County Environment Alliance to learn about their different initiatives, which range from implementing new reporting systems, to testing cutting-edge prototypes, to organizing protests. It was on these trips that she learned from professionals in the field about the many shortcomings of the wastewater treatment process, including its inability to filter pharmaceuticals, as well as the high costs of more advanced technology. It was through these interactions that she conceived the idea to research low-cost antibiotic filtration.\n\nEPA Region 4\n\nGo Green - Holiday Action\n\nWe Sense Youth Team\n\nTeam Members: Bo, Yichen, Ayden, Savannah\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFour high school students, Bo, Yichen, Ayden, and Savannah from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, started their journey on raising environmental awareness in the community two years ago. After succeeding in a variety of community learning projects such as e-cycling and upcycling programs, they decided to engage the community with “Go Green - Holiday Action” year-end project. Aiming to solving the problem that public knowledge and actual practice about recycling was limited, the team set out to spread awareness and promote actionable solutions through a series of community-engaging holiday-themed events incorporating technology and interactive activities. The project impacted more than 700 participants with fun curbside recycling quizzes, creative applications of over 100 pounds of recycled materials in artistic exhibits and crafts, and a homemade app, EcoEye, which utilizes AI-Vision to classify various wastes and their recyclability. These activities helped respond to the increased production of waste in the holidays and the urgency to reduce waste at source, reuse and recycle when possible. Participants were encouraged to reflect on the effects small choices had on their lifestyles. By holding these events at three prominent locations, the team successfully implemented the project with the support of more than 10 community partners and a team of more than 20 volunteers. More than 1000 holiday recycling crafts were made and taken home by the participants to continue the inspiration and impact. The various components of the project helped make recycling more attractive to the community. The team is planning on hosting similar events in future seasons on different themes.\n\nZach’s Planet\n\nby Zach H.\n\nFlorida\n\nZach, age 9, launched Zach's Planet, in hopes of promoting reuse and upcycling in his community and helping kids and homeless pets in need. In the past two years, he's run numerous book drives in schools, organizations and sports clubs and collected more than 20,000 used books and donated them to Title 1 Schools and Little Free Libraries in 12 states. Zach also partnered with a non-profit organization, Glad Dogs Nation, who upcycles used stuffed animals and creates pet toys for shelter pets. Zach collected over 800 unwanted stuffed animals and transformed them into lovable squeaker toys. He donated them to many shelters in 3 states. On top of that, Zach also ran uniform drives within his Cub Scout Pack and donated dozens of clothing items to the local council so other kids can enjoy them. Zach got the idea to create Zach's Planet when he was asked to take out the trash as a 7-year-old. He saw many items in the trash can that could be used again. He began collecting books, stuffed animals and toys and getting his Cub Scout Pack, Humane Society Kids Club and Martial Arts Studio involved along with some of his teachers and the local library. His efforts of kindness were featured in Woman's Day Magazine and recognized by his district Boy Scout office. Zach has saved over two tons of reusable items from going into landfills, saved over 800 trees by promoting reuse and encouraged over 100 people to help him in his efforts to save the planet. Each year, he's dedicated over 100 hours to community service. He spreads his message on his website, ZachsPlanet.com, and through his Facebook page and YouTube channel where he highlights his efforts and promotes ways everyone can help the environment though small acts of kindness.\n\nEPA Region 5\n\nPop Tab Pandemonium\n\nby Brayden C.\n\nIllinois\n\nBrayden is a 10th grader from Minooka, Illinois. When his sister was in a serious bike accident 14 years ago, Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) provided support to Brayden and his family. To thank RMHC and to give back, he decided to participate in their long-running Pop Tab program. In 2015 he launched Pop Tab Pandemonium with the help of local sponsors. This annual event gives the local community an opportunity to recycle their cans and have some fun.\n\nIn addition to recruiting volunteers among students and his 4-H Club to place recycling receptacles around the community, he assists his local school district with a competition to see which grade can collect the most pop tabs. Brayden has gone beyond the idea of only recycling pop tabs to include aluminum can recycling more broadly. Because of his project Brayden is on the lookout for aluminum cans and pop tabs wherever he goes. Through his efforts he has raised more than $20,000 for RMHC and recycled over 15 tons of aluminum. The funds he raises help RMHC pay the bills so moms and dads don’t need to worry about where they will stay while their children are in the hospital.\n\nEPA Region 6\n\nFresh Hub\n\nTeam Members: Shirley Z. and Annie Z.\n\nTexas\n\nIn April 2018, with the goal of reducing food waste and eliminating food deserts, Shirley Z. and Annie Z. co-founded Project Fresh Hub. After five months of hard work on planning and preparations, they established collaborations with Second Serving of Houston, Trader Joe’s, Slow Dough, Breadman, and the Houston Health Department. In November 2018, the Fresh Hub market made its debut at Sunnyside Multi-service Center. Ninety volunteers from three local schools picked up excess food from grocery stores and bakeries, sorted them out, and re-distributed them in the food desert regions in Houston. As of December 2019, thirteen Fresh Hub market events have been held; 8000 lbs of food (worth $8000) were saved from dumpsters and almost 1100 community members received food and services at no charge. As more than 90% of the food distributed at Fresh Hub markets are perishable produce and bread, a quick turn-around is the key to reducing food waste. To address this challenge, Fresh Hub mobile app was developed to announce Fresh Hub food distribution events and promote healthy eating habits. Fresh Hub won first place in Human Services at the Future Problem-Solving International Conference, the app won the 2019 Congressional App Challenge and received a Special Congressional Recognition from TX-09 District.\n\nThe 3R Project\n\nby Prince N.\n\nTexas\n\nPrince is ten years old and has been actively involved in environmental projects since he was seven. He understands the importance of waste management and how it impacts our planet. After conducting a community survey in Frisco, Texas, Prince was shocked to learn that only 27% of the population recycle and that 68% are confused about what to recycle. He also learned that the United States was shipping millions of tons of waste to China and that, starting 2018, China would no longer accept shipments of waste. With this awareness, Prince decided to find a way to make recycling easier to help solve the waste management challenge. He developed a mobile application called “3RApp”. Using this mobile application, not only can citizens find recyclability of a product using QR code/barcode scanning, but they will also be able to learn ways to reuse the products and methods to reduce waste. The app can also be linked to smart devices, like dust bins, to open the right compartment based on recyclability of the item. City officials and the University of North Texas (UNT) have recognized the efforts of and great potential in this young man through a city declaration and a full scholarship to University of North Texas.\n\nEPA Region 7\n\nSee a Bloom, Give it Room\n\nKickapoo Nation School Environmental Club\n\nTeam Members: Nash, Natasha, Sophia, Gabriel, Adriana, Vincente, Kismet, Caitlin, Savannah\n\nKansas\n\nKansas Students from the Kickapoo Nation School’s Environmental Club conducted a program that began with researching and responding to the questions “How is climate change affecting the Kickapoo Nation?,” and “How they could meet the needs of people and wildlife” The students specifically looked at the environment in and around the Delaware River (their drinking water source). Students conducted an impressive list of activities in response to this question, which included:\n\nMade 5 short films discussing what to do if you encounter an algal bloom,\n\nPlanted 160 trees to stabilize the bank and reduce soil run-off into the river,\n\nPlanted native milkweed in order to become a migratory butterfly weighing station,\n\nEducated their community regarding water quality, including restoring a trail and an awareness walk.\n\nThese students have been recognized for their work by the Native Youth Adaptation Leadership Congress and attended a training in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.\n\nEPA Region 8\n\neBatsMT\n\nBigfork High School Cave Club\n\nTeam Members: Ryan C. and Colten W.\n\nMontana\n\nMontana Student members of the Bigfork High School Cave Club decided that they wanted to create a system of recording bat populations for the entire state of Montana's caves. The reason for creating this online recording system was so that cave managers and agencies will know how bat roosts have been affected after White Nose Syndrome (WNS) makes it to Montana. White Nose Syndrome (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) is a disease that affects hibernating bats by increasing their levels of energy usage throughout winter hibernation. Therefore, it exhausts the bat and kills it. Normally the nose of a bat will be tinted with a white fuzz. WNS has been confirmed in 33 states and is quickly spreading closer to Montana. The website Ryan and Colten created, eBatsMT, uses web applications from ArcGIS online that are editable by approved cavers who gather data while visiting caves and upload their information to the website. It serves as a connection between cavers and cave managers who need this valuable data. Their website also includes information on cave stewardship as well as a \"How-to\" form on collecting data. Right now, the website has 10 web apps uploaded and the future goal is to include most every cave that serves as a bat hibernaculum in Montana. The purpose of this project was to unite the caving community around bat conservation as well as to encourage stewardship in caves. It has been successful so far, but Ryan and Colten hope to further grow the site and number of users by giving a presentation at a caving convention later this year.\n\nEPA Region 9\n\nSustainable Food Systems\n\nby Nikita B.\n\nArizona\n\nAs a volunteer with the nonprofit Arizona Sustainability Initiative, Nikita Bharati leads two projects involving Arizona students in learning about regenerative local food systems by creating and using high-tech gardens in their classrooms.\n\nNikita’s innovative projects have reached more than 2,000 Arizona students, who are learning about environmental sciences and sustainable food systems by using technology to grow healthy foods, harvest and eat them, all in the classroom.\n\nFood Tech for the Future: Growing Digital Farmers introduces high schoolers to “food computers” by building a chamber with robotics to control climate, energy and plant growth to raise vegetables. Nikita has successfully piloted this at Glendale High School. Students learn about biology, water efficiency, genetics, and technology. They are encouraged to study food technology and global food needs.\n\nNikita’s Vertical Garden, for middle and elementary grades, takes a similar approach in 16 schools located predominantly in Maricopa County’s “food deserts,” where fresh produce is lacking. The Vertical Garden mimics ground-breaking methods used by pioneering urban agri-tech startups.\n\nThese hands-on projects combine STEM and environmental education. For Nikita, they are part of her leadership in the local chapter of Girl STEMpowerment, helping bridge the gender gap in tech by inspiring girls to study STEM.\n\nFor the Love of Frogs - The Parallel Projects\n\nby Justin S.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWhen Los Angeles third-grader, Justin, learned about declining frog populations, he was inspired to create a youth initiative program called “For the Love of Frogs.” Justin raised money for frog conservation organizations, organized cleanups at a local wetland preserve and raised awareness through art and community outreach.\n\nOn Earth Day 2019, an African environmental science student, Perise, contacted Justin to ask what he could do with thousands of plastic bottles he had collected. Justin reached out to his network for ideas and received dozens of upcycling suggestions from around the world. Justin shared his network’s suggestions with Perise and then put these ideas to work himself in California. Perise did the same in Cameroon, and, in the end, they transformed nearly 8,000 bottles into works of art, planters, and other items.\n\nThese ideas, known as the “Parallel Projects,\" became a daily and weekly collaboration. Justin continued this work to initiate an intercontinental collaboration of students in a series of projects involving plastic waste. Participants work in parallel, in their own countries, sharing methods and results with the goal of inspiring others and raising awareness of worldwide plastic pollution.\n\nEPA Region 10\n\nP.O.P. – Promote Our Pollinators\n\nby Anna D.\n\nAlaska\n\nThe Promote Our Pollinators (P.O.P.) program was designed by Anna, a 9th grader with the Connections Homeschool Program in the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District, Alaska, to educate her community about the importance of pollinators and why their numbers are declining. She shared ways to promote pollinator population growth and inspire the next generation to be good stewards of their natural resources. She created a flier, activity book, website, Facebook page and Twitter account to educate the community. Anna has held P.O.P. “make and take presentations” in schools, libraries and other community venues; and she distributed P.O.P. promotional items, such as reusable tote bags and plant stakes, around the community.\n\nAnna has designed Pollinator Packs containing six different pollinator friendly seedlings to encourage population growth. The packs provide “rest stops” and food sources for pollinators, so they can travel across large urban areas to expand their colonies. She is in the process of creating online and in-class educational curricula based on the P.O.P. concept for elementary students. All these activities have increased her community’s awareness of pollinators.\n\nAnna received a grant from the Alaska Chapter of the Awesome Foundation to help with expenses. She won 3rd place in the Caring for the Kenai competition and has been recognized as a State Merit winner for the annual 3M Young Scientist Challenge.\n\n2019 Winners\n\nEPA Region 1:\n\nGeneration Growers\n\nIpswich Middle & High Schools' Green Team\n\nTeam Members: Ava B., Ella B., Lila B., Claire B., Amelia C., Madeleine C., Beckett D., Teaghan D., Colby F., Isabelle G., Teddy G., Lydia H., Michael H., Keigan I., Annie J., Carina J., Emma K., Sinead K., Evan K., Spencer M., Lucy M., Addison P., Joey P., Melanie P., Gabby R., Stella S., Brooke S., Ellie S., Natalie W., Olivia W., Nell W.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nThe Ipswich Green Team, composed of students from grades 6 through 12 from Massachusetts, had a vision to develop a partnership between Ipswich schools and the greater community that would enrich the lives of people through local agriculture. The effort, called \"Generation Growers,\" brought elderly adults and other community members together with youth to create green space on a quarter-acre public fruit and vegetable garden. The primary goals for the Ipswich Green Team were to increase community knowledge, exposure, and access to healthy food. They accomplished their goals by learning about and teaching every aspect of food production, including sustainable practices such as water barrel conservation and solar energy, concepts of pollination, and soil science for planting. With this initiative, the Ipswich Green Team increased community participation by encouraging people to go outside, working side by side, and harvesting and eating the fruits and vegetables that were planted and harvested together. The garden continues to be used as an educational resource for teachers and community groups to learn about food waste and production, pollination, climate change, the water cycle, composting, and how to live and work together with the common goal of creating local, healthy food for their community.\n\nEPA Region 2:\n\nLight and Hope for Puerto Rico\n\nby Salvador C.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nSalvador is a 10th grader from San Juan, Puerto Rico. In response to Hurricane Maria's destructive impact on Puerto Rico, Salvador created the Light and Hope for Puerto Rico initiative. The project's mission was to purchase and distribute solar lamps and hand-powered washing machines to the most affected communities on the island. To raise funding for the project, an online crowdfunding platform was launched with a goal of $100,000 that would be used to positively impact the lives of 1,000 families in the coastal town of Loiza, which was decimated by both Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In the end, Light and Hope for Puerto Rico was able to raise over $160,000 and the funds were used to assist 3,500 families in 17 different municipalities around the island. Under Salvador's Light and Hope for Puerto Rico initiative, environmentally friendly products were selected for purchase and distribution, which helped reduce water and electricity consumption. The next phase of the initiative is to implement solar energy systems on firefighting stations across the island.\n\nEPA Region 3:\n\nFriends of the Earth\n\nWyoming East High School\n\nTeam Members: Sebastian B., Hannaha B., Destany B., Zoe C., Myranda G., Emily L., Hailey M., Taylor M., David S., Nathan S., Hailey S., Brenda S., Amy V., Angela V., Bryce W.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nThe Friends of the Earth is composed of 15 students from Wyoming East High School who live in a rural West Virginia community that does not have a landfill or recycling center. The team realized that their community had a large amount of recyclable trash, but there was no place to take it. To address this issue, the Friends of the Earth team created a recycling program at their school to limit the waste. The program began with a collection of aluminum cans and quickly expanded to include Type 1 and Type 2 plastics. To keep their community informed about their project's goals and the environmental impact of municipal waste, the Friends of the Earth created commercials, presentations, flyers, and posters; posted information on bulletin boards; and organized award ceremonies. The students have also set up booths at community events and school \"prep rallies\" to promote awareness and educate residents and students about recycling. As a result of their efforts, Friends of the Earth has recycled 12,296 pounds of trash and 3,000 plastic bags. The team has also successfully distributed recycling bins throughout the community, and team members collect the materials for recycling.\n\nEPA Region 4:\n\nBobcat Up! Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\n\nBelle Terre Elementary School\n\nTeam Members: Ben D., Kayla H., Eva L., Gabriela P., and Sabrina R.\n\nFlorida\n\nStudents from Florida's 5th grade Belle Terre Elementary School identified littering and the lack of recycling bins in some classrooms as an issue at their school campus. To solve this issue, they created Project BURRR: Bobcat Up! Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. As part of this initiative, students take part in weekly BURRR project activities. Once a week, the BURRR recycling team uses their recess time to pick up litter from the school's campus grounds. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, the team collects the recyclable materials from each classroom and takes it to the recycling containers at the back of the school. One day per week, the group meets to maintain the school's park and other areas of the campus. Project BURRR has inspired students at Belle Terre Elementary School to be environmental stewards in their community.\n\nThe Fishes Wishes\n\nby Ryan M.\n\nFlorida\n\nRyan is a 12-year-old from Florida who has been helping keep the ocean clean for seven years. His family often went to the beach where he would find lots of trash along the shore, so he started bringing bags along to pick up the trash himself. While on a trip with his family, he saw some older kids put a tire in the ocean. Ryan read books and learned about how pollution was harming many animals. That is when Ryan started \"The Fishes Wishes\" project. As part of the project, Ryan made magnets and ornaments out of driftwood and sold them at local fairs and shops. He donated all the profits to the Ocean Conservancy. He later wrote a book called, \"Puffy the Pufferfish Saves the Ocean\" and donated all the proceeds to ocean conservation groups. Ryan is currently selling keychains and suncatchers made from recycled wood, stones and natural materials. All the money raised is donated to ocean conservation. As of 2018, he has donated over $9,000 as a result of his dedicated efforts.\n\nEPA Region 5:\n\nRecycling Trailblazer\n\nby Lane W.\n\nOhio\n\nLane, an 11-year-old from rural Ohio, started recycling paper in his 2nd grade classroom. The following year, with the help of a newly created recycling club, Recycling Trailblazer, he expanded recycling to the entire school. He received $90 in donations from parents, which he used to purchase recycling bins. The recycling club also sponsored a student challenge to motivate students to do what they could to have a positive impact in their community and on the environment through recycling. Lane also recruited additional students to continue the club when current members transitioned to middle school. The Recycling Trailblazer was recognized for outstanding achievement by the school superintendent and school board members. Lane is now in middle school himself, where he has a recycling club of more than 40 members. Lane's new vision is to expand the recycling program to the high school and a local church.\n\nAquatic Robotics/Invasive Species Education\n\nBig Stone County 4-H Aquatic Robotics\n\nTeam Members: Robert A., Zakari A., Brooklyn C., James C., Jack D., Arnold J., Ernest J., Kevin N., Carly O., and Kirby O.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThe Aquatic Robotics team is composed of local high school students in Big Stone County, Minnesota with members ranging from 14 to 16 years in age. Their focus and concern for this project was Big Stone Lake which is widely used by the community for fishing and recreation. The team worried that invasive species that had negatively impacted a nearby lake could invade Big Stone Lake and cause harm to the fishery, water quality, and overall use of the lake. To address their concern, the team created the \"Be an Aquatic Superhero, Stop Those Water Hitchhikers\" campaign to reduce the number of invasive species entering the lake. Interested citizens looked at different types of invasive and native species and learned to distinguish the difference between the two types. The team promoted the message of \"Clean, Draining, and Drying\" watercraft to prevent the spread of invasive species and distributed \"Be an Aquatic Superhero\" towels that fishermen used to clean their boats and prevent the spread of invasive species. The team created their own public service announcement that aired 3 times per week for 6 months. Additionally, the team presented information to schools, the local lake association, civic organizations, water festival attendees, and community members. More than 5,000 people have been reached through the team's efforts. Further, invasive species have yet to be found in Big Stone Lake.\n\nEPA Region 6:\n\nHarveyville Recycling Team\n\nA.D. Harvey Elementary\n\nTeam Members: Ahmad A., Reyna B., Marley C., Jayleen E., Jamie G., Sophia G., Evelyn L., Aiden M., Mario S., Zevin S., Kaitlyn S., Estrella T.\n\nTexas\n\nThe children of Harvey Elementary in Texas, also known as \"Harveyville,\" decided to make their campus as \"green\" as possible. To accomplish this, a team of 12 dedicated 3rd and 4th grade students created and managed a recycling center at their school, wrote essays, and gave presentations to peers, parents, and city officials about the life span of materials and the importance of recycling. The students successfully convinced the school cafeteria staff to get rid of disposable trays and other items that added to landfill waste. Additionally, the students persuaded their peers to stop using plastic water bottles and to start using the school's water fountains. They also collected and recycled more than 300,000 plastic bags in the City of Kingsville. In addition to recycling, the Harveyville Recycling Team also created a commercial to further the efforts of the City of Kingsville's \"Keep Kingsville Beautiful\" public awareness effort, and challenged residents to take selfies while recycling to be posted on the City's \"Star Drive\" in Harveyville.\n\nNorthern Bobwhite Quail Reintroduction Project\n\nby Trevor B.\n\nTexas\n\nTrevor's environmental conservation project, Northern Bobwhite Quail Reintroduction, focused on the decline of the Northern Bobwhite Quail population in Texas and their re-introduction into the endangered Texas Blackland Prairies. Trevor discovered that less than 0.01 percent of the world's original tallgrass prairies are remaining and felt moved to save the Texas Blackland Prairie. He began by removing invasive species, planting native grasses, and re-introducing wildlife, such as the Northern Bobwhite Quail, into the Prairie. He chose the quail, because the Texas quail population has declined by 82 percent in the last 50 years - primarily due to the loss of habitat. After consulting with field and academic experts, Trevor learned the science of incubating, hatching and raising quail in his own house. Trevor's vision initially started with one conservation project on one prairie. It has since blossomed into ongoing service and research projects at multiple prairies with national funding on a public platform. He has utilized hundreds of volunteers and dedicated thousands of hours to preserve the Texas Blackland Prairies.\n\nEPA Region 7:\n\nGetting Markers Out of Landfills\n\nby Joslyn S.\n\nNebraska\n\nJoslyn's goal was to prevent markers, highlighters, and dry erase markers from becoming landfill waste. Recognizing a need to recycle the thousands of markers used by students at her school, Joslyn started the Getting Markers Out of Landfills project by partnering with Crayola Color Cycle to get free recycling at her school. As part of her project, Joslyn purchased collection bins with money she earned from doing chores and partnered with teachers at her school to have the collection bins placed in their classrooms. Joslyn decorated the collection bins to generate interest. She frequently checks the bins and counts the markers. Once counted, Joslyn ships the markers to Crayon Color Cycle, where they are recycled into clean- burning fuel. Due to the success of her project, Joslyn has been able to expand the number of collection bins to include two public schools, one private school, a library, a 4-H Extension office, a local moms group, and a local daycare. Since starting the project in October 2017, Joslyn has collected, counted, and shipped 6,331 markers to be recycled, diverting 126.62 pounds of markers from the landfill.\n\nPollinator Paradise\n\nFestus RVI School District Quest Program\n\nTeam Members: Drake B., Evan C., Zachary B., Peyton B., Abigail B., Riley B., Katherine C., Wyatt C., Carlei C., Elaine C., Lucas D., Makayla D., Calvin E., Zoe E., Grant F., Lindy F., Alexander G., Elijah G., Zachariah G., Carson G., Evan G., Madison G., Cohen H., Katie H., Alexandria H., Haley H., Josephine H., Joseph H., Cale H., Rose I., William J., Chase K., Eliana K., Peyton K., Ashton K., Alexander K., James K., Gwendolyn K., Gavin L., Caiden M., Colby M., Jack M., Elsa M., James M., Hope M., Liam O., Landry P., Sawyer P., Sierra P., Katelyn R., Jackson R., Karter R., William R., Bryson R., Alex R., Will R., Henry R., Audri S., Abigail S., Isaac S., Dakota S., Jillian S., Vincent S., Lilian S., Landon S., Kyah S., Joshua S., Hallie S., Henry S., Noah T., Cohen T., Emma V., Gage W., Cason W., Liliana W., Caiden W., Kalie W., Gracie W., Annabelle W., Mason W., Connor Z.\n\nMissouri\n\nEighty-two students ranging from 1st to 8th grade at Festus Intermediate School in Missouri created the Pollinator Paradise project. The students wanted to impact the ongoing mosquito problem at West City Park, a favorite and valuable resource for the Festus community. The students researched natural pest control and learned about natural predators of mosquitos, including the endangered Indiana bat. The students worked together with the City of Festus to build and install homes for natural predators, which included Indiana bats, Mason bees, Purple Martins, hummingbirds, and Monarch butterflies. They also learned that the City of Festus was in the migration path of the Monarch butterfly. Butterflies feed on milkweed, which is pollinated by Mason bees. Mason bees do not sting and were considered perfect pollinators for the park. As the students worked to revive the natural pollinators in their community, they were also resolving the mosquito issue at West City Park.\n\nEPA Region 8:\n\nGreen Team Superheroes\n\nWilmot Elementary\n\nTeam Members: Aiden A., Brady D., Henry E., Jackson L., Alyssa M., Madison M., Annikah R., Reagan R., Samuel S., Campbell T., Julianne T., Dillon V., Genevieve W.\n\nColorado\n\nThe Green Team Superheroes of Wilmot Elementary in Colorado are a group of 4th and 5th graders who received the Eco- School's USA Silver Award for reducing their school's energy consumption. Each Superhero was assigned a classroom to lead and monitor while they conducted energy audits and implemented school-wide energy saving contests. Light meters were used to determine how much light was being used in each classroom. The students found that most of the classrooms were over lit. Then, using plug load meters, they found that too many electronic devices that were not being used were plugged in, therefore, taking up phantom energy. They created an action plan that led to the removal of almost two-thirds of the classroom lights and teachers committing to turn off their classroom lights more frequently. The Green Team also encouraged their classrooms to take on the issue of waste pollution by reducing the consumption and waste of food, paper, and plastic bottles.\n\nDevelopment of a Novel Tool for Monitoring Soil Health and Contamination\n\nby Kylan J.\n\nColorado\n\nKylan from Fossil Ridge High School in Colorado developed a bio-electrochemical system called BioRemeter to determine microbial activities in soil. Soil is an important resource and microbial respiration is an important indicator of biodegradation of contaminants and soil health in general. Current methods for evaluating microbial respiration measure carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from microbial metabolisms within soil. These methods are usually time consuming and expensive. Kylan's bio-electrochemical system determines microbial activities in soil without the technical issues faced in measuring CO2. BioRemeter assesses soil health and soil contaminant biodegradation by monitoring microbial activities with electrons. Clay was used as a test soil for Kylan's experiments. Results showed voltage measurements from BioRemeter correlate strongly with microbial activities, readings from BioRemeter were more sensitive than respiration methods, and BioRemeter assesses soil health and contamination at a lower cost than conventional respiration methods. A patent application has been filed for the BioRemeter.\n\nEPA Region 9:\n\nWhaleManji: Welcome to the Ocean -- an integrated project to help support the Humpback Whale\n\nMount Madonna School\n\nTeam Members: Electra A., Luke C., Rocco C., Robert C., Tej D., Kinsey D., Samantha K., Kadence L., Emilia L., Luc M., Isabelle M., Izaak O., Madison O., Cisco R., Cavan S., Elyse W., Nash W.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe 5th grade class at Mount Madonna School in Watsonville, California, began the 2017-18 school year by exploring local environmental issues they wanted to solve. After considering many different potential topics, the class chose to focus their efforts on the conservation of the Pacific Humpback Whale. To better understand these marine mammals, student teams studied and worked with local field experts to write reports, create display boards, and present information about the species such as its habitat, threats, and current conservation efforts. During their studies, the students discovered that ocean plastic pollution was a significant threat to humpback whales. To reduce the amount of plastics flowing through their local watershed to the Monterey Bay, students participated in beach cleanups and letter-writing campaigns to elected officials regarding plastic straws, produced a creative short movie titled \"WhaleManji: Welcome to the Ocean\" that raised $1,800 for conservation, and developed educational materials in Spanish to share with students in Costa Rica. Additionally, the class participated in the Monterey Bay Aquarium's 2018 Plastic Pollution Summit and the annual Monterey Whale Festival where they shared their project information and promoted humpback whale conservation.\n\nThe Healthy Freedom Campaign\n\nEarth Peace\n\nTeam Members: Lila C., Zion F., Felix H., Kohana P., and Nikita T.\n\nCalifornia\n\nEarth Peace, a non-profit in California, was founded by Lila in 2012 when she was 10 years old. In 2015, Lila started the Healthy Freedom Campaign for a plant-based meal choice every day of the school year in the nation's 2nd largest public-school district, Los Angeles Unified in California. The Healthy Freedom Campaign's goal was for every public school to offer a fully plant-based meal choice option, every day at lunch. Lila organized doctors, experts, athletes, and fellow students to start a massive campaign to change the delivery of food to fellow students in K-12 Los Angeles Unified schools. Lila also engaged filmmakers, celebrities, universities, government agencies, and secured a $20,000 grant to create a website dedicated to promoting plant-based school lunches. In 2017, the Los Angeles Unified School Board voted to implement the Healthy Freedom Campaign's objective and rolled out a pilot of the new lunches in seven schools. Today the program has expanded to more than 80 schools.\n\nEPA Region 10:\n\nWorm Soup and Growing Green\n\nBroad View Elementary Green Club\n\nTeam Members: Kamryn H., Samantha H., Aaron L., and Emelyn P.\n\nWashington\n\nThe Broad View Elementary Green Club in Washington created the project, \"Worm Soup and Growing Green\" to reduce the amount of waste generated at the school during lunch; spread kindness and beautify their community; teach students about gardening and plants; and make the planet a better place to live. To start their project, the students conducted extensive research and performed a waste audit. To achieve their goal of reducing waste produced at their school, the students installed worm bins built by a local community business to compost the food scraps from their cafeteria. The students also convinced the school's food service provider to switch from plastic sporks to metal-ware to limit the amount of plastic that could end up in the ocean. The students then started a school garden using the soil created by the worms. In planting the garden, students purposefully included flowers in the garden rather than just growing edible plants. The flowers were grown to make flower arrangements to spread kindness at a local retirement community. Over the summer, the students and their families kept the garden watered. In the fall, they all enjoyed the blooming garden. This project helped Broad View Elementary School become recognized as a 2018 U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon School, and the Oak Harbor School District is being recognized in 2019 as a U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon District.\n\nRestoration and Preservation of Deer Creek in the Aftermath of the Beaver Creek Fire\n\nby Hunter B.\n\nIdaho\n\nHunter founded the organization, Deer Creek Nature, Inc., in the aftermath of the 2013 Beaver Creek Fire in Idaho. Hunter was 9 years old when the fire took place. The fire, which almost destroyed his home, decimated more than 114,000 acres of the National Sawtooth Forest. After the fire, there was an unanswered need for research and restoration of the land. Hunter gathered experts from the Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help answer his research questions. Community volunteers helped with restoration efforts, and Hunter created a non-profit organization to help restore the land and to educate youth about protecting this ecosystem. He spent his spring and summer holidays removing thousands of invasive species, he has also planted more than 1,000 native plants and collected data on the ecosystem's recovery from the fire. Hunter has successfully helped rebuild the natural habitats of the area that now harbors new wildlife. In 2016, he created a summer ecological program for youth interested in learning how to protect the ecosystem and over 20 students have since attended his summer program. He has also leveraged his impact through the power of storytelling and won an award for his first short story, \"Nature Calls,\" published in 2018 in the magazine Skipping Stones.\n\n2018 Winners\n\nEPA Region 1\n\nThe Blue Feet Foundation\n\nTeam: William and Matthew G.\n\nIn Will's science class, he studied birds and learned about the dramatic population decline of the blue-footed booby, a bird with bright blue feet from the Galapagos. He and his younger brother, Matthew, from Massachusetts, were upset at the possible extinction of the bird and developed the idea of selling blue socks to raise awareness and fund research. The Blue Feet Foundation was born. Through Instagram and social media, the brothers have made people aware of the blue-footed booby's problem and sold over 3,000 pairs of socks in 29 countries and in every state in the United States. The $40,000 raised is funding a scientific expedition this summer for Dr. David Anderson to go to the Galapagos and research the population decline. Through stories from the National Audubon Society, Galapagos Conservancy, United Nations, World Wildlife Fund, National Geographic, Boston Globe and Fox News, Will and Matt's project has helped educate people across the world to help the blue-footed booby.\n\nEPA Region 2\n\nWorm Tower, Earth Power\n\nby Samuel B.\n\nSamuel, a second grader from New Jersey, is teaching his school and community about the importance of composting through his project, \"Worm Tower, Earth Power.\" Samuel created a composite or worm bin with the help of his 2nd grade teacher and sponsor, as well as his parents. He shared the information he learned throughout the community, with his fellow classmates, with other classes in the school, and with the Bergenfield Garden Club. He will continue this composting project and ultimately distribute all the worms used in his bin to the Garden Club so that these worms can continue to have a positive effect on the environment.\n\nWater Monitoring for Informed Decisions\n\nby Sonja M.\n\nSonja, a high schooler from New Jersey has been learning about and researching her local waterways for years. As an active stream monitor since 2011, she developed a particular passion for salamander conservation, creating an educational lecture and game called the Salamander Dilemma which she's presented at schools, 4-H camps, and nature festivals. Sonja has advocated locally for the least invasive construction methods to the local ecosystem. She has presented her research and data on her local waterways at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Gas Pipeline Final Public Hearing, at national and international conferences including the National Geographic Society and the New York Academy of Sciences Bicentennial celebration, and scientific conferences in Philadelphia and Raleigh. She won the grand prize at the 2018 Mercer Science and Engineering Fair, for her project, \"A Novel Device for Preservation and Remote Monitoring of DNA barcode Benthic Macroinvertebrate Samples\", which made her eligible to compete in the Intel International Science and Engineering Festival.

His work utilizes a novel dual process to address two alarming global environmental crises: hazardous diesel emissions and petroleum-based plastic pollution. His prototype products outperform petroleum-based plastic in terms of environmental attributes and existing bioplastics in terms of cost attributes. The prototypes demonstrate strong technical performance in tensile strength, water resistance, and biodegradability. During the process of this project, he has engaged his community throughout various stages. He has presented to thousands of people at various venues, including local schools, libraries, STEM Symposium, science fair competitions, 3M headquarters, and Discovery Education online audiences, as well as interviews with news outlets. He was a finalist in the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge competition.\n\nSkip the Straw\n\nby Ahman J.\n\nAs a leader of the J.C. Parks Environmental Club/Green Team, Ahman learned about marine debris. After learning that straws were one of the top ten pollutants in the ocean, his team noticed that straws were a common trash item found on their school grounds and in their wetland. The goal of the resulting \"Skip the Straw\" project was to encourage the people in their community to reduce the number of straws they use in order to reduce plastic straw pollution that hurts marine life. Ahman embraced this project, taking actions such as writing a letter to the superintendent of schools and the Charles County Commissioners explaining the harmful effects of straw use and asking for support for the campaign. The Commissioners were so impressed with the thoughtfulness of the letter, they proclaimed Earth Day as Skip the Straw Day.\n\nEPA Region 4\n\nClimate Leadership and Outreach: Connecting Air Quality and Renewable Energy\n\nby Emily L.\n\nEmily, a high schooler from North Carolina, has been passionate about environmental science since grade school. In 2017, she completed a project focused on connecting air quality and renewable energy as part of her involvement in the Climate Leadership and Energy Awareness Program (Climate LEAP). Her project had three components: research, leadership, and outreach. For her research component, she focused on air pollution. Working with a PhD student at the University of North Carolina, she used a computer model to simulate how emissions from the energy, transportation, and industry sectors would affect air quality in NC from 2010- 2050. For the leadership component, she started a solar panel initiative at her school, securing $30K in funding, working with three peers. She also, launched the EPA Air Quality Flag Program Spring Challenge at her school. For outreach, she presented at event and poster sessions, published an Op-ed and Letter to the Editor.\n\nEPA Region 5\n\nMayor Leaps to Save Michigan Frogs\n\nby Trinity F.\n\nA 5th grader, Trinity raised public awareness about Michigan's amphibians and the importance of preserving wetlands. In 2016, she entered and won a Detroit Zoo essay contest on amphibian conservation and was appointed to a two-year term as the Mayor of Amphibiville. In addition, she became one of the nation's youngest FrogWatch USA certified members. Through FrogWatch, she shared her scientific findings to assist local and national scientists with frog breeding data collection. She created Fun Frog Trading cards to help promote amphibian conservation to her classmates, created a colorful brochure on the topic, and helped clean up local wetlands. As Mayor of Amphibiville she created and signed an Executive Order (endorsed by the Detroit Zoo) to stop frog hunting for Michigan State Senate Bill 316. She has received letters of appreciation for her amphibian conservation efforts from the following local politicians: Governor Rick Snyder, Mayor Mike Fournier, Mayor Rick Stathakis, Senator Debbie Stebanow, and Senator Gary Peters.\n\nElectronic Recycling Initiative\n\nby Jay M.\n\nA senior from Indiana, Jay partnered with the e-recycling organization TechRecyclers to ensure responsible handling and data destruction of materials collected during multiple community electronics drives. He advertised through local news, online publications, social media, and flyers. The electronic drives took place between 2015-2017 involving 15-20 volunteers per event and diverted over 30,000 lbs from landfills. Because of his efforts electronics recycling drives are now conducted annually. In addition to the drives, he undertook an e-waste education initiative for 3rd and 4th grade students. He noticed detrimental effects that heavy metals in broken electronics can have on both people and the environment. Realizing the extent of these effects, he began a research project to test the protective effects of a green algae, Chlorella vulgaris, on zebrafish exposed to multiple concentrations of methylmercury (a poisonous form of mercury in electronics). His research received an award at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. In addition, he has been a Distinguished Finalist for the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, and has written lesson plans for Kids are Scientists Too, a non-profit organization.\n\nEPA Region 6\n\nSave the Place Where We are Living and Save the Planet\n\nby Asvini T.\n\nAs a grade schooler in Texas, Asvini implemented a city-wide battery recycling initiative diverting over 25,000 batteries (weighing more than a ton) away from landfills. Asvini did her research and conducted a series of presentations about the dangers of the chemicals found in batteries. She made a clear connection between those dangers and associated human health risks, as well as damage doneto the natural environment. Soon after, she had her school, the library, and city officials involved, placing battery collection bins in her school's classrooms, in the local library, recreation centers, and elsewhere. Her efforts have been recognized by the local media, the mayor and environmental groups, and her work has expanded to include a website and a paper reduction campaign. Asvini has now added paper recycling to her outreach efforts and is taking her campaign even further.\n\nSaving the Hands that Feed Us\n\nby Madhalasa I.\n\nWhen thirty-two pesticide poisoning deaths (in three months) occurred in Madhalasa's ancestral town of Yavatmal District in India, Madhalasa felt compelled to do something. As a seventh grader in Texas, she coordinated a community fundraising activity that brought in enough money to purchase 700 pairs of gloves and masks for farmers in that region. She involved her Girl Scout troop to prepare them and volunteers in India to distribute them. Additionally, after conducting research on pesticide effects, Madhalasa came up with a blend of stable mixed cultures that could potentially help biodegrade a leading pesticide faster than what is most commonly used. Her work earned her first place in her District's Science Fair and has received local media attention. Madhalasa's journey is far from over; she is currently researching the possibility of a low-cost plant-derived herbicide.\n\nEPA Region 7\n\nEcommode Water-reducing Toilet\n\nTeam: Oak Ridge LEGO Blasters\n\nThe Oak Ridge Lego Blasters, 7th and 8th graders from Iowa, created the innovative Eccomode water-reducing toilet. They identified a need to reduce water usage and designed a toilet which recycles and deodorizes urine and uses it to flush fecal matter, thus creating an average daily water savings of thirty gallons per user. They consulted industry experts, including their local public health director, professors, and engineers at American Standard, to develop a feasible design which took real world impacts and concerns into consideration. They also conducted a market research survey of engineers, school and healthcare employees to assess public reception and a price point for this kind of product, and they obtained a provisional patent for their design. Their project was developed as part of the FIRST LEGO League challenge and received First Place for Overall Project submission at the Iowa state level.\n\nEPA Region 8\n\nDeveloping a Technology for Water Quality Testing\n\nby Gitanjali R.\n\nGitanjali's project addressed the core issue of speedy, accurate and inexpensive detection of lead contamination, potentially helping people take preventative measures and maybe even saving lives!

In addition to securing research and development funding and testing the prototype, she is actively promoting water quality awareness in her local and global community, participating in news interviews, speaking with Flint, MI activists, participating in TEDx conferences in India, and acting as a reporter for \"TIME for Kids.\"\n\nEPA Region 9\n\nAudrey4Care\n\nby Audrey K.\n\nAt just six years old, Audrey was inspired by a personal letter from former President Obama to take action to protect marine life and started AUDREY4CARE, which stands for Care 4 Animals, Respect 4 the Earth. Through her YouTube Channel, making her own handmade paper roses and natural soy candles and donating her birthday money, Audrey, now a second grader, has raised over $3,300 for the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, California. She also organized a class field trip for a local beach cleanup event and through community outreach at her local library and beaches regularly educates people about how to care for the environment. Her story has been shared on ABC7 News, radio, and several national and local newspapers in both English and Korean.\n\nFriends of the LAX Dunes\n\nby Ayanna N.\n\nAs a part of her Girl Scout Gold Award, Ayanna, a 12th grader from California, founded an environmental non-profit organization called Friends of the LAX Dunes or FOLD to protect and restore habitat owned by the Los Angeles Airport. The LAX EL Segundo Dunes Preserve is home to over 900 species, some of which cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, including the El Segundo blue butterfly. Ayanna formed a strong private-public partnership between the Los Angeles Airport and corporate sponsors such as Verizon, Southern California Gas and the local Rotary Club to secure volunteers and resources. FOLD hosts monthly events where volunteers learn how to identify plant species, remove non-native plants and reseed damaged areas. In 2017, FOLD hosted 16 events with 544 volunteers, and logged more than 1,632 volunteer hours. Ayanna has also expanded upon an innovative Adopt- a-Dune Program where local businesses provide ongoing resources and volunteers for restoration efforts to ensure that the project will continue into the future.\n\nEPA Region 10\n\nMake Soil not Smoke by Composting\n\nTeam: Mr. Anderson's First Grade Class\n\nThis first-grade class from Washington took on the project of a school garden and in the process, learned and educated their community about the benefits of composting. As part of their garden, the class wanted to create compost to add to the sandy soil. When they examined their school's \"burn pile\" for leaves to compost, they realized that burning leaves was an unnecessary process that adds a great deal of smoke to their air each fall. Their motto became \"make soil not smoke\". Their project soon became that of educating the community on the benefits of composting rather than burning leaves. In addition to a grant to support vermicomposting, they received donations of organic materials from local ranchers and received truckloads of horse manure, straw and hay, and a dump truck load of apple cores. The Colville Indian Tribe donated tools the size that the students could use. Over one year, they created over two hundred cubic yards of excellent compost. The class reached out to the community members and organizations to spread awareness of making soil not smoke. They hosted events, gave demonstrations, created a float, and staffed booths at street fairs and the local farmers market to get their message across.\n\nOperation Sustain\n\nTeam: Operation Sustain\n\nOperations Sustain is an organization run by six high school students in Washington who have a goal to increase environmental awareness in the next generation of students. Since being inspired by their Environmental Science class, they wanted to educate elementary students about environmental issues to encourage them to make change and to make technology more accessible to promote the STEM fields. In the summer of 2017, these high school students developed Operation Sustain, an educational sandbox-style simulation video game in which 3rd-5th grade students are tasked with building a successful sustainable city. Through the game, the students learn the large-scale solutions to sustainable city development and the choices they can make as individuals to positively impact their community, while also having fun. The students worked with Washington Green Schools to identify academic standards for 3rd-5th grade students related to the game and developed teacher handbooks and four one-hour session curriculum supplements with engaging activities, quizzes, discussion questions, worksheets, and presentations for easy implementation in the class. They are working with the superintendents in the state of Washington to implement this curriculum for every fifth grade student.\n\n2017 Winners\n\nEPA Region 1\n\nSynthesis of Low Cost, Biodegradable Masks/Bags Using Novel Material Combinations: A Sustainability Project\n\nConnecticut\n\nTeam: PKN\n\nAfter reflecting on pollution problems in their own community and around the world, a group of 9th graders, calling themselves \"PKN\", decided to take matters into their own hands. The students were particularly concerned about air pollution and the large amount of petroleum-based plastics filling landfills, in their home community in Connecticut and abroad. PKN students especially noted people's use of inexpensive masks to filter out particulate matter in the air and the waste created by the disposal of these masks. In response, the students developed a low-cost biodegradable plastic using a local agricultural waste product-pumpkin. The team continues to explore options to commercially distribute masks made from this cost-efficient bioplastic. The group is also working to develop biodegradable plastic bags made from their innovative material.\n\nIn the process of developing their bioplastic products, PKN engaged with members of their local community and global community. PKN partnered with a local farm to repurpose pumpkins that would otherwise be thrown away as waste at the end of the fall season. The group met with a local environmental technology company to further develop a business model for PKN's products. Along the way, the student group developed a mobile application to raise awareness among children of plastic pollution. Finally, on a global scale, the PKN team is exploring opportunities to donate future profits to an organization working to prevent suicide among Indian farmers.\n\nEPA Region 2\n\nCreating a Mosquito Trap Using By-Products of Compost & Solar Power\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeam: The Traposquitoes\n\nWhen considering how harmful mosquitoes can be to human populations, the \"Traposquitoes,\" a group of three 8th graders from New Jersey, decided to take steps to make their own community safer. The students were concerned about the transmission of disease by mosquitoes, which can cause minor irritation and can spread major illnesses such as Zika and Malaria. The Traposquitoes aimed to educate people about the potential harm that the presence of mosquitoes can bring and to design a trap to help reduce mosquito populations in their community. Instead of the traditional electric mosquito traps, which are powered by electric currents from a house or by batteries, are limited in the areas they can be placed, and tend to be expensive, the Traposquitoes designed an efficient, new, environmentally-friendly trap. Their traps use the heat and CO2 from composting organic material to attract mosquitoes, along with a solar powered light and suction fan to trap them.\n\nThe group installed one of their traps at a local reservoir, and hosted educators and news media to see their project. The Traposquitoes also started a composting initiative at the Riverview Park Farmers Market to collect compost for use in their traps. The Traposquitoes were interviewed by the Honeywell Institute of Ecosystems Education and the Jersey Journal, and have continued to expand their outreach within the state. For their efforts, the Traposquitoes received the 2016 Governor's Environmental Excellence Award.\n\nThe Traposquitoes have already begun impacting the world beyond their community. They started a \"Global Traposquito\" initiative with the purpose of connecting with other students to reduce the global mosquito population. The Traposquitoes sent materials to construct a mosquito trap at the Julius E. Sprauve School in the Virgin Islands and will collaborate with students at this school via Skype. The Traposquitoes also produced an online video tutorial and instruction manual to assist others who wish to build their own versions, and educate local and global community members through YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and an online newsletter called \"Traposquito Weekly.\" In the future, the Traposquitoes hope to expand their project even farther, with plans to develop a public park composting initiative.\n\nEPA Region 3\n\nSave the Frogs and Toads\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTeam: Devin and Roldan K.\n\nBrothers Devin and Roldan from Pennsylvania, have one goal in mind: to save frogs and toads. The brothers' interest was sparked by discussions about the number of mosquitoes in their area, and the decline of predators like bats, frogs and toads, which feed on mosquitoes.\n\nThe brothers learned that each April, the swimming pool at their local park drains the water and ends up killing tadpoles living in the pool before they can mature. To increase the population of native frogs and toads, Devin and Roldan took approximately 2,000 tadpoles from the pool in April and raised them to the frog and toad stage. They monitored an aquarium with a filtration system and collected fruit flies from a compost bin to feed the growing frogs and toads. The brothers then released them into their native habitats in July and August. Over the course of their project, the brothers observed their aquarium closely, protected the tadpoles from predators, and transferred the tadpoles to a larger aquarium as they grew legs.\n\nTo raise awareness about their project, Devin and Roldan distributed informational cards to a troop of Cub Scouts about designing effective pools for tadpole growth. They also engaged the troop members in educational games about frogs and toads. At their church's national reunion at Deer Park, the brothers presented their project to children from around the country, inviting them to watch the release of the mature frogs and toads. As a result of their project, Devin and Roldan have observed not only an increase in frog and toad populations, but improvement in the overall ecosystem, with a decrease in the number of mosquitoes and a growing number of native animals, such as snakes, fish, and birds.\n\nHealthy and Sustainable Farming Practices\n\nVirginia\n\nTeam: George Mason High School Environmental Group\n\nThe George Mason High School (GMHS) Environmental Group, a group of 11 students in Northern Virginia, have worked for the past two years to implement two projects, with a focus on providing healthy, sustainable food sources that can be produced in an urban area. Through a hydroponics project and an aquaculture project, the students are contributing fresh lettuce and in the future, fresh fish to their high school cafeteria.\n\nInterest in urban sustainability began after the students received a grant from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to work with soil scientists from the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District on ways to reduce water runoff in urban areas. From this project, the GMHS Environmental Group became interested in other urban sustainable practices and received a \"Super Grant\" from the Falls Church Education Foundation to design and implement a hydroponics and aquaculture project at their high school and a local middle school. Hydroponics, which is the process of growing plants in a soilless media, and aquaculture, the process of raising fish in a closed environment, promote the growth of crops and fish with lower need for pesticides, insecticides, or herbicides. In order to encourage healthy eating, the GMHS Environmental Group decided to plant lettuce and raise tilapia for their school cafeteria.\n\nFrom their hydroponics and aquaculture project, the GMHS Environmental Group has produced over 60 pounds of lettuce served in their school cafeteria, and expect the first harvest of tilapia in Fall 2017, with plans to supply a consistent tilapia harvest in the future. For their efforts, the students were awarded the Project Green Schools award for Outstanding Commitment to Green-o-vation. The team has presented their work to the Falls Church City 4H Club, the Falls Church Garden Club, and science teachers in Northern Virginia, as well as at the 2015 and 2016 Student Environmental Action Showcase at George Mason University.\n\nEPA Region 4\n\n#Share a Book #Save a Forest #Change a Life\n\nFlorida\n\nTeam: Chase H. and Vance T.\n\nWhen 5th grade friends Chase and Vance came across a bin of a thousand books heading to the landfill, while knowing that some community members had no books, these two students set out to solve both problems at once. Calling their partnership \"read.repeat\", Chase and Vance successfully collected, sorted and repurposed over 25,000 books in six months, taught thousands of community members about recycling and repurposing, and kept thousands of pounds of waste from entering the landfill.\n\nChase and Vance researched the lifecycle of books, learning about the amount of wood needed to create a book, the challenges to recycling them (due to glue in the bindings), and the estimated 300 million books discarded into landfills each year. They began collection of gently used books, getting word out into their community through their website readrepeat.org, complete with a program logo to enhance community recognition of the project. They made presentations to their school, their Cub Scout Pack, a martial arts studio, their local National Elementary Honor Society chapter, and other community groups. Chase and Vance even approached the source of the original bin of books that inspired their effort and convinced the company to donate leftover inventory rather than dispose of it. When donations came pouring in, they enlisted friends and family to sort, pack, and deliver thousands of books to community members in need, at places like a homeless shelter, a local VA Hospital, local libraries and schools, and foster and group homes.\n\nChase and Vance surpassed their initial goal, donated books to 32 organizations across three states, and brought the joy of reading to more than 5,000 individuals. With more than 80 volunteers and involvement from local businesses and media, they made a meaningful impact in their community and environment by keeping waste out of landfills and teaching others to #Share a Book #Save a Forest #Change a Life. In the future, they hope to expand their reach nationally to repurpose 50,000 books annually.\n\nCitizen Science in High Schools Aimed at Water Quality Testing\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTeam: Rachel and Adam E.\n\nIn South Carolina, two high school students Rachel and Adam implemented a Georgia citizen science initiative into their respective Greenville high schools, calling on fellow students to take charge in their watershed in order to prevent potential environmental health catastrophes. The program, Georgia's Adopt-A-Stream, is an initiative that trains individuals and groups in standardized water testing protocols. Once trained, citizens take monthly trips to their stream site(s) and sample for Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, turbidity, and E. coli bacteria levels. Data is posted to a public database for analysis and baseline data storage.\n\nRachel and Adam's interest in environmental protection and citizen science began as young children, participating in programs like Frog Watch USA and 4H. When their interest in water quality was peaked, they sought to bring a Georgia citizen science initiative to South Carolina. They coordinated a cross-border training session for certification in chemical and macroinvertebrate water monitoring. They initially picked up three sites from across the county and started reporting monthly data to Georgia's public database. Rachel and Adam expanded their interest to their high school years, starting initiatives to monitor the stream running through the heart of their city, with the involvement of science teachers and other students. Over time, Rachel and Adam expanded their work, involving students from their area in routine monitoring. They conceptualized a plan to execute a county-wide survey of streams for possible E. coli bacteria hotspots. Eighteen sites were selected due to their proximity to industry, roads, known sources of pollution, and animal waste. Several students from area high schools collected, plated, and assessed samples from each of the eighteen sites. Along the way, involved students have benefitted from open conversations with local environmental professors and officials, and gained exposure to potential career paths. Through their monitoring initiatives over the years, two broken sewer lines have been discovered and repaired which further demonstrates the real world value of citizen science.\n\nRachel and Adam continue to share their knowledge and encourage their peers and teachers to participate in these environmental stewardship efforts, through promoting inclusion of water monitoring curriculum in Greenville County schools, doing public appearances on local television, and sharing awareness of resources, funds, and supplies. South Carolina has now developed its own Adopt-A-Stream program.\n\nEPA Region 5\n\nGreenversal Environmental News Reports\n\nMichigan\n\nMegan H.\n\nMegan, an 11th-grader in Michigan, was disappointed in the general lack of exciting video content she could find featuring environmental news. Megan determined that a lack of public interest in environmental issues was reflected in how little environmental news was covered in the media. In an effort to counter public apathy, Megan began a weekly environmental news YouTube channel called Greenversal, where she creates, edits, and publishes short videos each week highlighting environmental news topics in an engaging and viewer-friendly way. Drawing inspiration from her favorite news anchors, Greenversal features Megan's news reports on environmental issues she's researched, including relevant photos and video clips. She also takes the time to read and engage with viewers' comments on her videos.\n\nSince launching her channel and accompanying website, Megan has reached viewers from over 100 countries around the world with more than 70,000 views. Viewers are utilizing the channel in creative ways, including a teacher of environmental literacy at a California jail, who uses Megan's weekly news reports as a resource for his students. Closer to home, Megan has broadcast the Greenversal channel to teachers at her own school and raised environmental awareness within her community. In the long term, Megan aspires to motivate others take action on environmental issues themselves.\n\nEPA Region 6\n\nCaring for the Planet and Its Children in Need\n\nTexas\n\nTeam: We Care Act\n\nIn the spring of 2008, when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Sichuan, China, the idea for the \"We Care Act\" project was formed. Eric, now a high schooler, saw the images of devastation and committed to try to support children impacted by the earthquake through creating the project. Over time, students involved in We Care Act learned that disasters not only affect victims' immediate, everyday life but also alter their chances in the future due to a lack of access to items such as clothes, books, and electronics. We Care Act was formed to collect gently used items to help disaster victims, while protecting the environment.\n\nOver time, We Care Act developed a focus on electronics recycling, as participants learned that a lack of technology can be one of the major educational setbacks for disadvantaged groups. The team aimed to increase awareness about electronics recycling and organize others to recycle and reuse in order to increase access to technology for children in need. The We Care Act team learned how to check and assemble computers and wipe hard drives. They conducted recycling drives and refurbishing workshops, and expanded their scope beyond disaster relief. Within a few months, they refurbished 15 laptops for an inner-city school in Houston and set desktops to a children's home. They created an electronic educational survey, to educate students and adults, as well as visited community centers, reaching over 5000 people, collecting over 1100 responses from 50+ cities. We Care Act has now recycled over 7400 lbs. of electronics, delivering 163 refurbished/new computers, tablets, smart phones and other electronics to organizations and individuals in Nicaragua, China, Nepal and in the U.S., while supporting victims of 15 natural disasters.\n\nEPA Region 7\n\nREVIVE Go Green-Reuse and Recycling of Pencils\n\nNebraska\n\nTeam: Aryan M. and Om M.\n\nWhen 6th grader Aryan and Kindergartener Om realized how many of their partially used pencils were left over each year, it got them thinking about how many usable pencils end up in the trash and the number of trees cut down to make those pencils. After researching how certain types of waste can be transformed into compost, the brothers decided to implement a project in the Millard Public School District to promote environmental awareness and a habit of reusing and recycling school supplies, like pencils. The students named their project \"REVIVE Go Green\" to reflect the completion of the life cycle of a pencil, when composted pencils can be used to grow or revive new trees.\n\nAfter learning that all parts of a wooden pencil can be recycled as compost (Ex. the \"lead\" in pencils is graphite, a rich source of potassium), the brothers worked with a local nursery, and the Aldrich Elementary School staff to set up a pencil recycling and composting program. All classes collected pencil shavings and pencil stubs, and the nursery recycled them into compost. In addition, Aryan and Om spent time after school each day sharpening hundreds of dull pencils for classes to reuse.\n\nInspired by the brothers' actions, students in other grades became involved as part of a REVIVE CLUB volunteer team; eventually, volunteer teams of older and younger students alike became involved in the collection process and the promotion of environmental awareness. On the last day of school, Aryan and Om collected pencils and were able to provide approximately 4,000 useable pencils for the next year's school supplies. For their efforts, they were awarded a special recognition letter from the Millard District Superintendent and Aldrich Principal. The brothers recently moved to New Jersey, where they plan on expanding the REVIVE Go Green project to their new school district, as well as supporting the continuation of their project at Aldrich Elementary.\n\nEPA Region 8\n\nFood Waste Awareness at Douglass Elementary\n\nColorado\n\nTeam: The Food Waste Club\n\nA group of 1st through 5th graders at Douglass Elementary, called the \"Food Waste Club,\" took action to educate their fellow students about food waste and help reduce waste at their school in Colorado.\n\nTo begin, the Food Waste Club sent out a survey to other students at Douglass Elementary to gauge which foods students did or did not like, as well as their thoughts on portion size, hot versus cold lunches, how hungry they were at lunchtime, and noise level in the cafeteria. The team then conducted a waste audit, weighing food from the cafeteria to see how much food their school was wasting and discovered that many students were throwing away untouched fruits and vegetables. In response, the Food Waste Club created an \"untouched food bin,\" where students place fruits and vegetables they haven't eaten to be washed and used in future lunches. To promote food waste awareness, members of the Food Waste Club prepared a video about food waste and being proactive in the lunch room, which was shared with other classes and put on the Douglass Elementary website.\n\nMost recently, the Food Waste Club has been involved in the larger community, participating in a food reclamation campaign called Feeding the 5,000 Front Range. The group also presented their project the director of food services in the Boulder Valley School District, who asked the club to design food waste posters to be put up in all elementary schools in the district.\n\nWatch and learn from the Food Waste Club how you can make a difference.\n\nA Small & Portable Air Dancer for Scaring Birds Away from Airports\n\nUtah\n\nTeam: The Bionic Porcupines 2.0\n\nWhen 6th graders in Utah learned that hundreds of birds are killed by striking airplanes at the Salt Lake City International (SLC) Airport, they were determined to help decrease the number of birds flying near airports. Together they formed a team called the \"Bionic Porcupines 2.0,\" to reduce bird strikes at SLC, which is located near a wetlands and a migratory bird route.\n\nThe group met with the airport wildlife staff, including the USDA airport biologist, to examine current methods to keep birds off the airport where birds tend to gather, including predator calls, robotic bait, and remote trap setting. They learned that one method of scaring birds away is to set up an air dancer- a large, brightly-colored tube that flaps when filled with air. However, large commercial air dancers tend to be expensive and require generators that contribute to pollution in the area.\n\nIn response, the Bionic Porcupines 2.0 created a small, portable, and battery-operated air dancer that is easily placed where birds nest and can run all day on a car battery. Through experimentation the team determined that it needed at least a 36\" sock to get strong random motion. They tested various fans and air sock materials, as they sought to create a dancer that could be placed under bridges and floated out on ponds. They tested their design at the airport and found that the only day that geese did not gather was the day their air dancer was used. The Bionic Porcupines 2.0 now have a provisional patent for their design. The air dancer is small so it can be used at any airport in multiple locations, protecting birds from striking airplanes.\n\nWatch the Bionic Porcupines 2.0 explain their creation.\n\nEPA Region 9\n\nShore Wars- The Shore Awakens\n\nCalifornia\n\nTeam: The Mount Madonna School\n\nThis student driven, integrated curriculum, project focused on environmental threats faced by the Western Snowy Plover, a threatened shorebird found along the California coastline. The students selected this topic as the focus of their work after researching a variety of local environmental topics. They were specifically concerned with habitat encroachment and pollution from plastic, both of which contribute to declining numbers of the bird.\n\nOver the course of the year, student teams worked with a local biologist to write reports, create displays and present to one another information on habitat, threats and conservation efforts. Students connected with community members by learning from and working with organizations such as Save our Shores, Point Blue Conservation Science, and the Elkhorn Slough Foundation. Students planned their project including elements of civic action, civic service, education, experimentation, fundraising, innovation and presentation. They formed a mock company to implement their plan, ultimately wrote and filmed a 30-minute educational film, which was sold to raise funds for the organizations supporting their project. The class presented to their school, to members of the community, to media, and to a local Assembly member. The class was chosen to participate in the Monterey Bay Aquarium Plastic Pollution summit to present their research to other students. From the summit, out of more than 150 schools, they were selected to present at World Ocean Day at the aquarium.\n\nAs the civic service piece of their project, the students worked to reestablish habitat at a local state beach by planting native plants, held fall and spring cleanups of habitat on another state beach, and created nesting indentations and camouflage in old salt flats near Elkhorn Slough. Additionally, they worked with the state park system to create educational signs to alert the public of wintering flocks of snowy plovers. With partners in the 9th grade, students created an experiment where a small-scale sand dune was designed and tested to assess its ability to hold a plover nest exposed to the elements. Aspects of engineering and upcycling were integrated into post cleanup classroom exercises.\n\nThe Grey Water Project\n\nCalifornia\n\nShreya R.\n\nHaving seen firsthand the effects of drought in California and in India, high-schooler Shreya formed the Grey Water Project to encourage people conserve and reuse water. Over three years of research into water conservation, Shreya has particularly focused on the possibility of reusing grey water, which is lightly used water, especially from laundry.\n\nIn her research, Shreya found that many commercial laundry detergents have harmful chemicals that can be detrimental to soil, plants, and aquatic life. So instead, she tested to see if grey water from soap nuts-a natural laundry detergent derived from the Indian soap berry-could be used as irrigation water without harming the environment. She tested the effects of soap nut grey water on aquatic life, soil and plants, using multiple tests and comparing grass exposed to regular water, soap-nut grey water, organic and non-organic detergent grey water. She found that soap nut grey water was beneficial to plant growth and cost less than an organic detergent.\n\nThrough the grey water project, including her website and Facebook page, Shreya reaches out to her community to educate people about water conservation. She has presented at her school and local elementary schools, as well as at a local water board. She has approached parent teacher organizations and local libraries in the hopes to present there as well. For her efforts, she has been recognized in the media and numerous awards at science fairs and competitions. Shreya is continuing to research grey water and to promote water conservation, and hopes to do so throughout her high school career.\n\nEPA Region 10\n\nBee Happy We Happy\n\nWashington\n\nElizabeth S.\n\nAs part of the 5th grade science curriculum, Elizabeth learned about pollination and the importance of bees. The topic struck her curiosity and after encouragement from her teacher, Elizabeth embarked on an independent project to educate herself and her community about bee health and beekeeping.\n\nTitling her project \"Bee Happy We Happy,\" Elizabeth did extensive research including reviewing articles, Washington State University Extension videos on pollination and pollinator protection, a TED talk, visiting a local nursery to understand cultivation, and reaching out to organizations and scientists as direct sources. Her research included sources such as the community Horticulture wing of the Department of Pest Management of Washington State University Extension, a chemical engineer in Oregon, and a biotechnologist in pharmaceuticals, which helped her to understand chemicals being used in modern agriculture and managing balanced biodiversity.\n\nFollowing her research, to engage her community, Elizabeth created an awareness flier, and set out to distribute it across her school and community. Elizabeth shared actions that her community members could take to promote bee health, such as planting bee-friendly flowers, keeping \"weeds,\" becoming a beekeeper, reducing pesticide use, and including water sources in a garden. She presented to her classmates and principal, and provided fliers to homeroom teachers to discuss with their science classes. At her local grocery, she engaged customers at the door by giving out her flier and discussing her concerns about bee health and how individuals could make a difference in protecting pollinators. Elizabeth plans to continue to get the message out to her family, friends and community to develop more \"bee helpers\" in her community.\n\nLearn from Elizabeth how to protect pollinators in this video.\n\nSchools Under 2C\n\nWashington\n\nTeam: Tesla STEM High School's Schools Under 2C\n\nThe student Leadership Team of Tesla STEM High School launched \"Schools Under 2C,\" an organization dedicated to raising awareness about the environment amongst the younger generation. Consisting of over 100 students, Schools Under 2C have lead their school to reduce their carbon footprint by over a ton and a half each month. They have proved that reducing emissions is not only beneficial to the environment, but saves their school district money as well.\n\nThrough simple educational programs, the students have been igniting behavioral changes throughout their school. They began monitoring and reducing lighting usage within each classroom, and teachers have pledged to turn off their lights during their planning period and lunch. They have worked with their county's Green School Program to implement a composting program. The students have also started working on an educational campaign to encourage students to take \"greener\" or alternatives modes of transportation to and from school. They are partnering with the City of Redmond to develop an app to encourage students to take the bus, carpool, bike, or walk to school. Using the app, students will be able to track how they travel to school every day. The app rewards students for taking cleaner modes of transportation, and once a user reaches enough points, the student is rewarded with a prize from a local business.\n\nNow the Leadership Team has challenged other schools across the nation to do the same, and already over 10 schools have joined their program to take on the \"Schools Under 2C\" Challenge. By leading their school to reduce their carbon footprint, they have set a precedent for the rest of the community.\n\nBesides challenging other schools to join their Schools Under 2C program, they have organized outreach events to raise awareness on environmental issues in the communities. They are still expanding and growing. In the future, through Schools Under 2C, the students will continue educating the next generation on solving environmental issues, one degree at a time.\n\nWatch a Tesla STEM High School student talk about how students can reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n2016 Winners\n\nEPA Region 1\n\nNutrasafe: Creating an Eco-Friendly Plant Food for the Environment\n\nConnecticut\n\nTeam: The Plant Phenoms\n\nMotivated by the threatening side effects posed by traditional agricultural fertilizers, the Plant Phenoms team sought to understand and pursue environmentally friendly alternatives. Although plants require nutrients to grow, traditional fertilizer application methods and amounts threaten the environment. Waters from brooks, streams, creeks,lakes, and oceans can become polluted by nitrates and phosphates. The overabundance of nitrogen and phosphorus can cause algae to multiply, particularly when waters are warm and calm. When the algae die, they are eaten by bacteria that deplete the oxygen and leave aquatic \"dead zones,\" where fish and other aquatic life cannot survive.\n\nThe Plant Phenoms developed and tested a new eco-friendly plant food called Nutrasafe. This plant food comes in soluble, vegetarian gel capsules that are filled with dried and ground banana and orange peels. By using gel capsules, the plant food can be easily distributed directly into the soil. The Plant Phenoms performed multiple trials with different fertilizers. Plants given Nutrasafe grew as well as plants given traditional fertilizers, and formed less algae in water. The Plant Phenoms have plans to present their work to middle school and elementary school students, and share Nutrasafe capsules with their community's school gardens.\n\nEPA Region 2\n\nFighting Deforestation of the Pine Barrens with Vertical Greenhouses\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeam: Greenhouse Gladiators\n\nThe Pine Barrens, a sandy, coastal forest that covers over 1.1 million acres of New Jersey, is home to over 850 species of plants, 39 species of mammals, 91 species of fish, and 59 species of reptiles; is responsible for recharging the 17 trillion-gallon Kirkwood- Cohansey aquifer; and is a recognized International Biosphere Reserve. In recent years, the commercial production of blueberries and cranberries has contributed to damage and deforestation of the Pine Barrens. The Greenhouse Gladiators team was formed to combat deforestation due to these agriculture activities in the Pine Barrens.\n\nThe Greenhouse Gladiators designed a vertical greenhouse to combat local deforestation. Vertical greenhouses conserve the amount of farmland needed by growing plants upward on a series of open shelves, compared to traditional growing methods that take up wider land areas. These structures typically allow farmers to grow more crops, but are not cost- effective because they rely on expensive, light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. The Greenhouse Gladiators built a scale model of a cost-effective vertical greenhouse that used metal to reflect natural sunlight to the crops. In tests, the Greenhouse Gladiators found that their reflective design outperformed typical LED lighting. Their research was published in the Journal of Agricultural Engineering and Biotechnology.\n\nNow, the Greenhouse Gladiators are working to build vertical greenhouses for local farmers and have created an online petition to raise money. Local farmers can receive a small vertical greenhouse if they pledge to not expand into the Pine Barrens. The Greenhouse Gladiators hope to send a message that with innovation, humans can coexist with the environment.\n\nEPA Region 3\n\nZero Waste: Are You Sure?\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTeam: Park Forest Elementary Zero Waste Team\n\nInspired by neighboring Pennsylvania State University's sustainability efforts and a challenge from their principal, Park Forest Elementary School Zero Waste Team members are leading the charge to make their school become waste free.\n\nTo begin, the students collaborated with Pennsylvania State University to conduct a waste audit. After analyzing the data and developing a waste reduction plan, the Zero Waste Team began the \"Are You Sure?\" educational campaign to challenge students and staff to reduce waste and properly dispose of items that could be repurposed, recycled, or composted. Students' goals included recycling milk bottles, plastic bags, disposable coffee pods, and other hard-to-recycle items. Another part of the waste reduction plan included composting: classroom waste in worm bins (also called vermicomposting), garden and yard waste in outside containers, and lunch room organic waste collected by a commercial composter. The Zero Waste Team also encouraged students and staff to use only one paper towel each after washing to dry their hands, and to compost those paper towels. As a result of the Zero Waste effort, the Park Forest Elementary School recycled 470 pounds of metal cans, 1,695 pounds of plastic bottles, and 9,660 pounds of mixed paper in 2015. While the school still produces some waste, there are measurable improvements from the Are You Sure? challenge. First, the school no longer fills its dumpster as quickly. The refuse truck arrives just two times per week versus five. Accordingly, the school's waste disposal bills decreased from $534 to $261 per month.\n\nAs current students prepare to transition to middle school, they mentor new student leaders in order to maintain and expand the success of the Zero Waste Team. Additionally, the Zero Waste Team is working with their county waste professionals to replicate the Are You Sure? challenge and bring proven practices to neighboring schools.\n\nImpact of Energy Consumption Reduction on Household Carbon Footprints\n\nPennsylvania\n\nRohan Chalasani\n\nRohan completed this project after becoming interested in the impact of an individual household on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change mitigation. He investigated the impact of relatively hassle-free, energy-saving methods on a single household's environmental footprint. Rohan conducted an experiment over the course of ten weeks, breaking down energy-conserving methods into three areas: electricity, natural gas, and water. During five control weeks, he measured the energy consumption in the household with no conservation actions taken. In five experimental weeks, Rohan lowered the thermostat by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, unplugged appliances at night, reduced light use, and shortened shower times to 10 minutes per shower.\n\nRohan calculated that the household experienced a 23% reduction in its total carbon dioxide emissions due to the energy-conservation actions. He found that while taking a shorter shower had a minimal effect on energy usage, reducing natural gas had significant effects on the household's total carbon footprint, contributing to 75% of total reduction. Rohan extrapolated the results of his experiment to show that if 50% of households implemented his same methods, the United States could see a 200 million metric-ton reduction in total carbon dioxide emissions. This is the equivalent of reducing emissions from 4.1 million barrels of oil. Rohan's results underscore that small actions taken by many individuals have the potential to yield measurable greenhouse gas emissions reductions.\n\nEPA Region 4\n\ne-Treasure, Inc.\n\nFlorida\n\nTeam: Kady M.\n\nAfter discovering electronic waste is the fastest-growing segment of items in landfills, Kady came up with the idea of eTreasure to keep the environment free of electronic waste, use resources wisely, and protect the Earth. She began electronics collection drives to ensure the proper disposal of electronics. When possible, these electronics are refurbished and redistributed to help people in her community. Cell phones, tablets, and computers are first cleared and then donated to students, schools, soldiers, or other community members who otherwise would not have access to these technologies.\n\nKady has placed collection containers at schools throughout her county, and worked with city professionals to collect and ensure proper disposal, refurbishing, and redistribution of electronic waste. Since its inception in March 2015, eTreasure, Inc. has developed partnerships with local corporations, registered as a nonprofit corporation, collected over 500 pounds of eTrash, and become an official \"Cell Phones for Soldiers\" public drop-off location. Kady's goal for e-Treasure is to eventually provide refurbished tablets to every student in the county.\n\nLow-Cost Hetero-nanostructure Semiconductor Uses Visible Light Energy to Efficiently Degrade Toxins\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTeam: Joshua Zhou\n\nJoshua successfully created a more efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly method of improving water quality and reducing pollution, particularly the pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD is a persistent, manmade human toxin unintentionally produced during manufacturing or incomplete combustion from fires, automobiles, coal-based power production, and other processes. TCDD contaminates rivers and other drinking water sources, impairs ecosystems, and has well-documented adverse impacts on human health. Joshua discovered existing TCDD remediation technologies were both inefficient and expensive, limiting their widespread use. He developed a unique material of semiconductor crystals that can affordably and efficiently degrade pollutants using visible light energy.\n\nNot only does the new material successfully degrade TCDD, one of the most stable organic pollutants, but it will degrade most pollutants. The material, once placed in the environment, has no operational costs due to its passive use of visible light. Joshua hopes that the technology will serve as an affordable water pollution remediation option in developing nations. He has received international recognition and was honored with EPA's prestigious Patrick H. Hurd Sustainability Award for his innovative approach to producing a safe, affordable, and simple method for degrading pollutants.\n\nEPA Region 5\n\nCYC Sunshine Youth Garden\n\nIllinois\n\nTeam: Chicago Youth Centers-Nature Team\n\nThe Chicago Youth Center (CYC) Nature Team is a group of 18 energetic, enthusiastic, and outdoor-loving students aged 5-9 years who plan and care for the CYC Sunshine Youth Garden. The garden serves as an outdoor classroom for students to learn and teach others; a peaceful place for kids to work, play, and relax together; and a place for students to share fun activities with their families, friends, and neighbors. Garden mainstays include a community mural, sculptures, a memory garden, and vegetable and herb gardens.\n\nThe Sunshine Youth Garden engages students year-round. In the winter, the Nature Team brainstormed and planned the garden for the following summer. For the 2014-2015 season, the Nature Team planned sections of the garden, including a strawberry patch, a sunflower challenge, and \"Worm City\" - an area for composting, checking weather, and digging worms. In the spring, team members hosted a community garden party to kick off the gardening season. Over the summer and fall, team members donate"
