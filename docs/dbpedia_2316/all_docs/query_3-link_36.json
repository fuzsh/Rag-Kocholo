And last year’s senior class led the way as Thomas Jefferson went 21-7 overall, 5-1 in conference play and advanced all the way to the Class 1 quarterfinals.\n\nWith that, the Cavaliers will rely on a large group of underclassmen this season.\n\nTwo players return with prior varsity experience—junior forward Ethan Renger and sophomore forward/center Kohl Thurman.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Thurman averaged 2.6 points and three rebounds a game last winter, while the 6-2 Renger averaged one point and one rebound a contest.\n\nSophomores Jaxx Wisdom (G), Kyler Beard (G) and Trenton Farley (G) and freshmen Jack Twiss (PG), Spencer Long (F), Yousuf Mokhtar (F) and Simon Studer (G) are players who are expected to compete for varsity playing time.\n\nCoach Myers noted that Twiss is the leading candidate to take over the starting point guard duties.\n\nAdditionally, Myers said he expects Wisdom, Long and Mokhtar to compete for starting roles.\n\nWhile the young and untested Cavaliers may experience some growing pains along the way, Coach Myers is confident his squad will make steady progress throughout the ’23 campaign.\n\n“We are in a rebuilding phase as the old saying goes,” Myers said. “We have graduated several key players over the past two seasons and will have to look to young players this year to fill those roles. While we will likely lean on several freshmen this season, the expectation is that we will get better as the season goes on. Though young, this group seems hungry to get better.”\n\nOf course, overcoming so much inexperience will be the team’s main key to success this winter.\n\n“Our youth and inexperience will be a big area of concern for us,” Myers said. “These kids are going to have to trust the process, and not get discouraged as we battle through the season.\n\n“I’m fully confident this group will work hard and continue to push for success – whether that success is found this season or in future seasons is yet to be determined.”\n\nThe Cavaliers will open the 2023-24 season at home against Exeter on Nov. 20.\n\nDISTRICT FOOTBALL: Joplin advances to title game, will meet Nixa on Friday\n\nFor the second time in three years, the Joplin Eagles will play for a district championship.\n\nThird-seeded Joplin built a significant halftime advantage and then held off second-seeded Kickapoo late for a 45-29 victory in the Class 6 District 5 semifinals on Friday.\n\nWith the win, Joplin (7-3) will travel to conference rival and top-seeded Nixa (10-0) at 7 p.m. on Friday for the district crown.\n\nIn the district semifinals on Friday in Springfield, Joplin built a comfortable 35-7 lead by intermission before the hosts battled back in the second half.\n\nIn the opening frame, Joplin QB Hobbs Gooch ran for a 1-yard score and also completed a 70-yard touchdown pass to Davin Thomas. Kickapoo’s first quarter touchdown came on a 98-yard kick return.\n\nUp 14-7, Joplin recorded three unanswered touchdowns in the second quarter. Gooch scored on a 76-yard QB keeper, Johnny Williams had a pick-six and Gooch added his third score of the game on an 11-yard run for a 35-7 cushion.\n\nKickapoo (8-2) outscored Joplin 22-7 in the third quarter, with the Eagles’ score coming on a 44-yard run by Quin Renfro.\n\nUp 42-29, Joplin’s defense came up with back to back stops.\n\nA 32-yard field goal from Toby Ipsen was the lone score of the fourth quarter and accounted for the final margin.\n\nThe Eagles are in the back in a district title game after a one year absence. Joplin fell to Lee’s Summit North in the district championship game in 2021.\n\nThe Eagles are looking to capture their first district title since 2019, the year they finished as the state runner-up.\n\nIn the other semifinal, Nixa beat fifth-seeded Ozark 50-0.\n\nOf course, Nixa edged Joplin 35-27 back in Week 5.\n\nThe rematch will take place on Friday night, with the season and a district championship on the line.\n\nSTATE CROSS COUNTRY: Joplin, Webb City runners earn all-state honors in Class 5\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. — Joplin and Webb City both had all-state performances at the Class 5 MSHSAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday at the Gans Creek Cross Country Course.\n\nTwo area runners earned all-state recognition on the boys side, as Joplin junior Chance Tindall finished ninth in 15 minutes, 29 seconds and Webb City senior Evan Stevens finished 28th in 15:45.\n\nTindall finished 32nd last year as a sophomore.

The Bulldogs finished 16th in the team standings.\n\nCompeting for Carl Junction were Isaac Willoughby (39th), Jack Lawson (67th), Luke Battagler (106th), Nikash Yeary (143rd), Chance Golden (151st), Alexander Allison (152nd) and Jacob Garrett (153rd).\n\nLincoln College Prep’s Isaac Rivera took first in 14:54.\n\nThe top four teams were Festus (91), Platte County (99), Lincoln College Prep (110) and Webster Groves (134).\n\nCLASS 4 GIRLS\n\nCarl Junction’s Madilyn Dalton finished 101st and Marissa Newman was 124th.\n\nHarrisonville’s Kayleigh Norris won the race in 18:07.\n\nThe top four teams were St. Joseph’s Academy (110), West Plains (133), Festus (137) and Nerinx Hall (144).\n\nCLASS 3 BOYS\n\nEast Newton senior Chase Sorrell finished second in the Class 3 boys race with a time of 15:32.

Lamar was 14th.\n\nCLASS 3 GIRLS\n\nIn the Class 3 girls race, Cassville’s Jadyn Williams-Reed finished 39th, while Lamar’s Abigail Diggs was 46th and Mount Vernon’s Rylee Simons finished 65th.\n\nCompeting for College Heights were junior Marla Anderegg (79th) and sophomore Jesalin Bever (114th).\n\nSouthern Boone’s Alexandra Volkart was the champion in 18:27.\n\nThe top four teams were St. Charles West (55), Westminster Christian (142), Lutheran-St. Charles (149) and Lexington (161).\n\nFULL RESULTS: MSHSAA: 2023 Cross Country Championship Information Central\n\nDISTRICT FOOTBALL: Carthage brushes off Raytown South to create rematch with Webb City\n\nRAYTOWN, Mo. — Only two points separated Carthage and Raytown South in the district standings before Friday night.\n\nSo the Tigers made sure that the point separation on the gridiron was a much different story.\n\nThird-seeded Carthage erased an early two-score deficit and dominated the second half — including a 28-point fourth quarter — to earn a 56-28 road victory over No. 2 Raytown South in the Class 5 District 7 semifinal round.\n\nJunior running back Landyn Collins carried the load for the Tigers, starring with a five-touchdown performance.\n\nThe Cardinals (8-3) even made it a one-score game at 28-21 midway through the third quarter before Carthage (7-4) blew the doors off the home side the rest of the way.\n\nThe Tigers, leading by the same seven-point lead after three quarters, finished the contest with a 28-7 margin to propel Carthage into an intriguing district title game at Webb City next Friday.\n\nThe Tigers didn’t hold a lead until the 18-second mark of the second quarter. In fact, Raytown South raced out to a 14-0 lead, with the second score coming after a surprising onside kick that the home side recovered.\n\nThe Cardinals scored on their first two drives—both coming through the air with Sheldon Locke linking up with Iowa State commit Marcus Neal on 51- and 11-yard touchdown completions. Those were two of Neal’s four receiving touchdowns on the day, proving his status as a three-star and DI recruit who plays both ways.\n\nCarthage chipped away offensively and leaned on a stout defense to change the guard in this district semifinal matchup. Tigers junior quarterback Brady Carlton scored on an 11-yard scamper in the first quarter and Collins tallied his first rushing touchdown to make it 14-all with 43 seconds left before the break.\n\nThe Tigers managed to get into the end zone once more before visiting the guest locker room after recovering a fumble on the ensuing kickoff and Collins rushing for a 7-yard score and a 21-14 halftime lead with 18 seconds left.\n\nCollins continued his momentum with a short touchdown run on Carthage’s first series of the second half, providing a two-score lead at the time. But Neal made a toe-tapping 8-yard reception for his third score on the night, cutting the Tigers’ lead to 28-21 with less than five minutes remaining in the third.\n\nThen, Carthage went into overdrive. Carlton connected with junior receiver Langston Morgan on a 23-yard touchdown before the Tigers recovered their own onside kick, and Collins ran one in from four yards out for a 42-21 lead midway through the fourth.\n\nNeal then proved he wasn’t quite finished, bringing in a 65-yard reception on the near sideline to trim the lead to 42-28 with 7:10 left. But Collins had an answer with a three-yard touchdown run before Morgan recorded a 36-yard pick-6 to put the game out of reach with 2:01 remaining.\n\nCarthage, which started the season 0-3, will play for a district championship next Friday at top-seeded Webb City (8-2). The Tigers handed Webb City one of its two losses 20-13 on Oct. 6 in Carthage.\n\nDISTRICT FOOTBALL: Friday’s semifinal scores; title games set\n\nCLASS 6 DISTRICT 5\n\nSemifinals\n\n(1) Nixa 50, (5) Ozark 0\n\n(3) Joplin 45, (2) Kickapoo 29\n\nTitle game (Nov. 10)\n\nJoplin at Nixa, 7 p.m.\n\nCLASS 5 DISTRICT 7\n\nSemifinals\n\n(1) Webb City 71, (4) Belton 20\n\n(3) Carthage 56, (2) Raytown South 28\n\nTitle game (Nov. 10)\n\nCarthage at Webb City, 7 p.m.\n\nCLASS 4 DISTRICT 7\n\nSemifinals\n\n(1) Nevada 43, (4) Grandview 0\n\n(3) Carl Junction 17, (2) Harrisonville 7\n\nTitle game (Nov. 10)\n\nCarl Junction at Nevada, 7 p.m.\n\nCLASS 4 DISTRICT 6\n\nSemifinals\n\n(1) Bolivar 53, (5) Hillcrest 14\n\n(3) McDonald County 35, (2) West Plains 33\n\nTitle game (Nov. 10)\n\nMcDonald County at Bolivar, 7 p.m.\n\nCLASS 3 DISTRICT 6\n\nSemifinals\n\n(1) Seneca 48, (4) Cassville 0\n\n(2) Mount Vernon 45, (3) Reeds Spring 13\n\nTitle game (Nov. 10)\n\nMount Vernon at Seneca, 7 p.m.\n\nCLASS 2 DISTRICT 5\n\nSemifinals\n\n(1) Lamar 47, (5) Diamond 0\n\n(2) Adrian 49, (3) Butler 14\n\nTitle game (Nov. 10)\n\nAdrian at Lamar, 7 p.m.\n\n8-MAN DISTRICT 1\n\nSemifinals\n\n(1) Lockwood 62, (4) Greenfield 12\n\n(3) Liberal 44, (2) College Heights 28\n\nTitle game (Nov. 10)\n\nLiberal at Lockwood, 7 p.m.\n\nDISTRICT FOOTBALL: Webb City routs Belton, advances to title game\n\nWEBB CITY, Mo. — The Webb City Cardinals showed no signs of rust after a bye week.\n\nIn an explosive start, top-seeded Webb City scored on its first four offensive plays in dramatic fashion en route to a dominating 71-20 win over fourth-seeded Belton on Friday night in the Class 5 District 7 semifinals at Cardinal Stadium.\n\n“We had a great week of practice last week and it carried over to this week,” Webb City coach Ryan McFarland said. “We wanted to clean some things up in the bye week and I think we proved we did that tonight. We’ve really been emphasizing getting off to a fast start. All year it seemed like we went into halftime struggling a little bit before playing better in the second half. Playing better in the first half was a priority and I think we accomplished that tonight.”\n\nWebb City (8-2) will host third-seeded Carthage (7-4) in the district title game next Friday night.\n\n“It should be a great environment and it will be a big test for us,” McFarland said. “Who else would you want to play to try and win a district championship?”\n\nPlaying in front of a large home crowd on John Roderique Field, Webb City built a commanding 64-7 lead by halftime in the program’s first-ever meeting with Belton.\n\nThe Cardinals scored 37 unanswered points to start the night.\n\n“We were doing things right and the offensive line played really well,” McFarland said of the fast start. “That group has played well all year. And at this time of the year, you like to see the guys doing the things they’ve been coached to do.”\n\nGAME RECAP\n\nOn his team’s first offensive snap of the night, Webb City sophomore quarterback Gabe Johnson sprinted 80 yards to the end zone.\n\nAfter Belton’s second punt of the night, the Cardinals once again needed just one play to score. Johnson ran 54 yards on the first play from scrimmage for the touchdown, giving Webb City an early 14-0 advantage with 6:16 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nThe Cardinals made it three touchdowns on three plays when senior running back Omari Jackson, in his first action since Week 3, sprinted 35 yards to give the hosts a 21-0 lead with 3:23 left in the opening frame.\n\nA bad snap resulted in a safety and gave the Cardinals a 23-0 advantage.\n\nNext, Braden McKee completed a 78-yard touchdown pass to Drew Vonder Haar on the fourth offensive play of the night for a commanding 30-0 cushion.\n\n“That’s the kids believing in our system and just doing their jobs,” McFarland said of scoring four times on four plays. “We got a lot of people involved. We keep telling the guys to prepare themselves and make the most of their opportunities. They were able to do that tonight.”\n\nJackson’s 21-yard touchdown run made it 37-0 early in the second quarter before Belton got on the board on Tyrion Thomas’ 84-yard kick return.\n\nA 56-yard touchdown pass to Jonah Spieker, an 8-yard run by Andrew Elwell, Andrew Young’s 84-yard pick six and Slade Hurd’s 98-yard run made it 64-7 at the break.\n\nAfter intermission, Jackson Lucas ran for a 95-yard touchdown run to give the Cardinals a whopping 71-7 lead.\n\nBelton scored twice in the fourth quarter against Webb City’s deep reserves for the final margin.\n\nNAMES & NUMBERS\n\nWebb City recorded 578 yards on just 29 plays. The Cardinals ran for 444 yards on 27 attempts and passed for 134 yards on two completions.\n\nWebb City only had possession for 15 minutes, 16 seconds, while Belton had a time of possession of 32:44.\n\nJohnson ran twice for 133 yards and two scores. Alex Dunne converted 9-of-10 PAT kicks.\n\nThe 71 points is believed to have tied the school record. Webb City also scored 71 points on Oct. 24 of 2014 against McDonald County (71-0). The Cardinals scored 70 against Nevada in 2004. Those are believed to be the only two times the Cardinals have reached 70 points.\n\nBelton (6-5) compiled 235 yards on 62 plays, with 156 rushing and 79 passing.\n\nThe Webb City defense recorded four interceptions.\n\n“Belton has a talented quarterback and we were able to get pressure on him with our D-line,” McFarland said. “We were able to drop our linebackers. It was a great job by our defensive coordinators and our defensive players for sure.”\n\nWHAT’S NEXT?\n\nWebb City will host longtime rival Carthage with the district championship on the line next Friday at 7 p.m.\n\nCarthage knocked off second-seeded Raytown South 56-28 in the other semifinal.\n\nOf course, Carthage defeated Webb City 20-13 in Week 7.\n\n“Coach (Jon) Guidie does an awesome job and we know they’re a talented team,” McFarland said. “Our guys wanted a chance to play them again and they’re going to get it. It’s time to get back to work and try to figure out what went wrong last time and we’ll try to fix it. They were the more physical team last time, so that’s going to be a point of emphasis for sure.”\n\nCLASS 5 DISTRICT 7 SEMIFINALS\n\nWEBB CITY 71, BELTON 20\n\nBelton 0 7 0 13 —20\n\nWebb City 30 34 7 0 ­—71\n\nSCORING SUMMARY\n\nWC: Gabe Johnson 80 run (Alex Dunne kick)\n\nWC: Johnson 54 run (Dunne kick)\n\nWC: Omari Jackson 35 run (Dunne kick)\n\nWC: Safety.\n\nWC: Drew Vonder Haar 78 pass from Braden McKee (Dunne kick)\n\nWC: Jackson 21 run (Dunne kick)\n\nBEL: Tyrion Thomas 84 kick return (Coby Clark kick)\n\nWC: Jonah Spieker 56 pass from Johnson (Dunne kick)\n\nWC: Andrew Elwell 8 run (Kick failed)\n\nWC: Andrew Young 84 interception return (Dunne kick)\n\nWC: Slade Hurd 98 run (Dunne kick)\n\nWC: Jackson Lucas 95 run (Dunne kick)\n\nBEL: Jacob Perez 19 run (Run failed)\n\nBEL: Alek Colombo 58 run (Clark kick).\n\nFULL STATS: Webb City HS (webbcitycardinals.com)\n\nSTATE CROSS COUNTRY: McAuley Catholic, College Heights runners earn all-state honors\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. — McAuley Catholic junior Michael Parrigon finished fourth in Class 1 to lead a strong area contingent at the 49th MSHSAA Cross Country Championships on Friday morning at the Gans Creek Cross Country Course.\n\nParrigon toured the 5K course in 16 minutes, 28 seconds.\n\nFinishing ahead of Parrigon were West Nodaway’s Riley Blay (15:48), Marion C. Early’s Landon Duchscherer (15:55) and Dora’s Cade Nold (16:26). Blay won for the third straight season.\n\nParrigon’s showing is the best state finish in program history for the McAuley boys. Max Ostmeyer finished 17th in 2016 and Parrigon was 21st last year.\n\n“I thought he could be in the top five,” McAuley Catholic coach Andy Youngworth said. “The kid from Dora is really good. And I’m not going to use this as an excuse, but it’s a fact that Michael played two soccer matches this week, including last night. Max Anreder also had to deal with that. Both ran well. I thought Michael was in a good position for most of the race.”\n\nIn addition to Parrigon, three other Joplin area runners finished in the top 30 to earn all-state honors in the Class 1 boys race.\n\nJasper junior Leland Harris placed 20th in 17:40, while McAuley’s duo of Trae Veer (17:42) and Will Mollnow (17:43) finished 22nd and 23rd, respectively. Veer is a sophomore and Mollnow is just a freshman.\n\n“Will passed 11 or 12 guys in the last 400 meters to medal,” Youngworth noted. “He had a great finish.”\n\nThomas Jefferson had two athletes competing — freshman Liam Cook finished 34th in 18:03 and junior Braden Honeywell-Lynch was 45th in 18:12.\n\nAlso competing for McAuley were Alex Bohachick (102nd), Connor Taffner (111th), Cliff Nolan (137th) and Max Anreder (141st).\n\nThe Warriors finished fifth out of 15 teams in the Class 1 standings with 136 points. The top four teams take home a trophy.\n\nFor the Warriors, it was a memorable day.\n\n“We had three state medalists and that’s the first time that’s happened in school history,” Youngworth said. “Last year we had two medalists and that was the first time that had happened. I’m really pleased.\n\n“I think the boys were disappointed we took fifth. We were six points away from fourth and nine points away from third. Going in, I felt like there were three or four schools that could finish anywhere from third to sixth. But I thought our kids ran well. We worked really hard this year, from August 7th to today. And that doesn’t include the time in the summer. We put in a lot of time and effort and I think it showed.”\n\nOf note, all of McAuley’s boys will return next season, as there are no seniors on the roster.\n\nHermitage (74), Van Buren (97), Oak Ridge (127) and Vienna (130) were the top four teams.\n\nThere were 170 runners in the boys race.\n\nCLASS 1 GIRLS\n\nLiberal freshman Ally Barton finished third in the Class 1 girls race with a time of 20:17, leading the Bulldogs to a runner-up finish in the team standings.\n\nSouth Nodaway’s Mya Wray was the Class 1 champion in 19:11 and Stoutland’s Mallory Shaw was the runner-up in 20:15.\n\nEarning all-state recognition with their respective top-30 showings, McAuley Catholic senior Kendall Ramsey finished ninth in 20:46, while Liberal junior Taylor Swarnes was 10th in 20:53 and McAuley freshman Olivia Parrigon placed 11th in 20:56 to give the Warriors five all-state performances on the day.\n\nLiberal’s Abby Barton finished 30th and teammate Bailey Couch was 34th, while Thomas Jefferson’s Macie Shifferd finished 40th and teammate Sarah Mueller was 52nd.\n\nAlso competing for McAuley were Riley Sears (69th), Marbellie Villanueva (91st) and Samantha Perrin (129th).\n\nThe top four teams were Chadwick (60), Liberal (98), East Carter (112) and Paris (130).\n\nThe runner-up showing is the best state finish in school history for the Liberal girls, who were fourth in 2017.\n\nMcAuley finished eighth in the standings with 169 points.\n\n“Our girls really had a great meet,” Youngworth said. “We went from 13th last year to eighth this year. Olivia finishing 11th as a freshman is great. It was Kendall’s fourth state appearance and second medal. She actually ran faster this year than last year but finished one place lower this year. There are a lot of good runners in Class 1. I’m proud of all of our girls. Riley Sears had a good day. That’s another freshman who put together some really good workouts and those translated into faster times at the meets. Marbellie and Sam ran well and will both be back. Kendall is our only senior. You can’t replace her. She’s a great kid.”\n\nThere were 143 runners and 13 full teams.\n\nCLASS 2 BOYS\n\nCompeting in Class 2 on Friday, College Heights Christian sophomore Colton McMillan finished 28th in 17:25 to earn all-state honors. McMillan was the lone area product to earn all-state recognition in the Class 2 boys race.\n\nAlso competing for CHC were sophomore Owen Horton (101st) and freshman Connor Jordan (106th).\n\nDiamond’s Wyatt Housh (88th), Purdy’s duo of Jayden Griffis (104th) and Logan Manwarren (105th) and Pierce City’s Joseph Leavitt (132nd) also competed.\n\nWoodland’s Reed Layton was the Class 2 champion in 16:25.\n\nThe top four teams were Woodland (96), KC Lutheran (137), New Covenant (168) and North Platte (175).\n\nThere were 169 runners and 16 full teams.\n\nCLASS 2 GIRLS\n\nPierce City sophomore Emma Hunt finished 12th in the Class 2 girls race with a time of 20:16. Hunt was the lone local runner to earn a top-30 finish in the Class 2 girls race.\n\nAlso competing from the region were Sarcoxie’s Laney Dorris (72nd), Pierce City’s Lauren Blackburn (83rd), Purdy’s Courtney Patterson (86th), Sarcoxie’s Ariel Wilson (95th), Pierce City’s Ginger Leavitt (102nd), Sarcoxie’s trio of Lily Garrison (124th), Jordyn Misner (139th) and Natasha Garcia (149th) and Pierce City’s Emily Haasse (154th).\n\nBrentwood’s Kensington Curd was the Class 2 champion in 19:24.\n\nThe top four teams were Lafayette County (111), Woodland (138), Hermann (142) and Stockton (143).\n\nThere were 157 runners and 16 teams.\n\nNotes: College Heights Christian will have girls competing in Saturday’s Class 3 race at 9:45 a.m.\n\nThe Class 4-5 races are also scheduled to be

Of course, the Warriors finished fourth in Class 1 last season.\n\n“It is a great accomplishment to return to state,” McAuley Catholic coach Andy Youngworth said. “Last year was our first time qualifying for state, and I thought we handled the pressure of expecting to qualify this year very well.”\n\nOn a chilly Saturday morning, McAuley junior Michael Parrigon was the district runner-up with a time of 16:35. Marion C. Early’s Landon Duchscherer took first in 15:59.\n\nMcAuley sophomore Trae Veer finished eighth in 17:45, while Jasper junior Leland Harris placed 14th in 17:55 and McAuley freshman Will Mollnow finished 17th in 18:03.\n\nThomas Jefferson had two individual state qualifiers, as junior Braden Honeywell-Lynch placed 19th (18:14) and freshman Liam Cook finished 29th (18:39).\n\nAlso for McAuley, Connor Taffner finished 31st, Alex Bohachick was 41st, Cliff Nolan placed 59th and Max Anreder was 62nd.\n\n“We really had a few kids step up,” Youngworth said of his team’s performance. “Michael had a good early battle with the runner from Marion C. Early, but fell back a bit, forcing him to run alone most of the meet on a cold, windy day. All of our boys ran tough. Will Mollnow finished 17th. It was his best race of the year. Connor Taffner also ran well, as did Alex Bohachick, who benefitted from the cold conditions. Cliff Nolan and Max Anreder rounded out our top seven and were able to put together solid races in their first championship meet.”\n\nAlso competing for Thomas Jefferson were Spencer Long (32nd), Jack Twiss (34th), Ashan Appuhamy (57th), Ringo Snow (58th) and James Sheppard (76th).\n\nMcAuley’s girls also qualified its full team to state.\n\nThe top four girls teams were Chadwick (33), Liberal (47), McAuley Catholic (78) and School of the Ozarks (104).\n\nLiberal freshman Ally Barton was the district medalist with a time of 20:11.\n\nMcAuley Catholic senior Kendall Ramsey placed fifth in 21:00, while freshman Olivia Parrigon was sixth in 21:12 and freshman Riley Sears took 27th in 23:30.\n\nAlso scoring points for McAuley were Marbellie Villanueva (41st) and Samantha Perrin (49th).\n\n“Kendall Ramsey and Olivia Parrigon ran as expected, finishing fifth and sixth, respectively, and really had nice races,” Youngworth said. “Riley Sears ran her best race of the year, running almost a 90 second PR, and was key to our finish. Marbellie Villanueva struggled a bit in the middle of the race but finished well.
