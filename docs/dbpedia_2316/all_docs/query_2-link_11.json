        "text": "A rare winter tornado plowed through the city of St. Louis, MO, in the dead of night on February 10, 1959. It traveled close to 28 miles at an estimated 50-60 mph speed, leaving behind collapsed buildings and littered streets. Sadly, 21 precious souls lost their lives, and 345 were injured.\n\nThe devastating St. Louis, MO F4 tornado of February 10, 1959, developed at 1:40 am CST. The National Weather Service (NWS) indicated in their Storm Data Narrative that the first noticeable damage was found in the Sherman, MO area, in the southwest corner of St. Louis County. Houses and other buildings had varying degrees of damage. Troy L. Cooper lived with his family in one of those homes off South Drive, near the Meramec River. According to The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, the father of four awoke to the sound of howling winds and ran to get his wife and children into the basement. After several minutes they emerged to find part of the roof torn to shreds and their 42-foot porch ripped from the home. He told the paper that several neighboring farms had damaged buildings, and two cows were killed.\n\nAt 1:48 am, a Trans-World Airline Constellation airplane with 24 passengers and five crew members took off from St. Louis Lambert Airport en route to Kansas City. They began to experience the supercell that produced the tornado only minutes after takeoff, approximately 15 miles west of St. Louis. Per an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on February 10, 1959, the control tower saw the storm on the radar and directed them around it. Per the newspaper, “The pilot replied to the tower that the storm was one of the worst he had ever experienced and that if he had not been detoured, ‘we probably would have flipped over.’”\n\nAccording to Thomas Grazulis in Significant Tornadoes, upon leaving Sherman, the tornado caused “minor damage” for approximately 11 miles as it inched closer to dense residential neighborhoods of St. Louis.\n\nAs the tornado moved into the far southwestern portion of the St. Louis Metro area, it struck the Warson Woods neighborhood with a bit more ferocity. As reported by the St. Louis post-Dispatch on February 10, 1959, the roof was ripped off the home of G. P. Ziegler on Calais Court. The family was not in town at the time. Donald Aker lived on Mark Drive. His carport was blasted across the street into the residence of Ray Kennedy. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat expounded upon the Kennedy family story in an article from February 11, 1959. It was Ray’s son, Gary, 18, who first heard the thunderous roar of the tornado. As he approached his bedroom door, the carport from the Ziegler home slammed against his house. That noise aroused Ray from his slumber. “That woke me up,” Mr. Kennedy told the paper. “I hit the hall just as Gary got his door open. We went to my younger son Jack’s room and tried to pull the door open. We couldn’t–suction or pressure held it shut.” Once they finally entered Jack’s room, they found him covered in glass, and pieces of wood lay strewn on the floor. The paper reported that the child had been sleeping with his head under the covers, and he did not have a scratch on him.\n\nThe vortex skirted portions of Richmond Heights and Franz Park before landing in the Clayton-Tamm and Cheltenham neighborhoods south of Forest Park. At this point, the tornado intensified further, and damage became more widespread. A roof on one home was pulled away and tossed into a tree. An article in the February 10, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted that the owners, Mr. and Mrs. Alphonse Hummert, managed to escape their bedroom and head to the basement before the ceiling crumbled onto their bed. The same newspaper reported that the front section of the roof of the newly built St. James Catholic School on the corner of Wade and Tamm Avenues was wrecked. A few blocks away on Victoria Avenue, the tornado brought down the bell tower of the Memorial Congregational Church. The Reverend Paul Zieke told the St. Louis Globe-Democrat in a February 11, 1959 article that “the tower fell through the roof of the two-story brick Sunday School building.”\n\nKTVI Channel 2, an ABC affiliate at the time, was located at the intersection of Berthold, Oakland, and Hampton Avenues. The destructive winds toppled the station’s 575-foot tower, which fell to the east and smashed through the roofs of two apartment buildings off Oakview Place. Five vehicles parked at the complexes were totaled. The top portion of the tower landed in the St. Louis Arena parking lot.\n\nMr. and Mrs. James Fleener were asleep in the bedroom of their third-floor apartment at 104 Oakview Place. Baby daughter, Lisa, lay in her crib across the room. Per an article in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat on February 15, 1959, Mrs. Fleemer heard a noise outside, went to the window, saw it was raining, and heard the sound of the wind amplifying. She went back to bed and told her husband she was scared. The paper described that James got up and headed to the living room to close an open window. His wife followed and stopped near the bedroom door. “He got to the middle of the room and the tower fell on him,” Mrs. Fleener told the newspaper. “Just at that moment, I looked up and debris started falling in my face.”\n\nThe St. Louis Globe-Democrat said, “Steel bars crashed between the Fleeners’ bed and the crib. Plaster, brick and mortar covered the floor. The baby was crying. Mrs. Fleener, cut on the face, arms and legs, ran to the bedroom. The crib was strewn with debris but the baby appeared safe.” From the living room came a cry for help. The devoted wife fumbled around in the dark to look for her husband. “I couldn’t see what I was doing,” she stated. “I just heard his voice. I started pulling off the debris until I had bruises on my fingers.” Mrs. Fleener was able to dig James free, and neighbors and firefighters led the family out of the apartment safely. “I was level-headed,” Mrs. Fleener said. “I had to be. But that night I broke down a little.”\n\nThe damage at St. Louis Arena was not confined to impact marks from the KTVI tower in the parking lot. The destruction was documented well in the February 10, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The Arena B building, which housed the roller skating rink and bowling alleys, was hit. Per the newspaper, “The roller rink was virtually demolished, the roof collapsing into the one-story structure. Brick walls were damaged. A fire wall separated the skating rink from the 48 bowling alleys. A portion of the roof of the second section collapsed, falling on alleys 13 to 24. The bowling alleys were swept by rain, and appeared heavily damaged.” Part of the high-arched roof of the arena itself was ripped away, and windows were smashed. The south wall of The “A” building crumbled.\n\nEast of the arena, the ferris wheel at Forest Park Highlands Amusement Park was “bent double” by the tornadic winds. A wooden wall was blown down, and at least six “tall sycamore trees bordering Oakland Avenue, in front of the Highlands, were uprooted.”\n\nThe February 12, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat shared the story of Vernon S. Beck. The 72-year-old was a big game hunter and veteran of expeditions to places like Africa. The paper documented some of the “close brushes with death,” Mr. Beck had had in his life. “I guess I live under a lucky star,” Vernon told the paper. “This was my third close shave.”\n\nThe explorer almost drowned in Lake Superior. While in Africa, his car went off a mountain road. The driver was killed, and three others were hospitalized. “I went all the way down the mountainside and got only a split lip and a skinned knee.” In the middle of the night on February 10, Vernon was aroused from his slumber in his second-story apartment on West Pine Boulevard by two bricks grazing his head. His wife, Lola, who was sleeping in another room, came running in and asked if he was alright.\n\n“I answered I thought I was, and muttered something about being hit by a couple of bricks. They were both on my pillow. As soon as I got up, I saw that the wall was gone. My bed was sitting on the edge of nothing. Then we found the windows were out everywhere. Everything was strewn around the apartment. The tenants upstairs-it’s a six-family building-came down and told us their walls were gone, too, their furniture sucked out. Thank God, no one was hurt. One girl, Vivian Krespi, a graduate student from Turkey, lost her money. It was in a dresser that was blown away. Only a few days ago she moved her bed from the outside wall to the inside. Otherwise, she’d have been blown into the street. Nancy Wehner, a medical student from Detroit, was in a second floor bedroom. The wall was gone there, too.”\n\n“A jolting crash which shook the building woke me at 2:20am. Something was splattering across my window like machine gun bullets. I cowered in a doorway between two rooms, having heard somewhere that this was a relatively safe place during a tornado. Then it was over. I crept to my wind, with bits of glass, pebbles, twigs and roofing crunching under my feet on the floor.\n\nOutside the window, the scene was one of devastation. I could see the ragged edge of a brick wall outlined against the dark sky, where a corner had been ripped off the building across the street from my apartment hotel at 4907 West Pine bl.\n\nIn the corridors people were running and shouting excitedly. I dressed quickly and ran to the lobby. The hotel manager was there, receiving reports of broken windows throughout the building. Apparently nobody was hurt.\n\nMy car was parked on the street in the next block of West Pine, to the east. The first cars I could see, lining the glass and debris strewn street, were crumpled by fallen trees. Mine was luckier. Only a smashed window and a twister aerial.\n\nAn eerie stillness had fallen. The air was warm as a summer night. I stood in the middle of the street with a few other people who had begun to gather, and not a word was spoken. We could only gaze in silence at the gaping holes where there had been apartment building walls.\n\nA small wooden building on a parking lot beside my hotel was now a heap of splintered lumber at the curbing. A steel fire escape about 20 feet from my window had been ripped off and flung against a near-by brick store building.”\n\nThe five children and family pet dog of Ocie Mae Cole had been sleeping on their third-floor residence above the Golden Eagle nightclub. When the tornado struck, three of the children were injured and taken to the City Hospital. Hours later, they were all treated and reunited with their worried mother and siblings. However, their pet Trixie was assumed not to have survived.\n\nMeanwhile, after spending about 80 hours above the wreckage, a roofer, Doyle Sander, and rescuers on the third floor found a dog alive. She had survived by huddling in a sleeping box as beams descended violently around her. In a February 14, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Russ Frederic recalled an ironic happy memory with the pup. “It started wagging its tail and licking our hands like mad. It was so glad to see somebody. It was a sight to see.” Mr. Frederic was the vice president of a roofing firm working on the Golden Eagle building. Given the tiny miracle and circumstances, the dog was given the name “Tornado” by her rescuers. Through all the chaos, the poor canine had initially lost her owners. However, Mr. Sander was able to track down the Coles, and Trixie was soon reunited with the jubilant family.\n\nWithin the vicinity of Gaslight Square along Olive Street, several residences were severely damaged, destroyed, or rendered uninhabitable. The large family of Mr. and Mrs. Ovie Johnson and their ten children (ages 2 to 17) was among those seeking a temporary place to live in the storm’s immediate aftermath. Leaving with only clothing they could salvage, the Johnsons fled to nearby Galilee Baptist Church, where an emergency quarters was in place. Nina Mae Winters and her 11-year-old daughter followed suit from the same apartment complex. “We’re grateful to be out of the cold and to be alive,” Mrs. Winters said in the February 11, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. At a nearby multi-story flat along Olive Street, 20 people were rescued from the rubble. Less than a block away from the Golden Eagle on Olive Street, Major League Baseball star first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, Joe Cunningham, was hosting a late-night Bible study. He and his friend Teddy Glenn were at Cunningham’s apartment above Smokey Joe’s Grecian Terrace, where Glenn worked as a cook. Cunningham described his terrifying encounter that night on the February 11, 1959 editions of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat and Paducah Sun, and in a 1997 interview featured on the Nine PBS’ 1959 Tornado | Living St. Louis YouTube documentary of the event: “My buddy and I were discussing a Bible passage. I heard the wind and kind of felt the big glass double doors bulge between the front and middle rooms. Then there was a roar. The room began to dance. I got up to check the doors when this big chunk of the ceiling fell onto the chair where I had been sitting. Teddy made it into the hall and was blown right into the kitchen when the wind blew out the window. Teddy landed on the floor and the wind blew a nail into the heel of his foot. I crouched in a corner of the next room until we could make our way to the street. When we finally got dressed and went down the stairway, there was a lot of rocks and glass and everything there. And when we went out on the street, then we saw, it was like an air raid. The police and rescue squads arrived with remarkable speed and did a wonderful job. They pulled a woman with two babies apparently unhurt out of the next apartment.”\n\nLeaving Gaslight Square in ruins, the tornado continued its brutal onslaught as it crossed the 4200 block of Washington Avenue. Many multi-family homes filled with sleeping residents were flattened, and death became more frequent. Firemen arrived and frantically began searching for survivors. One home revealed the lifeless bodies of Belle Bugg, 24, and her son Lee Jr., 17 months, both of whom had suffocated under the collapse of their home. The father, Lee Bugg Sr., 26, along with Nathaniel Brown, 15, Marlene Carter, 25, Wilbert Carter, 2, Deborah Williams, 2, Catherine Williams, 23, and Marie Williams, 17, all survived their injuries.\n\nNear the intersection of Washington Avenue and Whittier Street, the Brown family sheltered on the first floor of their apartment. According to the February 13, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Willie Brown and her two children, Theodore, 12, and Nathaniel, 15, were huddled in the kitchen as the tornado began to rip at their home. All of the windows blew out, and a wall was torn away. Able to act, Willie started to rescue her family and neighbors ahead of law enforcement efforts en route. She saved her granddaughter from a door that had fallen on her. Nathaniel was found injured but would recover. However, Willie’s sister Zula Brown, 42, was found dead under the rubble. It was the second time in the past year that Willie had lost a family member, as her husband had passed away just three months prior. In total, there were six injuries at the apartment.\n\nNeighboring the Browns, the Brunson family was left scrambling. Having survived the twister, they were now homeless, as their house was ultimately destroyed. Given the understandable state of discomfort, Mr. Brunson, a local restaurant porter, was worried about the possibility of his pregnant wife suddenly giving birth. After gathering what clothes they could, the Brunsons wandered around the debris-filled streets for hours before they were able to rent a hotel room. In the meantime, the Red Cross stepped in. They offered fresh clothing and hotel expenses until the Brunsons could find a new home.\n\nAs the tornado violently established its presence in the sleepy residential neighborhood of Central West End, only 2/3 of a mile away, a different phenomenon was recorded at St. Louis University. Along the 3600 block of West Pine Boulevard, the institution’s gymnasium housed a seismograph in its basement. It picked up “unusual recordings,” according to a February 11, 1959 article in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. A director at the university, Dr. Ross R. Heinrich, noted that “such recordings by seismographs are rather rare. The instrument would have to be close to the center of a tornado to register it so clearly.” The peak of these recordings was noted between 2:13-2:15 am CST while the tornado was ripping through densely populated areas nearby.\n\nTruck driver Roosevelt Hester was at his home near the intersection of Delmar Boulevard and Whittier Street when the tornado reached him. Just across the road was a three-story multi-family home at 4202 Delmar Boulevard, where at least seventeen people resided. Hester described what he saw that night as the twister rumbled through in a February 10, 1959 edition of Effingham Daily News. “I was looking out the window when I first heard the storm. I saw the [home across the street] go just before I ducked. Funny, the only sound I heard was the hail which came before the wind.”\n\nOne of the seventeen in the 4202 Delmar home was the building’s owner, Knox Brown, 37. According to the February 15, 1959, St. Louis Globe-Democrat publication, Brown had heard the building begin to rattle, thinking perhaps burglars were attempting to break in. He hurried in his pajamas to check the front door, only to be met with a roaring intruder far more sinister than a typical neighborhood robber. In an instant, he retreated to the floor as the structure crumbled around him under the force of violent winds. Miraculously, Brown survived, with his only injury occurring when a bed fell onto his arm.\n\nImmediately following the tornado, rescuers descended upon Delmar Boulevard, hoping to find survivors. Fireman Harold Hotop and Rescue Squad man John Rodcay described their groups’ rescue efforts and discouraging obstacles at the 4202 Delmar home in a February 12, 1959, St. Louis Globe-Democrat article.\n\nA couple of doors down, Andrew Taylor said the noise woke him up as the tornado was approaching. In the February 15, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Taylor said he “reads the Bible a little bit, like I do when I wake up like that.” Minutes later, Taylor realized danger was imminent. “There was something roaring like two or three wood-burning locomotives. I jumped to the window and there was a giant bonfire of lightning coming out of the southwest. Then the window blew in and the dust and wind blinded me.”\n\nTaylor and his wife survived, but she was seriously injured when a slamming door lacerated her hand. While attending to her wound, Taylor looked around and began to realize the scope of catastrophe as the injured rose from the debris-filled streets like zombies.\n\nJust to the southeast of the Delmar Boulevard/Whittier Street intersection, Arleatha Lunceford was expecting the birth of her eighth child over the next month. She and her seven children, ages ranging from two to sixteen, were in their second-floor apartment when the violent winds reached them. An article from the February 13, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch described their struggles after the tornado spared their lives. Nearly all their possessions were a loss. Clothes and dishes littered their home. Lunceford had spent all of her money for the month on essentials. The family sought help from a Red Cross station at Samaritan Temple Methodist Church, where they were given food, bedding, clothing for the children, and shelter.\n\nThe violent winds continued to afflict several sections of the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood. Per the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, on February 10, 1959, at the American Packing Company, a 60-foot portion of a wall crumbled. A large garage next to the Laclede Packing Company plant was obliterated, and several meat delivery trucks inside were crushed. The paper also reported that in the 1800 block of Prairie Avenue, “the entire front wall of a two-story building containing 14 flats was sheared off by the wind. Interiors of rooms were exposed like pigeon-holes in an old-fashioned desk.”\n\nJoseph Evans was a resident in one of those apartments. He told the Dispatch that he turned his radio off just after 2am and saw the storm come in. “The lightning appeared to be getting closer and flashing more frequently,” he stated. “It was getting reddish in color. I felt the building begin to shake. My wife and I were thrown out of bed onto the floor. I told her: ‘If we’re going to die, honey, we’ll die together.’” The couple was not injured, and the paper reported that no one else at the complex was seriously hurt.\n\nThe Bates School at 1912 North Prairie Avenue sustained significant damage. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat stated in a February 11, 1959 article that windows were broken in 21 of the 24 classrooms. Part of a roof overhang and a ventilating tower were wiped away. Mrs. Alice Webb, 84, was rescued from the rubble of what was left of her Cote Brilliante Avenue apartment. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch stated that Hallie Harris, Alice’s granddaughter, was on the first floor when the storm began. “Mrs. Harris said that before she could return to bring down Mrs. Webb, the entire roof and second floor crumbled under the tornado’s impact. Police and volunteer workers dug out Mrs. Webb. She was taken to Homer G. Phillips Hospital with serious injuries.”\n\nNext in line was the northwest corner of the St. Louis Place Neighborhood and then into the Hyde Park area. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat documented the damage at the Irving School on 3829 North 25th Street. “Falling debris tore a hole in the roof. Rafters at one corner were lifted out of position. A parapet wall was demolished. Wind and sash damage, caused by flying debris, was so extensive that the south portion of the school is not usable.” The tornado hit the Farrar Street home of Rosa Coker, 52, and she was killed. Her husband William suffered injuries. More damage occurred off Salisbury Street, with several extracted from collapsed buildings. The roof was removed from the Kroemeke Furniture Company.\n\nThe tornado was nearing the end of its time in Missouri. It pressed over I-70 and into the Near North Riverfront community. A building collapsed at Bierman Iron & Metal Company on Hall Street. As it crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, a tollhouse was “wrecked,” according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on February 10, 1959. “A toll collector on duty was reported to have left the station before the wind struck the bridge.”\n\nAfter crossing the river, the weakening tornado impacted the communities of Venice and Granite City in Illinois. In the latter, several industrial plants were damaged. An article in the February 11, 1959 edition of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat described a section of City Products Corporation Ice House’s roof getting blown away onto nearby Granite City Steel Company railroad tracks. On 19th Street, Union Starch and Refining Company lost a portion of a brick wall on the third story. Shortly beyond this location, the tornado finally lifted. However, the parent storm continued to inflict wind damage in the nearby communities of Collinsville and Edwardsville.\n\nBecause the twister hit in the middle of the night, many were unaware of the extent of the damage in St. Louis until the light of day. Search and rescue had been ongoing through the wee hours of the morning, and with the rising sun, it became evident that the road to recovery would be long for many. The city, though, worked diligently to regain some sense of normalcy for their residents.\n\nThe Red Cross set up four shelters for tornado victims and began raising funds. On February 11, 1959, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat reported that the agency had received more than 1300 inquiries from across the country on the safety of friends and family. On February 10, The Post-Dispatch and its television and radio affiliates, KSD-TV and KSD, created a “Tornado Relief Fund” to help those in need. “The newspaper recognized that the victims hardest hit by the tornado are among those least able to meet the expense of heavy losses and damages they have suffered. For this reason the tornado relief fund was established.” The Post-Dispatch published hundreds of donations that had come in with so many heartfelt notes. Here is just a sampling:\n\nThe organization raised over $80,000 and delivered it to The Red Cross. KMOX Radio held a pledge drive and, by February 12, had raised $30,000 for the victims. Calls came in from across the fruited plain during the 26-hour campaign. The Globe-Democrat reported that “among the many donations received by the St. Louis Bi-State Chapter of the Red Cross to aid tornado victims was a $2 anonymous gift signed, ‘A Widow, a Victim of the 1896 Tornado.’”\n\nPhone scams are nothing new. They happened after the St. Louis tornado disaster and warranted a warning from the Better Business Bureau (BBB). The Globe-Democrat reported just a day after the event for folks to be “on the alert for an expected rash of phony disaster relief appeals.” According to the BBB, “Some of these appeals are no doubt bona fide. But persons who are solicited to give money for the relief of tornado victims should make sure that the solicitor represents an authorized agency.”\n\nWhile there is always news of those trying to take advantage of people during a catastrophe, there are heartwarming stories that outweigh the negative ones. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat posted a story about children at the McKnight Elementary School in University City, MO, who decided, on their own, to help tornado victims. “Miss Rose Adams, fourth-grade teacher, said her pupils-without her suggestion-yesterday voted to give up valentines. They’ll donate money they would normally spend on valentines to disaster relief. Another group, the second graders of Mrs. Edith McKinnon, are going to donate the nickel they would normally spend on dessert in the school cafeteria. Cub Scouts at the school are campaigning for clothes, and a mothers’ organization is collecting food for tornado victims.”\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch announced on February 12, 1959, that work of clearing debris from the streets of St. Louis had been completed two days after the disaster. Only the intersection at Olive Street and Boyle Avenue was still closed at that point to vehicle traffic. Most of the telephone communication had been restored as well. Per the newspaper, “Street Commissioner Gilmore estimated that 2000 truckloads of rubble were removed from streets and alleys. The city employed 115 trucks in the work and each averaged about eight loads a day.” The article continues, “Joseph P. Sestric, director of public safety, praised the work of 350 firemen who were on the job immediately after the storm passed. Using power tools and lifting equipment, they dug 55 persons from the ruins and nine of the 21 bodies.”\n\nInsurance underwriters estimated that the damages to the St. Louis Area totaled $12 million. From the above newspaper, “Gen. Francis P. Hardaway, Civil Defense director, estimated the damage caused by the storm at about one-fourth of that sustained in the city’s 1927 tornado.” Several publications posted a damage survey from the Red Cross. “20 businesses destroyed; 69 businesses with major damage and 354 with minor damage. Twenty-one multiple dwellings destroyed; 141 with major damage and 1104 with minor damage. Two single-family dwellings with major damage and 11 with minor damage.”\n\nThe St. Louis Globe-Democrat published a detailed article one year after the tragic tornado. In it, they recapped areas in the city that had seen improvements and other parts that struggled to rebuild. We looked at that edition and ones for the 30th and 50th anniversaries of the event to get a glimpse at St. Louis after the 1959 twister.\n\nThe 150-foot tall base of the KTVI television tower was still standing. The station had been using a new tower in Sappington. It was unknown a year later if the base would ever be used. It was discovered that it was dismantled in the mid-1980s. St. Louis Arena was still under repair in February of 1960. Renovations finally occurred at the establishment, held several big sporting events, and became the home of NHL’s St. Louis Blues until 1994. The Arena was demolished in 1999.\n\nPer the newspaper a year later, empty lots replaced what used to be apartment buildings in the 4900 block of West Pine Boulevard. McAuley Hall, a Catholic home for businesswomen, was rebuilt, and repairs were near completion at Westmoreland Hotel. The hard-hit section at Boyle and Olive had been entirely restored by February 1960. It was reported that nightclub and antique shop owners refer to the tornado as “the ill wind that blew good.” The area, known as Gaslight Square, was a hub for the jazz scene until the early 1970s.\n\nMiss Adeline Ruenzi, founder of the Service Club for the Blind on Olive Street, told the paper that “insurance and numerous liberal donations have made possible a rebirth of the center, which aids blind and partly blind persons.” An $8,000 renovation had just been completed before the twister struck. Three weeks later, “wiring damaged in the tornado sparked a fire which caused even more destruction to the center.” Miss Ruenzi told the Globe-Democrat, “Thank God, nobody was hurt in the building during the tornado or the fire. Thanks to insurance and generous donations, we have been able to get our building in better shape than it was before the storm. We’re back in business now, as good –or even better–than before.”\n\nThe paper checked in with big-game hunter Vernon Beck. He and his wife moved into an apartment on the same block as before, on West Pine. “We like this neighborhood. I’m an optimist. I think surely we won’t be in the path of a tornado again.”\n\nHopefully, Mr. Beck managed to stay clear of any twisters for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, St. Louis County would see another significant tornado, rated F4, less than ten years after this one on January 24, 1967. It stayed north of the city limits, and tragically three people were killed and 216 injured. That was the last F4/EF4 to strike the metro area until April 22, 2011."
