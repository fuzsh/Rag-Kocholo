        "text": "By Tina Jenkins\n\nBAPA School Liaison\n\nI recently received a few Facebook hits asking me about area schools and was elated to share what I know, because Beverly/Morgan Park hit the lotto when it comes to education, programming for children, and emphasis on family. We really did!\n\nI know you’re thinking, “She’s paid to say that” but that’s not true. My role as BAPA’s School Liaison is to support all schools within our district — public, Catholic, or private.\n\nBAPA is a resource for all schools in the area. I’ve been working with school leaders since 2019 and can attest to their dedication, care, responsibility, and even love for their schools. That kind of leadership along with dedicated teaching talent, supportive staff, and great school families, and it is no wonder that our schools are some of the best in the city and state. See for yourself by visiting bapa.org. Our education page has contact information as well as sites where you can view a school’s performance. Niche.com is a great site to look at schools, particularly private schools like Morgan Park Academy.\n\nOn a personal note, my husband and I raised four children here who attended both Catholic and public schools. We were very satisfied with our choices, and their outcomes — information specialist, business owner and social worker, curator and web specialist, and Navy Corpsman — speak in part to our schools. I suggest doing your research, visiting schools, scheduling shadow days if available, attending open houses, and talking to school principals, teachers, family and trusted neighbors. If you have questions, contact me at tbell@bapa.org.\n\nNow, on to the accolades.\n\nThe pandemic may be waning, but food insecurity, the financial issues and other problems persist. Accordingly, Barnard School’s 5th through 8th grade students teamed with Real Girlz & Cradles to Crayons to spearhead a clothing and hygiene giveaway on May 6.\n\nAccording to Barnard’s IB Coordinator Madeline Lee, donations are no longer being accepted, but she emphasized that giveaway is part of the Barnard’s mission. “Instilling a heart for our neighbors, our community, our world starts from being aware of the needs right in front of us. I want our students to see the faces of the people they are serving, to know that they are and can be a part of a solution. This is one small step towards building a better, kinder world,” Lee said.\n\nAshley Hill, Real Girlz CEO added, “This collaboration with Barnard will allow our mentees to explore their own talents while giving back to their community.”\n\nOn May 6, St. Cajetan School will join communities around the nation to participate in a Color Run, which promotes happiness and positive mental attitude. If you’re tired of screaming in the wind, join them. Call the school, 773-445-4737.\n\nChicago Metro History Day empowers students to become historians who conduct research and share their conclusions. Guided by their teachers, MPA students in grades 6 through 12 chose topics connected to an annual theme that they researched, analyzed, and produced projects to demonstrate their work. Lilith Vandyke represented MPA at the state level after being recognized by judges at the Chicago Metro History Day regional competition in March.\n\nZuri Cosey Gay, Sarah Fitch, Ethan Hayes, Marcus Hayes, Diego Hermosilla, Zuri Joplin, Alexis Kemp, Jordyn McCoy, Brazil McGruder, Varun Paluri, London Rome, and Savanah Weathers also participated.\n\nCongratulations to the St. Barnabas students who participated in the Student Council’s Women’s History Month Art Contest. At Christ the King, a special shout out to Mrs. Gentile’s 7th graders who participated in the Mother McAuley High School Science Bowl."
