        "text": "Hey Kids!!🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️\n\nBlog Day!!📝\n\nI hope you are all staying Safe & obeying your state/city laws.😷😷 Some of you may have taken my virtual tour of the Ephraim herb, flower & sculpture Gardens last week on Facebook.\n\nWell, 2 days later we had a full blown storm, including nickel size hail, strong winds, lightening, thunder & sheets of pouring rain coming down!!☔️💨\n\nMy perty hanging plants were flattened to the ground. But, they did survive, landing on the soft grass. 💨🌨 Only to be flattened again yesterday by torrential storms! This morning they looked like they survived again!!🌺🌸🌼🌻 Don’t know how much more the fragile little blooms can take!!🌈\n\nOn Friday, we continued on our Staycation Vacations in the town of Waverly, Iowa, about 20 minutes from Cedar Falls.🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️🚙\n\nThe downtown section was having their Summer “Ridiculous Days” Sidewalk Sale. But, the sale was a bit Ridiculous, as there were only a very few stores with tables displaying their goods. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I ended up buying zilch, which made Steve very Happy!!💁🏻‍♂️\n\nWe did discover a cute coffee/lunch/antique shop, tho. ☕️🍔🛷\n\nThe Butcher Block is run by a cute, young couple, Autumn & Simon.👩🏻👦🏻\n\nI noticed a bit of a Brit accent on Simon & asked him where he was from. My ear detected correctly, Simon was here in Iowa from England!💂🏻‍♂️💂🏾‍♂️💂🏿‍♂️\n\nOf course I had to ask how he came to live in Waverly, Iowa. 👦🏻 But, I pretty much knew the answer already… the pretty young lady, serving up an Americano coffee, named Autumn was the main reason why!👩🏻\n\nIf I remember right, they met when they were hiking in Colorado.🏔⛺️🧗🏻‍♀️ Both Autumn & Simon L❄️VE Colorado and hope to live there some day! I hope your dreams come true, guys!!🌈\n\nBeing a big fan of the TLC show 90 Day Fiancé (no judgement!!!) I had to ask if Simon came to the USA on a K1 Visa, basically a fiancé Visa, where the couple needs to get married in 90 days time or they must move back to their birth country. True Facts Folks!!👰🏻👨🏻‍⚖️\n\nWhat is a K1 VISA\n\nA K-1 visa is a visa issued to the fiancé or fiancée of a United States citizen to enter the United States. A K-1 visa requires a foreigner to marry his or her U.S. citizen petitioner within 90 days of entry, or depart the United States. Once the couple marries, the foreign citizen can adjust status to become a lawful permanent residentof the United States (Green Card holder). Although a K-1 visa is legally classified as a non-immigrant visa, it usually leads to important immigration benefits and is therefore often processed by the Immigrant Visa section of United States embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nAutumn, being a fan of the TV show, got a good laugh & assured me they were not 90 Fiancés!! We both shared our opinions of some of the crazy couples on the popular TLC TV show!! 😳🤪😩😱\n\nSimon & Autumn have been married since September 2019!!👰🏻👨🏻‍⚖️. Just in time before COVID 19 hit the world!!😷😷. Like most of us, they haven’t traveled very far past Iowa. And, certainly not back to England to visit Simon’s family. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\nThe Butcher Block is a cute shop, serving up delicious coffees, desserts, old fashioned root beer & has quite a variety on their lunch menu.🍺☕️🍰🥗🥙🍇\n\nSteve had his favorite coffee drink, an Americano & I quenched on an ice cold old fashioned root beer!☕️🍺 We made the decision to revisit another day & enjoy lunch & desserts.🧁🌯🥙🍡\n\nThe Butcher Block also sells antiques, homemade peanut butter, garden fresh garlic, local coffee beans from Sidecar Coffee Roasters, and a wide variety of fresh butchered meats & farm cheese.🧄🧀🥩🥓☕️🥜🚲🐗🛷\n\nThe Butcher Block\n\nFrom downtown Waverly we drove to the outskirts of town to revisit one of our favorite places… The Star Motel.⭐️\n\nThis little beauty, a vintage 1960s motel still has many of the original neon signs, turquoise paint, metal patio chairs, fall harvest colored bed spreads, ocean view wall murals, and an old fashioned pop machine outside the office door.\n\nRusty vintage cars were parked in the motel lot to complete the retro look.🏎\n\nI spoke to the owner/operator Doty several months ago. Unfortunately, she wasn’t working today, but friend Steve was kind enough to fill me in on some history of the motel.💁🏻‍♂️\n\nDoty has run the Star Motel for over 40 years. She was ill when I spoke to her last. I was glad to hear that she was still able run the office at the motel. ⭐️\n\nDisplayed in the original motel office are a collection of photos dating back to the days when the motel was first built… over 50 years ago. No restaurant next door back then, just completely surrounded by farmland.🏘\n\nThe ⭐️ Motel\n\nBTW… El Sol Mexican Restaurant next door to Star Motel has authentic, delicious, Mexican food. The staff is very friendly & the true feel of Mexico is decorated through out!🌮🥗 Bienvenidos Amigos!!!🙋🏽‍♀️💁🏾‍♂️\n\nYes we did stop in a cemetery in Waverly!⚰️⚰️ This place gave me real hibbie jibbies!!! 😱 I’m not sure what spirits had not found their way “home”, but I took a few pix & we got the heck out of there!!! I swear had goosebumps & my hair on my arms was standing up!!!👻💀☠️\n\nCheck out the picture of the underground crypt being restored! ☠️\n\nTales of the Crypt\n\nDriving around as much as we do, you’re bound to find Schmaltz wherever you go. 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️🚙\n\nOne of my most favorite things about Iowa, is the picturesque countryside you pass by, just a few miles outside of town.\n\nThis time of year, the corn, as they say “Is as high as an elephants eye!” It didn’t look like it could quite reach an elephant’s eye, yet! 🐘. But, it looks to be a bountiful harvest come a Fall!🌽🌽\n\nI L🐴VE the sight of horses in the green pastures, close to an old red barn… wildflowers springing their heads up close to the country road.🌻🌻🌻\n\nThis unusual little vehicle was parked on a side street in one of the small towns we passed thru. I didn’t see any company name, just that it was a Limited Edition. It looked like a version of the 3 wheel electric cars that are all over the internet right now. Got enough $$$$$$$… it can be yours!!!\n\nAnd, then, you almost always find little gems like this!! 😫 And, You usually don’t have to travel too far!😩\n\nGod help the person who is married to this delightful human specimen!

Enjoy!!🦸🏻🦸🏻‍♂️\n\nI like to devote October to Spooky, Scary, Bone Chilling, Halloween Type Stuff!!👻🤡☠️🎃🦹🏻‍♀️🧛🏽‍♂️🧟‍♂️🦸🏻👽🙀 Are you getting my drift💨 or maybe a cold, chilly breeze?!👻\n\nIf you’ve known us long enough, you know one of our “hobbies” if you will, is visiting cemeteries, the older & spookier, the better!!⚰️⚱️🏺🪓🗝💉🔪\n\nBut, a Big But, not to be confused with this kind of Big Butt( ) We Will Not!!! I repeat… Will Not Be Buried In A Cemetery!!!⚰️⚰️. Nope!!! No way!!!🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂️ You’ll find us scattered across some Glistening Sand Beach, Quaint Sunflowery Countryside, or Fabulous Forest of Wildflowers! 🌻🌼🌸🌺 But, Not 6 feet under!!🚫🚫\n\nAlrighty then, now that that’s clear, let’s move on. Last January, before the world was turned upside down, we took a road trip down the Breathtaking California Coastline.🚙🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️\n\nOne of our stops to check off our Traveler’s Bucket List, was to pay a visit to the resting spot of some of Hollywood’s brightest stars.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\nThe Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park & Mortuary in Los Angeles, California is a stop 🛑 you may just pass right by. As there are no set markings, so to speak. A small driveway that sits off a fairly traveled street, is your only clue that there is something behind the towering city building.🏙\n\nThe lush and tranquil cemetery is located on 2.5 acres in Los Angeles. The grounds provide a quiet, picturesque place for people to remember their loved ones. In the mornings, an unmistakable tranquility makes it easy to get lost in nature’s beauty with dew dripping from the leaves underneath the California skies. The grounds are specifically designed to achieve this peaceful, park-like retreat within the city limits.\n\nAt the entrance to the grounds, there are 2 large wrought-iron gates. The space is so unassuming and enjoyable that many people come just to enjoy the outdoors and relax in the peaceful surroundings.\n\nI really expected many more people in the cemetery. But, actually there were maybe a dozen people, most likely devoted admirers visiting beloved celebrities in their eternal sleep.😴🌸😴🌺\n\nWe strolled the beautifully groomed garden paths, past the resting spots of some of the most famous names in Hollywood. Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Donna Reed, Jack Lemmon, Dean Martin, Roy Orbison, Don Knotts, Eddie Albert, Eva Gabor, Tim Conway, Hugh Hefner, Truman Capote, Merv Griffin, Farrah Fawcett, Rodney Dangerfield, just to name a few.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 The marble mausoleum was our first stop.\n\nClick on photos to enlarge⬇️\n\nHollywood Stars⭐️ ⭐️\n\nMarilyn Monroe grew up in foster care & an orphanage most of her life, but went on to be an American actress, model, and singer. Famous for playing comedic “blonde bombshell” characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era’s changing attitudes towards sexuality. Born June 1, 1926, Died August 4, 1962.\n\nHugh Hefner was an American magazine publisher. He was the founder and editor-in-chief of Playboy magazine, a publication with revealing photographs and articles that provoked charges of obscenity. Born April 9, 1926 Died September 27, 2017.\n\nTruman Capote was an American novelist, short story writer, screenwriter, playwright, and actor. Several of his short stories, novels, and plays have been praised as literary classics, including the novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s and the true crime novel In Cold Blood, which he labeled a “nonfiction novel” Born September 30, 1924 Died August 25, 1984.\n\nThomas Daniel “Tim” Conway was an American actor, comedian, writer, and director. From 1966 to 2012 he appeared in more than 100 TV shows, TV series and films. Born December 15, 1933, May 14, 2019.\n\nJacqueline Collins was an English romance novelist. She moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s and spent most of her career there. She wrote 32 novels, all of which appeared on The New York Times bestsellers list. Her books have sold more than 500 million copies and have been translated into 40 languages. Born October 4, 1937 September 19, 2015.\n\nAs we finished our visit thru this quiet resting place for so many big names in the Hollywood world, I was left with a feeling of sorrow.😓\n\nSchool was letting out & a few high school students cut thru the cemetery, as a short cut to their homes. Most likely not even recognizing the names of the legends they were passing by… and not caring.😪\n\nThese chambers seemed so little & ordinary compared to the larger than life, extraordinary souls that lay inside of them. The stark site of empty flower vases and scrubbed off lipstick kisses, left me with a sad, empty feeling. I really felt like crying. 😥😓\n\nI’ve thought about our visit to this quiet cemetery many times over the months. I wonder, how often do their family or friends pay a visit? Does anyone put a fresh flower in the bud vase next to their famous name💐 or is a dried up flower resting on the marble floor?🌺 Do their fans pray for their souls?🙏🏼 Is Tim Conway’s name on his brass plate yet?😓\n\nMy next Blog will be Part 2 of the Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park & Mortuary.⚰️⚱️\n\nWe’ll visit more Hollywood Stars & some lesser known souls.👨🏻‍🦳🧓🏻🧔🏿👵🏾👩🏼‍🦰🧒🏻👨🏻👳🏿🧕🏽\n\nAll photos are the property of this Blogger.

Where were you that fateful day?😓\n\nPLEASE read all the way to the end of this Blog… if you don’t mind.🙋🏻‍♀️\n\nIt’s been raining cats & dogs here in Cedar Falls for 4 days non stop!🦮☔️🐈\n\nI’ve thought about building an ark, but that’ll take way too long, I’d have to go cut lumber, purchase food, gather up animals 2×2, it would cost way too much $$$$$, and a 100 other excuses why that’s not a very good idea!🚢\n\nSo what to do? What to do? What to do on a rainy, gloomy day in Iowa?!🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nSteve won’t play Scrabble with me anymore because he loses all the time.😤\n\nI’m tired of binging Netflix, baking banana bread & cleaning out closets & drawers of old junk & outdated clothing.😩 So what to do?!\n\nI know… I’ve got an idea…🧐How about we go see the famous artist Grant Wood exhibit at the local Art Museum?!🎨\n\nIt’s very rare you get to see such a large collection of Grant Wood art, all in one museum.🎨\n\nWe’re very fortunate to have Wood’s pieces so close to us & not have to travel to a much larger art museum in one of the big cities, such as Chicago, where his painting American Gothic is hung.🏙\n\nThe day we visited the museum we were literally the only ones there, except for the employees. It felt like we were experiencing a private showing.🙋🏻‍♀️👨🏼‍🎨🙋🏻‍♂️\n\nAnd, speaking of rare… yet another Blog from Schmaltzy Places & People We’ve Met Along the Way?!😱 How many is that in one month?!🖐🏽 Well, maybe not five! But, WOW!!! You guys are so darn lucky!!!🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nI apologize ahead of time… I don’t have all the titles of the art work, but I hope you enjoy your little tour thru the Waterloo Art Center- The Grant Wood Collection.👨🏼‍🎨\n\nThese photos do not even come close to showing the attention to detail in each of Wood’s work!👨🏼‍🎨. It’s truly exemplary!\n\nSteve made the comment, “I’d never get tired of looking at these, if they were in my home.”\n\nI have to say, looking at the simple way of living on an Iowa farm that’s depicted in these paintings makes you forget… even for a few moments the craziness of the complicated world we are living in these days.🧑🏼‍🌾👨🏻‍🌾\n\nEnjoy!👨🏼‍🎨\n\nGrant Wood Biography\n\nGrant Wood (1891-1942) was an American painter who is best known for the iconic work ‘American Gothic.’\n\nWho Was Grant Wood?\n\nGrant Wood was an American painter who is best known for his work depicting the Midwest. In 1930, he exhibited his most famous painting, American Gothic. Among the most iconic and recognizable images in American art, it helped propel Wood to fame and launch the Regionalist movement, of which Wood became the de facto spokesperson.\n\nEarly Life\n\nGrant Wood was born on his parents’ farm outside of Anamosa, Iowa, on February 13, 1891. These idyllic settings would leave a lasting impression on Wood and profoundly influence his later thinking and work, though he would spend much of his life after the age of 10 in the relatively more urban setting of Cedar Rapids, where his mother moved Wood and his younger sister Nan after their father died.\n\nWood developed his interest in art while still in grammar school and showed promise. He continued to nurture his talents in high school where he designed sets for plays and illustrated student publications. After graduation in 1910, Wood attended the Minneapolis School of Design and Handicraft. Over the next few years, Wood further expanded his creative repertoire by learning to work with metal and jewelry as well as build furniture. When he moved to Chicago in 1913, he used these skills to make a living.\n\nWorking Artist\n\nIn Chicago, Wood spent his days at his jewelry and metalworking shop and his evenings developing his talents through correspondence courses and classes at the Art Institute. However, when his mother fell ill in 1916, Wood left Chicago to return to Cedar Rapids, where he took a job as a grammar school teacher to support his mother and sister. However, his familial obligations did not stop Wood from continuing to make progress as an artist. As such, several years later a local department store held an exhibition that included several of his paintings and led to further commissions.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Wood was also able to find a way to travel to Europe, visiting the museums of France and Italy, studying at the Académie Julian and exhibiting his work in Paris. He returned from these trips profoundly inspired by the Impressionists, whose pastoral subject matter spoke to his own sensibilities.\n\n‘American Gothic’\n\nHowever, it would be on a 1928 trip to Munich, Germany—where he was overseeing the production of a stained glass window he had designed for the Veterans Memorial Building in Cedar Rapids—that Wood had the revelation that ultimately changed the direction of his art and propelled him to fame. After seeing the works of 15th- and 16th-century German and Flemish masters, whose realism and attention to detail bowled him over, Wood returned to the United States determined to integrate their approach into his own work.\n\nAbandoning his earlier Impressionistic leanings, Wood began to formulate a more realistic style through which to convey the rural subject matter he had held dear since his youth. One of his first paintings from this period is also his most famous: American Gothic. Showing a farmer (who was modeled after Wood’s dentist) and a woman who is either his wife or daughter (modeled after Wood’s sister) standing stoically in front of a white farmhouse, American Gothicwas exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1930 and won immediate acclaim. It has since become one of the most recognizable images in the history of American art. At times interpreted as parody, according to Wood the work is in fact intended as an affirmation of its distinctly Midwestern subject matter and implied values, standing apart from those of large American cities and, even more so, European culture.\n\n‘Women With Plants’ and ‘Revolt Against the City’\n\nWith his paintings of small-town life, Midwestern landscapes and historical scenes, Wood became the de facto spokesperson for the American Regionalist movement. His paintings were much in demand. Besides American Gothic, other representative works include Woman With Plants (1929), The Appraisal (1931) and Daughters of Revolution (1932).\n\nIn 1932, Wood used his newly won fame to co-found the Stone City Colony and Art School, where he could spread the message of Regionalism to aspiring artists. Two years later, however, he accepted a position with the art department at the University of Iowa, where he believed he could have an even greater impact. That same year, Wood was also named director of the Public Works of Art Project in Iowa and was featured in a Time magazine cover story about Regionalism. In 1935, he published the essay “Revolt Against the City,” in which he laid out the tenets of the movement.\n\nDifficult Times and Death\n\nDespite these successes, Wood was about to enter the most trying period in his life. In 1935, he rather suddenly married a woman named Sara Maxon, with whom he would maintain a difficult relationship for the next few years in part because of his latent homosexuality. Wood and Maxon ultimately divorced in 1939, at a time when he was also in trouble with the IRS for tax evasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Wood’s professional world was coming apart as well. With the rise of abstract movements in American art, Wood’s Regionalism was falling out of favor and put him at odds with many of the faculty at the university. Frustrated, in 1940, Wood took a leave of absence.\n\nThroughout this trying time, however, Wood had continued to work. Paintings such as Death on Ridge Road (1935), Parson Weems’ Fable (1939) and Iowa Cornfield (1941) all show his faithful adherence to the American art movement he was primarily responsible for founding. He died of cancer on February 12, 1942, at age 50, and was buried on his family’s plot in Anamosa.\n\n“All the really good ideas I ever had came to me while I was milking a cow.” — Grant Wood\n\nThank You to GOOGLE for info, photo & quote found on this Blog.💻\n\nAll photos are the property of this blogger.

I hope you are all staying safe this holiday weekend… Summer’s Last Hurrah!!😷🌈😷\n\nFriday started out to look like a Great Holiday Weekend… and then on Saturday… it hit!!🤒. Fever, sore throat, achy, chills… and more!🤢 But, I’ll save you all the gross details.🤮\n\nA trip to the Urgent Care Clinic confirmed it…strep throat!😷 Ugh!!!😩 Hopefully the meds will kick in quickly!💊\n\nSo, here I am, sipping chicken noodle soup & hot tea on this gorgeous Iowa day.🍲☕️ And, writhing this Blog.📝\n\nBut, here we go again on another fun filled Summer Staycation with Janice & Steve!!💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♂️🚙\n\nFriday afternoon we headed towards Fayette, Iowa about 50 minutes from our home in Cedar Falls.🏘 On the way we passed the quaint St. Matthews’s Church, beautifully sitting close to a nearby cornfield…ready for Fall’s harvest.🌽🌽🌽\n\nBetween the small white church & the church graveyard, reaching towards the fluffy clouds, sits the artistic Hands That Hope sculpture. It was carved by master woodcarver, Jack Becker.\n\nIf you are in the area of Dyersville, Iowa be sure to visit the variety of amazing hand-carved woodworks of the famous Northeast Iowa carver, Jack Becker, in one of Iowa’s most unique carving museums located on his family’s organic hog farm.🐷\n\nWe continued on to the rugged beauty of the Volga River. The picturesque setting is perfect for campers.🏕 There are also equestrian campsites available for horse lovers.🐎Dogs are welcome, too.🦮\n\nThe Volga River Recreation Area has become a very popular center for a number of trail activities. Hiking, cross-country skiing, mountain biking, and equestrian trails wind through the area. Trails include Frog Hollow Trail, Lake View Trail, Ridge Trail, Albany Trail and the Lima Trail. The total trail system is 25 miles in length.\n\nSince as far back as I can remember, I’ve always Loved horses, so of course, I had to jump out of the car and go pet as many horses as I was allowed to pet!! And, two mules!🐴🐴🐎🐎🐎 And, 3 dogs!!!🐶🐶🐶\n\nWe met two of the nicest couples, their horses, dogs & daughter. Thank Goodness Steve took good notes, because I was too busy petting God’s Beautiful Creatures to remember everything!🐴🐴🐴🐴🐶🐶\n\nThe 1st couple we met were Rob and Amy Heflin of Harlan, IA. They are making a loop through northeast Iowa and Minnesota. Rob is a county road maintenance operator and Amy is a nurse. Amy & I discussed the Summer of COVID 19 in Iowa. All the while keeping our 6 feet of social distancing. 😷😷\n\nAmy was baking a cake at their campsite in a Dutch Oven. Mmmmmm…It smelled delicious!🏕\n\nThese are Rob & Amy’s horses & dog in the photos above. ⬆️ I’m sorry I only remember Lucy’s name.🐶🐴🐴\n\nThe 2nd couple were Jim and Kathy Schiefelbein of Fairbank, IA. Jim has an agrictultural hauling business and the couple has a farm. 👩🏻‍🌾👨🏻‍🌾\n\nKathy grew up on the south side of Chicago (What?! I’m from the Southside of Chicago!!) Kathy went to Maria High School, one of the all girl high schools in Chicago. I also attended an all girl high school, Mother McAuley. We reminisced about in Chicago neighborhoods, you were either a “Catholic” or a “Public.” The Catholics went to the Catholic school & of course the Publics went to the Public school. And, Never the twain shall meet!! Unless you sneaked across the alley & went to the Public girl’s house.🤫\n\nKathy’s family moved to Iowa, where her Father took a job. She notes that she hated the first seven years living in the new town.\n\nJim and Kathy met at a country dance and hit it off quickly when they discovered they danced marvelously together. Each had come with someone else but lost interest in the others after that first fateful meeting. (So much for “Dance with the one who brought you.”) 💃🏻🕺🏻\n\nJim proposed to Kathy under the tree next to the campsite where we met them. They’ve been married 30+ years and are traveling with their daughter and two lovable Alaskan malamutes.👩🏻👨🏻🧒🏻🐶🐶🐴🐴🐴\n\nPictured is the couple with their daughter under the tree where they were engaged.👨🏻‍⚖️👰🏻\n\nI’m hugging up to Kathy & Jim’s gorgeous Alaskan Malamutes, Crosby & Delaney.🐶🐶\n\nBTW… I broke the Almighty Catholic Rule!!! Bless Me Father for I Have Sinned…I married a “Public!!!” 👎🏼🙀😱🤭😳🤯\n\nOur final destination for the day was Heaven Boutique Winery, just a few minutes away. But, first we made a quick stop to catch the stunning sunset over Frog Hollow Lake.🐸\n\nIs that reflection on the lake not Gorgeous!!?? Only a couple fishermen were still out in their boats, catching dinner for the night.🎣🎣\n\nThere was a bit of Fall in the air as we arrived at the🍁🍂 Heaven Boutique Winery. The Winery is just a short drive down a country road and very close to Frog Hollow Lake & the Volga Recreation Area.🏕🏕\n\nThe Bruce Bearinger Band was playing under the moon and the stars,✨🌗 as the guests relaxed & enjoyed the smooth sounds.🎸🎼\n\nA Moroccan food truck was parked close by, serving chicken & pork Gyros, walking tacos, nachos & cheese & lots of other goodies!🌮🥙🍗🌯\n\nA cute vintage trailer was parked close by & serving up some of the Winery’s best Summer beers & wines.🍻🥂The view of the vineyard surroundings were lovely & all the while safe distancing was being practiced.😷😷\n\nWe set up our folding chairs, donned a jacket, enjoyed some yummy food & sat back to listen to some great 60s & 70s tunes the band was playing.🎤🎼🎸And, forget about the world’s problems… even if it was just for awhile.✌🏼✌🏽✌🏿\n\nThe Bruce Bearinger Band brings back memories of “when music was music!!” The American Bandstand “I like the tune & it was easy to dance to” kinda music! Try to catch them in your town whenever you can.💃🏻🕺🏻🎸🎼\n\nHeaven Boutique Winery has concerts throughout the Summer. The last one of the Summer is September 11th.\n\nHEAVEN BOUTIQUE WINERY\n\nIs this Heaven? It sure is – and you’re going to love it! Treat yourself to native Iowa wines, art and gifts by Iowa artists, and unique, one-of-a-kind lodging. With complimentary wine tasting every day, Heaven is a beautiful place to discover your new favorite Iowa wine or craft beer, pick up the perfect gift, and unwind with friends while overlooking our lovely vineyard in the heart of the gorgeous Driftless countryside.\n\nVOLGA RIVER VINEYARD\n\nOur vineyard is located in Heaven, the farm where Lisa’s mother, Connie Rohde Halvorson, grew up. Just north of Fayette off highway 150, we are at the east entrance to the Volga River State Recreation Area. The first vines were planted in 1999 by Lisa’s parents, Roger & Connie Halvorson. The three acre vineyard is now lovingly tended by our Chief Grape Stomper and Vintner, Carlton.\n\nIOWA WINES\n\nWe are a boutique winery and as such will produce select vintages in limited quantities throughout the year, beginning late summer 2020. Heaven now features several Iowa craft beers as well as 100+ different native wines, handpicked from 30+ wineries all over Iowa, including many not previously available in this region. Available by the bottle or by the glass, our selection of Iowa wine will change often so stop in to see what’s new and to let us know what you’d like to see in Heaven!\n\nWell I hope you enjoyed our late Summer trip thru a bit of Iowa’s Bluffs & Driftless area. Someday I’ll do a whole Blog on the Driftless Area in Iowa, that nobody, including the park rangers seem to know about!🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nLook for some Great stories from my Guest Blogger in the very near future!🙋🏻‍♂️\n\nThank You to Google for info found on this Blog.\n\n“I’m pretty much a good Catholic girl at heart and I believe in family.

I think I even caught a little scent of Fall in the air.🍂🍁 My most favorite of all the seasons.⛄️🌸⛵️🎃\n\nWe took a little road trip to Nashua, Iowa about 45 minutes away.🚙🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️ Nashua is probably most famous for The Little Brown Church in the Vale. 🕍 Yes, you may have heard the old time religion song by the same name.\n\nLittle Brown Church in the Vale🎼\n\n🎼There’s a church in the valley by the wildwood\n\nNo lovelier spot in the dale\n\nNo place is so dear to my childhood🎼\n\n🎼As the little brown church in the vale🎼\n\nOur 1st stop was at a cute, little retro diner called Dairy Treat.🍦 Actually, it was the only restaurant in town that was open. I ordered the BBQ grilled chicken sandwich & Steve had the steak sandwich.🍗🥩 An ice cold Coke helped quench my thirst.🥤 It was all very delicious!!\n\nWe brought our meals down to a picnic table in the shade, close to the shore at Cedar Lake in Nashua. The Lake may just be the best kept secret around the area. The beach, although small, looked very clean. Children splashed with their water toys & built sandcastles on the beach, while teens dove off the raft, a little further out in the Lake.🏄🏻‍♂️🏊🏻‍♀️🏖🔫\n\nThere were plenty of sun lovers enjoying the last days of Summer in their sailboats, motor boats, fishing boats, jet skis & kayaks.🛶⛵️🚤 🚣🏼‍♂️\n\nCedar Lake is actually a decent size, with several inlets along the way & a variety of beautiful pines, oak, cedar, & birch trees lining the banks of the Lake.🌲🌳🌾 There are plenty of picnic tables & benches for lunching, reading, fishing, & relaxing.🌭🍔🎣🧘🏽‍♂️\n\nAcross from the beach was a colorful splash pad with plenty of fun sprinklers, just waiting to spray an unexpected visitor.⛲️🎠⛵️🗼A combination of old school playground equipment blended nicely with the fancy, new fandangled equipment of the modern world!🎡🎠🗼\n\nDo you ever wonder how we all survived those sharp chains & ⛓⚙️ rusty metal edges on the swing sets, merry go rounds & teeter totters? And, how about the blazing hot metal slides, burning our bottoms!Ouch!!!🔥 But, we all seemed to come out just fine! Didn’t we?!😍🥰😘\n\nNext to the Lake the scent of campfires wafted thru the air from the nearby campground.🏕🏕🏕 Not a big fan of camping, myself… but it did look like everyone was enjoying themselves. But, I do absolutely L🥰VE the aroma of a campfire!🏕\n\nA short skip & a jump away from Cedar Lake is the famous Little Brown Church in the Vale, mentioned above. Often sung in old time tent revivals in bygone years.🕍 A very peaceful place to kneel & pray & reflect on life & the latest news in the world.🙏🏼🙏🏼 We happened to be the only ones at the church at the time… ahhh Peace!✌🏼✌🏽✌🏿\n\nSteve was the photographer in this little outing & I think he captured some very lovely photos of the Little Brown Church & surrounding Vale.📸\n\nHistory of The Little Brown Church\n\nThe first settlers came to the Bradford area in 1848 and with an abundant water supply and virgin timber, the town grew. By 1855 the first members of the Puritan-Congregational Church had begun holding meetings. By 1856, Bradford had 500 residents and was the first town in this part of Iowa.\n\nA young music teacher named William Pitts was traveling by stagecoach from Wisconsin to Iowa to visit his future wife. While waiting for the stagecoach horses to be changed, he walked down Cedar Street and saw the empty lot where the church now stands. Being a romantic young man, the thought came to him of what a charming setting the spot would make for a church. Returning home, he wrote the poem “Church in the Wildwood,” and later set it to music. He put it away in a drawer and forgot it.\n\nMeanwhile, church members grew tired of meeting in places such as the lawyer’s office, abandoned stores and parishioners’ homes. They began making plans to build a church. A family in the parish gave them the property. When Rev. Nutting arrived, talk of building became serious. Limestone was quarried and by 1860 the foundation was laid. The Civil War slowed the work, but when one family gave trees and another donated the sawing of the lumber, the work never really ceased. By 1862 the building was enclosed and not a penny had been spent. When it came time to paint the building, the cheapest paint to be found was Ohio Mineral Paint, which would protect the wood but which was unhappily brown. With help from friends in the east, the building was finished, complete with bell, in 1864.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Pitts had married and was living in Wisconsin. In 1862 the couple moved to Fredericksburg to be near her elderly parents and Mr. Pitts was hired to teach singing class at the Bradford Academy. Imagine his surprise when he saw a little brown church nestled in the very trees where he had stood some years before. He went home and found the song and taught it to his class who sang it at the dedication service of the church. Pitts had written a song for a church that wasn’t there. The congregation had painted their little church brown without ever hearing of the song.\n\nHistory was hard on the Little Brown Church. The railroad by-passed the town and a flour mill moved to New Hampton to be on a bigger river. The railroad and other industry moved to Nashua. The town, once the county seat, slowly disappeared. In 1888, the church building was closed, although the congregation continued to hold Sunday School every week at the school. Occasional services were held at the building. In the early 1900’s a Society for the Preservation of The Little Brown Church was started and by 1914, services were again held, as they are now.\n\nHistory took another turn when the Weatherwax Quartet traveled throughout Canada and the United States between 1910 and 1921. Their theme song was “The Church in the Wildwood” and they talked about the little church. After World War I, highways were improved and cars brought many visitors. When a School superintendent and a merchants’ daughter were married at the church, a new tradition was started, the ringing of the Church bell. It was a means to proclaim the wedding and pronounce blessings on the new couple.\n\nIn August of 2014, the 74,000 wedding was held at the historic church site. It remains, as it was founded, a Congregational Church. The song continues to be sung, as the response to the Benediction, in a little church that is painted brown and sits in the wildwood.\n\nOnce a year, The Little Brown Church hosts an anniversary of all couples who have gotten married there. 👰🏻👨🏻‍⚖️ Last official count that I could find was in 2014 at 74,000. I’m sure it must be close to 80,000 by now. Some day we’d like to go & see the festivities! Another Schmaltzy trip waiting to happen!!🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️\n\nI hope you enjoyed your visit to The Little Brown Church.🕍\n\n“Come to the church by the wildwood\n\nOh, come to the church in the vale\n\nNo spot is so dear to my childhood\n\nAs the little brown church in the vale” William Pitts\n\nThank You to Google for info & some photos found on this Blog.\n\nMost photos are the property of this Blogger.

Our first stop was Starboard Market Deli, a Clear Lake favorite.🍹🥙🥐\n\nI ordered delicious honey mustard chicken salad on a croissant and Steve had a turkey club sandwich.🥪🥐\n\nBeing that the Market had no tables set up because of Covid 19, we found a quiet, shady picnic table by the Lake, right across from The Lady of the Lake.⛴\n\nHistory of Starboard Market Deli\n\nRoger Poole worked for the railroad and his job took him to many places around America. With his wife, Sue, and their three children, the family moved to Pennsylvania, Colorado, Nebraska, Minnesota and Wisconsin, depending on Roger’s job.\n\nThe Pooles landed in the Des Moines area in the 1980’s. Sue was a high school English teacher, she was also a great cook and encouraged her daughters to learn their way around a kitchen.\n\nAfter Roger retired in 1999, the Poole family bought a home & moved to Clear Lake. Sue decided to try out some of her chef skills & opened a little deli that featured sandwiches, soups, salads and baked goods. She gave the place a nautical theme and called it the Starboard Market.\n\nSue and the girls ran the Market, while Roger helped bus tables.\n\nSadly, Roger & Sue have passed away, but their girls, Jennifer and Katie carry on their mother’s legacy and continue to run the little deli still to this day.\n\nThe temps were in the high 90s, so we skipped shopping & took a walk down to the beach. The beach was pretty empty, just a Mom playing with her youngsters in the water, a few little ones splashing on the nearby splash pad & a cute teenage couple, sunning themselves.👧🏼👶🏻👦🏻🧒🏻👩🏼‍🦰👱🏼‍♂️ I forgot my bathing suit, so I rolled up my capris & waded in the cool, refreshing Lake.🧜🏻‍♀️ Ahhhhh!!!!\n\nWe took a drive along the lakefront & took in the beautiful homes, overlooking the Lake.🛶⛵️🚤⛴🚢\n\nSome other Schmaltzy places to take in at Clear Lake are the food trucks, Tiki Bar, Pyramid House, Ice Cream Cone House & Surf Ballroom. 🚚🍦🛕🍹🎤\n\nHistory of the Surf Ballroom\n\nTo many, the Surf Ballroom is an American Cultual icon as well as an important historical landmark. The original Surf Ballroom was located across the street from its current location on the shores of Clear Lake. It officially opened for business on April 17, 1934 with a $1.00 dance on a 90×120 foot hardwood dance floor. The venue also featured a roof garden for dancing outdoors, five lakeside windows and a boardwalk leading to nearby docks. The Surf was one of three such ventures for its developer, Carl J. Fox. It’s been said that Carl Fox borrowed against his life insurance to start the endeavor. He sold the three ballrooms in December of 1946.\n\nTragedy struck the Surf in the early morning hours of April 20, 1947 when fire destroyed the building. Plans for its replacement were quickly underway and a new Surf Ballroom was rebuilt across the street from the original location in what was the original venue’s parking lot. The current Surf Ballroom reopened on July 1, 1948.\n\nThe Surf got its name (and motif) from the desire of the original owners to create a ballroom that resembled an ocean beach club. The murals on the back walls were hand-painted to depict pounding surf, swaying palm trees, sailboats and lighthouses. The furnishings were bamboo and rattan and the ambience that of a south sea island. The stage is surrounded by palm trees and the clouds projected overhead make it seem as if you were dancing outside under the stars.\n\nThe ballroom was scheduled to be open Wednesday through Sunday each week, with “Old style music and dancing” featured on Friday nights. The remaining nights would be dedicated to “Modern music and dancing.” In the 1930’s and 1940’s, in order for a big band to make its reputation nationally, it had to play the Surf. The likes of Count Basie, Duke Ellington and The Dorsey’s all made regular stops at the Surf. Back then, ballrooms were host to the primary form of entertainment — dancing.\n\nThe 1950’s saw the dawning of rock and roll, and the manager was quick to book the hottest names in the business. Artists like The Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, Ricky Nelson, Little Richard, Jan and Dean and Conway Twitty all took the stage here. The Surf Ballroom was one of the first ballrooms in the state to feature rock ‘n roll, and the big name rock acts featured here made it a “must-play” venue on the performance circuit. This was the case on February 2, 1959, the date of the famed Winter Dance Party featuring Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, The Big Bopper, and Dion. It was this fateful show that made the most lasting mark on the Surf Ballroom.\n\nOn a Wintery night, their plane lost control & fatefully crashed in a nearby corn field. Sadly everyone in the plane were instantly killed. It was “The Night the Music Died.”\n\nIn the early 1970’s through today, the Surf has brought in the likes of Santana, REO Speedwagon, Kansas, Alice Cooper, Chicago, The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, BB King, ZZ Top, Martina McBride, Lynryd Skynyrd and countless others.\n\nOn the way home from the Lake we made a short stop at the quaint little Guardian Angel Chapel, nestled in the woods & just a few minutes from Clear Lake.⛪️\n\nHistory of The Guardian Angel Chapel\n\nJack Kennedy says he built the tiny Guardian Angel Roadside Chapel as a witness to Christ. Ironically, the tragic burning and subsequent rebuilding of the tiny chapel has served as a much greater witness than Jack ever imagined.\n\nKennedy, along with his family, erected the church in 1991 just off Interstate 35 at Clear Lake exit 193. The large stained glass cross at the altar of the church was designed to serve as a beacon to Interstate travelers. Literally thousands of travelers have made at least a brief stop in Clear Lake to see the church named in memory of Jack’s aunt, who believed her life was once saved by a guardian angel.\n\nThe original church featured pieces of the altar salvaged from the Lutheran Church rebuilt in 1965, as well as stained glass windows and pews from a former church here. However, in 1992, vandals burned the structure. Everything in the building, with the exception of a baptismal bowl, was destroyed.\n\nThanks to financial contributions by more than 70 persons and donations of labor by more than 30, the chapel was re-dedicated Palm Sunday, 1993. Like the first chapel, this one features windows salvaged from the former Zion Lutheran Church. The pews were left-over from the building of the first chapel. The oak altar in the first chapel was replicated by Wunderlich Woodworking, of Mason City. The new rail was actually the old choir rail from Zion Lutheran Church, modified to serve as an altar rail at the chapel. Other volunteers built a new oak baptismal fountain. Stained glass artist John Larsen recreated the large cross which faces the Interstate highway from pieces of glass left over from the first chapel, in addition to putting new lead in the old stained glass windows.\n\nWell, I hope you enjoyed yet another of our Schmaltzy Staycations!!🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️\n\n“Never travel faster than your guardian angel can fly.” Mother Teresa\n\nThank You to Google for info & some photos found on this Blog.\n\nMost of the photos on this Blog are the property of this Blogger.

Perhaps my personal stories from this week will shed some light. But first, an explanation of terms… To keep this on the lighter side, references to COVID will hereafter be referred to as “health issues”. Social justice issues will be abbreviated as “social issues”, and religious aspects will be referred to as “spiritual”.\n\nEpisode 1 – Grandma Takes to the Streets\n\nBiking past a busy intersection in Cedar Rapids, a town about an hour from home, I caught a glimpse of someone erecting a sign. It wasn’t the hand-made variety, but rather a slick, vinyl banner with large black letters, printed in computer font on a white background.\n\nIt said, “Lower Covid 19 Rates Before Opening Schools.” Like me, you could have assumed this was the work of a teachers’ union or activist organization. The woman stationed next to the sign in a lawn chair could be fulfilling her two-hour rotational assignment. If you had thought this, you were wrong.\n\nCircling back to the intersection, I asked Ms. Protester about her cause. Over the next twenty minutes, I learned that this grandmother, Jan Kvach, was running a one-woman show. Concerned about her grandkids’ health, this retired Social Studies teacher is campaigning for medical benchmarks to determine when schools are safe to re-open. She hearkens back to her own experiences as a teacher, quoting medical facts, and disputing state policies.\n\nArmed with a grandma’s love and rich experience in education, Jan is taking on the world. I wish her well.\n\nEpisode 2 – Ninety-Nine Years and Counting\n\nIf you’ve never attended the Cedar Falls Bible Conference, you’ve missed out on a near century-old tradition. During this past week’s 99th occurrence, speakers and musical groups provided seven days of spiritual encouragement. If you grew up attending church camps, the scenes around the conferencegrounds, aka, Riverview Conference Center, would lookfamiliar. A mixture of quaint cabins, historic meeting centers, remote rest rooms, RV park and playground facilities are spreadout over 27 acres. The grounds are ringed by pines and oak trees stationed atop a bluff overlooking the Cedar River.\n\nOnce a year, the spiritual faithful arrive at the conference grounds from throughout the upper Midwest. Speakers and musicians include both international and local talent. In recent years, the conference has shifted programming and music to attract younger families. High-tech audio/video, modernized web site, and online streaming have enhanced the learning experience. Meeting venues have added air-conditioning. Localshops and food trucks cater a fine selection of coffee, meals and desserts.\n\nWhile these creature comforts bear little resemblance to the basics offered a century ago, the spiritual emphasis remains the same. Messages and protocols are tweaked to accommodate issues of the day. This year, the conference invited a black university administrator to speak on social issues. Health precautions included online viewing options and outdoors seating. Future plans include a year-round schedule of training and concert events. Mark your calendars now to attend the 100thanniversary of the Bible Conference next July.\n\nEpisode 3 – An Unlikely Place for a Sign\n\nJanice and I have a quirky tradition of cruising through the tranquil grounds of the Riverview Conference Center on Sunday afternoons. Two weeks ago, we spotted a sign with a well-known slogan in someone’s yard. This location, across from the main event center, seemed an unlikely place for a sign bearing a hotly-debated slogan. For some, this phrase represents an organization with a lightning-rod agenda while others use it as acall to action on behalf of a specific disadvantaged group.\n\nDuring a session on social justice in this week’s Bible Conference, the moderator recounted a recent incident with this sign. Just a few days earlier, someone painted over the word“Black” with white paint. After the owners removed the paint, they discovered the sign defaced once again, this time cut intopieces and discarded in the trash. The owners later replaced the sign with a new one.\n\nAfter the session, I tracked down “Pauli” in her yard where the sign is posted. Surrounded by grandchildren and Siberian,“Primus” in a beautiful garden, Pauli told me the rest of the story. Her husband, Mark, works in the Expo Alternative high school in nearby Waterloo. Referring to the sign’s slogan, she said, “We’re not into gender issues, but my husband sees racial injustice first-hand working exclusively with black students in his job.” This determined couple has persisted, and the sign still stands. We expect to see it next time we cruise through the camp.\n\nDuring our conversation, I commented to Pauli about her beautiful yard. She said the cottage has provided a respite from current health issues.\n\nEpisode 4 – Making a Difference (Spiritual, Social, Health)\n\nFollowing a Saturday AM Bible Conference session, a group ofladies in the food tent served barbequed chicken, ribs, and beans with sides of potato salad and Cheetos. All were wearing black t-shirts sporting a neatly scripted logo for “Impact Church”. When I asked about the church, someone pointed me to “Amber”.\n\nOver the next few minutes, Dr. Amber Robinson explained how her husband, Marshaundus (“Shaun”) founded the church on Waterloo’s east side about a year ago. Married four years with two young children, Shawn and Amber have broadened the church’s spiritual emphasis to include outreach on social and health issues. This spring, the church raised funds to provide free gas to over one hundred customers at a local gas station. They’ve also provided boxed meals to the public and free lunches to school-aged children. The latest outreach project is a voter registration drive for the predominantly black and Latino community.\n\nDr. Amber has worked in the education field as a consultant on justice and bias issues. She’s adjusted her once-firebrand approach to enhance productive conversation with a variety of audiences. Amber was once invited to address a group of Alabama police officers on implicit bias; the session went well. As we finished our conversation, she casually mentioned her “side gig” as principal of Royal Legacy Christian Academy. This bi-lingual K-8 school provides language immersion experiences for all ages including Spanish-only K-2 instruction.\n\nServices at Impact Church are held on Saturday evenings and will resume next week following a lengthy pause for health precautions.\n\nEpilogue\n\nToday’s blog begins with, “The more things change, the more they stay the same.” From Wiktionary.org, there are at least two interpretations of this saying: a.) Turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo, and, b.) A change of heart must accompany experience before lasting change occurs. Perhaps you’ve seen one or both interpretations in today’s stories.\n\nHey Kids🙋🏻‍♀️\n\nThis Blog is written by my guest Blogger, Steve Ephraim. Enjoy!!!🙋🏻‍♂️\n\nSTEVE’S BLOG\n\nTHE MORE THINGS CHANGE…Let me begin with a French proverb, “plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.” If you didn’t recognize it, you will recognize its English counterpart, “The more things change, the more they stay the same.”\n\nWhat does this have to do with today’s blog?\n\nPerhaps my personal stories from this week will shed some light.
