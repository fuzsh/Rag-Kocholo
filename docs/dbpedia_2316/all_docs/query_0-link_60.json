It was in 1836 that the first of Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondele reached Missouri and from among them, Mother Francis Joseph Ivory saw to serve St. Teresa’s Academy in Kansas City, reaching there in 1866. It was this small academy that soon grew by leaps and bounds. It expanded its programs, then expanded its campus and soon introduced residential life on the campus. As of now, it is a Private, coeducational university in Kansas, Missouri.\n\nThe university maintains its affiliation with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet and hence still incorporates faith based values in its journey to prepare students to become active community members, eager “practice of all the spiritual and corporal works of mercy and which will most benefit the dear neighbor”.\n\nCampus life at Avila University is not impeded by its Christian based approach; it is rather enhanced and balanced. It begins each year with an annual Mass of the Holy Spirit which is then followed by fun events all year round such as Kickoff and Eagle Madness which are all about food, performances, games, entertainment and interaction with each other. There is Harmony Month which is an ethnic food festival and students as well staff brings in food specialty of their regions.

The meeting proved so successful that immediately a land was bought and the preparations were made and soon the instructions began. Within a single year, the college was up and was on its mission of carrying the vision of Christ forward through preparing and training for ministers and church leaders.\n\nAs a higher education institute for biblical studies, Baptist Bible College has never once deviated from its mission of promoting Christ centered education; however what has added to its progressive thinking as an institute is that it must introduce these values through a wider and global lens and to all spheres of life and work.\n\nBBC stays affiliated with the Baptist Bible Fellowship International and also operates Baptist Bible Theological Seminary which is strictly committed to train those individuals wishing to serve in the path of Jesus Christ as ministers, pastors or other church related positions. While academics are directed at bringing theoretical knowledge, seminary brings students closer to the spiritual life through practical application.

It was first established as St. Joseph’s Academy for girls in 1841 by the small Catholic Sisters’ Community in St. Louis “The American roots at Carondelet”. It was named after Mother St. John Fontbonne who reorganized the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph (CSJ) in LePuy, France in 1808 after the French revolution. In 1836, a group of six sisters from CSJ came to south St. Louis, Missouri, where they founded the American roots at Carondelet, five years before establishment of the Girls Academy. The sisters decided to open a college at the Carondelet for the purpose of providing women with higher education. Thus, they established Fontbonne College (FC) which opened its doors in 1923. Two years later, the FC moved to Wydown and Big Bend Boulevards in Clayton, Missouri. The overall liberal arts programs in addition to the economics and education departments generally developed since 1930 till 1950. Afterwards between 1950-1960, the department of education continued growing to include several programs in order to prepare efficient teachers capable of teaching impaired and handicapped children and adults. From 1980 till 2000, FC academic programs greatly expanded to include administration and business in addition to graduate studies in arts and science. Finally, FC status was changed to be a university in 2000.\n\nSince Fontbonne University is pastured by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, its mission is to encourage students to be responsible citizens who can act wisely, think crucially and serve the community in a moral way.\n\nThe University pays attention to facilitating access to sports activities for students beside their academic life.
