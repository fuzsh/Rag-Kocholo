She was born on April 19, 1932, in Kansas City, Kan. Alice lived in the same home, within walking distance of her Father's barbershop, until her marriage at the age of 19. Shortly after Alice's marriage to Bill G. Aldridge on April 22, 1951, she worked at the Kansas City Power and Light Company, but in 1952 left home to join him in Honolulu, Hawaii (then a territory), where she lived for two years. They returned to the states in 1954, and while he was stationed at Andrews AFB near Washington, DC, Alice worked in DC at the National Automobile Dealer's Association. Being always supportive of her husband and his career, she sacrificed hers to support his education. Upon discharge from the USAF in January 1955, Alice and Bill returned to Kansas City, where they lived for two years in the Hazen residence, while she worked at Owens Corning Fiberglas Corporation. In 1957, they purchased a home in Wyandotte County, and she continued to work. After nine years of marriage, she had her first child, Bryan. A year later she had her second child, Cara. With two young toddlers, she again made the sacrifice to her husband's education and career by moving to Cambridge, Mass. Upon their return to Kansas City for only another two years, she was again asked to move. They settled into another home in St. Louis County, where she had her last two children, Richard and Susan. They remained there for the next 17 years, interrupted by a one-year period, while they lived in Lawrence, Kan. During her time in St. Louis County, Alice completed two years of college, specializing in English history and literature, in which she was truly an expert. For most of her life she read an average of three books a week, mostly historical novels, and most dealing with English history. In 1977 Alice again had to uproot her family and move to DC, where she became an employee of the federal government. When they returned to St. Louis County in 1979, it would only be for a few months; and they moved back to Arlington, Va., where she lived from 1980 through 1995, and where she returned to work for the IRS as administrative assistant in the office of chief counsel. Alice retired from the IRS in 1995, and moved to Green Valley, Henderson, Nev., until 2006. After Alice became ill, they sold their home in Nevada and moved to Purcell, Mo., in Southwest Missouri, 70 miles south of where her mother and father had grown up. Alice had contracted cancer in 2005, was treated, and the cancer was in remission. But she had severe COPD and was very limited in her ability to walk. Alice is survived by her husband of 57 years, Bill Aldridge of Purcell; a son, Bryan Aldridge, of Fairfax, Va.; a daughter, Cara Aldridge Young, of Mifflinburg, Pa.; a son, Richard Aldridge, of Fairfax, Va., and a daughter, Susan Aldridge, of Broomfield, Colo. She is also survived by nine grandchildren. Finally, Alice is survived by her most cherished cat, \"Gremlin.\" Alice's ashes will be buried in Sheldon, Mo., where her father, mother, and grandparents are also buried. The gravesite ceremony will be private. A memorial service will be held in Arlington, Va., at a date to be announced. Alice Arlene (Hazen) Aldridge spent her life caring for and giving to others, as a devoted and loyal wife, and as a mother who would do anything for her children. In lieu of flowers, donations should be made to the American Cancer Society.\n\nMildred Garvin Feerick age 96, Joplin, Mo., died peacefully in her home on May 14, 2008, after a lengthy illness. She was born on Oct. 26, 1911, to Harry and Grace Garvin. When Mildred was five, her mother died and she went to live with her grandparents. She attended Joplin Schools and graduated from Joplin Senior High School in 1930. She later moved to St. Louis, Mo., where she met and married Gene Martin, they lived in Benton, Ill., for several years. Together they raised and showed Miniature Pinchers. She loved her puppies and always had at least one, sometimes more. Gene passed away in 1966. She moved back to St. Louis and worked at Principia Christian Science School for a short time. She then later returned to the Joplin area to be close to her family. In 1971, she married John Feerick; she helped John with his business, Feerick Candy Co. until his retirement. They loved to travel and enjoyed many good years together before he passed away June 7, 1986. She was also preceded in death by her brother, Burl M. Garvin in November 1988; a stepdaughter, Shirley Allen in January 2001; a nephew, Phillip L. Garvin in March 2001; and sister-in-law, Ceola Garvin in April 2008. She is survived by a step-daughter, Lynn Martin Russell, of Mount Vernon, Ind.; a stepdaughter, Delores Feerick, of Joplin; and grand daughters, Suzy Shriver, Sandy Nienhaus and their families from the St. Louiarea; two nephews, Gary M. Garvin and Robert D. Garvin, their families; and many great-nieces and nephews. We appreciate the wonderful people who helped her remain in her home these last years of her life. Thanks so much to Trinity Hospice, Myles, Mildred, Pam and Marci for their loving care. Graveside services will be held at 2 p.m. Friday at Mount Hope Cemetery in Webb City, with Rev. Erin Brown officiating. Visitation will be held at 1 p.m. Friday at Thornhill-Dillon Mortuary. Nephews and great nephews will serve as pall-bearers.
