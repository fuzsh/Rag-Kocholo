These features indicate strong biomarker and therapeutic potential and have generated broad interest, as evidenced by the steady year‐on‐year increase in the numbers of scientific publications about EVs. Important advances have been made in EV metrology and in understanding and applying EV biology. However, hurdles remain to realising the potential of EVs in domains ranging from basic biology to clinical applications due to challenges in EV nomenclature, separation from non‐vesicular extracellular particles, characterisation and functional studies. To address the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) updates its ‘Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles’, which was first published in 2014 and then in 2018 as MISEV2014 and MISEV2018, respectively. The goal of the current document, MISEV2023, is to provide researchers with an updated snapshot of available approaches and their advantages and limitations for production, separation and characterisation of EVs from multiple sources, including cell culture, body fluids and solid tissues. In addition to presenting the latest state of the art in basic principles of EV research, this document also covers advanced techniques and approaches that are currently expanding the boundaries of the field. MISEV2023 also includes new sections on EV release and uptake and a brief discussion of in vivo approaches to study EVs. Compiling feedback from ISEV expert task forces and more than 1000 researchers, this document conveys the current state of EV research to facilitate robust scientific discoveries and move the field forward even more rapidly.\n\nKeywords: ectosomes, exosomes, extracellular vesicles, extracellular particles, guidelines, microparticles, microvesicles, minimal information requirements, MISEV, reproducibility, rigor, standardisation\n\n1. AN INTRODUCTION TO ISEV AND MISEV\n\n1.1. Extracellular vesicles and MISEV\n\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) serve diverse and important roles in most biological systems, arising in part from their compositional complexity. EVs are lipid bilayer membrane‐delimited, nano‐ to micro‐sized particles that appear to be released by all cell types. The molecular and structural heterogeneity of EVs mean that many discoveries remain to be made in fundamental biology and development of biomarker and therapeutic applications, yet this same complexity also poses challenges at every stage of EV studies. From definition and categorisation to separation, characterisation, engineering and clinical applications, the ‘Minimum Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles’ (MISEV) aims to help all practitioners of EV research and application to follow best practices for each specific question and indication.\n\nNow in its third iteration, MISEV2023, as a field consensus document seeks to provide recommendations and guidance on EV‐related studies that encourage enhanced research design and reporting of experimental details, building on the criteria and guidelines set out in the previous two iterations. MISEV is produced by the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) (https://www.isev.org). Founded in 2011 with the mission to enhance EV research globally, ISEV is the leading professional society for scientists and clinicians involved in the study and use of extracellular vesicles. ISEV engages a diverse group of researchers across the world through its annual meeting, thematic workshops and other meetings (in‐person and virtual), peer‐reviewed journals, online learning platforms, and partnerships with other societies. ISEV is thus uniquely positioned to shepherd the development and dissemination of expert consensus on best‐practice guidelines and scientific considerations.\n\nMISEV2014 (Lotvall et al., 2014) was the first EV position paper produced by ISEV and designed to give robustness to EV analysis. MISEV2018 (Thery et al., 2018) gave a more in‐depth and critical assessment of the approaches and methods used to move the field forward, much of which still holds today. MISEV2018 also includes suggested experimental approaches to address some of the remaining challenges and to provide robust EV characterisation. The earlier MISEV recommendations remain largely or entirely valid, and MISEV2023 should be read in the context of the previous documents.\n\nLike the iterations before it, MISEV2023 provides succinct recommendations and guidance for EV researchers, with refinement of points raised in MISEV2018 and addition of recommendations and guidance for newer areas of development. MISEV2023 broadly covers the nomenclature, pre‐processing variables, separation and characterisation of EVs, as well as in vitro and in vivo analysis of EV release, uptake and functions.\n\nIn addition to previous MISEV guidelines (Lotvall et al., 2014; Thery et al., 2018), ISEV has prompted and coordinated development and dissemination of expert consensus on best‐practice guidelines and scientific considerations including inter‐society position papers (Welsh, Van Der Pol, Arkesteijn, et al., 2020), and focused recommendations of topic‐specific experts (Erdbrügger et al., 2021; Hill et al., 2013; Lener et al., 2015; Mateescu et al., 2017; Russell et al., 2019; Verweij et al., 2021; Witwer et al., 2013) (Table ). More recently, the ISEV Rigor and Standardisation Subcommittee oversees appointment and activities of thematic task forces and special interest groups on specific sources of EVs and other EV‐related topics. ISEV also recommends adoption of other reporting and atlas tools, such as the ‘Minimum Information for the Publication of Quantitative Real‐Time PCR Experiments’ (MIQE) for real‐time reverse transcriptase‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses (Bustin et al., 2009) and EV‐TRACK (EV‐TRACK Consortium et al., 2017; Roux et al., 2020). Overall, the activities and recommendations of ISEV share the aim of increasing rigor, reproducibility and transparency in EV research. The goal of this MISEV document is to help practitioners in all areas of EV research and application to implement or develop best practices for each individual EV source, type, research question or application.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTitleYearRef.Standardization of sample collection, isolation and analysis methods in extracellular vesicle research2013(Witwer et al., 2013)ISEV position paper: extracellular vesicle RNA analysis and bioinformatics2013(Hill et al., 2013)Minimal experimental requirements for definition of extracellular vesicles and their functions: a position statement from the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles2014(Lotvall et al., 2014)Applying extracellular vesicles‐based therapeutics in clinical trials—an ISEV position paper2015(Lener et al., 2015)Obstacles and opportunities in the functional analysis of extracellular vesicle RNA—an ISEV position paper2017(Mateescu et al., 2017)Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles 2018 (MISEV2018): a position statement of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and update of the MISEV2014 guidelines2018(Thery et al., 2018)Biological membranes in EV biogenesis, stability, uptake, and cargo transfer: an ISEV position paper arising from the ISEV membranes and EVs workshop2019(Russell et al., 2019)MIFlowCyt‐EV: a framework for standardized reporting of extracellular vesicle flow cytometry experiments2020(Welsh, Van Der Pol, Arkesteijn, et al., 2020)Urinary extracellular vesicles: A position paper by the Urine Task Force of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles2021(Erdbrügger et al., 2021)\n\n1.2. What MISEV IS and IS NOT\n\nSince MISEV2018 appeared, there has been much discussion of what the guidelines mean and how they should or should not be applied. Informed by that discussion, what MISEV IS, and IS NOT, is summarised below.\n\nMISEV IS:\n\nAn introduction to EV research.\n\nA set of recommendations that are meant to increase rigor, reproducibility, and transparency during EV study design, execution and reporting.\n\nA tool to assist reviewers and editors, using their own expert knowledge, in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of EV‐related proposals, funding applications, abstracts and manuscripts.\n\nA non‐exhaustive set of examples of various useful EV techniques and platforms.\n\nA rigor and standardisation framework that supports innovative EV research and applications and parties ranging from product developers to regulators.\n\nAn indication of current, broad consensus in the EV field as well as some areas of uncertainty and growth.\n\nRelevant to translational and clinical research and applications, including production and initial evaluation of therapeutic EVs.\n\nApplicable to all sorts of EV research and applications, not just those involving mammalian EVs. Although examples provided in MISEV may be specific to mammalian EVs, the basic principles are most likely applicable to all EV sources. These include informative nomenclature, definition of sources, description of separation/concentration techniques, and characterisation of EVs, properly controlled functional studies, and comprehensive reporting.\n\nBy contrast, MISEV IS NOT:\n\nA one‐size‐fits‐all blueprint, a comprehensive checklist of ‘dos and don'ts’, or a substitute for careful expert judgement. There is no technique or platform that is absolutely required or prohibited by MISEV. Similarly, MISEV does not mandate use of any particular marker or markers, enriched or depleted. Chosen techniques and targets should be fit for purpose, appropriate for the experimental system, contributing to overall MISEV compliance, and properly reported. Importantly, no research group has access to all techniques and platforms.\n\nA barrier to innovation. When introducing a new technique or new application of EVs, it is possible that some aspects of the approach do not fit perfectly into the existing MISEV framework, or more likely, into a reviewer's interpretation of it. See above on absolute mandates and invoke the exceptions if you must. MISEV should not stifle innovation, but rather inform how innovative or new techniques are presented and validated.\n\nA means to prevent publication or funding of a particular project. Just as MISEV should not stifle innovation, it should not be used to prevent research from being shared with the community. For example, an ‘exosome’ or ‘ectosome’ study that does not prove biogenesis can be presented instead as about EVs, or an ‘EV’ report without full characterisation as a broader extracellular particle study. Proper controls might be needed to prove the contribution of EVs to an effect, but if they cannot be done, it might suffice to acknowledge the caveats.\n\nA comprehensive collection of citations, each of which entirely embodies the recommendations of MISEV. The MISEV document is not a literature review or compendium. Only a small percentage of the EV literature is cited here, and each citation is made for a specific purpose. Citation in MISEV does not imply endorsement of a report, author team, journal or publisher by ISEV, nor does it suggest primacy or perfection of the cited study. Some cited studies may contain aspects that are inconsistent with MISEV recommendations. Also, many excellent studies are not cited in this document.\n\nIn summary, the spirit of MISEV is embodied in just a handful of questions:\n\nWhat terms do you use, and what do they mean?\n\nFrom what/where did you obtain your EVs?\n\nHow did you separate, concentrate, characterise and store them?\n\nHow confidently can you attribute a function or biomarker to EVs versus other components?\n\nHave you shared data and reported methods in sufficient detail to enable others to replicate or reproduce your results?\n\n1.3. How to use MISEV2023\n\nMISEV2023 is intended to aid any and all EV researchers: from those just starting their EV journey to more established investigators who wish to understand the current state of the art and/or cutting‐edge problems faced by the EV community. However, the result is a large document that may require some help to navigate.\n\nNomenclature (Section 2) is applicable to all EV studies. Clear and consistent language will help to ensure that results are understandable and comparable.\n\nFor those who are newer to EV research, we consider Sections 3, 4, 5 to be vital, covering minimum considerations for sample collection/processing, EV separation methods and EV characterisation, respectively.\n\nSections 6, 7, 8, 9 provide further technique‐specific guidance for EV characterisation, approaches to modulate EV release and uptake, EV functional studies, and the EV analysis in vivo. These sections provide the reader with up‐to‐date information to support informed decisions, but, for the most part, do not give specific recommendations.\n\nThe information and guidelines presented in MISEV2023 thus promote rigor, reproducibility and transparency in EV science, with the goal to ensure that conclusions are supported by the experiments performed and the information reported.\n\nConsensus: 89.3% (891) of MISEV2023 survey respondents agreed “completely,” and 10.7% (107) agreed “mostly” with Section 1: An introduction to ISEV and MISEV. No respondents disagreed (“mostly” or “completely”), and no respondents stated that they had no opinion and/or expertise.\n\n2. NOMENCLATURE\n\n2.1. EV definition and EV subtypes\n\nDefinition: The term ‘extracellular vesicles’ (EVs) refers to particles that are released from cells, are delimited by a lipid bilayer, and cannot replicate on their own (i.e., do not contain a functional nucleus). The current definition of EV is retained from MISEV2018, except that the 2018 use of the word ‘naturally’ (as in ‘naturally released’) has been removed to avoid unintended exclusion of engineered EVs or EVs produced under various cell culture conditions. In general, ISEV recommends use of the generic term ‘EV’ and operational extensions of this term instead of inconsistently defined and sometimes misleading terms such as ‘exosomes’ and ‘ectosomes’ that are associated with biogenesis pathways that are difficult to establish.\n\nRegarding ‘operational terms’ that can be added as a prefix to ‘EV’ (Table ), their use continues to be encouraged with caution if one or more EV subtypes are separated on the basis of characteristics such as size, density, molecular composition or cellular origin. We urge careful and clear definition of these operational terms. For example, terms such as ‘small’ and ‘large’ have been commonly used to denote EV populations over the last few years, usually after presumed size‐based populations of EVs have been separated with methods such as filtration or differential ultracentrifugation (differential UC, dUC). However, although ‘small’ might generally refer to EVs <200 nm in diameter, there is no strict consensus on upper and lower size cut‐offs, and it has also become clear that many separation methods, such as dUC, yield EV populations with overlapping size profiles. Thus, while such terminology may still be used, researchers should be aware of its limitations and strive to define terms as clearly as possible.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTermDefinitionUsageExtracellular vesicles (EVs)Particles that are released from cells, are delimited by a lipid bilayer, and cannot replicate on their own.RecommendedNon‐vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs)Multimolecular assemblies that are released from cells and do not have a lipid bilayer (non‐vesicular extracellular particle fraction).RecommendedExtracellular particles (EPs)Umbrella term for all particles outside the cell, including EVs and NVEPs.RecommendedEV mimeticEV‐like particles that are produced through direct artificial manipulation. This term is preferred over ‘exosome‐like vesicles’ and similar terms that imply specific biogenesis‐related properties.RecommendedArtificial cell‐derived vesicles (ACDVs)EV mimetics that are produced in the laboratory under conditions of induced cell disruption, such as extrusion.RecommendedSynthetic vesicles (SVs)EV mimetics that are synthesized de novo from molecular components or made as hybrid entities, e.g., fusions between liposomes and native EVs.RecommendedSmall EVs (operational term)Based on the diameter of the separated particles, small EVs are often described as <200 nm in diameter. However, measured diameter is related to the specific characterization method.Recommended, but caution required\n\nLarge EVs\n\n(operational term)\n\nBased on the diameter of the separated particles, large EVs are often described as >200 nm in diameter. However, measured diameter is related to the specific characterization method.Recommended, but caution requiredOther ‘operational terms’Physical characteristics: e.g., diameter: small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), large EVs (lEVs), density: low, medium, high (defined ranges). Biochemical composition: e.g., contains a specific (macro)molecule, such as a protein. Cellular origin and/or conditions under which EVs were generated: terms that highlight specific aspects of biogenesis such as molecular mechanisms, energy‐dependence (or lack thereof) and functional state of the parent cell related to stress or death.Recommended, but caution requiredExosomeBiogenesis‐related term indicating origin from the endosomal system. Unless subcellular origin can be demonstrated, it is likely that a broad population of EVs is being studied, not exosomes specifically. Exosomes represent a subtype of small EVs: the diameter of intraluminal vesicles of endosomes is generally smaller than 200 nm.Discouraged unless subcellular origin can be demonstratedEctosomeBiogenesis‐related term indicating origin from the plasma membrane. Unless subcellular origin can be demonstrated it is likely that a broad population of EVs is being studied, not ectosomes specifically. Ectosomes can have a wide range of sizes, including sizes similar to those of exosomes.Discouraged unless subcellular origin can be demonstratedMicrovesicleBiogenesis‐related term indicating origin from the plasma membrane. However, historically, the term has often been used to designate large EVs or all EVs, whatever their subcellular origin. This term can therefore lead to confusion.DiscouragedExosome‐like vesiclesAs ‘exosome’ is a biogenesis‐related term indicating origin from the endosomal system, this and similar terms are discouraged for synthesized EV mimetics.Discouraged\n\nAs mentioned above, terms related to presumed biogenesis pathways should be used only with caution and strong evidence. The term ‘exosome’ refers to EVs from internal compartments of the cell that are released via the multivesicular body (MVB), while the term ‘ectosome’ (a.k.a., microvesicle, microparticle) refers to EVs from the cell surface. Numerous specialised terms have also been used to denote EVs that arise during specific cellular processes such as cell migration (‘migrasomes’) or programmed cell death (‘apoptotic bodies’). In some cases, biogenesis or release of specific EV subtypes may be inhibited or stimulated by pharmacological or genetic intervention (see also 7.1). Unfortunately, most EV separation techniques do not enrich for EVs produced by different mechanisms, and definitive characterisation of biogenesis‐based subtypes is also difficult, with no universal molecular markers of ectosomes, exosomes or other EV subtypes. Therefore, ISEV discourages the use of biogenesis‐based terms unless such an EV population is specifically separated and characterised. Of note, ‘sEV’ (for small EV) and ‘exosome’ are not synonymous: small EV populations include both small ectosomes and exosomes. For the reasons above, most of the existing ‘exosome’ and ‘ectosome/microvesicle’ literature refers to a broad population of EVs, and not to EVs that are released via specific biogenesis pathways. Some EV‐like particles may not fully meet the definition of EVs as given above. For example, if a cell is extruded, the resulting particles have not been strictly ‘released’ from the cell.\n\n2.2. EV mimetics\n\nA term such as ‘EV mimetics’ (EVMs) can be used to denote EV‐like particles that are produced through direct disruption of cells, by de novo synthesis from molecular components, or by fusion of native EVs with, for example, liposomes. Whatever nomenclature is used for such particles, it will ideally indicate the general production process, differentiate the particles from native EVs, and not claim resemblance to EVs from a specific biogenesis pathway. That is, avoid ‘exosome‐like vesicles’ and similar terms that incorrectly imply specific biogenesis‐related properties. Some examples of possible terms, but without strict endorsement, are artificial cell‐derived vesicles (ACDVs) for vesicles from extruded cells and synthetic vesicles (SVs) for EV mimetics that are synthesised de novo from molecular components or made as hybrid entities, for example, fusions between liposomes and native EVs (Table ).\n\n2.3. How to approach non‐vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs)\n\nThere is a growing awareness of a wide diversity of non‐vesicular extracellular particles that often co‐separate with EVs, and the ISEV community specifically requested guidance in the run‐up to MISEV2023 on how to handle and name these particles. Since ISEV is a society of EV experts, we cannot presume to establish a nomenclature for other types of extracellular particles, such as lipoprotein particles (LPPs), ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), viruses, or various newly proposed particle types like exomeres and supermeres. Nevertheless, how EVs relate to other particles—and how they can be separated from them and characterised along with them in complex mixtures—is of great relevance to the EV field. Therefore, MISEV2023 provides the following nomenclature proposals while recognising that other terms may be required for increased clarity (Figure , Table ).\n\nExtracellular particles (EPs) is the preferred overarching term for cell‐derived multimolecular assemblies in the nanometre to micron size range, including both EVs and non‐vesicular entities:\n\nNon‐vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs) are all non‐EV particles made from cell‐derived components of one or more molecular classes (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids); lipids, if present, do not form a delimiting bilayer membrane. NVEPs and EVs may have overlapping physicochemical properties, and NVEPs may greatly outnumber EVs in biological matrices. As a result, most EP separation methods result in NVEP/EV co‐isolation. Similarly, many EP characterisation methods do not identify EVs specifically. NVEPs that are smaller than EVs may not be detected by some EV characterisation methods, thus their quantity in an EP preparation may remain unknown. Therefore, when EVs and NVEPs cannot be fully distinguished from each other, the term ‘EP’ may be appropriate, or the use of ‘EV preparation’ or ‘EV‐containing preparation’.\n\nTable is a quick‐reference card of recommended nomenclature.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n‘Extracellular vesicles’ is the term for particles that are delimited by a lipid bilayer and cannot replicate on their own (vesicular component of extracellular particles).\n\nOperational terms are encouraged, but with caution, as these can be influenced by separation methods.\n\nBiogenesis terms are discouraged unless subcellular origin can be demonstrated for the specific EV source and condition. With few exceptions, a broad population of EVs is studied, not ectosomes or exosomes specifically.\n\n‘Extracellular particles’ is the overarching term for cell‐derived multimolecular assemblies in the nanometer to micron size range, including both vesicular and non‐vesicular entities.\n\n‘Non‐vesicular extracellular particles’ is an accurate term for cell‐derived multimolecular assemblies that are non‐vesicular in nature (i.e., the non‐vesicular fraction of extracellular particles).\n\nConsensus: 79.5% (793) of MISEV2023 survey respondents agreed “completely,” and 19.9% (199) agreed “mostly” with Section 2: Nomenclature. 0.4% (4) “mostly” disagreed, and 0.2% (2) stated that they had no opinion and/or expertise. No respondents disagreed “completely.”\n\n3. COLLECTION AND PRE‐PROCESSING: PRE‐ANALYTICAL VARIABLES THROUGH TO STORAGE\n\nAn array of factors in sample collection, pre‐processing (i.e., before specific EV separation/concentration steps), and storage of EV‐containing sources and their derivatives may affect EVs quantitatively and qualitatively. Some considerations related to these factors are common between many EV source materials, such as how to maximise (and measure) the quality of starting material; reporting all relevant donor characteristics for biofluid/solid tissue samples; measures of the quantity and quality of the source material as the baseline for the data collected during EV characterisation; and standardising and reporting pre‐processing variables. In contrast, other recommendations may be specific to the starting source, such as approaches to remove source‐specific contaminants/co‐isolates and to confirm their removal.\n\n3.1. Common recommendations\n\nDescribe the source of EV‐containing materials. For materials from human and non‐human animal donors, report relevant donor characteristics, including but not limited to age, biological sex, substance exposures (medications, substance use) and disease.\n\nReport the quantity (e.g., sample volume, mass) and quality of source material.\n\nProvide all methodologic details of sample collection.\n\nConsider how pre‐separation storage may influence the EVs that are eventually separated. Where relevant, avoid repeated freeze‐thaw cycles or assess effects of freeze‐thaw.\n\nReport all storage parameters pre‐ and post‐EV separation (including use of preservatives or cryoprotectants, temperature, time, freezing procedure, storage vessel, number of freeze‐thaw cycles and thawing method).\n\nRemove cells from all EV source materials as early as possible in pre‐processing. Cell disruption can form particles resembling native EVs, and post‐collection cellular processes like activation and death can alter EV composition and function.\n\nAssess and report the degree of depletion of cells and source‐specific, common EV co‐isolates during pre‐processing and, later, after EV separation/concentration.\n\nImplement quality control measures throughout the sample collection, pre‐processing and EV separation.\n\nIf samples must be pooled to obtain sufficient EVs for study, report the number of individual samples in a pool, the donor demographics contributing to the pool, the quantity (e.g., volume) of each individual sample and final quantity. Where possible, follow up with individual samples.\n\nIn studies that seek to determine if EVs or EV cargo can serve as biomarkers of a disease or condition, also test whether non‐enriched materials, for example, NVEPs or whole biofluid, may have similar associations.\n\nFor those EV sources for which ISEV has a Task Force (isev.org/taskforces), we recommend that researchers keep themselves updated and informed on outputs of that Task Force. See also the next sections with some specific recommendations.\n\n3.2. Cell culture‐conditioned medium\n\nAll types of cells cultured in vitro release EVs and other factors into their culture medium, thus creating cell culture‐conditioned medium [CCM; Shekari et al., 2023]. This includes eukaryotic cells from multi‐ and unicellular organisms and prokaryotic cells including gram‐positive and ‐negative bacteria and Mycobacteria. Most recommendations in this section apply to CCM from all cell types; additional and more specific details on bacterial EVs are provided in Section 3.3.\n\nCell culture parameters for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells include the producing cells (e.g., name, viability, passage number and seeding and harvest density); medium components (e.g., basal medium, complex additives such as serum, nutrients, micronutrients, antibiotics/mycotics and any other additives); culture conditions, including 2D/3D/suspension culture, temperature, pH, gas concentrations and any physical stimuli; duration of conditioning; harvesting approaches; and any detected contaminations or infections. Cell culture conditions directly and indirectly affect EV yield, composition, and function. Culture media components can contain EVs or may be taken up by cells and repackaged into EVs (Lehrich et al., 2021; Palviainen et al., 2019). Complex supplements such as blood serum [e.g., foetal bovine/calf serum (FBS/FCS)] and platelet lysate (PL) are often used in mammalian cell culture, but they are rich in EVs, NVEPs, and various, often undefined entities, including DNA fragments and micronutrients (Arigony et al., 2013; Lehrich et al., 2021). Depleting EVs from these supplements can be difficult to accomplish and verify (Erdbrügger et al., 2021; Lehrich et al., 2018), and depletion of complex supplements, for example, by ultracentrifugation, may depend on degree of dilution. Commercial ‘EV‐free’ products should also not be assumed to be devoid of EVs without verification. Use of both EV‐depleted medium and ‘defined’ (serum/PL‐free) media may alter cell physiology and EV production (Lehrich et al., 2021). Since viable and dying cells may release different subtypes of EVs (Crescitelli et al., 2013; Shlomovitz et al., 2021), and since EVs produced by only a few percent of dying cells may outnumber EVs generated by healthy cells, the proportion of live and dying cells in a culture affects proportions of EV subtypes and EV quantity. Unwanted microbial contamination (common: Mycoplasma), should be checked and reported. These microbes affect many characteristics of producing cells (Zhang et al., 2000); they or their constituents may be repackaged into EVs of the host culture (Yang et al., 2012); and some may also release their own EVs (Gaurivaud et al., 2018).\n\nRecommendations:\n\nCCM recommendations made in MISEV2018 (Thery et al., 2018) are still relevant. These include, but are not limited to, reporting medium composition and preparation; characteristics of producing cells including identity, seeding and harvest density and viability at harvest; culture conditions including vessel/system, surface coating (if any), temperature, and gas concentrations; physical or chemical stimulants/treatments, if any; frequency, intervals and method of CCM harvest; and any CCM storage before EV separation. If cells are from a primary source, rather than an established cell line, report harvesting and pre‐culturing conditions such as enzymatic digestion.\n\nIf serum, PL or other complex additives are used, report the source and the percent of the total medium. If EV depletion of such additives is done, report method and degree of depletion (including dilution, which may be necessary prior to depletion methods involving centrifugation) using the same methods used to characterise released EVs. Vendors of EV‐depleted supplements are also encouraged to report method and degree of EV depletion.\n\nNon‐conditioned medium controls should be processed and characterised to assess the contribution of the medium itself to putative EV measurements.\n\n3.3. Bacteria\n\nThe diversity of bacteria, bacterial EVs and source material characteristics makes it difficult to issue universal recommendations on sample type, pre‐processing, separation, collection and characterisation. Bacterial EVs arise from outer and inner membranes of gram‐negative bacteria and cytoplasmic membranes of gram‐positive bacteria through blebbing and lytic biogenesis pathways (Toyofuku et al., 2023). Different species, strains (Bitto, Cheng, et al., 2021; Bitto, Zavan, et al. 2021; McMillan & Kuehn, 2023; Zavan et al., 2023), and growth conditions (Hong et al., 2019; Keenan & Allardyce, 2000) affect EV heterogeneity on multiple levels, including function (Turner et al., 2018). Bacterial EVs can be harvested from mono‐ or polymicrobial culture in vitro, in vivo/ex vivo sources such as body fluids or faeces, and environmental samples ranging from soil to seawater. Despite this diversity, some recommendations are possible.\n\nFor most bacterial species, studies of the influence of culture conditions on the yield and composition of bacterial EVs are in their infancy, but most considerations for culture‐derived eukaryotic EVs also apply to bacterial EVs (Bose et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2015). These include effects of media composition, oxygenation/aeration and culture format (for bacteria: standing, shaking, roller bottle, bioreactor, planktonic cell or biofilm) and growth phase (Bitto, Cheng, et al., 2021; Bitto, Zavan, et al. 2021; Kuehn & Kesty, 2005; Mehanny et al., 2022; Zavan et al., 2019). Thus, culture details should be reported.\n\nFollowing sample collection, as for eukaryotic EVs, all methodologic details of separation/concentration should be reported. Non‐specific methods like precipitation and ultracentrifugation may co‐isolate and/or aggregate unwanted non‐EV materials. For bacteria, these may include pili, flagellae, phage, and protein, lipoprotein, and nucleoprotein complexes. Filtration and chromatography methods are gentler alternatives (Bitto & Kaparakis‐Liaskos, 2022; Liangsupree et al., 2021). In density gradient ultracentrifugation, densities of EV‐rich fractions should be determined for each bacterium and growth condition, with clear reporting of fractions (Bitto & Kaparakis‐Liaskos, 2022; Singorenko et al., 2017). Consider that different separation methods may enrich or deplete subtypes of bacterial EVs.\n\nDetailed characterisation of bacterial EV preparations beyond core measurements of size distribution and macromolecular content is limited by the availability of validated, commercially available affinity reagents to bacterial markers for only a limited number of species. In many cases, markers of co‐isolating materials require further definition. Lipopolysaccharide [LPS, gram‐negative bacteria, Tulkens et al., 2020], lipotechoic acid [LTA, gram‐positive bacteria, Champagne‐Jorgensen et al., 2021] and mycobacterial lipids (Prados‐Rosales et al., 2011) are universal markers for these broad classes of bacterial EVs. LPS and LTA have the advantage of commercially available antibodies. However, LPS can be present in NVEPs including LPS micelles and complexes with LPS binding protein that may be present in in vivo samples (Page et al., 2022), so appropriate controls should be included. Finally, for functional assays, normalisation methods for bacterial EV input should be accurately reported, e.g., different protein assay types can return different values (Bitto, Zavan, et al., 2021).\n\nRecommendations:\n\nIn addition to other culture parameters, report bacterial growth phase at harvest.\n\nLimit storage prior to EV separation/concentration, especially if samples are left unfiltered.\n\nWhen obtaining bacterial EVs from in vivo and environmental sources, consider that host EVs or EVs from non‐target species are likely present.\n\nLPS and LTA are broad markers of gram‐negative and ‐positive bacteria, respectively, with well‐characterised, commercially‐available affinity reagents. In many species, specific markers of EVs and non‐EV materials remain unavailable.\n\nNon‐vesicular co‐isolates of bacterial EVs may include pili, flagellae, phage and protein, lipoprotein and nucleoprotein complexes.\n\n3.4. Blood\n\nBlood is the most studied biofluid in EV research, and most studies involve human blood. Previous MISEV guidelines, ISEV position papers and other publications (Clayton et al., 2019; Coumans et al., 2017; Thery et al., 2018; Witwer et al., 2013) highlighted the importance of standardisation and reporting of (i) donor variables, for example, age, biological sex, circadian rhythm, diet, exercise level and medication, and (ii) pre‐analytical processing variables such as blood collection, preparation, handling, storage, anticoagulants, centrifugation protocols and handling time (Buntsma et al., 2022; Dhondt et al., 2020, 2023; Lacroix et al., 2012; López‐Guerrero et al., 2023; Gyorgy et al., 2014; Palviainen et al., 2020), which remain valid. Here, we focus on the complexity of blood, which contains cells, lipoproteins, proteins and other factors that may be retained in EV preparations and confound downstream analysis. The degree to which blood samples are processed and EVs are separated from common co‐isolates depends on the study aim and the downstream analysis. The MIBlood‐EV was developed by the ISEV Blood Task Force to enable scientists to report the traceability of blood‐derived samples used for EV studies (Lucien et al., 2023). The MIBlood‐EV is divided into categories of: (a) general study information, (b) blood collection, processing, storage, (c) qualitative and quantitative evaluation of haemolysis, platelets and lipoproteins, three major confounding factors in blood EV research.\n\nBlood cells account for about 45% of the blood volume, so removal of cells before any cell‐disruptive processing such as freeze/thawing (which forms EV‐like cell fragments) and avoidance of cell activation (and thus release of EVs post‐collection) is particularly important. Red blood cells are dense and thus relatively easy to separate from EVs by low‐speed centrifugation. However, red blood cells may lyse (‘haemolysis’) during blood collection and processing, releasing internal contents such as haemoglobin, which turns the plasma or serum a reddish instead of yellow colour. Most other blood cells can also be efficiently removed by centrifugation. In contrast, 1–3 μm platelets are derived from megakaryocytes, highly abundant in blood, and overlap in size range and/or density with EVs. The presence of even a few platelets may affect downstream EV analysis, and activated platelets will release large numbers of EVs. Although various centrifugation protocols are used to deplete platelets from plasma and serum (Bracht et al., 2023; Karimi et al., 2022), these protocols incompletely separate platelets from EVs, and extent of platelet depletion is typically unreported. Additional depletion of residual platelets from plasma and serum can be achieved by filtration (Bettin et al., 2022; Bracht et al., 2023).\n\nLipoproteins are another main confounding class of NVEPs, including high‐density, low‐density, intermediate‐density, and very low‐density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL) as well as larger chylomicrons. They overlap in size (all but HDL), density (HDL), and/or molecular composition with blood EVs, and some lipoprotein subtypes outnumber blood EVs by orders of magnitude (Johnsen et al., 2019; Simonsen, 2017). Because neither density‐ nor size‐based separation can separate all lipoproteins from EVs, a combination of methods that exploit different physical and biochemical properties (here reported in Chapter 4) is recommended when more pure EV populations are required (Karimi et al., 2018; Ter‐Ovanesyan et al., 2023; Van Deun et al., 2020; Vergauwen et al., 2021; Zhang, Borg, et al., 2020).\n\nBlood also contains high concentrations of free, ‘soluble’ proteins such as serum albumin, immunoglobulins and fibrinogen, as well as protein and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) aggregates, that may co‐isolate with EVs and affect downstream analysis. These proteins are generally smaller and denser than EVs, allowing separation from EVs by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), density gradient centrifugation, or combinations thereof.\n\nOf note, the surface of EVs, especially in complex environments such as blood, is covered with a biomolecular corona of various molecules and particles [(Palviainen et al., 2020; Tóth et al., 2021; Wolf et al., 2022; Yerneni et al., 2022) and see also Section 4.7]. Hence, some blood proteins and lipoproteins, previously defined as contaminants of the EV preparation, may be truly associated with EVs and remain even after the EVs have been rigorously but gently separated from blood.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nEffects of donor characteristics on blood and EV properties are better studied for blood than for many other EV sources and are thus especially important to consider and report. For example, large lipoprotein particles such as chylomicrons have elevated concentrations after dietary intake, so to minimise their influence, collect blood from overnight‐fasted donors.\n\nWhen blood is collected by venipuncture, use the largest feasible needle gauge to minimise platelet activation and haemolysis. To minimise bacterial and skin cell contamination and to avoid tissue factor‐mediated platelet activation, it may also be a good practice to discard a small volume of the blood draw (e.g., for human blood draws, the first 2–3 mL).\n\nSelect blood collection tubes/anticoagulants that are compatible with downstream analyses.\n\nFollowing collection, minimise platelet activation and EV release by avoiding excessive agitation and low temperatures and processing to plasma or serum as quickly as possible.\n\nUse a plasma or serum preparation protocol that efficiently removes platelets but not EVs. If centrifugation is used, draw supernatant from the top down with a pipette, leaving a specified amount of plasma or serum on top of the pellet to avoid disturbing the pellet and releasing platelets.\n\nMajor contaminants/co‐isolates of blood EVs are platelets, lipoproteins, haemolysis products, and a host of soluble/aggregated proteins including RNPs. Determine and report relative enrichment of EVs over whichever of these materials is important in a given study.\n\nComplete the MIBlood‐EV reporting tool and attach it as supplementary material for any manuscript with research using blood specimens. The completed document should also be added to the MIBlood‐EV shared folder (details at: https://www.isev.org/rigor‐standardization)\n\n3.5. Urine\n\nUrine is the second most‐analysed biofluid after blood and can be obtained non‐invasively, serially and in large quantities. Urinary EV (uEVs) and their contents are promising biomarkers and bio‐regulators in health and disease of the kidney, the urogenital tract and possibly other organs and systems (Burger et al., 2014; Carreras‐Planella et al., 2021; Erdbrügger et al., 2021; Morikawa et al., 2019; Ramirez‐Garrastacho et al., 2022). Challenges in uEV studies arise from the diverse cellular origin of uEVs and the dynamic composition of urine, which varies by fluid intake, time of collection, diet, exercise, age, biological sex, medication and health and disease status. Please refer to previous, specific recommendations of the Urine Task Force of ISEV for all stages of uEV research: a position paper (Erdbrügger et al., 2021) and a ‘Quick Reference Card’ (van Royen et al., 2023).\n\nHere, we focus on considerations specific for urine as an EV source. For urine collection and storage, many biobanked urine samples have not been processed to remove cells prior to storage, so uEV‐specific biobanks or new collections may be needed. For any urine sample, urine proteins are the most common co‐isolates/contaminants of uEV preparations (Dhondt et al., 2020). Protein abundance in urine spans five orders of magnitude. Amongst the highest‐abundance urinary proteins (Tamm‐Horsfall protein (THP), albumin and 20 other serum‐filtered proteins) THP can not only co‐isolate with uEVs, reducing uEV purity, but also polymerise into lattice‐like networks that trap uEVs, reducing uEV yield. THP can be depolymerised and reduced by changing urine ionic strength or pH or by treating with reducing reagents (Correll et al., 2022; Liu, Cauvi, et al., 2018; Pisitkun et al., 2004). Removal of THP may be needed for downstream characterisation procedures such as mass spectrometry, but it is less necessary for other approaches (e.g., single‐EV analysis by immunolabelling).\n\nuEV studies in particular require careful normalisation approaches because of the magnitude of inter‐ and intra‐individual variation in urine concentrations (i.e., of solutes in the urine; specific gravity), resulting from changes in the external environment, water and salt homeostasis, and circadian patterns. Because uEV levels may vary with urine concentration, normalisation between samples is necessary to counterbalance data variance. Unfortunately, there is no consensus method or marker(s) accounting for excretion rate and uEV processing that can be used for the robust normalisation of uEV quantity and/or content. Currently, normalisation for excretion rate is done based on absolute (total protein, uEV number, uEV biomarker) or relative (time collection, relative to urinary creatinine, osmolality) measures. In studies of organ‐specific uEVs, organ‐specific markers can be used; for example, prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) concentrations can account for the proportion of prostate fluid in urine.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nFollow previously published ISEV recommendations (Erdbrügger et al., 2021; van Royen et al., 2023).\n\nPerform uEV research using cell‐free urine and cell‐free urine biobanks.\n\nWhere appropriate, report methodology and outcome of uEV co‐isolate/contaminant depletion (THP, albumin and other serum‐filtered proteins).\n\nFor normalisation, collect data both on uEVs and non‐EV urine parameters (e.g., creatinine, PSA or others as applicable) to estimate absolute or relative excretion rates.\n\n3.6. Cerebrospinal fluid\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bathes the central nervous system (CNS) and contains biomarkers of CNS health and disease (Gaetani et al., 2019; Hühmer et al., 2006; Jack et al., 2018; Rao et al., 2013). Several CSF‐ specific factors must be considered in CSF EV studies. CSF is produced in the brain ventricles and circulates through the brain and spinal cord in a continuous flow (Czarniak et al., 2023). This flow establishes a rostro‐caudal gradient, with lower levels of some brain proteins (e.g., S‐100β, total or phosphorylated Tau), but higher levels of others (e.g., neurofilament, amyloid‐β40 or β42) in the lumbar region relative to the brain (Jingami et al., 2019; Rostgaard et al., 2023). Hence, collection site (e.g., lumbar/spinal canal vs. brain) and volume may affect CSF composition (Cameron et al., 2019; Teunissen et al., 2009). Common confounders of CSF studies include residual cells and blood contamination, since protein concentrations in blood are 200−400 times greater than in CSF (You et al., 2005). Useful measurements of contaminants include cell counts (e.g., CSF samples that contain >500 erythrocytes/μL might be excluded (Teunissen et al., 2009) and protein assays for hemoglobin, catalase, peroxiredoxin, carbonic anhydrase I, apolipoprotein B‐100, IgM, apolipoprotein B‐100, fibrinogen or haptoglobin (Aasebø et al., 2014; You et al., 2005). Human donor characteristics reported to affect CSF biomarkers (Klener et al., 2014; Lewczuk et al., 2006; Mattsson et al., 2011) include sex (Li et al., 2017), ethnicity (Howell et al., 2017), disease‐relevant genotypes (Li et al., 2017), medications (Riekse et al., 2006; Wong, 2007) and substance use (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). Age (Shah et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2005) may be particularly important for cohort design and normalisation considerations, since human CSF protein concentrations are high in neonates, decline through childhood and increase from adolescence through adulthood (Howell et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2005). For biomarkers that cycle with circadian rhythm, the time of day for collection is important (Lucey et al., 2017). However, these effects of pre‐analytical variables may or may not affect EVs.\n\nCSF EV studies are also challenged by very low concentration of EVs in CSF and the precious nature of CSF samples. Since CSF collection is relatively invasive, total CSF volume is limited for most patients, and sampling is usually done only for specific disease indications, the total number of samples and their volumes are small. For example, most established human CSF biorepositories are able to share 1.0 mL or less of each sample. As a result, high‐yield separation approaches and high‐sensitivity characterisation assays are especially needed for CSF EV studies (Krušić Alić et al., 2022; Sandau et al., 2020; Ter‐Ovanesyan et al., 2021). Pooling samples from multiple donors may be an option to optimise new protocols or to perform omics characterisation, with or without follow‐up with higher‐sensitivity specific molecular assays for individual samples.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nReport anatomic collection site and volume of CSF drawn because of possible influence of the rostral‐caudal CSF gradient.\n\nMeasure levels of specific co‐isolates/contaminants, such as blood cells and blood proteins, and establish exclusion criteria where appropriate, for example, >500 erythrocytes/μL from biomarker studies.\n\nHigh‐yield separations and high‐sensitivity characterisation methods are especially important for studying CSF EVs, and sample pooling may be needed.\n\n3.7. Saliva\n\nHealthy adult humans produce 500–1500 mL saliva per day, varying with pathological and physiological conditions (Chiappin et al., 2007). Saliva is non‐invasively accessed, making it an attractive source of biomarkers, EV‐associated or not, especially for oral and periodontal conditions (Nonaka & Wong, 2022; Ogawa et al., 2008). In saliva EV studies, common co‐isolates include salivary components such as eukaryotic cells and subcellular structures, proteins such as enzymes and antibodies, electrolytes, food debris, bacterial cells and bacterial EVs (Aps & Martens, 2005; Chiappin et al., 2007; Han, Bartold, et al., 2021; Kaczor‐Urbanowicz et al., 2019; Ngamchuea et al., 2017; Ogawa et al., 2008). The overall composition of saliva depends on the relative activity and contributions of the three major pairs of salivary glands—parotid, submandibular and sublingual—as well as 300–750 minor salivary glands (Aps & Martens, 2005; Khurshid et al., 2016), which may secrete different amounts of salivary enzymes and mucins.\n\nParameters to report in saliva studies are whether whole saliva or saliva from one type of gland only is collected; the method of saliva collection (Beale et al., 2016; Khurshid et al., 2016; Navazesh, 1993); salivation stimulus, if any (Gomar‐Vercher et al., 2018). Recency of food and drink intake may have outsized effects on saliva quantity and quality and should be standardised if possible or assessed at collection. From studies of whole saliva, age (Xu et al., 2019), biological sex (Li‐Hui et al., 2016), smoking (Rad et al., 2010), stress (Keremi et al., 2017), exercise (Ligtenberg et al., 2016), oral hygiene, medical conditions and medications, and mental health status (Aps & Martens, 2005; Bhattarai et al., 2018) may be associated with differences in one or more of viscosity, pH, concentrations of different proteins, and saliva flow rate. However, it is not known if these factors affect or are associated with the concentration and composition of saliva EVs, so additional studies are needed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nReport the source of saliva clearly (whole or from a specific gland), the method used for collection, and any stimulus used.\n\nStandardise allowed food and drink intake prior to collection or, at minimum, assess these factors at collection.\n\n3.8. Synovial fluid\n\nSynovial fluid (SF) is a viscous fluid within the spaces of joints. SF EVs have potential as biomarkers and therapeutic agents for joint disorders (Boere et al., 2019) since SF is in direct contact with affected tissues (Michael et al., 2019). The viscosity of SF is due to large amounts of protein and the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA). This viscosity poses several hurdles to reproducible SF EV studies, for example, making it challenging to pellet cells/debris prior to freezing and hampering EV recovery. Indeed, most reported samples have been frozen and thawed before EV separation and characterisation, with inconsistent pre‐freezing removal of cells and debris (Gao et al., 2020; Rüwald et al., 2020). Hyaluronidase treatment of SF is required for accurate detection of inflammatory cells and soluble mediators (Boere et al., 2019). Most research groups use hyaluronidase to decrease SF viscosity before EV separation, but others do not (Mustonen et al., 2021). SEC may outperform UC in removal of proteins such as albumin, fibronectin and apolipoprotein A‐I (Foers et al., 2018). Donor characteristics that may associate with differences in SF variables and possibly EVs include biological sex (Kolhe et al., 2020) and disease identity and stage (Foers et al., 2020; Schioppo et al., 2021).\n\nRecommendations:\n\nConsider the use of hyaluronidase to reduce viscosity and obtain homogenised synovial fluid before EV separation and characterisation.\n\n3.9. Milk\n\nMilk is a rich and complex source of nutritional and immunological components, which include cells, milk fat globules (MFGs), casein micelles, soluble molecules and EVs (Ballard & Morrow, 2013). EVs separated from milk of at least 16 different species have thus far been reported, chiefly human and bovine. To allow separation of relatively pure EVs, milk components that share EV characteristics such as density and size [MFGs and cellular debris (Busatto et al., 2019)] should be removed, for example, by centrifugation), and milk should be kept at body temperature for short‐term storage (Zonneveld et al., 2014). Casein micelles, which overlap in size with EVs, are the biggest challenge, especially for milk of ruminant species. Casein micelles can be precipitated by pelleting after acidifying milk to pH 4.6 (Mukhopadhya, Santoro, Moran, et al., 2021; Rahman et al., 2019; Santoro et al., 2023; Somiya et al., 2018), aggregated by enzymatic treatment (Gao et al., 2019), or dissociated by sequestering calcium with EDTA (Gao et al., 2019) or sodium citrate (Benmoussa et al., 2020). Currently, there is no preferred method, but acidification and EDTA are used most often. Following pre‐processing, cleared milk supernatant can be stored until EV separation. Methods such as UC, dgUC and SEC may be combined for higher purity, since single‐step approaches will yield a low purity. Colloidal properties and acceptable storage times until processing may be different for raw, homogenised, pasteurised, ultra‐high temperature‐treated, and dried/powdered milk (Mukhopadhya, Santoro, & O'Driscoll, 2021). Furthermore, the effects of storage length and temperatures have yet to be comprehensively determined.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nKeep milk at body temperature for short‐term storage prior to storage or EV separation.\n\nCommon EV co‐isolates include cells/components, milk fat globules, and casein micelles. These should be removed (and/or, in the case of micelles, disrupted), and their presence tracked through the EV separation process.\n\n3.10. Solid tissue\n\nCell‐EV interactions in solid tissues may primarily involve EVs that are released near the site of action. It is thus important to study EVs in tissue. However, greatly complicating the study of tissue EVs is the interrelated diversity of tissue harvesting and storage methods, cellular and extracellular matrix composition, and physical properties. Despite these challenges, two basic approaches to tissue EV studies have been developed and applied mostly to brain or tumor tissues.\n\nTissues can be used for EV studies by keeping tissues/cells ‘alive’ in culture after harvesting or by harvesting EVs directly from tissue before or after storage. Some tissues can be cultured ex vivo over several days and culture medium harvested for EV separation (Lunavat et al., 2017; Jeurissen et al., 2017; Jingushi et al., 2018). EV preparations may include tissue EVs present in the original tissue, EVs released during culture (perhaps with different properties from the native EVs), and products of cell death in culture like apoptotic bodies (Carrel & Burrows, 1911). Keeping tissue under conditions as close to their in situ environment as possible may be very important, such as maintaining tissue hydrated prior to culturing and avoiding high oxygen concentrations, although limited evidence has been gathered for the influence of these factors on collected EVs. Alternatively, tissue is processed immediately after resection (Cianciaruso et al., 2019; Crescitelli et al., 2020; Crescitelli et al., 2021; Gallart‐Palau et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2020; Jang et al., 2019; Jeppesen et al., 2019; Perez‐Gonzalez et al., 2012; Steenbeek et al., 2018) or after prior storage, usually freezing (Hurwitz et al., 2018; Hurwitz et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2020; Perez‐Gonzalez et al., 2012; Vella et al., 2017; Yelamanchili et al., 2015). A preliminary study found no major differences in EV composition in fresh versus frozen tissues (Shen et al., 2023). Tissues are typically divided into small pieces [using tissue homogenizers (Gallart‐Palau et al., 2016; Hurwitz et al., 2018; Hurwitz et al., 2019; Yelamanchili et al., 2015), vortexing (Banigan et al., 2013) or slicing (Huang et al., 2020; Jeppesen et al., 2019; Polanco et al., 2016; Vella et al., 2017)], followed by enzymatic treatment to disrupt the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Jingushi et al., 2018). These methods result in different degrees of cell damage, potentially introducing EV‐like artefacts.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nFor ex vivo culturing approaches, keep the tissue as close as possible to its ‘native’ conditions, including maintaining hydration and nutrition. Consider also the influence of cell death processes on the EV preparation.\n\nFor separating EVs directly from tissue (without ex vivo culturing), establish or follow best practices for the specific tissue in harvesting (e.g., perfusion or not of an animal model to minimise effects of blood); storage (does freezing affect outcome?); physical and enzymatic tissue separation (if done) and influence of specific EV separation/concentration methods.\n\nTissue EV characterisation should focus in particular on tracing the presence of cellular components that may be expected to be depleted in EVs, since cells and cellular artefacts may be the key contaminants of tissue EV preparations.\n\n3.11. Other sources\n\nNot all sources of EVs are covered above; only those for which ISEV recently had or currently has a Task Force. ISEV members are welcome to propose formation of new task forces where no ISEV task force yet exists. These, in turn, may help to inform best practice.\n\n3.12. Pre‐separation and post‐separation storage\n\nStorage conditions of both pre‐separation sources and post‐separation EVs may also affect EV yields, contents, functionality, and the ratio of single particles and aggregates. For most EV sources, pre‐processing is advisable prior to pre‐separation storage to remove potentially interfering entities such as cells. However, stringent pre‐processing is not always possible. Details of whatever steps are performed should be reported, and an explanation given if pre‐processing cannot be done. Acceptable storage prior to EV separation varies by source. Storage conditions, including any additives [e.g., bactericidal agents (Lucas et al., 2021)], should be fully reported and the influence on EV quantity and quality investigated if not already known.\n\nFollowing separation of EVs, EVs should be studied in as native a form as possible. However, for most studies, stored EVs are used. Here, several considerations apply. All storage vessels and their materials should be reported, as EVs can be lost by attaching to surfaces (Evtushenko et al., 2020). Separated EVs may be stable without freezing for some time, but this may vary by EV composition and source and of course information on storage of EVs from some matrices is more comprehensive to date compared to information on EVs from other matrices. Long‐term storage is typically at −80°C, although other temperatures have been examined. For example, saliva EVs were reportedly stable at 4°C for up to 20 months, retaining membrane integrity and protein content (Kumeda et al., 2017). Urinary EVs have reportedly been stored at −20°C for up to four years (Barreiro et al., 2021). Lyophilisation of EVs is also possible (Trenkenschuh et al., 2022). There is conflicting evidence on the effects of freeze‐thaw cycles on EV properties. A study of saliva EVs found minimal effects of freeze‐thawing on membrane integrity (defined as dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity) (Kumeda et al., 2017). However, studies of various sources of EVs have reported particle concentration and other changes with freeze‐thawing (Gelibter et al., 2022; Görgens et al., 2022). Cryoprotectants may reduce effects of freeze‐thaw (Le Saux et al., 2020; Lőrincz Á et al., 2014); for example, supplementing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with human albumin and trehalose (PBS‐HAT) reportedly improved short‐ and long‐term stability for EVs stored at −80°C and through several freeze‐thaw cycles (Görgens et al., 2022). Since optimal storage conditions may vary by EV composition and source, the freezing method (e.g., snap‐freezing in liquid nitrogen, gradual freezing), suspension buffer (including cryoprotectants and other additives), temperature, duration of storage until use, thawing method (speed, temperature) and number of freeze‐thaw cycles should be reported. Freeze‐thaw cycles should be minimised, for example, by a careful aliquoting strategy, and samples with different numbers of freeze cycles may not be directly comparable.\n\nConsensus: 70.4% (703) of MISEV2023 survey respondents agreed “completely,” and 28.5% (284) agreed “mostly” with Section 3: Collection and pre‐processing: pre‐analytical variables through to storage. 0.1% (1) “mostly” disagreed, and 1.0% (10) stated that they had no opinion and/or expertise. No respondents disagreed “completely.”\n\n4. EV SEPARATION AND CONCENTRATION\n\nEVs are typically characterised and used after one or more separation or concentration procedures. Trends in these approaches have been previously assessed by ISEV (Gardiner et al., 2016; Royo et al., 2020). Separation/concentration can be performed according to the EV biophysical characteristics of size, density, charge and surface composition (specific surface molecules). Other terms that are sometimes used for these procedures include ‘enrichment’, ‘purification’ and ‘isolation’. The material captured after separation/concentration is an ‘EV‐containing preparation’ or ‘EV preparation’ that may require storage prior to analysis or use. Any separation method should be chosen based on the known properties of the specific EV sources and the desired EV yield and specificity. When separating complex biofluids, quantification of yield and specificity for total EVs will likely be estimates, since particle number quantification is not always EV‐specific and/or typically relies on surrogates of EV abundance such as spike‐in populations or measurement of detectable subpopulations. Figure shows the position of some commonly used methods for EV preparation on a yield (recovery) versus specificity grid. This section provides information and suggestions on some of these methods. More detailed information can be found in the literature (Hendrix et al., 2023).\n\nEVs can sometimes be studied or used directly and immediately in the source matrix. In biomarker studies, for example, there may be no need to separate or concentrate EVs from a biological matrix if sufficient specificity and sensitivity are reached with the unfractionated sample. In some cases, EVs can also be analysed specifically and directly in a biological fluid (Duijvesz et al., 2015; Woud et al., 2022). However, to show exclusive EV association of a proposed biomarker or function, separation may be required in the first instance, and further guidance on this is provided here.\n\n4.1. EV concentration\n\nConcentration in EV studies is the act of increasing the particle number:sample volume ratio. Concentration may be needed in various settings. Large volumes of source materials like CCM, urine, milk may require concentration before EVs can be separated from other EPs. For example, chromatography columns may have a maximum loading volume, while some separation methods may be more efficient if material is first concentrated (e.g., some immunoisolation procedures). Concentration methods may, but do not necessarily, also achieve some degree of separation of particle types.\n\nConcentration can be done by several approaches. Polymer‐based methods of precipitation reduce the availability of biomolecules to solvent, ‘crowding out’ water molecules. This allows suspended/dissolved materials including EPs to be pelleted by low‐speed centrifugation. Some commercial kits that are described as ‘exosome isolation’ kits in fact rely on such polymer precipitation and do not strictly ‘isolate’ EVs, much less subtypes of EVs. Precipitation methods may not achieve any appreciable separation of EPs (Gámez‐Valero et al., 2016; Karttunen et al., 2019; Lobb et al., 2015; Paolini et al., 2016).\n\nIn filtration, a suspension passes through a filter by, for example, gravity, centrifugation or vacuum: water and molecules smaller than the molecular weight cut‐off of the filter pass through, while EPs larger than the cut‐off are recovered in the concentrated fluid compartment of the filter. A variety of filter cut‐offs are available, including 3, 10, 100 and 1000 kDa, allowing filtration to achieve some degree of size separation, not just concentration. A cut‐off of 100 kDa retains EVs while removing many proteins, while a cut‐off of 1000 kDa may allow passage of some smaller EVs. However, another consideration is recovery, since different filters/tubes may allow different levels of EV ‘sticking’ and thus recovery (Vergauwen et al., 2017). Please note that filtration may also be performed to retain microbes (‘sterilization’) or large EVs/EPs in the pre‐filter compartment; although care should be taken to avoid extrusion. Tangential flow filtration (TFF, also called cross‐flow filtration) is a filter‐based concentration method in which liquid and molecules smaller than the pores pass through the filter perpendicularly to the flow applied to the EV‐containing fluid. This allows continuous flow and repeated passages of the fluid unless and until the filter is clogged, and thus allows processing of large volumes of fluid. As for other filtration methods, size‐based separation can be achieved based on the molecular weight cut‐off of the filter. TFF has been successfully and reproducibly used for large‐scale EV production, for example, for therapeutic applications (Busatto et al., 2018; Lamparski et al., 2002). Finally, concentration can also be obtained by (ultra)centrifugation, for which parameters are described in the next section.\n\nSummary: Concentration\n\nCan be done by polymer‐based precipitation, filtration including tangential flow filtration, and (ultra)centrifugation.\n\nLeads to EV‐containing preparations containing variable amounts of NVEPs and proteins, depending on the exact method and variables such as filter cut‐off (size or molecular weight).\n\nReporting recommendations: for concentration, report the following:\n\nnature of the material used for concentration;\n\ninitial and final volumes of biofluid;\n\ntime of processing (incubation with polymer, centrifugation through filters or directly);\n\nflow rate (for TFF);\n\nsize or molecular weight cut‐off (for filtration/concentration);\n\ntemperature during concentration.\n\n4.2. Differential (ultra)centrifugation\n\nThe principle of differential ultracentrifugation (dUC) is to apply increasing relative centrifugal forces (RCF = g‐force) to the EV‐containing fluid, from which intact donor cells or tissues have first been eliminated by one or more low speed centrifugations. The aim is to pellet sequentially EPs of decreasing sedimentation coefficients. Since the sedimentation velocity of a sphere is proportional to its diameter squared and to the density contrast between the particle and the medium (Stokes’ law equation), the largest and/or densest EPs tend to be pelleted in the first (medium speed/short time) steps, while the smallest and/or least dense are recovered predominantly after higher speed/longer centrifugation. However, in practice, perfect EV separations are not achieved by this method, and pellets from different centrifugation speed have overlapping properties and variable biochemical and physical parameters.\n\nWhatever the centrifugation steps used, as detailed in MISEV2018, report speed in rpm and rotor type (to allow calculation of adjusted k‐factor), time of centrifugation (to allow calculation of the sedimentation coefficient of the pelleted particles), and temperature. Instrument acceleration and deceleration settings should also be reported. In typical dUC workflows reported in the literature, a maximal force of around 10,000 to 20,000 × g is applied for between 10 and 90 min to enrich putatively larger/denser EVs, while a maximal force of around 100,000 to 200,000 × g is applied for 45 to 150 min to pellet putatively smaller/lighter EVs. These figures can be used to calculate the sedimentation coefficient (S) of the particles recovered by these different protocols: S = adjusted K factor of the rotor/Time of centrifugation. Theoretically, particles with S coefficients in the range of 15–150 are recovered by the ‘larger EV’ centrifugation conditions, and those in the range of 2 to 5 by the ‘smaller EV’ conditions. Particles with smaller S can be recovered by extending the speed and time of centrifugation, at the cost of increasing NVEP/free protein co‐isolation. Depending on the centrifugation parameters, the resulting pellets may be enriched for large/dense or for small/light EVs, but complete separation of these populations is not achieved. Yield of smaller EVs may also be low, especially when suspended in protein‐rich fluids such as blood products and complex culture medium components, and this problem may not be resolved by simply increasing centrifugation time or speed (Driedonks et al., 2019; Zhang, Borg, et al., 2020). Examples of dUC protocols (with or without density gradient, see next section) and downstream comparison of EVs include (Jeppesen et al., 2019; Kowal et al., 2016; Lischnig et al., 2022; Martin‐Jaular et al., 2021).\n\nThe majority of published studies have focused on smaller EVs and thus discard and/or do not analyse the pellet(s) obtained with lower‐speed centrifugation. To allow comparison between studies and to avoid pelleting larger particles and potentially introducing artefacts, however, it is recommended to perform these first centrifugations. The strong g‐force of high‐speed UC has also been shown to induce aggregation of EVs (Linares et al., 2015), but this may not be observed for all sources of EVs. When analysing a new source of EVs, retain the intermediate centrifugation pellets and analyse them side‐by‐side at least once with the final, highest‐speed pellet to determine whether the molecules or activity of interest are specifically enriched in small EVs or are also present in other subtypes.\n\nSummary: dUC\n\nEnriches for EV subtypes that are separated according to their sedimentation coefficient, proportional to their diameter and density.\n\nCo‐isolates NVEPs that have the same sedimentation coefficient as EVs, especially after high‐speed and lengthy ultracentrifugation.\n\nMay induce aggregation of EVs.\n\nReporting recommendations: for differential (ultra)centrifugation, report the following:\n\nspeed, rotor type, and time of centrifugation, to allow calculation of the adjusted k‐factor (to apply to other rotors) and the sedimentation coefficient of the pelleted EPs;\n\ntube type and sample volume in the tube;\n\ntemperature during centrifugation;\n\nacceleration and deceleration (brake) settings.\n\n4.3. Density gradient/cushion\n\nDensity gradients or cushions can be used to separate certain NVEPs and proteins from EVs based on the characteristic densities of different classes of EPs (Raposo et al., 1996). Gradients are prepared of layers consisting of different ratios of a selected dense medium (like sucrose, iodixanol or iohexol) and aqueous buffers, with density decreasing from bottom to top of the gradient, whereas cushions consist of a homogeneous layer of dense material below an aqueous column. EV‐containing materials can be loaded beneath a gradient (‘bottom‐up’) or onto the top of a gradient or cushion (‘top‐down’) and then ultracentrifuged. In the bottom‐up approach, the EV‐containing preparation is mixed with high‐density medium, loaded at the bottom of a centrifuge tube, and overlayed with layers of decreasing density; the preparation may also be underlaid under a prepared gradient. As ultracentrifugation proceeds, particles that are less dense than the surrounding medium float upwards. With sufficient time, particles will ultimately reach a density fraction corresponding to their buoyant density. Since smaller EVs travel at a relatively slower rate than larger EVs, especially in viscous media, the bottom‐up approach in velocity sucrose density gradient UC can also be used to separate EVs according to size (Aalberts et al., 2012). In top‐down settings, the EV‐containing preparation in a low‐density medium is loaded onto the top of a gradient or cushion: for gradients, particles travel into the gradient at a rate corresponding to their density and size until their equilibrium buoyant density is reached; for cushions, particles that reach the cushion remain at the interface if less dense than the cushion material but continue into and through the cushion if they are denser. The cushion approach is thus easier to implement but separates EPs by a threshold of density. Importantly, for gradients, lengthy ultracentrifugation may be needed for optimal separation [e.g., longer than 48 h (Aalberts et al., 2012; Palma et al., 2012)], but shorter spins may suffice for some applications [e.g., 1–2 h (Kowal et al., 2016), 16 h (Aalberts et al., 2012; Liao et al., 2019)].\n\nFollowing separation by gradient, fractions must be collected carefully to avoid disrupting the gradient. It is good practice to confirm density of final fractions, for example, by weighing given volumes or measuring refractive index. B"
