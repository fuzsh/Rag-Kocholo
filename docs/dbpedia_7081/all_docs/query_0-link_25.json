        "text": "Steven A. Davidow, president of Davidow, Inc., makers of women's suits, dresses, coats and sportswear, was killed in an automobile accident Monday evening on the Hutchinson River Parkway. Mr. Davidow, who was 33 years old, was driving to his home, 15 Oak Crest, Darien, Conn.\n\nMr. Davidow became president of the company in 1970 Wowing the death of his father, Archibald Davidow. The son had taken the lead in bringing a more youthful approabh to a company long known for its conservative classic lines adhering to Chanel designs. It was founded on Bleecker Street by William Davidow, Mr. Davidow's grandfather, in 1880.\n\nBorn in New York, he grew up in Rye and prepared at the Salisbury School in Salisbury, Conn, for Duke University. He transferred to Hobart College, where he played on the football team.\n\nAfter graduating in 1961, he was in the Marine Corps and then worked for the I. Magnin stores on the West Coast.\n\nIn 1964 he returned to New York and learned about the manufacturing side of the drygoods business from his father, and uncle, Melville. In association with his brother‐in‐law, John L. MacDougall, and Allen L. Schwartzman, all three of whom were made vice, presidents a few years ago, he changed the image of a house known as one of the most conservative on Seventh Avenue.\n\n“Nobody wants to dress like a grandmother any more,” he told an interviewer in 1968. He explained that they were trying to “lower the voting age” of women who wore Davidow clothes. The tweeds and dressmaker suits gave ground to knitwear, cottons and synthetics in more exciting colors.\n\nThe expansion included new division, MacDougall Ltd., preparing to offer this fall broad range of clothes for younger women at prices lower than the regular Davidow line.\n\nAn active sportsman, Mr. Davidow had returned last week from skiing in Zermatt, Switzerland.\n\nSurviving are his widow, the former Judith Shaw of New Orleans; a son, Steven Lawrence, and a sister, Mrs. Anne MacDougall.\n\nThe funeral will be at Frank E. Campbell's, Madison Avenue at 81st Street, tomorrow at 1 P.M."
