Unless there is indication to the contrary, titles and positions given are those held in or for the United States Government. Authors and journalists are not included in this list unless they are mentioned in the papers printed in some other capacity.\n\nPersons whose names are preceded by an asterisk were present at Berlin or Babelsberg at some time during the course of the Berlin Conference.\n\nIn this list, names with diacritical marks (e. g., š) are alphabetized as if they were English names with no diacritical marks, rather than in the position which they would occupy if alphabetized in their original language. Likewise transliterations (e. g., Zh for the Russian ж) are alphabetized in English letter order."
