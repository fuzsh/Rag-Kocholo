        "text": "On this Page 2\n\nMR. ARCHIBALD MACDOUGALL\n\nAND MR. JOHN STEPHENS.\n\nIN our issue of Saturday last, our readers\n\nmay remember to have met with the fol-\n\nlowing pointed disclaimer of certain impu-\n\ntations on the character and conduct of\n\nMr. Archibald Macdougall:—\n\nIn reference to a paragraph which appeared in\n\nthis journal on the 5th April last, and which was\n\ncalculated to be highly injurious to the reputation\n\nof Mr. Archibald Macdougall we respectfully state,\n\nat Mr Macdoualls request, that that paragraph\n\nwas neither written by ourselves, nor the objec-\n\ntionable parts of it inserted with our concurrence, but\n\ncontrary to express written instructions at our\n\ndictation, we ourselves being confined to bed at\n\nthe time, and, consequently, unable personally\n\nto superintend the affairs of the printing-office.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have no objection to\n\nstate, that the obnoxious portions of this paragraph,\n\namid the whole and entire paragraph, which ap-\n\npearcd in this journal on the 15th of April, have\n\never been repudiated by us as grossly unjust to\n\nMr Macdougall, and that the insertion of them\n\nnever occasioned any one greater pain than\n\nourselves.\n\nThe history of the insertion of the\n\nabove is a little curious, but may soon be\n\ntold.\n\nAt the late sitting of the Supreme Court,\n\nMr Macdougall was about to send in a bill\n\nto the Grand Jury, charging us with libel\n\nin April last, and we ourselves were about\n\nto send in a cross bill against Mr Mac-\n\ndougall, charging him with a like offence\n\nat or about the same time, when, at the\n\nsuggestion of Mr J. H. Fisher, Mr Mac-\n\ndougall's counsel, it was agreed that the\n\nmatter should be amicably arranged, we\n\nourselves proffering the insertion of the\n\nabove paragraph, and Mr Macdougall, both\n\npersonally and by his counsel, intimating\n\nhis readiness, in consideration of its ap-\n\npearance, to insert a similar paragraph in\n\nreference to our grounds for action, or, in\n\nfact, having recourse to the precise words\n\nused on the occasion—\" To do whatever we\n\nwished.\"\n\nInstead of coming forward, however, in\n\nthe bold, frank, and open manner, in which\n\nit was understood to have been arranged\n\nin court, judge of our surprise, on Tues-\n\nday last, at finding the following notice of\n\nthe affair in the Southern Australian :—\n\nOur readers may remember that in April last,\n\nseveral libellous articles appeared in the Register\n\naffecting the character of Mr Archibald Mac-\n\ndougall, then publisher of this journal. The\n\nlibels were of so gross a nature that Mr Mac-\n\ndougall was advised at once to place the matter\n\nin the hands of the Advocate General, which he\n\naccordingly did, and the case was to have been\n\ntried at the last Sessions. Just as it was to have\n\ncome on, however, Mr Allen came forward in\n\nCourt and gave Mr Macdougall the subjoined\n\nexplanation and apology. (See paragraph pub-\n\nlished above.)\n\nOf course by this Mr Allen shifted the onus of\n\nthe affair from his own shoulders to those of Mr\n\nJohn Stephens, at that time joint Editor of the\n\nRegister. Upon this apology bring published in\n\nthe Register, however, on Saturday last, Mr John\n\nStephens called at our office, and produced a letter\n\nfrom Mr Allen to him, justifying him in writing the\n\nparagraphs alluded to, and even requesting him to\n\nchange some of the expressions to make them more\n\nplain and decided against Mr Macdougall. Mr\n\nAllen also called to state that Mr Stephens was\n\nincorrect in this interpretation of his letter, and\n\nhas placed in Mr Macdougall's hands the original\n\nmanuscript articles, to shew that none of the ob-\n\njectionable parts were written by him. Mr Ste-\n\npliens was applied to, to furnish a copy of that\n\nletter, and promised to give one to Mr Mac-\n\ndougall. In the meantime Mr Macdougall, to\n\nwhom we have spoken, is inclined to allow the\n\nmatter as it stands to go before the public,\n\nleaving it to Messrs Allen and Stephens to ex-\n\npain this extraordinary business as they best can.\n\nAt present we avoid comment.\n\nOn the immediate receipt of the above,\n\nwe waited upon Mr Macdougall, and called\n\nhis attention to the words marked in italics\n\nas uusustained by evidence, reminding\n\nhim, at the same time, of what we con-\n\nsidered a violation of the compact entered\n\ninto in court, and leaving him with the\n\nintention of referring the matter to Mr\n\nFisher, at whose instance the arrangement\n\nhad been effected.\n\nMr Fisher, it is but just to ourselves to\n\nsay, admits the correctness of the language\n\nimputed to the parties concerned in this\n\narrangement, namely, that on the insertion\n\nof the foregoing paragraph, \" they were\n\nready to do whatever we wished,\" and\n\nfurther states, that it shall be done even\n\nnow if we desire it.\n\nWhether we ought, or ought not, to\n\ndesire it, our readers will best judge, first\n\nfrom a paragraph, and next from a letter,\n\nwhich appeared in yesterday's Southern\n\nAustralian. The paragraph is as fol-\n\nlows :—.\n\nWe beg to refer our readers to a correspondence\n\nin another column, relative to Mr Allen's apology\n\nfor the disgraceful libels upon Mr Macdougall.\n\nAs the correspondence speaks tor itself, we only\n\nremark at present that it places Messrs Allen and\n\nStephens in a most unenviable possession. While\n\nwe insert Mr Stephens's \" explanatory letter,\" we\n\nthink it necessary to state our opinion, that as\n\nrespects his own part in the affair, it is anything\n\nbut satisfactory. It remains to be seen what\n\nexplanation Mr Allen can give of his very curious\n\nletter of instructions.\n\nThe letter is signed \" A. Macdougall,\"\n\nand is of a like spirit with the above :—\n\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE SOUTHERN AUSTRALIAN\n\nSir—I feel it due to myself to trespass a little\n\non your space to-day, in order to lay before the\n\npublic the following correspondence. From the\n\ninformation you gave your readers in your last\n\nissue, it will he unnecessary for me to trouble\n\nthem with a history of the matter to which the\n\ncorrespondence refers. It is sufficient notorious\n\nthat my private character was grossly attacked in\n\nthr Register—that I have been injured thereby—\n\nthat I look legal proceedings against the proprie.-\n\ntor ol the Register in consequence and that upon\n\nhis apologizing I withdrew those proceedings,\n\nalthough his apology was only given at the\n\neleventh hour.\n\nAs I have accepted the apology from Mr Allen,\n\nI shall not trouble myself with remarking upon\n\nthe matter at issue between him and Mr John\n\nStephens, simply observing, that justification of\n\ntheir conduct is impossible for either of them.\n\nThe public will, however, be able to judge, not\n\nonly of their conduct towards me, but as to what\n\nreliance can be placed in them in future,\n\nI am, &c,\n\nA. MACDOUGALL\n\nP.S.—Mr Stephens is in error when he accuses\n\nMr Allen of giving him up as the author. Mr\n\nS. gave himself up when he called of his own ac-\n\ncord at the office of the Southern Anstralian, and\n\nshowed Mr Blackham Mr Allen's note, which he\n\nconsidered authorized him in writing the libels.\n\nExposed thus to the cross-fire of these\n\ntwo doughty champions in their own\n\ncause, instead of being met by Mr Mac-\n\ndougall with a mutual apology, and of\n\nwhich an example had been set by our-\n\nselves, in accordance with the terms of\n\nagreement in Court, we shall first dispose\n\nof the affair as far as it regards Mr Archi-\n\nbald Macdougall, and next as it relates to\n\nMr John Stephens.\n\nAnd first, as it respects the insertion of\n\nthe \" objectionable parts\" of the para-\n\ngraph of April the 5th, \" without our\n\nconcurrence,\" and \" contrary to express\n\nwritten instructions at our dictation,\" we\n\nare no longer left relying upon mere\n\nassertion, but can appeal to documentary\n\nevidence. In Mr Macdougall's \"Infor-\n\nmation\" against this journal on the 22nd\n\nof April last, and the whole of which is\n\npublished at the close of this article, we\n\nhave the following as the ground of the\n\ncomplaint:—\n\nThat James Allen, of Adelaide aforesaid,\n\nprinter, did on the fifth day of this instant April,\n\nat Adelaide aforesaid, unlawfully, wickedly, and\n\nmaliciously compose, print, and publish,\n\nand cause to be composed, printed, and\n\npublished in a certain publication called the\n\nSouth Australian Register, whereof the said James\n\nAllen is printer, publisher, and proprietor, of and\n\nconcerning the said Archibald Macdougall, a cer-\n\ntain false, scandalous, malicious, and defamatory\n\nlibel, containing among other things in one part\n\nthereof the false, scandalous, malicious, and de-\n\nfamatory words following, that is to say - \" There\n\nare some men who are not to be believed on their oaths,\n\nand others whose word is as little to be relied on\n\nwhen it may chance to clash with their self-in-\n\nterest, one of these is Archibald Macdougall,\n\nprinter and proprietor of the Southern Australian\n\n—meaning this complainant, the said Archibald\n\nMacdougall, who is in fact printer and proprie-\n\ntor of a public newspaper called the Southern\n\nAustralian, and containing in another part thereof\n\nthe false, scandalous, and malicious words, that is\n\nto say—\" But if like others of his fraternity,\" mean-\n\ning this complainant the said Archibald Mac-\n\ndougall—\"will not cheat\"— \" he,\" meaning this\n\ncomplainant the said Archibald Macdougall—\n\n\" can lie as fast as a dog can trot.\"\n\nAt the time the article complained of\n\nwas written, we were confined to a sick\n\nbed, and, consequently, unable to write,\n\nbut on its being sent to us for approval,\n\nit was returned, accompanied with a note,\n\nof which the following is a copy :—\n\nDear Sir—I shall be obliged by your substitut-\n\ning—\" There are some men, whose word, it seems,\n\nis but little to be depended upon, when it clashes\n\nwith their (interests)—or some such words, in\n\nplace of \"men who are not to be believed on their\n\noaths.\"\n\nI should also like you (to) throw out the sen-\n\ntence—\" This Simon Pure \"can lie as fast at a dog\n\ncan trot,\" &c—on the third folio.\n\nOn the 4th folio—\" This perjured man\" is a\n\nphrase on the first line which might be altered\n\nfor \" Mr Macdougall\" without weakening the force\n\nof the passage; and besides, it would be actionable\n\nin its present form, the allegation being that Mr\n\nMacD. had not been put upon his oath, and con-\n\nsequently could not have perjured himself.\n\nConsidering the relation in which the\n\nwriter of that article stood to us at the\n\ntime, could we have said more without a\n\nbreach of decorum, and ought it not to\n\nhave occasioned us surprise on the follow-\n\ning day to find that our instructions had\n\nnot been complied with ? What amuses\n\nus, however, is, that Mr Macdougall, or\n\nany other man possessed of a particle of\n\nright feeling, should strain this, after the\n\nmanner in which it was done in the\n\nSouthern Australian of Tuesday last,\n\ninto a \"justification\" of the insertion of\n\nthe \"objectionable parts\" of the article\n\ncomplained of, much less that any man\n\nshould assert that the expressions were\n\nchanged at our request, \" to make them\n\nmore plain and decided against Mr Mac-\n\ndougall.\" Why, not a single part of our\n\ninstructions was complied with, all the\n\noffensive expressions being retained, with\n\nthe exception of \" this perjured man\"\n\nwhich was changed, not as we desired it,\n\ninto \" Mr Macdougall,\" and which would\n\nin effect have been an infinitely milder\n\nmode of proceeding, but into \" this fast\n\nand-loosc, this black-and-white, this\n\nindia-rubber-conscienced man.\" Had Mr\n\nMacdougall been similarly circumstanced\n\nwith ourselves, we should like to know in\n\nwhat way he would have acted, and whe-\n\nther, in the event of his having given such\n\ninstructions as the above, he would have\n\nconsidered it fair, after those instructions\n\nhad been disobeyed by his \"paid as-\n\nsistant,\" to have had them alleged against\n\nhim as a \"justification\" of the offence\n\nagainst the commission of which they were\n\nintended to guard? Of course, any former\n\nadmission of ours was confined to the\n\noffensive expressions of which Mr Mac-\n\ndougall complained in his \"Information,\"\n\nand not to the facts alleged in the\n\narticle, these having been primarily\n\nstated on the authority of the writer of\n\nthe article, and the proof or disproof of\n\nthem still resting, as at the first, princi\n\npally between Mr Macdougall and the\n\nwriter himself.\n\nOf Mr John Stephens we have little to\n\nsay that is creditable, and we shall there-\n\nfore, confine ourselves to the close of his\n\nletter, which contains the gist of all he\n\nhas to advance :—\n\nFor an editor or proprietor of a newspaper, says\n\nMr Stephens, to give up the name of an accre-\n\ndited correspondent, that he may be proceeded\n\nagainst at law, to screen himselt or his journal\n\nagainst the consequences of an accepted communi-\n\ncation, is base enough; but for one editor to be-\n\ntray another, or for a newspaper proprietor to im-\n\nplicate his paid assistant, under any circumstances,\n\nbut especially to avoid the penalties of inaction\n\nwhich he himself provoked, is a breach of pro-\n\nfessional honour and usage.\n\nThis is modesty with a vengeance!\n\nMr John Stephens talking about a breach\n\nof \"professional honour and usage\"! The\n\nman above all others in the Colony least\n\nto be trusted with another's private senti-\n\nments, to talk of \" one editor betraying\n\nanother\" ! The man who, under the pre-\n\ntence of a partnership, but without a shil-\n\nling in his pocket, possessed himself of a\n\nknowledge of our most private affairs, and\n\nthen went and misrepresented them to\n\nothers, complaining of our not throwing\n\naround him the veil of secrecy! The\n\nman, who sat at our table, and rose from\n\nit to join a friend in our garden, and speak\n\nto our prejudice, and afterwards, for his\n\nown private purposes, carried his stories\n\nto places in which they were most likely\n\nto injure us, bellowing about \" turpitude\n\nand treachery, and inconsistency, and\n\nfalsehood\"! Out upon such arrant hypo-\n\ncrisy, such a flagrant violation of all that\n\nis due to the dignity of manhood! Pace\n\nthe streets of Adelaide—take the city in its\n\nwhole length and breadth—and, although\n\nMr John Stephens has scarcely graced it\n\nwith his presence for a period of six\n\nmouths—ask whether the seal of silence\n\nis not imposed upon the lips of every\n\nperson into whose presence he may chance\n\nto intrude himself, lest, being thrown off\n\nYours, &c.,\n\nJAMES ALLEN.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour humble obedient Servant,\n\nJAMES ALLEN.\n\nCharles Davies, Esq., M.D.,\n\nNorth Adelaide.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nC. DAVIES, M.D.\n\nMr James Allen,\n\nNorth Adelaide.\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully.\n\nJAMES ALLEN.\n\nMr. Wm. Kyffin Thomas,\n\nOverseer of Register Office.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYour most obedient Servant,\n\nWM. KYFFIN THOMAS.\n\nJames Allen, Esq.,\n\nNorth Adelaide.\n\nYours, faithfully,\n\nJ. ALLIN.\n\nMr W. Williams, Register Office.\n\nDear Sir, yours truly,\n\nW. WILLIAMS.\n\nJames Allen, Esq.\n\ntheir guard, they should be betrayed into an\n\ninnocent expression of opinion, which may\n\nafterwards be carried to those for whose ears\n\nit was never intended, and be twisted and\n\ndistorted to their disadvantage ? We have\n\nno wish to be more particular at present, or\n\nwe could resent this grossly unjust attack\n\nupon ourselves with a severity which Mr\n\nJohn Stephens would not soon forget.\n\nLet it not be supposed, however, that we\n\nseek to evade Mr John Stephens's charge,\n\nunder the cover of a series of vague gene-\n\nralities, instead of meeting him foot to foot.\n\nWhen Mr John Stephens charges us with\n\nhaving given up his name, that he \" might\n\nbe proceeded against at law,\" he is guilty of\n\na gross and malicious falsehood, an applica-\n\ntion to that effect having been made to us in\n\nCourt, and refused, and an understanding,\n\nmoreover, having been entered into, that, in\n\nthe event of the proposed mutual apology,\n\nthere should be an end of all legal proceed-\n\nings whatever in the case. Mr Macdougall,\n\nhowever, has certified in his letter, that Mr\n\nStephens's name was never breathed to the\n\nparties, until he had first gone and avowed\n\nhimself as the author, but pleaded in \"justi-\n\nfication\" the contents of our letter forbid-\n\nding the insertion of the libellous and ob-\n\njectionable matter.\n\nBut can Mr John Stephens—this paragon\n\nof \" professional honour\"—this personifica-\n\ntion of \"professional usage\"—this embody-\n\nment of editorial propriety—say as much for\n\nhimself ? Are his hands clean in the matter ?\n\nCan he plead exemption from the \" turpi-\n\ntude\" of the betrayal of a brother editor ?\n\nHow came it to pass that, three weeks\n\nbefore these proceedings took place in Court,\n\nMr John Stephens was found at Mr Mac-\n\ndougall's counter, pledging himself that\" he\n\nwould rather have had his right hand cut off,\n\nthan have been the author of certain articles\n\nin this journal, and leading Mr Crawford to\n\ninfer his disclaimer of the very articles\n\nwhich he has since been led to avow?\n\nWhere is this betrayer of other people's\n\nsecrets now ? Mr Macdougall's establish-\n\nment is prolific of misfortune to this maligner\n\nof his brethren, this disturber of the cor-\n\ndiality of good neighbourhood and the\n\nsanctity of private friendships. Why, apart\n\nfrom all other considerations, the production\n\nof our letter to Mr Macdougall, written to\n\nMr John Stephens on business strictly\n\nprivate, was a gross betrayal of confidence,\n\nalthough Mr John Stephens may not see it,\n\nwhich, in the opinion of every right-minded\n\nman, must meet with deserved reprobation.\n\nOn all other points mooted in the course\n\nof this discussion, we propose rather to rest\n\nour justification upon the documentary evi-\n\ndence annexed, than upon any mere state-\n\nments of our own:—\n\n(No. 1.)\n\nSouth Australia, } The information and com-\n\nDistrict of Adelaide } plaint of Archibald Macdou-\n\nto wit. } gall, of Adelaide, in the\n\nProvince of South Australia, aforesaid, Printer,\n\ntaken before me Henry Rodolph Wigley, Esquire,\n\nResident Magistrate for the district of Adelaide\n\nin the said Province, and one of Her Majesty's\n\nJustices of the Peace for the said Province at\n\nAdelaide aforesaid, this twenty-second day of\n\nApril, one thousand eight hundred and forty-three,\n\nwho giveth me the said Henry Rodolph Wigley\n\nto understand and be informed that James Allen,\n\nof Adelaide, aforesaid, printer, did on the fifth\n\nday of this instant April, at Adelaide aforesaid,\n\nunlawfully, wickedly, and maliciously compose,\n\nprint, and publish, and cause to be composed,\n\nprinted, and published in a certain publication\n\ncalled The South Australian Register, whereof the\n\nsaid James Allen is printer, publisher, and pro-\n\nprietor, of and concerning the said Archibald\n\nMacdougall, a certain false, scandalous, malicious,\n\nand defamatory libel, containing among other\n\nthings in one part thereof the false, scandalous,\n\nmalicious, and defamatory words following, that\n\nis to say—\"There are some men who are not to\n\nbe believed on their oaths, and others whose word\n\nis as little to be relied on when it may chance to\n\nclash with their self-interest, one of these is\n\nArchibald Macdougall, printer and proprietor of\n\nthe Southern Australian\" —meaning this com-\n\nplainant, the said Archibald Macdougall, who is\n\nin fact printer nnd proprietor of a public news-\n\npaper called the Southern Australian, and contain-\n\ning In another pnrt thereof the false, scandalous,\n\nmalicious words following, that is to say —\" But\n\nif like others of his fraternity,\" meaning this com\n\nplainant the said Archibald Maedougall—\" will\n\nnot cheat\"—\" he,\" meaning this compalinant the\n\nsaid Archibald Macdougall—\"can lie as fast as a\n\ndog can trot.\" And which said false, scandalous,\n\nmalicious, and defamatory libel was, as this com\n\nplainant the said Archibald Macdougall verily\n\nbelieves, so composed, printed, and published,\n\nand caused to be composed, printed, and published,\n\nby the said James Allen, with intent to bring him\n\nthis complainant, the said Archibald Macdougall\n\ninto contempt, hatred, infamy, and disgrace, and\n\nto injure him in his trade or business of a printer,\n\nand therefore tlii?

A pineapple of the variety\n\ncalled the Queen Tine, and which weighed\n\nthree pounds, was cut in the garden of Goeorge\n\nStevenson, Esq., North Adelaide.

It ap-\n\npeared the robbery had been perpetrated with\n\nall the expertness of English burglars, the\n\nolder blacks having furnished the boy Yun-\n\ngurra with a chisel, and then put him through\n\nan opening in the window, at night time.\n\nHe then succeeded in getting to the cash-box,\n\nwhich was full of money, and having broken\n\nit open, decamped with the silver, leaving the\n\nnotes and other papers strewed about the floor.\n\nDetection followed by the prisoners offering the\n\nmoney at Albert Town for bread.

James Pow, of the mounted\n\nPolice, stated that on 21st June he went to\n\none of Messrs Hughes's stations, at Reedy\n\nCreek ; saw the prisoner there ; found the\n\nbody of a native man about 150 yards from the\n\nhut; did not know the name of the deceased,\n\nbut he was a young man under 20, and with-\n\nout a beard ; the body was naked ; saw wounds\n\non the back part of the head, and on the arm ;\n\nthey seemed to have been caused by buck shot\n\nor slugs, but could not say whether he died\n\nfrom either of these wounds ; buried the\n\nbody with the assistance of Mr Hughes. In\n\nthe course of the evening, Skelton began (for\n\nthe first lime) to speak about the circum-\n\nstances ; he said that on Sunday evening (the\n\n18th), he heard the sheep rush ; he got out\n\nof bed and went to the sheep-fold ; the sheep\n\nrushed towards him ; he called out, and no\n\none answered him ; he saw something get\n\nover the hurdles, which he thought was a\n\nnative dog; he called again, and there being\n\nno answer, he fired ; seeing that the object\n\ndid not get up, he went down and found it to\n\nbe a black ; he brought the body to the hut,\n\nand then went and reported the mailer to Mr\n\nHughes ; prisoner did not allude to the body\n\nwhich he (witness) had buried, but under\n\nstood that it was the body referred to ; it was\n\nvery dark on the Sunday evening. The\n\nprisoner was committed for trial, but will be\n\nadmitted to bail.— Ibid."
