More than 2,200 persons, places and events have been recognized as national historic designations for their role in shaping the country.\n\nTelling complex stories from Canada’s past\n\nCanadians value learning about the country’s past, in all its richness and complexity. This history includes fascinating stories of greatness, valour, exploration, and innovation, but also stories that are challenging, uncomfortable and, in some cases, tragic. National historic designations reflect this diverse range of subjects.\n\nReviewing existing designations\n\nParks Canada’s Framework for History and Commemoration (2019) outlines the approach for the careful review of existing national historic designations and their plaque texts. The review focuses on incorporating new knowledge and expanded perspectives to ensure that national historic designations reflect the broad spectrum of history in Canada. This includes the histories, cultures, and contributions of Indigenous peoples.\n\nLearn more about the review process\n\nWhen a national historic designation has been identified for review, a Parks Canada historian researches the designation to determine whether its reason for designation or plaque text need to be updated. Members of the public knowledgeable about the subject are engaged. This may include the person who requested the review, an implicated community (including First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples), subject-matter experts, and/or local stakeholders or community members. A research report is then presented to the Board for their consideration.\n\nNational historic designations under review\n\nParks Canada maintains a list of national historic designations that are prioritized for review. This list is updated twice annually. As new public requests come in, the list of designations identified for review is expected to grow. As reviews are completed, a link will be added to show the results of a review. Reviewing older designations is an integral part of the work of the Board.\n\nSee more ways to filter this list\n\nFilter by:\n\nDesignation type\n\nNational historic event\n\nNational historic person\n\nNational historic site\n\nReason for review\n\nColonial assumptions\n\nTerminology\n\nAbsence\n\nControversial beliefs and behaviours\n\nN/A - Not applicable\n\nNew research\n\nStatus of review\n\nPending\n\nIn progress\n\nComplete\n\nProvince or territory\n\nAlberta\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nManitoba\n\nNew Brunswick\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador\n\nNorthwest Territories\n\nNova Scotia\n\nNunavut\n\nOntario\n\nPrince Edward Island\n\nQuebec\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nYukon Territory\n\nReview of designations related to residential schools\n\nDesignated persons, events, and sites are being reviewed for their connection to the history and legacy of the residential school system. This review examines why these topics were initially designated and expands Canadians’ knowledge of Indigenous histories as directed in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action 79.\n\nThe following designations have been reviewed by the Board for their connection to the history and legacy of Indian Residential Schools:\n\nReview of events related to residential schools\n\nNational historic events reviewed in relation to the legacy of the residential school system.\n\nReview of persons related to residential schools\n\nNational historic persons reviewed relating to residential schools and Indigenous policy.\n\nAs more reviews are completed, these pages will be updated to include the results.\n\nRequest a review"
