        "text": "Entries: 50 works\n\nExhibition dates: winning work from 12 January 1924 for two months; all other entries for two weeks\n\nAll entries were exhibited; no limit to number of works each artist could submit\n\nHow can you tell if a person is ‘distinguished in the arts, letters, science or politics’ if they are not named? WB McInnes’s Portrait of a lady – his third winner in a row – was criticised as the sitter wasn’t disclosed in the title (unlike the male subjects of McInnes’s three other entries). She was identified as Violet McInnes, WB’s wife and an artist herself (who would later enter her own work in the Archibald)."
