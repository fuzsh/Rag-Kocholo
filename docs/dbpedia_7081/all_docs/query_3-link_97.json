        "text": "Chapter Source Reference 1 Bible Joshua 6:26[1] Frank quotes the verse while explaining to Claire the practice of burying a sacrifice under a new foundation: \"He shall lay the foundations thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.\" 1 Bible Genesis 19:26[2] Claire likens herself to Lot's wife while Frank hugs her, trying to make amends. 1 William Shakespeare The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, scene 1 (ca. 1600)[3] Claire quotes the line as she forgives Frank for his accusation: \"The quality of mercy is not strain'd, / It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven...\" 2 Cameron Unknown title Reverend Wakefield goes to check in \"Cameron\" to verify if the Duke of Sandringham was a Jacobite. 2 Donald Donn / William Mackay \"Tomorrow I shall be on a hill, without a head\" (poem)[4] Frank recites a few lines of Donald Donn's poetry to Claire: \"Tomorrow I shall be on a hill, without a head. / Have you no compassion on my sorrowful maiden, / My Mary, the fair and tender-eyed?\"[5][6] 3 Bible 1 Corinthians 14:34[7] A man in the MacKenzie party starts to recite the verse to admonish Claire for her vulgar language: \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak.\" 6 Robert Burns (attributed) \"Selkirk Grace\"[8] Hamish says grace: \"Some hae meat that canna eat, / And some could eat that want it; / We hae meat, and we can eat, / And so may God be thankit.\" 7 William Shakespeare Hamlet, Act III, scene 4, line 57 (ca. 1599)[9] Claire thinks of the line when she meets Auld Alec, who has one eye: \"An eye like Mars, to threaten and command ...\" 8 Nursery rhyme Old King Cole (1708) Claire recites a few lines of the poem while waiting for Gwyllyn the Bard to begin playing: \"Oh, he called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl, and he called for his fiddlers three.\" 15 Bible Genesis 27:11[10] Claire notes the difference between Jamie's hairy hands and Frank's smooth ones: \"For Jacob's skin was smooth, while his brother Esau was a hairy man.\"[11] 15 Geoffrey Chaucer The Wife of Bath's Tale from The Canterbury Tales\n\n(published 1478) Claire feels like the Wife of Bath while explaining the finer points of lovemaking to Jamie in their marriage bed. 16 Alexander Carmichael (editor) (poem fragment)[12]\n\nfrom the Carmina Gadelica, vol. II (1900) Jamie recites a poem from the Isles to Claire: \"Thou daughter of the kingdom of the regions of the light, / On the night that thy wedding is on us...\" 20 Catullus / trans. Richard Crashaw Catullus 5 (ca. 84 – 54 BC)[13] Jamie translates the bit of poetry, which Hugh Munro had written on a piece of paper and wrapped around a chunk of amber: \"Da mi basia mille...\" 22 Bible 1 Corinthians 7:9[14] Jamie recalls the verse to Claire as he explains his involvement with Laoghaire: \"...for it is better to marry than to burn.\" 23 William Shakespeare Hamlet, Act I, scene 5, line 20 (ca. 1599)[15] Claire wakens suddenly, blurting \"Horrocks!\", which startles Jamie out of sleep and at the ready with his dirk. Claire remarks that he looks like a \"fretful porpentine\". 24 William Shakespeare MacBeth, Act IV, scene 1, line 44 (ca. 1606)[16] Chapter title: By the Pricking of My Thumbs 25 Bible Colossians 3:12[17] Geilie quotes the passage when talking to Claire in the thieves' hole about Colum MacKenzie: \"Bowels of mercy and compassion, is it?\"[18] 25 Bible Habakkuk 3:5[19] Father Bain denounces Claire during the witch trial, equipped with inflammatory verse: \"Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.\" 25 Bible Proverbs 2:16-18[20] Father Bain continues his denunciation: \"To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words...

After greeting his own dogs, Jamie continues, quoting in Greek, \"In which Odysseus returns to his home, disguised as a beggar...\" and makes a comment about dealing with Penelope and her suitors. 26 Norman Macleod Caraid nan Gaidheal = The friend of the Gael : a choice selection of Gaelic writings Jamie quotes a few lines of poetry to Claire about the legendary Fingal and his dogs: \"Thus Fingal chose his hounds: / Eye like sloe, ear like leaf, / Chest like horse, hough like sickle / And the tail joint far from the head.\"[22] It is also notable that Jamie's dog, Bran, is named for the legendary Fingal's hound, who is considered a hero in his own right. 38 Herodotus Various Works Father Anselm uses the library at the Abbey of Ste. Anne de Beaupré to work on translating the works of Herodotus.[23] 38 Tacitus Unidentified Book Jamie reads a book by Tacitus while at the Abbey of Ste. Anne de Beaupré. 39 Bible 1 Samuel 5:9[24] Claire peruses the Bible in search of guidance: \"...and he smote them with emerods, and they were very sore.\" 39 Bible Psalms 22:6, 22:14, 22:19-20[25] Claire peruses the Bible in search of guidance: \"But I am a worm, and no man... I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels... But be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, haste thee to help me. Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.\" 39 Bible Job 14:22,[26] 33:19-25[27] Claire chooses to consult the Book of Job, Jamie's favorite: \"But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn... He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain... His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth.\" Chapter Source Reference Part I Bible 1 Corinthians 13:12[28] Title of Part I, Through a Looking Glass, Darkly: \"For now we see through a glass, darkly ...\" Part I Lewis Carroll Through the Looking-Glass (1871) Title of Part I, Through a Looking Glass, Darkly 6 Bible Psalm 146:3[29] Jamie explains his caution to Claire, regarding Charles Stuart and the French court: \"Put not your trust in princes...\" 8 John Donne Devotions upon Emergent Occasions (1624)[30] Claire observes the departure of the Victomtesse de Rambeau in her carriage, and thinks of the slogan, À la lanterne!, which would become popular during the French Revolution. Claire paraphrases a quotation to Master Raymond, substituting the word \"tumbril\" for \"bell\": \"... and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\"[31] 10 Samuel Pepys His diary (1660-1669) Claire dreams of Frank, who mentions Pepys while explaining the rarity of a historical resource that faithfully describes the mundane as well as the noteworthy. 12 W. S. Gilbert Harlequin Cock-Robin and Jenny Wren (1867)[32] Claire compares the sudden appearance of a nun, summoned by Mother Hildegarde's clap of the hands, to Cock-Robin, the title figure of a pantomime who was magically turned from a dead bird into a \"little man\". 12 William Shakespeare Hamlet, Act I, scene 5, lines 166-167 (ca. 1599)[33] Claire paraphrases the lines to Sister Angelique at L'Hôpital des Anges: \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" 19 William Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet (1597) Claire observes that Alexander Randall and Mary Hawkins, lying unconscious beside each other, look like Romeo and Juliet \"laid out in the public square as a reproach to their relatives\". 23 Robert Burns \"To a Mouse, on Turning Her Up in Her Nest with the Plough\" (1785) Chapter title: The Best-Laid Plans of Mice and Men...[34] 24 Alfred, Lord Tennyson Lady Clara Vere de Vere (1842) Claire quotes the poem to Jamie: \"Kind hearts are more than coronets.\" 24 Robert Burns \"The Author’s Earnest Cry and Prayer\" (1786) Claire quotes the line to Jamie: \"Freedom an’ whisky gang thegither!\" 27 St. Augustine Confessions (397-400) When the Comte St. Germain and Master Raymond stand before King Louis XV accused of sorcery, Louis notes that they have both practiced astrology, but that this is not a crime as even St. Augustine was known to have made inquiries into the mysteries of astrology. Claire recalls that St. Augustine had dismissed astrology as a load of rubbish and she doubts that Louis has read Augustine's Confessions. 28 Bible Catholic liturgy / Genesis 3:19[35] Claire describes Faith to Jamie, and thinks of the lines: \"Remember, man, that thou are dust, and unto dust thou shalt return.\" This is recited on Ash Wednesday as part of the Catholic liturgy, and originates from Genesis 3:19. 31 Robert Louis Stevenson \"Requiem\" from Underwoods (1887)[36] Claire quotes lines to Jamie: \"Home is the sailor, home from the sea, / And the hunter home from the hill.\" 31 Sir Walter O'Bannion Reilly A Scientific Treatise on Methods of Farming This is the book Ian sends away for when Claire tells them to plant potatoes. 34 James M.

Charles Dickens wrote a three volume series of books with this name. Dickens' books only dealt with English history up to 1689, but had one final chapter summarizing events between 1689 and 1853 when the book was written. It seems likely that Claire's book was the Dickens book as Claire notes that it had only a two-page section on the Jacobite Rising. 38 Bible Exodus 34:7,[38] Jeremiah 11:19[39] Claire thinks of the passages, reflecting on her choices that have possibly written Frank Randall out of existence: \"For the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children... and thou shalt destroy him, root and branch, so that his name shall no more be known among the tribes of Israel.\" 42 L. Frank Baum The Oz Books\n\n(1900-1920 by Baum; later additional volumes by other authors) Claire likens Murtagh to the Gnome King. 45 Andrew Marvell \"To His Coy Mistress\" (ca. 1650s) With Alexander Randall dead, and Mary Hawkins alone on her wedding night, Claire thinks of the lines as a contrast to herself and Jamie, who remain alive and together: \"The grave's a fine and private place, / But none, I think, do there embrace.\" 46 Alexander Carmichael (editor) \"An Cath Nach Tainig (The Battle to Come)\"[40]\n\nfrom the Carmina Gadelica, vol. I (1900) Claire starts to say the blessing to Jamie before they hear English soldiers approaching the house, on the eve of the Battle of Culloden: \"Jesus, Thou Son of Mary, I call on Thy name...\" 49 Bible John 20:29[41] Roger thinks of the verse after the harrowing experience of watching Gillian Edgars go through the cleft stone on Craigh na Dun: \"Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.\" Chapter Source Reference Part I A.

Notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing, if she continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.\" 5 Bible John 11[47] Jamie, hidden in the wardrobe during a close encounter with English soldiers, observes that before Mrs. Innes can ask a question, Jenny \"shot up from the bedclothes like Lazarus.\" 5 Mrs. McLintock Mrs. McLintock's receipts for cookery and pastry-work (1736) Jenny consults her cookbook while making hare pie. 6 Bible Romans 5:9[48] Chapter title: Being Now Justified by His Blood 6 Daniel Defoe Robinson Crusoe (1719) Jamie is reading the novel in the cave when he hears the sound of soldiers: \"This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have drowned my cave...\" Part III John Milton Paradise Lost, Book IV, line 970 (1667)[49] Title of Part III: When I Am Thy Captive 7 Woodhill Patriots[50] This is a book that Frank owns, being a series of profiles of the American Founding Fathers. Frank compares Claire's passion for medicine to the passion the Founding Fathers had, and warns Claire that they paid a price for that passion. 8 Tobias Smollett The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) Jamie thinks about the stories he would tell the men in prison with him at Ardsmuir. 8 Henry Fielding The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749) Jamie thinks about the stories he would tell the men in prison with him at Ardsmuir. 8 Daniel Defoe Robinson Crusoe (1719) Jamie thinks about the stories he would tell the men in prison with him at Ardsmuir, of which Robinson Crusoe is their favorite. 10 Jean-Jacques Rousseau Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse (1761) Lord John is surprised to find that Jamie enjoys French novels.[51] 10 Daniel Defoe Robinson Crusoe (1719) Lord John asks Jamie if he is familiar with the novel. 11 Samuel Richardson Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded (1740) Jamie and Lord John discuss the length of the novel. 12 Bible Acts 2[52] Jamie thinks of the descent of the Holy Spirit on the apostles, and its illustration in his mother's Bible. 14 Bible Isaiah 14:12[53] Lord John paraphrases the quotation to himself while looking at Jamie: \"O Lucifer, thou son of the morning...\" 15 John Cleland Fanny Hill (1748) Jamie is reading the novel when he is summoned to ready the coach to travel to Ellesmere. 21 Robert Burns \"The Author’s Earnest Cry and Prayer\" (1786) Roger and Brianna show Claire an article they believe to have been written by Jamie: \"Freedom an’ whisky gang thegither!\" Part V Thomas Wolfe You Can't Go Home Again (1940) Title of Part V 22 Joseph Jacobs \"The Sprightly Tailor\" from Celtic Fairy Tales (1892)[54][55] Roger quotes the story to Claire, explaining that he can never sleep on All Hallows' Eve because of the scary stories his father told him growing up: \"See'st thou this great gray head, with jaws which have no meat?\" 26 Bible Luke 6:37[56] Jamie quotes the passage in reproach to Ian Murray's insinuations about his character: \"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged.\" 27 Alexander Carmichael (editor) \"Fois Anama (Soul Peace)\"[57]\n\nfrom the Carmina Gadelica, vol. I (1900) Jamie tells Ian to say this prayer after taking a life. 27 Alexander Carmichael (editor) \"An Treoraich Anama (The Soul Leading)\"[58]\n\nfrom the Carmina Gadelica, vol. I (1900) A shorter prayer for when time is short, as in battle. 28 John Milton Paradise Lost (1667) Claire asks Jamie if it was the archangel Michael who drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden. 29 Sir Walter Scott Marmion, Canto VI, XVII (1808)[59] Claire quotes the lines to Jamie while they wait for Ian to finish going to confession: \"Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!\" 32 Robert Frost \"The Death of the Hired Man\" (1914)[60] Claire says the quote to Young Ian as reassurance as they approach Lallybroch: \"Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.\" 32 Bible Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32)[61] Jamie mentions the passage as his own reassurance to Ian.

E. Housman \"Because I liked you\" from More Poems (1936)[68] Claire thinks of another Housman poem while thinking of Jamie's gravestone in Scotland in the 20th century: \"Halt by the headstone naming / The heart no longer stirred, / And say the lad that loved you / Was one that kept his word.\" 44 Charles Perrault \"Le Petit Chaperon rouge\" (Little Red Riding Hood)\n\nfrom Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1697) Jamie watches the sharks attack the cask of spoiled horse meat thrown overboard from the Artemis: \"Why, grandmother dear, what big teeth ye have!\" 50 Samuel Taylor Coleridge The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798) Claire thinks of the lines when she finds herself washed up on an island covered in mangroves, and inhabited by strange animals: \"Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink.\" 52 Bible Song of Solomon 2:5-6[69] Claire paraphrases the passage to Jamie, who is describing his plan for the next time they have sufficient space and time to be alone together: \"My beloved's arm is under me, and his hand behind my head.

I (1900) Geillis tells Jamie and Claire the story of her escape from Castle Leoch: \"God, omit not this woman from thy covenant...\" Chapter Source Reference 7 Bible Job 1:13-22[74] Claire thinks of the Book of Job as an analogy to Jamie's losses since the Rising, and William Tryon's offer to have it all back. 8 Petronius (attributed)\n\nBen Jonson (translation) \"Fragmentum Petron. Arbitr.\" Under-woods. Consisting of Divers Poems (1640)[75] Jamie recites the lines in Latin to Claire, after his advances are stymied by the presence of Ian and their other companions: \"Foeda est in coitu, & brevis voluptas, / Et taedet Veneris statim per actae.\" (Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short ; / And done, we straight repent us of the sport.) 8 Homer Odyssey (8th century BC) Jamie recites passages in Ancient Greek, attempting to tutor Ian in Greek and Latin. 8 Plautus Amphitryon, lines 648-653 (ca. 205–184 BC)[76] Jamie prompts Ian for the lines in Latin, with less than favorable results.[77] 8 Virgil Aeneid, line 1 (ca. 29–19 BC)[78] Claire Fraser admits that the line is all she remembers of her Latin instruction: \"Arma virumque cano.\" 8 John O'Keeffe The Agreeable Surprise (1781)[79] Jamie recites a poem, to Claire and Ian's amusement: \"Amo, amas, I love a lass...\"[80] 9 Bible Proverbs 31:10[81] Stephen Bonnet paraphrases the passage: \"A virtuous woman is prized above rubies; her price is greater than pearls.\" 9 Bible Matthew 6:34[82] Claire quotes the passage: \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" 10 William Congreve The Mourning Bride, Act III, scene 2, and Act I, scene 1 (1697)[83] Claire chimes in with the quote during the discussion about Lieutenant Wolff's unsuccessful marriage proposal to Jocasta: \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\" 12 Bible Song of Solomon 7:4[84] Phillip Wylie quotes the beginning of the line to Claire, who finishes it: \"Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.\" 13 Aristophanes The Frogs (405 BC) Jamie quotes the frogs' refrain to Claire: \"Brek-ek-ek-ex, co-ax, co-ax.

He is like the sparks that fly upward... and his place will know him no more.\" 15 Bible Psalm 103:15-16[92], Matthew 6:30[90], 1 Peter 1:24-25[93] Jamie likewise paraphrases the sentiments of multiple verses: \"Man is like the grass of the field: today it blooms; tomorrow it withers and is cast into the oven.\" These, as well as other verses, lend meaning to their overall conversation – that life on Earth is fleeting, but love (i.e. the word of God) endures forever. 15 Rudyard Kipling The Jungle Book (1894) Claire thinks of \"Mowgli and the Red Flower\", briefly considering fire as a weapon against the bear, but lays a hand on one of the fish Jamie caught and uses that instead. 16 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Evangeline (1847) Claire takes in the wilderness around her, thinking of the first lines of Longfellow's epic poem: \"This is the forest primeval.
