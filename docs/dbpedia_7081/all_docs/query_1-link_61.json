        "text": "Traveling Exhibition Script\n\n1. Portrait gallery\n\nAlexander Hamilton (1757-1804) is with us every day, in our wallets, on the $10 bill. But he is with us in another sense, for more than any other Founder, he foresaw the America we live in now. He shaped the financial, political, and legal systems of the young United States. His ideas on racial equality and economic diversity were so far ahead of their time that it took America decades to catch up with them. There is no inevitability in history; ideals alone -- even the ideals of the Founding Fathers -- do not guarantee success. Hamilton made the early republic work, and set the agenda for its future. We live in the world he made; here is what he did, and how he did it.\n\nHis World\n\nHamilton's world teemed with active, opinionated men and women. Some were local celebrities in his small but bustling adopted home of New York City; some were national figures; and a few were world famous. Hamilton worked, argued, and fought with them; he loved, admired and hated them. Some crossed his path briefly. Others were fixed points in his life. Still others changed their relationships with him as politics or passion moved them. The portraits in this exhibition show the important people in his life, and in his psyche.\n\nAlexander Hamilton (1757-1804)\n\nJohn Trumbull (1756-1843)\n\nOil on canvas, after 1804\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Thomas Jefferson Bryan\n\nTrumbull painted Hamilton several times.

Though he and Hamilton were both Federalists, personal antipathies and political differences drove them apart.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826)\n\nRembrandt Peale (1778-1860)\n\nOil on canvas, 1805\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Thomas Jefferson Bryan\n\nAuthor of the Declaration of Independence, first Secretary of State and third President, Jefferson was Hamilton's colleague, nemesis and survivor. Hamilton worked with him, fought him, and backed him for President over Aaron Burr in 1800.\n\nJames Madison (1751-1836)\n\nAsher Brown Durand (1796-1886), after Gilbert Stuart\n\nOil on canvas, 1835\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of the New York Gallery of Fine Arts\n\nMadison worked with Hamilton to ratify the Constitution, but they soon fell out. Madison and Jefferson founded the Republican party (today's Democratic party) to oppose Hamilton's Federalists. Madison succeeded Jefferson as President.\n\nDolley Madison (Mrs. James Madison, 1768-1849)\n\nBass Otis (1784-1861)\n\nOil on canvas, c. 1817\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Thomas Jefferson Bryan\n\nDolley Madison was her husband's charming and popular First Lady. In old age, she and Elizabeth Hamilton raised money to build the Washington Monument.\n\nFriends, Allies, and Adversaries\n\nParty politics and the passionate convictions about the direction the new nation should take affected Hamilton's personal relationships with many leading figures in his world, as he plunged into controversies, shifting alliances and friendships throughout his life.\n\nAaron Burr (1756-1836)\n\nJohn Vanderlyn (1775-1852)\n\nOil on canvas, 1802\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Dr. John E.

He killed Hamilton in a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey, on July 11, 1804.\n\nTheodosia Burr (Mrs. Joseph Alston, 1783 -1813)\n\nJohn Vanderlyn (1775-1852)\n\nOil on canvas, 1802\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Dr. John E. Stillwell\n\nDaughter of Aaron Burr, and wife of Joseph Alston, governor of South Carolina, Theodosia was her father's beloved confidante.

In 1789, when Lafayette was a leader of the Revolution in France, Hamilton warned him that it might not succeed.\n\nJohn Jay (1745-1829)\n\nJoseph Wright (1756-1793)\n\nOil on canvas, 1786\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of John Pintard\n\nCongressman, diplomat, first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and governor, Jay was a revered figure in New York politics. Hamilton, Jay, and James Madison collaborated on the\n\nFederalist Papers. Jay was also, along with Hamilton, a founder of the New York Manumission Society.\n\nGouverneur Morris (1752-1816)\n\nEzra Ames (1768-1836)\n\nOil on canvas, c. 1815\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Stephen Van Rensselaer\n\nA witty ladies' man with a wooden leg, Gouverneur Morris wrote the Preamble to the Constitution, reflecting his friend Hamilton's ideals, and delivered Hamilton's eulogy.\n\nRobert Livingston (1745-1813)\n\nGilbert Stuart (1755-1828)\n\nOil on canvas, c. 1794\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Goodhue Livingston, Jr.\n\nA congressman and diplomat, Livingston supported Hamilton in the fight to ratify the Constitution in 1788, but turned on him a year later after Hamilton opposed his in-law, James Duane, for Senate.\n\nQuotations about Hamilton in this section:\n\n\"He is enterprising, quick in his perceptions, and his judgment is intuitively great.\" -- George Washington to John Adams, September 25, 1798\n\n\"... the most restless, impatient, artful, indefatigable, and unprincipled intriguer in the United States, if not in the world.\" -- John Adams to James Lloyd, February 17, 1815\n\n2. Immigrant\n\nUnlike most of the Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant. As a boy in the West Indies, he was introduced to shame (his parents were unmarried) and to the world of commerce (he went to work as a merchant's clerk when he was nine). Sent to New York to be educated, Hamilton was soon caught up in the American Revolution. He made the new nation his own, espousing its ideals and marrying a patriotic young woman. While his talents and ambition were perfectly suited to the burgeoning energy of New York, he envisioned a unified nation in a way that most of his contemporaries, rooted in home-state loyalties, could not.\n\nRoots in the Caribbean\n\nBorn on Nevis and raised in St. Croix, Hamilton grew up in the heart of the Caribbean sugar economy, which generated vast wealth from slave labor. Hamilton, recognizing the injustice, would become a leader in the anti-slavery movement in the United States.\n\nSlave leg chains, c. 1760\n\nHand wrought iron\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\nUsed to hobble slaves at auction and in transport, such chains were commonplace in the world of Hamilton's childhood. Perhaps remembering these horrors, as an adult Hamilton vigorously opposed slavery.\n\nSugar bowl, c. 1790\n\nSilver, made by John Adam\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Mrs. Nathaniel McLean Sage\n\nThe end product of slavery -- sweetness, for a few. This engraved piece of silver belonged to Hamilton's in-laws, the Schuylers, and suggests how sugar was an unremarked presence in everyday life.\n\nAlexander McDougall Waste-book, June 1, 1767-January 8, 1771\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nThis ledger illuminates a New York merchant's dealings with Nicholas Cruger and his partners -- \"Beekman & Cruger of St. Croix... 15 th Novr 1766\" for £160 15s. 3d. -- about the time Hamilton became Cruger's clerk.\n\nAn Ambitious Youth\n\nSent to work at age nine to help support his mother and brother, and orphaned soon after, Hamilton was a merchant's clerk in St. Croix. His intelligence and determination to make something of himself inspired local benefactors to send him to New York to be educated.\n\nHamilton drawn from life, Jan[uary] 11, 1773\n\nPhotograph of miniature portrait and inscription\n\nUnidentified artist\n\nLibrary of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division\n\nDrawn on his birthday, probably a gift from a friend, this miniature shows a teenaged Hamilton shortly before he left St. Croix. The thoughtful features would characterize all his portraits.\n\nView of Christiansted from the Sea, 1825\n\nPhotograph of Painting, Original in Danish National Library\n\nLibrary of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, HABS, VI.1 CHRIS, 13\n\nThis view of St. Croix's largest town, complete with fort, church, and company docks, shows the commercially active port where Hamilton lived and worked as a boy.\n\nNicholas Cruger (1743-1800)\n\nPhotograph of watercolor and ink miniature portrait\n\nArtist unknown, circa 1780\n\nNational Historic Site, Museum Collections\n\nChristiansted, St. Croix, Virgin Islands\n\nThe St. Croix agent of his New York-based family trading firm, Cruger employed Hamilton as a clerk from age nine, and represented his link to the outside world.\n\nLetter from Alexander Hamilton to Edward Stevens, St. Croix, November 11, 1769\n\nCopy, undated\n\nLibrary of Congress, Manuscript Division\n\nAs a 12-year-old orphan, clerking for the trader Nicholas Cruger in St. Croix, Hamilton wrote this, his earliest surviving letter, to his friend Edward Stevens, who was studying at King's College in New York: \"My Ambition is so prevalent that I contemn the grov'ling condition of a Clerk... I wish there was a War.\"\n\nSchool exercises,\n\nThe Iliad of Homer (1772-1775)\n\nLibrary of Congress, Manuscript Division\n\nHamilton's brilliance shone through a spotty early education. His Huguenot mother taught him French. Here he works at Homer. His favorite author was the biographer of the ancient world, Plutarch.\n\nNew Beginnings in New York\n\nHamilton's talents and ambition were perfectly suited to New York City, the second-largest town in the thirteen colonies, and growing fast. He enrolled in King's College (later Columbia College), but his studies were cut short by the American Revolution.\n\nPlan of the City of New York in North America, surveyed in the Years 1766 & 1767 (republished 1776)\n\nBernard Ratzer\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nThis map and engraved harbor view looking north to Manhattan from Governor's Island show what Hamilton saw as he arrived in New York from the Caribbean in 1773.\n\nElias Boudinot, L.L.D. (1740-1821)\n\nEngraving by J. W. Paradise based on a painting by Waldo & Jewett\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nAfter coming to New York, Hamilton spent six months in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, preparing for college. Boudinot, a prominent lawyer, looked after him, and introduced him to patriotic politics.\n\nRev. Myles Cooper (1737-1785)\n\nS. B. Hutchings; after John Singleton Copley\n\nOil on canvas, 1820\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Nicholas William Stuyvesant\n\nPresident of King's College (now Columbia) when Hamilton attended, Cooper strongly supported British rule. Hamilton, already a patriot activist, nevertheless prevented an angry mob from tarring and feathering Cooper one night in May 1775.\n\nElizabeth Schuyler Hamilton\n\n(Mrs. Alexander Hamilton, 1757-1854)\n\nAfter Ralph Earl (1751-1801)\n\nEngraving, 1857\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nLetter from Alexander Hamilton to Elizabeth Schuyler, October 5, 1780\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\n\"I have told you, and told you truly that I love you too much,\" Hamilton wrote his bride-to-be. \"I meet you in every dream.\" By marrying into the prominent Schuyler family of Albany, New York, Hamilton -- who had come from humble origins in the West Indies -- secured a place for himself in the world of wealth and power.\n\nQuotations:\n\n\"My Ambition is so prevalent that I contemn the grov'ling condition of a Clerk.\" -- Alexander Hamilton, age 12, to Edward Stevens, November 11, 1769\n\n3. Soldier\n\nHamilton spent much of his life in military uniform. From 1776 to 1781, in the Revolutionary War, he fought in seven major battles, as a captain of artillery, a colonel on George Washington's staff, and a commander of light infantry. In 1798-99, when war with France loomed, he re-entered the military as a senior officer.\n\nThe American Revolution\n\nWhen Hamilton arrived in New York, the thirteen colonies had been protesting British taxes and commercial regulations for years. New York City was a hotbed of contending political factions, pitting Patriots against pro-British Loyalists. While still a student at King's College (now Columbia), Hamilton took up the Patriots' cause, writing his first political article in 1774 (he signed himself \"A Friend to America\").\n\nPayroll of the Colony Company of Artillery Commanded by Alexander Hamilton March 1 to April 1, 1776\n\nNew-York Historical Society, Alexander McDougall Papers\n\nWar came to New York not long after Hamilton did. In the spring of 1775 he joined a militia company of student volunteers. By March 1776 he was captain of a New York artillery company. This payroll lists his men. Eventually he had 68 under his command. His company retreated from New York in the fall of 1776 with Washington's army, but later fought victoriously at Trenton and Princeton.\n\nPortrait of Alexander Hamilton in the Trenches\n\nAlonzo Chappel (1829-1887)\n\nOil on canvas, c. 1857\n\nMuseum of the City of New York, Gift of Mrs. Alexander Hamilton and General Pierpont Morgan Hamilton\n\nThis painting recalls one Revolutionary War veteran's memory of Hamilton: \"I saw a youth, a mere stripling, small, slender... with a cocked hat pulled down over his eyes, apparently lost in thought.\"\n\nBritish-made musket with bayonet, 1765-1775\n\nWood, iron, brass\n\nNew-York Historical Society, Gift of Mrs. William R. Tarbox\n\nThis \"Brown Bess\" musket was standard for British infantry. Americans, who manufactured only a fraction of their own weapons, relied on captured pieces, or French supplies. Hamilton lamented the dependence on foreign arms.\n\nWashington's Aide-de-Camp\n\nIn March 1777 Hamilton was promoted to colonel and appointed to George Washington's staff. He performed essential tasks, saw firsthand the dire consequences of Congress's inability to pay for adequate supplies or troops, and forged, with his Commander in Chief, the most important political bond of his life. But though Hamilton's work on Washington's staff was stimulating and important, it was also confining. He longed to return to the battlefield to win still more glory. He did so in 1781, and fought bravely at the war's climactic Battle of Yorktown. In 1783 the Revolution ended in victory -- and a load of debt for the newly independent nation.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Alexander Hamilton, Aide de Camp to George Washington\n\nCharles Willson Peale (1741-1827)\n\nWatercolor on ivory, 1777\n\nMuseum of the City of New York\n\nGift of Philip and Dolores Grieve\n\nIn 1777, Charles Willson Peale, a captain in the American military, painted the newly promoted colonel, adorned with the silk sash designating an aide-de-camp, shortly after Hamilton joined Washington's staff.\n\nMap of the Battle of Yorktown in October 1781 (Printed February 1782)\n\nMajor Sebastian Bauman\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\nFinally given a field command by Washington, Hamilton led an infantry charge at Yorktown, Virginia, against a British redoubt (marked \"K,\" near the river) on October 14, 1781. Five days later, the British surrendered, effectively ending the war.\n\nUnited States Flag\n\nWool, cotton, c. 1781\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nAmerican troops are believed to have carried flags like this at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, the Revolution's climactic battle. Hamilton, eager to fight after years of staff work, led a decisive infantry charge.\n\nThe American Rattle Snake, April 12, 1782\n\nBritish cartoon attributed to James Gillray (1756-1815)\n\nNew-York Historical Society, Hyde Collection\n\nThis British cartoon, drawn while peace was being negotiated, depicts British troops encircled by a massive \"American rattlesnake.\" The message: military force could not suppress the American rebellion.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nIn the 1790s, the French Revolution ignited a new series of world wars. George Washington and Hamilton desperately wanted to keep the unprepared nation out of the conflict, as Washington wrote (with Hamilton's help) in his Farewell Address: \"Why... entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition?\" But when war against Revolutionary France appeared inevitable, the two veterans joined forces once again to build an effective army.\n\nDraft fragment of George Washington's\n\nFarewell Address\n\nc. August 1796\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nManuscripts and Archives Division, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations\n\nLetter from Alexander Hamilton to George Washington, Sept. 4, 1796\n\nManuscripts and Archives Division, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations\n\nAlthough Hamilton kept it secret, he was ghostwriter for Washington's Farewell Address in 1796, as the draft fragment here reveals. In this final message, Washington stressed the blessings of the Union and the dangers that threatened it, especially in foreign affairs: \"The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave.\"\n\nList of applicants for new regular army under the administration of\n\nPresident John Adams, undated\n\nGeorge Washington and Alexander Hamilton\n\nDaniel Burke Library, Hamilton College\n\nPresented to the Hon. Elihu Root, Secretary of War, June 1, 1901\n\nBy Alan McLane Hamilton, son of Philip and grandson of Alexander Hamilton\n\nIn 1798, as war with France loomed, President Adams appointed Hamilton \"Inspector and Major General,\" second-in-command to Washington, at Washington's urging -- and against his own inclination. The army needed to be built from scratch, and Hamilton and Washington made swift and merciless evaluations (\"drunkard,\" \"worthless,\" \"clever\") of proposed officers.\n\nQuotations:\n\n\"I wish there was a war.\" -- Alexander Hamilton, age 12, to Edward Stevens, November 11, 1769\n\n\"'Tis our true policy to steer clear of permanent Alliances, with any part of the foreign world.\" -- George Washington, Farewell Address, written with help of Hamilton, September 19, 1796\n\n4. Lawmaker\n\nHamilton attended the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and helped persuade a skeptical public to ratify the Constitution by launching the\n\nFederalist Papers, a series of newspaper pieces. The first\n\nFederalist asked for laws based on \"reflection and choice,\" not \"accident and force.\" In his career as a lawyer, Hamilton advocated principles of constitutional interpretation such as judicial review -- a controversial doctrine then and now.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution\n\nHamilton's wartime experience had shown him the need for a stronger central government. At the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, Hamilton and other like-minded delegates produced a sturdy but flexible governmental structure. During 1787 and 1788, Hamilton led the campaign to ratify it.\n\nNotes of Hamilton's speech at the Constitutional Convention, June 29, 1787\n\nRufus King (1755-1827)\n\nNew-York Historical Society, Rufus King Papers\n\nThese extraordinary documents record snippets of what is otherwise lost: the arguments the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention made behind closed doors. Here, Rufus King scribbled down what he could of Hamilton's remarks, responding to William Johnson of Connecticut and James Madison of Virginia, on the vexed issue of proportional representation in Congress.\n\nRufus King (1755-1827)\n\nUnidentified artist\n\nOil on sheet metal, c. 1810\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Emily H. Suydam\n\nKing represented Massachusetts at the Constitutional Convention. After moving to New York, King won a Senate seat, with Hamilton's support, beating James Duane, the Livingstons' candidate. He, like Hamilton, was an anti-slavery activist.\n\nSigning of the Constitution, undated\n\nThomas Pritchard Rossiter (1817-1871)\n\nOil on canvas\n\nFraunces Tavern ® Museum, New York City\n\nAmong the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention depicted here are: Washington, presiding; Benjamin Franklin, beside wooden-legged Gouverneur Morris; rose-clad Hamilton, to Franklin's left; James Madison, beside Hamilton. The man touching Hamilton's shoulder may be Rufus King.\n\nUnited States Constitution, draft, August 6, 1787\n\nInscribed:\n\nPierce Butler\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\nUnited States Constitution\n\nFinal version, September 17, 1787\n\nInscribed:\n\nFor Jonathan Williams, Esq. from\n\nB[enjamin] Franklin\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\nBetween the Constitution's first draft (this copy belonged to Pierce Butler, delegate from South Carolina) and its final version, a momentous change took place. The separate states became \"We, the People of the United States\" -- Hamilton's idea, Gouverneur Morris's words. In the end, Hamilton was the only delegate from New York to sign the Constitution. This copy of the final edition, printed in Philadelphia especially for the delegates, was owned by Benjamin Franklin, who inscribed it to his nephew, Jonathan Williams.\n\nThe Federalist: A Collection of Essays\n\nWritten in favour of the new Constitution as agreed upon by the Federal Convention, September 17, 1787\n\nAlexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay\n\nFirst edition, 1788 (Vol. I)\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of John Pintard\n\nTo take effect, the Constitution had to be ratified by nine states. Hamilton initially planned 25 pro-Constitution essays, written by himself, James Madison, and John Jay, to appear anonymously in New York newspapers. Eventually 85 essays appeared (Hamilton wrote 51, Madison 29, and Jay 5). Historians credit these essays with turning the tide in favor of ratification in New York and elsewhere. In this\n\nFederalist, first of the series, Hamilton argues that \"[n]othing less than the existence of the UNION... the fate of an empire\" is at stake.\n\nFederal Ship\n\nHamilton\n\nIllustration from\n\nHistory of the City of New York, by Martha Lamb\n\nA. S. Barnes & Co., 1877\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nAfter New York ratified the Constitution in 1788, New York City celebrated with a parade. Hamilton, the Constitution's champion, was honored by a float representing the federal ship\n\nHamilton.\n\nHamilton the Lawyer\n\nHamilton worked as a lawyer, off and on, from the end of the Revolution until the last year of his life. He earned a living, sometimes made himself unpopular, and forged enduring principles of constitutional law.\n\nHamilton's Docket of Legal Cases\n\nFebruary 24, 1784\n\nDocket in the hand of Alexander Hamilton, mounted in bound volume\n\nNew-York Historical Society, Alexander Hamilton Papers\n\nBuilding his postwar legal career, Hamilton took on clients of all kinds, including Loyalists. His notes (\"I appear for defendant\") helped him keep track.\n\nHandwritten notes,\n\nRutgers vs. Waddington, 1784\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nDaniel Burke Library, Hamilton College\n\nThese notes open a window on an historic legal case. After the war, New York passed legislation punishing Loyalists, although the peace treaty forbade it. Hamilton defended Loyalist Joshua Waddington against the suit of Elizabeth Rutgers, a New York patriot. Hamilton urged the court to overrule state laws that violated national treaties -- an opinion that laid the groundwork for judicial review.\n\nCertificate to practice law before U.S. Circuit Court, April 6, 1796\n\nSigned: Edward Dunscomb\n\nLibrary of Congress, Manuscript Division\n\nAfter retiring from the Treasury in 1795, Hamilton returned to the practice of law to support his still-growing family.

Economist\n\nBuilding on his early commercial experience, Hamilton became a brilliant, self-taught economist. America needed him: its load of war debt was crushing. Appointed by President Washington to be the first Treasury Secretary in 1789, Hamilton solved the nation's debt problem and established a modern system of credit, over the bitter objections of less progressive opponents. By the time he retired in 1795, the United States, unlike most emerging nations, was fiscally sound, and poised to become a major financial power.\n\nThe burgeoning economist, his commercial acumen heightened by the financial troubles he saw during the Revolution, read widely on international economics and exchanged ideas with leaders at home and abroad.\n\nNotes made at the back of a payroll record for Captain Alexander Hamilton, New York Artillery Company, August 1776-May 1777\n\nLibrary of Congress, Manuscript Division\n\nEven during wartime, Hamilton educated himself in global commerce, scribbling notes in his artillery company paybook: \"hardware manufactures Birmingham,\" Scottish grain exports to \"Spain Holland Norway,\" \"worsted stockings at Aberdeen.\"\n\nLetter from Alexander Hamilton to Marquis de Barbé-Marbois, October 12, 1780\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\nIn his gloomy letter to a French diplomat, Hamilton expresses frustration at Congress's inability to raise funds for the army: \"The want of money makes us want everything else.\"\n\nRobert Morris (1734-1806)\n\nJohn Wesley Jarvis (1780-1840); after Gilbert Stuart\n\nOil on canvas, c. 1810\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Thomas Morris\n\nThe richest man in America, Robert Morris struggled, as Superintendent of Finance (1781-84), with the nation's debts, frustrated by the government's impotence. He corresponded with Hamilton through the Revolution and recommended Hamilton as first Treasury Secretary.\n\nFinancial Architect\n\nIn 1784, Hamilton helped create the Bank of New York, one of the nation's first private banks. He offered ideas, not money: he owned only one share of stock, but drafted the bank's founding documents and served as its legal adviser.\n\nNortheast corner of Wall and William Streets\n\nArchibald Robertson (1765-1835)\n\nInk, watercolor washes and graphite on paper, 1798\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Sophia Minton\n\nLocated in the heart of New York's business district, the Bank of New York occupied this corner of Wall Street -- the thoroughfare that would become a national symbol of commerce.\n\nPetition for Bank Charter, February 10, 1785\n\nThe Bank of New York Archives\n\nBecause New York's landed gentry wanted a bank based on land rather than money, the state denied Hamilton's Bank of New York a charter.

There, merchants posted prices, struck deals, and swapped gossip.\n\nFirst Treasury Secretary\n\nIn 1790, Treasury Secretary Hamilton presented Congress the\n\nReport on Public Credit and the\n\nReport on a National Bank. He found a way to pay off America's lingering war debts (including assumption by the federal government of the states' debts), and bring the nation into the modern financial era.\n\nHandwritten draft of\n\nFirst Report on the Further Provision Necessary for Establishing Public Credit, c.

The assumption of the debts, a central plank in Hamilton's economic reforms, was essential to the young nation's fiscal health.\n\nOliver Wolcott, Jr. (1760-1833)\n\nGilbert Stuart (1755-1828)\n\nOil on canvas, c. 1820\n\nYale University Art Gallery\n\nGift of George Gibbs\n\nSon of a prominent Connecticut family, Wolcott served Hamilton in the Treasury department, succeeding him as Secretary in 1795.

As a congressman (1795-1801) he criticized Hamilton's policies, though as Secretary of the Treasury (1801-13) he adopted many of them.\n\nA Uniform Currency\n\nIn their first years of independence, Americans conducted business with a bewildering array of coins and currencies. In his\n\nReport on the Mint (1791), Hamilton insisted on \"the uniform preservation of the intrinsic value of the money unit.\" He resolved the chaos into a single strong currency.\n\n\"Exact Table\" of Exchange, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 1765\n\nMuseum of American Financial History, New York City\n\nDuring the colonial period and the early republic, the variety of currencies meant that for trade and travel, Americans needed exchange rate tables such as this.\n\nPaper Money and Coins, various\n\nImage shows a \"pyramid\" of the era's coins, with the Liberty dollar enlarged at left top.\n\nVarious notes of paper money\n\nColony of New York, February 16, 1771\n\nNew York Waterworks, March 5, 1776\n\nState of Pennsylvania, May 20, 1777 and June 1780\n\nMuseum of American Financial History, New York City\n\nBefore Hamilton's appointment to the Treasury in 1789, as these examples suggest, legal tender included notes in many denominations (pounds, shillings, Spanish dollars) issued by various governments and private companies. Spanish money circulated widely in America--this two reales coin was worth one-quarter of a Spanish dollar (or piece of eight). After the Revolution, states minted their own coins, such as this copper from New Jersey, issued from 1786 to 1790. \"Nova Cæsarea\" was the state's Latinate name for itself. And Congress had tried to establish a national currency by issuing coins such as this Fugio Cent - with little success.

Hamilton made no blunders, committed no frauds. He did nothing wrong.\" -- Albert Gallatin to Thomas Jefferson\n\n6. Futurist\n\nAlexander Hamilton, both intensely idealistic and acutely practical, foresaw aspects of American life that lay far in the future. Though he devoted years to business and battle, his best work was the thinking, writing, and planning he did for his adopted nation. The America Hamilton came to was a land of farms, many of them worked by slaves. Hamilton had a different vision. He foresaw a diverse economy, offering opportunity for the full variety of human talents. He respected the faculties of blacks, and worked to end slavery. These visions, expressed during his life, would not be fulfilled until long after his death.\n\nA Spirit of Enterprise\n\nUnlike Jefferson, who idealized agrarian society, Hamilton argued that manufacturing and commerce were also integral to modern economies. Hamilton believed that a diverse economy would make the nation wealthy and fulfill the potential of its citizens.\n\nPassaic Falls, Spring\n\nThomas W. Whitley (active 1835-1863)\n\nOil on panel, c. 1839\n\nFrom the Collections of The New Jersey Historical Society, Newark, New Jersey\n\nTourists went to the falls of the Passaic for the view. Hamilton saw a source of industrial power. In 1791, he helped found the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures, which planned to make Paterson, New Jersey, an industrial city, producing everything from hats to iron wire.\n\nSubscription Book of the\n\nSociety for Establishing Useful Manufactures, circa 1792\n\nCourtesy of the Passaic County Historical Society, Gledhill Collection\n\nThis ledger lists investors in an ambitious venture of Hamilton's to demonstrate America's manufacturing potential (note \"Aaron Burr\"). Using water power, the proposed factories would produce everything from hats to iron wire. Although this particular project failed, Hamilton led his contemporaries in envisioning the future growth of industry in America.\n\nShare of Stock in Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures, c. 1791-92\n\nSigned: William Duer\n\nMuseum of American Financial History, New York City\n\nShares in the S.E.U.M. sold well. The \"governor,\" or director, was William Duer, who had worked under Hamilton in the Treasury Department.\n\nA Vision of Equality\n\nIn Hamilton's time, much of the labor of America, in the North as well as the South, was done by slaves. Hamilton wanted to end this pernicious and degrading institution. Slavery, he wrote as early as 1774, \"relaxes the sinews of industry, clips the wings of commerce, and introduces misery and indigence in every shape.\" In 1785 he helped found the New York Manumission Society.\n\nAlexander Hamilton (1757-1804), 1809\n\nJohn Dixey (active 1789-1820) after bust by Giuseppe Ceracchi\n\nPainted plaster\n\nNew-York Historical Society, Gift of the artist\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826)\n\nJean Antoine Houdon (1741-1828)\n\nPlaster bust, 1789\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of Mrs. Laura Wolcott Gibbs\n\nSlave shackles, c. 1800\n\nWrought iron\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\nShackles from 1800 -- 15 years after the Manumission Society was founded, 24 years after Jefferson wrote \"all men are created equal\" -- designed for a child.\n\nNew York Manumission Society Minutes, January 2, 1785-November 21, 1787\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nIn 1785 Hamilton and 31 other prominent New Yorkers founded the New York Manumission Society, dedicated to ending slavery. Hamilton's name appears in the minutes of the second meeting, February 4, third from the top of the left-hand column. The Society adopted this credo: \"[T]hose, among us, who are held as Slaves... are by Nature, as much entitled as ourselves\" to liberty.\n\nJohn Jay (1745-1829)\n\nJoseph Wright (1756-1793)\n\nOil on canvas, 1786\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nGift of John Pintard\n\nCongressman, diplomat, first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and governor, Jay was a revered figure in New York politics. Hamilton, Jay, and James Madison collaborated on the\n\nFederalist Papers. Jay was also, along with Hamilton, a founder of the New York Manumission Society.\n\nEducation for All\n\nNew-York African Free School Records : Vol. I, Regulations, By-Laws and Reports (1817-1832)\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nNew-York African Free School Records : Vol. IV, Penmanship and Drawing Studies (1816-1826)\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nShortly after its founding, the Manumission Society established the African Free School, which provided practical and moral education for black children and, later, black adults.\n\nThe Manumission Society's work continued after Hamilton's death -- the building erected in 1815 is shown here. In these pages, the supervisors of the African Free School preserved samples of the students' work as a record of the school's progress.\n\nQuotations:\n\n7. The Duel\n\nAffairs of honor -- disputes between gentlemen that sometimes culminated in duels -- were common in late-18th-century America. One signer of the Declaration of Independence and two signers of the Constitution were killed in duels. Men fought duels when they felt their honor had been impugned, and though dueling was illegal, duelists were not prosecuted, since juries would not convict them. Dueling was polite, well-regulated, unjust and barbaric. Hamilton was a principal in seven affairs of honor in his life. The one that ended in a duel, and ended his life, was fought with fellow lawyer and New Yorker, Vice President Aaron Burr.\n\nThe Dispute\n\nIn 1804 the long rivalry between Hamilton and Burr reached a climax. The two men knew each other professionally and socially, and had worked together in the past, but Hamilton considered Burr ambitious and unprincipled -- \"an embryo Caesar.\" Hamilton, who had helped keep Burr out of the White House in 1800, opposed his latest campaign, to be governor of New York. Hamilton, finally, knew that northern Federalists, maddened by the popularity of President Jefferson, were plotting secession -- and that Burr was in touch with them. Then, in April 1804, an inflammatory article appeared in an Albany newspaper.\n\nLetter from Alexander Hamilton\n\nto Harrison G. Otis, December 23, 1800\n\nThe Gilder Lehrman Collection, on deposit at the New-York Historical Society\n\nIn his characteristically regular hand, Hamilton drops a political bombshell. With Jefferson and Burr tied in the presidential election of 1800, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives, Hamilton urged Federalists to back Jefferson: \"In a choice of evils... Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr.\" Burr never forgot who had cost him the presidency.\n\nCorrespondence of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, 1804\n\nCollection of manuscripts, compiled by William Coleman, editor of the\n\nNew-York Evening Post\n\nNew-York Historical Society\n\nIn April 1804, a letter in an Albany newspaper claimed that Hamilton had voiced a \"despicable opinion\" of Burr in conversation. When Burr heard about it, on June 18, he immediately wrote Hamilton, demanding an explanation. Two days later, Hamilton responded. The ensuing correspondence led to their duel.\n\nDraft of Alexander Hamilton's farewell letter to his wife, July 4, 1804\n\nLibrary of Congress, Manuscript Division\n\nKnowing the expected duel could mean his death, Hamilton prepared a letter for his wife, Elizabeth: \"If it had been possible for me to have avoided the interview, my love for you and my precious children would have been alone a decisive motive.

The pistols, which belonged to John Church, Elizabeth Hamilton's brother-in-law, had been used in Hamilton's son Philip's fatal duel three years earlier. Following protocol, the gentlemen stood twenty paces apart, and fired at the command, \"Present.\" Hamilton's shot went high and wide. Burr's pierced Hamilton's abdomen and lodged in his spine.

He was an immigrant, born in poverty and shame. To put his projects into effect, he had to persuade or defy great but often uncomprehending colleagues -- George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison. He was hampered by scandal and controversy, some of it his own fault. He was killed, when he was only 47, in a duel. But through a combination of intelligence, hard work, and high principle, he served his adopted country brilliantly. We live in the world he made.\n\nQuotations:"
