William McDougal in Danville, KY, and cannot find him in the KY census prior to his death in 1854.\n\nThis summer, I visited Danville, KY.There is no Cemetery on the campus of Center College, however there is an old Presbyterian Cemetery on the grounds of the Presbyterian Church on West Main, about a block from the Center College campus.\n\nUnfortunately, although there were many graves which are marked \"unknown\", there is no record of a William McDougal buried either in the Presbyterian Cemetery or the Bellvue Cemetery, which is the other old Cemetery located in Danville.\n\nI am beginning to doubt this story about Rev. McDougal living to be 104 and being buried in Danville.\n\nNotes for Catharine Jane Brand:\n\nFrank BRAND, in his BRAND book, gives the birth date of Sarah as @ 1775.\n\nThe Musgrave records Catherine Jane's sister, Elizabeth Brand married Samuel Musgrave shows Margaret's year of as 1780.\n\nChildren of William McDougal and Catharine Brand are:\n\n+ 2 i.

(22).\n\nThe census states that only 3 of the 5 original Crouser children were still living. This doesn't seem to agree with other Family records.\n\nCurtis was still single and living at home with his parents when the 1910 census was taken of Marion Co., WV. . He was not assigned a profession either, unusual for a son of 38 years.\n\nJames was born just in time for the 1880 census. He was listed as one month old.

Mary was listed with her 2 remaining sons, Arthur D. (13) and Lionel E. (9), in the 1910 census of Marion Co., WV.\n\nAltogether, the census declares, they had 9 children of which 6 were living in 1910. This seems highly improbably, since only 6 children were known to have been born to the 3 wives of James.\n\nJames M.
