        "text": "The nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) has grown rapidly since it was formed in 2013 and is now the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag (national parliament), with 89 seats.\n\nFounded in 2013 as an anti-euro party, it has shifted its focus to immigration and Islam and is increasingly seen as far-right in tone.\n\nYes. It may not have started out as a far-right party but it soon embraced far-right policies and many of its leaders have espoused far-right rhetoric.\n\nAfD co-chairman Alexander Alexander Gauland has talked of fighting an \"invasion of foreigners\" and the party openly focuses on Islam and migration, seeing Islam as alien to German society. Some of the party's rhetoric has been tinged with Nazi overtones.\n\nThe AfD sits in the same political family as France's far-right National Front and Austria's far-right Freedom Party - as well as the populist, anti-Islam Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) of Geert Wilders. Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK's anti-EU party Ukip, took part in their 2017 election campaign.\n\nThe party's leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, once described Berlin's Holocaust memorial as a \"monument of shame\" and called for a \"180-degree turnaround\" in Germany's handling of its Nazi past. Picking up the same theme, Alexander Gauland trivialised the Nazi era as \"just a speck of bird's muck in more than 1,000 years of successful Germany history\".\n\nThe AfD has managed to attract voters from the centre right and even the centre left but in the words of Verena Hartmann, a moderate MP who left the party in January 2020 because it was becoming to extreme: \"Those who resist this extreme right-wing movement are mercilessly pushed out of the party.\"\n\nIn the words of Matthias Quent, a German expert on the far right based in Thuringia: \"Not everyone in the AfD is ideologically far right, but anyone in the party or even voting for the party is supporting a party that has a far-right objective.\"\n\nAlice Weidel is a 41-year-old economist who divides her time between Berlin and Switzerland, where she lives with a woman adopted as a child from Sri Lanka and their two children.\n\nShe is one of a small number of women in prominent positions in the AfD and argues that her presence as one of its top candidates proves the party is not homophobic.\n\nAlexander Gauland, a 78-year old lawyer, has been with AfD from its Eurosceptic start and his political career began decades earlier with the centre right.\n\nAs AfD moved to the right so did he, making a number of remarks condemned as racist. In 2016 he talked about footballer JÃ©rÃ´me Boateng, who was born in Berlin to a Ghanaian father. \"[Germans] like him as a football player. But they don't want to have a Boateng as their neighbour.\"\n\nBjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, AfD's party leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, has been behind some of its biggest controversies. He is also seen as an inspiration to many of the MPs elected to the Bundestag in 2017 and heads a stridently nationalist group called FlÃ¼gel. He helped AfD in Thuringia push the centre right into third place in state elections in October 2019.\n\nWhen he criticised the idea of a Holocaust memorial in the heart of German capital, the party moved to expel him but apparently changed its mind.\n\nMr HÃ¶cke helped trigger a national crisis in February 2020 by helping a liberal candidate become state premier in Thuringia. Not since World War Two had the far right played kingmaker in German politics.\n\nThe AfD's big success came in challenging Angela Merkel's decision to let in around 1.3 million undocumented migrants and refugees, mainly from the Middle East, from 2015.\n\nThey tapped into anxieties over the influence of Islam, calling for a commission to investigate the chancellor's \"breaches of the law\" in allowing them in.\n\nThe party made the influx the focus of its party platform. There were contacts with the anti-immigration Pegida movement, which staged weekly marches against what it called \"the Islamisation of the West\".\n\nPegida took hold mainly in eastern cities such as Dresden, and it is in the ex-communist east that the AfD has had its biggest successes, attracting more men than any other party. Odd perhaps, in that the biggest concentrations of immigrants are not in those areas.\n\nAfD has come a long way since it was launched in early 2013 to challenge eurozone bailouts in Greece and elsewhere, and reject the EU's arguments for keeping the euro.\n\nIt still promises to abandon the euro and reintroduce the Deutschmark.\n\nBut its first leader, Bernd Lucke, left the party in 2015, arguing that it was becoming increasingly xenophobic.\n\nIts anti-euro policy echoes the Euroscepticism of other populist parties in Europe.\n\nIf the EU fails to reform and continues centralising, the AfD says, the party will seek to pull Germany out of the EU."
