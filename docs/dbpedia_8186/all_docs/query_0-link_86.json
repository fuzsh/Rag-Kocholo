        "text": "3\n\nNAUGHTY BERLIN? NEW WOMEN, NEW SPACES, AND EROTIC CONFUSION\n\nIf traditional bourgeois morality and social structures came under fire in Wilhelmine Berlin, then the First World War, the political revolution of 1918 and 1919, and the inflation years that followed “destroyed conventional notions of respectability and faith in authority.” Turn-of-the-century activism on the part of social reformers and progressive feminists certainly laid the groundwork for change, making modest inroads toward marital reform and calling bourgeois moral conventions into question. In Berlin, many of the key participants in the debates on prostitution and sexual mores—August Bebel, Anna Pappritz, Helene Stöcker, and Magnus Hirschfeld, just to name a few—remained the same before and after the war. But as Hirschfeld openly admitted, the war acted as a catalyst, speeding up the changes that had slowly begun to take place during the Wilhelmine era. Two million German men lost their lives to the violence of modern warfare, nearly one-third of whom were married. The war, with its unprecedented casualties and its immense social upheaval, dealt a devastating blow to the bourgeois family, its gendered division of labor, and its restrictive sexual standards. In so doing, the First World War created, in Hirschfeld’s words, “a moral vacuum where experiments could be carried out.” The grandest sociopolitical experiment of all was Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic, which was founded in the wake of wartime devastation.\n\nThe war caused a proliferation in public roles for women, particularly in urban industrial centers like Berlin. With millions of German men between the ages of seventeen and forty-five enlisted in the armed services, women were propelled out of the realm of the family and into jobs in offices and factories that had previously been filled by men. As Belinda Davis has shown, women in the capital city organized demonstrations and strikes in order to protest food shortages and the state’s inability to provide for its citizens on the home front, actions that caused “a broad population of Germans” to see women “as the ‘protagonists’ in the social and political conflict that marked the era.” Looking back at the war and the advent of the Weimar Republic from the perspective of the republic’s final years, the social commentator and cultural critic Curt Moreck described the drastic changes in gender roles caused by the First World War: “With father and son torn from the family by the call to arms, mother and daughter were compelled to work with their hands. Through the urgent call to labor, through the fight for their daily bread, mother and daughter joined the ranks of working men.” The changes wrought by women becoming more active and visible in the workplace, however, were not limited to shifts in women’s social roles. Such transformations also resulted in reconfigurations of social space.\n\nIn Moreck’s view, the increased contact between men and women in spaces devoted to work and play heightened the sense of collegiality and camaraderie between them and signified a clear departure from the gendered division of labor and leisure of the Wilhelmine era. As he portrayed the situation, women had earned their right to take advantage of metropolitan nightlife: “They stood side by side with the man in the factories, in the offices, and at the machines; and through him they became acquainted with various places of pleasure…and in his company they spent their hours of leisure, in need of distraction: in the cafés, pubs, liquor lounges, and bars.” Untainted by any sense of threat or resentment toward their new colleagues, the “working men” in Moreck’s synopsis played a significant role in introducing women to spaces that were previously closed off to them, particularly urban entertainment venues. It was “through” the man and “in his company” that a Weimar woman gained legitimate access to cafés and taverns, spaces that in the pre-Weimar era had been generally considered to be sites of sexual solicitation for prostitutes. Exploring the interdependence of spatial proximity and the democratization of gender, Moreck goes on to describe women as both “masculinized” and “eroticized” by their experience of public life, and he defines the “feminization” of men in post–World War I Germany as a necessary step toward the social and sexual “emancipation” of both men and women. Here, emancipation implies not just the transgression of traditional gender roles but also experimentation with sexual intimacy that transcended the institutions of marriage and prostitution. As both Atina Grossmann and Annette Timm document in their work on sex reform, the majority of young Weimar Berliners who visited “eugenic counseling centers” in the capital city did so more for free birth control and sex advice than for eugenic screening or health certificates, and many doctors who worked at the centers “promoted a particular vision of responsible companionate heterosexuality.”\n\nAs a result of the more freewheeling female sexuality of the Weimar Republic and the growing social acceptance of companionate relationships, Moreck suggests that “prostitution traditionally defined—as the old form of trading ‘love’ for cash on the more or less public markets—lost significance.” But what exactly does Moreck mean by this? Does prostitution become obsolete once female sexuality is less restricted by bourgeois morality, or does it merely lose its ability to mark illicit sexuality? It could certainly be argued that prostitution had already taken on myriad meanings during the Wilhelmine era, when social reform discourses used prostitution as a site for critical discussions of female sexuality, agency, marriage, and respectability. What seems to concern Moreck is the increase in public forms of erotic intimacy or “love trades” in Weimar society that makes it nearly impossible to distinguish between professional prostitutes and other sexually active women. As Daphne Spain postulates in her book Gendered Spaces, the “spatial integration” of men and women constitutes “a route to higher status of women,” but how is women’s status affected by the act of occupying spaces that are historically associated with commodified female sexuality? Instead of prostitution losing significance, the meanings attributed to prostitutes and sites of prostitution multiply and become increasingly complex in the cultural discourses of the Weimar Republic. Moreck’s own work provides an example of this. In his essays in Magnus Hirschfeld’s multivolume moral histories of the First World War and the interwar period, in his own moral histories of film and Weimar society, and in his 1931 Führer durch das “lasterhafte” Berlin (Guide to “Naughty” Berlin), Moreck offered readers a broad range of images of prostitutes and emancipated women, and he often deliberately conflated the two. As Moreck’s texts and the diverse cultural phenomena examined in this chapter demonstrate, the obvious public presence of women in Weimar Berlin met with a variety of responses, many of which intertwined cultural discourses of sexually and financially emancipated womanhood with those about prostitutes, thereby creating “the elision of the woman on the street with the woman of the street.”\n\nIndeed the proliferation of public roles for women was concurrent with a proliferation of discourses on prostitutes. With class divisions and gender roles destabilized by the war and ensuing inflation, Weimar Berlin replaced Paris as the European capital of sexual experimentation and display, and prostitutes—both real and imagined—were central figures in the metropolis’s bawdy entertainment culture. Images of prostitutes pervaded visual and popular culture in Berlin; they could be seen on stage at the city’s numerous cabarets, revues, and theaters and on movie screens, posters, and postcards. During the revolution, as public officials and health-care professionals debated the future of regulated prostitution, Berlin’s prostitutes organized to form support organizations like the Hilfsbund der Berliner Prostituierten (Auxiliary Club of Berlin Prostitutes), where they discussed “issues such as prices, competition, the conduct of the police and physicians, and effective protections against professional hazards.” Along with the increased cultural currency and social activism of prostitutes came the eroticization of the younger generation of bourgeois and petit-bourgeois women. Some of these women had grown up during the war with a father at the front and a mother who worked in the war industry or stood in line for hours waiting for food rations, while others had entered the workforce prematurely to help support their families. Some saw their family’s financial security evaporate during the years of inflation and hyperinflation, when reversals of fortune became the order of the day. Many experienced their bodies differently, feeling the pangs of hunger and the effects of malnutrition for the first time, but they also learned to see their bodies as sources of labor and perhaps even as desirable commodities that could help them survive the years of upheaval. With bourgeois respectability compromised, fascination with the so-called sexual underworld grew as middle-class patrons and the nouveaux riches went “slumming” in Berlin’s many dive bars and Tingeltangels. The city streets that Walter Benjamin describes as clearly marked by the “sign of prostitution” during his childhood in Wilhelmine Berlin were also traversed, during the Weimar era, by other women on their way to work or to urban entertainment venues such as the café or cinema. In other words, just as prostitutes seemed to inhabit more public spaces than ever before, working women from bourgeois backgrounds were increasingly occupying spaces that before the war were considered to be the exclusive domain of the prostitute.\n\nIn contrast to Moreck’s depiction of men who invited and welcomed women into the public sphere, some other male observers saw the increased public presence of women in Weimar Berlin as an alarming trend, and the image of the prostitute was evoked as a way of criticizing this change. When they encountered financially and sexually independent women in spaces traditionally associated with sexual exchange, these men failed to see women as “an increasingly autonomous and observing presence.” Instead they simply saw whores. Journalist Thomas Wehrling’s 1920 article “Berlin Is Becoming a Whore,” for example, creates an image of Berlin’s public spaces as “overrun” by corrupt, permissive women who once hailed from respectable bourgeois households. Wehrling calls for “strong, sustaining men” to bring these women back to their senses and back into the private space of the home—a call that clearly reflects a discourse of postwar anxiety concerning female sexual autonomy and male weakness. Readers familiar with Maria Tatar’s study Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany could easily interpret Wehrling’s vicious verbal assault on the women of Berlin as a “strategy for managing certain kinds of sexual, social, and political anxieties.” Tatar argues that this strategy was used by Weimar men who perceived themselves to be victims—of war, disease, the whims of the economy—to retaliate against their imagined enemies: women. Only the destruction of the erotic woman would allow the male subject to reassert himself. With brushstrokes performing slashes of the knife, the artists George Grosz and Otto Dix enacted aesthetic revenge on erotic women in their Lustmord paintings of the early 1920s, and this revenge was read as justifiable murder. According to Tatar, if “the victims are prostitutes—women marked with the signs of corrupt and corrupting sexuality—the killer is not infrequently judged to be a normal person provoked to an act of violence or his victims are seen as complicitous in their murders.” In this analysis, the two most common depictions of prostitutes, that of the threatening femme fatale and that of the victim, are collapsed. The former provokes male violence while the latter falls prey to it.\n\nIt is not the aim of this chapter to simply add to Tatar’s discourse on the prostitute and emancipated women as objects of male fear and anxiety, although it is certainly worth noting that she often conflates the two without critical consideration. I examine instead the complexities of this conflation of prostitute and “New Woman” and pose the following questions: Did the sexually freewheeling atmosphere of Weimar Berlin actually make the overt expression of female desire and financial independence more socially acceptable? Or did the lack of a social code for distinguishing sexually aggressive working women from paid prostitutes cause all publicly visible women simply to be marked as prostitutes? The latter is clearly the case in Wehrling’s indictment of Berlin’s “whores.” By invoking the image of the prostitute as a method of insult, however, Wehrling’s text demonstrates the prostitute’s potential power to act as a social irritant and indicator of change. Offering an alternative to Tatar’s morbid conclusions in her research on prostitution in the Weimar Republic, Julia Roos asserts: “To view Weimar’s economic and political crises solely from the vantage point of their negative impacts on women’s emancipation is problematic. Such an analytical perspective risks obscuring consequential shifts in conventional power relationships between the sexes during the Weimar period.” The concepts of crisis and male anxiety so prominent in studies of gender and sexuality in the Weimar era have recently been reexamined and evaluated more positively by scholars such as Roos, Kathleen Canning, and Richard W. McCormick, who claims that “what ought to be celebrated includes precisely that which has been derided as decadence and ‘effeminate weakness’ by many writers.” By thematizing male crisis, McCormick argues, many Weimar artists and writers openly acknowledged “the blurring of traditionally gendered roles and behavior.” Prostitutes were also central figures in the debates surrounding such palpable changes in gender roles, and this chapter therefore maps a range of cultural discourses on prostitutes and emancipated womanhood that link the two in more complex ways, some of which present obstacles to women’s autonomy and some of which move beyond misogynistic representations of public women and beyond images of prostitutes as mere “fantastic ciphers of debauchery.” Such blending and blurring of prostitutes and New Women connect the popular image of the cocotte, a prostitute who looks and acts like a respectable woman, with a new kind of coquette, a seemingly respectable woman who looks and acts like a prostitute, both of whom occupied public spaces in Weimar Berlin.\n\nClose analysis of Weimar-era texts that explore spaces of public contact between male cultural critics and young working women reveals what Spain describes as “the reciprocity between the social construction of space and the spatial construction of social relations.” While Spain’s discussion of the “spatial construction of social relations” is primarily concerned with the actual building practices that serve to either prevent or enable gender integration, my argument focuses on how the imagined meaning of particular urban spaces gets grafted on those who occupy such spaces, particularly when those occupants are women. This is most striking in the case of the cinema, one of the spaces most highly theorized in cultural criticism by Weimar intellectuals such as Siegfried Kracauer and in current scholarship on the Weimar Republic. Critics’ skepticism toward the new mass medium of film reveals itself most clearly in their disparagement of filmgoers themselves, who, more often than not, were imagined to be women. The controversy surrounding the popular hygiene films (Aufklärungsfilme) at the advent of the republic exemplifies how political debates concerning the reinstatement of artistic censorship, aesthetic discussions of the competing media of film and theater, and social discourses on prostitution and female sexuality became intertwined. After engaging with gendered representations of cinematic space, I turn to the more ambiguous and less often theorized spaces of the street, cabaret, club, and café, spaces that seem to offer greater possibilities for the construction of female agency and emancipated sexual relations, opportunities for the “social construction of space.”\n\nAlthough, with the notable exception of visual artworks by Jeanne Mammen, most of the works I use to access these spaces are produced by men, my approach to these texts recognizes subtle gradations and what Susan S. Friedman calls the “presence of hybridity” within seemingly hegemonic discourses. Friedman encourages critical readings that question to what degree the author’s own gender identification may or may not influence how gender and sexuality are represented in his or her texts. Thus, in what follows, texts by modern male writers and leftist intellectuals such as Bertolt Brecht, Magnus Hirschfeld, Siegfried Kracauer, Kurt Tucholsky, and Curt Moreck that represent urban spaces and the women who inhabit them can be read to express both men’s anxiety in regard to women’s emancipation and their acknowledgment or even celebration of it.\n\nSpace of Anxious Encounter: The Cinema\n\nEven before the First World War and the Weimar Republic, modernist author Alfred Döblin marked the cinema as a feminized and eroticized space. In his essay “Das Theater der kleinen Leute” (The Theater of the Little People, 1909), Döblin remarks on the predominantly working-class audience, the “couples making out in the background,” the “children wheezing with consumption,” and the “heavily made-up prostitutes leaning forward, forgetting to adjust their scarves.” The prostitutes are depicted as completely absorbed viewers, so absorbed in the filmic spectacle that their slipping scarves expose their cleavage to the audience members around them, reminding observers such as Döblin of their sexualized bodies. Their unveiled eroticism combined with their implicitly uncritical viewing of the filmic narrative make them, in Döblin’s analysis, one with both the medium of film and the space of the cinema. Miriam Hansen convincingly reads Döblin’s use of the image of the prostitute as “an epithet for the cinema as a whole.” In his essay, she argues, prostitutes represent both the mass audience and the mass medium of film, “an openly commercial (‘venal’) art.” The permissive atmosphere of the cinema was underscored by its darkness; hence the disappearance of the physical space of the viewing room opened up a spatial imaginary, in which authors such as Döblin could connect the medium with whom he imagined to be its viewers. In fact, although Döblin portrays the prewar audience as proletarian, research into the social composition of Wilhelmine film audiences shows that they were made up of “women of diverse backgrounds, the ‘little people,’ the workers, and salaried employees.” Such findings show that even before the lavish film palaces of the 1920s were built to accommodate mass audiences, there was a significant degree of social mixing that occurred in the cinematic space. Hence, despite its temporal context, Döblin’s critical notes on cinema can be read on a continuum with Weimar-era essays by Bertolt Brecht and Siegfried Kracauer, in which discourses on the cinema, sexuality, and women—be they prostitutes or salaried employees—converge.\n\nWith the lifting of film censorship in November 1918, prostitutes became a pervasive cultural presence on the movie screens of Weimar Berlin and throughout Germany. The entertainment industry capitalized on the visual appeal of the prostitute, and this appeal concerned male cultural critics as they sat in the cinema and speculated about the effects that the popular social hygiene film (Aufklärungsfilm) might have on its female viewers. Aufklärungsfilme were sex education films that emerged amid the chaos of the First World War and employed a unique blend of titillation and education to warn the German populace of the dangers of venereal diseases, alcoholism, and prostitution. The use of film to educate the masses signaled a media shift within the public health, or social hygiene, movement, which before the war had limited itself to lectures and pamphlets. During the war, organizations such as the DGBG and institutions such as Karl Lingner’s German Hygiene Museum in Dresden sought to harness the power of the visual image by organizing traveling hygiene exhibits, staging theatrical productions, and making short documentary films (Lehrfilme) that were usually shown to target audiences such as enlisted soldiers. As the rate of venereal disease spiked toward the end of the war, the Lehrfilme were shown to a broader audience, serving as public service documentaries that immediately preceded feature films. While the public was initially both fascinated and repulsed by the images of diseased bodies presented in such works, they were quickly bored by the dry, factual, scientific tone of the Lehrfilme. It was the filmmaker Richard Oswald who realized that hygiene films first had to appeal to the viewing public before they could educate them, and in 1917 he teamed up with the DGBG’s Alfred Blaschko to make the first feature-length social melodrama on venereal disease, Es werde Licht! (Let There Be Light!). The film’s title, with its blatant call for illumination, directly linked Oswald’s project with the enlightenment, or Aufklärung, of its audience. Its critical and popular success served to associate Oswald himself with the Aufklärungsfilm, for better or worse, for the rest of his career.\n\nDuring the final months of the war and within six months of the lifting of censorship, Oswald and the Berlin sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld raised eyebrows and tempers by collaborating on three controversial hygiene films, Sündige Mütter (Strafgesetz, §218) (Sinful Mothers [Penal Code §218]), Die Prostitution (Prostitution), and Anders als die Andern (Different from the Others). With illegal abortion, prostitution, and homosexuality as their respective topics, these films challenged the German state’s right to legislate sexual behavior. The topics of the three film projects undertaken by Oswald and Hirschfeld in 1918 and 1919 were clearly aligned with the goals of the sex reform movement, goals that had already been articulated in the Wilhelmine era. Sinful Mothers criticized antiabortion law by implying that it drives women to have back-alley abortions with fatal results. Different from the Others boldly called for the removal of laws penalizing homosexuals by concluding with a scene in which Hirschfeld’s hand crosses §175 out of the law book for the new republic. Prostitution is a film whose story depicts the downfall of a woman who has chosen prostitution, but the film’s plot is introduced by and concludes with a fictional trial of prostitution itself. The defendant, an erotic woman with long, tousled hair, personifies the institution of prostitution. At the end of the trial, she sinks to her knees in relief, and the final words of the film read: “Prostitution is acquitted. We want to help to relieve need, to create humane laws, for we have no right to judge.”\n\nThe freeing of prostitution from the realm of the court in Prostitution can be interpreted as a plea against the system of state regulation, a system already under serious attack since the turn of the century. In the wake of the First World War, the protests of abolitionists intensified, and their base of support grew. Oswald and Hirschfeld’s film on prostitution signifies an important moment in this antiregulation discourse, for its release coincided with a number of public debates on the issue of prostitutes’ rights and the abolition of state regulation. In the spring of 1919, liberal politicians in Berlin petitioned the city government to take away the punitive powers of the vice squad and place prostitutes under the protection of a Municipal Welfare and Rescue Center, an idea that was subsequently championed by the Berlin magistrate in a letter to the Prussian State Assembly. Sex reformers and left-liberal politicians alike envisioned an alternative to legal regulation that would decriminalize prostitution and allow prostitutes access to private health care, provisions that were later included in the Law to Combat Venereal Diseases, passed in 1927. The most marked contributors to this discussion, however, were prostitutes themselves, who organized several mass meetings of prostitutes, pimps, and interested citizens in Berlin to rally for basic rights to privacy and unhindered mobility and to form the Auxiliary Club of Berlin Prostitutes, complete with membership cards and fees (fig. 8). Among the supporters whom the prostitutes elected to the executive council of this new organization was none other than Hirschfeld himself.\n\nWhile it is certainly fitting to view Oswald and Hirschfeld’s film in the broader context of human rights activism and sex reform in the nascent democratic culture of the Weimar Republic, it is impossible to ignore the fact that there were medical professionals, intellectuals, and politicians spanning the range of the political spectrum who accused Oswald and Hirschfeld of commercializing sexuality for the prurient masses. The popularity of the Oswald/Hirschfeld films, particularly with urban audiences, spawned an entire crop of films by lesser-known directors with titles meant to both allure and horrify: Das Gift im Weibe (The Poison in Woman, 1919), Hyänen der Lust (Hyenas of Lust, 1919), and Im Rausche der Sinne (Intoxicated with Sensuality, 1920), to name just a few. Although most film critics of the day raved about Oswald’s film Prostitution, public officials excoriated it as the prototype for the multitude of sex-themed films that followed its release, works that members of the leftist Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) simply labeled as exploitative “prostitution films” and defined as a “cultural disgrace of the highest order.” In the German parliamentary debates on film censorship, the liberal representative of the German Democratic Party (DDP), Paul Ende, cited an anonymous literary critic who compared the permissive atmosphere of German cinemas with brothels. This conflation of cinema and brothel, of film and prostitution, so reminiscent of Döblin’s essay, is symptomatic of how criticism of specific films such as Oswald’s Prostitution became unhinged from the individual works themselves to form a larger discourse, in which representatives from the political, scientific, and cultural fields vied for control over both the body politic and the new cinematic medium.\n\nFigure 8. Membership Card, Hilfsbund der Berliner Prostituierten, ca. 1919. Courtesy of Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft.\n\nOne of the most common criticisms leveled against Prostitution at the time of its release was that it presented prostitution not as dangerous and demeaning but as glamorous and inviting. In his 1920 study offering guidelines for the proper use of film in the social hygienic education of the masses, the medical doctor Waldemar Schweisheimer expressed his incredulity about the fact that Oswald’s film made no mention of the connection between prostitution and venereal diseases. Before Schweisheimer’s study even appeared, however, cultural critics including the young playwright Bertolt Brecht and the satirist Kurt Tucholsky had already voiced their concerns about the film, claiming that the scenes set in the brothel “do not deter, but rather, at the very least, excite.” The glamorized image of the prostitute was indeed used to promote social hygiene films such as Oswald and Hirschfeld’s production, as one can see from the film poster for Prostitution (fig. 9). The poster shows a slim, attractive woman in a low-cut, yet tasteful gown placed in front of throngs of admiring gentlemen. Her heavy makeup and sunken eyes are the only physical markers that betray her profession and imply her possible sickness. The only other clue to her potential deadliness is the skeleton-like face in the lower far right corner of the poster, yet this is nearly hidden in the crowd of adoring men’s faces. The prostitute herself looks not at her admirers, but at the poster’s viewer, beckoning with a seductive look. Viewing this poster, one could see why Brecht and Tucholsky accuse the film of promoting prostitution. However, today’s scholars of the Aufklärungsfilme remind us that while the films’ sensationalistic advertising materials (titles, posters) may fit the popular appeal of sex in the early Weimar Republic, they rarely have much to do with the actual plot of the films they represent. Indeed a brief review of Prostitution in one of Berlin’s daily newspapers praises the film, its director, and its actors for treating this potentially sensational topic with “tact and taste.” The narrative constructed by Oswald seems to do little to entice its viewers into prostitution, especially when one considers the fates of the main female protagonists.\n\nFigure 9.

Oswald depicts the sisters as clear opposites in both appearance and character; Hedwig (Gussy Holl) is the good sister—a sweet, demure, and hardworking secretary—while Lona (Anita Berber) is the bad sister who seduces her sister’s boss, Alfred Werner (Conrad Veidt), and then leaves him for a career as a prostitute in a luxury brothel. When Alfred goes to the brothel to retrieve Lona, he finds Hedwig there instead, who was, through the complicity of her own father, drugged, abducted, and brought to the brothel against her will. Struggling against the advances of her first potential “John,” Hedwig is aided by Alfred, who fights off the man and rescues her. Hedwig and Alfred find happiness together and get married, while Lona slides further into ruin. She works in the brothel until the madam casts her out, and once she is back on the street, she turns to another former lover Karl Döring (Reinhold Schünzel), who promptly becomes her pimp. Lona prostitutes herself willingly for Döring until she meets her grim end at the hands of a Lustmörder (sexual murderer) played by Werner Krauß (fig. 10). By organizing the plot around the fates of an opposing pair of sisters, one of whom finds marital bliss and one of whom is murdered, Oswald relies on a tried-and-true narrative formula: in the end, good is rewarded, and evil is punished. The familiar paradigm of good versus evil, Oswald himself argued, was crucial to educating the general public, which would be more apt to follow the path of the good character and read the punishment of the evil character as a clear warning against similar behavior. He wrote specifically about how filmmakers should portray prostitutes in such a way that would strike fear in the hearts of female viewers and actively deter them from following the same path.\n\nFigure 10. Promotional postcard, Anita Berber and Werner Krauß in Richard Oswald’s Die Prostitution, 1919. Courtesy of Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv.\n\nThe figure of the Lustmörder is instrumental to Oswald’s goal of deterrence. With a nod to his own beginnings in the theater, Oswald finishes off the prostitute Lona in the same way that Frank Wedekind offs the notorious social-climbing whore Lulu in his 1892 play Die Büchse der Pandora (Pandora’s Box): with the knife of a Jack-the-Ripper character. The Lustmörder, who, incidentally, always goes free, can be read as Tatar would interpret him—as the ultimate vigilante who enacts justice by removing the dangerous erotic woman from society. However, Oswald’s film—much like Hirschfeld’s writings on the topic, which, in some cases, validated Lombroso’s theory of the “born prostitute” and yet, in others, acknowledged the importance of socioeconomic factors in women’s entrance into prostitution—remains ambivalent regarding the question of the causes of prostitution. Is Lona, like Lulu, driven by an innately corrupt sexuality, or is she a victim of the social ills of prostitution (i.e., poverty and an alcoholic father)? Is she the dangerous woman, or does the danger lie in the institution of prostitution itself? The arrest of Karl Döring, Lona’s lover and pimp, at the end of the main narrative suggests that gender and economic relations are somehow culpable, yet the film leaves these questions unanswered. Still, its ominous message rings clear: prostitution is an ill-fated enterprise. In contrast to the trial scene and its acquittal of prostitution, the film’s main narrative delivers a wholesale condemnation of prostitution, and with it, of the prostitute herself. By placing the good sister in a happy marriage and the incorrigible prostitute in the grave, the message of the film is ultimately a conservative one and supports Malte Hagener’s and Jan Hans’s description of the social hygiene film as “an unprocessed relic from the Wilhelmine era,” in which “alternative lifestyles…are punished and shown to be deviant.”\n\nDespite Prostitution’s grim ending, however, critics of the film such as Schweisheimer claimed that even Lona’s brutal death did not trump the film’s glamorous (he uses the word glänzend) depiction of her life in the brothel. Conflating the “shimmering nightclubs” depicted in the film with the bourgeois film palaces of the Weimar Republic, Bertolt Brecht also imagined how the on-screen action would translate into the real-life seduction of the women in the audience. Paying no attention to the on-screen secretary Hedwig, who successfully resists the sexual advances of the men in the brothel, Brecht was more concerned with the secretaries in the audience: “The young girls sitting in the cinema, most often next to the young man who bought their ticket, are enlightened to the fact that refusal…is pointless…. All the bosses are infused with male desire and pour their secretaries wine; there are no objections allowed.” In Brecht’s view, the message conveyed to women by the Aufklärungsfilm is one of nonresistance; it is best to accept the movie ticket from one’s boyfriend or the glass of wine from one’s boss and give him what he expects in return. In other words, Brecht’s essay blurs the line between the fictional prostitute in the film and those women the author imagines as her viewers, for both allow themselves not simply to be seduced but to be bought. Brecht’s “concern” for the young women’s personal welfare was echoed in more tempered terms by Tucholsky, who suggested that if sex education were truly the goal, then the most appropriate vehicle would be a scientific lecture, delivered separately to same-sex audiences. But it was Schweisheimer who argued the point in the starkest terms: Aufklärungsfilme had become “pornographic films” (Animierfilme) that encouraged premarital copulation and accelerated the spread of venereal disease. In these texts by Schweisheimer, Brecht, and Tucholsky, the social space of the movie theater becomes a veritable den of iniquity that bears a striking resemblance to Döblin’s vision of the prewar cinema.\n\nReading these men’s arguments, it is clear that their critique of Oswald’s film has less to do with the film itself and more to do with their views on its female spectators and with social anxiety regarding female sexuality. In fact, Schweisheimer’s and Brecht’s scant or inaccurate mention of Prostitution’s plot insinuates that they probably had not even seen the film but rather based their accounts of it on hearsay. Schweisheimer even has recourse to an urban legend published in Die Weltbühne about a man who boasted of how easily he seduced a sixteen-year-old girl in the cinema after he noticed that the Aufklärungsfilm had aroused her. The same anecdote also circulated on the floor of the German parliament during the debates on film censorship. Oswald’s particular film on prostitution functioned, then, as a springboard for a more general critique of an entire filmic genre, the Aufklärungsfilm, and its presumably negative social effects on women. The concern expressed by Brecht, Schweisheimer, and Weimar politicians alike for the well-being of young women only thinly veils their anxiety over an active form of female sexuality that falls outside of the social institutions of marriage and prostitution. Portraying female film viewers as dupes or even potential victims of wily seducers seems far more palatable to them than portraying the women in the audience as socially savvy—cognizant of their own desirability and the advantages that desirability might offer them.\n\nThe biting criticism of the social hygiene films anticipates the feuilleton writings of Siegfried Kracauer, who also sat in the darkness of the cinema with his eyes and mind on female audience members, and who wrote one of the defining essays on film spectatorship, “Die kleinen Ladenmädchen gehen ins Kino” (The Little Shopgirls Go to the Movies, 1927). In Kracauer’s work the moviegoers are nearly identical to the “young girls” and “secretaries” in Brecht’s text; their designation as “little shopgirls” is meant to signify their limited education and gullibility. Kracauer portrays them as easily duped; they are naive girls who confuse film with reality, perceiving adventure films as true getaways or believing in fairy-tale endings filled with riches and romance. The cinema offers them a temporary escape from the drudgery of their lives tending shop, an escape that allows them to dream or cry for a few hours without critical thought or reflection. Kracauer observes the shopgirls as they dab tears from their cheeks, and remarks: “Crying is sometimes easier than contemplation.” Their rapt attention betrays their inaction. Instead of inspiring social or political activity among the girls, the escape to the cinema simply perpetuates other forms of escape by encouraging the female audience members to visit dance halls and search for wealthy men. Kracauer remarks: “No film without a danceclub, no tuxedo without money. Otherwise women would not put on and take off their pants. The business is called eroticism, and the preoccupation with it is called life.” By holding out the hope of a financially advantageous relationship, the films keep the shopgirls content with their monotonous jobs and meager paychecks. Help, in the form of a rich cavalier, is on the way.\n\nAnticipating Kracauer’s explication of the shopgirls’ passivity is pivotal to an understanding of how Brecht and Tucholsky depart from Schweisheimer in their critique of the Aufklärungsfilme. The real crux of Brecht’s and Tucholsky’s respective arguments is not that hygiene films should be indicting prostitution as a danger to public health, as Schweisheimer maintains. Their concerns are more of a cultural and political nature; put simply, they chastise both the film audience and the filmmakers for choosing sex and profits over political action. After all, the repeal of censorship laws in 1918 gave leftist intellectuals like Brecht and Tucholsky hope that the cinema would become a platform for diverse political voices. This hope was dashed by the immense popularity of the hygiene films and the financial success they brought to their creators. As Brecht ironically states in the final sentence of his essay, “Business is booming, Prostitution is extended by ‘popular demand,’ and freedom is the best of all circumstances.” Tucholsky, too, laments that the people have been duped while “the false friends of the people make money.” In their respective essays, prostitution takes on a double meaning. It is both the title of Oswald’s film and a cipher for the mass medium of film, whose existence is based on selling sex for money. Freedom, certainly not the kind that Brecht or Tucholsky envisioned, is defined not in political terms but rather in sexual and financial ones.\n\nThe essays discussed above can easily be read as precursors to a broader critical discourse on popular culture, exemplified by Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer’s 1947 treatise “Culture Industry,” which maligns the mass culture audience for its uncritical absorption of popular entertainment and its inability to recognize that modern mass culture does not come from the people but “is administered and imposed from above.” These essays could also be analyzed through a specifically gendered lens. As Andreas Huyssen has persuasively argued, mass culture was often feminized in modernist texts. Behind modernist critiques that portrayed popular culture as a threat to high culture, Huyssen contends, lay a fear of the working masses and also of women “knocking at the gate of a male-dominated culture.” With Huyssen’s analysis in mind, it is perfectly plausible to read the essays by Döblin, Brecht, and Kracauer as responses to the perceived threat of both mass culture and masses of women. The presence of women in the movie audience, as depicted by these Weimar-era observers, indicated women’s increased and unwanted presence in the public sphere—in the workplace and entertainment venues. The possible threat of the working woman is diffused by these authors in two strategic moves. The first move presents women as dim-witted dupes easily manipulated from above by their male bosses, lovers, or cultural institutions like film studios. These women are portrayed as having no agency; they place their bodies in service of industry, and they allow their minds to be shaped by the “culture industry.” The second move is to depict these women in explicitly sexual terms—as passive sexual objects. All three authors use both the trope of prostitution and the darkened, eroticized space of the cinema to aid them in these moves.\n\nA subtle shift occurs between Döblin’s essay and Brecht and Kracauer’s pieces, however. The shift that takes place is one from prostitute to white-collar worker, and yet this shift does not mean that the prostitute disappears from the scene. Whereas Döblin’s prewar spectators are prostitutes with painted faces who represent the sexually permissive atmosphere of the cinema and its imagined working-class audience, the women in the essays by Brecht and Kracauer are white-collar workers who take social cues from on-screen prostitutes. Here prostitution takes on a variety of meanings. It can be read as the potential sexual objectification of white-collar women by the men who accompany them to the cinema, and it can also represent a rationalized eroticism that keeps women enslaved within an exploitative socioeconomic system. Certainly what all of these women have in common is that they do not possess a critical gaze; they are bad spectators. The authors, in contrast, are authoritative observers who have the power both to see the audience with a critical eye and see through the manipulative messages of the filmic narratives. By foregrounding the deficiencies of the female spectators, these essays privilege male spectatorship, for they imply that the masculine subject can decipher the “truth” behind the image. As a darkened space that creates a clear delineation between on-screen actors and ostensibly passive spectators, Huyssen points out in a recent analysis of Kracauer’s Weimar essays, the cinema is easily “transfigured” by modernist critics “into a spatial imaginary or even into a dream space” in which the thoughts and dreams of those who occupy the space are illuminated by the authors, for better or worse. The cinema is thereby transformed from a space of anxious encounter between men and women into a pleasurable space, one in which men like Kracauer, Döblin, and Brecht could experience erotic pleasure by viewing women both in the audience and on the screen, and intellectual pleasure by analyzing “the secret mechanism” behind each film.\n\nThis theoretical move by authors such as Kracauer to privilege male spectatorship at the expense of female spectatorship has been dismantled by feminist film scholarship, particularly by Patrice Petro, who implores readers to “challenge the assumption that cinematic vision is inherently masculine.” While Kracauer’s text belittles the shopgirls’ desire for pop cultural distraction, Petro reads Kracauer’s own work against the grain, noting that it is he who is distracted and therefore may be misreading the girls’ responses to the films. Attempting to read the girls’ “state of concentration” as critical contemplation rather than naive absorption, Petro returns to the scene in which Kracauer admonishes the girls for crying, and argues: “While the emotional response of the little shop girls may reveal an acknowledgement of a loss of social mastery, their concentrated gaze involves a perceptual activity that is neither passive nor entirely distracted.” The same moment in Kracauer’s text, however, leaves open the possibility for a different reading, one that still allows for the possibility of women as critical consumers of mass culture (fig. 11). Having just watched a tragic film in which the female protagonist commits suicide in order to save her lover’s career, the shopgirls shed a few tears, but they “furtively…wipe their eyes and quickly powder their noses before the lights go up.” If one of Kracauer’s main criticisms of the girls is that they do not recognize the disjuncture between filmic representation and their own drab lives, and therefore fail to take action toward social change, their act of powdering their faces could contradict his claim. Although Kracauer implies that their powdering constitutes an overidentification with the on-screen actress and their desire to participate in the film’s plot, it is possible that their powdering is actually a moment of critical disjuncture. Drying their tears and dabbing their faces with powder before the cinematic space is illuminated, the shopgirls anticipate the transition from the darkened space of the theater to the space of the street and thereby display an awareness that they will be looked at. The city street, in contrast to the cinema, can be seen, Henri Lefebvre suggests, as “a form of spontaneous theater” that offers urban women and men opportunities to be “spectacle and spectator, and sometimes an actor.” Recognizing the difference between these spaces, with a dab of the powder puff, the supposedly passive “girls” move out onto the street and on to the next adventure. Perhaps, then, these shopgirls are not dupes but critical consumers, perfectly aware of the disjuncture between cinematic representations and reality and able to negotiate various urban spaces. Perhaps the cinema is not the site of their social and moral corruption but rather a place where they can exercise their buying power and satisfy their desire for entertainment at the end of a long workday. Perhaps they are desiring subjects as well as desired objects. And perhaps, before they exit the cinema, they pause to look in their compact mirrors for a second, casting quizzical glances at the intellectual in the back row and returning, even if just for a second, his studied gaze.\n\nFigure 11.

An examination of the widespread popularity of prostitutes’ songs in Berlin’s cabarets reveals discourses that do not attempt to render female sexuality or spectatorship passive, but rather acknowledge Weimar women’s active search for entertainment and companionship, as well as their penchant for self-stylization and masquerade. Looking beyond the cinematic space allows us to see Weimar Berlin as a city filled with various performances of gender and sexuality, an urban environment in which sexual norms and essentialized definitions of gender are destabilized, all with the help of a powder puff.\n\nCabaret Coquette: Prostitutes Take Center Stage\n\nIn the final months of the First World War, the head of Berlin’s theater censorship department, Kurt von Glasenapp, received a dismayed report from the police commissioner concerning both the repertoire and the audience of the capital city’s many cabarets. Couched in a plea for stricter censorship of what the police report calls “beer-and-coffee cabarets” is a description of a new urban audience comprised mostly of women, and a repertoire consisting primarily of Dirnenlieder, or prostitutes’ songs. Without censorship of these songs and their lewd lyrics, the police commissioner feared, audience members would gradually “get used to the idea that there is nothing extravagant or forbidden about such behavior.” Much like Brecht and his concerns in his essay “From the Theater Scene,” the police official was worried that, especially in a time of staggering food shortages and financial need, female audience members would take social cues from prostitutes. What sets this document apart from texts such as Brecht’s, however, is its portrayal of the cabarets’ women visitors. These were not the naive girls that Brecht and Kracauer would go on to depict. Quite the contrary, they were savvy Berliners and no strangers to “the follies of love” so common to “Berlin’s metropolitan life.” The report’s author openly admitted that he had no problem with women expressing curiosity about sex, telling saucy jokes, or reading erotic novels as long as they did so among themselves and in private. As soon as they moved into the public realm and became part of a mixed audience, however, their behavior became a cause for concern. Unlike Brecht’s imagined secretaries, who visited the cinema accompanied by men, the women who visited Berlin’s cabarets made up nearly three-quarters of the audience, which means that they were either unaccompanied or going out in groups. The suspicion aired by the police report is not that these women would become the targets of unwanted attention, but rather that, like the prostitutes on stage, they might actively solicit too much attention.\n\nFour months after the above report was written, its plea for increased oversight of the cabarets was rendered moot by the official lifting of censorship, and new cabarets began opening up all over the city, most of them not much more than glorified strip clubs catering to the nouveaux riches. Even the literary cabarets such as Max Reinhardt’s second incarnation of Schall und Rauch (Sound and Smoke), Rosa Valetti’s Cabaret Größenwahn (Cabaret Megalomania), and Trude Hesterberg’s Wilde Bühne (Wild Stage) catered primarily to a new bourgeois audience that preferred “spicy punchlines and champagne” to political satire. Inspired by the Parisian cabarets that flourished in late nineteenth-century Montmartre and featured the talents of Aristide Bruant and Yvette Guilbert, the founders of Berlin’s literary cabarets “longed to revolt but remain popular—and commercially successful.” This proved to be a difficult balance to strike, and none of these cabarets lasted more than two seasons. With the writing talents of Kurt Tucholsky, Friedrich Hollaender, Walter Mehring, and Klabund, and performers such as Paul Graetz, Kurt Gerron, Gussy Holl, and Valeska Gert, the literary cabarets owed much of their commercial success to their portrayals of colorful urban characters—cigarette vendors, thieves, vagabonds, pimps, and prostitutes. The underworld was chic. Women performers like Gert, Rosa Valetti, and Blandine Ebinger played prostitutes on stage, turning whores’ songs—or, in the case of Gert, whores’ dances—into what Alan Lareau calls “conventional fare.” And yet each of these performers had her own interpretation of the figure, and these interpretations were not necessarily conventional. Indeed they were quite different from most prostitutes’ songs performed in turn-of-the-century cabarets in Berlin, which offered either overly romanticized portraits of the underworld or dismal stories of the prostitute’s grim fate. Weimar performers, particularly those in the literary cabarets, broke away from such clichéd representations. Before Sound and Smoke opened its doors in December 1919, its artists got together to write, play music, and test out possible performance pieces. In his memoirs, the lyricist and composer Friedrich Hollaender describes one of these improvisational sessions, where he met the woman who would become his first wife, Blandine Ebinger. It is without a tinge of fear, anxiety, or disgust, indeed it is with no small measure of fascination and respect, that he describes Blandine’s off-the-cuff performance of a prostitute: “An almost-too-skinny girl with a face that’s pale—paler—palest under the dark pageboy…. Imitates a hooker in a bar. Sits down on a barstool that’s not even there, crosses her legs, hikes her skirt up a bit, give me a glass of Cognac, and sings one straight from the soul, all about the business, what types of clients show up, does one have to, of course one has to, and it just pours out of her mouth, with such humor, with such keen powers of observation.” Ebinger’s “bar hooker” is a plucky, yet slightly jaded, working-class prostitute. The line “does one have to, of course one has to” (hat man das nötig, klar hat man das nötig) plays with the German term Not (need) and is left ambiguous, referring simultaneously to the sexual needs of the clients and the financial need of the prostitute. Although Hollaender pokes fun at Ebinger’s pale and masklike face peering out from under her bobbed hair, his memory of this event shows a clear appreciation for the sardonic wit of the performer and for her rendition of the subject.\n\nValeska Gert, an anarchic dancer and actress who also performed at Sound and Smoke in 1920 and became known throughout interwar Europe for her parodies of such popular dances as the Charleston, fox-trot, and tango, had a different take on the prostitute. Portraying the prostitute as an unabashedly erotic figure, Gert “wanted to show [the prostitute] plying her trade.” She stressed the novelty of her performance at the time, describing herself in her memoirs as “a sensitive whore, moving gently and sensually,” exposing her thighs, gyrating her hips to the music, and making provocative gestures to the audience. By giving her audience the most extreme version of what it surreptitiously wanted, Gert exposed to them their own sexual desires and made them squirm in their seats. As a contemporary critic noted of her performances, those who saw them as simply obscene were mistaken, for “Valeska Gert does not uncover herself, but rather the sexuality of dance.” By acting out the prostitute’s sexuality, then, Valeska Gert did not mark that sexuality as deviant but as a type of sexuality that is often denied but secretly desired by bourgeois society. The prostitute’s own desire, on the other hand, might be pure performance, just like Gert’s dances.\n\nGert’s blatant exposure of sexuality was a bit too much for Kurt Tucholsky, who described her dances as a mixture of “desire and agony.” In the songs he wrote for Sound and Smoke, Tucholsky took a subtler approach to eroticism and chose to stage a more refined type of prostitute—the youthful bourgeois cocotte from Berlin West. The cocotte was a figure that had fascinated Tucholsky since the final years of the Wilhelmine period when he observed the famed Berlin cabaret artist Fritzi Massary play a grande cocotte. Massary was no stranger to prostitutes’ songs; she performed them regularly in popular revues at Berlin’s Metropoltheater in the years leading up to the First World War, but it was her artful rendition of the grande cocotte that Tucholsky recounts in his 1913 essay “Massary.” In Tucholsky’s opinion, Massary was the only performer who could walk the fine line between obscenity and respectability required by the figure of the cocotte, without ever stepping fully onto one side or the other. She coquettishly awaited each suitor, only to toy with his affections by inflaming his desire and then rejecting his “clumsy” advances. Admitting that he is embellishing a bit, Tucholsky describes Massary’s staged rejection of her overeager suitor to his readers thus: “‘O-ho! Dear Sir!’ (The tone of her voice changes: for this moment, she has a wonderful, ethical bass at her disposal.) ‘What do you take me for? I’m an upst…’ And as soon as she says it, mocking laughter rings out.” The target of the audience’s and Massary’s mockery is not just the fumbling gentleman caller but the very concept of respectability (Anständigkeit), for the word anständig (upstanding) serves as the truncated punch line of the cocotte’s joke. Massary’s irreverent performance no doubt inspired Tucholsky’s own Weimar-era Dirnenlieder, in which the cocotte retains the upper hand over her bumbling, disarmed suitor, and in which male desire is portrayed as more of a laughable nuisance than a threat. The men described by Tucholsky’s cocottes are “bums” or buffoons rather than cunning seducers, a portrayal that likely appealed to the growing female cabaret audience.\n\nAlthough less overt in their eroticism than Gert’s aggressive dances, Tucholsky’s songs revealed to the audience its own demand for certain types of women and certain types of entertainment. His song “Zieh Dich aus, Petronella!” (Take It Off, Petronella!), written for Gussy Holl and set to music by Hollaender, mocked the postwar public’s seemingly insatiable appetite for nude dance shows, exemplified in the early Weimar Republic by the popularity of performances by the notorious Anita Berber and by the Ballet Celly de Rheidt, and in the large-scale revues that had their heyday in the mid- and late 1920s. One version of the song ends with Petronella taking off her clothes in private for a wealthy patron and shows just how blurred the lines between erotic entertainment, private pleasure, and commodified sex had become in Weimar Berlin. It is exactly these erotic gray zones that Tucholsky’s lyrics from the early Weimar years explore, and his female protagonists are rarely working-class streetwalkers or seasoned bar hookers. They are less mature and intimidating than Massary’s grand cocotte, but they are no less savvy about men’s desires. Perhaps they are most aptly characterized as flirts, teases, or cocottes-in-training. The most striking example of an aspiring cocotte is Tucholsky’s “Das Tauentzienmädel” (Girl from the Tauentzienstrasse, 1920), a fresh-mouthed fifteen year old who sneaks out to the cabaret when her well-to-do parents think she is taking French lessons instead. The prelude to the song is a flirtatious dialogue between the girl and the conférencier, loaded with double entendres concerning the girl’s desire to learn French—“fränzösisch lernen” is a clear allusion to learning the art of fellatio—and her underage status. As the girl quips, although she may not yet have reached sixteen, the legal age of consent, the Weimar president might be able to issue an emergency decree if the conférencier is truly in need (again, the German term Not is used to signal male desire). By placing the girl in the audience during the prelude and having the conférencier invite her onto the stage to sing her song, Tucholsky denies his audience a clichéd portrait of the Berlin underworld and shines the spotlight on a figure from their own bourgeois milieu instead.\n\nTucholsky’s girl from the Tauentzienstrasse is just the type of female audience member about whom the police warned the censorship official Kurt von Glasenapp at the end of the war. A “cheeky chick” (“kesse Beere” in Berlin dialect), as the conférencier calls her, she deceives her parents and absconds to the cabaret, to dance balls, and to walk the “streets around the K.d.W.” The K.d.W. is the Kaufhaus des Westens, one of Berlin’s largest department stores, which still stands at the corner of Tauentzienstrasse and Wittenbergplatz in the heart of what was known in Weimar Berlin as the “new West.” While the reference to the K.d.W. evokes urban consumer culture, the reference to the streets that surround it evoke the brand of upscale, urbane (mondän) prostitution for which the area was known. Although Tucholsky’s savvy girl repeatedly claims that she never goes beyond the “overture” in her relations with men, the song’s multiple allusions to oral sex and the girl’s admission that she likes to “try it out a little” make the audience wonder just how long and how expensive this “overture” might be. The “it” in “try it out a little” may be left open, but the lines that surround it are like the streets that surround the K.d.W.; they all point to prostitution. The implicit references to prostitution, however, do not serve to undermine the girl’s self-assurance and wherewithal. Instead, the song highlights both the erotic tension that lies in the girl’s ability to vacillate between the roles of “innocent angel and cocotte” and the cool pragmatism with which she approaches sex:\n\nI dance at every ball\n\nwith men over twenty—all.\n\nWhere children come from, God, do you think I’m dumb!\n\nI really must protest!\n\nAfter all, we have progressed,\n\nI even already know how not to have ’em!\n\nAuf allen Bällen tanz ich\n\nmit Herrn, die über zwanzig.\n\nWo Kinder herkomm’n, Gott, wer weiß das nicht!\n\nDa muß ich schon sehr bitten!\n\nWir sind doch fortgeschritten,\n\nich weiß sogar schon, wie man keine kriegt.\n\nSexual knowledge, including the art of flirtation and methods of birth control, is presented here as central to young Weimar women’s emancipation. By consciously teasing the audience and the conférencier about her sexual availability, Tucholsky’s Tauentzien-Girl embodies the game of flirtation as Simmel described it in 1909, for she “lends a positive concreteness to not-having, making it tangible for the first time by means of the playful, suggestive illusion of having” and at the same time “intensifies the attraction of having to the most extreme degree by means of the threatening illusion of not-having.” She may not quite be a cocotte, but she is certainly a Berlin coquette.\n\nAs a bourgeois girl who is “trying it out a little,” Tucholsky’s girl serves to further erode the boundaries between prostitutes and New Women, between polite society and the so-called underworld. But as small literary cabarets closed down in the early and mid-1920s, losing audience members to large-scale revues, prostitutes’ songs performed by individual cabaret artists in an intimate setting gave way to elaborate tableaux vivants of naked or nearly naked women and to kicklines of girls who moved with mechanical precision. As Roger Stein documents, the Dirnenlied reached the pinnacle of its popularity in the early years of Weimar Berlin and had become a dying form by the mid-1920s. It saw a brief revival, however, in one of the cultural works most often associated with Weimar Berlin: Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill’s 1928 Dreigroschenoper (The Threepenny Opera). Although the primary textual source for The Threepenny Opera was the English playwright John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera (1728), Brecht also drew inspiration from the repertoires of Parisian and Berlin cabarets. Indeed Brecht took many of the song texts used to describe the underworld milieu of the opera’s antihero, Macheath, and his former lover, the prostitute “Dive-Bar Jenny” (Spelunken-Jenny), most notably their duet called the “Ballad of the Pimp” (“Zuhälterballade”), directly from K. L. Ammer’s German translation of the Parisian chansonnier François Villon’s songs and ballads. Because she is a prostitute and because she betrays Macheath for money, Dive-Bar Jenny has often been read as a critical figure personifying “the reduction of human relations to financial transactions.” Lareau and Stein, however, argue that reading Jenny primarily as a critical, materialist figure neglects the prostitute’s status as a popular figure of Weimar stage and screen. Jenny, after all, has three incarnations in Brecht’s late Weimar operas: “Pirate-Jenny” (die Seeräuber-Jenny) and Dive-Bar Jenny in The Threepenny Opera, followed by the prostitute Jenny in Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny (Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, 1929). In both works, some of the most memorable lines and songs are given to Jenny. Drawing attention to the popularity of Weill’s music, Brecht’s clever use of Villon’s lyrics, and the play’s focus on the urban milieu of beggars and prostitutes, Weimar cabaret scholars like Lareau and Stein claim that The Threepenny Opera is very much a period piece, intimately linked to the urban world of cabaret, music hall, and revue. It is a work that points to the ironic tension between Brecht’s “appropriation of popular entertainment forms and his relentless satire of their illusory and manipulative nature.” The Threepenny Opera enacts and thereby exposes the phenomenon of “underworld chic.” Just as it capitalizes on the popular appeal of underworld figures like the thief Macheath and the prostitute Jenny, it reveals those figures first as objects of bourgeois faddishness and then as completely bourgeois themselves. After all, the roguish Macheath wears spats, carries an ivory-tipped cane, and adorns the stable where he is about to consummate his marriage to Polly Peachum with stolen Chippendale furniture. Even his regular visits to the brothel, Isabelle Siemes points out, are simply “bourgeois rituals,” habits that Macheath just cannot break. The whorehouse is no less bourgeois than Mackie’s lair; Brecht describes it in his stage directions as “a bourgeois idyll,” where the prostitutes iron clothes, play cards, and bathe while Mackie’s men sit quietly reading the newspaper. If this conflation of the criminal underworld with the bourgeoisie is a form of ridicule, whom is Brecht’s opera ridiculing and to what end? Is this a cultural critique, lamenting the ability of bourgeois culture to dictate theater repertoire and subsume all that lies outside of it? Does Brecht bemoan the mainstreaming of the margins, even as he attempts to appeal to a mainstream audience? Does Brecht succeed in his attempt to both provoke and entertain, revealing the hypocrisy of a bourgeoisie that refuses to see the suffering of those whose stories they consume as mere entertainment? Such questions, though much discussed, remain unanswered, and it is this tension between social critique and popular appeal that allows The Threepenny Opera to remain so appealing to twenty-first-century audiences.\n\nThese tensions are certainly evident in Polly Peachum’s performance of “Pirate Jenny.” In The Threepenny Opera the roles of prostitute and bourgeois daughter, while they seem to be reversed, are actually conflated. The prostitutes in the brothel “perform” bourgeois domesticity, while the bourgeois Polly Peachum “performs” lower-class prostitution. What is “Pirate Jenny” but a bourgeois daughter’s performance of an underworld woman? As she stands up in front of her bridegroom Macheath and his band of thieves, Polly announces: “I myself will sing a little song; it’s an imitation of a girl I saw once in some twopenny halfpenny dive in Soho.” It is Polly’s fascination with the low-class barmaid that leads her to stand up and sing a song that became one of the show’s greatest hits. It is also the song with the clearest revolutionary potential, for Pirate Jenny calls for the destruction of an entire city and, with it, all those who have wronged her. As an avenger of both class and gender oppression, Pirate Jenny evokes an ambivalent reaction from Macheath and his men. Whereas the thief Matthias describes Polly’s performance as “pretty” and even “cute,” the newlywed Macheath is less amused and retorts: “What do you mean pretty? It’s not pretty, you idiot!” Although, in an ironic defense of culture, Macheath defends Polly’s song as “art” to his band of thieves, in a private aside to his bride, he expresses his unease, saying: “I don’t like you play-acting; let’s not have any more of it.” Women’s agency—even its mere performance—is perceived by Macheath as a threat. Brecht’s Threepenny Opera reflects the paradox inherent in the figure of the prostitute, a figure that can both affirm and subvert social structures. And yet compared to the more daring and complex portraits of prostitutes performed by cabaret artists of the early years of the Weimar Republic, Brecht’s prostitutes seem, to use Stein’s description, “more like inventory, backdrops to the action”; they are on stage “just because they belong to the milieu.” This may be a slightly oversimplified reading of the original staging of The Threepenny Opera, but by the time Brecht staged the prostitute Jenny and the procuress Widow Begbick in Mahagonny, he had chosen to place “the milieu” of prostitution fully on the side of exploitative capitalism. This one-dimensional drawing of female characters as cold capitalists betrays a lack of critical interest in gender dynamics and thereby supports Christian Rogowski’s diagnosis that “the world of Brecht’s plays is a man’s world.”\n\nThe world of early Weimar literary cabaret, however, was not exclusively a man’s world. It relied just as much on the talents of women artists (Holl, Ebinger, Gert) and entrepreneurs (Hesterberg, Valetti) as it did on the writing talents of men like Tucholsky and Hollaender. These performers used the Dirnenlied both to entertain and to provoke their audience, and to explore the nuances of erotic femininity and commodified sexuality. The performance of a more audacious form of female sexuality, as Tucholsky’s Tauentzien-Girl with her mention of the “streets around the K.d.W.” implies, was not limited to the cabaret stage. It was happening on the streets and in the cafés and clubs of Weimar Berlin, as Curt Moreck shows in his Guide to “Naughty” Berlin. The guide takes its reader to the capital city’s many entertainment venues and late-night haunts, paying special attention to the women who frequent these places. In its constant blending of prostitutes and New Women, as well as its repeated references to masks, mimicry, and makeup, Moreck’s guide takes a more playful approach to gender and sexuality and calls on its readers to find out for themselves what might—or might not—be so naughty about Berlin.\n\nNew Men, New Women, and Masks: Curt Moreck’s Guide to “Naughty” Berlin\n\nCurt Moreck begins his Guide to “Naughty” Berlin with a familiar slogan: “A Visit to Berlin for Everyone!” (Jeder einmal in Berlin!). This catchy phrase was the advertising slogan used by Berlin’s municipal tourist agency in the 1920s to attract visitors to Germany’s capital city. Ostensibly it worked. During the period of economic stabilization (1924–29), as many as two million tourists per year flocked to the city. Many of those tourists were drawn to Berlin by more than the urge to stroll down Unter den Linden to see the Brandenburg Gate. Those visitors who were looking for sexual thrills that could not be found on a guided tour or in the bourgeois standard-bearer of travel guides, the Baedeker, those who wanted to explore the “confusing metropolis of pleasure,” needed Moreck’s guide.\n\nThe guide is a mixed-media text that combines its alternative travel narrative with visual images. Moreck’s witty style of big city reportage is accompanied by contemporary illustrations by Berlin artists such as Paul Kamm, Jeanne Mammen, George Grosz, Christian Schad, and Heinrich Zille. Moreck spends his first chapter, “We’ll Show You Berlin,” convincing the reader that the guide is, in many ways, indispensable to any traveler who wants to get beyond Berlin’s “official side.” Moreck claims to offer a way to experience rather than simply to see Berlin, a peek past the city’s official mask:\n\nEvery city has an official and an unofficial side, and it is superfluous to add that the latter is more interesting and more informative of the essence of a city. That which appears so clearly in the light of the arc lamps has a face more like a mask than a physiognomy. The smile it offers is more an appeal to the visitor’s purse. It wears the makeup of the coquette, applied too thickly to permit the true features underneath to be recognized. Those who are looking for experiences, who long for adventure, who hope for sensations—they must go into the shadows.\n\nIn this passage, Berlin’s official tourist industry is likened to a painted “coquette,” a particularly bold lady of the night who could just as easily be described as a “cocotte.” Found under the “light of the arc lamp,” the tourist industry/cocotte wears a smile only to entice the tourist to spend money. To use a contemporary phrase, she’s a “tourist trap.” Eager to please the eye, tourism cakes on its makeup, creating a mask that obscures the city’s “essence.” Interestingly, as much as Moreck promises to show his readers Berlin’s “true features,” most often he winds up showing them its many masks. Perhaps the masklike makeup—so garishly applied—is impossible to remove completely. One can only hope to examine its various layers. Moreck’s use of prostitute imagery in his description of “official Berlin” can be read as further testament to the prostitute’s mainstream status in Weimar Berlin, for in this passage the prostitute is associated with the moneymaking industries of entertainment and tourism. Yet prostitutes in Moreck’s guide also inhabit the “unofficial” world of shadows, embodying the “adventure” and “sensations” of sexual subcultures, as well as the “demimonde” in which they are virtually indistinguishable from the new generation of women who walk the streets of Berlin. The sheer variety and ambiguity of Moreck’s representations of prostitutes place him in closer proximity to women artists of the Weimar period like Jeanne Mammen, whose works, the art historian Marsha Meskimmon argues, are effective in “dismantling…the marginality of sex workers as mere symbols of decadence, commodity capitalism, and the uncontrollable mass.” Indeed Moreck’s guide repeatedly calls the very concept of social and spatial marginality into question by showing its readers a city with multiple centers of pleasure filled with a host of urban characters sporting playful masks.\n\nSetting himself apart from Karl Baedeker’s guidebook Berlin and Its Environs, which provides readers with recommendations for hotels and restaurants, detailed maps of the capital city’s streets and transportation system, and helpful blueprints of churches, monuments, and museums, Moreck gives his readers neither maps nor diagrams. The visual elements of his guide are the artists’ renditions of social spaces. Unlike traditional travel guides that feature state-sponsored cultural institutions and historic landmarks, Moreck steers his readers away from the more historic sections of the city, privileging spaces that more aptly reflect Berlin’s youthful, erotic vibrancy. Instead of using streets as mere avenues to particular destinations or monumental sites, the streets themselves become destinations. In an essay written the same year as Moreck’s guide, Kracauer himself identified the street as a space that can “escape the authority of urban planners and architects and reveal the heterogeneity that their designs deny.” However, as Moreck warns, some streets still cater to an older generation of tourists, naive “provincials” from “strict bourgeois” backgrounds still grounded in Wilhelmine morals. The best case in point is his description of Friedrichstrasse, a popular destination for foreign and provincial visitors because of its geographical location close to one of Berlin’s main train stations, and, incidentally, the only location for nightlife mentioned in Baedeker’s turn-of-the-century guide. According to Moreck, “Were it not for the fact that the Friedrichstrasse is the most natural canal that takes in the stream of foreigners from the train station and directs it into the city…it would die out, for the democratic West, where the ‘new men’ live, is robbing it of its lifeblood.” It is in this passage that the author clearly makes the point that his is a new guide for a new generation of both men and women. For Weimar Berliners, Moreck claims, the Friedrichstrasse has become a “fossil,” a vestige of the Wilhelmine era that once catered to the desires of bourgeois men but now caters only to unassuming tourists in search of what they believe to be “naughty” Berlin. The various entertainment venues scattered on or around Friedrichstrasse, with their many attractive women, help to maintain the image of Berlin as a city of sexual decadence, but this “comedy of ‘Berlin, Babylon of Sin’ is just a show put on for the traveling foreigners.” Those who want to enter the “domain of the locals” and experience the streets that epitomize modern Berlin are directed to visit Berlin-West, where the shopping promenades of the Tauentzienstrasse and the Kurfürstendamm quiver with sexual energy and offer pleasures that are potentially more risqué. Decked out in high boots of varying colors, prostitutes specializing in S & M aggressively proposition passersby. Admitting that these women may intimidate visitors to Berlin-West, Moreck engages in a project of demystification, telling his readers that these boot whores, once considered a kinky peculiarity, have become “fashionable items” appealing to a variety of customers (fig. 12). The same holds true for the city’s many gay, lesbian, and transvestite clubs. Once seen as dens of iniquity, Moreck claims, some of these clubs now attract fashionable crowds interested in following a trend. Trendsetters looking for voyeuristic titillation find, however, that the clubs’ atmospheres are actually quite bourgeois, just as those individuals who go searching Alexanderplatz for the danger of the Berlin underworld find themselves admonished by Moreck not to confuse exaggerated cinematic images of Berlin’s criminal underbelly with reality. He instructs readers to be aware that, in many cases, the most dangerous criminals look the most benign, whereas those who truly look the part are mere mimics. By simultaneously refuting and perpetuating the idea of “naughty” Berlin, Moreck’s guide pokes fun at those who naively buy into the advertising slogans or the cinematic stereotypes of the metropolis as site of sexual decadence and danger. The very fact that the title of the guide places the word naughty in quotation marks underscores the tension between the reification of sexuality and danger and the demystification of the assumed link between sex and danger, a tension that Moreck’s work fails to resolve. It does, however, depart from a common understanding of sex tourism that presumes chauvinistic male agency and female passivity, for it resists mapping a clear path to the sexual satisfaction of male desire at the expense of female desire.\n\nFigure 12.

As previously mentioned, from the beginning Moreck makes it clear that the guide (the narrative “we”) is addressing a new generation of reader similar to the “new men” of Berlin-West, a republican reader who is open to a more democratic view of gender and sexuality. Rudy Koshar thoughtfully speculates on what this “new man” might look like, and he offers the following profile of Moreck’s “imagined tourist”:\n\nHe was of course a male heterosexual who was drawn to the more salacious side of Berlin culture after World War I…. He was willing to concede the variety of sexual identities one encountered when traveling through a major city…where not only heterosexual women, but also male and female homosexuals operated as more than passive subjects, as more than objects of derision, or as more than players in eroticized tableaux vivants. In Moreck’s Berlin, the Other looked back, and the possibilities of new representations and new sexual identities were contained in this returned gaze.\n\nKoshar convincingly argues that the guide caters primarily to a male heterosexual audience, yet the “male gaze” does not necessarily dominate the narrative, nor does it render the female gaze passive. If anything, in contrast to the texts on female spectatorship by Brecht and Kracauer, for instance, Moreck’s text casts doubt on the authority given to men’s cinematic vision by implying that the reader is prone to confuse film or sexual spectacle with reality. Additionally, by featuring spaces beyond the cinema—a space that is mentioned only fleetingly—the guide emphasizes the complex matrix of looks and gazes that exists in the city’s clubs, streets, and cafés. Such spaces are filled with women who are not just aware of being looked at but who want to be looked at and who look at others as well—sometimes at men, sometimes at other women. In the lesbian club and brothel Toppkeller, for example, only women can enter and choose a companion, after casting “scrutinizing looks” into the crowd of other women. A male reader would have to come to terms with the fact that his own desire for sexual fulfillment may be thwarted or even subjugated by female desire. Plainly stated, this modern guide is pitched to a youthful, alternative reader.\n\nThe guide’s generational focus, however, does not apply just to the “new man”; it also applies to the “New Woman” and a more open form of female sexuality. Young, single, sexually active women in the metropolis who adopt the open flirtatiousness and the once-distinctive style of the prostitute, particularly the prostitute’s use of cosmetics and more revealing fashions, make such behavior and style into the new norm. Returning to the space of the street, consider Moreck’s passage on the Tauentziengirls, fashionable prostitutes from Berlin-West, who before the First World War were notorious for their “refined femininity” and “demonically sparkling perversity” but are now virtually indistinguishable from their athletic and emancipated daughters:\n\nThe Tauentziengirls of yesteryear have aged and now have daughters who, on the athletic fields, engage in a beautiful competition with their masculine peers. The Tauentziengirls of yesteryear have become mothers, even if, thanks to their bobbed haircuts and cosmetics, they look more like their daughters’ older sisters. The Tauentziengirls of yesteryear now laugh over the fact that what one used to refer to as their vice and wickedness is considered perfectly natural today. Their extravagance of yesteryear is now taken for granted as the female youth’s given right.\n\nMoreck’s repetition of the phrase “the Tauentziengirls of yesteryear” constantly underscores the difference between the sexual mores of the turn of the century and those of Weimar Berlin. Assigning new meaning to the particular space of Tauentzienstrasse, a street once associated exclusively with mondän prostitution, this passage serves as an excellent example of how Moreck uses generational and spatial motifs to map out the domains of the New Woman. In this particular instance, prostitutes and New Women are—quite literally—related. This is quite a shift from Tucholsky’s “Girl from the Tauentzienstrasse,” who makes it clear that she knows more about sex than her prudish and well-to-do mother. Moreck’s contention that the Tauentziengirls’ matching makeup and hairstyles make them look more like sisters could be read in various ways: as “sisterhood,” a form of solidarity between prostitutes and sexually emancipated women, or perhaps as a sign of their contemporaneous visibility in Berlin’s social scene. But it is the motif of the mother that is most fitting to the tone of the travel guide, not only because prostitutes have traditionally been depicted, even in more progressive discourses, as antimothers, but even more because it implies that emancipated women are the figurative progeny of prostitutes. While the older generation of Tauentziengirls takes on the more traditionally “feminine” role of the mother and prostitute, the younger generation crosses gender boundaries, embodying both “masculine” brawn and athleticism and “feminine” extravagance. The prostitutes who caused a moral stir in Wilhelmine Berlin have given birth to a new generation of young women for whom sexual expression is a “natural right” and whose interaction with the men of their generation looks less like a threat and more like healthy competition and camaraderie.\n\nThe Weimar Republic brought with it what Moreck boldly labels “gender assimilation,” in which women actively sought their own leisure activities and created a space for themselves on the athletic fields and the streets and in Berlin’s multitude of entertainment venues. Proving themselves to be independent actors within spaces once—and perhaps still—dominated by men, these women could also be seen as potential readers of Moreck’s guide. Descriptions of women’s “desire to see and be seen” permeate the narrative, and the female gaze is visually represented by Jeanne Mammen’s illustrations. Mammen’s fourteen contributions, second only to Paul Kamm’s twenty, exemplify the presence of an active female gaze that makes Moreck’s guide so unique. In many of Mammen’s watercolors and drawings, women look at one another (as they do in her charcoal drawing of the boot whores in figure 12 above) or look confidently back at the viewer, and they do so with a gaze that is cool and casual, sometimes flirtatious and sometimes defiant. Take, for example, one of her illustrations commissioned for Moreck’s guide, Im Romanischen Café (In the Romanische Café; fig. 13). The artwork shows two elegantly dressed women on their way out of (or into) the café, a well-known haunt of bohemian culture and Berlin intellectuals, signified by the tight-lipped man in round spectacles reading the newspaper. The women’s red lipstick, scarves, bell-shaped hats, and clutch purses portray them as fashionable and possibly financially independent. Like the streets of Berlin-West, the urban café is portrayed by Moreck and Mammen as a space of welcome encounter between men and women, challenging its definition as a space frequented only by prostitutes or “lewd women.” As current theorists of space point out, however, the café differs from the street in its simulation of a domestic environment and its role as the “poor man’s sitting room.” Michel de Certeau, for instance, writes of café interiors as clear examples of the “privatization of public space” that, by mimicking the look of familiar domestic spaces like kitchens or living rooms, invite guests to linger over newspapers and cups of coffee. Even though the café can be read as a space where the public and private intersect and blend with one another, as a space where both intimate conversations and social experimentation can take place, in the cultural and literary discourse of the Weimar Republic, the Romanische Café is described as “first and foremost a democratic institution” where women from all walks of life, including writers such as Else Lasker-Schüler, found a home and experimented with cross-gender identities. As an “open, porous environment” that “offered women a more or less neutral space,” the café lent itself well to the performance of different personas and to frank discussions of sexuality. It was well known as a place where artists and intellectuals willingly subjected themselves to the gaze of others, regardless of gender. Elias Canetti reminisced: “The visits to the Romanisches Café…resulted from a need to be seen that nobody was immune to…. This applied to each rank and all stations of society.”\n\nFigure 13.

While the woman in profile takes a casual drag from her cigarette, the woman in the foreground pauses to look straight at the viewer. Her cool expression is softened only slightly by the coy shrug of her shoulder. The blank, narrow eyes—so typical of Mammen’s style—coupled with pale cheeks and red lips give her face a masklike quality. The squinted eyes, made-up face, and coy pose could be read today through Helmut Lethen’s explication of the “cool persona,” the adoption of “strategic self-enactment” central to the age of New Objectivity. In the economically and politically unstable Weimar years, Lethen argues, many intellectuals and artists donned masks of impassivity or tested out various “codes of conduct” in order to protect their vulnerable inner “creature.” Because Lethen’s study focuses almost exclusively on men, he fails to satisfactorily address the question of whether or not women can successfully try on the mask of the “cool persona.” Mammen, however, draws her female subjects in masks that bear an uncanny resemblance to Lethen’s description of the “cool gaze,” a squinting of the eyes into narrow slits: “The impulse to squint is transmitted simultaneously to the muscles that lower the upper lids and raise the lower ones, and again to the muscles that open the eyes. A more or less narrow slit remains open, resulting in the familiar image of eyes peering between nearly closed lids.” Anyone familiar with Mammen’s work will immediately acknowledge that the “image of eyes peering between nearly closed lids” is a trademark of her women’s faces. If, as Lethen argues, “character” in the age of New Objectivity “is a matter of what mask is put on,” then Mammen’s images of women who exude “cool conduct” imply that they were just as adept at trying on masks as male intellectuals and artists were.\n\nBoth Mammen’s artworks and Moreck’s guide foreground the central role that makeup and masquerade played in Berlin street life and nightlife. Makeup was the element of fashion that served most to eroticize and feminize 1920s women, and its widespread use did contribute to the blurring of lines between prostitutes and nonprostitutes. Sabine Hake notes: “Until the war, only prostitutes and demimondaines wore makeup during the day.” But in Weimar Berlin, New Women started wearing rouge and foundation to work and more dramatic makeup at night. The more widespread use of cosmetics robbed them of their power to mark illicit sexuality. Describing women on the streets of Berlin-West, Moreck raises this very point about makeup, remarking: “Makeup used to be a label, but today it has become part of the cosmetic uniform of the female sex.” A label is generally used on products to reveal to the consumer what is hidden inside, and although it does not have the strong negative connotations of a stigma, it nevertheless implies a kind of fixed categorization imposed from the outside. A uniform conjures, on the one hand, the women’s uniformity of appearance, their possible indistinguishability. On the other hand, a uniform is also an article of clothing that one puts on and takes off. Therefore, Moreck’s observation suggests that the widespread use of makeup, combined with the loosening of moral codes, made it virtually impossible to stigmatize women’s promiscuity. Instead women could use makeup as a mask—as a medium through which to try out different looks and attitudes—to experiment with androgyny, to be hyperfeminine, to be flirtatious, or to appear cool and detached. As Hake notes, there were different cosmetic “uniforms” for different spaces: a more natural, professional look for the workplace and a more dramatic, masklike one for bars, dance halls, or nightclubs. This concept of putting on a different face to suit each attitude, occasion, or space is one that dispels the myth of an ontological female “essence,” for, as the feminist film theorist Mary Ann Doane argues, “to claim that femininity is a function of the mask is to dismantle the question of essentialism before it can be posed.” Following Doane’s lead, Mark Wigley joins theories of space with those of gender and sexuality by drawing parallels between architectural theories on the decorative facades of buildings and the use of makeup and masquerade by women. He writes: “The mechanisms of the production of gender can be exposed as such in order to make a space for woman. The ‘decorative layer’…can be manipulated to produce other spacialities, which is to say, other sexualities.” Moreck’s guide and its accompanying illustrations show its readers a multitude of spaces in which notions of fixed gender and sexual identity no longer apply; instead the Berlin he portrays is one of layers, masks, and makeup applied by the New Women and new men who inhabit it.\n\nIn Moreck’s guide, even if the masks and the makeup that comprise them have been adopted by new generations of women, the prostitutes remain some of the ultimate performers described in the text. The boot girls perform dominance, the Tauentziengirls perform youthful extravagance, and the prostitutes who duck into the lesbian bar Café Olala to have a quiet drink with their girlfriends between shifts perform heterosexual desire for their male clients. The possibilities afforded by the mask are a large part of Weimar emancipation, and self-stylization is an act in which many a New Woman and new man is shown to take part. In Moreck’s text, the state of confusion that results from not being able to discern the truth behind the mask, to tell prostitutes from nonprostitutes, heterosexuals from homosexuals, and sometimes even men from women, does not inspire fear but rather constitutes an erotic thrill. Just how naughty was Berlin, and where did this naughtiness reside if not in this sense of erotic confusion? By calling Berlin’s naughtiness into question in his own title, Moreck’s work satirizes what it defines as outdated moral codes, such as those represented in Thomas Wehrling’s essay “Berlin Is Becoming a Whore” and texts that would define Berlin as the metropolis of vice and its public women as whores. By holding fast to rigid definitions of gender and sexuality or by theorizing gender in the darkened, enclosed space of the cinema, even writers such as Brecht and Kracauer were incapable of seeing the sexual pleasures enjoyed by New Women and new men, who confused and delighted each other by wearing playful masks on the streets and in the clubs, cabarets, and cafés of Weimar Berlin.\n\nMixing and Mingling in Berlin-West\n\nOn a crisp November evening in 1925, one of the preeminent film critics of the Weimar Republic, Willy Haas, found himself in the midst of a tumultuous street scene in front of a Berlin cinema. The occasion was the premiere of Richard Oswald’s latest film, Halbseide (Half-Silk), and the reason for the hubbub was that the event had been oversold by one hundred tickets. Much more interesting than the film itself, claims Haas in his review, was the urban crowd wrangling to get into the premiere. Mingling with newspaper critics and businessmen were “tuxedoed men with women in bright brocade coats” and “little hookers from the Kantstrasse—who [were] rightfully interested in a subject that [had] more to do with them than with anyone else.” The subject that Haas imagines being of such great concern to the prostitutes in the crowd is, at least in part, betrayed by the film’s title, Half-Silk. It is about the creation of erotic confusion through the blurring of class boundaries and moral boundaries. The film’s promotional brochure explains the concept of “half-silk” in greater detail by describing how the film begins with a game between two men, played out on the streets of Berlin: “The men amused themselves by checking out the passing women and guessing their value, which in this case meant their willingness. They classified the women as they would a commodity. Silk, that was a society lady, cotton was a little bourgeois girl, but half-silk had that certain thrilling something, of which one couldn’t quite discern if [she] still belonged to society or just to so-called society, or [if she] vacillated between the two.” One of the two men decides to follow “a blond, who was elegantly, not ostentatiously, but yet coquettishly dressed,” and after a series of misunderstandings that make up the film’s convoluted plot, the men’s canny ability to classify women by their sexual availability, or “willingness” (Willigkeit), is exposed as a sham.\n\nMost film critics at the time agreed that Oswald’s Half-Silk was a playful, harmless film and primarily a commercial enterprise, but they also agreed that there was something intangible about it that captured Weimar Berlin to a tee. One critic proclaimed: “Oswald, the Ur-Berliner from Vienna, has once again brought a slice of Berlin milieu to the screen.” Film scholars who have recently rediscovered Oswald argue that his works offer unrivaled insight into popular Weimar films and the tastes and whims of that era’s mainstream audience. Certainly the film’s sold-out premiere and the colorful crowd outside the cinema, as described by Willy Haas, speak to Oswald’s ability to draw a large audience, just as Weimar-era reviews of the film tell us something about that audience’s fascination with Berlin’s urban milieu. But what made this film by Richard Oswald a “Berlin film?” It had something to do with the open acknowledgment of uncertainty, but it also raised the possibility that uncertainty, or confusion, could have a pleasurable side, making Berlin—as Moreck would call it—“the confusing metropolis of pleasure.” Perhaps it was the murky legibility or even indecipherability of visual cues such as makeup and clothing that used to demarcate sexually available women from “respectable” ones, perhaps it was the openness of urban spaces that placed “little hookers” shoulder to shoulder with newspapermen and elegant ladies, and perhaps it was the knowledge—informed by the experience of war, political upheaval, and inflation—that the fates of any of these urban figures could change in an instant. As one contemporary observer reported, “Those were the years in which the ladies of the middle- and higher- social classes felt that the thing to do was to look like a cocotte,” and he goes on to quip that this trend caused prostitutes to stop wearing makeup just to distinguish themselves from other women. It is this playful approach to the conflation of prostitutes and New Women that is often missing from current scholarship on Weimar, which tends to read prostitution as a simple trope for gendered exploitation. By looking beyond the dominant scholarly narrative on the Weimar Republic and examining the correspondence, film reviews, popular artworks, cabaret songs, and social commentary written by those who experienced the era for themselves, we find a response to prostitution in Berlin that complicates and transcends the dichotomy of victim and whore and that portrays an urban population that embraced, rather than rejected, changes in gender roles and a more audacious expression of sexuality."
