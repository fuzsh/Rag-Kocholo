        "text": "Grimme-Preis award winner, Matthias Schweighöfer, is one of Germany's most successful actors and is quickly becoming an international phenomenon.\n\nSchweighöfer was most recently seen in Christopher Nolan's film, \"Oppenheimer,\" Netflix's \"Heart of Stone\" opposite Gal Gadot and Jamie Dornan and \"The Swimmers\" for director Sally El Hosaini.

In addition, he founded his production company, Pantaleon Film, with his producing partner Dan Maag which continues to be one of Germany's preeminent production companies.\n\nBorn behind the Berlin wall, Schweighöfer's last 10 films have all reached #1 at the German Box office.

With more than 51 Million admissions no other German filmmaker drew more people to cinemas. He runs his own production company Barefoot Films based in Berlin, Germany.\n\nTil Schweiger (born December 19, 1963) was raised along with his two brothers in his hometown Giessen. In his early years, Schweiger began studying German and Medicine. He decided to drop out of university to pursue his career as an actor and went to drama school from 1986-1989. After graduation, he played at several theaters as a stage actor to gain more experience.\n\nIn 1991, Schweiger landed his first lead role in Manta, Manta (1991) following his big breakthrough role on Der bewegte Mann (1994) with the support of Germany's renowned film producer and mentor Bernd Eichinger. In 1996, Til Schweiger founded his first film production company Mr. Brown Entertainment together with business partner and film producer Tom Zickler. Schweiger debuted as producer with Knockin' on Heaven's Door (1997) winning several Festival Awards. The road movie remains a cult favorite with audiences worldwide. Within the same year, Schweiger was the first foreign actor to win the \"Polish Oscar\" at the International Warsaw Film festival for his performance in in Brute (1997). He has since built up acting credits in dozens of German movies including Der Eisbär (1998), where Schweiger made his debut as director.\n\nJudas Kiss (1998) was Schweiger's first role in an international film. He then appeared in several internationally acclaimed movies including Punk! (1998), The Replacement Killers - Die Ersatzkiller (1998), Driven (2001), Auf der Suche nach dem perfekten Orgasmus (2001), Lara Croft - Tomb Raider: Die Wiege des Lebens (2003), King Arthur (2004), Happy New Year (2011), and many more.\n\nTo this day, Schweiger has delivered a series of German-language hits and won numerous Awards as actor/writer/director/producer: Barfuss (2005) grossed about $7,7 million with 1,5 million admissions, Keinohrhasen (2007) was up to 2014 Schweiger's most successful film and earned some $74 million locally, followed by the sequel Zweiohrküken (2009). In 2011, Schweiger wrote, produced and directed Kokowääh (2011), which grossed $43 million, starring alongside his youngest daughter Emma. A sequel hit theaters in 2013.\n\nAs an actor, he received widespread critical acclaim and further recognition for his portrayal as the legendary Hugo Stieglitz in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009).\n\nIn December 2014, Til Schweiger released the family-friendly dramedy Honig im Kopf (2014) , which he co-wrote, directed, produced and starred in. It is his most successful film to date breaking the 6, 3 million admissions barrier of his 2007 hit Keinohrhasen (2007).\n\nSchweiger, who started his career in German TV, plays the lead role on hit local crimes series Tatort (1970)(Hamburg) (Scene of the Crime). His debut generated the best ratings for the long-running procedural in 20 years.\n\nChristoph Waltz is an Austrian-German actor. He is known for his work with American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, receiving acclaim for portraying SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) and bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Django Unchained (2012). For each performance, he won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, he received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his portrayal of Landa.\n\nChristoph Waltz was born in Vienna, Austria, into a theatrical family, his mother Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian-born costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a German-born stage builder. He has three siblings. His maternal grandmother was Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. His maternal grandfather, Rudolf von Urban, was a psychologist and psychiatrist who wrote the 1949 book \"Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness\".\n\nWaltz attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.\n\nDuring the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theatre, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly Waltz began to work in TV, taking one-off roles in series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed. Attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were, however, unsuccessful. Waltz has expressed his gratitude to have been able to make a living and support his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner.\n\nIt was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) catapulted Waltz from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar and Academy Award-winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he won again for 2012's Django Unchained (2012)).\n\nHe also has portrayed computer genius Qohen Leth in the film The Zero Theorem (2013), American plagiarist Walter Keane in the biographical film _Big Eyes (2014), and 007's nemesis and head of SPECTRE Ernst Stavro Blofeld in _Spectre (2015)_. In Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayed SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa, aka \"The Jew Hunter\". Clever, courteous, and multilingual - but also self-serving, cunning, implacable, and murderous. Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky in The Green Hornet (2011). That same year, he starred in Wasser für die Elefanten (2011), Roman Polanski's Der Gott des Gemetzels (2011), and a remake of Die drei Musketiere (2011). He played German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.\n\nWaltz resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His wife is costume builder Judith Holste.\n\nJürgen Prochnow is the son of a telecommunications engineer. He has an older brother, Dieter Prochnow, who is also in the acting profession. Jürgen's parents encouraged him initially to study the banking trade. However, their son had other ideas and began working on the side as an extra and a gaffer at a theater in Düsseldorf. He eventually commenced acting studies at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen in 1963. His graduation three years later was followed by a first theatrical engagement in Osnabrück. Between 1971 and 1975, Prochnow was a member of the ensemble of the Schauspielhaus Bochum under the direction of Peter Zadek.\n\nOn screen from 1971, he made his debut on the big screen in (what was also Wolfgang Petersen's first film) the thriller Einer von uns beiden (1974). Prochnow commanded the lead as a struggling student who blackmails his sociology professor (Klaus Schwarzkopf) after discovering that the academic had attained his credentials by means of a plagiarised doctoral thesis. Dire consequences ensue. That same year, Petersen also directed Prochnow in an episode of the hit police series Tatort (1970). In the New German Cinema of the 1970s, the charismatic Prochnow was given ample opportunities to shine, as he did in the title role of the prison drama Die Verrohung des Franz Blum (1974) and in Volker Schlöndorffs political drama Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum (1975) as a deserter wanted by the police and whose flight sparks a series of fateful events. During this period, the actor's stock-in-trade screen personae were laconic, taciturn types, often loners, yet men of integrity and strong emotional centres.\n\nProchnow's breakthrough to international stardom came via Wolfgang Petersen's brilliant maritime war drama Das Boot (1981). Prochnow took the nominal lead and was top-billed as the cool-headed, sympathetic veteran U-boat commander Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, a kind of father figure to his crew and affectionately known as 'the old man'. A contemporary New York Times reviewer commented \"The captain of the U-boat is played by Jurgen Prochnow, a remarkable actor who has also worked with Mr. Petersen on four other films. Mr. Prochnow's sad, solemn face rarely changes, but his pale eyes are extraordinarily alive. As the captain, he becomes a source of spiritual strength for his crewmen, even though his own cynicism is readily apparent\". While the story of Das Boot was fictionalized, it was in part based on the exploits of a real Lehmann-Willenbrock, who did, in fact, captain U-96 (as one of four commands). He was decorated with the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (one of the highest honours bestowed) and survived the war to become captain of Germany's nuclear freighter Otto Hahn.\n\nIn the wake of Das Boot, Prochnow received many offers from Hollywood, his craggy features and military bearing getting him frequently typecast as callous villains in action films: he was Eddie Murphy's nemesis Maxwell Dent in Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), a brutal Norman knight in Robin Hood - Ein Leben für Richard Löwenherz (1991), vicious gangster Charlie Dowd in Hurricane Smith (1992), the unhinged author of horror novels Sutter Cane in John Carpenter 's supernatural thriller Die Mächte des Wahnsinns (1994) and Judge Griffin, the chief villain of the piece who frames Sylvester Stallone for murder in Judge Dredd (1995). Prochnow also reunited with Wolfgang Petersen who directed him again in the box-office blockbuster Air Force One (1997) in the role of a rogue eastern European dictator bent on reigniting the Cold War. In season eight of the TV series 24: Twenty Four (2001), Prochnow featured as Jack Bauer's elusive antagonist Sergei Bazhaev, leader of a secret Russian crime syndicate.\n\nOn the side of the white hats, Prochnow has portrayed the ambitious banker André Vernet in The Da Vinci Code - Sakrileg (2006) and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the poorly received biographical drama Arnold - Sein Weg nach oben (2005) (Prochnow had once even been under consideration to play Arnie's iconic Terminator role). He has also been active in German films and television, including a role as an unscrupulous businessman attempting to market a pharmaceutical product with known harmful side-effects in Die dunkle Seite des Mondes (2015). On stage, he has essayed Etzel, king of the Huns in Siegfried's Erben at the 2018 Nibelungen Festival in Worms.\n\nAs a voice-over actor, Prochnow has been the German voice for Sylvester Stallone in several films (including Rocky (1976) and Rocky II (1979). He has also dubbed most of his own English-language roles into German. His awards include a Bambi in 1988 for his messianic role in Das Siebte Zeichen (1988), a Golden Kamera as Best German Actor for Das Boot and a Jupiter Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.\n\nProchnow adopted American citizenship in 2004, regularly commuting between Los Angeles and Munich. The actor's first wife was Isabel Goslar (daughter of Jürgen Goslar) who worked on Das Boot as a script supervisor and continuity manager. His second wife was the actress Birgit Stein who died in a motorcycle crash in Utah four years after her divorce from Prochnow in 2018. Since March 2015, Prochnow has been married to the Austrian actress Verena Wengler.\n\nSebastian Koch is one of the most internationally sought-after German actors of his generation. After stage engagements in Berlin, Bochum and Darmstadt, the Karlsruhe native was twice awarded the \"Grimme Prize\" in 2002 for the title role in Peter Keglevic's \"Der Tanz mit dem Teufel - Die Entführung des Richard Oetker\" (Dance with the devil - The kidnapping of Richard Oetker) and for his acting performance as Klaus Mann in the family story \"The Manns\" by Heinrich Breloer. He also received the \"Bavarian Television Award\" for his portrayal of Klaus Mann. His international breakthrough came in 2006 with director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Oscar-winning theatrical success \"The Lives Of Others\". For his outstanding portrayal of the GDR writer Georg Dreyman, Koch received numerous nominations and awards, including the 2007 Italian Foreign Press Award, the \"Globo d'Oro\" for Best European Actor.\n\nHe has since appeared in numerous international film productions. His performances in the historical drama \"Napoleon\" alongside Isabella Rossellini, Gérard Depardieu and John Malkovich, and alongside Catherine Deneuve in Benoît Jaquot's \"Princesse Marie\" (Marie Bonaparte, 2004) brought him great attention. He starred in Constantin Costa-Gavra's Hochhuth adaptation \"Amen\" (2002) and played the title role in Jo Baier's documentary \"Stauffenberg\". He received the \"German Television Award\" for his portrayal of Nazi criminal Albert Speer in Heinrich Breloer's multi-part series \"Speer and Hitler\".\n\nTogether with Paul Verhoeven, Sebastian Koch filmed the World War II drama \"Black Book\" (Zwartboek, 2006) and was nominated for an \"Emmy Award\" in 2008 for his portrayal of the title role in the international co-production \"The Sea Wolf\", based on Jack London's classic. He also appeared in Jaume Collet-Serra's \"Unknown\" (2011) with Liam Neeson, as well as Mike Figgis' \"Suspension Of Disbelief\" (2012). He assumed the lead role in the most successful Greek film of 2012, \"God Loves Caviar\" (O Theös Agapäei To Chaviäri), alongside John Cleese and Catherine Deneuve. Koch starred alongside Bruce Willis in John Moore's \"A Good Day To Die Hard\" (2013) and in the pilot of Ridley Scott's US series \"The Vatican\" (2014). He then co-starred with Daniel Auteuil in the German-French feature film \"Kalinka\" (Au Nom De Ma Fille, 2015) and with Oscar winners Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hooper in Hooper's Oscar-nominated bestselling adaptation \"The Danish Girl\" (2016). That same year, Sebastian Koch joined Tom Hanks in front of the camera for Steven Spielberg's \"Bridge Of Spies\", a story about brokering the first agent exchange in the Cold War - the film was nominated for an \"Academy Award\". Koch was lauded for his leading role in Kai Wessel's \"Fog In August\" (2016). In \"Bel Canto\" (2017), a film by Paul Weitz, he stars alongside Julianne Moore and Ken Watanabe. In the 5th and 6th seasons of the US series \"Homeland\", he played the German entrepreneur Otto Düring. The film \"Never Look Away\", yet another collaboration with director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, gained international attention after it premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in fall 2018 and was nominated for several Oscars and Golden Globes. Sebastian Koch received the \"Bambi\" in the category \"Best Actor National\" for the role of Prof. Seeband in 2018. In 2021, he was awarded the European film prize \"Die Europa\" at the Braunschweig International Film Festival. Most recently, Sebastian Koch starred in the German-Austrian thriller series \"Euer Ehren\" (Your Honor), which is set to air in spring 2022 on the German public broadcaster Das Erste. He was also involved in the creation of the scripts.\n\nSebastian Koch has been a member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) since July 2019.\n\nIn addition to his acting work, he regularly delights audiences with symphonic-scenic readings, including \"Paradise\" with violinist Daniel Hope, \"Dream Story\" with the Hubert Nuss Jazz Quartet and recently \"The Kreutzer Sonata\" after L. Tolstoy, which Sebastian Koch dramaturgically adapted and conceived as a stage play with piano and violin.\n\nHe spent his childhood and youth in Hesse, Westphalia and Lower Saxony. As a teenager he lived in the Wedemark region of Lower Saxony near Hanover. He spent his school years there, completing his high school diploma as an exchange student for the American Field Service AFS in Boston (USA). In 1977 he graduated from high school in Germany. He then did his military service. He then attended the University of Tübingen, where he studied German, English and history. During this time he also worked as a musician. It was at one of these performances that he was discovered for acting. In 1980, Ulrich Tukur started acting training at the Stuttgart State University of Music and Performing Arts. While he was still studying, he played the student and member of the resistance group against the Nazi dictatorship Willi Graf in the film \"The White Rose\" - directed by Michael Verhoeven.\n\nHe completed his training in 1983 and then initially played at the Heidelberg Municipal Theater. In Munich, Turkur had another engagement from this period, in which he took part in the play \"Illness of Youth\". The renowned theater maker Peter Zadek liked his acting skills and subsequently worked with him. It was also Zadek who brought Ulrich Tukur to success on stage in 1984. Tukur portrayed the SS soldier Kittel in the play \"Ghetto\" directed by Peter Zadek at the Freie Volksbühne Berlin. From 1985 to 1995 the actor was engaged at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg - under Peter Zadek as artistic director. During these ten years a fruitful collaboration developed between the two. Tukur played, among other things, in \"As You Like It\" by Shakespeare, Marc Anton in \"Julius Caesar\" based on Shakespeare, in Frank Wedekind's \"Lulu\" the role of Alwa Schön and in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".\n\nTukur's convincing stage performances were rewarded with the title \"Actor of the Year\" by German theater critics in 1986. From 1995, Tukur himself was director of the Hamburg Festival as director together with Ulrich Waller - until 2003. A year later, he appeared in a \"Tatort\" episode for the first time: in \"Das Böse\" he played Andrea Sawatzki's counterpart and appeared in He shot a mass murderer so brilliantly that he was awarded the German Television Prize for it. In 2009 he played the character of the same name in the film's lead role in the drama \"John Rabe\".
