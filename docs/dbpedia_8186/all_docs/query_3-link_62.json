        "text": "I learnt photography just by doing it, just like for almost everything else.\n\nI never wanted to become a photographer, it happened by coincidence. I aim to be a good journalist.\n\nI started by shooting concerts and one of my first gigs was a Brazilian heavy metal band. The concert was a blast but my pictures were not that great. That was the beginning of a daily challenge to take good pictures.\n\nThe assignment that left the biggest mark on me was covering the Egyptian uprising. Being at Tahrir square in Cairo for three weeks was an incredible experience.\n\nI love spending time with people for in-depth work assignments.\n\nPhotojournalism allows people see the world. It needs to be as authentic as possible.\n\nMy audiences are people who are interested in the world.\n\nMy biggest lesson has been donât waste other peopleâs time â promise less and deliver more.\n\nMy advice to a starting photojournalist would be: always tell the truth, never give up and never take yourself too seriously."
