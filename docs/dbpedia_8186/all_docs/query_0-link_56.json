        "text": "Guten Tag, Dipsy!\" \"Eh-oh! Tinky Winky! Did you know, Tinky Winky, that it is easier for the individual to follow the group than to think for himself?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's interesting, Dipsy!\"\n\nYou probably didn't realise it, but we have a lot to thank German kabarett for, not least because in Berlin a troupe of kabarett artistes has transformed the Teletubbies from gurgling, dippy blobs into fluent reciters of Brecht. The performers, Dresden-based Herkuleskeule, are among the many German troupes caught up in celebrations for the centenary of kabarett or performed satire.\n\nThe story behind kabarett provides an entertaining insight into recent German history, spanning the Weimar republic, the rise of Nazism, the communist era and the post-reunification period. It is perhaps best known to the outside world through the Liza Minnelli film Cabaret, but aficionados claim there is far more to it than that.\n\nKabarett was born on January 18 1901 with the opening of the first kabarett theatre. Inspired by evenings spent in Paris at Chat Noir, an artists' cafe that promoted socially critical \"cabaret artistique\" where poets and entertainers would do a turn on the stage in return for free beer, Ernst von Wollzogen decided to build his own theatre in Berlin.\n\nHe intended to produce high-quality artistic entertainment as a counterweight to the trashy music hall fare that dominated the city's stages at the time. But the German model immediately diverged from the French cabaret, as Wollzogen drew satirical magazine writers, composers and out-of-work actors to his stage to perform their often subversive songs. Soon they were developing the sharp individual style that typifies Berlin kabarett to this day. (It wasn't until the 1930s that the social commentator Kurt Tucholsky \"Germanised\" the word cabaret, derived from the French word for a tavern, thus making the distinction between the two forms - the frivolous and erotic versus the serious, intellectual and darkly humorous.)\n\nAudiences and potential performers both caught on quickly. In kabarett's first year of life, 40 groups applied for licences to start performing in Berlin. They were diverse in style, some following the French model, while others were more political in content.\n\n\"Initially,\" says Peter Sprengel, professor in early German literature at Berlin's Free University, \"there was a utopian idea that people could be educated and taught a sense of taste, but before long those aims were forgotten and commercial interests were dictating the programme.\"\n\nWomen had an important role from the start. A leading female light was Marya Delvard, who with her husband Marc Henry took kabarett to Vienna in 1906. After the first world war a pair of women, Rosa Valetti and Trude Hesterberg, injected new life into Berlin kabarett with their respective groups, Great Delusion and Wild Stage. Bertolt Brecht performed at the latter in 1922, causing a scandal with his anti-militaristic songs.\n\n\"It's one of kabarett's great strengths that it's so flexible,\" says Joanne McNally, a research fellow at the University of London. \"The three elements that make up kabarett - political and social criticism, entertainment, and the artistic aesthetic - can all shift according to the political climate, the ethos of the group or their location,\" she says.\n\nShe cites the group Die Wespen (\"the wasps\"), for which Brecht and Eric Muhsam wrote, and which at the end of the Weimar period used to play up the erotic elements as a cover for their hard-hitting political criticism.\n\nDie Katakombe, another group which had its heyday at the end of the Weimar republic, had to employ very indirect criticism. One of its members, Werner Finc, developed a style where he would deliver taboo words with a deliberate stammer or by immediately retracting what he'd said, suggesting he'd made a mistake. Words such as \"Dachau\" were delivered in an off-hand manner as performers left the stage, to alert audiences to the existence of the concentration camps. \"Fincisms\" were later used to great effect under communism in east Germany.\n\nVery little survived the Nazi clampdown in 1935, when many performers, particularly Jews, were forced to flee. Yet in the last place kabarett might have been expected to have any life, it thrived, albeit briefly. In the concentration camps it provided a few hours of light relief. \"The subject matter was less political,\" says McNally. \"It focused on the inmates' daily concerns, such as hoping for a food parcel or a better future.\"\n\nVolker KÃ¼hn, a cabaret writer who has made a documentary film about kabarett in the con centration camps, says: \"It seems absurd, but so were the times, and the locations were far removed from reality,\" he explains. \"Kabarett became a survival strategy for the performers.\"\n\nIn some camps kabarett was banned, in others it was tolerated, but in Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands, the camp commander was a huge fan and ordered a performance at least once a week. In Theresienstadt 40,000 would typically attend, and it wasn't unusual for three or four performances to be listed every day.\n\nIt was not until the 1950s that kabarett became a political force again. But stability has never been a typical feature of the environment in which kabarett has thrived. Soon Berlin was in two halves, separated by a wall. Eastern and western kabarett almost became two different art forms during the 40 years of division. But realising its importance to the people, the communist authorities ordered regular kabarett performances.\n\nDie Distel (\"The Thistle\"), still Berlin's most famous kabarett theatre, was the east's first professional kabarett house. The first programme was wryly titled: \"Humour is part of the overall plan.\" But there were strict rules. Solo performers were not allowed and texts were strictly controlled and could not be changed once the stamp of approval had been given.\n\nAs a result, eastern kabarett had a very rigid structure. \"It was up to the audience to do a lot of reconstruction,\" says McNally. \"Strategic ambiguity was adopted where the audience had to supply the critical content.\"\n\nAbsolute taboo subjects were GDR leader Erich Honecker and the Stasi, so a subtle form of language was developed to compensate. Thus Honecker was referred to as \"the supreme clown\". But clever intonation, a pause at a key moment, or delivery of a punchline in a mumble was enough to radically change a text from its meaning on the page.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin wall, with nothing left to satirise, it was feared that kabarett would not survive. Audiences drifted away, but by 1992 the public was knocking on the door again. \"After the fall of the wall we felt we didn't need satire any more, but then we realised that it was maybe even more necessary,\" says Helge, an easterner, on a night out with her girlfriends at Die Distel, where I found most of the audience to be from the west. Die Distel was privatised in 1991 and it is no mean feat that, in the brutal world of capitalism, all 12 of the former GDR's cabaret groups have survived the transition. There's now increasing evidence of eastern and western audiences mixing, as well as a crossover between writers and performers.\n\nSo just why is it such a Berlin artform? \"It would be too subtle for the Americans,\" says Sprengel. \"But Berlin has experienced many political variations, and that keeps kabarett on its toes, although how much it changes things is debatable.\"\n\nIt certainly shows no sign of going out of fashion. McNally uses it for advanced language teaching, the Bundestag has its own posse of kabarett artistes, and it is even used as a way of improving employer-employee relations and production levels in German companies.\n\nAnd you thought the Germans didn't know how to laugh?"
