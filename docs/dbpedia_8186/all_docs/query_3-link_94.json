This will be the case for the vast majority of notarial services requested.\n\nTake a look at our list of English-Speaking Lawyers in Germany or our list of English-speaking Notaries in Germany. You can also search for an English-speaking Notary in Germany.\n\nThese professional bodies can generally provide services more cheaply, quickly and conveniently.\n\nServices we provide in Germany\n\nThe British consulates general and British embassy in Berlin can only provide notarial services for British nationals in Germany where the requesting authority and the applicant can provide evidence that no other alternative is acceptable.\n\nWhere evidence can be provided, we can perform the following services by confirmed appointment only:\n\nAdminister an oath, affirmation or affidavit\n\nWitness a signature – we do not handle wills or probate, power of attorneys, or witness deed polls.

The British consulates general and British embassy in Berlin cannot provide certified copies of educational certificates for legalisation purposes by the Legalisation Office. Visit the Higher Education Degree Datacheck website at www.hedd.ac.uk for further guidance.\n\nFor information about documents relating to marriage under local law, please see getting married abroad.\n\nIf you can’t find the service you are looking for on this page, please see other services provided by the British embassy in Berlin.\n\nWhat to bring to your appointment\n\nYou must have a confirmed appointment before you come to the consulate or embassy.

The Legalisation Office in the UK can legalise UK public documents such as birth, death, marriage and divorce certificates. This is also known as an apostille.\n\nThe British consulates general and British embassy in Berlin cannot legalise UK public documents.

You can download the following Informative notes on change of name in the UK in German or English to show to the German authorities. This note cannot be personalised. It is not possible to change your name and/or surname by deed poll or declaration in Germany. You cannot change your name by deed poll if you’re a permanent resident overseas.\n\nData protection\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office holds and uses data for purposes notified to the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998. Such personal data may be disclosed to other UK government departments and public authorities.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis information is provided as a general guide and is based upon information provided to the embassy / consulate by the relevant authorities and may be subject to change at any time with little or no notice.
