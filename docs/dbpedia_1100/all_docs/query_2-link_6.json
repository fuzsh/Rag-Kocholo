        "text": "Despite the hostile view and belief toward the inclusion of language use in linguistic study and theorizing by the end of the 19 th century and the beginning of the 20 th century, some linguists have revolutionized linguistics. They authentically showed the importance to account for the social factors in linguistic theory. Indeed, the progress of research in linguistics in general and sociolinguistics in particular has led many linguists to stress the fact that no language is a monolithic and homogeneous (e.g. Bell 1976). In their view, language is a heterogeneous and dynamic system. Sociolinguists, therefore, aim to relate language and language users to the speech community where people interact. The present study is a sociolinguistic investigation which aims to relate linguistic aspects to other social aspects to examine certain linguistic features in Algerian Arabic, a variety which reflects linguistic variation in apparent time that rightly correspond to language change in real time in Sidi Bel Abbes speech community. This city is part of a diglossic and multilingual society-Algeria. As a matter of fact, our study tackles a problematic issue: How can the social changes (extra-linguistic factors) bring about changes in the linguistic system and how can individuals' speech differences make people themselves distinct on the ground of their affiliation to a certain social group? To explore the issue from a sociolinguistic angle, concrete data have been collected from different real setups , aiming to provide true evidence to our scope: language variation that leads to change, change in progress and completed change.\n\nNedromi speakers, especially the new generation, tend to correct some mistakes that they believe are stigmatised features in their speech and thus they try to shift to Modern Standard Arabic. This research paper aims at examining the impact of education on language use, which highlights the sociolinguistic variable, mainly that of education and age, and how it may affect the linguistic behaviour in Arabic. A Nedroma speech community is the sample population. This study emphasises phonological, morphological and lexical levels of analysis, trying to make use of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Such an analysis is viewed to help us understand some of the reasons behind such a change in linguistic behaviours essentially motivated by the influence of education. The results show that the choice of certain linguistic features by the individual is determined by the speaker’s age category, his level of education and, most importantly, his attitude towards certain linguistic charac...\n\nDistinguishing linguistic change at the community level (‘generational change’) from linguistic change at the individual level (‘age grading’) is “one of the major issues in contemporary sociolinguistics” (Tagliamonte 2012:247). This article gives a brief history of the study of language change in the community, before turning to the types of linguistic behavior that have been observed across individuals’ lifespans. The article also discusses the meanings that have been attributed to the term ‘age grading’, arguing that consensus cannot be reached without more longitudinal work to determine the limits of lifespan linguistic change.\n\nThe present study deals with the phenomenon of lexical loss in Al-Koura Rural Dialect in Irbid Governorate, in the northern part of Jordan. Some pre-cultural words suffer from loss and disappearance, and hence, become obsolete. The study aims at identifying the pre-cultural words that are undergoing lexical loss. The study also investigates the diffusion of pre-cultural words among the young generation speakers. The study also examines the linguistic and extra linguistic factors such as solidarity marker, level of education on certain pre-cultural words among the young generation. The present study involved two central methods necessary to achieve the purposes of the study. The first method was to make interview recordings with old group members to collect pre-cultural words through addressing general questions. The questions covered a variety of topics such as food, clothes, glasses and weather. The second method was to compile a questionnaire with the pre-cultural words to be distributed among the young speakers. The questionnaire contained 222 pre-cultural words which refer to several spheres and contexts of life in the society at the previous era. The questionnaire was distributed to 400 young participants. The study group included school and college male and female students. The study group also included other employees from different governmental sectors in Al-Koura District. The findings showed that 168 words were not much familiar to the young speakers. The findings also revealed that the pre-cultural words were sort of familiar to the male young speakers rather than the female young speakers. The lower the age, the less familiar s/he with the traditional pre-cultural words. The educated young speakers who have a lower or medium education level obtain little knowledge of pre-cultural words. The solidarity among the young speakers appeared to be higher than that of the old people.\n\nOver the past few decades native speakers in Tlemcen have come into regular contact with rural speech users as a result of massive in-migration. It is surprisingly interesting that, though the usual pattern attested in urban speech communities reflects an obvious influence of the dominant language variety over the minority speakers, non-native speakers, now settled in Tlemcen, are hardly ever influenced by urban speech features. Rather, the overall pattern reveals increasing accommodation from the part of native urban speakers to rural forms. This one-way switch occurs almost exclusively among males, and more so among younger ones, particularly in mixed interactions. Female speakers, on the other hand, seem to break away from the rule by maintaining their native speech whatever the situation."
