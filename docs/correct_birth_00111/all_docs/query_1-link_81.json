        "text": "Frederick W. Hanson, age 67, a longtime resident of Braintree, died suddenly, Monday, April 8, 2024 at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth.\n\nBorn in Boston, Fred was raised and educated in Braintree. A graduate of Xaverian Brothers High School, Class of 1974, he went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Massachusetts Boston, Class of 1978.\n\nFor over forty-two years, Fred was fortunate enough to have a job he loved as a Patriot Ledger staff reporter. He took pride in mentoring so many “cub” reporters, helping them develop their personal style and careers. He was the long-standing president of the Patriot Ledger Newsroom Association. His loss will be deeply felt by his family, friends, colleagues, and the South Shore communities he served.\n\nHis broad range of interests included avid reading, history, politics, civic engagement, traveling, film noir, music, and concerts – he was a proud, original Parrothead. A lover of all Boston sports teams, he also had a special affinity for the Toronto Blue Jays since their expansion. Fred penned short special stories to personalize every greeting card he sent. He was a true renaissance man.\n\nBeloved son of Ann J. “Nancy” (Dempsey) Hanson of Braintree and the late Frederick W. Hanson Jr., D.M.D.\n\nOne of thirteen siblings, Fred was the devoted brother of Katherine M. Hanson of Braintree, Elizabeth A. Hanson of Quincy, Margaret E. Iverson and her husband Mark of Hanover, Francis X. Hanson and his wife Renee of Orefield, Pa., Patricia R. Hanson and her husband Mitchell Waters of Hanover, John L. Hanson of Randolph, Barbara J. Lynch and her husband Neil of Lake Forest, Ill., Thomas P. Hanson of Braintree, Regina M. Hanson of Belmont, Susan T. Hanson and her husband Christopher Morris of Belmont, Christopher J. Hanson of Hanover, Julie F. Hanson, D.M.D. and her husband Eram Zaheer of Shrewsbury.\n\nLoving uncle of Taylor and Emily Hanson, Christian and Erik Iverson, Mary Waters, Kamran and Aidan Zaheer, twins Vivienne and Bennett Morris, Patrick, Daniel, and Matthew Lynch.\n\nLifelong friend of Thomas McDermott and his wife Marissa of Pembroke Pines, Fla. and godfather of Lara McDermott of Jacksonville, Fla. Fred is also survived by many cousins, friends, and their families. Family meant everything to Fred.\n\nVisiting hours will be held at the Sweeney Brothers Home for Funerals, 1 Independence Avenue, Quincy, on Friday, April 12, from 4 – 7 p.m. Relatives and friends are invited to attend. A Funeral Mass will be celebrated at Saint Francis of Assisi Church, 856 Washington Street, Braintree, on Saturday, April 13, at 10 a.m. Interment to follow at St. Joseph Cemetery, 990 LaGrange Street, West Roxbury.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Fred’s memory may be made to WUMB Radio, UMass Boston, 100 Morrissey Boulevard, Boston, MA 02125 or the Marge Crispin Center, c/o Ann Toland, 46 Lincoln Street, Braintree, MA 02184."
