        "text": "Soon thereafter in 1874, Watson met Alexander Graham Bell, then a young Boston University professor looking for help with his “harmonic telegraph.” Bell felt the machine could send more than one message over a wire simultaneously.\n\nThe two were working on the machine on June 2, 1875, between two rooms on the top floor of 109 Court Street in Boston, when Watson began plucking one of the transmitting reeds with his fingers. Bell suddenly burst in demanding to know what Watson had done, because he had heard the sound of the reed, which had accidentally been too tightly adjusted.\n\nThe twang Bell heard spurred them on. On March 10, 1876, the two were working on a new type of transmitter in which a wire touched diluted sulfuric acid in a metal cup. Another wire ran between two rooms at 5 Exeter Place in Boston. While Watson waited in Bell’s bedroom with his ear pressed to the receiving telephone, he was surprised to hear Bell’s voice coming from it saying, “Mr. Watson, come here, I want you!” Watson dashed down the hall and found that Bell had upset one of the acid containers and the liquid spilled on his clothes. The accident was quickly forgotten when they realized the telephone had at last spoken.\n\nDuring the summer of 1876, Bell and Watson engaged in the first actual conversation by telephone between two stations on an outdoor wire. To raise money to carry on the work, Bell and Watson presented a series of lectures to explain and demonstrate the telephone. Watson’s function was to furnish vocal entertainment that was transmitted to the hall from several miles away. He also made exhibition models of the new telephone for Bell to show at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in June 1876.\n\nWith all the publicity and popularity of the new invention, it was fortunate that Gardiner Hubbard had filed the patent application. U.S. Patent No. 174,465, generally considered the most valuable patent ever issued, was granted to Bell on March 7, 1876, three days before the first transmission of the first intelligible sentence.\n\nWatson moved to a 60-acre farm in East Braintree in June 1883 with his bride, the former Elizabeth Seaver Kimball of Cohasset. The farm featured a half-mile frontage along the Weymouth Fore River, an arm of the sea.\n\nSoon a friend told Watson about a new rotary steam engine that needed a machinist’s skills. Watson hired young machinist Frank O. Wellington to help him on the project, which was completed in the spring of 1885. The steam engine failed, however, because some of its moving parts could not be made steam-tight. Desiring to keep the machine shop open and Wellington in his employ, Watson decided to build marine engines for yachts and tug boats. The Fore River Engine Company was born and Watson brought Wellington on as a business partner.\n\nWatson was appointed in 1890 to serve on a special committee to examine school building plans. He later became a member of the school committee in 1892, serving through 1910. During that time, he promoted construction of new and better school buildings to meet state standards. He also favored adding new subjects to the traditional curriculum such as sewing, cooking and carpentry. The town opened a night school in 1911.\n\nThe town benefited from Mr. and Mrs. Watson’s keen interest in kindergartens. The couple fitted up the machine shop on their property, hired a teacher, and opened a kindergarten for 12 neighborhood children. It proved such a success that the town opened kindergartens in all sections as part of the regular school system, becoming the first municipality in New England to do so."
