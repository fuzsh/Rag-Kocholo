        "text": "Travel back in time at the Adams National Historical Park, where you'll visit the birthplaces of not one, but two U.S. presidents: John Adams and his son, John Quincy Adams. Your journey begins at the park's Visitor Center in Quincy Center: After viewing the center's exhibits and video presentation, board a trolley for the short journey to the quaint colonial saltbox birthplaces of the presidents. From there, you'll travel to \"Peacefield,\" the stately Adams mansion that served as summer White House to both Adams presidents and home to generations of their descendants. While at the Adams Mansion, be sure to visit the impressive Stone Library, built to house the Adams' collection of some 14,000 historic volumes, including the library of John Quincy Adams.\n\nHours: Daily, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. April 19-November 10. Tours leave from Visitor Center every quarter past and quarter to the hour. Last tour departs at 3:15 p.m.\n\nAdmission: $5 for adults; children 16 and under are free.\n\nVisit Our Site"
