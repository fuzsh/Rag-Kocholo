        "text": "Braintree, Massachusetts\n\nAlso referred to as Mt. Wollaston,Â Merrymount, andÂ Quincy\n\nBraintree was first owned by the Sagamore of the Massachusetts tribe ofÂ Algonquin IndiansÂ of Greater Boston and New England.\n\nBraintree was founded on land first colonized in 1625 by Captain Wollaston, and initially named Mount Wollaston. Under the rule of Thomas Morton it was renamed Merry Mount. The area was resettled and incorporated as the town of Braintree, named after Braintree,Â Essex, England, in 1640. Braintree originally included territory from which Randolph, Holbrook, the City of Quincy, and part of Milton were split off. Braintree was part ofÂ Suffolk CountyÂ until the formation ofÂ Norfolk CountyÂ in 1793. [11]\n\nThe riverÂ herring from the Monatiquot River were a key element of the colonial economy of Braintree. Later, the riverâs strong flow was useful for early industry such asÂ grist mills. This river was also where Paul Revere operated a Nail Mill.\n\nThe town of Braintree was the birthplace of presidentsÂ John AdamsÂ andÂ John Quincy Adams, as well as statesmanÂ John Hancock. GeneralÂ Sylvanus Thayer, the \"father ofÂ West Point\", was born in the section of town now known as Braintree Highlands.\n\nJohnson Direct Line Ancestors in Braintree/Quincy\n\nFerdinando Thayer (1625-1713) and Huldah Hayward (1636-1690)\n\nWilliam Hayward (1604- ) and Margery Knight (1610-1676)\n\nRichard and Margaret Wright ( - 1667/8)\n\nPlaces to visit in Braintree\n\nAdams National Historical Park\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree,_Massachusetts\n\n\"History of Braintree, Massachusetts (1639-1708) https://archive.org/stream/historyofbraintr00adam/historyofbraintr00adam_djvu.txt"
