        "text": "The home in Quincy where John Adams, the second president of the United States, was born is undergoing restorations this winter, the Adams National Historical Park announced.\n\nWorkers will replace some of the pine siding of the home with more weather-resistant Sitka spruce wood, Kevin Kelly, the park’s facilities manager, said. A vapor barrier will also be installed to protect the original wood of the house from moisture.\n\nKelly said the project is “a pretty major undertaking” that he hopes to have complete by the time the park reopens in May for guided tours.\n\nThe project will be funded by visitor fees and is expected to cost about $100,000, Kelly said.\n\nThis is only the first phase of the restoration project, which will address the entire 35-year-old exterior of the building over the next few years, Kelly said. The current phase will focus on the siding on the front and west side of the building, the front door, and some of the windows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s pretty deteriorated,” Kelly said. “It’s made of pine, and pine doesn’t weather very well.”\n\nThe way the wood panels overlap on the side of the home is unique and requires a hand-cut nail to fasten the pieces together. To preserve the “historical fabric” of the building and not change its appearance too much, the workers will continue this style of siding, Kelly said.\n\nThe rural cottage was built in 1681 and was bought by Adams’s father in 1720, according to the park’s website. Adams was born in the home on Oct. 30, 1735, and his father bought the home next door in 1744.\n\nThe Adams National Historical Park in Quincy includes the two homes and the land, which housed five generations of the Adams family, including John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. The park hosts guided tours from May 1 through Oct. 31 each year.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email\n\nMaria Lovato can be reached at maria.lovato@globe.com.
