        "text": "The Great American Political Experiment\n\nFrom the American Revolution to the Civil War, and from the industrial age to modern times, four generations of the Adams family confronted some of this nation's greatest challenge in war and politics. They also achieved enormous successes in diplomacy, history, and art and letters. The family history unfolds uncannily parallel to the nation's rapid transformation from 13 disparate British colonies into a United States and a world power.\n\n\"I must study politics and war, that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy,\" wrote Revolution-era leader and second President John Adams. His prophetic words foretold both the Adams family public personas and America's rapid growth. Indeed, his sons would study diplomacy, navigation, and commerce, and their sons studied history, art, and literature. \"... America made the Adamses possible ... and the Adamses expressed America,\" historian Daniel J. Boorstin observed. Adams National Historical Park commemorates these men and women who dedicated their lives to developing and serving their nation. The park is the birthplace homes of Presidents John and John Quincy Adams. It is also the Old House at Peace field, home to the four illustrious Adams generations, from 1788 to 1927. It is as well the Stone Library whose 12,000 volumesthe breadth and depth of American and European thoughtembodied the family's intellectual prowess and the nation's intellectual promise.\n\nThese legendary accomplishments might suggest that American power and progress were foregone conclusions. But rebellion and nation building, industrialization and developing a distinctive national culture were anything but foregone conclusions for a fledgling nation. They were the staggering accomplishments that these historic landscapes, structures, and library and museum collections commemorate.\n\nThe Adams family's devotion to the public interest runs like a scarlet thread throughout the tapestry of American history.\n\nPresident john F. Kennedy\n\nThe birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams are the nation's oldest presidential birthplaces. They stand on their original foundations at the foot of Penn's Hill, 75 feet apart.\n\nJohn Adams, the nation's second president, grew up in this rural settingseven miles south of Boston and less than a mile from the seawhere his father Deacon John Adams farmed in summer and made shoes in winter.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard College and being admitted to the Massachusetts Bar, John Adams married Abigail Smith on October 25, 1764. The young couple moved into the farmhouse next to Deacon John's. In this humble setting, the young lawyer cultivated his career in politics and law and drafted the Massachusetts Constitution. This \"little cottage\" was the birthplace of their oldest son and sixth president of the United States John Quincy Adams.\n\nIn this simple saltbox Abigail Adams, loving confidant and prolific correspondent to her often absent husband, assumed the role of \"patriot on the homefront.\" Abigail melted her pewter spoons to make musket balls for the Continental Army. The couple's oldest son John Quincy Adams was truly a child of the American Revolution.\n\nIt is but the farm of a patriot.\n\nJohn Adams\n\nFrom Working Farm to Country Estate to National Historical Park\n\nReturning to a grateful nation in 1788 after years abroad as a diplomat and minister plenipotentiary, John Adams with his wife Abigail moved into a \"very Genteel Dwelling House\" on 75 acres just over a mile from their humble farmhouse. \"I think to christen my Place by the Name of Peace field,\" John Adams wrote, \"in commemoration of the Peace which I assisted in making in 1783 ...\" He continued to serve his country as the first vice president and second president of the United States. He and Abigail spent their retirement years living here year-round. Their descendents would only summer at what they affectionately called the \"Old House,\" today's \"Old House\" at \"Peace field.\" In time \"Peace field\" was changed from a working farm to a country estate as farming gave way to horticulture. John Quincy Adams found great satisfaction and comfort in planting trees and lived by the motto \"he plants for future generations.\" His son Charles Francis Adams transformed his grandmother's kitchen garden into a formal flower garden bounded by the ancient boxwood hedge. By 1927 Brooks Adams, the last family member to live in the house, had set the stage for the Adams Memorial Society, made up of the direct descendents of John and Abigail Adams, to manage the property. In 1946 the National Park Service accepted the Adams family estate from the Society, to continue the family mandate to inspire \"civic virtue and patriotism.\" \"Peace field\" resonates with the meanings that four Adams family generations invested in this place. Posterity you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom, wrote John Quincy Adams. I hope you will make good use of it. A visit to Adams National Historical Parkto the Presidential Birthplaces, \"Old House\" at \"Peace field,\" Stone Library, Carriage House, and the outstanding museum collectionsenables you to walk in the footsteps of one of the America's great founding families.\n\n\"I think to christen my Place by the Name of Peace field.\"\n\nJohn Adams\n\nPlanning Your Day\n\n(click for larger map)\n\nThe park is open seven days a week, April 19 through November 10.
