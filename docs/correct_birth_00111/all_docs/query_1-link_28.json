        "text": "Presidents Day is Feb. 20, and it's not just a holiday made famous by robust car sales.\n\n\"It was originally established to establish the birthday of first American president, George Washington,\" according to Norfolk County Register of Deeds William P. O'Donnell. It later recognized Abraham Lincoln as well — the two men's birthdays are just a few days apart.\n\nO'Donnell added that many may not know this piece of presidential trivia — four past commanders-in-chief were born in Norfolk County, Massachusetts.\n\nWhat Presidents were born in Norfolk County?\n\nAccording to O'Donnell, our nation's second president, John Adams, was born on Oct. 30, 1735, in a section of Quincy that was formerly part of Braintree. Adams graduated from Harvard College in 1755. He taught grammar school in Worcester, and in 1758 he moved back to Braintree and began practicing law in nearby Boston.\n\nThe 1780 Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, drafted by Adams, is the world’s oldest functioning written constitution, O'Donnell added. It served as a model for the United States Constitution, which was written in 1787.\n\nO'Donnell said that Adams' son, John Quincy Adams, the sixth U.S. president, was also born in a part of Quincy that was split off from Braintree. Like his father, he also attended Harvard College. Before becoming president in 1825, he served as a diplomat, foreign minister, ambassador to foreign nations and treaty negotiator.\n\nPresidents born in N.E.:Did you know George W. Bush was one of them?\n\n\"John Quincy Adams drafted the Monroe Doctrine,\" O'Donnell said. \"He was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history.\"\n\nFollowing his single four-year term, Adams became a member of the House of Representatives, where O'Donnell said he \"conducted a consistent and dramatic fight against the expansion of slavery.\"\n\nO'Donnell reported that the 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, was born on May 29, 1917, \"at 83 Beals St. in Brookline, a three-story house built in 1909, located in a middle-class neighborhood.\"\n\nKennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940. During World War II, he was a patrol torpedo boat commander in the Pacific Theater.\n\n\"After the war, Kennedy represented the 11th Congressional District of the U.S. House of Representatives,\" according to O'Donnell. \"He then won election to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts. While serving in the Senate, he published 'Profiles in Courage,' which won the Pulitzer Prize.\"\n\nFinally, the nation's 41st president, George Herbert Walker Bush, was born on June 12, 1924, at 173 Adams St. in Milton. Bush spent only the first year of his life there; his parents, Prescott and Dorothy Walker Bush, then moved the family to Connecticut.\n\n\"The home at 173 Adams St. has changed hands several times since the Bush family lived there, and remains a private residence to this day,\" said O'Donnell. \"In 1997, at a ceremony attended by the former president, a sign and plaque were unveiled outside the home to mark its historic significance.\"\n\nWhat are the origins of the holiday?\n\nPresidents Day is celebrated on the third Monday in February.\n\nAccording to O'Donnell, it was originally established in 1885 to \"recognize the accomplishments of and memorialize the first president of the United States, George Washington.\" O'Donnell added that the concept of a day celebrating a president dates back to 1800, the year after Washington died.\n\n\"His Feb. 22 birthday became an annual day of remembrance,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nO'Donnell said the unofficial holiday gained widespread popularity, as even then, Washington was considered a legend. So in 1879, President Rutherford B. Hayes signed legislation to make Feb. 22 a federal holiday, but it took another six years to be celebrated nationally.\n\n\"Delving deeper into the history of this day reveals that even though most people know the federal holiday as Presidents Day, neither Congress nor any president has ever specified that the name of the holiday observed as 'Washington’s Birthday' be changed to 'Presidents Day,'\" O'Donnell noted.\n\nMonday Holiday Law\n\nThat's because in 1968, O'Donnell continued, Congress passed the Monday Holiday Law to \"provide uniform annual observances of certain legal public holidays on Mondays.\"\n\n\"By creating more three-day weekends, Congress hoped to stimulate the economy and give workers more time off,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nO'Donnell noted the law changed two things about the holiday.\n\n\"First, it was adapted to also honor the birth of United States President Abraham Lincoln (Feb. 12), and second, it was moved to be observed between both birthdays on the third Monday in February,\" he said. \"For many, the day has become a time to honor all presidents, past and present.\"\n\nPresidents Day events\n\nPresidents Day Winterfest Quincy, 2-7 p.m. on Monday, Feb. 20.
