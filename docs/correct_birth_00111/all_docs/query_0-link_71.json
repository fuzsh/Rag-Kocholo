This print showcases the birthplace of one of America's most influential figures, John Adams. Located in Braintree, now known as Quincy, Massachusetts, this charming house holds great historical significance. John Adams (1735-1826) was not only the second President of the United States but also served as the first Vice President under George Washington. As a Founding Father and a key figure in shaping American democracy, his contributions to the nation are immeasurable. The lithograph beautifully captures the essence of this rural home where John Adams spent his early years. Surrounded by picturesque landscapes and nestled amidst nature's beauty, it provides a glimpse into his humble beginnings. Notably, John Adams was also renowned for being the first President to reside in what is now known as the White House. His legacy extends beyond his presidency; he was also father to another notable leader - John Quincy Adams (1767-1848), who later became America's sixth President. This remarkable image transports us back in time and allows us to appreciate both the architectural charm and historical importance of this homestead. It serves as a reminder of our nation's rich heritage and pays homage to an extraordinary individual whose impact continues to resonate today.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
