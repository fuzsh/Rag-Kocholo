        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nBraintree (US pronunciation: /ˈbreɪnˌtri/), officially the Town of Braintree, is a suburban New England city in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States. Although officially known as a town, Braintree adopted a municipal charter, effective 2008, with a mayor-council form of government, and is considered a city under Massachusetts law.[5] The population was 35,744 at the 2010 census.[6] The town is part of the Greater Boston area with access to the MBTA Red Line, and is a member of the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission's South Shore Coalition.[7] The first and current mayor of Braintree is Joe Sullivan.[8][9]\n\nBraintree, Massachusetts is named after Braintree, Essex in England. The town was first chartered in 1640. Later, some sections of Braintree formed separate municipalities: Quincy (1792), Randolph (1793), and Holbrook (1872).\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe town of Braintree was settled in 1625,[1] colonized in 1635 and incorporated in 1640[3] and named after the English town of Braintree. In addition to the present Braintree, it comprised land that was later split-off into the separate municipalities of Quincy (incorporated in 1792), Randolph (1793), and Holbrook (1872).[10] Braintree was part of Suffolk County until the formation of Norfolk County in 1793.[11]\n\nThe town of Braintree was the birthplace of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, as well as statesman John Hancock. General Sylvanus Thayer, the \"father of West Point\", was born in the section of town now known as Braintree Highlands.\n\nBraintree was the site of the infamous 1920 murders that led to the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti. It was the retirement home of the co-inventor of the telephone, Thomas A. Watson.\n\nBraintree's population grew by over 50% during the 1920s.[12]\n\nIn January 2008, Braintree converted from a representative town meeting form of government to a mayor-council government.\n\nGeography[]\n\nBraintree shares borders with Quincy to the north, Randolph to the west (separated by the Cochato River), Holbrook to the south, and Weymouth to the east.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 14.5 square miles (37.6 km²), of which 13.9 square miles (36.0 km²) is land and 0.6 sq mi (1.6 km²) is water. The total area is 4.34% water\n\nPark and recreation locations in Braintree include Pond Meadow Park, Sunset Lake, and Blue Hills Reservation.\n\nEnvironment[]\n\nBraintree has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) with some maritime influence. Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 69.7 °F (20.9 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean of 25.7 °F (−3.5 °C). Periods exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each, respectively. The city's average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5. Official temperature records have ranged from −21 °F (−29 °C) in February 1934, up to 101 °F (38 °C) in August 1949 and 1974.\n\nBraintree's coastal location on the North Atlantic moderates its temperature, but makes the city very prone to nor'easter weather systems that can produce much snow and rain. The city averages 48.63 inches (1,240 mm) of precipitation a year, with 61.1 inches (155 cm) of snowfall per season. Snowfall increases dramatically as one goes inland away from the city (especially north and west of the city)—away from the moderating influence of the ocean.\n\nMost snowfall occurs from December through March, as most years see no measurable snow in April and November, and snow is rare in May and October. There is also high year-to-year variability in snowfall; for instance, the winter of 2011−12 saw only 24.2 in (61.5 cm) of accumulating snow, but in the 2014–15 winter, the figure was 150.8 in (3.83 m).\n\nFog is fairly common, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region, especially in late summer and early autumn. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city is often subjected to sea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 °F (11 °C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday.\n\nThunderstorms occur from May to September, and are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Although Braintree has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common in areas north, west, and northwest of the city.\n\nTemplate:Blue Hills, Massachusetts weatherbox\n\nDemographics[]\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income\n\nHistorical population Year Pop. ±% 1800 1,285 — 1810 1,351 +5.1% 1820 1,466 +8.5% 1830 1,758 +19.9% 1840 2,168 +23.3% 1850 2,969 +36.9% 1860 3,468 +16.8% 1870 3,948 +13.8% 1880 3,855 −2.4% 1890 4,848 +25.8% 1900 5,981 +23.4% 1910 8,066 +34.9% 1920 10,580 +31.2% 1930 15,712 +48.5% 1940 16,378 +4.2% 1950 23,161 +41.4% 1960 31,069 +34.1% 1970 35,050 +12.8% 1980 36,337 +3.7% 1990 33,836 −6.9% 2000 33,828 −0.0% 2010 35,744 +5.7% 2016 37,297 +4.3%\n\n= population estimate.\n\nSource: United States Census records and Population Estimates Program data.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]\n\nSource: U.S. Decennial Census[23][24]\n\nAs of the census[25] of 2000, there were 33,828 people, 12,652 households, and 8,907 families residing in the town.

As of 2014 Braintree had the 2nd highest concentration of Irish Americans in the entire country, slightly behind Scituate, Massachusetts.[26]\n\nThere were 12,652 households out of which 29.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.4% were married couples living together, 11.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.6% were non-families. 24.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.16.\n\nIn the town the population was spread out with 22.5% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 28.9% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.4 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town is $85,590, and the median income for a family is $90,590 as of a 2007 estimate[27]). Males had a median income of $89,607 versus $36,034 for females. The per capita income for the town was $28,683. About 2.1% of families and 3.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.6% of those under age 18 and 3.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\nSports[]\n\nBraintree High School participates in the Bay State Conference, a Division 1 conference in the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association. The girls' basketball team has won back-to-back state championships and finished 2014 undefeated.[28] The Braintree High dance team competes at the regional and national stage.[29] The Wamps baseball team won the Super Eight Baseball Tournament in 2015 over St. John's Preparatory School in their second-straight finals appearance.[30]\n\nBraintree American Little League plays at Michael F. Dunn Little League Complex located at Hollingsworth Park. East Braintree Little League plays at Watson Park.\n\nThe Braintree Athletic Complex is scheduled to be located at Braintree High School and will feature two ice hockey rinks, a basketball court, a multi-use court, a swimming pool and an indoor baseball diamond.[31]\n\nEducation[]\n\nBraintree is home to various educational institutions, both public and private.\n\nPublic primary and secondary education[]\n\nPublic education at the primary and secondary levels is managed by Braintree Public Schools (BPS), a system that includes one kindergarten center, six elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school.\n\nPublic high school\n\nBraintree High School\n\nPublic middle schools\n\nEast Middle School\n\nSouth Middle School\n\nPublic elementary schools\n\nFlaherty Elementary School\n\nHighlands Elementary School\n\nHollis Elementary School\n\nLiberty Elementary School\n\nMorrison Elementary School\n\nRoss Elementary School\n\nPrivate and alternative education[]\n\nPrivate and alternative education institutions in Braintree include Thayer Academy (TA) and Archbishop Williams High School (AWHS). CATS Academy, an internationally focused boarding school with three campuses in the United Kingdom, is in the process of building a school in the Braintree Highlands area and planned to open in 2016.[32]\n\nInfrastructure[]\n\nTransportation[]\n\nBraintree is situated in the Greater Boston Area, which has rail, air, and highway facilities. State Route 128 and Interstate 95 divide the region into inner and outer zones, which are connected by numerous \"spokes\" providing direct access to the airport, port, and intermodal facilities of Boston.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1968, the town was the home of Braintree Airport, a general aviation airport located near Great Pond that was used by civil defense officials and private pilots. The airport featured a 2,800 foot dirt runway and offered flight training. Residential development, proximity to the town's water supply, and a number of accidents led to its closure in 1968.[33][34]\n\nPrincipal highways in Braintree are Interstate 93 (which runs concurrently with U.S. 1) and Route 3, as well as 37, and 53. Entering Braintree from the north, I-93, Route 1, and Route 3 all run concurrently as the Southeast Expressway from Boston; in Braintree they diverge, with Route 3 heading south toward Cape Cod as the Pilgrims Highway, and I-93 and Route 1 heading west toward Route 128.\n\nCommuter rail service to South Station, Boston, is available on the Middleboro & Plymouth lines from the Braintree Red Line/Commuter Rail Station located on Union Street. The CapeFLYER rail service from Boston to Hyannis as well as Buzzards Bay stations also stops at Braintree Station. The MBTA Red Line is accessible at the same location. Weekday rail service on the Greenbush Line started in late 2007 and is accessible from the Weymouth Landing/East Braintree station on Quincy Avenue.\n\nCommerce[]\n\nBraintree is home to several large companies, including Altra Industrial Motion, Greater Media, Haemonetics, and TopSource LLC.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1991 Braintree was the home of a Valle's Steak House restaurant. The chain was an East Coast landmark that stretched from Maine to Florida. The 30,000 square foot Braintree restaurant was the largest in the chain when it opened, and featured a dining room that sat 600 customers, banquet rooms that accommodated 1,000, parking for 700 cars, and two kitchens, one used exclusively for banquets. The restaurant had over 150 employees. Max Bodner of Quincy was the original manager.[35] One of the chain's busiest locations, it was capable of serving over 5,000 customers per day.[36] The restaurant changed names several times after the Valle's corporation closed in 1991 and was eventually razed to make way for a Toyota dealership.[37] Among the notable moments in the restaurant's history was in 1980 when then presidential candidate Ronald Reagan made a campaign speech at a South Shore Chamber of Commerce luncheon.[38]\n\nPoints of interest[]\n\nBlue Hills Reservation\n\nGeneral Sylvanus Thayer Birthplace\n\nHollingsworth Park\n\nMonatiquot River\n\nPond Meadow Park\n\nSouth Shore Plaza\n\nSunset Lake\n\nNotable people[]\n\nAbigail Adams, wife of President John Adams; mother of John Quincy Adams\n\nHenry Adams, original emigrant to the Americas\n\nJeremy Adams, original emigrant to the Americas\n\nJohn Adams, signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence; first Vice President of the United States, serving eight years; second President of the United States, serving four years\n\nJohn Quincy Adams, diplomat, sixth President of the United States, serving four years; member of the United States House of Representatives\n\nJoe Amorosino, reporter and sports director for WHDH-TV.\n\nAmy Bishop, perpetrator of the 2010 University of Alabama in Huntsville shooting\n\nOscar Florianus Bluemner, German-born American Modernist painter\n\nJim Calhoun, former head coach of University of Connecticut men's basketball team\n\nPriscilla Chan, philanthropist and pediatrician; wife of Mark Zuckerberg\n\nChris Doherty, musician and recording artist from the band Gang Green\n\nBrian Gibbons, NHL player\n\nJohn Hancock, signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence; fourth President of the Continental Congress; first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; diplomat and statesman\n\nTiffany Kelly, beauty pageant winner, Miss Massachusetts of 2006\n\nPeter Kormann, gymnast and winner of the bronze medal in men's floor competition at the 1976 Olympics\n\nDon McKenney, hockey center; captain of the Boston Bruins, 1954–1963\n\nJose Offerman, baseball player for the Boston Red Sox[39]\n\nWilliam Rosenberg, creator of the Dunkin' Donuts restaurant chain\n\nButch Stearns, sports anchorman; Chief Content Officer for the Pulse Network[40]\n\nSylvanus Thayer, superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy; called \"the father of West Point\"\n\nMo Vaughn, baseball player for the Boston Red Sox[41]\n\nDonnie Wahlberg, record producer, songwriter, singer, actor; founding member of the musical group New Kids on the Block[42]\n\nMark Wahlberg, film and television producer; Academy Award-nominated actor; former lead singer of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch[43]\n\nThomas A.
