Due to his father, John Adams, being a European diplomat, much of Quincy Adams’ childhood was spent in Europe. Upon returning to the States, he became an attorney like his father, and practiced law in Boston. Continuing to follow in his father’s footsteps, Adams became a European diplomat, serving as US Minister to the Netherlands from 1794-1797, Prussia from 1797-1801, Russia from 1809-1814, and Britain from 1815-1817. From 1817-1825, he served as James Monroe’s Secretary of State.\n\nOriginally a Federalist, Adams joined the Democratic-Republican Party from 1809-1828, and later became affiliated with the National Republican, Anti-Masonic, and Whig Parties. He served as President from 1825-1829, during which time he sought a series of federally-funded projects, known as Internal Improvements. After serving as Chief Executive, Adams represented Massachusetts in the US House of Representatives from 1831-1848. During his later years, he became increasingly critical of slavery, and helped repeal the Gag Rule, allowing for congressional discussions on abolition. He passed away on February 23, 1848.\".",
