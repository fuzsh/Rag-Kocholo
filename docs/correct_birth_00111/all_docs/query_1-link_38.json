        "text": "Braintree Business and Home Security\n\nOverview\n\nWelcome to American Alarms’ business and home security page for Braintree, Massachusetts. This informational page provides important crime data along with additional information for those living in or considering moving to Braintree.\n\nBraintree Business and Home Security Facts\n\nAccording to the FBI Crime Database for Massachusetts’ 279 cities and towns, Braintree was ranked 57th in “Most Property Damage per 100,000” in 2013 declining from 89th in 2012. However, it was 157th for “Most Burglaries per 100,000” improving from 132nd in 2012.\n\nAmerican Alarm’s History in Braintree\n\nBased in New England since 1971, we’ve worked in the Braintree area for decades. We know the landscape and we have good relationships with local police and fire officials. Our team of employees (200 strong and growing) live in the communities we serve, this means our customers are our neighbors.\n\nBraintree History\n\nFirst settled in 1634, Braintree was incorporated six years later in 1640. After its incorporation, the land was further split into the towns Holbrook, Randolph and Quincy.\n\nWhat Braintree is known for…\n\nAlthough Braintree doesn’t have the historical clout that many towns and cities do it makes up for it through numerous famous residents, past and present. Braintree is the birthplace of two presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, the second and sixth presidents respectively. They were the first father and son pair in the U.S. history, only followed by George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush. It was also the birth place of legendary General Sylvanus Thayer, who is known as “the Father of West Point.” In recent years it has become a suburban city, with proximity to Boston allowing it to be popular residential place for commuters.\n\nShort List of Historic Places or Recreation Spots\n\nAmong the historic locations in the town, are the home of Sylvanus Thayer and the Gilbert Bean Museum and Research Center. Sylvanus Thayer lived in his birth home until the age of eight where he would go on to have a prestigious career in the military. The home was converted to a museum and displays 19th century furniture. Another place frequented is the South Shore Plaza, an upscale shopping center that contains over 200 retailers. It is the fifteenth largest mall in the nation and the largest mall in New England.\n\nFamous People from Braintree\n\nMark and Donnie Wahlberg spent time during their youth living in Braintree. Mark has since gone on to become a famous actor playing large roles in movies like The Italian Job, Invincible, The Departed, The Other Guys, The Fighter and Ted. His brother Donnie enjoyed his most know for the success of his band New Kids on the Block and has also had success in the acting field. The Sixth Sense, Band of Brothers and Blue Bloods are some of his movie and television credits.\n\nJohn Adams was born in Braintree and most notably served as the first Vice President of the United States and second President. He is also the first President to live in the White House while serving.\n\nJim Calhoun is the former head coach for the UConn Huskies basketball team. Before he retired in 2012, he had coached the team for twenty-six years and had twenty-seven of his former players go on to play at the professional level. He was born and raised in Braintree where he played and excelled in football, basketball and baseball at Braintree High School.\n\nAmerican Alarm Knows Braintree, MA\n\nHome security lives at the intersection of technology, service and community. American Alarm provides comprehensive home security systems for people in Braintree because our technology and customer service are unsurpassed, but also because we know their community.\n\nBased in New England since 1971, we’ve worked in the Braintree area for decades. We know the landscape. We have good relationships with local police and fire officials. Our team of employees (200 strong and growing) live in the communities we serve, this means our customers are our neighbors.\n\nAmerican Alarm’s featured home security system in Braintree, MA\n\nBraintree Resident Reaches Out To American Alarm To Help With False Alarms\n\nA new customer of ours in Braintree wanted to protect their family and the major investment in their beautiful colonial home. The home had a security system previously installed by another company, but it was not working well.\n\nThe biggest problem facing home security systems today is chronic false alarms, and that’s what was happening here. The other company’s system was simply not sufficiently reliable and was prone to false alarms.\n\nAfter researching the market, and learning of American Alarm’s reputation for top technology and customer service, this customer asked us to take over and upgrade their home security system. We did so, and also installed a digital radio back-up communicator, so this customer’s security system can send an alarm to our 24-Hour Security Command Center under any conditions, even if the power or phone lines to the home are cut.\n\nThe issue of chronic false alarms has been resolved, and this customer is comforted by knowing that their home and family are always protected.\n\nBraintree Helpful Links\n\nhttp://www.braintreema.gov/\n\nhttp://www.braintreeschools.org/\n\nhttp://www.townofbraintreegov.org/fire/\n\nhttp://braintreepd.org/\n\nhttp://braintree.patch.com/"
