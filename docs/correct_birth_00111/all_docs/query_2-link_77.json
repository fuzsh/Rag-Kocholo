        "text": "ADAMS NHP provides \"an extraordinary window into the personal lives of two presidential families; early American literature, education and intellectual life; and the formation of our nation’s government.”\n\nIn 1920 Brooks Adams began arranging the furnishings and preserving the “Old House” as a historical memorial to his forefathers Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. The Adams Memorial Society operated the house as a museum from 1928-1946, when at that time, they gave to the people of the United States five acres of land and five historic buildings containing the original family furnishings."
