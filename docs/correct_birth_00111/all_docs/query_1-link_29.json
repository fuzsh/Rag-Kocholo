        "text": "Home Buying\n\n5 things to know about living in Braintree\n\nPresidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams were both born in Braintree — though shifting boundaries mean the birthplaces are now in Quincy.\n\nBraintree was incorporated in 1640 and used to include the current towns of Randolph, Holbrook, part of Milton, and the City of Quincy. Though the presidential birthplaces are no longer in Braintree proper, being home to two presidents (and John Hancock) is still a point of pride.\n\nBraintree is a suburban area 12 miles south of Boston and is the home of the large South Shore Plaza.\n\nCheck it out.\n\n1. You’ll live in…\n\n… in a historic house or a new construction that looks like one. Some of the homes listed for sale in Braintree are in fact historic and are in the Colonial style. But most of the listings use the terms “updated,” “redone,” “renovated,” “new construction,” or “contemporary.” Though the homes are up to modern standards inside, the new homes in Braintree look like they could have been built hundreds of years ago, keeping up the town’s historic charm.\n\n2. You’ll pay…\n\n… under half a million. The Zillow Home Value Index for Braintree puts the median home value at $400,600. Prices in the town have risen 7.3 percent over the past year and are expected to rise another 2 percent in the coming year.\n\nFor $350,000 to $450,000, you can get a single-family home around 1,500 square feet — maybe even one that has been nicely updated. The WalkScore in Braintree is 36, meaning you will probably need a car to get around. North Braintree, South Braintree, and East Braintree all get slightly higher scores.\n\n3. You’ll hang out…\n\n… at the South Shore Plaza. The large indoor mall has everything you’d need — it has a Lord & Taylor, Macy’s, Sears, Nordstrom, and Target, along with a variety of places to eat.\n\nWhen you are tired of shopping, the No. 1 rated Trip Advisor thing to do in town is to go to the the AMC Braintree, which has comfy, recliner seats and great food options.\n\nAnother top-rated place to spend an afternoon (if you are feeling adventurous) is F1 Boston, which is a “high performance kart racing venue for corporate events and social functions, featuring two indoor European-style kart tracks.”\n\nWhen it is time to get outside, you can go to Pond Meadow Park, which is a “a 320 acre conservation and passive recreation area spanning the Towns of Weymouth and Braintree.” The park has many different habitats and bodies of water. There are also walking and hiking trails, space for biking, birdwatching, and cross country skiing.\n\nIf you are hungry, you can go to one of the wide range of restaurants Braintree has to offer. The top-rated restaurant on Yelp is Sintra Restaurant, which is inspired by Mediterranean and American classic dishes and has food ranging from pasta to steak. The dessert options are also not lacking.\n\n4. Your kids will…\n\n… go to exceptional schools. On the 1-10 GreatSchools rating scale, two different public schools in Braintree get a 10 and another three get a 9. Braintree High School received a 7, still well above average.\n\nThe Thayer Public Library also has a variety of activities for kids and teens, such as story time. The library also provides museum passes for Braintree residents for a variety of local and Boston-area museums.\n\n5. You’ll love…"
