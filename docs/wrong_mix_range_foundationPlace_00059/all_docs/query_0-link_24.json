        "text": "I am excited to share that yesterday, I received my appointment letter to serve as an Adjunct Instructor - Mentor/Coach at Duke University Pratt School of Engineering! I am fortunate to be working with and learning from two friends, Dr. Ted Ryan and Allegra Jordan. I have been a fan of their work for some time and am grateful that I get to experience it firsthand. Thank you for the opportunity. I also look forward to engaging with the rest of the faculty, staff, and students as I join the Duke Team. This appointment will be in the Master of Engineering Management | Duke University Program\n\nI just finished MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)'s Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Business Strategy Program. This program provided a firm overview of emerging AI/ML trends. It also provides a great baseline understanding to enable a strategic approach to adopting these technologies in the very near future. Lastly, it reinforced my initial impression that AI/ML will directly impact, in a positive way, those profession that most traditionally felt were unautomateable.\n\nI am really looking forward to this and encourage all of those heading off to JETC this May to consider joining. The potential of this emerging technology to reshape both enduring and expeditionary engineering is exciting."
