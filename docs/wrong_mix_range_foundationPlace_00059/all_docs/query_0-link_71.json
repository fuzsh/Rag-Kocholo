        "text": "Biographical Information\n\nFormer research scientist Jane Borland taught biology, chemistry and environmental science at Lamar High School in Arlington, Texas. As participants in a nation-wide program on monarch butterflies, Miss Borland and her students raised monarchs, monitored migration patterns, created a butterfly garden and presented their findings at a national conference. While teaching biology she created a giant cell that students could crawl into and examine the intricacies of cytology. A district leader in curriculum development since her work on HIV/AIDS education in the early 1980s, Miss Borland wrote district curriculum guides and collaborated on standards-aligned inquiry-based training for K-12 science teachers. Miss Borland also taught a variety of science classes at John Paul II High School, a college prep Catholic high school in Plano where she retired in June of 2018. Among other honors, Miss Borland received a Point of Light award from President Bush for her nationally acclaimed \"Little Viking\" mentoring program for at-risk elementary students, she is a Tandy Scholar and she received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching from the National Science Foundation."
