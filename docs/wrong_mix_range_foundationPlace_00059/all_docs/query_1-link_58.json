        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. – The Veterans of Foreign Wars Foundation is pleased to announce Lisa Baronio has been selected as the new executive director of the 501(c)3 nonprofit headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Baronio will be responsible for attaining its philanthropic fundraising goals and objectives in support of the VFW.\n\nAs the former chief advancement officer of the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) and president of the UMKC Foundation, Baronio brings nearly 30 years of experience in fundraising and donor relations to the position.\n\n“We’re honored to welcome Lisa to the VFW team at a time when both the demand for philanthropic programs and corporate fiscal transparency is at its highest,” said VFW National Commander Tim Borland. “Lisa is a proven leader whose experience in cultivating advancement programs will help push the VFW Foundation forward, enabling the growth and expansion of our support to America’s veterans, service members and their families.”\n\nPrior to joining UMKC, Baronio served as president of the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) Foundation and vice president for University Advancement at UNI. While there, Baronio led the efforts that raised more than $85 million and distributed more than $20 million to support the university. She also led a scholarship initiative that exceeded the $40 million goal by $13 million and met the original goal 19 months ahead of schedule. At the University of North Texas, she led an effort that resulted in a $22 million gift to the institution, the largest gift to the university at the time.\n\nWhen asked what she most looks forward to in her new role she said, “I have been looking forward to working with the dynamic team of professionals at the VFW Foundation and the VFW, and to meeting and interacting with the donors to assist in raising financial support for our veterans and military families. It is a great honor to work with a talented team who clearly care about those they serve.\n\nShe assumed her new role on Aug. 22, 2022."
