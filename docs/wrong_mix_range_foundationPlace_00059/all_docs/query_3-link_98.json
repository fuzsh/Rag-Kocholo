G. Rejlander (British born Sweden, 1813-1875)\n\nNo title (The Virgin in prayer)\n\nc. 1858-1860\n\nAlbumen silver photograph\n\n20.2 × 15.4cm irreg.

Further comment in Part 2 of the posting…\n\nDr Marcus Bunyan\n\nMany thankx to the NGV for allowing me to publish the media images in the posting. Other photographs in the posting are public domain. All installation images are by Marcus Bunyan.\n\nPhotography: Real and Imagined examines two perspectives on photography; photography grounded in the real world, as a record, a document, a reflection of the world around us; and photography as the product of imagination, storytelling and illusion. On occasion, photography operates in both realms of the real and the imagined.\n\nHighlighting major photographic works from the NGV Collection, including recent acquisitions on display for the very first time, Photography: Real and Imagined examines the complex, engaging and sometimes contradictory nature, of all things photographic. The NGV’s largest survey of the photography collection, the exhibition includes more than 300 works by Australian and international photographers and artists working with photo-media from the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n\nText from the NGV website\n\nInstallation view of the entrance to the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne with introduction wall text to the right\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nIntroduction\n\nPhotography was once described by writer and critic Lucy Lippard as having ‘a toe in the chilly waters of verisimilitude’. Photographs, Lippard posits, may be a close – rather than exact – reflection of truth. This proposition raises a raft of questions. Is reality so uncomfortable that we only engage with it partially, or out of necessity? Can a photograph show the truth, and if it does, whose truth is it showing – the photographer’s, the subject’s or the viewer’s? If truth is the end game, what does this mean for creative practice and other types of photography? The suggestion that photography is only partially, and somewhat uncomfortably, engaged with the notion of truth highlights the complexity encountered when trying to nearly encapsulate any selection of photographs.\n\nThrough works from the NGV Collection, Photography: Real and Imagined teases out connections between iconic and lesser known photographs, putting them in a dialogue with one another that both explores and transcends the time in which they were made. It dos not set out to be a history of photography, but historical context does inform the content, leading to nuanced discussions of past and present, real and imagined.\n\nIntroductory wall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at right, Mike and Doug Starn’s Invictus (1992); and at left works by John Kauffmann, Norman Deck and Edward Steichen (see below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nThe sun was the light source that enabled the earliest photographs to be made in the 1830s. More than 150 years later the sun is the subject of this photographic sculpture by Mike and Doug Starn that embraces the possibilities of light and its potential effects on photography, in terms of both producing an image and as a force contributing to its irreparable damage. In the centre of their installation, the circular form of a sun seems to pulse and leach out of the layers of exposed orthographic film, which is stretched and layered across steel beams and held with pipe clamps and tape.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at top left, John Kauffmann’s The Cloud (c. 1905, below); at bottom left, Kauffmann’s The grey veil c. 1919; at top right, Norman Deck’s Sunset, Parramatta River (1909); and a bottom right, Edward Steichen’s Moonrise (1904)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nJohn Kauffmann (Australian, 1864-1942)\n\nThe cloud\n\nc. 1905\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n28.2 × 37.2cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nGift of Mr John Bilney, 1976\n\nPublic domain\n\nJohn Kauffmann (Australian, 1864-1942)\n\nThe grey veil\n\nc. 1919\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased through The Art Foundation of Victoria with the assistance of the Herald & Weekly Times Limited, Fellow, 1990\n\nPublic domain\n\nThe Yarra River, the Princes Bridge and the Melbourne city skyline beyond shimmer in this photograph by John Kauffmann. And yet, they are not the image’s subject. Using a highly refined Pictorialist treatment, a reduced tonal range and luminous mid tones, the artist has manipulated light to the extent that the feeling and atmospheric qualities become the focus of the image – it is the impression that is paramount. With the choice of title, too, the photograph moves away from a specific documentation of place or time.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nNorman Deck (Australian 1882-1980)\n\nSunset, Parramatta River\n\n1909\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n30.5 × 24.9cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nGift of Joyce Evans, 1993\n\nPublic domain\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at centre, David Thomas’ The Movement of Colour (White), Taking a Monochrome for a Walk (London) (2010-2011), with at right works by David Noonan, Hiroshi Sugimoto, László Moholy-Nagy and Susan Fereday (see below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nDavid Thomas (British, b. 1951, Australia 1958- )\n\nThe Movement of Colour (White), Taking a Monochrome for a Walk (London) (installation view)\n\n2010-2011\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nGift of an anonymous donor through the Australian Government’s Cultural Gifts Program 2015\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\n“It was made during a residency at the Centre for Drawing Research at Wimbledon School of Art University of the Arts London… and plays on Paul Klee’s definition of drawing as taking a line for a walk on a page… this is taking a monochrome for a walk in the world where the monochrome becomes a key for seeing other colours… an interval in the world.

To produce the images, the artist directs his camera at the movie screen. Once the film starts, Sugimoto opens the lens shutter of his large-format camera and shuts it the moment the movie ends. The result is a visual condensation of the moving images and projected light of the film for its duration into a vivid, hovering rectangle of virtually pulsating light and, in the case of this drive-in cinema, the surrounding human-made and astronomical light, too.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing David Noonan’s Untitled (1992)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nLászló Moholy-Nagy (Hungarian 1895-1946, Germany 1920-1934, England 1935-1937, United States 1937-1946)\n\nFotogram, 1925\n\n1925\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPresented by the National Gallery Society of Victoria, 1985\n\nPublic domain\n\nFrom 1922 to 1943 László Moholy-Nagy experimented extensively with the photogram process – he was passionate about the optical effects and inherent properties of these camera-less images freed from a purely representational mode.

Applying a standardised approach – similar to a generic passport photograph – these portraits have a timeless quality that invites you to attempt to ‘read’ their faces and to search for clues as to the inner state of the person. Ruff, however, lets nothing slip. The faces are known to the artist but remain anonymous to the viewer.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing Robert Rooney’s AM-PM: 2 Dec 1973-28 Feb 1974 (1973-1974) (detail)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nFeaturing some of the most iconic photographs ever created alongside contemporary approaches to the photographic medium, Photography: Real & Imagined is the largest survey of the NGV’s Photography collection in the institution’s history and features more than 270 photographs by Australian and international practitioners.\n\nFour years in the making, this landmark exhibition features photographs from across the 200-year period since the invention of photography in the 19th century, including work by leading international photographers including Man Ray, Cindy Sherman, Wolfgang Tillmans, Gilbert & George and Nan Goldin, alongside Australian photographers Max Dupain, Olive Cotton, Mervyn Bishop, Polly Borland, Destiny Deacon and Darren Sylvester.\n\nThrough twenty-one thematic sections, this large-scale exhibition explores the proposition that a photograph can be grounded in the real world, recording, documenting and reflecting the world around us; or be the product of imagination, storytelling and illusion; and on occasion operate in both realms. The thematic sections explore subject matter such as light, place and environment, consumption, conflict, community, and death.\n\nExhibition highlights include Mervyn Bishop’s important photograph of former Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, pouring sand into the open palm of Gurindji Elder Vincent Lingiari. The 1975 image captures the historic meeting between these two figures where Lingiari received the crown lease of his ancestral lands. Also on display is Joe Rosenthal’s World War II photograph Raising the flag on Iwo Jima, 1945, in which American marines raise their country’s flag over the Japanese Island. Both Bishop and Rosenthal’s photographs were staged, or re-constructed for better pictorial effect, illustrating the fluid space between the real and imagined.\n\nThe exhibition also presents fashion and advertising photography, including key examples by Lilian Bassman, Athol Smith, Horst P. Horst and Dora Maar. These images showcase a world of designer fashion and high-end products, which set a standard in advertising that continues today. Ilse Bing’s Surrealist inspired photograph commissioned by Elsa Schiaparelli to launch her new perfume Salut in 1934 is a highlight of the exhibition.\n\nHighlighting an area of focused collecting for the NGV, the exhibition recognises the work of women practicing in the early 20th century, including Barbara Morgan whose acclaimed photo montage City shell, 1938, shows an unexpected view of the then recently completed Empire State Building.\n\nThrough to the current day, Photography: Real & Imagined presents contemporary photographers of the 21st century including Zanele Muholi, Richard Mosse and Alex Prager. Highlights include Cindy Sherman’s celebrated self-portrait in the guise of Renaissance aristocrat. Also on display will be the oldest photographic work in the NGV Collection, an early 19th century portrait by Englishman William Henry Fox Talbot, one of the inventors of the medium, as well as examples of daguerreotypes, unique images on silver plated copper sheets that are amongst the earliest forms of photography.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a major publication – the most ambitious book published on the NGV Photography Collection, generously supported by the Bowness Family Foundation. The publication comprises essays from NGV Senior Curator of Photography, Susan van Wyk, Susan Bright and David Campany; alongside texts by Curator of Photography, Maggie Finch and external authors from Australia, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia.\n\nRegular introductory talks for students are held on weekdays during term times, and free drop-by guided tours each Thursday and Sunday at 10.30am during the exhibition period.\n\nTony Ellwood AM, Director, NGV, said: ‘This exhibition celebrates the collections and achievements of the NGV’s photography department, which has presented more than 180 exhibitions in its 55-year history. The exhibition is a testament to the strength of the NGV Collection, with so many key examples of the history of photography represented, from the earliest examples from the 19th century, through to contemporary images being produced right now in the twenty-first century. We are grateful for the support of the many donors and philanthropists, such as the Bowness Family Foundation, who have helped to grow and strengthen the NGV’s photography collection.’\n\nPress release from the NGV\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne at top left, O.

She stares out like a disapproving Renaissance figure who has just walked off set from a Peter Greenaway extravaganza. Here we have a photographer looking like a painting that walked out of a film. Sherman’s photographs speak of the fragilities of the visage in an image-saturated world where information and construction slip into foreplay. In Sherman’s photographic world gender and identity is a compilation album. There is a toughness to the excess that is all her own’.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing O.

He was particularly interested in Arthurian legends and drew upon these stories as inspiration for some of his most admired photographs. Elaine watching the shield of Lancelot is based on Alfred Tennyson’s version of the story of Lancelot and Elaine. Peach Robinson has recreated the scene in which the lovelorn Elaine gazes dreamily at the shield of Lancelot. She is shown as a woman who has shunned reason and propriety and abandoned herself to the intensity of her emotions, making this photograph both a tragic love story and a cautionary narrative.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nRuth Hollick (Australian, 1883-1977)\n\nThought\n\n1921\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n37.4 × 25.3cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPresented through The Art Foundation of Victoria by Mrs Lucy Crosbie Morrison, Member, 1993\n\nPublic domain\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing Bernd and Hilla Becher’s Coal tipple, Goodspring, Pennsylvania 1975 from the Artists and Photographs folio 1975\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nIn 1959, German-born artists Bernd and Hilla Becher began travelling throughout Europe to create photographic typologies of vanishing industrial architecture (a practice they continued for more than four decades). While predominantly documenting German structures and landscapes, they occasionally worked overseas. This image, four views of a coal tipple, was taken on their first trip to North America in the mid 1970s. The Bechers constructed a system for comparing structures: photographed from a consistent angle, with virtually identical lighting conditions, printed at the same size and often displayed in grids.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nEdward Ruscha (American, b. 1937)\n\nTwentysix Gasoline Stations (installation view)\n\n1963, published 1967\n\nArtist’s book: photo-offset lithograph and printed text, 48 pages, printed cover, glued binding\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nGift of Robert Rooney through the Australian Government’s Cultural Gifts Program, 2009\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nWith the first publication of Twentysix Gasoline Stations, and his subsequent artist books, Edward Ruscha’s work was influential in initiating the widespread interest in photographic book publishing that continues today. Ruscha’s use of photographs as a means of recording – a seemingly unemotional, detached cataloguing of the world – and simply as a ‘device to complete the idea’ influenced the interest in serial imaging adopted by many conceptual artists. Ruscha’s use of the book format was also crucial, providing a transportable way of presenting art in varied contexts that existed as a type of ‘map’ to be read and interpreted, with the subject matter becoming less important than the documentation as a whole.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nJohn Baldessari (American 1931-2020)\n\nFable: A Sentence of Thirteen Parts (with Twelve Alternate Verbs) Ending in a Fable (installation views)\n\n1977\n\nArtist’s book: photo-offset lithography on concertina fold-out in cross formation, folded paper cover\n\n9.8 × 14.0 × 1.8cm (closed) 70.0 × 126.5cm approx.

I thought, why not? … And then I also had a parallel interest in photography … I could never figure out why photography and art had separate histories. So I decided to explore both’. Taking art off the walls and requiring someone to unfold and activate it is a central idea of this artist’s book. A visual puzzle, it invites an interaction between looking and reading, creating your own fables as you jump from image to word to image again.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nEve Sonneman (American, b. 1946)\n\nReal time (installation view)\n\n1968-1974, published 1976\n\nArtist’s book: photo-offset lithograph and printed text, 46 folios, printed paper cover, glued binding\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased NGV Supporters of Photography, 2021\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nEve Sonneman’s photobook Real time includes paired photographs, each separated by a black line border. The diptychs allow for the occurrence of movement and gestures and changes between the artist’s camera clicks. The ordered presentation, however, takes the images away from a straight documentary reading and to a consideration of their ‘objectness’. After first showing the photographs at MoMA, New York, then photography curator, John Szarkowski, set up a mentorship for Sonneman with the photographer Diane Arbus. As Sonneman recalled: ‘[Arbus] loved my pictures and we got along great. For two years she helped me edit’. Sonneman then published the images through the newly established Printed Matter in New York in 1976.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at top left, Carol Jerrems and Virginia Fraser’s book A Book About Australian Women (published 1974); at top centre, Nan Goldin’s book The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (published 1986); and at bottom left, Tracey Emin’s Exploration of the Soul (published 1994)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at bottom left, Harold Cazneaux’s book The Bridge Book (published 1930); and at top right, Lee Friedlander’s book The American Monument (published 1976)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nLee Friedlander (American, b. 1934)\n\nThe American Monument (installation view)\n\nPublished by The Eakins Press Foundation, New York, 1976\n\nHalf-tone plate\n\nShaw Research Library, National Gallery of Victoria\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBerenice Abbott (American 1898-1991, worked in France 1921-1929)\n\nChanging New York (installation view)\n\nPublished by E.

Many photographs, however, were originally created for display in combination with text and graphic design; to be laid out on a page and reproduced in different formats; to be held, worn on the body, published, and shared.\n\nWith recognition of these expanded histories of photography, and the contemporary resurgence in publishing, this exhibition includes artist books, magazines and photobooks that use the photographic image in print, publishing and design. These two cases include examples that show the influence of Surrealism, the New Objectivity and Constructivist graphic design in dynamic modern publications.\n\nArtist and author Martin Parr has described the photobook as the ‘supreme platform’ for photographers to share the work with a broad audience. The 1920s to the 1970s were arguably the most important period for the publication of photobooks. These two cases include examples that show the influence of modernist, humanist and documentary photography traditions in innovative publications from this time. These include exhibition catalogues, examples of first edition books, publications published in larger un-editioned print runs and coveted collectable limited-edition books and portfolios.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing Man Ray’s book Photographs by Man Ray Paris 1920-1934 (published 1934) with at right, Man Ray’s Anatomies (1930, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nMan Ray (Emmanuel Radnitzky) (American, 1890-1976)\n\nAnatomies\n\n1930\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\nPlease note: this photograph is not in the exhibition\n\nClaude Cahun (French, 1894-1954) Marcel Moore (French, 1892-1972)\n\nAveux non Avenus (Disavowals or Cancelled Confessions) (installation view)\n\nPublished by Éditions du Carrefour, Paris, 1930\n\nIllustrated book: photogravure, letterpress text, 237 pages, 10 leaves of plates, paper cover, stitched binding\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nShaw Research Library, acquired through the Friends of the Gallery Library endowment, 2017\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nAveux non Avenus, by the celebrated poet, writer, sculptor and photographer Claude Cahun, was published in 1930 by Éditions du Carrefour, Paris, in an edition of five hundred. The book comprises a series of texts in French: poems, literary aphorisms, recollections of dream sequences and philosophical thoughts, ideas and meanderings. Pierre Mac Orlan, a French novelist who wrote the preface to the book, described Mademoiselle Claude Cahun’s text as ‘de poèmes-essais et d’essais-poèmes’, or ‘poem-essays and essay-poems’, and said that overall ‘the book is virtually entirely dedicated to the word adventure’\n\nThe alliterative title presents a conundrum for English translation – ‘aveux’ meaning ‘avowals’ or ‘confessions’, and ‘non avenus’ meaning ‘voided’ – and is variously translated as Disavowals, Denials, and Unavowed confessions, among other things. Curator Jennifer Mundy has written that the title suggests ‘an affirmative expression immediately followed by some form of negation or retraction’.\n\nAmbiguities around the title aside, there is a strong visual aspect to the book too. The texts are each demarcated with a complex and fantastical photogravure created by Cahun’s partner, Marcel Moore. These photogravure (where an image from the negative of a photograph is etched into a metal plate, similar to printmaking) are collages made up of photographic images of, and by, Cahun. Throughout the book, graphic devices of stars, eyes and lips are also used to separate sections of text. Aveux non Avenus, which has been described as an anti-realist or surrealist-autobiography of the multi-disciplinary Cahun, exists as a potential critique of the autobiography format altogether, is wonderfully irreducible.\n\nMaggie Finch and Isobel Crombie. “Claude Cahun,” in the 2019 July/August edition of NGV Magazine on the NGV website 9th April 2020 [Online] Cited 28/01/2024\n\nClaude Cahun (French, 1894-1954) and Marcel Moore (French, 1892-1972)\n\nUntitled\n\n1930\n\nIn Aveux non avenus 1930\n\npublished by Éditions du Carrefour, Paris\n\nillustrated book: heliographs\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nShaw Research Library, acquired through the Friends of the Gallery Library endowment, 2017\n\nGermaine Krull (German, 1897-1985)\n\nNude Studies (Études de Nu) (installation view)\n\nPublished by Librarie des arts décoratifs, Paris, 1930\n\n24 photogravures, letterpress on paper, white cloth-backed orange paper-covered board portfolio with ribbons\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria\n\nPurchased, NGV Foundation, 2022\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBill Brandt (English born Germany, 1904-1983)\n\nPerspective of Nudes (installation view)\n\nPublished Bodley Head, London, 1961\n\nHalf-tone plate\n\nShaw Research Library, National Gallery of Victoria\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nKarl Blossfeldt (German, 1865-1932)\n\nArt Forms in Nature: Examples from the Plant World Photographed Direct from Nature (installation view)\n\nPublished by A.

Each system presents a conversion – of letters, texts and illustration – into raised dots on a page; of visible wavelengths of light into an image on a light-sensitive surface. Each relies on an irreversible alteration of the surface. Seeing, the title of this Peter Peryer photograph, infers an action – seeing something. Yet the conversion into a photographic image draws attention to the impenetrability of both acts.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at left, Gregory Crewdson’s Untitled (1999) from the Twilight series (1998-2002); at centre, Malerie Marder’s Untitled (2001); and at right, Anne Zahalka’s Sunday, 2:09pm (1995)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nGregory Crewdson (American, b. 1962)\n\nUntitled (installation view)\n\n1999\n\nFrom the Twilight series 1998-2002\n\nType C photograph\n\n121.9 × 152.4cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nKaiser Bequest, 2000\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nAnne Zahalka (Australian, b. 1957)\n\nSunday, 2:09pm\n\n1995, printed 2019\n\nFrom the Open House series 1995\n\nColour cibachrome transparency, light box\n\n121.7 × 161.4cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, Victorian Foundation for Living Australian Artists, 2019\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at left, Polly Borland’s Untitled (2018); and at right, Anne Zahalka’s Sunday, 2:09pm (1995)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at rear from left to right, Gregory Crewdson’s Untitled (1999) from the Twilight series (1998-2002); at second left, Malerie Marder’s Untitled (2001); and centre, Anne Zahalka’s Sunday, 2:09pm (1995); and at right, Alex Prager’s Crowd #11 (Cedar and Broad Street) (2013, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing Alex Prager’s Crowd #11 (Cedar and Broad Street) (2013, below)\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nAlex Prager (American, b. 1979)\n\nCrowd #11 (Cedar and Broad Street)\n\n2013\n\nInkjet print\n\n149.7 × 142.0cm (image and sheet)\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nBowness Family Fund for Contemporary Photography, 2014\n\nAlex Prager’s staged photographs openly reference the aesthetics of mid-twentieth century American cinema, fashion photography and the photographs of Cindy Sherman. Her images resemble film stills and are packed with emotion and human melodrama. Working with actors, directing their placement and interaction to create a hyperreal dramatisation of crowd behaviour, Prager’s narrative tableaux pair the banal and fantastic, the everyday and the theatrical, real life and cinematic representation. In this image we have a bird’s eye view of a mass of people crossing the road.

VG Bild-Kunst/Copyright Agency, 2023\n\nLoretta Lux is known for her eerie, hyperreal photographs of children. The luminous pallor of the boy’s skin and the subtle tonal range throughout the photograph is achieved through Lux’s delicate use of digital manipulation to reduce the palette in her image. Lux’s history as a painter informs photographs such as this, which seem to owe as much of a debt to Old Master paintings as modern technology. Her skilful combination of photographic reality and painterly effect gives the image a profoundly disconcerting quality that is reminiscent of the fantastical (and disturbing) character of Oskar, the little drummer boy, in the Günter Grass novel The Tin Drum (1959).\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at bottom left, Raoul Ubac’s Penthésilée (c. 1938, below); at top centre, André Kertész’s Satiric Dancer, Paris (1926, below); and at right, Max Dupain’s Impassioned clay (1936, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nRaoul Ubac (Belgian, 1909-1985)\n\nPenthésilée\n\nc. 1938\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n31.0 × 41.5cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased NGV Foundation, 2013\n\nFrom the mid 1930s onwards Surrealist photographer Raoul Ubac experimented with collage, photomontage and solarisation. These processes disrupted the surface of his photographs, enabling him to create new and fantastic realities and introducing an element of chance into his image making. Penthésilée is from his most important series of photographs. The image is based on the story of Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons, who was killed by Achilles while fighting alongside the Trojans. To represent this mythic battle Ubac created this complex photomontage by cutting up, collaging, rephotographing and solarising photographs of nude female figures. The resulting image has an uncanny sense of movement suggesting the height of battle.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nAndré Kertész (Hungarian 1894-1985, France 1925-1936, United States 1936-1985)\n\nSatiric Dancer, Paris\n\n1926, printed c. 1972\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\nPurchased, 1973\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing Max Dupain’s Impassioned clay (1936, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nMax Dupain (Australian 1911-1992)\n\nImpassioned clay\n\n1936\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n50.4 × 36.7cm irreg.\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nWilliam Kimpton Bequest, 2016\n\nPublic domain\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at left, Pat Brassington’s Rosa (2014); and at right, Yvonne Todd’s Werta (2005)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nYvonne Todd selects her subjects, most often young women, from ‘call outs’ seeking certain types, people encountered on the street, or modelling agencies where she invariably chooses those with little or no industry experience. In her studio Todd uses costumes, heavy make-up and wigs to style her models. Costuming is an important aspect of Todd’s practice; her interest lies in in what she describes as, ‘the way they carry character and narrative connotations’. Todd’s finished photographs are heavily reworked using Photoshop so that they appear obviously artificial. This overt use of artifice shifts her images from simply being nostalgic recreations to being strangely familiar and undeniably creepy.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at back left, Robyn Stacey’s Nothing to see here (2019) and at back centre, Polly Borland’s Untitled (2018)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nRobyn Stacey (Australian, b. 1952)\n\nNothing to see here\n\n2019\n\nFrom the Nothing to See Here series 2019\n\nLenticular image\n\n155.5 × 119cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, Victorian Foundation for Living Australian Artists, 2020\n\nThis large-scale lenticular photograph shows the face of a woman projected onto a curtain.

The vast pastoral lease on the lands of the dispossessed Gurindji people would later become famous as a turning point in the recognition of land rights for Australia’s First Nations peoples, but when George visited, it was a place of entrenched, officially sanctioned discrimination. In George’s photograph, the Gurindji stockmen appear overshadowed by the stockyards in the foreground, perhaps reflecting the attitude of pastoralists who, having been granted leases, took advantage of people living on Country, exploiting them as an unpaid workforce.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nFred Kruger (German 1831-1888, Australia 1860-1888)\n\nGroup of Aborigines in hop gardens, Coranderrk\n\n1876\n\nAlbumen silver photograph\n\n13.3 × 20.2cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nGift of Mrs Beryl M.

One of the many subjects he photographed was the productive farmland and the activities of the community working the land. Kruger’s photograph shows a multigenerational group of people in the lush Arcadian setting of the hop garden, but what it obscures is the reality of exploitation and poverty that afflicted First Nations people in this place. Kruger’s photographs met a brief to promote the so-called ‘civilising’ work of colonial authorities but in doing so represented a largely imagined reality and created an effective form of propaganda.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nSelina Ou (Australian, b. 1977)\n\nConvenience (installation view)\n\n2001\n\nFrom the Serving You Better series 2001\n\nType C photograph\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased with funds arranged by Loti Smorgon for Contemporary Australian Photography, 2005\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing at top left, Kusakabe Kimbei’s Vegetable peddler (1880s, below); at bottom left, David Wadelton’s Richmond hairdresser (1979, below); at top centre, Rennie Ellis’ Between strips, Kings Cross (1970-1971, below); at bottom centre, Brassai’s Washing up in a brothel, Rue Quincampoix (La Toilette, rue Quincampoix (Bidet)) (1932, below); and at right, Wolfgang Sievers’ Shiftchange at Kelly and Lewis engineering works, Springvale, Melbourne (1949, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nKusakabe Kimbei (Japanese, 1841-1934)\n\nVegetable peddler\n\n1880s\n\nAlbumen silver photograph, colour dyes\n\n20.6 × 26.3cm (image and sheet)\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nGerstl Bequest, 2000\n\nPublic domain\n\nJapanese photographer Kusakabe Kimbei established his studio in 1881, making photographs for the domestic and tourist markets. Most of the photographs in this elaborate album are conventional, staged domestic scenes; picturesque views of popular tourist attractions; and street scenes. This image, however, stands alone in the album as an unusual view of contemporary life. Despite the women weavers wearing traditional dress and working hand-operated looms, the factory in which they are working is lit by electric lights and they are supervised by men wearing European-style dress. Unlike its companion works in Kimbei’s album, this photograph speaks to the industrialisation that was part of the Meiji-era modernisation in Japan.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nKusakabe Kimbei (Japanese, 1841-1934)\n\nKusakabe Kimbei (日下部 金兵衛; 1841-1934) was a Japanese photographer. He usually went by his given name, Kimbei, because his clientele, mostly non-Japanese-speaking foreign residents and visitors, found it easier to pronounce than his family name\n\nKusakabe Kimbei worked with Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried as a photographic colourist and assistant. In 1881, Kimbei opened his own workshop in Yokohama, in the Benten-dōri quarter. From 1889, the studio operated in the Honmachi quarter. By 1893, his was one of the leading Japanese studios supplying art to Western customers. Many of the photographs in the studio’s catalogue featured depictions of Japanese women, which were popular with tourists of the time. Kimbei preferred to portray female subjects in a traditional bijinga style, and hired geisha to pose for the photographs. Many of his albums are mounted in accordion fashion.\n\nAround 1885, Kimbei acquired the negatives of Felice Beato and of Stillfried, as well as those of Uchida Kuichi. Kusakabe also acquired some of Ueno Hikoma’s negatives of Nagasaki. Kimbei retired as a photographer in 1914.\n\nText from the Wikipedia website\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing David Wadelton’s Richmond hairdresser (1979, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nDavid Wadelton (Australian, b. 1955)\n\nRichmond hairdresser\n\n1979\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n13.4 × 20.2cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nGift of David Wadelton through the Australian Government’s Cultural Gifts Program, 2015\n\n© David Wadelton\n\nRennie Ellis (Australian, 1940-2003)\n\nBetween strips, Kings Cross\n\n1970-1971; 2000 {printed}\n\nfrom the Kings Cross series 1971\n\ngelatin silver photograph\n\n37.1 x 24.1 cm (image) 40.3 x 30.4 cm (sheet)\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, 2005\n\n© Rennie Ellis Photographic Archive\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing Brassaï’s Washing up in a brothel, Rue Quincampoix (La Toilette, rue Quincampoix (Bidet)) (1932, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBrassaï (Hungarian-French, 1899-1984)\n\nWashing up in a brothel, Rue Quincampoix\n\n(La Toilette, rue Quincampoix (Bidet))\n\n1932; printed c. 1979\n\nfrom The secret of Paris in the 30s series 1931–1935\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n20.5 × 29.2cm (image and sheet)\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, 1980\n\nPublic Domain\n\nIn the 1930s Brassaï became well-known for his photographs of the nightlife of Paris, but it was the sex workers, along with other characters of the city’s underbelly, who excited his imagination. Reflecting on this time, he wrote, ‘Rightly or wrongly, I felt at that time that this underground world represented Paris at its least cosmopolitan, at its most alive, its most authentic, that in these colourful faces of its underworld there had been preserved, from age to age, almost without alteration, the folklore of its remote past’.

Renowned for making photographs that combine empathy and clear-eyed observation, Lange also believed that photographs and text should be presented together to amplify the messages carried in both mediums. She understood that captions ‘fortified’ her photographs and that they should ‘not only (carry) factual information, but also add clues to attitudes, relationships and meanings’.

The composition, with its compressed space, apparent lack of horizon and striking diagonal lines, is suggestive of avant-garde painting of the time. Showing the densely packed lower decks of the of the transatlantic steamer Kaiser Wilhelm II, Stieglitz’s oblique reference to the return movement of unsuccessful immigrants to America offers an insight into the social outcomes and complexities of mass global migration in the early twentieth century.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nDavid Moore (Australia, 1927-2003)\n\nMigrants arriving in Sydney\n\n1966\n\nGelatin silver photograph\n\n26.7 × 40.4cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, 1991\n\n© Estate of David Moore\n\nDavid Moore was Australia’s pre-eminent photojournalist of the 1960s. His work was regularly seen in leading local and international magazines. Moore’s Migrants arriving in Sydney, was commissioned and published by National Geographic in 1966. This now iconic image shows the climactic moment when a ship carrying migrants to Australia docks at Sydney harbour. The tightly framed photograph reveals a range of emotions on the faces of a group of people about to disembark and begin a new life. “We must do more than record the sensational, the bizarre, and the tragic. The lens of the camera must probe, with absolute sincerity, deep into the lives of ordinary men and women and show how we work and play.” David Moore, 1953\n\nText from the National Gallery of Victoria website\n\nTHIS IS NOT CORRECT NGV!\n\nIn 2015, Judy Annear [Head of Photography at the Art Gallery of New South Wales] said of this famous photograph: “It’s great to consider that it’s not actually what it seems.” Years after the photo was published, it emerged that four of the passengers in it were not migrants but Sydneysiders returning home from holiday.\n\nCharles Nettleton (English 1825-1902, Australia 1854-1902)\n\nHobsons Bay railway pier\n\n1870s\n\nAlbumen silver photograph\n\n12.8 × 19.2cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, 1992\n\nPublic domain\n\nMaggie Diaz (American, 1925-2016, Australia 1961-2016)\n\nThe Canberra, Port Melbourne\n\n1961-1967, printed 2014\n\nPigment print\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, Victorian Foundation for Living Australian Artists, 2015\n\nAs a young woman, Maggie Diaz had been fascinated by the work of French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. Her photographs are a ‘slice of life’ offering similar insights into the everyday experiences of people wherever she encountered them. The ship she photographed at Melbourne’s Station Pier in the 1960s was The Canberra, the largest of the passenger ships sailing between Britain and Australia at that time. Often bringing British migrants on assisted passages, the ship also held personal significance for Diaz: as a migrant from the United States, she travelled one-way from the US to Australia on The Canberra’s maiden voyage in 1961.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Photography: Real & Imagined at The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, Melbourne showing four photographs from Michael Cook’s Civilised series (2012)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nMichael Cook (Australian / Bidjara, b. 1968)\n\nCivilised #11\n\n2012\n\nFrom the Civilised series 2012\n\nInkjet print\n\n100.0 x 87.5cm\n\ned. 3/8\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased NGV Foundation, 2013\n\n© Michael Cook and Michael Reid Sydney + Berlin\n\nBidjara artist Michael Cook poses a question in his Civilised series: ‘What makes a person civilised?’ In these photographs he represents the ways Europeans – English, French, Portuguese and Spanish colonists – responded to First Nations people when they arrived on these shores.

And in the end the central question “who are you” is unknowable, unanswerable in any definitive way… for it all depends on your ancestry, and from what point of view you are looking and in what context – and these conditions can change from minute to minute, day to day, and era to era. Identity is always partially fixed and fluid at one and the same time. It is always a construction, a work in progress, governed by social and cultural relations.\n\n“Identity is formed by social processes. Once crystallized, it is maintained, modified, or even reshaped by social relations. The social processes involved in both the formation and the maintenance of identity are determined by the social structure. Conversely, the identities produced by the interplay of the organism, individual consciousness and social structure react upon the given social structure, maintaining it, modifying it, or even reshaping it.”1\n\nIdentity construction is a self-referential system where identities are produced out of social systems. They (identities) then act upon those very systems to alter them, and then those systems re-act again forming anew, an ever changing identity. “The task of identity formation is to develop a stable, coherent picture of oneself that includes an integration of one’s past and present experiences and a sense of where one is headed in the future.”2 But that identity formation, while seeking to be stable, is both multiple and contestatory. It is through those contests that a future sense of self can challenge hegemonic power differentials. As Judith Butler observes,\n\n“Thus every insistence on identity must at some point lead to a taking stock of the constitutive exclusions that reconsolidate hegemonic power differentials, exclusions that each articulation was forced to make in order to proceed. This critical reflection will be important in order not to replicate at the level of identity politics the very exclusionary moves that initiated the turn to specific identities in the first place … It will be a matter of tracing the ways in which identification is implicated in what it excludes, and to follow the lines of that implication for the map of future community that it might yield.”3\n\nIn other words, learn from the mistakes of the past and don’t let them repeat themselves in future identities! Do not exclude others in order to reconsolidate the hegemonic status quo. But people always form identities based on the “norm” – how can you change that? As A. David Napier states, “We rely, sometimes almost exclusively it seems, upon the construction and reconstruction of an evolutionary(?) sequence of events that simultaneously excludes outsiders and provides some basis for justifying our social rules and actions. Thus, we minimize diversity by reflecting on who we are, by achieving, that is, a self-conscious state that is not only accepted but considered desirable…”4\n\nCritical reflection is thus so important in challenging who we are, both individually and collectively. In this sense, an exhibition like WHO ARE YOU is important in helping to reshape social relations, helping to challenge hegemonic power differentials, which in turn affects our personal identity construction by reflecting on who we are and changing our point of view, so that we become more informed, and more empathetic, towards different cultures and different people. So that we do not exclude other people and other points of view.\n\nBut all is not roses and light in this exhibition with regard to exclusion.\n\nWhilst a lot of people acknowledge and empathise with First Nations people we can have NO IDEA of the ongoing pain and hurt centuries of invasion, disenfranchisement, genocide, massacres, Stolen Generation, lack of health care, massive incarceration, suicide rates and shorter life expectancy, land loss, cultural loss that the violence of the white Anglo gaze has inflicted on the oldest living culture on Earth. While there are moves afoot (as there have been for years) for Aboriginal constitutional recognition through a Voice to Parliament, a permanent body representing First Nations people that would advise government on Indigenous policy; and a treaty that would help secure sovereignty and self-determination, enabling First Nations people make their own decisions and control their own lives, economy and land, free from the effects of changing governments – personally I believe until there is a complete acknowledgement of the pain invasion has caused Aboriginal people by the whole of Australia, nothing will ever change.\n\nHaving said that, contemporary Australia is now the most multicultural country it as ever been. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2021 Census, 27.6 per cent of the population were born overseas and the top 5 countries of birth (excluding Australia) were, in order, England, India, China, New Zealand and the Philippines.5 In Australia, 812,000 people identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander in the 2021 Census of Population and Housing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people represented 3.2% of the population.6\n\nIt is interesting to note that when looking through the art works in this exhibition – nearly all of which can be seen in this posting – how much of it is (historical) white art and how much of it is contemporary Aboriginal art, with a sop being made to art made by, or mentioning, other people including Chinese, Afghan, Muslim and Sudanese. Chinese people have been living in Australia for centuries, Afghan people similarly. Greek and Italian people arrived in droves in the 1950s-1960s, Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s, Sudanese, Indian and Sri Lankan people in the late 20th century. More (historical and contemporary) work from these people was needed in this exhibition because they inform the construction of modern Australian identities.\n\nObviously the inclusion of so much contemporary Aboriginal work is a deliberate curatorial decision, but its disproportionate representation in this exhibition makes it feel like a “catch all”. Why do the curators feel the need to include so much Indigenous work? Is that how they truly see Australian identity? Also, does the inclusion of this art mean it is the best contemporary art that is available in Australia at the moment, or does its inclusion simply exclude other voices from different nationalities and ethnic and religious backgrounds that are just as important in the construction of contemporary Australian identities? While there is no denying the historical significance of invasion there needs to be a balance in such representation, especially in an exhibition purporting to investigate “who are you” over a broad range of references. As it stands the inclusion of so much Indigenous work feels like an agenda, a set point of departure, perhaps even an apologia for white guilt. As the critic John McDonald noted recently, we are living “at a time when museums and commercial galleries have gone completely gaga for such [that is, Aboriginal] work.”\n\nPersonally, I would have liked to have seen a greater range of voices expressing themselves in this exhibition. It struck me that the inclusion of so much (historical) white art and so much contemporary Aboriginal art formed a rather limited framework in which to examine “who are you”. Rather, I would have liked a more balanced representation through art of the many voices that contribute to the formation of evolving Australian identities, which ultimately could lead to a greater insight into the construction of our own self-portrait. That is the truly important aspect of any navel gazing exercise.\n\nDr Marcus Bunyan\n\nWord count: 1,450\n\n1/ Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann.

Papapetrou proposes that this is a significant moment for many young men as they seek to separate themselves from their mothers, and assume the costumes and identities of masculine stereotypes, often hiding themselves in the process. Papapetrou photographed her children fro most of her career, and explored a range of stereotypes that surround childhood. These works examine the placement of children and adolescents in a society which is determined and defined by adults.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nKarla Dickens (Australian / Wiradjuri, b. 1967)\n\nMrs Woods and ‘Ere\n\n2013\n\nInkjet print on paper, ed. 3/10\n\nImage: 66.0 x 100.cm\n\nSheet: 76.5 x 110.0 cm\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Canberra\n\nPurchased 2019\n\n© Karla Dickens/Copyright Agency, 2022\n\nTjayanka Woods (c. 1935-2014) was a senior Pitjantjatjara artist, born near Kalaya Pirti (Emu Water) near Mimili and Wataru, South Australia.

Barak lived near Coranderrk Aboriginal Station, near Healesville, from 1863 until 1903, becoming an influential spokesman for the rights of his people and an informant on Wurundjeri cultural lore. The people of Coranderrk, however, were officially forbidden from observing traditional practices, so Barak began recording them in drawings, often using ochre and charcoals to depict ceremonies and aspects of Wurundjeri culture before colonisation. His artworks are significant expressions of cultural practice, and he is regarded as an important figure int he history of Indigenous Australian art.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nBeruk (William Barak) (1824-1903), an elder of the Wurundjeri clan of the Woi-worung, was the most famous Aboriginal person in Victoria in the 1890s. After attending the Reverend George Langhorne’s mission school, Barak joined the Native Police in 1844 and remained there until at least 1851. From 1863 until his death he lived at the government reserve at Coranderrk, at a site near the Yarra River in Victoria. The history of the reserve is one of official interference and mismanagement, and Barak played a significant part in representing the wishes of his community to the government. In the decade of the 1880s he made many paintings and artefacts, mostly of Aboriginal ceremonial subjects.\n\nBeruk (1824-1903), artist, activist, leader and educator, was a Wurundjeri man of the Woiwurrung people, one of the five Kulin Nations whose Country encompasses Narrm (Melbourne). It is said that Beruk was present at the signing of the so-called treaty with which John Batman reckoned he’d acquired 240,000 hectares of Wurundjeri land in 1835. In reality, the men with whom Batman negotiated, including one of Beruk’s uncles, had not transferred ownership, but merely given Batman permission to stay temporarily. Beruk was given the name William Barak (a European mispronunciation) in 1844 when he joined the Native Police. He was among the group of people from across Victoria who were the first to join the settlement at Coranderrk, near Healesville, established by the Aboriginal Protection Board in 1863 following several years of petitioning by community leaders. Beruk emerged as a leader at Coranderrk, which developed into a self-sufficient agricultural settlement. Following the passing of his cousin Simon Wonga in 1874, Beruk became Ngurungaeta (head man) of the Wurundjeri people. During the same period, when European pastoral interests started lobbying for Coranderrk to be broken up and sold off, Beruk led the campaign to prevent the settlement’s closure. It was gazetted as a ‘permanent reservation’ in 1881.\n\nBy this time, Beruk was recognised as a leader of his people and as a revered custodian of language and cultural knowledge. As the people at Coranderrk were officially forbidden from observing their traditional ceremonies, including corroborees, Beruk began recording his knowledge in drawings, utilising introduced methods and materials including paper, cardboard, and watercolour to preserve and communicate important stories and aspects of culture and spirituality. On the one hand, his drawings and the artefacts he made functioned as a commodity and were sold as souvenirs to increasing numbers of tourists. Museums in Europe began acquiring examples of his work in the late nineteenth century. On the other hand, and more significantly, Beruk’s drawings represent a profound assertion of pride in his heritage and identity, and the survival of a rich and complex culture in the face of concerted attempts to diminish it. As Wurundjeri elder and Beruk’s great-great niece Aunty Joy Wandin Murphy says: “We believe that what he wanted was for people to remember those ceremonies, so that if he painted them … then people would always know about the ceremonies on Coranderrk and of Wurundjeri people.”\n\nThis photograph of Beruk was taken by Johannes Heyer, a Presbyterian clergyman called to the parish of Yarra Glen and Healesville in 1900. The drawing that Beruk is shown working on in the photograph is now in the collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\nAnonymous text. “William Barak at work on the drawing ‘Ceremony’ at Coranderrk,” on the National Portrait Gallery website Nd [Online] Cited 18/06/2022\n\nDavid Moore (Australia 1927-2003)\n\nMigrants arriving in Sydney\n\n1966\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased, 1961\n\nWHO ARE YOU: Australian Portraiture is the first exhibition to comprehensively bring together the rich portrait holdings of both the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra. Revealing the artistic synergies and contrasts between the two institutions’ collections, this co-curated exhibition considers portraiture in Australia across time and media.\n\nThrough the examination of diverse and sometimes unconventional ways of representing likeness, WHO ARE YOU will question what actually constitutes portraiture – historically, today and into the future. Examples of some of the more abstract notions of portraits in the exhibition include John Nixon’s Self-portrait, (1990), and Boris Cipusev’s typographic portrait of Jeff from The Wiggles, titled Jeff the wiggle, 2009-2013. Polixeni Papapetrou’s Magma man, 2013, a photograph that merges sitter and landscape until the two are almost indecipherable, and Shirley Purdie’s multi-panelled evocation of biography and Country, Ngalim-Ngalimbooroo Ngagenybe, 2018, further challenge the conventions of the genre and touch upon the intimate connection between artist, sitter and land.

In the early 1930s he concentrated solely on drawing, particularly the rocky landscapes around Sydney, but by the late 1930s he began painting in an increasingly romantic manner. Rocks were a meaningful subject for Rees because they evoked permanency and represented the constitution of the earth. Rees humanises his subject matter by using the word ‘portrait’ in the title, which suggests the rocks have shifted from inorganic to animate objects.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition WHO ARE YOU: Australian Portraiture at NGV Australia, Federation Square, Melbourne showing at right, Marshall Claxton’s An emigrant’s thoughts of home (1859, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition WHO ARE YOU: Australian Portraiture at NGV Australia, Federation Square, Melbourne showing at right, Marshall Claxton’s An emigrant’s thoughts of home (1859, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nMarshall Claxton (English, 1813-1881, worked in Australia 1850-1854)\n\nAn emigrant’s thoughts of home\n\n1859\n\nOil on cardboard\n\n60.7 × 47.0cm\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPresented by the National Gallery Women’s Association, 1974\n\nImmigration underlies the European history of Australia.

The wistful tilt of this young woman’s head and her thoughtful expression are powerful symbols of the intense nostalgia and fear of the unknown experienced by those in search of a new homeland.

Working for the first time on a discarded scrap of composition board, artists at Papunya rendered visible and permanent ephemeral designs, formerly made only for use in closed and secret ceremonial contexts on bodies, objects or the ground. The painted designs are closely connected to the artist’s cultural identity, his understanding of Country, and of sacred men’s business, unknowable to uninitiated members of the community.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nMaree Clarke (Australian / Mutti Mutti/Wamba Wamba/Yorta Yorta/Boonwurrung, b. 1961)\n\nWalert – gum barerarerungar: Tipperary, Ireland Dunstable, Britain Yorta Yorta Trawlwoolway Boonwurrung, Muttu Mutti, Wamba Wamba (installation view)\n\n2020-2021\n\nPossum pelts\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchase, Victorian Foundation for Living Australian Artists, 2021\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nMaree Clarke is recognised as one of the most respected possum skin cloak makers and teachers in the world. This work represents the first time Clarke produced a cloak to represent her own ancestral identity. Depicted on the cloak are seven important places, which her ancestors come from: Yorta Yorta Country, Trawlwoolway Country, Boonwurrung Country, Muttu Mutti Country and Wamba Wamba Country, as well as Tiperrary in Ideland, and Dunstable in Britain. Clarke has used a rare green ochre to represent her European ancestors. Together, these seven ancestral sites of significance inform Clarke’s identity.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nMaree Clarke (Australian / Mutti Mutti/Wamba Wamba/Yorta Yorta/Boonwurrung, b. 1961)\n\nWalert – gum barerarerungar: Tipperary, Ireland Dunstable, Britain Yorta Yorta Trawlwoolway Boonwurrung, Muttu Mutti, Wamba Wamba (installation view detail)\n\n2020-2021\n\nPossum pelts\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchase, Victorian Foundation for Living Australian Artists, 2021\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nPortraiture\n\nIn its uniting of artist and sitter, the self-portrait is an intriguing facet of portraiture. The self-reflection is a format that appears to grant the viewer the assurance of revelation and intimate access to the artist’s psyche. However, what the artist intends to communicate to their audience through portraiture is highly varied, and the message each artist conveys is as individual as the artist themselves. Additionally, there is room for the viewer to question how the artist has chosen to depict their image.\n\nSelf-portraiture is a diverse genre: there are myriad ways an artist can present themselves. A typical way for the artist to portray themselves is in the role of ‘the artist’, including in the work a visual clue to their profession – for instance holding a brush or paint palette – or showing themselves at work in the studio. As part of an investigation of self, these representations can also communicate the complexities of status and gender. This selection of works explores what the artists intend to reveal or exclude about themselves through their self-representations, considering he environment in which the artists are placed, and the props and imagery they choose to include in the works.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nPamela See (Australian, b. 1979)\n\nMaking Chinese Shadows (sixteen silhouette portraits) (installation view)\n\n2018\n\nTwelve of sixteen papercut silhouette drawings\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Canberra\n\nPurchased 2019\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBrisbane-born Pamela See (Xue Mei-Ling) studied at the Queensland College of Art from 1997 to 1999. She began papercutting during a period when she was without access to a studio, and was subsequently awarded grants that enabled her to study the technique in several centres throughout China. Her method and style resemble Foshan papercutting, which is widely practices in the home of her maternal grandparents, in Guangdong province. These papercuts are from a series investigating the lives of Chinese-Australians who flourished prior to the introduction of the White Australia policy. The works connect and juxtapose European silhouette portraiture and Chinese papercutting traditions, exploring the notion that a silhouette profile provides a means of ‘measuring’ a sitter’s character with the totemic and floral symbols evoking personal narratives, identity and professions.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nPamela See (Australian, b. 1979)\n\nMaking Chinese Shadows (sixteen silhouette portraits) (installation view detail)\n\n2018\n\nTwelve of sixteen papercut silhouette drawings\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Canberra\n\nPurchased 2019\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nVarious unknown photographers (Australian)\n\nWilliam and Martha Mary Robertson and their children (installation views)\n\n1860s-1870s\n\nEight cartes de visite, hand-coloured, contained in red leather presentation case\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Canberra\n\nGift of Malcolm Robertson in memory of William Thomas Robertson 2018\n\nDonated through the Australian Government’s Cultural Gifts Program\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nLIU Xiao Xian (Australian born China, b. 1963)\n\nMy other lives, #7\n\n2000\n\nFrom the My other lives series 2000\n\nType C photograph\n\n102.0 × 145.2cm irreg.\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\n\nPurchased with funds arranged by Loti Smorgon for Contemporary Australian Photography, 2002\n\n© LIU Xiao Xian\n\nPopular in nineteenth-century Australia, stereographs gave the illusion of three dimensions when placed in a handheld viewer. In this work, Liu Xiao Xian enlarges a typical example of this historical form of photographic portraiture and replaces the sitter’s face with his own on one side. Through this double-take, and the playful invitation to imagine an ‘other life’ for this sitter, this work is both a subtle self-portrait and a pointed reminder of the invisibility of the Chinese migrant experience in mainstream conceptions of Australian history and identity.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nA.

D. Colquhoun’s occupation or the studio setting. The young, glamorous model is an essential part of this carefully orchestrated self-portrayal. By also including his painting of the model on the easel, Colquhoun presents himself in the company of not one, but two women whose presence asserts his own dominant masculinity. The artist’s gaze meets the viewer, placing them as the subject of the painter’s attention, creating a complex network of visual relationships between the artist, model and viewer.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition WHO ARE YOU: Australian Portraiture at NGV Australia, Federation Square, Melbourne showing at right, Shirley Purdie’s Ngalim-Ngalimbooroo Ngagenybe (2018, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nShirley Purdie (Australian / Gija, b. 1947)\n\nNgalim-Ngalimbooroo Ngagenybe (installation view)\n\n2018\n\nNatural ochre and pigments on canvas (36 parts)\n\nEach: 45 x 45cm\n\nOverall: 225 x 525cm\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Canberra\n\nPurchased 2019\n\n© Shirley Purdie/Copyright Agency, 2022\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nShirley Purdie (b. 1947) is a senior Gija artist at the Warmun Art Centre who has been painting for more than twenty years. Purdie has lived on her Country, Western Australia’s East Kimberley, all her life. Inspired by senior Warmun artists, including her late mother, Madigan Thomas, she began to paint sites and narratives associated with her Country in the early 1990s. A prominent leader in the Warmun community, her cultural knowledge and artistic skill allow her to pass on Gija stories and language to the younger generations.\n\nIn 2018, Purdie was selected to contribute to the National Portrait Gallery’s 20th anniversary exhibition, So Fine: Contemporary Women Artists Make Australian History. Composed of 36 paintings, Purdie’s self-portrait Ngalim-Ngalimbooroo Ngaginbe is an eloquent and stunning visualisation of personal history, identity and connection to Country. ‘It’s good to learn from old people. They keep saying when you paint you can remember that Country, just like to take a photo … When the old people die, young people can read the stories from the paintings. They can learn from the paintings and maybe they want to start painting too.’ Using richly textured ochres collected on her Country, Purdie’s work is a kaleidoscope of traditional Gija stories and Ngarranggarni passed down to her.\n\nText from the National Portrait Gallery website\n\nShirley Purdie is senior Gija woman and a prominent leader within the Warmup Community in Western Australia’s East Kimberley. Combining her cultural knowledge with her art, Purdie creates visual depictions of Gija life and culture. Ngalim-Ngalimbooroo Ngagenybe, meaning ‘from my women’, is informed by Aboriginal ways of seeing, knowing and understanding oneself within the world. Each of the thirty-six panels shares a story about personal history, identity and Country to produce a non-representational self-portrait of the artist and her ongoing connection to women’s stories. By drawing on the significant women in her life, their relationships and histories, Purdie describes herself through these cultural connections and stories.\n\nWall text from the exhibition\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition WHO ARE YOU: Australian Portraiture at NGV Australia, Federation Square, Melbourne showing Sam Jink’s Divide (Self portrait) (2011, below)\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nSam Jinks (Australian, b. 1973)\n\nDivide (Self portrait) (installation views)\n\n2011\n\nSilicone, resin, horse hair\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Canberra\n\nPurchased 2015\n\n© Sam Jinks\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nSam Jinks developed a talent for drawing and constructi"
