        "text": "Steve Shadle's consistent work and contributions through the decades have reached almost all areas of the college. Shadle has been involved with Arizona Western College since before its first classes were held, through his firm's work with Senator Harold Giss to promote the formation of the college in early 1963. In the late 1960s, Shadle was an adjunct professor teaching night classes in business law.\n\nOver the years, Shadle has worked with many of his legal clients to establish funds for major college projects, including the Margaret Page Amphitheater and the Ennis Rice Endowment. As a couple, Shadle and his wife Bobbi established the Shadle/ Edgecombe Endowment Fund to recognize an outstanding faculty member every year with a cash award. As a member of the Caballeros de Yuma, Shadle worked to establish the original El Toro Bowl here in Yuma, to provide postseason football for worthy competitors and to promote the city. While serving on the AWC District Governing Board in 2009, Shadle shared his vision for a solar installation at the college, and worked closely with staff during the development of a 5 megawatt installation on campus.\n\nShadle has also served on the AWC Foundation Board of Directors and offers his legal services free for anyone who wishes to leave a bequest to the AWC Foundation, increasing the bequests by millions of dollars. Shadle has also been a longtime supporter of both KAWC Public Radio and the Matador Athletic Association.\n\nBenjamin Jose \"Bengie\" Molina was a Matador before he was an Angel, a Blue Jay, a Giant, or a Ranger. After graduating from high school with honors in Puerto Rico, Molina played shortstop and pitched for Arizona Western College in 1991 and 1992. As a catcher in the Major Leagues, Molina won two World Series rings (Anaheim Angels in 2002, San Francisco Giants in 2010). He also was awarded a Golden Glove as the top defensive player at his position in both 2002 and 2003. Molina's stunning baseball career also includes the rare feat of hitting for the cycle in one game - on July 16, 2010 Molina hit (in order) a single, a double, a grand slam home run, and a triple. He is the first catcher in Major League history to hit for the cycle with a grand slam.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Molina has been recognized as a team \"spark plug\" and inspiration. While playing for the San Francisco Giants, Molina was twice named the Willie Mac Award winner, for spirit and leadership, on a vote from fans. After retiring from the majors, Molina went on to coach with the St. Louis Cardinals and the Texas Rangers, and made a third trip to the World Series with St. Louis. Molina is also a published author, having written the New York Times bestselling book \"Molina: The Story of the Father Who Raised an Unlikely Dynasty.\" Both of Molina's brothers, Yadier and Jose, are decorated Major League catchers, with two World Series rings each. Molina credits early coaching and life lessons from his father, Benjamin, and support from his mother, Gladys Matta, in his native Puerto Rico, for raising three World Series champions.\n\nAWC Professor Emeritus Dr. George Montopoli has spent his career working to make the world around him better. Montopoli spent 19 years on the faculty of AWC, and 13 years as adjunct professor with NAU-Yuma. He taught a wide range of subjects to thousands of students, including statistics, calculus, ecology, environmental science, medical topics, and outdoor activities. Besides his teaching load, he directed the AWC Honors program from 1999-2002, and also drew on his statistical expertise to evaluate some 36 grants in 30 years. His work in a wide variety of fields has been widely published over the past 30 years.\n\nBeyond higher education, Dr. Montopoli has championed protected lands, wildlife preservation, and health and human service education in the U.S. and abroad. Montopoli has served as a climbing/rescue ranger since 1977 in Grand Teton National Park, averaging about 40 rescues per summer. He contributed to the development of high-altitude technical rescue techniques in a wilderness, mountain environment and, in 2005, he received the Department of Interior Valor Award; for participating in an extremely complex mountain rescue involving a party of 13 climbers hit by lightning at 13,200' on the Grand Teton.\n\nDuring 4 years with the Peace Corps in Chile and Ecuador, he trained locals in Advanced First Aid, provided medical care to about 20 people per day, and assisted in 80 childbirths with his wife, Delia. Additional projects included the construction of a hospital, water system, elementary school, and basketball/soccer court in the remote community where he volunteered.\n\nAs a leading researcher on bald eagles in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the better part of 30 years, his effort significantly contributed to the species' recovery, including the banning of lead in Grand Teton National Park. Montopoli is also a Master Falconer, and a principal avian rehabilitator of birds of prey in the SW region of Arizona.\n\nDr. Donald Schoening's almost 13-year tenure as the 6th president of Arizona Western College yielded a 50 percent increase in enrollment. He served from 1997 to 2009. Under his leadership, a $74 million bond was passed by voters that allowed for construction of new buildings on the Yuma campus as well as the establishment of campus sites in San Luis, Quartzsite, Parker and Wellton.\n\nUnder Schoening's leadership, he implemented many new practices at the district to increase productivity and build a positive culture. He also brought long-range planning to the district and annually published a 5-year vision for the district. Schoening oversaw the development of a facilities master plan that was shared with the campus community and the community at large. A 100-member citizen group helped pass the historic two-county $74 million bond in 2004 that allowed the college to open three more campuses and doubled the original campus academic buildings. The buildings themselves received several national architectural awards.\n\nDr. Schoening developed new fiscal management practices through priority-based budgeting and new funding sources for the college through federal grants. The large solar installation on the Yuma campus came about through Dr. Schoening's leadership. Dr. Schoening is credited with enhancement of the AWC Foundation, and community adoption of a life-long learning model. Schoening oversaw the college during adoption of innovations like interactive television, online learning, and live televised coverage of classes, events and sports to the district. The modern approach to marketing, recruitment and assessment began under Schoening's leadership, and those key investments continue to pay dividends for the college district.\n\nPublished during his presidency, Schoening's book \"Running a Juice Stand The 6 E's of Wise Management\" highlights successful business management practices he used while at AWC.\n\nBefore assuming the presidency at AWC, Schoening was President of Independence Community College (Kansas). He also served 25 years at Wenatchee Valley College (Washington), in roles ranging from Personnel Officer, Director of Athletics, Vice President of Administrative Services and Vice President of Student Services.\n\nThere are several reasons why Gonzalo Huerta, Sr. is honored in the AWC Hall of Fame. He is a product of the college, a former student who went on to make significant contributions to his community and his field of study. He is also a highly-respected colleague who over 30 years helped build the AWC Welding program, mentoring and nurturing students.\n\nWhen interviewed for the college's 50th Anniversary in 2015, Professor Huerta said \"AWC Is a family. My son, who is now a local welding teacher, literally grew up at that AWC welding lab.\"\n\nHe also said, \"Except for my oldest sister, who graduated from high school in Texas, all five of my siblings went to AWC. AWC is responsible for all five of us having good careers and excellent opportunities. We've been able to raise our families comfortably. Having a community college locally was very important. Culturally, being Hispanic, it’s hard to leave family. Having AWC right here was very fortunate for us.\"\n\nThe son of migrant workers, education was an established priority for his parents. They moved for seasonal work but never at the expense of their kids completing their schooling, or starting the school year on time. Gonzalo graduated from Yuma High in 1967 and enrolled immediately at AWC, completing a dual major of Welding Technology and Manufacturing Technology in 2 years. He started teaching at the college and then enrolled at Arizona State University and completed a degree of Industrial Technology at NAU, all while continuing his teaching career at AWC. He also completed a master's degree in Community College Administration from NAU, and became the Division Chair of Industrial Technology and Agricultural Science.\n\nMr. Huerta was known as a strict but tireless advocate for his students, and frequently planned family trips around welding competitions, so his students could experience an out-of-town event. He challenged his students and brought out the best in them. After retiring from AWC, he became the Dean of Instruction for Applied Sciences at Imperial Valley College where he continued to touch the lives of hundreds of students, and he has contributed countless hours as a volunteer judge at welding competitions.\n\n\"My legacy is my students.\"\n\nAs a student of migrant workers with limited education, Mario was focused on the opportunities college could provide him. With a start at AWC, Mario charted a course for himself that made him into a local and international business leader with deep roots and a philanthropic spirit that has impacted countless lives in Arizona and Sonora.\n\nMario says living and studying at Arizona Western College was \"exactly\" what he needed to springboard him into classes at ASU as a junior. He came to AWC from KOFA High School and was very determined to rise to the academic level of a college environment. He took Micro and Macro Economics, American History, and Marriage and Dating.\n\nHe chose to live on campus because he loved the independence of being on his own but not too far away from his family in San Luis, Arizona. He worked at the Student Union Game Room attended college athletic events, movie night, and pick up basketball games.\n\nWhile he has his hands in many local non-profit organizations, Mario wears his AWC alumni status like a badge of honor, promoting the college across the community. He has served on the Yuma Regional Medical Center Board, the Greater Yuma Economic Development board, as well as organizations including Yuma Community Foundation, Greater Yuma Port Authority, San Luis Economic Development Corporation, Rotary Club of San Luis and the San Luis, Sonora, Mexico Industry Chamber of Commerce (CANACINTRA).\n\nWhen Mario sees a need, he tries to meet it. He committed to 10 years of scholarships for San Luis High School seniors; he has donated water filtration systems to elementary schools in San Luis, Mexico; and for over two decades he has financially supported the exportation of donated building supplies for families in need in San Luis, Mexico. The greater Arizona - Sonora region has benefited tenfold from Mario's career journey that began on the campus of Arizona Western College.\n\nDr. Kenneth Borland was the fourth President of Arizona Western College. Borland presided over the College from 1977 until 1984. He joined the College during a time of significant transition and was not only successful in uniting the college community but of strengthening ties across the communities served by AWC. During his time at AWC, Borland was known for building collaboration throughout the educational community, increasing access points to the college, and building postsecondary educational infrastructure. He also served a term as Chairman of the Arizona Community College Presidents' Council. Borland called his time at Arizona Western College \"a privileged experience.\" After retiring from the College, he accepted a position in the Crane School District counseling junior high school children.\n\nBorland shared his spirit of service generously throughout the community, including his commitment to the Yuma Affordable and Fair Housing Commission and the Yuma County Historical Society. Borland was also active on the boards of the Yuma Regional Medical Center and its Foundation, Yuma Fine Arts, and the Greater Yuma United Way. Borland also spent time as a Hospice of Yuma volunteer visiting the homes of terminally ill patients and their families. Ken Borland spent twenty-six productive years volunteering with the Caballeros de Yuma to produce events to promote Yuma and improve the quality of life. In 2004 the Holiday Pageant and Friendship Tower Lighting ceremony was renamed in honor of Ken and his wife Betty to recognize their many contributions to the community. Dr. Borland is an inaugural member of the Arizona Western College Hall of Fame.\n\nC. Candy Camarena's determination and consistent efforts to achieve success have firmly established his reputation as an accomplished attorney and benefactor. Camarena has been instrumental in the development and sponsorship of the La Cosecha Banquet at Arizona Western College. At the La Cosecha Banquet, graduates from all walks of life are recognized for their perseverance in attaining an Associate's degree, many times in the face of obstacles. Students are encouraged to transfer to a university to continue their studies toward bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degrees and to return to this community as professionals. Over the years, Camarena has planted the seed to raise funds for over 250 scholarships and has made it possible for over 1700 graduates and their families to be recognized at the La Cosecha Harvest Dinner event. Camarena's other philanthropic efforts include Gethsemani Food Ministries, Crossroads Rescue Mission, Amberly's Place, and Young Life. Because of his own journey, overcoming obstacles to achieve his dream, Camarena resembles many AWC graduates. He earned his GED certificate and enrolled at AWC, majoring in Criminal Justice Administration.\n\nHe transferred to Arizona State University to major in Economics and Business, and was later admitted to the ASU Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law. He recently celebrated his 25th year of practicing both civil and criminal law. Camarena says, \"I learned early to work hard to sustain myself, but also to accept help when I needed it, and to help whenever someone else needed it.\"\n\nLynne Pancrazi has changed the face of education in Yuma and Arizona for the better. She's a product of Yuma public schools, and she attended Arizona Western College from 1972-1973, studying Criminal Justice, before transferring to Point Loma Nazarene College, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Physical Education. Pancrazi believes her time at AWC had great impact in preparing her for her own higher educational goals, and her future work in education. She later earned a Master's in Elementary Education from Northern Arizona University.\n\nFor 28 years, Pancrazi served as teacher, instructor and athletic coach in the Yuma Elementary School District Number One. She retired and then returned to help fill the teacher shortage. Pancrazi is the former president of the Yuma Elementary Education Association.\n\nBeyond influencing generations of schoolchildren, Pancrazi has also influenced legislation and policy at the state level and beyond through her work as an elected member of the Arizona House of Representatives (2007-2013) and the Arizona Senate (2013-2017), where she worked on issues related to education, natural resources, public safety, and budget. Pancrazi is known for her dedication to a safe and secure border, managed growth, adequate infrastructure, and rural community issues. In the fall of 2016, Pancrazi was elected to serve District 5 on the Yuma County Board of Supervisors.\n\nServing as Arizona Western College's athletic director, Charlie Dine took over the head coaching duties for the Matador softball program out of necessity in 1982 and led the program for 11 seasons. During that time, he led Arizona Western to the NJCAA Softball Championship Tournament three times. His teams won national championships in 1983 and 1987 and also finished as the national runner-up in 1986. He earned national coach of year honors in 1983 and 1987 as well.\n\nDine finished his career at AWC with 248 wins and 99 losses, which at the time ranked in the top 10 in NJCAA history for most career wins. He also coached eight first-team All-Americans. During his 27 years at AWC, the doors to his office and home were always open to students and student athletes of AWC and youth of Yuma County.\n\nSoftball was not the only tie to the NJCAA for Dine. In 1970, he served as Ray Butcher's defensive coordinator at Arizona Western and helped the football program win two conference championships and the NJCAA national title in 1972. He would later serve as Arizona Western's head football coach from 1975-78 and 1996-97. In addition to his duties at Arizona Western, Dine was an active leader for softball in the Arizona Community College Athletic Conference. He was instrumental in starting a preseason invitational softball tournament called the Great Western Shoot-Out, which today is still considered one of the top events in NJCAA softball. Dine also went on to work in the community and helped build the Yuma Catholic High School football and softball programs. While at Yuma Catholic, he led the Shamrocks to a pair of state softball tournament appearances.\n\nDine was elected to the NJCAA Softball Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Arizona Community College Athletic Conference Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2014, the Arizona Western College softball field was renamed after him. Throughout his career, Dine was recognized on a national level for his work in coaching softball techniques and theory.\n\nArnold Trujillo became an Arizona Western College student in August of 1971, receiving an associate's degree and going on to earning a bachelor's in Liberal Studies from Northern Arizona University. Born in the small mining town of Miami, Arizona, Trujillo was raised with a strong work ethic and high regard for education. When he was 19, AWC Coach Ray Butcher, Jim Carruthers, and Paul Waddell gave him an opportunity to move to Yuma and help manage the football team, and that opportunity helped shape his life.\n\nTrujillo also spent time as the Student Head Resident of the De Anza Hall.\n\nBefore he could complete, in July of 1973 Trujillo joined the U.S. Army and served 2 tours of duty in South Korea during the Vietnam Era. Upon his return to Yuma in 1976, he started his career at AWC as the Veteran Services Coordinator.\n\nMr. Trujillo spent over 37 years advising students through their college careers, helping them achieve success while at AWC and into their professional careers. Trujillo served in many capacities, including Student Head Resident at De Anza Hall, Veteran Services Coordinator Financial Aid Assistant Director, and Coordinator of Student Services in South County. His career was marked with numerous accolades, including the President's Award in 2005. During this time, he also proudly served 25 years in the Arizona Army National Guard where he retired as a Master Sergeant. He was awarded the U.S. Army Arizona Meritorious Service Award.\n\nArnold Trujillo loved his role as an encourager of students. He impacted many lives by just sharing his time and attention. He regularly advised students that education as a fundamental asset is something no one can take away. Mr. Trujillo lived and breathed AWC, and his positive impact on thousands of students is difficult to calculate.\n\nMrs. Charlene Fernandez is a remarkable example of an AWC graduate who has created a life rich in public service to uplift and improve the lives of her neighbors. Charlene has been a public servant for virtually her entire career, serving the communities of Yuma County and the state of Arizona.

After retiring from AWC, Dr. Carruthers served four two-year terms in the Arizona House of Representatives, bringing perspective as a strong advocate for education across the state.

This paved the way for University of Arizona and Arizona State University to formalize their transfer partnerships and led to all three schools holding in-person classes in Yuma County, hosting entire degree programs here, and co-hosting a shared commencement ceremony which is the only one of its kind across the state. As an emblem of his work to build these partnerships and his endless pursuit of excellence in education. the NAU Research and Education building on the Yuma campus was named for Dr. Carruthers in 2009.\n\nCarruthers' relationship with the college began in 1969 when he was hired as the Financial Aid Director.

This partnership evolved into \"K-20 Educational Consortium\" through which students were afforded the option to complete all of their education, from kindergarten to doctoral work here in Yuma. This \"educational park\" located on 24th street in Yuma saw the development of multiple elementary schools, a middle school and a high school. As an outcome of his driving force behind the creation of this unique plan, several neighborhoods and businesses have arisen over the years and now surround the once-isolated AWC Yuma campus. This consortium concept brought national acclaim to AWC and was replicated around the country.\n\nDuring his time at the state legislature, Dr. Carruthers was instrumental in securing two different five million dollar allocations for construction of two NAU facilities on the AWC Yuma campus. He also established six new education centers across the 10,000 square mile community college district, championed a district-wide interactive telecommunications distance learning program, and was a key strategist in a $20 million bond issue for campus infrastructure.\n\nIn his nomination letter, a long-time colleague noted, Dr. Carruthers' leadership style was guided by two key concepts: one is that \"The institution is the people that work there,\" so building strong relationships that foster an atmosphere of warmth, effectiveness, kindness, and success was critical. The second was the concept that all employees should be driven by the \"excitement of learning,\" which served as inspiration behind all of his decisions about how the college should serve students, staff, and the community. Colleagues remembered him as a \"genius with people\" and able to create a \"sense of community\" beyond just a place of work.\n\nNorman Bruce Jacobson has lived a life of service to the communities of Yuma and La Paz Counties through his visionary development, his leadership, and his service.

Tom had the privilege to help build the district from scratch, including the first staff and governing board.\n\nTom is married to his high school sweetheart, Mara, and together they have two children, both educators, Tiffany and Ryan, and nine grandchildren.\n\nCoach John Stratton came to Arizona Western College in the Fall of 1984, after serving as a graduate assistant for the University of Arizona baseball program and for four years as a teacher and coach in Yuma public schools. His impact was immediate, landing 27 wins in his first year and taking the team to an Arizona Community College Athletic Conference (ACCAC) Championship in his second.\n\nThe Matadors racked up 817 wins over Stratton’s 27-year tenure, with 20 winning seasons, 11 trips to the Region semi-finals, and three ACCAC championships. After Stratton’s 1993 and 1995 squads were just one win away from making the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) College World Series, his 1996 squad made a deep run, finishing third in the nation with the AWC and Yuma communities rooting them on all the way.\n\nStratton retired in 2011 as the longest tenured and winningest coach in any sport in AWC history. During that time, he coached multiple players who later played in the Major Leagues - including fellow AWC Hall of Fame inductee Benjie Molina - with countless others inspired to go on to be coaches themselves. Stratton says, “As a coach, I believed that there were other priorities in addition to wins and losses regarding players - stressing their academics, placing them at four-year school baseball programs, and nurturing their growth as young men who represented the college and AWC Baseball well.” Over the span of nearly three decades, Stratton created opportunities for and impacted the lives of hundreds of student-athletes.\n\nIn 2020, Stratton was inducted into the ACCAC Hall of Fame. Coaching distinctions throughout his career included NJCAA Western District Coach of the Year, ABCA Quarter Century Leadership Award, two Louisville Slugger Coaching Awards and multiple ACCAC Coach of the Year awards.

He has also served as a high school umpire, softball coach at Gila Ridge High School, Yuma Parks & Recreation Commissioner, and three-sport coach for Yuma Special Olympics.\n\nFinally, one of Stratton’s greatest joys as a coach was having his entire family along for the ride. His two children, Lisa and Alex, grew up on the field - spending afternoons doing homework in the dugout, serving as the batboy and batgirl during games, and building bonds with players year after year. They, along with wife Diane, were Stratton and AWC baseball’s biggest and most loyal fans over his 27 years at the helm."
