        "text": "John Buckner, 88, of Hewitt, passed peacefully and went to be with the Lord on November 17,\n\n2023. Visitation will be held at 10:00 AM, with a Celebration of Life held at 11:00 AM,\n\nWednesday November 22nd at Waco Memorial Funeral Home. Burial will follow at Waco\n\nMemorial Park.\n\nJohn was born June 26, 1935 in Frost, Texas to Thomas Robert and Lily Mae Buckner. John\n\nlived his early years in the McLennan, Hill and Limestone Counties. He joined the National\n\nGuard as a young man and spent 8 years in service before being Honorably Discharged. He\n\nworked in the Waco area as a small engine repairman, sewing machine repairman and retired\n\nfrom Crestview Church of Christ after 20 years as the church maintenance man and custodian,\n\notherwise known to close friends and his family as “The Minister of Sanitation.”\n\nIn February 1965, while driving a friend to work he noticed a young lady waiting on the corner\n\nfor the bus. He wondered out loud who that young lady was and his passenger responded, “Oh,\n\nthat’s just my sister.” Soon he would be driving both of them to work. On December 31, 1965,\n\nJohn married Joyce Treadaway in Waco, Texas at Crestview Church of Christ. They have been\n\nmembers of Lake Shore Drive Church of Christ for 20 plus years. He often referred to Joyce as\n\n“His Bride.” Their marriage and relationship was a shining example of a Christian marriage.\n\nJohn and Joyce had two daughters, Julie and Jill and that completed the 4-J.\n\nJohn enjoyed bowling and the archery club as a young man. In his retirement he loved baking\n\nand cooking. He would often get calls from Julie or Jill with questions about a recipe. He also\n\nloved woodworking and repairing things for family and friends. He often joked of his self taught\n\nskills as being a “Jack of ALL Trades, but master of none.” John was able to design and build\n\nfurniture for his family. One of the many special pieces he designed and built was a gliding\n\nbassinet that all four grandsons were able to enjoy as infants.\n\nJohn was preceded in death by his parents, Thomas and Lily Buckner, his brothers, Louden,\n\nWilliam, Mount and V.T. Buckner and his sisters, Julie Buckner, Johnnie Cottongame, Frances\n\nBuckner, Mary Buckner, Ida Thorne, Lena Jimison, Othella York and twin sister Lucy Smith.\n\nHe is survived by his Bride, Joyce Buckner, daughter Julie Eubank and husband Randy, Jill\n\nBorland and husband Chris, his grandsons known to them and others as “Papa John”, Elijah\n\nand Jonah Eubank and Zeke and Zane Borland along with many nieces and nephews and\n\nfriends who were chosen family.\n\nThe family would like to extend their heartfelt thanks to Ascension Providence Hospital 4th floor,\n\nICU and Community Healthcare of Texas - Providence Hospice Place for their compassionate\n\ncare.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in John’s name to Community\n\nHealthcare of Texas - Providence Hospice Place or The Pauline Crumpler Education\n\nFoundation, c/o Lakeshore Drive Church of Christ, 2800 Lake Shore Dr., Waco, TX 76708."
