        "text": "Very efficient. Gave us help with things they did not have to in order for this to be smooth and easy for us! Would absolutely use them or recommend them!\n\nGreat people, Great service, I wish someone had told me about InterLinc sooner. They work with you step by step through the whole process. If something isn't right you will get a call. Have questions? They will be there to answer them.\n\nThere are many mortgage companies to work with, but hands down the InterLinc team should be your choice! Friendly and supportive!\n\nThe ability to review and sign digitally, even on phone, was a great time saver!\n\nInterLinc made our purchase of a new home not only an easy process but painless as well. The entire staff was there to support us each step of the way.\n\nThe entire team is incredible and make all the process so simple. Thank you so much for your help.\n\nApproval went so smoothly with this company. I would recommend them highly. Great people to work with!! 5 stars definitely!!\n\nThe service was outstanding. They were patient. Encouraging, and very knowledgeable. We can't thank them enough for helping make our dream of owning a home come true.\n\nGreat to work with! Made it easy for us and answered all our questions along the way. Wonderful experience. THANK YOU!\n\nGreat with keeping you updated and always explained everything so that it was easy to understand. Always called back and kept me informed about any new details from start to finish.\n\nMy preferred lender to send my customers and clients to. They always go above and beyond and do what it takes to get it closed, often times ahead of schedule too!! Excellent follow up and they treat my customers like a person and not a number. Highly recommend!!\n\nThese guys are great! Got the job done when others faltered. THANK YOU!!!\n\nVery professional staff. We knew what was expected and required of us from the very first meeting. There were no surprises during this entire process. Everyone we worked with was professional, knowledgeable and extremely helpful!\n\nGreat service! Great team! Great communication! I am a first time buyer and I had no idea what I was getting myself into and this team made this process taste like cake!\n\nThe whole process was smooth, even though my wife and I had never been through buying a house before. The team was easy to work with and made sure we knew what the next step was to get us through to the end.\n\nThis team was amazing! Not only did they get us the rate that we wanted, but closed us in 20 days!! Thank you so much!!\n\nThe team at InterLinc is amazing! After relocating back to Texas we thought it would take several months to obtain a mortgage. We found a house we loved, applied for our loan and were closed, funded and moved in exactly 4 weeks after applying. The staff is honest, professional and hardworking. I am so grateful for their awesome work and highly recommend them for anyone looking for a mortgage loan.\n\nThe Best!!! Stress free!! Always kept in contact and provided me with the best service. Never doubted my ability to become a homeowner. Made sure I understood all the background information and broke down everything I needed to know about my mortgage. Best experience.\n\nI was in a tight spot, and trying to close on my very first house in just 28 days. InterLinc did a great job talking me through the process, letting me know what they needed, keeping me informed of the status and any revisions needed, and processing everything to meet the deadline. They are fast, courteous, and I highly recommend them!\n\nInterLinc Mortgage went above and beyond from the first time I submitted my information online. They called me back the day I submitted......on a Sunday! Wow! The home buying process was smooth and I was called AND emailed every step of the way. I can't say enough good things about ALL of the people at InterLinc!\n\nInterLinc Mortgage Services, LLC was great to work with. From our initial contact until the day of closing they were very professional, kept us updated on every step of our mortgage loan process, and made our new home purchase a smooth process. I would recommend InterLinc to anyone looking for a mortgage company. Courteous, Caring, Professional.\n\nFirst off let me say thank you for manner that you and your team of \"PROFESSIONALS\" handled this transaction. I have been in the Real Estate industry in Montgomery, AL for almost 30yrs. I have worked with several Real Estate companies, as well as owned my own firm. Over the years I have had every experience imaginable with lenders. Needless to say this is the first time that I have ever felt compelled to write to commend a company for the services rendered. The manner in which you \"managed\" this transaction, as well as the Client from start to finish was superb!\n\nAs I said you guys are a team of \"PROFESSIONALS\"... Which I believe is a word or title in today's society that is taken to lightly. Many may profess to be… but you guys OWN IT!!\n\nHow did you do? A+\n\nThere are many mortgage companies to work with, but hands down the InterLinc team should be your choice! Friendly and supportive!\n\nGreat people, Great service, I wish someone had told me about InterLinc sooner. They work with you step by step through the whole process. If something isn't right you will get a call. Have questions? They will be there to answer them.\n\nInterLinc made our purchase of a new home not only an easy process but painless as well. The entire staff was there to support us each step of the way. I think the thing I liked best was that even though they do this day after day they understood that this is not something the rest of us do very often. I even had one of the staff member ensure me that she had my back. What a nice feeling."
