        "text": "Skell Tech's success is due to the revolutionary quality of the AI that powers the drones it produced. To achieve this success, Jace Skell spared no expense in his efforts to pursue and recruit the very best talents the field had to offer. This was one of the missions of the Skell Foundation. Skell has built this campus on an already paradisaical place: a beautiful lake in a caldera lost on a jungle island. This haven is reserved for the best talents recruited by Skell Foundation; their mission is to create the next generation of AI designed to give life to the drones of World 2.0.\n\nThe university building is a friendly place dedicated to fundamental research and experimental work in the field of AI. Its interior houses a mix of laboratories, offices, meeting rooms and a huge lobby, showcasing several of Skell Technology's mass production drone models.\n\nThe labs are a mix of R&D rooms packed with computers and servers, and behavioral testing rooms used to test experimental AI with the help of small drones. Because next-gen AI R&D is a critical asset for Sentinel Corp., the firm has stationed many of its soldiers to secure and defend the campus.\n\nDescription[]\n\nThe campus is built on the ancient collapsed volcano now called Lake Kathryn. The campus consists of a circular design with multiple buildings, one of which is called the Archemedes Hall and the main university building called Pythagora's Hall. A helipad is located to the north-west of the site with a Gyps. Wall Mountain Bivouac is located overlooking the lake to the north.\n\nRelated Missions[]\n\nBlake's Law\n\nPower Failure\n\nGuardian Angel\n\nGallery[]\n\nAppearances[]"
