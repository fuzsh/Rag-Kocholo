        "text": "“Gary Borland is an incredible appointment to the South Atlantic Council,” said SCBFA CEO Gettys Brannon. “He has devoted his life and career to this industry and will serve the fishing community well. This nomination would not have been possible without the continued support of Gov. Henry McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette. From the start, these two have gone above and beyond in supporting our efforts to further enhance and expand such a vital industry for our state’s economy.”\n\n“We are at a crossroads in the South Atlantic where decisions made by the Council will affect greatly the future of recreational fishing in federal waters,” said Jeff Angers, president of the Center for Sportfishing Policy. “We are thrilled by the appointment of Gary Borland to represent South Carolina’s saltwater anglers on the South Atlantic Council. Gary’s background in recreational fishing will bring tremendous value to discussions on issues such as recreational data collection, alternative management opportunities and public access to fisheries like red snapper.”\n\nOther key RFMC appointments are Richard Bellavance of Rhode Island to the New England Council; Scott Lenox of Maryland and Ken Neill of Virginia to the Mid-Atlantic Council; Michael McDermott of Mississippi, Troy Williamson of Texas, and Thomas Frazer of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico Council; Peter Hassemer of Idaho and Marc Gorelnik of California to the Pacific Council, and Nicole Kimball of Alaska to the North Pacific Council."
