        "text": "Lonna Borland, 74, of Akron, passed away on November 24, 2022 after a very brief battle with cancer. She was surrounded by her loved ones before she passed, and was held by one of her daughters at the time she passed.\n\nLonna was born on June 22, 1948 in Akron to Albert and Mary McAvoy. Graduated from Central High in 1967. Following graduation she met the love of her life, William \"Bill\" Borland, and they wed the same year. They went on to have four children, Shelly, Tammy, Tracy, and William Jr. (Charlie).\n\nLonna excelled at motherhood and was the foundation of our family, through and through and became an amazing grandmother and great-grandmother. Even with so many grandchildren and great grandchildren, she never missed a chance to line them all up for a tight hug and a big kiss. Lonna had a way of walking into a room and making everyone feel loved and safe.\n\nAlong with her parents, Lonna was preceded in death by her husband, William \"Bill\" Borland; and sisters, Sharon Palfy, and Terry.\n\nShe is survived by daughters, Shelly (Larry) Tobias, Tammy (John) Westfall, and Tracy Borland; her son, William \"Charlie\" Borland; brother, Timothy (Lyn) McAvoy; sisters, Melody Vowell and Cynthia Evans; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nLonna was the family's best cook and baker, her children and grandchildren always requested her foods and desserts for birthdays or Christmas gifts. Lonna was an avid football and baseball fan, so when she wasn't gifting her family with their favorite treats, you could find her cheering on the Cleveland Indians and Pittsburgh Steelers from her living room, never missing a game.\n\nLonna was so gentle, loving, and loyal. She had so much compassion for people and animals and loved her dogs and cats like they were her own children. The family can rest assured knowing Lonna is with Jesus, whom she loved and gave her life to.\n\n\"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.\"\n\nRomans 6:23\n\n\"Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.\"\n\nJohn 16:22\n\nA private family gathering will take place at the family home on November 30, 2022.\n\n(Authored by Family)"
