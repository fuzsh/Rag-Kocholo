        "text": "Over the years, weâ€™ve seen the life-changing effects that a digestive disease or colon cancer diagnosis can have on a person and their family. The Borland Groover Foundation was founded in 2008 as a result of the overwhelming need for education and research to fight these illnesses and prevent them.\n\nAs the largest Gastroenterology practice in the southeastern United States, Borland Groover is home to some of the best gastroenterologists and equipment when it comes to treating gastrointestinal disease. Inspired by the actions of a group of our doctors and nurses, we founded the Borland Groover Foundation as the official organization to spearhead our mission to provide care to those who cannot afford proper digestive care.\n\nLearn more about the Borland Groover Foundation.\n\nOUR MISSION STATEMENT\n\nTo build a healthy and equitable community that is free from colon cancer through service, education, and empowerment.\n\nMarch to Get Screened\n\nMarch to Get Screened (MTGS) is an annual 5K and 1-mile fun run held in March to raise awareness of colorectal cancer prevalence and prevention and is a major funding event for the Borland Groover Foundation. All net proceeds from the event are used towards educating people of the importance of getting screened in a timely manner. It also provides colon cancer screenings free of charge for the un- and under-insured and funds a financial assistance program to help pay for medical bills related to colorectal cancer treatment. Colon cancer is the second cause of death in the U.S. but is highly preventable with routine colonoscopy screenings. Join us in the march to end colorectal cancer and make a positive, direct impact on the lives of those impacted by the disease.\n\nLearn more about March To Get Screened, register or donate."
