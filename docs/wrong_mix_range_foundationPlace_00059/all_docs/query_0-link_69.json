        "text": "Macon, Ga. – The Central Georgia Technical College (CGTC) Foundation invites the public to “go all in” at its 2020 edition of Pomp and Circumstance: A Casino Night Fundraiser sponsored by Parrish Construction. The classic evening of casino games will take place Friday, January 31, 2020 from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. at the Charles H. Jones Advanced Technology Center.\n\nThe stakes are the same every year: grow Foundation funding for CGTC’s students. However, the event’s organizer and CGTC Foundation advancement coordinator, Mary Kathryn Borland, looks forward to 2020’s edition of the fundraiser as a springboard into a decade of generosity.\n\n“The Foundation ended the final year of the decade awarding over $101,000 in scholarships for FY19,” she said. “The generosity of our donors is incredible and we are confident that current and potential donors will see value in supporting our College’s mission in the decade ahead. We are so thankful for their continued partnership as they assist us in meeting the financial needs of our students.”\n\nDonations from over 40 private scholarship funds are distributed by the foundation annually. During FY19, close to 500 students were provided with assistance thanks to the Foundation’s donors.\n\nIn addition to tuition and textbook assistance, the Foundation raised over $2.1 million in donations, grants, in-kind gifts and pledges to support the strategic initiatives of CGTC.\n\nPomp and Circumstance will feature Blackjack, Texas Hold’em, Roulette, and Craps. Individual tickets for the event are $50 and $85 per couple. Proceeds from the event benefit the CGTC Foundation for projects including student scholarship and textbook assistance programs.\n\nJoin the Foundation and the College for Pomp and Circumstance by purchasing a ticket at www.centralgatech.com/foundation/events or call, 478-757-3503.\n\nThe Charles H. Jones Advanced Technology Center is located on CGTC’s Macon campus at 3300 Macon Tech Drive."
