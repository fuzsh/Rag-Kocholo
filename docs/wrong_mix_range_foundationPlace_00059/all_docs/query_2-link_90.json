        "text": "August 2022\n\nDanielle\n\nBorland\n\n,\n\nRN, BSN\n\nICU\n\nSt. Joseph's Hospital South\n\nRiverview\n\n,\n\nFL\n\nUnited States\n\nIf it wasn’t for Danielle's quick thinking and attention to detail my spouse might not have made it.\n\nDanielle showed the deepest compassion to my spouse. She went above and beyond the call of duty by being responsible for his daily needs and oxygen levels. The main reason for this nomination is she that she saved my spouse’s life by discovering his medication had been discontinued by the doctor somewhat early. She picked up on the signs his body was showing by not having this medication, notified the hospitalist, and got the medicine restarted. If it wasn’t for her quick thinking and attention to detail my spouse might not have made it. She is an exceptional and amazing nurse. I thank God for her every day."
