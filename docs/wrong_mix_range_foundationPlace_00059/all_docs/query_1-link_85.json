        "text": "MONTGOMERY, N.Y. (May 2, 2023) – The Community Foundation of Orange and Sullivan (CFOS) recently welcomed the Dick Polich Internship Fund to its family of funds.\n\nThe fund was established by UAP | Urban Art Projects (formerly Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry) in memory of Polich, who made an enormous contribution to art, design, and architecture over the past 50 years through his art foundries: Tallix, Polich Art Works and Polich Tallix. The fund will support a paid internship at UAP’s Hudson Valley art-making facility each year.\n\nDuring the eight-to-twelve-week internship, the selected intern will gain hands-on experience working on various public art projects and foundry practices. In addition, the Dick Polich intern will experience and be a part of real-world interactions between artists, designers and makers related to the production of art and metal casting.\n\nOrange County New York individuals age 18 to 25 interested in making metalwork and art are eligible to apply for the Dick Polich internship. No formal qualifications are needed. Preference will be given to applicants from underserved communities in the Greater Newburgh area. The internship will be a paid position at a rate based on fair wages. Applications for a fall 2023 internship scholarship will be accepted until end of June through the CFOS online scholarship application portal at cfosny.org.\n\n“The foundries under Dick Polich’s leadership employed traditional techniques and new technologies to realize the creative visions of artists from around the world.” said Daniel Tobin, UAP Co-founder and Creative Director. “It is a fitting tribute to his legacy that this scholarship will enable future young people to begin their careers in these fields.”\n\n“The Community Foundation is honoured to manage this new fund which will provide valuable training and mentorship for our youth destined to be the region’s next generation of outstanding art makers,” said Elizabeth Rowley, CFOS President and CEO.\n\nTo learn more about the Dick Polich Youth Internship Fund or donate, please visit https://cfosny.org/our-funds/field-of-interest/dick-polich-youth-internship-fund/.\n\nAbout Dick Polich\n\nPolich made an enormous contribution to art, design, and architecture over the past 50 years through his art foundries: Tallix, Polich Art Works and Polich Tallix. Under his leadership, the foundries employed ancient techniques and cutting-edge technology to realize the creative visions of artists from around the world. Polich’s foundries became extensions of the artists’ studios, and the foundry’s team of skilled craftspeople have cast and fabricated thousands of exceptional sculptures, monuments, and design objects.\n\nAbout UAP | Urban Art Projects\n\nUAP believes that incredible things don't just happen; they're created, nurtured, believed in. Arts, culture, and creativity have always played a vital role in bringing people together. UAP continues this tradition with an enduring belief that creativity can inspire incredible possibilities.\n\nEstablished in 1993 by brothers Matt and Dan Tobin, their modest Brisbane practice has evolved into a global art and design studio and workshop. In August 2019, UAP acquired the 50-year old foundry, Polich Tallix located in upstate New York, making UAP one of the most significant art foundries in the world.\n\nAbout the Community Foundation of Orange and Sullivan\n\nBased in Montgomery, NY, the Community Foundation of Orange and Sullivan connects people who care with causes that matter.
