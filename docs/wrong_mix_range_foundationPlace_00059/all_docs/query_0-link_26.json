        "text": "Sophey Carbajal was born and raised in Long Beach, CA. She got involved with the LA84 Foundation through the YMCA Youth Institute of Greater Long Beach. She’s been a part of the program for 3 years now and she feels lucky to have been given a grant that gives inner city youth the opportunity to be exposed to so many different types of sports that they wouldn’t have been able to do given their socioeconomic status.\n\nSophey plays volleyball, basketball, track, cross country, yoga (if that counts) and has started to get into a few new sports recently due to the grant. She plans to go straight into college and major in business marketing and advertising. Sophey would like to continue what she’s learned with the Youth Institute and school by going into the advertising and marketing industry.\n\nSomething else that Sophey is extremely passionate about is equal-opportunities for all. And with this grant, she is able to explore some things that are classified as “upper-class activities.” This is a start to even the playing field and she like to thank the LA84 Foundation for choosing the Youth Institute and giving her and her peers these incredible opportunities.\n\nJanet Evans is widely considered to be the greatest female distance swimmer in history. Despite her small size and unorthodox windmill stroke, she was a natural-born swimmer, completing laps by the age of two. In 1987, when she was 15 years old, Janet burst onto the international swimming scene, breaking world records in the 400m, 800m and the 1500m freestyle.\n\nA year later at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Janet won gold medals in all three of her races: the 400 meter freestyle, 800 meter freestyle, and 400 meter individual medley. In 1992 in Barcelona, Janet defended her gold in the 800 freestyle and added a silver medal in the 400 freestyle. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Janet swam in both the 400 meter and 800 meter freestyle but failed to medal. The highlight of those Games came at the Opening Ceremonies, where she passed the Olympic Flame to Muhammad Ali. Through that once in a lifetime opportunity, she saw another side of the Olympic experience which changed her forever. She retired from competitive swimming at the end of the Atlanta Games.\n\nDuring her career, Janet broke a total of seven world records in three events (400 meter, 800 meter, and 1500 meter freestyle). Her 1500 meter world record stood for 20 years, her 800 world record stood for 21 years, and her 400 world record stood for 19 years, making them some of the longest standing records on the swimming books. Janet was inducted into the US Olympic Hall of Fame in 2004 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2001. In 1989, she was awarded the prestigious Sullivan Award as the United States’ top amateur athlete.\n\nIn 2010, Janet mounted a comeback in the sport with the goal of competing at the Olympic Trials in 2012 in the 400 meter and 800 meter freestyle. She successfully qualified for the Trials, and, at the age 40, had the recent honor of trying out for the Olympic Team in both events in July of 2012.\n\nMore recently, in September of 2015, Janet was selected to be the primary athlete voice of the Los Angeles 2024 Olympic Bid. As the Vice Chair of the Bid Committee and Head of the Athletes’ Commission, she worked closely with Paralympians and Olympians to ensure they were effectively represented in the city’s bid for the Games. She will continue her role with the newly formed LA2028 Organizing Committee, as her team works to ensure that the athletes of the world have the best possible athlete experience at the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nOut of the pool, Janet has also made a name for herself as a commercial spokesperson, author, reality television personality, and a highly sought after motivational speaker. Her first book, “Janet Evans’ Total Swimming,” was published in 2007 and offers fitness programs, workouts, and proper swim techniques to readers.\n\nJanet executes speeches for top companies in varying fields including: Technology, Healthcare, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Apparel, Banking, Insurance, non-profits and many others. She lives in Southern California with her husband Billy and their two young children, Sydney and Jake.\n\nLolita Lopez joined NBC4 Southern California as a general assignment reporter in 2011.

On that date, Mallory Weggemann received an epidural injection to help treat back pain; however, by the time it was finished, she was forever changed. Complications with the procedure left the college freshman paralyzed from the belly-button down.\n\nWeggemann has been a competitive swimmer since the age of seven. After her injury at the age of 18, Weggemann chose to return to the pool. In April 2008, her older sister found an article in the local newspaper highlighting the Paralympic Swimming Trials for the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games. The meet was being held at the University of Minnesota Aquatics Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Still coping with her new disability, Weggemann found one thing unchanged, her love for swimming.\n\nWhile attending the meet as a spectator with her sister, she met several of the US National Team coaches. The following Monday, Weggemann returned to the pool and has been swimming ever since. She touts her Paralympic trials experience as life changing. “I have always loved the sport, but when this happened I thought my days of swimming were over and when I realized I could still do it, well I will never forget that moment.” Weggemann broke her first set of world records in Edmonton, Alberta Canada in July 2009. At the 2009 Short Course IPC Swimming World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in November 2009, Weggemann broke six more world records and took home five gold medals. In August 2010, at the Long Course IPC Swimming World Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands, Weggemann proved herself again in the pool by taking home eight gold medals and one silver. Weggemann finished the meet with nine World Records. In July of 2011, Mallory was recognized for her outstanding performance at the 2010 World Championships by ESPN, when she was awarded the ESPN ESPY for Best Female Athlete with a Disability.\n\nIn August 2012, just days after being reclassified at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, Mallory showcased her amazing abilities by winning gold and setting a Paralympic Record in the 50m freestyle. Mallory also anchored the bronze medal winning 4x100m medley relay team, bringing USA back from fifth place to almost capturing gold! It has been deemed one of the most memorable moments of the London Games, and it inspired many across the world.\n\nJust under four months after becoming paralyzed Mallory was back in the pool, with her eyes on Gold at the 2012 Paralympic Games. Having achieved that goal, she decided it was time to chase her ultimate dream, to walk again. For years, this was something that was deemed impossible, but a new possibility arose and in order to achieve her goal, Mallory reached out to the public to ask for their support through a crowd funding Indiegogo campaign. On November 16, 2013 Mallory’s dream came true, and she was able to “walk” again for the first time in nearly six years with her loved ones by her side. In order to accomplish this dream Mallory worked very closely with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN to learn how to use her customized leg braces with the assistance of forearm crutches. Although, Mallory’s wheelchair will never be replaced by her customized leg braces and forearm crutches, they have allowed her to have short moments of upright mobility and the freedom of standing at her 5’ 9” stature again.\n\nCurrently, Weggemann just returned home from the the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and competed in an unprecedented seven individual events, while representing Team USA in her second Paralympic Games this past September. In addition, Mallory is actively building upon her career outside of the pool as a highly sought-after motivational speaker, writing and other public appearances around the world. Mallory is currently publishing her work monthly for the Huffington Post on various motivational, inspirational and leadership topics and heavily involved in disability advocacy efforts on Capitol Hill, as well as serving as a board member on Delta Airlines Disability Advisory Board.

Her father, Paul, is an ordained minister who was an excellent sprinter as a teen. She inherited her long legs from her school teacher mother, Marlean. Allyson followed her older brother, Wes, into the sport, although she did not try out for the track team until her ninth-grade year at Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills.\n\nAt her first practice Coach Jonathon Patton asked her to run 40-meters and thought he must have mis-measured the distance when he saw Allyson’s time. He re-measured and asked her to run again, and she did, but with the same results. Just ten weeks after that tryout, Allyson was racing at the California State Finals.\n\nAllyson went on to accomplish impressive feats over her high school career. She broke Marion Jones’ high-school 200-meter record by running 22.51 seconds at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in April of 2003. Just weeks later, Felix turned in an even more impressive performance when she competed in the Banamex Grand Prix in Mexico City’s Olympic Stadium and ran a blazing 22.11 second 200-meter race, which was a new world record in the under-20 category.\n\nFelix emerged as the new American Female sprinter to watch and has never looked back winning three gold medals in the 2012 London Olympic Games and followed that up in 2016 with two more gold medals and another Silver Medal. Under the tutelage of Coach Bob Kersee, she has won a total of six Olympic gold medals and is now the most decorated female track & field Olympian in history."
