        "text": "Fact: Not all comedy movies are created equal. Also, fact: Despite believing you have an elite sense of humor, those comedy movies that you find yourself randomly quoting all the time might be the same ones that cause your bestie to cringe.

There's truly a little something for everyone—all you have to do is find it.\n\nThat's why we want to personally congratulate you for finding this, may we say, hilarious corner of the internet where we've put together a definitive list of the 93 funniest movies of all time that you can watch right now.

Joy Ride\n\nAn important business trip to Asia turns sideways and suddenly becomes an epic journey filled with debauchery. Four Asian American women find themselves in all sorts of wild situations. Along the way, they form memories, friendships, and stronger senses of self.\n\n3. Theater Camp\n\nWhether you've been to theater camp or not doesn't really matter when you watch this film. It is universally hilarious. It follows eccentric staff members of an upstate New York theater camp who somehow need to navigate their differences and figure out how to put on a musical while the camp's founder is in a coma.\n\n4. Babes\n\nThe hilarious comediennes Ilana Glazer and Michelle Buteau star as two besties facing one of the greatest challenges for a woman: motherhood. This movie is just as hilarious as it is heartfelt.\n\n5. The Hot Chick\n\nJessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams) is the hottest, most popular—but also the meanest—girl in high school. She thinks she has it all, and doesn't think twice about the way she lives her life. Until one day, when a curse turns everything upside down. She wakes up in the body of a man she encountered at a gas station (Rob Schneider), and now she's got to figure out how to get her gorgeous body and life back.\n\n6. Mrs. Doubtfire\n\nRobin Williams is one of the greatest comedians and actors of all time, and this is a movie you absolutely cannot miss. Mrs. Doubtfire is a classic, heartwarming family comedy about a divorcé who's so desperate to spend time with his kids that he dresses up as an older British nanny.\n\n7. EuroTrip\n\nAfter getting dumped by his high school girlfriend at a graduation party, an Ohio teen decides to go on vacation and meet his German pen pal. It turns into a big trip to Europe with his friends, and in the process of immersing themselves in Euro culture, they into all sorts of sticky situations.\n\n8. Old School\n\nLuke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn play three best friends trying to get their lives together. After getting his heart broken, attorney Mitch (Wilson) moves to a new place near a college campus. As his two buddies try to lift his spirits, they wind up turning his place into a party pad. This causes problems for the nearby college's dean.\n\n9. The Interview\n\nPopular tabloid TV show Skylark Tonight manages to book an interview with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (Randall Park) after finding out that he's a big fan of the show. Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) prepare for their trip to Pyongyang. However, before they leave, the CIA taps them for a special mission: assassinate the dictator.\n\n10. Up in Smoke\n\nIconic '70s comedy duo Cheech and Chong star in this film about two like-minded potheads who go on misadventures and wind up competing in a rock band contest.\n\n11. Starsky & Hutch\n\nThis buddy cop action comedy is an adaptation of the popular series from the '70s. Ben Stiller plays the high-strung, by-the-book detective David Starsky, and Owen Wilson is the carefree Ken \"Hutch\" Hutchinson. The two are clearly at odds, but they are forced to work together to catch one of the biggest criminals in Bay City, California.\n\n12. Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\n\nThis NASCAR parody film follows superstar driver Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell), who's at the top of his game. He's built a reputation as being the one to beat, that is until French Formula One champion Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) decides to enter the race. Bobby ends up losing all his fame and glory. Now, he has to pick himself back up and become the champion he once was.\n\n13. Anger Management\n\nMild-mannered businessman Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) gets caught up in an incident and mistakenly ends up being sentenced to an anger management program. There he meets Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), his unusual, aggressive, and confrontational instructor. The two somehow end up moving in with each other.\n\n14. Bruce Almighty\n\nWhat if you could play God for a day? That's the exact question this movie tries to answer. When Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) complains that God isn't treating him right, God (played by Morgan Freeman) offers him all of his powers to see if he can do better.\n\n15. Ride Along\n\nAfter two years of dating his girlfriend, security guard Ben (Kevin Hart) still feels like he has to prove himself to her police officer brother James (Ice Cube). Ben gets into the police academy, and decides to ask for James' blessing to marry his sister. To prove his worth even further, Ben volunteers to accompany James on a 24-hour patrol through the toughest parts of Atlanta.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n16. The Simpsons Movie\n\nHomer is at it again with his shenanigans, only this time the damage has reached far beyond Springfield. He triggers a disaster that threatens the entire world. Now it's up to him to fix his mess.\n\n17. Dr. Dolittle\n\nVeterinarian Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) regains his childhood ability to communicate with animals. At first, he thinks it's an incredible gift that he can use to better his work. But soon, he begins to question whether it's a blessing or a curse.\n\n18. The LEGO Batman Movie\n\nThe entire LEGO film franchise isn't just for kids, okay? The films are just as funny (if not, even funnier given the adult inside jokes) for people 18 and over. This parody of the iconic DC superhero is particularly *chef's\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n19. Superbad\n\nTwo inseparable friends navigate their last few weeks of high school and are invited to a giant house party. Together with their nerdy friend, they try their best to score enough alcohol to supply the party and kick-start their sex lives before heading off to college, but let's just say their quest gets kinda complicated.\n\n20. Dumb and Dumber\n\nAfter a woman leaves her suitcase in a car on the way to an airport, a limo driver and his equally imbecilic friend set out on a hilarious cross-country road trip to return it, completely oblivious to the fact that they're being pursued by hired killers and police.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n21. Raising Arizona\n\nWhen an ex-con and ex-cop decide to help themselves to another family's quintuplets after discovering that they are infertile, mayhem ensues when the child's rich father sends a bounty hunter after them.\n\n22. Clue\n\nSix guests are anonymously invited to a strange mansion for dinner, but after their host is killed, they must cooperate with staff to identify the murderer as bodies continue to pile up. Trust, there's some comedy in there!\n\n23. Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit/Kazakhstan\n\nHave you ever seen a film that feels so real that you forget it's just one giant joke? Because this is it! Kazakh TV talking head Borat is dispatched to the U.S. to report on the country, and with the documentary crew in tow, he becomes more interested in relocating and marrying Pamela Anderson.\n\n24. The Blues Brothers\n\nJake Blues rejoins his brother after being released from prison. His first task? Save the orphanage they grew up in from closing. And they're completely convinced that they can earn enough money to do so by getting their old band back together.\n\n25. Anchorman\n\nWill Ferrell plays the iconic character of hotshot TV anchorman Ron Burgundy, who welcomes Veronica, a new reporter. As she dives headfirst into the male-dominated world of 1970s broadcast news, she begins to outshine Ron. When his fragile ego is hurt, he becomes jealous, and his career is challenged by his new co-anchor.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n26. Caddyshack\n\nWhile caddying at a snooty country club, Danny is hoping to receive a college scholarship, but first he must impress elitist Judge Smails and win a big gold tournament. Meanwhile, a crude construction tycoon wreaks havoc to be accepted in the exclusive club and a wild groundskeeper stalks a rampaging gopher.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n27. Rush Hour\n\nIs the 1998 comedy classic Rush Hour a bit…problematic to watch in 2024? Maybe, but there’s no denying the comedic chemistry between leads Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, who play an odd couple of agents—one from China (Chang) and one from LA (Tucker) — who must work together to recover the kidnapped daughter of a Chinese Consul. There’s a reason fans are still clamoring for more Rush Hour movies 20 years later: action comedies have truly never been so funny, and so full of heart-stopping action.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n28. Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul.\n\nAfter her husband, Southern Baptist Mega Church pastor Lee-Curtis Childs (Sterling K. Brown), is caught in a sex scandal, Trinitie Childs (Regina Hall) finds herself in the unique position of desperately trying to reclaim her throne while also trying to keep her husband on track. This mockumentary-style dark comedy from writer-director Adamma Ebo is at times outrageous and at times heartbreaking, but it'll keep you laughing no matter what.\n\n29. Airplane!\n\nIf you’re a fan of the absurd, put Airplane on your Must Watch list. The 1980 film stars Robert Hayus, Julie Hagerty, and Leslie Nielsen, among others, as pilots, flight attendants, and passengers tackling food poisoning and mass chaos on one hilariously harrowing flight.\n\n30. Game Night\n\nA group of friends obsessed with game nights find themselves running for their lives after one of them is kidnapped by gun-wielding gangsters. But is it all just a game? Come for the absurd premise, stay for Jesse Plemons’ bone-chilling performance and Rachel McAdams giving one of the great comedic line readings of our time.\n\n31. Sorry to Bother You\n\nSorry to Bother You is a dark, outrageous satire of modern capitalism from writer-director Boots Riley that will definitely leave an impression. The film follows Cassius Green (LaKeith Stanfield), a telemarketer who becomes incredibly successful by using his “white voice” to make sales. But as he moves up in the ranks, his morals become compromised, and he soon finds himself in the middle of a war between the working class and the absurdly rich.\n\n32. The Great Dictator\n\nCharlie Chaplin took on Hitler in the 1940 release, The Great Dictator. Chaplin plays two roles in the film: Adenoid Hynkel, a dictator with a Hitler mustache, desperate for power, and a Jewish farmer trying to survive under Hynkel’s increasingly dangerous and hateful regime.\n\n33. Some Like It Hot\n\nMarilyn Monroe delivers an iconic performance in Some Like It Hot, a comedy from Billy Wilder starring Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as two musicians who go on the run after witnessing a mob hit. In their effort to stay alive, they disguise themselves as two women and join an all-female band on tour.\n\n34. Office Space\n\nEveryone knows how much office life can suck—especially if you got used to working from home and then had to give that up. This movie gets what you're going through, trust. Also, fun fact: If you like Barry, this is what actor Stephen Root used to be most known for (mutters: \"I could set the building on fire.\")\n\n35. Another Round\n\nWhat a concept: Four teachers decide to test the premise that when you're juuuuuust a little drunk, all the time, you're a more functional person. What happens is hilarious, tragic, and earth-shattering all at once—no spoilers, just go watch Mads Mikkelsen doing his best work. When (ugh) the American remake ultimately debuts, just go straight to the source material.\n\n36. Yes, God, Yes\n\nIf you grew up religious and aren't so much anymore, holy sh*t will this movie make you laugh. Then cry. Then laugh again. It's the story of a young woman (Natalia Dyer) who has *normal sexual urges*. But because she's in a v v religious environment, she's made to feel embarrassed (and worse, slut-shamed). Right in the middle of this whole cringefest, there's a beautiful dialogue about learning to be okay with yourself and getting away from people who judge you.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n37. This is Spinal Tap\n\nThis satire of the music industry follows a metal band trying to recapture some of their former glory. If you've ever wondered where the phrase \"it goes to 11\" comes from, look no further. Also, be prepared to go down the Rob Reiner movie rabbit hole after you watch this.\n\n28. Thor: Ragnarok\n\nNot all Marvel movies are funny, and TBH, you can probably skip the first Thor movies and just read the Wikipedia synopses. But after you've watched Black Panther, make sure you dive into MCU canon with this. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is a joke machine alongside his adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, also never funnier) and every single other character in this.\n\n39. The Personal History of David Copperfield\n\nThis movie was delayed foreeeeever because of the pandemic, but it was worth. the. wait. Dev Patel (hot!) does the classic Dickens character justice, but stay for the supporting cast because they're the ones making you laugh every two minutes. If you stayed away because you had to read the book in HS and were bored—go and watch this movie ASAP. Right now.\n\n40. Eighth Grade\n\nImagine scrolling through your most embarrassing middle school Facebook posts for 90 minutes—that's basically how watching this feels, but in an enjoyable, funny way. Man, you're gonna wanna laugh, but also protect the movie’s eighth-grade protagonist from all that's bad in the world.\n\n41. Girls Trip\n\nSometimes, there’s nothing better than watching a good group of friends go absolutely haywire. Not only did this movie introduce us to Tiffany Haddish, but it’ll inspire messy girl’s weekends for years to come. Also, Paul Thomas Anderson recently called it one of his favorite movies of all time. Would you ever doubt PTA? Happy grapefruiting.\n\n42. Banana Split\n\nTwo new BFFs share something in common, and it's that one of them used to date the other one's BF. Come for Dylan Sprouse with a truly terrible haircut (wig?), stay for Liana Liberato and Hannah Marks being the couple you're actually rooting for. Also, if you've already watched this and want a similar vibe, check out . YW.\n\n43. Booksmart\n\nThis is possibly Olivia Wilde’s greatest accomplishment since her stint on The O.C. Her directorial debut takes the standard \"last day of high school\" movie structure and makes it seem completely one-of-a-kind. The characters are so well-written, and the soundtrack absolutely bangs.\n\n44. The Hangover\n\nThree buddies wake up from a bachelor party in Vegas with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing (sounds like a fun night!). They make their way around the city in order to find their friend before he must say, \"I do.\"\n\n45. Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar\n\nK, so you either love or hate this movie. Here's what you need to enjoy it: Have you ever gone on a beach resort/cruise/all-inclusive vacay with your family and lived that truly awkward experience? This is that but funny. It's such a specific experience (IYKYK times a million), and then about 20 minutes into the movie, it just goes balls to the wall in the best way.\n\n46. Meet The Parents\n\nIf you’re scared your in-laws don’t like you, this movie will assure you that it could always be worse. This list wouldn’t even be close to complete without this hilarious addition. Also, it has Robert De Niro’s most iconic performance. (Totally ignores Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and countless others.)\n\n47. Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\n\nWho doesn’t want everyone to be jealous of them at their high school reunion? Here, we follow a pair of friends who are desperate to impress, even if that means stretching a fewwww truths. I mean, 1) Lisa Kudrow, 2) cute outfits, and 3) delusional best friends spiraling? Sign me up.\n\n48. 21 Jump Street\n\nHigh school drug stings have literally never been more endearing. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill star as naive undercover cops and shocked 2012 audiences everywhere with their effortless on-screen chemistry. It's a guaranteed laugh, and probably the rare instance of a comedy where the sequel also holds up (the brilliantly titled 22 Jump Street.)\n\n49. Billy Madison\n\nBefore we were blessed with the glory that is Uncut Gems, some might’ve called this Adam Sandler's only great movie (don't come for me). Happy Gilmore is good, and The Wedding Singer is pretty charming, but this is just a straight-up comedic masterpiece.\n\n50. Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\n\nA delightful romp starring two of the most watchable dudes in the game. Also, it's more progressive than you think! As writer Ashley Spurgeon once pointed out on Twitter, Harold & Kumar actually passes the Bechdel Test if you count the time the women play battle shits in the bathroom!\n\n51. Spaceballs\n\nYou don't have to like the movie that Spaceballs parodies (Star Wars, ever heard of it??) to appreciate this hilarious take on a ragtag group of outer space weirdos. The entire movie is extremely quotable, so get ready to enter a very excellent club where you can talk about things like ludicrous speed and Pizza the Hutt.\n\n52. Elf\n\nWhen Will Ferrell was cast as Buddy the Elf, an angel got its wings. It's the role he was meant to play, and it's just such a lovely, sweet, funny, hopeful movie about being yourself and believing in magic that it deserves its spot next to Die Hard as one of the best Christmas movies ever made.\n\n53. Bridesmaids\n\nThe movie that introduced the once-in-a-lifetime talent of Melissa McCarthy to the world. Not only is it poop-your-wedding-gown funny (sorry; I don't even really like that scene, but it is the scene everyone knows), but it's also a heartwarming yet snarky ode to the power of female friendship. Oh, also, WILSON PHILLIPS is in it. 10/10.\n\n54. Shaun of the Dead\n\nThe only movie about zombies worth watching. (Well, except for Zombieland. That is a good movie with a good cast! It's funny, too! But not funny enough for this list!) Director Edgar Wright is both totally unhinged and completely in control of this wild ride, and it'll make you laugh a lot and also never want to visit the English countryside.\n\n55. A Fish Called Wanda\n\nA British gangster and his hapless aide team up with a pair of arrogant Americans for a massive diamond heist. When the job goes badly, they try to double-cross one another for the loot.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n56. Clueless\n\nAs if I even needed to tell you this was gonna be on the list. Plus, Paul Rudd as Cher's stepbrother/boyfriend (?!) launched a million girls' obsessions with hot nerds.\n\n57. Bottle Rocket\n\nCa-caw! This is Wes Anderson before Wes Anderson ruined Wes Anderson. Nah, he's still fine and great and everything, but Bottle Rocket is an unpolished, awkward masterpiece. It'll also make you want to call up your best friends and convince them to do something stupid with you. Don't! Instead, watch Rushmore, Anderson's second-best movie that probably also deserves to be on this list.\n\n58. Bringing Up Baby\n\nKatharine Hepburn and Cary Grant star in this charming screwball comedy that has more gags than Christian Grey's Red Room. And it's wonderful (why are pratfalls so funny??). I think, deep down, we just hate each other. Can a sociologist confirm that for me?\n\n59. Coming to America\n\nI am running out of ways to call these movies perfect, but you would be hard-pressed to find a more perfect movie than Coming to America. It's so iconic that Beyoncé dressed up as a character from it for Halloween. Do I need to say more?\n\n60. Wet Hot American Summer\n\nI know that when I type LOL, most of the time, I'm just slightly smiling at my desk. When I say this movie is LOL, I mean you will be laughing until tears are running out of all your orifices. And if you actually went to summer camp as a kid, this will just ruin you. Ruin you!\n\n61. Mean Girls\n\nGet in, loser, we're going to see the best movie about being a teenage girl ever made. Tina Fey's 2005 take on the well-documented existence of queen bees speaks to the hearts and minds of any woman who has ever gone to high school. We laugh so we don't cry, and also because it's hilarious.\n\n62. My Cousin Vinny\n\nMarisa Tomei won an Oscar for her performance in this movie, and let me tell you: They should've just shut down the Academy Awards afterward because no performance will ever be as inspired as her take on Mona Lisa Vito, my queen. And her wardrobe! Every piece is iconic.\n\n63. Hot Fuzz\n\nThe second Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg movie on here (watch Shaun of the Dead first, then this one) totally makes fun of an overenthusiastic cop stuck in a rural town in England. AND THEN. You're not expecting it to become an OTT, legitimately intense action movie and it totally does.\n\n64. Step Brothers\n\nTwo comedic powerhouses, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, are perfectly matched in this tale of two old-ass weirdos who are forced to be roommates when their parents move in together. It includes one of the truly great chase scenes of this century—and I'm including all the Fast and Furious movies, so you know it's serious!!!\n\n65. School of Rock\n\nWriter Mike White bottled the essence of comedian Jack Black's soul and turned it into the sweetest, funniest, most good-hearted comedy of the past bazillion years. Plus, the songs are catchy AF.\n\n66. Zoolander\n\nIt's so dumb and great, and I love it so much. Stupid movies are the best movies and this is the crème de la crème of idiocy. It doesn't hurt that the top-notch cast is all working at 11; I mean, they are just throwing themselves into this garbage with all they've got. It's a wonder. (Also, sorta unrelated, but The Ladies Man is another super-dumb and super-great movie.)\n\n67. Jumpin' Jack Flash\n\nThis movie has it all! There's action, there's mystery, there's some of the best physical comedy you'll ever see! I enjoy double featuring this with Sister Act for what I like to call \"An Afternoon of Whoopi.\" I live in excitement/fear for the day Hollywood remakes this film with Kevin Hart as the lead. YOU KNOW IT'S COMING.\n\n68. Bend It Like Beckham\n\nParminder Nagra's comedic timing is next-level and makes this coming-of-age tale better than, like, 99 percent of other coming-of-age tales.\n\n69. His Girl Friday\n\nThis mile-a-minute wackadoo comedy features more one-liners than an evening at an improv show—a good improv show! Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are perfectly matched, and their chemistry damn near lights the house on fire.\n\n70. Friday\n\nIf you smoke weed, you have to see this movie. If you don't smoke weed—and it's legal where you are and you want to do it!—then you should smoke some weed and watch this wonderful movie. Bonus points: This is where \"Bye, Felicia\" comes from, and if you didn't already know that, isn't it about damn time you did?\n\n71. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\n\nIf I could marry one movie, it would be this one. Steve Martin and Michael Caine as two low-down dirty rotten scoundrels being bad boys on the French Riviera. Please excuse me, I have to go watch it for the millionth time rn.\n\n72. The Big Sick\n\nIf you don't love Kumail Nanjiani (buff or not buff!), what are you even doing with your life? Semi-based on the real-life story (!!!) of his relationship with his wife, writer/producer Emily V. Gordon, \"Emily\" and \"Kumail\" fall in love and struggle with cultural differences, and then she falls into a coma. It's way funnier than it sounds, trust.\n\n73. Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging\n\nThere's something so sweet about watching a young English girl crush on the hot guy from her prep school...until you realize how many jokes there are in this movie that you totally didn't get when you were young but will find hilarious now. (This also falls into the \"so bad it's good\" category, which is an absolutely worthy category.)\n\n74. Easy A\n\nThis early Emma Stone movie basically creates the perfect fake family (who doesn't want Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as their parents? Who??) but also has a lot to say about shaming other people's sex lives—it's inspired by The Scarlet Letter, after all. TBH, though, the best part of the movie is my forever crush, Amanda Bynes.\n\n75. The 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\nOf all the Judd Apatow movies, this is prob the sweetest. Steve Carell is, yes, the titular virgin who feels like he's destined to never have sex. Enter in his clueless, raunchy friends and a gorge age-appropriate lady (Katherine Keener), and the quest to get it on has never been funnier.\n\n76. Neighbors\n\nSeth Rogan truly meets his comedic match in Rose Byrne: The two are new parents at war with a neighboring fraternity (Zac Efron has never been funnier, I will die on this hill). But if you've ever felt like you just can't handle, like, life in general—much less parenthood—you will enjoy these two \"adults\" trying to figure everything out.\n\n77. What We Do in the Shadows\n\nIt's kinda like a reality show but with vampires. Which, fine, but in the hands of Taika Waititi, it's so deeply awkward and funny—if you've ever had terrible roommates, you will feel so seen. Yes, the is rlly rlly funny (and you should watch it afterward), but this is where it all started.\n\n78. Sister Act\n\nThis movie is, IMO, one of the best movies to come out of the 1990s. With Whoopi Goldberg starring as a lounge singer turned nun (thanks to being placed in the Witness Protection Program), and Maggie Smith (you know... Professor McGonagall in the Harry Potter films?) playing the Reverend Mother, it's comedic gold. Also, watch the sequel.\n\n79. Napoleon Dynamite\n\nNapoleon Dynamite has got to be one of the most iconic characters in cult classic comedy. This 2004 film is a nostalgic watch for anyone who grew up in the early aughts. Reminisce and watch as our awkward teen protagonist Napoleon and the new kid Pedro launch a campaign for class presidency.\n\n80. Nacho Libre\n\nThere is no question that this is one of the greatest comedic masterpieces of all time. And, of course, it stars Jack Black.
