Through powerful interviews, archival footage, and expert testimony, “Blackfish” presents a damning indictment of the captivity industry and its impact on both orcas and humans.\n\nShedding Light on Captive Orca Treatment\n\nOne of the key achievements of “Blackfish” was its ability to expose the harsh realities of life for orcas held in captivity.
