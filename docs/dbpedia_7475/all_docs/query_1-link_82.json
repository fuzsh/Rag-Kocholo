They play the characters of five good friends who have known each other since they were 12-year-olds and even won a CYO basketball championship as a team. As they reunite 30 years later, youâll see a group of men in their forties relieving the good old days.\n\nA first look at the comedy superstar casts will probably give you an idea about how the reunion of these friends will turn out. They sure have âgrown up,â having their own families, kids, jobs, businesses, and all. But have they really? If youâre curious about the adventure of these kids-at-heart adults, this guide features some of the best scenes in Grown Ups (spoiler alert!). Plus, it highlights various filming locations you can explore.\n\nThe death of their beloved old coach, Bobby âBuzzerâ Ferdinando (Blake Clark), brought together the team who hadnât seen one another for three decades. With their families, they return to New England for the funeral and spend the 4th of July weekend at the lake house. They row out to an island to spread their coachâs ashes, play games, go to a water park, and have a barbecue. They also have a basketball rematch against Dickie (Colin Quinn) and his teammates to settle old scores.\n\nThree summers later, Lenny (Adam Sandler) and his friends are back together in Grown Ups 2. This time, Lenny relocates his family back to his hometown, where he grew up. He reconnects with his old team, and together, they work hard to navigate the unrelenting mid-life crisis.\n\nThe Grown Ups movies may not have mind-bending twists or a sophisticated plot, but theyâll surely make you smile and laugh. You may like the dad jokes or not, but youâll likely end up rooting for the characters as they deal with life as grown-ups.\n\nGrown Ups Locations\n\nIn the first movie, numerous shots were filmed in Essex, a hidden gem in Massachusetts with a scenic landscape. However, besides Essex, the Grown Ups filming locations consist of various venues across the state, including Marblehead, Southborough, and Boston. A few scenes also took place in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe film is set at a lake house near the fictional Amoskeag Lake. But in reality, the filming location for Grown Ups lake scenes is in Chebacco Lake. Itâs a 209- acre lake thatâs classified as a âGreat Pond,â placing it under state ownership. Itâs an excellent spot for swimming, fishing, kayaking, boating, and other water activities.\n\nLike the 2010 Grown Ups film, the second movie was filmed across various locations in the state of Massachusetts. However, the production picked Marblehead and Swampscott as its primary Grown Ups 2 location. They even built an eighty-foot high soundstage that serves as Lennyâs house and backyard, complete with fantastic amenities, like a pool house and tennis courts. It was set behind the Swampscott townâs football field.\n\nGrown Ups 2 is the first film shot almost entirely in these two distinct towns in Massachusetts. They offer a small-town feel perfect for the film.\n\nWe canât talk about the movie and not mention one of the funny scenes in Grown Ups during the coachâs funeral. After Lenny delivers his heartfelt and witty eulogy, Rob pours out his heart, singing Ave Maria. While heâs singing, Lenny and Kurt (Chris Rock) make a five-dollar bet that Rob will go down on one knee with Buzzerâs picture.\n\nThe comedy then breaks out at the funeral when Rob starts moving around while singing with the huge picture in his hands. Later on, though heâs no longer holding the picture, he goes down on one knee, resulting in Kurt giving Lenny a five-dollar note.\n\nAs if waiting for the right time, Marcus (David Spade) drops the buzzer sound after Rob stops singing, causing everyone in the room to laugh. Quite annoyed, he says, âGrow up, will you?â to which Lenny responds, âDonât get so mad there, Robbie.â\n\nThis iconic scene was shot in Pilgrim Congregational Church, situated in the historic center of Southborough, Massachusetts. Itâs a beautiful white church built nearly 200 years ago in a suburban setting. Besides its weekly services, itâs a great venue for weddings and memorials. It is close to the intersection of Routes 30 and 35 and just a few minutesâ walk from the town center.\n\nBoston Filming Locations Exploration\n\nAfter the funeral, we now see the guys arriving at the picturesque lakehouse with their families and kids. In this scene, viewers are awarded an aerial shot of the natural paradise that will give you those pleasant summer vibes.\n\nWith a bunch of kids and adults in one big house, it can be tricky to choose a room for every family. Thatâs why Rob creates âthe map of who-gets-which-roomâ and takes the liberty of reserving the room with the waterbed for him and Gloria, his fourth wife, whoâs thirty years older than him. Many of the scenes in the film were shot in the lakehouse and the surrounding area. The production used the Grove cottage located in Centennial Grove in Essex. They also renovated the buildings on the property, replanted the grass, improved the parking lot, and built two new basketball courts at the Grove.\n\nLocal town officers revealed that the town has significantly benefited from being used as a film location for Grown Ups. The production left the property in a much better condition than they found it, and itâs now a great place to visit for vacation.\n\nIf youâre coming from route 133 in Ipswich, take a right turn after the Congregational Church. Then take another right turn to Martin Street, taking you to route 22. Continue on this route until you find the Centennial Grove Road. Keep going until the end, and youâre at the Centennial Grove. You can use any of the two exits to get to Centennial Grove: exit 15 in Manchester or exit 18 in Beverly.\n\nDiscover Boston Video Shoot Locations\n\nOne morning, the five men go rowing to an island to bid their final goodbye to Buzzer and spread his ashes. Itâs also when Rob opens up to his friends about his personal struggle, telling them that he messed up his previous marriages. âItâs my fault,â he confesses. Heâs also anxious about meeting his daughters, who will arrive in a few minutes.\n\nThe scene where you see them boating on a lake was shot in Chebacco Lake. Itâs one of the central Grown Ups locations located between Hamilton and the coastal town of Essex, MA. This body of water has been the center of a meaningful and rich history and provides a home to aquatic species. Visitors enjoy swimming, boating, kayaking, fishing, and canoeing in the waters of Chebacco Lake. As a 209-acre lake, it provides plenty of areas for you to explore and take advantage of freshwater adventures. It is also surrounded by beautiful cottages, vacation homes, and woodlands, making the area a great spot to unwind and relax.\n\nTo get to the lake, off Route 1A, follow Rt 22 towards Essex/Hamilton. Then find Chebacco Road after the farmstand.\n\nLocate Boston Film Shoot Locations\n\nDo you remember the water park scene where the five friends completely unleashed their inner child? Lenny decides they should go to a water park for a day, and the guys, along with their kids and partners, have the best time.\n\nOne of the scenes involves the four women ogling a water park hunk (Alex Musser). They feel so thrilled seeing the man approaching them slowly. Out of the blue, youâll hear Gloriaâs hilarious comment, âWhatever you do, donât fart.â Much to the ladiesâ surprise, his voice in the film is not as sexy as his body, causing them to burst into laughter and leaving the Canadian hunk offended.\n\nMeanwhile, the children and their dads are enjoying the water slides. And then thereâs Rob pushing a rude attendant down the water slide for being disrespectful to his daughters and calling one of them âfugly.â\n\nIf youâre wondering where the water park scene was filmed, youâll have to go to Wareham, the Gateway to Cape Cod. The Grown Ups production chose Water Wizz of Cape Cod in 2009 as one of its filming locations, showcasing its fantastic facility. Established in 1982, Water Wizz was the first water attraction in New England with four serpentine slides.\n\nToday, it features more water features, rides, a shop, and other outstanding attractions. It is located on routes 6 and 28, close to Buzzards Bay. Itâs only about five minutes from routes 25 and 195, twenty minutes from Plymouth and Falmouth.\n\nBrowse Boston Production Spaces\n\nOne of the best scenes in Grown Ups takes place in a family restaurant called Woodmanâs Eat in the Rough. Itâs another hilarious scene where Lenny needs to explain what âwastedâ means to the kids after Marcus reminisces the time they used to spend at the diner late at night in high school after getting wasted.\n\nStruggling for the right words to say, Lenny comes up with what he believes is a perfect explanation appropriate for children. As a result, all the kids jubilantly expressed their strong desire to be wasted. One of the little girls even said she wanted to âget wasted every single day of her life!â The movie was filmed at an actual restaurant for the dining scene. They used Woodmanâs of Essex, a New England seaside restaurant since 1914. It meets multiple production needs, including a convenient space, delicious menu, and easy access to the region through the Logan Airport.\n\nExplore Filming Locations"
