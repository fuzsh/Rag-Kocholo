        "text": "I once saw a blues guitarist playing in a chain restaurant at the mall in Annapolis. At first, I thought it was sad. I mean, who wants to play B.B. King’s “The Thrill Is Gone” while watching the line for lunch combos shuffle forward at Potbelly?\n\nBut if you scan the Annapolis arts scene, that’s part of the charm. Art abounds in unexpected places: paintings on the walls of a restaurant, one-act plays in a record store and now — finally getting to the point here — standup comedy in a board shop.\n\n“It is an unusual venue but that’s what makes the magic!” said Kevin Slattery, promoter of Pure Comedy.\n\nThe former Annapolis resident has been organizing the small comedy shows at Pure Boardshop since October, setting up approximately 40 chairs along a display of boards facing shelves of skate shoes.\n\n“I’m a comedian. I’m from Annapolis originally,” Slattery said. “There wasn’t really a scene here in Annapolis, much. You’d have the odd show, but there’s not necessarily a comedy venue.”\n\nLike a lot of comedians, he sets up shows to gain stage time. When he approached Annapolis bar owners, he got the cold shoulder. Entertainment in most of those places is about the music, not the laughs.\n\nJosh and Kelly Blorstad, owners of Pure Boardshop, were all in from the day Slattery walked into their store and pitched the idea.\n\n“The little teenager in me who was watching Comedy Central standup said that would be fantastic,” Blorstad said.\n\nWhen the shows started, the comedians figured the audience would be made up of skateboarders and snowboarders. They leaned into jokes they thought would appeal to them. But, to even Blorstad’s surprise, that’s not who’s been turning out.\n\n“They tried a few of the jokes, and I was standing in the back of the club, the only one laughing,” he said.\n\nThat’s changed. On Friday, Matt Pennington will lead a lineup of five comedians; Slattery will host the show. Pennington is also from Annapolis and works as the box office manager at Magooby’s Joke House in Timonium. He’s performed at the DC Improv comedy club.\n\n“The show last month, we had right around 40 tickets sold,” Slattery said. “Because of the way we set the room, it feels packed. The laughs get rolling and you feel it.”\n\nIt’s an 18-and-up show, with doors to Pure Boardshop, located in the Gardner Center on Forest Drive, open at 7:30 p.m. The show starts at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15. It is a BYOB event and only 40 seats are available. The shop offers a 10% discount for sales with your ticket purchase.\n\nThis has gone so well that Blorstand is in talks with ArtFarm owners Alison Harbaugh and Darin Gilliam, local arts promoters, about adding other types of shows.\n\nHere are more things to do in the next seven days.\n\nGarden Theatre’s season finale\n\n8:30 p.m. Thursday. Show runs through Sept. 1.\n\nAnnapolis Summer Garden Theatre opens its final show of the season, “Big Fish,” which runs through Sept. 1. Based on the fantasy novel by Daniel Wallace and the 2003 film adaptation by director Tim Burton, the play tells the story of Edward Bloom, a traveling salesman with a history of fantastical adventures.\n\nTickets sell out quickly at this theater, although the company releases returned or unused tickets on the morning of each show; the Thursday night performance was nearly sold out by Wednesday night. $30.\n\nWine at the fairgrounds\n\n11 a.m. Saturday\n\nSoca Wine, a Maryland wine and music promoter, is back at the Anne Arundel County Fairgrounds with its DMV Summer R&B Wine Festival. The Caribbean-theme music is mixed with the company’s blends, including chardonnay, DMV white and a traditional Caribbean varietal, guava wine. Bring chairs, tents, blankets, snacks and water. $30, plus fees and parking.\n\nCacao (Deluxe)\n\n7:30 p.m. Saturday\n\nMaryland Hall Presents is the arts center’s in-house series and continues this summer with Baltimore jazz saxophonist Brent Birckhead, who will perform works from his latest album “Cacao (Deluxe).”\n\nRemaining tickets for the show are $45-$55.\n\nGood dog, good walk\n\n9 a.m. Sunday\n\nPup Scouts leads training sessions in Quiet Waters Park, teaching dogs to walk on leash, often in single file while keeping an appropriate distance from other dogs on the walk. It’s a great way to practice dog walking skills and socialization. Pack sessions start at $60.\n\nCorvettes on West\n\n9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday\n\nCarriages on West Street is a nod to the old practice of people disembarking from ships in Annapolis and then taking horse-drawn carriages down West Street and out of the city to their eventual destinations.\n\nCorvette Annapolis celebrates that history by using the term as the name of its summer show on the first block of West Street. Talk with owners, admire the cars and enjoy shops and restaurants along the block. Free admission.\n\nFiber is good for you\n\n10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily\n\nEvery other year, the Maryland Federation of Art calls for artists working in fiber to submit entries for its show, “Fiber Options: Material Explorations.” This year, 35 artists are showing 51 works in the Circle Gallery through Aug. 24.\n\nJurors selected five winners, “Blue Earth” by Sarah Evans, “Subway Musician” by Jayne Bentley Gaskins, “Saltwater Taffy” by Susan J. Lapham, “Scorched Grasslands” by Joy Muller-McCoola and “Crown Point” by Wen Redmond.\n\nFree."
