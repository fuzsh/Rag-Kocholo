Everyone — from commercial directors, to professional documentarians, to branded content makers, to everyday people — are getting in on the possibilities of non-fiction.\n\nBut that wasn’t always the case.\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, the word “documentary” evoked thoughts of history films, biographies, and art pieces — more interesting than entertaining. Even using the word “film” instead of “movie” had a kind of intellectualized art house feel to it. In the best case scenario, it was a new story told in an old way, driven by small budgets and less access to the tools enjoyed by bigger studios.\n\nToday, non-fiction is getting credit for being an innovative category of entertainment every bit as exciting, engaging, and entertaining as feature film.\n\nIt’s quite a story.\n\nThe Hero’s Journey"
