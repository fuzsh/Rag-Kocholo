        "text": "I have a confession to make: I miss Katherine Heigl. In the mid- to late 2000s she spent five years doing romantic comedies, or what was left of them by the time she got there. She put up a decent fight. To watch her withstand the jeers of the boy-men in “Knocked Up,” the cave-manning of Gerard Butler in “The Ugly Truth” or the bridesmaid-outfit montage in “27 Dresses” was to witness a genre’s assault on one of its last dedicated practitioners. Heigl didn’t get to show the luminance, flintiness or idiosyncrasy of her romantic-comedy forebears; she was given too few moments of wit or insight. Instead, she was tough, stubborn, gainfully employed and — like most of the women in these movies, by that point — counterproductively heartless, tolerant of whatever partnership the plot backed her into. Her time as a romantic-comedy star was more a feat of survival than a cause for celebration. But as long as Heigl was around, so were romantic comedies, and that was something.\n\nNow both are essentially gone, and we’re making do with substitutions, decoys and mirages: things that seem like romantic comedy but are actually fizzy soap operas (“Crazy Rich Asians”), teen movies (“To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”), funny dramas (“You’re the Worst”), TV Tinder (“Dating Around”) or sports (“The Bachelor”). Half the time, what gets labeled “romantic comedy” is just anything with ordinary women in it (“Book Club” is a deluxe ensemble comedy; “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” is the same, but with ABBA songs). Genuine romantic comedies have vanished entirely. In 2009, seven of the 50 highest-grossing films in North America were some kind of romantic comedy. Last year, virtually none were. So far this year, the thing that has come closest is a sendup that requires Rebel Wilson to imagine she’s in a romantic comedy while she’s actually in a coma. The conventions of romantic comedy are now considered absurd and foreign enough that a regular comedy can laugh about how ridiculous it would be to exist in a romantic one.\n\nYou could easily see the genre’s demise as a form of justice. Don’t women in movies have better things to do than wonder if they’re going to meet some dude? Shouldn’t they be running countries, curing diseases, shooting lasers out of their gloves and spin-kicking anonymous goons over casino balconies? Also: How is it that a genre this old could rarely bring itself to include anyone other than wealthy straight white folks? At its worst, these movies could be painfully formulaic, corny, retrograde about gender and so unrealistic about love that they were often accused of poisoning real-life romance. (Back in 2008, a study in Scotland concluded that watching them can create unrealistic expectations of romantic partners.) Good riddance, you might cry. Enjoy your spot in antiquity! Say hi to westerns for me."
