        "text": "I have been in the midst of a multi-person discussion this week with about a dozen people I never met.\n\nIt’s taking place on the Film and TV Professionals site on Linked In.\n\nActually, although I always accept Linked In requests, I almost never use the site.\n\nPersonally, I can’t figure out what it does, exactly.\n\nI am much more for Facebook\n\n(Feel free to Friend if you like)\n\nIn any event, I became intrigued by a discussion on the Film And TV Professionals page about whether to pay participatns in a documentary.\n\nThe original poster, someone named Alyn, asked whether it was ethical to pay someone, in this case a homeless person, for their participation in a documentary he was shooting.\n\nI was pretty astonished at the outpouring of responses.\n\nThe vast majority of people (not all however) were not only in favor of paying the homeless people, but the discussion soon digressed into whether it was better to pay them or give them sandwiches, or vouchers, or clothing.\n\nSo here’s my take on this.\n\nIf you are a documentary filmmaker, you NEVER pay anyone for participating.\n\nNEVER.\n\nIf you are making a commercial release fiction film or entertainment this is a different issue.\n\nBut a documentary takes us into the world of journalism, and journalism has certain rules and standards.\n\nOne of these rules is, you never pay people to participate.\n\nWhy don’t you pay them?\n\nYou don’t pay them because paying them changes the nature of the relationship. Â If you pay them, they are working for you. And as your employees, it is their job to do what you want them to do. Â As soon as that becomes the nature of the relationship, the faith that the viewer has that ‘everying you see is absolutely true’ is shattered. Â If these people are working for you, if they are now, in fact, actors in your film, how can I know that what I am seeing is real.\n\nIt’s the same reason we actively discourage directing in docs and news. Â It undermines the trust.\n\nAnd in undermining the trust the viewer has in your film, it undermines the trust that people have in the entire genre of documentary films\n\nThere is no National Board of Documentary Films that certifies that THIS FILM IS A+ FOR INTEGRITY.\n\nWe police ourselves, and as such, it is imperative that every documentary filmmaker strive to mainting the creditibility not only of their own work but of the entire genre.\n\nSometimes people will indeed ask you for money before they will participate. If they do, walk away. Find someone else. Â (Often that is enough to change their minds anyway). Personally, I can count on one hand the number of times I have paid for someone to be in a doc or news piece (on two fingers, actually). They were both mistakes.\n\nWhat I am astonished by is the number of people on the Film TV Professionals discussion site who seem to confuse being a filmmaker with being a social worker. They are both important jobs, but they are radically different ones."
