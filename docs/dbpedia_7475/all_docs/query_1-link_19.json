        "text": "Here, in 2021, miracles are mundane. When faced with a novel pandemic, our scientific powers are such that life-saving vaccines can be developed in less than a year. We keep tiny supercomputers in our pockets at all times, through which we can access the entire sum of human knowledge as long as we’re not in a tunnel. If we want to fire a billionaire into space, we can do that, and all we need to master now is the technology to keep them up there.\n\nAnd yet, in this miraculous era, we still labour under a powerful misapprehension, one which has plagued humanity throughout recorded time and which we as a species seem incapable of shifting: that drama is better than comedy. All dramatic work, in any medium, is very significant art deserving of lengthy discussion and financial support. Comedy is its frivolous, indulgent cousin. Drama is a poet capable of plucking emotion from the air and distilling it into an evocative work of beauty, understanding and catharsis with the mere flick of a pen. Comedy is that poet’s drunken sibling who, due to a technicality in their parent’s will, must shamefully receive some minor stipend even though they’ll only spend it on whiskey and end up covered in their own blood and vomit in the basement of the town’s most notorious erotic horse club.\n\nYou might argue that no, comedy is now considered an essential component of every best-selling book, every exploitable film franchise property, every major celebrity’s stage-managed public persona. And while it’s true that we broadly expect some degree of light and shade in our popular entertainment, like Hawkeye saying: ‘Well, I guess that just happened,’ after Iron Man’s touching monologue about his struggles with erectile dysfunction in Avengers: Infinity War, we still inherently ascribe more cultural value and clout to those works which bear the outward appearance of the weighty and dramatic. Muted colours. Actors pulling sad expressions. Lines like: ‘Let me in, Gavin. Why won’t you just let me in.’\n\nWhy does the dark, the grim, the upsetting, carry so much weight? Why do we still view drama as such a noble effort and comedy as such a guilty indulgence? I believe that the reason behind this phenomenon hasn’t changed in five thousand years of recorded history. It’s the same reason that an Ancient Athenian would loudly proclaim how much they had enjoyed last night’s new Euripides play in the agora, but only flick through their All-New Aristophanes Summer Fun Special in the privacy of their own outhouse, giggling like a naughty school child.\n\n(Yes, I did just have to Google which Greek dramatists did tragedies and which did comedies, shut up.)\n\nThe reason is that we feel guilty if we’re enjoying ourselves too much. I think you’d have to be some sort of psychopath or one of those space billionaires not to feel the tug of guilt in response to a sustained period of happiness, of joy, of knee-slapping, gut-busting enjoyment. It’s natural. We’re checking our privilege, we’re keeping the less fortunate in mind, we’re always seeking to improve ourselves and the world around us. We’re more aware than ever of the suffering of others, of the injustices of the world, of the oppression of the marginalised. We’re not going to do anything about it, obviously, but we’re going to make damned well sure that we’re having a much less nice time than we could be, you know, in solidarity.\n\nSo we try to take in books, films, plays and television programmes which we think will enrich us in some way. We eat our broccoli. And if we do end up evangelising for a comedy, we hastily throw in the phrase: ‘Well, actually, it’s more of a comedy-drama’. We apologise for liking something that makes us happy by suggesting that it also made us feel bad at certain points.\n\nI despise this attitude for two main reasons:\n\nFirstly, the notion that enjoyable entertainment is somehow lesser ties into a ubiquitous Thatcherite attitude that unless our time is spent productively, it is worthless.\n\nIn this kinder and more sympathetic age, we are told endlessly that burn-out is real, that we must never neglect our mental wellbeing, that self-care is essential (admittedly sometimes by a person who is trying to sell us a weighted blanket or a mood-altering crystal that you put up your bum, but not exclusively). Is this attitude carried forward into how our critics, our commissioners and our award panels value creativity?\n\nIs it bollocks.\n\nSecondly, this narrative confuses seriousness with solemnity. It promotes the idea that if you’re showing sensitivity to a person or a subject and giving it your full attention, you certainly would never make a joke about it, God forbid. No, if you’re trying to accurately communicate a complex and possibly even sad idea, you do it wearing a cloaked robe in a churchyard while plaintive organ chords yawn forlornly in the background and a loose assortment of ravens sit and caw on nearby bare branches. I think Scrooge is there, but I’m not sure why.\n\nThis second dead horse is the one I’d like to beat a little longer as it’s close to my heart and my line of work. As both a writer and a consumer of Things That Have Been Written, I have always been drawn to the funny first. That’s not to say I don’t also love a huge number of absolutely miserable bastards, though. One of my writer heroes is Nigel Kneale of Quatermass fame, who could certainly write an effective comic beat but was rarely disposed to do so. Going back a few years to 2018*, my favourite film of that year was probably Paul Schrader’s First Reformed, hotly contested by Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, two of the least funny films you could have hoped to see in cinemas at that time, besides Holmes and Watson. These films aren’t what you might call completely po-faced, but they’re focused on punching you in the gut, not tickling your ribs, 95% of the time.**\n\nYet I have always felt, and I don’t think I’m alone, that the more lessons that dramas take from comedies, the better they are as dramas. Whereas comedies can either lean more toward the freeform anarchic or toward the dramatic and not suffer either way. This is the scientific evidence which I present to prove my central argument:\n\nComedy is better than Drama.\n\nAlright, no, that’s simplistic clickbait rubbish which doesn’t stand up under even the merest scrutiny. It is also what I genuinely believe, but that’s by the by.\n\nMy real suggestion here is that as a rule, we tend to assume that comedy, by its very nature, its big-trousered, red-nosed, squirty-flower-squirting nature, is automatically destined to be a less sophisticated and less mature language for telling stories. It is about time that we cut that crap out immediately. I have sat through countless plays, films and television programmes which have tried to make their point that sad things are sad by presenting them in a sad way and as a rule, that is a tremendous and incredibly effective way to make me, Tom Crowley, feel absolutely nothing. Darkness surrounded by darkness is meaningless. The light in the darkness is what shows us how deep the shadows are.\n\n(That sounded clever, didn’t it? But does it actually mean anything? I’m not sure.)\n\nFor an example that makes more sense, let’s go back to our dramatic churchyard with its heavy cloaks and sarcastic crows, and back to Scrooge. See, there was a reason he’s here. Charles Dickens is considered to be one of England’s greatest ever novelists. His books are serious literature, published in prestige editions with muted colour schemes and fonts with serifs for the title. His books also feature puns about gravy and characters with names like Jollyface Hucklebuck and Genuflect Fellatiogarden. There’s a reason that his work lends itself so well to Muppet adaptation. Dickens is a silly little bastard and it makes him a better writer. If we didn’t have daffy old Fezziwig shouting ‘hilly-ho’ at his Christmas party, we wouldn’t feel so racked with sympathetic regret when Ebeneezer lets Belle, and a better life, slip through his fingers. If we didn’t have the everyday glee of the Cratchits playing their little prank on Bob, hiding Martha behind the closet door, then we wouldn’t feel such a powerful plummet back to the little cruelties of life, as Bob’s voice trembles while he describes how well-behaved Tiny Tim was in church.\n\nI’ve chosen a deliberately weighty example there, in A Christmas Carol, but I could have chosen a million more, highbrow or low. Dawn coming back for Tim at the end of The Office. Tony’s repeated pledge: ‘I’d never do that to you, Bren,’ in Dinnerladies. The visit from Pat’s family in Ghosts. Louie in Taxi, pretending to give Latka a dressing-down but secretly wishing him good luck before he leaves. Desmond of Desmond’s, drunk on rum, talking to the photograph of his little plot of land in Guyana. John Candy finally spilling the beans about his wife in Planes, Trains and Automobiles. The Great Dictator. The Apartment. The Tempest. Works which get a far firmer grasp on the heartstrings by first gaining purchase on the funnybone.\n\nDrama works best when it allows a sliver of contrasting light into even its very darkest corners. Comedy is enriched by engaging with the impact and emotion of the maudlin, the macabre, the sad. The two are symbiotic. For a writer, a performer, a director, an editor, learning how to stick the knife in is just as important as learning how to land the pratfall. The difference is that the UK media regulator Ofcom didn’t recently release a report declaring that BBC drama is an endangered species.\n\nComedy and comedians never take well to being put on pedestals. The court jester who’s just shat himself for the amusement of the King doesn’t expect the moment to be put on money. So maybe the value of funny stuff can’t be estimated and celebrated in quite the same way as a symphony. Still, at the very least, it would be nice if those whose whims dictate the direction of money and attention in the arts world could direct them into the dirty, shameful toilet of comedy a little more frequently. Especially the money. Comedy isn’t a solemn business, but it is a serious one. In fact, it’s bloody essential."
