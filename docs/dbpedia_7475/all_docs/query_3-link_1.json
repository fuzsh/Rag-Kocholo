        "text": "1905 short story by O. Henry\n\nThis article is about the short story. For the gifts presented to Jesus, see Gifts of the Magi. For other uses, see The Gift of the Magi (disambiguation).\n\n\"The Gift of the Magi\"Short story by O. HenryText available at WikisourceCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishGenre(s)Short storyPublicationPublished inThe Four MillionPublication typeAnthologyPublisherMcClure, Phillips, and CompanyPublication dateDecember 10, 1905 (newspaper); April 10, 1906 (book)[1]\n\n\"The Gift of the Magi\" is a short story by O. Henry first published in 1905. The story tells of a young husband and wife and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money. As a sentimental story with a moral lesson about gift-giving, it has been popular for adaptation, especially for presentation at Christmas time. The plot and its twist ending are well known; the ending is generally considered an example of cosmic irony. The story was allegedly written at Pete's Tavern[2] on Irving Place in New York City.\n\nThe story was initially published in The New York Sunday World under the title \"Gifts of the Magi\" on December 10, 1905. It was first published in book form in the O. Henry collection The Four Million in April 1906.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Christmas Eve, a woman named Della Dillingham Young discovers that she has only $1.87 (equivalent to about $63 in 2023) to buy a present for her husband James, also known as Jim. Despite being poor, the Dillingham Youngs love each other and possess two items they value as treasures: Della's knee-length brown hair that would depreciate the Queen of Sheba's jewels, and Jim's gold pocket watch, a family heirloom that would make King Solomon envy him. Della dresses warmly and visits the nearby shop of a wig maker, Madame Sofronie, who buys Della's hair for $20 (about $700 in 2023). Della then uses the money to buy a platinum fob chain to go with Jim's watch, which he has attached with a worn leather strap. When Jim comes home from work that evening, Della admits to him that she sold her hair to buy him the chain. Jim gives Della her present, a set of ornamental combs, which she will be unable to use until her hair grows back out. Della gives Jim the watch chain, and he tells her that he sold his watch to buy the combs. While the gifts that Jim and Della gave each other cannot be used, they know how far they went to show each other their love and how invaluable their love truly is. The story ends with the narrator declaring that those who sacrifice their material possessions for the people they love are as wise as the magi.\n\nAdaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sacrifice (1909)\n\nLove's Surprises Are Futile (1916)\n\nThe Gift of the Magi (1917)\n\nUstedes los ricos (\"You, the Rich Ones\") (1948) includes the tale as a small sub-plot\n\nAs a segment of O.

The twins both believe the sacrifice is the greatest gift of all, leaving Angelica in bitter Christmas spirits until she returns the original gifts.\n\nIn 1993, an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 had TV's Frank selling his hair and buying Dr. Forrester a watch fob.

Originally a 2020 virtual show based solely on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol[8] that would receive a live run and recording in 2021,[9] a first act was added in 2023 to adapt Magi in addition to Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Match Girl. All three stories are told with their original details intact, including era-specific price points and items, but are reframed with a 1980s aesthetic. The actors portraying Jim and Della later double as Belle and Young Scrooge; in addition, a previously generic couple shown to Scrooge by the Ghost of Christmas Future is refitted to become Jim and Della celebrating the death of Scrooge and, by extension, their debt. In the epilogue of Christmas Carol, it is revealed that Scrooge is the person Jim sold his watch to. When Scrooge changes his ways, he forgives their debt and returns the watch.[10]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Christmas-themed literature\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
