        "text": "\"Did you know that most filmmakers spend their entire lives making some version of the same movie? And I wonder... are they this alone?\" Mubi has unveiled a trailer for My First Film, a hybrid documentary-narrative feature film made by Zia Anger. It's an autobiographical look at attempting to be a filmmaker, and the trials & tribulations of making movies, especially while young. It premiered at the 2024 CPH:DOX Film Festival earlier this year, and it's set for a streaming releasing on Mubi this fall. A young filmmaker, Vita, revisits her first chaotic attempt at filmmaking 15 years prior. Making a semi-autobiographical film starring her friend Dina, Vita's eager but inexperienced approach causes the production to spiral into chaos, leading to significant disruptions and a near-fatal accident. \"Fact bleeding into fiction, and past, present, and future converging to create a modern myth that redefines the very act of creation.\" Starring Odessa Young and Devon Ross, and plenty of others. This looks interesting, although not that compelling overall, yet another of these \"I couldn't actually make a film so here is a film about me trying to make a film\" films.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ original poster) for Zia Anger's My First Film, direct from Mubi's YouTube:"
