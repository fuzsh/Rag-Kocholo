        "text": "Retiring veteran Lleyton Hewitt has farewelled Perth with one last win after Australia Gold took out the dead mixed doubles rubber at the Hopman Cup this afternoon.\n\nUkraine had already confirmed their place in Saturday’s final with wins in both the women’s and men’s singles, but the Australian pairing of Hewitt and Jarmila Wolfe had one more effort left in them.\n\nThe doubles rubber had to be decided in a match tie-breaker, with Australia Gold eventually emerging victorious 3-6 7-5 10-5 to make it a 2-1 loss in the tie.\n\nSeven’s Summer of Tennis is in full swing and with unparalleled coverage you don’t ever have to miss a point.

I’d never played Alexandr before, he’s a tough guy to really get a read on.\n\n“He plays so many funky shots out there and there was probably only one or two points in it in the end.\n\n“If I was able to break halfway through that third set, and then I had break points to try and get back to 5-5 and then I was up an early set and a break as well so all in all it was a really good hit out.”"
