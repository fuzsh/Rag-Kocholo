        "text": "Australian actress, presenter and singer (born 1983)\n\n\"Bec Cartwright\" redirects here. For her album, see Bec Cartwright (album).\n\nRebecca June Hewitt (née Cartwright; born 23 July 1983) is an Australian actress, presenter and singer. From 1998 to 2005, Hewitt played Hayley Smith Lawson on the soap opera Home and Away. As Bec Cartwright, Hewitt released an eponymous pop music album in 2002. In 2005, she married professional tennis player Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nCartwright began her acting career at age 5 for television commercials. In 1992, she made her mainstream television debut on an episode of Police Rescue.[1] She has also guest starred in Water Rats and Roar.\n\nShe won her breakout role and best-known role to date in 1998, portraying Hayley Smith Lawson on Home and Away. Cartwright became a series fan favourite and earned herself numerous Logie Award nominations until 2005. In the same year, Cartwright earned a Most Popular Actress win.[1] She coincidentally fell pregnant within months of her 'Home and Away' character, and then left the series to become a full-time mother. For a short period of time, Ella Scott Lynch replaced her as Hayley before the character departed the series in the 2005 season finale.\n\nIn 2002, Cartwright signed a recording contract with Warner Music Australia and East West Records. Her debut single \"All Seats Taken\" was released 18 November 2002 and peaked at 10 on the ARIA Music Charts. Her follow-up singles \"On the Borderline\" and \"A Matter of Time\" both failed to match the same success, both charting only the Top 30. Her self-titled debut album was released on 16 June 2003 and, despite high expectations, charted only at 21 and was certified Gold. The album was met with mixed reviews, with Smash Hits giving the album two out of five stars. In 2004, Cartwright ended her partnership with Warner Music.\n\nCartwright was announced as a contestant in the first season of Dancing with the Stars. She and her partner Michael Miziner won the first season on 23 November 2004. The couple returned in an opening performance in a dance routine during the second-season premiere.\n\nShe hosted Abba Mania, which premiered in November 2006 on Nine Network. The special was met with controversy surrounding the fact that the only celebrity performers were Nine Network personalities. Hewitt's performance was met with largely negative reviews.\n\nIn 2018, Hewitt announced her return to television, 13 years since she left Home and Away, with the new Nine Network travel series Helloworld.[2] The series premiered on 7 October with Hewitt hosting in Episode 1 in Queensland – Hamilton Island.[3]\n\nCartwright was born in Sydney on 23 July 1983 the youngest child of Darrel and Michelle Cartwright. She has an older brother and sister.[1] After a four-year relationship with fellow Home and Away co-star Beau Brady, Cartwright and Brady were briefly engaged.[4]\n\nSoon after the end of her engagement, Cartwright began a relationship with tennis player Lleyton Hewitt. On 5 May 2005, the couple announced they were expecting their first child. The pair married on 21 July 2005; the wedding was at the Sydney Opera House, and their reception took place at Taronga Zoo. The event attracted much media attention, with Bec and Lleyton selling exclusive coverage of the day to magazine New Idea.[5] Fellow actresses and friends Ada Nicodemou and Kate Ritchie were bridesmaids. Commemorative stubby holders were given as gifts to all guests.\n\nOn 29 November 2005, Cartwright gave birth to daughter at Sydney's North Shore Private Hospital. Before her birth, a contract was made with women's magazine Woman's Day involving regular diaries from Bec and exclusive photos and interviews of the family for the first two years of Mia's life. The couple attracted much criticism for the observation that they had effectively \"sold\" their daughter to the highest bidder. On 11 December 2008, Hewitt gave birth to a baby boy whom the couple named Cruz Lleyton Hewitt.[6] Their third child, a daughter, was born on 19 October 2010.[7] Her name was announced via a text message subscription service for the cost of $2, a move that attracted much criticism of Bec and Lleyton.\n\nIn February 2009, after revelations about Hewitt's previously unknown offshore income and bank accounts were revealed during a legal battle with his former management company, Octagon Sports Marketing, the couple relocated to a $3.8 million home at the Old Fort Bay estate in Nassau, Bahamas.[8]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1992 Police Rescue Emma Season 2, episode 9 1997 Water Rats School Girl Season 2, episode 8 1997 Roar Young Caitlin Season 1, episode 9 1998–2005 Home and Away Hayley Smith/Lawson Season 11–18 (main role) 2002 Home and Away: Secrets and the City Video special 2002 Carols in Domain Herself TV special 2003 Saturday Disney Herself Season 14 (guest, 1 episode) 2003 The Saturday Show Herself Season 1, episode 101 2004–05, 2021 Dancing with the Stars Herself – contestant Season 1–2, 18 2004 Home and Away: Hearts Divided Herself – host Video special 2004 Carols in Domain Herself TV special 2004 Sn:TV Herself 1 episode 2005 Today Tonight Herself 4 February 2005 2005 Home and Away: Romances Herself Video special 2015 Aegon Championships Herself – Spectator Day 1 2016 Wimbledon Herself – Spectator Day 8, Part 2 2018 Wimbledon Herself – Spectator Day 6, Parts 1 & 2 2018 Endless Summer: 30 Years of Home and Away Herself TV special 2018 Helloworld Herself – presenter Season 1, episode 1 2022 This Is Your Life: Ray Meagher Herself 11 October 2022 TBA Time & Place Kylie TV series TBA 13 Summers Kate Post-production\n\nList of studio albums Title album details Peak chart positions AUS\n\nBec Cartwright\n\nReleased 16 June 2003\n\nLabel: East West Records (2564604002)\n\nFormats: Compact Disc\n\n21\n\nYear Song Peak Positions Certifications Album AUS[9] 2002 \"All Seats Taken\" 10\n\nARIA: Gold[9]\n\nBec Cartwright 2003 \"On the Borderline\" 29 \"A Matter of Time\" 26\n\nYear Award Category Work Result Ref. 2001 Logie Awards Most Popular Actress Home and Away (Season 13) Nominated [10] 2004 Most Popular Actress Home and Away (Season 16) Nominated [11] 2005 Most Popular Actress Home and Away (Season 17) Won [12] Most Popular Personality on Australian Television Nominated [12] 2006 Most Popular Actress Home and Away (Season 18) Nominated [13] Most Popular Personality on Australian Television Nominated [13]\n\nGeneral\n\nHewitts' engagement announcement by Sydney Morning Herald\n\nReports from ABC (Australia) and Reuters[dead link] regarding her marriage to Lleyton\n\nOn the Borderline peak position\n\nSpecific\n\nRebecca Cartwright at IMDb"
