        "text": "AUSTRALIAN OPEN\n\n Davenport survives Molik battle\n\n Wednesday's Results\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- Third seed Lleyton Hewitt held off a late charge by Argentine David Nalbandian to win a drama-packed match 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 and reach his first Australian Open semifinal.\n\nHewitt, who needed treatment for a hip injury after the fourth set, held on grimly to win in four hours and five minutes to wild cheers from a Rod Laver Arena crowd on Australia Day.\n\nHe meets second seed Andy Roddick for a place in the final and said: \"I just had to dig deep in the fifth set, and yet again the never-say-die attitude came out.\"\n\nHewitt becomes the first Australian man to reach the semifinals since Pat Rafter in 2001 and added: \"It's a long way from holding up that trophy yet but I'm hanging in there.\"\n\nHewitt beat Nalbandian in the 2002 Wimbledon final but had never made it past the fourth round at his home grand slam since his first appearance in 1997.\n\nNinth-seeded Nalbandian's game dropped right off in a prickly second set after a series of poor line calls went against him.\n\nFormer world No. 1 Hewitt appeared to brush Nalbandian at one change of ends and had several altercations with officials including the umpire whom he called an idiot.\n\nNalbandian, 23, beaten by Hewitt in the 2002 Wimbledon final, had all the momentum going into the fifth set and although he got within two points of victory three times, Hewitt seized his chance when he broke in the 17th game and served out for victory.\n\n\"We both had chances but I think maybe he was maybe a little bit more lucky than me,\" Nalbandian said.\n\nHewitt's victory kept alive Australian hopes of a local winner in the centenary of their national championship after Alicia Molik lost to Lindsay Davenport earlier in the day.\n\nThe 28-year-old world No. 1 clung on desperately to beat Molik 6-4 4-6 9-7 in a nailbiting finish tinged with controversy after a line judge made an incorrect call on a crucial point.\n\nEasy ride\n\nRoddick enjoyed an easy ride into the last four of the Australian Open as ailing Russian Nikolay Davydenko was forced to retire from the pair's quarterfinal clash.\n\nThe American was leading 6-3 7-5 4-1 when the 26th seed quit with breathing problems in stifling heat on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nRoddick had been forced to save a set point in the second set, but the outcome of the match became a formality as Davydenko's condition deteriorated.\n\nThe Russian, who overcame Tim Henman and Guillermo Canas in earlier rounds, required regular treatment from the trainer and tournament doctor during changeovers and used an inhaler several times during the match.\n\nHe finally quit after one hour and 35 minutes when Roddick broke his serve for the second time in the third set.\n\n\"I think at about three-all in the first set, I felt something. Because we played short points this was ok but then a few points were long and I felt something. I could not breathe,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\n\"The doctor said it was the heat. I will now concentrate on my body, how I am feeling, what I do, and what I need to do later.\"\n\nRoddick last reached the semifinals in 2003, when a five-and-a-half hour quarterfinal against Younes El Aynaoui left him drained for a match in which he was soundly beaten by Rainer Schuettler.\n\n\"The only other time I got this far at the Australian Open I thought I was going to fall over going into my semifinal match,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been pretty smooth sailing so far. I mean, as much so as I've ever had being in this position in a grand slam. That could end up being a good thing. I don't have many miles on me so far this tournament.\"\n\nRoddick said he was prepared to deal with a partisan crowd if Hewitt survived his meeting with Nalbandian, having experienced boisterous Spanish support during the U.S. team's defeat in the Davis Cup final in Seville last month.\n\n\"The way I see that now is that I've been through probably the worst crowd I'll ever be through with what we did in Spain,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sure it will be rowdy. I don't expect anybody to be cheering for me so it's a little bit easier when you know going in what the circumstances might be.\"\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
