        "text": "A is for Arthur Ashe\n\nOne of the most popular players of all time, Ashe sadly passed away in 1993 after contracting the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion.\n\nAshe won three grand slams during his career, including the 1968 US Open, and became the world No 1 that same year.\n\nIn recognition of his immense popularity and sporting achievements, the US Open’s main court, which opened in 1997, was named the Arthur Ashe stadium.\n\nB is for bump\n\nAt the 1997 US Open, the tennis world was properly introduced to the bubbly 17-year-old Venus Williams, who delighted crowds but whose remarkable achievements unsettled many within the sport.\n\nRacial tensions had been bubbling throughout Venus’s run to the final in 1997, and came to the boil in the semi-final when Williams’ Romanian opponent Irina Spirlea appeared to deliberately bump into the American at a change of ends.\n\nSpirlea laughed menacingly after the incident and said after the match, \"she thinks she's the ----ing Venus Williams.”\n\nVenus’s outspoken father Richard was not impressed by what he had seen and called Spirlea a \"big tall white turkey\".\n\n\"I don't want to answer that question,\" she said when asked about her dad’s comments.\n\n\"Are you disagreeing with your father then?\" said a reporter. \"He said that the bumping was a racist incident ... the whole attitude here: racism. Are you disagreeing with that?\"\n\n\"I think with this moment in the first year in Arthur Ashe Stadium, it all represents everyone being together, everyone having a chance to play,\" Venus said. \"So I think this is definitely ruining the mood, these questions about racism...\"\n\nSadly it would not be the last time the Williams sisters had to deal with issues of prejudice and discrimination.\n\nC is for Jimmy Connors\n\nThe brash American Jimmy Connors won five US Opens, but his most memorable run in New York came in 1991 when he reached the semi-final aged 39.\n\nIn 1991, Connors was universally acknowledged to be a busted flush. He was approaching 40 and had thought he would never play again after undergoing wrist surgery in the autumn of 1990.\n\nBut then something quite magical happened.\n\nIn his first round match at the 1991 US Open against Patrick McEnroe, Connors was down 0-3 and 0-40 on his own serve after losing the first two sets, but somehow recovered to win a raucous night match 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 at 1:35 a.m local time.\n\nThe Krickstein match was pure theatre as a pumped-up Connors ranted and raved his way to a 3-6, 7-6, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 win, having trailed 5-2 in the deciding set.\n\nSome of Connors’ more choice outbursts during the match included telling the umpire David Littlefield to: \"Get out of the chair. Get your ass out of the chair! You're a bum! I'm out here playing my butt off at 39 years old and you're doing that?\".\n\nThen in the fifth set Connors screamed at the umpire: \"You are an abortion! Do you know that? ... Get the f***out of there!\".\n\nThe quarter-final against the Dutchman Paul Haarhuis was almost as dramatic, as Connors battled back from a set and a break down to win 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\nThe match featured one of the most extraordinary points in tennis history, as Connors hoisted up four consecutive lobs to somehow keep his man at bay and ultimately win the point.\n\nCue absolute bedlam from Connors and the capacity crowd.\n\nD is for Delpo\n\nJuan Martin del Potro or ‘Delpo’ as he is affectionately known, was a hugely popular champion in 2009.\n\nThe Argentine thrashed Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 in the semi-final, but no-one gave him much of a chance in the final against Roger Federer who had won the previous five US Opens and held three out of the four slams.\n\nDel Potro looked down and out when Federer took a two sets to one lead, but somehow – despite looking on the verge of collapse – the 20-year-old hauled himself back into the match and won an epic five-setter 3-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2.\n\nDel Potro was then at the centre of one of the most unbearably awkward post-match interviews, as the indescribably gauche American TV host Dick Enberg refused Delpo’s request to thank his family in Spanish.\n\nThe exchange in full:\n\nDel Potro: I don't have the words to explain...\n\nEnberg: Well, we have some rewards that will help explain your success! For winning this championship, you earn the winner's prize of $1,600,000! And because Juan Martín was third in the US Open Championship Series that's another $250,000. So $1,850,000 is the answer to your success here in New York!\n\nDel Potro: Can I speak in Spanish?\n\nEnberg: I'm sorry, Juan, we're running out of time here... There's more! In addition to the $1,850,000, a 2010 IS Convertible with a retractable hard-top. To present the keys, Deborah Senior, Lexus corporate manager...\n\nE is for eating\n\nJust like at Wimbledon, eating is a big part of the fan experience at the US Open.\n\nBut instead of strawberries and cream, and luxurious tea and scones, New York serves up an altogether different culinary experience.\n\nGet ready for hot dogs, chilli dogs, curly fries and more - all super-sized for your delectation.\n\nWe’re not in Kansas anymore Toto…\n\nF is for Flushing Meadows\n\nOr to give it its full name Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. Flushing Meadows has been the home of the US Open since since 1978.\n\nThe tennis is actually played at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre, which is part of the 897- acres Flushing Meadows complex. And the Tennis Centre has taken big steps to modernise for this year, with the Arthur Ashe court having a retractable roof ready for the 2016 tournament.\n\nH is for Lleyton Hewitt\n\nThe feisty Aussie is included in this list for his achievements and misdemeanours at the 2001 tournament.\n\n15 years ago, a 20-year-old Hewitt stunned the tennis world with his straight-sets demolition job of Pete Sampras in the final, which secured the Australian his first grand slam title.\n\nEarlier on in the tournament though, Hewitt was at the centre of a race row during a second round match against James Blake.\n\nHewitt won the match in five sets but lost his cool and was accused of racism after being foot faulted and saying: \"Look at him (the linesman) and tell me what the similarity is (beckoning towards Blake). I want him off the court, I've only been foot-faulted at one end. Look at what he's done.\"\n\nI is for injury\n\nInjuries are a part and parcel of any tennis tournament, but few have been as bizarre as the one suffered by Eugenie Bouchard at the 2015 US Open.\n\nThe Canadian sued the USTA after slipping in the locker room on \"a foreign and dangerous substance\" (alleged to be a cleaning product) and suffering concussion that forced her to withdraw from the tournament, and subsequent events.\n\nJ is for Junior winners\n\nBritain has a good recent record of producing young champions at Flushing Meadows – well three in the last 12 years isn’t a bad return. Andy Murray kicked off the run back in 2004 when the then lanky 17-year-old beat Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine. Five years later and Heather Watson became the first British girl to claim the crown in New York before Oliver Golding etched his name into the junior champions’ board in 2011. Murray lays claim to being one of five players to land the juniors and seniors titles (Edberg ’83, Davenport ’92, Roddick ’00 Azarenka ’05 being the others).\n\nL is for Late night finishes\n\nThey call New York the city that ‘never sleeps’ and Flushing Meadows does it’s fair share to help live up to that billing. John Isner, he of Wimbledon marathon-match fame, holds the joint-record of the latest ever finish back in 2012 when he lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber. It was 2.26am when their third-round match concluded coming some 19 years after Mats Wilander beat Mikael Pernfors in the early hours. Wilander was asked post-match: “Ever played so late,” to which he replied: “Played what?”\n\nN is for Ilie Nastase\n\nThe disgraced Romanian etched the template for tennis bad boys back in the day so it was so surprise that his clash with a 19-year-old John McEnroe in 1979 was explosive.\n\nNastase annoyed with McEnroe’s stalling techniques protested in the only way he knows how – by pretending to sleep on the baseline using his racket as a pillow. Nastase was warned about his conduct, given a one-point penalty and then, when he continued to refuse to play, defaulted by the umpire. It wasn’t the end of the chaos. Tournament officials reinstated Nastase, changed the chair umpire and McEnroe went on to record a four-set win.\n\nP is for Flavia Pennetta\n\nThe 2015 women’s champion caused a stir two years ago by announcing her plans to retire from the sport during her post-match celebration speech. The all-Italian final clash with Roberto Vinci was a 10,000-1 pre-tournament shot as Pennetta swept past Petra Kvitova and Simona Halep en route to the final while Vinci disposed of Serena Williams. \"This is the way I would like to say goodbye to tennis,\" she said before hoisting the trophy and accepting the $3.3 m winner's cheque. \"I'm really happy. It's what all the players seem to want to do, to go out with this big trophy.”\n\nQ is for quitters\n\nBy the time the US Open comes around players have spent eight gruelling months on tour and with achy bodies and fatigue setting in coupled with searing heat in New York it's no wonder they start to drop like flies in the final slam of the year. Tow years ago 14 players pulled out of the singles - equalling the Open record for the highest number of retirements during a grand slam.\n\nR is for Renee Richards\n\nWhen Renee stepped onto court to face Virginia Wade at the 1977 US Open she made history in becoming the first player to play in both the men’s and women’s singles. For Renee had 17 years previously made hers, actually his debut there in the men’s draw. In 1975 Richards had a sex-change operation and the Richard H Raskind who competed at the 1960 US Open thereafter became Renee Richards. Despite much controversy over her inclusion in the 1977 championships, she was cleared to take part but she was beaten in straight sets by Wade.\n\nS is for Richard Sears\n\nRichard Dudley Sears, known as Dick, had quite the record at the US Open: the first seven winners of the tournament were Dick Sears, Dick Sears, Dick Sears, Dick Sears, Dick Sears, Dick Sears, and Dick Sears. When he secured his first Title, 1881, he was still a student at Harvard. The US Championships, as it was then called, was contested on the grass courts of the Newport Casino in Rhode Island. In its early years, an All-Comers knockout tournament produced one player who would then take on the defending Champion, which is to say Sears, in a Challenge final match.\n\nIn his first three years, he did not drop a set and, upon winning his seventh Title in 1887, he retired from tennis. He also dominated the men’s doubles, winning six in a row from 1882-1887 with his partner James Dwight. He accomplished all of this wearing Harry Potter glasses, as well, so he must have been some player.\n\nThey called in to ask about the status of the match before them, Miloslav Mecir's v Guy Forget, and set off from Cove Neck.\n\n''We phoned and said we better get out there,'' Fleming told The New York Times, ''but we didn't expect Forget to roll over in the third set.”\n\nAnd then they hit traffic on the Long Island Expressway.\n\n“There were no phones to call from, we just cut it too close. We thought we'd have another 45 minutes before the other match was over,” said Fleming.\n\nBut they were too late: they arrived five minutes after the 15 minute call and were defaulted.\n\nWould Randy Gregson, president of the United States Tennis Association and chairman of the Open make an exception? No. He laid down the stern discipline of rules is rules – not surprising seeing as he had already ousted McEnroe from the US Davis Cup team on account of his “behaviour.”\n\nMcEnroe stormed off, furious, completing a miserable Open for him: he’d already been knocked out of the singles in the first round. And spare a thought for Fleming, who had withdrawn from the singles to better focus on the doubles.\n\nU is for Unseeded\n\nThere are few more inspiring and romantic stories in tennis than an unseeded player winning a slam. Andre Agassi managed it in Flushing in 1994, becoming the first unseeded King of New York of the Open era. Only two other unseeded men have reached the final since, Britain’s own Greg Rusedski and Mark Philippoussis, both in the era when big beasts roamed the earth sending down thunderous serves and not a lot else. Both of them lost to Pat Rafter.\n\nFor women, the 2009 achievement of Kim Clijsters stands out as one of the most remarkable comebacks in tennis. The Belgian had retired in 2007 due to injury and had a baby in 2008. A 2008 exhibition match to mark the unveiling of the Wimbledon roof, however, lit a fire under her and Clijsters decided to return to the game. She accepted wildcards to the 2009 Cincinnati Masters, reaching the quarters, and the Canada Masters, where she got to the third round. A wildcard to the US Open looked little more than a curiosity, but she had an inspired run.\n\nHer scalps included future John Inverdale pal Marion Bartoli and fellow Belgian compatriot Kirsten Flipkens on her way to a fourth round date with Venus Williams. She upset the then world number three 6–0, 0–6, 6–4 and then beat Li Na in straight sets. This gave her a match against Serena Williams, who was given a point penalty on match point due to a foot-fault controversy. Clijsters’s victory made her the first wildcard ever to reach the final, and Caroline Wozniacki had no answer in the final.\n\nW is for Williams Sisters\n\nWhen the gangly Venus became the first unseeded woman of the Open era to reach the US Open final, we knew we were seeing a huge talent. But who can have predicted not only how great Venus would become, but that she would be eclipsed by her kid sister? Serena herself is older than the combined ages of Venus, and her conqueror that day Martina Hingis, were in the 1997 final. The longevity of Venus has been incredible, she has only missed two of the last 19 US Opens and has won twice.\n\nVenus’s second US Open title (2001) saw her beat one S Williams in the final: remarkably, this was the first of five occasions that the sisters have duked it out on the hard courts of Flushing. Serena won the next final (2002) as Venus’s serve crumbled. Their so-called rivals were breathing sighs of relief in 2005 when the sisters were drawn together as early as the fourth round, Serena winning. And in 2008, they treated Queens to a close quarter-final: Serena beat Venus 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (9-7) with Venus having break chances in the first set. The 2015 quarter final was a more authoritative affair from Serena but it took something out of her, she lost the semi-final to tank the calendar slam bid.\n\nIn a move of sensational hypocrisy, John McEnroe called for her to be suspended.\n\nY is for Youngest\n\nThey say if you’re good enough, you’re old enough, and that’s never been more true than at Flushing Meadow, which has crowned some champions barely out of short pants. Actually, they are still IN short pants. But you know what we mean.\n\nPistol Pete Sampras is the youngest male winner, at 19 years and 28 days. And what a win it was. The young man from Maryland did it in the hardest way you can imagine: he had to face the mighty Ivan Lendl in the quarter-final, winning in five sets. Seeing as Ivan had reached the last eight finals, this was no small beer. He beat local legend John McEnroe in the semis and then Andre Agassi in the final. It was their third meeting, and their first in slams, and would become the great rivalry of the age."
