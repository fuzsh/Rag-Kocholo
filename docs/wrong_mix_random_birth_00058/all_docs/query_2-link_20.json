        "text": "Lleyton and Bec Hewitt buy home in Bahamas Location is a well-known tax haven Pictures: Bec and Leyton Hewitt\n\nLLEYTON Hewitt has set up an overseas base in the Bahamas.\n\nThe former world No. 1 and his wife Bec secretly bought a property on the Atlantic Ocean tax haven in February.\n\nThe couple made the decision to set up home in the Bahamas because of its climate, lifestyle and proximity to the US - where Hewitt plays a large number of tournaments, the Herald Sun reports.\n\nIt is believed few, if any, of Hewitt's neighbours are aware the Wimbledon and US Open winner spends time there.\n\nHewitt, 28, was last night due to face friend and regular golf partner Rafael Nadal, the current world No. 1, in the third round of the French Open.\n\nHewitt, who owns properties in his home town Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney, has long resisted advice to establish an overseas base.\n\nBut a desire to prolong his career by cutting back on long-haul flights to and from Australia prompted a change of mind.\n\nThe move paid almost immediate dividends when Hewitt won the US Clay Court Championship in Houston in April, his first title since 2007. Sources said the Hewitts and their two young children are enjoying the privacy of the Bahamas.\n\nThe couple complained of being hounded by photographers in the US in March.\n\nThe situation came to a head when New Idea ran a story and picture spread about \"Bec's other man\".\n\nThe story claimed she was spending more time with a \"hunky\" American fitness trainer the magazine dubbed \"Minder Mark\".\n\nThe man was Bec's brother, Shaun Cartwright.\n\nHewitt is the latest in a long line of Australian tennis players and golfers to live offshore.\n\nPat Rafter was based in Bermuda for much of his career - and was criticised on becoming Australian of the Year, as Bermuda is a tax haven.\n\nTennis pros pay tax in the country where they earn prizemoney and also to the Australian Tax Office.\n\nPat Cash (London), Mark Philippoussis (US) and several others lived abroad."
