        "text": "Former Home And Away actress Bec Hewitt has made a rare public appearance to soak up the sun at one of Sydney’s favourite beaches.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who is married tennis star Lleyton Hewitt, was spotted walking on the sand at Watson’s Bay, in Sydney’s eastern suburbs on Thursday.\n\nBec wore a maroon Adidas cap, black singlet and a pair of distressed light blue denim shorts.\n\nShe completed the look with no makeup an a pair of thongs.\n\nThe formerly Melbourne-based actress was carrying a towel and another hat in her hand before she chose a spot to settle on the beach.\n\nThe mother-of-three was later seen wearing a black swimsuit as she laid on the sand on a towel.\n\nHer bikini top appeared to have adjustable straps as the top was a bandeau style at one stage – but had visible straps when worn under her top.\n\nBec and husband Lleyton reportedly relocated to Sydney last year after selling their mansion in Toorak, Melbourne, for a reported $16 million.\n\nThey appear to have settled into life in their new Rose Bay home and are regularly seen walking their dogs.\n\nRecently she has been filming in Hervey Bay on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast for a role in the new Aussie thriller, 13 Summers, after previously sidelining her acting career to concentrate on her family, Woman’s Day reported.\n\n“My character is a real estate agent,” she said.\n\n“I don’t want to give too much away. It’s a very minimal cast, which is something you don’t see every day but that’s because it’s set mainly in this location.\n\n“I love it! The crew is so lovely. I’m having a really good experience.”\n\nBec and Lleyton tied the knot in 2005 and have three children together.\n\nAfter exchanging vows at the Sydney Opera House, the pair relocated to the Bahamas before moving back to Melbourne.\n\nThen family moved back to Sydney in May 2022."
