        "text": "Germany had an amazing junior team with Molleker and Kuhn but Nicola decided he wanted to play for Spain (he was living here since he was 3). Kuhn was inside top 200 but he had and injury in a toe who let him out of the courts for two months. Unfortunately for him that period was when he had some of his best results last year and now he is near 350. Fortunately for him he doesn't have that much to defend (unfortunately for him his form seems to be not that great right now)\n\nHe's apparently also friends with princes William and Harry. Serena of course is good friends with Meghan Markle.\n\nfrom his wiki:\n\nAlexander Gilkes (born 16 July 1979) is the co-founder and president of Paddle8, an online auction house specializing in fine art and collectibles, described by FT as \"reimagined art collecting for the digital age.\"[1][2][3][4][5]\n\nRaised in London and educated at Eton College and at the University of Bristol, Gilkes has been based in New York since 2008.[6] Prior to founding Paddle8 in 2011, Gilkes served as an auctioneer at Phillips de Pury & Company and an executive at LVMH.[7][8][9]\n\nGilkes has served as auctioneer for many high-profile auctions including Madonna’s Raising Malawi,[10] Elton John AIDS Foundation[11] and amFAR.[12]\n\nGilkes has been named as one of Fast Company's Most Creative Entrepreneurs in 2017,[13] the 100 Most Powerful People in the Art World (Art + Auction) in 2014, 2015 and 2016, a Digital Maverick (DETAILS), one of the 40 Most Important People Under 40 (Apollo), and was featured on Vanity Fair and GQ's best-dressed lists.[14] He serves on the board of the New York Academy of Art.[15]\n\nTennis becoming more athletic has been for quite a while, which made it harder for young players to be successful and to be good at grand slams, in men's. You shouldn't do a lot of gym practice when you are still growing up, Zverev can overcome his problems in Slams by doing more gym practice, getting more athletic and muscles, they waited with him for that, then he will be better there; Eastern Europeans tend to have a very good athletic education, and his parents and other people in his environment know a lot about athleticism and educating athletes.\n\nFederer was injured at the US Open last year. I could tell his movement was affected. So, it could be pulling out of the Rogers Cup is wise. I had a feeling, though, that Federer wasn't going to win Wimbledon this year, and I have the same feeling for the US Open. I think he may make it to the later rounds, but I don't see him winning it. On form this year, I see it as being between Djokovic and Nadal. Nadal could go out earlier than expected, too, but if he gets the gift draws he's been getting in Slams this year, at least through to the quarters, he should get to the later rounds.\n\nDjokovic should try to get as high a seeding as possible. He has no points to defend, so if he does well in the warm ups, he could be Top 5 (maybe even as high as 4?). If he's not that high, neither Federer nor Nadal wants to see him in his side of the draw. I guess that's true of the semis as well.\n\nZverev is interesting. He really struggles in the best of 5 format. Only time will tell if he can overcome that.\n\nI don't think anyone with an open mind for debate and intelligent discourse begrudges others their right to opine and expound, R165. However, what seems to have increased exponentially is the degree of invective and ignorant deflection that has supplanted reason and substantiation. Trolls occupy that realm of unsubstantiated invective and deflection, regardless of where the trolls' opinions are on the political spectrum. I doubt that anyone with the ability to reason believes that trolldom is the exclusive domain of the right wing, no matter how well the Trumpsters have developed their occupation within that domain.\n\nEven so, has anyone ever heard consistently intelligent, well-reasoned commentary from Isner or Querrey or Sandgren outside of their analysis of their serve, backhands, etc.? Or outside of the US, from Stakhovsky or any of the other infamous homophobes?\n\nR162: That would depend of the player. A cute player with potential to be a top player would receive tons of sponsorship, at least at the beginning then if you don't fullfill the potential things will change (Genie Bouchard knows a lot about that).\n\nAnyway, i think a gay player with potential to be a top player will live in the glass closet till he feels comfortable enough of his career. I doubt any player will come out very young, unless of course they were openly gay before reaching the circuit.\n\nThat's more and more common with singers and actors, but i doubt it'll be that common with athletes, and tennis seems quite conservative\n\n[quote]Cute blonde girls rule! Melanie Oudin who inexplicably is a 'journalist' now rode the wave of that 2009 US qf for years, even though her career win loss record was bad bad bad. She used to get tons of w/c's for her looks alone.\n\nImagine my surprise at coming to the defense of Oudin! She was never a wild card hog. She was a Top 100 player when she made that QF run at the '09 US Open, so she was getting direct entry into the lower WTA events. She continued to get direct entry based on her ranking, which was Top 100 in '09, '10, and '12. When her ranking dropped into the 100-200 range, she moved back down to the ITF events and Grand Slam qualifying.\n\nI remember watching her at the 2009 US, thinking to myself \"Enjoy the ride, Melanie, because this is a one-time occurrence.\" She was a scrapper, but nothing in her game stood out. And she was always going to be troubled by her size. While I was never a huge fan, she earned my respect by not acting as though she deserved more. She was more than willing to drop down to the minor events when her ranking dipped, and never once bitched about it. She really did have a great attitude.\n\nI saw he commentating on World Team Tennis last night and she looks about twice the size she used to be.\n\n[quote]I doubt that anyone with the ability to reason believes that trolldom is the exclusive domain of the right wing, no matter how well the Trumpsters have developed their occupation within that domain.\n\nI agree with your sentiment, and probably shouldn't have implied all trolls are from the right wing. When I mentioned how we've become delicate, i was really thinking about the need for people to FF posts here, or whatever activities have gotten ESL banned or red-tagged, or whatever the proper terminology is. It's all so ridiculous to me. If you disagree with someone, I see three courses of action: (1) try to engage in meaningful debate; (2) ignore them; or (3) start to name-call and flame. I choose the first option 1-2% of the time, the second option 98-99% of the time, and the third option 0%.\n\nR195: But Coetzer has more wins against Graf than any player of her level, and even when she was not able to defeat her she was able to give Graf a good fight.\n\nOn the other hand she had tons of trouble against Conchita Martinez, and she needed Conchita being injured to defeat her for the first time.\n\nIt's difficult to find a real nemesis for Graf (apart of Seles at her prime), she was a very dominant player and most of her rivals (even the ones who were able to did that at big matches) had a very negative h2h against her\n\nR206: Graf really didn't have time to fear the Williams sisters. She was a pale shadow of herself in 1999. And with the sisters (like with Monica) at least she had the advantage of a surface, Graf was better on clay than Venus and Serena (like she was better than Seles on grass). I suppose she could sense the potential of the sisters, her two matches against Serena were very interesting even when both were very far from their peaks (even with that both won a GS that year). It's curious because i thought the years when both Williams dominated the circuit were a lot more. After three years Venus became a threat only at Wimbledon, and Serena alternate periods of domination with periods when she only appeared from time to time to win another GS. Probably her longer period of domination was when she was more than 30\n\nI forgot Navratilova, who was a dangerous rival till the day she retired. I remember ASV saying how difficult it was for her play against Martina\n\n[quote][R180] are u serious? Mel whined about drawing Francessa Schiavonne in the 1st rd of the French - after having beaten her in Fed Cup the year before - saying it was 'unfair'. As for wild cards she was the queen - at the Family Circle Cup and the former Memphis tournament. She also enjoyed the comforts of the USTA Training Center when she's already been a pro for many years. Many more deserving gals (Taylor Townsend for one) deserved half the attention the little blonde ball got.\n\nOudin got one wild card into the main draw of Family Circle Cup/Charleston (2014) and two wild cards into Memphis main draw (2009, 2012). That doesn't seem excessive to me.\n\nI can't find her calling her 2011 French Open draw as unfair, although she does say \"Basically, I pretty much got a clay court lesson.\"\n\nAs far as her use of the USTA Tennis Center, that isn't unusual. They regularly open their Center up to American pros: Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe both trained at the USTA center before the 2017 Australian Open.\n\nWawrinka's forehand was a liability tonight, it was like how it used to be in his pre-slam days. His grip is just so unorthodox that players can rush him on that side and his timing goes off.\n\nYoung was smart to hit the ball high on Wawrinka's 1 handed backhand as we've seen Nadal do to Federer when he used to beat him. It was an entertaining match but the quality was up and down.\n\nPaire-what a bitch! He broke a few rackets in his loss today to Baghdatis and tanked match point. The jerk even threw his broken rackets in the middle of the court for ball kids to pick up. Not sure why some on DL love him so much\n\nR218: Graf was incredibly far from her peak in 1999 after two very bad years. In fact she retired soon after her Wimbledon final due to her back problems.\n\nAnd Graf didn't fear the Williams at all, one think is saying a compliment (and Venus was pretty good in 99 specially on grass) and other really fear them. In fact in 99 Serena seemed very far from being a threat at the big titles till she surprises everyone winning the US Open. Everybody expected Venus (who was the best player back then and it would be the best player for a couple of more years) to win GS first.\n\nI don't doubt the Williams would dominate the early 00's but they had quite easy access to the top because by them the 90's champions weren't even a shadow of their former self, and Hingis ended being a head case in bad form. Capriati and Davenport became their main threats (and Davenport always was pretty inconsistent, she was smashing Serena in their Australian open final, till she was out of gas in the middle of second set and tanked big time).\n\nIf not injured Graf had at least a couple of good years ahead of her, and she had enough game and experience to cause trouble. Because one of the things that Serena benefited through her career is to be mentally tougher than any other player, while on the 90's there were a good bunch of really strong mentally players\n\nI think players are behaving worse and worse in the young cathegories. I was searching for some information about a U12 spanish player and i found a video of her match today against a russian player (it was a girls tournament of the european u12) and the russian player was eliminated after two warnings. She was trying to tell what balls were out and in (like Nefedova did in the Eddie Herr a bunch of years ago) cheating big time, they called one referee (sorry i don't know the name in english) but she didn't react well, and end the match trowing a bottle of water against her rival.\n\nGiven her results she should be used to lose (because she doesn't seem very good) but i find incredible that kind of behaviour at such young age. Kyrgios is a saint compared to that little bitch\n\nR261: She better correct that as soon as possible, Halep and Petkovic are fighters, if players who don't surrender realize that Sloane sooner or later gave up even when she is winning and dominating the match she is going to have a lot of trouble.\n\nRG lost had to hurt because she was really dominating that match, Halep was helpess even when she was not playing bad. Sometimes that kind of loss is a problem, Medvedev never recovered from the loss against Agassi (and he was dominating the match with iron fist). Of course he break up with Huber after that and Anke gave him stability during their relationship so it's no surprise that he tanked after that (Medvedev was a player who seemed destined to win RG but he never fullfill his promising start)\n\nR310: Exactly, like in the USA in Spain tennis is a posh sport (not that much that it was in the past because Manolo Santana made it very popular). Lopez case is very similar. He had a divorce that it was in the media all the time (his wife was a model who was discovered in a reality show and she likes to go to tv to tell everything) she hinted that maybe he was gay and he said he recieved tons of proposals from gay fans and he was very happy to know he has so many options.\n\nOther unexpected gay friendly player is Nico Almagro\n\nI agree, R303. Once a player goes after a linesperson or chair umpire with so much anger, I have trouble seeing past that. It's one thing that prevented me from ever rooting for Agassi and Roddick, who I felt would use their positions as highly ranked players to bully and intimidate. There was one year at the US Open where there was some problem with water coming up on one of the show courts that Roddick was supposed to play on, and he started to boss around the tournament director about moving his match to another court. He had no consideration for the scheduling, the security, the fans, the tv contracts, etc. He just demanded that his match be moved to another court and packed up his bags to \"take charge\".\n\nInsufferable prick. The media used to just kiss his ass all the time, which didn't help.\n\nThe wta is not interesting right now.\n\nI always was more interested in women's tennis maybe because i became a fan with ASV at the end of the 80's. But right now there's absolutely nothing attractive on the wta, you have a lengend playing very bad, a bunch of top players who are totally unconsistent and no exciting new player on the horizon.\n\nOn the atp you have three living lengends playing well, top players like Wawrinka and Murray trying to coming back and a good bunch of young players trying to rise on the rankings.\n\nVandeweghe's ranking is about to drop like a stone if she doesn't start winning soon.\n\nI think the WTA is having a bounce back year with top players reaching the Slam finals. I think what the tour needs to continue an upward trajectory is (1) consistency from the top players, so they play each other more often and develop rivalries; (2) top players as ambassadors of the sport (more on that in a minute), and (3) better management and marketing - by playing so many combined events, the women are rarely in the spotlight, and by allowing on-court coaching, it makes it appear as though women can't win unless a man helps her.\n\nPart of the problem on the women's side is that the top players don't want to talk to the media and market the sport. Someone like Wozniacki has perfected giving non-answers in interviews. Stephens gives clipped responses to most interviews, and rarely provides thought or insight. Muguruza has made it known she wants as little to do with the media as possible. I think Halep and Kerber try, but both seem so shy that it's difficult to get them to open up. Look what happened to the LPGA when the top golfers became Koreans with little ability to promote the sport in English. What was making headlines 20 years ago for Annika Sorenstam at number one, Michelle Wie coming up and daring to play with the men, etc, now gets little if any press, and has all but disappeared from the sports landscape. Quick - name a Top Ten LPGA golfer! If you can, you're in the minority. The sports need their stars.\n\nThe ATP won't be truly interesting again until the young guys start winning slams. We've started to see new masters winners which is progress but not good enough.\n\nI also think in a couple years the ATP will have a lot of random winners and up-and-down players too. They're really holding onto Federer, Nadal and Djokovic but they won't last forever.\n\nKeys didn't want to pull out of San Jose as she was defending her Stanford title from last year. She's just injured a lot like Muguruza which causes players to lose momentum.\n\nI somewhat agree, R349. It would certainly make it more interesting if the younger players were in the mix and winning a Slam or two. Thiem finally got to the final of the French, but A. Zverev (fuck off, which Zverev troll), Kyrgios, Dimitrov, Coric, Shapavalov, etc., can't seem either to get to the semis or finals of Slams or only do it on rare occasions (Dimitrov twice). Coric and Shapavalov are still a bit young, but the others are just not consistent.\n\nYou see the same thing on the WTA. All the way through Graf, and as much as it pains me to say because I hate her, even Hingis, there was sustained excellence from the top players getting to later rounds and winning Slams. The rivalries were fun to watch. The Williams sisters were the first to be very up and down. Henin was pretty consistent, but struggled with injuries and illness a couple seasons. When Serena is healthy and focused, though, she is always the favorite. I'd love to see that sustained quality again, but maybe the power game is not made for that?\n\nR358: Surprisingly Roger Federer didn't reach any final (or semis) by the age that A Zverev has now. It's true that he had two qtr and two 4th rounds wich is better than what Zverev has achieved. I think he even talked to Zverev after Australian debacle because he though he was very sad after losing with Chung and he told him he was in a very similar position back in the day.\n\nFederer seems to be fond of Zverev and Kyrgios maybe because they remind him of himself at the beginning of his career (when everybody though he was incredibly talented but he was bound to waste his talent).\n\nIn my opinion the change in the domination of the atp will be out of the blue, one day you have the big four, and the next they will be the underdogs. In fact the changes in domination between Roger, Rafa and Nole were a bit unexpected, Roger was expected to win the whole GS (Nadal was always a burden at RG) and suddenly it was Rafa the one who had options, and Nole seemed destined to be the third wheel but he won the Davis cup and started to dominate after that.\n\nIf the new players are able to really challenge the domination we'll get a very interesting situation like in the wta by the end of the 90's with a lot of new players wanting the throne but the veterans resisting to give them room\n\nI don't think Tennis Channel has rights to WTA Washington; I think it's only on WTA TV. (Correct me if i'm wrong...)\n\nMurray will never return to Washington. He's livid. And while I agree 3am is a ridiculous end time for a match, (1) it was a 3+ hour long match; (2) there were weather delays; and (3) Washington has ALWAYS had late start times. But I don't know why they didn't suspend the match after the first set or something.\n\nI think Murray's career is over. He could play 3 sets but has a total mental collapse at the end sobbing? I like him, and was looking forward to his tortured style of playing but I think this is the end folks and that is what it was all about. There is no way he could play a 5 setter and then get his ass back up again to play another.\n\nThe DC tournament is usually hotter than hell so they play matches later which is kind of funny seeing the hottest part of the day is at 6pm in the summer time.\n\nThese pussy players. Chris Evert played a late night semi vs. Marita Redondo at the Slims San Fran event in 1976. She came back from 1-5 down in the third and won 6-7 7-6 7-6, then played a midnight doubles match that didn't end until 1pm. She got up the next day and played the singles final at 11amSan Fran time to meet a CBS broadcast EST time of 2pm.She won the final- 7-5 7-6 against Goolagong on her least fave surface of indoor carpet. She never bitched once or complained of an injury to pull out. She never had a ball kid hand her a towel either. Fuck these assholes who play today and act like prima donnas.\n\nWhat the fuck do assholes know about tennis in 1976? Evert played hard hitting Marita Redondo who had a huge forehand. The next day she had to play her top rival Goolagong who was at peak form that year. Sports Illustrated who chose Evert as Athlete of the Year for 76 cited those matches, the quick turnaround to point out her professionalism and dedication to her sport. You fuckers are not going to tell me the pampered, over paid and everything done for them 'stars' of today can't train properly. They don't even play every week. They are entitled mental midgets who do little if nothing for their tour and livelihood. If you like just bashing baseline tennis then today's tennis is for you.\n\nI think people is really harsh with Murray. He came from a very long injury, he is having trouble in coming back to the circuit, in my opinion he is in a situation where he fears getting injured again and not being able to be the great player he was. Murray always was emotional wich in my opinion it was a burden, he has a quite close h2h against the big three but on GS he was losing to them most of the time.\n\nAnyway as person he is the most inteligent and interesting of the four by far\n\nThe San Jose semifinalists:\n\nBuzarnescu won big on the Challenger circuit, then last fall, qualified and reached the semifinals of Linz Austria. In 2018, she reached the finals of Hobart and Prague, but it was the French Open where she broke out, beating the No. 4 seed Svitolina en route to the 4R.\n\nMertens is known best for her run to the Semis of the Australian, and has won multiple smaller events 'this year.\n\nCollins first break through was Indian Wells (4R) and Miami (SF) where she beat Venus en route.\n\nSakkari qualified and reached the semis of Wuhan (Tier 1) last fall.\n\nR441: De Miñaur is a non annoying version of his mentor Lleyton Hewitt. He has a solid backhand and a solid forehand and good serve, and very good return to serve and he is fast and with a good mentality. None of his shots make the difference, he is not a player who can bully rivals with his power, but he had enough positive things in his game to make his transition from junior to pro very easy and he has a promising future.\n\nI'm sure spanish federation is regreting not helping him when he was younger\n\nR449; He'll be lucky (in fact any of the next gen players) if he follows Martina footsteps.\n\nMartina downfall was a combination of bad athleticism and being a head case. Yes, there were a lot of big hitters coming for her throne but she made everything easier starting half sleeping all her finals in the new millenium. She was able to defeat one, or even two big hitters at GS but when she had to face the third she was out of gas.\n\nWith better fitness and stronger mentality her game was competitive (of course an improvement on her serve was needed because that serve was an invitation to players like Serena to make winner after winner).\n\nI think a fair comparission to De Miñaur could be Hewitt, and if he follows his steps an he is precoucious he could benefit of the fact that most next gen player are still green (and the veterans are going to fade sooner or later).\n\nAnyway a winning mentality is the key, without people like Djokovic, Nadal and Federer blocking the access to GS the players who are mentally competitive and solid in their game will have their chances. It's probable that there were a lot of different winner for some years when the big three decline unless someone became dominant really fast wich doesn't seem that easy right now\n\nAttendance for the CT Open was 50k for the week. It had 78k back in 2009, and 100k in 2005. Granted, you also had the men's event, plus true \"star\" players that could sell tickets back in the early 00s, when players like Venus, Seles, Davenport, Hingis and Capriati would play.\n\nBut it makes me wonder how the event - and others like it - will survive. No discredit to Sabalenka, a rising talent, and Suarez Navarro, who's been ranked as high as No. 6... but they're not selling tickets. They're not bringing fans or tv viewers in. Specific to New Haven, the tournament director does a lot to keep the event entertaining. She pulls in sponsors and vendors (like a craft beer tent, or ladies fashion show), and tries to pitch those aspects along with the tennis. She pulls in big name vets (McEnroe, Navratilova, Davenport, CT native James Blake, Tommy Haas, etc.) to play exhibitions after the night match. I shudder to think what the attendance numbers would look like without those attractions.\n\nAs a longtime fan of the sport, I've moved into the \"acceptance\" stage where tennis is just going to become a niche sport, and no longer mainstream like football, basketball, golf. It rarely gets press in the sports page, or on Sports Center. Even on the Sports Illustrated website, it doesn't get its own banner tab, you have to go into the \"other sports\" tab to get to the main tennis page.\n\nWhen I first started watching as a kid in the 70s/80s, tennis was HUGE: Borg, McEnroe, Connors, Vilas, Evert, Navratilova, Austin, King. Headlined by players who were known beyond the tennis circles. Now, no casual sports fan knows a thing about tennis other than Federer, Nadal, and Venus and Serena... all of whom are likely to be gone in the next couple of years.\n\nWomen's tennis is in a slump. There's no real top players (no matter how good you are if you are not able to play well for more than two weeks), zero charisma and no new young rising stars.\n\nEven without the big three men's tennis is a way more interesting right now with a lot of new players rising in the rankings.\n\nAtp right now could be la wta in 1999, with a good fight between veterans and rising stars. The only danger is that new players are not really able to rise the level and dethrone veterans in the next years, because if they reach the top just because the big three get too old or retired it won't be good for the game\n\n[quote]Actually, [R546] the women's ratings are bigger than the men's. Statistic. The only men's matches that are being filled are the matches with the top 4. Consistently the women are filling stadiums for all matches. If the men's were doing so great, there would be no need for Davis Cup format changes.\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to, or where you're getting your statistics. The Connecticut Open stadium has been less the half filled for the Women's final for the last two years (attendance of 5000 or less in a stadium that holds 12,000). Additionally, as I pointed out above, total attendance for the event is at 50% of what it was drawing 10-12 years ago. If that's not a troubling statistic, I don't know what is.\n\nI don't see anyone suggesting that Venus or Serena are not huge stars and ratings-grabbers. But what is troubling is what Tennis has to offer once the biggest names (Venus, Serena, Sharapova, Federer, Nadal) are gone. Lower attendance, no ratings, no buzz around the sport within mainstream sports press. The sport is staring a crisis in the mouth, and the tennis press is largely ignoring it.\n\nI think the women catch more flak because they're closer to the precipice. Venus will be lucky to be Top 50 at the end of the year, Sharapova has not had a successful comeback from her doping ban, and while I believe in Serena's ability to comeback, she's very near the end. Also, the men seem better positioned with possible star players. For whatever reason, among the young players, Zverev, Tsitsipas, Shapavalov generate more interest than Halep, Svitolina, Ostapenko. Although, I do think Stephens has the ability to be a big star if she would stop being so surly and churlish with the media.\n\nR549: Tennis is a global sport and right now there are way more interest in men's than in the women's circuit.\n\nMaybe in the USA a final with Serena can get impressive rankings, but in other countries the men's final had way more impact.\n\nAnd you can make Serena carry the torch much longer. The problem is there's no replacement in women's tennis, no new stars, no current consistent top players, no big personalities, nothing.\n\nOf course if the big three retire and the youngers didn't replace them by then, atp will be in great trouble too, but they had a good bunch of prospects and that's way more than what wta has\n\nI'm sure no one has been following but this week a big Chicago combined challenger debuted. A lot of names we recognize entered on both the ATP & WTA side. DL favorites Bouchard and Pospisil both lost in the first round.\n\nThe draws for WTA Quebec City and Hiroshima are also out. Bouchard is skipping her home province for Hiroshima which obviously means she's planning on playing the full Asian swing. Sabalenka is the top seed in Quebec City and is obviously the overwhelming favorite.\n\nThe men will have Davis Cup next weekend so no pro events this week\n\noh please that's a bunch of shit if the story is in fact true. So Jimmy Connors saying to an umpire \"you are an abortion!\" was OK. You don't hear umpires complaining about DJokovic even though he once pushed an umpire's arm. Or saying they won't officiate Kyrgios, Paire and Fognini matches. There are countless other examples.\n\nRamos inserted himself needlessly into the final and most former players agree it was wrong. Did Serena overreact somewhat? yes but Ramos did not come out of that match looking good\n\nI don't want to watch a tennis match where one player is unfairly advantaged over the other through cheating anymore than I want to watch doped up Russian athletes sweep the track & field medals at an Olympic games. Serena was being coached from the stands, I don't care whether she agrees or disagrees about receiving the coaching.\n\nLikewise it has been the case where Olympic athletes had no idea that their team was providing them with illegal PED's, and frankly I don't care, the crew can go down with the captain in that case.\n\nIt also is a big deal that Sascha was not called for blatantly coaching Osaka.\n\nand I say \"needlessly\" because yes the racket breaking is an automatic warning. The warning about coaching especially if Serena wasn't even looking at Patrick is very questionable. He could have issued a soft warning as many commentators have said. It's also questionable to count being called a thief as so offensive he must add another penalty. We've seen so many worse examples and little or nothing happened. Ramos did interfere and unevenly so against Serena. Most players do not think Ramos was right with his umpiring in that match and I happen to agree. I'm not excusing Serena's outburst but it's understandable because she got another shitty call and it offended her. You have the USO thread if you want to keep debating this. No need to go around in circles again.\n\n[quote]overreacted somewhat\n\nr571? You think Serena “overreacted somewhat”?? You’re either a Serena cultist or blind to what happened at that match. She should have curbed her temper. She seemed almost hellbent on creating a scene to justify an inevitable loss or to destabilize her opponent.\n\nHave you ever stopped to think what might have happened had Serena’s insane tantrum led to Osaka eventually losing the match in the third? Because I’m sure that’s what would have happened had Ramos just sat back and smiled and indulged the arch brat as she continued with her tirade.\n\nThat the WTA came out with the statement it did and that Katrina Adams made the statements she did, all in thrall to the most self-centred display of a childish narcissist, is one of the most appalling miscarriages of justice I’ve ever seen in the sport of tennis. And to cynically pull the feminist card is an insult to real feminist causes against bias and injustice in the world and in the world of tennis.\n\nI loved Serena until the infamous match where she threatened to shove e ball down a linesperson’s throat, when I moved onto the fence about her. Saturday’s performance, for me, just completely tarnished her image and her achievements. Much as I loathe Margaret Court, I now hope it’s not Serena who eventually breaks her record, and if she does (and I doubt she won’t) then you Serena stans can celebrate, but without a significant part of the tennis-loving world.\n\nR579\n\n1. Serena DID look at Patrick. She claimed that he gave her a thumbs up, which is a lie since we have video evidence and Patrick himself admitted coaching.\n\n2. Calling the umpire a thief and a liar IS verbal abuse. According to ITF GS rules, 'verbal abuse is defined as a statement about an official, opponent, sponsor, spectator or other person that implies DISHONESTY or is derogatory, insulting or otherwise.'\n\n3. \"We've seen so many worse examples and little or nothing happened.\" WRONG AGAIN. Carlos Ramos gave Andy Murray a code violation because he said 'stupid umpiring'. Last year Fognini was bannes from the USO because he called the umpire a 'whore'. Even McEnroe was defaulted once for verbal abuse.\n\nStop defending Serena and blaming Ramos. Serena lost the plot and any sensible people should be able to see that."
