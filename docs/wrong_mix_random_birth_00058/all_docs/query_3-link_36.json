        "text": "Alex de Minaur has added Alexander Zverev to his growing list of summer giant killings, with the come-from-behind victory netting the Australian a place in the top 10 of the ATP rankings for the first time in his career.\n\nBut Australia’s United Cup campaign ended at Ken Rosewall Arena on Saturday as defeats in the women’s singles and mixed doubles allowed Germany to make the final against Poland with their 2-1 victory.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Alex de Minaur moves into the top 10.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nDe Minaur’s dazzling pre-Australian Open form, though, continued to be the talk of tennis as he triumphed 5-7 6-3 6-4 against world No.6 Zverev.\n\nThe victory over the reigning Olympic champion adds to an impressive week for the Australian No.1, who claimed a drought-breaking win over 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic and thwarted big-hitting American Taylor Fritz.\n\nIt ensured the fervour surrounding de Minaur will only ramp up further ahead of this month’s grand slam in Melbourne.\n\nDe Minaur will enter the tournament as the first Australian men’s player since Lleyton Hewitt in 2006 to be ranked among the world’s top 10.\n\n“It’s what I’ve worked so hard for, it’s another milestone,” de Minaur said.\n\n“But the job’s not done… we keep improving, we keep working - it’s going to be a fun Aussie summer.”\n\nDe Minaur’s win squared the tie after Angelique Kerber had beaten Ajla Tomljanovic 4-6 6-2 7-6 (9-7).\n\nBut Germany claimed the decisive mixed doubles encounter, Zverev and Laura Siegemund requiring a marathon 28-point match tiebreak to eventually edge Matt Ebden and world No.1 Storm Hunter 7-6 (7-2) 6-7 (2-7) [15-13].\n\nZverev loomed as another acid test of de Minaur’s credentials after his wins over Djokovic and Fritz.\n\nThe German boasted a 6-1 head-to-head record against the Australian No.1 prior to Saturday’s meeting and things looked to be going to script when he got a break late in the first set and ground out an assured early lead.\n\nFar from intimidated, de Minaur dug in, the 24-year-old Australian surviving an 11-minute battle to hold serve at 2-2 in the second set before breaking Zverev and squaring the match.\n\nWith his confidence emboldened, de Minaur broke Zverev straight away and held on for victory.\n\n“I got out of jail in the second set and the whole momentum changed and got behind me, I just tried to ride the wave,” de Minaur said.\n\nHis calmness under pressure was in direct contrast to Tomljanovic, who earlier on Saturday had slumped to a loss at the hands of returning three-time grand slam champion Kerber.\n\nThe Australian was in cruise control through the opening set but imploded in the second, eventually recovering to secure a tiebreak in the third.\n\nTomljanovic had two match points, but Kerber kept a cool head and then ruthlessly sealed victory in over two-and-a-half hours.\n\nIt was Kerber’s first win in singles tennis since returning from the birth of her first child.\n\n“Ajla played amazingly and we were both on a high level,” the German said.\n\n“It’s my first singles win since coming back and it’s a great feeling.\n\n“Coming out and having such a tough battle and it means a lot to have a match like this before going to the Australian Open.”"
