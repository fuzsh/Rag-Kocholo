        "text": "Bec and Lleyton could not have looked prouder of their eldest daughter Mia when she graduated with a diploma in fashion in front of family and friends, including Bec’s parents Darrel and Michelle Cartwright, last month.\n\nThe beautiful family reunion to celebrate 17-year-old Mia’s achievement comes after years of torment for Bec, 39, who was separated from her parents because of Lleyton’s globe-trotting tennis career, and marks a new chapter for the Hewitts, who have also mended their rift with the tennis star’s family.\n\n“Bec is so much happier to be back in Sydney and close to her parents. She didn’t like living in Melbourne, and I’m sure her parents were unimpressed when Lleyton insisted they make a home there,” reveals one insider.\n\nThey have also reconnected and grown closer with Lleyton’s little sister Jaslyn, after a family feud erupted when their parents Cherilyn and Glynn didn’t attend Jaslyn’s wedding to Housos star Rob Shehadie in 2010.\n\nThe simmering tensions between Jaslyn and Rob and the rest of the family after their wedding day – which Bec and Lleyton also did not attend, citing overseas commitments at the time – left the entire family fractured.\n\nBut Jaslyn, 40, who has two children and also lives in Sydney, is now closer than ever with Bec and Lleyton, with their children, Mia, Cruz, 14, and Ava, 12, regularly catching up with their aunt and cousins.\n\nHealing the family rift has brought Bec and Lleyton, 42, immense joy as they enjoy their lives back in Sydney.\n\n“Bec has always been close to Darrel and Michelle, and to be able to see them all the time now has made her so happy. There was a lot of tension when they returned to Australia and settled in Melbourne because Bec felt isolated – once again,” reveals one family friend.\n\nThe family relocated to Sydney’s eastern suburbs last year after selling their Toorak mansion for $16 million and now split their time between the harbour city and a palatial $4 million home at Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast.\n\nFormer Home And Away star Bec is rumoured to have also shared a difficult relationship with Cherilyn and Glynn in the early years of her marriage to Lleyton, who proposed to her after dating for just six weeks.\n\n“I know they had some concerns about how rushed it all was, and were worried how Bec would adapt to life on the circuit,” says one tennis insider.\n\nThe close bond Lleyton shared with his parents, who travelled around the world with him during his successful career, attracted criticism from some, including former Aussie Wimbledon champion Ashley Cooper, who described it as “not a healthy situation for him”.\n\nBut they did take a step back to allow the relationship to flourish, and Bec proved to be Lleyton’s biggest supporter.\n\n“Bec has always been the peacemaker in the family – she hates confrontation and tension, and always puts the kids first.” says our insider. “With the family now all back together, she’s never been happier. And the kids have two sets of grandparents who dote on them.\n\n“Their kids are all kicking goals in their own way, and it really is a great time in all of their lives.”"
