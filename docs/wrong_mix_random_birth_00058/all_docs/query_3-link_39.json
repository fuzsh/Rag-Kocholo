        "text": "Fifth-seed Robin Soderling eventually edged out Hewitt in five sets, coming back to win 6-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nBut he only won after Hewitt stunned the Centre Court crowd by diving full length and performing a forward roll to break Swede Soderling towards the end of the second set.\n\n“I don’t know how good the shot was because I didn’t see it,” said Hewitt. “I didn’t even know it was a winner or in until the umpire called the score.”\n\nHewitt, previously at the very top of the rankings, has slumped to 130th in the world after a series of disappointing results before this week.\n\nNevertheless, Soderling paid tribute to his opponent and praised Hewitt for taking him to uncharted territory.\n\n“Of course I knew I was going to win,” he said with a laugh. “It was tough. I have never come back from two sets to love down before in my career.\n\nI have never come back from two sets to love down before in my career\n\nRobin Soderling\n\n“If he’s healthy, Lleyton has a good chance of beating anybody, especially on this surface.”\n\nUnfortunately, that is a big if these days for Hewitt, who admits to wrapping himself in cotton wool between Grand Slams.\n\nAustralian Hewitt said: “I don’t have any idea at the moment if I will have to have a break now. Everyone – my surgeon, my physios, my doctors, whoever – have all just been focusing on trying to get me through here in one piece.”\n\nThat is not to say, though, that Hewitt, 30, is anywhere near contemplating quitting the game.\n\n“As long as my body’s close to 100 per cent, I want to go out there and compete,” he said. “You’re retired for a long time and I still feel I can give these top guys as much trouble as anybody out there.”\n\nIt seems that nobody this year is capable of giving Novak Djokovic much trouble. For the No2 seed, life is not so much tough as “Tufty”.\n\nDjokovic beat South African Kevin Anderson 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 and put his inspiration down to a squirrel that has been visiting his digs.\n\nHe said: “It’s my best friend now in London, the little squirrel. She’s getting closer and closer each day. I’m trying to feed her from my hand. She doesn’t have a name yet, though – I’ll think about that.”\n\nAnd he is just nuts about his visit to the capital – up to a point.\n\n“I’m a big admirer of the nature in London,” he said. “It is one of the nicest cities in the world with all the parks. It’s beautiful.\n\n“If I wasn’t playing tennis I’d walk around and try to spend less time in the car because it’s really annoying with the traffic here. It’s one of the worst cities in the world for traffic.”\n\nRoger Federer also wasted little time in disposing of his second-round opponent, Adrian Mannarino, in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2.‘I want to go out there and compete’"
