        "text": "Hall's explanation came hours after Riser, 36, was arrested on two counts of capital murder. “It took persistence and months of dedication to accomplish, and the people of Dallas are safe because of it,” Hall said. AdThree men were charged with capital murder in the killing of Saenz: Kevin Kidd, 32; Emmanuel Kilpatrick, 34; and Jermon Simmons, 38. Kidd and Simmons are jailed on capital murder charges stemming from the killings of Saenz and the father and son. Instead, the man told investigators that Riser offered to pay him a total of $9,500 to kidnap and kill Douglas and later Saenz, the affidavit says.\n\nAPPOMATTOX COUNTY, Va. – This winter weather could cause power outages across our area. Appalachian Power is concerned about the weekend, but a spokesperson tells 10 News their crews and trucks are ready to go. “Everybody that is an employee or contractor is on alert, which means that they know once they get that notification, they head out,” said Teresa Hall with Appalachian Power. She also says you should have supplies ready at home, including vehicle chargers for your mobile devices, and patience, as it takes crews longer to repair outages because of slippery roads and walkways. Click here for Appalachian Power’s outage map.\n\nLate Thursday, Hall was put to death for abducting and killing the teenager, Lisa Rene. His was the eighth federal execution this year since the Trump administration revived a process that had been used just three times in the past 56 years. A judge’s stay over concerns about the execution drug gave Hall a reprieve, but for less than six hours. Hall was among five men convicted in the abduction and death of Lisa Rene in 1994. Lisa Rene was home, alone.\n\nMARTINSVILLE, Va. – One man is hospitalized after a shooting in a Martinsville home Saturday night. When he was able to get inside the home, Hall demanded that Draper give him rings that belonged to Hall’s mother, authorities say. When Hall tried to get the gun, Draper also grabbed it to keep Hall from getting it. According to the Sheriff’s Office, Draper called 911 again to report the shooting and Hall was transported to SOVAH Health Martinsville and then airlifted to Roanoke where he underwent surgery. Anyone with information is asked to call the Henry County Sheriff’s Office at 276-638-8751.\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. – The Buffalo Sabres are banking on Taylor Hall to turn what was a long and unsettled offseason into a far brighter immediate future. Buffalo became the surprise team to win the Hall free-agency sweepstakes by signing the 10th-year forward and six-time 20-goal-scorer to a one-year, $8 million contract Sunday night. The deal came together after the Sabres made landing Hall their top priority in free agency, with second-year coach Ralph Krueger playing an integral role. Krueger was an assistant in Edmonton during Hall's rookie season, and then spent the 2012-13 lockout shortened year as the Oilers coach. The Sabres entered free agency about $26 million under the NHL’s salary $81.5 million cap, and are currently projected to have about $14 million of space available following Hall’s addition.\n\nKenya's Brigid Kosgei crosses the line to win the London Marathon in London, England, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2020. Athletes are competing on a 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) closed-loop course consisting of 19.6 clockwise laps around St. James' Park. (Richard Heathcote/Pool via AP)LONDON – Brigid Kosgei defied the rain and the gloom to defend her London Marathon title around a sodden St James’s Park on Sunday after a race staged six months later than planned and without any spectators due to the pandemic. The 26-year-old world record holder comfortably won her duel with fellow Kenyan Ruth Chepngetich, the world champion, who was eventually pipped for second by Sara Hall of the United States. Kosgei broke for home with seven miles to go leaving Chepngetich, who had looked the stronger in the mid-stages of the race, far behind.\n\nNEWPORT, R.I. – Billie Jean King and the other members of the Original 9 who laid the groundwork for the women’s professional tennis tour are the first group nominated together for the International Tennis Hall of Fame. They join Jonas Bjorkman, Sergi Brugera, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Lleyton Hewitt, Lisa Raymond and the late Dennis Van der Meer on the ballot announced Monday for the Hall’s Class of 2021. That group and Van der Meer, who advocated for a universal teaching method in tennis, were nominated in the Contributor Category. Van der Meer died last year. The full ballot now goes to the official voting group — which includes tennis journalists, historians and Hall of Fame members — and fans can vote online in the Player Category from Oct. 1-25.\n\nROANOKE, Va. – A woman whose son was killed by a Roanoke city police officer in 2019 wants the video evidence of her son’s last moments to be released to the public. Lori Hall’s son, Chase Austin, was killed in October 2019 after an officer-involved shooting in Roanoke near the Krispy Kreme on Hershberger Road NW. Austin was killed after he became confrontational and pointed a semi-automatic pistol at a Roanoke city police officer during their conversation, according to Virginia State Police. Back in February, Roanoke City Commonwealth’s Attorney Donald Caldwell announced his findings regarding the shooting. Whatever his motivation, Mr. Austin introduced the element of deadly force into what was otherwise a relatively benign situation.\n\nLOS ANGELES - Thirty years after the debut of \"The Arsenio Hall Show,\" Hall is back with his first comedy special, a Netflix presentation that includes tackling the challenges of being a comedian in the modern age. \"It's a scary time to do standup,\" Hall says near the outset. \"You think every word could end your f---ing career.\" Hall, 63, proceeds to address a wide range of topics, including the tweet that got Roseanne fired, Tiger Woods, Donald Trump (and winning \"Celebrity Apprentice\"), his \"comedy hero\" Bill Cosby, O.J. \"Arsenio Hall: Smart & Classy\" premieres Oct. 29 on Netflix, which released the first trailer Tuesday.\n\nBut for one Chick-fil-A employee, it was just another day on the job. It all started when Hall was going to get her son out of her van and dropped her phone straight down a storm drain. After they hung up on him, Seth and Hall noticed the man hole cover next to the drain wasn't bolted down. \"He then climbs down into the hole and retrieves my phone which miraculously is not broken or wet.\" Hall said Seth asked her to snap a photo of him so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work that day.\n\nRight after Candace Hall turned in her dissertation, wrapping up her time as a student at Maryville University, she walked out to a sweet surprise. They were doing the floss dance to 1K Phews song We Did It. After the dancing, they picked up signs that read \"I love you mom!\" Halls dissertation examined the factors that contribute to job satisfaction in academia, especially among faculty of color. I just hope my kids remember this when they get older and they feel like, 'Oh, I cant do it.' I hope they look back to this moment, like, Look what mom did, Hall said.\n\nROANOKE, Va. - Christiansburg High School students had the opportunity of a lifetime Thursday night as they sung on stage with the classic rock giant, Foreigner. Foreigner bassist, Jeff Pilson, said the band loves playing in small venues like Elmwood park as compared to the mega-concerts. And it was the experience of a lifetime for many Christiansburg High School students when they joined Foreigner on stage to sing backup for their hit \"I Want To Know What Love Is.\" Christiansburg High School choral director Mandi Steele said she was thrilled her students had the chance to do something that most people never get to do. The Christiansburg students were arguably some of the youngest people in the crowd, but Steele said her students enjoyed the rest of the concert just as much as everyone else.\n\nCourtesy of The Strong, Rochester, New York(CNN) - Some of the world's most beloved toys and games are vying for a spot in the National Toy Hall of Fame.
