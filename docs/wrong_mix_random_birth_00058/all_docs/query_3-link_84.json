        "text": "In an epic master and apprentice battle, the 22-year-old Tomic eventually overpowered Hewitt 6-3 6-2 3-6 5-7 7-5 on a brutal day in New York.\n\nThe game in this country has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks in the wake of Nick Kyrgios’ disgusting sledge towards Stan Wawrinka and his subsequent behaviour on court in his first-round loss to Andy Murray.\n\n“Tuesday night, the most reviled man in tennis walked out of Arthur Ashe Stadium clad in black, jaw bristling with a pirate’s goatee, black Mohawk erupting atop his skull. Tan highlights and day-glo footwear undermined the villainous affect, and the fact that he’d lost didn’t help. Only one part of his get-up, though, was completely wrong,” Sports Illustrated’s S.L. Price wrote of Kyrgios this week.\n\n“Buzzed into the right side of the 20-year-old Australian’s cranium was an EKG-like scrawl — the sign, in an emergency room, of a heart vitally alive. It should have been a flat line. The career of the game’s most exciting talent, we’ve heard, is in critical condition. Worse, one of tennis’ most revered codes — a way of life, really — may well be very much dead.”\n\nPrice was referring to the Australian way, a gentleman’s way.\n\n“The Aussie Way was one of the down-under nation’s great gifts to the world, baked into its sporting culture in the early 20th century by coach Harry Hopman, personified by Hall of Famers Frank Sedgman, Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall and John Newcombe, and last seen in purest form in the late-90s career of Pat Rafter.”\n\nToday, the Aussie way emerged once more.\n\nPlayed in a tremendous spirit, Tomic prevailed by showing just as much fight as the greatest fighter the game has ever seen — the man standing at the other end.\n\nTomic saved two match points to end Hewitt’s US Open career, pulling out all the stops to deny Hewitt a 33rd five-set victory.\n\nHewitt, who will retire after the Australian Open in January, overcame a hip injury to rally back from two sets and a service break down to serve for the match at 5-4 in the fifth.\n\nBut Tomic, 12 years his junior, gallantly battled back to deny his Davis Cup teammate and mentor after three hours and 27 minutes to reach the third round for the first time.\n\nPutting friendship ahead of their rivalry, Hewitt and Tomic practised together on Wednesday in preparation for the match and the victor was full of praise for his mentor.\n\n“It is so difficult playing him. I was very, very nervous (and) it could have gone both ways,” Tomic said after setting up a showdown with French 12th seed Richard Gasquet on Saturday.\n\n“He is a huge legend to me. I always looked up to him. It was very emotional and it was tough to prepare before the match, this one.\n\n“I am sure a lot of people think he is a great legend, not just myself, so for me it was a privilege.”\n\nAn against-the-odds 33rd five-set win of his career would have been a symbolic milestone and matched the legendary Pete Sampras’ record in matches that have gone the distance.\n\nHewitt had conquered the American in the final at Flushing Meadows back in 2001 to land his maiden grand slam crown.\n\nAlas, he was unable to convert either of his match points on Tomic’s serve deep in the fifth set.\n\nThe South Australian had been troubled by a hip injury early on, but roared to life after receiving treatment while trailing by two sets and a break.\n\nHe broke Tomic immediately after the medical time-out and then again four games later to snatch the third set.\n\nAfter blowing an early break in the fourth to enable Tomic to serve for the match at 5-4, Hewitt’s comeback hopes seemed dashed.\n\nFoolish to write him off, Hewitt — a part-time campaigner ranked 355th these days — dug in to peel off three successive games to force the decider set as Tomic began to tire in the sweltering heat.\n\nThe young gun, though, dug deep to produce his own valiant fightback to finally prevail."
