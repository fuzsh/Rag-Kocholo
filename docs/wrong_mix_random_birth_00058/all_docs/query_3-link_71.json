        "text": "The tri-level luxury pad in Palm Beach Rd came to market in February this year for more than $5 million and has sold with a short settlement. It is believed the home sold for more than $4.6 million and the paperwork was carried out on Friday evening, while others were trick or treating in the suburb.\n\nThe 33-year-old tennis ace and his former Home and Away actor wife have held the trophy home for nine years.\n\nThe couple have three young children, Ava, Cruz and Mia who have all enjoyed the Palm Beach summers.\n\nGlenn Lee, of Raine and Horne Palm Beach, confirmed the sale but said confidentiality clauses prevented him from disclosing any other details, such as the price or the new owner.\n\n“All I can say it is a very good buyer and the property sold on a walk-in, walkout basis with just the Hewitts personal effects taken away,” Mr Lee said.\n\n“It was a great package.”\n\nThe five-bedroom, four-bathroom property has a Northeast aspect, views from Barrenjoey Headland to Palm Beach rock pool and had been painted and landscaped by the real estate agents in preparation for the sale.\n\nThe Hewitts paid $4.4 million for the holiday home in 2005 but have spent a lot of time out of the country.\n\nIt is believed the family are in Melbourne at present, in time for the Melbourne Cup and are back in Australia for a while. They also own acreage in Kenthurst.\n\nAccording to RP Data the average time it takes to sell a property in Palm Beach is 98 days.\n\nMr Lee said there has been a fair bit of activity in the prestige suburb recently.\n\n“We have buyers on most of our properties,” he added."
