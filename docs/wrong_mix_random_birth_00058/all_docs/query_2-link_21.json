        "text": "Like father, like son — as the old adage goes.\n\nAnd Sunrise hosts Nat Barr and Matt Doran were shocked on Monday, at how similar Cruz Hewitt, 15, looked to his tennis champion father, Lleyton Hewitt, at the Australian Open on Sunday.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Sunrise stars left in shock at Cruz Hewitt debut.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nNat and Matt were stunned as the near identical photos flashed on the screen.\n\n“It’s very cool, isn’t it?” Nat said, looking at the photos.\n\nMatt, also amazed by their likeness, explained Lleyton was able to have a hit with his son before the match.\n\n“His coach let Lleyton warm-up with him as well — so they had a hit before the game,” Matt said.\n\nNat shot back: “(Now) that’s a good story — look at those pictures.”\n\nLleyton Hewitt, of course, is one of Australia’s most successful international tennis players.\n\nHe was the youngest qualifier for the Australian Open in 1997, at his own debut.\n\nMark Beretta, who is at this year’s Australian Open, gave details of Cruz’s match at the weekend.\n\n“Cruz Hewitt, 15, showed signs of his dad at his Australian Open debut yesterday — a lot of similarities with his champion father,” Beretta said in his report.\n\n“It wasn’t a win this time, with Cruz losing to a tough American opponent. But he did prove that a Hewitt can still draw a crowd with it (the court) packed for the match.”\n\nCruz made his debut at the junior boys’ championship.\n\nHewitt got off to a hot start in his match against 17-year-old sixth seed Alexander Razeghi when he won long rallies and broke the American to love.\n\nA rain delay in the first set put a temporary stop to proceedings before the match resumed and Razeghi raced towards a 6-2 6-3 victory in one hour and 26 minutes.\n\nThe crowd inside the 3000-seat arena gave both players warm applause.\n\n“Just unbelievably proud, to be honest,” Lleyton told Nine before the match.\n\n“He wanted me to go out and warm him up. They asked me late last night if I’d actually go out and warm him up this morning on Show Court 3. Just a really special moment.\n\n“My first ever main-draw match at the Australian Open was actually out on Show Court 3 as well, so just some great memories coming back of me playing here.”"
