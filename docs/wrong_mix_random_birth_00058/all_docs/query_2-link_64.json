        "text": "First published in The Sydney Morning Herald on September 11, 2001\n\nMark Riley, Herald Correspondent, in New York\n\nThe boisterous bars and glitzy celebrity hang-outs of Manhattan should have been Lleyton Hewitt’s to command.\n\nBut there was one problem. Hewitt may have been old enough to demolish Pete Sampras in the US Open tennis final but the 20-year-old is still a year too young to enjoy a celebratory drink in New York.\n\nHewitt chose to celebrate his win, and the $US850,000 cheque it brings, with family and friends at an abstemious and subdued dinner in a quiet Italian restaurant off Fifth Avenue.\n\nIt was far from the boisterous victory celebrations for Pat Rafter’s dual wins, when groups of Australians partied to sunrise at a Manhattan bar and were led in endless beer-sodden renditions of Waltzing Matilda by tennis great John Newcombe.\n\nHewitt spent the night kissing and cuddling his girlfriend, the Belgian tennis star Kim Clijsters, and chatting with his parents, Glynn and Cherilyn, and other family members.\n\nHis eyes lit up when Newcombe arrived to have a quick drink and then when a group of Western Bulldogs AFL players dropped in to offer congratulations.\n\nCraig Ellis, the Western Bulldogs defender, said he and Tony Liberatore, Nathan Brown, Simon Garlick and Luke Darcy had all gone out to the match. Brown had hand-passed a football to Hewitt as he came off centre court after the match. He caught it. Football is the young sportsman’s second love.\n\nHewitt’s coach, Darren Cahill, said the subdued celebration was in keeping with Hewitt’s off-court character.\n\nCahill also said he hoped Hewitt’s win would finally endear him to those in Australia who have found him difficult to like because of his on-court histrionics and some ill-considered comments in the past.\n\n“He’s a good kid,” Cahill said. “He certainly goes out there and gives it his all every time he plays.\n\n“Even Lleyton said he’s now learning not to get so pumped up all the time, and maybe that was some of the stuff that alienated some of his supporters back home.\n\n“It’s pretty hard not to like the kid when he’s done what he’s done the last four or five days.”\n\nHewitt will inevitably suffer in comparisons with Rafter as Australia’s next tennis champion. He does not possess the laconic humour and self-effacing ways of Rafter, nor Rafter’s easy relationship with the Australian press.\n\nRafter invited the media into his celebrations in Manhattan, knowing footage of the revelry would be beamed to fans in Australia.\n\nAs Hewitt left his dinner on Sunday night, he was shepherded through a side door and into a waiting taxi.\n\nTwo members of the Australian press, who had arranged with Hewitt’s advisers to get photos of him as he left for the night, were shoved aside by the restaurant staff and had their cameras covered as Hewitt walked past.\n\n“I did it because that’s what Lleyton asked me to do,” the restaurant manager told the Herald.\n\nLoading\n\nCahill later apologised, saying it had been a misunderstanding.\n\n“He’s not going to get crucified in the press again, is he?” he asked. “Doesn’t he deserve his moment of glory?”\n\nPostscript: Hewitt had been one of the last people to leave New York aboard a Qantas flight in the hours before the terrorist strikes on September 11. Hewitt and fellow passengers were told of the attacks when their flight had landed in Sydney as they were preparing to disembark. Australian Federal Police had entered the plane to ask passengers if they had seen anything suspicious. Hewitt said at the time:“It’s great that I won a few tennis matches, but there is a lot more that is larger than tennis matches, that’s for sure, when you look at the bigger picture and life in general. To think I was at New York airport going to Los Angeles only five or six hours before those people, and all day yesterday I was driving around New York in a car holding the US Open Trophy. It is a shocking thing to happen. Everybody is praying and thinking about those who have been injured.”"
