They got to the third round and were due to face Donald Johnson and Jared Palmer (the eventual champions) before Federer withdrew to focus on his singles campaign.\n\n16th\n\n1870 – Tennis gold medallist at the first modern Olympics at the 1896 Games in Athens, John Mary Pius Boland, was born today. He was an Irish Nationalist politician, and Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons and member of the Irish Parliamentary Party for South Kerry 1900–1918. Boland visited his friend Thrasyvoulos Manos in Athens during the Olympics, and Manos, a member of the organising committee, entered Boland in the tennis tournament (as you do!!). Boland promptly won the singles tournament, defeating Friedrich Traun of Germany in the first round, Evangelos Rallis of Greece in the second, Konstantinos Paspatis of Greece in the semi-finals, and Dionysios Kasdaglis of Egypt in the final. Boland then entered the doubles event with Traun, the German runner whom he had defeated in the first round of the singles. Together, they won the doubles event. They defeated Aristidis and Konstantinos Akratopoulos of Greece in the first round, had a bye in the semi-finals, and defeated Demetrios Petrokokkinos of Greece and Kasdaglis in the final. When the Union Flag and the German flag were run up the flagpole to honour Boland and Traun’s victory, Boland pointed out to the man hoisting the flags that he was Irish, adding “It [the Irish flag]’s a gold harp on a green ground, we hope.” The officials agreed to have an Irish flag prepared. 1922 – US Men’s National Championship: Bill Tilden beats Bill Johnston (4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4). 1927 – Rene Lacoste beats Bill Tilden for US Lawn Tennis Association title. 1940 – American top player of the 1050s and early 1960s Butch Buchholz was born today. An outstanding junior, he won all three Boys’ Singles slam titles in a row during 1958–1959 – French Open and Wimbledon in 1958 and the Australian Open in 1959. (The US Open was the last Grand Slam event to add a Juniors Championship, waiting until 1973 to finally do so). Buchholz was ranked by Lance Tingay the World Number 5 amateur player in 1960, and was ranked four times in the US Top 10. He played for the US in the Davis Cup from 1959–60. He turned professional in 1961, winning the United States Pro Championship in 1962, by beating Pancho Segura in the final. Buchholz was an original member of Lamar Hunt’s Handsome Eight, a group of players signed by in 1968 for the newly formed professional World Championship Tennis (WCT) group. Since retiring as a player, Buchholz has served tennis in many professional and administrative capacities. He has been the Commissioner of World Team Tennis from 1977-1978, an Executive Director of the Association of Tennis Professionals from 1981-1982, and member of the men’s pro council from 1981-1983. In 1985, Buchholz founded the Lipton International Players Championships (now known as the Miami Masters), which is now a leading event on both the men’s and women’s tours. Buchholz helped create Altenis, a management company which oversees tennis tournaments in Latin America. He also helped secure the continuation of the Orange Bowl International Tennis Tournament, a prominent international junior event in Florida. In 1992, Buchholz teamed-up with Arthur Ashe to found the ‘Good Life Mentoring Program’, benefiting hundreds of elementary and middle school children in the greater Miami area. In 2005, Buchholz was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. 1948 – American professional player Rosie Casals was born on this day. Rosemary Casals earned her reputation as a rebel in the tennis world when she began competing in the early 1960s. During a tennis career that spanned more than two decades, she won more than 90 tournaments, and was a motivating force behind many of the changes that occurred in women’s tennis during the 1960s and 1970s. While still just a teenager, Casals began to rebel on the court. She hated the tradition of younger players competing only against each other on the junior circuit. Gutsy and determined right from the start, Casals wanted to work as hard as possible to better her game. For an added challenge, she often entered tournaments to play against girls who were two or three years older. Junior tennis was the first of several obstacles Casals faced during her tennis career. At five-feet-two-inches tall, she was one of the shortest players on the court. Another disadvantage for her was class distinction. Traditionally, tennis was a sport practiced in expensive country clubs by the white upper class. Casals’s ethnic heritage and poor background immediately set her apart from most of the other players. “The other kids had nice tennis clothes, nice rackets, nice white shoes, and came in Cadillacs,” Casals told a reporter for People. “I felt stigmatized because we were poor.” Unfamiliarity with country club manners also made Casals feel different from the other players. Traditionally, audiences applauded only politely during matches and players wore only white clothes on the court. Both of these practices seemed foolish to Casals. She believed in working hard to perfect her game and expected the crowd to show its appreciation for her extra efforts. In 1972 at the tradition-filled courts of Wimbledon, she was nearly excluded from competition for not wearing white. Later in her career, she became known for her brightly coloured outfits, designed for her by Ted Tinlin. By age 16 Casals was the top junior and women’s level player in northern California. At 17 she was ranked eleventh in the country and was earning standing ovations for her aggressive playing style. More experience on the national and international levels of play helped Casals improve her game. In 1966 she and Billie Jean King, her doubles partner, won the US hard-court and indoor tournaments. That same year they reached the quarter-finals in the women’s doubles at Wimbledon. In 1967 Casals and King took the doubles crown at Wimbledon and at the United States and South African championships. The two dominated women’s doubles play for years, becoming one of the most successful duos in tennis history. (They are the only doubles team to have won U.S. titles on grass, clay, indoor, and hard surfaces). Casals was also a successful individual player, ranking third among U.S. women during this period. Casals soon became involved in another innovation: World Team Tennis (WTT). WTT involved tennis teams, each made up of two women and four men, from cities throughout the United States. Matches included both singles and doubles games. Casals won 112 professional doubles tournaments, the second most in history behind Martina Navratilova. Her last doubles championship was at the 1988 tournament in Oakland, California, where her partner was Navratilova. Casals played in a total of 685 singles and doubles tournaments during her career. Despite her victories on the courts, Casals continued to fight tennis traditions on several fronts. Amateur tennis players had always been favoured over professionals. Because many amateur tennis players came from non-wealthy backgrounds, they were forced to accept under-the-table money in order to continue playing. This, in turn, made them professionals and prevented them from entering major tournaments that allowed only amateurs to play, such as Wimbledon. Fighting against this discrimination, Casals worked for an arrangement that allowed both amateur and professional tennis players to compete in the same tournaments. Casals’s together with Billie Jean King challenged the large difference in prize monies awarded to male and female players. Even though they worked as hard and played as often as men, women earned much smaller prizes. In 1970 Casals and other women threatened to boycott the Pacific Southwest Championships if they were not paid higher prize money and not given more media attention. The ruling body of US tennis, the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA), refused to listen to their demands. In response, the women established their own tournament, the 1970 Virginia Slims Invitational. The attention generated by this successful tournament, which was won by Casals after a victory in the final over Judy Dalton, quickly brought about the formation of other women’s tournaments and greater prize monies for women. 1991 – former Latvian player Diāna Bukājeva was born today. She holds a win–loss record of 5–0 for Latvia in Fed Cup competition, having represented her country in 2007 and 2008 in Mauritius and Armenia respectively. Her latter appearances helped the team get promoted to Group II of the 2009 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Zone.\n\n17th"
