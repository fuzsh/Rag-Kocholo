        "text": "The Club Where It Happened:\n\nNotes on the Origins of USTA Men’s 55+ National Tournaments\n\nChuck Maland\n\ncmaland@utk.edu June 2020\n\nDespite the cancellations of many national senior men’s tennis tournaments this year—a pandemic year we’re unlikely to forget—we are enjoying a Golden Age of senior men’s tennis. The formation of the National Senior Men’s Tennis Association is just one indication of that fact. Even more significantly, the USTA now sanctions national tournaments in singles and doubles on all four surfaces—indoor hard court, hard court, clay, and grass—in every 5-year age group between the 55s and the 90s.\n\nYet it wasn’t always so. According to USTA history, this is when the first USTA national men’s tournaments in different age groups were staged:\n\n90s — 1999\n\n85s — 1983 (but then not held again until 1988)\n\n80s — 1977\n\n75s — 1973\n\n70s — 1970\n\n65s — 1968\n\n60s — 1966\n\nIn many cases—though not all—just one national tournament was held in the first year in each of these age groups, usually on clay, followed by the next year when competitions in all other surfaces joined in. The USTA website lists the singles and doubles champions of all these tournaments here. (Unfortunately, you won’t find my name there, but you will likely recognize a lot of names, perhaps even yours. If my legs hold up, though, I’m going to keep trying.)\n\nNot enough people know, however, that the first USTA 55+ National Men’s Tennis Tournament was hosted at the club where I most often play, the Knoxville Racquet Club. Here I’d like to offer a brief history of that first tournament and a few observations about how that tournament, despite many differences, is similar to many of the national tournaments that we play today.\n\nFor those who don’t know the geography of East Tennessee, Knoxville is nestled in the foothills of the Great Smokey Mountains. Interstate Highways 40, 75, and 81 converge and go through the city; thus we’re within several hours’ drive of Lexington Ky., Asheville, N.C., Atlanta, and Nashville. It’s the home of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the University of Tennessee (where I’ve taught cinema studies and American literature for 42 years), and the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame. The corporate headquarters of Regal Cinema and Pilot Oil are in Knoxville—Pilot’s corporate offices are a stone’s throw from the Knoxville Racquet Club—and several video production companies, including Discovery, are active in Knoxville, partly because of lower production costs than in New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta.\n\nThe Knoxville Racquet Club was then a recently established, member-owned club, having been founded in 1961. When the tournament was held in 1963, the club had 11 clay courts and some indoor hard courts: today, besides 12 clay courts, we have five outdoor hard courts and ten indoor hard courts. The clubhouse sits atop a Tennessee ridge—players have to drive two-tenths of a mile up a steep asphalt road off Lonas Drive to get to the parking lot. The courts were built on two separate tiers below the clubhouse, so anyone interested in watching matches can sit at the top of one of those tiers to watch competitions, which may have been one draw to hold the tournament there. Players walk down 18 steps from the clubhouse to play on the first tier of courts; the second tier goes down even farther.\n\nThe singles final on Sunday was a hard-fought match. Lipshutz got an early break and was up 3-0 and later 5-2, but Clinton won four straight to go ahead 6-5 and eventually won the set 9-7. In the second, Clinton got an early break to go up 3-1 and held the break to win the second set 6-3 for the coveted title. Following the match, the gracious Lipshutz told reporter Bill Luther that “Clinton is a mighty fine tennis player, and he didn’t seem to tire as much as I thought he would.” Clinton admitted to Luther that Lipshutz “really put the pressure on me. It looked pretty bad when he took the first three games of the opening set.”\n\nThe doubles finals generated at least as much excitement. Hodgkins and Leonard won the first set 6-3, lost the second to McCannon and Ganger, 7-5, and were tied at 7-7 in the third when the match was stopped because of darkness. Forced to return to finish the match on Monday morning, McCannon and Ganger got a hold and a break to win 9-7 in the third. So in the first national men’s 55+ tournament, unseeded players took home the victory trophy in both singles and doubles. (In addition, Clinton was 59 when he won the tournament: today he would have been in his last year of the 55s division.)\n\nThe day after the tournament ended, both daily newspapers in Knoxville congratulated the tournament committee and the club for a job well done, and 2nd-place singles finisher Lipshutz seemed to speak for the participants by complimenting the setting, the organization of the tournament and the people, adding that the tournament “was a nice as any I’ve ever played in.”\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\nAs I look back nearly 58 years, I can note significant differences between this tournament and the ones we’re playing today: the players all seemed to be in tennis whites (at least the ones who made it into newspaper photos). All the players used a wooden racquet, and none of those racquets had a head that approached 120 square inches; in fact, they all were 65 to 68 square inches. There were no third-set super tiebreakers. In fact, there were no tiebreakers at all, as witnessed by the 9-7 scores in the first set of the singles finals and the last set of the doubles final.\n\nBut there were similarities, too. Aches and pains were clearly there, as they are in our day: three of the opening day matches were decided by default. The camaraderie that we see in many of our tournaments today was evident in this first tournament in Knoxville. Some of the players were familiar with one another from matches in the past, good evidence of their continuing passion for the game.\n\nThere was also a good bit of storytelling by players not on the court. I had to laugh at one comment by an unnamed player who told a Journal reporter: “The old tennis balls had more rubber in them than these modern ones—I remember 1927 as a year when they really took off when you hit ‘em.”\n\nSenior tennis really began to take off after the inaugural 55+ tournament in Knoxville. By the end of the decade, Knoxville was hosting four national senior men’s clay age-group tournaments: the 55s and 60s at the Knoxville Racquet Club and the 50s and 65s at Cherokee Country Club. Multiple USTA Senior Champions like Bobby Riggs and Gardnar Mulloy became fixtures in the tournaments starting in the late 1960s. Later, the 55s and 65s continued to be a staple in Knoxville, though to my great disappointment—I couldn’t travel to national tournaments because of my job—the 55s moved to Atlanta in 2005, the year after I turned 55.\n\nI hope this has been an informative history lesson about the first national USTA men’s 55+ tennis tournament. I’ll close with a comment by Eldon Roark Sr., an award-winning columnist from the Memphis Press-Scimitar who won a couple of singles matches in the consolations in this 1963 event. Early in the week, he told a News-Sentinel reporter that tennis was a “profitable” game for him, then explained at some length, in words that I think many of us can appreciate:\n\n“Tennis really paid off for me. I haven’t paid any money to doctors or missed more than two or three days of work in thirty years. Tennis is a game for a lifetime. There are men at this tournament up to 69 years old who still play remarkable tennis—and believe me, it takes co-ordination, stamina, and grace to play tennis.\n\nA quick glance around these courts backs me up. There aren’t any fat men here. Tennis helps to burn up calories and keep men quick on their feet. Many of these men have been playing tennis for over 50 years. This is serious tennis for these men. They really mean business. You’ll find keener competition among these seniors than in any other division.”\n\nNow that the “bigger must surely be better” version of the Davis Cup has concluded, it’s time to take a look at how the event itself has evolved over time. Initially, it was a clubby/chummy affair between the US and the British Isles, as Great Britain was known long before there was even a thought of Brexit. True, there had been international, country versus country tennis gatherings, such as England versus Ireland or England versus France, but that was in the 1890s. The “official” team competition wasn’t birthed until 1900 when the US and BI faced-off at Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe visitors, who were supposed to be the creme de la crème of tennis because they came from Great Britain, were throttled by their upstart hosts, 3-0. One of the competitors on the winning side was a Harvard student named Dwight Davis. Five years after the launch, Australasia (with players from both Australia and New Zealand), Austria, Belgium and France took part in what was called the International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Perhaps to downplay the seeming pompousness of the title, the competition quickly became known as the Davis Cup, a salute to the donor of the perpetual trophy.\n\nIn the beginning, the competition was played as a Challenge Cup. The set-up allowed the winner from the previous year to sit on the sideline while the other countries battled for a spot in the final. The “wait and watch” was great for the title holder but the format proved to be an ultra-marathon for all the other participants. In 1972 a change was finally made, and play became a somewhat more sensible win and advance tournament.\n\nSince then, the international competition grew so large that it became unwieldy and modifications were needed. None of those alterations have even come close to matching the November 18-24 Madrid extravaganza that was created by Gerard Pique, the former FC Barcelona football (soccer) star and his Kosmos team, supported by Hiroshi Mikitani’s Rakuten financing and sanctified by the International Tennis Federation.\n\nBefore going further, it must be stressed that the “old Davis Cup way” was really no longer working. But, bulldozing history to put up a new event demands an overwhelming amount of thought and even more insight. Thus far, it appears that a “too much, too soon” approach has been built on a foundation that isn’t exactly sand, but something nearly as tenuous. In its first appearance, the set-up seems fragile. It is as if, Pique and his colleagues were trying to create a Tennis World Cup.\n\nMy first Davis Cup experience was in 1963 at the majestic Los Angeles Tennis Club. The US faced Mexico. I was new to the game as a player and even more of a rookie when it came to knowing about the Davis Cup. Being in high school, I didn’t have the necessary connections to be “gifted” a ticket to the matches. Though I wasn’t destitute, I just didn’t have the money for tickets to the three-day tie.\n\nI was, however, bold. I wanted to see Chuck McKinley and Dennis Ralston take on Rafael Osuna and Antonio Palafox so I decided to “make an impression.” I wore a pale blue shirt, topped it with a tasteful tie, preppy khaki slacks and the footwear of the day – that wasn’t a tennis shoe – penny loafers. Carrying my blue blazer in the crook of my elbow, I arrived very early on the first day of the matches and went directly to the fence at the back of the LATC where the wire was sagging just enough to let me scale over.\n\nEven though I was a Davis Cup novice, I remember being impressed by the sheer dynamic of the US facing off against Mexico. The backstory was even more interesting because as a 17-year-old Ralston had teamed with Osuna to win the 1960 Wimbledon doubles title. Now, Osuna was his opponent, but he was still a USC teammate. Together, they had practiced at the LATC , where USC played its home matches, and coincidently, won the 1963 NCAA doubles title. But, that didn’t matter at all for the three days of the tie.\n\nThe LATC center court seemed gigantic to me. As mentioned I was a rookie and this was my first glimpse of play on a big stage. The bleacher seating was on wooden benches surrounding the court. There was room for a couple of thousand people. Because I was so early, there were very few people around. I browsed around and noticed there were individual chairs at court-level on the west side of the court. They looked much more comfortable than the bleachers and my goal was to be close to the action. I wanted to taste it.\n\nAfter all these years, I can still remember being a tad uncomfortable making my next move. But I figured after my Eiger Mountain entrance success, I managed to continue with my “I belong here” approach. After putting on my sport coat, I walked onto the court and went straight to the seating area…and was one of the few spectators there. In time others joined me. I exchanged greetings, trying to be friendly while attempting to be invisible. Just before the start of play, a small man, who was importantly dressed, came up and started to talk to me. For a moment, I almost swallowed my tongue.\n\nHe was John Coman, who I later discovered was a Southern California Tennis Association Vice President and a close friend of Perry Jones, who was the “Emperor of Tennis” in the section. During our brief discussion, he told me about his love of the game and his long-time involvement as a tournament official and umpire. (In fact, he would later invent the Coman Tiebreak, which Jimmy Parker said some senior players refer to as “The Roamin’ Coman”).\n\nWhen the matches concluded, I bumped into Coman on the walkway outside the court entrance. He asked what I thought about the first day’s play. After we exchanged assessment, he asked if he would see me the next day. Believing that Friday had been a “one-off, I really lucked out” occurrence, I was eventually able to mumble “I hope so…” He then said when I got to the club to look for him at the SCTA office, which was in a nook on the east side of center court.\n\nFor the next two days, I repeated my back fence climbing routine, watched the US dominate Mexico, 4-1 and received a wonderful tennis education thanks to John Coman.\n\n(An important aside, the US went on to defeat Australia in the December 26-28 final, on grass in Adelaide, 3-2. The Honorable Robert Kelleher, who I met through Coman at the LATC, was the team captain. He served as President of the United States Lawn Tennis Association in 1967-68 and was a driving force behind the advent of Open Tennis. The International Tennis Hall of Fame recognized all that he had done for the game when he was inducted in 2000. A Federal Court Judge in real life, over the years, he provided tennis players like Jack Kramer, Richard “Pancho” Gonzalez, Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King with legal advice. He also played an instrumental role in Martina Navratilova’s gaining US citizenship after she defected from Czechoslovakia in 1975. In the years after our Davis Cup meeting, “The Judge” became a close friend.)\n\nThe Madrid undertaking was bold and innovative. Still, with all the pre-tournament hype and sensationalism as fanfare, the end product came up short which opens the door to analyzing what actually took place in Year One. As the saying goes, “first impressions are almost always the most lasting.”\n\nA few of the issues on the “Could Have Done Better” list include:\n\nMatch scheduling (the US versus Italy finished at 4:00 a.m., just in time for the players to enjoy an early breakfast. (Nearly every match was almost nine hours in length.);\n\nPlodding ticket sales;\n\nImprovements in communication, with clarity for the fans, players and media. Keeping accurate information flowing so that speculation is not regularly brought into play.\n\nWith the old Davis Cup there were often gripping, edge of your seat, emotional contests in the “five matches, five-set” play. Home and away ties added crowd fervor which made the competitive recipe even tastier.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that whenever Spain played on the Manuel Santana Center Court, with a capacity of 12,422, the crowd was raucous. The Arantxa Sánchez Vicario No. 2 Court, with room for 2,923 spectators, rocked on occasion. From time to time, Court No. 3 was loud too, but that was due more to having a mere 1,772 seats in an enclosed space than a collection of rabid fans.\n\nAustralian captain Lleyton Hewitt admitted that the atmosphere lacked feeling because of the neutral setting. French doubles standout Nicolas Mahut brought up how much his country’s fans ordinarily helped their team, but few were in attendance. Faithful support groups stayed away to show their unhappiness with the decision to scrap the old Davis Cup format.\n\nFour years later he didn’t “choke” against the Russians. For me, being in the early December dungeon cold at Moscow’s Olympic Stadium in 1995 and watching the US prevail 3-2, post-Cold War, against “new” Russia is a cherished recollection.\n\nCaptain Tom Gullickson was, as always, a discerning leader. Of course, he had a redoubtable group of players including Sampras, Jim Courier, Todd Martin and Richey Reneberg, who was a late replacement for the injured Agassi. The Russians had countered with Andrei Chesnokov, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and doubles specialist, Andrei Olhovskiy.\n\nIn what some called “Pete’s Cup”, Sampras, in a difficult to put into words encounter, survived a three-hour, thirty-eight minute slog against Chesnokov, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 on ultra-slow red clay. The score, in and of itself, is still mesmerizing. But, seeing Sampras hit the match winning shot and collapse onto the court with severe leg cramps will always be a vivid memory.\n\nAs soon as he crumpled to the ground, George Fareed, the US team doctor, along with trainer Bob Russo sprinted to his aide knocking over some of the shrubbery surrounding the court. Sampras later admitted that it was humorous to see the two barreling toward him while he was thinking “all I want to do is straighten my legs.”\n\nOnce the medical rescue team and the patient moved to the locker room, Kafelnikov bested Courier, in the second, contest, 7-6, 7-5, 6-5.\n\nBeing 1-1 and playing at home with the backing of a vociferous crowd, the Russians appeared to be in the driver’s seat. This was particularly true with the doubles being the next match up. Kafelnikov was paired with Olhovskiy. A steady, smart tandem, they were supposed to face Martin and Reneberg, who had never previously teamed up.\n\nKeeping with the “Pete’s Cup” theme (and thanks to “Doc” Fareed’s icing and electrolytes treatment), Sampras was able to wobble around in the team dressing room roughly an hour after his singles match. He told Gullickson later that night he would see how he was feeling in the morning and if he was able to do so, have a hit and be ready for the doubles.\n\nThe team believed that Sampras was out, but as the captain said, with a “that’s Pete” look, “he came back from the dead”. Sampras admitted being quite sore before play began. Then the adrenaline kicked in. Martin and Sampras, who had won Queen’s that June, managed to edge the opposition, 7-5, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nI remember watching the match as if it was in slow motion. It overwhelmed my attention. Looking back, I don’t remember if I ever took a sip of the water I had brought with me to my media seat. I was absolutely engrossed. Actually, I was enthralled watching Sampras playing and doing it so amazingly well.\n\nBut, he wasn’t done. On the final day, he pulverized Kafelnikov, 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 to end the tie. Courier lost, what was an exhibition match, 6-7, 7-5, 6-0 to Chesnokov making the score 3-2. But, the real total was Pete Sampras, with an assist from George Fareed and Bob Russo, “3” and Russia “0”.\n\nIt is something I will never forget. Actually, I don’t think that anyone on hand could ever forget what unfolded during those three days.\n\nIn Madrid, ties were reduced to three matches (two singles and just one doubles) which made the contests Tweet-like. Instead of slashing the number of characters that could be used, the new look limited the essence of the product being proffered – Showcasing the players and their teams. The confusion became more profound on the rules front when it came to “play or don’t play” the doubles, the tie-break and translating the results procedure. It seemed only those with a mathematics degree could make sense of the situation. Additionally, with 18 countries participating, many fans, as well as players, ended up feeling they were meandering members of a “lost tennis tribe.”\n\nBecause of the venue’s layout, there was a chorus of comments about the need for trekking skills to traverse the architecturally pleasing Caja Mágica three court facility. Pathways and route planning came up short. Perhaps hosting such a huge spectacle at a new location brought about “never been there or done it” first experience jitters.\n\nLooking at the big picture, the most staggering aspect of the “new” Davis Cup has to be the 25-year agreement with $3 billion dollars at stake. How do tennis fans put these “Monopoly-money” like figurers into any meaningful perspective?\n\nThe quarter-century commitment and pledged funding are difficult to comprehend . The “unreal” combination of years and money brings to mind 1999. That was when the staggering ISL (International Sport and Leisure) Worldwide-ATP marketing, broadcasting and licensing agreement for “elite” tournaments was made. It was a ten-year arrangement for $1.2 billion. Unfortunately, ISL collapsed in May 2001. Oops.\n\nCanada’s performance was stellar in reaching the final against Spain. Because of the “fairy-tale” quality that had been part of its success, “The Great White North” was looking to join Australasia, Croatia, Serbia, South Africa, Sweden and US each of whom took home the Davis Cup in its debut.\n\nUnfortunately, having won the tie five times since 2000, the home country was a prohibitive favorite to earn number six. That Spain closed out the inaugural Pique/Kosmos/Rakuten/ITF Davis Cup, 2-0, wasn’t surprising. As a result, the Canadian first-timers joined Japan in 1921, Mexico in 1962, Chile in 1976, Slovakia in 2005 and Belgium in 2017 as debut finalists and history’s runners-up.\n\nWith 24 years more to go, the new Davis Cup has potential. Still, the tennis world is trusting that the future offers more than just a quote from Bob Dylan, the 2016 Literature Nobel Prize winner. Dylan, who many regard as the world’s poet laurate said, “Money doesn’t talk, it swears.”\n\nAnd a big budget doesn’t necessarily make it better. It just makes it happen. One can only hope that what seemed like a week-long exhibition will become more organized, less confusing and a tribute to the Davis Cup tradition.\n\nWhenever he has an opportunity, Hunt heads to the court – not the legal one – but the one where he can play. He is as passionate about the game as he has been in leading the family’s effort to ensure that the first Joe isn’t forgotten. His dedication to this quest has been “Clarence Darrow-like.” As the clever 20th Century lawyer, pointed out, “Chase after the truth like all hell and you’ll free yourself, even though you never touch its coattails.”\n\nInitially, Hunt sought to have “The Original” Joe’s name added to the Court of Champions, located between the South Plaza and Courts 10 and 13 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. According to the USTA website, “The US Open Court of Champions celebrates the legacy of the greatest singles champions in the history of the US Open and US Championships. Each champion defines the essence of the talent and the character required to win at tennis’ ultimate proving ground. Inductees, selected by media from around the world, represent the tournament’s all-time greatest “the best of the best” whose electrifying performances have contributed to making the US Open one of the world’s top sporting events.”\n\nThe facts reveal that the Court of Champions was launched in 2004 and prior to 2019 only eleven more enshrinements had taken place recognizing ten men and eight women.\n\nJoseph R. Hunt was killed on February 2, 1945, fifteen days before his 26th birthday. He was on a training flight when his Navy Hellcat, a WWII combat aircraft, went into a spin at 10,000 feet. It crashed into the ocean off the coast of Florida. His body and the plane were never recovered.\n\n​The second Joe has done his utmost to see that the first Joe would be remembered. It hasn’t been an easy. He has been focused on the task since 2013 and has been aided by the entire Hunt family. Still, it has been a slog. Borrowing from Navy slang, throughout it all, he has always been “Above Board.”\n\nAs an example of the way he is, Hunt delighted in revealing, “I know that Joe was not the only player to not have a chance to defend his US National title. Ted (Schroeder) won it in 1942 and was not able to defend in 1943. They both were Navy pilots stationed in Pensacola, Florida. Neither was granted leave to play Forest Hills in 1944 so they both entered a Pensacola tournament held at the same time as the National Championships. Of course, the local tennis community couldn’t believe their lucky stars to have the 1942 and the 1943 champions playing a local event. It was billed as the ‘Clash of Net Champions’ and would supposedly determine the true No. 1 player in the country, despite that ‘other’ tournament taking place in New York.\n\n“Joe and Ted both reached the final where ‘urban legend’ has it that they played their match in front of thousands of spectators on September 4, 1944, while Frank Parker was playing Bill Talbert in the final of Forest Hills – and winning 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. I have spent hours trying to vet the truth of this story.\n\nI know that it is true, I just don’t know if it is 100% true that the two finals were played simultaneously. In any event, Joe beat Ted 6-4, 6-4. Despite what many have written, this was, in fact, the last tournament match of Joe’s life.”\n\nHunt pointed out, “Joe went out for football at the Naval Academy because he loved that sport too and wanted to be part of a team…”\n\nTurville And Neely Started The First ATP Satellite Circuit\n\nKeith Richardson\n\nkrichardson19@gmail.com\n\nJune 2019\n\nIn the early 70’s, the up and coming tennis player who wanted to try his hand at professional tennis faced a dilemma – How to get into the big-time prize money tournaments requiring an ATP ranking. The big-time tournaments were the only events that offered the elusive ATP ranking points. It was a vicious cycle indeed. Thankfully for the 300 plus players worldwide that were unranked, Larry Turville and Armistead Neely came to the rescue.\n\nIt all began in 1972 when Turville and Neely realized there was no clear path to breaking into the major tour other than showing up at a qualifying event prior to the tournament. Even then it was difficult to qualify for the qualifying event without points or without having an “in” with the Tournament Director. Ironically, Tournament Directors preferred foreign players who they thought were a better draw for spectators. The talent, in this second tier of aspiring pros, was unbelievably strong. Every player, including Turville and Neely, felt that on a given day they could compete with the big boys if they could just get into the big tournaments.\n\nIn the first year, Turville and Neely were able to enlist the help of Bill Riordan, President of the Independent Players Association Tour (IPA), which was an alternative to the ATP Tour. Riordan was intrigued by the idea of a circuit of tournaments that would wind throughout Florida from January to March with the winner and runner-up gaining entry to his Indoor Circuit the next week. Each tournament would have a draw of 32 players and would offer prize money of $2,500 (half from the host site sponsors and half from player entry fees, plus $500 from Riordan). The first year, the top twenty-four American players were directly accepted into the main draw based on their National ranking. The rest of the players, including the foreigners, were thrown into a qualifying tournament where the final eight players would gain entry into the main draw. Riordan liked the idea because he could count all the players on the Florida circuit as his associate members.\n\nAfter operating as The Florida Professional Tennis Tour in 1973, Turville and Neely changed the name of the tour to “The WATCH Tour.” The acronym stood for “World Association of Tennis Champions,” and it became a badge of honor among players to say that they had played The WATCH. The new satellite tour was a success at the host sites because fans were getting a preview of some of the players that would soon be on the major tour. Even more important was The WATCH philosophy which stressed that the players needed to give back to the game to show their appreciation for the clubs hosting the events. To do this, each week there would be a Pro-Am, (which players were eager to play because they were guaranteed $50), and with some arm twisting, the players would give two free clinics a week, one for kids and another for women.\n\nThe circuit was an immediate hit with the players as they were able to hone their games during a usually dormant time on their schedules; get housing; and win a little money to boot! However, an important piece was missing: the chance to accumulate ATP points, providing a path to the major circuit. Turville flew to Los Angeles and met with Jack Kramer, President of The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the organization that awarded points in the major professional tournaments worldwide. After Turville’s pitch, Kramer agreed that The WATCH warranted ATP points and asked Larry to draw up the format for how many points would be awarded based on the amount of total prize money for the circuit and number of tournaments.\n\nA booklet was created detailing points, prize money, and the number of events needed to have a circuit. The minimum would be four tournaments and the max would be ten, followed by a Masters tournament for the top 16 finishers. After the completion of the Masters tournament, ATP points would then be distributed to the top 16 accordingly. The idea was that now countries all over the world could create these circuits. Finally, there was a way for the up and comers to get their first ATP points and, in time, move up to the major tour. The following year over a million dollars in prize money was available in satellite tournaments all over the world.\n\nSo, as the saying goes, the rest is history. At the same time, it must be remembered that The WATCH circuit ran for six years and was the first ATP recognized satellite tour. In the beginning Turville and Neely just hoped to have a place to play in the winter, but with the help of Bill Riordan and then the ATP, their vision created a clear path for players such as Johan Kriek, Heinz Gunthardt, Tim Wilkison, Tim and Tom Gullikson, and Andres Gomez to move from The WATCH to the major tour. It also allowed countless other players a chance to gain entry into tournaments all over the world and live the dream of becoming a touring pro.\n\nThe USTA first provided assistance in 1976 by funding a Tour Director position and took over running the circuit in 1980. David Grant, the Orlando Tournament Director, replaced Neely in 1974 and became the Executive Director of the Circuit. Shortly thereafter, Grant became President of PENN Tennis Balls and helped sponsor the circuit in 1976. Turville continued as the Tour Director until 1979. Today, there are no longer any satellite circuits like The WATCH, but maybe there should be a call for one like the one that Larry Turville and Armistead Neely began.\n\nHunt’s great-nephew, Joseph (Joe) T. Hunt grew up playing tennis in Santa Barbara, California. He is now an attorney practicing in Seattle, Washington and he takes advantage of opportunities to get on the court regularly. More important, he has led the family’s effort to ensure that Joe Hunt isn’t forgotten.\n\n“I have to really spend some time to gather my thoughts on what the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of Joe’s victory means,” he said. “I have so many of them. Joe was a patriot from what is considered the greatest generation of our nation. He is the only American tennis champion to lose his life serving his country in a time of war. We lost him so early and so young. He never had a chance to reach his full potential, yet he accomplished so much by the age of 25. He was a remarkable young man, devoted to tennis, devoted to his family and devoted to his country. The family lost him, and tennis lost him. Over time, while the family continued to grieve the loss of our uncle, brother and son, tennis seemed to forget and not consider the meaning of this loss to the game.”\n\nTennis historians credit Kramer for developing the “Big Game” – meaning being a serve and volleyer. According to Bobby Riggs, a contemporary of his, Hunt used the tactic before the iconic Kramer.\n\n“As maybe the first true serve and volleyer, Joe was changing the game itself,” his great nephew said. “He never had a chance to tell his story from his perspective. I feel I have been his only voice in trying to tell the tennis world who he really was and what we all lost.”\n\nThe original Joe Hunt was one-of-a-kind not only because of his athletic ability, but also because of his blond good looks and his marvelous charisma. As a junior, he was a star, winning the National Boys’ 15 and 18 titles. By the age of 17, his success on court earned him a US Top 10 ranking. In 1938, he was USC’s top player and didn’t lose a singles or doubles match. He enlisted and transferred to the US Naval Academy. In 1940, he was a halfback (American football) and played against Army that season, earning a game ball for his outstanding performance. The next year, he became the only competitor [ever] from the Naval Academy to win the NCAA singles championship.\n\n​\n\nHunt continued, “Joe went out for football at the Naval Academy because he loved that sport too. He also wanted to be part of a team. He was the most famous player on the football team by a mile, and it wasn’t for football.” But, with all his stardom, he spent the hot summer and chilly fall getting pushed into the mud by seasoned players who wanted to make sure he knew he was no ‘star’ on their field. And he was fine with that. When he had the choice of skipping football practice so that he could play Forest Hills and possibly win it, he went to football practice. He would not let his teammates down, even though he was destined to spend more time on the bench than on the field as a backup running back. But, those on the football team respected him for it. They knew Joe’s tennis hands and legs were Davis Cup commodities and they saw Joe give them up for the team they were on. That is why they gave him the game ball for the 1941 Army Navy game, and every teammate signed it for him.\n\n“Now, after seventy-five years, the last remnants of the greatest generation are bidding farewell, and we as a nation are at a moment of moral truth. How are we to say goodbye to them? How are we to remember and honor them? How are we to protect their legacy of saving the world for future generations? Each soul lost in the war effort is a part of that legacy. How will tennis address this? We just saw a great remembrance of the return of the bodies of men who gave their lives in the Korean War. Bringing home, the bodies after so many years was hugely significant to the families and the nation. I think of Joe’s body, never recovered, at the bottom of the Atlantic with his plane. It’s a sadness our family still bears.”\n\nThe times were unparalleled, which makes it no surprise that an unmatched backstory resulted. “I know that Joe was not the only player to not have a chance to defend his title, because Ted (Schroeder) won it in 1942 and was not able to defend in 1943,”Hunt pointed out. “They both were Navy fliers stationed in Pensacola, Florida. Neither was granted leave to play Forest Hills so they both entered the local Pensacola tournament held at the same time as the National Championships. Of course, the local tennis community couldn’t believe their lucky stars to have the 1942 and the 1943 champions playing in the tournament. It was billed as the ‘Clash of Net Champions’ and would supposedly determine the true No. 1 player in the country, despite that ‘other’ tournament taking place in New York. Joe and Ted both reached the final where ‘urban legend’ has it that they played their match in front of thousands on September 4, 1944, while Frank Parker was playing Bill Talbert in the final of Forest Hills (and winning 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3). I have spent hours trying to vet the truth of this story. I know that it is true, I just don’t know if it is 100% true that the two finals were played simultaneously. In any event, Joe beat Ted 6-4, 6-4. Despite what many have written, this was, in fact, the last tournament match of Joe’s life.”\n\nSeventy-five years was too long ago to remember for most of us. Memories and treasures from that time are scattered here and there. Some are lost forever. In the case of Joe Hunt, his accomplishments, along with the individual himself, should not be left covered in dust and diminished by the passage of time.\n\nGreat nephew Joe Hunt said, “I think of a young man who stood for literally everything that is true and good in sport. An amateur who wasn’t seeking to profit off his game. He left his immensely successful life in Southern California to enter the Naval Academy, knowing that it would literally make it near impossible to achieve his dreams as a tennis champion. He intrinsically understood sportsmanship, camaraderie and good will. Everyone loved Joe. He played for all he was worth, but never took a ‘win at all costs’ approach to tennis. He put the right things ahead of the game.”\n\nThe motion picture, “Green Book,” which recently won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2018, reopened the public’s eyes and hearts when it was released last fall. The movie tells the story of an African-American pianist, Don Shirley (played by Oscar winner Mahershala Ali) and his white driver/bodyguard, Tony Vallelonga (played by Viggo Mortensen) as they undertake an eight-week concert tour through the south during the Jim Crow days of 1962.\n\nAs February—and Black History Month—come to a close, it’s an appropriate time to look back at the happenings and heroes of that time—not all that long ago.\n\n“The Negro Motorist Green Book” was first published in 1936. It was designed to provide African–Americans with tips on how to avoid discrimination in their travels, when it came to places to stay, dine or even how to find welcoming roadways on which to journey. In essence, it was the travel bible used by countless individuals and families as they drove the North American highways and byways – not just in the South.\n\nFew realize that tennis had its own Green Book. The information was never published; rather, it was more of a word-of-mouth sharing, as those in the know offered insight for African-American players as they drove from place to place in order to play American Tennis Association (ATA) National Championships and other tournaments.\n\n“When the Green Book movie came out, I began recalling the days of my travel from Southern California with Mrs. (Eleese) Thornton and Earthna Jacquet, who was an outstanding player,” said Beverly Coleman, whose talent as a Southern California junior player put her on the road at a young age to compete in a variety of tournaments. “I was only 15 and travel was new to me. I did not have to make the arrangements or plans – Mrs. Thornton did all that.”\n\nYou see, for Coleman’s journeys—and for the travel of so many others—Thornton served as a living Green Book. An all-around athlete, Thornton (pictured above, third from left, with Roumania Peters, Eoline Thornton and Margaret Peters) was born and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. As a youngster, she ran track, played women’s baseball and was an accomplished bowler. She was introduced to travel at a young age, spending summers with her aunt in Colorado. In 1926, Thornton, along with two of her best friends, moved to Los Angeles. After eleven years in her new home town, 1937 to be exact, she taught herself to play tennis. A few years later, she entered her first tournament, the ATA Championships, held in Orangeburg, South Carolina, where she won the Women’s 40 singles.\n\nColeman points out, “All I knew [when we traveled] was that homes for us to stay in – with tennis enthusiasts, or relatives—were lined up. People anxiously awaited the arrival of ‘the great ones’ who were driving all the way from California to ‘champion’ their local ATA tennis events. As is the custom throughout the south, our hosts prepared elaborate and filling meals for us.”\n\nAs a junior, Coleman was touted as the “next Althea (Gibson).” She went on to become a successful adult competitor, but she, like so many others, never became another Althea. Instead, Coleman focused her attentions on both healing and mental health. A resident of Sedona, Arizona for the past 24 years, she now draws on what she calls on her, “giving back experiences with Thornton,” as she operates Beverly Coleman’s Wellness Services, where she practices acupuncture, and provides herbal and wellness care advise.\n\nJean Richardson, who is now in her 90s, was talking with her good friend, Delores Simmons, a long-time Los Angeles based community tennis activist, about her experiences traveling with Thornton. Richardson told Simmons that their first trip together was to Albuquerque, New Mexico, “where Eleese had friends who took us in—as did their friends.” Over the years, they traveled to several other tournament locations throughout the country, and at every stop, Thornton would make the arrangements, ensuring a warm and welcoming reception for the young competitors. Richardson said, “Eleese always had friends that took care of us….”\n\nAs Coleman brought up, (and Richardson verified), “Eleese was the person who made all of the plans. In her ‘notes’, she had information about families that would provide housing.” Simmons, who knew Thornton well, noted, “She logged thousands of miles by car driving across the country to play tournaments. She knew so many people.”\n\nFor players of color, making a “road trip” during the Jim Crow era was very different than going on an excursion today. Looking back, Richardson told Simmons, “When we were on the road and got tired, we would pull over and sleep for short periods. At night, we often would go to gas stations, park in the back and sleep in the car. The next morning, we would use the facilities, wash up and continue on our way.\n\n“While we were in different cities, we met people that would offer us housing, so we were able to build friendships and enjoyed the hospitality of the tennis community.”\n\nSimmons admits, “Everyone understood the racial climate. The black community knew it well and this made the tennis community receptive to the tennis players coming to town.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just in the Deep South where blacks felt the ugly hand of discrimination. Simmons says, “My parents were from Marshalltown, Iowa. My mother told me many stories about folks who stayed in her parents’ home when she was young. My grandfather worked on the railroad and the family had a large house, so when black entertainers came to town some stayed with them. The Mills Brothers did. I remember, as a teen, seeing a calendar with the picture of a man who became president of a black college and showed my mother. She said, ‘He lived with us for a while when he came to Marshalltown. Blacks couldn't even stay at the hotel downtown; they only worked as maids there.’ So, you see, it was not only in the south that discrimination was alive and well.”\n\nColeman recalled, “As a junior I also occasionally stayed at the local Black college dorms and did the same thing when my Tennessee State A&I tennis team traveled through the south. We stayed on campus.\n\n“I have only one recollection of direct confrontation with white culture. It happened when we once had to go to the back of a restaurant and order our food ‘to go.’ I remember always having food in a cooler in the car – how it got there I don’t recall except that my parents had contributed money to Mrs. Thornton for my trip expenses. My mom regularly made a big box of food for us because we were aware that black people had difficulty getting food and accommodations on the road. We slept in the car while the two adults took turns sleeping and driving.\n\n“Now, as I recall, I used to hear the black tennis players saying they often slept in their cars when they travelled the tennis circuit; that is, unless they knew someone who offered them a place to stay. I never heard them mention the Green Book.”\n\nBut to this day, many people of color who spent time on America’s highways as youth playing the sport that they loved will mention Eleese Thornton—a pioneer who became an icon to those she helped and to the sport that she loved. She was indeed a living, breathing “Green Book,” who worked tirelessly to help assure that those who wanted to compete in tennis could compete wherever they chose to.\n\nAs Simmons says, “For Eleese, tennis was life.”\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the Open Era in grand slam tennis, a former player talks about his experience at Roland Garros in 1968.\n\nThe entire month of May, in Paris, fifty-years ago was a memorable and perplexing time. The local civil disturbance led by university students and workers eventually enveloped the entire country and nearly brought France to a virtual standstill. The police used heavy handed tactics in an attempt to clear the Paris streets of all of those who were seeking “individual rights”. (In truth, the reasons for the uproar were much more complex.) French President Charles de Gaulle stood strong and refused to resign. He finally decided to disband the National Assembly and hold elections on June 23rd. Though the voting made his Gaullist Party even stronger as it earned 353 of the 486 legislative seats that were available, de Gaulle lost. The French people made it clear that they believed the World War II hero had grown too old, too egocentric and much too out of touch with the times to continue as their leader.\n\nWhile the riots were raging, tennis history was being made. Roland Garros, contested from May 27 until June 9, 1968, was equally revolutionary. It was the first Grand Championship of the Open Era. Allen Fox took a break from completing his Ph.D. in psychology at UCLA in Westwood, California to play the tournament. (It is ironic that the tumult in the work places provided the people of Paris with free time and looking for a diversion, they came in record numbers to Stade Roland Garros.)\n\n​\n\nThe recollections of Fox, a regular U.S. Top 10 performer, offer “looking back” insight on a period when the game, much as the world as a whole, dramatically changed its course.\n\nIn his first-round match at Roland Garros, Fox routed Alfredo Acuna of Peru 6-2, 6-1, 6-0. “Alfredo was a great guy and became a good friend of mine”, he remembered. “He actually became the best player in Peru, but he was young then, and I was especially tough on young, inexperienced players. I don’t think I realized how good he was, so I was loose and confident. I always played matches at 100%, so I wasn’t about to ease up on him in a major championship.”\n\nJohn Alexander was Fox’s next opponent. Soon to be 17, he was an Australian star in the making. “He was young and talented, and though I didn’t realize it at the time, I was slightly over the hill by 1968. But I thought I would beat him anyway because the clay slowed his attacking game down.”\n\nAs a UCLA undergraduate, Fox was a three-time All-American, between 1959 and ‘61. He won the NCAA doubles title with UCLA teammate Larry Nagler in 1960 and was the singles champion in 1961. While these are impressive tennis statistics, he was more fulfilled by his academic accomplishments. As a senior, he earned All-UCLA and All-University of California Athlete of the Year honors, which were presented to the Best Scholar-Athlete in the University of California system.\n\nWith all his “educational smarts”, Fox made a critically bad choice the night prior to his match with Alexander. He recalled, “I had never played him before. But I went out the night before the match and ate sausages and sauerkraut for dinner. Then I was up all night with diarrhea and vomiting. It was a hot day, and by the fifth set I was starting to cramp. I played ‘within myself’ to avoid the cramps, but when I got an easy volley and put it away for double match point, I got excited and really cramped. I was up 40-15 on my serve and laying on the court with cramps all over my body. Alexander was kind enough to give me five minutes to work them out, which I barely did. When I was finally able to serve, I ‘pushed’ it in. He returned it and came to net, and I choked on a backhand passing shot. On the next point, I came to net and he lobbed. I couldn’t jump, so I just stood there as the low lob simply went over my head. At 6-6, I finally had to retire”.\n\nThe score that went into the Roland Garros record book was 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 11-9, 6-6, Retired. Fox added, “I was lucky I didn’t end up in the hospital. I was so dehydrated.”\n\nHe made his Roland Garros debut in 1965, and explained, “That was the year I traveled with Donald (Dell, who would go on to found ProServ, the agency that represented players like Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith and Jimmy Connors to name just a few of his clients). We spent six months in Europe and six months in Africa.”\n\nIn his first match, Fox played Billy Knight of Great Britain in the second round, (because both players had first round byes). After winning the first set 6-0, Knight took control and closed things out, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. “I don’t remember all the details, but I do remember that he had a big topspin forehand, flaming red hair, and moved fast around the court. As an aside, I generally liked playing lefties (as Knight was) because they served into my backhand which was my best side, and they tended to slice their backhands (which Knight did) and I could get to the net attacking that side. Clearly, it didn’t do me much good against him.”\n\nIn 1966, a year later, Fox accomplished a never to be equaled triumph. Having just begun graduate school at UCLA, he rode his motorcycle each day from the university to the Los Angeles Tennis Club, in West Los Angeles, to participate in the Pacific Southwest. Eight of the world’s top 10 players were in the draw, and he scored a “personal Grand Slam” defeating Wimbledon champion Manuel Santana, Roland Garros titleist Tony Roche, U.S. National winner Fred Stolle and Australian titleholder, Roy Emerson. (The tournament was held annually the week following the U.S. National Championships in Forest Hills, New York, and Los Angeles served a stop-over for Australian and other international players who had played at Forest Hills and were on their way home.)\n\n“In the round of 16, I played Santana,” Fox said. “It was a hot and smoggy day. I had grown up in Los Angeles, so I had ‘leather lungs’. I won a close first set, and Manuel didn’t have much left in the second. I look on it as a ‘cheap victory’.”\n\nRoche was next up. “I started very well and began feeling I could play with these guys,” Fox noted. “I won the first set and was up 4-1 in the second and serving, when ‘the incident’ took place. On the first point, I hit the best backhand passing shot I had ever hit. On the next point, he hit a return and I scraped a backhand volley off my shoestrings. I hit it up the line and it was just in. Roche got to the ball and hit it two yards wide. In those days, the linesmen called the line through the length of the court. The guy making the call went into some sort of ‘psychic trance’ and signaled my shot was good. He forgot to call Roche’s out. The umpire, thinking the lineman had called Roche’s shot good, said the score was 15 – 15. I went crazy. I started jumping up and down in protest. Roche, who is one of the classiest guys you will ever meet, walked up to me and said, ‘I’ll throw you the next point’. I said, ‘next point, I want the next two, I should be up 30 – 0’. I really wanted to win the match because the semifinal was going to be on television and it would be seen in Los Angeles.”\n\nAfter downing Roche in straight sets. Fox, who was half way through his own Grand Slam, faced Stolle in the semifinals. He remembered, “For whatever reason, I used to beat him regularly. Though the public considered me the underdog, I was confident. I had defeated him the year before at the Southwest, and felt I was the favorite. Because I was so confident, I didn’t play well. I played safe. It was a ‘hold on’ win.”\n\nWith another straight set victory in hand, Emerson was his final round opponent. “Prior to the start of the match, I would have bet a lot of money he would beat me,” Fox admitted. “He won the toss and elected to receive, figuring I would be tight. I won the game at love. In a short time, I realized I was playing very well. He had a tough serve, yet I would hold mine at 15 and would take him to deuce or have ads. The ball seemed to be coming ‘so slow’ I could do whatever I wanted. Years later I realized I was in what people have called ‘the zone’.”\n\nFox won the first set 6-3 and was up 5-3 with Emerson serving in the second. “I did get a bit nervous in this game,” he recalled. “I got the score to deuce and he served wide. I was outside the doubles alley and bunted back a chest high return that he volleyed into the open court. Ordinarily with Emerson, on a shot like that, the point was over, and you just moved to the other side to receive his next serve. But I ran it down, my legs were moving with lightning speed, and threw up a very high lob. He was on the sunny side [of the court] and missed it.\n\n​“On my first match point, he ran a serve off the line and I hit the return into the net. On the second deuce, he served wide again, I just got my racquet on it, ran his volley down, tossed up another very high lob and he missed the overhead again. After missing his first serve, he played it safe spinning the second one in. It was short, and I really hit it. He ran wide, just got to the ball and floated a ‘duck’ back to me at mid-court. I remember running to the ball thinking I will never, in my life, have an easier shot to win the Pacific Southwest. I also remember not being able to feel my arm. I was so tight, but I hit the ball as hard as I could with as much top spin as possible. Thank God it went in.”\n\nFox remembered, “The crowd went wild. I got a standing ovation because I was such an underdog.”\n\nAfter he completed his education, Fox became a widely recognized sports psychologist, and has worked with a host of players on the tour. He authored a number of highly respected books including “Think to Win: The Strategic Dimension of Tennis”, “If I’m The Better Player, Why Can’t I Win?”, and “The Winner’s Mind: A Competitor’s Guide to Sports and Business Success.” He also served as the men’s tennis coach at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, for 17 years. Among the performers he guided were Brad Gilbert, Kelly Jones and Martin Laurendeau, former Canadian Davis Cup team captain and current coach of Denis Shapovalov.\n\n​\n\n“Looking back for players like (Rod) Laver, (Ken) Rosewall and (Richard “Pancho”) Gonzalez, Roland Garros in 1968 was very important,” Fox concluded. “It was significant because they had been excluded for so long. Now, all the good players could compete. The reaction of the amateurs was simple. With Open Tennis, there were more good players to worry about.”\n\nFifty years may seem like a very long time when one is young and hopeful. Looking back on those years is a curious mix of eye-opening reminders of a life well lived and every step that it took to arrive at today. The Terre Battue of Roland Garros was the red carpet that opened the door to countless players who spent years perfecting their skills and now, today’s players are able to take full advantage for their labors. Open Tennis provided that platform, and it all began fifty years ago.\n\n1960s U.S. Indoor Tennis at Its Finest\n\nW. Newton Jackson, III\n\n​twohandforehand@gmail.com\n\n​November 2018\n\nBeginning in 1964, the U.S. National Men’s Indoor Tennis Tournament was held in Salisbury, Maryland on the Delmarva Peninsula. Bill Riordan, a local merchant and transplanted New Yorker, had convinced the United States Lawn Tennis Association (as it was then called) to move the tournament from its site at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in New York City while that facility underwent renovations. The move was intended to be for only one year, but the tournament met with so much success in Salisbury that it stayed for over a decade.\n\n​Every February for a dozen or so years, Salisbury took on a festive air when players from all over the world, including Chuck McKinley, Dennis Ralston, Manuel Santana, Cliff Richey, Arthur Ashe, Rafael Osuna, Thomas Koch, Stan Smith, Tom Okker, Jimmy Connors, Ilie Nastase, and Manuel Orantes—just to name several out of hundreds—arrived to play on the two canvas courts strapped to the floor of the Quonset-hut wooden civic center. The 32-man singles draw began play on a Sunday, and the singles and doubles finals took place on the following Sunday.\n\nThe viewing of matches was spectacular, because the bleachers practically touched the outside lines of the courts. Most of the players stayed with host families. Local kids acted as ball boys. The Jaycees acted as ushers. High school students came in buses from school to watch afternoon matches. Each night there was a tournament party at one locale or another, and, from some accounts, they were bacchanalian affairs.\n\n​In 1965, the men’s singles draw listed one William C. Higgins, Jr of Lawton, Oklahoma. He played Francisco Gúzman of Ecuador in the first round. I do not know how Billy fared in the tournament, but, even if he had gotten through the first few rounds, he would have had to face McKinley, who won the tournament in 1964, as well as Wimbledon in 1963.\n\n​One thing Billy Higgins did accomplish in Salisbury that February was to meet a local girl and, at some stage in their relationship, leave her in kindle. (For those unread in British literature, this expression has nothing to do with the software used to read e-books.) In any event, Billy and Jill married, and she and the baby followed him throughout the U.S. and Europe while he played the tour. In 1969, he was ranked 25th in U.S. men’s tennis—an excellent tennis player by all accounts.\n\n​Moving forward to 23 October 1976, on that beautiful Saturday afternoon the undersigned was playing doubles in a tournament called the Salisbury State College Open. My partner and I had gotten through the first round and in the second round were to play C.J. Travers, a local teaching pro, and someone by the name of Billy Higgins. When I saw the draw sheet, I said to myself, “No, it couldn’t be.” Sure enough…when I walked onto the court, it was the Okie from Lawton (not Muskogee) and sure enough…out we went 6-0, 6-1. (I was able to hold serve one time.)\n\nBilly and his partner eventually won the tournament, to no one’s surprise.\n\n​The point is not to suggest that Billy Higgins’s career was in a state of decline because he was playing in a local tournament or that I had ascended to Mount Olympus to hurl lightning bolts at the other tennis gods. Rather, Billy happened to be in Salisbury because his in-laws lived here: he was visiting them; and he wanted to get a little tennis in.\n\n​Moving forward into the 1980s, I got to know a fellow by the name of Jim Bochte, who was the summer-time tennis professional at Buck Hill Falls in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. One day I happened to ask him if he had ever heard of Billy Higgins. He got a big smile on his face and spent the next hour talking about him—all favorable. Every summer when I returned to Buck Hill, he would ask me if I had seen Billy, which unfortunately I hadn’t.\n\n​Jumping still forward to 2012, I was playing in a USTA-sanctioned, 65-and-over clay court tournament at Belle Haven Country Club in Alexandria, Virginia and had made it through the first round. Afterwards, the club pro Steve Fiske introduced me to my second-round opponent, David Schermerhorn, who was living in Colorado. Unknown to me, David had grown up in Oklahoma. I launched into my “Okie from Lawton” story, and he quickly said, “That’s where I’m from, and Billy Higgins was one of my brother’s best friend growing up.”\n\n​Small world, indeed"
