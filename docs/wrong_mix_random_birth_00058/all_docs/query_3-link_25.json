        "text": "Top seed Roger Federer overcame an error-filled first set to beat former world No1 Lleyton Hewitt 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 in the third round of the US Open today.\n\nFederer recovered from a sloppy period and a fall to extend his winning streak at Flushing Meadows to 37 matches.\n\nFederer is trying to become the first man since Bill Tilden in 1920-25 to win six consecutive titles at the American grand slam tournament.\n\nUp a break and serving at 4-2, 40-0, Federer ran into trouble, spraying shots all over the place. Hewitt, whose two major championships include the 2001 US Open, took advantage and claimed the opening set. But Federer turned things around to take the final two sets of the match with relative ease and he now has defeated Hewitt 14 times consecutively.\n\nFourth seed Novak Djokovic survived a scare at the hands of American qualifier Jesse Witten as he also reached the fourth round.\n\nThe Serb was playing the world No276, and lost the first set and his temper in front of a Louis Armstrong Stadium crowd who were firmly and vocally behind the American underdog.\n\nBut Djokovic regrouped and eventually won 6-7 (2/7) 6-3 7-6 (7/2) 6-4.\n\nUS Open, third round results:\n\nMS: : (1) Roger Federer (Swi) bt (31) Lleyton Hewitt (Aus) 4-6 6-3 7-5 6-4\n\nMS: (4) Novak Djokovic (Ser) bt Jesse Witten (USA) 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 7-6 (7-2) 6-4\n\nMS: (15) Radek Stepanek (Cze) bt (23) Philipp Kohlschreiber (Ger) 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3\n\nMS: (8) Nikolay Davydenko (Rus) bt Marco Chiudinelli (Swi) 6-4 7-5 7-5"
