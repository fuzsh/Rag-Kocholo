        "text": "Do you think things are a bit slower on the courts?\n\nSE: It's hard to tell. I've been looking a little bit at the matches here. Obviously there is a lot of tennis played form the back of the court but they do it well and they do what they can and what they do best, but it has changed a little bit over the years, everybody has to agree with that and it's not easy serving and volleying out there\n\nWhat do you think about the absence of serve and volleyers? BB: Well in my opinion, Stefan in his good days would serve and volley and so would I, its a question that you don't have many playing it all year round. You saw the match with Roddick and Agassi - it was still a very fast and powerful game, so if you've got the weapons you are still going to use them. But in general, the yes is played more from the back and you've got more rallies, and it doesn't really matter if you play on clay or grass or on hard courts, guys like to rally.\n\nSE: It could go in cycles, that has been in the past. There were a lot of serve volleyers at one time and now they are playing from the back of the court and hopefully it will change a little bit. I think what is needed is a contrast of different styles, it makes the game a little bit interesting, I think, because usually the best games you watch is an aggressive player playing against a defensive player, where you have a lot of movement up and down, forwards on the court, that could help. I think what has changed also is that the guys return a lot better today than the used to do. If a guy had a big serve 15, 20 years ago you would automatically step back one or two steps to get more time, today they don't, they stand at the same place and they react so much faster. That is the difference.\n\nWhat do you think of the way Andre Agassi is still going?\n\nSE: To me it's astonishing. He is playing some great tennis, he's 33. It's quite amazing. If you look back in history it has been quite difficult to win grand slams once you pass 30 years of age but he's proven you can do it. He's probably one of these exceptions that come once in a while, he can stay focused on what he is doing, he's enjoying what he's doing and he's working out hard and still got the power to do it. I'm very impressed to say the least.\n\nBB: The big difference between his career and our careers is that we produced every year, we were in the top five or top two, Agassi for a number of years he was gone, he wasn't playing, back to '97, he was ranked 150 in the world, basically not playing, giving up tennis so that gave him a couple of years from his body and game wise. When Stefan retired in '97, and I a year later, we had for the last 12 years played our 60, 70, 80 matches on the top level, and sooner or later that is going to catch up and eventually it did at 30 years of age. That's the difference with Andre, he saved himself a little bit with his career.\n\nIs there one favourite for you for Wimbledon?\n\nBB: No. There are a number of favourites, you have to always go with the defending champion first, that's Lleyton Hewitt. He's not up to his level he was last year, he was the number one favourite, then you have Agassi, through his performances this week Andy Roddick and I would usually always say Pete Sampras but he is not around this year, so that's a first. I think nit's pretty open. The last couple of years you had two, three, four guys who were definite favourites, this year I find it far more open than in previous years.\n\nIn the women's I have to go with the Williams sisters. Clay is a different story but on grass with their power, and also the fact that they haven't won in the last couple of weeks or month, a major. It probably makes them more determined to come back and win again, but we'll see.\n\nSE: I totally agree with Boris on what he says for both the men and the women sides. That's the predication from me too.\n\nAny outsiders you fancy?\n\nSE: Not from me. I haven't particularly watched a lot of tennis on television. No one that I can come up with. What about you Boris?\n\nBB: I like the young Croatian (Mario) Ancic. I think he has shown not only last year beating (Roger) Federer but this year giving Andre a good run for his money at the French, he could be up for a couple more rounds this year, plus Roddick, the guy is only 20 years old and he hasn't produced his major tennis at a Grand Slam but he's about ready now.\n\nRoger Federer has failed to deliver at a Grand Slam, what about him?\n\nBB: I actually forgot to mention his name because he is the most naturally gifted played around and he can play on any surface. The fact that he has been winning Masters Series events, so not producing in a Grand Slam must make him upset. He's one of the top four favourites I would consider to win Wimbledon.\n\nSE: I've seen him play and I agree with Boris. He has the potential to win, no question about it. He's got the talent but maybe there is something up there missing as of now but once he cracks it and gets into a groove and starts winning matches it will end (not performing) pretty quickly at the next few Grand Slams.\n\nHow do you see things with Lleyton Hewitt at the moment?\n\nBB: Every number one goes through a dry spell. It was in Stefan's career and it was in my career. It's just natural. Your opponents read your game better. It's far more pressure producing it the second or third time around than the first time around. You as a young man grow older, have a girlfriend and all the distractions that take a little bit away from it, but eventually you come through and that's the same with Lleyton. He is a very, very talented young player, got the right attitude, loves tennis, loves to win and he will be back winning. It's just a question of time but as of now he's maybe 10% off from last year.\n\nDo you really think that's the case seeing that he's won Scottsdale and Indian Wells, won at Davis Cup and all three matches at the World Team Cup and while he struggled at Queen's, he still got through a couple of matches.\n\nBB: The problem being ranked number one or the current Wimbledon champion, you're level is there (showing how high). He didn't win the Australian, he didn't win the French, he's not number one on Monday (week before Wimbledon) and that's what you measure it on. He's still one of the very best of the game but there is only room for one number one, and he's not that anymore because his level has just dropped a few percent and that means he will lose in a semifinal or a final. That doesn't mean he's bad, by no means.\n\nIn your opinion why do you think the over-35s circuit hasn't been a success, is it too expensive to stage, should they be promoted before a regular tour event, what?\n\nBB: I have played them so maybe I should answer. The problem is that it was run by (Jimmy) Connors and he happens to be 50 now, and (John) McEnroe took over and he's 44. It's basically now in our hands and when we do hold a tournament in an environment that loves tennis, and as you said, in front of a major tournament, it's very successful. I was playing for two days with John and Patrick McEnroe in Hamburg and we had 24,000 people over two days. I played Michael Stich in Halle and we had 12,500, and I think if Stefan and myself played anywhere in the world we would get as many. You need to get the right people and the right format to play one another and then there's a chance. Then again it has a lot to do with who's hosting it and who's responsible and who's speaking with what and whom ... so, you are talking about politics here and this is not our forte.\n\nToday's tennis: serve and folly\n\nBaseline boomers make a mockery of game's bygone artistry\n\nBY LINDA ROBERTSON\n\nlrobertson@herald.com (Miami Herald)\n\nThe serve-and-volley game has gone the way of the curtsy.\n\nAt Wimbledon, the cradle of tennis, both are being discarded as old-fashioned and unnecessary. Beautiful when properly executed, but antique.\n\nFor the first time in Wimbledon's 117-year history, starting Monday, players will no longer be required to bow or dip to the Royal Box when entering and exiting Centre Court, unless Queen Elizabeth II or Prince Charles is present.\n\nAnd, at this temple of the fast-paced grass-court game, fewer players will be charging the net than ever before.\n\n''It's sad,'' said Martina Navratilova, one of the sport's premier serve-and-volleyers who has watched tennis change radically during her career. ``Too many of today's players stay back in their comfort zone on the baseline instead of being brave. It's become a homogenized game.''\n\nIn 1975, when Navratilova turned pro, six of the top 10 women served and volleyed more often than not: Navratilova, Virginia Wade, Billie Jean King, Evonne Goolagong, Margaret Court and Olga Morozova.\n\nIn 1974, when the U.S. Open was still contested on grass, six of the top 10 men also went to the net urgently and frequently: Arthur Ashe, Ilie Nastase, Rod Laver, John Newcombe, Tom Okker and Stan Smith.\n\nBut by the mid-1990s, players such as Jana Novotna and Patrick Rafter were considered throwbacks, speakers of an ancient and dying language.\n\nOn Monday, when matches commence at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, no men or women in the top 10 are serve-and-volley practitioners.\n\nWithout the inactive Pete Sampras and the newly retired Richard Krajicek, there is concern that the men's final could be similar to the blah baseline duel of 2002, when Lleyton Hewitt defeated David Nalbandian in three sets. Hope springs eternal that elegant attacker and four-time semifinalist Tim Henman could revive the fortunes of England (which has not produced a men's singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936) and the serve and volley. Among the women considered contenders, only Lisa Raymond is a true serve-and-volley player, and she's a long shot.\n\nCUTTING THE GRASS\n\nThe ideal serve-and-volley surface is on the way out\n\n''People used to design their games to win on grass,'' said former pro Mary Carillo. ``I wish grass would make a comeback. It would teach players a forward game, a more artful game.''\n\nDespite nostalgic sighs about the evolution of tennis into a game for grinding groundstrokers, it is true that the serve-and-volley style does not reap the rewards it used to. There are fewer grass tournaments. Surfaces are slower. Rackets are bigger. Balls are heavier. Grips have moved from Eastern to Western and one-handed to two-handed as booming topspin has replaced the deft slice. Singles players don't play doubles as often, thus dulling their volleying skills. Kids are taught to hit hard and be patient rather than risk being passed at the net.\n\nWhere have you gone, Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker? Oh, for the edge-of-the-seat contrasting styles of John McEnroe-Jimmy Connors matches. The lunges, the reflexes, the overheads -- rare indeed.\n\nEven the hallowed grass at Wimbledon has changed. Since the club switched to 100 percent of the more durable, springier rye grass two years ago, players have said it feels more like a hard court. They say that instead of skidding low, the ball bounces higher, giving them more reaction time.\n\n''They made the grass longer so the serve doesn't come through as fast,'' Navratilova said by phone from England. ``It was no accident that two baseliners played in the men's final last year. If they want Henman to win, they better cut the grass.''\n\nEddie Seaward, Wimbledon's head groundsman, said the club never intended to slow down the game, only to utilize advances by the Turf Research Institute in Yorkshire, which cultivated a longer-wearing grass.\n\n''I don't know why players have said we tried to slow things down,'' he said Thursday by phone. ``No one has mentioned it this year during practice, so maybe last year was a [off one]. If the weather leading in is warm and dry, the ball does bounce higher. Right now, the bounce is quite nice and firm.''\n\nSeaward said his Toro lawn mowers are set to keep the grass precisely 8 millimeters high (slightly higher than a quarter of an inch) and there is no manipulation to suit certain styles of play.\n\nHe would like to see more players embrace grass rather than regard it as an intimidating anachronism. Now that hardier, low-maintenance grasses can be installed, he'd also like to see growth in the number of grass courts worldwide. He doesn't want Wimbledon to become a dinosaur.\n\n''It's a case of producing a court players are comfortable on, where they can play their shots and keep their footing,'' he said. ``We want to encourage the clay-court players to compete here. The revival of grass will only come if we can make the players happy.''\n\nPlayers used to learn on grass, and the French Open used to be the only Grand Slam not contested on grass. But today the grass-court season is just five weeks long, concluding with the Hall of Fame tournament in Newport, R.I., where the 13 grass courts are the only ones open continuously to the public in the United States. It just doesn't pay for a pro to be a serve-and-volley specialist.\n\n''As tennis moved away from its country-club image, grass courts became less practical,'' said Pam Shriver, who recalled that when she turned pro in 1978, Chris Evert was an anomaly as a baseliner. ``If someone sees a grass court now, it's like seeing a celebrity. They want to touch it and walk barefoot on it. It has such a magical, mystical quality to it.''\n\nCHANGING THE PACE\n\n`They slowed the courts down,and we saw baseliners emerge'\n\nNot only did grass die out, but clay became more popular, fast indoor courts less popular, and hard courts were slowed down when additional sand was mixed in during resurfacing.\n\n''There was a period when the game was so fast and there were so many aces that people complained they never saw any rallies; they got sick and tired of wham-bam tennis,'' said Francisco Montana, a former pro and now a U.S. Tennis Association high-performance coach in Key Biscayne. ``They slowed the courts down, and we saw the aggressive baseliners emerge. With the 10-inch racket heads and topspin grips, they can really swing full out.''\n\nTodd Martin, who joins Taylor Dent as the United States' most prominent serve-and-volleyers, says the leaders of tennis tinkered too much.\n\n''They overcompensated by slowing down the courts and the ball,'' he said. ``At Wimbledon, the ball went from a lemon to a grapefruit in a year. It would be a more entertaining sport to watch and play if we could go back and find a compromise between where we were and where we are.''\n\nYoung players coached to smack roundhouse groundstrokes need to diversify, said Navratilova, who also favors shrinking rackets by an inch.\n\n''Kids are hitting it harder than they should at an earlier age,'' she said. ``They don't have the wrist strength and reaction time to volley properly when they are little. They could perfect it later, but by then they are glued to the baseline. However, now the savvy coaches see that everybody hits the groundstrokes well, so what is the dividing factor? Rushing the net can set a player apart.''\n\nCarillo and McEnroe learned under Australian Harry Hopman.\n\n''I was taught that by applying positional pressure on your opponent to make a great return you eventually will win more matches at the net than at the baseline,'' Carillo said. ``I remember how Chrissie [Evert] would come in, get passed, shake her head and retreat to the baseline, but we were taught to keep on coming. Chipping to the opponent's backhand was my bread-and-butter play. Now players have bazooka backhands, and I'd get killed.''\n\nBy the end of her career, Shriver had trouble volleying her opponents' service returns. Their forehands and backhands were too good.\n\nLESSONS FOR TODAY\n\nPlayers could enhance power games with serve and volley\n\nGiven the vast improvement in groundstrokes, the best strategy is to use the serve and volley as a weapon, Montana says.\n\nHe advocates devoting at least 15 percent of practice time to it so players can pull it out of their pocket and rattle an opponent during a match. Andy Roddick, Roger Federer, Amelie Mauresmo, Justine Henin-Hardenne and Venus and Serena Williams are often mentioned as pros who could develop dangerous serve-and-volley dimensions. The women, with the exception of Serena, need to develop stronger serves.\n\n''The players do strike the ball better now, but the game can still be won at the net,'' said Zina Garrison, Wimbledon finalist in 1990. ``Last year at Wimbledon, when Serena really needed some points, she came to the net. You have to be ready to think offensively.''\n\nCarillo and Martin point out that serving and volleying is more efficient -- and lengthens careers.\n\n''Players play more tennis per point than they need to these days,'' Carillo said. ``The constant hard hitting and the concussive effect of the hard courts is also tearing up bodies.''\n\nMartin leads a growing chorus of players who want a longer grass-court season and more than a fortnight between the clay French Open and Wimbledon. Bjorn Borg was the last male to win French and Wimbledon titles in the same year, in 1980. It's not too late for the serve and volley to be revived.\n\n''Tennis goes in cycles,'' Shriver said. ``The serve and volley is trying to figure out how to make its way back into the modern game.''\n\nPlayers who think they are allergic to grass might also find out how fun it is if they would give the serve and volley a whirl, Henman said.\n\n''I spoke to Lleyton in the locker room before his first match [in the Stella Artois grass tournament at London] and said to him he should serve and volley the first point just to say that he has done it once,'' Henman told London's Sunday Telegraph. ``It's amazing to think he's won this tournament three times, and how many times has he served and volleyed in those three years? He didn't serve and volley one point last year.''"
