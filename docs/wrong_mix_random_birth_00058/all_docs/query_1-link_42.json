        "text": "Standing 5’10\" and playing right-handed, Mallory Burdette generates powerful ground strokes. She also uses a two-handed backhand for depth and accuracy.\n\nBurdette will return to college to finish her commitment at Stanford during 2012-2013 school year.\n\nBut this summer she took some time off to play a few tournaments—enough to earn a wild card into the U.S. Open.\n\nOnce in the draw, Burdette faced her first round opponent, Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland. Burdette eased past the Swiss 6-4, 6-3 and into the second round.\n\nThere the Stanford senior met Lucie Hradecka from the Czech Republic but once again, Burdette played the superior game, advancing to the third round at the 2012 U.S. Open.\n\nHer third round opponent, however, was Maria Sharapova, and Burdette did not get past the long-legged Russian, losing 6-1, 6-1.\n\nAt age 21, Burdette will no doubt be around for a long time. Her play at this year’s U.S. Open indicates much promise for the future pro.\n\nSo far in 2012, her play has been consistent. Her ranking climbed as high as world No. 24, although she sits now at No. 30.\n\nShe started her 2012 campaign to reach the top in January—advancing to the round of 16 in Auckland and later reaching the round of 32 at the 2012 Australian Open.\n\nThe tall Russian is currently ranked world No. 29.\n\nShe began the year ranked No. 54, entering the tournament in Sydney unseeded. After qualifying, Makarova advanced to the first round, losing to Li Na of China 6-0, 6-3.\n\nAt the 2012 Australian Open, however, Makarova reached the quarterfinals, defeating Serena Williams in the round of 16. She lost her quarterfinal match to Maria Sharapova 6-2, 6-3.\n\nHer results at the Australian Open saw her advance to the No. 42 spot in the WTA rankings.\n\nMakarova reached the second round at Indian Wells, but in the round of 16 in Miami, she lost once again to Maria Sharapova.\n\nAfter a mediocre clay-court season, Makarova entered the French Open ranked world No. 38—but she fell in the first round to Sloane Stephens.\n\nOn the grass in Birmingham, the Russian made it all the way to the semifinals where she lost to Melanie Oudin. At Eastbourne, she reached the quarterfinals, falling to Angelique Kerber. At Wimbledon she lost in round two, again to Kerber.\n\nAfter modest results during the U.S. Summer Series, Makarova advanced to the third round of the U.S. Open, losing to eventual champion, Serena Williams—the same lady she had defeated at the 2012 Australian Open.\n\nBy this time her ranking had moved up to No. 29—moving up 25 points in this break-out season for the Russian.\n\nLepchenko’s play on court continued to improve. After the Wimbledon fortnight, she was ranked in the top 50.\n\nOverall Lepchenko has played a great deal of tennis and has seen her ranking rise steadily throughout 2012.\n\nShe entered the U.S. Open seeded at No. 31. In her first round Lepchenko defeated Mathilde Johansson of France 6-3, 3-6, 7-5. In the second round, the American took out Anastasia Rodionova 6-2, 6-2. She lost her third round match with Sam Stosur, the defending champion, 7-6, 6-2.\n\nThere is little doubt that Lepchenko will be firmly ensconced in the women’s top 20 by year’s end."
