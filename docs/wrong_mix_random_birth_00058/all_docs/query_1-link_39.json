Afro (Talk)\n\nUser:Goredblue123 has created a \"new\" article at Richard Williams (tennis coach) by copy-pasting the content from Richard Williams (tennis) and then converting the latter to a re-direct. As a result, the edit history has become detached. Can an admin sort this out. -- Daemonic Kangaroo (talk)\n\nI guess you could post it on WP:ANI. That's indeed the wrong way to move an article. MakeSense64 (talk)\n\nIt seems to be fixed already. The page was moved to avoid confusion with a tennis player named Richard Williams: Richard Williams (tennis player) MakeSense64 (talk)\n\nI have fixed it. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nCan someone move this article back to R. Norris Williams as that was the correct title? This player, twofold winner of the U.S. National Championships (and Titanic survivor), was usually referred to as R. Norris Williams or alternatively Richard Norris Williams. I don't know why User:Goredblue123 moved this article, these kind of changes should at least be explained and preferably discussed beforehand. Also noticed the WP Tennis tag is missing on the Talk page.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAlso noticed that this user moved Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman to Hazel Wightman without any explanation or prior discussion. The resulting page has no more history and the Talk page contents are gone. Can someone with knowledge on properly moving articles revert this article back to Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman? Thx.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI have reverted the copy-paste move from R. Norris Williams to Richard Williams (tennis player). PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThx. Any chance you can also revert Hazel Wightman back to Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman? Had a look but I don't think a simple undo is sufficient.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nDone. I didn't see a problem with a simple undo so I did that on both titles. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThe Tennis Event Info infobox, used for almost all tennis tournament articles including the yearly Grand Slam articles (e.g. 1999 US Open), has a nice navigation feature at the bottom to easily go to the previous tournament (<1998) or the next tournament (2000>):\n\nIf you go down one level to the separate events, e.g. 1999 US Open – Women's Singles, this nifty navigation feature is absent and you can no longer easily browse between the different years of, in this case, the Women's U.S. Open singles event (note: now the template has been updated the example does show the previously absent navigation links)\n\nThought it would be a good idea to also add this navigation feature to the Grand Slam Events infobox which is the infobox used on the articles for the different events at a (Grand Slam) tournament. Being a complete template n00b I asked for assistance at the help desk and User:John of Reading was kind enough to help out and create this new version (1999 US Open – Women's Singles):\n\nIt uses the 'before_name' and 'after_name' fields to create the links to the previous and next tournaments. Think it looks and works great but since its a template functionality change I'm posting it here first for review before implementing it. It shouldn't take too much effort to fill in the values.\n\nDoes this get the WP Tennis seal of approval? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nIt gets mine. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI've made the edit. This means the second example in Wolbo's post here is now displayed with the new links. I've also edited the third example to use {{GrandSlamEvents}} rather than my sandbox, so that this talk page doesn't get disrupted when I re-use my sandbox for something else. -- John of Reading (talk)\n\nGreat! Thx! Note that until the 'before_name' and 'after_name' fields have been added to all the relevant articles infoboxes the nav links will go to the higher level of the Grand Slam tournament (1998/2000 US Open) instead of the event (1998/2000 US Open – Women's Singles). --Wolbo (talk)\n\nSince this may impact all biographies, including tennis bios, I thought it might be important. RFC on Alternate names. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThese lists have a lot of overlap so we don't really need both:\n\nList of tennis venues\n\nList of tennis stadiums by capacity\n\nThe first one is unsourced, while the second one appears better developed. Delete List of tennis venues ? MakeSense64 (talk)\n\nIt would be good to try and get a bit more order in the very large number of tennis lists that often, like in this case, partially overlap each other. A bit of pruning wouldn't hurt and will make it easier to organize / merge / standardize the remaining lists into a more logical and coherent collection. In this particular case I see no reason to have two separate list of tennis venues and agree that List of tennis stadiums by capacity is better developed and sourced. But if we have only one list I think the generic name 'List of tennis venues' would be better. Also if we have one single list I'm unconvinced that the current setup with separate tables for ATP and WTA venues is sensible (too much overlap).--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI know some of these Pre-open era tournaments need a re-write but I'm confused about one of the facts about the 1933 championship, it says the only match played at Roland Garros that year was a Davis Cup tie, it confuses me because USA/FRA's H2H does not indicate a single tie between 1933 and 1981. Afro (Talk)\n\nIt doesn't quite say that. It says it was a pro event in \"the Davis Cup format.\" It is detailed here [1]. I hope that helps clear things up. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nOh ok, I must have misread it thanks. Afro (Talk)\n\nThe two project sections Collaboration and Cleanup Listing seem to largely overlap. 'Collaboration' contains a list of articles which are unreferenced while 'Cleanup Listing' shows all articles that require some kind of cleanup (incl. unreferenced articles). The lede of 'Collaboration' mentions \"This department is for recognizing and fixing articles, within the scopes of Wikiproject Tennis, that need improvement.\" which is identical to the purpose of 'Cleanup Listing'. Any objections to tidying this up by merging them into one section? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe Cleanup list has been moved to the Collaboration section where it replaced the existing, and outdated, list of articles requiring a reference (FYI, the category 'articles requiring a reference' is also part of the cleanup list so no info is lost). The section 'Cleanup listing' has been removed from the navbar on the right side of the page and from the 'Departments & Projects' overview on the main page --Wolbo (talk)\n\nQuestion: should we rename the tab 'Collaboration' to 'Cleanup'? 'Cleanup' is more specific than the somewhat ambiguous term 'Collaboration'. Besides, since most WP Tennis sections are about collaboration in some way it seems a bit peculiar to have a single section with this term.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nDefinitively think 'Cleanup' would be a better name for that section than 'Collaboration'. Any objections to renaming it?--Wolbo (talk)\n\nCollaboration tab has now been renamed (moved) to Cleanup as well as all the links to it. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nI have added the 1927 Wimbledon women's singles draw. Note that, contrary to the Wimbledon 1927 main page, Helen Wills did not become Helen Wills Moody until December 1929. After a long time away due to illness, I plan to add more of the missing Wimbledon draws over time. Rmallett (talk)\n\nNice to see someone return after an illness and good to see progress on the Grand Slam draws. I adjusted the instances of 'Helen Wills Moody' to 'Helen Wills' for the 1927 Wimbledon article given that she was not married at that time. Also moved 1927 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles (hyphen) to 1927 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles (ndash) as the std format for draw articles. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nThanks for that. When I move the 1928 draw from my user space, is it just a matter of moving it to 1928 Wimbledon Championships &ndash Women's Singles ? Rmallett (talk)\n\nYou're welcome. Most of the championships now have corrected links (hyphen > ndash) to the different events so if you go to 1928 Wimbledon Championships and click on the red Women's Singles link you can copy the draw into the empty article and you're good.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI prepared the 1928 draw in my user space, but when I tried to move it to an article including &ndash it refused on the grounds of an invalid character in the title, so I changed it back to hyphen, sorry. Rmallett (talk)\n\nIt also wouldn't let me move the 1929 draw to an article including – on the grounds of an invalid character in the title, so I had to use a hyphen again, sorry. I will keep trying :-) Rmallett (talk)\n\nAre you using the old improper &ndash or the proper \"–\" character? Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) When creating or moving a page you must use the actual character '–' and not write it as &ndash;. You can for example copy-paste the character from somewhere. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThanks for that. I see that there is a pull down, which currently says 'Insert' followed by – — ‘’ “” ° ″ ′ ≈ ≠ ≤ ≥ ± − × ÷ √ ← → · § immediately after the Save page, Show preview, Show changes buttons. I guess the ndash is the first or second of these ? Rmallett (talk)\n\nThe en dash is the first, shorter dash (width of an n). The second dash is the em dash (width of an m). Jenks24 (talk)\n\nFYI, added wikilinks to the individual years in the U.S. National Championships men's singles champions navbox which links directly to the respective men's singles articles (except for the first few years for which no men's singles article (yet) exists). If response is positive (or at least not negative) I'll add this to the other navboxes as well. Useful or not? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nApparently no objections so added wikilinks to the individual years in the US Open navbox as well. Others to follow.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe years in 'Pre Open Era Wimbledon men's singles champions' navbox are now wikilinked as well.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAnd 'Wimbledon men's singles champions'.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nA few more done.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI'd like to request an increase in the width of this template, something similar to the Golf equivalent (see Ellsworth Vines' page for both, and the difference in width between them) in order to hopefully prevent some of the actual field text on the left-hand side (e.g. 'career prize money', 'current ranking', 'australian open') from running over onto 2 lines. This happens on many players' pages, e.g. Roger Federer, Fred Stolle, John Isner and Jérôme Golmard, whereas the infoboxes presumably should look relatively clutter free/stay on one line ala David Nalbandian, Denis Istomin, Marat Safin and Alexander Popp. This would greatly improve the presentation of such pages and make the infoboxes more efficient and easier to read... would this be possible? I have posted this at the Help Desk also. Thanks. Asmazif (talk) 12:35, 9 August 2012 (GMT)\n\nI'm not against it but Tennis takes its cue from project biography which uses info boxes such as Albert Einstein. Golf is the project that is out of whack. I'm not saying it isn't better, but it is a big thing to go against biography standards. In looking at Baseball Steve Garvey, it appears that they use the same size as golf also. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks for the reply. Even if going against the standards is a big thing to do, would it not still be the right thing to do to implement it if it's going to have a positive effect on thousands of player pages?. If it's a task which requires a great degree of time and effort then yes, I see your point. Asmazif (talk) 10:32, 10 August 2012 (GMT)\n\nI see from the discussion at Template talk:Infobox tennis biography that the issue has been solved by adding a few non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) to the label fields. I also made the template slightly wider (23em) but not as wide as the golf template (25em). By my measurement the template width increased from 246px to 258px which is actually more in line with the biography template (e.g. Churchill) which I measured at 256px. The increase allows four years on one line in the 'Grand Slam Singles results' section which, combined with the non breaking label for e.g. Australian Open, looks a lot neater. See Roger Federer.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThanks. Yes, everything looks much better now with both these edits. Asmazif (talk) 11:09, 15 August 2012 (GMT)\n\nThere seems to be some inconsistency in how relocated Masters events' winning percentages are treated in Singles performance timelines. In Federer's case we talk about calendar slots, Hamburg/Madrid clay is treated as same event and Stuttgart/Madrid indoors/Shanghai is treated as same event. In del Potro's case we talk about the host city, Hamburg is considered as discontinued event, Shanghai as new, and Madrid indoor and clay tournaments as the same. Personally I think we shouldn't consider Madrid clay and Hamburg as the same event when it comes to winning percentages, those clay courts had their unique characteristics. Also neither Stuttgart, Madrid indoors, and Shanghai should be considered as the same event, of those only Shanghai is an outdoor event. But I also think we should have separate winning percentages for Madrid indoor and clay tournaments, combined winning percentage doesn't make much sense. --August90 (talk)\n\nActually, Djokovic's singles performance timeline has winning percentages like I described above. Should we make it a standard? --August90 (talk)\n\nThe Djokovic setup seems more logical. Don't really see the point of combining W/L and Win % for different Masters tournaments like Federer's career statistics overview does with e.g. Hamburg and Madrid just because Madrid took the place of Hamburg in the Masters Series. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nNow Federer's singles performance timeline seems to have Hamburg results on Madrid row and Eurocard Open/Madrid indoor results on Shanghai row, which I think makes it even more confusing. I think we have a consensus that the Djokovic setup is the way to go, I'd just change it so that the text starting from 2009 on Hamburg row would be \"Not Masters 1000\" instead of \"Held as Madrid (Clay)\", as the Hamburg event still exists. Similarly the text until 2008 on Madrid (clay) row would be \"Held as Madrid (Hard)\" as both Wiki article and ATP website consider it as the continuation of that indoor event. And the text until 2008 on Shanghai row would be \"Not held\" or something like that and the text starting from 2009 on Madrid (Hard) row would be \"Held as Madrid (Clay)\". I think that Djokovic setup can be used in article guidelines, and I can start calculating those winning percentages in players' timelines. --August90 (talk)\n\nI'm a bit confused about the contents and purpose of the 1973 Grand Prix (tennis) article. According to the lede it's supposed to be an overview of all Grand Prix tournaments in 1973 but it also list the World Championship Tennis (WCT) tournaments and USLTA Indoor Winter Circuit which I believe were not part of the Grand Prix circuit. All the Grand Prix tournaments for woman are missing (apart from the mixed doubles) and the article overlaps with 1973 Men's Grand Prix (tennis). Can anyone clarify?--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThese are the other articles I could find relating to the 1973 season (this setup applies to other 1970s seasons as well):\n\n1973 Men's Grand Prix (tennis)\n\n1973 World Championship Tennis circuit\n\n1973 Women's Grand Prix (tennis)\n\n1973 Virginia Slims WTA Tour\n\nThese articles seem to be fine in the sense that the overviews match the article titles. I notice there is as yet no 1973 in Tennis article but that should be added to the equation (see 2007 example). So what to do with the 1973 Grand Prix (tennis) article (and similar ones)? Should it's contents be modified to match the article title or should we perhaps turn it into 1973 Grand Prix (tennis). Thoughts? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nWe also need to check if the Grand Prix list is complete. Neither the 1973 Grand Prix (tennis) or 1973 Men's Grand Prix (tennis) article for instance mention the Sydney International (then New South Wales Championhips) but according to that article it was part of the Grand Prix tour at the time. There might well be more missing.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI know I rarely contribute nowadays, but I saw this section and had to step in. The line about the Sydney International being part of the Grand Prix was added to the pages of virtually all the modern tournaments when it's not true. The tournaments that are listed on the 1973 Men's Grand Prix page were part of the Men's Grand Prix, as are those listed for the 1973 Women's Grand Prix. A reminder again that the ATP's calendars for the 1970's in particular are inaccurate and do not reflect the various circuits that existed then. In short, if a tournament is listed on the Wikipedia pages, it actually was part of the Grand Prix. One minor point about the 1973 Virginia Slims WTA Tour as well: it was really the Virginia Slims Circuit because the WTA had only just been established in 1973, and even then it was called the Women's International Tennis Association (WITA) and had no administrative duties within the Virginia Slims Circuit. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nI'd seen your contribution to these articles and was hoping you would drop by to comment. As mentioned the list in 1973 Men's Grand Prix (tennis) seems fine and in line with the World of Tennis 1974 book but do you agree that 1973 Grand Prix (tennis) contains WCT and US Indoor tournaments that do not belong on a list of Grand Prix tournaments? If so, what do you think we should do with that article? If we just take out the WCT / US Indoor tournaments the article pretty much becomes a duplicate of 1973 Men's Grand Prix (tennis). I mentioned the 1973 Sydney International (New South Wales Championships) because I came across it but could not discover if it was part of the Grand Prix circuit at the time or not. The Wiki article says yes but it's not in 1973 Men's Grand Prix (tennis) and it is also not mentioned in World of Tennis 1974 as either a Grand Prix or WCT tournament. So, what circuit was it part of or was it a stand-alone, independent tournament? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nThank you for your reply. When I created a similar article for the 1971 Men's Grand Prix someone cited WP:CONCEPTDAB to point out that I was not allowed to separate the Men's Grand Prix from the Women's Grand Prix and would have to put both of them on one main page, but I had already created the 1973 articles by then and I wasn't prepared to merge the two to form a large and – in my opinion – stodgy article. In my absence someone then put all of the tournaments cited in the inaccurate ATP calendar (I can't stress this enough) back onto the main 1973 Grand Prix page, leaving the inaccurate article available today. The New South Wales Championships (Sydney International) did not appear in the 1974 Grand Prix (according to World of Tennis 1975) and was not part of the 1973 WCT or US Indoor circuits, so it must have been an independent tournament – it did not become part of the Grand Prix until 1977. I'm so glad that someone else has a World of Tennis annual that backs up what I've been saying for quite a while – these annuals are key to improving the reliability of this WikiProject. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nBought a couple of World of Tennis annuals recently (most of them are dirt cheap) and agree that they are crucial sources for covering the 1968-2000 period. After 2000 info becomes more easily available online but it's still a shame they discontinued these annuals in 2001. Does anybody know if the ITF Yearbooks are a decent successor? Thx for the explanation, it's now clear how these articles came about. Still we need to decide what to do with 1973 Grand Prix (tennis). One option would be to merge the Grand Prix Men's and Women's article but that would indeed become a very lengthy article and besides the ATP and WTA years are also covered in separate articles so it seems consistent to do the same here. I'm more and more inclined to turn them into 1973 in Tennis given that a) we can't leave the article in it's current incorrect state and b) as mentioned removing the WCT and US Indoor tournaments turns the article into a duplicate of 1973 Men's Grand Prix (tennis). Thoughts?--Wolbo (talk)\n\n...is here: Talk:Tennis_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics#Organiser.3F. Somebody answer, please. --Stryn (talk)\n\nPlease see Template talk:Tennis events 2#Colours.\n\nThe new Wimbledon infobox refers to women's singles, while the early Wimbledon draw pages refer to ladies' siingles (because that's what Wimbledon called them then, and still calls them now) with the result that the infobox doesn't link to the early draw pages. Rmallett (talk)\n\nAn anonymous user started deleting large parts of this article claiming duplicate and trivial information. While in some cases he/she was right about duplications (and these have been fixed), this person continues to delete many records on false grounds, see Talk:List of career achievements by Roger Federer#Redundancy/frivolous. Can someone look at the article and discussion and independently decide if some achievements indeed are not important enough to be listed? I suspect the importance-threshold is lower in this dedicated article compared to e.g. the more general Roger Federer article, and I don't see a problem with listing a large number of achievements, but I also don't want to enforce my own views. Gap9551 (talk)\n\nI'm quite happy to read a list of tennis records (split, as necessary, into male vs. female, pre-open vs. open, different surfaces, etc.) but to have a dedicated record page for a particular player does encourage people to go loooking for categories in which they can claim records. Rmallett (talk)\n\nI assume you mean 108.78.177.132? In looking at the differences here I find I might have made some of the same trimmings myself. I would also have made other trimmings. You want this to be about Federer... not his peers. You also don't want arbitrary numbers like Sampras winning 14 in 49 Majors while Federer won 17 in 37. Those are items that imho are unneeded trivial stats. I would have written \"Federer holds the open-era record for most consecutive US Open titles at five (2004–08)\" and that's it. Nothing about pre-open era winners since you already stated it's an open-era record. Things like \"7 Grand Slam titles in 9 attempts, 8 in 10 attempts, 11 in 16 attempts, 12 in 18 attempts, 13 in 21 attempts, 14 in 23 attempts, 15 in 25 attempts, 16 in 27 attempts and 17 in 37 attempts are all all-time men's records.\" are way overkill imho. You would need to find an actual press report that could be quoted as saying \"Roger Federer has won 13 in 21 attempts.\" I would have kept \"Federer, Jimmy Connors and Sampras have won a men's open-era record five US Open titles\" but worded it differently or combined it with the consecutive record above.\n\nSo Items like \"Federer (2003–09) is the only man in tennis history to play in seven consecutive Wimbledon finals\" I would keep. But \"Federer (2004–09, 6 years) has appeared in six consecutive US Open men's finals\" I would dump as not a record. This I would keep \"Federer is the only male player in tennis history to reach at least three Grand Slam finals for four consecutive calendar years and five overall (2004, 2006–09)\". This I would throw away \"During open era, Federer is the 3rd male to appear in 8 finals of the same grand slam, 8 at Wimbledon. Lendl (8 US Open finals) was the first player to achieve this feat followed by Sampras (8 US Open finals). However Lendl only won 3 out of 8 US Open finals and Sampras won 5 out of 8 US Open finals, where as Federer won 7 out of 8 Wimbledon finals. On the other hand, Sampras is undefeated in all 7 Wimbledon finals that he appeared in.\" It's probably all in the eye of the beholder... I tend to be much tighter in what I would think is an actual record that people might talk about. I'm more exclusionist than inclusionist. If I see \"He is the 4th...\" warning flags go off that this is not a record or this is not worthy of inclusion. So my opinion would be to open it for discussion on the talk page. I'd rewrite it myself but I would think many would yell at me for cutting it by a third and shortening many of the sentences to remove player names that aren't named Federer. Anyway, my two cents. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks, that sounds reasonable. I agree that the articles could be more concise and that some achievements are too detailed. I cut out some overly detailed information. I certainly wouldn't mind if someone else also did this too. The reason why I brought it up here was the difficulty to discuss things in a reasonable way on the talk page with said user. Gap9551 (talk)\n\nHe seems to have a bad bedside manner and is at an/i because of it, so you're not alone. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIs there really such a thing as a Channel Slam? winning the two majors, French and Wimbledon in the same season? I know espn used it once or twice in sources but for \"we\" at wikipedia to use it in multiple articles should the term be a little more widespread? Maybe it's an espn thing. We don't want to be the primary source on the internet. Even less source worthy appears to be \"small slam\" which is very rarely used for winning 3 majors in a season but has been added to an article or two. I just want to make sure we are all on the same page in allowing or not allowing for consistency. Thanks. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThe term 'Channel Slam' does not appear to be widely used in reliable sources but it has a couple of mentions. Apart from ESPN it can be found on an SI.com blog (link1, link2) and also on a Wimbledon 2011 page (link3). Apart from these sources it is mainly used on personal blogs and a tennis forum or two. The term 'Small Slam' comes from bridge so perhaps there is some logic to using it as 'Grand Slam' is also a bridge term but it seems to have very little traction in reliable sources. Apart from that it sound an awful lot like a contradictio in terminis. You either win the Grand Slam or you don't, a Small Slam is like being a little bit pregnant. Or did Murray just win a Really Small Slam? My verdict: 'Channel Slam' marginal yes, 'Small Slam' no.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI think I would have leaned marginal no on Channel Slam but at least it has been used on a few occasions. I guess my weight of it would be percentage of use... just French and Wimbledon vs Channel Slam. It would seem to me that the scale would clunk down heavily on not using Channel Slam as standard usage in wikipedia. Even if it was 60/40 against, that would still be a sizable chunk of usage. It must be more like 1000 to 1 against in all press usage? When we compare one particular name against another particular name it's easy to compare in google etc... we can see that name \"A\" gets more hits than name \"B\". But when you're comparing a rare name \"A\" against no name at all it doesn't work the same way. It's 5 or 6 instances of finding name \"A\" but really countless thousands of finding nothing. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI have never heard 'channel slam' or 'small slam' used by the British media.Rmallett (talk)\n\nI don't support neither of them. It has the same \"sense\" as let's say calling the US, AUS and Wimbledon the Commonwealth Slam or the US and AUS the Transpacific Slam or the Roland and US Open the Liberty Slam. There are plenty of variations for them to not include any of it just the full or zero Slams and still we will have career, calendar, classic or golden Grand Slams to talk about. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAlso to have a wikilike argument here, an average reader who is unfamiliar with tennis needs to have less specific (or made up specific) terms to come across and search for while reading the article. Also I'd wait until a book dedicated to tennis mentions any of them. Widespread terms are hard to deny but news hypes and forced word usage by sports commentators are not to be confused with people's everday coffee chat about tennis. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nHis - unsourced - article (and also its - unsourced - French equivalent) claims he died at the age of 95. While the Time Magazine of 1943 reports that he fell in World War II. What to do next? He hasn't played tennis after 1939, which is quite suspicious. Tennisarchives support the 2003 death date but it's asite that gathers information from every available sources so Wikipedia could also be one of them. Still they have no activity data after 1939, when he was just 30 years old and at that time you'd have had 10 more years in tennis (also a possible warwound could explain it but later wartime pictures show he wasn't enlisted - see below). I could find three pictures of him dated later than the 30s from WWII, but they are still earlier than the Time accounts [2] [3] [4]. ALSO this French article at the Société Française des Parfumeurs (French Society of Parfume Makers) states he married Cellier Germaine and was still alive in 1970. Any ideas? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nHe definitely seems to have survived WWII according to scoreshelf.com. See also this 1946 newspaper article.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI would say that Tima Magazine got it wrong. He is in multiple draws of the French Championships, 1949 and 1953 for example. And here is a newspaper clip from his 1953 loss to Ken Rosewall. So unless there were two different Christian Boussus's, I think the latter death date is correct. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI am tend to believe it but it would be nice to have a proper source for the article. At least for his date of death as there are ambiguous sources out there. So we know he survived the WWII and perhaps lived in the 70s, but 2003 is still 30 years after the latest news about him... I am surprised that a player named the \"fifth musketeer\" who lived such a magnificent age doesn't even pop up at a findagrave-like site at least. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI don't think he was called the fifth musketeer universally... maybe only a couple sources. But I was also surprised I could find no obituary on his death. I did find that a video was made of Boussus playing tennis for the prisoners in Sept 1943. So he was probably presumed lost at first when Time published the names in June, and later found out to be captured instead. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nOkay I will add all this info on his page as well as an infobox. He's a former Davis Cup captain and a mixed doubles Australian Open champions so I think his article deserves to be improved a little. Still his death date needs clarification in the near future. Maybe some French newspapers will find out he's missing...again and publish something about him. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nHere are two French websites mentioning his death in 2003 (link1, link2) and Figaro has a preview of an article on his death in 2003.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nnice finds! You're a better man than I Gunga Din. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nFigaro is an exceptional nice catch, I'll include it in his article soon. Coincidently I also found the other two but I had my concerns on tennis-histoire as it is edited by only one man, who posted his own CV but nothing about being a tennis expert. I rejected the other at the first glimpse too based solely on its URL but on the second closer look it seems like a valid site of the local sports club of Bagnères-de-Bigorre so it could be also useful with its bio summary on Boussus. I searched news.google.com and found info on his studies and that he was ranked N°1 French tennis player in 1934, 1936 and 1937 by the French Lawn Tennis Association. Funnily enough I found another source for his death at the The Milwaukee Journal but as proven here it's just the same hoax. I like draw attention on André Lacroix (tennis)'s death in his article that is based on the same Time info. Maybe it needs a double check too? Again thank you folks, I found out to be a category category for him already existing in Commons so photos are also available for his infobox. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nFinished expanding it, although it's still a stub. Have a look at it if you have time. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nIf you can help me out to expand it to 5x bigger than it's original stubbish state within a week, we could send it to DYK. Maybe a detailed description of his victory and finals at the Slams? Contemporary newspapers seem to have reported it in depth. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\na couple of strange articles that look like hoaxes to me, but maybe I'm missing something. Alexandra Machedoska and Lucerne Open. There may be more by these editors but I could find no sources for these articles. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nHoaxes: Machedoska isn't listed in the rankings from September 10th (her ranking apparently updated on September 8th) and there hasn't been a tennis tournament in Lucerne since the 1994 European Open. The WTA activity for Renata Voracova this year doesn't list a tournament in Lucerne either. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nIn the AfD Fyunck(click) said both are the works of Menzeliotsky but there's two other editors involved, namely Croszia and Mustafiska. Checking his contributions reveals there's a couple of other subpages 2012 Lucerne Open, 2012 Lucerne Open – Singles, 2012 Lucerne Open – Doubles, 2011 Lucerne Open, 2011 Lucerne Open – Singles, and they are preparing a third one here : User:Anyalivictor. Maybe a mass nomination? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nYou're right. The question is are these all the same user or a tag team of kids pulling pranks? Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nSecond Lajbi's idea; while I'm sure Renata Voracova would appreciate the efforts of the editors involved to boost her ranking (she is 347th in the world in today's new singles rankings) Wikipedia attempts to provide information, not novel and somewhat optimistic fiction. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nThese are sockpuppets, I bet. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAs I've seen a couple dozen lists of the above form has been created and added to Template:Davis Cup by Jevansen. Basicly it's not a bad idea and it could be especially useful if we add a short introduction of players into it as many of the Davis Cup players' articles will probably not be created or will never surpass the stub category. We can have then redirects from all names to the appropriate section of the list. Thus many one-time Davis Cup players could be covered by Wikipedia. Also this way these lists could become more detailed and perhaps could apply for a featured list badge. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI'm sure this article doesn't belong to Wikipedia. Does anybody else think it should be deleted? --August90 (talk)\n\nIt should be deleted in my opinion. It is probably a joke, and the references do not support the content, in fact none contains the word 'vulture'. Gap9551 (talk)\n\nYes, it's a joke that should belong to Uncyclopedia (even it'd be quite poor an Uncyclopedia article :D ). But would it fill the criteriums for speedy deletion? And also the creator of the article, Alexio92 seems to be a troll, just check his contributions. --August90 (talk)\n\nIt doesn't quite seem to fit speedy deletion. I have proposed it for deletion instead. I also removed all named players as unsourced derogatory terms per WP:BLP which applies to all pages. This meant all references became irrelevant and also had to be deleted. None of them supported the \"vulture\" claim. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nOriginal creator removed the proposed deletion template. Why not just nominate it for deletion so the process couldn't get halted by such acts. Editor also messed with Juan Mónaco,David Ferrer,Victor Hănescu ‎,Alan Hansen,Javier Hernández Balcázar. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nYep...nominate away. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Points Vulture. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThe above article lists the Racing Club of France as a venue used during this event. Are any of the entries on the page Racing Club de France the venue mentioned, or was there another similarly named facility used? - TB (talk)\n\nOnly sort of. Choice two \"the former name of Racing Club de Paris football club\" is sort of correct but that article is about the squads of football players not the Venue. The venue and team/squad were founded in 1882; the team was football, the venue became multipurpose. The 1900 Olympics were held here, and the French Tennis Championships were held here from 1910-1926. In 1928 Roland Garros became the permanent site of the French Championship (later the French Open) and the Racing Club of France slowly slipped into history as a major tennis venue. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nAh, that makes sense. I'll see about splitting the venue content from the football club to make a natural home for this content. Cheers. = TB (talk)\n\nThe current template Template:French Championships mixed doubles champions contradicts the list List of French Open mixed doubles champions in the early years winners (1912-1914), although I think the latter is correct there's no proof for that. Are the mixed results are properly archived in the Roland Garros site or on any reliable other? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nThe template is incorrect, for 1912-1914 it shows the results of the World Hard Court Championships. The correct mixed results are the ones in the list and can be found on the Roland Garros site. They are also listed in Gille Delamarre's book Roland Garros - Le Livre du Tournoi du Centenaire.--Wolbo (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) They show winners of two different tournaments which may be considered the precursor to the French Open. The French Championships were only for French players. List of French Open mixed doubles champions shows the World Hard Court Championships which was open to foreigners (that's what \"Open\" in French Open means). See French Open#History. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nActually it looks like they both show the opposite tournament of what I said. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nI think the List of French Open mixed doubles champions is correct. Someone blew it on the template by using the WHCC instead. It has now been fixed... thanks for bringing it to our attention. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nNot much feedback so far on the WP Tennis Goals post so in an effort to takes things forward (or perhaps drag a dead horse?) here's my proposal for an update to the project goals.\n\nCurrent Project Goals\n\nTennis, History of tennis, ATP Tour\n\nCreate an article for every Grand Slam tournament ever held\n\nCreate articles for each Grand Slam tournament draw: Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, Mixed Doubles\n\nCreate an article for every player who has won more than x matches in a Grand Slam tournament\n\nAdd 'Performance Timeline' sections to all the above articles\n\nCreate guidelines and templates for tournament articles, draws, and player articles\n\nStandardize naming: \"Wimbledon\" vs. \"Wimbledon Championships\", \"US Open\" vs. \"U.S. Open\" and \"French Open\" vs. \"Roland Garros\"\n\nFinish the performance timeline comparison tables, which will include the career Grand Slam tournament, World Hard Court Championship and Olympic results of every woman who has reached at least one Grand Slam tournament, World Hard Court Championship or Olympic final during her career.\n\nNeed to make at least one article into Featured Article status.\n\nCreate articles for every notable tennis tournament for male and female players, especially since the beginning of the Open Era, including yearly articles and draws.\n\nProposed Project Goals\n\n(1) Take Tennis, History of tennis, ATP Tour, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open articles to Good Article status and at least one to Featured Article status\n\n(2) Create an article for every Grand Slam tournament ever held\n\n(a) Create articles for each Grand Slam tournament draw: Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, Mixed Doubles\n\n(3) Create articles for every notable tennis tournament for male and female players including yearly articles and draws.\n\n(4) Create an article (including infobox) for every player who has reached at least the quarter finals in a Grand Slam tournament\n\n(a) Add 'Performance Timeline' section to all relevant player articles\n\n(5) Create guidelines and templates for tournament articles, draws, and player articles\n\n(a) Standardize naming: \"Wimbledon\" vs. \"Wimbledon Championships\", \"US Open\" vs. \"U.S. Open\" and \"French Open\" vs. \"Roland Garros\"\n\n(6) Finish the Tennis performance timeline comparison (women) and Tennis performance timeline comparison (men) articles\n\nThe numbers are added purely for reference. Here's an overview of the changes and explanations.\n\n(1) Merged \"Tennis, History of tennis, ATP Tour\" with \"Need to make at least one article into Featured Article status.\" Added the Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n(2) Unchanged\n\n(a) Unchanged (indented)\n\n(3) Removed \"especially since the beginning of the Open Era\" and changed order (2 & 3 are both tournament goals)\n\n(4) Specified \"x matches\" to \"reached at least Grand Slam quarter finals\". Without defining \"x\" it was an empty goal. All notable players is perhaps too pie-in-the-sky ambitious and the \"quarter final\" requirement seems reasonable and is also easily verifiable and therefore practical. Added the goal that all player articles should have a tennis biography infobox.\n\n(a) Changed \"all the above\" to \"all relevant player\" (indented)\n\n(5)) Unchanged\n\n(a) Unchanged (indented)\n\n(6) Added men's performance timeline comparison and removed detailed explanation (can be seen on the article pages)\n\nHope to get some feedback on this proposal and reach a project consensus. It's not very busy in here at the moment so I'll wait a considerable time before making any updates. There is no real rush but we should get this sorted. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nHow about adding a project goal regarding the amount of articles that require cleanup? Seems to be a good indicator of the overall quality of the tennis articles (together with the quality assessment). Proposal:\n\n(7) Ensure that no more than 5% of all tennis articles are marked for cleanup.\n\nCurrently 16.4 % of the articles are marked for cleanup, but about 40% of those are related to Persondata templates missing a short description. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nIf there are no objections I'll update the 'Goals' section sometime next week. Would prefer to do so based on a bit more more feedback from and discussion with other tennis editors but the lack of that should not be a reason not to move forward (per WP:BOLD). Of course we can always revisit this topic at some point in the future when hopefully the activity here picks up.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe proposed cleanup goal \"Ensure that no more than 5% of all tennis articles are marked for cleanup.\" is the last update that is still outstanding. Any objections to adding it? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nLast call for comments. If no objections I'll update this next week.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAgreed, and I appreciate your efforts in this direction. Once the Wimbledon singles draws are complete, we can talk further about what needs to be done, which may require a visit to the Wimbledon library. Rmallett (talk)\n\nDone (see below).--Wolbo (talk)\n\nImprove Tennis, History of tennis, ATP Tour, Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open articles to Good Article status and at least one to Featured Article status\n\n> Merged \"Tennis, History of tennis, ATP Tour\" with \"Need to make at least one article into Featured Article status.\" Added the Grand Slam tournaments.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nFinish the Tennis performance timeline comparison (women) and Tennis performance timeline comparison (men) articles\n\n> Added men's performance timeline comparison and removed detailed explanation. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nCreate articles for every notable tennis tournament for male and female players including yearly articles and draws.\n\n> Removed \"especially since the beginning of the Open Era\" and added notability wikilink. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nCreate an article for every player who has reached at least the quarterfinals in a singles event or the semifinals in a doubles event at a Grand Slam tournament\n\n> Replaced the meaningless 'x matches' with the criteria of reaching the quarterfinals in a singles event or the semifinals in a doubles event. Left out 'including infobox'. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nCreate an article for every Grand Slam tournament ever held as well as for each draw (men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, mixed doubles)\n\n> Merged \"Create an article for every Grand Slam tournament ever held\" with \"Create articles for each Grand Slam tournament draw: Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, Mixed Doubles\"--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAdd 'Performance Timeline' sections to all the above articles\n\n> Changed to \"Add 'Performance Timeline' sections to relevant player articles\" --Wolbo (talk)\n\n> Added \"Ensure that no more than 5% of all articles are marked for cleanup.\"--Wolbo (talk)\n\nPlayer Article Goal\n\nCurrent goal:\n\nCreate an article for every player who has won more than x matches in a Grand Slam tournament\n\nProposed goal:\n\nCreate an article (including infobox) for every player who has reached at least the quarter finals in a Grand Slam tournament\n\nAfter browsing through the Grand Slam draw articles I believe it might be sensible to distinguish between singles and doubles players and adjust for the fact that singles draws are generally larger and the players more notable. So with that in mind here is a revised proposal for the player article goal:\n\nCreate an article, including infobox, for every player who has reached at least the quarterfinals in a singles event or the semifinals in a doubles event at a Grand Slam tournament\n\nAny feedback / objections to this revised proposal? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nFWIW I would agree with that. Not interested in doubles myself, since so many players withdraw from doubles somewhere along the way, if they're doing well in singles. Rmallett (talk)\n\nIf there are no further objections I'll update this in the course of the week.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI'd suggest setting up a guideline that favors prose instead of wikitables and statistical data. We could encourage editors to include at least 1,500 characters of written text when creating these articles, so at least they could pass the DYK nomination minimum requirement. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI never knew about DYK because it's 'below the fold' on the home page for me, so I never see it; and it's ephemeral anyway, so personally, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Rmallett (talk)\n\n1,500 characters won't do any wrong to the article. It is really just over the stub-limit. DYK is ephemeral or not it boosts the viewership, and also guarantees that the article has a minimum grammar/formatting/neutrality as it is required in the manual of style. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nLajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nNoticed that the yearly ATP Tour and WTA Tour are lacking an infobox which makes it difficult to get a quick summary view of these lengthy articles and to easily navigate between the year articles. To address this shortcoming I created an {Infobox tennis circuit season} (see below and here). Well, not so much 'created', it's more 'creatively copied' from other infoboxes and then made some adjustments. It should be possible to use the infobox for all the yearly ATP Tour and WTA Tour articles but also the yearly Grand Prix articles, WCT circuit articles as well as the Year in tennis articles. This may require further development. So what do you think, useful addition or waste of space? Any sugestions for improvements? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nAdded a tournament categories field. Another option is to create a separate field (+label) for every tournament category but that list would be very long to cover all the tournament categories used since the Open era so a generic 'categories' field is the more flexible solution.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI really like and support that. Although categories won't work with year in tennis articles and pre-professional era tennis, the parameter could stay at least it will be omitted for earlier years. So for the year in tennis we need women and team tennis infos, Olympics for Olympic years, and mixed champions perhaps (\"most improved\" and similar awards could go both ways separated with a slash). The other line I would reconsider is the \"most finals\" since it's an unofficial statistical data and based upon this many others could join the infobox...without significantly improving it. Maybe we can have a picture and caption included within the infobox as many ATP/WTA articles already start with pic at the top (ok, I see it already has it and works well as I tested in 2010 ATP World Tour). So it's a good idea and nice work. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nGlad you like it. Yes, the image was included already in the template. I had the ATP or WTA logo in mind and didn't think that would look particularly good in this format but the photo quadtych at 2010 ATP World Tour fits very well.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI could help with the template documentation if you feel so. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nSure, be my guest. Thx.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nIt looks like this in the 1931 in tennis article. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nCategories turned out to be fine with earlier years contrary what I presumed. It's the awards that weren't introduced until some decades ago. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAdded an 'Edition' field to the template. Not so useful for articles like 1931 in tennis but meant for ATP or WTA articles like 2000 ATP Tour.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nJust making sure those that don't regularly read our project page realize that umpires and notability have come up once again. At Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mohamed Lahyani. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI am watching over an editor. Per agreement, one of her tasks is to update facts and figures in tennis articles. I don't quite understand the codes and conventions used. Would somebody please spot check a few edits to make sure they are alright. Many thanks, Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nReposting again below. Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nLajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nThe answer is a resounding 'No, I did not know, in fact I had no clue who Lucas Cleeve was'. Nice work on the Algernon Kingscote article! --Wolbo (talk)\n\nIt's your credit as well. Thanks for helping me out. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nRepost, this time with the all-important link. Yes, I am a balloonhead. :)\n\nI am watching over an editor. Per agreement, one of her tasks is to update facts and figures in tennis articles. I don't quite understand the codes and conventions used. Would somebody please spot check a few of her 8 zillion edits to make sure they are alright, and just give me a thumbs up here. Also, maybe invite her to join the project here because she's very productive and likes tennis.\n\nMany thanks, Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nI just looked over the last three players edits and they look pretty good.... some of the tedious stuff that not many like doing too. I sure hope BrightStarSky keeps doing it because we could always use prolific editors. Make sure he/she reads over our project guidelines and if any questions arise never be afraid to ask right here. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThank you very much. I also hope this prolific editor continues. I (also) invited her to join this project.\n\nProject talk page stalkers: Please don't hesitate to let her know that she's appreciated if you feel she's doing good work. :) Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nAdded a table with the standardized color scheme (and color codes) for tournaments to the Article guidelines for reference purpose.\n\nMen Women Color code Grand Slam tournaments Grand Slam tournaments E5D1CB Summer Olympics Summer Olympics FFD700 ATP World Tour Finals WTA Tour Championships FFFFCC Grand Slam Cup Grand Slam Cup FFE4B5 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Premier Mandatory & Premier 5 DFE2E9 ATP World Tour 500 Premier D0F0C0 ATP World Tour 250 International\n\nAs far as I'm aware, based on current articles as well as previous discussions, these are the agreed standardized colors. This color scheme table is a reference for editors and can help them to update those articles that are currently non-compliant. The Grand Slam Cup is an obsolete tournament (ran from 1990 to 1999) so perhaps this should be listed separately. Also as far as I can tell it's colors usage is not really standardized, the color shown is per the Pete Sampras career statistics article.\n\nRelevant archived discussions on color schemes (new to old):\n\nWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tennis/Archive_7#WTA color schemes\n\nWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tennis/Archive_6#Colors of tournament types in WTA articles\n\nWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tennis/Archive_5#Premier Mandatory, Premier 5, and Premier tournaments on the WTA tour\n\nWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tennis/Archive_4#Colours\n\nAny comments or suggestions for improvement? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe Grand Slam Cup is now listed separately as an obsolete tournament. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nI'm not a huge fan of color charts (some because of blind/colorblind rules here at wikipedia) but I think they are here to stay. That said the yellow for the WTFinals is not the same as the chart above it. It should be FFFFCC which is much softer and pleasing to the eye. The Sampras page is actually a bit stewy in it's color arrangements. I changed your chart above and on the guideline page accordingly. If it was me, to keep in sync with the rest of the pastels, I'd have gone with an olympics of FFE976 or at most FFE34E. Otherwise I like it. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThx for the correction, must have taken the color for the World Tour Finals from an incorrect article. Inadvertently that shows the value of having this color scheme / code table in the guidelines to make clear what the correct colors are. I never liked the early color schemes we used, they were much too flashy and prominent and therefore distracted from reading the content of the article. They also had serious accessibility issues due to the low contrast ratio between the letters and the background color. Frankly those colors did more harm than good but IMO the current softer scheme does not have these issues. And it's a good step forward to standardize the colors for both ATP and WTA (the WTA colors were an abomination). I understand the current color for the Olympics, for FFE34E you can subsutitue GOLD, but agree that it does not fit well with the rest of the scheme and is too heavy. Of the two substitutes you mention, FFE976 and FFE34E, the latter has my preference, it's still recognizable as a gold color and differentiates enough from the WTF yellow. This is how it would look: --Wolbo (talk)\n\nMen Women Color code Grand Slam tournaments Grand Slam tournaments E5D1CB Summer Olympics Summer Olympics FFE34E ATP World Tour Finals WTA Tour Championships FFFFCC ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Premier Mandatory & Premier 5 DFE2E9 ATP World Tour 500 Premier D0F0C0 ATP World Tour 250 International\n\nAny objections to changing the color for the Olympics to the one shown above? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nIt's better. Not so bright. --Stryn (talk)\n\nlooks good to me too. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nMen Women Color code Grand Slam tournaments Grand Slam tournaments F3E6D7 Summer Olympics Summer Olympics FFEA5C ATP World Tour Finals WTA Tour Championships FFFFCC ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Premier Mandatory & Premier 5 E9E9E9 ATP World Tour 500 Premier D4F1C5 ATP World Tour 250 International Team Events Team Events ECF2FF\n\nWith the consensus on the Olympics color it looks like we are done but the discussion at Template talk:Tennis events 2#Colours makes clear that we should also take the accessibility guidelines into account to ensure that people with low vision / color deficiencies can read the tables as well. Part of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) deals with the contrast between text color and background color and while our tournament colour scheme is WCAG 2 AA-level compliant (contrast ratio at least 4.5) only the 'ATP World Tour Finals' and 'ATP World Tour 250' are AAA-level compliant (contrast ratio at least 7). Please find above a proposal for a color scheme that fully meets this highest level of compliance. A 'Team Events' option has been added. Downside of this change is that it requires a significant update of articles but the end result will be a scheme that meets the highest accessibility guidelines and should therefore be relatively future proof. Might as well bite the bullet now. Thoughts? Comments? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nCan we get some feedback on this so we can finalize our consensus standardized color scheme and get started with the necessary udates? Thx.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nWhat's to be done (if anything) to the WTA colours ? The ATP and WTA colours should be the same for equivalent levels, if there are equivalent levels. Otherwise, my only comment would be that they should comply with the accessibility guidelines, as you say. Rmallett (talk)\n\nThe table also has a column for the WTA tournaments and yes they will be the same for comparable levels. The same will apply to historic categories i.e. the color for 'ATP World Tour 250' will also be used for its predecessors 'International Series' and 'World Series'.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe last chart up there with the added team events at ECF2FF, is my favorite. When charts get larger it's far more pleasing to the eye. Also rememeber that the W3C Guidelines also say \"color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information\" so in reality there should also be a symbol associated with each color, every time. In practice on wikipedia this is rarely followed and can make charts very cumbersome by having to add symbols like †‡€⁪ұҰΩ┴▼ for each and every entry in color. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nRegarding the W3C guidelines it can be argued that the text itself, i.e. `ATP World Tour 250`, is the primary means of conveying the information and the color plays a supporting role. It seems we're reaching a consensus on this color scheme but I'll wait a little while longer to see if there is any more feedback before adding the color scheme to the article guidelines.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe consensus color scheme has now been added to the Article Guidelines with a small section lede. Let the updates begin! --Wolbo (talk)\n\nI removed the Grand Slam Cup as a separate color event. As it was basically a year end tournament it falls within the same category as the ATP World Tour Finals and can therefore use the same color (FFFFCC).--Wolbo (talk)\n\nJust a heads up... we have a newer editor removing the number of titles Margaret Court won in her career. We have had it listed as 192/92, overall/open era, in the infobox for a couple years, and that's pretty simple and informative... but Mouchatm is insistent on removing the historical data. I've reverted him twice and left a friendly note on his talk page on how things work in hopes that he'll self-revert. We'll see. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nDo we have a reference for that record? I mean these are probably not only the GS titles and the minors should be cited properly otherwise the editor is right if we stick to the rules of Wikipedia...I mean anyone can add any kind of number to that infobox but even the Margaret Court career statistics doesn't list them all and that article is also unsourced. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nIt's not being removed because of it's accuracy... it's being removed because the editor wants no pre-open era stats in the box. 192 per sports birthdays. I have seen talk at tennis forum that it could be 194. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI see your point. Then it's a case of unexplained removal of sourced content. Probably it's his self-proclaimed idea of what an infobox should look like. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nExactly. Now obviously even with sources, the older records could be off because...well... they're old records that weren't documented as well. So i guess we use the small amount of sources we can find and if we come across better more substantial sources we'll just edit the numbers accordingly. But he seemed to be saying...since they are pre-1968 wins they aren't really wins. That I find very narrow-minded in tennis history. Plus with Margaret Court's infobox we actually show both totals anyway. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nHello all. I'm relatively new to Wikipedia (as an editor), but I was hoping to share with you a project that I've been working on that will hopefully excite you guys. I want to build a bot to check the statistics in the grand slam singles performance timelines for players. Please check the user page for HawkEyeBot for some more details. I'm mostly done with the code base, but I do need to implement a framework to communicate with the WikiMedia API. I'm not sure how long that will take, but for now, I can run the wiki text through my script and get the correct replacement output. Hopefully this bot with alleviate the pain associated with users incrementing win/loss counts incorrectly. Anyways, let me know if this will be useful for the community! sitongpeng (talk)\n\nQuestions:\n\nIs there always a Singles Performance Timeline section/subsection for players that have appeared in a slam?\n\nWhy do only certain pages include a Singles Performance Timeline that shows performance for the Olympics and other Masters tournaments? Is there a rhyme or reason to why some players get that and some don't?\n\nAlso, please let me know if you guys are interested in having HawkEyeBot make these statistics fixes. I want to get a dialogue going. Thanks, sitongpeng (talk)\n\nHi, I've updated HawkEyeBot's page to be a little more specific and I've included links to a trial run I did on wikia. I'd love to hear your comments. sitongpeng (talk)\n\nHere is the BRFA for HawkEyeBot if anyone wants to track the progress of the bot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/HawkEyeBot Sitong(talk)\n\nI think we have a tried and true rivalry now between these two just based on their meetings in the finals of some very prestigious tournaments like the Australian Open last year and the US Open this year, which was split amongst the two. In addition, the two have won a final in the Masters Series against each other over the last two years. Source HotHat (talk)\n\nI agree that Djokovic - Murray can now be called a rivalry and deserves an article. It does qualify according to WP:NSPORT as there is now a significant media coverage on this topic. Perhaps it would be useful to augment this generic NSPORT rivalry guideline with specific tennis criteria such as e.g. at least 15 head-to-head matches of which at least 5 finals and both players need to be or have been in the top 5 with at least one player in the top 3. Specific tennis criteria could help to balance possible overeager press coverage.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nDo we need a list like this when we already have a well-referenced List of Grand Slam men's singles champions? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nNope...not in my opinion. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI don't think we do. We already have so many lists on Grand Slams and I don't see what this particular (unsourced) list adds to that collection.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAlthough I don't know if uselessness is enough for an AfD. Of course the lack of sources would easily push it through but I'm afraid some editor addicted to lists could easily save this by Googleing \"all Grand Slam finals\" and could come up with e.g. an ESPN page where it was published. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nWell, it has all the finalists in one place, which AFAIK is not true of the other pages, so (to me) it is far from useless. IMO it would be better to improve it by adding links to player pages, and perhaps scores also. Rmallett (talk)\n\nLajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nThat's interesting in itself, because commentators often say that there are no rules regarding rackets; and, for example, that there is nothing to stop a player using one racket in each hand. Rmallett (talk)\n\nIt could happen that this regulation was reversed decades later. Also there are only a few ambidextrous players, and currently there are none of them in the mainstream scene. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nThere are definitely rules on the dimensions of rackets and their hitting surface (ITF Rulebook Appendix II) and the ITF in 1978 outlawed the famous Spaghetti Racket (1, 2).--Wolbo (talk)\n\nBefore I forget...magnificent work on the Giorgio de Stefani article, Lajbi! Massive improvement in a short period of time.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThanks. Funnily enough it was him that forced the governing body to introduce that rule for the first time . Although I preferred the original hook (voted down) for the DYK that was: \"that 1932 French Championships Runner-up Giorgio de Stefani almost reinstated tennis to the programme of Olympics as an IOC member in 1966 when his initiative was vetoed due to technical errors?\".\n\nAnyway I try to set a standard for newly created articles here, which could give their DYK an easy push. And draw attention to those articles that are only couple of sentences long and could be fivefold expanded at no time to get featured on the opening page. It worth trying since Giorgio's article got 2000 hits, which is quite good compared to the fact that mostly history-related articles gather such ammount of clicks usually. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI know we recently talked about this again but somehow I can't find it in the guidelines or here. Clarifying... we update stats like weeks at number 1, or rankings, on Monday when the ATP/WTA update the stats on their websites, not before. Correct? Those websites are used as our sources and if they are not updated we don't update. Without those sources to verify it would be original research or WP:Crystal Ball. Today I reverted Tennis records of the Open Era – Men's Singles and ATP World Tour records for just this sort of thing, from editors who have been editing tennis articles for awhile, so I wanted to make sure we are all still on the same page with this issue. I'm sure someone like Wolbo could find the last time we discussed this but it's eluding me right this second. Thanks. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nHad to look for a minute (sometimes you recall there's been a discussion but can't exactly remember where) and this I believe is the last discussion on the topic: Talk:List_of_ATP_number_1_ranked_singles_players#Updating_to_future_dates. And yes, we agreed to follow ATP/WTA with their updates but haven't yet added that to the Article Guidelines.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI just want to thank you guys for updating these stats every week throughout the ATP / WTA seasons, much appreciated. Rmallett (talk)\n\nOf course now I looked and found it was added to the guidelines under Player Articles. I just tightened the wording to when atp/wta update as opposed to just Mondays.

Couldn't find a similar article for the men's championship which started back in 1898. Does anyone know if we have one or is this an omission? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nI think I noticed that before. We certainly need the men's in there too. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nRecently editor CO_MEIJER created a bunch of articles but was blocked for doing this in Dutch language. Most of his articles are needed here and many of them were saved from speedy deletion, although they remained in very poor quality and uncited (speedy criteria were passed by simply adding DC,ITF and tennisarchives links to each bio). These pages are Jan van der Heide, Hans van Swol, Robert Van Meegeren, Allen Morris (tennis), Josef Knottenbelt, Ody Koopman, John Linck, Fred Dehnert, Johannes van Dalsum, Ian Ayre (tennis), Andrew Lloyd (tennis), John Fraser (tennis). Please have a look at them if you have time. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nNoticed these a while ago. It's good they were kept and have at least been translated so they can be further improved as time goes by. Two of the articles, Hans van Swol and Allen Morris (tennis) weren't created by CO MEIJER but could still use a boost.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI started to push them to some acceptable level beginning with Jan van der Heide. It's really frustrating to see this wave of stubs growing over our capacity. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAn editor has expressed some concern about the notability of this article, wondering if perhaps it's simply a promotion page. It looks like one to me and he doesn't appear notable as a tennis coach. Any thoughts? Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThe same case that happened with Oscar Wegner. But sad news is it is almost impossible to get it AfD'd, because a well-sourced (or seems to be well-sourced) article usually deceive other editors. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nLajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nFirstly, the Davis Cup homepage describes the 2012 Davis Cup as \"the 100th final\" here, but according to the Davis Cup article here on Wikipedia (and my manual count of wiki articles), it is the 101st tournament. Can anyone clarify, preferably with a reference in the article in question? Secondly there seems to be no information about how the home team is decided. Does anyone have any information about this which could be incorporated into the article? Thanks Cloudz679\n\nThere was a tournament but no final in 1974. From 1974 Davis Cup: \"The final was scratched and South Africa was awarded the Davis Cup after India refused to travel to South Africa for the final in protest of the South African government's apartheid policies.\" PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThe official site is inconsistent about whether to include 1974 in the count of finals. http://m.daviscup.com/en/news/article.aspx?id=29930 says about the 2009 final: \"This is the 98th Davis Cup Final\". I guess that should be considered an error, and the more prominent claim that 2012 was the 100th final is the official policy.\n\nSee printed page 12 (document page 17) \"Choice of Ground\" in 2012 ITF Davis Cup Regulations. The home team is the opposite of the last time the two teams met. If they haven't met since 1970 then draw lots. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nWow, great response here, I have added the information about the hosting to the main article. Feel free to reword as necessary.

Federer's and Nadal's 2012 season articles are updated long time ago, I find it unbelievable that's not the case with the No. 1 for the second-consecutive year. BoDu (talk)\n\n2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season was fully covered back then and the we has a wikiproject kinda taskforce for improving it at the end of the year around December. It was even peer reviewed. No need to be enraged about it, sooner or later we'll get there and catch up with ourselves. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nDjokovic is currently the best player in the world. Djokovic's 2012 season finished on 12 November. There was need to update this article before December. BoDu (talk)\n\nAs some of you might have noticed I've been putting together this list for a while and it's finally ready. I tried to pay attention more and learn from the mistakes of the 1931 article. So this time it's a bit less hectic, I set up a tournament schedule first and then fill it up, I included every tournament that was continued the next year, cover all areas, be more straight with the usage of flags and names, etc. Have a look at it if you feel so. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nImpressive article! Really adds value to the body of information on tennis history. Keep it up the good work, only 70 or so more years to go.... --Wolbo (talk)\n\nHopefully the early years and the wartime seasons will be shorter and faster to create...sometime. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI'm not sure Wikipedia is correct in the timing of the transition from the Championship Series and World Series to the International Series Gold and International Series. These navboxes indicate that the International Series (Gold) started in 1998 while the ATP Tour article for 1997 already mentions the International Series in the key table. Many tournament year articles for 1997, 1998 and 1999 also mention them as being part of the Internationals Series (Gold).\n\nHowever, the official ITF World of Tennis annuals make no mention of the International Series for the years 1997, 1998 or 1999. According to the 2001 annual the transition to the International Series (Gold) took place in 2000 (together with the transition of Super 9 tournaments to the Tennis Masters Series) and was part of a marketing deal with ISL. The 2001 annual does not specifically discuss the transition to the International Series but has a list of tournaments titled 'Men's International Series 1' (p.151) and 'Men's International Series 2' (p.155). No mention of the term 'Gold' is made. At the top of these lists it mentions \"Formerly known as Championship Series tournaments\" and \"Formerly known as World Series tournaments\" respectively.\n\nI could not find any prior discussion of this on the Talk pages. Should we update the articles in line with the World of Tennis annuals? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nInteresting. There seems to be a confusion within the tennis body itself (which is not suprising) as ITF uses the word International Series Gold officially in 2008 VADA report. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nOkay, I misread the first part. So it's not contrary to the current state of navboxes (it actually supports them) but to the World of Tennis. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nIt's not about the term 'International Series (Gold)' in itself but about the timing of it's introduction. Were the Championship Series and World Series renamed to International Series (Gold) in 1998 (as the navboxes indicate) or even 1997 (see 1997 ATP Tour article) or in 2000 as the World of Tennis annual mentions? That at least is not clear to me.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nOh I see. This publication states \"Twelve of the more prestigious Grand Prix events later were labeled International Series Gold while the remaining (approximately 60) became known as the International Series. The format continued from the 1998 season to the present, although slightly reorganized in 2009\", which is strange because it uses the word \"continued\" but it obvously excludes the 2000 start date. And it seems like a really throughout reliable source. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nIt looks very reliable but I'm pretty sure we can't use Wikipedia as a reliable source for Wikipedia.. ;-) --Wolbo (talk)\n\nJeez! That was a KO to me. I think I give up. Maybe you should just be bold and change it as your magazines imply. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nTried to find more sources. Wasn't easy, there's enough to be found on the launch of the Tennis Masters Series in 2000 but not much on the launch of the International Series (Gold). Found two sources that corroborate the launch in 2000 instead of 1997: 1) 'Neues Reglement der ATP' A German website that mentions the International Series as part of a new tournament setup for 2000 and 2) This site which seems to have official press releases and one of them, 'ATP TOUR $1.2 BILLION VISION' mentions \"Establishment of ATP Champions Race 2000...and which links the four Grand Slams, the new Tennis Masters Series and 60 other tournaments on the ATP Tour now to be known as the International Series\".--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAnother source shows that the St. Petersburg Open was still a World Series event in 1999, again supporting the claim that the International Series only began in 2000. I have started to update the relevant articles and navboxes to reflect this. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nAn RfC discussion about the MOS:FLAG restriction on the use of flag icons for sportspeople has been opened at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Icons. We invite all interested participants to provide their opinion here. Qwyrxian (talk)\n\nAs I was writing the 1930 in tennis and the 1931 in tennis I came across a couple of Types of tennis match, which is missing entirely in Wikipedia while it was popular back in the last century. One of them is the \"handicap match\", completely missing from Glossary of tennis terms, not mentioned in the disambig Handicap page nor in the Handicapping article. The second one, which is somewhat related to that is \"scratch\", whose tennis meaning is also missing from the corresponding disambig page. Both of them can be added from Spalding's official lawn tennis annual for 1911. Any newer source you know of or ideas about a separate article maybe? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nWell, I did not know we had a Glossary of tennis terms but a reference to the handicap system should definitely be included. The handicap system seems to have been used with some regularity in the last part of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, often as an additional event at a tournament. It's a pretty elaborate system and I was thinking about adding a paragraph on it to the History of tennis article but haven't come around to it yet.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nYes it was a distinct event within a tournament. Check Spalding pp. 241-243. There's everything about it, still I don't know if it was put out of effect or modified later.Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAdded handicapping to the Glossary of tennis terms. Max Robertson's Encyclopedia of Tennis (1974) also has a paragraph explaining this system. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nNice job. Happy New Year folks! Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nCreated a redirect from Handicap (tennis). Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nHello members. Yesterday, the Women's Tennis Association updated the layout of their website. The URLs of the player profiles changed. Fortunately, however, the links weren't broken – I've updated the template {{WTA}} accordingly and used the opportunity to create a documentation page. There are some problems with the revamp though, namely that not all the links are working just yet – the site still has some problems. I came across this forum which comments most of the changes. I fear that some of our infobox statistics will become harder to update, career high rankings aren't dated anymore (only the year in parentheses) and most of the players' templates in Category:WTA Tour navigational boxes will become unworkable if the sort-by-nationality function isn't included. All-in-all, I just wanted to make a note of this here so everyone is aware of the change. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nI'm not into Women updates but it needs attention then if the revamp gets over. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nYou can still see the highest ranking date on itftennis.com. But yes, I agree, that updating the WTA stats will be harder in the future. --Stryn (talk)\n\nI have written to the webmasters to ask for the reintroduction of functions lost since the revamp and will keep my fingers crossed. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nShould we start to fix broken WTA-links[5]? If anyone knows how to fix the links using AWB, tell me. --Stryn (talk)\n\nThe links using the {{WTA}} template are not broken, only the bare direct links. I don't think there are so many of them, but it would be good to switch to the template anyway. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nAbout 690 bare url profile links as you can see here. --Stryn (talk)\n\nWe should ask for a bot to be written to do that. If there's a convertable logic between the new and the old URLs then it wouldn't be a complicated one. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI think that it's pretty easy: http://www.wtatennis.com/page/Player/[Info / Activity / Stats]/0,,12781~[PROFILE ID],00.html → http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/[PROFILE ID]. --Stryn (talk)\n\nAs I said, I don't think there are that many bare links. Of that list you've posted, Stryn, I simply chose one article at random, Kim Grajdek, and that article uses the template – the external link isn't broken. Maybe the list just hasn't picked up on all of the changes due to the WP:JQ. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nOk, I didn't check any articles of the list. Then we can try following search: [6]. There is a few wrong links. --Stryn (talk)\n\nIt has only been five days since I wrote them a mail, but I very much doubt that I will get a reply. I think we can assume that the ranking-by-nationality feature will not be re-introduced to the WTA website, so I ask the question again: what shall we do with the (majority of the) templates in Category:WTA Tour navigational boxes? Some can of course be updated manually by checking all of the players' rankings, but in doing this, it can be very easy to miss one, especially if there is a new ranking or for some of the countries with players spread out over the top one thousand places. I had been doing the updates over the past months for some templates, but thinking about this is causing headache. Although I'd be sad to see the navboxes go, if they can't be reliably updated, should I not take them to WP:CFD? Jared Preston (talk)\n\nhttp://www.wtatennis.com/press-center has links to pdf files with rankings sorted by country. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThey are currently dated 10 December. Hopefully they will be updated better during the WTA season. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThey were finally updated for this week and currently say 31 December 2012. I guess that means WTA intends to update them during the WTA season. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nWTA has updated profile pages little bit. Now there is also date for highest ranking. --Stryn (talk)\n\nWould it be good to include OOP for these event because it's mainly only grand slam and it would be much better to include these as well. Matt294069 (talk)\n\nOh, yes we can, good idea! But always remember Raul's Laws, when it comes to suggesting things or complaining, but this is suggesting. This is what it said, and is the most pertinent information to \"be prepared for the fact that doing so will make it your job\".HotHat (talk)\n\nI was reading some tournament article when i noticed the doubles seeds rankings in the tables seemed to be the sum of the positions of each player. I found this a little confusing, and i think that posting the doubles ranking of each player is more straightforward. It may be something like this:\n\nPlayer Rank Player Rank Seed Colin Fleming 31 Ross Hutchins 33 1 Santiago González 35 Scott Lipsky 36 2 Treat Conrad Huey 42 Dominic Inglot 82 3 Jamie Delgado 79 Ken Skupski 68 4\n\n(The original table can be found in 2012 BB&T Atlanta Open#Seeds 2)\n\nIf not, we can add a footnote under the table stating that \"rank\" actually means the team's combined rankings.\n\nPlease let me know what you think. Faute de pied (talk)\n\nI think that a footnote would be the best option. Perhaps just something like this:\n\nThe \"Rank\" used for seeding is the combined doubles rank of the two players as of <date>\n\nThoughts? SellymeTalk\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but the team ranking is actually the combined sum of the doubles OR singles ranking of the two players counting the one, which is better for each (this is a rule adopted couple of years back to encourage singles players to enter doubles tournaments). Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nThat's quite confusing. Perhaps it would be best to just omit the \"rank\" column entirely and just have the seed numbers, then? With such a convuluted system the actual number thrown up by rank is pretty worthless. SellymeTalk\n\nPrecisely. The table apparently shows the doubles ranking but doesn't specify whether it is or not. We're certain that the singles seeds are based on the singles rankings, at least in the majority of tournaments. I don't know the criteria for doubles, but take the case of 2011 Indian Wells where Federer and Stan Wawrinka weren't seeded and one could assume, because of their ranking, that they should've been. It's just more complicated than the combined doubles rankings only, what happens if we have let's say Team A 1st and 4th and Team B 2nd and 3rd? Add tournaments like Wimbledon that count other variables and it ends up making no sense at all. Faute de pied (talk)\n\nI see an editor has split the article Tennis performance timeline comparison (women) into 3 articles and maybe more. It had been brought up on the talk page as being 200+k in size and that some had trouble loading the article. Wikipedia has limits of 100k (at least in readable prose) but also we have to make sure readers don't have too much trouble loading the page. I had mentioned that maybe it should be split when another editor asked but right now it is being split in 37k size pages which seems WAY to small to me for charts. I thought maybe others had an opinion on whether it should be split at all or split in two or split in three? Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI noticed the discussion and it looked like there was no clear consensus on what to do in terms of splitting the article. It appears someone is jumping the gun / being bold and started to split up the article and I'm not quite sure what the aimed for result is. While the article size argument is valid it is also true that the more you split up the original article the more it loses its informational value so it seems logical to split it into the largest pieces allowable.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI have noticed a widespread misuse of Template:Main across tennis articles. Two examples include 2012 Rafael Nadal tennis season([7]) and 2013 Australian Open – Men's Singles([8]). The purpose of Template:Main, as stated in its documentation, is to accompany a summary within a higher level article, so that the reader can link to the detail that is being summarised. It is not to be used at the top of an article to help navigate 'up' the hierarchy. The solution is to include the link within the lead paragraph, e.g. \"The Men's singles competition of the 2013 Australian Open...\" If there are no objections, I will begin fixing these. --Jameboy (talk)\n\nI've never thought of that until today and never thought about it as being misleading or wrong usage. One thing is what its documentation says (possibly written by one editor/creator) and what it is actually used for in my opinion. It's the difference of being prescriptive or descriptive. Since the community has used widely this (I estimate that a hundred of articles are affected) to level-up the hierarchy as you said and it worked fine I think it doesn't need to be changed. Instead one should edit the documentation of the template to include this type of possible use or initiate a discussion about it on its talk page. Why not have a template like this to navigate through subarticles? And since I cannot think of a template that could easily replace it right now and I think that intro (which is fine, don't get me wrong) would require a huge amount of work to be added to all articles that uses it (and a partial result would be half of the articles using the Main template and half of them the new intro, which is inconsistent), to avoid confusion it's better be left as it is. No visitor ever argued about the readability of said articles to this point and possibly found the header easy to click on instead of reading a whole intro to find the link they are looking for. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI agree that this should be made a correct usage. It's convenient, it looks nice, and there's no good reason not to use it as such. Is there any actual rationale for not wanting to use them as hierarchy navigation? SellymeTalk\n\nLooks like it's been talked about several times with anyone responding that it should not be used as a \"see also\", buy nothing was ever done about it. See Template_talk:Main#incorrect_use.3F and Template_talk:Main#Problems_with_the_use_and_description_of_this_template and Template_talk:Main#Does_this_template_need_better_wording.3F and Template_talk:Main#Main_and_Details. Basically they say we should be using {{details}} or {{further}}. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThe rationale is that you will have thousands of articles with needless hatnotes, when the same link(s) can easily and more naturally be placed in the lead. That something requires a huge amount of work is not really relevant. The point is whether it is the right thing to do. Wikipedia should have a consistent look and feel, and we can only attain that if templates are used consistently. It now seems that someone has recently changed the documentation to allow usage of Main in lead sections. In my opinion this makes things worse and only serves to cause confusion as to what is a \"main\" article. I think the best solution would be to get rid of the word \"main\" entirely. However, I am going off-wiki for a while, so I'm not going to worry about it. --Jameboy (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nis there a reliable site recording all (or at least notable) head-to-head records of single players? Regards.--Tomcat (7)\n\nYes, atpworldtour.com. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nhttp://www.atpworldtour.com for ATP, http://www.wtatennis.com/head2head for WTA.

And there have been other 6–0 6–0 finals. I changed it. Thanks. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI've noticed that editors have been including junior grand slam results in players' career statistics pages, specifically under \"grand slam finals\". I am proposing that junior grand slam results be omitted from these pages and be merged into a player's main article instead under \"junior career\" for example. I think the career statistics pages should only be documenting professional results from the ATP or WTA Tours. Thoughts? JayJ47 (talk)\n\nI certainly don't agree with putting those stats under Grand Slam tournament results...maybe a separate table. What pages are putting the junior results under grand slam finals? Most player articles shouldn't even have a career stats page as they don't warrant it. It's better in keeping up with editing that all items are in one article unless it's simply too large. Too large being a rough combo of 50k of prose, 150k of wikitext or 750k file size. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nAgnieszka Radwańska career statistics and Victoria Azarenka career statistics are two examples of what I've been talking about. JayJ47 (talk)\n\nWe are discussing the removal of this new article at Talk:WTA Big Three and whether it should be deleted, parked for future use, or remain as is. The article Big Four (tennis) was recently created but the term has been talked about a lot for 2 years, and off and on for a couple more years. I can't see \"WTA Big Three\" being an encyclopedic entry right now, but maybe if these 3 girls dominate the scene another year and half we may need the article. Please join the discussion at Talk:WTA Big Three. Thanks. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI just found this article recently which was created and expanded into its current form in 2007. Although it has been tagged refimprove-tag since then but still it looks like a very throughout article, which could be easily promoted to a Good Article without any big effort in my estimation. Anyone interested in giving it a try? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nWe have some editors who like to update player rankings prematurely, against guidelines. I have mentioned to one editor that we go by sources of the WTA or ATP when they update their own official pages, though I suppose that if ESPN posted rankings early it would be a legit source. They're usually are a week behind though. However he came back with a different source for the WTA rankings of tennis4wta.com. I can't tell whether this is a personal blog we can use, simply \"projected\" rankings, or whatever. It seems to have no contact or section about their sourcing. Can we use this as a legitimate source of information? Thanks. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIt is owned by some Turkish guy, whose name and his company shows no relation with the WTA at least not by Google. This page floods the visitor with a bunch of pop-ups and as far as I know official sites do not need pop-ups to generate money. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nIt's not a reliable source, so better that we don't use it. --Stryn (talk)\n\nThis is clearly not a reliable source and I see no reason or benefit to rely on other websites besides the official WTA and ATP sites.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI've already brought this issue up couple of month before with the mixed doubles champions. This time the Template:French Championships women's doubles champions and the List of French Open women's doubles champions don't show the same champions for years 1907-24. Do we have a reliable source to clean this up? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nIt seems that the Template:French Championships women's doubles champions navbox shows the World Hard Court Championships winners for the years 1914 – 1924. From 1925 onwards it shows the French Championships winners and becomes identical to the List of French Open women's doubles champions. Even though the WHCC for this period was an official ITF World Championship it doesn't mean that it was the same tournament as the French Championship. It wasn't and therefore in my view the 1914 – 1924 entries should be removed from Template:French Championships women's doubles champions.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAny objections to updating the women's doubles navbox so that it only shows winners from 1925 onward (see example men's doubles)?--Wolbo (talk)\n\nActually I think that would be a partial mistake. While prior to 1925 the French championships were not an international Major, they were still the French championships. If the title of the templates were French grand slam champions then absolutely it would be from 1925 onward. But these templates are French Open Championships which I would think would be from 1907 on for the ladies. I would vote for the men's to follow the same format. Obviously the way it is now is wrong since it has the WHCC listed. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI'm fine with that solution and agree it is more in line with the title of the navboxes. It is also the existing setup for the men's singles, women's singles and mixed doubles navboxes so that's another reason to go for this option. To make it consistent we'll have to change the men's and women's doubles navboxes.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nWhile on the subject I noticed we don't have any year articles for the 1891 – 1924 period of the French Championships. Is this by design / agreement or is it just the case that nobody has gotten around to it ye"
