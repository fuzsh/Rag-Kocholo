        "text": "Mark Kuhn intended to spend this week at the All England Lawn Tennis Club for the famed Wimbledon Championships.\n\nInstead of sipping a Pimm’s Cup courtside, rubbing shoulders with tennis royalty and learning from the best of the best in grass court maintenance in London, Mark is tidying up his own replica of Wimbledon’s Centre Court at the All Iowa Lawn Tennis Club. Surrounded by towering wind turbines among sprawling fields of corn and soybeans on the Kuhn Family Farm near Charles City, the lush green grass court is a labor of love for its steward and an emerging institution in the tennis world. Indeed, Wimbledon itself has just published a video in tribute to its unofficial sister court in Iowa.\n\nBut the journey has not been all strawberries and cream, another staple at the All England and All Iowa clubs. Four years ago this month, Mark experienced the highest of highs while working alongside groundskeepers during Wimbledon, and the lowest of lows, losing his son and rising community leader Alex James Kuhn, both within the same week.\n\nNow, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the stars are aligning for the start of a new chapter for Mark, his wife, Denise, and the All Iowa, one that could help sustain the court for future generations and honor their late son by benefiting causes close to his heart.\n\n“This is a purpose for me, knowing he (Alex) would want me to do this,” Mark, 69, said of his mission to preserve his late son’s memory and build a legacy for his family, Iowans and tennis fans everywhere. “It’s a good way to move on, and it’s the only way that works for me.”\n\nDiscovering tennis, Wimbledon and ‘a great spot for a tennis court’\n\nIn 1947, Mark’s mother and grandfather moved their family home a mile from the site where it was built to its current location on the farm, about 35 miles southeast of Mason City.\n\nHis first introduction to tennis came in 1960 while listening to BBC’s live coverage of a Wimbledon match on his grandfather’s shortwave radio.\n\n“We listened to many things,” he said. “It was a wonderful way to escape and go wherever the radio took us.”\n\nEverything about the sport, from its unique 15-30-40-game scoring — and the odd use of “love” for a score of zero — to the Queen’s English commentary on the Wimbledon broadcast, hooked the young boy.\n\nOver the next couple of years, Mark developed a love for the game and practiced it as much as he could, thanks in large part to his mother's willingness to drive him to neighboring towns to compete against other junior players. One day on the farm in 1962, as Mark, then 11, struggled to lead his sister’s stubborn pony, Chico, to a water trough, he first envisioned building a tennis court there.\n\n“I was thinking of all of the places I’d rather be than right here right now, and then it came to me right then,” he said, remembering himself studying their fenced-in cattle feedlot. “I said, ‘This is a great spot for a tennis court.’”\n\nAnd sure enough, after taking measurements that day, Mark deemed the area a prime place to build a 78-by-36-foot regulation court someday.\n\nFulfilling a childhood dream\n\nForty years passed before Mark pursued his long-planned project. The sudden death of a neighboring farmer and friend motivated him to dig up the longstanding cattle lot and begin construction of a tennis court in summer 2002.\n\nThe transformation was no simple feat. Mark and his crew of family and friends removed several trees to make room for 16 truckloads of sandy soil, six rows of drainage tubes and 15 pop-up sprinklers.\n\nAt the helm of the volunteer effort were Mark’s two sons, Alex and Mason, who helped craft and paint the 600-plus white posts for the English garden-themed picket fence that borders the court.\n\n“They bought into it right from the start,” Mark said of the family effort. “It was my passion, but the whole family did it.”\n\nAfter a full summer of hard and heavy work, Mark and Alex took on one of the most tedious tasks of the whole job over Labor Day weekend, requiring every ounce of the enthusiasm and perseverance that Alex was known for. Sitting on cloths with plastic pails in tow, the father-son duo scooted themselves around the court and picked up every pebble in sight.\n\nEliminating rocks from the surface made way for the first seeding of creeping bentgrass.\n\n‘If you grow it, they will come’\n\nIn a letter to friends and neighbors ahead of the soft opening of the All Iowa grounds in September 2003, Mark referenced a motivating mantra throughout the construction process: “If you grow it, they will come.”\n\nHe was inspired by the classic “If you build it, he will come” line in “Field of Dreams,” the 1989 fictional film about an Iowa farmer’s mystical baseball diamond carved out of a cornfield. (The movie site is in Dyersville, 120 miles southeast of the All Iowa.)\n\nMore: New MLB matchup set for Field of Dreams game this summer\n\nThe Kuhns officially opened their court to the public in summer 2006. Just as a fleet of vehicles flock to the remote ball field at the end of “Field of Dreams,” hordes of tennis fans and players began visiting the All Iowa.\n\nThe family hosted their first tournament that season and were featured for the first time in the Des Moines Register and Tennis Magazine. Since then, Mark’s records show they have hosted nearly 7,500 guests.\n\nThe court is “one of a kind,” said Ryan Knarr, a tennis pro and tournament director in Pennsylvania with numerous ties to the United States Tennis Association.\n\nOut of all the surfaces tennis is played on throughout the world — asphalt, carpet, clay, natural grass, artificial turf and even wood — nothing represents the original essence of the game better than grass, Knarr said.\n\n“Grass court tennis is really on a pedestal because of the limited number of courts and the level of care and precision it takes to nurture the surface,” he said. “It’s just a beautiful thing, and what Mark has done at the All Iowa is world class.”\n\nBecause of its tradition-rich past, Wimbledon is often referred to as the “crown jewel” of tennis, and some of the tournament’s pageantry is displayed on the Kuhns’ screened-in porch that overlooks their court. Nicknamed the “Queen’s Box,” it holds many Kuhn family tennis items Denise has collected over the years and several one-of-a-kind Wimbledon artifacts.\n\n“She’s everything here,” Mark said of Denise, whom he refers to as the club’s behind-the-scenes “queen.”\n\nWhile generous guests have made donations to the All Iowa over the years, the couple has never charged a fee to play on the court. They find pleasure in sharing their adoration for the game and its history with like-minded fans.\n\n“This place means a lot to a lot of people, and it’s quite an honor to host them,” Mark said. “We might’ve created something that people love.”\n\nExperiencing Wimbledon up close\n\nFollowing the public launch of the court, Mark wrote a series of letters to the head groundsman at the All England club, requesting an internship at the 40-court facility.\n\nIn 2012, two years after his 12-year-run in the Iowa House of Representatives, he was invited to work alongside the highly touted grounds crew for the first time.\n\nAlthough the longtime grain farmer had significant experience growing crops, he did not have any formal training in turfgrass management. In fact, experts at Iowa State University initially tried to dissuade Mark from building the court because of Iowa's harsh winters and the immense amount of upkeep involved. Shadowing leading professionals in the field ahead of the Wimbledon fortnight in 2012 had a tremendous impact on him, and eventually, his home court.\n\nGiven complementary Centre Court tickets and ground passes the next year, Mark, accompanied by Denise, returned to the All England club as a spectator.\n\nAlex Kuhn, who picked up tennis as an adult after helping build the All Iowa, joined his father at The Championships in 2015. On opening day, they watched eventual champion Novak Djokovic defeat Philipp Kohlschreiber from coveted first-row seats on Centre Court, a gift from the All England grounds staff.\n\nHighlights for Alex included his separate encounters with former Wimbledon men’s singles champions Lleyton Hewitt and Rafael Nadal.\n\n“He (Alex) just got along with everybody,” Mark said. “It was a marvelous week, and my dream of taking Alex was fulfilled.”\n\nAround this time in his life, Alex developed a keen interest in improving the All Iowa. Among other recommended changes, he set a goal to replace the creeping bentgrass on his family’s court with perennial ryegrass to resemble the courts at the All England Club.\n\nIn 2016, on Mark's fourth trip to the tournament in five years, he hit his peak of Wimbledon glory when he was given the opportunity to serve as an honorary court attendant for the entire two-week event.\n\nDuring his father’s absence, Alex proudly prepared the All Iowa for the start of what promised to be another busy summer season.\n\nA father and son's last goodbye\n\nFour days after Mark’s return from the once-in-a-lifetime residency at the All England Club, the family reunited for a cookout on the farm.\n\nAlex, who was scheduled to play in a tournament the next day in Ames, had hoped to warm up his “cannonball” serve, which Mark said once plowed down a post in the picket fence. But the court had just been watered, so the surface was too wet for anyone to hit balls back and forth.\n\nMark, Denise and Alex’s two sons, Rylan and Collan, had plans to go watch Alex compete.\n\nAlex, a Mason City councilman, had been through a tough couple of months after casting one of the votes that blocked a proposed pork plant from coming to town. Many of Alex's constituents worried about health and environmental impacts, but many state and local powerbrokers wanted the plant for jobs and economic development.\n\nWhile Alex's kindness may have made him vulnerable at times, his political career was unlimited, Mark said.\n\n“He listened and truly cared for people and stood up for them when they needed help,” he said. \"He was a person you'd vote for and trust.\"\n\nAs Alex left the farm that night, he waved out of the window of his car, smiled and said, ‘See you tomorrow, Dad.’ He drove out of the lot, and that was the last time the Kuhns saw their son.\n\nAlex, 34, took his own life. His car and body were found the next day, July 15, 2016, at the end of a dead-end road about halfway between the farm and his home.\n\nThe All Iowa was closed for the rest of the season, canceling about 70 court reservations that summer.\n\nClimbing ‘out of the darkness’\n\nThe Kuhns have said Alex had at times seen a therapist and taken anxiety medication, but they were unaware of the extent of their son’s depression. They believe it was one of the leading causes of his suicide.\n\nWendy Martinez, current chair of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Iowa Chapter, welcomed Mark to her suicide bereavement support group in Mason City. She had worked with Alex several years earlier when he was a community organizer for United Way of North Central Iowa, and the news of his death hit her hard. Martinez remembers his radiating smile and the way he always made her feel like family.\n\n“Depression doesn’t discriminate in any way, shape or form,” she said. “It can touch any of our lives at any point.”\n\nIn a deep state of grief, mourning and aimlessness, Mark found solace in attending Martinez’s meetings and gathered the courage later that summer to reset his focus on the All Iowa — in honor of Alex.\n\nUsing it as another form of therapy, the grandfather of five followed his late son’s lead, and without telling Denise or anyone else, launched a complete renovation of the court in August 2016. He stripped the top layer of grass, and the Des Moines-based Iowa Cubs Sports Turf Management team rototilled and laser-leveled the area.\n\nAfter installing a new irrigation system, Mark seeded the court with 100% perennial ryegrass, producing a darker, firmer surface and accomplishing Alex’s goal. In June 2017, the Kuhns unveiled the new Alex J. Kuhn Court of Dreams and hosted the inaugural Alex J. Kuhn Invitational, with top-ranked juniors from Iowa and Minnesota. In addition, they established and began accepting donations for the Alex J. Kuhn Memorial Fund, with the sole intent and purpose of creating a sculpture.\n\nMark’s last vision of Alex leaving the farm will forever be etched in his mind. But so too are the myriad happy memories they shared together at the All Iowa, where Mark says Alex showed his civility, fair play and good sportsmanship every time he stepped on the court.\n\n“It’s those memories that helped bring me out of the darkness and gave me purpose to keep his legacy of leadership alive,” Mark said.\n\nA legacy set in stone\n\nThis summer marks the fourth anniversary of Alex’s death, and the Kuhns are planning to erect a bronze sculpture, which will depict him reading to his two sons, in front of the Mason City Public Library.\n\nSculpted by Colorado artist Bobbie Carlyle and titled “Today’s readers are tomorrow’s leaders,” the memorial recognizes Alex’s longtime dedication as a volunteer youth coach and weekly reader to children at elementary schools in Mason City.\n\nOver the past three years, the Kuhns have raised more than $65,000 for the Alex J. Kuhn Memorial Fund, which is held by the city of Mason City. Individual donors and businesses throughout Mason City and the rest of the state have contributed $50,000, while almost $15,000 has come from guests of the All Iowa.\n\nMark has already seeded the area around the future location of the sculpture with perennial ryegrass, the same type as at the All Iowa and All England clubs. The site also will feature a few benches for families to gather and read together.\n\nMark and Denise hope the new public landmark will remind anyone struggling with depression or mental illness to seek professional help.\n\n\"Suicidal thoughts can strike anyone and everyone, and we need to raise interest in our own mental health,\" Mark said.\n\nMartinez believes the piece will help educate the community that it is OK to talk about depression, mental illness and suicide.\n\n“There’s been a myth that if you talk about it (suicide), you’re going to promote it,” she said. “We haven’t talked about it for years, and we’re losing people constantly, so let’s try to do the opposite.”\n\nTaking this proactive approach, and asking people directly if they are feeling suicidal, can save someone’s life, Martinez said.\n\nStealing the Wimbledon spotlight\n\nWimbledon 2020 was set to run June 29-July 12, but like most other professional sporting events this spring and summer, the tournament was canceled because of public health concerns linked to the novel coronavirus.\n\nSix days ahead of what would have been opening day at the All England Club, the tournament published an emotional 10½-minute social media video about Mark and the history of the All Iowa. The interviews with Mark were filmed during summer 2019.\n\nWithin a day, Mark heard from six people, including four Europeans, who watched the feature and wanted to check out the All Iowa sometime. Within a week of its posting, the video had 150,000-plus views across Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nAmong the viewers moved by Mark’s story was professional tennis player Madison Keys, 25, a native of the Quad Cities region of eastern Iowa and western Illinois.\n\nKeys, a 2017 U.S. Open finalist and the world’s 13th-ranked women’s player, said she watched in awe as beautiful clips of the All Iowa flashed across the screen. Keys' grandparents run a corn and cattle farm in DeWitt, Iowa, just outside of the metro Quad Cities. She was stunned that such a court exists three hours from her hometown.\n\nKeys was heartbroken to learn of Alex’s death but was inspired by Mark's ability to bounce back after his tragic loss. An ambassador of a foundation called Kindness Wins, she felt compelled to act.\n\n“Being from Iowa and having such deep ties to Iowans, I just felt like I wanted to be part of this in some capacity because it’s such an amazing story,” said Keys, who asked her agent to contact Mark. “If I can also be a part of the new, happier beginning as it’s already taken shape, I would be so honored.”\n\nKeys hopes to play an exhibition charity match someday on Mark’s court.\n\n“I cannot wait to get some of my friends to believe that we’re all going to Iowa to play on the best grass court in the States,” Keys said. “That would be really fun.”\n\nHearing from Keys’ team and potentially forming a partnership is just another “dream come true,” Mark said.\n\nBut Keys is not the only person interested in playing a big match at the All Iowa. Before the Wimbledon video debuted June 23, Mark heard from Knarr, the tennis pro and tournament director from Pennsylvania.\n\nA member of the USTA National Adult Competition Committee, Knarr launched the independent Comeback Classic Series to bring back competitive tennis in early June after a three-month coronavirus-related hiatus.\n\nEager to host a tournament on a grass court, he reached out to Mark after East Coast private clubs with grass courts turned him away.\n\nMark welcomed the opportunity to partner with Knarr in hosting a small, no-spectator charity event to benefit the All Iowa, the first prize-money event of its 17-year history.\n\nScheduled for July 31-Aug. 1, the Court of Dreams Comeback Classic Invitational will feature eight elite players and could model the kinds of events that will help secure the All Iowa's future.\n\n“Our paths crossed at the right time, and I think it’s going to be a win-win for tennis and the All Iowa,” said Knarr, who envisions co-hosting an annual event to raise funds for the club. “I absolutely think this is the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nSustaining an ‘Iowa treasure’\n\nAlthough Mark officially stopped farming his family’s 800 acres of land and serving on the Floyd County Board of Supervisors in January 2019, he still surrounds himself with work.\n\nCurrently, he is establishing an official 501(c)(3) nonprofit called the All Iowa Lawn Tennis Club Foundation, which will allow the Kuhns to formally accept donations and fund initiatives on behalf of the All Iowa. Once it becomes official, the nonprofit will focus, among other things, on introducing people to grass court tennis and supporting reading programs for children, Mark said.\n\nHe worries from time to time about what could happen to the grounds of the All Iowa when he no longer can care for it. Nightmarish visions of long grass, weeds and a fallen fence flood his mind. But he believes he and Denise are on track to develop a sustainable path for the All Iowa, one they can pass on to future generations.\n\n“It’s a great relief for me knowing that this Iowa treasure will be here for anybody who wants to come by for a long time,” Mark said. “It’s part of my family's legacy now.\"\n\nJack Cullen is a content marketing manager and freelance journalist in Moline, Illinois, part of the Quad Cities. Contact him on Twitter at @JS_Cullen or by email at jackcullen09@augustana.edu.\n\nSuicide hotline: How to get help\n\nAnyone who is experiencing suicidal thoughts is encouraged to seek free help by calling the Suicide Prevention Hotline, 800-273-8255, or connecting via web chat with a mental health crisis counselor at suicidepreventionlifeline.org.\n\nWelcoming tennis back to the All Iowa\n\nBecause of COVID-19, Mark Kuhn had planned to limit play on his family's All Iowa Lawn Tennis Club this season and focus on other projects, including creation of an official nonprofit arm of the All Iowa.\n\nBut then Pennsylvania-based tournament director Ryan Knarr pitched him on the idea of hosting a small charity event to benefit the All Iowa, a grass-court complex at the Kuhn Family Farm near Charles City.\n\nThe Court of Dreams Comeback Classic Invitational, scheduled for July 31-Aug. 1, will feature eight elite players from Iowa, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, including former Iowa Hawkeye and two-time Big Ten Player of the Year Tyler Cleveland.\n\n“We were ready not to do anything because of COVID-19, but this just fell into our lap,” Kuhn said.\n\nSafety will be organizers' top priority, they said, and the following measures will be taken over the course of the event:\n\nPlayers and essential tournament personnel must pass daily temperature checks before entering the grounds.\n\nOn court, players will serve with their own set of balls and switch ends of the court only on set breaks; hand sanitizer will be available to players between sets and matches.\n\nOff the court, players and other personnel must maintain 6 feet of social distance and wear face coverings.\n\nSpectators will not be allowed at the event.\n\n“We essentially want to create a small bubble,” Knarr said. “Nothing’s bullet-proof, but we’re going to do everything we can to promote safety.”\n\nSponsored by the sports streaming app Small Player Big Play, this prize money event will be the first of its kind at the All Iowa in the club’s 17-year history. Every match will be streamed live, with play-by-play commentary. Viewers may pay a small fee to watch the action on the app, and streaming proceeds will benefit the All Iowa.\n\nA total of $2,000 in donor-sponsored entry fees also will be given to the All Iowa. Donors include Madison Keys, a native of the Quad Cities and the world’s 13th-ranked women’s player, and David Kramer, a family friend and son of tennis hall-of-famer Jack Kramer."
