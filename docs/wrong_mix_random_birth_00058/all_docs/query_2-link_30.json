        "text": "As Lleyton Hewitt has faded from the crabbed counter-puncher of his apoplectic middle period to a softened veteran relegated to the outer courts, untroubled by second week slam commitments and sated by proud dotage over his expanding brood, it's become possible, for a certain type of casual Australian tennis fan, to convince themselves that he's actually a pretty nice guy. In public, in recent times, he's come across as emollient, even self-deprecating: not a bad bloke, after all. Hewitt's victory in the first round at Wimbledon over Stanislas Wawrinka was timely in that sense: it offered us all the chance to remind ourselves, without the guilt that might come with putting a loser down, of what a thoroughly unpleasant player Hewitt has been during his career.\n\nWawrinka was no cheap scalp: in the unintentionally saucy language of the tennis writers, the world No10 is \"highly fancied\". The victory, as such, demanded respect – and since he was back in the victors' column, it also demanded a re-evaluation of the emerging consensus of Hewitt as a cuddly, benign former Stalin.\n\nBut now, after that brief opening of corrective clarity, he is gone again, undone in the second round by a Jamaican-German qualifier whose nonchalance, liquid wrists, whip-kick forehand, lust for the approach shot and all-round cool guy aura mark him, ironically, as a player embodying the best serve-volley traditions of Australia's storied tennis past. Hewitt, apart from a brief and unlikely third set rally, puttered about the court during his loss to Dustin Brown like a droopy doggy, lost in the embrace of an overwhelmingly supportive crowd. Did we go too soft on the man? Did we give him too much love? Did we not hand him, after that first round, enough bile to get him through the next?\n\nWith the exception of one glorious straight-sets victory over Pete Sampras in the 2001 US Open final, a match which prompted a volley of comparisons with Andre Agassi that have since turned out to be wildly generous, Hewitt has never been pretty to watch. Where other tennis players press running into the service of hitting balls, Hewitt always seemed more interested in ball-hitting exclusively as a demonstration of how much he could run. He offered a vision of tennis as an exercise in pure court coverage, applying throughout his most productive (which is to say, productively defensive) years a playing strategy common to filibustering Democrats in the Texas Senate: for as long as possible, string it out.\n\nBut Hewitt did more than just run and hit the occasional ball. He was the baseliner as bloviator, mixing his special brand of tireless track-back tennis with dependably humourless blasts of off- and on-court petulance. To start, there was the \"C'mon\", in its purest contralto form a strikingly pre-pubescent and unmediated expression of the charmless entitlement of the cocooned, elite athlete.\n\nFrom that platform, Hewitt sailed out into the world and discovered an astonishingly rich universe of people he didn't like: the Australian public (who he called \"stupid\" after they cheered for his opponent during a match in Adelaide in 2000); umpires (one of whom he called a \"spastic\" at the 2001 French Open); linesmen, (Hewitt famously appeared to accuse a black official of favouring his opponent James Blake at the 2001 US Open); the entire nation of Argentina (\"You really feel like killing him,\" Guillermo Coria once said, a sentiment that found a measure of confirmation when Hewitt was offered extraordinary security support for a Davis Cup tie in Buenos Aires in 2006); the organisers of the Australian Open (Hewitt has been a consistent critic of the court surface at Melbourne Park); and women (in 2009, Hewitt suggested female tennis players would not be able to last five sets). The one constant throughout this was that the more Hewitt took issue with the world around him, the more deeply entrenched he became as a fixture in the men's top 10.\n\nAn extravagance of talent can excuse all sorts of abuses. But Hewitt's talent was of a piece with his abuses: his greatest talent was for being angry all the time. Storming towards the umpire's chair with a look of death on his face as one of his balls was called out wasn't an additive to his tennis; it was his tennis. Hewitt has been the most completely negative player in the history of the sport: he has been at his best when enveloped in the negativity and hatred, perceived or otherwise, of those around him. Never has a persecution complex been so deeply entwined with an athlete's sense of his own ability.\n\nAustralian sport, especially Australian tennis, has never understood this type of athlete especially well. Until Hewitt came along, the titans of Australian tennis history were either dashing, skip-over-the-net gentlemen (Rod Laver, Lew Hoad) or larrikin, casual rebels, guys like John Newcombe and Pat Cash, who were as loose with their athletic mastery as they were with their fashion. Pat Rafter played (and won) a Davis Cup match while drunk in 1997, and has never left the affections of the Australian public since. But Hewitt was different. Hewitt needed his haters. He thrived on contempt – not just from other players, but from the very public he claimed to represent. Adulation cut him down.\n\nEven when he was smiling, you knew he was seething. That deserves special recognition, in a way – and perhaps explains why on Wednesday, against Brown, Hewitt cut such an oddly muted figure. Amid all the support, he couldn't feel the hate. This feels like a farewell. Out of respect for the man, let's make sure it's not a fond one."
