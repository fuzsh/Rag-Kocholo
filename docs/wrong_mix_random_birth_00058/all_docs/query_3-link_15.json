        "text": "On Monday night, immediately after ABC's The 7.30 Report's population debate, I watched the ineluctable defeat of Lleyton Hewitt. It struck me that the same national character traits were in evidence, both good and not so good. On one hand Hewitt reveals an admirable indomitable spirit. But the sublime ease of Federer's handling of Hewitt was disconcerting because it was horribly obvious what strategy the Australian needed to at least put up a fight: take risks and mix up his returns. Instead he remorsely, stubbornly, dumbly even, continued to plod away with the same old baseline cross-court shots almost as predictable as the tide. It was painful to watch.\n\nOne guesses at how many coaches, friends and observers (eg. commentator Jim Courier) have told him this but Hewitt seems no more able to alter his strategy than . . . well, than Australians can conceive of alternative ways to run their cities or car-based, sprawled urban lifestyle. Even as it steadily turns into a nightmare. Like Hewitt almost a decade ago when he was winning Wimbledon — likewise in a previous era, Australian cities once had it relatively easy. (OK, under no circumstance is winning Wimbledon \"easy\" and losing to the world's best player is no cause for shame.) But stubborn resistance to change is a defining characteristic of Australian urban dwellers and is displayed in exaggerated form on the national day when we congratulate ourselves on our enviable lifestyle.\n\nThis was always an inevitable trajectory to congestion and deteriorating functionality. As a biologist I would compare the continuous outward growth of a city to a bacterial colony on an agar plate or a tumour in the body: as the colony sprawls outward, consuming resources and despoiling its environment, the inner core deteriorates. This is the route taken by many older American cities (Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Washington) whose cores were ghetto-ised by policies of sprawl favouring automobile and oil industries.\n\nNewer cities (LA, Phoenix, Atlanta, San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta, Houston) developed a slightly less destructive model of distributed centres linked by freeways, which ultimately become even worse because of the huge distances between the city's constituent parts. Australia's three east coast cities have not even that option because it is too late for orderly planning — our sprawl is already essentially continuous and the lack of planning has left little provision, for public transport or even roads, without massive disruption and expense.\n\nTo continue the biological analogy, a tumour will expand but at some threshold start dying, unless some of the cancer cells gain mutations promoting new blood vessels to bring nutrients and remove toxic waste products. This process, angiogenesis, is essential to the continued growth of the tumour.\n\nLike Hewitt's playing style the solution to the suffocating cancerous growth of our sprawled cities is obvious. They need angiogenesis. In the post-war period city planners — or at least politicians — erroneously believed this could be provided by roads and private transport. In cities such as LA, Houston and Atlanta we can see where that leads. The only examples of very large successful cities reveals that the only angiogenesis that works is networked public transport: in the US only New York City; in Europe (Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Madrid, Barcelona, pre-WWII London) or East Asia (Tokyo, Hong Kong, soon Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul and many others).\n\nIt is no accident that the limits to this model created the housing and car industries crises. Many large American cities have finally adopted a public transport strategy and are painfully, expensively building metro systems. In Australia we continue in our state of denial. Just last week it was reported that NSW was considering another $23 billion freeway expansion scheme yet cancelled metros. It is an inescapable physical law that more roads create more traffic, more congestion and more pollution. And higher oil import bills, which reached $26 billion in 2007-08 at the time of peak oil prices. Add to that congestion costs — possibly $30 billion by the end of this decade. Then there is traffic accidents, where the largest cost is long-term disability.\n\nGiven this phenomenal cost — feasibly $1 trillion over the next 25 years — it is a no-brainer that we should be furiously building city-wide metros. There are viable and affordable plans out there — such as A 30-year public transport plan for Sydney, May 2009 by Dr Garry Glazebrook and as reported in The Herald. Melbourne is better provisioned but little prepared for the future. Brisbane is utterly unprepared with election promises restricted to 500 extra buses in an already congested bus system.\n\nIt is too easy to blame politicians but the political conundrum is well known: metros appear too expensive and a network takes decades beyond a politician's career horizon, while roads can be built relatively quickly, with less public money, tolls provide a constant income stream and Australians love their cars. So we get the politicians we deserve.\n\nTake Bob Carr who did not solve a single structural problem (energy, water, transport, urban planning) in his 10 years in power. On Monday night on the ABC his \"solution\" appears to be to shut the stable doors. I might have once said it was nice that Australia could elect an urbane, bookish intellectual. But no more — we've got to get serious and listen to engineers, builders and planners, people who know and care about the physical world, the nuts and bolts. Having said that, Brisbane has an engineer for mayor and his very expensive plan for endless tunnels and bridges is fast-tracking us to exactly the same destination as Sydney.\n\nWhy this willful denial by Australians? Partly it might be a consequence of our historical \"escape\" from crowded and often terrible urban conditions in Europe. Like Americans, the promise of wide open virgin lands, seemingly allowing endless expansion and a quarter acre for everyone appeared feasible and was built into a persuasive cult. But it was never true, never sustainable. The urge to build new roads and the endless road widening seems to be like Lleyton Hewitt's inability to change: it worked for us then, so it might work for us again.\n\nWe have passed the point when issues of scale were not crippling. There really is no alternative now. Curtailing immigration cannot prevent looming chaos. Instead a greater population can be both a spur (it is coming and we must prepare) and the means to the solution. With a mere 22 million people spread over the sixth largest country in the world we neither have the physical resources nor the human resources (intellectual capital) to cope. She'll be right, mate, is not working.\n\nThe notion that a population of 35 million is unsupportable is silly. Almost all our environmental destructiveness has nothing directly to do with our population since our agriculture is primarily concerned with exports, ditto our mining and tourism. Cities consume less than 10 per cent of water resources. It is slightly uncomfortable to be agreeing with developers such as Harry Triguboff or their spokespersons such as Bernard Salt but they are right, we actually need more people. Quite apart from the fact that most Australians are not interested in the \"depopulate and die of boredom\" scenario, it really is the populate or perish scenario, but unlike our local tennis hero we absolutely must change our ways.\n\nMichael R.
