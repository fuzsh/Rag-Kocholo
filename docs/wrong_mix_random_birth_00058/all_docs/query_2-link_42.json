        "text": "Fuelled by the crowd at the Rod Laver Arena, De Minaur came from behind to claim a two-sets-to-one lead over Rublev, and he looked the fresher of the two players heading into the fourth set – with his opponent appearing to buckle under the pressure.\n\nHowever, the Russian star soon fought back and took control in the final set, storming into a 4-0 lead. Cramp and fatigue then threatened to derail Rublev’s hopes. He stretched his calf between points and pulled up short on the baseline as he looked to navigate his way into the final eight.\n\nThe actions of the 26-year-old offered De Minaur hope, and former world No. 1 Hewitt attempted to grab his attention and offer him some words of wisdom. But his actions were cut short after television cameras cut to him sitting at the opposite end to the Australian star, meaning that he could not coach from the sidelines under the new guidelines. The rules dictate that courtside coaching is only legal from the same end as the player.\n\nHewitt appeared to gesture to De Minaur to try and take control of play and ensure that Rublev was running more, thus capitalising on his calf struggles. His advice fell on deaf ears though, with Rublev winning the fifth set 6-0 to keep his hopes of Australian Open glory alive.\n\nSpeaking about the actions of Hewitt, fellow former Australian star Todd Woodbridge told Nine’s Morning Serve: “He was down the other end at the time and he's wanting to say 'Did you see it, did you see it?' And he couldn't sort of get the message across because he only needed to get the ball going corner to corner and kind of get Rublev moving, but that was what was amazing with Rublev.\n\n“He'd go bang on the serve, crank a winner, or get the point where he could just stand in the centre and that's hard to do and he just kept his composure. Unbelievable when he was this close (gesturing with his fingers) to being not able to finish the match.”\n\nAfter the match, Rublev admitted that he was forced to overcome his late injury problems to get the better of De Minaur, claiming that he had to ‘not think’ about the issue and continue to push himself and secure the win."
