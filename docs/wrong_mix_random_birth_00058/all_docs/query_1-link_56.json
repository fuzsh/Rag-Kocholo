        "text": "news SCTAFEBRUARY 2004 Southern <strong>California</strong> <strong>Tennis</strong> Association <strong>Many</strong> <strong>Played</strong> A <strong>Role</strong> <strong>Many</strong> <strong>Played</strong> A <strong>Role</strong> This is the first Southern <strong>California</strong> <strong>Tennis</strong> Association News of 2004. Since it coincides with Black History Month, there is no better time to look at the game’s sectional development in the African American community. Unfortunately, developing a comprehensive list of the individuals who have made an impact in tennis locally is bound to neglect someone. Those mentioned in this story are significant, not only for their on-court talent, but also for their diverse personalities. Oscar Johnson is a name at the top of the list. He became a newsmaker, winning the Boy’s 18 National Public Parks singles title in 1948.The victory was a benchmark. It is recognized as the first United States Lawn <strong>Tennis</strong> Association national championships win by an African American. Eight years before, on July 29, 1940, Jimmy McDaniel attracted more attention. The American <strong>Tennis</strong> Association (ATA) champion played Don Budge, the “greatest tennis players in the world”, (according to the “Brooklyn Daily Eagle”), at the Cosmopolitan <strong>Tennis</strong> Club in New York City.

They set the standard – one that established the benchmark for the next generation of players. “After I started playing, I found out about Earthna,” said Doug Sykes, the Boy’s 18 National Public Parks winner in 1961. “He, along with Oscar and Jimmy, inspired me.” Sy Allen Browning, Fred Nobles, Hollis Smith and Richard Williams have experienced tennis’ coming of age in the community. (An interesting aside is that Browning, Nobles and Smith were responsible for establishing the first National Junior <strong>Tennis</strong> League chapter in Los Angeles in the late ‘60s.) “There were five or six black clubs in <strong>California</strong>,” said Nobles, whose father Jimmy was one of the Pacific Coast Championships founders. “The idea was (continued on next page) ◗ .......................................................... Dodo’s Day Mark Winters Dodo Cheney Sunday, July 11 (continued on next page) th will be Dodo’s Day in Newport, Rhode Island. On that date, the incomparable Dorothy (Dodo) Bundy Cheney will be inducted into the International <strong>Tennis</strong> Hall of Fame, along with Stefan Edberg and Steffi Graf. Hall of Fame ceremonies are always memorable, but this year’s will set a new standard because the famed location is celebrating its 50th Anniversary. In honor of the occasion, a “Parade of Hall of Famers” involving more than 40 enshrinees, will take place. It is fitting that Cheney will be part of the show.
