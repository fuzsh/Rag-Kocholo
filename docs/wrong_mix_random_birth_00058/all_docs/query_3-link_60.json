        "text": "Certain sports stories get lost in the hype of the Super Bowl and the National Football League.\n\nIn case you missed it, here's what has caught my eye in the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe St. Joseph's Hawks. I heard some Philadelphia sportswriters talking about how the city will never see a championship and everyone should just appreciate the journey. Hogwash I say.\n\nThis team will win a championship. They are experienced behind the leadership of senior Jameer Nelson and juniors Delonte West and Pat Carroll.\n\nThe Hawks almost won a game in the NCAA Tournament with a hobbled West last season. Nelson's the best player in the country and West helps form the best backcourt in the country. They are both shooting over 50 percent from the field and combine for 39 points a game. Yes, they don't have that dominant inside player, but everyone knows guard play wins in March. This team is special. Hop on the bandwagon right now.\n\nThe Flyers keep on winning and the Rangers keep on bringing in stars.\n\nThe Flyers don't have a Jaromir Jagr or Eric Lindros, but they have Ken Hitchcock. And the Flyers are currently second in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\nDespite having a rash of injuries on defense and continuing question marks in goal, the Flyers keep on winning. But will that winning continue in May when stellar goalkeeping is a neccesity?\n\nBut at least they're not the Rangers. Lindros is nearing the end with his latest concussion and in desperate need of defense and goalkeeping, the Rangers went out and got Jagr.\n\nMaybe he'll become the latest star to hang on too long in New York like Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky and Lindros before him.\n\nThe 76ers are worse than last season and the Knicks are exciting again.\n\nHow is it that Philadelphia has an exciting center in Samuel Dalembert and a solid second scoring option in Glenn Robinson, but are losing more than they have in the past five years?\n\nI guess coaching does count for something and without Larry Brown the 76ers are struggling. They don't play with the same heart and desire Brown's teams did and may actually not make the playoffs. The Knicks on the other hand have brought in Stephon Marbury, got rid of some dead weight, and are at the least bringing excitement back to the Garden. With general manager Isiah Thomas calling the shots, expect changes to continue in New York.\n\nThe Australian Open was the most exciting major for men's tennis in recent memory.\n\nAndre Agassi and Andy Roddick both lost in thrilling five-set matches to unseeded Marat Safin. Roger Federer knocked off Lleyton Hewitt in an intense four-setter and eventually took over the No. — ranking.\n\nThe final was disappointing with a weary Safin no match for Federer. But both the Agassi and Roddick matches against Safin will go down as instant classics, and there were numerous exciting battles over the last two weeks. The only problem is ESPN televised the matches the next day. Maybe if the Aussie Open would be closer to April everyone would be a lot more interested.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — ' target='_blank'"
