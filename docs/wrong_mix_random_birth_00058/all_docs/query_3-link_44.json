        "text": "To understand how Alex de Minaur, a baby-faced, slightly-built 19-year-old with a frame that barely touches six feet, has catapulted up the rankings this year, we need only look at who his mentor is.\n\nFor advice on how to punch above your weight there is surely no-one better than fellow Aussie Lleyton Hewitt, the diminutive former world No. 1 whose fist-pumping never-say-die attitude took him to two grand slams.\n\nHewitt - the last Australian man to win a major 16 years ago - is De Minaur's Davis Cup captain and has mentored him for the last couple of years. They even played doubles together at the Estoril Open in May.\n\nDe Minaur has been labelled Hewitt's \"Mini Me\", and has enjoyed a stellar year that has seen him climb from No. 208 in the world to a high of No. 31 last month. The reward for De Minaur's annus mirabilis is a place at this week's Next Gen ATP Finals, which pits the best 21-and-under players from the year against one another in Milan.\n\nDe Minaur's growing legion of fans includes Andy Murray, who tweeted in January: \"I wish I was as grown up as Alex de Minaur on the tennis court, great attitude! Love watching him play.\"\n\n\"A lot of what he does is getting me to believe in myself and that I belong here. Being young that’s important, you need to believe you deserve to be where you are. You have to keep pushing the top guys.\"\n\nTo get the most from the relationship, De Minaur has spent extended periods at Hewitt's home while preparing for the Australian summer swing that kicks off the season.\n\nIt was during this year's Aussie circuit that De Minaur - a former junior Wimbledon finalist - began to catch the wider tennis world's attention, reaching the semi-finals in Brisbane and Sydney in consecutive weeks.\n\nSince then, De Minaur's progress has resembled a stock-market graph during a boom period. Highlights include reaching the third round at Wimbledon and the US Open, and the final of the Citi Open, while former top-10 players Fernando Verdasco, Milos Raonic and Gilles Simon have been among his many giant-killings.\n\nHe plays in a similar way, and it is this, supplemented by his whippet-like speed and phenomenal mental strength that enables De Minaur to overcome his physical disadvantages.\n\nCuriously, De Minaur claims it was only recently that he developed the speed that earned him the \"Demon\" nickname.\n\n\"At 15 I was very clumsy, big feet and my footwork wasn’t great. I was definitely not quick,\" he says. \"Then I don’t know, it just came. I think from not wanting to give up on any shot and trying to get to every single ball possible. Slowly from just touching the ball I got to making the ball and eventually hitting a decent defensive shot. Because I don’t have a lot of weapons I have to use my speed.\"\n\nThere have even been whispers that De Minaur is quicker than Hewitt. \"Ha, that’s a debate we often have,\" De Minaur says. \"If you ask him, he’ll say he’s quicker but I’m confident.\"\n\nThe mental aspect of De Minaur's game meanwhile can be partly attributed to his Spanish roots. The son of a Uruguayan father and a Spanish mother, De Minaur lived in Alicante from the age of five to 13 and has since relocated there after three years in Australia.\n\nDe Minaur, who speaks fluent Spanish and French, is a fiercely proud Aussie but it was in Alicante that he met a psychologist who has profoundly altered his outlook on life and tennis.\n\nShowing maturity well beyond his years, De Minaur realised in his mid-teens that he would need support if he was to cope with tennis's brutal mental demands.\n\n\"You have to deal with a lot of tough situations and working with a psychologist that I see and talk to very often has made a massive difference,\" he says.\n\n\"I call him before every match, and when I’m in Spain I see him face to face. It’s mainly if I’m feeling any emotions that I’m not comfortable with. If I’m nervous or too excited. You have to learn every single day, and try not to make the same mistakes. That’s my mentality.\n\n\"Tennis is a tough sport - a long year, a lot of matches, a lot of travelling. It's not easy so being mentally tough is a big attribute. It doesn’t come easy, you have to work on it.\"\n\nDe Minaur's formidable resolve can be seen in the way he handles pivotal moments. He saved four match points before beating Andrey Rublev to reach the Citi Open final in August, and at the US Open he fended off six match points against former champion Marin Cilic in a five-set defeat.\n\nDe Minaur's willingness to embrace the psychological side of the sport may explain why his attitude is so different from fellow Aussies Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic. If those two seem to be permanently in detention, De Minaur is like the school head boy. Though despite their differences, De Minaur stresses he only has positive things to say about Kyrgios and Tomic.\n\nThe friendships he has cultivated with the numerous Aussies on the tour are important to De Minaur, but his main priority is continuing to improve next year. After Milan, De Minaur's focus will shift to January's Australian Open and his attempt to become the first home male champion since 1976.\n\nNow that really would be insane."
