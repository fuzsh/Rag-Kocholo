        "text": "Day Two at the US Open was a good one for young Americans, led by 17-year-old Vicky Duval, who defeated 2011 US Open champion Samantha Stosur of Australia 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 this evening on Louis Armstrong Stadium.\n\nAfter serving for the first set at 5-4, Duval lost the next three games, and trailing the No. 11 seed 4-2 in the second set, it looked as the 2012 USTA 18s champion would be ousted in the first round by a former US Open champion, just as she was last year by Kim Clijsters. But whether it was last year's experience, the reserve of confidence she had built qualifying last week, where she won all three of her matches in straight sets, or just uninspired play by Stosur, Duval turned the match around, winning the final four games of the second set to force a third. Duval got the break she needed at 4-3, held for 5-3, and had a match point on Stosur's serve before the Australian held, forcing Duval to serve it out. The final game was a long one, with Duval saving break points and Stosur saving match points until on her fourth match point, Duval hit a forehand winner to record the first Top 20 victory of her young career. For more on the match, see usopen.org.\n\nSachia Vickery, with 18s National Championships trophy\n\nEarlier in the day, Duval's friend and long-time Florida junior rival Sachia Vickery, who succeeded Duval as USTA 18s National Champion, earned her first slam victory in her first slam match, beating qualifier Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 6-4, 6-4. Vickery broke Lucic-Baroni serving at 4-5 in the first set, then fell behind a break early in the second, but came back to serve for the match at 5-3. The 18-year-old didn't get to match point in that game, but broke Lucic-Baroni at love to move into the second round against qualifier Julia Glushko of Israel, who beat No. 20 seed Nadia Petrova in the first round. Duval will play Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia in the second round.\n\nWhile girls national champion Vickery was successful in her slam debut, boys national champion Collin Altamirano was not. The 17-year-old lost to No. 22 seed Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 Tuesday, and was no doubt disappointed with his performance. Altamirano, who was playing in his first ATP level match, started the match with a hold of serve, but lost nine straight games, with unforced errors doing most of the damage. Kohlschreiber hit a lot of winners and served well, never facing a break point, leaving Altamirano with little choice but to go for even more.\n\nOther young Americans fared better, with former two-time Kalamazoo champions Jack Sock and Donald Young advancing to the second round, along with Denis Kudla, who beat 2011 ITF World Junior champion Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic in four sets. Sam Querrey(26) and John Isner(13) also advanced to the second round. Other US winners Tuesday were Christina McHale and Alison Riske.\n\nAside from Isner, it wasn't a good day for former college players, as Nicole Gibbs, Steve Johnson, Maria Sanchez and Mallory Burdette all lost first round matches.\n\nFor complete draws and results, see the tournament website.\n\nThe mixed doubles draw has been released, with eight wild card teams, seven of them American pairs. 2011 mixed doubles champions Melanie Oudin and Jack Sock are not playing together this year, with Oudin playing with 2011 NCAA doubles champion Austin Krajicek and Sock partnering Sloane Stephens. I'm a bit surprised not to see Taylor Townsend in the mixed draw, but her commitment to the juniors may have been a factor in that, and she is playing women's doubles with Mallory Burdette. Vicky Duval, who is not playing the junior tournament, is paired with Donald Young in the mixed.\n\nThe Grade 1 in Repentigny Canada this week has not attracted the deepest fields, with the US boys in particular absent from the draw, but the girls field has several top 10 players: Katerina Siniakova(3), Barbora Krejcikova(4) and Elise Mertens(8). Mertens, the No. 3 seed from Belgium, was beaten by unseeded Kaitlyn McCarthy today 6-7(6), 6-3, 6-4. Christina Makarova, the No. 6 seed, is the only other American to reach the third round. Semi-live scoring can be found on the tournament's website.\n\nWith the US Open beginning Monday, several articles on the state of men's tennis in the United States were published today. Doug Robson of USA Today, in a piece headlined \"US Men Not Measuring Up\" discusses the disturbing firsts recently, including no American men in the Wimbledon third round this year, and none in the ATP Top 20 a couple of weeks ago (Isner has since returned to the Top 20).\n\nRobson quotes Tim Mayotte, who briefly worked for USTA Player Development and has been one of its most persistent and visible critics since then.\n\n\"The model is broken,\" says Mayotte, a former top-10 player who worked under McEnroe at the USTA but last year opened his own tennis academy a few miles away from the National Tennis Center in Queens.\n\n\"They are forced to hit overly aggressive forehands from out of position or weak backhands that get killed,\" Mayotte says of a problem affecting most of the top American men since the turn of the century, from Roddick and James Blake to Querrey and Isner to lauded youngsters such as Jack Sock and Ryan Harrison.\n\nFor me, the most intriguing part of this article is this assertion:\n\nMcEnroe hopes young players such as Harrison, 21, and Sock, 20, can develop into elite players and is even more optimistic about a younger group of players who have yet to hit the pros (emphasis mine).\n\nThis could very well be true, and who doesn't want optimism? But unnamed younger players have been pointed to for several years now, and professional breakthroughs have been few there.\n\nThe aging of the ATP Top 100 makes identifying young players less important than ever unless you believe, as I assuredly do not, that a federation can \"develop\" a player.\n\nLindsay Gibbs, a freelance writer who is part of the Changeover website, wrote an article for Sports On Earth with a similar theme. The USTA's Director of Coaching Jose Higueras provided Gibbs with the bulk of her information on the reasons for the decline in men's tennis, and Higueras has been widely cheered on twitter for this quote: \"If it was up to me, there would be no wild cards. Wild cards create entitlement for the kids. I think you should be in the draw if you actually are good enough to get in the draw.\"\n\nI'm sure Higueras knows as well as anyone the importance of wild cards, and without one, Goran Ivanisevic would never have won Wimbledon, Kim Clijsters wouldn't have been able to say goodbye at the US Open last year, etc. etc. But if Higueras wants to eliminate or reduce the wild cards in the hands of the USTA, especially those often given to younger players, he is in a position to raise the issue, and should, given his opinions stated in this article.\n\nAs far as the USTA Player Development budget, I don't know what Higueras is referring to when he says the USTA pays for junior competition. Everyone who has paid a USTA entry fee knows that money is expected to cover the cost of the tournament, including courts, officials and administration, with the balls the only direct contribution from the USTA itself. The USTA does pay for several of the large ITF junior events in this country, but not the USTA sanctioned junior tournaments.\n\nGibbs also added on twitter that Higueras brought up his support of the collegiate tennis system in the US in her interview with him, which did not make the final cut in her article. The timing of that assertion isn't the best, given that the USTA failed to give a US Open women's doubles wild card to NCAA champions Sabrina Santamaria and Kaitlyn Christian of USC, but I hope Higueras continues to reach out to college coaches, who are an under-utilized asset and deserve more credit and recognition for their work.\n\nIt's being reported that Santamaria and Christian have been promised a wild card for the 2014 US Open, regardless of their performance in college events this season, but they won't know about the mixed doubles wild card possibilities for this year until Monday.\n\nThe US Open doubles draws have been released, with girls 18s champions Allie Kiick and Sachia Vickery playing Sharon Fichman and Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada. Boys 18s champions Paul Oosterbaan and Ronnie Schneider will play Brian Baker and Rajeev Ram, and with Ram and Schneider both coached by Bryan Smith, it will be an interesting coaching/preparation dynamic. NCAA men's doubles champions Jarmere Jenkins and Mac Styslinger of Virginia have drawn No. 14 seeds Michael Llodra and Nicolas Mahut of France.\n\nThere are 14 Americans on Monday's schedule, all in singles, including Madison Keys, Sloane Stephens, Bradley Klahn, Shelby Rogers and Rhyne Williams. Ryan Harrison has drawn No. 2 seed Rafael Nadal, and is third on Ashe Monday afternoon.\n\nThose of you I've spoken to in person the past year or so know my father has been seriously ill with cancer during that time. Those of you who come to this website daily know it is unusual for me to go one day without posting, let alone two or three. The connection may not be obvious, but my father died on Saturday, leaving my focus on funeral arrangements, family memories, many tears and much laughter as we celebrate the kind and generous man he was. My mother, the love of his life for more than 62 years, will need all the support her family and friends can provide as she copes with his loss. His obituary is available here.\n\nAs painful as these last few months have been, my father's death is not a tragedy, with 84 of his years healthy, happy and productive. Not everyone is so blessed, and I'm sad to report that two young tennis players have died in the past week: Paul Nahon and Conor Pollock. Nahon, who had just transferred from Richmond to Colorado College, died on August 15, while hiking in the Rocky Mountains. His obituary is here. I don't have any official confirmation about Pollock's death, which I'm told happened Sunday night. Please follow the texascollegetennis blog for more details.\n\n©Colette Lewis 2013--\n\nKalamazoo, MI--\n\nTop-seeded Gage Brymer has reverted to his Easter Bowl form, winning his quarterfinal and semifinal matches at the USTA Boys 18 and 16 National Championships from a set down. On an ideal day of tennis weather at Kalamazoo College's Stowe Stadium, Brymer overcame No. 5 seed Ernesto Escobedo 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\nIn claiming the Easter Bowl ITF title in April, Brymer won four of his matches, including the final, from a set down. Until yesterday's 1-6, 6-4, 7-6(5) win over fellow UCLA Bruin freshman Mackenzie McDonald, Brymer had won his early rounds in straight sets, but he credited the level his competition for his perilous situation the past two days.\n\n\"Maybe I came out a little slow, but I thought Mackie came out really aggressive yesterday, and today Ernesto did the same thing,\" said Brymer, 18. \"It was really tough to break either of them. With Ernesto, in the first two sets, he's got a good serve and played aggressive, so it was really tough.\"\n\nAfter the 10-minute break between the second and third sets, Brymer didn't change his strategy, only his energy level, but that was enough to build a 4-0 lead.\n\n\"In the first two sets, I was playing all right, but I just didn't have as much energy as I needed to,\" Brymer said. \"In the first couple of games of the third set, that was my main focus, come out with a lot of energy, keep balls in play, look for my opportunities and take them when they were there.\"\n\nEscobedo's serve wasn't giving him as many forehand putaways as usual in the third set, but he was able to hold serve twice before Brymer served for the match. After his backhand winner made it 40-15, Brymer said \"one more\", and his big forehand forced an error from Escobedo, putting Brymer in the semifinals.\n\nBrymer said his training has given him the stamina to recover quickly from difficult matches, like the one he had against McDonald.\n\n\"I'm used to training really hard,\" said Brymer. \"I take pride in my work ethic and I feel like over the summer, leading up to this tournament, I've really prepared myself by doing the extra work and the extra hours. That's really helped me so that the longer matches don't affect me as much as the other players.\"\n\nBrymer's semifinal opponent is unseeded Collin Altamirano, who also credits his fitness regimen as a key in his success this week.\n\n\"I'm wearing guys down over time,\" said Altamirano, who defeated unseeded Trevor Johnson 7-5, 6-0. \"I work out probably about three hours a day on top of hitting. I do it all, anywhere from swimming, to running, to weights, everything.\"\n\nAltamirano, who, like Brymer, has come back from a set down twice in the tournament, wasn't surprised by the second set score in his match with Johnson.\n\n\"The first set was tight, he served very well, he was hitting good shots, but I just kept wearing him down,\" said Altamirano, 17. \"The next thing you know, he kept making more errors and more errors, and in the second, I snuck a break in there early and he was just done after that.\"\n\nBecause Altamirano played only Futures events except for the Spring Nationals at Mobile this year, he wasn't expecting to be seeded, but he didn't feel that was an impediment to his chances to win the tournament.\n\n\"I don't play as much as the other kids when it comes to juniors,\" said Altamirano, who lives and trains in Sacramento, California. \"I was expecting not to be seeded. But it's good. I'm doing what I came here for.\"\n\nAnother player who competes very little on the junior circuit is No. 14 seed Jared Donaldson, who reached the semifinals with a 7-6(5), 6-3 victory over No. 6 Luca Corinteli. But Donaldson wasn't sure, back in February, if he was interesting in playing any tennis at all, quitting the game for three months this spring.\n\n\"I think it was a combination of a lot of things,\" said Donaldson, 16, who left Argentina, where he'd been training for three years, in February, returning to his home in Rhode Island.\n\n\"I was a little burnt out culturally, not speaking the language that well, and I think I was burned out mentally,\" said Donaldson, who received a wild card into the tournament. \"If you asked me in March if I was going to be in the semifinals of this tournament, or even playing this tournament, I would be very skeptical. I just feel lucky to be here.\"\n\nDonaldson sought help from a sports psychologist, and decided that the daily achievement that tennis represented for him was something he wanted back in his life.\n\n\"When I started playing tournaments again in June, some Futures, and I had good results there, good matches, got some points, and played the qualifying of (an ATP) 250, so I'd won matches and was feeling confident coming in here, but I still hadn't had that one breakthrough in the Futures or even in the juniors really. But I knew I was playing well and felt confident about my game, felt confident it was coming, it was coming.\"\n\nDonaldson hadn't exactly rolled through the draw, needing a third set tiebreaker to beat AJ Catanzariti in the second round, and trailing No. 4 seed Connor Farren 7-5, 5-2 in yesterday's round of 16 match. But he played well from then throughout the rest of the match, so falling behind Corinteli, who had two set points in the first set with Donaldson serving at 5-6, didn't faze him.\n\n\"The tiebreaker was really close, 4-3, 4-4, 5-4, 5-5, 6-5 me,\" said Donaldson. \"And I just got that one second serve at 5-6, and I hit a good return at his feet, because he came in behind it, and I won the point and the first set. That kind of relaxed me, because I didn't feel I was playing that well up until that point, but I felt more confident in the second set.\"\n\nDonaldson will play No. 2 seed Noah Rubin, who ended the run of unseeded Logan Staggs 6-2, 6-0. Donaldson and Rubin have never met, but it's a match Donaldson has always wanted to play.\n\n\"Ever since we were 11, I knew the name Noah Rubin,\" said Donaldson. \"He was always better than me, so it's going to be fun to play a guy my year, to test myself against probably the best kid in United States tennis right now.\"\n\nThe top four seeds have advanced to the semifinals of the 16s, with only one of the quarterfinal matches extending to three sets.\n\nIn that match, No. 3 seed Tommy Paul served for the match at 5-4 in the second set, but lost the subsequent tiebreaker before posting a 6-4, 6-7(3), 6-2 victory over No. 9 seed Reilly Opelka.\n\nPaul will play No. 2 seed Francis Tiafoe, who once again failed to serve out the match when he had the chance, but came back for a straight set victory over No. 24 seed Zeke Clark 6-3, 7-6(4).\n\n\"It's a little losing focus, it's not nerves,\" said Tiafoe, who served for the match at 5-4 against the speedy Clark. \"I think I have it and I'm relaxed, but I've got to play a little tighter. It's the biggest tournament in the US and everybody's going to be playing unbelievable on those points especially, so I've got to tighten up.\"\n\nTiafoe respects the results Paul has gotten in the past few months, although Tiafoe did beat Paul 6-3, 6-3 in the Carson ITF Grade 1 in April.\n\n\"He's definitely got a lot of confidence behind him,\" said Tiafoe. \"He's just won Clays and ITFs in the spring, so it should be an exciting match tomorrow.\"\n\nTop seed Sameer Kumar will face No. 4 seed Jake DeVine, after Kumar defeated No. 14 seed Jordi Arconada 6-0, 6-3.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be a tough match and it was a tough match,\" said Kumar, 16. \"The score doesn't completely look like that but it was tough, so I'm glad to get through this.\"\n\nKumar admitted that the US Open junior wild card was a major factor in his decision to play the 16s division this week.\n\n\"Since I don't play very many ITFs, this is probably the only way to get to the US Open,\" said the Carmel, Indiana resident. \"Obviously, I really, really want that. That would be a very cool experience, so I really hope I can win two more matches.\"\n\nDeVine earned his way into the semifinals with a 6-4, 6-3 win over No. 7 seed Kalman Boyd.\n\nDeVine took the first set with a break at 4-5, then took a 3-0 lead, only to see Boyd come back to make it 3-3.\n\n\"In the second set, I started strong, but I kind of lost my rhythm a little bit,\" said the 16-year-old, who trains with the USTA. \"He got it back to 3-all and I held serve at 4-3. I played a fantastic last two games to finish the match, which I was really happy with.\"\n\nDeVine, who won the ITF 16s title in Carson this year, lost to eventual champion Kumar in the quarterfinals of the Easter Bowl 7-5, 6-4, is determined to leave the tournament without experiencing two losses.\n\n\"I was in the semis at Clay Courts, and I lost two matches, to Reilly Opelka and Alex Rybakov, and it's a bitter feeling to leave the tournament with two losses after having such a good run, so this tournament I'm definitely looking to go all the way.\"\n\nThe 16s singles semifinals begin at 9:30 a.m., followed by the 18s semifinals.\n\nThe doubles finals are set for Saturday afternoon, starting with the 16s division. Top seeds Tommy Paul and Alex Rybakov will meet No. 11 seeds Taylor Fritz and Anudeep Kodali for the 16s gold ball. Paul and Rybakov defeated No. 7 seeds Alexander Knight and Kyle Seelig 6-2, 6-3, while Fritz and Kodali downed unseeded Henry Gordon and Reese Stalder 6-3, 6-2.\n\nThe 18s doubles semifinals were much closer, with both going three sets.\n\nNo. 3 seeds Paul Oosterbaan and Ronnie Schneider took advantage of significant crowd support to come back against 2012 16s champions Henrik Wiersholm and Danield Kerznerman, seeded eighth, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2. They will play No. 4 seeds Henry Craig and George Goldhoff, who also turned their match around, defeating unseeded William Griffith and JT Nishimura 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. A main draw wild card into the US Open men's doubles draw is on the line in Saturday's final.\n\nFor complete results, see the tournament website."
