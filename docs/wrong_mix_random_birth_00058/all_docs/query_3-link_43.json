        "text": "Retiring Aussie legend Lleyton Hewitt was stunned by an incredible act of sportsmanship from his opponent which won him a point.\n\nAfter winning the first set, Hewitt was 4-5 down in the second and trailing 0-30 to American rival Jack Sock.\n\nBut when Hewitt's first service was called out by the linesman, Sock offered a wry smile towards the 34-year-old.\n\nNebraska-born Sock then signalled to the chair umpire and aimed a comment at Hewitt, saying: \"That was in if you want to challenge it.\"\n\nInitially confused, Hewitt did not appear to know what to do.\n\nBut he eventually succumbed to the pressure of the kind gesture and asked for a review.\n\nAfter the nervous wait, the Hawkeye replay showed that the ball did in fact land comfortably on the line and the point was awarded to Hewitt.\n\nNot only did he then go on to win the game, Hewitt went on to claim the set to win the match 7-4 6-4."
