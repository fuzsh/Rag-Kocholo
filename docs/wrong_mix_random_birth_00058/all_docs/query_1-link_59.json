        "text": "A Catawba College football player and a former team member were fatally shot at an off-campus apartment Thursday, two months after another Catawba football player was slain in a shootout with students from a neighboring school.\n\nSalisbury police said Matthew Greear, 19, died at the scene of the overnight shooting. Walter Franklin Long V, 19, died several hours later at Rowan Regional Medical Center.Two other Catawba students were in the apartment during the shooting reported just after midnight and dove out a window in a unit at the Lakewood Apartments to escape, according to police. Authorities were looking for two more men described as the assailants.\n\nGreear was a football player, and Long had left the team because of a back injury.\n\nBARAKA DISMISSED: Kelly Baraka, who sat out his freshman season with Michigan after being arrested for marijuana possession, was dismissed from the football team for undisclosed reasons.\n\n\\ COLLEGE BASKETBALL\\ DREW RETIRES: Homer Drew retired after 14 seasons as Valparaiso's basketball coach, with son Scott taking over the Crusaders.\n\nDrew, who will remain at the school as a special assistant to the president for university advancement, was 236-185 at Valparaiso and won seven Mid-Continent Conference championships. His teams made six NCAA tournament appearances, including a run to the round of 16 in 1998.\n\nThe 1998 team's two tournament victories gained national attention with son Bryce's buzzer-beating 3-pointer giving Valparaiso a 70-69 win over Mississippi.\n\nMERFELD LEAVING HAMPTON?
