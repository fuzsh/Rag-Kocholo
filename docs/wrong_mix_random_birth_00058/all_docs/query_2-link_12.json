        "text": "He added: “We had to fill out a lot of forms before we got off the plane purely because we had come from New York, whether we saw anything at the airports, how things could have played out potentially that we witnessed.\n\n“It's a surreal moment. We were just in New York and to think that the whole city had changed while we were on that flight and when we landed in Australia on the other side of the world it was completely different.”\n\nThe two-time grand slam champion struggled to comprehend how the greatest achievement in his career at that point coincided with a horrific moment in time that changed the world forever.\n\n“It was just more disbelief for me, to think I was out two nights before partying on cloud nine after winning my biggest title,\" he continued.\n\n“It was a weird situation for me to be in - to think one minute you couldn't be happier and then to just know that the whole world had changed.”\n\nNearly 3,000 people were killed in the terror attacks on September 11 2001, which saw two planes crash into the World Trade Centre, before both towers collapsed.\n\nAnother aircraft crashed into the Pentagon and a separate plane was heading for the White House, but due to the bravery of the passengers on board, they were able to bring the plane down in a field before it reached the US capital.\n\nNumerous memorials have been constructed, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial at the Pennsylvania crash site."
