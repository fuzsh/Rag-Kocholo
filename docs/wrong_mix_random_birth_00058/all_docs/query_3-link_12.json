        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt never won the Australian Open. Wimbledon, yes. The U.S. Open, yes. But not his home tournament.\n\nBut in a 20-year career that ended Thursday with a loss to No. 8 seed David Ferrer, you would have been forgiven for thinking that he owned the Open down under.\n\nHe’d said for a long time that this tournament would be the last of his career. So organizers of the tourney were ready when the inevitable came. The mood was celebratory, including an impromptu speech from Ferrer – he said he had one autographed shirt and it was from Hewitt – and videotape salutes from fellow pros Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Andy Murray and fellow Aussie Nick Krygios.\n\nAnd the one-time firebrand, mellowed by time, addressed his countrymen, then walked off the court and into the clubhouse with his three kids where they walk past a sign over a sketch of Hewitt that said simply “Thanks, Mate.”"
