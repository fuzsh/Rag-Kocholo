        "text": "And for the man who holds the fastest serve in world tennis, tonight’s exhibition clash against Lleyton Hewitt at the Domain Tennis Centre is an important step in that direction.\n\nThe 2015 John Newcombe medallist was a late replacement for young gun Thanasi Kokkinakis, who was forced to withdraw because of a shoulder injury.\n\nGroth, who reached a career-high ranking of 53 in late September, has not played since retiring against Jeremy Chardy in the first round at the Japan Open in October.\n\nHe underwent surgery to repair a nerve problem in his right foot, shutting down the rest of his season.\n\nHowever, he is now fit and ready to back-up the best year of his career – and won’t be holding back against good friend and former world No.1 Hewitt.\n\n“I knew the situation he [Kokkinakis] was in and when I got the call I jumped at the opportunity,” Groth told the Mercury.\n\n“This is a good opportunity for me to get a match leading into the summer with a little bit more pressure.\n\n“Especially to play a guy like Lleyton, who is going to make a lot of balls and certainly he always gives it everything he has got.\n\n“I will be taking it fairly seriously but I think it is a good one because you can play a match in a serious environment with the crowd but with a little bit less pressure because there is no result riding on it.\n\n“You can work on the things you have been prac­tising and maybe enjoy it a ­little bit more.\n\n“Lleyton is a competitive player though and he is always out to win, no matter what.”\n\nGroth, 28, who sent down a 263km/h rocket at an ATP Challenger event in Busan, South Korea, in March 2012 – the fastest serve on record – does not consider his season as a breakthrough campaign.\n\nInstead he views his most consistent year on the circuit as finally establishing himself, with plenty more left in the tank.\n\n“I was one win away from being top 50, which was my goal for 2015 and I got to 53, and having to stop with injury was a bit disappointing.\n\n“But I feel I have really set myself up well for 2016 where I can make a really good run at top 50 and hopefully top 30.\n\n“I wouldn’t call it my ­break-through but a year I really ­established myself more than anything at that top level.\n\n“Twice I went third round at Grand Slams, three quarter-­finals at Tour level and really started to beat guys in the top 30.\n\n“The Davis Cup was ­massive, what happened in Darwin [beating Kazakhstan] and being part of the team that made the semi-final was fantastic.”"
