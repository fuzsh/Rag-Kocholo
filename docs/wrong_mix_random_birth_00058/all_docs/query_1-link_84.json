        "text": "My Tennis Recruiting Network preview of the Wimbledon junior championships was published this morning, prior to the completion of qualifying play and the Roehampton Grade 1 finals. Only one American, Dasha Ivanova, made it through to the main draw. Ivanova defeated No. 7 seed Marika Akkerman of Canada 6-1, 7-5. No. 4 seed Katrine Steffensen lost to No. 14 seed Deborah Chiesa of Italy 6-3, 7-6(3). No. 3 seed Martin Redlicki lost a tough one to No. 13 seed Wishaya Trongcharoenchaikkul of Thailand in today's final round of qualifying 3-6, 6-1, 10-8.\n\nThe qualifiers have not been placed, possibly because all matches weren't completed today, but the qualifiers always get the weekend off at Wimbledon, so the incomplete draw doesn't impact Saturday's 31 matches.\n\nFive US players are on the schedule Saturday, with Noah Rubin playing Luke Bambridge of Great Britain, No. 15 seed Louisa Chirico playing Helen Ploskina of Ukraine, Luca Corinteli playing No. 10 seed Johan Tatlot of France, and on a court to be determined, Spencer Papa playing Hyeon Chung of Korea. No. 5 seed Taylor Townsend, Stefan Kozlov, Johnnise Renaud and Ivanova will play their first round matches Monday, with Sunday the traditional day off at Wimbledon.\n\nThe ITF preview of Wimbledon juniors is available here.\n\nBelinda Bencic of Switzerland and Nick Kyrgios of Australia, the No. 1 seeds at Roehampton and at Wimbledon, collected the Roehampton titles today. Bencic, whose junior winning streak is now at 28, beat unseeded Iryna Shymanovich of Belarus 6-4, 6-0, while Kyrgios defeated No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany 6-3, 6-1.\n\nTop seeds Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic and Carol Zhao of Canada won the girls doubles at Roehampton, beating Bencic and Petra Uberalova of Slovakia, the No. 2 seeds, 1-6, 6-4, 13-11. The boys doubles title was also decided in a match tiebreaker, with No. 4 seeds Nicolas Jarry of Chile and Frederico Silva of Portugal defeating No. 3 seeds Pedro Cachin of Argentina and Guillermo Nunez of Chile 7-6(3), 6-7(1), 10-5.\n\nRain disrupted third round play today, but wild card Alison Riske of the US came through with a big win over Urszula Radwanska of Poland 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Riske will play again on Saturday, since her match today was held over from Thursday. Sloane Stephens will play a third set with Petra Cetkovska of the Czech Republic on Saturday to determine whether she will advance to the second week of her third consecutive slam. For more on Riske's win, see this article from Ben Rothenberg of the New York Times.\n\nThe USTA Collegiate camp in Carson was completed Wednesday, with Arizona State's Jacqueline Cako winning the competition held for the last spot on the six-player team. Cako defeated Mary Weatherholt of Nebraska 1-6, 7-6(4), 6-4 in the final. Cako joins Stanford's Nicole Gibbs and Krista Hardebeck, UCLA's Robin Anderson, Virginia's Julia Elbaba and Florida's Lauren Embree on the team. The $50,000 Challenger in Sacramento is next on the schedule for the team.\n\nThe Wimbledon Junior championships begin Saturday, and unlike the other junior slams, who wait until the qualifying is complete, the draws are already out, without the qualifiers placed. As expected, Switzerland's Belinda Bencic, the ITF's top-ranked girl, and Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis, the boys finalist at this year's Australian Open, received wild cards, with the full list below.\n\nGIRLS:\n\nBelinda Bencic (SUI)\n\nKarin Kennel (SUI)\n\nIsabelle Wallace (GBR)\n\nLana Rush (GBR)\n\nAnna Brogan (GBR)\n\nGabriella Taylor (GBR)\n\nFreya Christie (GBR)\n\nMaia Lumsden (GBR)\n\nBOYS:\n\nAlexander Sendegeya (GBR)\n\nEvan Hoyt (GBR)\n\nThanasi Kokkinakis (AUS)\n\nThomas Colautti (GBR)\n\nSamm Butler (GBR)\n\nPeter Ashley (GBR)\n\nBilly Harris (GBR)\n\nJoshua Sapwell (GBR)\n\nThe seeds:\n\nGIRLS:\n\n1. Belinda Bencic (SUI)\n\n2. Ana Konjuh (CRO)\n\n3. Katerina Sinakova (CZE)\n\n4. Barbora Krejcikova (CZE)\n\n5. Taylor Townsend (USA)\n\n6. Elise Mertens (BEL)\n\n7. Katy Dunne (GBR)\n\n8. Ching-Wen Hsu (TPE)\n\n9. Carol Zhao (CAN)\n\n10. Camila Giangreco Campiz (PAR)\n\n11. Karin Kennel (SUI)\n\n12. Anhelina Kalinina (UKR)\n\n13. Anett Kontaveit (EST)\n\n14. Nina Stojanovic (SRB)\n\n15. Louisa Chirico (USA)\n\n16. Ipek Soylu (TUR)\n\nBOYS:\n\n1. Nick Kyrgios (AUS)\n\n2. Nikola Miljevic (SRB)\n\n3. Alexander Zverev (GER)\n\n4. Laslo Djere (SRB)\n\n5. Kyle Edmund (GBR)\n\n6. Gianluigi Quinzi (ITA)\n\n7. Christian Garin (CHI)\n\n8. Borna Coric (CRO)\n\n9. Fillipo Baldi (ITA)\n\n10. Johan Tatlot (FRA)\n\n11. Pedro Cachin (ARG)\n\n12. Maxime Hamou (FRA)\n\n13. Clement Geens (BEL)\n\n14. Guillermo Nunez (CHI)\n\n15. Frederico Silva (POR)\n\n16. Wayne Montgomery (RSA)\n\nNone of the four American boys in the main draw are seeded, and only one drew a seed for their first round opponent. Luca Corinteli plays No. 10 seed Johan Tatlot of France, Spencer Papa plays Hyeon Chung of Korea, Noah Rubin drew Great Britain's Luke Bambridge and Stefan Kozlov faces wild card Joshua Sapwell, also of Great Britain.\n\nTaylor Townsend, the No. 5 seed, has drawn Iryna Shymanovich of Belarus, who is in the final at Roehampton, so obviously playing well right now. No. 15 seed Louisa Chirico plays Helen Ploskina of Ukraine, who is ranked just a few spots behind her. Jamie Loeb has drawn Viktoriya Lushkova, also of Ukraine, and Johnnise Renaud will play Anastasia Komardina of Russia in an all-lefty battle.\n\nDue to the late afternoon rain, not all the boys qualifying matches were completed, but Martin Redlicki did advance to the second and final round. In the girls qualifying, Katrine Steffensen and Dasha Ivanova won their opening matches; Tornado Alicia Black and Mira Ruder-Hook lost in their first round qualifying matches.\n\nAll the Americans are out at the Roehampton Grade 1, with No. 3 seed Townsend losing to Bencic 7-5, 6-2 in the singles semifinals. She is no doubt happy to be in the opposite half of the Wimbledon draw from Bencic, who has beaten her twice this month. Loeb and Black lost in the doubles semifinals to No. 2 seeds Bencic and Petra Uberalova 6-1, 6-3. No. 6 seeds Rubin and his partner Clement Geens of Belgium lost to No. 4 seeds Nicolas Jarry of Chile and Frederico Silva of Portugal 6-3, 5-7, 10-8 in the boys semifinals.\n\nFor the draws and orders of play for both Roehampton and the Wimbledon qualifying, see the LTA home page.\n\nThe US men had a historically bad performance at Wimbledon this year, with none of them making the third round for the first time since 1912, when no one played the tournament. Denis Kudla, James Blake and Bobby Reynolds all went out in straight sets, Reynolds closing out the rainy evening under the Centre Court roof against top seed Novak Djokovic. It was up to the US women to provide victories, with top seed Serena Williams and 18-year-old Madison Keys providing victories. Keys was again impressive, beating No. 30 seed Mona Barthel of Germany 6-4, 6-2 with no drama and no fuss. For more on the Americans in action Thursday, see this article from Greg Garber of espn.com.\n\nThere was big news on the college front today was Duke's announcement that Chalena Scholl would be joining them for the upcoming school year. Scholl is currently the top-ranked blue chip in the Tennis Recruiting Network's class of 2013. Scholl, who has not played any junior tournaments this year, reached the final of a $25,000 Pro Circuit tournament last month in Raleigh, NC. She is a French Open and Orange Bowl quarterfinalist who has been as high as No. 8 in the ITF junior world rankings. For comments from Duke head coach Jamie Ashworth and Scholl, see this article from the Duke athletic website.\n\nEighteen-year-old Madison Keys won the first main draw match of her Wimbledon career today, defeating Great Britain's Heather Watson 6-3, 7-5. Despite the unfamiliar surroundings (Keys had only played the juniors at Wimbledon once, back in 2011, where she lost to eventual champion Ashleigh Barty in the third round) and the partisan crowd, Keys kept her composure, using her big serve and aggressive ground strokes to keep Watson on the defensive. Keys did get some luck at the end, with two net cord winners going her way when she was serving for the match, but Watson said, since she was up a break in the second, it should have never come to that.\n\nCourtney Nguyen of SI.com wrote this article about Keys' win, which includes some interesting comments from Keys on her junior career, taken from an earlier interview.\n\n\"When I was growing up in juniors, I was terrible,” she said last month. “I always lost. I rarely ever won any junior tournaments. … I think I just had a game where you kind of have to put it together. So it took me a lot longer to understand how to do everything and I’m still trying to figure it out. So when I was younger, I would try to hit a winner from 15 feet behind the baseline. That doesn’t work. So I wasn’t a very good junior.”\n\nI've been following Keys since she was 12, so I think I am in a position to disagree with that harse self-assessment, although I will say Keys was injured a lot during her mid-teens. She won the Eddie Herr and Junior Orange Bowl championships in the 12s. It's true she never won a Grade A on the ITF Junior circuit, but she won the Tulsa B1, made the ITF Junior Top 20 and quit playing juniors at the age of 16 to concentrate on pro tennis, where she had already made her mark by winning a WTA match at age 14. There have been more distinguished junior careers, but don't let her kid you. She was a very good junior.\n\nTwenty-year-old Denis Kudla, who won his first match in the main draw of a slam today, was also a very good junior who turned pro at a young age. Kudla won the 16s Orange Bowl and was a finalist at the US Open juniors in 2010, and with his 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 4-6, 6-1 win today over fellow qualifier James Duckworth of Australia, he has cracked the ATP Top 100 for the first time. Letting a two-set lead slip away must have annoyed him, but he bounced back to dominate the final set.\n\nTennis.com spoke with Kudla prior to his match today (thanks to Russ for this link) for this article, and the Washington Post's Liz Clarke provided this rundown of his background and career after his win today.\n\nThere weren't many other US winners today at Wimbledon, with only Serena Williams (of course), wild card Alison Riske, James Blake and Bobby Reynolds advancing to the second round. Qualifier Reynolds beat wild card Steve Johnson 1-6, 7-6(4), 6-3, 6-7(4), 6-4 in a match that took three hours and twenty minutes to complete. Johnson has now lost a five-set first round match in his last three slam appearances. Other US players losing today: Sam Querrey(21), Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Ryan Harrison, Mallory Burdette, Michael Russell and qualifiers Alex Kuznetsov and Wayne Odesnik.\n\nJohn Isner, Rajeev Ram, Christina McHale and Sloane Stephens are on Wednesday's schedule. See the Wimbledon website for the schedule and draws.\n\nThe search for a new chief executive of the ATP has stalled, with the two internal candidates not getting enough support, and Doug Robson of USA Today is reporting the players are hoping that Australian Open director Craig Tiley might be considered for the position vacated by the recent death of Brad Drewett. Tiley, the former men's coach at the University of Illinois, was back in Urbana last month for the 10th reunion of the NCAA championship team he coached, and in this article from the local News-Gazette, Tiley didn't sound as if he had ruled out leaving his job in Australia.\n\nFor now, Tiley will resume his duties in Australia, though a return to the States isn’t out of the question. His wife, Ali, is a UI graduate who grew up in Naperville.\n\n“We’ll always look at the options,” he said. “I love the job down there, you never know. I’ve lived in South Africa, America and Australia. I’ve been fortunate to be able to do that.\n\nThe ATP is based in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.\n\nThe last US boys in the singles at ITF Grade 1 in Roehampton lost today, with Noah Rubin bowing out 6-3, 6-1 to unseeded Enzo Couacaud of France. Taylor Townsend, seeded No. 3, reached the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over wild card Lana Rush of Great Britain and will play unseeded Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia Wednesday.\n\nRubin is still alive in doubles, reaching the quarterfinals with Belgian Clement Geens. The No. 6 seeds will play American Luca Corinteli and his partner Adrian Ortiz of Mexico. Johnnise Renaud is in the girls doubles quarterfinals with Victoria Rodriguez of Mexico and Jamie Loeb and Tornado Alicia Black also have reached the final eight.\n\nDraws and Wednesday's order of play are available at the LTA home page.\n\nWith Nadal's shocking first round Wimbledon loss to Belgian Steve Darcis, in straight sets no less, the headlines will understandably focus on that, but Monica Puig also deserves some recognition for her 6-3, 6-2 victory over No. 5 seed Sara Errani of Italy.\n\nPuig, who will be 20 in September, has never played particularly well on grass, and lost in the second round of qualifying at the WTA Eastbourne tournament last week, but Errani is much more comfortable on clay, and Puig used that to her advantage. Although Puig needed seven match points to close out her best career win (she beat No. 11 seed Nadia Petrova of Russia in the first round at Roland Garros), she got the win, and she spoke at length about what she's learned this year about closing out matches. For more on Puig's win, see this Associated Press article.\n\nJohn Isner was one of only two American men scheduled for singles today, and the No. 18 seed, who is known for taking nearly every slam match into a fifth set, kept his opening match short. Isner did play a couple of his customary tiebreakers, but avenged his early loss to Russian Evgeny Donskoy n the Netherlands last week, posting a 6-0, 7-6(5), 7-6(3) victory. Rajeev Ram, the other US man on Monday's schedule, defeated Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 7-5, 6-4, 6-7(2), 6-2 to reach the second round at Wimbledon for the first time in his career.\n\nThe remaining nine American men, all in the top half of the draw, play their first round matches on Tuesday.\n\nThe US women had a disappointing first day, with the only two advancing those who played other Americans. Sloane Stephens, the No. 17 seed, defeated Eastbourne finalist Jamie Hampton 6-3, 6-3 and Christina McHale beat Alexa Glatch 6-4, 6-4. No. 26 seed Vavara Lepchenko lost, as did Lauren Davis, CoCo Vandeweghe, Vania King, and Melanie Oudin. Five additional American women, in the top half of the draw, play their first round matches Tuesday.\n\nDraws and schedule can be found at the Wimbledon website.\n\nThe grass courts at Roehampton have not been kind to American juniors this week, with only No. 3 seed Taylor Townsend and Noah Rubin reaching the third round at the ITF Grade 1 warmup to Wimbledon. Johnnise Renaud, Dasha Ivanova, Katrine Steffensen and Jamie Loeb lost in today's second round; Tornado Alicia Black and Louisa Chirico, the No. 9 seed, lost in Sunday's first round. Rubin is the only American boy to get out of the first round, with the other four--Martin Redlicki, Spencer Papa, Stefan Kozlov and Luca Corinteli--losing on Sunday.\n\nTownsend will play British wild card Lana Rush in the third round; Rubin plays unseeded Enzo Couacaud of France. Top seeds Belinda Bencic of Switzerland and Nick Kyrgios of Australia are also through to the third round.\n\nThe draws and order of play can be found at the LTA website.\n\nTwo more sectional qualifying tournaments for the US Open National Playoffs were completed over the weekend, in the Northern California and Northern sections.\n\nUniversity of Southern California sophomore Giuliana Olmos won the women's tournament in Salinas, California, defeating former Stanford player Lejla Hodzic 6-1, 6-4 in the final. Harvard recruit Andrew Ball won the men's tournament, downing fellow teenager Josh Pompan 6-3, 6-1 in the final. Eric Roberson and Yasmin Schnack won the mixed doubles tournament.\n\nIn the Northern section, Tony Larson, a former St. Cloud State player, won the men's tournament, beating Brian Battistone 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the final. Nicole Melichar won the women's tournament, defeating 15-year-old Jessie Aney 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. Battistone and Melichar, who won the mixed doubles main draw wild card last year at the National playoff tournament in New Haven, will have a chance to defend that title, winning the Northern tournament this year over Larson and 14-year-old Alexis Nelson 7-5, 6-4.\n\nFor links to the draws of all the US Open Playoff sectional qualifying results, click here. There are only four more sections yet to be decided.\n\nMy weekly article for the Tennis Recruiting Network delves into the 172-match home winning streak the Ohio State men's tennis team has established, one that extends all the way back to April of 2003. I did the interviews when I was at the NCAAs last month, then worked on the research this month, which took some time due to the sheer number of matches the streak encompasses.\n\nThe NCAA doesn't keep statistics for tennis (or for many other varsity sports--see this page for the list), so the responsibility for tracking them falls to the individual schools, and I owe a huge debt to Stanford's SID Brian Risso, who tracked and documented the Cardinal women's team streak from 1999 through its end in 2011. Ohio State can break the record next year, although it's fair to note that the Stanford women's streak does include three NCAA Sweet 16s they hosted. Stanford won two of them to keep the streak going in 2002 and 2006, but it ended in the finals of the NCAAs in 2011. For more on their amazing streak, see this review.\n\nThe Wimbledon draws were released this morning, with all the attention centered around what quarter No. 5 seed Rafael Nadal would fall in. It turned out to be No. 3 seed Federer's, who would have to beat No. 2 Andy Murray and No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals and finals (should they all advance to those matches, of course) to defend his title.\n\nA total of 14 US women and 11 US men are competing in the singles main draw. Qualifier Bobby Reynolds and wild card Steve Johnson are the only two American men playing each other, with the winner probably facing Djokovic in the second round. The other nine US men and their first round opponents: Ryan Harrison v. No. 28 Jeremy Chardy(FRA); Wayne Odesnik v. Jimmy Wang(TPE); James Blake v. Thiemo De Bakker(NED); No. 21 Sam Querrey v. Bernard Tomic(AUS); Alex Kuznetsov v. Igor Sijsling(NED); Denis Kudla v. James Duckworth(AUS); Michael Russell v. Grega Semlja(SLO); No. 18 John Isner v. Evengy Donskoy(RUS) and Rajeev Ram v. Lukas Lacko(SVK).\n\nTwo matches in the women's main draw will be all-American affairs, with Alexa Glatch facing Christina McHale, and in the blockbuster first rounder, No. 17 seed Sloane Stephens playing Jamie Hampton. Stephens hasn't played since reaching the fourth round of the French, while Hampton, who also reached the fourth round in Paris, is into her first WTA final Saturday in Eastbourne after a three-set victory over Caroline Wozniacki today.\n\nThe other ten US women and their first round opponents: No. 1 Serena Williams v. Mandy Minella(LUX); Alison Riske v. No. 31 Romina Oprandi(SUI); Mallory Burdette v. Urszula Radwanska(POL); Bethanie Mattek-Sands v. No. 7 Angelique Kerber(GER); Madison Keys v. Heather Watson(GBR); No. 26 Varvara Lepchenko v. Eva Birnerova(CZE); Lauren Davis v. No. 27 Lucie Safarova(CZE); Melanie Oudin v. Michelle Larcher de Brito(POR); CoCo Vandeweghe v. No. 7 Petra Kvitova(CZE) and Vania King, who did get in as a lucky loser, v. No. 29 Alize Cornet(FRA).\n\nFrom what I gather, the bottom half of both draws will play Monday.\n\nComplete draws can be found here.\n\nThe Maureen Connolly Trophy Challenge was won by the US girls, who beat Great Britain 8-4 after having a 5-1 lead going into today's matches. The Great Britain boys won the LTA Junior Challenge trophy 7-3. I don't know why they didn't complete the final two doubles matches. I don't have complete individual results, but information from the British Tennis twitter had Stefan Kozlov, Luca Corinteli and Jamie Loeb winning their singles matches, with Noah Rubin, Louisa Chirico and Taylor Townsend losing theirs.\n\nQualifying is complete for the ITF Grade 1 in Roehampton, which begins on Sunday. Dasha Ivanova and Katrine Steffensen of the US both qualified. The draws and order of play for the tournament will be available on the LTA website under the Latest British Events section on the right of the home page.\n\nAll six US men who won their first round Wimbledon qualifying matches on Monday won their second round matches today, and with one more victory necessary on Wednesday to reach the main draw.\n\nFive qualifiers are the maximum however, as No. 12 seed Rhyne Williams and No. 27 seed Bobby Reynolds will meet in one final round qualifying match. No. 4 seed Wayne Odesnik, No. 6 seed Denis Kudla, No. 8 seed Tim Smyczek and unseeded Alex Kuznetsov advanced to the final round of qualifying with wins today. Odesnik plays No. 20 seed Olivier Rochus of Belgium, Kudla faces No. 23 seed Ruben Bemelmans also of Belgium, Smyczek plays Australian Matt Reid and Kuznetsov meets yet another Belgian, Maxime Authom.\n\nThe women's qualifying began today, with five of the 11 US women advancing to Wednesday's second round. The two most recent US Open girls champions, Samantha Crawford and Grace Min, picked up victories, with 2012 champion Crawford defeating Chiara Scholl 6-2, 7-5 and 2011 champion Min beating Stephanie Vogt of Liechtenstein 6-3, 6-2. Crawford has traveled to London but will play another American again Tuesday, No. 10 seed Vania King, who defeated wild card Lisa Whybourn of Great Britain 6-1, 7-5(5). Irina Falconi zipped past Kateryna Kozlova of Ukraine 6-2, 6-1 and another former college star, Maria Sanchez, the No. 12 seed, also got through in straight sets, defeating Ana Vrljic of Croatia 7-5, 6-1. Julia Cohen, Jessica Pegula(14), Nicole Gibbs, Madison Brengle and Shelby Rogers fell in their opening round matches.\n\nFor more on Tuesday's men's qualifying see this article from the tournament website. For a review of some of the first round of women's qualifying, see this article.\n\nThe qualifying draws can be found here.\n\nA couple of the sectional qualifying events for the US Open National Playoffs were completed over the weekend in the New England and Eastern sections.\n\nStanford freshman Nolan Paige won the New England men's tournament for the third time in four years. Fifteen-year-old Meghan Kelley won the women's tournament to earn a place in the National Playoff in August at the New Haven Open. Kelley also won the mixed doubles tournament, with 33-year-old Daniel Quiceno.\n\nIn the Eastern section tournaments, Damon Gooch, the former Elon standout, picked up his second straight national berth with a win over Oklahoma State freshman Richard Del Nunzio. Gooch won the Mid-Atlantic sectional qualifying tournament last year. Magda Okruashvili defended her title in the women's tournament, beating Princeton recruit Alanna Wolff in the final. Two former college players, Tarakaa Bertrand (Vanderbilt) and Sam Sweeney (North Central) won the mixed doubles tournament.\n\nThe Northern California sectional qualifying begins Wednesday, with pop star Red Foo (Stefan Gordy) scheduled to play his first match Wednesday evening. Ayaka Okuno, the Georgia freshman who has been coached by Gordy during her junior career, is in the women's tournament, and they are playing as a team in the mixed. Area juniors CiCi Bellis, Mary Closs and Hadley Berg are in the women's draw as are USC's Giuliana Olmos and Cal's Anett Schutting. Amy Bowtell of Ireland is also in the draw, and despite her WTA ranking of 450, she is not seeded, even though the seeding criteria says \"Within each division, the top two players/teams will be seeded based on their ATP/WTA computer ranking (if any).\"\n\nWith the newly designed USTA website, I'm not able to find any of the releases I'm being sent, but if you would like to read the full release on these playoffs, I've posted it via google drive.\n\nSix of the ten US men who took to the courts of Roehampton today for the first round of Wimbledon qualifying will be back on Tuesday for the second round. No. 4 seed Wayne Odesnik, No. 6 seed Denis Kudla, No. 8 seed Tim Smyczek, No. 12 seed Rhyne Williams and No. 27 seed Bobby Reynolds all won in straight sets, as did unseeded Alex Kuznetsov.\n\nRobby Ginepri withdrew before the start of play, and Michael Yani, Donald Young, Bradley Klahn and No. 2 seed Jack Sock all dropped their first matches. Sock lost 6-2, 6-2 to Mischa Zverev of Germany, a disappointing loss for him after an impressive French Open run, but it was Klahn who is probably most upset this evening. Klahn had three match points against 19-year-old wild card Filip Peliwo of Canada at 5-4 in the third and again served for the match at 7-6 before falling 6-2, 2-6, 9-7 to the 2012 Wimbledon and US Open boys champion.\n\nPeliwo, who plays Kudla in the second round Tuesday, described the zone he was in in the final few games of the match in this article about the day's qualifying at the Wimbledon website.\n\nThe women's first round of qualifying gets underway on Tuesday, with 96 players vying for 12 main draw spots. The 11 American women in the draw are Julia Cohen, Grace Min, Irina Falconi, Jessica Pegula(14), Nicole Gibbs, Madison Brengle, Vania King(10), Samantha Crawford, Chiara Scholl, Shelby Rogers and Maria Sanchez(12). Unlike the men, who all faced players from outside the US in the first round, Crawford will play Scholl in the opening round.\n\nCohen drew No. 4 seed Polona Hercog of Slovenia, Min plays Stephanie Vogt of Liechtenstein, Falconi faces Kateryna Kozlova of Ukraine and Pegula meets Cagla Buyukakcay of Turkey. NCAA champion Gibbs plays No. 7 seed Yvonne Meusburger of Austria, Brengle faces Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland, King drew wild card Lisa Whybourn of Great Britain, Rogers plays a former ITF World No. 1 junior in An-Sophie Mestach of Belgium and Sanchez faces Ana Vrljic of Croatia.\n\nFor qualifying draws, see the Wimbledon website.\n\nAlthough he won a qualifying round at Wimbledon last year as a 17-year-old wild card, Kyle Edmund of Great Britain picked up his first official ATP tour win today in Eastbourne, defeating Kenny De Shepper of France 6-4, 6-4. Edmund, who received a main draw wild card into Wimbledon this year, one of only two British men to be so rewarded, is also still entered in the draw at the Wimbledon Juniors. Edmund provides some thoughts on controlling his nerves in this article about his win at the BBC.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin announced Tina Samara as their choice to replace women's head coach Brian Fleishman, who resigned early last month. Samara spent two years at the University of West Virginia and was at Louisiana-Lafayette before that. The Charleston West Virginia Gazette had published this article about her presumed departure prior to today's announcement from Wisconsin.\n\nWimbledon qualifying begins for men Monday at Roehampton, with 11 Americans in the 128-draw.\n\nThey are: Jack Sock(2), Wayne Odesnik(4), Denis Kudla(6), Tim Smyczek(8), Rhyne Williams(12), Bobby Reynolds(27) Alex Kuznetsov, Michael Yani, Robby Ginepri, Donald Young and Bradley Klahn.\n\nAlex Kuznetsov has drawn 19-year-old British wild card Joshua Ward Hibbert, who was slated to go to Texas A&M before deciding to turn pro instead. Klahn also gets a 19-year-old wild card opponent, 2012 Wimbledon and US Open boys champion Filip Peliwo of Canada. Sock plays Mischa Zverev of Germany, who reached the quarterfinals of the ATP event in Halle before losing 6-0, 6-0 to Roger Federer. Smyczek has drawn Adrian Menendez-Maceiras of Spain; Ginepri plays No. 19 seed Simon Greul of Germany; Yani meets Denys Molchanov of Ukraine; Young plays Agustin Velotti of Argenina; Odesnik faces Thiago Alves of Brazil; Reynolds meets Jorge Aguilar of Chile; Williams plays Victor Crivoi of Romania and Kudla has drawn Pierre-Hugues Herbert of France.\n\nOne of the players in qualifying, Ukraine's Oleksandr Nedovyesov, is going straight from the clay Challenger in Prague, which he won today, to the grass of Roehampton. But the former Oklahoma State cowboy, who beat Javier Marti 6-0, 6-1 to win his first Challenger title, is fourth on Monday's schedule, so perhaps he'll find a grass court to practice on early in the day.\n\nFor more on Nedovyesov's win today, see this account, with photos, at Tennis Alternative.\n\nThe United States trails just two countries in number of players in the men's qualifying, with Germany and France both placing 12 in the draw.\n\nWimbledon announced today that Alison Riske has received a main draw wild card after she reached the semifinals of the WTA event in Birmingham. There is still another women's main draw wild card to be distributed. The current list is here.\n\nThe ITF International Grass Court Championships, held annually in Philadelphia, concluded yesterday despite a week of wet weather forcing a change of venue midweek, although the finals were played at the Merion Cricket Club, near the site of this weekend's US golf Open.\n\nAlex Rybkov, the top seed, won the boys singles title, defeating unseeded David Wilczynski 6-2, 6-4. It was the 16-year-old Floridian's third ITF Grade 4 title of the year.\n\nFourteen-year-old CiCi Bellis won her first ITF title, defeating No. 2 seed Kaitlyn McCarthy 6-0, 3-6, 6-3 in the final, after Bellis had beaten top seed Johnnise Renaud 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the quarterfinals.\n\nAron Pierce and Emil Reinberg won the boys doubles title when they were given a walkover by Stefan Cooper of Great Britain and Shaquille Taylor of the Bahamas. Taylor Ng and Christina Rosca won the girls doubles championship, beating Sophie Chang and Jessica Golovin 6-4, 1-6, 10-5. None of the doubles teams in the finals were seeded.\n\nIn the finals of the $10,000 Pro Circuit events today, University of Florida freshman Brianna Morgan won her first title, with the wild card entry defeating top seed Jessica Moore of Australia 7-6(3), 6-3 in Bethany Beach Delaware. At the Indian Harbour Beach Futures, No. 7 seed Jesse Witten won his first title in four years, defeating Mitchell Frank 6-1, 6-4.\n\nOther titles won by familiar faces to those following college and junior tennis in the United States include NCAA champion Blaz Rola taking the $10,000 Mexican Futures, Bjorn Fratangelo winning the $15,000 Netherlands Futures, and 17-year-old Hyeon Chung of Korea claiming his first pro title at the $10,000 Korea Futures.\n\nMy interview with Dustin Taylor, who has recently been named the USTA National Coach - Collegiate Tennis, is available now on the Tennis Recruiting Network. Taylor and I spoke at length last month at the NCAAs, and while I learned about his background and previous coaching experiences, the focus was how this related to his dreams for the revamped USTA Collegiate Team.\n\nThe goal of creating a team that has the prestige of being named an All-American is not a modest aim. But if it can become a significant part of the structure of the USTA's collegiate pathway, the benefits will go beyond any individual accolade. I know from talking with Taylor that he is committed to college tennis, and his new position provides more evidence that the USTA is too. Let's hope Taylor can grow his area so that college tennis is a significant presence in the Player Development structure.\n\nSteve Johnson, one of the recent college players Taylor mentions in the interview, has reached the final of the Nottingham II Challenger, defeating another two-time NCAA champion, Somdev Devvarman of India, 6-3, 6-4 in today's rain-delayed semifinal. Johnson will meet unseeded Ruben Bemelmans of Belgium in Saturday's final, and as Steve at Shank Tennis pointed out on twitter, a Wimbledon main draw wild card may be on the line. Although there is no formal arrangement, last year Wimbledon awarded Nottingham II winner Grega Zemlja of Slovenia a main draw wild card, and both Johnson and Bemelmans are preparing to play Wimbledon qualifying beginning Monday, just as Zemlja would have done had he not received the wild card last year. This is Johnson's second Challenger final--he won the Aptos Challenger last August, and, coincidentally, that win earned him a wild card into the US Open.\n\nThe University of Alabama women announced signings for the fall, and Canada's Erin Routliffe, one of the most sought-after recruits who wasn't signed in November, is among them. Routliffe, who won the 16s singles and doubles titles at the 2011 Orange Bowl, has been ranked as high as 17 in the ITF juniors. In addition to Routliffe, Alabama has signed Carmen Blanco and Luicelena Perez of Venezuela and Danielle Spielmann of Switzerland. The Northwestern women added Brooke Rischbieth of Australia to their already strong recruiting class, and Southern Cal confirmed the transfer of Brynn Boren from Tennessee.\n\nAnd a quick update on the two $10,000 Pro Circuit events this week, which are now through to the semifinals. At the women's tournament in Delaware, top seed Jessica Moore of Australia is joined in the semifinals by three young Americans: Florida freshman Brianna Morgan and 17-year-olds Brooke Austin(2) and Peggy Porter.\n\nIn the men's tournament in Florida, it's Jesse Witten(7) facing Fernando Romboli of Brazil in one semifinal and Mitchell Frank against last week's champion Marcelo Arevalo(2) of El Salvador in the other.\n\nAndy Jackson, who resigned as head coach of the Florida Gators a little over a year ago, has been hired for the same position at the University of Arkansas. Jackson, who coached the Mississippi State women and then the Mississippi State men prior to taking the job at Floridia in 2001, takes over for longtime Razorback coach Robert Cox, who will continue to work for the Arkansas athletic department. For the complete release, with remarks from Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long and Jackson, click here.\n\nThe women's head coaching position at the University of Kansas has also been filled, with Texas Tech women's assistant Todd Chapman taking over the Jayhawks. For that release, click here.\n\nLast month, Ohio State named Melissa Schaub head coach of the women's team, after she had functioned with the interim tag during the 2012-13 season.\n\nPittsburgh and Wisconsin have not yet announced who will lead their women's programs beginning this fall.\n\nChristian Thompson has been named women's head coach at the University of Denver after a season as the assistant there. Thompson takes over for Jeremy Wurtzman, who left to take the men's assistant position at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe University of Washington has a new women's assistant, Angelo Niculescu. According this release, Luke Shields has left that post in Washington to become the men's assistant at his alma mater Boise State. Younger brother Clancy Shields left that job to take the men's head coaching job at Utah State.\n\nThe word on Facebook, although as yet unconfirmed by the Wake Forest sports information department, has Mississippi State's Romain Bogaerts, the ITA Rookie of the Year, and teammate Pedro Dumont transferring to the Demon Deacons.\n\nLSU has announced the transfer of Andrew Korinek from Texas. Oregon announced the transfers of Joey Swaysland from Texas and Kevin Farin from the University of Brussels.\n\nUnrelated to coaching or transferring, but NCAA champion Nicole Gibbs recounted her run to her second straight singles title with this match-by-match analysis on the Stanford website.\n\nMen's NCAA singles champion Blaz Rola was named Ohio State's Male Athlete of the Year today."
