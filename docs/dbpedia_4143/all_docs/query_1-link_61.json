        "text": "THE mysterious dark matter thought to make up most of the Universe’s mass\n\ncould be made of particles 10 trillion times heavier than a proton, new research\n\nsuggests. If so, detectors might one day trap dark matter in the form of an\n\nextremely heavy type of hydrogen.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of the matter in the Universe is invisible, and can be\n\ndetected only by its gravitational effects on stars and galaxies. Now\n\ntheoretical work done by Edward Kolb of Fermilab, near Chicago, suggests that\n\nthe dark matter sprang into being as superheavy particles moments after the\n\nUniverse formed. The particles would have been created at the end of the\n\ninflationary epoch, the period of tremendous growth during the first split\n\nsecond of the Universe’s existence.\n\nThe inflationary epoch was characterised by huge negative pressure.\n\nEinstein’s general theory of relativity recognises pressure as a source of\n\ngravity just like mass, so the huge pressure resulted in powerful gravity. “It\n\nwas the sudden removal of this gravity, when the Universe switched to a more\n\nsedate expansion at the end of inflation, that could have produced superheavy\n\nparticles,” says Kolb.\n\nDuring the inflationary epoch, particles and their antiparticles were\n\ncontinually conjured out of nothing as energy was briefly borrowed from the\n\ngravitational field. However, when inflation ended, the sudden change in gravity\n\npulled particles and their antiparticles farther apart, making it harder for\n\nthem to meet and annihilate each other. A similar change in gravity, in space\n\nrather than time, causes a net production of particles in the vicinity of a\n\nblack hole, a process known as Hawking radiation.\n\nKolb’s team says it is the strength of gravity at the end of inflation that\n\ndetermines the mass of superheavy particles. Although the strength is uncertain,\n\nthey calculate that it should have been enough to create particles about 10\n\ntrillion times heavier than a proton. Kolb’s team has also calculated the number\n\nthat would have appeared, and they say it is “just right to account for the\n\nUniverse’s dark matter”.\n\nIf true, this could be bad news for experimental physicists. Relatively few\n\nparticles would account for the dark matter, so the chances of detecting them\n\nwould be small. However, Kolb says there is no reason why such particles should\n\nnot be electrically charged or feel the strong force, making them easier to\n\nfind. A positively charged particle might even attract an electron to make a\n\nsuperheavy kind of hydrogen that would be detectable."
