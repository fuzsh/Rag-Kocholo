        "text": "At first, I constantly badgered my manager, a very kind and smart physicist named Jae, for answers. He was very patient with me and helped whenever I asked. However, he was often out to different parts of campus for various meetings, and during these times my progress all but came to a halt. I would get antsy, bored, demoralized, and try to kill time until Jae got back.\n\nOne day, another researcher came into our office and saw me playing Solitaire. He was amused. I was mortified. We talked about what I had been tasked with for the summer and he explained that I should only ask for help if I truly can’t figure something out on my own. He pointed me to a wealth of resources both on Fermilab’s Intranet as well as external websites, all of which Jae had shown me my first week which I quickly scanned once and never thought about again.\n\n***\n\nThe most important parts of our jobs aren’t what have been completely laid out for us. Yes, we have to deliver on those, but it’s how we deliver and what else we do to make the project better that are most interesting and valuable. Waiting around being told what to do and how to do it is perhaps how we’re taught in K-12, but the real world demands that we take initiative and figure things out for ourselves.\n\nGetting stuck is part of learning, and also part of learning how to learn.\n\nMy summer at Fermilab was unforgettable. In addition to learning a lot about physics, I also learned an important lesson about taking initiative that continues to serve me in my personal and professional life."
