        "text": "I was born in 1949 in Yakima, Washington and grew up in Selah, a town of about 3000 people not far away from there.Â You can read about my family and my early childhood in the McLerran section of this webpage.Â\n\nSelah was a wonderful place to be a kid.Â I could ride my bike anywhere.Â Â My parents were not worried about such independence, being more worried by visions of Communists from Russia or China than of predatory child molesters. Every kid who was old enough to walk went door to door for Halloween, and all the candy got eaten.\n\nI had favorite fishing spots, and hikes and long bicycle rides took me to them.Â I was never too picky about the kind of fish I caught; I was happiest simply with catching a lot of them.Â Â\n\nI had my first job when I was 14 years old.Â I picked corn, following a truck through fields in hundred- degree heat.Â I acquired a rich vocabulary from older workers which in times of stress naturally comes back to me.Â I worked every summer on the farms in a variety of roles, and by the time I was in college was probably the fastest apple picker in the orchards where I worked.Â I could make around 50 dollars a day.\n\nI still remember a coyote which would come to a pile of wood I used for propping trees where I worked in one of the orchards.Â He wanted to get close and make friends, but every time he started to move forward toward me he thought about it and pulled back.Â I also met an old man who was incapable of telling a lie, and it got me thinking hard about honesty.Â In the end I concluded that lying was probably not such a good thing for most people, since you have to remember all your lies, and if you are caught out once, you are finished (unless you are a politician).\n\nI went to school in Selah until my junior year in high school.Â I was a good student but not an outstanding one.Â The young people I went to school with in Selah have as the years pass become more and more interesting to me.Â I was recently at the 40 year anniversary of Selah High School, and received a CD showing photos of the classmates as young people.Â I can now see in those images things that I did not think about or appreciate at the time.Â In almost all of the photos, you can sense drive, energy and optimism.Â There is an eagerness to take on the world, an impatience with being young, and a body posture of challenge.Â\n\nI think this was a very good time in history, and Selah was good for the kids growing up there. There was a strong sense that the world would be a better place, that we would do better than our parents, and that our children would do better yet.\n\nThere was of course tension.Â The Cuban missile crisis came and went.Â Many of my friendsâ families had fallout shelters dug into their backyards, and we boys would use them as a place to read our favorite magazines.Â There were above-ground nuclear tests in those days, and 50 miles away at the Hanford Atomic Works they were carelessly venting radioactive gasÂ and doing a poor job of storing radioactive waste. Yet these things did not seem close to our lives.\n\nOf course, the Vietnam War came in my last years of high school, and this war I think greatly changed the psychology of America.Â Optimism changed to cynicism, and pride to anger and then to shame -- both over what we did in Vietnam and what we did to our young people who had served there.Â A lot of time has passed now, and many of the scars of that era have faded.Â But the war damn near destroyed some of my best friends.Â Somehow they managed to pull themselves back together again and raise good families and kids of which they are very proud.Â My friends were lucky.Â Not all those damaged by the war made their way back with such success.Â\n\nI now have a good friend, Dam Son, who is from Hanoi in Vietnam.Â We first met in Moscow about 15 years ago.Â We were sharing an office, and at first we both hesitated to talk with one another about the war.Â After talking a little bit of physics with me, Dam asked me what I thought about the Vietnam War.Â I told him I was not too happy about what we did there, but I was much less happy with his country.Â I can read some Russian, and had read a propaganda novel supposedly written by a North Vietnamese soldier.Â I was sickened by the bragging about how they murdered the families of teachers and doctors in towns that they had âliberatedâ simply because of their âclassâ.Â Â Dam and I talked for a little while, and then he simply told me that when he was a baby, the bombing had ended. I understood that much time had passed, and he was younger than I.\n\nSelah was a town of farmers, many of whom had immigrated to the Yakima Valley during the Dust Bowl.Â Those who were not from Arkansas or Oklahoma or Missouri also had struggled through the Great Depression, largely by the sweat on their backs.Â People were proud of what they had accomplished, and had little tolerance for those who didnât make it.\n\nIn my junior year, I moved to Richland, where I graduated from High School.Â Richland is an unusual town.Â The Hanford Atomic Works, nearby, was one of the places where work was done on the atomic bomb during the Second World War. The town was built for the workers, managers, engineers and scientists who built the chemical separations facilities essential for the atomic bomb project during the war.Â Richland was a secret city for a period during and immediately after the war.Â The high school team name is The Bombers.Â The young people there were largely the children of upper-middle-class college graduates.Â Most parents had carefully planned out their childrenâs futures.Â Â\n\nI graduated from Richland High School in 1967, and was accepted for college at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nI was the first of my family to go to college, and had no idea what to expect.Â Although the university I had chosen was in Seattle, just on the other side of the Cascade Mountains, for me it was a new world.Â The west side of the mountains, where Seattle is located, has a history and traditionsÂ that differ from those of the east side.Â The greater Seattle area dwarfs Yakima in size and population. The people who live there have largely recently moved from other parts of the country or the world.Â There is a large Asian population, many of whom have deeper roots in the Northwest than the average inhabitant of European background.Â The geography is different, and it often rains on the west side of the Cascades, but rain seldom gets across the mountains on the east side.Â\n\nMany of theÂ folks living west of the mountains have little respect or appreciation of the values of the people from eastern Washington, sentiments often mirrored by the estimate of those to the east of people on the Seattle side.Â Â Â Those to the west see the population of eastern Washington as ignorant, uneducated rednecks.Â Rednecks is an expression which comes from the burn one gets laboring in the hot sun, and some intellectuals consider such labor demeaning; and the word redneck is used as an insult.Â Many east of the mountains, on the other hand, view those choosing to live on the other side of the mountains as apt to be lazy and âentitledâÂ -- expecting the Government to compensate for failure.Â The cultures, values and histories of these people are almost as different as those of France and the United States.\n\nAt the University, I found myself for the first time surrounded by people who had real interest in books and learning.Â I remember during my freshman year how I got the two-volume Penguin edition of War and Peace, andÂ read it in a few nights, staying up late until three or four in the morning.Â This is still my favorite book and I have read it many times, both in Russian and in English, astounded by Tolstoyâs ability to portray characters in a manner so three-dimensional that I have been able to view them from different perspectives at different times in my life.Â\n\nI found that to understand my classes I had to read and think hard about what was said, and then to learn to work with the ideas.Â Â The process required discipline.Â I had come with little of that, and had to acquire it.Â All this was all new to me.Â Â As had been the case in high school,Â as an undergraduate I was a good but not outstanding student.\n\nI began as a pre-medical student with a major in chemistry.Â I rapidly discovered that this goal was not for me. Chemistry and the pre-medical curriculum required memorization, and I was never good at that.Â I liked to take apart what I learned and recombine it with other ways of thinking and try to rearrange the ideas before recombining them.Â Chemistry is to me was what Scientific Communism was to my Russian colleagues:Â Both are fields where it could be dangerous to reinterpret in a creative manner.\n\nI soon found that physics was suited to my taste.Â I began taking physics in my sophomore year, and to complete a major in this field was difficult because a degree really required four years of study.Â At that time, the Vietnam War was in full swing, and I knew I would be drafted if I stayed a fourth year.Â In any case, I could not afford to be a student more than four years.Â It was too expensive.Â I decided I would take my FreshmanÂ and Sophomore level courses in physics during the same year.Â This was possible, but it required a lot of work.\n\nThere was much going on outside of my classrooms.Â There were many protests against the Vietnam War.Â I rode on a bus full of radicals and hippies to San Francisco to go on a huge peace march.Â IÂ was involved with the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, and Draft Resistance Seattle.Â I remember one woman who was a leader in the Students for a Democratic Society who loved to yell into a megaphone.Â Twenty five years later I was on the University of Washington campus, and the very same woman was still yelling into a megaphone.Â Â Holy Hubert who came up from San Francisco to teach heathen students about God, was already a well-known campus personality when I was an undergraduate.Â He had two friends who ran a fundamentalist congregation; they walked around preaching wearing gunny sacks.Â One night the two friends had an argument, and one of them shot and killed the other.\n\nThere was the Red Robin Tavern, which was down below the ship canal bridge.Â This was a place where members of the far left Students for a Democratic Society would some times hang out.Â I think they liked the name, and the atmosphere was suitably proletarian.Â It was bought some years later by a group of investors who have opened up a chain of the same name. There is still a Red Robin in Seattle, near the site of the original tavern.\n\nWe had campus politics as well.Â Tom Gunn ran and won the presidency of the UW student body.Â He won because there was a stripper who had recently won the presidency of the Stanford student body and she came up and gave a âspeechâ for him.Â She gave an inspiring speech.Â The next year, a dog ran and came in second.\n\nI somehow survived the rather arduous curriculum I had set up for myself.Â I think I probably wouldÂ have finished with my bachelorâs degree and gone of to get a job were it not for some beautiful lectures on mathematical physics given by Lowell Brown during my senior year.Â Lowell has a way of makingÂ ideas very elegant, and I admired his crisp and precise way of thinking.Â I decided to apply to graduate school, but only atÂ the University of Washington, as for personal reasons I could not leave the Seattle area.Â I receivedÂ a teaching assistantship that gave me a small stipend and paid my tuition.\n\nI remember my first year courses very well.Â Homework problems would sometimes take me days to finish.Â I learned that really solving hard problems means allowing them to possess your mind day and night.Â Often in the middle of the night, or when you are riding a bike in to the University, you discover a new way to think, and it is a good feeling. Much later, I learned that I think in unusual ways, and what had given me trouble as a high school student or an undergraduate had some advantage as a theoretical physicist. Such thinking isÂ good for generating new ideas, but perhaps not ideal for solving homework problems and taking tests.\n\nI started doing research towards the end of my first year,Â Ken Johnson was visiting the University of Washington from MIT.Â I asked him if I could learn quantum field theory from him, and he agreed.Â Ken was a very good teacher.Â He started simply by suggesting some books to read.Â Every week or so, I would come and ask him some questions about what I had read.Â He gently led me to more advanced texts, and in a few months I understood most of the basic ideas.\n\nBy the beginning of the second year I was actively doing research.Â I started with Marshall Baker on problems related to high energy scattering.Â Marshall is a very kind and gentle person.Â He helped me to think creatively and taught me that carefully crafting a concept can often be more powerful than using elaborately developed mathematics to extend these concepts.Â\n\nWhen Marshall went on sabbatical, I started working with Lowell Brown on what became my thesis.Â The thesis project is described in the Physics section of the webpage.Â Lowell is a strong calculator, and once an idea is clearly spelled out will develop it with great skill, elegance and accuracy.Â Â Lowell taught me that using elaborate mathematics to clarify half-thought ideas is often more powerful than a creative but incompletely developed thought.Â I finished the work for my thesis project by the end of my third year, and then returned to work with Marshall on high energy scattering.Â\n\nIn my last year in graduate school, I applied for postdoctoral positions.Â Lowell and Marshall wrote very strong letters of recommendation, and I got offers from MIT, Princeton, Stanford and Cal Tech.Â I accepted the offer at MIT.Â I was able to fly around the country for the first time in my life when I gave talks as part of the interview for jobs.Â (I lost all of my socks and underwear on this trip, and with a graduate student stipend, that is a big loss.) The talk I offered was prepared following the strong advice of Lowell and Bob Cahn that a good talk should have slides with mainly illustrations, and only about one equation per slide.Â I still use that advice on young people.Â Keeping equations to a minimum and graphics to a maximum forces you to explain ideas rather than present the details.\n\nI received my Bachelorâs degree in 1971 and my PhD in 1975 from the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nBoston is a tough place for anyone who had never been outside of the Northwest.Â I was asked for the first time in my life âWhere are you from?âÂ I honestly did not know what was being asked, since the question was repeated after I said Seattle in a confused voice.Â After a while I figured out they wanted to know which country my ancestors on my fathers side had been from before coming to America.Â I knew the answer was Scotland, but it was a strange question because those ancestors had arrived in the US in the 1700âs, and had intermarried across ethnic and racial divides.Â Â Â\n\nMIT was a tough place for me too.Â The postdoctoral fellows and students are on one floor and the faculty on the floor below them in the Center for Theoretical Physics, and this reflects the separation of physicists of various levels of experience into something akin to classes, a formality with which I had no prior experience.Â Moreover, as a graduate student at the University of Washington, I would have only one or two young people with whom to discuss physics, and I was rarely challenged.Â At MIT, there was constant challenge by students, postdocs and faculty.Â They did not suffer fools gladly, and I was afraid that I might be a simple fool.Â There were good reasons for their behavior and my insecurity.Â At graduate schools like Harvard or MIT, there is a much more demanding curriculum and a wider range of courses.Â Students there are tested all the time in conversation, seminar and exam.Â I simply had not developed the knowledge nor the rhetorical skills to deal with the talented people who surrounded me.Â I had to spend much of my time learning new ideas, because I in fact did not understand many of the issues discussed. I probably missed some of what MIT offered by needing to fill in the blanks that my earlier preparation had allowed.Â I now try to always build an environment of challenge among young people with whom I have responsibility.Â It is the methodology of science.\n\nI did learn many new ideas, and developed some of my own while at MIT.Â Ken Johnson, who had mentored me at Seattle, suggested that I think about quarks at very high density.Â Â This was a good project for me since it used my computational skills, and while doing the computations, gave me the time I needed to learn some of the many new ideas I was hearing.Â The work on Quark Matter is described in the Physics section.\n\nAbout a half a year after arriving at MIT, I met Alice and we were married a few months later.Â We had a number of young friends among the students, faculty and staff at MIT.Â We would often go out to the F and T Diner in Kendall Square for beer and fries on Friday night.Â We would recite the universal litany of young scientists everywhere, one that involves themes like:Â Why does he have a job and I donât?Â Â Wouldnât it be good for the job market if there wasÂ a big scientific meeting and all the full professors were on one plane, , , , There were âMany Tears in the Beers.âÂ Â One of Aliceâs favorite Tom Swifties came from the wall above the toilet of the F and T:Â ââI am neither a homosexual nor a necrophiliac,â said Tom in dead Ernest.âÂ\n\nOne of my best friends was Charles Thorn.Â We introduced him to Aliceâs best friend, Mary Furman.\n\nThey fell in love, and now are living happily ever after in Gainesville, Florida.Â My collaborator, Barry Freedman, was an incredibly hard-working and delightful young man.Â He later developed a numerical algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem:Â How to minimize the connection times between various cities during a round trip.Â HeÂ became deputy director of operations for Northwest Airlines.Â I also worked with Roscoe Giles, a totally off-scale theoretical physicist from Stanford who was gifted both in human relations and in his intuitive feel for physics.Â Sometimes you meet ânaturalsâ who effortlessly and quietly soar. Roscoe was the first such person I had met.\n\nMyron Pauli was another student at MIT then.Â Myron was the grand-nephew of the very famous theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, and now works for the Naval Research Labs.Â Myron was at that time a perfect portrait of a mad scientist.Â He wrote songs about the faculty at MIT sung to the lyrics of well known, or at that time popular, music.Â For Ken Johnson (who had invented the MIT Bag Model), to the tune of Old MacDonaldâs Farm:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Old Ken Johnson had a bag. E I E IO. . . .\n\nÂ Â Â Â With a quark quark here, a quark quark there\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Here a quark, there a quark\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Everywhere a quark quark, , ,Â\n\nFor John Negele (who wrote big computer codes) to the tune of âCharley on the MTAâ (a song about how Charley was condemned to ride the subway forever because of a fare increase he could not afford to pay to exit):\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â No it never convergedÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â No it never converged\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â And its fate is still unknown\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â It runs forever âneath the streets of Boston\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Itâs the program that never converged\n\nThese were times when I learned much about science and perhaps even more about people.Â The atmosphere was indeed tough at MIT, but it worked well enough for me, and it got me involved in a set of problems that has been the central focus of my career in theoretical physics.Â I think one cannot ask for more.\n\nI stayed three years at MIT, and accepted a postdoctoral fellowship in 1980 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.\n\nOne of Helmutâs students was Fritjof Karsch who is now well known for his work on QCD at finite temperature and density using lattice Monte Carlo methods.Â He now runs a group at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), where I work, doing forefront computations using the worlds fastest computers.\n\nAt this meeting, Rob Pisarski gave a talk about his work on QCD at high temperature.Â He was trying in understand aspects related to the vacuum properties of the theory, and to the Chern-Simons charge.\n\n(Chern-Simons charge is explained in the section Physics.)Â Rob is my colleague at BNL, with whom I am now actively collaborating.\n\nI also made friends with Andrei Linde, who was developing his theory of the inflationary universe for which he is now famous.Â He also presented arguments which showed that one could not compute as an expansion in the interaction strength at finite temperature beyond a certain order.\n\nThere were two Polish physicists there with whom I began to form friendships that have lasted through the years, Krzysztof Redlich and Ludwig Turko.Â Krzysztof barely spoke English, and at the meeting he was verbally beaten up badly by Johann Rafelski.Â My friend Ebs Hilf from Darmstadt, whom I had met during his visit to Seattle a year before, got so angry that he in turn stood up and verbally obliteratedÂ Rafelski.Â Krzysztof emphatically states that this was all very good for his career.Â Ludwig Turko was very stubborn,Â forceful and honest. Later, he was jailed for supporting Solidarity after the Polish Communists crushed that movement.Â Ludwig eventually became a member of parliament, before tiring of politics.Â He recommends neither jail nor politics.\n\nKeijo Kajantie, the central figure in FinnishÂ theoretical particle physics, and I began talking about how to think about high energy nuclear collisions.Â This was the start of a very long collaboration, which continues today with young people with whom we have both worked.\n\nHelmut and I developed a very strong personal friendship based on our mutual interests in all aspects of the field.Â We have been to many mountaintops together, and shared memorable times.\n\nAt nights, we younger folks would go to the Ambassador Club and spend the night until 2 or 3 in the morning talking about science, people and other things.Â The Ambassador Club was in a dark alley.Â You rang a bell, and then a slot in the door would open.Â They would look you over and let you in.Â Â Andrei Linde remembers I would always tell him âJust relax!â whenever he got excited by anything.Â He nowadays returns the favor, at a time suitably chosen.\n\nI most strongly recommend young physicists attend conferences and schools.Â It is rare that there is one which proved so influential in the development of a field as did that one at Bielefeld, but such meetings are almost inevitably where young people make professional friendships that last their lifetime.Â Friendships in science are very important.Â They transcend culture and politics.Â There are times in ones life when everything is very dark and your friends help you, or you help your friends.Â\n\nMy friend Ebs Hilf began encouraging me to attend the Hirschegg meetings in Austria which was run by his school, The Technical University at Darmstadt.Â I would meet Helmut, Keijo, Ludwig and Krzysztof again there.Â I also learned how to ski there, and have over time becomeÂ a reasonable skier.Â Skiing is also a useful skill for a theoretical physicist.Â Many meetings attract good people by taking place at a ski resort. It sounds like a boondoggle, but it is not. People work very hard in mornings and evenings and ski in the afternoon.Â You can usually book a hotel inexpensively late in the season.Â During the time you ski, you have a chance to think and discuss, and shy people begin to relax.Â Good ideas cannot be generated by linear thinking, and many times arise when confronted with new information in settings that gives your mind has time to get outside of itself. I have for many years now been on the Organizing Committee for Recontres de Moriond, which is a meeting each year in the Alps that also features skiing.Â It now focuses on young scientists, and was very important for me as a young scientist.Â It is one of a set of meetings founded by my friend Tran Thanh Van, and these meetings have been a source of many new ideas and lifelong friendships.\n\nAt one of the Hirschegg meetings,Â Ludwig and Krzysztof had a harrowing journey.Â They got permission from Poland to go to the meeting, but they could only go through Austria, and were not allowed to enter Germany.Â Hirschegg is a mountain valley whose only entrance is through Germany;Â the Polish authorities did not understand this.Â The two scientists somehow evaded the Austrian and German border police.\n\nThis was a feat equaled by Krzysztof about a year later.Â I had organized a meeting in Seattle and invited Krzysztof, but had no information that he would be able to attend.Â The day before the meeting began, I got a phone call late in the evening, and it was Krzysztof.Â He was at the physics building and he wanted to know where he was to go.Â Â He had apparently been given a plane ticket only to Montreal, Canada, and no money.Â At the Montreal airport, he met some Poles (whom he had not known before)Â who lent him enough money to get a plane ticket to Seattle.Â Â He arrived at Sea-Tac airport, and somehow figured out how to take public transportation to the airport, something few residents of that city ever learn.Â He got to the University late in the evening,Â convinced someone they should let him in, found a phone and a phone book, and called me.Â Krzysztof has always been a shoot first and ask questions later person.Â He explained to me that when he was told he could travel, he simply had to leave, there would be no second chance.Â He figured he could make the rest work out -- and he did.\n\nWe went on hikes with Krzysztof and others during that meeting.Â We found a lake in the Olympic mountains surrounded by blueberries that was full of fish.Â Â There were bears nearby so we spent hours talking about how important it was to wash your hands before you went to sleep, since the bears really love the smell of fish.Â Krzysztof fished until well after dark since every time he put his fly in the water, he got a fish.Â We tried to find a place to sleep some distance from Krzystof.\n\nAbout this time, the Isabelle accelerator project at Brookhaven National Laboratory was canceled.Â There was much discussion about whether to use what was constructed of the accelerator as the beginnings of an ultra-relativistic nuclear collider.Â This would provide a good experimental environment in which to test some of the ideas concerning the properties of high energy density matter.Â In 1983, I was part of a group participating in writing the long range plan for nuclear physics, and the nuclear physics community accepted this as its highest priority for new construction.Â This resulted in the RHIC accelerator at BNL, where I now work.\n\nI thought my physics was going very well, but apparently my colleagues in the high energy theory group felt otherwise.Â I remember when I was gone on a trip and Alice had lunch withÂ a fellow faculty member, Steve Ellis, and Steve more or less told her that he did not expect me to become tenured.Â Part of the issue was that when I was hired, the group also hired Tony Zee, a theorist who had not been promoted at Princeton.Â I knew TonyÂ most from his computation ofÂ the dependence of interaction strengths on short distance scales for almost all theories.Â He neglected to do the one for the theory which proved to be correct.Â David Gross, David Politzer, and Frank Wilczek received the Nobel prize for that result.\n\nIn any case, Tony had very definite ideas about where he wanted to take the group, and it was not in the direction I wished to go.Â He told me that my work would never be important and that I should work on what he told me was exciting.Â Tony had a postdoctoral fellow who was a former student who had followed him to Seattle, Steve Barr.Â Steve Barr and I became very good friends, and I remember one time walking home from work with Steve we talked about recurring dreams.Â We discovered we both had the same one:Â we both had independently dreamed we had murdered Tony.Â\n\nSteve Barr is now on the faculty of the Bartol Institute of the University of Delaware.Â He has written some very deep books on the relationship between science and religion. I remember him as a very serious young man, who was taken at midnight once a week by his soon-to-be wife, Kathy, to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.Â\n\nIn fairness to Tony, the feeling that I was going in the wrong direction was pretty uniform within the particle theory group.Â My former advisor Lowell had an almost allergic reaction to anything associated with nuclear physics, and he has consistently had very little interest in any of the problems on which I have chosen to work.Â Marshall Baker was supportive throughout, but felt that for my own good it might be best if I moved on.Â Marshall was right.Â\n\nI had a discussion with David BoulwareÂ about these issues of 25 years ago recently when I was visiting Seattle. David had vocally opposed my promotion.Â David was a member of the particle theory group at that time and is presently chair of the physics department. I volunteered to him that one of the few good things about age is that it lets you see things from multiple perspectives.Â It was clear I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nI should also say thatÂ Lowell and I remained on a friendly basis.Â After that time in Seattle, we would meet in Aspen and ride bikes together.Â I helped organize his 70th birthday celebration in Santa Fe.Â\n\nI remember once after a seminar in which a colleague, Genya Levin, had asked many questions and after each oneÂ was answered with a clever joke which made Genya look not so clever.Â After the seminarÂ he told me in a loud and angry voice, âThis was not fair.Â He did not answer my questions.âÂ A young theorist, Yuri Kovchegov, came over and said, âGenya, there is an old Russian saying:Â Donât shake your fist after the fight is over.â\n\nIn spite of the negative signals I was getting, I decided to request to be considered for tenure.Â Larry Wilets was chair of the committee, with Mike Schick and Vlad Chaloupka the members.Â They considered the case, and recommended for tenure, which was approved by the department over the objectionsÂ of most members ofÂ my group.Â The recommendation was then forwarded to the University where it was subsequently approved.Â Â I owe much to the three people on the committee, and to the members of the department who supported me.Â Ernie Henley, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at that time,Â was also very helpful.\n\nThe approval by the department took place while I was in China.Â My friends Gao Chong Shou and Huang Tao had arranged for me to attend a workshop run by Liu Lian Shou in Wuhan.Â I was to visit\n\nPeking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, Fudan University in Shanghai, and universities in Canton and Hangzhou.Â I was able to support the trip because of a Sloan Foundation Fellowship which I had recently received\n\nI first crossed the border to Canton.Â I was surprised to see the bicycles filling every street, andÂ whole families sharing a single bike.Â I gave a lecture and we went out to dinner.Â The physicists would mix their beer with orange pop.Â I then went to Guilin where I was alone for a few days, toured the magnificent rock formations, and took a boat down the Li river.Â\n\nI took a train from Guilin to Wuhan.Â I was the only westerner on the train.Â I shared a compartment for some time with a high officer in the Peopleâs Army, but after a few hours, he found he could shift to a compartment by himself.Â When I arrived in the morning at the Wuhan train depot, about a thousand people got offÂ the train.Â I started looking around for my friends from the meeting and I did not see them.Â After about an hour almost everyone had left.Â A young lady in a blue Mao pant suit came up to me and gestured to me to follow her.Â I followed her to her car.Â She then made gestures indicating she needed to know where I wanted to go.Â By this time I knew she was a sort of taxi driver.Â I pulled out my invitation to the meeting which had some Chinese characters on it.Â She picked itÂ up, looked at it, rotated it, looked at it again, went and talked to some people, came back and looked very confused. Then she motioned that I should get in the car, and away we droveÂ in her aging Shanghai.Â We drove for about forty minutes, and came to a large gate.Â She got out of the car with a big smile on her face, which was replaced by complete confusion after talking with some people who looked equally confused.Â After returning to the car and sitting very quiet for a few minutes, she started the car, and we came to another gate, and the whole experience repeated itself.Â As she was going back to the car, a woman came running out of the gate.Â They began to talk in loud voices, and soon both had huge smiles on their faces. The woman at the gate led the car up to a building on the university campus, went inside and brought out a smiling Liu Lian Shou, the meeting organizer.Â His wife was going shopping when the car arrived at the gate.Â There had been confusion about my arrival.Â My friends had gone to the train depot the day before, had not seen me, and assumed I was somehow not coming to the meeting.\n\nA few minutes later, I was taken to the lecture hall and began the first of eleven lectures.Â This was the first meeting on problems of matter at very high energy density held in China.Â Now there are several large groupsÂ from China working at BNL and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Cern.Â There are some very good theorists.Â At that time it was all new, and my American style English was difficult to follow as well.Â I eventually wrote up all eleven lectures, and they were distributed in China for some time, serving as an introduction to the field.\n\nUpon arrival in Moscow,Â we were met at the train, and driven on a tour of the city. We went by the Lubyanka, which is the KGB headquarters in Moscow, and were given much the same speech as in St. Petersburg.Â We were also driven by the famous apartment building in Moscow which housed party members during Stalinâs era, and told the horror stories of police in the middle of the night, a forced march to one of the monasteries which ring Moscow, and eventual imprisonment and often death in Siberia.Â\n\nWe were housed in the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP) apartment in Profsoyuznaya Square.Â I learned to use the metro, which was about the only thing that worked well in the Soviet era.Â It was fast and efficient.Â Rumors were that Stalin had shot drivers of late trains.\n\nThe ITEP guest house had radios everywhere.Â There was even one in the bathroom.Â On the last day of our stay,Â I was talking with Alice asking her if we had enough cash to pay for the apartment.Â A few minutes after I said this, there was knocking on the door, and the landlady came in asking for payment.\n\nShe was probably listening to the radio.\n\nThe first night we were there, we went looking for a place to eat.Â This was always a problem in Russia.Â The restaurants were run by the state, and the waiters and cooks all received a guaranteed salary.Â Food was also scarce, and so when a restaurant got a supply of food, the employees likely would take a fair amount, leaving little to be served.Â The manager of a restaurant might minimize all difficulties by serving no customers.Â However, if no customers were served for a long time, the restaurant might close, and although jobs might be permanent, the next one might not be as easy.\n\nWe were standing in front of a restaurant feeling frustrated and confused (most tables seemed to be empty, but we had just been told they were all reserved) when Karin ter Martiroysian, from ITEP, saw us.Â He got us inside, ordered for us, and left.Â After about a half an hour, a pleasant waitress with no English came to our table, and tried to explain something to us in Russian.Â It was apparent that they no longer had what Karin had ordered for us.Â We could not understand what she tried to communicate she could offer us instead, as I knew almost no Russian at that time.Â Finally, embarrassed but desperate to help us understand, she lifted her elbows and flapped them, and with blushing managed a very communicative, âCawROK-rok-rok!.â Chicken!Â Up until that point, thoseÂ in the restaurant had seemed very quiet and ill at ease with Americans there, broke into laughter. One fellow introduced himself, and said he spoke a little English.Â He ended up joining our table, and the evening became a pleasant and sociable one..\n\nThe last time I was in Moscow, my friend Yuri Makeenko insisted that we go to the Last Soviet Restaurant in Moscow.Â We arrived at the door, and they would not let us in.Â There was a wedding taking place.Â After negotiating for some time, the owner let us into a little table hidden under a stairwell.Â They brought us a huge menu, which just like the old Soviet menu which had all possible foods and wines.Â When they came to take our order, they (again, just as in Soviet times!) had nothing of what we had chosen.Â However, the waiter said they had a couple of meat dishes,Â he had a good Georgian wine,Â a good bottle of vodka, and even a little black caviar.Â Strangely enough, in the old days, restaurants would sometimes have nothing but caviar, champagne, vodka, bread and butter.Â You can do worse.Â I settled into the restaurant feeling like I had stepped back in time 15 years, and felt at home.\n\nI met people truly outstanding for their science and human values while at ITEP.Â Some wereÂ senior people like Karin ter Martiroysian, Lev Okun, Boris Ioffe and Yuri Simenov.Â Â Many of the young people have become my colleagues and I have spent many days and nights talkingÂ with them about physics, politics and literature:Â People like Yuri Makeenko, Misha Polikarpov, Misha Voloshin, Arkady Vainshtein, Sasha Dolgov and Vitya Novikov.Â Â Alice and I remember going to the Tretyakov Gallery with Misha Polykarpov.Â There were truly wonderful icons by the great Russian painter Andrei Rublev.Â A few rooms further on, there was the Socialist Realism painting.Â I was intrigued by the starkness, and lack of human feeling in the art.Â It was cold and mechanical, and I was fascinated the ugliness of it.Â Alice simply dislikedÂ what she saw, and she and Misha Polykarpov almost raced through the gallery, and waited for me outside.Â Alice reported that when she remarked on how the art reminded her of the unrealistic ending of âSpartacus,â the ballet we had seen the previous evening,Â Misha Polikarpov turned to her and said quietly, âAlice, you are in Wonderland .â\n\nWhen you left Russia by train, there was a little train depot on the Finnish side of the border.Â They had a snack bar, and you could buy good cold Finnish beer.Â There were sausages being fried in the open air, and all manner of fruit on the shelves.Â I have always loved Finland very much, but perhaps not so much as those first few times I was leaving Russia.Â I also enjoy Russia and Russians very much, but in that era it was a hard adventure, and the arrival in Finland felt like a warm shower after a longÂ and exhausting backpacking trip.\n\nUpon arrival at Fermilab, we bought a house in Batavia, Illinois, about 3-4 miles from the laboratory.Â It was a former parsonage, and was in pretty good condition.Â It had beautiful wooden floors and high ceilings.Â We planted cherry trees in a portion of the lot.\n\nConditions at the lab were truly phenomenal.Â There were two theoretical physics groups.Â I was in the group run by Chris Quigg in particle theory, and there was another group founded by Dave Schramm\n\nand managed jointly by Rocky Kolb and Mike Turner on particle astrophysics.Â The theorists were all people of great depth and accomplishment without the personal eccentricities that plague so many groups of talented and creative people.Â Everyone talked with everyone else, and people genuinely enjoyed one anotherâs company.Â There was true intellectual excitement not only about new ideas in theoretical physics, but also new experimental results from the lab and elsewhere.Â There was also a fusing of ideas from particle physics and field theory with astrophysics and cosmology.\n\nI would ride my bike to the lab during the summer, spring and early fall.Â I remember being locked out of the central office building once when I arrived in the middle of a tornado drill.Â Others, it seemed, were at the same time locked in.Â I discovered this was a government safety regulation.Â\n\nIn the winter, there was cross country skiing on the lab site.Â The lab site at Fermilab has restored the prairie grass inside the main accelerator ring.Â The lab originally planned to haveÂ buffalo grazing there, but the buffalo loved the most exotic and rare of the prairie grasses planted there at great effort by volunteers.Â They were moved to another area, where their fine taste in food caused less trouble..Â Excess buffalo would be sold off at a yearly auction.Â At one such sale, a bull buffalo escaped.Â He made it all the way to the Fox Valley Mall, many miles away, enjoying his hard earned freedom with a carefree stroll through suburban neighborhoods, before being tranquilized by a lineup of Illinois State and local police.\n\nThere were ponds near the central office building for the lab, the High Rise, where warm water from the magnets in the accelerator was allowed to cool.Â Geese flying south in late fall would look down at the unfrozen ponds, and decide to fly no further.Â By midwinter, the ponds were closely packed with geese whose collective motion resembled an ice floe. We heard thatÂ the lab would quietly collect geese in the middle of the night, using helicopters and nets, and take them off in a truck to Southern Illinois. They monitored the geese and found that in a few days they would return to Fermilab.Â\n\nI was active in the discussions concerning the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at BNL, and a member of the RHIC Policy Advisory Committee at BNL.Â I also participated in the workshop where the first plans for detectors were drafted.Â I wrote many papers on the phenomena which might be expected from RHIC collisions.Â I developed fluid dynamical models of the collisions with Henrique von Gersdorff and Vesa Ruuskanen, Keijo Kajantie and their groups.\n\nPeter Arnold and I worked out details of electroweak baryon number violation, which is described in the Physics section of this webpage.Â Working with someone who has a mind as original and creative as Peterâs is exciting.Â Peter takes an incomplete and poorly thought out idea, reduces it to its most simple form, and then finds a simple mathematical abstraction of it from which he can test its validity.Â Sometimes this leads to a reformulation of the basic concepts, and then a partial or complete solution.\n\nIn 1984, I went to a meeting in Bad Honnef, Germany where I met Edward Shuryak and Evgenii Feinberg.Â Â Richard Wiener organized this wonderful meeting, and through his understanding ofÂ the Soviet scientific bureaucracy, enabled these two outstanding Soviet scientists to attend. Evgenii was a senior and distinguished theoretical physicist from the Lebedev Institute in Moscow.Â This is the institute of Andrei Sakharov.Â Evgenii was a tall man, grey haired and soft spoken, who was proud of his resemblance to Ronald Reagan.Â There is a reminiscence of him in the Anecdotes section.Â Evgenii had thought very hard about fluid dynamical descriptions of particle collisions, and I learned much from his reflections on entropy production.Â\n\nWe also got into a conversation on ESP.Â I had heard the Russians were seriously testing the idea, and asked him if it was so.Â He said yes they were, and they had reproduced all of the exciting results which we had in the US.Â This was Evgeniiâs way of saying there was no reproducible effect.\n\nI knew Edward earlier from his work on strongly interacting matter at very high temperature.Â We spent much time discussing one anotherâs ideas, and became very good friends,Â Edward is very fast, and you do not have to explain details.Â He is very creative, but most importantly he is obsessive.Â Most of my good friends are obsessed to a certain extent by ideas, paradox and paradigms, but Edward is far in the tail of the distribution.Â With Edward, I would have unending excited conversations.\n\nIn April of 1986, I was to attend a meeting in Kiev organized by Genya Zinoviev.Â I had met Genya through my colleague Helmut Satz who organized a number of influential meetings at the Center for Interdisciplinary Study in Bielefeld, Germany.Â By this time, Helmut and I had becomeÂ very good friends, both through talking with one another at various scientific meetings, and hiking and skiing in the mountains.Â Helmut is very intense; he expresses himself clearly and simply.Â He did some of the earliest and best work on the numerical solutions to strongly interacting theories of matter at very high energy density.Â He also did seminal work on the experimental consequences of such matter for high energy collisions of nuclei.\n\nGenya was Helmutâs good friend, and was trying to buildÂ a group similar to Helmutâs that would work on the properties of high energy density matterÂ at theÂ Academy of Sciences Institute in Kiev.Â Genya had access to ample resources, since one of the founders of his group was well connected to the high party leadership of the Ukraine.\n\nI had planned to stay a week in Leningrad before going to Kiev, but before we reachedÂ Leningrad,\n\nChernobyl blew up.Â Â Apparently, the scientists in the Leningrad Nuclear Physics Institute discovered the Chernobyl explosion before it was public knowledge.Â Some of them were goingÂ into work and upon entering the reactors, the radiation detectors went off.Â These detectors are placed there to go off if you have been unknowingly dosed with radiation while at work and are leaving the reactor.Â They were quite surprised that they had set them off on entering.Â Upon testing themselves with different detectors, they verified that they indeed were hot.Â This of course scared the hell out of them, since there were a number of reactors in the Leningrad area and the Soviet government had never been particularly forthcoming about catastrophic events.\n\nWhile in Leningrad, Alice and I were encouraged to go to the meeting in Kiev.Â We were told there was no problem getting there and no real safety hazard in Kiev.Â Both of these things were true.Â A more realÂ problem, however, was that the meager public transportation system of the Ukraine was crumbling under the pressure of terrified crowds mobbing train depots and airports.Â One could go to Kiev but not leave. It was also not clear at that time, nor even now for that matter, how things would eventually settle in Chernobyl.\n\nI visited Kiev several years later where Genya Zinoviev was my host, and was introduced to Kirill Bugaev and Yuri Sinyakov.Â Genya had by then built a successful group in Kiev, and is now a central figure in the involvement of Ukraine with the CERN experimental program.Â While in Kiev then, I visited the war memorial where there is a huge dome, and inside the dome are given the names of war heroes.Â Brezhnev had once been high on the list of names displayed there, but had fallen in place on the list after his death.Â Â I learned during that visit about Bulgakov, aboutÂ the bitter fighting in the Ukraine during the Russian Resolution, and the starvation there during the collectivization of the farms.Â The pattern was that Communist Party bureaucrats would go into an area to collect grain.Â They would be rewarded for exceeding the quotasÂ that they had set for their areas, since the excess was interpreted as successful increase in productivity.Â But the next yearâs quota would then need to reflect this assumption ofÂ increased productivity, and be higher than that of the prior year.Â The result was that the farmers and their families would starve to death.Â But the Communist Party bureaucrats did not care, since farmers were land owners, and therefore enemies of the people.Â This pattern was taught to the Chinese, and later with some variation to that most respected and illustrious alumnus of the Sorbonne, Pol Pot.Â Pol Pot, to his credit, understood that the educated were more of a threat to his ideology than the peasants, so he systematically liquidated them as well.\n\nOnce while in Russia, after I had learned to speak a little Russian, I met the father of a well known physicist at a dinner party.Â It was late and we all had a lot to drink, but I started talking with the old fellow.Â He was a party member, so I asked him how he could defend the slaughter of tens of millions of people in the Ukraine and in the Gulags.Â He answered me honestly:Â These people were enemies of the people.Â There was class warfare.Â In war, you kill the enemy.\n\nI should be careful here, because some of my friends to this day remain Communists.Â They are not evil people, nor do I disagree with all that they say.Â Many of these friends I respect very much for their idealism,Â Their conception of a better world is certainly not that of a Stalinist, a Red Guard or a Khmer Rouge.\n\nDuring the visit to Kiev, Genya took me to visit an old broken down house on the site of his institute.Â It had the architectural style of a California ranch house.Â There were the remains of a swimming pool. I was told thatÂ after the famous physicist Dirac retired under mandatory retirement laws in Britain, he was being recruited for a position in Kiev, and the house was part of the deal.Â Dirac eventually accepted a position at an American University.\n\nSeveral months later, I returned to Russia as part of a DOE delegation to visit Soviet laboratories.Â We visited, Novosibirsk, Dubna, the Lebedev Institute the Kurchatov Institute, ITEP, and the Institute for Nuclear Research.Â Â Alice and I would stay with the delegation during the day, and at night would visit with friends late into the night.Â I think the purpose of the delegation was to exploit the rapidly warming relations with the Soviet Union by first understanding what the various labs do, and then trying to develop programs of mutual interest.Â I remember after visiting a reactor complex in Dubna, Dave Hendrie, the leader of the delegation insisted we all wash our hands.Â We saw a number of laser laboratories,Â suggesting that they had the same interest in high powered lasers that we had in the US.Â At the Kurchatov Institute, they still had proudly displayed in their meeting room pictures of the reactor at Chernobyl, a reactor that their lab had designed and built.\n\nDuring this trip, there was a young man assigned to us who I assumed had direct connections to the KGB.Â Alice was at that time was trying to reach a Russian author, Natalia Romanava to see if there had been a decision in Moscow regarding publication of her book in Russian translation.Â At one point, with members of the delegation preparing to go somewhere, and Alice was still trying to reach her friend as this fellow was in our room, waiting impatiently for us to join the others.Â After she had tried unsuccessfully several times, he walked across the room, took the phone, and dialed the number.Â He had determined and memorized the number while listening toÂ Alice dial from across the room.Â I was impressed.Â He also successfully made the call.\n\nI met Evgenii Feinberg in Moscow.Â I took him to the only open restaurant in our hotel, one that had a band playing loud music.Â The only food was champagne, buckets of black caviar, brown bread and butter.\n\nAlice and I had a wonderful time seeing our friends during this visit.Â Â Â The problem with delegations is however that delegations are stigmatizedÂ by the behavior of most boorish of the lot.Â One person would not stand when the famous academician Cherenkov, then 70 years old, came to visit with us.Â Â Â At restaurants, some members of the delegation were indignant when the restaurant did not have everything listed on the menu.Â I guess after this trip I figured I had been there and done that.Â No more delegations for me.\n\nI made several other trips to the Soviet Union during the time at Fermilab.Â In 1987, I went to Tashkent in Uzbekhistan for the Multiparticle Conference.Â Uzbekhistan is part of Middle Asia, but there happens to be a significant Korean minority in Tashkent, deported there byÂ Stalin deportedÂ during the war.\n\nDuring this meeting, my friend Genya Zinoviev suggested we go off for a few days to the countryside and stay in the mountains with Kazaks.Â He said he had a friend with a car.Â Years later, when telling this story with Genya present,Â a colleague asked Genya the name of this friend.Â Genya laughed in an embarrassed way and did not answer.Â I was told to take the key to the hotel with me since then the hotel staff would not know that I had left.Â This was not very plausible, but I wanted to see the mountains and the Kazaks, so I followed instructions.Â I figured this whole expedition had been approved by the local authorities.Â\n\nWe drove through huge wide valleys full of sheep.Â At this time, there was an anti-alcohol campaign under way, and we wanted to find some vodka, so we drove around one city until we saw a huge line.Â We stopped, stood in line for an hour or so, and bought a bottle.Â\n\nWhen we got toÂ the mountains we found the Kazaks, and settled into a Kazak tent for the night.Â The next morning we went swimming in a crystal clear mountain stream that had formed pot holes in a little valley about 3-4 meters below the surface of the land.Â I jumped in first and as I hit the water, I discovered the temperature was close to freezing.Â I knew that if I screamed Genya would not jump in, so I shut my mouth, went under the water, and when I came back up yelled with feigned delight, âGenya, Genya, the water is so warm.âÂ Genya then jumped in,Â When he hit the water he felt no need to restrain himself, and let out a roar that echoed several times off the nearby mountains.Â\n\nI have always liked Genya very much.Â Â He is a very tall man, generally quiet in disposition.Â I remember one time when he visited the University of Minnesota, he saw a squirrel, and said in a very loud voice, âOh, little squirrel, if I had any nuts I would give them to you,â amusing some nearby young women.Â Â Â I had to explain to him that nuts were to Americans what eggs were to Russians.Â Yes, there is a double meaning to Leninâs famous quote:Â âTo make an omelet, you have to break eggs.â\n\nWhile with the Kazaks we drank fresh kumiss --Â fermented maresâ milk, the favorite drink of Genghiz Khan.Â The Kazaks were shepherds and expert horsemen.Â When on a horse, the rider would merge with the horseâs identity, and one felt there was a single living organism moving.\n\nWe also went on an excursion with the meeting to Samarkand.Â As we walked through the city,Â myÂ Israeli friend Uri Maor discovered a group of Jews who had lived in the area for centuries.Â They were walking down the street speaking Hebrew.Â Uri followed after them and spent much of a day talking with them.Â In Samarkand, we visited the tomb of the great Khan Tamerlane.Â I was told a story about how a city in his empire had rebelled.Â He conquered the city and killed every living thing.Â He took the skulls of the people, crushed them to make mortar, and used the mortar to build the dome of a huge mosque.Â\n\nOn the trip to Samarkand, I met a Libyan physicist.Â He made a point of sitting with me at lunch, and we began talking.Â At that time. Ronald Reagan had recently bombed Tripoli.Â I asked him if there was much damage.Â He said no, that a big deal of it was made in the press, but in fact the bombs had been very accurate. There was little damage to the areas surrounding the intended targets.Â He was frank and honest, much like my Russian friends.Â\n\nOn a later visit to the Soviet Union, I went for a joint meeting of American and Soviet scientists on the slopes of Mount Aragats in Armenia.Â It was held in a guest house for cosmic ray experimenters that had been built on the mountain.Â Alice and I would go on afternoon hikes, and the photo above shows me and Andrei Smilga trapped during a thunderstorm.Â I made friends with George Saviddy, Iosif Khriplovich, Misha Shaposhnikov and Valery Rubakov.Â George knew all the mountain herbs and while walking would pick them and pass them around to taste.Â I was interested in the work Valery and Misha had done on electroweak baryon number violation.Â With Valery and Mitya Diakanov, we climbed to the snow covered top of Mount Aragats.Â To get to the starting point, we needed a taxi, and the organizer of the meeting wanted to block our trip.Â Valery very cleverly had arranged the taxi from a nearby village, not the one in which we stayed.Â Valery has always had great administrative skill.Â I discovered when I returned to the US, I had climbed Aragats with a hand broken in a fall a few days earlier while hiking with Iosif Khriplovich.Â From the top of the mountain, you could see Mount Ararat in Turkey, and a famous Soviet radar base, supposedly where they began tracking the U2 pilot Gary Powers as he entered Soviet airspace.Â Â\n\nOn one visit to Armenia, we were driving down the highway with friends, and we saw large groups of sheep sitting by the roadway.Â The sheep were listless and looked depressed.Â We stopped near one group of sheep and while looking at the herd, a man drove up, paid the owner of the sheep some money, grabbed the sheep he wanted by the neck, and put him in the trunk of his car.Â We learned that it was a religious holiday, and the sheep were being taken to be sacrificed.Â The sheep somehow seemed to sense what was going to happen -- but there was not much they could do about it other than to lie by the side of the road being depressed.\n\nI was also developing many friendships in Eastern Europe.Â I began attending the Crakow School of Physics in Zakopane Poland.Â This school was founded by Andrzej Bialas and colleagues during the early 1960s.Â In my opinion, for many years this was the top school of theoretical particle physics anywhere.Â It brought people together from all of Europe, the Soviet Union and America.Â There was a good mix of student nationalities, together with a large number of young Polish theorists.Â The first meeting I attended was after the fall of Solidarity, and some American scientists were boycotting Poland.Â IÂ believe that boycotts do only harm to the people you want to support most.Â In Communist countries, the scientists were among the most liberal and enlightened of the intelligentsia, and as such were the ones who were agitating for change.Â\n\nDuring our first Zakopane meeting, Alice would go to food stores and find they had absolutely nothing for sale.Â Somehow the organizers could find beer, and create delicious and filling soups with almost no meat at all.Â Zakopane has now gone the way of many other beautiful mountain towns:Â It is full of new shops catering to tourists and junk food chains.Â The mountains remain beautiful, with unspoiled alpine meadows.Â You can read more about Zakopane in both the Anecdotes section on Andrzej Bialas and in the section on Alice.\n\nDuring this first meeting I met the young Atsushi Nakamura, who is now at Hiroshima University.Â I was struck by how much he appreciated of Polish culture, and how he had visited many museums.Â Nakamura was also very direct in his discussion of physics and I have always found him to be a good friend with a wide appreciation of science, art and culture.Â He now plays a pan pipe, and is well known for this in Japan.Â Below is Atsushi improvising on the pan pipe together with Polish fiddlers at a Zakopane meeting held around 2006.Â Alice and I would hear this beautiful music drifting through the corridors of our hotel during that meeting, and it took a few days to discover its origin.\n\nI made a number of visits to Hungary and East Germany.Â In Hungary, I got to know the senior person in my area, Zimanyi, and attended a meeting at Lake Balaton.Â I learned to wind surf with a couple of East Germans.Â I was subsequently invited to a meeting in Georgenthal, East Germany, run by Gisella and Johannes Ranft.Â The Ranfts were true believers.Â Johannes had been working in a factory, when the party decided educate him, and he eventually ended up as the senior theoretical physicist at the Karl Marx University in LeipzigÂ Â He owed much of hisÂ academic career to the Party.Â Â He built a group of young theoretical physicists.Â\n\nI arrived by train and remember the harsh East German border guards who checked under train seats and unscrewed every light bulb.Â I never understood what they were looking for.\n\nIn Georgenthal, I would run in the morning, and return to the basement to shower.Â There was no hot water and it was winter. There were others âshoweringâ by cupping water, then patting it on their bodies, swearing in several languages about the the cold.Â I visited Wiemar and while walking the streets, huge clouds of blue coal smoke would descend on me and itÂ was difficult to breathe.Â I went out for a walk by myself one day in Georgenthal, and the Ranfts were scandalized; I Iearned I was not supposed to walk by myself, but should always be accompanied by an East German.\n\nMisha Ilgenfritz was responsible for me on this first visit.Â Misha was also a true believer; he actually emigrated from West Germany to the East.Â He had a Trabant automobile, and he must hold the worldâs land speed record for such a class of vehicle.Â It has an engine little larger than that of a lawnmower, and yet he got busted with me while driving 3 kilometers per hour faster than the speed limit on the East German Autobahn.Â I think the East German traffic cop was in a state of awe about how fast he got the car going.Â We must have been going downhill.\n\nAlice and I went together to an international conference on high energy physics in Leipzig a few years later.Â On the train there, she shared a banana with aÂ little boy who was sharing our compartment, upsetting the childâs grandmother, who I think was angry that the grandmother in her (who wanted the boy to taste a fruit unavailable in his town) had prevailed over the Good East German who wanted him to feel he should reject such decadent luxuries offered by Americans.\n\nIn Leipzig, we went out to dinner at the Ratskeller which is the restaurant where Faust is said to have made his bargain with the devil.Â Since most East Germans tended to avoid us, we were surprised when we were joined at our table by an elderly German couple.Â Alice spoke enough German to understand that they had come from many miles away so they could meet some of theÂ foreigners who were in town for the meeting.Â They said they were so old that they were not frightened of the Stasi, and wanted to learn more about the world they knew existed beyond their borders.\n\nThere was a conference banquet which must have taken the food from all of the markets near Leipzig.Â Yet it was not enough.Â The table on which the food was placed was mobbed.Â I heard a rumor that one person was standing near the table, he felt something moving between his legs, and saw a hand rising, which grabbed some food from the table.Â He later saw the person crawling away.Â Later there was champagne and beer, and I amused myself with my Polish and East German friends by seeing if we could supply ourselves with enough champagne to last the evening.Â Â (For some reason,Â the Soviet Union made a lot of champagne, and the satellite states could balance their trade by buying nuclear reactors and champagne.)Â By developing friendly relations with the waiters, we succeeded. We were so successful that a very senior and famous Russian scientist joined our table, and he got so drunk that he told us his true feeling about Sakharov and Bonner --Â and I was shocked by them.Â I thought they were universally admired within the physics community.Â\n\nMy good friend Steve Barr (from the University of Washington Seattle days) was at the meeting on a honeymoon with his wife Kathy.Â I warned him to be careful what he said in his room since it was probably monitored.Â (My warning was about saying things political or about people.) He turned pale, and I found that he checked out of his hotel and left the country the next day.Â I should have been more careful in breaking him the news, but I thought he should know.\n\nÂ\n\nThe last time I was in East Germany was a few weeks before the Berlin Wall fell.Â My East German friends were excited about the changes, and were attending nighttime vigils sponsored by some members of the Lutheran Church.Â I was able to obtain a propaganda poster I had long coveted, which in the past no-one would dare buy for me.Â We went to Johannesâs home in the countryside on the weekend -- converted to a residence from an old mill, I think 13th century.Â His wife Gisella had died a short time before. We got a late start returning home.Â Johannes cannot see very well and was a beginning driver, and with the light fading he asked me if I would drive.Â The first time I drove in Europe was when I took Johannes back home.Â\n\nI remember how shocked I was by East Germany.Â In the west, it was portrayed as the economic power house of the East Bloc.Â I think none of theÂ people who wrote this nonsense had ever been to East Germany.Â True they had many chemical plants.Â These plants spewed toxic chemicals into the air, and the fumes would corrode the paint on my friendsâ cars.Â There were a lot of sick kids, and unexplained allergies.Â The factories were rusted and outdated.\n\nI remember one night at a friendâs house, Alice asked the wife of an East German physicist what she would most like to do.Â She was a teacher of Communist Philosophy at the local gymnasium.Â She replied she would like to travel.Â Alice asked where and she said a third world country.Â Alice asked what she would do there.Â She answered, âTeach Communist Philosophy, of course.â\n\nAfter the wall fell, most of my East German colleagues lost their positions.Â Their jobs were taken by the surrogates of powerful West German professors, eager to purge the system of the Communists.Â It was a nasty business, for along with some really bad people, someÂ good ones lost everything. Most of the people had a mixture of weakness and courage, like people everywhere.Â I honestly do not believe that many of my American friends would have done better under similar circumstances.\n\nDuring our time at Fermilab, we entertained a number of visitors from Russia.Â Some of these experiences are described in the Anecdote concerning Volodya Gribov, and some in the section Alice, concerning the Russian experimental delegation and the trip we arranged for them to Aspen.Â During this time, I would regularly go to the Aspen Center for Physics.Â I was a member of the Board of Trustees there.Â I was also on numerous national committees associated with programs at laboratories, proposals for centers and many other things.\n\nIn 1986,Â I met Bikash Sinha at the Quark Matter meeting in Asilomar, California.Â Â I knew Bikash before through his work on electromagnetic signatures for the Quark Gluon Plasma.Â I was impressed by this work because it was of high quality yetÂ came from an institution with no previous history of interest in this type of physics.Â When I met Bikash, we had a number of long talks about physics, and he asked me to help with his plans to hold a meeting in winter of 1988, the International Conference on the Physics and Astrophysics of the Quark Gluon Plasma (ICPAQGP) in Mumbai, and a school in Jaipur.Â Together with Gaurang Yodh, we got funding for travel expenses for a number of American physicists through the Indian rupee foreign currency fund.Â\n\nI knew Gaurang from a previous visit to India to attend the International Cosmic Ray Conference. Gaurang had organized the funding for that meeting.Â I had really liked India from that earlier visit.Â In the evening, I would rent a motor rickshaw and be driven around the city of Bangalore for an hour or so.Â The chaotic traffic, the noise of the rickshaw engine and the smells of auto exhaust somehow relaxed me and gave me time to think.Â I had gone on a tour for 2 days, and one night had been in a garden which was illuminated with colored lights, there was jasmine and marijuana in the air and beautiful Indian women in their colorful saris.Â I had seen some of the old style hotels, and experienced the charm of the families which ran them.Â I had also visited Mumbai to visit colleagues, particularly Bisharu Banerjee and Rajiv Gavai, at the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR).Â The TIFR is one of the top research institutes in asia. I stayed at the YWCA, and spent evening watching Bollywood movies, and although not understanding Hindi, understood very well the plots, which were parallel to the cowboy westerns of my childhood, but with more singing and dancing.\n\nIt was not all romantic and nice however.Â I remember seeing one little girl of about 10 years in the parking lot of the Red Fort in New Delhi.Â She was begging for money and begged to me in four different languages.Â I thought that in any reasonable society she would be a young lady with a bright future, but for her there was little hope.Â Life in India has improved dramatically over the 25 years I have gone there, and with time one hopes that there will be more opportunities for its genuinely talented people.\n\nThe opportunity to help Bikash with this meeting gave me an opportunity to visit India with Alice.Â We bought a travel guide, visiting India on $10 a day, which listed old style hotels. We arrived in New Delhi in the middle of the night, and made our way to our hotel amid camel carts emerging from the smoke of fires.Â We then took a train to Agra, visited the Taj Mahal and Fatehpur Sikri.Â The hotel was modest but comfortable, and run by a family who gave us tea with milk and spices for breakfast.Â We then took a bus to Jaipur, and it was during that trip thatÂ Alice fell in love with camels during her first ride on one at a bus stop (described in the Alice section).Â We and the participants in the school stayed in the Alsisar Haveli which had a private garden with peacocks.Â\n\nWe later ended up in Mumbai, and stayed in the Tata Institute guest house.Â Our Russian friends, Mitya Diakonov, Edward Shuryak and Genya Zinoviev also stayed there.Â They had a memorable trip back.Â In New Delhi, they took a taxi to the airport, and the taxi driver asked them what they did.Â When they answered physics, the taxi driver said, âOh, were you at that meeting about Quark Matter in Jaipur?â\n\nThey have never since underestimated the renown of Bikash Sinha.\n\nBikash has phenomenal accomplishments in Indian science.Â He spearheaded a major effort of Indian\n\nexperimental science at the CERN SPS, RHIC and the LHC.Â These are efforts involving resources\n\nnear a hundred million dollars and the efforts of hundreds of physicists.Â Â Such things were not easy to accomplish in a developing economy.\n\nAlice and I came back to Jaipur several years later for another meeting organized by Bikash.Â We stayed in the Narain Niswas hotel, which is an old palace.Â We had a beautiful room with painted wall and ceilings.Â We organized an afternoon to ride camels in the countryside.Â On the way back, the owner of the hotel arranged admittance for us and our friends into a polo match -- and somehow got us into the VIP box.Â The Maharajah of Kashmir was there, and the man behind me, who kindly filled me in on all the subtle points of polo,Â eventually became a defense minister of India.Â As we were leaving, I thanked him for being so helpful.Â âDonât mention it,â he said in his perfect Oxford accent.Â âI quite enjoyed our little natter!â\n\nIn our hotel, the first night we heard a lot of noise on the roof.Â It sounded like people bowling.Â A few days later, while having a drink as the sun set, we watched families of monkeys climb trees near our room, and then land on the roof.Â It seems they went up there to play cricket during the night.Â\n\nI was traveling more and more, and it was becoming more difficult for Alice.Â Alice does not drive, and when I would leave her for a trip she was very isolated and lonely in Batavia, Illinois.Â I began to seriously think of leaving for more urban surroundings.Â I got offers for positions as a full professor at the University of Minnesota and a verbal offer for a joint position at Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stony Brook University.Â Alice visitedÂ Long Island, and found there were only two towns, Bellport and Port Jefferson, in which she could survive as a non-driver; the others offered no core of essential shopping and services within their commercial districts.Â Â The housing costs were too high at that time to buy a house similar to that we had in Illinois with the salary they offered me.Â In addition, there was no commitment on the part of the lab management to build the type of theoretical physics group needed to address the issues associated with the proposed Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.Â I accepted the position in Minnesota, and moved there in the fall of 1988.\n\nA picture of me with Andreas Ringwald shown in the picture above on the right was taken at a meeting in Telavi, Georgia.Â The meeting was a very interesting one.Â The issue of whether or not one produced spectacular events in high energy collisions of weakly interacting particles was hotly contested, and almost everyone working on the problems was there.Â In the night, after the regular meeting, we would sometimes hold discussions in the cellar of the hotel.Â There would be much Georgian wine and Scotch Whiskey.Â The discussion would sometimes be very agitated, but all done in good spirit.\n\nOften very late at night, I would gather together with my good friends Sasha Dolgov, Iosif Khriplovich, Victor Novikov and Andrei Smilga, and a young British physicist, Caroline Frasier, and we would drink Georgian wine and Armenian cognac talking of things political, scientific, and cultural.Â I think the Russian guys were trying to get Caroline drunk, but they were never successful.Â They however were less than sober by the end of the evening.Â The last night of the meeting, we had a particularly long discussion.Â It ended with Andrei Smilga deciding he wanted to go mountain climbing, so in the middle of the night he left the hotel walking in the general direction of the mountains.Â These mountains are about 100 kilometers distant from Telavi.Â By morning, he found himself in someoneâs orchard on the edge of the city, being challenged by a man with a gun.Â Andrei got upset by this and reported the guy to the police.Â They all went to the station and Andrei was strongly encouraged not to make charges as doing so would result in both parties being put in jail.Â So Andrei gave up, but by that time everyone had leftÂ for their planes and trains.Â Andrei was stuck in Telavi with little money, and a ticket for a flight in Tiblisi which he could not get to on time.\n\nMeanwhile, there had been a train crash in Georgia, and all train traffic was canceled.Â On my flight leaving Tiblisi there was literallyÂ standing room only, and I remember a young German colleague praying as a dangerously overloaded plane left the ground barely gaining enough speed to make it off the runway.\n\nAndrei somehow had or got enough money so that he could call his wife and ask her to help, but by that time his friends were back in Moscow.Â Â She had found out what had happened, and would send him no money.Â I still do not know how he ever got out of Tiblisi.\n\nCaroline Frasier was a promising young theoretical physicist.Â A few years after this meeting,\n\nshe took a trip to Africa.Â Upon returning to Britain, she fell sick.Â She went to the public health service\n\ncomplaining of being very ill, but neglected to mention she had recently returned from Africa and had prematurely stopped taking her malaria medication.Â The nurse she saw, not being fully informed of the circumstances, recommended aspirin and rest. By the next morning she was dead.\n\nOne of the very good friendships I made in Russia was with Valery Rubakov. Valery developed many\n\nof the ideas associated with electroweak baryogenesis.Â I have shared many hours with him climbing on trails in the Colorado Rockies in search of wild mountain trout.Â Valery is a one of the top theoretical physicists I have met, but he is even more impressive as a human being.Â He deeply cared about the young people in Russian science. He has consistently refused offers in the West on the grounds that someone needs to remain in Russia to educate the young.Â He is painfully honest both in science and personal relations.Â He will not spare your feelings by telling you a lot of diplomatically phrased half-truths.Â His friends respect and love him for this simple honesty.\n\nDuring the time I was in Minnesota, I kept my ties with China.Â I visited China early after the unfortunate events in Beijing in 1989,Â for I did not want my Chinese friends to become isolated. As I said above, I think boycotts oftentimes damage those whose support one most needs in order to affect change.\n\nMy goal was to make arrangements so that my Chinese friends could also visit us at the Theoretical Physics Institute in Minnesota.Â I kept the visit very low key, and met only with scientists.Â I made no visits to touristic spots, nor did I attend banquets with local officials.Â\n\nAs a result of this visit, I succeeded in arranging for a number of Chinese visitors to Minnesota, including my old office-mate at SLAC, Chong-shou Gao.Â Gao remains a good friend.Â Life has changed much in China for academics.Â On my first visit, their apartments were very small, around 15-20 square meters.Â Now a professor at Peking University might have a 100 square meter apartment near the universityÂ in downtown Beijing.Â The apartments available to scientists will have modern conveniences, and there is no feeling that people are frightened of their government.Â For a young Chinese scientist of talent, it is now very attractive to return to China."
