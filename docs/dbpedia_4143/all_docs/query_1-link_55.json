As his plane flies into Chicago’s O’Hare Field from the west, he notices a large ring on the ground below (see fig. I.1). Near it he sees a towering white structure, a group of colorful smaller buildings, an expanse of forest, open fields, and lakes. “What is that ring?” he asks his neighbor. “Fermilab,” she replies. “It’s a physics laboratory. The government supports research there into what the universe is made of.” “Why the ring?” “It’s the four-mile-round main ring of a machine called the Tevatron. It turns protons into tools for looking inside the atomic nucleus. Huge magnets steer the protons around the ring, while high voltages accelerate them. When they reach their peak energy they collide with targets, sometimes other particles.Teams of physicists study the collisions as they explore the scientific frontier. Strangely, Fermilab’s site is maintained to resemble the American West as it was a century ago. There’s even a herd of buffalo!” ∗∗∗ To this hypothetical airplane conversation, intended to introduce Fermilab and its frontierlike site to a member of the public, this book adds a historical dimension and asks why and how Fermilab saw the birth of an approach we call “megascience.” We draw on the powerful frontier imagery,\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI.1\n\nThe ring of the frontier, 1972. (Courtesy of Angela Gonzales.)\n\nwhich the physicists who work at Fermilab themselves use, and form it into a conceptual tool to help us tell Fermilab’s story to a broad audience that includes historians and general readers, as well as physicists. Many writers have used the term “megascience” interchangeably with “big science,”1 to refer loosely to research supported by large sums of money, often in the form of government grants, and conducted over long time spans by large groups using large pieces of equipment.2 In this book, however, the term “megascience” has a more specific meaning distinct 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfrom what is typically called big science. In most writings “big science” refers to the large-scale research conducted in the decades following World War II, when the funding for science in the United States was widely experienced as unlimited, allowing the research to grow very rapidly, with many parameters (e.g., size, cost, numbers of collaborators, time scales) increasing exponentially. Megascience, however, as we use the term, evolved in a time when the government’s funding for science was slowing down. While many parameters still grew, they did so more slowly than in the first two postwar decades, causing dramatic changes in the nature of the research. The scholarly focus of this book is the tension intrinsic to any pioneering exploration whether it occurs in a scientific field or as part of a country’s history. Pulling the explorers forward is the call of the frontier, a force that drives them to pursue unknown territory. In experimental particle physcis, if funding allows, this call to exploration encourages experiments to grow larger, causing some of them to become long-lasting institutions in their own right, existing within their parent institutions. Resisting the call of the frontier are numerous constraints, many of them social or economic. The tension causes the exploration to take a particular form. One resisting trend is competition for limited resources at a laboratory, a counterforce that encourages the scientists to hold on to their precious investments, especially the larger ones, such as electronic detectors. Thus, the most striking feature of megascience is that its experiments seem no longer to “end,” in the sense described by the historian of science Peter Galison.3 By-products of these changes and features of megascience are paradoxes, conflicts, and ironies which, while interesting for historians to explore, are often troubling to the scientists because they threaten to undermine fundamental aspects of their research. One paradox in this story of Fermilab is that every advance toward the frontier worked to limit the focus of physicists to fewer basic problems, resulting in a narrowing of the research frontier. A prominent conflict in the Fermilab story derived from the opposition between founding director Robert R. Wilson’s ideal that science should be pursued by lone independent explorers and the reality that research into the heart of matter requires large, typically more bureaucratic, team efforts. Among many ironies in the story of Fermilab is that megascience evolved there directly out of Wilson’s vision of small-scale research. Out of such conflicting factors emerged the Fermilab of today, home to some two thousand employees (including staff physicists) and an additional two thousand five hundred “users,” physicists from many 3\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncountries who come to Illinois to work with Fermilab’s facilities. In 1967, when the laboratory was established under the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), it was called the National Accelerator Laboratory (NAL). It was renamed Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), or Fermilab, in 1974. The site of this laboratory is unusual, for the 6,800 acres of government land on which the laboratory lies was designed to evoke the western frontier of the United States. The land appears largely unaffected by recent suburban sprawl around the laboratory. Such development was anticipated in 1966 when the federal and Illinois governments ruled that NAL’s large open site would be preserved for scientific research. But while in 1967 the site consisted almost entirely of farmland, it now includes a vast restored prairie rich with native wildlife coexisting with state-ofthe-art research facilities, often housed in brightly painted buildings. One finds nineteenth-century farmhouses and barns amid imaginative sculpture and modern architecture on the site. The laboratory’s imposing seventeen-story central laboratory, Robert Rathbun Wilson Hall, the towering white structure that our imaginary airplane travelers noted, vaguely resembles a medieval cathedral in the French countryside. The four-mile circular tunnel at the heart of the site, the “ring” central to our story, is the track for the racing protons, which are given their high energy by the laboratory’s accelerator, the proton synchrotron called the Tevatron. Particle accelerators have been described as powerful microscopes, because the high-energy particles they produce can probe deeply into the nucleus, revealing its inner structure. Accelerators have also been compared to time machines, because they re-create conditions that existed in the early universe. The energized protons in the ring are indeed, as one of our travelers explained, among the physicists’ powerful tools for probing frontiers of nature. They perform a role similar to that of the spyglass, the ax, or the plow used to explore the American West. The story told in this book unfolds in three parts. Part 1 (chapters 2, 3, and 4) presents Fermilab’s prehistory, beginning in 1960, before the founding of the laboratory in 1967. During this heady period of particle physics many scientific discoveries fueled a desire to break through that era’s energy frontier of roughly 30 GeV and reach energies greater than were available then at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on Long Island, New York (33 GeV), or at the European nuclear research laboratory CERN in Geneva (28 GeV).4 (A GeV is a unit of energy. In 1960 physicists used the two energy measures of BeV [billion electron volts] and GeV [giga electron volts] interchangeably in referring to the\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nenergy achieved by an electron energized to a billion volts. While most Europeans preferred the term GeV, many Americans, including Robert R. Wilson, used BeV. As GeV had become the more popular term by the time NAL was built, we use GeV throughout this book in an effort to avoid confusion, unless the term BeV appears in a direct quote.)5 In 1960, when American physicists still enjoyed the high level of support characteristic of the postwar period, a number of groups submitted proposals for high-energy accelerators in the 100–1000 GeV range to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had grown out of the wartime Manhattan Engineer District. To evaluate the flurry of requests, an important joint panel of President John F. Kennedy’s Scientific Advisory Committee (PSAC) and the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the AEC was assembled. This panel, chaired by Harvard physicist Norman F. Ramsey, would shape the course of particle physics for the next several decades by recommending, in May 1963, that a frontier proton accelerator in the energy range of several hundred GeV be designed by Ernest Lawrence’s laboratory in Berkeley, then known as the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (LRL) (later as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory [LBL] and now as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [LBNL]). Berkeley accelerator physicists designed a reliable 200 GeV synchrotron with a projected cost of $340 million. Berkeley’s physicists expected to build the machine in California, but within only a year political forces and new ideas about how and where large-scale physics should be done dashed Berkeley’s plan. Wilson, who had been one of Lawrence’s graduate students during the 1930s, and later became a professor at Cornell, made his dramatic entry into Fermilab’s prehistory in September 1965, when he offered a well-publicized criticism of the Berkeley machine. Referring to the design as conservative, unimaginative, and far too expensive, he proposed instead an innovative and far less costly alternative based on principles he had employed in building accelerators at Harvard and Cornell.6 The Berkeley physicists dismissed Wilson’s proposal, but Congress appreciated his lower cost projection in this time of war in Vietnam. National politics, growing tensions between East Coast and West Coast physicists, and arguments by physicists from the Midwest claiming that they deserved a new accelerator in their region all affected the selection of the new accelerator’s site. Both East and West Coast physicists were disappointed when in December 1966 a site in suburban Chicago was chosen for the new laboratory, contributing to the “postwar suburbanization of American physics” that historian David Kaiser has described.7 Berkeley\n\n5\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI.2\n\nThe art, architecture, and buffalo of Robert R. Wilson’s Fermilab, 1990. (Courtesy of FNAL Visual Media Services.)\n\nphysicists, who expected to lead the new laboratory, were shocked when Wilson was offered the position of director. Part 2 of the book (chapters 5–8) tells how Wilson created the new laboratory his way. Since he had once aspired to be a cowboy, it was natural for him to apply the cultural idiom of the American frontier to this building process.8 He used the familiar frontier rhetoric to help his staff accept the hardships of work under primitive conditions and to encourage them to take cost-saving risks in building the accelerator. Wilson embraced frugality, not only as a social need but also as part of his personal aesthetic and frontier ideology. He expressed his vision of research as performed ideally by lone, independent scientists working in frontierlike conditions in a limited funding environment. Hoping to redeem what the Manhattan Project had wrought upon the world, Wilson and his deputy director, University of Illinois physicist Edwin L. Goldwasser, planned a utopian laboratory intended as a place of beauty (fig. I.2) devoted to the peaceful pursuit of particle physics and contributing to cultural and social advancement.9 6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA crucial component of Wilson’s laboratory was its new philosophy in which access by outside users would be determined solely on the merits of their research, not according to the prestige or location of their home institution. The concept of the “truly national laboratory” (TNL)—that a national physics facility should be governed by a democratic user policy—had been proposed in 1963 by Columbia University experimental physicist Leon M. Lederman. It was to signify that the new laboratory would adhere to TNL principles that Wilson named it the National Accelerator Laboratory (NAL). Slashing costs in every way, while using frontier rhetoric to encourage creativity and motivate his staff, Wilson argued that any technology that worked the first time was overdesigned and thus overpriced. Despite numerous crises, including a particularly troubling one in 1971 when a large fraction of the accelerator’s magnets shorted out, Wilson’s new laboratory and its accelerator were completed on time, at a lower cost than budgeted, with almost twice their design energy, and with more experimental areas than had originally been planned. The experimental research under Wilson suffered because of Wilson’s imposed frugality, but as we demonstrate, for example, in our account of the discovery of the “bottom quark” (chapter 7), much important research was nevertheless conducted at Wilson’s laboratory. Wilson turned promptly to the next frontier as soon as he completed the laboratory’s original accelerator (the so-called Main Ring). He planned to double the energy of the accelerator by building a second ring of magnets in the Main Ring tunnel. The novel feature of this second ring was its use of superconducting magnets, then a new and untested technology for large accelerators. The plan proved viable; Wilson’s Energy Doubler (also called the Energy Saver, the Doubler/Saver, and later the Tevatron) would also save power and money. But in the later years of Wilson’s tenure he struggled unsuccessfully to gain funding for the Energy Doubler. Severe budgetary pressures brought him to resign and then to step down in 1978. Part 3 (chapters 9–13) explains how Lederman, who became Fermilab’s second director, revitalized the laboratory and succeeded, at least initially, in extending its horizons. Lederman brought Wilson’s Energy Doubler to life, opening the trillion electron volt (TeV) energy domain. The research under Lederman also carried Fermilab into the era of megascience. This venture proceeded along two tracks simultaneously, one in the existing fixed-target program (discussed in chapter 11) and the other based on the use of colliding beams to reach higher energies (discussed in chapter 12). Long-lived “strings” of experiments and their follow-up 7\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nefforts allowed the largest experimental programs to continue to operate for decades or more. Drawing on the historical analysis of philosopher of science Mark Bodnarczuk, we interpret these strings as part of the physicists’ effort to cope with the growing investments needed for survival in the 1980s. We illustrate with a brief analysis of the birth of a particular experiment string, one that aimed to study charmed particles. In approaching megascience along the colliding-beams track, Fermilab built two mammoth detectors to analyze the collisions, first CDF, the Colliding Detector at Fermilab, and then DZero, named for its location on the Main Ring. Growing up in the shadow of CDF, DZero was given fewer resources, but it in time grew comparable in scale to CDF. Larger than many earlier laboratories, the experiments at CDF and DZero bore fruit in their 1995 codiscovery of the “top quark,” arguably the outstanding achievement of American megascience. In the second half of his tenure as director, Lederman attempted to extend Fermilab’s horizon beyond the range of the Tevatron, proposing the 20 TeV on 20 TeV Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Just as the call of the frontier had motivated Wilson to propose the Energy Doubler, a project that carried him into territory he could not navigate, Lederman’s ambition to build the SSC at Fermilab brought him into stormy seas. The storms did not subside during the tenure of Fermilab’s subsequent directors, as we briefly outline in the epilogue. As of this writing, Fermilab has offered high-energy physicists almost four decades of passage into the scientific hinterland of subnuclear physics. During this time countless secrets of nature have been uncovered. But it was only a matter of time before this adventure would end. Serious political and economic circumstances presently threaten the survival of the Tevatron, and perhaps of Fermilab. “The whole point of the frontier had been to vanish,” wrote historian William Cronon in an interpretation of the historian Frederick Jackson Turner’s classic work on the frontier. The purpose, Cronon claimed, “was to prepare the way for the civilization that would eventually replace it.”10\n\n8\n\nONE\n\nThe Call of the Frontier From the conditions of frontier life came intellectual traits of profound importance. . . . That coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness; that practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to find expedients; that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends; that restless nervous energy; that dominant individualism, working for good and for evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom—these are traits of the frontier, or traits called out elsewhere because of the existence of the frontier.\n\nFREDERICK JACKSON TURNER1\n\nEvery culture has its stories about those who were attracted to exploring frontiers and seeking new worlds. In science, from antiquity onward, naturalists and natural philosophers have employed the imagery of frontier exploration to help express their identity as pioneers who pursue the limits of man’s understanding of nature. For experimental physicists, their laboratory is an exploration vessel, like the sailing ships or covered wagons of earlier explorers, or the spacecraft of today’s astronauts. In high-energy physics, Fermilab has functioned as a flagship for almost four decades. Voyages of exploration need their patrons. Many of the classic stories about exploring frontiers (e.g., of the pursuits of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark) pivot on the tension among those who explore, those who stay behind, and those concerned with economic gain. The United States government’s support of weapons research during World War II created the large national institutions that have been funding much of American science since then. Today’s physicists routinely use the word “frontier” in their research proposals because government funding agencies still respond\n\n9\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nwell to frontier rhetoric.2 In return for the support they offer, these patrons shape the explorations, at least to some extent. Control is an ongoing theme in frontier narratives. In physics the wish to build costly accelerators for research in particle physics has had to mesh with the government’s interest in supporting a group of technically trained researchers for reasons of national security.3 The historical notion of the frontier received one of its most articulate and influential treatments in an address delivered in July 1893 in Chicago by the historian Frederick Jackson Turner (fig. 1.1). Speaking at the World’s Columbian Exposition, the world’s fair held to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the landing of Columbus in the Western Hemisphere, Turner argued that when American settlers confronted the western frontier during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they engaged in a process that cultivated social and cultural traits, such as individualism, democracy, and political equality.4 To the frontier itself— to the “hither edge of an area of free land”—Turner ascribed the power to foster a national character. Turner claimed: “The frontier is the line of most rapid and effective Americanization. The wilderness masters the colonist. It finds him a European in dress, industries, tools, modes of travel, and thought. It takes him from the railroad car and puts him in the birch canoe. It strips off the garments of civilization and arrays him in the hunting shirt and the moccasin. . . . At the frontier the environment is at first too strong for the man. He must accept the conditions which it furnishes, or perish.”5 Turner went so far as to suggest that the act of confronting the frontier generated positive attitudes, such as optimism, individualism, confidence, dynamism, and the courage to venture beyond the safe and familiar, producing an “antipathy to control.”6 The members of frontier communities thus arrived, in Turner’s view, at a distinctly American outlook which was (at least in principle) individualistic, progressive, practical, and democratic.7 Subsequent historians were quick to criticize Turner’s sweeping thesis, pointing out many overlooked aspects of frontier life, for example, the brutality committed against Native Americans, animals, or the land itself. More recently historians have noticed that Turner’s “American” outlook is male gendered and white. While Turner’s thesis fell into some scholarly disfavor, the rhetoric and imagery of its grand narrative, as well as its provocative description of America’s national growth, remained alive and passed into American popular culture.8 Frontier stories became part of the American mythology, and they continue to be dramatized, not only in histories read by generations of Americans but also in productions by the entertainment industry or in 10\n\nTHE CALL OF THE FRONTIER\n\n1.1\n\nHistorian Frederick Jackson Turner, author of the 1893 “Frontier Thesis,” presented at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

Even before Turner’s address, President Theodore Roosevelt published two articles on his own frontier experience (“Frontier Types” [1888] and “In Cowboy Land” [1893], in the Century Magazine). Subsequently, President and Professor Woodrow Wilson glorified the American 11\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nfrontier in his popular articles. Politicians on both sides of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal found the notion useful. Proponents of the policy argued that “the end of the frontier” meant that government must offer the security and opportunities formerly provided by the West, while opponents claimed that government meddling in the marketplace would undermine American individualism and self-reliance.10 Roosevelt connected the frontier with science when, in November 1944, he sought advice from Vannevar Bush on how the government should proceed with science after the Second World War. Roosevelt was optimistic about the benefits of science, for he wrote: “New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the same vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful life.”11 An MIT professor of electrical engineering, Bush was then serving as the director of the White House Office of Scientific Research and Development. He responded positively to Roosevelt’s frontier imagery, employing more frontier imagery when he replied in July 1945 with rhetoric intended to galvanize government support of basic research: “The pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this Nation. Science offers a largely unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools for his task. The rewards of such exploration both for the Nation and for the individual are great. Scientific progress is one essential key to security as a nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural progress.” Thus, in 1945 Bush painted an image of scientists confronting an endless scientific frontier in the nation’s interest. He was, however, worried about the damaging consequences of closing such frontiers. In his memoirs he confessed that he became anxious years earlier, “when I was told [as a child in 1919] that the frontier had been occupied, that all of man’s wants had been met, that science had come to the end of a trail.”12 Bush then used this frontier imagery effectively in his 1945 pamphlet Science, the Endless Frontier, which ushered in the golden age of American science funding. As other historians have shown, the major American national funding agencies of today (such as the National Science Foundation, established in 1950) grew out of the discussions that Bush stimulated in 1945, and this period of well-supported government-funded research, which lasted through the 1960s, resulted in much scientific progress and many Nobel prizes.13 Science grew so rapidly that scholars of science, noting its apparently exponential growth, used the term “big science.” Alvin Weinberg, the director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, popularized the term in the mid-1960s.14 12\n\nTHE CALL OF THE FRONTIER\n\nDuring the 1960s, heroic frontier imagery illuminated the rhetoric of many politicians who spoke about science and technology. When John F. Kennedy accepted his party’s presidential nomination in July 1960, he spoke in his “New Frontier” address of “the frontier of the 1960s, a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils, a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats.” He referred to “uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.” And as he inspired the nation to undertake space exploration he asked Americans “to be new pioneers on that new frontier.”15 Scientists took advantage of the imagery’s popularity and used the rhetoric even when communicating among themselves, sometimes in code. No physicist misunderstood when Arthur Holly Compton, the director of the Chicago Metallurgical Lab, reported to James Conant, the president of Harvard, on December 2, 1942, “The Italian navigator has just landed in the new world.” They knew it meant that Enrico Fermi had achieved the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.16 Three decades later, Fermi would be a model for his Los Alamos colleague Robert R. Wilson, when Wilson created the National Accelerator Laboratory (fig. 1.2). References to the frontier appeared often in the writings and speeches of Fermilab’s founding fathers. They readily tapped into the deeply rooted spirit evoked by frontier imagery. Wilson was familiar with the imagery, having been born in Frontier, Wyoming, and having spent some of his early years as a cowboy. While he did not, as far as we know, ever refer to Frederick Jackson Turner, the imagery Wilson used was remarkably similar to Turner’s. Wilson’s rhetoric, however, reflected his interest in designing the new laboratory as a workplace for rugged, self-reliant, determined researchers with a zeal for conquering the unknown with their hands-on efforts. His imagery also differed from Turner’s in that his ideal included equality for minorities, women, and outside users. When Wilson brought his perspective to the final congressional authorization hearings of the JCAE in 1969, Senator John Pastore asked a witness, Paul McDaniel of the AEC, what the new laboratory would offer for national defense. As Edwin Goldwasser, Wilson’s deputy director, remembered, “the witness on the stand was dumbfounded and speechless.” Wilson, who was sitting beside the science statesman Norman Ramsey, then asked whether he might answer instead. “Norman, although he was unaware of any precedent for audience participation in a Congressional hearing, told Bob to go ahead and try to be recognized,” said Goldwasser.17 The message that Wilson offered became legend: “[It] has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of 13\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.2\n\nRobert Rathbun Wilson in his Cornell University office, 1966. (Cornell University. Photograph by Sol Goldberg. Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library.)\n\nmen, our love of culture. . . . It has to do with, are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate and honor in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.”18 Against the background of the Vietnam War, escalating urban violence, declining prospects for scientific employment, and eroding research funding for the first time since World War II, this message was heartening. 14\n\nTHE CALL OF THE FRONTIER\n\nWilson’s version of the frontier rhetoric forged an identity at Fermilab that unified his workforce.19 NAL’s frontier theme was well articulated by Wilson’s first associate director, M. Stanley Livingston, who wrote in 1968, “There is in mankind a driving urge to explore the unknown.”20 Linking the frontier with the research about to begin at the new laboratory, he wrote, “In past ages much of this exploration was geographical— the search for new continents and new seas.” He then explained, “In our generation the most challenging frontiers lie in the search for new knowledge about nature and about man, and the most dramatic progress has been made on the frontiers of science.” One search was to identify the ultimate constituents of matter. “The frontier of high energy and the infinitesimally small is a challenge to the mind of man. If we can reach and cross this frontier, our generation will have furnished a significant milestone in human history.”21 Livingston was accustomed to pursuing frontiers in his work using particle accelerators. He had built the first cyclotron four decades earlier while in graduate school at the University of California in Berkeley. This instrument for particle acceleration had been\n\n1.3\n\nM.

(Courtesy of American Institute of Physics.)\n\n15\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nconceived two years earlier by Livingston’s mentor Ernest O. Lawrence (fig. 1.3), who had also embraced the imagery of the frontier—for example, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in December 1939, titled “The New Frontiers in the Atom.”22 To some, Wilson’s heroic tales of pioneers struggling on the frontier offered relief or even hope during the turbulence of the late 1960s. But the application of his frontier imagery to Fermilab’s site had obvious limits. The physicists clearly did not face the physical dangers of the Old West or of the atomic West. And even if the landscape contained vestiges of the prairie, everyone knew the Fermilab site had once contained a housing development and farms, and that the city of Chicago was not far away. Fermilab was not the only research laboratory to use the frontier motif. For example, in the state of Washington, Hanford Laboratory and its company town Richland, as John W. Findlay notes in his history of the plutonium-producing community, “fashioned an identity by conjuring up images of an Old West full of untamed nature, harsh conditions, and individual sacrifice.”23 Like the workers at Fermilab, those at Hanford saw themselves as pioneers, although at Fermilab the territory being explored was particle physics, while at Hanford it was the “industrial frontier.”24 At the turn of the twentieth century, Turner suggested that historians pay “attention to the frontier as a fertile field for investigation,”25 but only a few historians of science have drawn on this imagery as a conceptual tool.26 As the following chapters illustrate, historians of physics have an especially fertile opportunity to heed Turner’s suggestion, given the broad application that physicists, and especially particle physicists, have made of the frontier both as image and metaphor. By unveiling the layers of meaning within the physicists’ own use of the term “frontier,” historians of science can forge a powerful tool to help them integrate within general history such major developments in science as the rise of large high-energy physics research laboratories.\n\n16\n\nTWO\n\nThe Several Hundred GeV Accelerator, 1959–1963 The scientists of the United States, native and foreign-born, have led the world in high energy physics. Over the last decade, most of the major inventions and discoveries in high energy physics have been made in U.S. laboratories. Several of these have been recognized by the award of the Nobel Prize. NORMAN F. RAMSEY1\n\nIn late summer of 1960, the community of high-energy physics was buzzing with surprising news. The proton beams emerging from the first two large alternating-gradient accelerators were of much higher intensity than expected. Both machines—CERN’s Proton Synchrotron (PS), operating in November 1959, and Brookhaven’s Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS), operating in July 1960—were in the range of 30 GeV. The PS and AGS followed a line of important accelerator technologies pioneered by Ernest Lawrence’s cyclotron, which he invented in 1929. But while in the first circular particle accelerator, the cyclotron, light positive ions spiraled outward in a constant magnetic field, gradually increasing their radius by the action of a constant-frequency alternating electric field synchronized with the circular movement of the particles, in the subsequent generation of circular accerators, known as synchrotrons, which had been invented by the Russian physicist Vladimir Veksler in 1944 as well as by Edwin McMillan in 1945, the circular radius of the particles was held constant by varying either the frequency\n\n19\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nof the accelerating voltage or the strength of the magnetic field. With particles having a constant, rather than a spiraling-outward path, the synchrotron was a vast improvement on the cyclotron, because the accelerator could take the shape of a doughnut; the reduction in material of a doughnut-shaped accerator drastically reduced its cost. The alternating-gradient (or “strong-focusing”) principle was the next major advance in circular accelerators after the synchroton. The principle behind it was developed collaboratively in 1952 by three Brookhaven physicists: Ernest Courant, Stanley Livingston, and Hartland Snyder. (It was learned later that the Greek electrical engineer Nicholas Christofilos had already invented strong focusing two years earlier.) The strongfocusing principle allowed much larger accelerators to be built at lower cost, because focusing the particle beam could be performed relatively easily using an alternating series of converging and diverging magnetic lenses.2 The unexpected demonstration that the two first large strongfocusing machines had high intensity as well as higher energy assured physicists that the tradition of building ever larger and more powerful accelerators would continue for a long time.\n\nProposals from MURA, Caltech, and Berkeley, 1959–1960 Soon the lure of new data at higher energies inspired the planning of accelerators having much higher energy. Even with America’s increasing military involvement in Southeast Asia, the myriad of social problems that erupted in America during the 1960s, the continuing appreciation of the scientific advances made by physicists in World War II caused the United States government to be willing to fund larger accelerators.3 One of the first viable proposals emerged during a summer 1959 workshop held in Madison, Wisconsin, and sponsored by the Midwestern Universities Research Association (MURA). MURA’s innovative Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient Accelerator (FFAG), then in design form, was to produce an intense proton beam by colliding two 10–15 GeV beams.4 MURA hoped to build the machine in the Midwest. The primary aim of MURA’s summer meeting was to design and generate support for the FFAG, which was also studied at the meeting in relation to other existing schemes for achieving high energy or high intensity. As this workshop took place before the PS or AGS began operating, many of the physicists attending the meeting thought that the only practical route to higher energies was by colliding particle beams. High-energy fixed-target machines\n\n20\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\n(machines whose beams were directly used in experiments), they believed, would be prohibitively expensive, and perhaps not even useful, because above 5 GeV the particles would be confined to a narrow cone and would therefore be difficult to distinguish.5 Alvin Tollestrup, an experimental physicist from Caltech who would later play a major role in Fermilab’s history, was a participant in this workshop. He recalled that MURA’s physicists were so confident in their FFAG design that they issued a challenge to everyone present to design a technically and economically feasible fixed-target machine that could produce the same energy at the point of collision that the FFAG would produce (i.e., 300 GeV).6 Tollestrup’s Caltech colleague Matthew Sands took this challenge up. An iconoclast by nature, Sands reinvented a scheme (which, in fact, Wilson and also Argonne physicist Lee Teng had suggested but not implemented several years earlier) based on forming a cascade of several accelerators. In this plan, an accelerated beam would be injected from one machine into the next higher-energy one.7 Sands hoped to cut costs by accelerating the particles to high energy in a “booster” synchrotron and then, at a fairly high injection field, feeding the accelerated beam emerging from the booster into the main synchrotron, where it would reach several hundred GeV. Money would be saved because beams of particles have a smaller cross section after acceleration and thus the largest synchrotron would be able to function with magnets of smaller apertures.8 Most of the participants in the MURA workshop did not take Sands’s proposal seriously, for it was thought that one could not control such a large system or work with accelerator magnets as small as Sands specified. But in computing the details with a subgroup of participants in the MURA study, including Tollestrup as well as Courant and M. Hildred Blewett from Brookhaven, Sands estimated that the cost of his 100 and 300 GeV cascade designs would be about the same order of magnitude as an FFAG accelerator of 10 GeV. Optimizing the parameters, Sands realized that he could achieve 300 GeV most efficiently by injecting beam into the main ring from a 10 GeV–range “rapid-cycling” booster synchrotron. The high repetition rate of such a booster would make it possible to produce a high-intensity beam. He calculated that the magnet aperture in the main accelerator ring could be as small as a few square centimeters.9 After the workshop, Sands and Tollestrup worked further on achieving 300 GeV. They were joined by their Caltech colleague, Robert Walker. To the booster synchrotron and the main ring in their proposed accel-\n\n21\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nerator system, they added a linear accelerator to inject protons into the booster.10 Next, Sands, Tollestrup, and Walker invited Snyder, Courant, and Hildred Blewett from Brookhaven, Kenneth Robinson from the Harvard-MIT Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA), and Robert Hulsizer from the University of Illinois to join their effort. Their report, “A Proton Synchrotron for 300 GeV,” estimated the cost of the proposed machine, including preparation of the site, salaries, and accelerator components, at $77 million.11 In May 1960, Sands, Tollestrup, and Walker proposed that Caltech formally support the small group that was working on the design and “initiate a project” for designing the next high-energy accelerator.12 By that time, several physicists who were part of a planning group at Lawrence’s laboratory in Berkeley had also conceived a proton synchrotron in the several hundred GeV range.13 The Berkeley laboratory was now headed by Edwin McMillan, whom Lawrence had picked as his successor. McMillan’s interest in building a larger accelerator had been sparked in March 1960 when CERN director John Adams visited Berkeley bringing news about the operation of the PS. On August 12 that year, McMillan convened an accelerator planning committee to consider building a strong-focusing synchrotron similar to the CERN PS and the Brookhaven AGS but of higher energy.14 Along with Luis Alvarez, Glenn Seaborg, and Robert Wilson, McMillan had been one of “Lawrence’s boys” (fig. 2.1), the group of young men Lawrence gathered around him in the 1930s to help him bring the Berkeley laboratory to prominence.15 When Sands learned about McMillan’s new accelerator planning group, he wondered whether the Caltech and Berkeley groups should join forces. Two months later, Berkeley physicists Lloyd Smith, McMillan, and David Judd attended a meeting at Caltech at which the Caltech and Berkeley groups “agreed that as much interchange of ideas should take place as possible without setting up a formal connection, and that we should try to reach agreement on a single proposal for the West Coast.”16 Caltech had, in any case, judged Sands’s accelerator project too expensive to support on its own. A sponsoring group named the Western Accelerator Group (WAG) was then formed. WAG included, besides Caltech, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at San Diego, and the University of Southern California. But the University of California at Berkeley did not join WAG. In March 1961, Sands explained to John Blewett, a leading accelerator physicist at Brookhaven, that the WAG effort was “still working independently but in close communication with Berkeley.”17\n\n22\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\n2.1\n\nLawrence and his “boys,” 1939.

In 1959, Soviet and American physicists explored a proposal for a joint U.S.USSR accelerator project as one of several cooperative ventures in unclassified atomic energy research. Meetings between Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower had encouraged scientific exchange between their countries. One result was a U.S.-USSR information exchange agreement signed on November 24, 1959, by AEC chairman John A. McCone and his counterpart, chairman of the USSR Administration of Atomic Energy Vasily S. Emelyanov. When McCone asked Emelyanov whether Soviet physicists would be interested in exploring an international accelerator collaboration, Emelyanov proposed to McCone in July 1960 that it might be “convenient to take advantage\n\n23\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nof the presence of our high energy physics specialists in the USA for the Rochester Conference to conduct a preliminary exchange of views.”18 On learning of this Soviet interest during a visit to the USSR, Robert R. Wilson of Cornell took the initiative to organize an informal meeting at the 1960 Rochester Conference to discuss the new “ultra-high-energy” accelerators. Held on August 28, 1960, this meeting provided a convenient forum for exploring the pros and cons, as well as the methodology, of experimenting at much higher energy.19 While the Soviets hardly spoke at the meeting (perhaps because of the period’s mercurial political climate), the Americans and Europeans hotly debated the proposed ultrahigh-energy accelerators. American physicists tended to be confident about the possibility. J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the American enthusiasts, felt that higher energies might reveal new unstable heavy particles. Pointing out that “we do not know what we shall find,” Oppenheimer considered it “likely that essential novelty will appear” at higher energy. In any case, he added, “a knowledge of what does in fact occur in this domain will take us a long way” toward understanding subatomic matter. The Germans tended to be more skeptical. Werner Heisenberg remarked that since cosmic ray data had revealed little at higher energies, they might “find nothing of great interest” at higher energies. Others considered the disappointing cosmic ray evidence “inconclusive,” because of the limitations of cosmic ray detection techniques and the small number of events. In his conference summary, Wilson judged that “the range of opinion between optimism and pessimism is fairly uniformly populated by physicists—but shaded a bit toward those who are optimistically minded.”20 A variety of accelerator designs in the range of 100–1000 GeV were discussed at Wilson’s meeting—linear accelerators, colliding-beam machines, and proton synchrotrons. MURA members supported their FFAG, but most of those present considered colliding beams to be a technology “of the future,” because they required detectors having submicrosecond time resolution, a requirement not yet met by that period’s primary detection apparatus, the bubble chamber.21 Also discussed were the new proposals from California in which protons would be accelerated to hundreds of GeV in a circular fixed-target synchrotron. According to Wilson, the group agreed that for about $100 million—or at most $200 million— it would be feasible to push the design of a conventional alternatinggradient proton synchrotron to 100 GeV, or even higher, and that this sum might even cover the first round of experiments. By pushing the tolerances, they could hope to attain 1000 GeV at a cost of less than $1 billion, “really a bargain of course,” concluded Wilson.22 24\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\nProposals by Brookhaven, Berkeley, and Caltech—August 1960–December 1961 The issue of building an accelerator in the 100–1000 GeV range was then taken up by many physics advisory panels. In December 1960, a joint panel was assembled under Emanuel Piore, IBM’s director of research, consisting of the President’s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) and the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the AEC. Piore issued the panel’s report, which recommended approval of the electron linear accelerator at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), intensive studies of strong-focusing proton synchrotrons, including studies oriented toward much higher energy “within the next few years,” and continued collaboration with the Soviets.23 The Piore Panel was lukewarm about MURA’s FFAG, because the unexpectedly high intensity of the Brookhaven AGS and CERN PS had eroded the FFAG’s relevance. While the AGS and PS beams were still roughly a hundred times less intense than those projected for the FFAG, the panel pointed out that by increasing energy instead of intensity physicists gained “the additional advantage of extending the range of study of all known primary and secondary phenomena and of adding the potential of new phenomena such as undiscovered particles.” The Piore Panel also noted that to accommodate the next generation of accelerators, the annual high-energy physics budget might need to be increased by as much as $200 million by 1970.24 Brookhaven’s plan to build an accelerator in the 300–1000 GeV range was discussed at a meeting arranged by the AEC in response to the Soviet and American plans to collaborate on an accelerator project. It was held on September 16, 1960, at the American Institute of Physics (AIP) in New York City. This meeting was attended by two delegations of physicists: a Soviet one led by Vladimir Veksler from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) at Dubna and an American delegation led by Brookhaven director Leland Haworth. The delegations agreed that their nations should sponsor national study groups that could later cooperate. A “comprehensive intergroup discussion” was planned for the upcoming International Accelerator Conference at Brookhaven during the following summer, in 1961. In an effort to avoid competition with ongoing national efforts, the participants agreed that their international accelerator should have an energy greater than 300 GeV.25 John Blewett assembled a group at Brookhaven to prepare a preliminary design study for the American contingent of this international collaboration. Meanwhile, the national effort to build a 200–300 GeV accelerator continued in California. In April 1961, WAG and Berkeley submitted 25\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ntheir separate proposals to the AEC. WAG requested $593,000 to support a fifteen-month study of the design for a new proton synchrotron project to be directed jointly by Sands and Robert Bacher, a former Los Alamos division leader and former AEC commissioner who was then chairman of Caltech’s physics department. The proposal included Sands’s earlier September 1960 report on the 300 GeV cascade synchrotron, as well as other reports expanding Sands’s ideas.26 Among those who appreciated Sands’s design was Wilson, who wrote to Sands in April 1961: “I have been watching your efforts with the 300 GeV machine with open-mouthed admiration. It seems to me that you are working on the right problem at the right time, and I am sure that something will come of it all.”27 The Berkeley proposal, which McMillan submitted in late April 1961, described a somewhat more ambitious machine than did WAG’s, with a higher price tag. The request was for $3 million for a two-year period to design an expanded alternating-gradient synchrotron in the 100–300 GeV range. The research included extensive injector studies.28 The WAG proposal was in many ways more attractive than Berkeley’s, for its design, which had been studied longer and more extensively, stressed economy and introduced a more innovative injector scheme. Also WAG planned to augment its nucleus of designers with outside experts who would obtain some support from their home institutions. On the other hand, Berkeley had an established reputation and far more experience in building large accelerators than any of the WAG universities. As Tollestrup and Walker recalled, the Berkeley physicists tended to discount WAG’s proposal, or at best see it as part of the Berkeley project.29 Whether Berkeley ever gave serious consideration to WAG’s efforts is uncertain. One reason Berkeley’s budget topped WAG’s was that Berkeley estimated that 105 man-years of effort were needed to create its design, while WAG assumed that only ten man-years would be needed to realize its design. Berkeley planned to construct prototypes of all the major components.30 By April 1961, both Berkeley and Brookhaven were arguing that they were the only reasonable candidates for building the new machine and that if the project went to an organization other than Berkeley or Brookhaven, it would be delayed for several years because of the time spent gathering the necessary personnel and creating a smoothly functioning operation. Edward Lofgren wrote to McMillan on April 6 that a strong case could be made to the AEC for choosing Berkeley over Brookhaven “in terms of history, demonstrated competence and organization.” He also argued to McMillan that Berkeley needed a new accelerator to maintain its front-rank position in high-energy physics, given that the Bevatron would soon no longer be a unique facility. As he ex26\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\nplained, “governments of this and other countries have built up many new large laboratories more or less in the image of Berkeley at the demand of scientists all over the world.”31 By this time it was clear that Berkeley did not plan to join WAG. Thus, two independent California proposals for a several GeV accelerator were submitted to the AEC, one from WAG and the other from Berkeley. Lofgren’s memo to McMillan also raised an organizational theme then new to high-energy physics. He explained that the increased scale of the proposed accelerator demanded that it be based at a “national facility” open to users from all parts of the country. To make the facility national, Lofgren explained, one could organize an accelerator council of representatives having expertise in high-energy physics and appropriate geographic representation from top universities and laboratories. In Lofgren’s scheme, this council would act as an advisory board and report to the director of the laboratory, but the laboratory would be built and operated by Berkeley on a nearby site.32 WAG’s proposal that month included a similar idea: “An accelerator in the hundred-BeV class would necessarily be a national facility serving the national scientific community.”33 The AEC was sympathetic to both California proposals, as Paul McDaniel, the director of the AEC’s Division of Research, explained in a letter to Oppenheimer. But funding more than one independent design study seemed “especially unwarranted in view of the close geographical proximity of the two groups in question.”34 The commission decided not to approve either design study until new procedures for handling this situation were in place. This decision led McMillan, who represented Berkeley’s proposal, and Bacher, who represented WAG’s, to work toward making their two studies more palatable to the AEC. In a joint letter to McDaniel, they pledged “to work toward the objective of a single proposal for the construction of a high-energy accelerator to be submitted to the Atomic Energy Commission,” and they explained that a steering group had been established to coordinate the Berkeley and WAG efforts.35 Still uncomfortable with the situation, the AEC asked twenty-three prominent physicists to review the two very different proposals. While the reviewers generally favored both studies, many felt that the country “can only afford one 300 BeV accelerator and indeed only one 300 BeV study group.”36 The discussions continued during summer studies held at both Berkeley and Brookhaven involving physicists from many institutions in the United States and Western Europe. The Berkeley meeting, which ran from June to August in the summer of 1961 and involved about thirty physicists, considered experiments that could be performed in the new energy 27\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nrange. The group’s thorough examination of experimental and theoretical issues helped build the scientific case for funding the project and bolstered support for the effort within the physics community.37 The Brookhaven meeting, with roughly two dozen participants who met from late July through early September of 1961, focused on issues of accelerator design. The invitees from the Soviet Union did not attend, perhaps because of the Berlin crisis that summer. Nonetheless, as John Blewett reported, the mood at the meeting was positive. The participants enthusiastically discussed a number of the new technical ideas, including WAG’s suggestions of cascade injection and building magnets of smaller aperture and thus of smaller size and cost. They also discussed beam injection and extraction, and the novel idea proposed by Thomas Collins of the CEA to leave long, empty, straight sections between the magnets in the main ring to allow room for radio frequency (RF) utility, beam extraction, and other accelerator functions.38 By August 1961, Brookhaven had revised its design report to reflect the summer study discussions. A series of papers, later to be edited by Luke C. L. Yuan into a collection titled The Nature of Matter, spoke of the research potential of the new machine. Part of the report, edited by Blewett, included a preliminary design for a 1000 GeV alternating-gradient proton synchrotron. Using rough estimates of the parameters for the injector and radio frequency systems, and reducing drastically the amount of steel used in magnets based on experience with the AGS, Blewett projected that the 1000 GeV machine would cost $675 million. He interpolated that similar 700 GeV and 300 GeV machines would cost approximately $500 million and $300 million, respectively, including accelerator components, buildings, site preparation, salaries, and a 10% contingency. In his conclusion, Blewett noted that “a real machine design will emerge only when a group of competent physicists and engineers is assembled for a full-scale attack on the problem.”39 The high cost of the proposals and the consensus that the United States could afford only one large accelerator and one study group put the three proposals in clear competition. The WAG proposal was more complete, more innovative, and less expensive than Berkeley’s, but Berkeley could boast having an experienced team of accelerator builders and a reputation for constructing reliable accelerators. Brookhaven also had a solid accelerator-building tradition, but its having only recently completed the AGS (in 1960) was a disadvantage. Since the 1950s Berkeley and Brookhaven had alternated in building the next largest machines, and McMillan insisted that Berkeley should have the next turn.40\n\n28\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\nNo major technical obstacles emerged during the work of designing, but the last four months of 1961 were a tense time for all the groups, especially as support for any of them was far from assured, despite backing from the 1960 Piore Panel. SLAC had recently experienced trouble gaining congressional approval, even with the project’s support from the 1958 Piore Panel. The situation was murky because the AEC had not yet defined its decision-making process. And while each group’s individual input needed recognition, it was important that the physicists present a united front.41 WAG and Berkeley continued to discuss the possibility of collaborating. They convened a steering committee, which met in September, October, and November 1961. The September meeting outlined technical assignments: Berkeley would focus on designing Linac injectors and the RF system; WAG would concentrate on synchrotron injectors. Both groups would work on site issues and magnet design. The October and November meetings considered various possible Berkeley-WAG collaboration schemes, agreeing that the working design group should “have a central location with broad provision for national participation.” McMillan and Bacher guessed that “some sort of national committee and/or national study effort” would be proposed.42 In late December 1961, representatives from Brookhaven, Berkeley, MURA, and WAG met in Los Angeles to make further plans for the new accelerator. Bacher and McMillan emphasized the importance of campaigning for the accelerator within both the government and the physics community. Blewett presented an organizational plan. Without too much debate the group also agreed that there should be a central study group at an existing laboratory authorized to prepare a design and cost estimate. The leader of this group would be advised by a committee of experts with nationwide representation. But in contrast to Lofgren’s plan, this group agreed that the advisory committee would report to the AEC, rather than to the laboratory director.43 As for where the work should be done, representatives from MURA, Brookhaven, and Berkeley each presented arguments for why their home laboratories should be chosen. The members of WAG made no bid, for they realized that they stood no chance against the politically powerful groups at Berkeley and Brookhaven.44 Brookhaven physicists argued that they were the nation’s experts in strong-focusing synchrotrons and could participate only if Brookhaven was the central site, for otherwise the effort would detract from AGS development. Berkeley representatives contended that only their laboratory possessed the necessary resources\n\n29\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nto host the study because Brookhaven was involved in AGS development. The meeting ended without a resolution.45 In February 1962, both Berkeley and Brookhaven asked to be the base of the design study. With a technical steering committee added to its proposal, Berkeley’s estimate for the study, which would be completed in two years, was $3 million.46 Brookhaven estimated that its design study would cost $4 million with completion in three years, incorporating an electron synchrotron into its design and planning to explore schemes for accelerating protons to energies as high as 1000 GeV. Fifteen years younger than Berkeley, Brookhaven did not stress its history but made the argument that with its progressive style of consortium management Brookhaven had “developed the broad views and cooperative attitude expected of a National Laboratory.”47\n\nThe AEC’s Dilemma, 1962 The AEC worried about the “bad feelings” brewing at the “large laboratories” in response to the competing proposals from Berkeley and Brookhaven. The presidential science adviser, Harvard’s Jerome Wiesner, warned that steps needed to be taken “cautiously, but fast” before things got “out of control.” Discussing the situation with the AEC’s chairman, Glenn Seaborg, who had earlier served as chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, Wiesner explained in February 1962 that commissioner Leland Haworth, the former director of Brookhaven, had been handling the matter for the commission.48 Seaborg raised a ticklish point. As a former member of Berkeley’s staff, he had many close Berkeley associations; he had shared with McMillan not only the Nobel Prize but residence at the Berkeley Faculty Club. Similarly, Haworth had many close associations at Brookhaven. To avoid possible conflicts of interest, Paul McDaniel of the AEC, a trained physicist and skilled bureaucrat, assumed responsibility for the synchrotron project until mid-1963.49 On April 19, in letters sent to McMillan, Maurice Goldhaber, who in 1961 became the director of Brookhaven, and twenty-eight other scientists, McDaniel made clear that the federal government was not committed to “the location or mode of operation of such a facility if it were authorized,” and that the commission concurred in the belief that the management of the new laboratory “necessarily should be separate from the management of any other laboratory.” He asked for comments on organizational issues, such as establishing a committee for policy advice, and reminded his correspondents that “a large new accelerator facility 30\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\nfor energies of several hundred BeV will receive authorization only if the scientific community is in general agreement on the need for such a facility.”50 In responding on May 8, McMillan spoke against making too radical a change. He insisted that the amount of outside participation should be settled later and that arrangements for managing the laboratory should be left open. He also noted that it might be most efficient for an existing laboratory to build and operate the accelerator, at least in its early stages, and commented that if Brookhaven were chosen as the center for the study, few Berkeley researchers were likely to go there and that he doubted much work would be done at Berkeley, since “the main part of the accelerator is so much of an integrated whole that parts of the design can not be split off without serious loss of efficiency.”51 This was early evidence for the conservative approach McMillan would consistently take in subsequent discussions of the management of the new laboratory. His tradition-bound view would soon clash with the new AEC ideas of what was appropriate for an expensive national facility. Goldhaber, on the other hand, expressed willingness to align with the new AEC guidelines for siting and management. Not only did he agree with the approach outlined by McDaniel, but he also applauded having 30%–40% of the work performed by outside laboratories, proclaiming that Brookhaven “would strongly oppose any suggestions which would tend to reduce this degree of multi-participation.” Moreover, despite earlier comments that Brookhaven should not be involved unless the study were located at BNL because that would detract from the AGS effort, Goldhaber stated that the laboratory expected “to be deeply involved in the study regardless of its location.”52 Unlike McMillan, Goldhaber never had a particular interest in machine design. He could be more open minded, having delegated most of the designing responsibility to Cosmotron and AGS veterans G. Kenneth Green and John Blewett. And, unlike Berkeley researchers, Brookhaven researchers had mixed feelings about whether the proposed new high-energy machine should be their top priority; some felt it was more important to promote an AGS upgrade. Finally, even though some Brookhaven users felt that the laboratory’s management was not open enough, as a younger laboratory, Brookhaven was in principle oriented toward serving outside users.53 An August 1962 AEC summary of responses to the letters circulated by McDaniel reveals overwhelming support for the design study. While several respondents suggested that there be two focal points, and a few others favored neutral sites, most cast a vote either for Brookhaven or Berkeley. Between these two, “the choice was 6–2 in favor of LRL [Berkeley],” 31\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nchiefly because the correspondents thought “BNL should continue to be heavily occupied with getting the AGS into full utilization, while Berkeley should have a greater strength of engineering talent available for the study program.”54 McDaniel noted that the commission’s preference for establishing the laboratory at a new site under the direction of a geographically balanced management organization would be complicated by the difficulty of obtaining the required authorization from Congress. He remarked, however, that if a major laboratory like Berkeley were given central responsibility for the study, it would be “important to have made provisions which will insure that the study program have a national character.” He also made clear that the location of the study would not necessarily dictate the site or management of the facility.55 He then recommended that there be created “a special High Energy Accelerator Advisory Committee,” with broad national representation, eventually to become known as HEPAP, the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, which would “consider the broad implications of the study program both initially and throughout the course of the work.” In contrast to Lofgren’s and McMillan’s official pronouncements about the “national character” of the study group and the new facility, Lofgren’s notes of an informal meeting that he and McMillan held with McDaniel and his staff on September 26, 1962, reveal that the AEC was in fact willing to tolerate a more old-fashioned arrangement. At meetings held to gather information for the AEC’s presentation to the Bureau of the Budget (BOB, later to become OMB, the Office of Management and Budget), McMillan and Lofgren were told that the AEC planned to request funding for a “Western Regional” accelerator.56 According to Lofgren, after some “sparring” over the definition of such a western accelerator, staff members “did not disagree with our idea that this meant a Berkeley designed, built, and operated accelerator with safeguards to insure proper use.” McDaniel realized that the AEC needed formally to reserve the right to decide the site of the accelerator, as was standard practice for large construction projects. Wiesner had already indicated the political necessity of enforcing such a rule in this case. But in informal discussions with Berkeley representatives, McDaniel did not retract McMillan’s traditional prerogatives. It would be up to Seaborg, as AEC chairman, to take such action, if he so chose.57 Brookhaven was mentioned in the AEC’s request to BOB. In a twotrack approach, a design study for a machine in the several hundred GeV range would be conducted by Berkeley, while Brookhaven worked on the design of a 1000 GeV machine slated for future construction. The FFAG was also included in the budget request, although the AEC admitted 32\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\nthat it would not survive if only two of the three large accelerators were funded. The discussions were reminiscent of the earlier arrangements for constructing the Bevatron and Cosmotron, when it was decided that both laboratories could build machines of different energies.58\n\nThe Ramsey Panel, 1963 Officials in Washington DC were disturbed by the number and expense of the requests made for new particle accelerators and by tensions caused by the dark horse MURA.59 Responding to this concern, in November 1962 Wiesner and the AEC convened another in the series of President’s Science Advisory Committee/General Advisory Committee (PSAC/GAC) panels to offer advice on future needs in high-energy physics. Headed by Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard (fig. 2.2), this new panel would set the course of high-energy accelerator development for the next decade, and beyond. Highly respected for his scientific capabilities, Ramsey had been a graduate student of Columbia University’s Isidor I. Rabi, whose experiments with molecular beams had made it possible to measure the radio frequency spectrum of atomic nuclei. Ramsey’s work with Rabi led to the discovery of the deuteron electric quadrupole moment. Ramsey had also worked on both the radar and atomic bomb projects during the Second World War, aided in the establishment of Brookhaven after the war, and served on a number of advisory boards before joining the GAC. He developed a reputation for being fair minded and diplomatic. These skills would prove useful as he and nine other eminent scientists appointed jointly to PSAC and GAC, and two ex officio members from other government agencies, worked on Ramsey’s panel to investigate the issues of the several hundred GeV accelerator.60 In early December 1962, as the Ramsey Panel began its deliberations, Berkeley presented a revised proposal to the AEC, requesting a much higher budget of almost $5 million ($4,875,000) to support a two-year design study for an accelerator in the 100 GeV range. Much of the proposal focused on the use of the machine for research, providing a lengthy discussion of experiments to be done. The new proposal estimated that a 100 GeV machine would cost $152 million, while a 200 GeV machine would cost $263 million, including accelerator components, architect engineering costs, development costs and 20% technical contingency. The proposal also mentioned that Brookhaven was proceeding with studies for a 1000 GeV accelerator.61 33\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.2\n\nHarvard professor of physics Norman F. Ramsey, chairman of the 1963 Joint PSAC-GAC Panel and longtime president of Universities Research Association, 1972. (Courtesy of Fermilab Visual Media Services.)\n\nUnlike the cautious February 1962 version of the Berkeley proposal, the December proposal stated boldly that “LRL would assume full responsibility for design, construction, and operation of the accelerator and facilities.” And in contrast with the February report, the December edition made only passing reference to outside collaboration, remarking that “if people and facilities are available some portions of the study could be carried on away from Berkeley.”62 Berkeley had thus revised its pro34\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\nposal along traditional lines, and the AEC seemed prepared to accept it, having obviously been in close contact with Berkeley during the document’s preparation. The AEC transmitted Berkeley’s revised proposal to the Ramsey Panel. Meeting in fourteen sessions over a six-month period, the Ramsey Panel interviewed physicists from all over the nation, heard presentations from various government agencies, met with BOB, and engaged in constantly vigorous discussion. The panel had a number of other issues to consider besides the several hundred GeV accelerator, including Brookhaven’s plans for a 1000 GeV machine and for storage rings for the AGS, MURA’s FFAG, a 10 GeV electron synchrotron proposed by Robert Wilson at Cornell, various high-intensity meson accelerators, and funding for various detector developments and university user groups. The most controversial issue was the relative importance of MURA’s FFAG proposal.63 After extensive discussion, the panel members decided that they could not “encourage new high-energy accelerator construction costing millions of dollars unless a useful extension of accelerator parameters is achieved, or a new technology advanced.” Referring to the problem of explaining the strong interactions and working more on the weak interactions using neutrinos at higher energies, following the 1962 discovery of two types of neutrinos by Columbia physicists Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger, the panel judged proton energy—the parameter in question for the several GeV accelerator—to be “the single most important energy parameter to be extended.” They also expressed hope of furthering research aimed at providing “a clue to the connections among the different kinds of basic forces.” The panel members were aware that using high-intensity beams could allow detailed study of interactions of such low probability that present accelerators could not observe them, but they also recognized the difficult technological problems associated with high-intensity accelerators, including high radioactivity levels and the high cost of such machines.64 For these reasons, the Ramsey Panel felt obliged to recommend only one high−intensity machine, the FFAG, but it was ranked lower than the high-energy machines. The deliberations over Berkeley’s proposal for its 100 GeV machine were heated. Edwin Goldwasser, a panel member from the University of Illinois, recalled that some resisted the proposal because of Berkeley’s conservative stance on management or because the design energy of 100 GeV was seen as too low.65 Paul McDaniel had noted in September 1962 that disapproval from the powerful Caltech physicist Robert 35\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nBacher “could kill the project.”66 By January 1963 McMillan had agreed to raise the energy range to 150–300 GeV, thus pleasing both the panel and Bacher. As Bacher explained to Ramsey, no one in the Caltech group “had any real enthusiasm for a 100 BeV West Coast machine.” In light of the increased energy range and further technical discussions, the Caltech group wished to add its “enthusiastic support of the study proposal contained in McMillan’s letter.”67 When the Ramsey Panel issued its report on April 26, 1963, it recommended “that the Federal Government—Authorize, at the earliest possible date, the construction by the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, of a high energy proton accelerator at approximately 200 BeV energy.”68 In the vernacular of the time, the project became known as “the 200 BeV project.” Berkeley was triumphant. Goldwasser later summarized the panel’s rationale: “Berkeley had made enormous contributions to the field and had a large number of very talented people. If you want to optimize the success of such a large new venture, you have to get the best people to work on it. It could be hoped that differences in management philosophy could later be resolved.”69 As the second priority, the Ramsey Panel recommended that Brookhaven construct the proposed AGS storage rings and begin “intensive design studies” for an accelerator in the 600–1000 GeV range. This recommendation eventually led to the Brookhaven project named ISABELLE, a superconducting colliding-beams accelerator (discussed in chapters 8, 10, and 13).70 The panel also recommended that support be given to Cornell’s 10 GeV machine (whose energy was later increased to 12 GeV) and to the construction of electron-positron storage rings at Stanford. As for MURA’s FFAG, now estimated at $148 million, the panel recommended authorizing it for the energy of 12.5 GeV, instead of the 10 GeV originally proposed, but with the constraint that this project be authorized “without permitting this to delay the steps toward higher energy.”71 The panel spent hours debating its wording on MURA, aware that the recommendation would be controversial and perhaps decisive for the continued existence of the MURA group, which had been working for over ten years to fulfill its dream of bringing a first-rate accelerator to the Midwest. As Ramsey recalled, everyone realized that such an expensive “conditional” choice would not be kept in the current budget, and that the panel’s recommendation was, in fact, the “kiss of death” for MURA.72 The Ramsey Panel also recommended “an administrative structure with national representation to assure that all proposals for qualified scientists shall be considered on equal footing.”73 This recommendation marked a change which would be critical for the future of not only the 36\n\nT H E S E V E R A L H U N D R E D G eV A C C E L E R A T O R\n\nnew laboratory, but also of all large laboratories, including Berkeley and Brookhaven. The goals driving the funding requests to support the recommendations of the Ramsey Panel were, more than any specific scientific discovery, based on continuing willingness by the U.S. government to support physicists in the aftermath of the Second World War. The subsequent Cold War, as historian Silvan Schweber wrote in 1987, then “cemented the wartime relationship.” To the extent that the United States “saw itself in an international technological competition with the Soviet Union,” the country felt compelled to remain ahead of the Soviets in its advanced technology. Science, and especially high-energy physics, with its large accelerators and state-of-the-art electronics, benefited from this conception, as “national security and national prestige became the major determinants for both the size and the pace of growth of the government budgets supporting research and development in general, and the physical sciences in particular.” These sciences were mobilized “in the interests of national security.”74 In this context, Schweber argued, the support of scientists who had been active in research during World War II, especially those who had been associated with the Manhattan Project, including Robert Bacher, I. I. Rabi, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Enrico Fermi, “were some of the most convincing advocates of high-energy physics, and the spectacular flowering of the field owes much to their effectiveness as proponents.” Among the arguments put forth in the 1963 report of the Ramsey Panel was that “it is essential that the United States maintain its leading position in this area which ranks among our most prominent scientific undertakings.”75 It was clear both to Congress and the White House that having the most powerful particle accelerators would yield a strategic advantage. Recently, the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 had revealed how easily the delicate international balance could be upset. And it was known that the Soviet Union, even with its semblance of international cooperation in the 1959 Emelyanov-McCone agreements, was planning to build a 70 BeV proton synchrotron, UNK, in Serpukhov, a project that threatened to wrest the worldwide lead in high energy from the United States. The BOB approved the Ramsey Panel’s recommendations and supported the AEC’s plan to circulate Berkeley’s design study within the community, democratically inviting input. The panel thus opened the door to a more bureaucratic era in accelerator history, in which all proposals for a large project would be circulated beforehand, often in massive detail, before construction could be considered. Once again, the two accelerator laboratories with established reputations had attracted 37\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nthe funding to develop new accelerators. It appeared that tradition would hold and that Berkeley would again lead the way to higher energy. The decision in Berkeley’s favor was not universally applauded. Goldwasser remembers that when Rabi heard the news, there were “tears in his eyes” because he was concerned that under Berkeley’s management the new accelerator would not offer a democratically equitable policy for all qualified users.76 There were definite rumblings, however, about the possibility that the several hundred GeV machine might not be constructed by Berkeley. Ramsey, who had a number of long meetings with McMillan, recalled “warning him” that if Berkeley was too insistent in opposing the required committee with national representation, “there was a high probability that Berkeley would lose the project.”77 Such sentiments would play out in novel ways over the next several years, as the scientists and politicians who were concerned about democratic access to the accelerator or who were disappointed over the loss of MURA would figure critically in the decision to select a Midwestern site for the new laboratory.\n\n38\n\nTHREE\n\nThe Berkeley Design, 1963–1965 The last centuries of science have been marked by an unabating struggle to describe and comprehend the nature of matter, its regularities, its laws, and the language that makes it intelligible. The successes in this struggle, from the Sixteenth Century until our own day, have inspired the whole scientific enterprise, and lighted the world of technology, and the whole of man’s life. They have informed the education and the devotion of young people. They have played an ineluctable part in the growth, the health, the spirit, and the nature of science. We are now, despite tempting and brilliant topical successes, deep in the agony of this struggle.\n\nJ. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER1\n\nSoon many physicists challenged Berkeley’s plan to build the several hundred GeV accelerator. Their sentiments arose partly from long-standing East Coast–West Coast or CoastMidwest scientific rivalries, and partly from the users’ dissatisfaction over limited access to the existing laboratories on both coasts.2 Midwestern political forces during the mid1960s strengthened these challenges with a move to democratize American high-energy physics.\n\nThe Truly National Laboratory Not long after the Ramsey Panel offered its recommendations, the PSAC appointed Myron L. “Bud” Good of the University of Wisconsin to chair a committee of accelerator users authorized to review the Ramsey Panel’s recommendations. Meeting in June of 1963, the Good Panel underscored “the\n\n39\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nneed for emphasizing the national character of new facilities,” stressing that “access should be available not only to the accelerator, but to onsite support activities, and that outside groups should have a voice and responsibility in certain aspects of laboratory management.”3 This facet of the Ramsey Panel’s recommendations was a sticking point for McMillan, who, in adhering to Berkeley’s traditional attitude, downplayed this particular issue. McMillan’s continued resistance to granting such rights to outside users of the proposed several hundred GeV accelerator was an indication of the conflict that would soon erupt between McMillan and his advisory committee. Berkeley’s policy toward outside users dated back to the 1930s, when Lawrence built his laboratory in Berkeley with private funding. Although he accepted requests from outside researchers to conduct experiments using Berkeley’s machines, he solicited these by his invitation. His control of the use of the machines continued even after federal funding began during World War II, to the annoyance of many physicists outside the Berkeley circle.4 When Brookhaven started in 1947, it planned to give access to its Cosmotron to the physicists from the nine member institutions of Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), all in the northeastern United States.5 By the early sixties, the idea of a national laboratory offering open access and other rights to all qualified users, regardless of their home bases, began to gain momentum. In 1962 physicists Edwin Goldwasser from the University of Illinois, Roger Hildebrand from the University of Chicago, and Father Theodore Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame, were among those who promoted the open user access concept in the course of creating the program for Argonne’s new Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS). MURA physicists also joined the campaign.6 The ideal of a laboratory offering democratic outside user rights gained much wider acceptance when Leon Lederman presented the rationale persuasively at a Brookhaven summer study held in June 1963.7 The lively forty-two-year-old physicist from Columbia University, already well known for leading a number of important experiments, had served on both McMillan’s advisory committee and the Good Panel. He objected strongly to Berkeley’s and Brookhaven’s limitations on outside users. At a Brookhaven users’ meeting he presented the argument for an outside-user-friendly laboratory in a paper on the “truly national laboratory” (TNL). The acronym TNL was an intended pun with which Lederman criticized BNL (Brookhaven National Laboratory) for not functioning as a TNL. As Lederman noted, cooperation and enthusiasm for the new facility would be assured only “when it is clear that the new facilities are accessible as a right to any physicist bearing a competitively 40\n\nTHE BERKELEY DESIGN\n\nacceptable proposal.” The ideal laboratory, he said, would have complete on-site facilities for outside users, resources for facilitating individual experiments, an accessible and pleasant site, scheduling and advisory committees to assure fairness in the allocation of beam time, free communication between management and users, and a strong laboratory director “responsible to a governing body of wide national representation.” Unlike BNL, the TNL Lederman described would give young researchers from different parts of the United States equitable access to the highest energies at a facility organized to award beam time according to merit. It would offer good experimental facilities and be a place where users would feel “at home and loved.”8\n\nProgress of Berkeley’s 200 GeV Design Study After being authorized by Congress, Berkeley’s design effort progressed rapidly, with Lofgren serving as director and Lloyd Smith as Lofgren’s assistant. The staff included fifty-five full-time workers, including physicists, engineers, programmers, draftsmen, and other support personnel. Ultimately, more than 130 people contributed to creating the Berkeley design. They were aided by a series of meetings that brought together accelerator experts from Berkeley and Brookhaven, as well as from CERN, where plans were underway for the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), CERN’s 300 GeV strong-focusing synchrotron, which would eventually reach 450 GeV.9 The Berkeley physicists paid special attention to designing the 600– 700 magnets for the main ring of the machine, constructing prototype models and choosing the best injector accelerator. They felt the need to produce a reliable design, for as LBL physicist Denis Keefe later explained, their “feet were being held to the fire.” For greater reliability the selection of a magnet design turned quickly away from the more economical H-shaped magnets to the conventional, but more costly, C-shaped magnets. As for the machine itself, Berkeley initially favored accelerating the beam first in a linear accelerator (Linac) that directly fed its beam into the main synchrotron. But as the studies progressed, the problems of Linac injection appeared increasingly formidable and Sands’s idea of injecting from a booster synchrotron appeared more attractive.10 Despite McMillan’s resistance to the idea of appointing a national advisory committee, he wasted no time fulfilling what he saw as his obligation to do so. On May 10, 1963, he sent Paul McDaniel a suggested list of participants, including candidates from various parts of the 41\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nUnited States: four from the East, four from the West, and two from the Midwest. He explained that all ten had “agreed to serve as such a committee, and have been informed that their appointment is subject to AEC approval.” McDaniel assured McMillan that the AEC would probably approve the list.11 Almost three months later, McMillan submitted the advisory committee charter to the AEC, proposing that the ten-member committee have national representation, be nominated by the Berkeley director, be approved by the AEC, and report to the Berkeley director. The committee would then “set its own agenda” and have the right to “consider all technical, scientific, and administrative matters connected with the high-energy accelerator design study.”12 Back in January 1963, Lofgren had met with McDaniel and other AEC Division of Research staff to discuss guidelines for preparing Berkeley’s final proposal, including cost estimates and the arrangements for obtaining architect-engineering services. On the question of siting, the staff of the AEC Division of Research expressed willingness to work with Berkeley to find a California site. Lofgren mentioned Camp Parks, a 3,636-acre site in the Livermore-Amador Valley, thirty-seven miles from San Francisco. AEC staff member Phillip McGee agreed to inquire whether the site was already earmarked for national defense purposes. The AEC staff advised Berkeley researchers to go through the proper channels but admitted that “some simplification of the procedures may be worked out.” Lofgren thought it likely they would “get a very high degree of cooperation from the Research Division Staff.”13\n\nAn Invitation from the Midwest—MURA Meanwhile, after learning of the Ramsey Panel’s low ranking of the FFAG, MURA physicists threw themselves into an eleventh-hour attempt to save their project. It was easy for MURA to elicit support from Midwestern university presidents, who had nothing to lose and much to gain if a prestigious facility was built in their region.14 Particularly active in the debate were Elvis Stahr, the president of Indiana University, and Bernard Waldman, a physicist at Notre Dame as well as MURA’s staff director. For a long time Waldman had “felt Midwesterners were not getting a fair shake.” After all, the only Midwestern accelerator was Argonne’s weakfocusing 12 GeV ZGS, a project born in the midst of troubles between MURA and Argonne and advanced primarily because of the AEC’s desire to have a machine built to surpass a new 10 GeV Soviet machine. But when the ZGS came online in 1963, its operation was disappointing 42\n\nTHE BERKELEY DESIGN\n\ncompared with the 30 GeV machines at Brookhaven and CERN which had come into operation three years earlier. Waldman “wondered if the Midwest would be a permanent step-child.”15 Midwestern politicians realized the advantages of championing the FFAG. By winning the nearly $150 million project for his constituents, a congressman could promise not only new jobs, but also greater prestige and new industrial opportunities for his district. With the economic recession in 1962, these politicians expressed their long-standing concern about the inequality of geographic distribution of research funding. Minnesota’s Democratic senator Hubert Humphrey was prepared to act on the lack of support for MURA.16 Receiving less funding for research than East and West Coast institutions irked Midwesterners who pointed out that their region included many internationally ranked physicists, such as Enrico Fermi, who was based at Chicago until his death in 1954, and John Bardeen, who in 1951 moved from Bell Laboratories to the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Thanks to Stahr’s efforts during the summer of 1963, President Kennedy received a steady stream of form letters signed by Midwestern congressmen stating that MURA “represents only a crucial first step in restoring the Midwest to its rightful place—along with the East and West Coasts—as a major center for educational research.” Similar letters were sent to the BOB and the AEC. MURA argued that the Midwest deserved a first-class machine and that the FFAG was an innovative design that inspired respect among accelerator specialists.17 But in July 1963, MURA received another jolt when it learned that the majority of the members of the AEC’s General Advisory Committee (GAC) “felt there is not adequate justification at this time for approval of the MURA accelerator construction.” They pointed to the high cost of the machine and to the fact that it would not extend the high-energy frontier.18 While many physicists approved of the FFAG, most felt that if they had to choose between a new high-energy or high-intensity machine, high energy was the choice.19 The GAC’s damning decision placed the AEC in an awkward position. It was time for the AEC’s chairman, Glenn Seaborg, to become more directly involved. Believing in the power of negotiation, Seaborg explored alternative schemes, such as incorporating"
