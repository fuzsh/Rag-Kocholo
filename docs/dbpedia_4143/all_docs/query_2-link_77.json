About 100 times more powerful than the celebrated Hubble Space Telescope, JWST could observe a bumblebee at the Earth-moon distance, in reflected sunlight and thermal emission, and it promises to reveal many wonders of our universe.\n\nEvent\n\n17 May 2023\n\nBooking information:\n\nThis online event will start at 18.00 GMT/13:00 EST on Tuesday 4 April 2023 and will last for approximately one hour.
