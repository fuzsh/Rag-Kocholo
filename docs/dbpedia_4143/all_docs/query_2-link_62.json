        "text": "FNAL Art Image by Angela Gonzales\n\nFrom The DOE’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory-an enduring source of strength for the US contribution to scientific research worldwide.\n\n12.15.23\n\nMitchell Armentrout\n\nAn influential panel of the world’s top particle physicists is recommending exploring building the most powerful collider on Earth to help unwind the universe’s mysteries.\n\nThe deepest mysteries of the universe could be unraveled in suburban Chicago.\n\nThat’s what some of the world’s top minds are aiming for as they lay out a vision for the next generation of particle physicists to take up the quest to better understand our cosmological origins.\n\nAn influential committee of scientists released a report this month suggesting that Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia — known as Fermilab — could play an even bigger role in that quest in the years ahead than it does today as the premier American particle physics testing facility.\n\nResearchers on the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel, or P5, recommended the federal government bolster support for an underground experiment beaming neutrinos from Fermilab more than 800 miles to South Dakota in hopes of figuring out more about those elusive subatomic particles.\n\nThey also called for exploring the possibility of building a revolutionary new particle collider more powerful than any ever created — a groundbreaking device they said would fit perfectly on the Fermilab campus.\n\nThe P5 report also noted the critical computing might of the DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, reinforcing the Chicago area as a hub for the future of particle physics.\n\n“It’s not a coincidence that Chicagoland turned out pretty well in this report,” says University of Chicago astrophysics professor Abigail Vieregg, director of the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics. “The national labs allow us to be strong in this area and have a national presence. I feel fortunate to have Fermilab and Argonne in our backyard.”\n\nVieregg was part of the panel enlisted by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to map priorities for the next decade under different budget scenarios.\n\nAfter a series of public meetings to garner ideas, the panel narrowed their biggest questions — what’s the nature of the Higgs boson, dark matter or neutrinos? — and offered possible paths toward answering them.\n\nAmong their agenda items is reinforcing Fermilab’s Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment with an additional detector to track the particles’ journey across the Midwest.\n\nExperts say neutrinos could be the key missing puzzle piece in explaining why equal amounts of matter and antimatter didn’t annihilate each other when the universe formed in the Big Bang — and therefore how we even exist 13 billion years later.\n\n“The study of the universe on its biggest scales is intricately tied to the smallest scale of the universe,” Vieregg says. “Measurements made in particle colliders can connect directly to the measurements we make looking back in time as we observe the universe.”\n\nWork on DUNE is well underway, but the recommendation to develop a first-of-its-kind particle collider would take decades to materialize.\n\nA muon collider would be more efficient than the proton and electron colliders that researchers now use to race particles around tubes approaching the speed of light, then smashing them together to see what happens — and potentially which other new particles might emerge.\n\nBut muons — pronounced MEW-ons — are fairly elusive themselves, so “it’s up to creative physicists to figure out how we can make this happen,” says Vieregg, who estimates that such a device would be 10 times more powerful than the current standard bearer of the field: the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.\n\nThat device took more than 10 years and $4 billion to build, the cost shared among multiple European nations.\n\nThe P5 report recommends researching and developing a cost estimate and construction timelines for the potential muon collider, with the researchers noting that it would likely be “almost exactly the size of the Fermilab campus.”\n\n“At the end of the path is an unparalleled global facility on US soil,” the researchers wrote. “This is our muon shot.”\n\nNorthwestern University physics and astronomy professor Michael Schmitt says it would be a valuable investment “because that’s the good side of humankind. The desire to understand things is what drives us here. It’s not glory or comfort. We just really want to know why the universe is the way it is. Is there something better we could invest in? Maybe health care, general education. But most people also feel there should be some wonderful things that society does in addition to working on the basic problems of humankind.”\n\nVieregg says developing an unprecedented testing ground could lead to other practical advancements.\n\n“When you’re pushing the boundaries of science and technology — when you’re working in a way most people don’t work — you stumble on things that can be life-changing,” she says.\n\nGeza Gyuk, senior director of astronomy at the Adler Planetarium, compares the pursuit to art.\n\n“It’s delving into something that says something about who we are,” Gyuk says. “It’s learning about where we come from. Why do we make poetry? It doesn’t put food on the table, but it speaks to us in our human nature. It’s what makes us human.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.

Since 2007, Fermilab has been operated by the Fermi Research Alliance, a joint venture of the University of Chicago, and the Universities Research Association. Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor.\n\nFermilab’s Tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator; until the startup in 2008 of the Large Hadron Collider(CH) near Geneva, Switzerland, it was the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, accelerating antiprotons to energies of 500 GeV, and producing proton-proton collisions with energies of up to 1.6 TeV, the first accelerator to reach one “tera-electron-volt” energy. At 3.9 miles (6.3 km), it was the world’s fourth-largest particle accelerator in circumference. One of its most important achievements was the 1995 discovery of the top quark, announced by research teams using the Tevatron’s CDF and DØ detectors. It was shut down in 2011.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n[Earlier than the LHC at CERN, The DOE’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory had sought the Higgs with the Tevatron Accelerator.\n\nBut the Tevatron could barely muster 2 TeV [Terraelectron volts], not enough energy to find the Higgs. CERN’s LHC is capable of 13 TeV.\n\nAnother possible attempt in the U.S. would have been the Super Conducting Supercollider.\n\nFermilab has gone on to become a world powerhouse in neutrino research with the LBNF/DUNE project which will send neutrinos 800 miles to SURF-The Sanford Underground Research Facility in in Lead, South Dakota.\n\n_________________________________\n\n_________________________________\n\nIn addition to high-energy collider physics, Fermilab hosts a series of fixed-target and neutrino experiments, such as The MicroBooNE (Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment),\n\nNOνA (NuMI Off-Axis νe Appearance)\n\nand Seaquest\n\n.\n\nCompleted neutrino experiments include MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search), MINOS+, MiniBooNE and SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment).\n\nThe MiniBooNE detector was a 40-foot (12 m) diameter sphere containing 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1,520 phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events were recorded each year.\n\nSciBooNE sat in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but had fine-grained tracking capabilities. The NOνA experiment uses, and the MINOS experiment used, Fermilab’s NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels 455 miles (732 km) through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota and the Ash River, Minnesota, site of the NOνA far detector.\n\nThe ICARUS neutrino experiment was moved from CERN to Fermilab.\n\nIn the public realm, Fermilab is home to a native prairie ecosystem restoration project and hosts many cultural events: public science lectures and symposia, classical and contemporary music concerts, folk dancing and arts galleries. The site is open from dawn to dusk to visitors who present valid photo identification.\n\nAsteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory.\n\nWeston, Illinois, was a community next to Batavia voted out of existence by its village board in 1966 to provide a site for Fermilab.\n\nThe laboratory was founded in 1969 as the National Accelerator Laboratory; it was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi in 1974. The laboratory’s first director was Robert Rathbun Wilson, under whom the laboratory opened ahead of time and under budget. Many of the sculptures on the site are of his creation. He is the namesake of the site’s high-rise laboratory building, whose unique shape has become the symbol for Fermilab and which is the center of activity on the campus.\n\nAfter Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab, Leon M. Lederman took on the job. It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron, an accelerator capable of colliding protons and antiprotons at a combined energy of 1.96 TeV. Lederman stepped down in 1989. The science education center at the site was named in his honor.\n\nThe later directors include:\n\nJohn Peoples, 1989 to 1996\n\nMichael S. Witherell, July 1999 to June 2005\n\nPiermaria Oddone, July 2005 to July 2013\n\nNigel Lockyer, September 2013 to the present\n\nFermilab continues to participate in the work at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC); it serves as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid and hosts 1000 U.S. scientists who work on the CMS project.\n\nWith the newly completed assembly, the PIP-II team concludes a long process that began in earnest in 2018 with the development of the cryomodule’s design, led by Fermilab. The lab’s earlier development of the lower-frequency SSR1 cryomodule heavily influenced this design.\n\nIn this final section of the linac, these superconducting cryomodules will power beams of protons to the final energy of 800 million electronvolts, or MeV, before the protons exit the linac. From there, the proton beam will transfer to the upgraded Booster and Main Injector accelerators, where it will gain more energy before being turned into a beam of neutrinos. These neutrinos will then be sent on a 1,300-kilometer journey through Earth to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility in Lead, South Dakota.\n\nWith the newly completed assembly, the PIP-II team concludes a long process that began in earnest in 2018 with the development of the cryomodule’s design, led by Fermilab. The lab’s earlier development of the lower-frequency SSR1 cryomodule heavily influenced this design. Completed just before work began on the HB650 cryomodule, the SSR1 cryomodules will make up a different part of the new linac."
