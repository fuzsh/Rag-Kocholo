He claims to do this in order to discover answers to truly fundamental questions, such as the Top Ten Questions about the Universe:\n\n10. What came before the big bang?\n\n9. What is outside the Universe?\n\n8. Where is the center of the Universe?\n\n7. Is there intelligent life elsewhere?\n\n6. Is there intelligent life here?\n\n5. Is there a parallel Universe?\n\n4. Is there a perpendicular Universe?\n\n3. Can you parallel park in a perpendicular Universe?\n\n2. Will the Cubs win the series before the end of time?\n\n1. Are we responsible for this on the final exam?\n\nNews & Highlights"
