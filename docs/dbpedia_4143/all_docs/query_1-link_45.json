        "text": "Introduction to Particle Physics and Cosmology\n\n1st Edition\n\nForthcoming\n\nBy Grant Mathews, Guobao Tang\n\nFebruary 07, 2025\n\nThis textbook provides an accessible introduction to the basic concepts of relativistic cosmology and the standard big bang model of cosmology, along with an introduction to quantum field theory and the standard model of particle physics. Readers are guided through the key concepts associated with ...\n\nNeutrino Physics\n\n3rd Edition\n\nBy Kai Zuber\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nWhen Kai Zuber’s pioneering text on neutrinos was published in 2003, the author correctly predicted that the field would see tremendous growth in the immediate future. In that book, Professor Zuber provided a comprehensive self-contained examination of neutrinos, covering their research history and...\n\nThe Standard Model and Beyond\n\n2nd Edition\n\nBy Paul Langacker\n\nJune 30, 2020\n\nThis new edition of The Standard Model and Beyond presents an advanced introduction to the physics and formalism of the standard model and other non-abelian gauge theories. It provides a solid background for understanding supersymmetry, string theory, extra dimensions, dynamical symmetry breaking, ...\n\nSupersymmetry Beyond Minimality: From Theory to Experiment\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Shaaban Khalil, Stefano Moretti\n\nDecember 12, 2019\n\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most important ideas ever conceived in particle physics. It is a symmetry that relates known elementary particles of a certain spin to as yet undiscovered particles that differ by half a unit of that spin (known as Superparticles). Supersymmetric models now stand ...\n\nPulsars as Astrophysical Laboratories for Nuclear and Particle Physics\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Fridolin Weber\n\nMay 01, 1999\n\nPulsars, generally accepted to be rotating neutron stars, are dense, neutron-packed remnants of massive stars that blew apart in supernova explosions. They are typically about 10 kilometers across and spin rapidly, often making several hundred rotations per second. Depending on star mass, gravity ...\n\nAn Introduction to Beam Physics\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Martin Berz, Kyoko Makino, Weishi Wan\n\nOctober 19, 2016\n\nThe field of beam physics touches many areas of physics, engineering, and the sciences. In general terms, beams describe ensembles of particles with initial conditions similar enough to be treated together as a group so that the motion is a weakly nonlinear perturbation of a chosen reference ...\n\nGroup Theory for the Standard Model of Particle Physics and Beyond\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy Ken J. Barnes\n\nMarch 10, 2010\n\nBased on the author’s well-established courses, Group Theory for the Standard Model of Particle Physics and Beyond explores the use of symmetries through descriptions of the techniques of Lie groups and Lie algebras. The text develops the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to ...\n\nGravitation: From the Hubble Length to the Planck Length\n\n1st Edition\n\nEdited By I. Ciufolini, E. Coccia, V. Gorini, N. Vittorio, R. Peron\n\nOctober 31, 2004\n\nAlthough gravity is the dominant force of nature at large distances (from intermediate scales to the Hubble length), it is the weakest of forces in particle physics, though it is believed to become important again at very short scales (the Planck length). The conditions created in particle ...\n\nThe Mathematical Theory of Cosmic Strings: Cosmic Strings in the Wire Approximation\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy M.R. Anderson\n\nNovember 18, 2002\n\nThis book is a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge about the dynamics and gravitational properties of cosmic strings treated in the idealized classical approximation as line singularities described by the Nambu-Goto action. The author's purpose is to provide a standard reference ...\n\nGeometry and Physics of Branes\n\n1st Edition\n\nEdited By U Bruzzo, V. Gorini, U. Moschella\n\nNovember 05, 2002\n\nBranes are solitonic configurations of a string theory that are represented by extended objects in a higher-dimensional space-time. They are essential for a comprehension of the non-perturbative aspects of string theory, in particular, in connection with string dualities. From the mathematical ...\n\nModern Cosmology\n\n1st Edition\n\nEdited By S Bonometto, V. Gorini, U. Moschella\n\nDecember 01, 2001\n\nCosmology is a relatively new science, but cosmological questions are as old as mankind. Turning philosophical and metaphysical problems into problems that physics can treat, and hopefully solve, has been an achievement of the twentieth century. Modern Cosmology brings together contributions from a...\n\nGravitation and Gauge Symmetries\n\n1st Edition\n\nBy M Blagojevic\n\nOctober 25, 2001\n\nIn the course of the development of electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, the concept of (internal) gauge invariance grew up and established itself as an unavoidable dynamical principle in particle physics. It is less known that the principle of equivalence, and the basic dynamical ..."
