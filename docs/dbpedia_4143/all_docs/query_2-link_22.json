        "text": "Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, U.S. national particle-accelerator laboratory and centre for particle-physics research, located in Batavia, Illinois, about 43 km (27 miles) west of Chicago. The facility is operated for the U.S. Department of Energy by the Universities Research Association, a consortium of 85 research universities in the United States and 4 universities representing Canada, Italy, and Japan. Fermilab was founded in the mid-1960s in response to a 1963 recommendation by the Atomic Energy Commission to build a national particle-accelerator facility to conduct world-class research in nuclear physics. The Batavia site, which extends over 2,800 hectares (6,800 acres), was selected in 1966 and formally occupied in 1968. Fermilab attracts scientists from almost every U.S. state and from 45 countries worldwide for collaborative research into the fundamental nature of matter, the field of subatomic particles.\n\nFermilab’s first particle accelerator was a proton synchrotron, a cyclic accelerator with a ring circumference of 6.3 km (3.9 miles). It began operation in 1972 and could accelerate protons to 400 gigaelectron volts (GeV; 400 billion electron volts). In the 1980s a second and more-powerful particle accelerator, the Tevatron, was constructed in the same tunnel but below the original synchrotron ring.\n\nThe Tevatron was a superconducting synchrotron that took advantage of the higher magnetic-field strengths produced by superconducting magnets to accelerate protons to significantly higher energy levels. The original main ring became part of the preaccelerator injection system for the Tevatron, accelerating particles to 150 GeV and then transferring them to the new superconducting ring for acceleration to 900 GeV. In 1987 the Tevatron began operation as a antiproton colliderproton-—with 900-GeV protons striking 900-GeV antiprotons to provide total collision energies of 1.8 teraelectron volts (TeV; 1.8 trillion electron volts). The original main ring was replaced in 1999 by a new preaccelerator, called the Main Injector, which delivered more-intense beams to the Tevatron and thus increased the number of particle collisions by a factor of 10. The Tevatron was the world’s highest-energy particle accelerator until 2009, when it was supplanted by the Large Hadron Collider of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The Tevatron closed on September 30, 2011.\n\nIn 1977 a Fermilab team led by American physicist Leon Lederman, studying the results of 400-GeV proton-nucleus collisions in the original main ring, discovered the first evidence for the upsilon meson, which revealed the existence of the bottom quark. The bottom quark, the fifth quark to be detected, is a member of the third and heaviest pair of quarks. The companion particle of this pair is the top quark, which is the sixth and most-massive quark; in 1995 it was also discovered at Fermilab. Scientists inferred the existence of the top quark, produced in the Tevatron as a result of 1.8-TeV proton-antiproton collisions, on the basis of its decay characteristics. In 2010, scientists used the Tevatron to detect a slight preference for B-mesons (particles that contain a bottom quark) to decay into muons rather than antimuons. This violation of charge symmetry could lead to an explanation for why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe."
