        "text": "Six College of DuPage students are gaining experience in an emerging global technology market by participating in PACEMAP (Particle Accelerator Capabilities Modernization Apprenticeship Program) at Fermilab, thanks to a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nPACEMAP was created through a partnership between COD’s Project Hire-Ed apprenticeship program and Fermilab. In this multi-year pilot program, students are working with mentors at Fermilab to review workforce needs for FRA (Fermi Research Alliance)/Fermilab Accelerator Directorate and work toward mastering the skills necessary to succeed in a growing technological market.\n\nThe grant, facilitated by COD’s Institutional Advancement Division, provides a monetary stipend and salary so no out-of-pocket costs are incurred by the students. In addition, they will earn two Electronic Technology certificates from COD for participating in the 18-month program.\n\nThe students chosen for PACEMAP are Christian Burnette-Marcus (Naperville), Tim Dickeson (Lisle), Megan Galante (St. Charles), Luis Nevarez (Aurora), Meda Rudokas (Lemont) and KeAndre Worthy (Aurora).\n\nWorthy, who is pursuing a career in electronics, decided to apply for the program as a way to get his foot in the door.\n\n“Fermilab leads the way and utilizes more experimental technologies as opposed to other places and sectors of work, which is far more exciting than other places that rely on the same technology and encounter the same problems,” he said.\n\nBurnette-Marcus is impressed by the opportunity to work at a national laboratory.\n\n“I have always recognized Fermilab as a prestigious organization and one of the best places to work in DuPage County,” he said. “The ability to work hands-on with the research going on there almost sounded too good to be true.”\n\nProject Hire-Ed manager Danielle Kuglin Seago is excited to help students gain relevant experience at a national laboratory.\n\n“Apprenticeship programs are a reliable pathway for training workers from underrepresented populations for good jobs and allow them to earn while they learn,” she said. “PACEMAP will pilot and implement a coordinated school-to-career ecosystem with an apprenticeship model of services and training instruction.”\n\nFermilab is America’s premier laboratory for particle physics and accelerator research, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. Located in Batavia, they are a worldwide leader in the field of particle physics and innovation, with thousands of scientists around the world collaborating with them.\n\nThe apprentices currently are enrolled in the COD course Electronic Documentation and Fabrication and are learning about the basics of electronics manufacturing. They train on through-hole and surface mount soldering, construct a printed circuit board, and interpret technical diagrams and documentation.\n\nAccording to COD instructor Bob Cannella, this training will benefit the students as they embark on their careers.\n\n“There has been a growing need in industry in our area and in the U.S. for people with these types of skill sets,” he said. “Jobs for students with this skill set have increased. The ‘big push’ is to do this type of manufacturing work in the states versus outsourcing them overseas.”\n\nFor Nevarez, the chance to participate in PACEMAP gave him a huge boost.\n\n“I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity. It's much easier to see success in my future now,” he said.\n\nGalante was excited about the options she could consider.\n\n“Something that really piqued my interest about the apprenticeship was the idea of choosing a specialization while I was working at the lab,” she said.\n\nFor Dickeson, his involvement in PACEMAP will provide knowledge and experience upon which he can build a career.\n\n“My ultimate goal is to be an embedded systems engineer, and understanding electronics in an advanced way will certainly transcend my career,” he said. “I believe it will grab a future employer’s attention and will help me be recognized as a strong candidate in the field of electronics.”"
