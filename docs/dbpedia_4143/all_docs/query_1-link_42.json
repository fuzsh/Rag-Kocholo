        "text": "I'm inclined to focus on the Kolb et al paper that came out 14 March\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/hep-th/0503117\n\nPrimordial inflation explains why the universe is accelerating today\n\nEdward W. Kolb, Sabino Matarrese, Alessio Notari, Antonio Riotto\n\n4 pages, one figure\n\nReport-no: FERMILAB-PUB-05-024-A\n\n\"We propose an explanation for the present accelerated expansion of the universe that does not invoke dark energy or a modification of gravity and is firmly rooted in inflationary cosmology.\"\n\nI think the essential ideas are in Kolb et al, and Wiltshire (as I believe he indicates) is picking up the idea from them and calculating some cases. Assuming he first saw the Kolb paper some 10 days ago he has not had much time to revise and correct, so maybe his paper is not in its final form. This does not diminish its value and importance! (but for the time being I'll devote more attention to the predecessor)\n\nto oversimplify Kolb et al say look at this 73% which we need to have a flat universe (at large scale)\n\nwe see the universe is flat so we postulate some \"dark energy\" to be this 73% and fill the hole in our model\n\nwait! they say, suppose there really is this hole. suppose the universe at very large scale IS on average flat and governed by the regular Friedmann eqn we know and love, but suppose our part of the universe is atypically thinned out so that it is matter-lean by the observed 73%\n\nsuppose a primordial quantum uneven-ness made matter (just before inflation) be unevenly distributed-----so our part got only 27% of its fair share (as we observe there is only 27% enough matter to make the universe flat, yet it is flat)-----and then suppose INFLATION expanded all that so the unevenness is now on an immense scale.\n\nOK, this is something that seems like it would leave a signature in the CMB and that one could test by analyzing the CMB better. I am not sure about that but it seems to me that one can derive predictions from that and test it and see how it fits. (and also in principle one can wait until the observable universe is bigger and check then too but that is a long wait)\n\nso this is probably not some fairytale multiverse untestable pipedream but probably a testable hypothesis one can plug into the regular Friedmann equation and see how it fits-------and it doesn't have any acceleration-producing dark energy so it should actually have a very distinctive look.\n\nif I have oversimplified too much please anybody give an improved sketch of their idea\n\nI am going to look and see who Antonio Riotto and Edward Kolb are\n\nAntonio Riotto has 147 papers going back to 1992\n\nEdward Kolb has 64 papers going back to 1992\n\nIn 1996 they were both at Fermilab and they wrote several paper together, so their association goes back at least that far\n\nKolb is still at Fermilab. Riotto is at INFN-Padua.\n\nBoth have published with some wellknown people whose names\n\nany of us would recognize. I didnt happen to know of them---their\n\nnames didnt happen to ring a bell for me, which could just be a glitch in\n\nmy memory\n\nNational Institute of Nuclear Physics\n\n--Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare-sezione di Padova:\n\na branch of INFN connected with the University of Padua\n\nNotari is at McGill, Matarrese is at INFN-Padua\n\n---------------\n\nWe should also plug the University of Canterbury which is where\n\nDavid Wiltshire and Kea are\n\nI have to admire David Wiltshire---he may not have invented this curious no-dark-energy cosmology, but got on it really fast. it looks like he had a paper carrying out calculations with it within 10 days of Kolb et al posting.\n\nthe LQG connection with fluffy cosmology\n\nfor me what seems like a nice thing about the no-dark-energy cosmology notion proposed by Tony Riotto and co-authors (note the outrageous use of nickname, it sounds better)\n\nis the way it fits with Bojowald's quantized Friedmann equation.\n\nthe tony riotto idea is basically standard Freidmann-equation cosmology with inflation----it is rather classical in spirit and doesn't presume a lot of extra dimensions and branes and etc.\n\nbojowald Loop Quantum Cosmology derives from a quantized version of the Friedmann equation (which then turns into a difference equation and doesn't suffer from the classical singularities)\n\nso LQC is very close to the cosmological model that cosmologists are used to working with, and has been around since 1922-1924 when Friedmann wrote it\n\nand a nice thing about LQC is that the quantized Friedmann eqn, now a difference eqn, MAKES INFLATION AUTOMATIC. that is a brief period of inflation with a graceful exit is (as Ganashyam said) \"generic\". it happens without finetuning the parameters, you get it in LQC over a wide range of choices of the details\n\nso LQC seems like a good context in which to look at the Tony Riotto idea,\n\nwhich depends on a quantum fluctuation affecting the energy density (or density of matter) in an instant right before inflation.\n\none might be able to put the quantum geometry together with the\n\nquantum density fluctuation\n\nHere is a recent survey of progress so far in LQC\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0503020\n\nThe Early Universe in Loop Quantum Cosmology\n\nBojowald\n\n10 pages\n\n\"Loop quantum cosmology applies techniques derived for a background independent quantization of general relativity to cosmological situations and draws conclusions for the very early universe. Direct implications for the singularity problem as well as phenomenology in the context of inflation or bouncing universes result, which will be reviewed here. The discussion focuses on recent new results for structure formation and generalizations of the methods.\"\n\nin this paper the form of the Friedmann eqn appears as eqn (1) and the quantized version appears as (13). there is a brief sketch of how to get from one to the other\n\nI see that someone over at SPR just posted this link to a press release\n\nhttp://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/darkenergy_3-16-05.html\n\nthe press item was written by someone in public relations at INFN, in italy.\n\nFermilab just copied the INFN release. this confirms the notion that Tony Riotto is the main author here. padova is the homeplate from which this ball has been hit, so to speak\n\nI am wondering why I haven't seen more discussion. I could find essentially nothing on SPR.\n\nPeter Woit called attention to the Kolb et al paper right around when it came out, IIRC, which would have been around 14 March. I will go back and see if NotEvenWrong blog has some discussion\n\nyeah, this is just another sign of how cool Peter Woit is\n\nhe blogged this immediately, on 16 March\n\nhttp://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/archives/000169.html\n\nthen Sean Carroll blogged it 22 March\n\nhttp://preposterousuniverse.blogspo...erousuniverse_archive.html#111155024666490546\n\nPeter Woit got 21 comments on his 16 March blog, and Sean got 31 comments on his blog a week later.\n\nSean is waving his hands making warning motions about the Kolb et al, which he calls KNMR for the authors' initials. but that is just his gut reaction.\n\nhe linked to this news item in \"the Australian\" which quoted Michael Turner, also shaking his head\n\nhttp://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,12633934%255E29098,00.html\n\nSean also linked to an article in New Scientists\n\nhttp://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7167\n\nthis quotes Robert Brandenburger and also Sean himself\n\n(who says Tony Riotto et al have a good track record, but expresses skepticism)\n\nAs I said earlier Sean Carroll blogged it 22 March\n\nhttp://preposterousuniverse.blogspo...erousuniverse_archive.html#111155024666490546\n\nand so far he got 31 comments (mostly about Kolb et al but) some were about WILTSHIRE paper, which is derived from Kolb.\n\nHere are some comments from Carroll's blog that specifically concern the Wiltshire paper\n\n---quote---\n\nWiltshire's model (gr-qc/0503099) is just weird. General relativity is a complete theory that doesn't obey Mach's principle; you're not allowed to just add Mach's principle to it. And the business about \"true cosmic time\" being set by the unobservable background is just not right. Clocks measure the spacetime interval, and you can always calculate it locally.\n\nSean, Thu, March 24, 2005 @ 10:52 pm\n\nSurely the idea with Wiltshire's work is that CMB defines who the isotropic observers are and the CMB (even as we observe it here in our bubble) defines the true surface of homogeneity in the full universe. So when we put ourselves in the frame that gives an isotropic CMB we are putting ourselves in the full cosmic comoving frame.\n\nNote that Wiltshire has already put out a slightly modified version of his paper after comments from Roy Kerr.\n\nAndreas, Fri, March 25, 2005 @ 3:35 am\n\n---end quote---\n\n[EDIT] Aside from a couple of comments like this i have seen nothing about Wiltshire. By contrast there is tons of comment about the Kolb et al paper. I want to make clear that the Wiltshire paper, which Kea brought up, is a separate issue for me. what I think is important to form an impression of, and read opinion about, is Kolb et al, which seems in a lot of people's opinion to require comment\n\nABOUT THE KOLB ET AL PAPER, [/EDIT]I am beginning to form my own private opinion (which is still kind of on the fence) but still I think it's more my place to register comments by others than contribute my own\n\nHere are some earlier papers by the authors:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/astro-ph/0410541\n\nCosmological influence of super-Hubble perturbations\n\nEdward W. Kolb, Sabino Matarrese, Alessio Notari, Antonio Riotto\n\nFour pages, no figures\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/hep-ph/0409038\n\nEffect of inhomogeneities on the expansion rate of the Universe\n\nEdward W. Kolb, Sabino Matarrese, Alessio Notari, Antonio Riotto\n\n19 pages, 2 figures Version 2 includes some changes in numerical factors and corrected typos. It is the version accepted for publication in Physical review D\n\nJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D71 (2005) 023524\n\n*\n\nChronos said:\n\nIt's not my nature to sit on the fence. I object to absolute time and inserting a Machian interpretation.\n\nI don't know if you noticed but I am discussing the Kolb et al paper.\n\nMy guess is that David Wiltshire is a postdoc at Canterbury NZ and a colleague of Kea, his paper will be getting plenty of criticism from others and will probably undergo further revision.\n\nWhat i would find interesting is if you have any comment specifically directed to the Kolb et al paper.\n\nthis is the one that is getting such a lot of attention in the media and the blogs.\n\nIf you ARE talking about Kolb et al, so that we are not talking at cross purposes, then you may need to help me out: Where, what page, what line, do you find something objectionable in Kolb paper?\n\nWhere exactly do do you find the Mach principle inserted in Kolb et al?\n\nMy take on this is the classical one. Long wave length super Fourier modes is nothing new in cosmology, in the bible for graduate students (Peacock) he talks about this at length in the CMB chapter. So in my opinion this is just trying to revitalize an old idea.\n\nAnyway the usual counter argument about long wave length modes effecting local horizons in a non causal way is that they are distinctive quantum effects, which inflation pushes through superluminally (kinda). Classically you would be right in arguing about causality, but its not so clear in the quantum case (at least to some people). Expectation values can a priori be shown to change. But Caroll is right in another sense, small tensor perturbations tend to preserve their value provided other stress pressure effects are small. An obvious problem again is that there is nothing protecting certain other cherished constants from such effects, and indeed if this scenario is true you would expect it, but I doubt its true, and here's why:\n\nThe fundamental technical issue I have (which I mentioned on Woits blog) is best summarized in chapter 15 of Peacock. Scalar fields are very sensitive to gauge ambiguities in inflationary cosmology. And Kolb explicitly fixes his. This is dangerous because it can obscure obvious problems that might be manifest in a different gauge. The modern approach is to cast your variables in a gauge invariant manner and to explicitly work out the perturbation solutions directly, often with numerical simulation. This paper flat out contradicts those results, and thus I am skeptical.\n\nHaelfix, thanks for taking the time to comment here, I appreciate it.\n\nwhat I think is the crux here (and I wonder if your take on it changes this)\n\nis their Figure 1.\n\nGoing by Figure 1, their model predicts that SNe Ia with redshift almost out to z = 2 should all be dimmer than expected\n\nwith that effect most pronounced in some range like 0.3 < z < 1.3\n\nwhich depends on details\n\nLambdaCDM with Lambda = 0.7 apparently predicts, again going by their figure 1, that the SNe should be dimmer than expected out to around z = 1.3 and then BRIGHTER than expected.\n\nthe way Kolb et al draw the picture, putting in a couple of extra LambdaCDM cases and intentionally or not blurring the distinction by having so many solid and dashed curves, you may not notice that there is a stark contrast between the kind of acceleration that the Lambda model gets and the kind of acceleration that Kolb et al get.\n\nso (although not expert enough to judge) i want to see some real SNe data plotted. this might be a source\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9906463\n\nthis is the article in Science by Steinhardt and others that Kolb cites as their reference [1] \"for a review of the observational evidence for the acceleration of the expansion...see, e.g...\"\n\nI have a notion that one might be able to exclude Kolb et al simply on grounds of giving a bad fit to the supernovae! So I am going to take a look at the Science article\n\n[EDIT] Rats! the Science article has colorful graphically stunning figures that I can't interpret and compare with Figure 1. What I need is a better article about the SNe data[/EDIT]\n\nYeah, look\n\nhttp://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/sne_cosmology.html\n\nabout halfway down the page there is a plot like Kolb figure 1\n\nthat has real data on it as well as theoretical curves\n\nand you can see that the SNe have to be brighter for around z>1.3\n\nKolb doesn't get that. it is a quite noticeable bad fit.\n\nthis ned wright plot is dated July 2003 and he gives his source\n\n---quote from Ned Wright---\n\nThe data points on the above plot are from my binning of the Tonry et al. data table. The binned normal points are\n\n<z> d(DM) sigma\n\n0.0051 -0.228 0.174\n\n0.0105 -0.050 0.088\n\n0.0169 -0.026 0.059\n\n0.0279 0.015 0.044\n\n0.0482 -0.015 0.039\n\n0.0870 -0.008 0.042\n\n0.1955 0.086 0.147\n\n0.3386 0.104 0.097\n\n0.4351 0.246 0.058\n\n0.5069 0.117 0.062\n\n0.6205 -0.027 0.086\n\n0.8210 0.259 0.133\n\n0.9353 -0.101 0.168\n\n1.0560 -0.128 0.270\n\n1.1990 -0.543 0.340\n\n1.7550 -0.448 0.415\n\n---end quote---\n\nyou can see how the data goes negative magnitude (brighter) after around z>1.0\n\nthis is what Kolb model fails to do, it is still positive out to z = 2\n\nthis is disappointing, whatever the theoretical flaws and/or merits might be\n\n[edit] Normanby in the next post is right. Some Kolb curves do go negative before z = 2. But still the fit is not very satisfactory. If they go up then they don't go down enough, if they go down then they didnt go up enough. they are rather flat compared with the ned wright curves and data in the page linked above[/edit]\n\nnormanby25 said:\n\nwhat about the Psi_l0 = -0.5 line. That goes negative around z=1\n\nhello normanby25, welcome. To compare with the Kolb et al Psi = -0.5 curve you mention I want to point to this:\n\nhttp://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/sne_cosmology.html\n\nhalfway down the page there is this figure and there is a\n\nDASHED MAGENTA curve that goes negative right around z = 1.\n\nIt is the best fit to the SNe data of all the curves he shows there.\n\nI am going to compare what you are talking about the \" Psi_l0 = -0.5 line\" to this dashed magenta curve.\n\nthis curve is for a universe with a very slight positive curvature.\n\nso it is not the flat case that people ordinarily make their default one to consider. And it would be a finite universe.\n\nMaybe you are the expert (I just watch cosmology as an onlooker) and you should be telling me all this and more.\n\nand another thing, I suspect that this dashed magenta curve case is using a Omega which is more in the middle of the measured errorbar for Omega, from WMAP. The flat case that people tend to use is more off at one end of the errorbar. It is more comfortable to say 1.00 than to say 1.01, even if the measurements center around 1.01.\n\nnormanby25 said:\n\nwhat about the Psi_l0 = -0.5 line. That goes negative around z=1\n\ni see what you mean. You are talking about Kolb et al\n\nand you refer to their figure 1, and the case Psi = -0.5 which is the\n\nthird solid curve from the top and it does indeed, when i lay a ruler on it, seem to go negative around z = 1.2\n\nit goes up to about +0.05 magnitude around z = 0.4\n\nand it goes negative around z = 1.2 and by z = 2 it is already magnitude increment -0.1\n\nthat is the right kind of behavior but I think that it is a rather flat curve.\n\nit goes up in the right place (but not by much compared with the data) and it goes down in the right place, but again not by much.\n\nlet's compare it with the ned wright plots, like that dash magenta curve is already down at -1.5 at z=2, and the Kolb curve you mention is only down as far as -0.1\n\nand the dash magenta curve at z = 0.4 is up to over +0.2\n\n(where the data says +0.24)\n\nwhile the Kolb et al curve you mention is up to less than +0.05 (hard to measure it is so small)\n\nto summarize, the ned wright curve is 4 times more positive at z = 0.4 and it is 15 times more negative at z = 2\n\ncompared with that Kolb case you mentioned.\n\nbut the Kolb curve is comparatively flat\n\nand the data Ned plots are not so flat\n\nKolb and Riotto answered by Dan Chung\n\nDan Chung has co-authored papers with both Tony Riotto and Ed Kolb. he evidently knows their line of research. Now he has written challenging the latest paper Kolb et al.\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503553\n\nDo Large-Scale Inhomogeneities Explain Away Dark Energy?\n\nGhazal Geshnizjani, Daniel J.H. Chung (UW-Madison), Niayesh Afshordi (Harvard)\n\n4 Pages, no figures\n\n\"Recently, new arguments (astro-ph/0501152, hep-th/0503117) for how corrections from super-Hubble modes can explain the present-day acceleration of the universe have appeared in the literature. However, in this letter, we argue that, to second order in spatial gradients, these corrections only amount to a renormalization of local spatial curvature, and thus cannot account for the negative deceleration. Moreover, cosmological observations already put severe bounds on such corrections, at the level of a few percent, while in the context of inflationary models, these corrections are typically limited to ~ 10^{-5}. Currently there is no general constraint on the possible correction from higher order gradient terms, but we argue that such corrections are even more constrained in the context of inflationary models.\"\n\nmarcus said:\n\nI don't know if you noticed but I am discussing the Kolb et al paper.\n\nMy guess is that David Wiltshire is a postdoc at Canterbury NZ and a colleague of Kea, his paper will be getting plenty of criticism from others and will probably undergo further revision.\n\nWhat i would find interesting is if you have any comment specifically directed to the Kolb et al paper.\n\nthis is the one that is getting such a lot of attention in the media and the blogs.\n\nIf you ARE talking about Kolb et al, so that we are not talking at cross purposes, then you may need to help me out: Where, what page, what line, do you find something objectionable in Kolb paper?\n\nWhere exactly do do you find the Mach principle inserted in Kolb et al?\n\nMy bad, I was still thinking about the Wiltshire paper. So far as Kolb et al goes, I have a hard time picturing what, if any observable consequences would result from super Hubble fluctuations. On the other hand, since they originated, or at least passed through our Hubble bubble, I'm not sure they can be ruled out. My gut feeling is it would show up as inexplicable anisotropies in WMAP data [which appears a possibility] and as anisotropic acceleration in supernova data [which is not apparent].\n\nChronos said:\n\nI don't like superhorizon modes because they are not meaningful in our Hubble bubble.\n\nI think it is not consistent to argue that superhorizon modes cannot exist, if one accepts the standard cosmological model. Superhorizon modes are a natural consequence of inflation and the current model for formation of large scale structure relies on this: Classical perturbations are produced from quantum fluctuations in a de Sitter background by modes with wavelengths larger than horizon size during inflation, which were frozen at a nonzero value and re-entered the horizon after subsequent expansion of space. If superhorizon modes existed then, why shouldn’t they exist now? It seams to me that it would be a coincidence if the production of superhorizon modes had lead to modes which are exactly less of equal to the current Hubble length.\n\nChronos said:\n\nAnd theoretically they appear to be invalid according to more recent sources [see links].\n\nMay be I overlooked this, but I did not find arguments against superhorizon modes in the referenced papers. Could you specify, please?"
