Robert’s earthly temple is now resting in the care of Rowell-Parish Mortuary. Revelations 21:4 says \"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death; nor sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away.\" Be assured that in the days ahead you will surely gain strength from the memories of Mr. Robert Edward Kolb.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDerrick Veasley ~ Director\n\nHenry Veasley ~ Director\n\nPastor E.C. Maltbia ~ Chaplain\n\nRobert Edward Kolb was a gift to Leroy Kolb and Edna Huey on Friday, December 2, 1949 in Fort Smith, Arkansas. He was called into God’s Kingdom on Thursday, March 29, 2021 by the hands of his late wife, Rhonda Kolb and grandson, Shane Fiddlke from Fort Smith, Arkansas.\n\nRobert was a mild-mannered man who enjoyed gardening, wood working, playing guitar, and was always up for a good prank or joke on someone. He was a patient and understanding dad, but could be strong or stern when the moment called for it. He was stubborn, and never afraid to speak what was on his mind. He would always stand for what he believed in, and was never afraid of a fight. He spent 30 years with the Arkansas Department of Transportation and was reported to be \"One hell of a good paint and body man\"."
