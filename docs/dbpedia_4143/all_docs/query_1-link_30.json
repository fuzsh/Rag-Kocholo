        "text": "The Curious Ontology of a Light Higgs Boson\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRiordan, Michael\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWhen the Superconducting Super Collider was being contemplated and designed in the mid-1980s, few high-energy physicists considered it likely that a light Higgs boson, as was eventually discovered at the Large Hadron Collider, would exist. Most theorists expected that the Higgs boson would occur at a mass near the TeV scale, and accelerator physicists designed the Super Collider accordingly. The possibility of a light Higgs boson with a mass less than 200 GeV began to be taken seriously during the 1990s, especially after the 1995 Fermilab discovery of the top quark near 175 GeV, but it was too late to influence the SSC design. With a peak collision energy of 40 TeV, this collider was guaranteed to discover the Higgs boson -- or whatever other mass-generating phenomenon might be occurring in the Standard Model -- even if it were to appear at masses or energies up to 2 TeV. As it turned out, therefore, the SSC was overdesigned for its principal physics goal. A substantially smaller Fermilab project known as the Dedicated Collider, which never made it beyond the drawing boards, could probably have allowed the 125 GeV Higgs boson to be discovered at least a decade earlier than it occurred at the LHC.\n\nFermilab Today - Troubleshooting\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nSearch GO Troubleshooting for Fermilab Today Fermilab Today is distributed via e-mail each morning by the same program.

G.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe biggest problem those attempting to understand econometric data, via modeling, have is that economics has no F = ma. Without a theoretical underpinning, econometricians have no way to build a good model to fit observations to. Physicists do, and when F = ma failed, we knew it. Still desiring to comprehend econometric data, applied economists turn to mis-applying probability theory---especially with regard to the assumptions concerning random errors---and choosing extremely simplistic analytical formulations of inter-relationships. This introduces model bias to an unknown degree. An applied physicist, used to having to match observations to a numerical or analytical model with a firm theoretical basis, modify the model, re-perform the analysis, and then know why, and when, to delete ``outliers'', is at a considerable advantage when quantitatively analyzing econometric data. I treat two cases. One is to determine the household density distribution of total assets, annual income, age, level of education, race, and marital status. Each of these ``independent'' variables is highly correlated with every other but only current annual income and level of education follow a linear relationship. The other is to discover the functional dependence of total assets on the distribution of assets: total assets has an amazingly tight power law dependence on a quadratic function of portfolio composition.

This program builds on the work we have done to successfully run experimental workflows of 1000-VM scale both on an on-site private cloud and on Amazon AWS. To do this at scale we deployed dynamically launched and discovered caching services on the cloud. We are now testing the deployment of more complicated services on Amazon AWS using native load balancing and auto scaling features they provide. ThemoreÂ Â» Virtual Facility Project will design and develop a facility including infrastructure and services that can live on the site of Fermilab, off-site, or a combination of both.

Careers in finance typically offer intellectual challenge, a fast pace, high caliber colleagues, merit-based compensation with substantial upside, and an opportunity to deploy skills learned as a physicist. Physicists are employed at a wide range of financial institutions on both the ``buy side'' (hedge fund managers, private equity managers, mutual fund managers, etc.) and the ``sell side'' (investment banks and brokerages). Historically, physicists in finance were primarily ``quants'' tasked with applying stochastic calculus to determine the price of financial derivatives. With the maturation of the field of derivative pricing, physicists in finance today find work in a variety of roles ranging from quantification and management of risk to investment analysis to development of sophisticated software used to price, trade, and risk manage securities. Only a small subset of today's finance careers for physicists require the use of advanced math and practically none provide an opportunity to tinker with an apparatus, yet most nevertheless draw on important skills honed during the training of a nuclear physicist. Intellectually rigorous critical thinking, sophisticated problem solving, an attention to minute detail and an ability to create and test hypotheses based on incomplete information are key to both disciplines.\n\nFermilab Friends for Science Education Store\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nitems mugs t-shirts posters sweatshirts for sale Fermilab logo items, mugs, t-shirts, sweatshirts and posters for sale.

The LCLS-II linac will consist of thirty-five 1.3 GHz and two 3.9 GHz superconducting RF continuous wave (CW) cryomodules that Fermilab and Jefferson Lab (JLab) will assemble in collaboration with SLAC. The LCLS-II 1.3 GHz cryomodule design is based on the European XFEL pulsed-mode cryomodule design with modifications needed for CW operation. Fermilab and JLab will each assemble and test a prototype 1.3 GHz cryomodule to assess the results of the CW modifications, in advance of 16 and 17 production 1.3 GHz cryomodules, respectively. Fermilab ismoreÂ Â» solely responsible for the 3.9 GHz cryomodules. After the prototype cryomodule tests are complete and lessons learned incorporated, both laboratories will increase their cryomodule production rates to meet the challenging LCLS-II project requirement of approximately one cryomodule per month per laboratory. This paper presents the Fermilab Cryomodule Assembly Facility (CAF) infrastructure for LCLS-II cryomodule production, the Fermilab prototype 1.3 GHz CW cryomodule (pCM) assembly and readiness for production assembly.Â«Â less\n\nFermilab | Tritium at Fermilab | Indian Creek Results\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media media Video of shutdown event Guest book Tevatron Impact June 11, 2012 About the symposium Symposium Links Home Contact Phone Book Fermilab at Work For Industry Jobs Interact Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nFermilab | Tritium at Fermilab | Indian Creek Results\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media media Video of shutdown event Guest book Tevatron Impact June 11, 2012 About the symposium Symposium Home Contact Phone Book Fermilab at Work For Industry Jobs Interact Facebook Twitter Instagram Google\n\nFermilab | Science at Fermilab | Computing | Grid Computing\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media media Video of shutdown event Guest book Tevatron Impact June 11, 2012 About the symposium Symposium Book Fermilab at Work For Industry Jobs Interact Facebook Twitter Instagram Google+ YouTube Flickr\n\nFermilab | Visit Fermilab | Tours, Programs and Events\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media media Video of shutdown event Guest book Tevatron Impact June 11, 2012 About the symposium Symposium Quick Links Home Contact Phone Book Fermilab at Work For Industry Jobs Interact Facebook Twitter\n\nFermilab | Science at Fermilab | Computing | Mass Storage\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media media Video of shutdown event Guest book Tevatron Impact June 11, 2012 About the symposium Symposium Cookies Quick Links Home Contact Phone Book Fermilab at Work For Industry Jobs Interact Facebook Twitter\n\nData preservation at the Fermilab Tevatron\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nAmerio, S.; Behari, S.; Boyd, J.; ...\n\n2017-01-22\n\nThe Fermilab Tevatron collider's data-taking run ended in September 2011, yielding a dataset with rich scientific potential.

FIFE is a collaborative effort between experimenters and computing professionals to design and develop integrated computing models for experiments of varying size, needs, and infrastructure. The major focus of the FIFE project is the development, deployment, and integration of solutions for high throughput computing, data management, database access and collaboration management within an experiment. To accomplish this goal, FIFE has developed workflows that utilize Open Science Grid compute sites alongmoreÂ Â» with dedicated and commercial cloud resources. The FIFE project has made significant progress integrating into experiment computing operations several services including a common job submission service, software and reference data distribution through CVMFS repositories, flexible and robust data transfer clients, and access to opportunistic resources on the Open Science Grid. The progress with current experiments and plans for expansion with additional projects will be discussed. FIFE has taken the leading role in defining the computing model for Fermilab experiments, aided in the design of experiments beyond those hosted at Fermilab, and will continue to define the future direction of high throughput computing for future physics experiments worldwide.Â«Â less\n\nFermilab | Tritium at Fermilab | Tritium in Surface Water\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media media Video of shutdown event Guest book Tevatron Impact June 11, 2012 About the symposium Symposium Home Contact Phone Book Fermilab at Work For Industry Jobs Interact Facebook Twitter Instagram Google\n\nFermilab | Tritium at Fermilab | Tritium in Sanitary Sewers\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media media Video of shutdown event Guest book Tevatron Impact June 11, 2012 About the symposium Symposium Home Contact Phone Book Fermilab at Work For Industry Jobs Interact Facebook Twitter Instagram Google\n\nPhysics History Books in the Fermilab Library\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSara Tompson.\n\nFermilab is a basic research high-energy physics laboratory operated by Universities Research Association, Inc. under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Fiscal year 2015 represents the first full year of LDRD at Fermilab and includes seven projects approved mid-year in FY14 and six projects approved in FY15. One of the seven original projects has been completed just after the beginning of FY15. The implementation of LDRD at Fermilab is captured in the approved Fermilab 2015 LDRD Annual Program Plan. In FY15, the LDRD program represents 0.64% of Laboratory funding. The scope of the LDRD program at Fermilab will be established over the next couple ofmoreÂ Â» years where a portfolio of about 20 on-going projects representing approximately between 1% and 1.5% of the Laboratory funding is anticipated. This Annual Report focuses on the status of the current projects and provides an overview of the current status of LDRD at Fermilab.Â«Â less\n\nFermilab | Tritium at Fermilab | Ferry Creek Results\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nnewsletter Ferry Creek Results chart This chart (click chart for larger version) shows the levels of tritium following the detection of low levels of tritium in Indian Creek in November 2005.

Wester\n\nAfter initiation by the Fermilab Laboratory Director, a team from the senior Laboratory leadership and a Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Advisory Committee developed an implementation plan for LDRD at Fermilab for the first time. This implementation was captured in the approved Fermilab 2014 LDRD Program Plan and followed directions and guidance from the Department of Energy (DOE) order, DOE O 413.2B, a âRoles, Responsibilities, and Guidelines, â¦â document, and examples of best practices at other DOE Office of Science Laboratories. At Fermilab, a FY14 midyear Call for Proposals was issued. A LDRD Selection Committee evaluated those proposals thatmoreÂ Â» were received and provided a recommendation to the Laboratory Director who approved seven LDRD projects. This Annual Report focuses on the status of those seven projects and provides an overview of the current status of LDRD at Fermilab. The seven FY14 LDRD approved projects had a date of initiation late in FY14 such that this report reflects approximately six months of effort approximately through January 2015. The progress of these seven projects, the subsequent award of six additional new projects beginning in FY15, and preparations for the issuance of the FY16 Call for Proposals indicates that LDRD is now integrated into the overall annual program at Fermilab. All indications are that LDRD is improving the scientific and technical vitality of the Laboratory and providing new, novel, or cutting edge projects carried out at the forefront of science and technology and aligned with the mission and strategic visions of Fermilab and the Department of Energy.Â«Â less\n\nFermilab History and Archives Project | Golden Books - The Early History of\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFermilab History and Archives Project Home About the Archives History and Archives Online Request Contact ; - The Early History of URA and Fermilab Fermilab Golden Book Collection main page Click on Image for Larger View The Early History of URA and Fermilab Viewpoint of a URA President (1966-1981) Norman F\n\nFermilab Library\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nBook Newsroom Newsroom News and features Press releases Photo gallery Fact sheets and brochures Media Big Bang.

Nevertheless, Fermilab`s long tradition of operating a strong, diverse physics program depends not only on collider physics but also on effective use of the facilities the Laboratory was founded on, the fixed-target beamlines. In this talk the author presents highlights of the Fermilab fixed-target program from its (not too distant) past, (soon to be) present, and (hopefully, not too distant) future program. The author concentrates on those experiments which are unique to the fixed-target program, in particular hadron structure measurements which usemoreÂ Â» the varied beams and targets available in this mode and the physics results from kaon, hyperon and high statistics charm experiments which are not easily accessible in high p{sub T} hadron collider detectors.Â«Â less\n\nThe Fermilab Connection\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFermilab\n\nMore than 4,000 scientists in 53 countries use Fermilab and its particle accelerators, detectors and computers for their research.

A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCurrent and future Fermilab experiments such as Minerva, NOÎ½A, and MicroBoone are now using an improved version of the Fermilab SAM data handling system. SAM was originally used by the CDF and D0 experiments for Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron to provide file metadata and location cataloguing, uploading of new files to tape storage, dataset management, file transfers between global processing sites, and processing history tracking. However SAM was heavily tailored to the Run II environment and required complex and hard to deploy client software, which made it hard to adapt to new experiments. The Fermilab Computing Sector hasmoreÂ Â» progressively updated SAM to use modern, standardized, technologies in order to more easily deploy it for current and upcoming Fermilab experiments, and to support the data preservation efforts of the Run II experiments.Â«Â less\n\nStrategic directions of computing at Fermilab\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWolbers, Stephen\n\n1998-05-01\n\nFermilab computing has changed a great deal over the years, driven by the demands of the Fermilab experimental community to record and analyze larger and larger datasets, by the desire to take advantage of advances in computing hardware and software, and by the advances coming from the R&D efforts of the Fermilab Computing Division. The strategic directions of Fermilab Computing continue to be driven by the needs of the experimental program. The current fixed-target run will produce over 100 TBytes of raw data and systems must be in place to allow the timely analysis of the data. The collider run II, beginning in 1999, is projected to produce of order 1 PByte of data per year. There will be a major change in methodology and software language as the experiments move away from FORTRAN and into object-oriented languages. Increased use of automation and the reduction of operator-assisted tape mounts will be required to meet the needs of the large experiments and large data sets. Work will continue on higher-rate data acquisition systems for future experiments and projects. R&D projects will be pursued as necessary to provide software, tools, or systems which cannot be purchased or acquired elsewhere. A closer working relation with other high energy laboratories will be pursued to reduce duplication of effort and to allow effective collaboration on many aspects of HEP computing.\n\nSearch Fermilab Insect Database\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\ndata reflects observations at Fermilab.

In this report, the members of the Task Force describe the process they used to gather and analyze information on all aspects of the proposed accelerator and its potential location at Fermilab in northern Illinois. They present the conclusions and recommendations they reached as a result of the learning process and their subsequent discussions and deliberations.moreÂ Â» While the Task Force was charged to provide guidance on the ILC, it became clear during the process that the high cost of the proposed accelerator made a near-term start for the project at Fermilab unlikely. Nevertheless, based on a year of extensive learning and dialogue, the Task Force developed a series of recommendations for Fermilab to consider as the laboratory develops all successor projects to the Tevatron. The Task Force recognizes that bringing a next-generation particle physics project to Fermilab will require both a large international effort and the support of the local community. While the Task Force developed its recommendations in response to the parameters of a future ILC, the principles they set forth apply directly to any large project that may be conceived at Fermilab, or at other laboratories, in the future. With this report, the Task Force fulfills its task of guiding Fermilab from the perspective of the local community on how to move forward with a large-scale project while building positive relationships with surrounding communities. The report summarizes the benefits, concerns and potential impacts of bringing a large-scale scientific project to northern Illinois.Â«Â less\n\nExploring Sea Quark EMC Effect and Anti-Shadowing Through Drell-Yan at SeaQuest / Fermilab E906\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDannowitz, Bryan; Fermilab E906 / SeaQuest Collaboration\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFermilab E906/SeaQuest is a fixed-target experiment that uses the 120 GeV Main Injector proton beam.

A survey was sent to a randomly selected sample of 1511 medical physicists from July through October 2001 using primarily e-mail methods; a total of 851 surveys was received, for a response rate of 56%. Of these, 427 were responses from physicists who do partly or only clinical diagnostic medical physics; it is this group for which results are presented. Fifty-four percent of the physicists who reported doing any clinical diagnostic medical physics performed clinical activities only in diagnostic medical physics. Fourteen percent of all those doing clinical diagnostic medical physics were women. Over 97% of the physicists doing clinical diagnostic medical physics reported having graduate degrees in physics; 53% had PhDs. The mean total weekly hours worked by physicists doing clinical diagnostic medical physics was 42. Medical physicists doing only clinical diagnostic activities reported working approximately 40 hours weekly, whereas those doing partly clinical diagnostic medical physics reported working 14 hours weekly in the field (approximately one-third of their work time). Radiography and fluoroscopy, computed tomography, nuclear medicine, and mammography are all fields in which the majority of those doing any clinical diagnostic medical physics are active. Full-time physicists working only in diagnostic medical physics were responsible for a median of 25 units of equipment, compared with a median of 10 units for those working only partly in the field. Number of units evaluated, frequency of evaluation, and hours per evaluation were reported for almost 20 types of equipment.

To better serve this community, in 2004, the (then) Computing Division undertook the strategy of placing all of the High Throughput Computing (HTC) resources in a Campus Grid known as FermiGrid, supported by common shared services. In 2007, the FermiGrid Services group deployed a service infrastructure that utilized Xen virtualization, LVS network routing and MySQL circular replication to deliver highly available services that offered significant performance, reliability and serviceability improvements. This deployment was further enhanced through the deployment of a distributed redundant network core architecture and the physical distribution of the systems that host the virtual machines across multiple buildings on the Fermilab Campus. In 2010, building on the experience pioneered by FermiGrid in delivering production services in a virtual infrastructure, the Computing Sector commissioned the FermiCloud, General Physics Computing Facility and Virtual Services projects to serve as platforms for support of scientific computing (FermiCloud 6 GPCF) and core computing (Virtual Services).

Medical physics specialties include radiation therapy physics, medical diagnostic and imaging physics, nuclear medicine physics, and medical radiation safety. The majority of AAPM members are based in hospital departments of radiation oncology or radiology and provide technical support for patient diagnosis and treatment in a clinical environment. Job functions include support of clinical care, calibration and quality assurance of medical devices such as linear accelerators for cancer therapy, CT, PET, MRI, and other diagnostic imaging devices, research, and teaching. Pathways into a career in medical physics require an advanced degree in medical physics, physics, engineering, or closely related field, plus clinical training in one or more medical physics specialties (radiation therapy physics, imaging physics, or radiation safety).

We propose an integrable Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (iRCS) as a replacement for the Fermilab Booster to achieve multi-MW beam power for the Fermilab high-energy neutrino program. We provide amoreÂ Â» overview of the machine parameters and discuss an approach to lattice optimization. Integrable optics requires arcs with integer-pi phase advance followed by drifts with matched beta functions. We provide an example integrable lattice with features of a modern RCS - long dispersion-free drifts, low momentum compaction, superperiodicity, chromaticity correction, separate-function magnets, and bounded beta functions.Â«Â less\n\nGrids, virtualization, and clouds at Fermilab\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nTimm, S.; Chadwick, K.; Garzoglio, G.; ...\n\n2014-06-11\n\nFermilab supports a scientific program that includes experiments and scientists located across the globe. To better serve this community, in 2004, the (then) Computing Division undertook the strategy of placing all of the High Throughput Computing (HTC) resources in a Campus Grid known as FermiGrid, supported by common shared services. In 2007, the FermiGrid Services group deployed a service infrastructure that utilized Xen virtualization, LVS network routing and MySQL circular replication to deliver highly available services that offered significant performance, reliability and serviceability improvements. This deployment was further enhanced through the deployment of a distributed redundant network core architecture andmoreÂ Â» the physical distribution of the systems that host the virtual machines across multiple buildings on the Fermilab Campus. In 2010, building on the experience pioneered by FermiGrid in delivering production services in a virtual infrastructure, the Computing Sector commissioned the FermiCloud, General Physics Computing Facility and Virtual Services projects to serve as platforms for support of scientific computing (FermiCloud 6 GPCF) and core computing (Virtual Services). Lastly, this work will present the evolution of the Fermilab Campus Grid, Virtualization and Cloud Computing infrastructure together with plans for the future.Â«Â less\n\nFermilab Education High School Tours\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nthree weeks before the date of the tour using the tour request form.

It was also the first US/USSR collaboration in particle physics as well as the first experiment that can be confidently characterized as megascience. The experimental data were interpreted as an indication of the pomeron, a quasiparticle that had been named after the Soviet theorist I. Pomeranchuk. The idea of the experiment can be traced back to the Rochester conference held in 1970 in Kiev where two American and Soviet physicists met to develop it and later acquainted NAL director Robert Wilson with it. Wilson enthusiastically set the stage for the experiment at NAL. Involving a gas-jet target built at the Dubna machine shop of Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and brought to Batavia, Illinois, the experiment established cooperation between the US and the Soviets in the spirit of their contemporary Apollo-Soyuz space program, thus breaking the ice of the Cold War from within high-energy physics. In this talk based on the Fermilab Archives and interviews, we discuss the financial and administrative obstacles raised by Soviet officials that the Russian collaborators had to overcome, interinstitutional tensions among the Soviets that accompanied the collaboration, NAL culture as well as the roles of scientists in megascience as ambassadors of peace.\n\nFermilab | Science | Historic Results\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nquark since the discovery of the bottom quark at Fermilab through fixed-target experiments in 1977.

These discoveries in the field of cosmic-ray physics were made by the innovation of nuclear emulsion techniques in Japan. A pair of naked charm particles was discovered in 1971 in a cosmic-ray interaction, three years prior to the discovery of the hidden charm particle, J/Î¨, in western countries. Lifetime differences between charged and neutral charm particles were pointed out in 1975, which were later re-confirmed by the collaborative Experiment E531 at Fermilab. Japanese physicists led by K.Niu made essential contributions to it with improved emulsion techniques, complemented by electronic detectors. This review also discusses the discovery of artificially produced naked charm particles by us in an accelerator experiment at Fermilab in 1975 and of multiple-pair productions of charm particles in a single interaction in 1987 by the collaborative Experiment WA75 at CERN.

Under this definition, a large fraction of physicists are hidden, that is, they have left, or never belonged to, the traditional lot of Ph.D. academicians. Data from the Statistical Research Center at the American Institute of Physics and from a survey of members of the national physics honor society, Sigma Pi Sigma, show the vast array of actual career paths taken by physicists. From spandex to blackberries to bioinformatics to flight control to wind energy to spintronics, physicists can be found in nearly every job sector in some of the coolest and most farfetched careers imaginable.\n\nSome Interesting Data About Women Physicists in Cuba (abstract)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Fuentes, Olimpia Arias\n\n2009-04-01\n\nAlthough the number of women physicists in Cuba, as in the entire world, is less than men physicists, their presence in the academic leadership is strong, unlike the limited women's role in many other countries.

FIFE is a collaborative effort between experimenters and computing professionals to design and develop integrated computing models for experiments of varying needs and infrastructure. The major focus of the FIFE project is the development, deployment, and integration of Open Science Grid solutions for high throughput computing, data management, database access and collaboration within experiment. To accomplish this goal, FIFE has developed workflows that utilize Open Science Grid sites along with dedicated and commercial cloud resources. The FIFE project has made significant progress integrating into experiment computing operations several services including new job submission services, software and reference data distribution through CVMFS repositories, flexible data transfer client, and access to opportunistic resources on the Open Science Grid. The progress with current experiments and plans for expansion with additional projects will be discussed. FIFE has taken a leading role in the definition of the computing model for Fermilab experiments, aided in the design of computing for experiments beyond Fermilab, and will continue to define the future direction of high throughput computing for future physics experiments worldwide.\n\nTowards Commissioning the Fermilab Muon G-2 Experiment\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStratakis, D.; Convery, M.

The proportion of female physics master's degree recipients is approximately 30%, while the percentage of female physics PhD recipients is 50%. Still, only a few female physicists occupy top positions in research laboratories, institutes, or universities. The basic problem for career-oriented female physicists in Belarus is public opinion, which cultivates a passive and dependent life philosophy for women. The Belarusian Women in Physics group was formed in 2003 as part of the Belarusian Physical Society.\n\nExtending DART to meet the data acquisition needs of future experiments at Fermilab\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOleynik, G.; Pordes, R.; Barsotti, E.\n\n1995-10-01\n\nThe DART project at Fermilab is a major collaboration to develop a data acquisition system for multiple experiments. The initial implementation of DART has concentrated on providing working data acquisition systems for the (now eight) collaborating experiments in the next Fixed Target Run. In this paper we discuss aspects of the architecture of DART and how these will allow it to be extended to meet the expected needs of future experiments at Fermilab. We also discuss some ongoing developments within the Fermilab Computing Division towards these new implementations.\n\nThe new g-2 experiment at Fermilab\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnastasi, A.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThere is a long standing discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction for the muon g-2 and the value measured by the Brookhaven E821 Experiment. At present the discrepancy stands at about three standard deviations, with an uncertainty dominated by the theoretical error. Two new proposals - at Fermilab and J-PARC - plan to improve the experimental uncertainty by a factor of 4, and it is expected that there will be a significant reduction in the uncertainty of the Standard Model prediction. I will review the status of the planned experiment at Fermilab, E989, which will analyse 21 times more muons than the BNL experiment and discuss how the systematic uncertainty will be reduced by a factor of 3 such that a precision of 0.14 ppm can be achieved.\n\nAccelerator-based Neutrino Physics at Fermilab\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDukes, Edmond\n\n2008-10-01\n\nThe discovery of neutrino mass has excited great interest in elucidating the properties of neutrinos and their role in nature. Experiments around the world take advantage of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator sources of neutrinos. Accelerator-based sources are particularly convenient since their parameters can be tuned to optimize the measurement in question. At Fermilab an extensive neutrino program includes the MiniBooNE, SciBooNE, and MINOS experiments. Two major new experiments, MINERvA and NOvA, are being constructed, plans for a high-intensity neutrino source to DUSEL are underway, and an R&D effort towards a large liquid argon detector is being pursued. The NOvA experiment intends to search for electron neutrino appearance using a massive surface detector 811 km from Fermilab. In addition to measuring the last unknown mixing angle, theta(13), NOvA has the possibility of seeing matter-antimatter asymmetries in neutrinos and resolving the ordering of the neutrino mass states.\n\nPerpendicular Biased Ferrite Tuned Cavities for the Fermilab Booster\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRomanov, Gennady; Awida, Mohamed; Khabiboulline, Timergali\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe aging Fermilab Booster RF system needs an upgrade to support future experimental program. The important feature of the upgrade is substantial enhancement of the requirements for the accelerating cavities. The new requirements include enlargement of the cavity beam pipe aperture, increase of the cavity voltage and increase in the repetition rate. The modification of the present traditional parallel biased ferrite cavities is rather challenging. An alternative to rebuilding the present Fermilab Booster RF cavities is to design and construct new perpendicular biased RF cavities, which potentially offer a number of advantages. An evaluation and a preliminary design of themoreÂ Â» perpendicular biased ferrite tuned cavities for the Fermilab Booster upgrade is described in the paper. Also it is desirable for better Booster performance to improve the capture of beam in the Booster during injection and at the start of the ramp. One possible way to do that is to flatten the bucket by introducing second harmonic cavities into the Booster. This paper also looks into the option of using perpendicularly biased ferrite tuners for the second harmonic cavities.Â«Â less\n\nPhysicists' Forced Migrations under Hitler\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeyerchen, Alan\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in early 1933 they initiated formal and informal measures that forced Jews and political opponents from public institutions such as universities. Some physicists retired and others went into industry, but most emigrated. International communication and contact made emigration a viable option despite the desperate economic times in the Great Depression. Another wave of emigrations followed the annexation of Austria in 1938. Individual cases as well as general patterns of migration and adaptation to new environments will be examined in this presentation. One important result of the forced migrations was that many of the physicists expelled under Hitler played important roles in strengthening physics elsewhere, often on the Allied side in World War II.\n\nPhysicists and Astronomy--Will You Join the Dance?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHarwit, Martin\n\n1981-01-01\n\nFocuses on past achievements of physicists beginning with the discovery of gaseous nebulae and listing seven commonly found characteristics of this and other observational discoveries which can foster further discovery.

However, precise definitions and observational markers remain elusive. We reinterpret popular beliefs inventories in physics to indicate what physicists think thinking like a physicist entails. Through discourse analysis of upper-division students' speech in natural settings, we show that students may appropriate or resist these elements. We identify a new element in the physicist speech genre: brief, embedded, spontaneous metacognitive talk (BESM talk). BESM talk communicates students' in-the-moment enacted expectations about physics as a technical field and a cultural endeavor. Students use BESM talk to position themselves as physicists or nonphysicists. Students also use BESM talk to communicate their expectations in four ways: understanding, confusion, spotting inconsistencies, and generalized expectations.\n\nFermilab Muon Campus g-2 Cryogenic Distribution Remote Control System\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPei, L.; Theilacker, J.; Klebaner, A.\n\n2015-11-05\n\nThe Muon Campus (MC) is able to measure Muon g-2 with high precision and comparing its value to the theoretical prediction. The MC has four 300 KW screw compressors and four liquid helium refrigerators. The centerpiece of the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab is a large, 50-foot-diameter superconducting muon storage ring. This one-of-a-kind ring, made of steel, aluminum and superconducting wire, was built for the previous g-2 experiment at Brookhaven. Due to each subsystem has to be far away from each other and be placed in the distant location, therefore, Siemens Process Control System PCS7-400, Automation Direct DL205 & DL05moreÂ Â» PLC, Synoptic and Fermilab ACNET HMI are the ideal choices as the MC g-2 cryogenic distribution real-time and on-Line remote control system.

This resource has grown to include networking resources, lists of LGBT-friendly universities and localities, recommendations for enacting positive change in physics communities, and out-reach to other STEM-oriented LGBT organizations. This has been possible in large part by the dynamic community of LGBT+ physicists and allies looking to make physics more welcoming towards our community. In 2011, Elena used hir position as Member at Large on the executive committee of the Forum of Graduate Student Affairs (FGSA) to conduct a climate survey that included, among other things, the first serious look at LGBT+ demographics in physics. The survey focused particularly on issues of language heard and harassment experienced by physicists and was broken down into categories based on race, physical and mental ability, gender, and sexuality. Furthermore, it examined the outcomes of experienced harassment and the reasons for when harassment was not reported. Due to the nature of the study, overlapping demographics, especially ``multiple minorities,'' were also explored. This talk will give a brief history of the LGBT+ Physicists resource as well as an overview of the FGSA study.\n\nBOOK REVIEW: Great Physicists - The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCropper, William H.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nThe author, a former American chemistry professor, has organized his book into nine parts with 29 chapters, covering, in a fairly historical sequence and systemtic conceptual progression, all fundamentals of today's physics: i.e., mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, relati"
