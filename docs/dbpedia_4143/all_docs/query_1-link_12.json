        "text": "Form follows function’ explains why giraffes have long necks, bird and airplane wings are airfoil-shaped, the fronts of bullet trains are tapered, and syringes are pointed. Darwin made the case for genetic selection by relating the different forms of beaks to the different kinds of seeds the birds must pick. At the level of cells, neurons have evolved to assemble long shafts called axons to connect to other neurons, immune cells form protrusions that look like suction cups to engulf pathogens and other cells, and blood cells are biconcave disks to optimize the surface to volume ratio, allowing gases to effectively diffuse in and out of them. Cells change their shapes on the time scale of seconds to adapt to different functional tasks. Since microscope allowed taking looks at cells in tissues, pathologists have exploited cell shape for diagnosis and stratification of disease. The tight association between cell morphotype and function has gained even more in significance with the growing number of examples where machine learning derives from the morphology predictions not only of cell behavior but of genetic and molecular states. Regardless of whether the connection between morphology and cell state is analyzed by human or machine, these analyses place the morphotype implicitly or explicitly at the end of a regulatory chain. Our recent work begins to indicate that cell shape is not at the end, but at the outset or in the middle of the chain. Shape controls the physical and chemical processes that must ensue for a cell to do the right thing. Hence, ‘function follows form’. We are particularly interested in this reversal of the ‘form follows function’ paradigm in the context of cancer. We find that cancer cells control through shape how they survive, proliferate and metabolize in hostile environments. These discoveries have been enabled by twenty years of innovation in microscopy, computer vision, and biophysical modeling to quantify with high resolution the interplay between cell shape and molecular action that governs function.\n\nGaudenz Danuser is appointed at the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, TX, where he served as the Chair of the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics and the Director of the Cecil H. and Ida Green Center or for Systems Biology. He started his academic career as a Master student in Geodynamics at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where he wrote one of the first software packages for earthquake prediction from differential GPS measurements of tectonic movements. After a brief period in industry, he earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, also from ETH Zurich, working on developing a computer vision system to control the action of a nanorobot. Through this work he became interested in the information theoretical principles of resolution in light microscopy. During a visit at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, he learned about the Green Fluorescent Protein and the opportunities the cloning of this molecule lent to the visualization of proteins in living cell. He realized the transformative potential such experiments would offer to cell biologists, but also the enormous data analysis challenges this technology would bring upon the life science community. Thus, he moved to Woods Hole for his postdoc to start working on the application of computer vision to live cell movies. The guiding thread through his career has been to make discoveries by computer vision of molecular and cellular mechanisms that are inaccessible by human observation. He and his lab mates have contributed models of cell migration, cell division, molecular trafficking, and chemical signaling to the field of cell biology. The most recent work leverages these models to understand the mechanisms of cancer cell adaptation. Before moving to Dallas, he held faculty positions at ETH Zurich, The Scripps Research Institute, and Harvard Medical School. He is a passionate educator who enjoys experimenting with new didactic formats.\n\nWatch the video\n\nOn Friday, May 17, 2019, Kennedy Reed from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory joined us to present \"Physics in Africa.\"\n\nPhysicists in African universities are confronted with daunting challenges in their efforts to train students and conduct research. Many of them are well trained and highly motivated scientists who have chosen to work toward building physics programs in their home countries - in spite of difficult circumstances and meager resources.\n\nScience and technology can play an important role in addressing the critical needs of developing nations in Sub-Saharan Africa. But support for advanced education and research in the physical sciences is very limited in these countries. A few international organizations have programs that provide some level of support for physics in developing regions, including Africa. There have also been some efforts to encourage scientific links between physicists in Africa and physicists in other parts of the world.\n\nThis presentation will discuss some of my experiences working as a visiting scientist in African universities. It will also cover some work directed at promoting collaborations and exchanges that connect African scientists and institutions with their counterparts in the U.S. and other developed countries. Such interactions may prove to be important elements in the development of science and technology in Africa. They might also provide opportunities for scientists in other regions to benefit from the expertise and resourcefulness of African physicists.\n\nWatch the video\n\nOn Friday, April 20, 2018, Laura H. Greene, Marie Krafft Professor of Physics at Florida State University and Chief Scientist of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory joined us to present \"The Dark Energy of Quantum Materials.\"\n\nSuperconductivity is a fascinating quantum mechanical phenomenon with applications that include the lossless transmission of electrical power, levitating trains, making huge magnetic fields, and detecting the tiniest magnetic fields. Conventional superconductivity was discovered in 1911 but the theoretical explanation did not come until 1957. High temperature superconductivity, discovered in 1986, is unconventional and we still don't have a theory that explains it. There are dozens of other types of unconventional superconductors that we cannot explain. In my lecture, I will explore superconductivity and the bizarre behaviors of quantum materials, showing some of the exciting applications. I will explain in simple terms what we do know, and give a perspective on how much we still have to learn. Superconductivity reminds me of the universe itself: we use it every day, it's very useful, and mostly, we don't know very much about it.\n\nRead more on Wikipedia\n\nVisit Laura's professional home page\n\nWatch the video\n\nOn Monday, May 4, 2015, Howard Stone, Donald R. Dixon ’69 and Elizabeth W. Dixon Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, joined us to present \"Fascination with Fluids and Flows.\"\n\nFluid mechanics is often viewed as a mature scientific discipline. One of the remarkable aspects of the subject is its relevance to an enormous variety of phenomena. The designs of airplanes, sailing vessels, birds, insects, and fish are all largely determined by principles of fluid mechanics. The physiology of our bodies is impacted by fluid dynamics principles, whether we consider the movement of red blood cells that squeeze through the small capillaries of the microcirculation or the delivery of drugs orally or in the blood stream. Almost all industrial processing requires handling materials in the fluid state, whether we are making large meter-scale sheets of glass for the world’s skyscrapers or depositing thin, submicrometer thick films for coatings and lithographic processes. At the largest scales of life on earth we need to understand the fluid movements of air in the atmosphere, water in the oceans, and ice sheets in the arctic regions. Thus, the eternal relevance of fluid mechanics is linked to understanding all of life’s processes, spanning those that are natural, industrial, and planetary. The subject is also one with continual surprises that provide intellectual challenges and important bridges to other disciplines. We will illustrate some of these themes by (I) highlighting the effect of fluid motion on biofilms, (ii) new observations on the impact of flow on the motility of bacteria on surfaces, and (iii) surprising features of flow in a T-junction, which is perhaps the most common element in many piping systems. In this way we will gain exposure to a world of ideas relevant to industry, physiology, and environmental health.\n\nWatch the video\n\nOn Friday, November 12, 2010, Taekjip Ha, Professor of Physics and Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, joined us to present \"Single Molecule Nanometry for Biological Physics.\"\n\nPrecision measurement is a hallmark of physics but the small length scale (~nanometer) of elementary biological processes and the thermal fluctuations surrounding them challenge our ability to visualize the motion of biological molecules. In this talk, I will highlight the recent developments in single molecule nanometry where a position of a single fluorescent molecule can be determined with a single nanometer precision, reaching the limit imposed by the shot noise. The relative motion between two molecules can be determined with ~0.3 nm precision at ~ 1 milliseconds time resolution, providing fundamental insights on how motor proteins move on cellular highways. Finally, I will show our recent progress in combining angstrom scale optical tweezers with single molecule fluorescent detection, opening new avenues for multi-dimensional single molecule nanometry for biological physics.\n\nProfessor Taekjip Ha received his Ph.D. in Physics in 1996, from the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to joining the Physics faculty at the University of Illinois in August 2000, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (1997) and a postdoctoral research associate in Steven Chu's laboratory in the Department of Physics at Stanford University (1998-2000). He was named 2001 Searle scholar. In 2005, Dr. Ha was named an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In 2008, Dr. Ha was selected by the National Science Foundation to receive a grant to establish and co-direct the Center for the Physics of Living Cells at the University of Illinois.\n\nProfessor Ha has achieved many \"firsts\" in experimental biological physics--the first dectection of dipole-dipole interaction (fluorescence resonance energy transfer, or FRET) between two single molecules; the first observation of \"quantum jumps\" of single molecules at room temperature; the first detection of the rotation of single molecules; and the first detection of enzyme conformational changes via single-molecule FRET. His most recent work, using single-molecule measurements to understand protein-DNA interactions and enzyme dynamics, has led him to develop novel optical techniques, fluid-handling systems, and surface preparations.\n\nWatch the video\n\nOn March 2, 2000, Arthur J. Freeman, Morrison Professor of Physics, Northwestern University joined us joined us to present \"A New Age of Computational Materials Science: A Scientific Revolution Unfolds.\"\n\nThe Ages of Civilization have been defined by the particular new materials that have been mastered. More than ever, advances in materials are driving far reaching developments in all aspects of our society. It is now widely recognized that computational modeling and simulation are spearheading the unfolding of a new scientific revolution brought about by (i) the dramatic advances in condensed matter theory, especially electronic structure theory (now formally acknowledged with the award of a Nobel Prize for density functional theory to Walter Kohn in 1998), and (ii) their successful application to real materials problems made possible by utilizing the continued explosive growth of computer power. We will demonstrate how the well recognized goal driving computation physics - simulations of ever-increasing complexity on more and more realistic models - has been brought into greater focus with the introduction of massively parallel computer platforms. These simulations of now serve to fill the increasingly urgent demands of scientists and engineers. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the power of this advanced methodology for treating the structural, electronic, magnetic, optical and mechanical properties of real life.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 2, 1999, Ted Geballe, Emeritus Professor of Applied Physics and of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University joined us to present \"Magnetic and Superconducting Materials: The Old and the New.\"\n\nMagnetic materials have been known since antiquity. Many creative, romantic (but unscientific) ideas were invoked over the ensuing centuries to explain the mysterious forces of the lodestone. Not until the discoveries of quantum mechanics in the late 1920\"s that it was possible to reach a scientific understanding of most magnetic metals and magnetic insulators, and then it took only a short time to do so. However there exists a class of materials, which strangely enough includes lodestone, where the electrons responsible for the magnetism cannot be described as tightly bound (as in insulators) or nearly free (as in metals) which are not well understood. Superconductivity in contrast to ancient magnetism is a discovery of the 20th century which was made almost immediately following the liquefaction of helium gas, although from what we now know it could have been discovered in the liquid nitrogen available in the previous century. Until recently magnetism and superconductivity, for well understood reasons, were found to be almost mutually exclusive. In the past decade a deep and not-yet-satisfactorily-understood relationship between the two has emerged from studies of transition metal oxides in the same regime mentioned above where the electrons cannot be described in simple local or itinerant terms, but rather are highly correlated. The major frontier of condensed matter science today is the study of materials in which the electrons are highly correlated, particularly the colossal magnetoresistance manganites and the high temperature superconducting cuprates I will give examples from ongoing intensive world wide efforts."
