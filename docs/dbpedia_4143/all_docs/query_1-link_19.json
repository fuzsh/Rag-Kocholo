        "text": "View: Tell us about the once and future place of the ALS in the world of synchrotron radiation facilties.\n\nKirz: While Daniel is recuperating I have been called to fill in for a year. The ALS, under Daniel’s leadership, has become a remarkable user facility, such a remarkable organization, in fact — with superbly qualified deputy directors, a highly motivated scientific staff, and, furthermore, a spirit of service to the user community — that it really doesn’t need me.\n\nAt the same time, my job description is to put together the next strategic plan for the Advanced Light Source. That involves input from the stakeholders: the users, the staff, the Science Advisory Com-mittee, and of course the program managers at DOE. The ALS is now 11 years old, the leading facility in its energy range. We want to make sure it remains the leading facility for decades.\n\nView: What are the first steps in that process?\n\nKirz: To stay at the cutting edge, we are upgrading the machine itself. Currently the machine is operating in the traditional fashion, where you inject electrons every eight hours. Part of the current is lost with time, and by eight hours later you have only half the value you injected. So we are going into “top-off” operation, in which a little bit of current is injected twice a minute, keeping the current constant in the ring. Top-off is going to greatly improve the stability of the beam.\n\nPresently the beam cannot be made as bright as it could be, in order to minimize the rate at which the current decays. Once we go to top-off, we can squeeze down on the beam and improve the brightness by more than an order of magnitude. We’ll be able to build new beamlines that take advantage of these new capabilities.\n\nView: What other improvements are in the works?\n\nKirz: Something we refer to as the “slicing source” is going to start operating this coming calendar year. At present the electron beam is in bunches about 80 picoseconds (trillionths of a second) long. People are interested in much shorter pulses, so we’ll be taking a small piece of this 80-picosecond bunch and separating it from the rest. We can use that very short piece, only a few hundred femtoseconds (quadrillionths of a second) long, to probe the structure of materials.\n\nAt least some of the new facilities will use the coherence of the highly collimated beams that come out of the undulators at the ALS. Scientific lasers are brighter, but lasers typically don’t exist in the far ultraviolet and soft x-ray range, where the ALS excels. With these capabilities we’ll be able to help the Molecular Foundry characterize the nanostructures that will be synthesized and fabricated there, as they are being made.\n\nView: What else is on the list of to-dos?\n\nKirz: Safety! You are aware that the Stanford accelerators are shut down. We don’t want to be shut down. We are reexamining everything we do with safety in mind.\n\nWe have a very good safety record; our EH&S people are very strong. But we have a whole lot of lasers, and lasers are dangerous. We have a whole lot of electrical equipment. We are producing ionizing radiation. And we have to keep on top of the chemicals and biological materials our users bring in and make sure they are safely handled.\n\nThere are walk-arounds on the floor on a regular basis. There are safety circles that meet frequently. The Laboratory just instituted new regulations restricting — sharply restricting — work that involves live electric circuits, so-called “hot” work, the source of the accident at Stanford. This is clearly something that is high priority for DOE — and it better be high priority for us.\n\nView: Tell us a bit about your own scientific work at the ALS.\n\nKirz: Actually, I’m the first person in this office who has an active experimental program at the ALS. My collaborators and I have been developing what is essentially a form of microscopy. Instead of forming an image directly, using a lens, we record the diffraction patterns of an object such as a biological cell.\n\nWe can only record the intensity of the diffraction pattern; we lose the phase. But if we record this in sufficient detail, it can be reconstructed to show the structure of the object. The diffraction pattern is not just a bunch of spots, as it is in the case of a crystal. It’s a continuous pattern, sort of like a speckle pattern from a laser.\n\nSince we have a continuous diffraction pattern, we can sample the intensity on a fine grid. That gives us the additional information we can use to make the reconstruction. We don’t compete with other imaging techniques like electron microscopes, but electron microscopes are mostly restricted to specimens less that a micron thick. Most biological cells are more than a micron thick. Getting information from the entire cell is the goal.\n\nOur technique was first proposed by my friend and collaborator David Sayre in 1980. We first demonstrated it in 1999 at the National Synchro-tron Light Source. But this work requires coherent illumination, and ALS beamline 9.0.1 — designed by Malcolm Howells for related work by a group from Arizona State, Livermore, and Berkeley Lab — is the best beamline currently available. That’s why we are here."
