        "text": "History of Research with Alaska Native and American Indian People\n\nThe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (P.L. 93-638) codified self-determination of Alaska Native and American Indian peoples by giving Tribes and Tribal organizations the authority to contract directly with the federal government for health and education grants and thereby exercise greater control over their own welfare (Jones, 2006; Rhoades & Rhoades, 2014; Sherry, 2004). In addition to exercising the right to own and manage federally funded health services and programs under this process of self-governance (Barnard, 2015; Charlesworth, Jamieson, Davey, & Butler, 2015; Chino & Dubruyn, 2006; Gottlieb, 2013; Rajaram et al., 2014), many Tribes and Tribal organizations have established policies governing research with Alaska Native and American Indian community members (Chino & DeBruyn, 2006; Ferreira & Gendron, 2011; Jetter, Yarborough, Cassady, & Styne, 2015; Kelley, Belcourt-Dittloff, Belcourt C., & Belcourt G., 2013).\n\nResearch studies have concluded that Alaska Native and American Indian people distrust research (Buchwald et al., 2006; Christopher, 2005; Manson, Garroutte, Goins, & Henderson, 2004). Contributions to this distrust are multi-faceted and are intertwined with distrust of federal and other non-Native organizations, given their history of forced assimilation, discrimination, and other mistreatment. Alaska Native and American Indian people and communities have experienced harmful research, view most research as benefiting researchers but not Alaska Native and American Indian individuals or communities, and find sharing research results with respondents and communities lacking or unsatisfactory (Harding et al., 2012; Hiratsuka, Brown, Hoeft, & Dillard, 2012; Williams et al., 2010). Two research studies in Alaska are cited as examples of research that harmed the Alaska Native Community and breached the trust between researchers and community members: the Alaskan I131 experiment and the Barrow Alcohol Study, both described in Dillard et al (2018).\n\nSCF Research Review approval is a multi-step process that starts at the conception of the research project and continues through dissemination of project findings. Each step in the review process can take two to four months. These steps are listed in the SCF Research Review Tracker. Keep in mind these steps are sequential, rather than concurrent. In other words, approval at Step 1: Concept Proposal is required prior to initiating Step 2: Alaska Area Indian Review Board.\n\nAt each step, you will receive an update via letter or email, notifying you of the project’s approval status and indicating the next step.\n\nEach group in SCF Research Review ensures research meets the following criteria:\n\nProject is research, as defined in the Definition of Research Questions.\n\nThe Alaska Native and American Indian Community is recognized as a unit of identity.\n\nResearch will build on the strengths and resources within the community.\n\nCollaborative partnerships are facilitated in all phases of the research.\n\nKnowledge and action are integrated for benefit, for science, and for Alaska Native people.\n\nResearch is a co-learning and empowering process that attends to social inequalities.\n\nResearch involves a cyclical, iterative process.\n\nResearch addresses health from positive and ecological perspectives.\n\nFindings and knowledge gained are disseminated to all partners.\n\nTo submit for SCF Research Review please email SCFResearchReview@southcentralfoundation.com.\n\nStep 1. Concept Proposal Approval – Submit the following documents to SCFResearchReview@southcentralfoundation.com:\n\nConcept Proposal Summary Form\n\nRequirements of Researchers Form\n\nStep 2. AAIRB Approval – Once your concept proposal is approved by SCF you will need to obtain approval from the Indian Health Service AAIRB. Include a copy of your concept proposal approval letter from SCF when submitting your application.\n\nFor more information on the AAIRB submission process, please contact the AAIRB office at:\n\nPhone: (907) 729-3924\n\nE-mail: aka-alaskaareaIRB@anthc.org\n\nStep 3. Privacy Consultation – If AAIRB requires you to complete a privacy consult, please contact SCF at (907) 729-4200.\n\nStep 4. Proposal Approval – Once you have completed the previous steps, submit the following documents to SCFResearchReview@southcentralfoundation.com:\n\nProposal Summary Form\n\nRequirements of Researchers Form\n\nStep 5. SCF Research Agreement\n\nOnce all committees have reviewed your proposal, you will receive an SCF approval letter and the SCF Research Terms and Conditions form.\n\nEmail the completed Research Terms and Conditions form to SCFResearchReview@southcentralfoundation.com.\n\nStep 6. Conduct Research – Once all previous steps have been successfully completed, you may begin your research.\n\nStep 7. Provide Annual Study Update – Each year your project is open we ask that you please complete an annual update. Please submit the AAIRB Status Report and Renewal Application form to SCFResearchReview@southcentralfoundation.com.\n\nStep 8. Obtain approval for dissemination of findings – At the end of your project before any results are shared, please submit the following documents to SCFResearchReview@southcentralfoundation.com:\n\nSCF Abstracts, Manuscript, Final Report Summary Form\n\nRequirements of Researchers Form"
