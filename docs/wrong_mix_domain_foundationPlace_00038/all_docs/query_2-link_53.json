M. Russell Region. Since the early 1990s, the C. M. Russell Region acted primarily as a re-granting organization for pass-through funds from MCF to 501c3s in a nine county area. GFACF has changed its mission and focus and now serves as a community foundation for the Great Falls area. We believe a community foundation, as a permanent source of funding, is a community’s savings account preserved in an endowment. GFACF makes grants from its distributable funds and is a way for donors to invest in the community to help them meet their charitable goals.\n\nGood Works\n\nBecause the Great Falls Area Community Foundation believes that a visioning process is fundamental to community change and growth, GFACF provides leadership opportunities and matching funding to assist in Leadership Great Falls Class projects. LGF is a comprehensive training program sponsored by the Great Falls Area Chamber of Commerce. Its purpose is to educate and motivate existing and potential leaders by encouraging community involvement for the betterment of the community.\n\nThe VISION GREAT FALLS XPO LGF 2009 class project gathered support, participation and input from existing community programs, leaders, and residents regarding community vision. They brought together all the ideas and concepts they found and through Vision XPO provided a forum for moving the ideas beyond concepts to actions benefiting our community.\n\nGFACF provided matching funds for the Leadership Great Falls project to fund My Student in Need, a local charity that works with teachers to make sure school children have their needs for school supplies, clothing, and other items fulfilled.\n\nAnother grant was to the Upper Missouri River Heritage Area Planning Corporation for matching funds to complete the feasibility study for the Heritage Area, which would promote economic development and tourism in Central Montana.\n\nThe GFACF has provided grants to local nonprofits to improve our community and support the arts, culture, human needs, economic development, and education."
