        "text": "Glen Canyon National Recreation Area encompasses more than 1.25 million acres in northern Arizona and southeastern Utah. The recreation area includes portions of Garfield, Kane, San Juan, and Wayne counties in Utah and Coconino County in Arizona. The park’s southern boundary runs contiguous to lands of the Navajo Nation for almost 500 miles. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area shares boundaries with other national park system units, including Grand Canyon National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Rainbow Bridge National Monument. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area adjoins approximately 9.3 million acres of other federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Vermilion Cliffs National Monument, and the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness. The park staff consults regularly with the Hopi Tribe, Kaibab Paiute Tribe, Navajo Nation, Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, Pueblo of Zuni, San Juan Southern Paiute, and Ute Mountain Ute in areas of mutual interest.\n\nRainbow Bridge National Monument was established in 1910 to protect a large and exceptionally scenic natural bridge and its surrounding area. At 160 acres, the monument is bounded by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and the Navajo Nation lands. Rainbow Bridge is sacred to several American Indian tribes, including the Hopi Tribe, Kaibab Paiute Tribe, Navajo Nation, San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, Pueblo of Zuni, and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe (White Mesa Band). The stone arc of Rainbow Bridge is composed of Navajo sandstone on a base of Kayenta sandstone. Rainbow Bridge spans 275 feet, reaching a height of 290 feet above Bridge Creek and ranging from 33 to 42 feet thick. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Rainbow Bridge National Monument are managed as one unit; therefore, they are both included in this foundation document.\n\nGlen Canyon National Recreation Area and Rainbow Bridge National Monument are both units of the national park system. While they are designated a national recreation area and a national monument respectively, both are equal units within the diverse park system. Individual units of the park system are commonly referred to as “parks” even if their designation is something other than national park. In 1970, Congress elaborated on the 1916 National Park Service Organic Act, saying that all units of the system possess equal legal standing in a national system. Consequently Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Rainbow Bridge National Monument are managed consistent with the law and policies that apply to all national park units.\n\nGlen Canyon and Rainbow Bridge are located in a geographic area commonly referred to as the Colorado Plateau. This desert region is characterized by expansive areas of exposed and uplifted rocks that have been carved by the Colorado River and several tributaries. Lake Powell, formed by the impounded waters of the Colorado River above the Glen Canyon Dam, is the best known and most visited feature at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) manages the Glen Canyon Dam. The surrounding desert landscape and river corridors also provide a wide range of recreational opportunities and provide habitat for a diverse assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic species.\n\nInterpretive themes are often described as the key stories or concepts that visitors should understand after visiting a park—they define the most important ideas or concepts communicated to visitors about a park unit. Themes are derived from, and should reflect, park purpose, significance, resources, and values. The set of interpretive themes is complete when it provides the structure necessary for park staff to develop opportunities for visitors to explore and relate to all park significance statements and fundamental and other important resources and values.\n\nInterpretive themes are an organizational tool that reveal and clarify meaning, concepts, contexts, and values represented by park resources. Sound themes are accurate and reflect current scholarship and science. They encourage exploration of the context in which events or natural processes occurred and the effects of those events and processes. Interpretive themes go beyond a mere description of the event or process to foster multiple opportunities to experience and consider the park and its resources. These themes help explain why a park story is relevant to people who may otherwise be unaware of connections they have to an event, time, or place associated with the park.\n\nThe following interpretive themes have been identified for Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.\n\nThe land and water features of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area provide a remarkable variety of opportunities to satisfy our hunger for adventure, discovery, and recreation.\n\nThe dramatic landscape of Glen Canyon lays bare the geological portrait of Earth, which reveals the ancient history of rock, water, and life on the Colorado Plateau with nearly limitless opportunities for research and personal revelation.\n\nFrom the first native peoples to contemporary societies, thousands of years of human history along the Colorado River illuminates the intricate web of relationships between peoples, their interaction with the landscape, and the results that shape cultural exchange, create conflict, achieve progress, command choice, and deliver consequences.\n\nEnvironments within Glen Canyon remind us that much of life is hidden to casual observation—and entice us to slow our pace and more intimately observe the subtle intricacies and adaptations of both plant and animal communities.\n\nThe following interpretive themes have been identified for Rainbow Bridge National Monument:\n\nRainbow Bridge is one of the largest known natural bridges in the world, a symbol of strength, balance, and change that spans geologic time.\n\nFor many indigenous peoples in the Four Corners region, Rainbow Bridge is a spiritually occupied landscape that is inseparable from their cultural identities and traditional beliefs.\n\nEven in a landscape of dramatic and distinctive features, the immense presence of Rainbow Bridge often inspires the strong desire to both see and protect it.\n\nThough remote and in some ways difficult to access, the uniqueness of Rainbow Bridge has inspired many people over time to make the journey and experience its grandeur.\n\nWilderness maintains ecological systems that are substantially free from the effects of modern civilization.\n\nGlen Canyon’s somewhat barren-looking landscape belies the wealth of life within. Biodiversity abounds on the macro and micro scale, from the movement of migratory species through the canyon to the microcosm of soil crusts and water pockets. Northern desert shrub associations, typified by communities of sagebrush, shadscale, blackbrush, saltbush, and rabbitbrush, occupy broad valleys, slopes, mesa tops, and low hills. Pinyon-juniper woodlands vary from extensive and continuous forests to scattered stands interspersed with desert shrubs along the higher mesas and slopes where the soil is rocky or sandy. Communities of cottonwood, willow, and saltcedar border waterways and sandy washes. Some of the largest hanging gardens in the world suspend a rich variety of luxuriant plants from seeps on steep canyon walls. Areas devoid of vascular-plant groundcover often harbor a well-developed “cryptogamic earth” composed of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses that form a distinctive irregular surface crust. This unique crust stabilizes soil, improves percolation, decreases erosion from winds and torrential summer rains, and contributes to nutrient cycling (particularly nitrogen) and the organic content of the surface soil.\n\nThese environments support diverse populations of small mammals, birds, and reptiles throughout the wilderness. Pinyon jays, loggerhead shrikes, mocking birds, canyon wrens, Gambel quail, chukar partridges, turkey vultures, crows, magpies, and ravens represent some of the more common bird species found here year-round. More transient waterfowl such as the mallard, shoveler, cinnamon teal, great blue heron, snowy egret, and American merganser may frequent this area too. Today, this wilderness is home to more than 40 rare and endemic plant and animal species as well as several federally listed endangered species. Glen Canyon, with its tributary side canyons and adjacent plateaus and mesas, supports some of the last relict bighorn herds, which were once abundant throughout the state. Predators such as the bobcat, mountain lion, gray fox, badger, kit fox, and coyote range widely, especially in the winter months when conditions in the low country are more favorable for their prey. Topographic diversity and abundance of prey throughout the wilderness offer prime habitat for red-tailed hawks, prairie and peregrine falcons, golden and northern bald eagles, and burrowing owls. The Escalante River, one of the last intact small river riparian ecosystems in the Southwest, still boasts an extensive Fremont cottonwood-Goodding willow community. Located in the darkest corners of the state, the Utah portions of this wilderness are protected from the impacts of light pollution and silence envelops the landscape in winter months. The diverse environments of this wilderness are substantially free from the effects of modern humans.\n\nUnfortunately, forces largely beyond the control of the land manager threaten to erode the natural quality of this wilderness. Anthropogenic activity in this area has greatly reduced the numbers and ranges of native animals. Issues with air quality and nonnative invasive species are significant concerns. Nonnative plant species such as tamarisk, Russian olive, and Ravenna grass have invaded riparian ecosystems and crowd out native species. Thousands of acres of grazing allotments within the wilderness exacerbate and accelerate erosion, and disturb fragile flora. Wild burros and horses in the San Juan unit have a similar impact. Bighorn sheep reintroduction efforts in the immediate vicinity of Glen Canyon can impact natural predator/prey relationships within the wilderness. Reduced river flows below the Glen Canyon dam affect the development of beaches and riparian ecosystems. The existence of Quagga mussels in Lake Powell threatens the health of all water bodies in the wilderness. Mining districts outside the wilderness boundaries threaten the community of life within the wilderness.\n\nWilderness is essentially unhindered and free from modern human actions that control or manipulate the community of life.\n\nHistorically, the immensity of this region prevented people from significantly affecting ecological systems within the wilderness. Although the occasional ruin or petroglyph suggests former human occupation, the environment remained unmanipulated. Those same systems are preserved today by their inaccessibility. This region contains some of the last lands in the contiguous United States to be explored and mapped by modern people. In fact, the Escalante River was the last river of its size to be discovered. This leaves little opportunity for modern people to have directly manipulated the environment and its community of life.\n\nThe Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness is largely unmanipulated, unrestrained, self-willed, and wild. The agency exhibits restraint and humility in making decisions that affect the community of life inside the wilderness. Animal populations that are managed, such as bighorn sheep and beavers, are controlled outside the wilderness. Waterways in the wilderness are allowed to flow freely and sometimes excessively when summer storms dominate the climate. The occasional, if not rare, wildfire is allowed to burn unrestrained in wilderness.\n\nHowever, in some cases the land manager may decide that controlling or manipulating certain aspects of the environment within the wilderness is necessary for preserving other qualities of wilderness character. For example, the health of the Escalante River corridor is compromised by the spread of Russian olive, a nonnative invasive plant species. Other nonnative invasive plants threaten upland regions of the wilderness. Treatment and removal of these species is the primary concern for the degradation of the untrammeled quality in this wilderness. Ranching operations also significantly affect the landscape. Authorized grazing allotments are generally associated with developments that alter hydrology that require regular maintenance. Fortunately, rugged terrain limits the extent of these operations.\n\nWilderness retains its primeval character and influence, and is essentially without permanent improvements or modern human occupation.\n\nThe Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness embodies the Wilderness Act’s definition of undeveloped as “a place where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.” The amenities often found in some national park units are rare here. Most of the wilderness can be accessed outside of the park’s primary fee stations. Many of the roads that lead to these areas are remote, undeveloped, and difficult to travel, requiring high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Once leaving the trailhead, if there is one, it is possible to walk for days without seeing the imprint of another boot. A visitor would be hard pressed to find modern developments in this wilderness. In fact, the presence of a pictograph panel or Ancestral Puebloan ruin may be the only evidence that you were not the first person to walk in this place. Most wilderness explorers would consider this to be an exciting discovery that heightens their wilderness experience rather than a degradation of the undeveloped quality.\n\nThreats to the undeveloped quality of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness lie primarily in the administrative actions to protect other wilderness qualities. For example, signs may be used to identify restoration areas or protect cultural resources, and motorized equipment such as chainsaws may be used where necessary to combat invasive species. These instances are generally localized and temporary and therefore have a minimal impact onthe undeveloped quality of wilderness character. On the other hand, motorized equipment and mechanical transportation are regularly used to facilitate emergency operations. In a wilderness as vast as Glen Canyon, no other feasible option exists to rescue wilderness visitors in emergency situations. Structures associated with authorized grazing allotments such as fencing and stock ponds also make a significant contribution to the number of developments that degrade this quality.\n\nWilderness provides outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation.\n\nSolitude abounds in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness. This land absorbs its visitors. Upon arriving at a crowded parking lot, visitors immediately disperse into side canyons and narrow slots, or summit mesas and hike along ridges that offer expansive views of distant thunderstorms where wild land stretches to the horizon. In this wilderness, a feeling of isolation from civilization and solitude from people saturates your senses by the time you have left the trailhead. The somewhat arduous access into many of the wilderness areas in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area magnifies its primitive nature. A whispering breeze or the song of a lone coyote on a clear starry night conjures the images of loneliness that are often associated with the desert landscapes that pervade this region. Both are present here.\n\nThe Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness is vast and unforgiving. A visitor may spend days captivated by the features of a single canyon only to realize that this enchanting experience was minuscule in scale compared to the expanse that is the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness. In many ways, this notion is profoundly humbling. This is a place where visitors can exercise their intuition and primitive skills; a place where travel can be extremely dangerous; a place that is not for the faint of heart. Variable, sometimes extreme terrain forces hikers to make conservative travel plans with the knowledge that emergency communication may be unreliable. Water may be scarce and heat can reach extreme temperatures in places where shade is unavailable for miles. Rivers change from idle streams to raging torrents and summer rains cause violent flash floods that alter everything in their path. Awareness of self and of your surroundings, as well as a strong dose of caution are essential survival tools in this wilderness. These challenges evoke a connection between people and nature that is unparalleled.\n\nIn this wilderness visitors may engage in unconfined recreation of the highest degree. The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness is largely free from recreational developments and few restrictions are imposed on wilderness travelers. Permits are required for overnight stays in some wilderness units, but their purpose is primarily administrative.The permits do not inflict additional restrictions. Campsites are not designated and recommended routes are suggested in the place of maintained trails. The landscape allows for a variety of unique experiences that visitors are free to dictate for themselves based on personal skill level and desired experience.\n\nThere are a number of issues that could lead to the degradation of this quality of wilderness character. Military, commercial and administrative over flights are extremely common and boat engine noise from Lake Powell can propagate up to five miles into the wilderness, diminishing the otherwise pristine soundscape. Evidence of previous users in the formof litter, human waste, graffiti or impacted campsites is detrimental to a visitor’s sense of solitude. Many cultural sites in the wilderness have been vandalized to the extent that valuable information has been lost. In some cases, management strategies such as use limitations, the occasional recreational facility (e.g., composting toilets), or climbing anchors, may be authorized where necessary to improve another quality of wilderness character at the expense of degrading the opportunity for solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation.\n\nWilderness may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historic value.\n\nPaleontology.\n\nThe sediments of Glen Canyon’s buttes and mesas trace their origins to times of shallow seaways, flowing rivers, and expansive deserts. As part of the supercontinent Pangaea, modern-day Arizona and Utah hovered near the equator. Seasonal wet-dry periods created swamps, populated by large salamander-like amphibians that fed on various species of fish, and conifer forest uplands filled with reptiles and early predatory dinosaurs. As Pangaea moved north, the climate became arid and large sand-seas covered much of the Four Corners region. The largest sand dune field known in North America formed, while summer monsoonal rains and ephemeral rivers supported a diverse population of reptiles, carnivorous and large plant-eating dinosaurs. Trackways throughout modern-day Glen Canyon serve as evidence that these animals once roamed this land.\n\nDune seas began to alternate with marine seas, and after an erosive gap of 40 million years the Western Interior Seaway encroached upon this region, spanning the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. At its largest expansion, the sea hosted sharks, bony fish, turtles, and diverse plesiosaurs, as well as invertebrates such as ammonites, bivalves, and corals. Much later, sandstone alcoves provided habitat for some of the last Ice Age fauna including mammoths, ground sloths, shrub oxen, and mountain goats. As the Colorado Plateau shifted up, the Colorado River and a system of lakes and flooded basins in California, Nevada, and Arizona began cutting down through millions of years of sediment. Together these geologic processes helped form the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness.\n\nThe story of life in Glen Canyon is written into the layers of rock that make up this wilderness. Some of the oldest layers in the park preserve extinct early amphibians more than 300 million years old, while the youngest layers include Ice Age mammals such as mammoths and shrub oxen. The fossils found within Glen Canyon help scientists piece together the puzzle of ancient life in this area and around the world.\n\nCultural and Historical.\n\nContemporary tribes possess a deep historical, cultural, emotional, and spiritual connection toward the same landscape European Americans know and revere as wilderness. American Indians have lived in association with the Colorado River and its tributaries for at least 11,000 years. Seven contemporary tribes continue to recognize the Glen Canyon region as their ancestral homeland based on migration histories, residential villages and encampments, cosmologies, and traditional uses. These tribes include the Hopi Tribe, Kaibab Paiute Tribe, Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, Pueblo of Zuni, Navajo Nation, San Juan Southern Paiute,and the Ute Mountain Ute. While native ties to the land are ancient in contrast with the modern wilderness designation, the survival of the values and the tangible resources these traditionally associated peoples ascribe to Glen Canyon country are integrally bound to its wilderness character. For these tribes, the Colorado River corridor and canyons are more than just beautiful scenery. The canyons are alive; they are birth, they are death, and they are a way of life. The Colorado River, the canyons that feed it, the canyons that are carved by it, and the resources it supports are all considered sacred. Here, natural and cultural resources converge to form a landscape that serves as the setting for tribal histories and spiritual narratives.A lineage of explorers and homesteaders migrated through Glen Canyon’s history. The Dominquez-Escalante Expedition traversed this region in 1776 leaving their only known inscription in Padre Bay – a unique, international, and tangible symbol of the fusing of the Old World with the New World. What was once known as “Ute Ford” became the crossing for this expedition. Today we call it the “Crossing of the Fathers.”\n\nIn the mid-19th century, early pioneers and settlers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints traversed Glen Canyon Country. As directed by their prophet and leader, Brigham Young, they began settling areas of Southern Utah and Northern Arizona. They explored river corridors and canyons within the park. Some managed crossings at Hite and Lees Ferry. Others pioneered travel routes across the Colorado River along the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail from Parowan to Bluff, Utah. During this time, an infamous member of Latter-Day Saints, John D. Lee, his wife Emma, and other members of the Latter-Day Saints community, established a settlement at Lees Ferry. Subsequent generations of Mormons crossed the Colorado here through the early 20th century. The Lees Ferry crossing, which was incorporated into what is now known as the “Arizona Road/Honeymoon Trail,” was in fact, part of an older trail originally used by Hopis and Navajos. Many of the Mormon pioneers established cattle ranches throughout the region that still function today.\n\nHistoric and prehistoric sites, homesteads, ranches, trails, and other cultural resources that exist within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area wilderness are a fundamental part of the wilderness character of Glen Canyon Country. The human experience and tangible evidence cannot be separated from the environment. The rich history of mutual dependency and interconnectedness shaped both the essence of this wilderness and the spirit, courage, and resilience of those humans who travel through or call it home."
