        "text": "The Role of the Stoughton Area Community Foundation\n\nIn 1998, Paul Sundby was looking for a way to support natural resources and the environment in the community he loved. He also wanted this funding to be sustainable over the long term. With this vision, the Stoughton Area Community Foundation was born. Since then, more than 50 organizations have been helped and over $800,000 has gone back into making Stoughton better place to live for all.\n\nThe concept is simple: Companies and individuals donate to SACF, organizations with worthy projects apply for grants and our board finds where the money can do the most good. We also help small groups who need a place for money to flow in and out for project use. Our job is to connect resources with needs.\n\nPlease explore the different examples on this site as to how you can contribute and also benefit from the Foundation's mission.\n\nCelebrating Our 26th Anniversary of Helping Stoughton\n\nThis booklet is a celebration of our community and the thousands of people we have impacted in the past 26 years. We would to thank all the board members who have served and who have given their expertise and time to bring the Stoughton Area Community Foundation to this milestone.\n\nPlease download your copy and learn about our past, present and our hopes for the future of Stoughton.\n\nDownload Booklet"
