        "text": "Director of Programs\n\nBruce Anderson\n\nBruce is a fourth generation Montanan who happily returned to Montana after serving 30 years in the Navy as a helicopter pilot and naval officer. After living in a variety of locations around the states and Europe, he and his wife Kristi realized there is nowhere quite like Bozeman and returned in 2015. Since then he has volunteered at Eagle Mount in the winter programs and cycling in the summer. The prospect of becoming involved at Eagle Mount in a full time capacity was too much to pass up and he happily welcomed the opportunity to get involved as\n\nDirector of Programs. Before his time in the navy, he worked as a hired hand on a ranch and for the Forest Service as a Missoula Smokejumper. He enjoys fishing, hunting, hiking, gardening, and half ironman triathlons.\n\nbanderson@eaglemount.org | 406-586-1781 ext. 107\n\nAdaptive Aquatics Director\n\nAmy Mullen\n\nAmy splashed into this world in Billings, spending her first 11 years of life there. She started swimming competitively at the age of 5 and water has been a part of her life since. After earning top Montana state rankings in her 10 and under years, she moved to Oregon at 11 and joined the highest ranked team in Oregon where she continued her swim journey, finding her strengths in sprint freestyle and all of butterfly, consistently placing Top 3 in the state. Through a successful high school career, she graduated and attended Colorado State University and where she trained with Amy Van Dyken for her first year. However, shoulder injuries forced her to retire from further collegiate swimming pursuits, thus making her decision to transfer to Rocky Mountain College where she obtained a degree in Biology.\n\nIn 2006, she was left bedridden for the next 2 years from a car accident. After her first major surgery, she was able to begin the process of relearning how to walk and talk properly again. Using her swim mantra of “No Pain, No Gain” Amy found her way back to the pool for therapy walking, and then testing the waters by trying to begin to swim horizontally again. She became the head coach of the Peak Waves Swim Team in 2008 and discovered her joy of coaching. Encouraged by her youthful swimmers, she began training herself in a new modified way and entered her first swim meet shortly thereafter. She qualified for nationals in 5 events, placing in the Top 5 in all 5 events, including 2nd place in both her spring freestyles. During this time, she also pursued a second degree in Graphic & Web Design (and IT). She moved to Bozeman in 2018 with her family, where her daughter quickly found her own love and home in the world of swimming and swim teams. No matter what career path Amy has dove into, she has always found herself back near the water and has always found herself most content in the world of helping others.\n\nShe has found her utmost passion in both her world of coaching youth swimmers as well as the community of Eagle Mount with the commonality support of the rest of the staff in her life’s philosophy: to make sure every person she crosses paths with each day feels seen, heard and has space held for them no matter how that space is needed.\n\namullen@eaglemount.org | 4065861781 ext. 120\n\nAdaptive Recreation Associate Director (Big Sky)\n\nBeth Wilson\n\nBeth is originally from Michigan, but lived in Colorado for 11 years before coming to Montana in 2016. Her teaching background is working with children with autism in both public schools, and in an Autism Center. While earning her BA degree in Special Education, she volunteered for the STARS adaptive ski program in Steamboat Springs, CO. In the summer of 2010, she was a backcountry/wilderness therapy guide in Utah where she discovered her passion for teaching outdoors. Since Beth’s arrival in Big Sky, she has supervised the locals Skiwees program at Big Sky Resort, but has spent most of her time raising her two boys. Beth is grateful for the opportunity to combine her passion for outdoors and her passion for supporting those with special needs at Eagle Mount. Beth has a husband (Chad) and two boys (TJ and Levon), and a German Shorthaired Pointer (Emerald). They can be found doing a variety of outdoor activities including skiing in the winter, and mountain biking or rafting in the summer.\n\nbwilson@eaglemount.org | (406) 586-1781"
