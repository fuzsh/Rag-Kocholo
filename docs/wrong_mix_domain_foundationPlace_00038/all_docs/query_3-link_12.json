        "text": "By\n\nKathi Gregoire\n\n030097449\n\nFinal Assignment\n\nSubmitted to Dr. Mark A. Barclift\n\nIn Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for\n\nLDR5013\n\nFoundations of Christian Leadership\n\nGlobal University\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nThrough the efforts of study, prayer, and conversation in this class I have discovered that I am a Holy Spirit empowered, biblically inspired leader that does the WHAT of leadership while understanding the WHY of leadership and pursuing the HOW of leadership in order to utilize the concepts of power, authority, and influence so that I can fulfill His call on me to position, relationship, and action. This paper is a road map of my journey to discovery. I will address the role of the Holy Spirit now and will address other aspects later.\n\nAffirming the Role of the Holy Spirit in the Emergence of the Christian Leader\n\nThe role of the Holy Spirit in leadership development is critical. Recently, I approached my husband for help pruning our plum tree. I am an aggressive pruner and when I prune I use a chainsaw. Fortunately, the Holy Spirit has more forethought to his preparation. He “selects a person for a specific ministry,” (Elliston 1992, 100) and he equips and empowers. (Elliston 1992, 102) The Lord built each of us and we each have the joy of discovering what we are built for; I love working the Information Center for my church because there is something in how I am built that resonates with that particular ministry. When we function in our specific ministry we are stimulated and energized as we pour ourselves out for the benefit of others. This is one small specific ministry He has called, equipped and empowered me to fulfill. Not only do I enjoy this but others confirm my expertise and value in this ministry. Elliston states that “the Holy Spirit works through existing leaders to develop others.” (Elliston 1992, 103) I am encouraged and given more training as well as experiences that help my growth and development. If, when I pursued ordination, I had been rejected or encouraged for another direction at any point in the process, I would have taken that seriously as the Holy Spirit using the leaders over me to direct and recognize my calling and ministry. If the presbytery had not recommended me for ordination that would have indicated the Lord had not called me. Yes, I understand the need to be firm in going forward when one believes they are called and to not let any barriers stand in their way, but I strongly believe it is vitally important to reflect on the feedback and input from leadership. The Holy Spirit will prune each of us as needed to produce the most growth. Pruning can be a painful process and it does not show results immediately, but it is a needed aspect of growth and development. Growing something worthwhile takes time, and pruning is a part of the process.\n\nBiblical Images of Leadership for Church Leaders in My Ministerial Context\n\nClinton lists 10 leadership styles Paul demonstrates. (Clinton 1992, 55) I have analyzed the individuals on the Bozeman Christian Center (BCC) deacon board and how Paul’s biblical leadership styles are displayed; three will be discussed below. The first is the apostolic style. Clinton describes this style as having “a sense of spiritual authority” with “self-authenticating evidence” that they hear and are placed by God. (Clinton 1992, 55) The member of the deacon board that demonstrates this is the chairman of the board, the Lead Pastor. This is positional but the individual filling this role demonstrates delegated authority, hears from God, and takes responsibility for the actions of the board. In the case of BCC, the chairman of the board is the one in charge AND is the strongest influencer. The positional leader of a group is not always the biggest influencer, but in the case of this board, it is true. The second individual I call the Challenger. Clinton labels them with “Confrontation Style.” (Clinton 1992, 56) This individual on the board consistently states the “Yes, but…” in discussions and confronts the issues presented to the board as problems to be solved. This leadership style was used by Paul, Peter, Jude, and John and is demonstrated in some of their writings in the New Testament. (Clinton 1992, 56) This is a biblical leadership style, but it is best utilized as a style that can be accessed instead of a main style. Working with someone with this as their main leadership style stifles innovation and open communication because other members of the group are afraid how they will be interpreted. It is manipulative unless moderated in a godly manner. The last individual and biblical leadership style I will explain is the Father-Guardian style. There is an older gentleman on the BCC board who is a grandfatherly figure. He is older, but his qualities of grandfathering go beyond mere age. Like the biblical style stated by Clinton (Clinton 1992, 59) this individual elicits empathetic concern for the protection and concern of the church family. He wants to make sure everyone feels loved, cared for, and protected. Because BCC has not typically developed its leaders adequately, the biblical styles stated by Clinton are not found nested within individual leaders but each is demonstrated by a single member of the board. The board would be more effective if the individuals on the board had the opportunity to develop their leadership styles instead of being recognized for historically demonstrated leadership. This is why the board of Christian Center is larger than the average board of a church its size. This church could have multiple traits within individuals like the apostle Paul demonstrated if it had a purposeful leadership development plan. This church recently went through a pastoral transition and the current lead pastor is forging a cultural shift that I believe will lead to recognizable leadership development opportunities and programs.\n\nC. Gene Wilkes in his book, Jesus on Leadership: Timeless Wisdom on Servant Leadership describes Jesus’ leadership in two main ways: he modeled the mission (Wilkes 1998, 160; Mark 10:45; Philippians 2:7) and he modeled his teachings. (Wilkes 1998, 162; Luke 14:10) The mission was to “be the Suffering Servant of God.” (Wilkes 1998, 160) Jesus was not a political or military Messiah. (Wilkes 198, 161) He came to reign in human hearts, not sit on human thrones or direct armies in revolution. The toughest aspect of Jesus’ leadership I believe was that being fully God, and therefore all knowing, he knew that Judas would betray him. Regardless, at the last supper he washed Judas’ feet along with the other disciples’. (John 13) This is a profound demonstration of servant leadership and being focused on the mission. Wilkes states, “Servants who live out the will of their Father in heaven do not fear human schemes.” (Wilkes 1998, 166) I want to be focused on the mission to the point that betrayal does not de-rail me. Put another way, “When one becomes servant to the mission, that mission becomes the resolve that is the basis of strong leadership during critical times.” (Wilkes 198, 165) The biblical leadership portrayed by Jesus is modeling the mission and the teachings. He was firmly grounded in his mission to the point that the crisis of Judas’ betrayal did not confuse, stun, or otherwise distract him. I can look to Jesus for my development as a Christian leader.\n\nThe WHAT of Leadership\n\nI am responsible for my growth as a Christian leader. (Clinton 1992, 10) There are numerous seminars, books, and forms of teaching available. I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to purposefully develop my leadership by working at my local church as a ministry intern. I am able to work alongside church leaders and staff in the day to day operations of the church as well as attend the board meetings and participate in staff meetings. I have my professor to talk with in my “Foundations for Christian Leadership” class through Global University and I have regular meetings with the lead pastor at my church which gives me another vein for dialogue with another trusted Christian leader. There are numerous opportunities to grow my leadership but there are three aspects that are particularly important. These are the role of self-awareness, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the use of contingency models. I addressed the role of the Holy Spirit earlier in this paper and will therefore not repeat what was previously discussed. I will address the other aspects below.\n\nFirst, I will explore the role of self-awareness in affirming my ministry and calling. The vernacular in my culture labels people who aspire to self-awareness as having “gone to find themselves.” I find value in knowing one’s self. Having a healthy self-awareness enables a leader to function at a high level. According to author Harris W. Lee there are a handful of helpful ways for leaders to know themselves. (Lee 2001, 46) The first is by reading self-help books. (Lee 2001, 46) Reading is an effective and simple way to reflect and gain understanding. The second is through Clinical Pastoral Education. This is more intense and concentrated than reading books but is valuable because it gives training and feedback as the minister learns more about human dynamics and how he responds. (Lee 2001, 46) The third helpful way according to Harris W. Lee is through psychological testing. (Lee 2001, 46) These tests can give a minister a window into their “cognitive style and temperament” as well as other character and personality elements that affect how she interacts with her environment. (Lee 2001, 47) Some examples are the Jo-Hari window (Lee 2001, 47), Myers-Briggs (Lee 2001, 49), and the Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis. I have taken each of these, the limits of this paper do not allow for a full analysis, but they each were beneficial to my self-awareness by confirming strengths and led to positive growth in areas that were weaker.\n\nThese tests affirm my calling and ministry or they help me see I need to move in a different direction. It is similar to when I was ordained and my church pastor asked me what it meant to me to be ordained. I replied, “It is man’s recognition of God’s call.” The above listed tests are objective ways to recognize God’s call. These evaluations have no emotional attachments and can objectively help show if someone has the temperament and mind for Christian leadership. Tests are not fool proof, but used in conjunction with wise counsel, they are useful tools of discovery. If someone feels led to step into Christian leadership it is wise to gain wise counsel as well as taking some of the above tests to help see if they are built for this or not.\n\nThe final element I will explore is the value of contingency models in my growth as a Christian Leader. A contingency model is a theory that sees “leadership effectiveness as contingent upon leadership styles, followers and situational variables.” (Clinton 1992, 83) There are two categories of contingency models, single style approaches and multi-style approaches. (Clinton 1992, 81) The single style models include the One Ideal Style such as Blake and Mouton and the Best Fit style such as Fiedler. (Clinton 1992, 81) The multi-style approaches include Variable Styles and Style as Complex Behavioral Functioning, such as Hershey and Blanchard, and House, respectively. (Clinton 1992, 81) These contingency models are valuable because they provide a reality check for me. I am responsible for my growth as a Christian leader and part of that responsibility is using all available tools. I had not been exposed to these until this course and they have re-stimulated thoughts and prayers to understand by leadership style. These models are helpful for me to see clearly by providing grids for me to view myself through. Contingency models are a valuable tool to evaluate my effectiveness in light of my leadership style, those following me, and the situation. I can use any of these models as a grid to view my leadership effectiveness. These grids help me focus on specifics and not become distracted. I believe contingency models are biblical concepts because I see them reflected in 1 Corinthians 12:12 – 14 and Ephesians 4:16. Both these Scriptures refer to the body of Christ, which is the church, and how it relies on other members and interacts with aspects of the environment.\n\nBy focusing on the three areas of leadership development of the role of self-awareness, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the use of contingency models, leaders take responsibility for their growth and allow it to flourish as intended by the Holy Spirit. Each of these is a useful tool in my growth as a Christian leader. It is my responsibility to see that I use available tools to benefit His Kingdom, my growth, and those He has entrusted me to lead. Utilizing self-awareness, listening to the Holy Spirit, and using contingency models together is a strong way to view and improve as a Christian leader.\n\nThe HOW of Leadership\n\nThere are predominant styles, crucial areas, and concepts of leadership that come together into the “How” of leadership. I will explore how these elements function in my local situation. I will look at the predominant leadership styles, the crucial areas of an organization’s structure and coordination, and then I will I look at power, authority, and influence and how these are foundational for Christian leadership into the future.\n\nPredominant Leadership Styles in My Ministerial Context\n\nIn order to understand the ‘how’ of leadership we need to understand the shoulders we stand on. The secular leadership styles that have historically been active are the Great Man Era from 1841 – 1904; Trait Era from 1904 – 1948; Behavior Era from 1948 – 1967; Contingency Era from 1967 – 1980; and Complexity Era from 1980 – 1986. These eras in leadership theory have led into the current secular models. Theories lead to models which lead to styles. I can recognize my personal leadership style because people before me have come up with theories which were studied that gave a grid for understanding. Without any one of these, today’s leaders would be ignorant of their styles and how to lead. Their leadership would be enhanced by understanding the types of leadership styles. J. Robert Clinton says that the study of leadership style requires “historical analysis, needs to be correlated with leadership theory as a whole, requires reflection from a Christian standpoint, and is in need of further research from a missiological standpoint.” (Clinton 1992, 7)\n\nSecular models are helpful for understanding ministerial leadership. It is invalid to separate secular understanding of leadership and biblical leadership styles because leadership styles are the same whether used in the secular or church world. Both are influencing people to a desired goal. The tools are the same while the end goal of getting someone to buy a Coca-Cola or give their life over to Jesus is different. Understanding this gives the reader a foundational understanding for analysis. Below I will demonstrate this by evaluating the predominant leadership styles of Bozeman Christian Center’s deacon board on the basis of effective models.\n\nDue to the constraints of this paper I will utilize only one secular model. I have chosen Fiedler’s Contingency Model because I feel it reveals the deacon board of BCC the best. (Clinton 1992, 29)\n\nDeacons are approached by a nomination committee; if the individual accepts the nomination then there will be a vote of the church membership at the annual business meeting. The initial pursuit is clearly a demonstration of the Great Man Theory. The individual is not developed for leadership, they are chosen for inherent traits. This can also be interpreted through Fiedler’s model. Fiedler’s approach which espouses a fixed style (Clinton 1992, 31) or what the leader has instinctually is what is seen by others and valued to the point of, in the case of BCC’s deacon board, to be requested to lead a group of people. This is cyclical because there is no leadership development, only members showing leadership traits are chosen and to be chosen a member must show leadership traits. What untapped resources of leadership are sitting in the BCC sanctuary? For the sake of the advancement of His Kingdom in the Bozeman community, this church needs to be innovative in its leadership development.\n\nFiedler’s Contingency Model shows strong assertiveness on predicting how a given leader will produce or behave in a given situation. (Clinton 1992, 32) This is why a Lead Pastor can walk into a deacon meeting predicting with accuracy who will say what and what the outcome will be. This is not leadership, this is spectating. BCC would serve itself well to adjust the selection process to include leadership development. Taking Fiedler’s model above and recognizing tendencies so that the board can be balanced are valid. For instance, being aware of people’s personality orientation in regard to task and relationship will help the board function well without the predisposition to “puppeteering.” In other words, taking the intangible qualities of task or relationship orientation instead of the more concrete demonstration of previous history will allow for a board to be more comprehensive in the discussions that lead to decisions. Leadership styles deal with the methodology expressed by individuals in separate situations. How does someone handle a crisis? How do they deal with decision making or coordinating with supervisors? These types of leadership instances, according to Clinton, (Clinton 1992, 55) reveal different biblical leadership styles. Clinton utilizes the apostle Paul as a study subject for biblical leadership styles which I addressed above.\n\nCrucial Areas of Organization Structure and Coordination at Bozeman Christian Center\n\nStructuring and coordinating an organization is one aspect of the “how” of leadership. How an organization structures and organizes itself reflects that organization’s values and priorities. (Klaus 2005, 39) For a church it also reflects the theology and doctrine. (Klaus 2005, 39) How Bozeman Christian Center’s theology and doctrine is streamed into forming values and priorities will lead into a declaration of its purpose. In other words, how the organization is structured and coordinated reveals how the leadership views doing the work of serving God and people. (Klaus 2005, 39)\n\nHow does BCC reflect this? How is its theology streamed into its priorities? How are these priorities seen by the community? What is valued higher is always prioritized. For instance, if I say spending time with my family is a priority but I am working at the church instead of attending my children’s school program, then my priorities of work production and the church are exposed. The stated values are not always the true values; the real values are exposed by our actions. What actions does BCC do to promote its priorities?\n\nThere are structures in place to assure the Children’s Ministry workers are safe for children, there are structures in place to assimilate first time guests, there are structures in place to make sure whoever drives a church van is a safe and competent driver. These structures reflect a value of safety and hospitality. However, as stated above, BCC has not had leadership development training or opportunities. It has had structures for picking its leaders, so I believe it has valued being led, but it has not valued developing people. It is beginning to change but cultural shifts take time. For instance, this body of believers continues to view leadership as an expense instead of an investment. (Osborne 2010, 189) I saw this demonstrated in a Deacon Meeting November 19, 2012 when an unscientific poll of each deacon’s view of paid pastoral staff was done; the majority of deacons viewed the staff as an expense of the church and not an investment for the church. The concept translates to the volunteers within a church like the Sunday school teachers, ushers, or a drummer in the worship band; the investment is time and energy into their growth and development. BCC has done this poorly. This church has farm hands; those brought in to fill a role but not developed. Instead, it could view the membership as a farmer views his children, those that will inherit the farm and will carry it into its future. A farmer teaches their children the ways of animals, how to recognize when hay fields need more tending, how to fix equipment, and so forth. The farmer is developing another farmer. Church leaders need to be developing other church leaders.\n\nHow does this differ from the research I have investigated? It is similar in that the methods and actions will reflect the values and priorities. However, it is different in that the texts I read for this course all imply the need to develop leaders. The Great Man Theory is outdated and is inadequate to sustain healthy growth of an organization over a long period of time. Sometimes organizations get lucky, an example is when Lech Walesa stepped up in a shipyard in Poland and destroyed communism; there was no developing a leader for this need. A remarkable man decided he was not going to stand for it anymore and rallied others around him. This is the exception and not the rule.\n\nA strong plus for BCC is that this organization has a vibrant abundance mentality. There is no strife over resources; the staff members encourage one another instead of competing. This was proven true when I sat in on the staff budget meeting and then sat in on the Deacon Board’s budget meeting. There was a fervent air of the church cooperating and being synergetic instead of individual departments competing for budget dollars. This reflects what Klaus stated in my study guide, “Organizing the church for its life and mission makes it possible for the church’s resources to go toward the accomplishment of its goals.” (Klaus 2005, 41) Each department’s goals fall under the umbrella of the church’s overall goals and each leader of these departments understands and pursues this team mentality. The pastoral staff also enjoys one another on a relational level. An organization will not benefit if interdependent systems and processes are hampered by poor interdependent and interpersonal relationships. (Covey 1991, 267) BCC has strong footing for the future with this element.\n\nConcepts of Power, Authority, and Influence\n\nClinton defines power as “the capacity of leaders to produce intended and foreseen effects on others.” (Clinton 1992, 100) Lee reflects on the difference between power and authority. According to Lee power is the ability to do something while authority is the right to do something. (Lee, 63) In the end, influence is the result of power and authority. Below I will synthesize these using Faeth’s research in the Episcopal Church in the United States.\n\nMargaret Ann Faeth’s dissertation, Power, Authority and Influence: A Comparative Study of the Behavioral Influence Tactics Used by Lay and Ordained Leaders in the Episcopal Church addresses the influence processes of leadership in the Episcopal Church by comparing lay and ordained leadership. Her research applies to my ministerial context at Bozeman Christian Center because we have pastoral staff and congregant volunteers. These designations coincide with Faeth’s vocabulary of ordained and lay leadership.\n\nBCC’s pastoral staff has authority; this team has been given the right to exert power for influence. Are the tactics used by an authorized power different from those that are used by volunteers or lay leaders? Faeth’s hypothesis was that the ordained leadership would lead with different tactics. These assumptions turned out to be mostly unfounded. (Faeth 2004, 63) Regardless of authority, leaders use the same tactics and have the same amount of influence. In other words, if a follower is told that a member of the pastoral staff at BCC has authority, it is not more influential to the follower than a congregant volunteer. People do not care if you have a title or what your vocation is; members of a congregation regulate personally who has influence over them. The days are gone when a pastor’s word could make change happen. The era of clergy who made all the decisions and did all the work of ministry is over. (Faeth 2004, 64) Instead, common and well communicated goals are the builders of trust for influence. According to Faeth’s research, it is important for lay and ordained leaders to use influence tactics that emphasize shared goals and values. (Faeth 2004, 62)\n\nIf the above is true, there is little difference how a leader in a position of authority, pastoral staff member at BCC or ordained clergy in the Episcopal Church, demonstrates power compared to volunteers in BCC or lay leaders in the Episcopal Church. Both sets of leaders, authorized and volunteer, are led to “appeal to abiding principles such as justice, service and love.” (Faeth 2004, 63) However, Faeth did find a statistical difference in male versus female use of influence tactics. (Faeth 2004, 63)\n\nWomen tend to use collaborative and exchange techniques more often than men. (Faeth 2004, 65) Because these types of leadership tactics are more effective church leaders in the local, national, and international arenas need to take note so that women are developed for church leadership; taking advantage of these instinctive traits for the benefit of the Kingdom. In my ministerial context at Bozeman Christian Center Church I see BCC being further advanced than most Assemblies of God churches in Montana. Women account for 40% of the credentialed ministers in the district (Fox 2012). In my time as an intern at BCC I have observed that the lead pastor, who is male and ordained, demonstrate the most influence on the church leadership which includes the pastoral staff, deacon board, and volunteers. Close behind his influence is a non-credentialed female pastor. I have seen this female use the traits of exchange and collaboration to benefit her goals, the goals of the pastoral staff team, and the overall goals of BCC. BCC is more ready than most ministries for the future of power, authority, and influence.\n\nThere are predominant styles, crucial areas, and concepts of leadership that come together into the “How” of leadership. This paper demonstrated how these elements function in my local situation. I looked at the predominant leadership styles, the crucial areas of an organization’s structure and coordination, as well as power, authority, and influence and how these are foundational for Christian leadership into the future.\n\nThe WHY of Leadership\n\nThe North American cultural context of business and ministry look for strong traits of character and work ethic. Without trust, a business partner or pastor will be isolated by their peers. A calling is a call to a position, a relationship, and action. No one can have the second without trust and without relationship there will be no mission or call to action. Throughout biblical history there are models for today’s Christian leaders to glean and benefit through study and meditation. Today’s leaders can tap into the stories of biblical characters and their callings to help understand our own. These images befit the standard view of Christian leaders in my cultural context.\n\nLet us look at the biblical images that befit the standard view of Christian leaders in my cultural context. The names that quickly come to mind are Abraham, Moses, David and Paul. But thinking again, we come up with Mary, the mother of our Lord; Priscilla, and Anna. We might think that women are called differently, or perhaps not at all. Both would be inaccurate. I look at the calling of the apostle Andrew and I am encouraged. Let us set aside gender and just look at all these as people, not representatives of gender.\n\nI can relate to Andrew. Andrew was a normal person. He was not flashy. He was not someone that you would remember at a social gathering. But I assure you that you would remember his brother Peter. Jesus called Andrew and through that calling accessed Peter. (Scheline 2012) Peter is the more well-known disciple. Peter is mentioned 153 times in the New Testament and Andrew mentioned 12 times. The event of the callings of Moses, Abraham, David and Paul grab our attention. In contrast, Andrew’s calling event was quiet. But the calling event itself is not foundational; it is not what sustains the called. It is the foundation of the call that is important. The call of God feeds the spirit and propels each person to accomplishments beyond the afterglow of being chosen. In the words of James A. Autry, “Management [leadership] is a sacred trust, an art, a calling.” (Lee 2001, 16) The call of God will help sustain a leader through their ups and downs, strains, sorrows and joys of leadership.\n\nBeing called by God is a call to a position. (Lee 2001, 18) When Andrew was called in the New Testament he was called to the position of disciple. The call to leadership is also a call to a relationship. (Lee 2001, 19) In the case of Andrew, he was not only being instructed by Jesus, he was in relationship with Jesus. He traveled with Him, ate with Him, listened to Him and was listened to by Him. The third aspect of the call to leadership is a call to action. (Lee 2001, 19) Andrew did not merely listen to Jesus and do nothing. He acted. He did service to Jesus and he served others. It was Andrew that pointed out in faith that there was a child’s lunch available to feed the thousands. (John 6:8 – 9)\n\nCalling is foundational for visionary leaders. “Vision is not stupid or capricious action. Vision is a total giving of oneself to God for the ministry.” (Shawchuck and Heuser 1993, 74) Giving ourselves totally to God is foundational for ministry just as it is for life. It is the beginning and it is the substance that keeps our service afloat. Without this foundation, leading is not sustainable. Again, Shawchuck and Heuser write, “The vision is God’s; it cannot be planned. The mission is ours, and its accomplishment must be planned and executed.” (Shawchuck and Heuser 1993, 74) There can be no mission without a vision and there will be no vision given unless there is a calling. God calls; then he gives the vision and Christian leaders are mobilized to accomplish the mission. It is just like in the military. An infantryman accomplishes the goal as laid out by the vision given by the general. Without the vision there is no goal to be accomplished. Without giving himself obediently to the general’s orders the Infantryman is without mission. Again, there can be no mission without a vision and there will be no vision given unless there is a calling. Calling is foundational.\n\nIn order to cooperate with God in our calling leaders need to grow our values. Stephen Covey is famous for his 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. A Christian leader can interpret Covey’s habits as values. Covey’s habits are “1) self-awareness or self-knowledge; 2) imagination and conscience; …3) volition or will-power. . . 4) an abundance mentality; 5) courage and consideration; 6) creativity” and 7) self-renewal. (Covey 1991, 40) These habits can be broken down further into four levels: (1) personal; (2) interpersonal, (3) managerial, and (4) organizational. (Covey 1991, 31) At the personal level the principle is trustworthiness; do Christian leaders demonstrate competence and character? Trust is the principle at the second level and is “the emotional bank account between two people that enables them to have a win-win performance agreement.” (Covey 1991, 31) Empowerment describes the managerial level, and alignment describes the organizational level. (Covey 1991, 153) The “inviolate principles such as fairness, equity, justice, integrity, and honesty. . . inspire the . . . synergetic relationships that produce the necessary “culture” for business or ministry.” (Klaus 2005, 27)\n\nThe North American cultural context of business and ministry look for the above traits of character and work ethic. A business partner, employee, or pastor without the above will be isolated by their peers if they are not trustworthy. If I, as an employee, business partner, or pastor do not demonstrate trust as a foundational principle I will not be taken seriously, will not be promoted, and will not be welcomed as a full member of the group. A calling is a call to a position, a relationship, and action. No one can have the second without trust and without relationship there will be no mission or call to action.\n\nReflecting on myself with brutal honesty shows a woman desiring some traits, scared of others, and bucking some. I am a normal human being just like the apostle Andrew. It does not matter whether I am Jew or Greek, male or female. God knows I am not perfect, but He calls me anyway; He calls us anyway. I have my soap boxes. I have my weaknesses. I have gifts. I may think him mad at times to have called me (Shawchuck and Heuser 1993, 66), but I have a redeemer that sees me and He calls me to position, relationship and action. If Andrew can respond, I can too.\n\nThe apostle Andrew was a normal man living normal life and was called by God to a specific role in history. We all are human beings called by God to our specific role in history. Will I respond? Yes, I am a Holy Spirit empowered, biblical leadership inspired leader that does the WHAT of leadership while understanding the WHY of leadership and pursuing the HOW of leadership in order to utilize the concepts of power, authority, and influence so that I can fulfill His call on me to position, relationship, and action.\n\nREFERENCE LIST\n\nClinton, J.
