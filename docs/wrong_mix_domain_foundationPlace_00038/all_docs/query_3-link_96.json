Healthier Together represented a radical shift in our grantmaking – we put residents at the core of developing health solutions around their own needs, rather than force-fitting a system that doesn’t always recognize the complexity, culture, context and circumstances of diverse communities. When you start to see health issues through the eyes of the people who live in a vulnerable community, you realize the barriers and inequities that exist won’t be overcome through traditional clinical care systems. Healthier Together is leading change for better health in our community, neighborhood by neighborhood.”"
