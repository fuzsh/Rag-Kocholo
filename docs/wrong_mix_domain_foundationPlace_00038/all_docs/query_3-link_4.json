        "text": "Thrive\n\nThrive’s mission is for all children to have the opportunity to grow, succeed, and become valuable members of our community. Its programs serve families with children of all ages, providing resources, opportunities, professional services, and one-on-one help to help them reach their goals. A grant from One Valley helped fund Thrive’s Partnership Project which provides young families, those with children ages 5 years old and younger, with the support they need to be successful. That could mean help navigating food assistance programs, finding quality child care, or gaining access to mental health systems.\n\nExtreme History Project\n\nAs a nonprofit that tells stories of our area’s history that may otherwise go untold, the Extreme History Project hosts monthly lectures at Museum of the Rockies, leads historic walking tours, and other programs. As a small organization, it can be difficult to operate on project-based funds alone. A general support grant from One Valley helped the Extreme History Project to support its day-to-day work and the success of its programs. This grant made it possible connect the past to the present and bring these stories to the public as a way to better understand our world through the lens of history.\n\nGallatin Valley Land Trust\n\nIncluded in its work to connect people, communities, and open lands through conservation and trail creation in the Montana headwaters of the Missouri and Upper Yellowstone Rivers, Gallatin Valley Land Trust facilitates the Main Street to the Mountains trail system. A grant from One Valley helped GVLT build a spur trail that gives residents and staff at the Gallatin Mental Health Center easy access to the existing trail system in the area of Bozeman Health Deaconess Hospital. The project came to life after a staff member noticed that connecting the Highland Glen Trail to the mental health center would facilitate increased outdoor recreation opportunities.\n\nReach Inc.\n\nReach is a private, nonprofit organization that serves adults in the Gallatin Valley with developmental or other disabilities and empowers them to attain individual goals and aspirations. With the help of a grant from One Valley, Reach purchased soil, plants, and materials to install a raised garden bed at one of its supported living locations, the Willow Townhouse. The garden bed allows clients to contribute to the house by providing fresh produce, reduce the cost of groceries, learn new skills, and experiencing a new independence through the hobby of gardening."
