JC Glick as Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Glick brings a wealth of experience as a leadership consultant and a deep commitment to supporting veterans in their transition journey. Since transitioning from 20 years of military service in 2015, J.C. has been a founder and partner of two leadership companies and the author of two books, including A Light in the Darkness: Leadership Development for the Unknown. In 2017, he was selected as a TEDX Speaker and delivered Rethinking Leadership at TEDX Hammond. Glick is also an adjunct professor at St. John’s University in Queens, New York.

I am deeply committed to our mission of empowering veterans and our nation’s future leaders to write their next chapter. I look forward to building on the foundation of success established over the past decade,” said Glick. The COMMIT Foundation empowers service members, veterans, and their families to create purposeful and fulfilling transitions by providing personalized programs, resources, and the support of community. COMMIT creates tailored solutions for top veteran talent and reaches veterans across the Nation through high-impact workshops and one-on-one transition assistance programs.

Alex Krongard will step away from his position as CEO by December 31, 2023. In his message to the COMMIT community, Alex shared: “It has been an incredible journey serving as COMMIT’s CEO and being a part of this remarkable organization. Together, we have achieved so much, and I am deeply grateful for the dedication, passion, and impact that each of you brings to our mission every day. The decision has not been an easy one, but I believe that it is the right time for both me and the organization.” Alex came to the COMMIT Foundation after retiring from the United States Navy as a rear admiral in 2016 after 31 years of military service. Notably, he served as the Deputy Operations Officer of United States Africa Command and previously commanded Naval Special Warfare Group ONE. Under Alex’s leadership, he built a strong leadership team enabling the COMMIT Foundation to successfully move from a startup organization to a well-organized non-profit rooted in principle-based management that thoughtfully and intentionally serves the military community. During Alex’s tenure, COMMIT expanded the depth and breadth of services offered to military service members, veterans and their families, expanded its donor base, increased its revenue, and improved its collaborative partnerships with other non-profit organizations. “This is an exciting time for COMMIT,” said Guy Filippelli, Board Chairman. “Alex is a wonderful leader who has left a great mark on this organization and its leadership team. He’s become a true partner and friend to me and the entire board, and we’re deeply appreciative of his efforts. We’re energized to build on this momentum, and our sights now turn to finding the right leader to bring the organization to yet another level.” The Board of Directors will immediately launch a national search for Alex’s successor. During this transition period, the Board of Directors, in collaboration with the strong and dedicated team at COMMIT, will be working diligently to ensure a smooth and successful transition of leadership. In the interim, Board Director Mimi Bock will act as special advisor. The executive leadership team will oversee the day-to-day operations and continue the mission-driven work of the organization without interruption. About the COMMIT Foundation: Founded in 2012, the COMMIT Foundation has refined a highly effective and individualized approach to transition for post-9/11 veterans and military families. COMMIT’s mission is to empower service members, veterans, and their families through personalized programs, resources, and the support of our community to create purposeful and fulfilling transitions. Our success comes from the process of identifying exactly where each veteran is on their transition journey, helping them design a balanced and purposeful life post-service, and then connecting them with services and networks to make that vision a reality.

Spring has sprung at The COMMIT Foundation and the first quarter of 2023 was jam-packed! We hosted one workshop for over 19 service members with the support of our generous hosts and sponsors. We also (finally!) officially launched our Spouse Program, our COMMunITy, welcomed a brand new Chief Programs Officer, and continued to serve our veterans and their families through our programming. Read below to learn more about what we’ve been up to NASHVILLE TRANSITION MENTORING WORKSHOP In the midst of the music and positive vibes of Downtown Nashville, 19 transitioning service members gathered for a two-day COMMIT Transition Mentoring Workshop hosted by Bridgestone Americas in their corporate headquarters. The service members, representing more than 430 years of military service, kicked off the two-day workshop with a deeper dive into some of the work they'd done through Pursue Your Purpose and with their executive coaches. The multi-story state-of-the-art building was an inspiring venue for participants to imagine the next chapter of their life they are designing. They discussed their hopes and fears and some specific and actionable goals they'd like to tackle. During a dinner hosted by Bridgestone, Ralph Schultz, CEO of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce shared a few remarks about Nashville and some of the Chamber's priorities. Schultz encouraged the participants to consider looking at opportunities in Nashville and surrounding areas and described incredible growth in the healthcare and technology industries. During the second day of the workshop, mentors from Bridgestone, Microsoft, and local businesses joined the participants. Together they shared stories, crafted narratives, and developed a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities around transitioning from the military. Rob Seibert, President of Off the Road at Bridgestone Americas and former Army officer, shared a bit about his transition from the military and his career at Bridgestone and reflected on the importance of networking and taking advantage of learning opportunities. After the event, several participants shared that the workshop provided new confidence in their transitions. \"My separation plan has been strengthened and bolstered with positive energy and a pathway to looking forward while recognizing our accomplishments,\" said Nicholas St. Louis, a transitioning service member and participant from the Nashville Workshop. \"I am hopeful for the coming year to see where I end up, and I can only hope to be another COMMIT success story.\" COMMIT would like to thank Bridgestone Americas for hosting and Brian Summers and Linda Alberstadt for all the work they put into planning this special event, as well as Pilot Travel Centers and Mission BBQ for their support. The next in-person event will be in Silver Spring, Maryland in April. INTRODUCING OUR NEW CHIEF PROGRAMS OFFICER The COMMIT Foundation is proud to welcome Brian Von Herbulis as our new Chief Programs Officer. Brian brings with him a diverse background of over 25 years of military, business, and nonprofit leadership experience as a retired U.S. Marine Corps Officer. While serving on active duty, he commanded reconnaissance and special operations units at the platoon, company, and battalion levels. He was a “plank owner” (original member) of 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command. His final assignment on active duty was as the Commanding Officer of 1st Reconnaissance Battalion. He retired from active military service in 2014 as a Lieutenant Colonel. Post military service, Brian has become a successful business executive, entrepreneur, and nonprofit leader. Brian earned a Bachelor of Arts from Hampden-Sydney College and a Master of Business Administration from Boise State University. He also earned a Certificate in Executive Leadership Coaching from Georgetown University. Brian now lives in Eagle, Idaho with his wife and two children. SPOUSE PROGRAM LAUNCH In 2022, The COMMIT Foundation launched a pilot program to address the needs of spouses who had service members that were transitioning. Validating the need and creating a community of support for these spouses became a priority for the organization. After two cohorts of pilot workshops, COMMIT officially launched the spouse program in January 2023. This year COMMIT will virtually host 4 cohorts of spouses and lead them through a journey of self-discovery and planning for the future. This program will create a shared language between the service member and spouse as the family designs their post military service life. One pilot cohort member stated “this was the first time she has felt like her and her spouse have been on the same page in a long time.” COMMIT would like to thank The Cigna Foundation as the leading sponsor for our spouse programming. Through the support of the Navy Seal Foundation and R4ST, The COMMIT Foundation was also able to bring this workshop to San Diego for a two day in person event. At the in-person event, the spouses were able to explore topics such as values, goal setting and telling their stories. The COMMIT Foundation is proud to lead the efforts of understanding that the military lifestyle is a family affair and that every member of the family has unique needs during transition. If you would like more information about the spouse transition program or how you can support this program, please reach out to Amy Taft, amy.taft@commitfoundation.org Read more about our family programs here. COMMunITy Calling all COMMIT Foundation alumni! The COMMIT Foundation is excited to provide an online community for our tribe. We are inviting all of our alumni to join our COMMunITy. This interactive platform will support the COMMIT vision to build a vibrant virtual community and strengthen our network. COMMunITy is a secure, trusted location to share information, advice, work opportunities, lessons learned, as well as access to mentors and introductions. It will not duplicate social media and tools like LinkedIn™, but rather allow for greater leveraging of such networks. The commonalities of the COMMIT experience and military service for our participants will ensure the network remains relatively small with high trust. If you would like more information about the COMMIT COMMunITy or how you can support or join this program, please reach out to Michele Olive, michele@commitfoundation.org.

We conducted workshops in California, Maryland and Montana, serving nearly 50 veterans. The session featured mentorship, planning and community building. It is exciting to imagine what transition might look like 6 or 36 months down the road! We also offered three Seminars in North Carolina, Virginia, and Germany! Combined, over 100 service members and spouses participated and learned about taking those first steps towards a successful transition. These seminars continue to strengthen our partnership with JANUS and NSW Development Group, and we are grateful for the opportunities! WORKSHOPS Menlo Park, Calif. - In September we hosted 18 service members in Menlo Park at a workshop hosted by Andreessen Horowitz. Along with an incredible group of mentors, we had several alumni, many of whom work with a16z, join us for the closing reception. It was inspiring to see what transition might look like 6 months or 36 months down the road!Baltimore, Maryland - Eighteen transitioning service members joined us in Baltimore at Brown Advisory for an amazing two day workshop. With stunning views of Baltimore’s inner-harbor, the participants had the opportunity to meet with incredible mentors as well as many of their coaches. COMMIT board members, staff, and co-founder Guy Filipelli were present as well. Bozeman, Mont. - In October, 10 veterans gathered at the Quiet Waters Ranch outside Bozeman. The participants and mentors embraced the shared experiences of transition and went away with a renewed sense of community. We are so grateful for the continued support from Warriors and Quiet Waters - another truly great veteran service organization.Charlotte, North Carolina - We wrapped up 2022 workshops with a strong cohort of 15 participants joined by nine mentors from the region at the McKinsey &amp; Company headquarters in downtown Charlotte. What a beautiful venue in the heart of the Queen’s City! We are so grateful for the mentors and of course the participants who brought their whole selves to the workshop.SEMINARS JANUS (Germany) - In October, COMMIT was invited by Drew Stamp, co-founder of the nonprofit, Donovan &amp; Bank, and creator of JANUS Project, to host a 1-day seminar in Stuttgart, GE for a group of transitioning service members. The majority of the 50+ attendees were Special Forces/Support and included spouses. COMMIT facilitated the group through a series of transition and values exploration exercises. Additionally, two COMMIT alumni, Brian Cunningham, Navy CAPT (O-6), and Charlie Slosson Amy, COL (Ret) (O-6), spoke to the group, sharing their journey and experiences working with COMMIT. Overall, the event was a great success with overwhelming positive feedback.JANUS (Fort Bragg) - COMMIT strengthened its partnership with the JANUS Project as we presented for a second time this quarter in Fayetteville, NC. The group of 48 participants in the 1-day event included transitioning service members and spouses. Since this group had a wide variety of timelines and ranks, the facilitators led the participants through a value based exercise on Authentic Leadership. Participants found the information to be immediately applicable and a great beginning to trying on their personal values. This program is shaping up to be highly successful and a thought provoking first step to transition. NSW Development Group (Dam Neck) - COMMIT continues its partnership with R4ST to support the Naval Special Warfare community in their transition needs. We presented on-site at the command in Virginia Beach for 10 participants. This presentation was part of their initial implementation of transition seminars that we are thrilled to support as it grows.
