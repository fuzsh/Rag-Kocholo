        "text": "Crisis isn’t a choice.\n\nResponse is.\n\nThe Programs\n\nThe “I Love U Guys” Foundation’s programs for crisis response and post-crisis reunification are used in more than 50,000 schools, districts, departments, agencies, organizations and communities around the world. They are created through the research-based best practices of school administrators, psychologists, public space safety experts, families, and first responders. We’re a powerful conduit uniting this work.\n\nPrograms\n\nThe Training\n\nThe “I Love U Guys” Foundation has built a reputation of training excellence. Accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, the Foundation’s training programs are continuously updated, grounded in real-world applications, and developed in collaboration with hands-on practitioners.\n\nIt was a tragedy that launched The Foundation. It's love that keeps us going. And we thrive because we know that with love, we can work together to protect and restore the joy of youth. We’re doing it. Join us. With you, we got this.\n\nTraining\n\nI realize how unprepared we have beenâ¦ now we have the tools, the resources, and a plan.\n\nSamuel Olsen, Security Monitor, Alamosa High School.\n\nThe Briefings\n\nThe Briefings are nationally-recognized school and community safety symposiums that explore timely topics in school and community safety, as well as training on the Standard Response Protocol and Standard Reunification Method. While the Briefingsâ historical roots are in Colorado, weâve branched out with regional Briefings around the country.\n\nEvents\n\nThe Standard Response Protocol\n\nThe Standard Response Protocol (SRP) provides consistent, clear, shared language and actions among all students, staff and first responders for all hazards. It is action based, and allows organizations, first responders, students, and parents to share a specific vocabulary for quick and coordinated action. It also acts as a tool for training which develops the muscle memory necessary to respond appropriately in moments of crisis.\n\nThe SRP is based on five actions: Hold, Secure, Lockdown, Evacuate, and Shelter.\n\nLearn More\n\nPartner with Love\n\nThe “I Love U Guys” Foundation has never gone it alone. Serving first responders, administrators, and our community is the result of endless collaboration and partnerships. We all have a role to play. Together we’re a powerful conduit that unites this important work.\n\nWe will achieve our mission only with the help of others. Whether youâre a concerned parent, active community member, a school looking for a service project, a company concerned with school or community safety, or a potential underwriter for our work weâre grateful you found us.\n\nLearn More\n\nGot the Program? Get the Training.\n\nDelivered by people who’ve been there, an “I Love U Guys” Foundation training is a special blend of emotional heart and tactical takeaways. Our trainers’ stories from inside and behind school crises illustrate the importance of planning and preparing, while our easy-to-learn protocols and methods show you how.\n\nToday, we also have Remote Delivery for most of our training options. Fewer hugs, same effectiveness.\n\nThe \"I Love U Guys\" Foundation offers training to schools, districts, departments, agencies and organizations. While there is enough material on the website to implement the programs, Foundation training may add a bit more. Please contact us for rates and availability.\n\nSRP/SRM Full Day Train the Trainer Workshop\n\nThe Full-Day Workshop introduces the history, concepts and functionality of the Standard Response Protocol (SRP) and the Standard Reunification Method (SRM), including implementation of the programs, team training, advanced questions, and plenty of opportunities for networking with your peers.\n\nParticipants will come away from this workshop able to train others within their organization on the SRP and the SRM.\n\nRestrictions do apply. (Hover for more info) Completion of the workshop allows attendees to conduct training, at no cost to attendees, on the SRP and SRM within their local organization or jurisdiction for two (2) years. After two years, we encourage individuals to freshen up with our latest Train the Trainer Workshop.\n\nFull Day\n\nReserve Now\n\nTogether-REx (T-REx)\n\nSchool safety software providers have utilized the Standard Reunification Method in their applications for years. We are piloting a new program with Raptor Technologies, T-REx (yes, we know, but we couldnât resist). T-REx is a unique opportunity to learn the practical mechanics of the SRM and how it works using mobile and desktop technology.\n\nT-REx follows the same agenda as the 2-day SRM-REx workshop and functional exercises, with the added bonus of seeing how the process works with technology.\n\nThe âI Love U Guysâ Foundation does not endorse any specific commercial product mentioned on this website, training, or exercises.\n\nReserve Now\n\nSchool Safety and Violent Event Incident Management (SSAVEIM)\n\nReunification after a violent event is a unique event. In nearly all other reunification scenarios, the school or district remains the authority. Not so in a violent event. School Safety and Violent Event Incident Management (SSAVEIM) is a 1-day course training school administrators, teachers, and public safety together.\n\nThe SSAVEIM course is delivered by our Mission Partner C3 Pathways and the National Center for Integrated Emergency Response (NCIER).\n\nThe âI Love U Guysâ Foundation does not endorse any specific commercial product mentioned on this website, training, or exercises.\n\nReserve Now\n\nThe Briefings,\n\nA National Symposium\n\nThe Briefings are a nationally recognized school and community safety symposium. We explore timely topics such as being prepared for small or large incidents, threat management, lessons learned from prior incidents, recovery after a traumatic experience, as well as training on the Standard Response Protocol and Standard Reunification Method.\n\nEach event is unique offering the stories, insights, next steps and lessons learned across the entire spectrum of safety. From prevention through recovery, thought leaders, practitioners and survivors bring you effective methods for keeping schools and communities safe. Participants take away actionable insights they can implement immediately.\n\nOur goal with The Briefings is to bring together an array of leaders, change makers, and explorers to share their knowledge and experience so we can learn from each other, make strong connections, and take away actionable insights and that help advance our collective mission of safer schools and communities.\n\nThe Specific Topic\n\nIn the broad sense, the topic is always safety â physical and emotional safety of students, staff and the community. Our particular emphasis at The Briefings is on the ways we can prepare for, respond to and recover from emergencies. The basis for this is our work developing the Standard Response Protocol and the Standard Reunification Method, and The Briefings always include training on the SRP and the SRM.\n\nAdditionally, The Briefings bring to light, timely topics, new insights and fresh perspectives from our ever-growing network and the ever-evolving world of public safety.\n\nUpcoming Briefings,\n\nA National Symposium\n\nSan Mateo, CA - September 5-6, 2024\n\nRegister Now\n\nIf you would like to be notified via email when we open up registration for future Briefings, a National Symposium, sign up for updates!"
