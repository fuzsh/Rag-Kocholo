        "text": "Leadership and Excellence in Science\n\nThe work in this portfolio contributes to the dual aim of: a) developing global science leaders recognized for their contributions to addressing emerging challenges and opportunities in their communities; and b) supporting the production of excellent science outputs.\n\nScience-based Products\n\nThe work in this portfolio incorporates outputs that contribute to moving early phase discoveries through the entire research value chain, from proof of concept to translation, and eventually making products available to policy-makers and practitioners in order to save lives and support the livelihoods of communities.\n\nScience Solutions for Emerging Global Priorities\n\nThe work in this portfolio focuses on developing robust strategies to address emerging science priorities that are critical beyond just Africa. It will require the exploration, definition and design of impactful research-centric interventions that will effectively drive progress in the identified priority areas, and position SFA Foundation as a key global player.\n\nScience Knowledge in Society\n\nThe work in this portfolio is about making knowledge widely available through the interaction / engagement of science and society in order to optimize for impact. It is focused on positively influencing science institutions and stakeholders that are not part of core research projects but play a key role in strengthening research environments and in the uptake of science knowledge, products and policies."
