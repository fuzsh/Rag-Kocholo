        "text": "Every Donation Counts - You can change the life of a senior today!\n\nBefrienders, founded in 1993, has brought many generations together in a mutually-rewarding relationship by honoring the human spirit and providing life-enriching volunteer opportunities. The program is free and open to seniors age 65 and older and volunteers age 18 and older.\n\nBefrienders is the only organization in the Gallatin Valley that offers these critical companionship services free of charge. Our annual cost to vet, train, match, and support our matches is approximately $500/per match. Our research indicates that it would cost about $3,000/per year to provide similar companionship through a for-profit agency. Your financial support helps us provide our program and services that improve the lives of seniors in our community.\n\nYour financial generosity helps us:\n\nRecruit new Befrienders volunteers\n\nCover the costs of background checks, reference calls, interviews, training and matches by trained professionals.\n\nEnable ongoing supervision and support for every Befrienders match and awaiting seniors.\n\nProvide social activities, opportunities and resources to enrich all Befriender participants.\n\nYour gifts, both large and small, will help us to achieve our mission of helping the isolated and lonely seniors that reside in Gallatin County by matching them with a Befriender.\n\nThank you in advance for your generous support that allows us to make a difference in the lives of our seniors and their families, as well as our volunteers each year.\n\nBefrienders will not share or sell a donor's personal information with anyone or any other organization.\n\nOther Ways to Donate\n\nDonate By Check\n\nIn addition to making a donation online, Befrienders is grateful for gifts made by personal check. Please mail or drop-off your check at our office. The address is Befrienders, 807 North Tracy, Bozeman, MT 59715.\n\nFoundation & Corporate Giving\n\nBefrienders is honored for the support of foundations and corporations through their philanthropic generosity.\n\nIRA Charitable Rollover\n\nIndividuals age 70Â½ can donate up to $100,000 directly from their Individual Retirement Account (IRA), without treating the distribution as taxable income.\n\nStocks & Securities\n\nBefrienders also welcomes generous gifts in the form of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.\n\nQuestions\n\nPlease direct any other questions to Kristin VanDeWalle, Executive Director at 406-522-8169 or info@befriendersbozeman.org\n\nBefrienders is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, EIN 81-0503946, located at 807 North Tracy, Bozeman, MT 59715."
