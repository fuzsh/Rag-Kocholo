Julia, the only child of Octavian (later Augustus Caesar) was born on 30 October in 39 BCE. Octavian’s marriage to Julia’s mother Scribonia was brief, as Octavian quickly divorced to marry Livia Drusilla. Even as the daughter of the emperor, it was Julia’s fate to be married off either in political alliance or to her father’s intended heirs. Julia endured several imposed marriages, eventually to Livia’s son Tiberius.

Julia was a witty and warm conversationalist and had a set of aristocratic admirers, but nothing foreshadowed her father’s public denunciation of alleged adulteries and her expulsion to the tiny island of Pandateria (Ventotene) in the Gulf of Naples late in 2 BCE. The last third of Julia’s life was spent in exile; she starved to death in 14.

Julia’s children were left to various fates, perhaps most famously embodied by Agrippina the Elder, who was a prominent Roman citizen and also the mother of Caligula. The name Julia, which indicated a familial relationship to the Julii Caesars, continued to be popular amid that aristocratic bloodline.
