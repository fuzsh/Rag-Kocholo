        "text": "Full Name: Tiberius Claudius Nero\n\nProfession: Roman Emperor\n\nBiography: Tiberius was the second Roman Emperor, ruling from AD 14 to 37. He was known for his military conquests and effective administration, but his reign was marked by controversy and a difficult relationship with the Roman Senate.\n\nTiberius was born into a prominent Roman family. His mother married Emperor Augustus, making Tiberius his stepson. As a youth, Tiberius gained public attention by delivering his father's eulogy and participating in a triumphal procession with Augustus.\n\nIn his early career, Tiberius led several successful military campaigns, including in Pannonia and Germania. He also showed diplomatic skill by negotiating with Parthia to recover lost Roman standards.\n\nTiberius' personal life was complicated. His first marriage to Vipsania Agrippina was happy, but Augustus forced him to divorce her and marry Julia the Elder. This second marriage was unhappy and ended in scandal.\n\nAfter the deaths of Augustus' grandsons, Tiberius became the heir to the empire. He adopted his nephew Germanicus as his own successor. When Augustus died, Tiberius became emperor at the age of 55.\n\nAs emperor, Tiberius was an capable administrator but struggled in his relationship with the Senate. He became increasingly reclusive after the deaths of Germanicus and his son Drusus. In AD 26, Tiberius retired to Capri, leaving much of the administration to Sejanus, his trusted advisor.\n\nSejanus was later executed for treason, leading to a series of purges that damaged Tiberius' reputation. In his final years, Tiberius became more isolated and paranoid. He died in AD 37 and was succeeded by Caligula.\n\nBorn: November 16, 42 BC\n\nBirthplace: Rome, Roman Empire\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio"
