        "text": "Suetonius: The Twelve Caesars - Index OP\n\nOctavia the Younger (69BC – c. 9BC), also known as Octavia Minor or simply Octavia, was the sister of the first Roman Emperor, Augustus (known also as Octavian), half-sister of Octavia the Elder, and fourth wife of Mark Antony. She was also the mother-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, maternal grandmother of the Emperor Claudius, and paternal great-grandmother and maternal great-great grandmother of the Emperor Nero. Before 54BC her stepfather arranged her marriage to Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor, consul in 50BC.\n\nBookOneXXVII In 54BC, her great-uncle Julius Caesar is said to have been anxious for her to divorce her husband so that she could marry Pompey who had just lost his wife Julia (Julius Caesar’s daughter, and thus Octavia’s cousin once removed). However, Pompey declined the proposal marrying Cornelia Metella. Her husband Gaius Marcellus continued to oppose Julius Caesar particularly during the crucial year of his consulship 50BC.\n\nBookTwoIV Mentioned, as sister of Augustus.\n\nBookTwoXXIX The Porticus Octaviae built by Augustus some time after 27BC in place of the Porticus Metelli, enclosed within its colonnaded walks the temples of Jupiter Stator and Juno Regina, next to the Theatre of Marcellus.\n\nBookTwoLXI Her death, variously dated to 11BC - 9BC.\n\nBookTwoLXIII BookThreeVI Her son Marcellus who married Julia, and daughter Claudia Marcella the Elder who married Agrippa.\n\nBookTwoLXIV Germanicus was her grandson (son of her daughter by Mark Antony, Antonia the Younger).\n\nBookTwoLXXIII She made clothes for Augustus.\n\nBookFiveXLI She warned the young Claudius over the sensitivity of the work on history he was writing.\n\nOctavia the Elder also known as Octavia Major was the daughter of the Roman governor and senator Gaius Octavius by his first wife, Ancharia. She was also an elder half-sister to Octavia the Younger and the Emperor Augustus.\n\nBookTwoIV Mentioned.\n\nOctavia, Claudia, (c. 40AD - 62AD) was a daughter of Claudius by his third marriage to Valeria Messalina. Claudius adopted Agrippina the Younger’s son Nero as his son and heir and arranged for Octavia and Nero to marry in 53AD. Nero subsequently banished Octavia to the island of Pandateria on a false charge of adultery, and finally had her executed.\n\nBookFiveXXIV Her prospective husband was Lucius Junius Silanus, but the engagement was ended through Agrippina’s machinations.\n\nBookFiveXXVII Mentioned.\n\nBookFiveXXIX Her fiancée Lucius Silanus was executed on Claudius’s orders.\n\nBookSixVII Her marriage with Nero\n\nBookSixXXXV BookSixXLVI Her persecution by Nero ending in her execution.\n\nBookSixLVII Nero died on the anniversary of her murder (9th June).\n\nOctavius was a mentally disturbed individual\n\nBookOneXLIX His abuse of Caesar, derived from the relationship with Nicomedes.\n\nOctavius, of Velitrae, was a military leader, of the Octavii family.\n\nBookTwoI Mentioned.\n\nOctavius, Gaius, the father of Augustus, was praetor in 61BC.

He survived the Battle of Cannae, and in 205BC served in Sicily under the praetor Lucius Aemilius Papus.\n\nBookTwoII Mentioned.\n\nOctavius, Gaius was the paternal grandfather of Augustus, possessed considerable property, and lived quietly in his villa at Velitrae. He probably augmented his income by money-lending, for both Mark Antony and Cassius Parmensis called Augustus the grandson of a money-lender\n\nBookTwoII BookTwoVI BookTwoXCIV Mentioned.\n\nOctavius, Gnaeus and Gaius were the two sons of Octavius Rufus. The elder held high office while the younger remained a simple equestrian.\n\nBookTwoII Mentioned.\n\nOctavius, see Augustus\n\nOctavius Rufus, Gaius (properly Gnaeus) quaestor c. 230BC, was the paternal ancestor of Augustus.\n\nBookTwoII Mentioned.\n\nOculata.

He managed the dictator’s private affairs during his absence from Rome, and, together with Lucius Cornelius Balbus, exercised considerable influence in the city. According to Suetonius many authorities considered Oppius to have written the histories of the Spanish, African and Alexandrian wars which are printed among the works of Caesar. It is now generally held that he may possibly be the author only of the last. He also wrote a life of Caesar and the elder Scipio.\n\nBookOneLII Supposedly knew of Caesarion’s paternity.\n\nBookOneLIII His comment on Caesar’s indifference to food.\n\nBookOneLVI His possible authorship of some of Caesar’s memoirs.\n\nBookOneLXXII Caesar’s kindness to him.\n\nOppius Sabinus, Gaius, was consul in 84AD, and Governor of Moesia in 85AD. In that year, he fought the Dacians near Novae. His force was destroyed and Sabinus decapitated.\n\nBookEightXLII Mentioned.\n\nOrcus was a god of the underworld in Roman mythology, more equivalent to the Roman Pluto than the Greek Hades. Orcus was by extension a name for the Underworld\n\nBookSixXXXIX Nero is identified ironically as a ‘Lord of the Dead’.\n\nBookSevenXXXI Otho was sacrificing to Dis, originally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land, and underground mineral wealth, later commonly equated with the Roman deities Pluto and Orcus, becoming an underworld deity.\n\nOrestes, in Greek mythology, was the son of Agamemnon, murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, in retribution for the sacrifice of their daughter Iphigeneia in order to obtain favorable winds for the Greek voyage to Troy. Orestes avenged his father’s death by slaying his mother and her lover Aegisthus.\n\nBookSixXXXIX His murder of his mother.\n\nOstia, the modern archaeological site known as Ostia Antica, was the main port for ancient Rome (19 miles northeast) and close to the modern town of Ostia. Once at the mouth (ostia) of the Tiber, due to silting and a drop in sea level, the site now lies 2 miles from the sea. The site is noted for the excellent preservation of its buildings, frescoes and mosaics. In 68BC, the town was sacked by pirates and destroyed. A walled town was re-built, by Cicero. The town was further developed under the influence of Tiberius, who commissioned its first Forum. A new harbor was excavated by Claudius. This harbour silted up, and another was built by Trajan and completed in 113AD. Ostia contained the earliest synagogue yet identified in Europe.\n\nBookThreeX BookThreeXI Tiberius departed for Rhodes from Ostia in 6BC.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula brought the ashes of his mother and brother Nero there.\n\nBookFourLV Mentioned as a point of departure for North Africa.\n\nBookFiveXII Claudius on a journey there.\n\nBookFiveXVII Claudius sailed to Britain from there, but landed at Marseilles in 43AD.\n\nBookFiveXX The Claudian harbour was started in 42AD and completed by Nero in 64AD.\n\nBookFiveXXIV Claudius deprived the quaestors of their duties at Ostia.\n\nBookFiveXXV BookEightVIII Claudius stationed troops there as firefighters.\n\nBookFiveXXXVIII Claudius reprimanded its citizens for failing to meet him with boats when he reached the mouth of the Tiber.\n\nBookFiveXL Claudius reacted angrily to a petition of the citizens.\n\nBookSixXVI Nero planned to extend Rome’s walls to Ostia and build a sea-canal from there to the City.\n\nBookSixXXVII Nero sailed the Tiber to Ostia on pleasure cruises.\n\nBookSixXXXI Nero’s project to connect Ostia and Misenum.\n\nBookSixXLVII Nero thought of fleeing to Ostia during his last days.\n\nOtho, Marcus Salvius (28th April 32AD – 69AD), also called Marcus Salvius Otho Caesar Augustus, was Emperor for three months, from 15 January to 16 April 69AD. He was the second emperor of the Year of the Four Emperors. Suetonius appears to miscalculate his age, 36, at death/interment, and also the length of his reign, ninety-two days, which agrees with Cassius Dio’s ninety if the day Otho seized power and the day of his death are excluded from the reign.\n\nBookSevenVI His reign foreshadowed.\n\nBookSevenXVII The mutiny in Germany, and Galba’s error, opened the way to his accession.\n\nBookSevenXIX His coup against Galba.\n\nBookSevenXX Galba’s severed head delivered to him.\n\nBookSevenXXIV Suetonius’ life of Otho follows.\n\nBookSevenXLIV BookEightV BookEightVI Vitellius attacked him after he heard news of Galba’s assassination.\n\nBookSevenXLV Vitellius received news of Otho’s death while still in Gaul.\n\nBookEightXLVI Mentioned.\n\nPaconius, Marcus, was a legatus of Gaius Junius Silanus (consul in 10AD, and proconsul of Asia), and one of his accusers in 22AD (prior to Silanus’ banishment by Tiberius to the island of Cynthus). He was the father of Paconius Agrippinus the stoic philosopher.\n\nBookThreeLXI He was executed by Tiberius for treason.\n\nPacuvius, Marcus (220BC - 130BC) was the greatest of the tragic poets of ancient Rome prior to Lucius Accius. He was the nephew and pupil of Ennius.\n\nBookOneLXXXIV A quotation from his play Armorum Judicium.\n\nPaetus, Publius Clodius Thrasea, see Clodius\n\nPalatine Hill, the hill is the most central of the Seven Hills of Rome and one of the most ancient parts of the city. It stands 40 metres above the Forum Romanum, looking down on it on one side, and on the Circus Maximus on the other. Many affluent Romans of the Republican period had their residences there. During the Empire several emperors resided there; in fact, the ruins of the palaces of Augustus, Tiberius, and Domitian can still be seen. Augustus also built a temple to Apollo there, beside his own palace. The Palatine Hill was also the site of the festival of the Lupercalia.\n\nBookTwoV Augustus born there in the Ox-Heads quarter.\n\nBookTwoLVII BookTwoLXXII Augustus’ house there destroyed by fire in 3AD, and rebuilt.\n\nBookThreeV Tiberius born on the Palatine.\n\nBookFourLVI The Palatine Games mentioned were held in honour of Augustus. Caligula was assassinated on the last day, the fourth, January 24th 41AD.\n\nBookSixXXXI BookSixXXXVIII Nero’s Golden House, the Domus Aurea complex, covered parts of the slopes of the Palatine, Esquiline and Caelian hills.\n\nPalfurius Sura, was a courtier under Nero, expelled from the Senate by Vespasian and re-instated by Domitian under whom he acted as an informer. He was a Stoic, and orator of some note. He was tried and executed under Trajan.\n\nBookEightXLIX A public call for his re-instatement in the Senate.\n\nPallas, Marcus Antonius, (c. 1AD – 63AD) was a prominent Greek freedman and secretary during the reigns of the Emperors Claudius and Nero. His younger brother was Marcus Antonius Felix, procurator of Iudaea. Pallas was originally a slave of Antonia the Younger, Claudius’s mother. He served as secretary to the Treasury under Claudius and amassed great wealth. He was dismissed by Nero in 55AD and killed in 63AD.\n\nBookFiveXXVIII A favourite of Claudius.\n\nBookSixXXXV Poisoned by Nero.\n\nPalumbus, meaning the Dove, was a gladiator, whose name Claudius made a joke on.\n\nBookFiveXXI Mentioned.\n\nPandataria, or Pandateria, the modern Ventotene, is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, 25 nautical miles off the coast of Gaeta at the border between Lazio and Campania. It is the remains of an ancient volcano, and part of the Pontine Islands. The island has a length of 3 kilometres and a maximum width of about 800 metres. It is the island to which Augustus banished his daughter Julia the Elder in 2BC, and Tiberius banished his grandniece Agrippina the Elder in 29AD. It was also where Agrippina's youngest daughter, Julia Livilla was exiled twice; by her brother Caligula for plotting to depose him, and by her uncle, Claudius, at the instigation of his wife, Messalina, in 41AD. Claudia Octavia, the first wife of Nero, was banished to Pandateria in 62AD and executed on the orders of her husband.\n\nBookThreeLIII Agrippina’s banishment there.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula recovered Agrippina’s ashes from there in 37AD.\n\nPaneros, was a noted moneylender under Nero.\n\nBookSixXXX Nero lavished gifts and money on him.\n\nPannonians were the Illyrian inhabitants of Pannonia the Roman province, bounded north and east by the Danube, coterminous westward with Noricum and upper Italy, and southward with Dalmatia and upper Moesia. In 35BC as allies of the Dalmatians they were attacked by Augustus, who conquered and occupied Siscia (Sisak). The country was not, however subdued until 9BC, when it was incorporated into Illyricum, the frontier of which was thus extended as far as the Danube. In 6AD, the Pannonians, with the Dalmatians and other Illyrian tribes, revolted, and were overcome by Tiberius and Germanicus, after a three year campaign. Later Illyricum was dissolved, its lands divided between two new provinces of Pannonia in the north and Dalmatia in the south.\n\nBookTwoXX BookTwoXXI Augustus’ generals campaigned there.\n\nBookThreeXVII Tiberius’ successful campaign there in 6AD - 9AD.\n\nBookThreeXX Bato was a chieftain of the Pannonians.\n\nBookSevenXXXII Otho drew on troops from Pannonia in 69AD.\n\nBookSevenL The legions in Pannonia swore allegiance to Vespasian in 69AD.\n\nPansa, see Vibius\n\nPaphos, old Paphos, modern Kouklia, on Cyprus, was not far distant from the Zephyrium promontory and the mouth of the River Bocarus, about 16 kilometres from new Paphos, the modern city. The temple of Venus-Aphrodite there was rebuilt by Vespasian after an earthquake.\n\nBookEightXXX Titus consulted the oracle of Venus-Aphrodite there.\n\nParilia, or Palilia, was the festival celebrated at Rome every year on the 21st of April, in honour of Pales, the tutelary divinity of shepherds. This was also the day of the year on which Romulus supposedly commenced the building of the city, so that the festival was at the same time solemnized as the birthday of Rome itself.\n\nBookFourXVI Caligula’s accession was presumably dated by the Senate decree as taking place on the Parilia. He had entered Rome on the 28th March 37AD, after Tiberius’s death on the 16th.\n\nParis, Lucius Domitius, was an actor in the Roman theatre of Nero’s time. He was a slave of Domitia Lepida who became wealthy enough to buy his freedom, adding her praenomen and cognomen to his own name. Nero later declared him freeborn, despite his involvement in Lepida’s plotting.\n\nBookSixLIV It was claimed he was executed by Nero (in 67AD), out of jealousy.\n\nParis was the prince of Troy who abducted and married Helen of Sparta, thereby initiating the Trojan War, according to Homer’s Iliad.\n\nBookEightXLVI Oenone was a mountain nymph, Paris’s first wife, whom he abandoned for Helen.\n\nParis was an actor in the Roman theatre of Domitian’s time. According to Suetonius he had an affair with Domitian’s wife Domitia Augusta.\n\nBookEightXXXIX Mentioned.\n\nBookEightXLVI Perhaps this implies that he had Paris executed also.\n\nParrhasius of Ephesus was the son of Evenor. He settled in Athens, and was distinguished as a painter before 399BC. His picture of Theseus adorned the Capitol in Rome. His other works, besides the obscene subjects with which he is said to have amused his leisure, are chiefly mythological groups.\n\nBookThreeXLIV An erotic painting by him.\n\nParthenius of Nicaea, or Myrlea in Bithynia, was a Greek grammarian and poet. He was taken prisoner by Cinna during the Mithridatic Wars and brought to Rome in 72BC. He subsequently visited Neapolis, where he taught Greek to Virgil, according to Macrobius. He is said to have lived until the accession of Tiberius in 14AD. He was a writer of elegies, especially dirges, and of short epic poems, and was sometimes called ‘the last of the Alexandrians’.\n\nBookThreeLXX One of Tiberius’s favourite poets.\n\nParthenius was Domitian’s Head Valet, who took part in the conspiracy to assassinate the Emperor in 96AD. He persuaded Nerva to take power but was killed shortly afterwards by soldiers, along with the other conspirators.\n\nBookEightLII BookEightLIII His involvement in the plot.\n\nParthians, Parthia is a region of north-eastern Iran, best known for having been the political and cultural base of the Arsacid dynasty, rulers of the Parthian Empire. The Romans and Parthians fought a series of wars beginning with Crassus’ invasion in 52BC - 53BC and ending with Macrinus’ ignominious defeat and retreat in 217AD. During this time it became clear to both sides that a natural boundary existed in northern Mesopotamia beyond which it was difficult, if not impossible, for either side to maintain a permanent foothold.\n\nBookOneXLIV BookTwoVIII Caesar’s plans to attack them in 45BC.\n\nBookOneLXXIX It was prophesied that only a king would conquer them.\n\nBookTwoXIX Asinius Epicadus a mixed-race conspirator of Parthian descent.\n\nBookTwoXXI They accepted Augustus’ claim to Armenia (Mark Antony had annexed in it 34BC)\n\nBookTwoXLIII Augustus paraded Parthian hostages at the Games.\n\nBookThreeIX Crassus lost the standards there, and was killed, in 53BC.\n\nBookThreeXVI They send envoys to Augustus (c. 4AD).\n\nBookThreeXLI Allowed to overrun Armenia c. 30AD - 37AD.\n\nBookThreeXLIX Vonones I was king of Parthia and later Armenia.\n\nBookFourV Tokens of mourning in the Parthian court at Germanicus’s death.\n\nBookFiveXXV Their envoys at the court of Claudius.\n\nBookSixXXXIX The Parthians were noted archers, firing from horseback.\n\nBookSixXLVII Nero considered throwing himself on their mercy during his last days.\n\nBookSixLVII Their support mentioned for the Pseudo-Neros, who claimed to be reincarnations of Nero (c. 80AD and 88AD).\n\nBookSevenXXXVII Artabanus II their king (c. 10AD - 38AD).\n\nBookEightVI BookEightXXXVIII Vologases 1 was their king (c. 51AD - 78AD)\n\nBookEightXXIII Their king referred to, possibly the accession of Vologases II, or Pacorus II his uncle who deposed him c. 79AD.\n\nPasiphae, the wife of Minos of Crete in Greek mythology, was impregnated by a bull from the sea.\n\nBookSixXII The myth was enacted at Nero’s entertainment.\n\nBookSevenII Galba traced his maternal ancestry back to Pasiphae.\n\nPassienus Crispus, Gaius Sallustius (d. 47AD) was the adopted grandson and biological great, great nephew of the historian Sallust. He was consul in 27AD and 44AD. His first marriage was to Augustus’ great niece Domitia in 33AD. Passienus married Agrippina the Younger in 41AD. His stepson was Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who would later become the Roman Emperor Nero. Passienus died in 47AD, possibly poisoned by his wife.\n\nBookSixVI He bequeathefd an inheritance to his stepson Nero.\n\nPatavium, the modern Padua, is on the Bacchiglione River, 40 km west of Venice and 29 km southeast of Vicenza. The Brenta River, which once ran through the city, still touches the northern districts. To the city’s south west lie the Euganean Hills. Padua claims to be the oldest city in northern Italy. According to tradition it was founded in 1183BC by the Trojan prince Antenor. The city was a Roman municipium from 45BC. The hot springs at Abano Terme, 10km southwest, were known to the Romans as Aponi fons (the springs of Aponus, or perhaps Maponus the Celtic god equated with Apollo, and celebrated as Apollo Aponus at Ribchester). An oracle of Geryon (whose myth is connected to Heracles, the sun-hero, and whose island lay in the far west, and who is perhaps therefore a mask of Apollo) was situated nearby, and the sortes Praenestinae, small inscribed bronze cylinders found there in the 16th century, may have been the oracular lots.\n\nBookThreeXIV Tiberius consulted the oracle nearby.\n\nPatrobius Neronianus was a favourite freedman of Nero’s put to death by Galba in 68AD after being paraded in chains through Rome.\n\nBookSevenXX His freedman avenged him, by purchasing Galba’s severed head in order to throw it down on the spot where his patron was killed.\n\nPaulus, see Aemilius\n\nPedius, Quintus (d. 43BC) was the great nephew of Julius Caesar. In 57BC he served as general during Caesar’s conquest of Gaul. During the Civil War in 49BC, he allied himself with Caesar. In 48BC, he was promoted to the praetorship in Rome and in that year killed Titus Annius Milo. In early 45BC, he served as a legatus against Sextus Pompeius in Spain. Pedius claimed victory and Caesar honored him with a triumph and the title of proconsul. In Caesar’s will, Pedius was named as an heir, but renounced his inheritance in favor of the main heir, his cousin Octavian (Augustus). In August 43BC, Octavian and Pedius were elected as consuls after marching on Rome with an army. During the consulship, Pedius created a law called the Lex Pedia which sentenced the murderers of Caesar or those who called for Caesar’s death. Pedius controlled Rome, while Octavian left for Northern Italy to join Mark Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, in forming the Second Triumvirate.\n\nBookOneLXXXIII He inherited an eighth of Caesar’s estate.\n\nBookSixIII Gnaeus Domitius was condemned under the Lex Pedia.\n\nBookSevenIII Galba’s great-grandfather condemned under the Lex Pedia.\n\nPeloponnese, is the large peninsula and region in southern Greece, forming the part of the country south of the Gulf of Corinth. During the late Middle Ages and the Ottoman era, the peninsula was known as the Morea a name still in colloquial use.\n\nBookTwoXVII Augustus’ met with a storm at sea between there and Aetolia in 30BC.\n\nPergamon, Pergamum or Pérgamo was an ancient Greek city in modern-day Turkey, in Mysia, today located 16 miles (26 km) from the Aegean on a promontory on the north side of the river Caicus (modern Bakırçay), and was the capital of the Kingdom of Pergamon during the Hellenistic period, under the Attalid dynasty, 281BC – 133BC. The main sites of ancient Pergamon are to the north and west of the modern city of Bergama.\n\nBookTwoLXXXIX Augustus studied under Apollodorus of Pergamon.\n\nPerusia, modern Perugia, first appears as one of the 12 confederate cities of Etruria. It is first mentioned in the account of the war of 310/309BC between the Etruscans and the Romans. In 216BC and 205BC it assisted Rome in the Hannibalic war, but afterward it is not mentioned until 41BC - 40BC, when Lucius Antonius took refuge there and the city was reduced by Octavian after a long siege.\n\nBookTwoIX BookTwoXIV BookTwoXV Augustus (Octavian) involved in civil war there.\n\nBookTwoXCVI A prophecy of Augustus’ victory there.\n\nBookThreeIV Tiberius father, Tiberius Nero, fought there.\n\nPetreius, Marcus (110BC – April 46BC) was a politician and general. He cornered and killed the notorious rebel Catiline at Pistoria. From 55BC, he and Lucius Afranius administered the Spanish provinces as Legates, while the official governor Pompey remained in Rome. After the outbreak of the Civil War in 49BC, Petreius and Afranius marched against Caesar, who wished to secure Spain before moving against Pompey in Greece. The two Legates were forced to capitulate and disband their army on August 2 at Ilerda. Caesar allowed Petreius and Afranius their freedom, and the two traveled to Greece to join Pompey. After Pompey’s defeat at Pharsalus, they fled from the Peloponnese to North Africa, where Petreius continued to serve as Legate. Together with Titus Labienus, Petreius again achieved several successes against Caesar. After the defeat of the Pompeians at Thapsus, Petreius fled with the Numidian King, Juba. As they realized the hopelessness of their situation, Petreius and Juba took their lives on an estate near Zama: Petreius and Juba decided upon a duel, in which Petreius killed Juba. Petreius then took his own life with the help of a slave.\n\nBookOneXXXIV Defeated by Caesar in Spain.\n\nBookOneLXXV His behaviour at Ilerda.\n\nPetronia was the first wife (before 40AD) of the emperor Vitellius and the daughter of Petronius Pontius Nigrinus.

He was king of the Greek tribe of Molossians, of the royal Aeacid house (from c. 297BC), and later became King of Epirus (306BC - 302BC, 297BC - 272BC) and Macedon (288BC - 284BC, 273BC - 272BC). He was one of the strongest opponents of earlyRome. Some of his battles, though successful, cost him heavy losses, from which the term ‘Pyrrhic victory’ was coined. He is the subject of one of Plutarch’s Parallel Lives.\n\nBookOneXXXIX BookSixXII The Pyrrhic sword dance is unrelated, and appears to have been a dance with weapons and armour, miming warfare. The name is possibly derived from the mythological Pyrrhus (Neoptolemus) the son of Achilles."
