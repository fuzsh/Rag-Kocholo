        "meta_description": "They may not have met in a little travel bookshop in Notting Hill, but Julia Roberts and her husband Danny Moder are clearly a match made in heaven. The couple, who married in July 2002, share three children; twins Hazel and Phinnaeus, 14, and 11-year-old Henry. But how much do we really know about the hubby of one of the most famous women in the world? Find out everything you need to know about Danny and his relationship with Julia, including how they met, where they got engaged, and where they tied the knot…\n\nDaniel and Julia with their three children\n\n## Who is Danny Moder?\n\nDaniel Moder is a cinematographer and camera operator. Born and raised in LA, the 49-year-old began his career in Hollywood as a production assistant on the 1995 Crimson Tide, and has since gone on to work as a camera operator on Spider Man 3, Mr & Mrs Smith and Point Break, and as a cinematographer on Ibiza, Animal Kingdom and The Normal Heart, for which he was nominated an Emmy.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2002\n\n## How did he meet Julia Roberts?\n\nDanny and Julia met on the set of The Mexican back in 2002. Both were in relationships at the time, as Julia was dating Miss Congeniality star Benjamin Bratt, and Daniel was married to make-up artist Vera Steimberg. At the time, it was reported that Julia wore a homemade T-shirt which read 'a low Vera' during Vera and Danny's split.\n\nJulia opened up about the T-shirt in an interview with Oprah\n\nDenying that their relationship was the cause of Danny's split from Vera in an interview with Oprah, the Notting Hill star explained: \"He sorted his whole thing out, separate and apart from me. And I sorted my life out, separate and apart from him. I think that's the only reason we were able to ultimately fall in love with each other and be together.\" When she was asked about the T-shirt, she said: \"You know what that was about? It was private. I stand by my T-shirt.\"\n\nREAD: Julia Roberts shares very rare personal photo with husband Danny Moder\n\n## Their engagement and marriage\n\nJulia and Danny's relationship has always been very low-key, so much so that rather than wearing a lavish engagement ring, Julia opted for a simple emerald ring that was reportedly purchased at a shopping centre for around £3,000. The pair tied the knot in 2002 at Julia's ranch in New Mexico, but have always kept details about their special day under wraps. According to AOL News, guests revealed that Julia wore a pink cotton dress for the ceremony, while Danny wore a ruffled shirt.\n\nDanny is an Emmy-nominated cinematographer\n\n## Rumours of split\n\nDespite rumours that the pair had ended their relationship after they hadn't been spotted together for several months, Julia shut down the reports by sharing a lovely photo of herself enjoying a holiday with her husband. In the photo, the pair are laughing and hugging each other, and the actress wrote: \"Oh Summer, thank you! You made us happy and brave. We embraced every moment of sun drenched JOY. #familytime.\"\n\nLike this story? Sign up to our newsletter to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.",
