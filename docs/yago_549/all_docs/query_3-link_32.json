        "text": "On the 21st of February 4 CE, Gaius Caesar, the eldest son of Augustus’ daughter Julia, died in Anatolia aged twenty-three. Despite his vast inexperience, the emperor had called upon his young grandson when a revolt had been staged in Armenia, giving him proconsular powers and trusted advisors to combat the unrest. Gaius had invaded Armenia in 2 CE and come away injured, eventually succumbing to the sickness it caused him.\n\nGaius’ younger brother, Lucius, had been similarly unfortunate. In mid-2 CE, aged only eighteen, he had fallen sick in Gaul and died shortly after. The deaths of both he and his elder brother left Augustus in a difficult position: he was now heirless, with no sons of his own. Gaius and Lucius—sons of not only Augustus’ daughter Julia, but his trusted general and childhood friend, Marcus Agrippa—had been adopted by Augustus as his own son in 17 BCE. Inheritance was a legitimate reason for adoption in Rome, applying not only to children but to adults as well. Augustus himself was made the heir of Julius Caesar, his great uncle, in the dictator’s will. It was clear, then, what were Augustus’ intentions in making sons of his grandsons.\n\nThe Augustan succession had been complicated by the fact that Augustus and his wife, Livia, had never produced a single living child, let alone a son. Augustus’ only child was Julia, born to his previous wife Scribonia on the day he divorced her; and Augustus’ original presumed heir, his nephew Marcellus—also the husband of Julia—had died in 23 BCE. Julia was only widowed for a short while before she was remarried to Agrippa, and they would go on to have five children, three being sons: Gaius and Lucius, but also Agrippa Postumus, the youngest, thus named since he was born after the death of his father. In the aftermath of the death of his older brothers, Postumus, along with Livia’s eldest son Tiberius, was adopted by Augustus as heir, but Postumus would not last—he was exiled in 6 CE, for undisclosed crimes relating to what sources describe as a “violent” and “depraved” nature.\n\nCoins such as CC.386 show Gaius and Lucius standing side-by-side as equals. It is interesting in that while Gaius is the elder brother by several years, Lucius is presented more or less as his equal in the succession—it is possible that this was a measure designed to prepare Rome for the possibility that Gaius could die and Lucius succeed instead. Mortality in youth was far from unheard of, and throughout the empire most intended successors would never ascend to their father’s throne. No son—or indeed grandson—of the Julio-Claudian dynasty would succeed their father as emperor. The first emperor to do so at all would be Titus, who succeeded his father Vespasian in 79 CE—seventy-five years and eight emperors after the death of Gaius Caesar.\n\nOf course, it would be Tiberius, Augustus’ stepson, who eventually succeeded him in 14 CE. But if it was a hereditary succession that Augustus wanted, then he could rest assured; the third emperor, Caligula, would be his great-grandson: the son of Gaius and Lucius’ younger sister, Agrippina.\n\nBlog credit: Emily Deakin, Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology Graduate and Garstang Museum Senior Volunteer."
