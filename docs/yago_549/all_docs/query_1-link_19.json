        "text": "Roma\n\nSobriquet\n\nAppearance\n\nJulia is an aging cougar whose dark hair is shot through with white, save when she\n\ndarkens it with dyes. Despite giving birth to five children, she is still physically\n\nfit and more sexually active than ever. Even in exile she dresses well in silk dresses\n\nand the best jewelry available.\n\nBehavior\n\nJulia is extremely well educated and familiar with all the classic works of both philosophy\n\nand literature. She is also politically active, but influences events from behind the scenes\n\nthrough her stable of affluent and politically connected lovers. In person, Julia is flirtatious\n\nand playful, acting decades younger than she actually is, nor is this an act as she genuinely\n\nenjoys her men and the games that they play. She is remarkably skillful at seduction and\n\noften uses sex as a weapon. But there are two men she detests, her father Augustus and her\n\nthird husband Tiberius who was a disappointment in the marriage bed. Believing herself\n\nabove prosecution she took every opportunity to shame Tiberius by flaunting her peccadilloes,\n\nwhich embarrassed her father and ultimately led to her banishment. None of this has stopped\n\nher from her amorous pursuits, rather it has whetted her appetite for revenge, which she\n\nplots from her island prison.\n\nHistory\n\nJulia the Elder (30 October 39 BC-14 AD) was the daughter of the Roman emperor\n\nAugustus and the stepsister and second wife of Tiberius.\n\nJulia was the daughter of Octavian and his wife Scribonia, and she was betrothed to Mark Antony's\n\nson Marcus Antonius Antyllus before the engagement was called off due to the start of Antony's Civil War\n\nwith her father.\n\nIn 25 BC, at the age of fourteen, she married her cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who was considered as\n\nAugustus' likely heir until his death in 23 BC. In 21 BC, she remarried to Augustus' friend and general\n\nMarcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who was 25 years older than her; she had five children with him: Gaius Caesar,\n\nJulia the Younger, Lucius Caesar, Agrippina the Elder, and Agrippa Postumus.\n\nAfter the death of Agrippa in 12 BC, she remarried to Augustus' stepson Tiberius in 11 BC. She felt that\n\nher marriage was unequal, and she denounced her husband to her father in a letter. She separated with her\n\nhusband in 6 BC, and, in 2 BC, she was arrested for adultery and treason. Reluctant to exile her, Augustus\n\nsent her into exile to an island off the coast of Latium, and she was moved to Rhegium on the mainland in\n\n4 AD.\n\nWhile living in a villa at Antium, she began an affair with her son Lucius' friend Gaius Plautius Silanus,\n\nwhom Empress Livia hired to spy on Julia and discover her infidelities, causing Augustus to banish her from\n\nRome.\n\nRecent Events\n\nJulia has kept in close contact with her circle of lovers and admirers in Rome\n\nand understands that the disastrous Battle of Teutoburg Forest is an opportunity\n\nfor both herself and her son. She has been in contact with Agrippa's father and\n\nhas received his aid in her quest for revenge.\n\nHer Fate\n\nShe is destined to die on a small, rocky island in 14 AD, just after Augustus' death.\n\nStatistics\n\nAttributes: Strength 2, Dexterity 2, Stamina 2; Charisma 3, Manipulation 4, Appearance 4;\n\nPerception 3, Intelligence 5, Wits 4\n\nAbilities: Academics 2, Athletics 3, Awareness 1, Brawl 1, Leadership 4, Survival 1, Marksmanship 1,\n\nPolitics 5, Stealth 1.\n\nJoin Battle: 3\n\nAttacks\n\nClinch: Accuracy 3, Damage 3B, Parry DV â€”, Speed 6, P\n\nUnarmed, Heavy: Accuracy 2, Damage 6B, Parry DV 0, Speed 5\n\nUnarmed, Light: Accuracy 4, Damage 3B, Parry DV 2, Speed 4\n\nDagger: Accuracy 3, Damage 4L, Parry +0, Speed 4\n\nSoak: 0L/2B\n\nHealth Levels: -0/-1/-1/-2/-2/-4/Incap\n\nDodge: 3\n\nWillpower: 4"
