        "text": "Many scholars have studied how Tiberius relied upon, or was compelled to relate to, the image of his deified adoptive father Augustus (1). But in many ways Tiberius was just as dependent upon the image of his adopted son Germanicus. We have been conditioned by reading Tacitus and other ancient historians to envision Tiberius as considering the death of Germanicus to be one of the happier moments of his reign (see esp. Ann. 4, 1, 1) (2). The documents published after the death of Germanicus present a different view. We can see in the Tabula Hebana, Tabula Siarensis, and Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone how the relationship between Tiberius and these two men was presented to the subjects of the empire, subjects who were devoted to the memory of Augustus and the family of Germanicus. This paper examines the subtle way in which these documents focus not so much on Tiberius as princeps (the present), but as the link between the reign of Augustus (the past) and the dynasty which would continue through the line of Germanicus (the future) (3).\n\nUPDATED August 2016 Again March 2024 Translator’s note: Domaszewski’s article is little read today, but it should be. I have updated and fixed some translation errors, March 2014. Domaszewski (Dom-a-CHEF-ski) has several good ideas and popularized the identifications of Drusus, Antonia, and Germanicus. But he also came up with the bad theory of the Domitius Ahenobarbus family, based on the romantic appeal of seeing the two Antonia sisters close together and Nero’s father on the Ara Pacis without any reasoning. The identification of Nero’s father is completely unsupportable, as he was born after the completion of the Ara Pacis, but this idea has persisted for a century. I hope when others see its original presentation, they will realize how weak the proposal really is. I have kept my critiques to the footnotes and are always so marked. I tried to keep faithfully his original text, but consolidated his FN whenever he had two or three for a single sentence. At times I added in more complete FN references and commentary. (New March 2024) I found thee was a typographical error in the German ehlen for fehlen (to fall short) which is why I could not make sense of the sentence' \"Antonia Maior cannot fail to be next to her sister Antonia Minor.'' It is important for those reading this article to remember that Domaszewski did not have access to certain pieces of the Ara Pacis that were still underground and to some information about the imperial family (for example the marriage of Varus to Vipsania was published in 1976). -GCS"
