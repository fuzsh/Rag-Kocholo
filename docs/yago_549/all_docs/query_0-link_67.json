        "text": "Tiberius, the second Emperor of Rome, was born on this day in 42 BC. He was called by Pliny the Elder “the gloomiest of men” and when you read his story you can understand why.\n\nTiberius was the son of Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla. When Augustus rose to power Livia divorced her husband and moved in with Augustus, with her two sons. Tiberius grew up as the son of the two most controlling parents in the history of the world. Between them they controlled all aspects of court life in Rome. Nowhere was this clearer than in the succession.\n\nTiberius was not a Julian except by adoption. As a Nero he found himself low down in the order of succession. But he seemed happy with this situation. He showed no ambition to become Emperor. He moved through the administrative ranks as any good Roman should. He served time in the courts. He trained in military matters. He fell in love with the daughter of Agrippa, Augustus’ friend and the muscle behind the Emperor. Vipsania Agrippina married him and they lived a life unusually blessed in romance as far as Romans were concerned.\n\nThen the interference from his parents went to a new level. On the death of Agrippa in 12 BC Augustus was forced to re-order the succession. He ordered Tiberius to divorce Vipsania and marry his own daughter, the widow of Agrippa, Julia the Elder. Julia had made advances to Tiberius and been refused when he was married, and now she was his wife. But her “triumph” was short lived. She despised Tiberius and shamed him with a string of public affairs. He met Vipsania and followed her home, following which Augustus ensured they would never “accidentally” meet again.\n\nUnlucky in love Tiberius was triumphal on the battlefield, winning great victories over the Germans. After another term as Consul in Rome he tried to retire to the island of Rhodes in 6 BC.\n\nWith the death of the Grandsons of Augustus, Julia’s sons by Agrippa, Tiberius became the only suitable surviving candidate to succeed Augustus. He was fully adopted as the son of Augustus, promoted to co-emperor and given imperium, the power to rule. When Augustus died in 14 AD Tiberius became sole emperor.\n\nThe reluctant emperor began to make plans for retirement almost immediately. He promoted his nephew Germanicus and his son Drusus to important positions and began to take extended breaks from Rome. Germanicus died, followed by Drusus, and Tiberius was forced to soldier on. As he became older he became more gloomy and sullen. He brooded over the death of his son. His attempt to delegate management of Rome to Sejanus was an unmitigated disaster as the Praetorian Prefect became mad with power. He instigated a reign of terror, with proscriptions and sham trials aimed at the extended Julian family. When he tried to usurp Tiberius he was captured, tried and executed.\n\nHistory held Tiberius responsible for the acts of Sejanus, but there was worse to come. Yet again Tiberius found himself responsible for a job he did not want. He retired to the island of Capri and the last years of his rule demonstrated the resilience of the civil service established by Augustus, as the Empire trundled on under its own inertia. The power vacuum was filled with lurid and salacious rumor. Tales of Tiberius engaging in cruel, dark, sadistic and sexual practices in his secret island palace. Those are the stories that endured.\n\n-=o0o=-"
