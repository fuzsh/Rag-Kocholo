        "text": "This coin, RIC I (second edition) Tiberius 45, was minted AD 22 to 23 by Emperor Tiberius during his reign in honour of his son, Drusus Julius Caesar. Drusus’s head is displayed on the obverse as indicated by the legend “DRVSVS CAESAR TI AVG F DIVI AVG N”. It translates as Drusus Caesar, son of Tiberius and grandson of Divus Augustus.[1] The reverse legend allows us to understand the significance of this coin, “PONTIF TRIBVN POTEST ITER” circled around an “SC” translates as Drusus receiving tribunician power, a highly distinctive honour placing him as the emperor’s second in charge and granted only by the order of the Senate.[2] Although this coin honours Drusus achieving a highly commendable position, the intention is for Tiberius to parade his official heir.\n\nDrusus the Younger\n\nDrusus Julius Caesar, born 13 BC, was son to Emperor Tiberius and Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Marcus Agrippa. Drusus was Tiberius’s only legitimate son until AD 4, as an agreement Augustus adopted Tiberius in turn of Tiberius adopting Germanicus, his nephew, securing an additional heir (Suet. Tib. 15). Accordingly, Drusus was “wild and careless” and was likely not the preferred heir for Tiberius, hence the adoption (Suet. Tib. 52). Drusus had a successful military career during his father’s reign, participating in acts of mutinies, wars, and triumphs (Tac. Ann. 1.16-30. 2.44. 2.36. 2.62. 3.19). His time in the military likely boosted his status, his father’s status, and his resume as successor.\n\nDrusus received consulship, the highest position in government elected once a year as partnership, twice during his lifetime, once in AD 15 in partnership with C. Norbanus and second in AD 21 with his father (Tac. Ann. 1.55, 3.31). He married Germanicus’s sister, Livilla and had three children, including twin boys, although only Tiberius Gemelleus survived infancy (Tac. Ann. 2.84 & Suet. Tib. 54). Drusus died in AD 23, what was initially assumed a result of disease then turned into treason, with Sejanus seducing Livilla and together they poisoned him, eliminating him from succession (Tac. Ann. 4.8. & Suet. Tib. 62).\n\nTiberius, the Paranoid Emperor\n\nTiberius Claudius Nero born 42 BC, was fifty-five when he became emperor in AD 14, son of Livia Drusilla and Tiberius Claudius Nero then later, adopted by Augustus in AD 4 (Suet. Aug. 62). He had lived through the end of the Roman Republic, participated in mutinies, and had seen the conniving nature of Augustus and how he eliminated people who disagreed with him.\n\nTiberius lacked favour and popularity and upon his death it was said the public celebrated in relief (Suet. Tib. 75). As emperor he was utterly unlike his predecessor, he remained private and developed an immense paranoia leading him into isolation from the public eye (Tac. Ann. 6.51). Augustus reluctantly claimed Tiberius as his heir and stated either Germanicus or Drusus were to succeed him (Suet. Aug. 100). Unfortunately, during his reign, both sons died, Germanicus in Syria A.D 19 and Drusus in Rome AD 23 thus, opening opportunity for potential heirs (Suet. Tib. 39). His first wife was Agrippina, whom he adored dearly, she bore Drusus and Julia. Tiberius was devastated when he was forced to divorce and marry Augustus’s daughter, Julia in hopes of providing more Julio-Claudian successors (Suet. Tib. 7). Despising his new wife, Tiberius was divorced from her upon her banishment due claims of her untrustworthy adulterous behaviour (Suet. Tib. 11).\n\nDuring his reign as emperor, Sejanus, head of the Praetorian Guard, the imperial security force, had become a trusted acquaintance to Tiberius but, he sought to exploit his weaknesses in efforts to become his heir.[3] Persuaded to vacate to the island of Capri, near Naples, in AD 26 Tiberius left Sejanus to assume his voice in Rome.[4] In his new position, Sejanus proceeded to eliminate his competition, with Drusus Caesar gone, he accused Germanicus’s wife, Agrippina, and her eldest sons of plotting to overthrow Tiberius, playing on the emperor’s paranoia, it lead to exile and imprisonment.[5] In a letter from Antonia, Germanicus’s mother in AD 31, she revealed Sejanus’s plotting which then escalated Tiberius’s paranoia and resulted in the sentencing of Sejanus’s death.[6] Tiberius’s closest connection to Rome had been broken and his trust manipulated, fearing assassination, Tiberius refrained from leaving Capri and continued to rule from afar. He died AD 37 at the age of seventy-eight on Capri, in his will, his two grandsons, Gaius (Caligula) the youngest son of Germanicus too innocent to be involved in Sejanus’s plot and Gemellus son of Drusus became his immediate heirs (Tac. Ann. 6.51 & Suet. Tib. 76).\n\nThe Underlying Significance\n\nThis coin, dated to AD 22-23 commemorated Drusus Caesar with his new honorary title, Pontifex Tribunicia Potestate Iterum. After Germanicus’s death, Drusus became the most suitable heir to succeed Tiberius. Likewise, Augustus had presented his heirs, Tiberius, and Agrippa with the same honorary title (Suet. Tib. 16 & Tac. Ann. 3.56). Thus, this title likely inclines the emperor to suggest his potential successors to his people and celebrate their honours.\n\nAncient coins were used as forms of news, easily transportable, often changed based on events within the year, and allowed people in power to convey achievements, heirs, and messages across the expanse of the Roman Empire.[7] The coin’s legends addresses Drusus's heritage in his namesake and relations, and to those outside of Rome, allocates his place within the imperial lineage. Not only does the coin elevate Drusus, but also his father as current emperor as well as Augustus and Julius Caesar. Coin production on behalf of the emperor was massively important as not only did they encourage national unity, but it was an opportunity for an emperor to give back to his people.[8]\n\nHowever, after the death of Drusus, Tiberius and Rome were left without stable security for the future. Succession and family in a Roman society became a crucially important component of life, Augustus had spent his entire reign erecting laws and constructing stability within his own family. Attempting to create a solid founding succession within the Julio-Claudian dynasty, providing some sort of structural framework his people could rely on, for it all to be turned upside down through death, paranoia and absence.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] OCRE n.d.\n\n[2] OCRE n.d.\n\n[3] Ward et al. 2014, p. 299\n\n[4] Ward et al. 2014, p. 299\n\n[5] Ward, et al. 2014, p. 299\n\n[6] Ward, et al. 2014, p. 299\n\n[7] Grant, 1952, p. 82\n\n[8] Grant, 1952, p. 83-84\n\nBibliography\n\nAncient Sources\n\nSuetonius, Lives of the Caesars.
