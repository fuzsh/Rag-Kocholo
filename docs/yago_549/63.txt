The infant son of Tiberius and Julia the Elder who died in infancy was dubbed ‘Tiberillus’ by modern historians. That wouldn’t actually be his name but we will call him that. Julia had previously had five children with Agrippa, and after his death in 12 BC married Tiberius. The marriage was not happy, as Tiberius was forced to divorce his previous wife whom he loved, and Julia was frequently unfaithful and cheated on him.

I cannot find the exact date in which Tiberillus was born, but it was between 11 BC and 6 BC (when Tiberius left for Rhodes). When Augustus dies, Tiberillus will be in his early twenties, with his father presumably still becoming Emperor and all his half-brothers dead without issue. Obviously, his two half-sisters (notably Agrippina the Elder, who married Germanicus, and was the mother of Caligula and grandmother of Nero), would still be around.

Lucius would die in 2 AD, Gaius in 4 AD. Agrippa Postumus would be exiled in 6 AD and then executed in 14 AD. So there is about a decade after the death of Lucius for Augustus to groom Tiberillus if he wants him to eventually become Emperor. After the death of Augustus, would Germanicus still be the heir to Tiberius or would Tiberillus be?

If Tiberillus survives Sejanus, and all the insanity that went with it, he'd be mid-forties to early fifties when Tiberius dies, So definitely married with kids, and maybe a storied career-military or political. He could change Rome's early Imperial History quite a bit by butterflying the reigns of both Caligula and Claudius. Could be a very interesting TL...
