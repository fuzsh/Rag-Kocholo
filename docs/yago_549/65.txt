Julia the Elder (30 October 39 BC-14 AD) was the daughter of the Roman emperor Augustus and the stepsister and second wife of Tiberius.

Biography[]

Julia was the daughter of Octavian and his wife Scribonia, and she was betrothed to Mark Antony's son Marcus Antonius Antyllus before the engagement was called off due to the start of Antony's Civil War with her father. In 25 BC, at the age of fourteen, she married her cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who was considered as Augustus' likely heir until his death in 23 BC. In 21 BC, she remarried to Augustus' friend and general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who was 25 years older than her; she had five children with him: Gaius Caesar, Julia the Younger, Lucius Caesar, Agrippina the Elder, and Agrippa Postumus. After the death of Agrippa in 12 BC, she remarried to Augustus' stepson Tiberius in 11 BC. She felt that her marriage was unequal, and she denounced her husband to her father in a letter. She separated with her husband in 6 BC, and, in 2 BC, she was arrested for adultery and treason. Reluctant to exile her, Augustus sent her into exile to an island off the coast of Latium, and she was moved to Rhegium on the mainland in 4 AD. While living in a villa at Antium, she began an affair with her son Lucius' friend Gaius Plautius Silanus, whom Empress Livia hired to spy on Julia and discover her infidelities, causing Augustus to banish her from Rome. She died on a small, rocky island in 14 AD, just after Augustus' death.
