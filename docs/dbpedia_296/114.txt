Genesis is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event promoted by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. The name was originally used on May 9, 2003 for a two-hour DirecTV special that highlighted early moments in TNAâ€™s history.

Genesis was actually not amongst the original names used by TNA for its first twelve pay-per-view events, but ultimately was added to the rotation as the thirteenth pay-per-view name during a time of name shuffling on the part of TNA Management. All shows except for one has been held at the Impact! Zone. Originally Genesis was held in November but was changed to January starting in 2009. For this reason 2008 didn't have a Genesis PPV Event. There has only been two World Championship Matches in the Main Event.
