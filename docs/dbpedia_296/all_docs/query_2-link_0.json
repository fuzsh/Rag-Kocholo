        "text": "Professional wrestling pay-per-view event series\n\nGenesisPromotionsTNA WrestlingFirst eventGenesis (2005)Last eventGenesis (2021)\n\nGenesis was an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event promoted by TNA Wrestling. The name was originally used on May 9, 2003, for a two-hour DirecTV special that highlighted early moments in TNA’s history.[1]\n\nGenesis was actually not amongst the original names used by TNA for its first twelve pay-per-view events, but ultimately was added to the rotation as the thirteenth pay-per-view name during a time of name shuffling on the part of TNA Management. All events but three have been held in the Impact Zone. Originally, Genesis was held in November, but was moved to January starting in 2009. For this reason, 2008 did not have a Genesis PPV event. There have only been eight World Championship matches in the main event. Genesis was later televised as an Impact Wrestling television special on Spike TV on January 16, 2015, and on Pop in 2017 and 2018.\n\nOn December 12, 2020 at Final Resolution, it was announced that Genesis would be revived as a monthly special for Impact Plus on January 9, 2021.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe inaugural Genesis event took place on November 13, 2005, at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida.[3] Since the fourth Genesis event, which took place on January 11, 2009, at the Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina, TNA begun to present Genesis on January moving forwards, instead of November as the first three Genesis events.[4] In 2017, after Anthem Sports & Entertainment purchased a majority stake of TNA, Anthem re-branded TNA as Impact Wrestling.[5] The 12th Genesis event, which took place on January 9, 2021, at the Skyway Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, was in front of no crowd attendance, as Impact had to present majority of their events behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[6]\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\n# Event Date City Venue Main Event Ref. 1 Genesis (2005) November 13, 2005 Orlando, Florida TNA Impact!
