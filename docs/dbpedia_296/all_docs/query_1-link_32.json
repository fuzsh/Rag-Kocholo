        "text": "Anthem Sports & Entertainment, the multi-platform media company, has announced that its professional wrestling company, IMPACT Wrestling, is returning to its iconic Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling name, at Hard To Kill, its first pay-per-view event of 2024, which will originate for the first time ever from the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe announcement was made on October 21st at the end of the Bound For Glory pay-per-view, which aired live around the world in front of a standing-room-only crowd in Chicago.\n\nTNA will launch 2024 with Hard To Kill on January 13th 2024, with a second night of action-packed professional wrestling – the Snake Eyes Extravaganza Show – at The Palms on January 14th. The Snake Eyes Extravaganza Show will be taped to air on the company’s flagship weekly TV show, Impact!, airing every Thursday night on AXS TV.\n\n“We still hear the ‘TNA’ chants wherever we go,” said IMPACT Wrestling President Scott D’Amore. “Fans have longed for TNA Wrestling, so that’s what we’re bringing back in 2024: TNA Wrestling, we’re back.”\n\nCompany officials confirmed that the new year will launch a new-look TNA Wrestling that runs from the entrance ramp to turnbuckles in the ring to larger, more prestigious venues and much more. Further details on the TNA Wrestling return will be revealed on October 24th, when D’Amore sits down for an exclusive interview with Tom Hannifan that will air live on IMPACT’s Facebook page, starting at 12noon EST. The Q&A will include questions from worldwide pro wrestling media.\n\nTNA Wrestling launched in the summer of 2002 and has is known for its high-risk, action-packed X Division matches that have run with one simple motto: It’s not about weight limits, it’s about no limits. Stars of the X Division have included Chris Sabin, with a record 10 title reigns; A.J. Styles, the first-ever champion; along with Jay Lethal, Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Petey Williams, Frankie Kazarian and Trey Miguel, among others.\n\nTNA is also the home of the prestigious Knockouts Division, widely regarded as the best women’s division in all professional wrestling. The Knockouts Division features Trinity, Deonna Purrazzo, Mickie James, Jordynne Grace, Gisele Shaw, Masha Slamovich, KiLynn King, Jessicka and Courtney Rush, among others. Legendary past Knockouts include Gail Kim, Awesome Kong, The Beautiful People, Taya Valkyrie, ODB, Tara, Traci Brooks and so many others."
