        "text": "This is a chronological list of live pay-per-view events promoted by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). This list only includes the three-hour, live professional wrestling events held on Sundays that were built up to by TNA, predominantly with its weekly television program Impact Wrestling. TNA first began producing these events in 2004 and held them monthly until January 2013 , when they switched to a schedule with four events per year. Initially, all events were held at the Impact Wrestling Zone, later changed to have several events a year being held elsewhere, The major and most heavily promoted events are TNA Lockdown, TNA Slammiversary, and TNA Bound for Glory. These events are also a major revenue source for the promotion.\n\nFrom its inception, TNA's only television programming was a two-hour weekly show shown on pay-per-view. The first one was held on June 19, 2002 in Huntsville, AL. The last of these shows aired on September 8, 2004. TNA began airing their television program TNA Impact! now called Impact Wrestling (which premiered June 4, 2004) as its primary program. After Impact! began, TNA felt that they had a fanbase that would support monthly, live, three-hour pay-per-view events. On November 7, 2004, TNA aired the first of these events, Victory Road. These events were produced monthly since and the event of each month was given a different name. Several changes and switches were made to the event names throughout the years.\n\nTNA also held some pay-per-view events in co-operative with Japan and Mexico promotions from 2007-2009 and 2011. Those promotions were Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA).\n\nThe monthly event schedule was changed in January 2013, with all but four events cancelled. In their places, TNA began producing TNA One Night Only, taped television specials also offered on pay-per-view.\n\nTotal NonStop Action[]\n\n2002 - 2004[]\n\nTNA Weekly PPVs\n\n2004\n\nNovember 7 - Victory Road\n\nDecember 5 - Turning Point\n\n2005[]\n\nJanuary 16 - Final Resolution\n\nFebruary 13 - Against All Odds\n\nMarch 13 - Destination X\n\nApril 24 - LockDown\n\nMay 15 - Hard Justice\n\nJune 19 - Slammiversary\n\nJuly 17 - No Surrender\n\nAugust 14 - Sacrifice\n\nSeptember 11 - Unvreakable\n\nOctober 23 - Bound for Glory\n\nNovember 13 - Genesis\n\nDecember 11 - Turning Point\n\n2006\n\nJanuary 15 - Final Resolution\n\nFebruary 12 - Against All Odds\n\nMarch 12 - Destination X\n\nApril 23 - LockDown\n\nMay 14 - Sacrifice\n\nJune 18 - Slammiversary\n\nJuly 16 - Victory Road\n\nAugust 13 - Hard Justice\n\nSeptember 24 - No Surrender\n\nOctober 22 - Bound for Glory\n\nNovember 19 - Genesis\n\nDecember 10 - Turning Point\n\n2007\n\nJanuary 14 - Final Resolution\n\nFebruary 11 - Against All Odds\n\nMarch 11 - Destination X\n\nApril 15 - Lockdown\n\nMay 13 - Sacrifice\n\nJune 17 - Slammiversary\n\nJuly 15 - Victory Road\n\nAugust 12 - Hard Justice\n\nSeptember 9 - No Surrender\n\nOctober 14 - Bound for Glory\n\nNovember 11 - Genesis\n\nDecember 2 - Turning Point\n\n2008\n\nJanuary 6 - Final Resolution\n\nFebruary 10 - Against All Odds\n\nMarch 9 - Destination X\n\nApril 13 - Lockdown\n\nMay 11 - Sacrifice\n\nJune 8 - Slammiversary\n\nJuly 13 - Victory Road\n\nAugust 10 - Hard Justice\n\nSeptember 14 - No Surrender\n\nOctober 12 - Bound for Glory\n\nNovember 9 - Turning Point\n\nDecember 7 - Final Resolution\n\n2009\n\nJanuary 11, 2009 - TNA Genesis 2009\n\nFebruary 8, 2009 - TNA Against All Odds 2009\n\nMarch 15, 2009 - TNA Destination X 2008\n\nApril 19, 2009 - TNA Lockdown 2009\n\nMay 24, 2009 - TNA Sacrifice 2009\n\nJune 21, 2009 - TNA Slammiversary 2009\n\nJuly 19, 2009 - TNA Victory Road 2009\n\nAugust 16, 2009 - TNA Hard Justice 2009\n\nSeptember 20, 2009 - TNA No Surrender 2009\n\nOctober 18, 2009 - TNA Bound for Glory 2009\n\nNovember 15, 2009 - TNA Turning Point 2009\n\nDecember 20, 2009 - TNA Final Resolution 2009\n\n2010\n\nJanuary 17, 2010 - TNA Genesis 2010\n\nFebruary 14, 2010 - TNA Against All Odds 2010\n\nMarch 21, 2010 - TNA Destination X 2010\n\nApril 18, 2010 - TNA Lockdown 2010\n\nMay 16, 2010 - TNA Sacrifice 2010\n\nJune 13, 2010 - TNA Slammiversary 2010\n\nJuly 11, 2010 - TNA Victory Road 2010\n\nAugust 8, 2010- TNA Hardcore Justice 2010\n\nSeptember 5, 2010 - TNA No Surrender 2010\n\nOctober 10, 2010 - TNA Bound for Glory 2010\n\nNovember 7, 2010 - TNA Turning Point 2010\n\nDecember 5, 2010 - TNA Final Resolution 2010\n\n2011\n\nJanuary 9, 2011 - TNA Genesis 2011\n\nFebruary 13, 2011 - TNA Against All Odds 2011\n\nMarch 13, 2011 - TNA Victory Road 2011\n\nApril 17, 2011 - TNA Lockdown 2011\n\nMay 15, 2011 - TNA Sacrifice 2011\n\nJune 12, 2011 - TNA Slammiversary 2011\n\nJuly 10, 2011 - TNA Destination X 2011\n\nAugust 7, 2011 - TNA Hardcore Justice 2011\n\nSeptember 11, 2011 - TNA No Surrender 2011\n\nOctober 16, 2011 - TNA Bound for Glory 2011\n\nNovember 13, 2011 - TNA Turning Point 2011\n\nDecember 11, 2011 - TNA Final Resolution 2011\n\n2012\n\nJanuary 8, 2012 - TNA Genesis 2012\n\nFebruary 12, 2012 - TNA Against All Odds 2012\n\nMarch 18, 2012 - TNA Victory Road 2012\n\nApril 15, 2012 - TNA Lockdown 2012\n\nMay 13, 2012 - TNA Sacrifice 2012\n\nJune 10, 2012 - TNA Slammiversary 2012\n\nJuly 8, 2012 - TNA Destination X 2012\n\nAugust 12, 2012 - TNA Hardcore Justice 2012\n\nSeptember 9, 2012 - TNA No Surrender 2012\n\nOctober 14, 2012 - TNA Bound for Glory 2012\n\nNovember 11, 2012 - TNA Turning Point 2012\n\nDecember 9, 2012 - TNA Final Resolution 2012\n\n2013\n\nJanuary 13, 2013 - TNA Genesis 2013\n\nMarch 10, 2013 - TNA Lockdown 2013\n\nJune 2, 2013 - TNA Slammiversary 2013\n\nOctober 20, 2013 - TNA Bound for Glory 2013\n\n2014[]\n\nMarch 9, 2014 - TNA Lockdown 2014\n\nApril 27, 2014 - TNA Sacrifice 2014\n\nJune 15, 2014 - TNA Slammiversary 2014\n\nOctober 12, 2014 - TNA Bound for Glory 2014\n\n2015[]\n\nJune 2015 - TNA Slammiversary 2015\n\nOctober 2015 - TNA Bound for Glory 2015\n\n2016\n\nJanuary 8 - One Night Only Live\n\nFebruary 5 - One Night Only: Rivals\n\nMarch 5 - One Night Only: Joker's Wild\n\nApril 22 - One Night Only: Knockouts Knockdown\n\nMay 20 - One Night Only: Victory Road\n\nJune 12 - Slammiversary\n\nJuly 22 - One Night Only: World Cup\n\nAugust 26 - One Night Only: X-Travaganza\n\nSeptember 16 - One Night Only: September\n\nOctober 2 - Bound for Glory\n\nNovember 4 - One Night Only: Against All Odds\n\nDecember 12 - One Night Only: December\n\n2017[]\n\nJanuary 6 - One Night Only: Live\n\nFebruary 10 - Joker's Wild\n\nMarch 17 - Rivals\n\nContinued On Impact Wrestling Pay Per Views[]\n\nContinued From Impact Wrestling Pay Per Views[]\n\n2024"
