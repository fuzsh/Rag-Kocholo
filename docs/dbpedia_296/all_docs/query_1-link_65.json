        "text": "TNA (Total Nonstop Action) or Impact Wrestling is an American professional wrestling promotion. It was founded in Nashville, Tennessee in 2002 by Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Jarrett. Impact wrestling operates with the help of its parent company, Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC which is a subsidiary of Anthem Sports & Entertainment. It is headquartered at 3201 Dickerson Pike, Nashville, Tennessee, United States.\n\nTNA Wrestling History\n\nEarly Days (2002-2004)\n\nThe idea for TNA wrestling came about after WCW closed, leaving WWE as the dominant force. While on a fishing trip, the Jarretts and Bob Ryder discussed their future, with Ryder suggesting a pay-per-view focused company rather than one reliant on TV. Vince Russo later joined and helped with writing and production. The name \"Total Nonstop Action\" was meant to suggest an edgier product compared to WWE, especially since they wouldn't be on TV. Initially, TNA ran weekly pay-per-view shows instead of monthly ones like other promotions. These shows mainly happened at the \"TNA Asylum\" in Nashville. In 2002, Panda Energy invested heavily in TNA, leading to renaming and Dixie Carter becoming the president. TNA also launched a regular cable show called Xplosion featuring exclusive matches and interviews. Finally, they switched from weekly to monthly pay-per-views in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, TNA made its big shift into television with the launch of its flagship show \"Impact!\". Filmed at Universal Studios Florida's \"Impact Zone\", the show brought TNA to viewers' homes through Fox Sports Net. To stand out from its competitor WWE, Impact! sported several unique features: a six-sided ring, on-screen competitor and timekeeping displays, and a more athletic, sports-focused style compared to WWE's entertainment-heavy approach. This move marked a major turning point for TNA, establishing its distinct identity and paving the way for broader recognition in the world of professional wrestling.\n\nBringing in more names (2004-2008)\n\nIn 2004, TNA transitioned from weekly pay-per-views to a monthly schedule, and after their Fox Sports contract ended in 2005, they navigated a period of relying on webcasts and Urban America Television for airing Impact!. Despite this, they gained momentum with the launch of TNA action figures by Marvel Toys and a legendary 5-star match at Unbreakable. Finally, a major turning point came when TNA secured a television deal with Spike TV in 2005, leading to Impact! debuting on the network and attracting high-profile wrestlers like Kevin Nash, Rhino, Sting, and many others. This Spike TV era (2005-2009) saw TNA gain significant attention and establish itself as a major player in the professional wrestling landscape.\n\nThe Peak of TNA (Late 2000s - Early 2010s)\n\nThroughout the late 2000s, TNA continued to diversify and expand its reach. They embraced the digital age by launching a YouTube channel with exclusive content and podcasts, explored mobile services with TNA Mobile, and even released a video game. Merchandise deals with Tristar Productions ensured fans access to trading cards and memorabilia, and production quality received a significant upgrade with the introduction of HD broadcasting and a new HD set for Impact!. Finally, TNA catered to hardcore fans by launching an online video-vault subscription service, offering access to past pay-per-views. These strategic moves solidified TNA's position as a growing force in the wrestling industry.\n\nTNA made several big changes in 2010 under the leadership of Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff. They returned to a four-sided ring, began airing Impact! on Monday nights opposite WWE Raw, and brought in new talent like Ric Flair, Rob Van Dam, and Mr. Anderson. However, the Monday night experiment was not successful and Impact! returned to Thursday nights in May.\n\nDepartures (2013-2017)\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, TNA experienced a period of significant departures, including major stars like AJ Styles, Sting, and Christopher Daniels. The company also faced challenges with losing their TV deal with Spike TV before securing a temporary extension. This period marked a significant shift in TNA's landscape and foreshadowed the financial troubles they would face in the coming years. The promotion lost its television deal with Spike TV in 2014, a major setback that impacted its finances. This period also saw several departures of key personnel, further compounding the promotion's woes.\n\nDespite these challenges, Impact Wrestling persevered. The promotion secured a new television deal with AXS TV in 2019, providing a much-needed platform to showcase its product. Additionally, the promotion brought in new ownership and talent, injecting fresh energy and ideas into the company.\n\nImpact Wrestling (2017-2023)\n\n2017 brought a whirlwind of change for Impact. Anthem's acquisition led to a branding rollercoaster, bouncing between \"Impact\" and \"Global Force Wrestling\" before wisely returning to the original in 2024. The new ownership wasn't just about names, though. They invested heavily, securing key TV deals and injecting fresh talent, which revitalized the in-ring action. Though overshadowed by WWE and AEW, Impact carved its own niche with high-flying acrobatics, engaging characters, and championing diverse wrestlers.\n\nReturn to TNA (2024-Present)\n\nIn 2024, Impact Wrestling and all its titles were rebranded to TNA.\n\nTNA Wrestling Previous Names\n\nSince it was founded, it underwent a lot of renaming. It was initially known as National Wrestling Alliance: Total Nonstop Action Wrestling or NWA: TNA Wrestling, when it used to be a part of the NWA. In 2004 it was renamed as TNA Wrestling. In 2017 TNA Wrestling was renamed Impact Wrestling. In January 2024, the promotion underwent another overhaul and was rebranded to TNA.\n\nTNA Roster\n\nThe Impact Wrestling roster is made up of wrestlers, on-air personnel such as the ring announcers, commentators and backstage interviewers.

The general manager actually serves as a public booker, arranging matches for their managed wrestlers. Oftentimes the general manager is either a former manager or superstar themselves. Some of the current famous on-screen Impact Wrestling General Managers are Gama Singh, the general manager of the Desi Hit Squad and John E. Bravo, the manager of Taya Valkyrie. There have been several other Impact Wrestling General Managers in the past.\n\nTNA Wrestling Champions\n\nIMPACT Wrestling just like it's other counterparts have their own prestigious Championship titles which form the centre of most of its storylines. The list of Impact Wrestling Championships includes IMPACT World Championship, IMPACT X Division Championship, IMPACT World Tag Team Championship and IMPACT Knockouts Championship. Since IMPACT Wrestling used the trade name NWA-Total Nonstop Action (from 2002-2004) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (from 2004-2017), the TNA Wrestling Current Champions and IMPACT Wrestling Champions are the same.\n\nClick here to know about the current TNA Wrestling Champion.\n\nTNA Wrestling PPV\n\nDuring the TNA Wrestling Era in 2002, Impact Wrestling used to hold weekly pay-per-views. It held a total of 114 pay-per-views before it switched to the monthly pay-per-view concept in 2004. The monthly pay-per-view events continued till January 2013.
