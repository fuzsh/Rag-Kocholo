        "text": "SPIKE TV AND TOTAL NONSTOP ACTION (TNA) WRESTLING RELAUNCH FLAGSHIP PROGRAM AS ‘IMPACT WRESTLING’\n\nTotal Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling and Spike TV announced today that TNA’s flagship program would be rebranded as IMPACT WRESTLING, beginning Thursday, May 19 at 9 p.m. (ET/PT) on SPIKE.\n\nWith the debut of “TNA iMPACT!” in 2005, TNA and SPIKE have partnered to bring U.S. television audiences the most exciting professional wrestling in the world today. TNA iMPACT! has been averaging 1.8 million viewers this year and ranks among the top programs on cable with Men 18-34 and Men 18-49 in its timeslot. In 2011, TNA is up 11% in HH rating vs.Q1 2010 and 9% in viewership of persons 2+.\n\n“While the name change is subtle, it is also very powerful. TNA is proud to be in the wrestling business, and not afraid to say it. And, to emphasize our commitment we have added the word ‘wrestling’ to our already well-known ‘iMPACT!’ brand,” said TNA chief marketing officer Al Ovadia.\n\nIn addition to rebranding IMPACT WRESTLING, TNA is launching the tagline, “WRESTLING MATTERS,” a statement that reflects every aspect of TNA Wrestling, from program content to marketing to live events.\n\n“We wanted a branding initiative that was scalable and could extend across all platforms,” added Ovadia. “We asked our fans what it was about professional wrestling that they found most compelling. We learned it was no single aspect, their passion for wrestling was all-consuming. Whether it’s the in-ring action, backstage brawls, the feuds or classic dramatic conflict of good vs. evil, it’s the entire experience that makes ‘wrestling matter.'”\n\n“TNA is a proven ratings winner on Thursday nights for Spike, delivering a consistently large audience of hard-to-reach young men,” said Brian J. Diamond, senior vice president, sports and specials, Spike TV. “We feel the new IMPACT WRESTLING branding message will resonate with our audience who crave the action-packed wrestling that only TNA can provide.”\n\nEffective immediately fans can visit www.IMPACTWRESTLING.com for exclusive news and content on the stars of IMPACT WRESTLING. Fans can also access over 300 hours of TNA programming at www.TNAOnDemand.com."
