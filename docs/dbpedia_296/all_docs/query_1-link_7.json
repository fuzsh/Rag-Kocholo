        "text": "TNA Latest Results (Impact Wrestling)\n\nTNA (Total Nonstop Action) Wrestling or Impact Wrestling is an American professional promotion from Nashville, Tennessee. The promotion was founded by Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Jarrett in 2002, after the end of the Monday Night Wars between WWE and WCW. The promotion, alongside Ring of Honor, stood as a competitor to WWE when there was no legitimate threat to the Connecticut-based promotion.\n\nIn 2002, the promotion was first introduced as a member promotion of the NWA (National Wrestling Alliance). The company cut its ties with the Alliance in 2007 and has been independent since then. TNA was renamed Impact Wrestling in 2017 before being given the TNA name back in 2024.\n\nAlso Read: Who are the current TNA Champions as of 2024?\n\nTNA Results\n\nTNA Impact!\n\nTNA Impact! is the flagship TV programming of the American promotion. It made its debut in 2004 and since then has been the weekly show of TNA. It currently airs on AXS TV, which is owned by Anthem Sports and Entertainment, the same company that also owns TNA. Impact is 120 minutes long each episode including commercials. It airs every Thursday. Thus, it does not go head to head with either of WWE Monday Night RAW, Friday Night SmackDown, Tuesday Night NXT, AEW Wednesday Night Dynamite, Friday Night Rampage, and Saturday Night Collision.\n\nTNA Xplosion\n\nTNA Xplosion started as a companion show to TNA's main program, IMPACT!, in 2002. It aired a mix of exclusive matches, IMPACT! highlights, and even lighthearted wrestler discussions on pop culture. This format helped TNA expand its reach and introduce viewers to their wrestling style. The show originally ended in 2017. However, with TNA's rebranding in 2024, Xplosion was revived as a web series. Now it focuses on exclusive online matches and building hype for upcoming IMPACT! shows. This format allows TNA to deliver targeted content directly to their online fanbase, keeping them engaged throughout the wrestling season.\n\nTNA PPV events\n\nThe list of all TNA PPV events in 2024.\n\nDateEventVenueLocationMain event13-Jan-2024Hard To KillPalms Casino ResortParadise, NevadaAlex Shelley (c) vs. Moose for the TNA World Championship23-Feb-2024No SurrenderAlario CenterWestwego, LouisianaChris Sabin (c) vs. Mustafa Ali for the TNA X Division Championship 8-Mar-2024Sacrifice St. Clair College Windsor, Ontario, Canada Moose (c) vs. Eric Young for the TNA World Championship 20-Apr-2024RebellionPalms Casino ResortParadise, NevadaMoose (c) vs. Nic Nemeth for the TNA World Championship\n\nWhere to watch TNA Wrestling?\n\nCountryWhat to watchWhere to watch?Bosnia and HerzegovinaTNA Impact!Fight NetworkBulgariaMontegnoroPortugalSerbiaTurkeyCanadaFight Network and Game TVBangladeshTNA+ Monthly Special & Pehelwani PatakhaEurosport IndiaBhutanIndiaMaldivesNepalPakistanSri LankaMexicoTNA Impact!

While on a fishing trip, the Jarretts and Bob Ryder discussed their future, with Ryder suggesting a pay-per-view focused company rather than one reliant on TV. Vince Russo later joined and helped with writing and production. The name \"Total Nonstop Action\" was meant to suggest an edgier product compared to WWE, especially since they wouldn't be on TV. Initially, TNA ran weekly pay-per-view shows instead of monthly ones like other promotions. These shows mainly happened at the \"TNA Asylum\" in Nashville. In 2002, Panda Energy invested heavily in TNA, leading to renaming and Dixie Carter becoming the president. TNA also launched a regular cable show called Xplosion featuring exclusive matches and interviews. Finally, they switched from weekly to monthly pay-per-views in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, TNA made its big shift into television with the launch of its flagship show \"Impact!\". Filmed at Universal Studios Florida's \"Impact Zone\", the show brought TNA to viewers' homes through Fox Sports Net. To stand out from its competitor WWE, Impact! sported several unique features: a six-sided ring, on-screen competitor and timekeeping displays, and a more athletic, sports-focused style compared to WWE's entertainment-heavy approach. This move marked a major turning point for TNA, establishing its distinct identity and paving the way for broader recognition in the world of professional wrestling.\n\nBringing in more names (2004-2008)\n\nIn 2004, TNA transitioned from weekly pay-per-views to a monthly schedule, and after their Fox Sports contract ended in 2005, they navigated a period of relying on webcasts and Urban America Television for airing Impact!. Despite this, they gained momentum with the launch of TNA action figures by Marvel Toys and a legendary 5-star match at Unbreakable. Finally, a major turning point came when TNA secured a television deal with Spike TV in 2005, leading to Impact! debuting on the network and attracting high-profile wrestlers like Kevin Nash, Rhino, Sting, and many others. This Spike TV era (2005-2009) saw TNA gain significant attention and establish itself as a major player in the professional wrestling landscape.\n\nThe Peak of TNA (Late 2000s - Early 2010s)\n\nThroughout the late 2000s, TNA continued to diversify and expand its reach. They embraced the digital age by launching a YouTube channel with exclusive content and podcasts, explored mobile services with TNA Mobile, and even released a video game. Merchandise deals with Tristar Productions ensured fans access to trading cards and memorabilia, and production quality received a significant upgrade with the introduction of HD broadcasting and a new HD set for Impact!. Finally, TNA catered to hardcore fans by launching an online video-vault subscription service, offering access to past pay-per-views. These strategic moves solidified TNA's position as a growing force in the wrestling industry.\n\nTNA made several big changes in 2010 under the leadership of Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff. They returned to a four-sided ring, began airing Impact! on Monday nights opposite WWE Raw, and brought in new talent like Ric Flair, Rob Van Dam, and Mr. Anderson. However, the Monday night experiment was not successful and Impact! returned to Thursday nights in May.\n\nDepartures (2013-2017)\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, TNA experienced a period of significant departures, including major stars like AJ Styles, Sting, and Christopher Daniels. The company also faced challenges with losing their TV deal with Spike TV before securing a temporary extension. This period marked a significant shift in TNA's landscape and foreshadowed the financial troubles they would face in the coming years. The promotion lost its television deal with Spike TV in 2014, a major setback that impacted its finances. This period also saw several departures of key personnel, further compounding the promotion's woes.\n\nDespite these challenges, Impact Wrestling persevered. The promotion secured a new television deal with AXS TV in 2019, providing a much-needed platform to showcase its product. Additionally, the promotion brought in new ownership and talent, injecting fresh energy and ideas into the company.\n\nImpact Wrestling (2017-2023)\n\n2017 brought a whirlwind of change for Impact. Anthem's acquisition led to a branding rollercoaster, bouncing between \"Impact\" and \"Global Force Wrestling\" before wisely returning to the original in 2024. The new ownership wasn't just about names, though. They invested heavily, securing key TV deals and injecting fresh talent, which revitalized the in-ring action. Though overshadowed by WWE and AEW, Impact carved its own niche with high-flying acrobatics, engaging characters, and championing diverse wrestlers.\n\nReturn to TNA (2024-Present)\n\nIn 2024, Impact Wrestling and all its titles were rebranded to TNA."
