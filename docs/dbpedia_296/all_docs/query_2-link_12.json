First, we have come to understand which and how cellular membranes are selected as platforms for particle assembly, and consequently rudimentary movies of virion genesis are available. Second, an understanding of how the ESCRT pathway enables virion budding is accruing, and its various roles in the life of cells have become more fully appreciated. Third, it has become apparent that a host inhibitor can block HIV-1 particle release, and that antagonism of this inhibitor underlies the ability of HIV and SIV accessory genes to facilitate particle release. Here, I review recent progress in these three areas.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 25 years since its discovery, HIV-1 has taught us much about the biology of its host cells. Similarly, an understanding of cell biology has helped illuminate how numerous virological processes such as viral entry and gene expression occur, as well as the mechanisms by which HIV-1 accessory genes manipulate the host-cell to facilitate virus replication(Ho and Bieniasz, 2008). One of the more complex and interesting steps of the HIV life cycle, that is intricately connected to host cell biology, is the generation of new HIV-1 particles by infected cells. Consequently, the study of HIV-1 particle assembly, budding and release has been especially rich in terms of the exchange of concepts and techniques with related areas of cell biology. While there remain some significant gaps in our understanding of how HIV-1 particles are constructed, recent progress in this area has been significant. Here, I review recent developments in three aspects of HIV-1 assembly, each of which involve specific interactions with components of the host cell, and in which there have been significant recent conceptual advances.\n\nThe HIV-1 Gag Protein\n\nThe Gag protein is central to the assembly of HIV-1 and all other retroviruses. In most cases, its expression as the only viral protein, in appropriate cells, is sufficient to generate extracellular virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically indistinguishable from bona fide immature virons. It is even possible to link Gag to fluorescent proteins, which can be placed at internal or C-terminal locations to generate fusion proteins that assemble and are released from cells as efficiently as authentic Gag proteins. Accurate particle morphology often requires coexpression of unfused Gag, but if this precaution is taken, Gag-GFP fusion proteins accurately report the location of Gag during particle morphogenesis(Larson et al., 2005). These properties have proven extremely useful in studies of the cell biology HIV-1 particle morphogenesis, and it is now possible to visualize the movement of Gag and the assembly of virions in real time(Gomez and Hope, 2006; Jouvenet et al., 2008; Larson et al., 2005).\n\nThe functional organization of the HIV-1 Gag protein is fairly typical of that of other retroviruses ( ). An N-terminal MA (matrix) domain, which consists of an N-terminally myristoylated globular head and a largely alpha-helical stalk is responsible for directing Gag to cell membranes. A central CA (capsid) domain homo-oligomerizes in an ordered manner during assembly and is a critical determinant of particle morphology. The NC (nucleocapsid) domain binds RNA, enabling the packaging of the viral genome, and simultaneous interactions between a single RNA molecule and multiple Gag molecules helps to drive Gag multimerization. Finally, a C-terminal domain, termed p6 may be largely unstructured, but contains short peptide docking sites for the ESCRT and ESCRT-associated proteins that are required for the separation of the virion envelope from host cell membranes. Each of these protein domains and their associated activities are required for the efficient generation of immature extracellular viral particles, While expression of the intact HIV-1 Gag molecule is sufficient for the generation of immature particles, the viral protease catalyses a series of cleavage events in Gag, during and/or after budding, that results in a striking series of structural and morphological changes, particularly in CA domain that will form the viral capsid, that are required for the acquisition of infectiousness. The properties of the HIV-1 Gag protein, structural biology of the rearrangements that accompany particle maturation have been recently and comprehensively reviewed elsewhere (Adamson and Freed, 2007; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2007; Morita and Sundquist, 2004).\n\nGag ‘transport’ in cells and selection of sites for particle assembly\n\nIn basic terms, the generation of an HIV-1 Gag VLP or an immature virion consists of the formation of a Gag protein sphere within a lipid bilayer envelope. In cells, the HIV-1 Gag protein sphere, visible by electron microscopy, forms only on the cytoplasmic face of a cell membrane, such that assembly and envelopment of the sphere are simultaneous processes ( ). This is not true of all retroviruses – for some (e.g. Mason Pfizer monkey virus, MPMV) protein spheres assemble in the cytoplasm and then move to membranes where they are enveloped. Thus, two apparently distinct pathways for the early steps of retrovirus particle morphogenesis exist. However, it is relatively straightforward to convert the morphogenesis pathway of MPMV to one that resembles HIV via point mutations in the Gag protein(Rhee and Hunter, 1990). Moreover, HIV-1 Gag can be induced to spontaneously assemble in vitro into protein spheres of the correct size in the presence of simple chemicals and nucleic acid(Campbell et al., 2001). Thus, the ability to multimerize into approximately spherical particles appears intrinsic to Gag proteins in general, and divergence in retrovirus morphogenesis pathways likely reflects only quantitative differences in the requirement for a membrane ‘scaffold’.\n\nGiven that HIV-1 Gag can assemble into complete spheres in the absence of membrane in vitro, yet is only observed to assemble into spheres on membranes in vivo, key questions (that remain unanswered) are (i) the degree to which HIV-1 Gag pre-assembles into oligomeric arrays prior to membrane binding under physiological conditions and (ii) how HIV-1 Gag moves to sites on membranes where particle assembly becomes observable ( ). These questions are potentially related, because the multimeric state adopted by Gag in the cytoplasm could present different cell biological problems in terms of its intracellular transport. Gag monomers could likely diffuse freely through the cytoplasm to sites of assembly on cell membranes, while partly pre-assembled capsids or Gag oligomers might require active transport to membranes for envelopment, particularly if they are associated with viral RNA. In principle, it is possible that HIV-1 Gag remains entirely monomeric or, alternatively, forms low-order multimers prior to engagement of a cell membrane. In solution in-vitro, Gag can exist in a monomer-dimer or monomer-trimer equilibrium, depending on conditions(Datta et al., 2007), but this parameter is obviously difficult to measure in the cytoplasm of cells. Other observations which suggest that some degree of Gag oligomerization occurs in the cytoplasm, prior to, membrane binding include the findings that membrane binding defective Gag proteins can be incorporated into virions(Yuan et al., 1993) and that HIV-1 Gag deletion mutants that cannot multimerize are poor membrane binding proteins in cells(Sandefur et al., 1998). Moreover, the efficiency with which Gag associates with cell membranes is dependent on its intracellular concentration(Perez-Caballero et al., 2004). However, none of these findings refute the possibility that Gag monomers are added to a growing membrane associated protein shell, one monomer at a time. Under either scenario, Gag multimerization would favor stable membrane association ( ).\n\nFluorescence recovery after photobleaching and photoactivation studies indicate that a population of Gag molecules that are diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, and is reasonably assumed to represent Gag molecules that are yet to assemble into complete particles, is mobile and can move throughout the cytoplasm within minutes(Gomez and Hope, 2006). However, at present it is not clear whether this diffuse pool represents Gag monomers or oligomers and whether its rapid movement represents diffusion, or requires active transport. Several retroviral Gag protein have been reported to bind to the microtubule-associated motor protein, KIF4, and KIF4 has been reported to be required for HIV-1 assembly(Martinez et al., 2008). Noneless, it is also true that pharmacological ablation of microtubules or the actin cytoskeleton has little or no effect on the accumulation of HIV-1 Gag at the plasma membrane, or the yield of virion particles, suggesting that active transport of Gag is not required for particle assembly(Jouvenet et al., 2006). Other studies suggest that specific host proteins invovled in intracellular transport, for example the GGA and Arf proteins are also required for Gag movement to the plasma membrane (Joshi et al., 2008). Overall, the behavior of Gag, and requirements for interactions with host machinery in the cytoplasm of cells prior to its engagement of membranes and incorporation into assembling particles, remains incompletely defined.\n\nThe identity of the cell membrane that serves provides sites for the completion of HIV-1 particle assembly has been somewhat controversial in recent years. The canonical view that the plasma membrane served as the site for retroviral assembly was challenged by several studies that demonstrated considerable amounts of HIV-1 Gag protein and/or mature virion particles in late endosomes(Nydegger et al., 2003; Pelchen-Matthews et al., 2003; Sherer et al., 2003). This model suggested that Gag was initially targeted to late endosomal membranes, that virions were formed by budding into the endosomal lumen and that extracellular particles were liberated via an endosome based secretory pathway. An attraction of the notion that HIV-1 particle assembly occurs at endosomes arose from the fact that virion budding requires the ESCRT proteins, which normally mediate the budding of vesicles into the late endosomal lumen (Bieniasz, 2006; Morita and Sundquist, 2004). Indeed, the Hrs protein, which targets endosomal membranes domain to nucleate the recruitment of ESCRT proteins, is effectively mimicked by HIV-1 Gag, as both encode PTAP motifs that recruit ESCRT-I to enable budding events(Pornillos et al., 2003). Apparent HIV-1 assembly in endosomes appeared especially prominent in macrophages, in which very large numbers of virion particles are found within compartments containing late endosomal markers(Pelchen-Matthews et al., 2003). Although intracellular particle assembly was initially thought to be a unique feature of macrophages, similar studies reporting localization of HIV-1 Gag and virions in endosomal compartments in fibroblast, epithelial, and T-lymphocyte cell lines, extended this notion, leading to the proposal that HIV-1 assembly is initiated on endosomal membranes in all cell types (Nydegger et al., 2003; Sherer et al., 2003).\n\nSeveral more recent studies strongly suggest that HIV-1 assembly occurs at the plasma membrane. First, newly synthesized Gag appears first at the plasma membrane and only later in endosomes(Finzi et al., 2007; Harila et al., 2006; Jouvenet et al., 2006; Neil et al., 2006; Rudner et al., 2005). Second, the appearance of Gag in endosomes can be inhibited by inhibiting endocytosis, without affecting the yield of extracellular particles. Third, pharmacological manipulations that block endosome movement (such as disruption of cytoskeleton or Rab protein recruitment to late endosomes) do not affect Gag appearance at the plasma membrane or particle release. Fourth, rational targeting of Gag, by replacement of the MA globular head with specific membrane targeting protein domains, results in extracellular particle formation when Gag targeted to the plasma membrane. Conversely, when Gag is deliberately targeted to endosomal membranes, particles form in the late endosomal lumen, but do not leave the cell (Jouvenet et al., 2006). Overall, these data strongly suggest that HIV-1 assembly occurs at the plasma membrane, and that the appearance of Gag and or viral particles in endosomes can occur as a result of endocytosis, following a failure to complete budding or adherence of the completed virion particle to the infected cell surface.\n\nRecently developed approaches that allow direct observations of HIV-1 Gag protein and particle assembly in real time have confirmed that HIV-1 assembly occurs primarily at the plasma membrane. Improvements in microscopic techniques, and the application of Gag-fluorescent fusion proteins that accurately recapitulate the assembly process have made this possible. Indeed elegant correlative fluorescence/electron microscopy studies employing Gag-GFP proteins have allowed the demonstration that fluorescent puncta at the plasma membrane represent bona fide, individual VLPs that are released into the extracellular milieu(Larson et al., 2005). Additionally, total internal reflection microscopy is ideally suited for imaging assembly events and recent imaging studies using this technique have permitted direct observation and quantitative analysis of the assembly of individual HIV-1 particles in real time in living cells(Jouvenet et al., 2008). For example, it has been possible to determine that an individual HIV-1 VLP assembles over ~5 minutes under optimal conditions. Moreover, optical techniques have been developed that document the irreversible completion of virion assembly, and the ESCRT-protein mediated scission of the nascent virions from cells(Jouvenet et al., 2008). In principle, elaborations of single particle analysis might allow imaging of the recruitment of other virion components, such and genomes, and as such allow a more complete picture of the temporal sequence of events that occur during HIV-1 virion formation.\n\nMacrophages were often thought to represent a special environment for HIV-1 assembly, because intracellular virons were particularly prominent therein(Pelchen-Matthews et al., 2003). Nonetheless, in this cell type too, productive HIV-1 assembly occurs at the plasma membrane(Jouvenet et al., 2006). However, large areas of the macrophage plasma membrane are sequestered within the cell forming an intracellular pseudo-compartment, which upon sectioning and electron-microscopic analysis has the appearance of a bona fide intracellular compartment. Importantly, this ‘compartment’ is accessible to externally applied membrane impermeant stains, and is bounded by plasma membrane that is continuous with the conventional plasma membrane. These deeply invaginated pseudo-compartments often contain virions that are either completely assembled or in the process of assembly(Deneka et al., 2007; Welsch et al., 2007). Because virions assembled the plasma membrane-bounded intracellular pseudo-compartments would inherently tend to become trapped and accumulate therein, virions inevitably appear enriched at intracellular sites as compared to the conventional plasma membrane upon electron microscopic analysis. These intracellular pseudo compartments may represent favored sites for HIV-1 assembly, but it is not currently clear whether they are static or dynamic, or whether they represent exocytic, endocytic or phagocytic intermediates.\n\nBecause the plasma membrane represents only a tiny fraction of the total membrane content of the cell, a conceptual problem was to explain how this membrane is selected for HIV-1 assembly. Recent findings have defined an underlying mechanism. Specifically, it appears that a plasma membrane resident phosphoinositide, namely PI(4,5)P2, is specifically recognized by the globular head of the MA domain of Gag(Saad et al., 2006). Concordantly, overexpression of 5 phosphatase IV, which depletes cellular PI(4,5)P2 redirects HIV-1 assembly away from the plasma membrane to internal membranes(Ono et al., 2004), and Gag binds preferentially to liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2(Chukkapalli et al., 2008). Notably, an NMR structure of the HIV-1 MA domain in complex with an analog of PI(4,5)P2 reveals that the PI(4,5)P2 adopts a highly unusual extended conformation, whereby one of the acyl-chains is flipped out from the plane of the membrane so that it and the phospoinositide head group bind to a cleft in the matrix globular head(Saad et al., 2006). Meanwhile, the remaining acyl chain remains embedded in the plasma membrane. Importantly, while the N-terminal myristoyl moiety of HIV-1 Gag is sequestered in a hydrophobic pocket when Gag is monomeric and in solution, the interaction between MA and PI(4,5)P2 induces a conformational change in MA favoring myristate exposure. Thus, the HIV-1 MA domain effectively has a tripartite membrane interaction domain, consisting of the N-terminal myristate, a cluster of basic amino acids and a hydrophobic groove that binds the flipped out PI(4,5)P2 acyl chain. Because myristate exposure, and increased membrane binding affinity, are also favored by Gag multimerization(Tang et al., 2004), then a series of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions likely cooperate to correctly target and stabilize Gag interaction specifically with the plasma membrane during particle assembly.\n\nOverall, the recent findings are consistent with a model in which Gag monomers and/or low order multimers diffuse or are transported throughout the cell cytoplasm until they encounter either or both PI(4,5)P2 and a growing Gag protein shell at the plasma membrane. Thereafter, the intrinsitic sphere-forming properties of the Gag protein drive the assembly of the nascent virion particle.\n\nHIV-1 budding-recent insights into mechanism\n\nThe intrinsic propensity of Gag to assemble into spheres on PI(4,5)P2 containing membrane surfaces is sufficient to intitate, but insufficient to complete, the assembly process. Indeed, for some years it has been clear that HIV-1 and other retroviruses encode late-budding or ‘L’-domains that bind directly or indirectly to components of the ESCRT pathway in order to complete assembly and separate the nascent virion envelope from cell membranes(Bieniasz, 2006; Morita and Sundquist, 2004) ( ). Failure to recruit the ESCRT pathway to sites of viral assembly results in the formation of nearly complete immature particles whose envelope remains continuous with the host cell plasma membrane, in a lollipop-like configuration. In the case of HIV-1, the L-domains are encoded within the p6 domain of Gag and consist of peptide sequences PTAP and YPLTSL, which bind Tsg101 (a component of ESCRT-I) and ALIX (an ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III binding protein), respectively(Bieniasz, 2006; Morita and Sundquist, 2004). The ESCRT proteins have been an active area of research in recent years - many aspects of protein structure and function have been elucidated, and recently reviewed in detail by others(Hurley and Emr, 2006; Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). Essentially, the originally described functions of the ESCRT pathway were (1) to select transmembrane protein cargos (generally those tagged by ubiquitination) and sort them into specified areas of endosomal membranes, (2) induce membrane invagination away from the cytoplasm and toward the endosomal lumen and (3) fuse the neck of the induced membrane invagination to generate a vesicle within the endosomal lumen. Recruitment of the ESCRT pathway to endosomal membranes in mammalian cells is mediated largely by the Hrs/STAM complex which can, loosely, be viewed as a cellular orthologue of HIV-1 Gag in that it has a specific membrane binding domain and recruits ESCRT-I, in part through a PTAP motif that binds to Tsg101(Pornillos et al., 2003).\n\nThe ESCRT pathway is the only known cellular machinery that is capable of severing a membranous neck when the cytoplasm, and therefore the machinery itself, only has access to the interior of the neck. A key current challenge in this area is the elucidation of how a cellular machinery that is configured in this way is capable of mediating membrane fission, and thereby causing the release of a budding HIV-1 particle. However, clues from studies of the normal cellular function of the ESCRT pathway, and some in vitro studies have provided significant insight. Aside from the generation of endosomal vesicles, there are few cell functions that require such membrane fission reactions, and recently the ESCRT pathway has been implicated directly or indirectly in each of these. Specifically, Cep55, a mammalian protein that localizes to the midbody during cell division, and is known to be required for the completion of abscission, has been shown to recruit Tsg101, ALIX and, ultimately, other ESCRT proteins to the midbody where they are required for the completion of cell division (Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007; Morita et al., 2007). Thus, HIV-1 Gag, Hrs and Cep55 all share the ability to directly recruit ESCRT proteins, and thereby induce the fission of cytoplasm-filled membranous stalks ( ).\n\nAlthough the ESCRT pathway is quite elaborate and serves multiple functions in modern eukaryotes, A surprising recent finding is that a rudimentary ESCRT pathway, comprising four ESCRT-III homologs and a VPS4 ATPase is present in some Archea, including the genus Sulfolobus (Samson et al., 2008). These ESCRT-III-like proteins localize to sites of membrane ingression and appear to be required for cell division in Sulfolobus. Given these findings, and because Archea lack an endomembrane system, it is likely that facilitating cell division is the ancestral function of the ESCRT pathway. In eukaryotes, the ESCRT pathway has evidently elaborated and acquired additional components, presumably to take on new functions. It is these elaborations of the ESCRT pathway, including the ESCRT-I complex and ALIX, that HIV-1 and other viruses have learned to recruit, in order to parasitize the membrane fission activity of the ESCRT pathway, but the elaborations do not appear to be universally required for viral budding. Rather, they appear to be exploited by viruses like HIV-1 simply to access the core fission machinery (Bieniasz, 2006; Morita and Sundquist, 2004) ( ).\n\nBecause ESCRT-III and VPS4 appear to constitute the minimal form of the ESCRT pathway, then together they should constitute this required minimal membrane fission machinery. This prediction appears to be quite accurate, and several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated properties of the ESCRT-III complex and its components that lead to plausible models of how ESCRT-III proteins and VPS4 might induce membrane fission. For example, overexpression of the ESCRT-III component CHMP4/Snf7 in mammalian cells leads to the formation of curved filaments on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, in an approximately circular array(Hanson et al., 2008). Moreover, CHMP4/Snf7 coexpression with dominant negative VPS4 results in membranous protrusions from the cell surface, with circular arrays of CHMP4 and associated VPS4 accumulated at the base of the protrusions(Hanson et al., 2008). Additionally, in vitro experiments employing CHMP2/VPS2 and CHMP3/VPS24 show that truncated, and thereby putatively activated, forms of these proteins can assemble into helical tubes, with basic membrane binding surfaces of the on the exterior and VPS4 binding domains on the interior of the tube(Lata et al., 2008b). Accordingly, assembly of the helical tubes in the presence of VPS4 results in the localization of VPS4 in the tube interior, and addition of ATP results in tube disassembly. These aforementioned studies suggest a model in which ESCRT-III proteins assemble into circular filaments and/or helical bands within or proximal to the membranous neck that is to be severed. Thereafter, VPS4 ESCRT-III subunits could sequentially remove individual subunits of the filaments and or bands, thereby constricting the neck until it ultimately fuses with itself ( ).\n\nHowever, a detailed analysis of the ESCRT-III complex in yeast provides additional insights, and invokes different and discrete roles for the various subunits in ESCRT-III function(Saksena et al., 2009; Teis et al., 2008). The yeast ESCRT-III assembled on endosomal membranes has a measured mass of approximately 450 kDa and appears biochemical and genetic studies suggest that it is assembled in a specific and particular order(Saksena et al., 2009; Teis et al., 2008). Specifically, a single CHMP6/VPS20 subunit nucleates the recruitment of CHMP4/Snf7 subunits, that oligomerize to form a filament that eventually reaches 10-15 molecules in length. The filament is capped by CHMP3/VPS24, which then recruits CHMP2/VPS2, which in turn recruits VPS4. In this model, the subsequent and sequential removal of CHMP4/Snf7 subunits, catalysed by VPS4 would again progressively constrict a ring-like filament, ultimately driving fission of the membranous neck ( ).\n\nA third model for membrane fission is invoked by recent study which has shown that the addition of pure recombinant yeast ESCRT-III proteins to so called giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) is sufficient to generate vesicles within GUVs(Wollert et al., 2009). These vesicles become separated from the GUV limiting membrane, contain medium that was outside the GUV at the beginning of the experiment and, therefore, can be regarded as analogous to extracellular enveloped viral particles, or the intralumenal vesicle of MVBs. Notably, CHMP6/VPS20, CHMP4/Snf7 and CHMP3/VPS2 were each required for optimal formation of vesicles within GUVs, but CHMP2/VPS2 and VPS4 were dispensable. Rather, CHMP2/VPS2 and VPS4 appeared to be required for removal of the ESCRT proteins from the GUV limiting membrane, only after fission, thereby permitting a second round of intralumenal vesicle generation. A model that arises from this study invokes a CHMP protein filament that inwardly spirals as it elongates, as the driver of membrane fission (Wollert et al., 2009)( ).\n\nAlthough these models are somewhat speculative, and contradictory in some of their aspects, a key concept that is shared among them is that the CHMP proteins exist in solution in an autoinhibited conformation, and that recruitment of a CHMP monomer to a growing array or filament on a membrane surface is accompanied conformational ‘activation’, revealing binding sites for the next CHMP protein monomer to be recruited(Lata et al., 2008a; Zamborlini et al., 2006). Thus it is possible that monomeric CHMP proteins exist in a metastable conformation and provide the energy for membrane fission simply as a result of their binding to membrane and other CHMP proteins at the site of membrane fission. In such a scenario, VPS4 could be required to effectively ‘reload’ the CHMP proteins, reestablishing their metastable conformation, or to remove CHMP proteins to bring membranes together. Clearly further experimentation will be required to firmly establish which, if any, of the models that have been proposed ( ) approximate to the actual events that induce membrane fission. These studies are key to understanding how not only HIV-1 and other viral particles are released from cells but also how cell division and multivesicular body formation are completed and are among the most striking examples of how viruses parasitize host machinery to facilitate their replication.\n\nTetherin, a host inhibitor of virus particle release its antagonism by HIV-1 accessory proteins\n\nFollowing the ESCRT-protein mediated scission of virion and cell membranes it would appear inevitable that an HIV-1 virion, or any enveloped virion particle, would be free to diffuse into the extracellular milieu and disseminate to infect other cells. However, recent findings have shown that the host cell can intervene at this step and block the release of virion particles. These findings are based on the earlier studies which revealed that HIV-1 constructs in which the Vpu gene was ablated were poorly able to generate extracellular particles when introduced into certain, so-called “non-permissive”, cell types(Klimkait et al., 1990; Terwilliger et al., 1989). The HIV-1 Vpu protein consists of two major elements: an N-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors Vpu in cellular membranes and a cytoplasmic tail consisting of two putative α-helices separated by a conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site. The transmembrane domain was known to be critical for enhancing particle release from non-permissive cells, while the cytoplamic tail was thought to be less important(Schubert et al., 1996). Notably, heterokaryon studies suggested that Vpu acts by antagonizing a host restriction activity that impedes HIV particle release(Varthakavi et al., 2003).\n\nWhile the nature of the inhibitory activity remained undefined for several years, electron microscopy studies showed that HIV-1 particles generated in the absence of Vpu accumulated in a mature form at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments of non-permissive cells(Gottlinger et al., 1993; Klimkait et al., 1990; Terwilliger et al., 1989). The appearance of HIV-1 Vpu-defective particles in internal membrane-bound compartments was suggestive of a Gag membrane targeting defect, or a defect in the endosome based secretory pathway that had been proposed to be the mechanism by which assembled or assembling HIV-1 particles gained access to the extracelluler milieu(Nydegger et al., 2003; Sherer et al., 2003). However, later studies showed that the intracellular virions that accumulated in the absence of Vpu arose primarily as a consequence of their internalization from the plasma membrane(Harila et al., 2006; Neil et al., 2006). Thus, the primary defect induced by the absence of Vpu in non-permissive cells occurred at the cell surface, rather than at intracellular locations.\n\nImportantly, the defect in particle release that occurred as a consequence of Vpu deficiency in non-permissive cells was distinct from that associated with late-domain mutations that cause a failure to recruit the ESCRT machinery(Gottlinger et al., 1993; Klimkait et al., 1990; Neil et al., 2006; Terwilliger et al., 1989). In the case of L-domain mutations, continuity between viral and cellular membrane is maintained, and incompletely formed, immature virions accumulate at the plasma membrane. Conversely, in the absence of Vpu, virions are fully formed and mature, and in contrast to virions retained as a consequence of L-domain defects, could be liberated from the cell by protease (Neil et al., 2006). Thus, the absence of Vpu caused a very late block in the release of HIV-1 particles, after the completion of viral particle assembly. The putative inhibitor appeared to consist of protein based tethers that retained compete virions on the surface of cells from where they might be internalized.\n\nImportantly, the finding that cells that were otherwise permissive for the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1 virions could be rendered nonpermissive by treatment with interferon-alpha, suggested that the activity was a component of the interferon-induced innate immune response(Neil et al., 2007). Recently, a protein that exhibits most or all of the properties expected of the putative inhibitor has been identified, and dubbed ‘tetherin’(Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al., 2008). Tetherin is an interferon induced integral membrane protein (previously called BST-2, CD317 or HM1.24) that has a unique topology; it is composed of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, linked to a transmembrane anchor and an extracellular domain that is predicted to form a coiled-coil. Tetherin also possesses a putative glycophosphatidyl-inositol lipid anchor at its C-terminus and is therefore highly unusual among membrane associated proteins in harboring two completely different types of membrane anchor. Crucially, ectopic expression of tetherin in cells that would otherwise be tetherin-negative is sufficient to induce protease-sensitive tethering of Vpu defective HIV-1 particles on the surface of infected cells. A proportion of the tethered virions are internalized via a Rab5 dependent pathway, and accumulate in late endosomal compartments(Neil et al., 2006; Neil et al., 2008). Prototype ‘non-permissive cells’ (e.g. HeLa) constitutively express tetherin, and tetherin depletion from HeLa cells markedly increases the yield of extracellular particles generated Vpu-defective proviral constructs(Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al., 2008). As was earlier predicted, virions whose release was blocked as a consequence of tetherin expression are fully formed and mature, and have lipid bilayers that are discontinuous with cell membranes(Neil et al., 2008).\n\nAlthough the precise mechanism by which tetherin acts is yet to be elucidated, the fact that it consists of a coiled-coil with a membrane anchor at either end suggest the possibility that it simply cross-links cell membranes and virion envelopes ( ). Tetherin is also known to form dimers, but it is not known whether this property is essential for virion retention. Consistent with the idea that tetherin is a direct, physical component of the protein based tethers that retain virions, it colocalizes with virions on the surface of infected cells, and within endosomes following virion internalization(Jouvenet et al., 2009; Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al., 2008). Clearly, Vpu acts as a viral antagonist of tetherin. Indeed, tetherin dramatically inhibits the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1 virions, but has only modest effects on wild-type Vpu-expressing HIV-1. Moreover, Vpu colocalizes with tetherin in intracellular compartments, including the trans-golgi network and in so doing prevents the colocalization of tetherin with nascent virions(Dube et al., 2009; Jouvenet et al., 2009; Neil et al., 2008). Vpu also causes downregulation of tetherin from the cell surface, and reduces the total level of tetherin in cells, at least under conditions of transient overexpression(Bartee et al., 2006; Van Damme et al., 2008). Vpu-induced reduction in tetherin steady state levels is reversed by proteasome inhibitors(Goffinet et al., 2009), but since proteasome inhibition can deplete ubiquitin and thereby affect the trafficking of some cargoes through the endosomal system it is not completely clear whether the proteasome is directly responsible for tetherin degradation. Moreover, one recent study has claimed that tetherin downregulation from the cell surface is does not occur in some T-cell lines in which Vpu is capable of stimulating particle release(Miyagi et al., 2009). Thus, the role of tetherin downregulation in Vpu activity is uncertain at present, and defining precisely how Vpu antagonizes tetherin remains a pressing question in this area.\n\nNotably, early studies suggested that release of diverse retroviruses, and well as filoviruses from non-permissive cells could be enhanced by Vpu coexpression(Gottlinger et al., 1993; Neil et al., 2007), leading to the prediction that tetherin has a rather broad antiviral specificity. This prediction has proved to be accurate, as tetherin has been recently shown to block the release of numerous retroviruses, filoviruses and arenaviruses(Jouvenet et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009). Moreover, other viruses have clearly evolved to antagonize tetherin activity - the KSHV K5 protein is capable of inducing tetherin degradation(Bartee et al., 2006), and the Ebola virus glycoprotein associates with tetherin and antagonizes its antiviral function(Kaletsky et al., 2009). Recent findings have also demonstrated the simian immunodeficiency virues which, for the most part, do not encode Vpu proteins can use Nef proteins to antagonize tetherin (Jia et al., 2009; Zhang et al., In press).\n\nAs is the case with other restriction factors that inhibit retrovirus replication, tetherin has been evolving under positive selection in primates(McNatt et al., 2009). In fact, tetherin proteins from macaques and African green monkeys are capable of inhibiting HIV-1 particle release, but are insensitive to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu. Conversely, human tetherin is comparatively insensitive to antagonism by several SIV Nef proteins(Jia et al., 2009; Zhang et al., In press). The transmembrane domain of tetherin defines this species-specific difference in sensitivity to HIV-1 Vpu and the introduction of two mutations in the human tetherin protein transmembrane domain that correspond to sequences found in macaque tetherin are entirely sufficient to generate a tetherin protein that is completely resistant to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu(McNatt et al., 2009). Similarly, a 5 amino acid deletion in the cytoplasmic tail of human tetherin is responsible for its resistance to SIV Nef proteins(Jia et al., 2009; Zhang et al., In press). Strikingly, residues that contribute to determining the sensitivity of tetherin to HIV-1 Vpu and SIV Nef coincide with those that have been evolving under positive selection. Thus, it is likely that past selection pressures imposed by viral antagonists of tetherin, perhaps including Vpu-like proteins, have determined the range of species in which modern HIV-1 and SIV Vpu and Nef proteins are able to function.\n\nRemarkably, a second candidate for a molecule that imposes a requirement for Vpu in the release of HIV-1 particles, termed CAML, has been reported(Varthakavi et al., 2008). Like tetherin, expression of CAML in otherwise permissive cells was reported to render them non-permissive, and RNAi-mediated CAML depletion was reported to have the reciprocal effect. These observations are somewhat perplexing, as it is difficult to envision how two different molecules can be both necessary and sufficient to define the difference between permissive and nonpermissive cells. While it is possible that CAML and tetherin might both contribute to the retention of virions by non permissive cells, further experimentation is needed to clarify the role of each protein in imposing the requirement for Vpu in HIV-1 particle release.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe recent studies reviewed above have significantly enhanced our understanding of some of the cell biological aspects of HIV-1 assembly and release. However, there are a number of significant questions that arise from these findings, as well as additional questions that have proved to be somewhat intractable, thusfar. For example, various specific pre-existing domains in the plasma membrane, such as lipid rafts, tetraspanin enriched domains, or sites of cell-to-cell contact have been reported to be favored target sites for HIV-1 assembly (Hubner et al., 2009; Jolly and Sattentau, 2005; Nguyen and Hildreth, 2000; Nydegger et al., 2006; Ono and Freed, 2001) and what role the PI(4,5)P2-binding properties of Gag, or putative active Gag transport plays in this apparent selectivity is unclear. Moreover, ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases appear capable of stimulating HIV-1 particle budding, but it is not clear how(Chung et al., 2008; Usami et al., 2008). Finally, we do not fully understand how other viral components are incorporated into virions: Where does viral RNA first interact with Gag and how does viral RNA move within the cell and find its way to sites of particle assembly? How are envelope proteins specifically incorporated into virions while at the same time pseudotyping be so promiscuous(Jorgenson et al., 2009)?\n\nOverall, it is notable how a superficially simple process - the assembly of a few proteins, RNA and lipids into a particle that is released from cells - can, upon closer examination, turn out to be remarkably complex and interesting from a cell biological perspective. While important details of HIV-1 particle genesis have been revealed by recent work, achieving a nearly complete understanding of the cell biology of HIV-1 particle assembly, budding and release will surely occupy scientists for the foreseeable future.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWork in the author’s laboratory is supported the NIH (R01AI50111 and R01AI52774) and by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
