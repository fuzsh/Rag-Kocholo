        "text": "TNA is back!\n\nAs announced at the end of IMPACT Wrestling’s Bound For Glory pay-per-view, the promotion is going back to the name that the fans have known it for since 2002.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the main event, a video played that saw various stars from the promotion meeting up in the woods. A box is retrieved from a lake and opened, revealing a a video package of TNA highlights and announcing that TNA will be back in 2024, beginning at the Hard To Kill Pay-per-view on January 13th.\n\nA press release regarding the rebranding is as follows:\n\nTORONTO | CHICAGO – October 21, 2023 – Anthem Sports & Entertainment, a global, multi-platform media company, announced today that its professional wrestling company, IMPACT Wrestling, is returning to its iconic Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling name, at “Hard To Kill,” its first pay-per-view event of 2024, which will originate for the first time ever from the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe announcement was made Saturday night at the end of the “Bound For Glory” pay-per-view, which aired live around the world in front of a standing-room-only crowd in Chicago.\n\nTNA will launch 2024 with Hard To Kill on Saturday, January 13, with a second night of action-packed professional wrestling – the “Snake Eyes Extravaganza Show” – at The Palms on Sunday, January 14. The Snake Eyes Extravaganza Show will be taped to air on the company’s flagship weekly TV show, Impact!, airing every Thursday night on AXS TV (8 p.m. EST).\n\n“We still hear the ‘TNA’ chants wherever we go,” said IMPACT Wrestling President Scott D’Amore. “Fans have longed for TNA Wrestling, so that’s what we’re bringing back in 2024: TNA Wrestling, we’re back!”\n\nAdditional information has been provided courtesy of PWInsider. It is stated that the name change came about to reunite the fragmented history of the promotion, as many fans have still called it TNA despite changing names multiple times since its inception in 2002.\n\nFurthermore, multiple international partners were still using the TNA name internally and preferred it along with the fans who have constantly chanted “TNA” over the years.\n\nHowever, for anyone expecting to see a complete return to the TNA of old, there are currently “zero” plans to bring back the six-sided ring.\n\nFeatured image: IMPACT"
