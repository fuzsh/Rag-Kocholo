        "text": "The power of nostalgia should never be overlooked.\n\nYes, yes it should make fans of a certain vintage sick that TNA is now considered retro, but the response to IMPACT Wrestling's recent \"WE'RE BACK\" announcement was greeted with tears of nostalgic joy from all-comers. Something feels right about those three little letters, and that's just the way it is.\n\nTNA will officially return in January 2024, so attention now turns to what Scott D'Amore and the management team at Anthem can do to make that relaunch truly special. Beyond the inevitable early flurry, the folks in charge will have to make sure that TNA doesn't fizzle out by stepping up their game when it comes to live event promotion and production too.\n\nKey signings (no matter how far-fetched) could help there, and so could continuing to blend the retro buzz with more of the solid groundwork IMPACT has quietly been doing over the past few years. The days of \"LOL TNA\" should be over - this company has a product and roster worth your time.\n\nIs all of this what the future holds come next year?!\n\nThis makes perfect sense.\n\nBringing back the Genesis pay-per-view series, which hasn't been seen since 2021, would be a nifty move from D'Amore and staff. Currently, Hard To Kill on 13 January is being touted as the relaunch for TNA. Being fair, that name is also fitting for the brand's comeback, because most figured IMPACT would've vanished long before now.\n\nThe company literally is hard to kill then. Either name works, but there's something grander about the Genesis title. It'd take older fans back to the peak era of TNA, and it'd remind them of classic bouts like Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe (2006), or a sh*t hot tag effort pitting the Motor City Machine Guns vs. Team 3D (2007).\n\nBesides, the word genesis means \"the origin or coming into being of something\". This TNA revamp is the culmination of years of hard graft, and it pays homage to the origins of a promotional name once thought dead."
