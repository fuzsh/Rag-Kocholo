        "text": "I'm going to hit on multiple areas....\n\n1) Partnering\n\nI really do feel that this is in the early stages. It's more of an opportunity to work with right now. And as the details get fleshed out, it will trickle down from both the NASP and the USA Archery side.\n\nThe benefits of the partnership annoucement is already being seen in Arizona. The state archery board has been asked by the current NASP coordinator to see if we can find clubs/people to put up booths and participate in recruiting at the 8 NASP tournaments scheduled for 2019 in Arizona. We've been asked to do this before, but only at the state championships. This is the first time I've seen requests for attending the regional stuff.\n\n2) Education -\n\nWe (collectively) have to come up with a way to ease the transition from NASP level distances to normal competition distances. In a parallel discussion on this same subject on my Facebook page, Coach Gary Yamaguchi came up with a very cool idea on how to do that.\n\nIn addition to education on the USA Archery side, we have to find a way to break through the NASP cone of silence. Sadly, I think this has to be more of a regional/local attempt, and not from a national side. This means the state organizations have to find ways to penetrate the wall.\n\n3) Real numbers -\n\nLet's face it - NASP numbers are somewhat hyper inflated. They count every kid that shoots NASP in a PE setting as a NASP student. The real numbers are somewhere in between what all the state championship totals would be and the Nationals - and Nationals had roughly 14000 kids.\n\nSo let's take a worst case scenario and look at 14000 kids. I can literally count on both hands the kids that have made the successful transition from NASP to JOAD and beyond in the past 10 years. That's a minuscule amount of kids that transition. I think it's prudent to find out *why* these kids don't transition. Is it bad information? Is it cost? Is it equipment?\n\nWe've already seen things in three states (Arizona, Nevada, Oklahoma) where the NASP parents don't believe the distances used in competition outside of NASP. What's the cause of that? Seeing a 3 state spread like this isn't something regional - this is something that's caused from much higher up. Why?\n\nThis, unfortunately, is one part that will be the hardest and harshest to overcome.\n\n-Steve\n\nadded thoughts:\n\nsomewhat on tangent but i felt like part of the issue here is i did not even know modern competitive archery existed as a kid. you get the soccer, swimming, track, football, hoops, etc. flyers. even lacrosse. no archery. that's at least some of the problem, that and \"coverage.\" you couldn't move a step without tripping over one or more, sometimes competing, leagues in these youth sports where i grew up. nASP actually sounds like a decent response to this except unlike most of these sports it doesn't on-ramp enough on to anything else. it's almost like the \"no score no mean competition\" sports leagues.\n\nand more truly on a tangent but that the way we go about outdoor and/or the combo of outdoor/indoor may be an issue. give or take an occasional tournament my no sport free time would have been summer. if you want to catch kids without another demand on their time, summer might be your better chance. i know there's baseball and some others but not as many. once i got back to school it was soccer/track/x-country. you're fighting the whole mess of private sports plus school sports. so outdoor in the summer might be the time to catch people.\n\nwhich gets into a related point of how i felt like outdoors was treated like \"select\" for archery. few judge noobs indoors. you go outside and you hear it. you didn't suddenly get worse. you just tripped into the more serious season to many, the route to the olympics, etc. when i asked about outdoors to some i felt like it was pooh poohed like go work on your game and draw weight and come back. it's like select or travel team. except what if it would be the most attractive version to your average human, outside, nature, etc., and the best time to catch kids vs other sports. people complain about losing multisport kids. well, how about take them for the summer outdoors? the onramp is instead inside. indoors from november to march you probably trip some over almost every single school or club sport, at least part of their season. i played football for about 2 weeks one year. coach tried to make me choose with soccer. everyone can guess which one i picked. so take the athlete for one part of the season and make it the nice outdoors one. instead of an \"indoors\" standoff. or the idea they have to do it year round if they care. get the foothold and if they enjoy it they'll be back.\n\nthat might involve tinkering with how outdoors is done, novice divisions/distances, you of course could keep the \"big boy\" outdoors for 'select\" ie USAT kids.\n\nNASP is like ingeniously set up to be its own universe. I was going to propose we send some ringers back to NASP to show them how it was done, who could then point the other side of the bridge. But you'd have to teach them how to use a Genesis to be mildly subversive in this manner. It's not even like you could instruct one of your better recurvers to show up at NASP and mop the floor with their high end stuff (plus skill) because it wouldn't even be allowed. If you had to learn a second bow it's not worth the time to go back. Now I see why it's that self contained. If you do escape to try the other side of the bridge the normal coaches are turning you into a modern monster that is not going back. And until you cross the bridge you're on your own totally different rig not even mixing with our side at tournaments.\n\nBecause to me that's one way it gets sold, is when the convert goes back and whoops butt. In select soccer before high school you disappeared off most kids' radars. You know when you reappeared? PE or recess soccer. Then people figured it out. But if it's kind of a \"we don't know this exists\" thing until \"they go away and never come back,\" that ironically is kind of self sustaining. Anyone aware and brave enough to walk the bridge seemingly doesn't go back to liberate much of anyone else.\n\nAs such, my second suggestion is you send leading archers on field trips to promote the sport, except they show up with the serious rigs. Here is how the other half lives.\n\nOr JOADs start challenging NASPs. I keep suggesting swim team style coverage in part because I think archery's coverage is splotchy. But I also think if the team in one neighborhood coached by dads and moms sees how some professionally coached team looks......but the JOADs would probably think they are above it probably is part of the reason why both end up fairly closed systems. \"Why would we compete with them?\"\n\nOr maybe even if we wanted to be indirect, you let them know NFAA and in our state SYWAT exists. That would at least be a gateway drug. Without having to get into that debate they'd still get the exposure.\n\nLast thought, is it a knowledge issue? I know when we started out in soccer it was parent coaching. My first visibility of the bigger world was when we had a sibling coach who'd played HS and select. He freely told us, you know, there's select, there's HS, there's college, what the bigger world looked like. Do we leaflet/email these NASPs like \"this is what is out there?\" Part of my thing on archery is I don't remember it ever being in the leaflet pile. And if the leaflets need to sell, these are the programs that lead to youth Olympics and senior Olympics and world cups....sell it."
