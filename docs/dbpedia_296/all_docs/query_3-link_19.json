        "text": "In the sixty-seventh year of his life, Russell Herman left this earth. That was back in 1994. In the “last will and testament,” this Illinois man claimed to bequeath the following:\n\n• More than two billion dollars to the town of Cave-In-Rock\n\n• More than two billion dollars to the city of East St. Louis\n\n• About one and one half billion dollars for projects in Illinois\n\nIn a final act of what seemed like unprecedented generosity, he claimed he wished to leave six trillion dollars to the Federal Reserve to pay off the national debt (as it was at that time). His was a generous will. There was, however, a very significant problem. At the time of his death, Mr. Herman possessed only one actual piece of property: a “1983 Oldsmobile Toronado” automobile. He had no other assets to cover his bequests. He left this earth leaving us with a clear reminder: None of us can give away what we don’t possess.\n\nHis promises fell short because his resources couldn’t back up his desires. Does that sound familiar?\n\nToday, Jesus followers will gather in churches around the world. Some will pass on platitudes like: “God is as good as His promises – and they can be counted on.” Yet, if you ask different believers, you will get a very different list of what God actually promised to do for us. Truthfully, in the years I have ministered to people, I have met a number who became deeply embittered in their lives because promises they heard from believers in the name of God didn’t come through for them. Some of these walked away from the faith for a time, believing that God was either unable (insufficient) or unwilling (cruel) to do what they were told He promised. The real problem was: Someone misrepresented (either intentionally or through error) what God actually said. That is a key reason why knowing the Word well is so tremendously important. The role of an ambassador is to represent the words of the leader properly – and, I suspect, the church has paid too little attention to our role as ambassadors.\n\nLet’s make sure we understand the definitions of the problem. God’s promises are the assured assertions from His Word that He will act in a certain way. God’s commands are demands that press us to do what we should. While His promises are to be believed and trusted, they share with us something He will do. At the same time, His commands must be followed because they demand something from us. Some promises are conditional, but when understood carefully, God never over-promises or under-delivers. Sadly though, His promises can be misrepresented by His followers. That is to say, it is possible to falsely or mistakenly exclaim a “promise” in the name of God.\n\nIn fact, we can misrepresent the Word so badly that people will scorn God because He will appear to “let them down” – when someone offered promises in His name He never agreed to make.\n\nFortunately, we have God’s Word to clear up what He did and didn’t actually promise. In particular, we have in this lesson a good model we can trace inside the Biblical story of Jacob. Here is the truth that will become clear as you read the account in Genesis 29-31.\n\nKey Principle: While God’s presence and promises won’t exempt believers from troubles, they will offer both a constant companion in troubled times and an ultimate understanding of the place of troubles.\n\nSix things God didn’t promise:\n\nIn this lesson, we want to trace what happened after Jake began a walk with God. He met God on a journey, and God’s promised presence with Jake didn’t do six things that some people confuse as promises in God’s name:\n\nFirst, the promises and presence didn’t remove all uncertainty about how to move forward; yet they did allow him to see God at work in his daily circumstances (29:1-14).\n\nTake a look at Genesis 29 for a moment. It reads:\n\nGenesis 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east. 2 He looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for from that well they watered the flocks. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large. 3 When all the flocks were gathered there, they would then roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well. 4 Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.” 5 He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.” … 9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. 10 When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. 11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted his voice and wept. 12 Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah’s son, and she ran and told her father. 13 So when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he related to Laban all these things. 14 Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him a month.\n\nIt happened that as Jacob followed the trail with the directions he was given, he ended up at the right well, at a perfect time to ask about his family. He came to the place just before the beautiful daughter of Laban (who would captivate his eyes for the rest of his days) happened to be walking up. For the one who doesn’t know God, such moments seem like a coincidence. For the one who does know God, there is providence.\n\nEven a young believer like Jake couldn’t miss God’s hand in his life. He asked questions and watched the scene unfold. At the same time, you don’t get the sense that he knew where things were heading that day. The questions reveal there was uncertainty. He knew what he was supposed to be doing there, but he wasn’t sure this was the place, and these were the people.\n\nFrom time to time I hear people say things like: “I knew it was the Lord, because everything dropped into place.” I know what they mean. When the Lord is working on something, often I find a “flow” that just overtakes the situation. As fast as a problem arises, a solution appears. I have seen it many times.\n\nAt the same time, that isn’t a promise of God.\n\nWhile providence of God is a promise, a smooth ride is not. We must not infer that God has eliminated from a believer the sheer uncertainty of earthly life. The Bible doesn’t include absolute certainty about our next move, even in the pursuit of following Him.\n\nYou and I don’t know the next problem we will face, or obstacle that will challenge us, and we are misrepresenting God if we act as though He has promised to make our paths ever-clear. He has not. In fact, if you look carefully in the Word and consider the second mission journey of the Apostle Paul, you will note that before the Macedonian man vision, he didn’t know what direction he was going next in a mission journey! Even a mission trip isn’t promised to always go smoothly.\n\nThe promise God made us is that he would “never leave us nor forsake us.” The prize of His presence doesn’t accompany unending bliss and certain turns of the road in this life. God didn’t promise to remove my troubles, He promised to insert His presence into my life through all my troubles. The abundant life we have is wrapped in the delight of facing daily life with the powerful and loving Companion. We aren’t exempted from pain; He joins Himself to us and bears it with us. Our rest is in His goodness, not in life’s fairness.\n\nSecond, the promises and presence didn’t remove all the drudgery from life; they did provide a sense that God was working things out as Jake worked hard (29:15-20).\n\nProvidence isn’t an excuse for lying in a hammock and blaming God for your unemployment. Providence assures a companion while you labor, sometimes pushing twenty pounds of paper reports off your desk, or lifting heavy boulders and clearing them from your field. Look at what Jake did:\n\nGenesis 29:15 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?” 16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 17 And Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful of form and face. 18 Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” 19 Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man; stay with me.” 20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.\n\nWhile we may all tempted to say: “Awwww” over the last sentence as we contemplate Jake’s infatuation with Rachel, that isn’t the whole point being made in the passage. Jake worked for seven years. He got up early, took care of the flocks and herds, and dropped on his mat at the end of a long, hot, day. Just because we read it in a simple sentence, didn’t mean it wasn’t arduous, sweaty work.\n\nWas God with him? Yes! Did that mean he could sleep in and coast in life and still get ahead? No! The promise of God’s presence and even the promises of God’s specific blessing were not to be construed with some “get out of work free” card that Jake could play. Your promises aren’t either. From the moment God began speaking to Adam, the instructions sounded like a job – because we were created to find resolution and completion in work. It doesn’t matter whether it is manual labor or computer programming – the work may be long and tedious – but it is accompanied by God’s presence and His stamp of blessing deep within.\n\nThird, the promises and presence didn’t exempt Jake from being cheated by those around him; yet God stayed beside him and worked in spite of it all (29:21-30).\n\nIt would be great if I could promise you that lightning wouldn’t strike your transformer and your back wouldn’t go out because you love and follow Jesus – but teaching that would also be a misrepresentation of God’s real promises. Add to that, you might work hard and be honest, and a lie by a jealous and conniving co-worker could still put you in the unemployment line. How do I know? Look back at our story…\n\nGenesis 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is completed, that I may go in to her.” 22 Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast. 23 Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah, and brought her to him; and Jacob went in to her. … 25 So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?” 26 But Laban said, “It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the firstborn. 27 Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for another seven years.” … 30 So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and indeed he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years.\n\nThis famous tale in the Bible offers us an easily overlooked point: Jake got played even though he did what was right and was following God’s plan. Let that sink in for a moment.\n\nGod never promised believers they would get full and complete justice here on Earth. He does claim that He keeps perfect score. He does promise to heal our wounds and to punish evil men and women. What He DOES NOT PROMISE is short-term satisfaction and a certainty of outcome before eternal judgment after this life. He promises ultimate justice, but not immediate justice.\n\nGod never promised believers a life of comfort provided by the conditions here on Earth. Though some believers may experience material prosperity and success, it is a terrible assumption that God will apply that to all and give us an easy life. We don’t all have the same call, even though we all have the same God. We differ in gifts and we differ in what God intends to do in and through us.\n\nI think often about the words of Jesus in relation to my personal expectations – and I have to admit that I have a privileged life!\n\nJohn 16:33 I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”\n\nThe peace I have is IN CHRIST, not in comforts of this world. If I get material prosperity, that is in addition to His presence! Our life was not offered a guarantee of temporal comfort, but it was promised a fulfilment based on our conscious walk with the Savior. Why doesn’t God deal with wrong right now? There are many reasons. One important reason is this: God is not only patient with us; He is equally patient toward those who may choose to oppress us.\n\nJake got played in spite of his walk with God. Paul got stoned by evil men. Most of the disciples were executed as Apostles. If we think we are promised material prosperity, we aren’t following the bread crumb trail of the first three hundred years of Christian history.\n\nFourth, the promises and presence didn’t insulate him from repeating mistakes learned in his family life; but even those mistakes became a platform for God’s blessings (29:31-35).\n\nMost of the rest of Genesis 29 tells of the earliest children born to Jake by his “runner up” wife Leah. The story unfolds as Leah tries to win his love and attention by offering her body and producing a child. It is a sad story in many respects, but one thought jumps off the page reading verse thirty-one:\n\nGenesis 29:31 Now the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.\n\nJake, who should have understood the pain involved in favoritism, played the same game in his own tent camp (among his wives) that his parents played in his upbringing. He was only ON this journey away from home because of the dysfunction that came from “ranking” relationships and picking favorites in the home. Did God’s new relationship with him insulate him from falling back into old habits? It surely did not.\n\nBelievers get a new connection to God, but have to work deliberately to distance themselves from their old thinking and habits. It isn’t a passive process. It takes WORK. It requires growing in discipline. It isn’t JUST self-effort (it requires God’s Spirit) but it INCLUDES deliberate effort.\n\nThat is the work involved in sanctification – where the Spirit of God works in you to change you to become more like Jesus – and you actively listen and respond to make course corrections in life.\n\nJake reminds us of one of the biggest problems we face in our Christian life – our default settings from an earlier life were not set to “holy.” We came to our relationship with God with some of the settings requiring deliberate re-set to change from the default. Liars must learn to speak the truth. Gossips must learn to curb their impulses. It takes time, and it isn’t guaranteed to fall off of us because we now know God any more than our extra weight put on in living an excessive life before we knew Him.\n\nFifth, the promises and presence of God didn’t guarantee peace and quiet in Jake’s home life; but it did provide him a way to cope with people disappointments (30:1-43).\n\nFor time sake, let me simply mention that chapter thirty has two stories to illustrate this truth:\n\nWith his barren wife Rachel, Jake shared his newfound perspective that things on earth are initiated in Heaven (30:1-24). When Rachel complained to Jacob, he immediately made clear that he wasn’t the responsible party – God made babies. (Obviously, there is collaboration!) You cannot help but notice, particularly in Genesis 30:14ff, how his wives thought mechanistically about pregnancy, but Jacob knew the matter was ultimately in the hands of God. Jake’s answer wasn’t a “cop out;” it was the truth. He could participate in the process, but God had to make it chemically work.\n\nIn the case of Laban’s trickery later in the chapter, Jake clearly didn’t have an exemption from undergoing real tests by a man who was dishonest (see Genesis 30:25-43); yet the vices of his boss didn’t thwart God’s ability to advance Jake. Jake saw God bless him even when his boss was trying to stiff him from a prosperous future. Note the summary verse:\n\nGenesis 30:43 So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.\n\nIt is true that Jake furthered in material prosperity, but the point I want us to see is that problems kept rolling in, despite his walk with God. There is one more…\n\nSixth, the promises and presence of God didn’t keep Jacob from facing jealousy about his life; but it did offer him God’s direction from His Word (Genesis 31:16).\n\nChapter 31 opened with:\n\nGenesis 31:1 Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.” 2 Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not friendly toward him as formerly. … 6 You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 7 Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times…”\n\nI count three things that were mentioned: lies, unfair attitude and wage cheating. Does that sound like Jake was sailing through life unscathed by the pain of others? No, it does not. Yet, let’s end with the positive. Let’s listen to how Jake framed his life after he got a walk with God. He said:\n\nGenesis 31:7b …however, God did not allow him to hurt me. 8 If he spoke thus, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock brought forth striped.\n\nFirst, Jake knew Laban didn’t set fair contests, but didn’t control the outcome alone.\n\nThe table may have been rigged, but God still controls the laws of the physical world. Remember this: no matter where you are, no matter who thinks they are in charge, no matter how unfair the plot… God is still there. He hasn’t left you. He will do what He promised when it tells His story in the most complete way possible. That won’t guarantee you will always feel good about circumstances, but it will quench the burning within that injustice will prevail. It won’t.\n\nListen as he finished his words:\n\nGenesis 31:11 Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, “‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ 12 He said, ‘Lift up now your eyes and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. 13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”\n\nSecond, God didn’t offer promises and walk off the set of the drama.\n\nHe stayed in Jake’s life, interacting with him and speaking into the dark moments. God’s providence is about His continual presence with us, not about a peaceful and idyllic journey through fields of bliss. You don’t always find God by peaceful streams. Sometimes He meets you in the lion’s den or the fiery furnace. The point is: If YOU are there, HE is there. He hasn’t lost track of you.\n\nGod’s hand wasn’t only obvious to Jake, but also to those around him. If Jake groused, complained, barked and fussed – they wouldn’t see that blessing. God let Jake know He was there, and Jake reflected that to those closest to him. Listen to what one of his wives said to him:\n\nGenesis 31:16 Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you.\n\nLet me ask you if you reflect God’s goodness to you so that those around you can see it. I don’t always do it – but we need to work at it! We tell people we have a walk with God and then complain about the government and our boss and our conditions in life like God isn’t still there.\n\nLet’s be clear about God’s promises and His presence. Let’s say it the way the Word does:\n\nGod’s presence and promises don’t exempt believers from troubles; they offer His constant companionship and an ultimate understanding of trouble.\n\nThere is a word quiz where someone created a rather clever puzzle. Let me share it with you:\n\n• What is it that is greater than God?\n\n• More evil than Satan?\n\n• Rich people DON’T have it?\n\n• Poor people DO have it?\n\n• And if you eat it… you will die?\n\nThe answer: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING\n\n• Nothing is greater than God.\n\n• Nothing is more evil than Satan.\n\n• Rich people don’t have nothing; they have much.\n\n• Poor people have nothing.\n\n• And if you eat nothing… you’ll eventually die – skinny and sad.\n\nThe puzzle makes sense once you know the answer, but until you hear the answer, it is very confusing. That’s the case with our lesson this morning. Without the answer, the problems will confound you.\n\nLet me offer you the answer: His name is Jesus, and He offers you His constant presence and some incredible promises.\n\nBeloved, believers don’t keep one eye focused on Heaven out of the need for sheer escapism. We dream about our future, because it is where our Savior will be clearly seen. It is where God’s true reign will be unmasked and God deep love will be thoroughly revealed.\n\nWe will not find consolation in the justice system of a fallen world filled with liars and broken people.\n\nWe will not find peace in families that are being whipped by false views of sexuality, submission and servant-hood.\n\nWe will not find sinlessness in the gates of the church of sinners, where secrets continue and sins are carefully covered.\n\nWe will not find ultimate truth on the internet of those disconnected from their Creator.\n\nJustice, peace, sinless splendor and truth – these are Heaven things. These are our future in Jesus. That is where we will see Him face to face.\n\nThe Television Network CBS ran a report recently about a new show they are running on the air called God Friended Me. They wrote:\n\n[The show] is a humorous, uplifting drama about an outspoken atheist whose life is turned upside down when he receives a friend request on social media from God and unwittingly becomes an agent of change in the lives and destinies of others around him. Miles Finer is intelligent, hopeful and optimistic, but he doesn’t believe in God. This puts him at odds with his father, Reverend Arthur Finer, a beloved preacher at Harlem’s Trinity Church for 25 years who is stung by his son’s strong rejection of his faith. Miles feels he’s found his purpose in life hosting a podcast where he’s free to speak his mind, but that changes when he receives the ultimate friend request. After repeated pokes by God, Miles’ curiosity takes over, and he accepts the request and follows the signs to Cara Bloom, an online journalist suffering from writer’s block. Brought together by the “God Account,” the two find themselves investigating God’s friend suggestions and inadvertently helping others in need. … Miles is set on getting to the bottom of what he believes is an elaborate hoax, but in the meantime he’ll play along and, in the process, change his life forever.\n\nI don’t believe that description has enticed me to watch the show, but it is nice to see God on CBS Prime time, at least in some vague form. It is even nicer to be reminded that those who have tried to follow God have left a trail of good deeds behind them – like the founding of our nation’s greatest schools, hospitals, orphanages and many benevolent works. It is a nice break from the growing sense of national hostility concerning the notion of a Creator.\n\nToday we encounter a story that CBS won’t run, but it has the extra virtue of being a true story about a man who heard from God and walked away changed. Prior to that meeting with God, he was for all practical purposes an atheist, but grew up in the home of a God follower. Like many who grow up that way, he knew all the right words, but, when alone, made very different choices than God would have wanted, or his parents would have appreciated. The text of Genesis made clear Jacob, the subject of our study, didn’t meet God as a reward for being good. Rather, his story up to this point was filled with lies and deception. He cheated his les clever brother, and deceived his nearly blind dad on his death bed. Yet, God met him as he attempted to flee the scene after he got caught in his lies and faced paying the penalty. Here is the truth our story will make very clear…\n\nKey Principle: A real meeting with God changes us.\n\nWhen Isaiah saw God, high and lifted up (cp. Isa. 6), it changed his life. When God set afire a bush in Midian, the encounter wasn’t just a curiosity; it was a life change moment for Moses…You see, God doesn’t desire to slowly nudge us; He desires to profoundly change our life direction by a meeting with us – a divine interruption in our path. It won’t be a “poke” or “text message;” it will be something we know was Him when it happens.\n\nThe opening word of the story\n\nTo see this truth at work, let’s pick up our account with the simple, but powerful first word of Genesis 28:1 So…\n\nWhat a loaded word! The “so” suggests the story we are about to engage was based on a timeline of events that preceded it – for good reason. The “so” reminds us that by this point in the story, it became perfectly clear to both Isaac (Jacob’s dad) and Esau (Jacob’s older brother) that Jacob and Rebekah (Jake’s mom) conspired and tricked the nearly blind and elderly Isaac to get a financial windfall in his will. Jacob took by clever deception what was originally intended for Esau, the double–portion of inheritance and the charge over the camp that came with his “firstborn” status. Now Jake had the legal writ, but his trick wasn’t accepted by everyone as a completed deal.\n\nIn fact, (if you check Genesis 27:41) it is clear that Esau intended to kill Jacob as soon as he possibly could, in retribution for what he had taken. Isaac was still alive, but wouldn’t be for long. One of the last scenes times in which he played a role in the Word was when he brought Jacob in to tell him to flee the scene and preserve his life. Ironically, Isaac the passive probably only did this to appease his wife, because she heard people around the tent camp claiming Esau was seething and plotting Jake’s death (according to Genesis 27:42).\n\nTime for an exit\n\nIn any case, Jake knew it was time to hit the trail and get out of there. Momma Rebekah’s words to Jake were these:\n\nGenesis 27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Haran, to my brother Laban! 44 Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury subsides, 45 until your brother’s anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”\n\nCan you hear it? Rebekah felt she could manage the situation. May I make an observation for a moment? So far, about everything she did led Jake into deeper trouble.\n\nWhen you have a friend that keeps suggesting things that land you in a hospital bed or jail cell, you may want to expand your horizons and find some new (and dare I say, safer) friends. If you got banged up in the last few exchanges, don’t fall for the “I know a guy who has this really cool, inexpensive “bungee jumping” place you will just love…\n\nWhat is really interesting is that while Rebekah was pulling aside Jake to prepare him to go, she was also bending Isaac’s ear about “what to instruct Jake to do” in finding a wife. She didn’t seem “short on advice” but perhaps thought some things would come better from even a passive dad. Genesis 27:46 tells the story this way:\n\nGenesis 27:46 Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”\n\nLet’s acknowledge that parents with adult children who have walked out in defiance of the family’s long stated values understand Rebekah’s comment: “I am sooo tired of this!” It IS exhausting to watch a grown child depart from right thinking and right living. Esau’s choices left momma tired of her life!\n\nWell, the time came and Jake entered again into his dad’s tent – this time to hear his dad’s words about heading north. It couldn’t have been easy, since it was clear that he wasn’t honest with his dad a short time before. I am guessing this was rather awkward.\n\nNot only that, but you shouldn’t miss the irony in the fact that Jacob was now on his way out of the Promised Land which was a key to the blessing God promised Abraham. The whole story is about a land and children being blessed to live in it. By cleverness, Jake got what amounted to a worthless blessing because he couldn’t peaceably inhabit the land simply because he couldn’t outrun his brother’s arrows. How could this be in the life of the “promised child” of Abraham’s seed?\n\nConsider this: Jacob focused on getting material blessing in this life, not a walk with God for eternity. You never find the right things looking in the wrong direction.\n\nHe wanted to control his life now, he couldn’t waste time worrying about his life for the ions to follow this life. By his choices we can surmise he wasn’t really sure if there was a God, and perhaps he didn’t give it much thought. Jake’s thinking was more: “A man will get whatever his clever mind can grab from dullards around him.” When clever is a high value, integrity is a low one. When winning is all that matters, how you play the game just isn’t your focus.\n\nOften God appears absent to one who is about to meet Him. Go back to Genesis 28:1 and pick up the story:\n\nGenesis 28:1b …Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. 3 May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples. 4 May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.”\n\nIsaac tossed out a blessing that sounded like he may have been shaking his head and hoping for the best. This was the distance throw at the buzzer – there was no more time to put points on the board. Isaac used up his dad instruction time, and Jake was heading off to face the world. What he didn’t know was what Isaac knew – he was heading into the family of his wife’s relatives – and that was going to be an eye-opening experience for the young man. I cannot help but feel the possibility of sarcasm when Isaac offered: “I trust you get back… and “be blessed” dealing with your momma’s family.” \n\nJake, confident in his clever mind, thought he knew where he was headed and who he would meet – but God interrupted his plan. Keep reading:\n\nGenesis 28:5 Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.\n\nThat was the summary of the journey. Now follow for a moment the detail of the journey that changed the young man – because in these verses the “big idea” becomes clear…\n\nGod Interrupted the journey\n\nSkip down a few verses…\n\nGenesis 28:10 Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran. 11 He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place. 12 He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 13 And behold, the Lord stood above it and said…\n\nWhen God touches your life, you see (perhaps for the first time) the reality of life. Things are much more than they appear to be on the surface. The text detailed:\n\n• He went to sleep and had a dream (28:12a).\n\n• He saw the connection between the two worlds (28:12b).\n\n• He saw the Lord above those who operated in both worlds (28:13).\n\nJake knew cunning and cleverness. He knew how to plot. What he never really stopped to consider was the fact that there isn’t just a physical world; there is a spiritual world behind what we see at home, at work and in our community.\n\nThe Bible is full of stories of people who set the limits of their understanding of life on this world and neglect to consider the power of the spiritual world operating behind it.\n\n• Job’s friends tried to make sense of life without taking into account there may be a spiritual reason beyond the “cause and effect” world of the physical.\n\n• Moses heard God’s voice from the bush and realized it wasn’t just a bush on fire – it was a holy place to meet God.\n\n• Joshua, the High Priest and friend to Zechariah (cp. Zech. 3) wasn’t just discouraged about the temple; he was under attack by Satan’s minions.\n\nI am not trying to sound spooky, but it is clear that you are more than you appear. You are both physical and spiritual. If you have not really spent much time thinking about your life as part of two worlds, you are like many of those who entered the Biblical account trying to make sense of life solely on the basis of the five human senses. The problem is, if you are perceptive about life, your senses will lead you to see the broken world and its inequity. That happened to Solomon, the author-king who left us his diary in Ecclesiastes. He rightly concluded that life here doesn’t make sense – because the One Who holds the story together isn’t under the sun, but in the heavens.\n\nThe Bible opens with a simple idea it presents as fact: all things here were caused by One in a dimension different than ours. There is a spiritual world. The things we see here don’t, won’t, and can’t make ultimate sense without the rest of the picture.\n\nThe “rest of the story”\n\nSome of us recall the name Paul Harvey. Beginning as a newscaster during the Second World War, Paul offered his own brand of story-telling which consisted of stories presented as little-known or forgotten facts on a variety of subjects with some key element of the story (usually the name of some well-known person) held back until the end. Each broadcast concluded with some variation on his tag line “And now you know the rest of the story.”\n\nThink of your life this way: It cannot make complete sense until you set the physical world into “the rest of the story.”\n\nListen to what God told Jake when He appeared in the dream:\n\nGenesis 28:13b “…I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants. 14 Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 15 Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”\n\nPerhaps it is already clear enough, but we should point out that knowing there is a spiritual world isn’t enough to cause you to change course in your life – and it wasn’t enough for Jake long ago. God spoke. He explained what He intended. He clarified where Jake fit in His plan.\n\nFor some who are encountering this story (maybe for the first time) with an open heart, this is the piece you have been waiting for. Perhaps you have already been open to the understanding there is a spiritual world. Maybe you have long believed (though it didn’t set the boundaries of your behaviors) that God exists. That’s great, but that isn’t enough.\n\nConsider the six things God said to Jake:\n\n• I am the Lord.\n\n• I met your fathers before you.\n\n• I made promises and you heard about them.\n\n• I have things planned for you and your children.\n\n• I am with you all the time.\n\n• You aren’t finished here; I will be drawing you back here later.\n\nThese six revealed truths changed Jake. Think of how knowing each would change you:\n\n• If the One you are meeting truly is Master of all things, it is time to consider the fact that you are not some anonymous being hidden in the cluster of creation; God knows you. He sees you. He is aware of where you are, who you are and what you have done with the life He has provided for you.\n\n• If this God has been working with those before you, you have received the benefit of a life that should have taught you to consider how what you are doing looks to God. We can’t sing “God bless America” and then make law after law that ignores Him, marginalizes His Word and makes right something judgy and negative. Our fathers carefully structured our society because they held “these truths to be self-evident, that all men were created and endowed by their Creator certain inalienable rights…”\n\n• The recorded promises of God have been dropped into our life through countless translations and illustrated Bible books. God hasn’t been silent or somehow elusive. In modern circles, there has been a deliberate attempt to marginalize His Word from our society (something that is causing us to shudder from our foundational documents) and to introduce any number of “counter-claims” of other gods and religious texts. The outcome has been confusion and distancing our modern behavior from the legal foundation of our fathers. We are building to a national moral disaster, but God isn’t done with His grace!\n\nGet personal with the last part of what God told Jacob. God claimed that He was with Jake all through his life. The journey wasn’t happening alone. God was there, God was watching and God wanted Jake to know it.\n\nIs that where you are? Are you living your life with the full awareness that you are never alone? Let me offer this simple truth: If you truly believe God is watching, it will change how you respond to the issues of your life from this point forward. If Heaven is a reality, and not just a distant story – knowledge of it will change how you judge things. If God is really engaged in your life, it will force you to consider how much of your life is intentional about following Him.\n\nC. S. Lewis said it this way: “You don’t have a soul. You ARE a soul. You have a body.”\n\nThat is the observation of one who has encountered God. Now keep reading, for the last part of the story shows clearly that “a real meeting with God changes us.” Look at how Jacob responded to God revealing Himself to him.\n\nGenesis 28:16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” 17 He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.” 18 So Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top. 19 He called the name of that place Bethel; however, previously the name of the city had been Luz. 20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear, 21 and I return to my father’s house in safety, then the Lord will be my God. 22 This stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.”\n\nJake got up and admitted that God slammed into his life without warning and that he was utterly unaware of God’s activities in that place before the dream – but he acknowledged that what he saw was real.\n\nThe beginning place for us is to hear the revealed truth of God and then respond as though it is true – because it is.\n\nThe two profound reactions in Genesis 28:17 were fear and awe. He recognized the Creator of all things took the time to encounter him, a fleeing trickster on the run from his own selfish pursuits. Is that you? Are you living for yourself? Is God using His Word to pierce into you self-managed life?\n\nWhen Jake recognized God was truly speaking, in Genesis 28:18-19, he marked the place with signs of worship and surrender. He didn’t want to get back to his regularly scheduled life – this changed his perception. It gave him the “why” of his life. He couldn’t just pass it by. He stopped, set up a memorial stone and poured out oil, a sign of a place of comfort, of healing and of worship.\n\nPastor Wesley Bishop offered this is a sermon some time ago:\n\nWe didn’t think up the need for worship. Someone wasn’t sitting around one day and said, “Hey, I think we should worship God.” Worship is not a human innovation. Some of what we do in worship is born of human creativity. Humans, using their God-given creativity, wrote the songs we sing… Even though the MEANS may include human effort, the ACT of worship was a God made thing.\n\nJake made a vow that promised God something. He told God that if His Word is true, he would vow to follow God’s leading. He would listen to God’s further directions as life progressed. He would give back a portion of his income to God to thank Him for His protection and oversight. In effect, he would begin living daily with a knowledge that God is watching, God has a plan, and God has deliberate expectations He is making known.\n\nJacob’s surrender to God included the same elements we all must have in such a Divine encounter:\n\n• Trust that God is able to keep His Word concerning our destiny. (28:20).\n\n• Recognition of subjection to God as Master (28:21).\n\n• Surrender of things I “own” to His use (28:22).\n\nSam Wrisley shared this touching example a few years ago:\n\nCurrently Rudy is locked up and locked up is what he deserves. I met Rudy 4 years ago. He was drunk at a bus station. He wanted a bus ticket and I bought it for him. It would not be the last ticket I’d buy for Rudy. Rudy was arrested for robbery when he was 17. The judge sentenced him to 10 years in prison. One can imagine what hard time does to a teenager…\n\nHe has spent most of his life on the wrong side of the law… in fact on the wrong side of society. I didn’t know why but God wanted me to continue to invest into [what at the time seemed like] this worthless person. It’s taken four years but I now see why. It’s because no one is worthless to God. He has a plan for his children. I received a letter from jail just this week from Rudy and I want to share his words.\n\n“Sam, you can tell the church that I pray for them as much as they do me. I’m learning that I should pray for others. God will take care of me. He knows my needs. Also tell them to bring it, don’t sing it! Like you said what are you doing Monday through Saturday? Being a Christian to me is 24/7 365. And as the word says, Love, Love, Love. In here I am tested daily. different ways. One word comes to mind. LOVE! That’s how I’m doing my time. I refuse to give Satan any power over me. (i love this part) I’m locked up and happy 🙂 You tell everybody that once you FINALLY surrender they will enjoy peace and happiness that I’m experiencing and sharing with others. Well I miss everybody… Take care. God Bless. RUDY” “worthy is the Lamb:)”\n\nSpiritually, freedom comes through surrender. God set an incarcerated man free like Rudy because he recognized the implications of life being greater than the world of his cell… Praise God for true freedom!\n\nRemember: A real meeting with God changes us.\n\nAre you ready to be changed?\n\nThis is a lesson that begins a short series on a fight. The whole story is a tale of working through the pain of struggles.\n\nI want to focus on one man for a few lessons and look at his family, and his life story as God related it in His Word. To do that, today we plan to move around the area of Genesis 24-26 and then at the end, drop into Genesis 27 and hopefully “catch” something we can all digest. Our focus is on the story of Jacob.\n\nTo prepare us, I want to begin with a set of questions that require you to be brutally honest with me. Are you ready?\n\nFirst, let me ask: “How many of you are parents? One of my friends would say it, “How many of you own another human?”\n\nWith that number in mind, “How many of you honestly recall and are willing to publicly admit, that you lost one of your children for a time during their time under your supervision?”\n\nTo let you relax and make you breathe a little easier, let me tell you a story out of the “Smith Log” from a few years back, when my third child was still a tiny toddler.\n\nDottie and I were packing for a camping trip when we lived in Jerusalem. At that time, also living in our home was a young lady from South Africa who helped in our office and sometimes took care of our children. We were three adults watching over a busy travel office, a growing ministry and three little children. On that morning, Dottie and I were packing the van to go on a trip with all of our family, and we both thought Karen (the South African girl) knew where the kids were (I thought they were playing in their rooms). My little red-head, Sara Joy, took that opportunity (a breach in parental security) to make a break for it and wander down the street and cross the road to the local mall across the way. When mom and I realized that she was gone, and we had no clue where she was – we both moved swiftly down our street hollering for her and scanning yard by yard. After what seemed like a decade or two in lost child time, we discovered that Sara was sitting happily enjoying treats with the security guard at “Kanion HarE” in Gilo, our Jerusalem suburb’s local mall. The security guard spotted her wandering in the parking lot and took her in until parents came calling for her. He was kind and, to be honest, Sara didn’t feel lost. She knew where she was. She knew what she was eating. She was perfectly happy. We were panicked and, truth be told, near nervous breakdowns, both of us! Though Sara found safety, for a time, in the hand of a security guard at the local mall, she had two issues. First, the security guard wasn’t the right place to find true parental security; and second – she didn’t realize she wasn’t really safe. That guard wasn’t her real daddy, and he didn’t have her true long term interest at heart. He did his job, but it wasn’t the safety she would find in her family, holding mom or dad’s hand.\n\nThere is a point to the story of this unsettling memory. As we look at the introduction to Jacob’s life as God dropped him into the arms of his parents, we will see that Jacob started life believing real security came from grabbing a familiar pattern his parents lived out in front of him – instead of grasping God’s hand and following Him. His early life illustrated a truth that is so important for us to consider, God told it in His Word. Here is the big idea of his story I would like you to consider…\n\nKey Principle: Real safety comes from grabbing the right hand and letting your true Father guide you.\n\nWe must cling – not to the pattern of life we learned growing up – but to the Savior of it!\n\nIf you study it carefully, you will notice that Jacob’s life was a struggle to learn how to hold his true Daddy’s hand – and not the other many hands he could easily have clasped to feel secure. Look even closer, but that is your story and my story as well!\n\nLet’s take a moment and “set up” the story beginning in Genesis 24.\n\nFirst, a quick overview of the text is probably justified. It is significant that the author of Genesis spent ten whole chapters on Jacob.\n\n• He only spent 11 chapters describing the long period of time from creation, the flood and on to the tower of Babel.\n\n• He included 14 or 15 chapters on Abraham (12-25) from which God established His covenant people.\n\nIt seems like ten chapters is a rather large stage for teaching God’s lessons. His story must be important – and we will find it truly IS.\n\nSecond, I am also forced to at least suggest that if modern “reality TV” is any indication of what Americans think is interesting, this short series on Jacob should be riveting. More than most stories of the Bible, his tale graphically displays the unusual interrelations of an entirely dysfunctional family, and cautiously highlights the influence bad parents can have on their children. This story is almost a “made for TV” series.\n\nLet’s start the story with Isaac: Jacob’s dad.\n\nGenesis has already been chronicling the life of Isaac, his dad. What is shared wasn’t particularly flattering, but does help us understand the family from which Jacob emerged. Genesis 24:1-9 opens with a scene late in the life of Abraham, when he had a servant set out to look for a wife for his son, Isaac. We begin here in our look at Jacob, because knowing his dad will help you understand the setting of his life. The servant of Abraham (we suspect it is Eliezar) is in the scene…\n\nGenesis 24:10 recorded: Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.\n\nIt isn’t a stretch to admit that living in the shadow of the towering figure of Abraham; the Bible offered few details on Isaac, as though he really didn’t do much that was significant. That’s probably an unfair assessment (since I am not even mentioned in the Bible at all), but I think you understand why I said it. Isaac’s little story feels like, when you read it, a journal of “going along” with God’s work in his family. One writer called his story one of “passive acceptance” because he seemed to do the right things, but he was not presented as a very passionate player in the drama of his own life!\n\nConsider the example of the scene we were just looking at and the fact that Isaac didn’t find his own wife – his dad sent a servant to do it. If I understand Genesis 25:20 properly, I can’t help but notice he appears to have been forty years old at the time. (Talk about a late launch!) …At least the servant knew where to look.\n\nOddly, if you look back into Genesis, it seems the place to meet a potential wife was at a watering hole, a well or a spring.\n\n• Moses met his wife at a well in Midianite territory and chased away harassing bandits.\n\n• Jacob scoped out the coming of Rachel by asking at the local well and then gallantly helped remove the stone over that well with the others who were gathered there.\n\nHere’s the thing… in Genesis 24, Isaac didn’t even go to the well to find a wife. His father’s servant traveled a distance, found the right well, and got him a wife. It feels like we are being set up to see Isaac as a rather passive guy, and if you read the story – you will see that feeling fits the later narrative.\n\nIsaac wasn’t a bad guy. I don’t want to only include his weakness. When he hit a wall, he was as likely to seek God as NOT, but that isn’t the most rousing endorsement. He had God’s blessing, but that wasn’t a guarantee he could be a good dad, just a rich one. Drop into Genesis 25 and take a quick look for a moment.\n\nGenesis 25:11 It came about after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi….21 Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD answered him and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n\nIt seems Isaac learned some level of trust in God. Consider that:\n\n• God’s blessing became personal after Abraham, not just from Abraham (25:11).\n\n• When trouble came; he prayed – so he had some kind of walk with God. Isaac knew that God could deliver in the need for a baby – because God did it for HIS DAD years before. At the same time, he knew it took a relationship with God to steady him through the days of disappointment and keep him from undue impatience with God’s timing!\n\n• God seemed to step in when asked and answer the prayer in accord with the promises given to Isaac’s dad. It seems like God wanted to keep the story going in Isaac, even if he was weak and passive.\n\nI guess if I could communicate anything, it would be that Isaac just wasn’t a great leader or deep man of passion as he is shared with us in the text…\n\nAs we close in on the story of Isaac – observe the story that introduced Rebekah: Jacob’s Mom.\n\nGo back again to the story of the servant that discovered Rebekah as a wife for Isaac, who became Jacob’s mom. The servant came to the well, and Rebekah offered to water his ten camels, while the man prayed she would make the offer as a sign to him:\n\nGenesis 24: 19 Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking.” 20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels. 21 Meanwhile, the man was gazing at her in silence, to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not.\n\nIt is clear in the text that God’s choice was Rebekah. To really grasp what we learn about her from this little snapshot, there are a few things you should probably know about camels that make this story shine with vivid detail.\n\n• First, they can drink 21-22 gallons in a single standing. Since a gallon is 8.3 pounds, a thirsty camel could add more than 200 pounds from one long drink. As a former helper in the camel drive, I can tell you that you NEVER let them drink that much in a single standing, or they will get drunk. It happens because of their blood vessels and the way the blood passes through their brain area.\n\n• Since there were ten camels and Rebekah watered all of them, and since they had just come “hot off the desert sands” – I think it is obvious that Rebekah possessed incredible biceps and back muscles, and was not built like a “fashion week” model on a red carpet. She was one formidable woman you wouldn’t want to arm wrestle! (She was, no doubt, listed on “Farmer’s Only” dating sites).\n\nIf you took the time to research the whole account of her early days in Genesis, you would discover Rebekah was from nothing short of treacherous family of “used camel salesman” types like her brother Laban – who became a legendary manipulative negotiator, as we will see later in the series. Funny enough, her dad was also quite passive based on the text.\n\nPut Isaac and Rebekah together and I think it is safe to conclude from reading the Word that the natural passivity and weakness in Isaac opened the door to allowing Rebekah, Jacob’s mom, to take over their home. Add to that the fact that she had experience engaging dishonesty and manipulation growing up with a passive dad and her brother Laban back in Mesopotamia. In the end, baby Jake was no match for what his parents patterned in their home.\n\nPattern One: Favoritism\n\nIn Genesis 25:26-34, the Bible records that Jacob capitalized on his twin brother Esau’s impulsiveness and cleverly manipulated his brother to promise away his “special legal standing” (called his “birthright”) in exchange for some stew. Dropped into the text of that story, one verse announced a glaring problem of the pattern in the home that we need to spot in verse 28:\n\nGenesis 25:28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.\n\nDo you see it? It looks like Jacob had a passive dad who focused on “what he liked” in meat, and was hard to get attention from if you weren’t a skilled hunter like Jake’s brother. Isaac had a favorite and Jake wasn’t it.\n\nDon’t overlook the fact that the Bible made clear Isaac loved Esau for “what his child did for him.”\n\nNow consider that Jake had a brother that was impulsive, driven by his immediate desires (something that seems to have been learned from his dad). Now add the third ingredient: Jake was raised by a manipulative mom who had a special love for him. She knew he was the promised future leader and she knew her husband didn’t have the same warmth for him that she felt.\n\nEveryone wants to believe their momma loves them, but this picture is one of favoritism by both parents… Let’s assume that Rebekah told Jake what God told her about the younger son (him) ending up over the older son (Esau). In an environment where manipulation is rampant, can’t you see how easy it would be to convince yourself that working to bring about what God promised was no vice?\n\nNow skip a stone across Genesis 26 for a moment.\n\nThe two big stories of chapter 26 show examples of God’s inordinate blessing on Isaac. A famine came, but God took care of him because of His previous promises to Abraham. Isaac lied to Abimelech (a local ruler) but God looked out for him (26:10) and multiplied his crops one hundredfold (25:12) – not because of his wrong behavior; but in spite of it.\n\nPattern Two: Inordinate Prosperity in Spite of Actions\n\nGenesis 26 showed that Isaac’s wealth was significant, God-given and undeserved. Jake’s manipulation tendencies, as well as those of his mom, would only get stronger in the face of a huge windfall of cash. Ask any lottery winner or inheritance recipient who ever had manipulative relatives how they “upped their game” after the cash showed up.\n\nJake and Esau’s inheritance left them with a huge pile of cash and prizes. That brings us to the moment in the series where Jake’s mask fell completely off and his manipulations became crystal clear in Genesis 27.\n\nPerpetrating Fraud by a the bedside of an elderly father (Genesis 27)\n\nAs we get to the center of this lesson, let’s remember that you and I got more from our parents and our home than the size of our nose and color of our hair. We got character stamps on our heart and ways of dealing with relationships. For many of us, our core values were established in our lives by our family before we were ever conscious of what was happening. These core values, character stamps and relationship coping mechanisms create the “default setting” in our lives – and take the place of grabbing God’s hand…\n\nIt is easy for any of us to fall back on “learned patterns” over the\n\n“pulling” of our Heavenly Father.\n\nManipulators like Jake learned early not to trust God and grab His hand. They learned to get what they wanted through clever trickery. Life was a peach, to be plucked by one who was clever enough to see it.\n\nGenesis 27 opened with Isaac, now old, stuck on a bed in the tent where the pattern he modeled in his home now reigned supreme.\n\nIsaac was on his cot – now old and unable to see. Like many a dad, he taught at least one of his boys the value of work and productivity. He called to Esau. The text recorded:\n\nGenesis 27:1 Now it came about, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” 2 Isaac said, “Behold now, I am old and I do not know the day of my death. 3 “Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me; 4 and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die.”\n\nHad the birthright not been traded, it wouldn’t have been wrong for Isaac to make a request of his first born, Esau. Yet, it seems he was ignoring the fact that Jacob now held the birthright, because Isaac had a favorite. Don’t forget the verse:\n\nGenesis 25:28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.\n\nMom and dad each had their FAVORITE – setting up a struggle in their home for the future. Dad chose his favorite based on PRODUCTIVITY (stuff that Esau could do) and mom based her favoritism on RELATIONSHIP and COMMUNICATION at home. These are age old patterns.\n\n• Dads, we cannot measure our sons by their pitching ability or their accomplishments on the shop floor. They are our sons when they are lazy and discouraged and equally our sons when they are productive. I cannot say it strongly enough: Sons are desperate to hear dad say he loves them.\n\n• Moms, even the boy that barely speaks coherently is still your son. They need the tenderness and care in more subtle ways perhaps, but they still need it. Don’t overestimate the ability to “schmooze” – it may not be authentic expression.\n\nBased on the few pieces of information we have, the passage seems to indicate that either Rebekah and Jacob knew that Isaac didn’t agree with Esau’s word to trade away his birthright, or they all kept him in the dark regarding the whole affair. Either would have been completely wrong. Keep reading:\n\nGenesis 27:5 Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring home, 6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying, 7 ‘Bring me some game and prepare a savory dish for me, that I may eat, and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.’”\n\nRather than dealing directly with her husband, Rebekah learned to eavesdrop and plot. Don’t miss that none of that lesson was lost on Jake, either. He observed that in order to get ahead, one must cheat, lie and use deception.\n\nIf you are familiar with the story, you know that Rebekah sets up the plot to trick her aged husband in Genesis 27:8-10. She cooks the meal that would satisfy him and even provides a costume for Jake to feel like Esau in Genesis 27:11-15. Genesis reminds us this way:\n\nGenesis 27:16 And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 17 She also gave the savory food and the bread, which she had made, to her son Jacob.\n\nConsider mom’s cunning nature – she watched for opportunities to get what she truly wanted.\n\nThink about her demanding nature – she didn’t act as though she truly cared if her son shared her hunger for control or her value system. She was going to force him to do what was best for him even if her husband couldn’t see it, and even if HE couldn’t see it! The words echo from Genesis 27:8:\n\n“Now therefore, my son, listen to me as I command you,” and later… 27:13 But his mother said to him, “Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.”\n\nBoth statements reveal a woman that had her mind made up. A demanding nature is tied to EGO – the idea that only I know what is best.\n\nConsider her manipulative nature – she blatantly used her husband’s obvious weaknesses. Instead of guarding him in love, she was looking PAST his life and getting her son set up. She was using a WRONG MEAT (Genesis 27:9) and working on the trick with the skins and hair.\n\nI can’t help but note that Rebekah didn’t seem to recognize that dragging a curse upon herself was no light matter. She wanted what she wanted so much that she didn’t believe the plan could go wrong.\n\nJails are filled with criminals that have the same idea!\n\nShe completely lacked boundaries – she raided Esau’s clothing at will – simply to have her plan work. Did she not believe that he would hear how the plan came together?\n\nI suspect that there was much more to her helpin her son. She may have been unaware of it, but her zeal was likely FED BY HURT. Genesis 26 includes a mere sentence that tips off the whole problem:\n\nGenesis 26:34 When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite; 35 and they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah.\n\nDo you see it? It looks like MOM was not happy with the daughters-in-law. She wasn’t unfounded in her complaints that Esau married local girls and that was NOT in accord with God’s stated words. Often trouble starts when a child disobeys God’s Word and marries one outside the limits of God’s Word.\n\nWe (parents) can see it, and they (children) don’t want to. We have tears and disappointment, but we don’t know what to do about it – they married them! We STEW (Esau pun intended) and when it comes out – how RASH we can be!\n\nLet’s dive to the big truth here. The default setting in your relationship pattern may be to hide the truth, to fail to communicate, or to out and out lie to get your own way. You must face the wrong patterns you were brought up with. They aren’t the true hand of your real dad.\n\nEarly learned behavioral patterns picked up in a fallen world often don’t reveal our Heavenly Father’s ways. – That is important to remember.\n\nYou and I must STOP COPING with poor relationships and start SURRENDERING paths to the Lord for a complete overhaul.\n\nJacob believed that trickery in the service of self was no vice. If he was more clever than his dumb and dirty brother, that was Esau’s problem. Then it progressed as he grew older….If he was slicker than his sick dad could catch – no matter.\n\nJacob learned to fake WHO he was, and even what RELATIONSHIP HE HAD WITH GOD in order to get what he wanted. It was Jacob who openly used “God words:”\n\nGenesis 27:20 Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the LORD your God caused it to happen to me.”\n\nJacob lacked the normal bond to his father, because he had an inordinate one with his mother. His mom felt no need to protect her ailing husband, and Jacob had no repulsion at tricking his father.\n\nJacob had no reflex reaction to breaking God’s Word. He was not going to honor BOTH his father and mother. The ship had long ago sailed on coveting. Now he could LIE and STEAL his brother’s blessing – justifying it against his brother’s stupidity.\n\nThis wasn’t simply “finder’s keepers” – this was IDENTITY THEFT. Yet, Jacob had been building what police call a “rap sheet” (list of crimes) for a long time!\n\nMake no mistake about it; all of us must learn to carefully examine the “default pattern settings” in our life – many of which were adopted from our family behaviors and relationships. We have to look at our attitudes, our attachments, our way of behaving in relationships, our authenticity – and move from DEFAULT setting to RESET BY FACTORY.\n\nWe must not grab the pattern instead of our Father.\n\nReal safety comes from grabbing the right hand and letting your true Father guide you.\n\nThe story is told that in 2007, a small ship left the harbor in Nova Scotia with two adults and two children. A series of failures on board the vessel, as well as horrid storms that crashed into the eastern US and Canada effectively made their return to land impossible. Blown about in the night, the small vessel had lost lights, sails, engines and its guidance radar. She was being hurled about by waves, with little hope to protect the small family that huddled below deck as the waves crashed around them. Mom and dad were clutching tightly to both of their young children. There was little else they could do. The series of terrible events that led them to this point was now irrelevant. All that was left to do was hold each other, pray, sing and hope that God would deliver them. It would take a miracle. Thankfully, they served One Who traffics regularly in miracles. With no idea where they were for several hours, they were startled when they heard a pounding on the hull of the small ship. Dad went topside and was shocked at what he saw. Nothing could have prepared him for this! Apparently, the waves had pushed them through the storm right back into the inlet, and now that tiny vessel was knocking against the dock from which they had departed the day before. How can this be? They had no steering. They had no way of knowing which way to go even if they had. What they had, was a complete dependence on their Father in Heaven. They held tightly to Him, because He was all they had left. When things seemed most out of their control, they remembered to intentionally put them all in His control. The truth is, that is where they always were. Pulling the rope onto a pole on the dock, they plucked the children from the deck and came into the boathouse feeling as though God just set them down gently after a horrible fright. They were safe because they were where He wanted them to be.\n\nAre you? Onto what are YOU grasping tightly?\n\nDid you ever take a short cut that ended in a mess? We all love shortcuts, because they make us feel like we are clever. The problem is the fastest way to do something isn’t always the best way to do it. Ask anyone who works at a barbecue stand and they will tell you that grilling hamburgers on the hottest setting won’t get burgers on the table more quickly; the practice will simply burn the meat into inedible hockey pucks. And while taking the shortcut under the rail overpass might work in your car, you shouldn’t try it with your tractor trailer (show picture of trailer stuck under bridge overpass).\n\nAbraham lacked information about something going wrong in his life. We know he was anxious about it, because the record we read in the last lesson reminds us:\n\nGenesis 15:3 And Abram said, “Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir.” 4 Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.” 5 And He took him outside and said, “Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” 6 Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.\n\nHe believed God’s promise, but didn’t see God’s results. What to do? He decided to take the PART of the promise he understood and fill in the other part. What should he have done?\n\nKey Principle: To avoid painful results, seek more information from God about your problem.\n\nThe apparent problem: God hadn’t delivered…yet.\n\nGenesis 16:1 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife had borne him no [children]…\n\nThe apparent problem was a lack of child – the real problem was a lack of patience with God. Be aware that many of our problems are actually nothing more than masked impatience. We want comfort, peace and security NOW. If we don’t get it now, we assume God isn’t on duty doing what He has promised.\n\nThe truth is God didn’t promise comfort and He didn’t offer a time table for many things in our life. He offered Himself – and no one in the story seems to be seeking Him!\n\nThe apparent solution: Use the law.\n\nGenesis 16:1b …and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar.\n\nThe apparent solution is to enact the legal mechanism of allowing conception through one in the household under the wife’s command – the real solution was to seek the Lord about the barrenness of the womb.\n\nIn the absence of seeking the Lord, there is always looking to other people. That is why prayer meetings often devolve into discussion groups with a few minutes of complimentary prayer. It is hard to seek the Lord, but easy to seek the counsel of others. Learning to seek Him is a necessary part of the maturing process for any believer.\n\nThe apparent understanding: God left the plan to us.\n\nGenesis 16:2 So Sarai said to Abram, “Now behold, the LORD has prevented me from bearing [children]. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will obtain children through her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 3 After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife. 4 He went in to Hagar, and she conceived…\n\nThe apparent understanding of God’s delay was that He wanted them to figure out another way to get His promise fulfilled – the real understanding should have been as simple as God sending an invitation to ask Him.\n\nLook at the steps:\n\nFirst, Sarai concluded (without asking God) their lack of conception was an intentional work of God designed to force them to step in to fix the situation.\n\nGod’s delay may have had many purposes, but she projected an understanding of God’s plan she didn’t have. Without any idea as to what God was doing, she figured out something that WOULD WORK that didn’t really require God to do anything extraordinary. In her practicality, she delayed the miracle she would experience. Often, when we get really good at finding answers, we get really bad at seeking God.\n\nWhat Sarah proposed was the custom of the day even if it seems strange to us now. Remember, they had short life-spans (comparatively) and high infant mortality and natal mortality rates. Many women died giving birth just as many infants died. Customs were created to compensate. God didn’t cancel them until much later, in 1 Corinthians 7, where polygamy and multiple sexual partners were all forbidden.\n\nSome of you may object to me sounding hard on Sarai. After all, perhaps she thought she was just being practical. A long time passed with no child and neither she nor her husband was getting younger. Why was the short cut a bad idea? Maybe it wasn’t. Without asking God why He was delaying the baby, they would never know.\n\nSecond, Abraham decided Sarai’s idea made sense, so he also sought nothing from the Lord.\n\nGod engaged Abe with promises. He wasn’t silent. Abe knew how to talk to God, but he leaned on the words of Sarai for the method of fulfillment of the words of his God. That is unwise. Sometimes it seems the more we learn to depend on people, the less we really seem to need God. Your pursuit of God needs to be personal. It doesn’t mean you cannot learn from others, it means you cannot substitute what others say for seeking God Himself.\n\nAs much as we desire to teach you to use the Scriptures well, it will take practice.\n\nDid any of you ever have a coach show you how to throw a basketball into the hoop? The positioning of the elbow, the flexing of the wrist, and the gentle release off the finger tips are all part of the proper form. Yet, all the form instruction in the world cannot make up for practicing techniques that will show when the game gets tough.\n\nTo be clear, when we speak of “allowing God to work through us” we do not speak of something passive. It is a practiced proficiency. It is a communication skill initiated intentionally and developed over time and with careful repetition. It is the work of one who would spend much time asking God to direct steps and less time figuring out a way to make broken people behave and broken situations find immediate resolution.\n\nOne of the greatest lies Christians believe is that prayer is what you do when you can’t figure out what else to do.\n\nThat isn’t true at all. Prayer is what you do to allow God to put answers in place when you need them!\n\nIf we retreat to a counselor when we really need to pray, we get the best wisdom of a man or woman – but not necessarily the counsel of the All Knowing One. It doesn’t mean the counselor was deficient. It means God placed the problem in front of us in order that we would seek Him, and we are running from His desire. We have nothing to give God but ourselves – but that is what He seeks. Sometimes intractable problems are nothing less than an invitation of the Almighty to sit and chat for a while.\n\nIf you are honestly encountering this truth and you know that you really want God to just leave you alone and let you do what you want to do – at least be honest with yourself. There is nothing wrong with the teaching – the issues are within you. No amount of Bible reading, Bible instruction or preaching will change that reality. You are wasting your time if you won’t bring your heart to God. You can learn volumes from the Bible and perform a moral service with your daily behavior, but Jesus will still say of you: “This people honors me with their lips, but there heart is far from Me.” Worship beckons us to bow, but only we can choose to hear the call and do it.\n\nThe apparent result: God’s blessed Abraham!?!\n\nIt seemed obvious that God offered a wonderful blessing to Abraham, and certainly any of us would consider a baby a blessing of the Lord no matter HOW it was conceived.\n\nGenesis 16:4b …and when she saw that she had conceived,\n\nEvery child is God’s blessing, not only the ones a settled, stable, married couple conceives. Every child opens a new world of possibilities. Every great invention of mankind began with a baby’s birth. Some of those inventions came from children born into nearly impossible situations.\n\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that God put up fences for a reason. He delayed the baby, not because He forgot about His promise, nor because He lost the formula to create them in the womb – He did it for His own purpose. When we crash through the fences of God, we encounter unintended beasts that live behind those fences.\n\nAbe welcomed Hagar into his bed and some of the results were predictable. The baby was the blessing part of that. At the same time, when Hagar realized she was pregnant, more than just her belly puffed up, so did her head. What Sarai tried to accomplish for a long time took her a mere evening. It may seem funny, but to Hagar, even fertility was a contest. The text went on:\n\nGenesis 16:4b …her mistress was despised in her sight. 5 And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the LORD judge between you and me.\n\nTry as I may, I cannot understand how Sarai turned this into an argument with Abraham! At the risk of sounding obvious, though, I must confess to having a critical flaw – that of being a man.\n\nInstead of pure blessing, what Abe got was a migraine. One gal was pregnant and the other was mad at him. This wasn’t going well at all! Keep reading the story, because it only gets worse.\n\nGenesis 16:6 But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight.” So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.\n\nCan you believe what Abraham did? To make his wife happy, Abe became passive rather than seeking a solution that honored the promised offspring. Don’t forget that! God promised him a child from his loins, and now he had one. If this was the long awaited child that God promised, he had no business treating a gift of God as something less than sacred.\n\nThat is part of the problem with fixing things ourselves.\n\nWhen we don’t seek God about a problem, but rather ingeniously fix it ourselves, we aren’t as certain the “answer” isn’t just something we concocted.\n\nWe can end up missing the greatest part of God’s work because we think we “goofed” and went the wrong way. We won’t be sure. How can we?\n\nThe text followed Hagar into the desert:\n\nGenesis 16:7 Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. 8 He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from and where are you going?” And she said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.” 9 Then the angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority.” 10 Moreover, the angel of the LORD said to her, “I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count.” 11 The angel of the LORD said to her further, “Behold, you are with child, and you will bear a son; and you shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has given heed to your affliction. 12 He will be a wild donkey of a man, his hand [will be] against everyone, and everyone’s hand [will be] against him; and he will live to the east of all his brothers.”\n\nGod interrupted the regularly scheduled program to bring an emergency message to Hagar in order that she treat the baby with special care, and keep the baby with Abraham for his infancy and young life. Without taking every aspect of these verses into consideration, think about the promises.\n\nFirst, she was commanded to return home, no matter the condition of her treatment. She was also told to respect the authority of Sarai in the home. God didn’t just send her back; He commanded change in her.\n\nSecond, she was encouraged with the message that she would bear a son, and from that boy would come a great company of people. She was told to name him “God has heard” to remind the family that God knew what happened in the whole story.\n\nThird, she was promised the boy would be like the desert onacker, a wild donkey of great worth, but difficult to domesticate. Despite the translation of verse twelve, the Hebrew made clear, “His hand would be in everyone’s hand, and everyone’s hand would be in his.” This appears to have been a promise the boy would be deeply tied to the economy of all the other people in the region.\n\nFinally, the end of the story offered the ONLY PERSON in the account who took what God promised back to the feet of the Lord Himself. Hagar was the one person in the story who did the right thing! The text reads:\n\nGenesis 16:13 Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees”; for she said, “Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?” 14 Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. 15 So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.\n\nWhat a scene! Hagar dropped in worship and did what God instructed. What a difference in how the story unfolded if Abraham and Sarah had done so back in verse 2!!! The whole situation came about because of impatience with God’s time table and the feeling that someone needed to “right the wrong” they felt.\n\nHagar knew life would be bearable with the knowledge the Angel of the Lord was watching over her. She called God El Roi, which means: “the God who sees me.” Even a sassy servant who ran away was in His grasp learned God didn’t miss things or mess up things.\n\nWhen we turn to Him and trust Him, the outcome is left in His hands – where it belongs.\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt God may have taken a vacation? Have you wondered why things happened that pummeled your life when (remarkably) it wasn’t your fault? May I remind you that God sees you too! He sees how overwhelmed you are caring for loved ones. He recognizes the challenges you have on your job. He understands how you feel when people treat you badly at school. He feels your pain when loneliness eats away at you. He sees, and He cares. He doesn’t want you to fix the world – He wants you to find Him in the situation.\n\nJames has a reminder for us when we are in this situation:\n\nJames 1:2 Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 4 And let endurance have [its] perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 5 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. 6 But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, 8 [being] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.\n\nDid you notice what James revealed?\n\n• He told us that we WOULD encounter various trials – it wasn’t an IF, but a WHEN. It shouldn’t be a surprise to us that God hasn’t exempted His children from the pains of a fallen world.\n\n• He cautioned us to consider or reckon such times with JOY – the resolute assurance that God has neither lost interest, nor the power to deal with my problems. He doesn’t call you to feign “happiness” but rather to exude JOY. The latter is a confidence in God and His abilities.\n\n• He made clear that trials can “dot the landscape” of our lives. The term “polka dot” comes from the word used of the number of trials. Life can and will occasionally get “bombed” by trials.\n\n• He explained that trials have a purpose – the tempering of the metal of our faith. They are necessary to complete our maturity and readiness of God’s use. To push against the trials is to push against His shaping work.\n\nWhat can we do when we are in the midst of a spattering of troubles?\n\nWe can trust God’s generosity is answering our painful cries. We can call on Him. We can, with confidence in His engagement and His goodness, reach out to Him for clarity in the storm. If we doubt His goodness, we will not recognize His voice. If we disbelieve His power, we won’t grab His hand for rescue.\n\nIn short, to avoid painful results, seek more information from God about your problem.\n\nLook at the situation as an invitation to sit with God. When you do, may I offer three little insights you may want to consider:\n\nFirst, don’t try to figure out God – work at following Him. Your problem isn’t as big as your God. The real issue is you don’t know why He has you where He does. As long as you resist God’s direction, you may get deeper into the problem because you won’t go where He commands. Instead of conditionally following (i.e. “I will do this if you show me what it all means and where it all goes”) – decide that it is HIS WORK to get you safely into His arms. Concentrate on knowing His character as it is revealed in His Word, and work at your attitude of willingness to respond to His command.\n\nSecond, don’t try to work for God – learn to let Him work through you. Again, this isn’t passive. Look closely at the models both in Scripture and in life of people who have learned how to let God work without giving Him advice and trying to push Him around.\n\nThird, don’t try to find the solution to your problem – try to discern His leading in the problem. In the end, since the problem is smaller than God, the real issue isn’t how to solve the situation, it is to understand what God wants you to do or be in that place. Many believers don’t learn what God wanted them to do in troubles, because they are focused on the troubles and not on God’s lesson.\n\nWe live in a great time, we really do. I can walk into a store and purchase a tool to help me complete almost any task. That was true a generation ago. What wasn’t true was the fact that I can now order something I cannot get access to locally and it will be shipped to my door in a few days – in some places it will be flown out on a little drone.\n\nThough we live in a small town, we can have Chinese, Thai, Mexican or Italian food any day of the week. Our supermarkets contain items grown and shipped from around the world, sent fresh to our supermarket chain. We can go a little over an hour away and get on an airplane that is made of four million distinct parts derived from shops in 13 nations and use that assembled aircraft to travel to another continent within the same day. We can get in our car and drive over to the east coast of Florida and watch a satellite get launched into space. Our lives are remarkable!\n\nOne of the things travel can do is allow you to compare how different cultures accomplish tasks and build great edifices. Traveling to Europe, I find the buildings inspiring, but I have to admit that on occasion they have left me feeling a little empty when I compare the works I have seen to the “quick and easy” lifestyle we have developed here. I admit it; the old buildings (like the great cathedrals) make me yearn sometimes for a bit more craftsmanship here at home. All our “instantly ready” microwaved meals and instant fixes to our building project needs leaves me recognizing there really is little emphasis on skilled craftsman and the quality products they crafted for longevity. Our way has advantages, but it also has some real limitations…\n\nI guess as long as I can visit those carefully hand crafted master works it really isn’t that big a deal, but the sense of the instant does take its toll on us. One of the ways is in our theology. In our day, I don’t believe we are set up to understand how God does things – because our lives are focused far more on immediate satisfaction than long term craftsmanship.\n\nIf we want to understand how things are put together, we need to recognize something: God is a Master Craftsman. He operates on a different schedule than we do. His level of exacting detail may appear to be a slow way to respond to things, but He works for eternity and does it “over the long haul.” God, like any skilled craftsman that takes after Him, simply refuses to RUSH. At the same time, what He builds lasts for as many generations as He chooses. In our lesson today from Genesis 15, we will clearly see an encouraging truth…\n\nKey Principle: God may take His time keeping His promises, but we should have confidence in the fact that He always keeps them in every detail.\n\nIf you have been following our lessons through the life of Abraham, you know that chapter 15 unfolded after what happened when he got back from the fight to rescue his nephew Lot. He led a victory charge and brought the people and spoils of war back to Canaan from the raiders that had taken them away to Syria. A victory parade ensued, as did some conversations that seemed as much like high level negotiations as they did a celebration of victory. If you read chapter 14 carefully, there appeared to be some undercurrent tensions with the King of Sodom named Bera but there was welcome praise and encouragement from a priestly leader named Melchizedek. Abraham returned to his tent, cleaned the dust of travel and the blood of the fight from his sandals and got some rest.\n\nAfter some time God showed up again to the Patriarch…\n\nGenesis 15:1 After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; your reward shall be very great.”\n\nPerhaps he was still pondering in his heart the words of King Bera and King Melchizedek from the celebration part of his recent victory, where each spoke to Abraham of reward. Maybe those words got him thinking about God’s blessings and promises. Neither king knew Abe was struggling in his heart with the very issue of reward, because God made a promise, but was slow on delivery.\n\nOver the years, God had appeared to him a number of times. You can trace them in Genesis. I label each of them in my own study to remind me of their major features. Beginning in Genesis 12, trace them with me for a moment. God gave Abraham…\n\n• An “Emptying” Promise: The first meeting was in Genesis 12:1-3, when God told Abram to move out to a country God would show him, and that God would make Abram a blessing to all nations. This set up Abraham’s great “trust exchange” where he was to give up what he knew for what God promised based solely on the Word of God. It was an “emptying promise” because he had to empty his life of his own stuff in order to gain what God wanted him to have.\n\nLater, God appeared again. The next time it was:\n\n• A “Defined” Promise: The second meeting (recorded in 12:7) revealed to Abram that he would receive all the land he could see for his descendants. He wasn’t only going to have a city; he would have a nation. It wouldn’t only be a piece of land for him; it was an inheritance for his many children yet to be born.\n\nGod appeared yet again. This time in another meeting recorded in 13:14, he received…\n\n• An “Extended” Promise: After Abraham separated from Lot and showed incredible generosity, God promised Abraham the land allotment would be forever his for his family. That promise implied that his family would never be wiped out in war, and made plain the perpetual land ownership of that specific inheritance on the ground as God revealed to him earlier.\n\nAfterward, God appeared again for a fourth meeting. In it, He offered Abraham what I call…\n\n• A “Specified” Promise: God offered an additional promise to Abe: Your household will have great reward. Abram asked “How?” God replied, “Your seed will be many, and come from YOU!”\n\nGo back to Genesis 15:2. Listen to Abe’s heart, as he pleads a case before a “Master Craftsman God.” Nothing appears to be happening in the baby department. Time is passing and he isn’t getting any younger, and neither is his wife. The fact remained that he had a promise of God, but no delivery on that promise yet. The “Master Craftsman of Heaven” was at work, meticulously designing the fulfillment to His promise. Abraham had to learn that God is an artist that doesn’t over promise. In His time, what He delivers is beyond anything we could imagine.\n\nI suspect after the rush of the victory and the thrill of the homecoming parade were over, Abe found himself wondering about God’s earlier promises. The public affirmation brought to the surface a deep gnawing inside: He wanted God to make good on His powerful promises.\n\nIn many ways, his feeling matched the record of Zacharias in Luke 1, who had a similar and familiar story. Decades passed and Zach and Liz didn’t have the baby they longed for, just like Abe and Sarah many generations before.\n\nThe factor that was most bothersome to both of those Biblical families is this: God took His time delivering the answer to their deepest longings. Let that sink in… God isn’t in a hurry in your circumstance, but He will keep every promise He has made.\n\nLook at Genesis 15 again as Abe openly revealed his angst:\n\nGenesis 15:2 Abram said, “O Lord God, what will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” 3 And Abram said, “Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir.”\n\nThere it is! Abe placed the pain of his impatience out in the open before God. He believed that God would keep His Word, but Abe wasn’t sure he understood how. Even more, I think there is reason to believe Abe wasn’t certain God understood how he felt about the slowly fulfilled promise. Remember, Abe didn’t have the benefit of a complete Bible to really understand God as He later revealed Himself.\n\nThe Patriarch’s words were few. He made clear that God had given him a great household, but no offspring from his loins. He made clear that he was preparing a servant to be his heir. God patiently listened and replied. “Nice plan, Abe. Wrong answer, but nice plan…”\n\nThe conversation is one of the most intimate displays of a caring God in the whole Bible. God reached deeply into Abe’s heart and gave him the promises he needed to pick up the shield of God and walk through life with it.\n\nGenesis recorded:\n\nGenesis 15:4 Then behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.” 5 And He took him outside and said, “Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”\n\n• God told him Eliezer of Damascus would not and should not be his heir, but he would rather come from his own loins (Genesis 15:4). It is worth mentioning this wasn’t the only time Abe would take the promises of God, see a gap in them, and make his own plan to fill in the blank spaces. It was a reasonable thing to do, but it wasn’t the way the Master Craftsman wanted the thing built. Craftsmen often don’t work for efficiency as much as eloquence in the build. Long after the “need” was met, we see that God’s way of meeting it took care of issues we never anticipated at the time. We are anxious, but God is incredibly thorough!\n\n• God offered an object lesson in the stars and told him clearly his house would be great in number (Genesis 15:5). The stars weren’t only many in numbers, but diverse in appearance and beautiful to behold. Abe didn’t miss the lesson.\n\nPresented with the knowledge that God had a plan to build a huge household for and from Abe, the Patriarch bowed before God in recognition that he truly believed what he heard.\n\nThe text revealed:\n\nGenesis 15:6 Then he believed in the Lord; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.\n\nThe term “believed” (awman) was a form of the word that came from the building trade. It appears to have originally meant “to build upon” or “to set to give stability.” It is a foundational term sometimes used of doorposts. Abraham’s belief in what God said showed when he built his life upon it. That single act was counted as righteousness, and the record of it echoes throughout Scripture…\n\nAs we have studied together, it is clear God had his hand on Abraham’s life for a long time before this event, but something dramatic happened at this point in the narrative. This wasn’t the first encounter with God, but something was different this time. God saw something in Abraham’s heart, and Abraham saw something in God’s heart. Hebrew writers of old recalled Abraham’s choice in places like Nehemiah 9:8 and Psalm 106:31.\n\nIn the New Testament, the event was seen as pivotal and gained much attention. We can see this in Romans 4, where Paul built his argument on that act. Paul’s argument with those in Rome was essentially this:\n\nThe temple authorities are claiming you need to enlist in the Atonement Law of Sacrifice even if you have a walk with Jesus. They claim the actions of the Law are what make God satisfied concerning your sin. Yet, Abraham’s story runs contrary to their assertion:\n\n• He is our fleshly father; we are his heirs (4:1).\n\n• He wasn’t made complete in his walk with God by things he did, but by his personal belief in what God said (4:2-5).\n\nPaul remarked:\n\nRomans 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? “ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.” 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness…\n\nPaul pressed the idea that circumcision (as entry eligibility for participation in the atonement sacrificial system) wasn’t a part of the satisfaction of God in Abraham – only his belief was required.\n\nHe asked:\n\nRomans 4:9 Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say, “FAITH WAS CREDITED TO ABRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.” 10 How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised; 11and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, 12 and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.\n\nWe see another version of that argument again in Galatians 3:6, where Paul again pressed the importance of Abraham’s belief as the point God accepted him.\n\nGalatians 3:6 Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. 7 Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. 8 The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, [saying], “ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU.” 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.\n\nBe careful not to misread that. Paul wasn’t saying that people who believe replace Israel as the sons of Abraham. In chapter 10 and 11 he will make the point there is a future for the physical children of Abraham. Here he adds people who have faith in Jesus to the blessed children of Abraham, in the sense that we have one heritage found in God. What is crystal clear is the notion that a man or woman can be made right with God by faith alone. The atonement once required has been fully replaced in Messiah by justification.\n\nThe key point from Paul’s teaching of the Gospel concerning Abraham was this: Though the atonement system (the offering of sacrifices in the tabernacle and later the temple made accessible to the circumcised) was necessary for a time, it wasn’t the ONLY way God ever worked. In fact, it wasn’t the basis of God’s acceptance. It was built UPON something more basic: belief. Lots of good animals died in the temple without effect if the person offering them didn’t believe.\n\nThe eternal formula fo"
