        "text": "Jeff Jarrett promises “off the chart” matches and “fan friendly” interaction when the superstars of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling roll into Kent Friday night.\n\nJarrett knows the pro wrestling business well. He founded TNA Wrestling with his father Jerry Jarrett in 2002. Jeff Jarrett is vice president of the company and also a multi-time world heavyweight champion. He is part of the wrestling lineup at the ShoWare Center.\n\n“We are fan friendly and the most fan interactive in the world,” said Jarrett during a phone interview Tuesday from his office in Nashville, Tenn. “From the minute the doors open at 6:30 to when the last fan leaves there will be opportunities for autographs and pictures.”\n\nThat includes a meet and greet with wrestlers during the intermission as well as a chance to get your photo taken in the ring at the end of the night.\n\n“Fans want to be a part of it,” Jarrett said. “It’s not come out and just watch. You soon realize at an event that it’s not just another wrestling show.”\n\nTNA Wrestling has grown in popularity through its “TNA iMPACT” show Thursday nights on Spike television. TNA Wrestling brought its live show to Kent last year and decided to return for a Pacific Northwest tour because of strong television ratings in the area.\n\n“That is a part of the country we do well with our TV ratings,” Jarrett said. “We’re excited to be coming out to Washington and Oregon.”\n\nThe tour stopped Thursday in Wenatchee and heads to Salem, Ore., for a Saturday show.\n\nTNA Wrestling is the second largest wrestling promotion in the world behind its rival, World Wrestling Entertainment. This marks the third year that TNA wrestlers have performed on the road rather than just for television or at certain select sites.\n\nThe main event Friday will feature Jeff Hardy, known as “The Charismatic Enigma,” against Mr. Anderson. Hardy is the current world champion and a high-flying wrestler with a daredevil style. Anderson is considered one of the more obnoxious wrestlers because of his loud mouth but also excels in the ring.\n\nAnother top event features “The Phenomenal” AJ Styles against Matt Hardy, the brother of Jeff Hardy. Styles is a longtime fan favorite with outstanding athletic ability.\n\n“Both of those events will be off the charts,” Jarrett said.\n\nJarrett, known as “King of the Mountain,” will compete in tag team action with Ink, Inc., Beer Money, Inc., and “Big Poppa Pump” Scott Steiner.\n\n“There is something unique about performing at a live event,” Jarrett said. “I have friends who are athletes and singers and actors and they all talk about the rush from performing in front of a live crowd. The energy and electricity in a building from the audience is a great experience.”\n\nTNA Wrestling also features the top women of the sport.\n\nComing to Kent for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship Match are Angelina Love and Winter against Madison Rayne and Sarita.\n\n“Those four girls will tear the house down,” Jarrett said. “It is hard-hitting action and they are very athletic.”\n\nOthers expected to perform include Kazarian versus Brian Kendrick in a TNA X Division Championship Match. About 20 to 25 wrestlers are part of the lineup.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Total Nonstop Action Wrestling\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. March 4\n\nWhere: ShoWare Center, Kent\n\nCost: $52, $37, $22."
