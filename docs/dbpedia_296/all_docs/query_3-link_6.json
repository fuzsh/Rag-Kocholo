        "text": "Puerto Rican professional wrestler\n\nJosé Anibal Laureano Colón (born June 24, 1958) is a Puerto Rican professional wrestler and manager. He is better known by his ring name, Chicky Starr. He is best known for his work in the World Wrestling Council (WWC) and International Wrestling Association (IWA) of Puerto Rico. Starr won the WWC Universal Championship when he defeated Carlito in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico in early 2003. Laureano has led stables including The Chicky Starr Sports Club and the Starr Corporation.\n\nLaureano has managed Abdullah the Butcher, Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody, Ron Starr, Al Perez, Kareem Muhammad, Grizzly Boone, Jason the Terrible, Joe Leduc, Hercules Ayala, \"Sadistic\" Steve Strong, \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Landell, Ronnie Garvin, Harley Race, \"The Raging Bull\" Manny Fernández, Leo Burke, The Sheepherders, The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika), The Samoan Swat Team, The Polynesian Prince, The Alaskan Hunters, Korsita Korchenko, Tama the Islander, Dan Kroffat, Scott Hall, Abbuda Dein, The Iron Sheik, Killer Khalifa, Invader #2, Crash the Eliminator, The Skywalker, Huracan Castillo Jr., Victor the Bodyguard, \"Dirty\" Dutch Mantell, Ricky Banderas, Tower of Doom, Shane the Glamour Boy, \"Mr.Ray-tings\" Ray Gonzalez, Steve Corino, \"The Precious One\" Gilbert, Black Pain, The Sons of Samoa, Los Renegados del Infierno, Thunder and Lightning, Mighty Ursus, among others.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly career (1975–1985)\n\n[edit]\n\nStarr formed a tag team with Antonio Pantojas known as the Peron Brothers for Stampede Wrestling in Canada. They wrestled as heels from 1981 to 1982 in Stampede. Starr often wrestled as a mid-card wrestler and in the opening matches at house shows.\n\nFrom 1984 to mid 1985, Starr performed in San Antonio's Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW). On September 9, 1984, he and Brett Sawyer won the SCW Southwest Tag Team Championship from The Fabulous Blonds (Eric Embry and Dan Greer) but dropped the belts back to The Fabulous Blonds on October 9. Starr also won the SCW Southwest Junior Heavyweight Championship from Embry, but later lost it to Ron Sexton.\n\nWWC rebrand (1985–1991, 1995–1997, 1998–2000)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late 1985, Starr appeared in Puerto Rico World Wrestling Council (WWC). He became a villain when he accused his mentor El Invader #1 of holding him back. Starr challenged Invader #1 to a match, during which he attacked his mentor with a steel chair. Starr and Invader #1 feuded from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s. They competed in a \"Retirement vs. Hair\" match won by Invader #1 at the 1987 WWC Anniversary card. This feud ended in 1991 when Starr left the WWC to start a new promotion called the American Wrestling Federation (AWF) with Hercules Ayala, former WWC announcer Hugo Savinovich and Gloria Uribe.\n\nStarr also became a manager and in early 1986, starting a faction initially known as El Club Deportivo (The Sports Club). He recruited Victor Rodriguez as his bodyguard. He also managed his kayfabe cousin Ron Starr. Other members of his group were Abdullah the Butcher, Al Perez, Sadistic Steve Strong, and Manny Fernandez. They feuded with El Invader #1 and Carlos Colon. In 1988, Starr defeated Rufus R. Jones to win the King of Wrestling crown.\n\nThe feud with Invader #1 resumed in 1997 when Starr returned to WWC. He teamed with Invader #2 who had turned against Invader #1 earlier that year. Starr briefly made an alliance with Invader #1 that only lasted a couple of weeks before they started feuding again. The same year, Starr created a new alliance called Starr Corporation with Victor \"the Bodyguard\" Rodriguez and Angel Rodriguez. Starr merged Starr Corporation with Ray Gonzalez's Familia del Milenio in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nStarr Corporation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the International Wrestling Association (IWA), the Starr Corporation was composed of Pain, Víctor \"The Bodyguard\" Rodriguez, Angel Rodriguez, AAA/TNA's \"El Mesias\" Ricky Banderas and Dutch Mantell. They feuded with Savio Vega, Shane The Glamour Boy, Los Malcriaos (Miguel Perez, Jr. and Huracan Castillo, Jr.). Starr and Victor \"The Bodyguard\" Rodriguez also wrestled as a tag team version of Starr Corporation and were IWA World Tag Team Champions. At Juicio Final 2001, Savio Vega (Juan Rivera) as his alternate character of Hombre Dinamita and Chicky Starr faced each other in a match known as the cage of death where the first to reach a set of handcuff keys could release their team to take on the other.[2] Vega's team was composed by Shane Sewell, Apolo (Germán Figueroa), Jesús Castillo and Kane, while he was supported by the Starr Corporation.[2] In March 2001, Lucha Libre 101 tried to join the Starr Corporation, but Starr declined.[2] At Juicio Final 2001, Vega and Castillo won a Double Caribbean Strap Match over Starr and Rodríguez, a contest with traditional strap match rules but in which the adversaries were strapped to each other.[3] In his continued feud, Tiger Ali Singh was brought to take on Vega, but failed.[4] Later in the same event, Vega attacked Starr and Rodríguez, who lost the titles due to the interference.[4] The Starr Corporation exploited differences that were emerging between different members of Los Boricuas to gain the upper hand in the ongoing feud.[5] Resuming the feud between factions, Castillo and Pérez defeated Starr and Faraón Zaruxx.[6] On June 16, 2001, Laureano joined Bouncer Bruno in an unsuccessful challenge for the Tag Team Championship.[7] On the same night, the Starr Corporation turned on Banderas after he was involved in a confrontation with the other members.[7] On August 4, 2001, Starr announced that he was firing all but one member of the Starr Corporation, being upset that Víctor Rodríguez had turned face on the group to save Banderas and lost a retirement afterwards.[8] However, this was sorely received by the other members of the stable, who adopted Angel Rodríguez as their new leader and attacked him.[8] They continued ambushing Starr during the following weeks.[9] After defeating a tag team known as Los Gringos (Dlo Brown and Chaz) and forcing one of them to leave IWA-PR, Apolo and Sewell were attacked by the Starr Corporation. Starr made the save, creating a new alliance.[9] At Rumble Boricua, Laureano defeated Angel Rodríguez.[10]\n\nUniversal Heavyweight Champion\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 28, 2002, Laureano appeared in WWC's Aniversario 2002 and interfered in a match between Carly Colón and Konnan. WWC Continued promoting its product in Televicentro's programming, this time as part of a multi-program collaboration that began with segments in a show named Zumbate where a hidden camera prank was played on Laureano.[11] The angle was continued at SuperXclusivo, where Colón and Santarosa reached a truce of sorts, but Laureano interrupted and argued with both.[11] A wrestling special was then aired in Zúmbate, where several members of the roster performed.[11] In the same program, three masked wrestlers that were supposedly randomly recruited were revealed to be Santarrosa, Carly and Eddie Colón, which led to Laureano attacking all three.[11] On November 9, 2002, the Starr Corporation assaulted Eddie Colón. On November 14, 2002, Laureano participated in another Televicentro show, this time Club Sunshine where he confronted Sunshine Logrono while the latter was performing under the wrestling-related character of Vitin Alicea. On November 30, Laureano wrestled Colón, who attacked him until he was left bleeding.[12] In May 2003, it was reported that Laureano would be joining a new independent promotion, New Wrestling Nation, in the role of trainer.[13][14] However, the plans with the company were suddenly abandoned following an apparent failure in communication between its owner and Hugo Savinovich.[15] After a prolonged hiatus, Laureano was scheduled for an event held by independent promotion New Generation Wrestling.[16] In the event, named Maldicion Chickystarriana in his honor, he was supposed to join Hamed Martinez (who had been wrestling a character that was a homage to him, named El Chickystarriano) to wrestle in a no disqualification match. However, the event was later cancelled.[17] On July 12, 2003, WWC announced the return of Laureano to the promotion during the upcoming Aniversario event, following a week of negotiations where an undisclosed amount of money that was owed to him was paid.[18] In his return, he wrestled Ricky Santana to a double disqualification.[19] Laureano also managed Mike Awesome in his unsuccessful bid to defeat Carly Colón.[20] He then got disqualified un unsuccessful bid for the Television Championship, by hitting his opponent with a bat.[21]\n\nWWC ownership\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the same event, Laureano attacked Carlos Colón but was stopped, being then confronted by the storyline co-owner of WWC, Ramón Álvarez, who ordered him retire the latter or be fired from the promotion citing that he disliked being bossed but had no option. Laureano unsuccessfully challenged Colón and was once again confronted by Álvarez, who asked if he was wearing a t-shirt with the Dominican flag that he was given.[22] Despite responding in the affirmative, he the revealed a shirt with the flag of Puerto Rico in a sudden face turn, only to be attacked by the entire heel stable. Laureano then interfered in a fire match between the two storyline co-owners, attacking Álvarez with a torch and telling Jovica that he was interested in his rival's half of the stocks.[23] In his return to the ring, he defeated Diamante Dominicano by disqualification.[24] On September 6, 2003, Laureano defeated Álvarez with the help of Logrono to win 50% of WWC's stocks.[25] Both met again in a match that ended with no winner due to the intervention of the heel stable.[26] On September 20, 2003, the Broncos ambushed him and his wife while they were entering a WWC card.[27] In October, WWC began airing segments where Laureano talked to someone by phone and requested his help as a bodyguard, implying that he was contacting Víctor Rodríguez.[28] However, it was later revealed that it was Milton Adorno in his return to the promotion. This alliance was short lived, since the latter left WWC two weeks later.[29] On October 25, 2003, Laureano defeated Álvarez and Estrada by disqualification and revealed the new member of the Starr Corporation, Wilfredo Alejandro.[30] However, like his previous associate this wrestler left the promotion shortly afterwards.[29] Individually, his matches with Álvarez ended without a clear winner.[31] This led to a match where a bat was placed 15 feet above the ring, which Álvarez won.[32] Afterwards, Laureano left the promotion suddenly.\n\nVarious promotions\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring this period of inactivity, he was the first guest in professional wrestling radio show, Desde la Tercera Cuerda.

Laureano has often recognized them publicly and refers to the group as “pioneers” and his “children”.[307] The group was created by several alumni of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez and at its height had members in countries such as Brazil, Iraq, Argentina and Afghanistan.[308]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe phrase “estás bregando Chicky Estar…”, first coined by WWC color commentator Joaquín Padín following Laureano's first heel turn, gained traction among the general population.[308] The idiom became synonymous with betrayal, treason, untrustworthiness and cheating.[308] The phrase has remained relevant for more than 40 years and morphed into memes with the advent of the internet era.[304]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen he was a child, his nickname was “Chiquitín”, which later evolved into “Chicky”.[305] In 1982, he incorporated this into his ring name, feeling that his real name was not interesting, and added a variant of the word “star” to differentiate it.[305] In college, Laureano earned an associate degree in criminal justice and also studied pharmacy.[309]\n\nRelationships\n\n[edit]\n\nLaureano has been married to Julia Candelas and Leslie Santiago (m. 2018), he is the father of several children, with the eldest being Joseph.
