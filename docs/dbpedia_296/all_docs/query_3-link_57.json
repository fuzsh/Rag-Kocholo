        "text": "Wednesday, May 24, 2017\n\nPVDFest Expands for Third Installment of Providence’s Signature Arts Festival\n\nToday, Mayor Jorge O. Elorza and Founding Partner FirstWorks announced details and schedule highlights of PVDFest set for June 1-4, 2017, with showcase performances on June 3. In this third annual event, art, culture, and cuisine transform Providence with over 800 artists, 15 stages, 30 food vendors, 11 local art organizations and more. Building off of Mayor Elorza’s vision, the festival is made possible by the generous support of over 60 sponsors. The City and FirstWorks are collaborating with 13 curators, including AS220, The Dean Hotel, The Downtown Providence Parks Conservancy, as well as community partners from throughout Providence, to deliver unforgettable PVDFest programming.\n\n“PVDFest has grown so much since the first installation,” said Mayor Jorge Elorza. “This year’s festival builds upon the momentum and energy of the past years while incorporating even more of what makes Providence the Creative Capital. From the new ‘ideas’ conference to the off-the-wall programming in the plaza, PVDFest has something for artists of all mediums. Visitors and residents are sure to be amazed by the talent and creativity this year’s festival will offer.”\n\nSaturday, June 3rd, will showcase an incredible mix of local, national and international acts–from Woonsocket to Westerly and with artists from Trinidad, Honduras, Venezuela, Miami, Los Angeles, Oakland, and Montreal.\n\n“PVDFest kicks off in an entirely new way – drawing thought pioneers to Providence and signaling the start of new conversations,” said Kathleen Pletcher, Executive Artistic Director of FirstWorks. “The premiere of BANDALOOP’s ‘#PVDPublicCanvas’ brings aerial dance artistry together with spoken word for two spectacular evenings, unveiling one of the most significant “first works” PVDFest has seen to date! The pulsing energy of downtown festivities is capped by a Sunday celebration of the vibrant diversity of Providence and the rich cultures of the neighborhoods nearby. This is a wildly inventive festival for our amazing audiences who are eager to discover, experience, have fun and celebrate The Creative Capital.”\n\nPVDFest: Day 1\n\nThe four days of expanded programming will each host a different celebration each day creating a unique PVDFest experience for every attendee. Thursday, June 1 will kick off with a new conference component, Making a Lively Experiment, in which leading thinkers from Providence and beyond will explore the culture of making and generate ideas about what’s next for the maker movement. Dorothy Jones-Davis, co-founder, and co-producer of the National Maker Faire, will deliver a keynote on ways to create connections between a diversity of makers, leveraging their collective skills to harness solutions for the world’s challenges – grand and small. Although DESIGNxRI will welcome conference attendees to meet and mingle the night before, the conference officially starts at 8:30AM on June 1 at Aurora (276 Westminster Street); a full schedule of events and tickets are available now.\n\nConference attendees and local residents are invited to walk over to the Community Table presented by Community Flavors and Sowing Place partners. Inspired in part by the year-long A La Rhody collaboration of food programming, guests will sit together at a 320-foot table for dinner along Washington Street in Kennedy Plaza. Rhode Island Black Storytellers’ director Valerie Tutson will lead those attending on a journey through cuisine, with dinner provided by The Genesis Center. Tickets are on sale now.\n\nThursday ends with a free nighttime dance party at The Steel Yard, 27 Sims Ave, Providence, an anchor neighborhood cultural institution in the Valley neighborhood. DJ Unkle Thirsty will get you dancing under the evening light in this vibrant industrial arts center.\n\n“We are thrilled to be a part of PVDFest again and showcase the brilliant ingenuity of so many artists and makers. Not only is the Steel Yard’s mobile Blacksmithing trailer returning as part of the RI Mini-Maker Faire, but this year we will bring festival-goers to the Yard for the post-conference dance party,” said Howie Sneider, Executive Director of the Steel Yard. “Huge thanks to the Mayor, the City of Providence and Sponsors for being such great cultural partners!”\n\nPVDFest: Day 2\n\nThe party continues on Friday, June 2 with a night full of cultural programming:\n\n• 5PM-10PM Stop by The Dean Hotel parking lot for the Quarter Moon Market & Super Soul Dance Party hosted by The Dean Hotel and AS220.
