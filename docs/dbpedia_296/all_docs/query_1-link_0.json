        "text": "List of TNA/Impact Wrestling Pay-Per-View events\n\nThis is a list of events held by the American professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on pay-per-view (PPV) and on streaming services.[1]\n\nFrom its inception, TNA's main output was a two-hour weekly program broadcast exclusively on pay-per-view. Their first event was held on June 19, 2002, in Huntsville, Alabama; the last of these shows aired on September 8, 2004. Soon after the launch of its flagship, weekly television program, Impact!, on June 4, 2004, the promotion began producing monthly, live, three-hour pay-per-view events; the first of these events, Victory Road aired on November 7, 2004. These events were initially held at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida.[2]\n\nIn January 2013, TNA's monthly event schedule was revamped to focus on four, quarterly-held, PPV cards (later reduced to two events per year, from 2015 to 2017). In place of monthly events, TNA began producing the TNA One Night Only series of taped specials that aired via pay-per-view providers.[3] These in-turn would be succeeded from 2019 onwards by the TNA+ Monthly Specials, which are directly tied to storylines leading into the promotion's PPV events.[4] In 2024, the promotion began using the term \"Premium Live Event\" to refer to their events airing on PPV and the livestreaming services.\n\nWeekly pay-per-view events (2002–2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nNWA: Total Nonstop Action events\n\n[edit]\n\nEvents promoted when the promotion was known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA:TNA) under the National Wrestling Alliance banner.\n\n2002\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Event Venue Location Main event June 19 Weekly PPV #1 Von Braun Center Huntsville, Alabama 20-man Gauntlet for the Gold for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship[5] June 19\n\n(aired June 26) Weekly PPV #2 Von Braun Center Huntsville, Alabama A.J.
