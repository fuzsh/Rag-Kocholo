        "meta_description": "Total Nonstop Action Wrestling is an American professional wrestling promotion based in Nashville, Tennessee. It is a subsidiary of Canada's Anthem Sports & Entertainment. Founded by Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Jarrett in 2002, following the end of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2001, the promotion was initially known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA) and was affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body. In 2004, the promotion dropped \"NWA\" from its name, becoming Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Despite leaving the NWA's membership, it continued to use the NWA World Heavyweight and Tag Team championships as part of its agreement with the governing body. After the agreement ended in 2007, the company created its own TNA World Heavyweight and TNA World Tag Team championships. The promotion was purchased by Anthem at the beginning of 2017 and, in March of that year, was rebranded to Impact Wrestling after its flagship weekly television series. The promotion returned to the TNA name starting in January 2024.",
