While there were rumors suggesting that Bound For Glory might take place in New York City or even internationally, Detroit ultimately emerged as the chosen city. Last year’s Bound For Glory was held at Cicero Stadium in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nRegarding a future TNA event in the United Kingdom, Fightful reports that 2025 would be the earliest year for such an event."
