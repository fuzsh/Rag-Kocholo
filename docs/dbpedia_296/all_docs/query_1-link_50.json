        "text": "Impact Wrestling made a huge announcement during their Bound For Glory show on Saturday (October 21).\n\nStarting with their Hard To Kill show on January 13, 2024, Impact will return to its original Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling name.\n\nBut why go back to the TNA name over six years after rebranding as Impact?\n\nRelated: Impact Wrestling adds extra date to UK Invasion tour\n\nAnnouncing the name change, Impact Wrestling President Scott D’Amore said: \"We still hear the ‘TNA’ chants wherever we go.\n\n\"Fans have longed for TNA Wrestling, so that’s what we’re bringing back in 2024: TNA Wrestling, we’re back!\"\n\nAlong with returning to the TNA name, company officials have confirmed that the promotion will also have a new look, \"from the entrance ramp to turnbuckles in the ring to larger, more prestigious venues and much, much more.\"\n\nRelated: Impact's Trinity reveals surprising career ambition outside of wrestling\n\nTNA was founded in 2002 and was initially known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action. Right from the beginning the TNA name caused some controversy, due to its similarity with a vulgar expression.\n\nThe self-confessed culprit for the TNA name was, unsurprisingly, Vince Russo, who wanted to give the company an 'edgier' feel.\n\nThe name change to Impact Wrestling, which had been the name of their weekly TV show, came after Anthem Sports & Entertainment purchased a majority stake in the company in 2017.\n\nPW Insider reported that the decision to revert back to the TNA name was due to a number of factors .\n\n\"One, it would 'unite' the fragmented history of the promotion, which at different times was known as TNA, then Global Force Wrestling, then finally Impact Wrestling.\n\nRelated: CM Punk makes surprise appearance at Impact Wrestling show\n\n\"A secondary factor in making the decision was that a number of the company's international partners preferred the TNA name and at times were still using the name internally.\"\n\nDuring the Impact years many fans did still always refer to the company as TNA and nostalgia for the old name has grown in recent years.\n\nBut there is still one big question for old-school TNA fans – when can we expect the return of the six-sided ring?\n\nUK fans can watch Impact Wrestling every Friday at 11pm on DAZN 1.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
