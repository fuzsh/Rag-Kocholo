        "text": "Alex Guo, SPM ’23\n\nI completed my senior Capstone in Spring 2023 with On Location’s event production department as an event production and hospitality intern in Los Angeles, California. My responsibilities were to assist the company’s premium hospitality events in the pre-production, onsite, post-production, and closeout stages. My tasks included contracting with vendors, paying invoices, budget assistance, coding payments, expensing credit card charges, retrieving quotes, building decks and diagrams, researching assets, managing onsite events, and working with clients and vendors.\n\nI worked on parties for the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles at Super Bowl LVII in Glendale, Arizona, as well as events for NCAA March Madness and Final Four across 18 cities. I also worked with two hospitality houses at the 2023 Masters in Augusta, Georgia. Throughout this time, I learned new personal skills and processes to improve my career, such as communication methods, leadership styles, and time management. I also gained industry knowledge in areas such as accounting, event planning, hospitality, sales, and design. While I thoroughly enjoyed this experience, my favorite aspect of the Capstone was the people I got to work with in the office and at the events. The most important takeaway from this experience is that “people make the job.” I intend to prioritize office culture and team environment in my future career plans.\n\nAfter graduation, I joined ESPN at The Walt Disney Company as a Sports Brand Solutions Coordinator, working on the SEC Network properties in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nAlexa Schlitt, SPM ’23\n\nFor my 2023 senior Capstone, I had the privilege of interning remotely for both Burst, the leading user-generated content engagement platform, and The Carnegie Initiative for inclusion and acceptance in hockey, a non-profit named after the legendary hockey player and social justice pioneer, Herb Carnegie.\n\nI worked for both organizations as a business development and research intern, primarily focusing on content creation and engaging storytelling while rotating between a variety of departments and acquiring skills in public relations, communications, marketing, program development and production.\n\nI helped to develop the Herb Carnegie Trailblazer Award Program, honoring the unsung heroes of the hockey world and those who use the sport as a vehicle for change.\n\nAlso, I was honored to work on a documentary titled “Beyond Their Years: The Incredible Legacies of Herb Carnegie and Buck O’Neil,” which tells the story of two men’s parallel lives, and how they were denied from playing in the NHL and Major League Baseball due to the color of their skin. The film also focuses on their induction into their respective halls of fame. I started as the production coordinator and by the end became an associate producer. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was something I never imagined as part of my senior year of college. I traveled to Toronto and Kansas City, writing and directing interviews. I was lucky enough to also attend the 2023 Hockey Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.\n\nI will cherish my senior Capstone experience for the rest of my life. I am forever grateful for those who helped me get there and supported me along the way as I begin my post-graduate career in the sport industry.\n\nFaith Porter, SPM ’23\n\nDuring the Spring 2023 semester, I was fortunate to work remotely at Bowl Season as a digital media intern for my senior Capstone experience. Bowl Season represents the postseason college football bowl games, highlighting the uniqueness of each of the 43 games.\n\nThroughout my internship, I worked closely with Bowl Season Director of Operations Thomas Carracilo on creating and executing new social campaigns that integrated existing partnerships. I was responsible for posting, engaging and interacting on all of Bowl Season’s social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Tik Tok). I spent time creating templates on Canva, conducting research for each campaign, looking at current trends on social media and gathering information for each campaign. Additionally, I was tasked with collecting metrics from previous social campaigns, and analyze the data for a sales deck.\n\nI worked on-site at the Bowl Season Annual Meeting in Nashville, where more than 400 executives, representatives, sponsors and vendors gathered to discuss the upcoming college football postseason. At the annual meeting, I posted live content, reposted user-generated content and captured images for the duration of the meeting.\n\nAt Bowl Season, I learned the value of communication and adaptability. I learned the importance of organizing my work before posting and contacting upper-level executives for social campaigns. I sat in on meetings with sponsors as well as planning sessions for our annual meeting, where I learned what goes on behind the scenes to execute an event of that magnitude.\n\nI am grateful to have interned at Bowl Season as I was pushed to think outside the box creatively, trusted with projects and allowed to demonstrate the skills I learned in the Syracuse University classroom before taking on the role.\n\nKevin Donoghue, SPM ’23\n\nDuring the Fall 2022 semester, I had the privilege of completing my senior Capstone with the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nThe GAA is an Irish international amateur sporting and cultural organization focused primarily on promoting indigenous Gaelic games and pastimes, which include the traditional Irish sports of hurling, camogie, Gaelic football, Gaelic handball, and rounders.\n\nI worked under the supervision of Strategy, Insights, and Innovation Manager Peter Horgan within the Coaching and Games Development department. As a research support intern, my duties largely pertained to the development of various research studies relating to Gaelic games.\n\nI helped manage the Gaelic Games Youth Participation Study, which drew upon the experiences of young participants in Gaelic games; and the Inactive Gaelic Games Coaches Study, investigating reasons for why coaches choose to step away from their roles. Through these reports, I provided the GAA with potential solutions and implementation recommendations for problems raised through study results.\n\nApart from research, I gained experience in social media management via the GAA Learning Twitter account. I also gained sports public communications insight by attending and assisting in the operations of Croke Park gamedays.\n\nI will be forever grateful for this tremendous opportunity that allowed me to gain hands-on experience in the European sports landscape. I am excited to take what I have learned with me into the future as I continue to make my mark in the sports industry.\n\nRyan Charles, SPM ’22\n\nI was privileged to work remotely as a sponsorship and marketing intern for Bowl Season during the Spring 2022 semester. Bowl Season is the overarching brand of college football’s postseason, including 44 bowl games and the College Football Playoff.\n\nI worked closely with the Director of Sponsorships, John Egan, with a goal of prospecting, selling and activating Bowl Season’s sponsorships. A lot of my time was spent in client-facing work, where I researched and contacted prospective companies in an effort to bring in sponsorship revenue. I also created sales decks, attended sales calls, wrote contracts, and brought client activations to life.\n\nThe highlight of my Capstone was planning and attending Bowl Season’s Annual Meeting, which drew more than 200 people and featured a 54-booth tradeshow. I played a vital role in the coordination of the tradeshow with sponsors, and the execution of various on-site activations.\n\nI learned a lot during my Capstone, such as the value of time management and the importance of being organized. My biggest lesson was in professionalism. Within my first two months at Bowl Season, I was meeting with and emailing upper-level management executives. I had to learn how to conduct myself in that environment as I strive to be on that level one day in my career.\n\nI’m proud to say that my hard work at Bowl Season and Syracuse University helped me land a full-time position as a Partnership Marketing Coordinator at WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment).\n\nCaroline Dorfman, SPM ’22\n\nDuring my Fall 2021 semester, I completed my senior Capstone experience virtually with Thuzio as an events intern. As a premium influencer events and experiences company, Thuzio provides access to the greatest stories in sports, entertainment, culinary, and business with exclusive interviews with the legends who lived them.\n\nAs an events intern, I completed a plethora of tasks to strengthen Thuzio’s events, including virtual and live event production, talent sourcing and contracting, media database management and so much more. A highlight of my Capstone experience was receiving an event scope from a client, and building proposal decks based on their request. These proposal decks contained various venue options, including price, capacity, location, availability, and a description of the experience. I loved being able to see the client’s vision and bringing it to life for them.\n\nI also was fortunate to learn the production side of Thuzio’s Member Events. I had a goal to attend as many Thuzio events as possible, wanting to contribute to and experience as much of the Thuzio product as I could. These events included Thomas Jones, Kirk Herbstreit Book Event, Chef Eduardo Garcia, Guy Fieri, ByHeart Feed Fest, Leland Melvin, Keren Elazari, and Amanda Freitag.\n\nI will be forever grateful for my time at Thuzio as it helped me grow personally and professionally, while gaining real-world industry experience to build my network within the sports industry, and showcase my passion for events.\n\nConnor Howard, SPM ’22\n\nDuring the Spring 2022 semester, I was privileged to complete my senior Capstone with NASCAR in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nMy work was within NASCAR’s Southeast Region, which oversees all events at Daytona International Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Homestead-Miami Speedway. Events included the Daytona 500; Geico 500; “BEEF. It’s What’s For Dinner. 300;” Rolex 24; Bike Week; and AMA Supercross Championship.\n\nWorking as a client services intern, I managed my own book of business, servicing partnerships and corporate hospitality. Activating some of the races’ largest partnerships, I fulfilled orders for all assets, managed signage, and provided solutions to problems that arose. I also assisted with prospecting, grassroots marketing, and executing fan experiences.\n\nI learned how partnerships are executed from start to finish, how to manage partners and how to create an enjoyable guest experience for fans. I am proud of my work, which saw success in the forms of retaining partners and executing memorable fan experiences for sold-out races.\n\nI am extremely thankful to have completed my Capstone with NASCAR, as it allowed me to gain real-world experience and learn more about the industry. This experience allowed me to transition into a full-time role with NASCAR’s Partnership Strategy Department.\n\nMegan Monzo, SPM ’22\n\nI completed my Senior Capstone with the PGA Tour at TPC Sawgrass during the Spring 2022 semester.\n\nTPC Sawgrass is home to the PLAYERS Championship and is located in beautiful Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. I served as an intern with numerous departments throughout the duration of my Capstone and worked in multiple areas, including merchandise, membership, marketing, social media and PGA Junior League.\n\nDuring the PLAYERS Championship, I worked in the main fan shop and ran the TPC Sawgrass Instagram. It was quite the experience and one I will never forget. I also worked at the Tim Tebow Charity Golf Classic and marketed the PGA Tour through national campaigns. I am fortunate to work in an environment where I am constantly on the go and meeting notable people from around the world.\n\nEvery day working for TPC Sawgrass feels like Disney World! It’s exciting, fast-paced and challenging all at the same time. I am proud that my Capstone experience led to a full-time role with the PGA Tour at TPC Sawgrass as a Membership Services Specialist. My main responsibilities are to run the social media, create advertisements and campaigns for TPC Sawgrass for regional and national audiences, work with members and coach the PGA Junior League. I can’t believe I am working my dream job right after graduation.\n\nI am thankful that Syracuse University’s Department of Sport Management prepared me for this role and I look forward to interacting with Sport Management students who will be searching for a Capstone in the future.\n\nKaris Felton, SPM ’21\n\nIn the Spring 2021 semester, I completed my senior Capstone with Grit Player Services as a Social Media Marketing intern.\n\nGrit Player Services was founded in 2020 by Jake Miller and Syracuse University Sport Management graduate David Jaffin ’18, as a social media agency for athletes. Grit acts as an advocate, providing athletes support in personal brand-building via digital media and business development.\n\nA benefit of completing my Capstone with a start-up company was that I got to experience all aspects of the company. Every day, my tasks were different. I researched influencers, pulled highlights from our clients’ podcasts, and even got to work on the recruiting of future athletes.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, all Grit Player Services employees work virtually, which allowed me to complete my Capstone from SU’s campus. Having a remote Capstone taught me about time management and completing tasks without being monitored. It also introduced me to new ways to connect with team members, including one-on-one calls that took the place of talking with people in person at the office. These calls helped me feel more comfortable during the internship and connecting with my colleagues as more than just a name on a screen.\n\nMy senior Capstone with Grit Player Services taught me so much about working in the sport industry. I am honored to have been offered a part-time position with Grit as a Growth Specialist in their sales department focusing on the recruitment of athletes.\n\nSimone Saputo, SPM ’21\n\nDuring the Spring 2021 semester, I had the opportunity to complete my senior Capstone with the Relevent Sports Group, an organization based out of New York City. Relevent Sports boasts a large array of organizations within its portfolio, including the International Champions Cup (ICC) soccer tournament and LaLiga North America, Spain’s first division of soccer. I worked with the ICC and LaLiga throughout my remote internship.\n\nThroughout this experience, I learned a variety of skills in the Sales and Partnership Department for the ICC and LaLiga North America. I was fortunate to work for two separate organizations, thus gaining insight in two distinct areas within the sports industry.\n\nOver the course of the four months, I assisted with a variety of tasks, including prospecting for potential partners that would align with the organization. I helped to run activations with our existing partners, which included meet-and-greet events with LaLiga players. I oversaw how the event was built and executed. I also worked to maintain Relevent’s relationships with current partners by creating activation ideas that would meet the goals of both organizations. It was fulfilling to see my ideas implemented across a variety of platforms.\n\nSince graduating from Syracuse University in May 2021, I am looking to use the knowledge and experience that I have gained from my courses and internships to work in the sports industry, specifically in the domain of partnerships and marketing.\n\nMatt Diemand, SPM ’21\n\nDuring the Spring 2021 semester, I completed my senior Capstone on location at the Nashville Sports Council and TransPerfect Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nAs an events intern, I helped plan and execute major sporting events in Nashville, highlighted by working in person at the 2021 SEC Men’s Basketball Tournament at Bridgestone Arena.\n\nCOVID-19 had a major impact on my Capstone experience, however, I was lucky enough to move to Nashville in January 2021, and stay through May, working in the office a few days a week.\n\nMany of the Sports Council’s events were canceled or postponed, or had reduced capacity, such as the SEC Basketball Tournament being limited to a 20 percent capacity.\n\nDespite COVID-19 limitations, I learned so much about the inner workings of planning a major sporting event, from volunteer recruitment to creating production schedules to setting up on-site fan engagement and sponsorship activation zones. I gained valuable experience organizing and facilitating a new virtual speaker series and events, including a Zoom speaker series with Vanderbilt kicker Sarah Fuller, SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey, and ESPN’s Holly Rowe.\n\nI assisted the Nashville Sports Council with various assignments, including membership sales and social media postings to engage the Nashville community. My Capstone was truly amazing and allowed me to gain on-site live event experience in a year when so much shifted virtual. This Capstone built upon my event planning and game-day activation skills that I will take with me as I begin my post-graduation career.\n\nSarah Incerpi, SPM ’20\n\nDuring the Fall 2019 semester, I completed my Senior Capstone in Pasadena, CA, with Legends at Rose Bowl Stadium. More specifically, I interned in the Rose Bowl Premium Seating Department as a marketing and sales intern.\n\nI had the privilege of working many events, including a United States Women’s National soccer team’s victory tour match, a Rolling Stones concert, the entire 2019-2020 UCLA football season, and the 2020 Rose Bowl Game. With each event, I was exposed to event preparation and experienced what it took to successfully execute events of this magnitude. I coordinated with many departments, communicated event details with clients, and aimed to make each event an unforgettable experience for all that attended.\n\nAs the internship progressed, I took on more of a marketing role and was responsible for building the communications and marketing calendar while coordinating with the marketing manager. I completed numerous marketing pieces, social media content, and splash pages as well as email newsletters and event invitations.\n\nMy Capstone with Rose Bowl Premium Seating was an incredible journey filled with valuable experiences, life lessons, and unforgettable memories. I can confidently say I learned many skills that I will take with me as I begin my career in the sport industry. I am excited to apply my real-world experiences along with my passion for the world of sports to my career.\n\nAndrew Derda, SPM ’20\n\nDuring the Fall 2019 semester, I completed my Senior Capstone with CSM Sport & Entertainment, a global integrated marketing agency headquartered in London and with offices around the world, including New York City, where I was based.\n\nThe experience provided an amazing opportunity to delve into different aspects of sports and entertainment industries, including sponsorships, event management and gaming.\n\nI was one of two interns in Brand Partnerships responsible for fostering relationships between clients and potential brand partners. A majority of my work focused on managing personal outreach for brands on behalf of CSM clients, such as US Club Soccer, a division of the US Soccer Federation, Harley Davidson and Bit Fry Game Studios. I was responsible for bi-weekly outreach to specific contacts for each of the brands, as well as following up and tracking brand conversations utilizing Salesforce.\n\nI volunteered to work on a project for Chelsea FC, as the soccer club planned its tour of the United States. I used my study abroad experience in London to contribute a unique perspective on how to grow the club’s brand in the United States.\n\nI managed a weekly newsletter sent to CSM employees worldwide, and was responsible for ensuring that a team of interns submitted weekly articles and news briefs.\n\nSince graduating from Syracuse University in May 2020, I have been interviewing with sports marketing agencies and often find myself referencing my CSM Capstone experiences.\n\nKai Ruskin, SPM ’20\n\nDuring the Fall 2019 semester, I completed my senior Capstone with Sporting Kansas City, a Major League Soccer franchise in Kansas City, Missouri. As an intern in the Corporate Partnerships Department, I worked on sales and activations to prospect new partners for the club, as well as manage and execute existing partnership agreements.\n\nI learned and experienced so much during my time with Sporting KC, such as leading projects in partnership recaps, partner briefs, and managing asset inventory. I took detailed notes on our conference calls with AT&T, as well as in-person meetings with John Deere. Outside of the office, I attended and worked multiple activation events with AT&T, including meet and greets with players, and a watch party for the final game of the season.\n\nGamedays were the most exciting aspect of my Capstone experience. Sporting KC has established a passionate and loyal fanbase that makes every game a memorable experience for the team as well as the fans. Interacting with fans in an authentic and unfiltered sports environment is something I will never forget.\n\nSince graduating from Syracuse University in December 2019, I have maintained my Kansas City connections and hope to use this experience to land a corporate partnerships role with a professional sports team or organization.\n\nShanthi Sepe-Chepuru, SPM ’20\n\nDuring the Spring 2020 semester, while I was completing my Senior Capstone as a media relations intern with minor league baseball’s Pensacola (FL) Blue Wahoos, COVID-19 hit, shutting down the sport industry and putting the Wahoos’ season on hold.\n\nThe transition was abrupt. Less than two weeks before, we hosted a college baseball tournament, where I acted as a cameraperson, scoreboard operator and game photographer.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, we had just entered the final stages of our Opening Day preparations. My primary projects were all intended to be finalized by our April 9 opening, including rebuilding and managing the team’s new website and finalizing the production of the team’s 2020 Media Guide. I wrote articles and press releases, attended media events, and assisted in game-day production. We spent months working in earnest toward a finish line that, very suddenly, no longer existed.\n\nAfter COVID-19 suspended the Wahoos’ season and the organization transitioned to working remotely, my role changed significantly for the Double-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. I focused primarily on the website, which had to be entirely rebuilt in a new software. Shortly thereafter, I was offered the opportunity to work remotely on media relations for the Beloit (Wisc.) Snappers, the Class-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. For the remainder of my Spring 2020 Capstone, I rebuilt the Snappers’ website and assisted with graphic design, marketing and social media.\n\nAfter graduating from Syracuse University in May 2020, I transitioned to a remote media relations role with the Snappers, while remaining in Pensacola, Florida. I now manage the Snappers’ social media accounts and website, as well as assist with the marketing for a new stadium and team rebranding.\n\nThis was obviously not the way I envisioned my senior Capstone playing out. I anticipated working closely with the media and players, publishing my first game stories and hopefully seeing the Twins’ top prospects in action. Instead, I spent Opening Day social distancing at home, doing my best to keep the team prepared for the season to start at any moment.\n\nWhile COVID-19 has brought disappointment and heartbreak for so many, the transition taught me the importance of workplace community. I saw first-hand the value of creativity and willingness to think outside the box. I never anticipated working remotely for half of my Capstone and running a media department for a team 1,000 miles away a month after graduation. I will not say it has been easy, but I am grateful for these challenges. I know this entire experience — the planned and the unprecedented — has prepared me for anything the sport industry can throw at me in the future.\n\nMontana Tyrus, SPM ’20\n\nDuring the Fall 2019 semester, I completed my Senior Capstone with Brooklyn Sports and Entertainment (BSE) Global as a team marketing intern for the Long Island Nets, the G-League affiliate of the Brooklyn Nets based in Uniondale, New York.\n\nI experienced the innerworkings of a sports organization and now understand how marketing works with various departments. I helped manage and update the team’s social media accounts, worked the set-up and implementation of community events, and assisted with grassroots marketing efforts, among other tasks.\n\nI worked several events, including media day, local player tryouts, youth basketball clinics, and community events. My favorite part of this Capstone experience was working game days and seeing how all the moving parts, from sales to marketing to sponsorship, came together to create a memorable experience for fans. Even though game days were long, working with incredible staff on Long Island made it memorable!\n\nThis internship with the Nets allowed me to go beyond classroom learning and teach me valuable hands-on experience in the sports industry. It helped me connect and network with industry professionals that I’ve stayed in contact with following my capstone.\n\nSince graduating from Syracuse University in May 2020, I’m proud to say I have returned to BSE Global as an account executive for the Long Island Nets.\n\nDrina Domic, SPM ’19\n\nDuring the Spring 2019 semester, I completed my Senior Capstone in New York City at the National Basketball Association (NBA) League Office in the Team Marketing & Business Operations Department (TMBO).\n\nTMBO works as an in-house consulting group for the NBA, G-League, WNBA, and NBA2K. Within TMBO, I worked with the Strategy and Analytics group as a Business Intelligence Analyst. My group was focused on assisting all facets of the industry, from marketing to ticket sales through data-driven decision making.\n\nMy specific role was to bring league reporting into the 21st Century, to transition away from static PDF reports to more dynamic, real-time dashboards. Having data in real-time with filtering capabilities will enable teams and other groups within TMBO to more easily identify trends and best practices in a more convenient manner. Through this process, I learned how to streamline data and create automated processes. The beauty of TMBO is touching different aspects of the business in a variety of settings.\n\nIt was a great learning opportunity to see how markets operate, whether big or small, winning or losing, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the teams. I consulted with each organization’s Strategy and Analytics team about their needs.\n\nThe most rewarding part of working with the NBA’s TMBO was learning from experts in all areas of sport who come from diverse backgrounds. I am proud to say I have been offered a full-time job with TMBO’s Strategy and Analytics group, effective Summer 2019.\n\nBrianna Cooper, SPM ’19\n\nDuring the Spring 2019 semester, I completed my senior Capstone at Turner Sports with the Advertising Sales and Marketing Department in New York City. This team is responsible for selling and executing all digital, on-air, and on-site sponsorships for all its sports properties.\n\nAs an ad sales intern, I was fortunate to start my Capstone during the peak of March Madness planning. I assisted the NCAA team to complete competitive tracking reports, prospect new clients, and create sales materials. I attended weekly meetings with CBS teams and the annual NCAA, Turner, and CBS meeting, where we developed sponsorship ideas and introduced new clients.\n\nThe title March Madness stood true to its name because during the tournament, I spent long nights at the CBS Broadcast Center tracking in-game sponsorships, capturing digital ad content, and drafting social content for the NCAA’s Final Four Music Series and Fan Fest. By April, I achieved a bucket-list goal by joining Turner’s Final Four team in Minneapolis for six days, running the NCAA social media accounts, and witnessing Virginia’s first-ever championship.\n\nMy internship at Turner gave me a greater appreciation for the business of sports and provided an amazing experience that helped me identify Corporate Partnerships as my career path. It taught me that the importance of sports is in the experiences you provide because even if fans forget the outcome of a game, they’ll never forget how you made them feel.\n\nSince graduating from Syracuse University in May 2019, I have been interviewing for positions with teams and media companies with the hope to join a corporate partnerships team.\n\nJosh Katz, SPM ’19\n\nIn the Fall 2018 semester, I completed my senior Capstone with the Dallas Cowboys as a Business Analytics and Insights intern at the team’s headquarters, The Star, in Frisco, Texas.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the Cowboys’ Business Analytics team is to provide analytical business insights for the sales, marketing, sponsorship, merchandise, and media departments. I focused on building dashboards for the sales team to monitor campaigns, collecting market research for the sponsorship team in preparation for pitch meetings, and monitoring the team’s CRM data warehouse.\n\nLearning from such a prolific franchise was an incredible experience. I honed and improved my technical skills in Tableau, R, SQL, and CRM practices, and took the lead on key projects throughout the semester. I was lucky to have three great supervisors who taught me best practices in the sport analytics industry and showed me the importance of creative problem-solving.\n\nIt was such an honor to learn from industry professionals at an NFL franchise during the season. I loved being in the fast-paced and highly competitive environment of the NFL. Also, getting to work from AT&T Stadium on gamedays was an added perk.\n\nOverall, my senior Capstone was an incredible experience. I met so many top-notch people throughout the organization, and the skills and lessons I learned with the Cowboys helped me land a full-time position as a Business Analyst with the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens.\n\nSean Onwualu, SPM ’19\n\nDuring the 2018 Spring semester, I was honored to intern at Athletes First, a full-service sport agency in Laguna Hills, CA.\n\nAthletes First primarily focuses on football, representing more than 150 NFL players and coaches. Interns help the organization throughout the NFL season and off-season, including assisting with the rookie program, Super Bowl, NFL Combine, NFL Free Agency and NFL Draft. I helped secure items and work for Athletes First’s yearly Charity Auction to raise money for the Orangewood Foundation, which aims to provide foster children with a better life.\n\nHighlights from my senior Capstone include working on the Charity Auction, Free Agency and the NFL Draft. I felt I truly made an impact on these events. For the auction, each intern was tasked with finding a high-profile item worth auctioning. My contribution was four tickets to a Monster Jam rally. During NFL Free Agency, I compiled statistics and information for New York Giants wide receiver Sterling Shepard’s agent, who helped land Shepard a four-year $41 million extension this past off-season. The NFL Draft was exciting as I got to see athletes I helped and worked for during the semester have their lifelong dreams fulfilled.\n\nI learned a lot about the agency side of football and how important agents are to players. They work hard behind the scenes in order to be successful. I will take all of the real-world lessons I learned at Athletes First and apply them as I begin my career in the sport industry, preferably in sponsorships or marketing.\n\nDestiny Castro, SPM ’18\n\nCompleting my senior Capstone in the community relations department with the Brooklyn Nets during the spring 2018 semester allowed me to combine my passion for sports, children, and education, as well as give back to my hometown of Brooklyn. This community has played a vital role in shaping me into the woman I am today. The internship has been a blessing, and working in the community was one of the most fulfilling aspects of the experience.\n\nDuring the Capstone, I participated in countless events, including Brooklyn Nets games, community events, and basketball academy clinics. These events included current players such as D’Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie, and Nets’ legend Albert King. My favorite events were the basketball clinics we hosted at local community centers and schools.\n\nMy experience with the Brooklyn Nets taught me that I must take on a career path that will allow me to positively make an impact on other’s lives.

I will still assist the Brooklyn Nets when time allows, and have submitted a proposal of an event the Nets’ organization is working toward activating next season.\n\nBryan Kilmeade, SPM ’18\n\nDuring the Spring 2018 semester, I completed my senior Capstone at the National Football League with the Management Council in New York City. The Management Council directly deals with the Collective Bargaining Agreement on the league’s behalf. It handles everything from managing the league’s salary cap to regulating the amount of time players are allowed at the team facility in the offseason. I was lucky to complete my Capstone in the Spring, where I was able to see the department operate in different phases: the playoffs and Super Bowl, the start of free agency, and the draft.\n\nMy area of focus was in Labor Operations and Salary Cap Management, where I learned a tremendous amount about the salary cap and the CBA. My main responsibilities were to edit the daily waiver wire and create contract grids from the previous day and send it to the player’s union, approve contracts submitted by teams, assist with the daily reconciliation of the salary cap, and be available to complete tasks and projects as needed.\n\nWorking in the Management Council gave me an incredible opportunity to learn about the salary cap and Collective Bargaining Agreement from some of the most knowledgeable people on the subject and have access to information I could not have gotten anywhere else. I was lucky to see the department function and evolve from in-season to off-season.\n\nUpon graduating from Syracuse University, I have been interviewing for positions with two teams with the potential to rejoin the NFL in a similar capacity. I look forward to pursuing a career in football on the team or league side.\n\nReid McGrory, SPM ’18\n\nIn Fall 2017, I completed my senior Capstone as a sponsorship intern for Intersport, a sport marketing and production agency headquartered in Chicago.

They are among the top sport marketing agencies in the country and pride themselves in using their CEO’s 6 P’s (partners, people, potential, perspective, principles, and passion) to produce a memorable event that exceeds client expectations.\n\nI worked on two main accounts: World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).

The lifeblood of the department was community programming, which benefitted several causes, including veterans, health and wellness, youth, and education. Working with 10 to 15 different programs, we ran more than 50 community events in my four months with the organization.
