        "text": "Written By: Bob Colling\n\nTotal Non-Stop Action presents Impact\n\nDate: January 4th, 2010\n\nFrom: Orlando, Florida\n\nAnnouncers: Mike Tenay and Tazz\n\nBefore I start with the review of TNA Impact, I thought I’d share some thoughts on TNA at this time. I will be honest, I have not been watching present day TNA as of late. I do read the spoilers to see what is going on. However, now that I am covering TNA I will have to refrain from doing so. So, for future reference, I will not know what has happened prior to the television tapings. Here are some thoughts before the show.\n\nJanuary 4th, 2010 is a anniversary of a certain event that happened in WCW. On the same date back in 1999, Hulk Hogan and Kevin Nash participated in one of the most ridiculous angles ever in what as called the “Finger Poke of Doom”. I would think they (TNA) would make some sort of reference to that event, or at least Kevin Nash will. Also, back on January 4th, 1999 the New World Order was reformed. Apparently, Nash has been trying to get the band back together. That can only mean bad things. Especially if Scott Hall and Sean Waltman who have been irrelevant since 1998 (Hall) and 2002 (Waltman), come back to TNA. Here are some wrestlers that have been rumored, or at least mentioned as possibilities.\n\nSid Vicious, Rob Van Dam, Scott Hall, Sean Waltman, Mr. Kennedy (Anderson), and Paul Heyman. It’s all but confirmed that Hall and Waltman will be there. Sid has shown TNA logos on his official website which suggests that he has been signed. Kennedy has been, according to wrestling websites, holding out on trying to get back in to the WWE, and to the best of my knowledge, Rob Van Dam’s wife has cancer and he was spending time with her. Of all the guys mentioned, Rob Van Dam would be the best pick up.\n\nI have been really looking forward to this live three hour edition of Impact for many reasons. I don’t care for Hulk Hogan. I am much more interested in seeing what Eric Bischoff is doing. I will not believe that a guy who nearly put Vince McMahon out of business is just looking to get TNA more programming. If he were to be doing just that, then TNA has some serious issues not having him have a more significant role in the company. I just don’t see Hulk Hogan being a genius like a Eric Bischoff or Paul Heyman. Also, it is about time the WWE gets some competition. Wrestling hasn’t been the same since WCW and even ECW went out business back in early 2001. This could be the re-birth of the Monday Night Wars. Tonight is a very important night for TNA. Hopefully they impress.\n\nCurrent Champions:\n\nTNA World Champion: AJ Styles since September, 20th, 2009\n\nTNA Global Champion: Eric Young since October 18th, 2009\n\nTNA World Tag Team Champions: British Invasion (Brutus Magnus/Doug Williams) since October 18th, 2009\n\nTNA X-Division Champion: Amazing Red since October 8th, 2009\n\nTNA Knockout Champion: Tara since December 20th, 2009\n\nTNA Women’s World Tag Team Champions: Sarita and Taylor Wilde since September 20th, 2009\n\nJoin me as we experience some Total Non-Stop Action!\n\nA video recapping the beginning of TNA’s first event back on June 19th, 2002, Sting’s return to TNA at Final Resolution 2006, Kurt Angle arriving in TNA in late 2006. The video also promotes Hulk Hogan arriving in TNA and also several of the talent in TNA including AJ Styles, Matt Morgan and Christopher Daniels.\n\n“Time for a Change”\n\nTNA opening video package\n\nWe are LIVE from Orlando, Florida for TNA Impact! Mike Tenay and Tazz are on commentary. Tenay says tonight is the biggest night in TNA history. They make sure to mention Hulk Hogan appearance in TNA a few times. They run down the card which includes the following.\n\n– Steel Asylum match, but the TNA X-Division belt is not on the line\n\n– Tara defends the Knockout Championship against ODB\n\n– Rhino takes on Abyss in a Barbed Wire Massacre match\n\n– Beer Money Inc take on the British Invasion in a Full Metal Mayhem match\n\nBubba the Love Sponge was outside talking to fans. A fan wants to “wrestling”. A female fan wants to see hot, big, sweaty men in the ring. Another fan believes that TNA is coming after WWE. Another fan says “WWE sucks”. A attractive female fan doesn’t like the kid stuff and wants some blood. Another shows his dedication for TNA as he has a tattoo.\n\nOpening Contest: Steel Asylum was ruled a No Contest: Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Homicide, Kiyoshi, Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Suicide, and the TNA X-Division Champion Amazing Red are the competitors in the match. As expected the match is a all out brawl in the opening moments. This may be difficult to follow. Lethal and Creed double team Sabin with a backbreaker/dropkick combo. “Fire Russo” chant also, though it didn’t last long. Shelley is a good way up but is stopped by Lethal. All eight men trade several moves which is far to difficult to for me to catch up. They are all made out to look good. Suicide makes his way near the top of the cage, but is stopped by Red. Red with a nice hurricanrana on Sabin off the cage. Homicide uses a baton to hit Red. However, Homicide hits Kiyoshi and Chris Sabin. The referee calls for the bell, and the match is a no contest. “This is Bull Shit” chant starts up as Homicide climbs out the top of the cage. The chant is censored out by Spike TV. Homicide has a tough time getting out of the cage! The rest of the guys go get him, but he drops down and tries to leave but the rest of the wrestlers attack him. **\n\nWait a second… familiar music hits and coming through the crowd is… JEFF HARDY! Hardy has cut his hair. He is attacked by Homicide on the floor. Hardy sends Homicide into the guard railing and delivers a sick chair shot to the face of Homicide. Hardy with the Twist of Fate on the entrance ramp! Jeff Hardy climbs to the top of the cage and sits on the top playing to the crowd.\n\nCommercial Break\n\nTenay and Tazz recap the appearance of Jeff Hardy after the Steel Asylum match.\n\nJeff Hardy is seen walking to the backstage area where Shannon Moore shakes his hand.\n\nMike Tenay and Tazz once again hype up the Hulk Hogan debut in TNA. Oh brother, Hogan has a police escort. This really seems like WCW 1994.\n\nBackstage, Christy Hemme is with Kevin Nash. Nash says that tonight is a “epic night for TNA”. He is looking forward to seeing a old friend. Nash says that Hogan was his first mentor. Nash says that TNA is on their way to becoming number one. Nash continues by saying that there are a lot of reasons to be excited as he will be making a lot more money. Nash says that Hogan is on his way and that he is not alone.\n\nSecond Contest: ODB defeated Tara to win the TNA Knockout Championship: ODB kicks Tara as he takes her shirt off for the early advantage. Tara with a back elbow and a clothesline fighting out of the corner. They trade right hands but Tara takes ODB down with a kick to the side of ODB’s head and a standing moonsault for a near fall. Tara locks in the Tarantula and follows up with a somersault leg drop for another near fall. ODB reverses a power bomb and uses the tights for leverage to pin Tara. NOTE: Part of Tara’s butt was exposed so Spike TV cut away from the finish briefly. *\n\nAfter the match, Tara hit’s the Windows Peak to leave the new champion out in the ring. Tara grabs her spider Poison, and puts the spider onto ODB.\n\nBackstage, a limo pulls out in front of the building and out walks… RIC FLAIR! Flair is greeted by several wrestlers and officials and walks into a locker room. Apparently it was AJ Styles locker room\n\nCommercial Break\n\nChristy Hemme was outside with the fans. A female fan says that Hulk Hogan is great. Hemme runs over to Mick Foley who is entering the Impact Zone. Foley got the memo saying that he was barred from the Impact Zone. Foley says that he doesn’t want to do anything wrong and says he will be on his best behavior. He tries to enter but is stopped by security. Foley just says he isn’t being allowed in.\n\nBobby “The Boss” Lashley and Kristal Lashley make their way down to the ring. Kristal has a microphone and puts over the importance of the night for TNA. She says that Bobby has a message for Hogan. She says that Bobby is a star in both wrestling but also in mixed marital arts. Kristal rips on the fans of wrestling calling the fans “inbreed and toothless”. Kristal says that Bobby is seeking his release from TNA. Bobby is just smiling, so apparently he is fine with what she is saying. They simply leave the ring.\n\nBackstage, Velvet Sky is with a camera man and she enters a room. Sky, Madison and Lacey Von Erich are playing poker. Sky says that they are going to put on their own poker show. Sky and Lacey can’t get along on playing the game. Lacey loses the game and is forced to strip. She only takes off her jacket. Madison says “When we lose, everybody else wins”\n\nCommercial Break\n\n– TNA Epics debuts on January 14th, 2010 at 11pm\n\nOutside, Scott Hall and Sean Waltman are saying they are invited. They try to enter the arena but are stop by security. Hall chokes one of the security guys and several more security guys help out their partners.\n\nMike Tenay mentions that TNA is the number one trending topic on Twitter.\n\nReally? We go back outside to see the limo of Hulk Hogan arriving to the TNA Arena. Tenay says that Hogan debut will be.. NEXT.\n\nCommercial Break\n\n– At the time of writing this, TNA has gone seventeen minutes without any in-ring wrestling.\n\nGuess what, we are back and we are back to looking at the limo that has Hulk Hogan inside. The limo has stopped and the door opened, but then shut again and the limo continues to drive on. Tazz and Tenay ponder what that was all about.\n\nSean Waltman and Scott Hall have made their way into the ring arena. Hall flicks his toothpick at the camera before we go to a…\n\nCommercial Break\n\n– At the time of writing this, TNA has gone twenty two minutes without any in-ring wrestling\n\nHulk Hogan’s music hits and out comes Hulk Hogan! The crowd erupts for Hogan who is wearing all black. Hogan gets a lot of fireworks as he comes down to the ring. Hogan points out a “Hogan owns Vince” sign in the front row. Hall and Waltman are clapping for Hogan as he enters the ring. Brooke Hogan and Hulk’s fiancée are cheering him on as well. Hogan gets “emotional” from the reception from the TNA crowd. Hogan says that TNA is making history tonight. Hogan puts over all the talent in the locker room. Hogan says that there are “a lot of old faces” in the back as well. Hogan predicts TNA will be the number one wrestling company. It is 9:00pm marking the start of RAW. Hogan says he feels the power and energy from the TNA crowd. Waltman and Hall jumps the railing but is stopped by security. Hogan tells security to back off and wants Hall and Waltman to enter the ring to talk. Hall does his usual “Hey Yo” phrase to get a decent reception from the crowd. Hall says that they heard Eric Bischoff, Hulk Hogan and Kevin Nash were going to be here, they figured their would be big houses, big pay checks and big parties. Hogan says it isn’t like that anymore as this is a “different place”. Waltman says it is the same place and they are ready to party. Hogan tells Waltman it will be totally different this time around. Hogan tells Hall that it is time to grow up and do the right thing for the business. Kevin Nash makes his way out to the ring, Nash asks Hogan when did he turn so “corporate”. Hogan tells them that they are his brothers “for life” but they need to do this for the business. Eric Bischoff music and out comes Eric Bischoff! Bischoff says that it has been awhile and that this brings back memories. Bischoff says all the guys standing in the ring changed the business forever. Bischoff says that their has been a serious break down in communication. Bischoff says that everyone needs to earn their position in the company. Nash tells Bischoff they hear him and that they will talk later. Nash, Waltman and Hall leave the ring. Hogan repeats what Bischoff stated about earning their spots. “The game changes now, everyone must earn their spot in this company.” Bischoff says that they did it once and that they can sure do it again. Bischoff says that everyone is under notice. Hogan says the change will continue until they are number one. They ask for a producer with a format. Bischoff looks at the format and proceeds to rip up the format. They are “starting over”. Bischoff hands a new format to So Cal Val. They are going to turn the company upside down, starting right now. Hogan tells the wrestlers that if you can not talk or wrestle then you might as well head up north! Sting is seen looking down from the rafters as TNA goes to commercial\n\nCommercial Break\n\n– David Penzer is heard trying to get the crowd riled up.. Oops!\n\nSting is standing in the rafters looking down at the ring. Tenay and Tazz put over the history between Sting and Hulk Hogan, briefly\n\nThird Contest: Awesome Kong and Hamada defeated Taylor Wilde and Sarita to win the TNA Knockout Tag Team Championships: Sarita and Hamada start the match off and they both trade clotheslines and take downs early on. Sarita with a float over DDT as well before tagging in Wilde. Wilde with a springboard arm drag. Backstage, we see the Motor City Machine Guns laid out. Kong comes in and drops Sarita with a Samoan Drop and big boots Wilde. Wilde with a series of dropkicks, but a double team dropkick sends Kong to the floor. Sarita with a suicide dive and Wilde with a cross body off the top to the floor. Hamada with a dropkick to the face of Wilde as we return from commercial. Clips showed that throughout the commercial, the champions were getting dominated. Wilde with a Code Breaker type of move on Kong and tagged in Sarita who connected with a springboard dropkick. Kong blocks a roll through on the power bomb by sitting on Sarita but Wilde dropkicks Kong to break up the count. Hamada sends Wilde into the ring post knocking her out. Kong has Sarita set up for a power bomb, and Hamada leaps off the top with a dropkick and Kong power bombs Sarita! Kong covers Sarita to win the championships. **1/4\n\nAfter the match, the new champions taunt the crowd as the former champions are barely moving.\n\nBackstage, the Beautiful People are going to play some 7 card stud. All of a sudden, Val Venis walks into the room and joins the girls. Venis has just gotten out of the shower and says that if he loses one hand, it is all over for him. Venis says it is going to be a very interesting night.\n\nCommercial Break\n\nBackstage, Mick Foley is trying to get back into the building but some guys who were once known as Phi Delta Slam stopping him. The Nasty Boys also come by and attempt to enter the building but they are also denied from entering the building.\n\nFourth Contest: Hernandez/Matt Morgan defeated Dr. Stevie/Raven to become number one contenders for the TNA World Tag Team Championships: Raven and Hernandez start the match of with Hernandez taking Raven down with a shoulder block. Dr. Stevie and Morgan enter and Stevie is met with the Carbon Footprint to get a very quick win. Literally, that was the whole match. DUD\n\nBackstage, Christy Hemme is with the Pope. Pope is facing Desmond Wolfe this evening. Pope isn’t surprised that Hulk Hogan wants him in the ring tonight. Pope can’t believe that Hemme has “dipped your hand in my cup, yet.” Pope says that he will reach the mountain top in TNA. Orlando Jordan slips into the scene and has a bottle of five hour energy. Pope is not happy Jordan is cutting into his promo time. Jordan wishes Pope luck, but Pope blows Jordan off on a handshake attempt. Pope leaves the scene.\n\nFifth Contest: D’Angelo Dinero defeated Desmond Wolfe: Wolfe takes Dinero down with a wrist lock early on and attempts to send Dinero in the corner with a hammerlock but Dinero blocks and springs off the middle rope connecting with a clothesline. Wolfe with a hammerlock DDT of sorts and rams Dinero shoulder first into the corner. Wolfe works on the left arm of Dinero for several moments. Wolfe misses a attack in the corner. Dinero with a delayed elbow drop in the corner. Wolfe goes for the Tower of London but misses. Dinero rolls Wolfe up moments later and picks up the win! **1/2\n\nBackstage, Jeff Jarrett walks into the building.\n\nCommercial Break\n\nBubba the Love Sponge cuts Jeremy Borash off and mentions that Rhino has been attacked. That could mean Rhino/Abyss match is now off.\n\nMike Tenay and Tazz put over all the things that have happened so far tonight. Of course, they make sure to put Hulk Hogan as the top priority and show clips of his debut.\n\nBackstage, Jeff Jarrett is walking to the ring.\n\nCommercial Break\n\nNearly two hours into the program and the first appearance of the TNA World Heavyweight Champion AJ Styles takes place. Jeremy Borash is with Styles backstage. Styles says he can’t hold the belt with pride until he beats Kurt Angle at Genesis. Eric Bischoff walks into the room and mocks AJ Styles by clapping.

The final hour of Impact begins. Jarrett gets a cheap pop saying it feels great to back home at the Impact Zone. Jarrett mentions that he founded TNA seven years ago. The crowd starts up a “Thank you Jeff” chant. Jarrett says that people said they wouldn’t last six weeks or even six months. Jarrett puts over Monday night as being the greatest night in wrestling history. Jarrett mentions that he tried for years to bring Hogan into TNA but the timing wasn’t right. However, now the timing is right. Jarrett says that he has given hundreds of young guys a chance to compete in TNA. Jarrett mentions some guys including, Beer Money, MCMG, Daniels, Samoa Joe and current TNA World Heavyweight Champion AJ Styles. Jarrett says “you aint seen nothing yet!” Jarrett says that with a team of himself, Dixie Carter and Hulk Hogan anything will happen. Hulk Hogan shows up on the jumbo screen. Hogan tells Jarrett that he doesn’t care. Hogan says that Jarrett did start the company but also he ran the company into the ground. Hogan puts Dixie Carter over as helping the company out. Hogan says that he is now Dixie Carter’s partner, and not Jarrett. Hogan says now the young guys will get their push herein TNA. Hogan again says that TNA is going all the way to the top.

Team 3-D are in Japan and the Nasty Boys mess their locker room up and eat some donuts while they are at it. They spray paint a picture of Team 3-D.

Foley grabs Bischoff but is attacked by Sean Waltman, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. Hulk Hogan enters the room and is looking at his brothers.\n\nEnd of show\n\nMy Take: A extremely disappointing finish to the Steel Asylum. This is the biggest show in TNA’s history and they start off a CAGE match with a No Contest finish? The match was really average at best with all the guys involved trying to showcase what they have for the fans. The Jeff Hardy appearance didn’t get nearly the reaction you would have thought it should have gotten. Perhaps one of the biggest baby faces in the WWE, shows up on TNA television and doesn’t get a huge ovation. Something is right about that. Knockout match wasn’t anything that great, but Tara showcased some good stuff.\n\nLiterally a half hour into the show and there are two huge surprises. The first being Jeff Hardy and the second being Ric Flair. That means their could be six debuts or surprises and that rate. I can’t stand the fact that TNA went from commercial to commercial without any wrestling. Just people.. TALKING.\n\nI must say, for the first hour of TNA Impact, this has been extremely disappointing. I get two matches within a half hour, but then go approx. twenty four minutes without any WRESTLING on a WRESTLING program.\n\nThe segment with Bischoff, Hogan, Hall, Waltman, and Nash dragged on a little but my god that was very effective segment I thought. It really showed the fans that perhaps TNA isn’t going to be what is has been the past several years. I was losing hope early, but that segment got me back into the show and anxious to see what is going to happen. Though, it was a poor decision to follow that up with a Knockouts tag team match which just so happened to compete against a Divas match on RAW. I thought that was a interesting tidbit.\n\nThe Knockout tag team title match was a good contest but I think it was poor choice to follow the previous segment. The number one contenders match for the tag team titles match really put over Morgan and Hernandez and showed just what Raven and Stevie are to TNA and that appears to be jobbers. Personally, I find Raven to have one good run left in him.\n\nI like D’Angelo Dinero, don’t get me wrong but I really feel like Desmond Wolfe offers more to TNA. Wolfe needs to win some matches to be even considered a threat to the title. I wonder if Hogan and company are not high on Wolfe. If they prefer Scott Hall over Desmond Wolfe, then TNA has some serious issues.\n\nJarrett being brought back to reality by being told he has zero power was a good. I hope this gives the character of Jarrett’s a fire to take control back of his company. Jarrett, Sting, Angle, Styles and Daniels need to come together and take back what is theirs and that could mean some good television in the future.\n\nAbyss looks like a homeless man to me. He really needs to go back to the Abyss of 2004/2005. He was a monster and a great character. Seems like a joke now. However, I am happy to see that Samoan Joe no longer has that goofy face paint. The match wasn’t good at all, by the way.\n\nA Nasty Boys/Team 3-D feud could be interesting. I think they could have some fun wild hardcore matches.\n\nThe main event was fantastic. It got plenty of time and while I didn’t like all the kick outs of the Styles Clash and Angle Slams, it was a very good contest that kept me interested. Also, it also had a CLEAN FINISH. Clearly, this is a step in the right direction. How many times did WCW ever have a clean finish on free television? I like that, good job TNA.\n\nOverall, a little bit too much talking in the first hour but things picked up after the segment involving Hogan, Bischoff, Hall, Nash and Waltman. I’d say it was a good decision to tune into TNA over WWE this week. Though, I didn’t like having two matches being promoted and then dropped. Rhino/Abyss in a Barbed Wire Massacre match and the Full Metal Mayhem between Beer Money Inc and the British Invasion would have made the show a little too gimmicky. I’d hope those matches will be on future shows, though.\n\nHere is a list of people who debuted, returned or re-debuted for TNA.\n\n– Jeff Hardy\n\n– Shannon Moore\n\n– Ric Flair\n\n– Hulk Hogan\n\n– Eric Bischoff\n\n– Sean Waltman\n\n– Orlando Jordan\n\n– Sting\n\n– Scott Hall\n\n– Val Venis\n\n– Nasty Boys\n\nThanks for reading."
