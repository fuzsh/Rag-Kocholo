Topics of discussion include:\n\nWWE feeding AEW weekend \"fast national\" ratings to various people in wrestling media, most recently with the fake data point that the July 6 episode of Collision did a zero rating in the 18-34 demographic. Including what \"fast nationals\" actually are.\n\nThe increasingly frequent occurrence of running WWE PR plants without attribution and why/how this shouldn't even be happening.\n\nHow many of the people talking about Nielsen ratings understand they're a statistical sample and not magically calculating everyone who's watching?\n\nWhat exactly is WWE's end game with the fast nationals grift, and is it working?\n\nAll of the many problems with WWE's post-show press conferences, most recently exemplified by online reactions to John Pollock and Brandon Thurston's questions at the Money in the Bank presser in Toronto.\n\nExactly why their questions were fine by any metric.\n\nWhy there is no other time or place for those questions.\n\nWhy does WWE even bother with the facade?\n\nThe actual reasons why wrestling media don't break most of the more \"serious\" stories related to WWE.\n\nThe various lawsuit threats that David has gotten, including after #SpeakingOut happened.\n\nHow David factored Deadspin indemnifying him against legal action and legal fees factored into his process.\n\nAre there people we DON'T want covering more difficult stories in the first place?\n\nHas Dave Meltzer's handling of some topics set the wrong tone? Has Dave's continued commitment to covering EVERYTHING spread him too thin?\n\nWhy AEW banning Ringside News from its media events is Actually Good.\n\n...and much more. Maybe this is a one-off. Maybe this will eventually happen again. Who knows?
