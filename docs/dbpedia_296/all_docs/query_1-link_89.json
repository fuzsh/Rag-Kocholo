        "text": "TNA Impact Wrestling has left Spike TV and will air on Destination America from January 2015.\n\nDiscovery Communications yesterday confirmed a multi-year deal to bring the promotion to the station, including the premieres of additional TNA Wrestling series and specials.\n\nInternational broadcasting rights in select regions will be announced at a later date.\n\n\"We are very excited about Destination America being the new network for Impact Wrestling and the partnership with Discovery Communications both domestically and across the globe,\" said TNA boss Dixie Carter.\n\n\"Their commitment to promote and grow our brand in innovative and compelling ways was instrumental in knowing we had found the right home.\"\n\nShe added: \"Together we will create an experience that takes our fans on a new journey that will push the envelope of technology, including where we take our cameras, going deeper into our superstars' lives and showing the reality of what it takes to create a weekly professional wrestling show, all while showcasing the very best male and female athletes in the world.\"\n\nTNA boss Dixie Carter: 'I'm open to WWE crossover event'\n\nDestination America group president Henry Schleiff said: \"The enduring, cross-generational enthusiasm of pro wrestling is felt by millions of fans around the country, from coast-to-coast and throughout the heartland.\"\n\nGeneral manager of Destination America Marc Etkind added: \"Our knockout partnership with TNA Impact Wrestling continues Destination America's mission of bringing our viewers the best of all-American entertainment, and going center ring with one of the world's foremost professional wrestling leagues fits perfectly within our DNA.\n\n\"Wrestling has created a fiercely loyal, passionate and widespread fan base, and we look forward to being part of the TNA family.\"\n\nTNA's current roster includes the likes of Jeff Hardy, Bobby Roode, Kurt Angle, Bobby Lashley and Gail Kim.\n\nTotal Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling was founded by Jeff Jarrett in 2002 after the demise of WCW, and initially ran weekly pay-per-views rather than regular broadcast shows.\n\nIts first regular cable show TNA Xplosion launched in November 2002, and two years later started TNA iMPACT! on Fox Sports.\n\nWhen that deal expired in 2005, TNA had a pause in TV broadcasting before signing a deal with Spike TV and airing its first episode on that station in October 2005.\n\nOwned by Discovery Communications Destination America launched in 2012 as a digital cable and satellite TV channel."
