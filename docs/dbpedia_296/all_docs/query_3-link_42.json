        "text": "why are we promoting NASP &quot;mainstreaming&quot; at college age?\n\nKool-aid? NASP coaches purposely steering archers away from outside archery? \"Serious Rigs\" and mopping the floor with ringers? Really? And how are \"NASP parent stories\" any different from \"JOAD parent stories, maybe we can leave those in the \"youth sports thread\".\n\nI'm perplexed by much of the animus I've read here in this thread (and others) and towards NASP and the Genesis. It seems as those who don't truly understand the program and the incredible benefits this program provides to these kids are always quick to criticize and make general assumptions about NASP. NASP is not perfect, but it is an amazing and well run program on so many levels, that as is about so much more than just archery(AND THAT'S OK).\n\nIn my opinion, the Genesis is one key to NASP's widespread success and very high participation numbers. Since there is no tuning and zero focus on \"cutting edge equipment\", the only thing that can be tuned is the archer and their focus on the steps. The Genesis provides a very \"pure\" and unencumbered archery entrance and experience. NASP and the Genesis are so very inclusive, equalized and easy for gym teachers, parents and coaches to maintain. NASP and the Genesis falls squarely between compound and recurve disciplines to allow for the \"potential\" (albeit unrealized) transition beyond NASP to any discipline. And honestly, NASP archers can go barebow recurve with very little form transition, using almost the same form and shot sequence they use with their Genesis.\n\nThe main reasons kids do not move on, is the lack of a bridge and the need to build their own bridge with no knowledge on how or where to do it.\n\nIt may take awhile to get it right, but this partnership/press release is at least an acknowledgement of the need for this \"bridge\" and should be applauded. NASP has done a great job folding in 3D IBO archery into the NASP program and I'm enthusiastic that NASP and USAA can weave in a beyond NASP bridge with equal success. It's good to know NASP and USAA are now at least listening.\n\nHopefully they will take serious first steps to build it. However, I strongly believe the existing archery community is part of the \"they.\" I believe mopping the NASP floors and smashing Kool-Aid stands is probably a wrong approach for the archery community to consider.\n\nAgreed.\n\nSomething to consider that has been mentioned:\n\nNASP certifies as a Basic Archery Instructor\n\nUSA has 5 levels.\n\nMost of the NASP instructors I’ve trained have never touched a bow in their lives. The neat thing is that they go through everything their future students will go through.\n\nI personally try to bring a lot of what I’ve learned through USA into our elementary school NASP program. We talk hunting. We go outside and shoot from 50 and 70 meters. With Genesis bows. And they freakin eat it up like free candy.\n\nNone of the kids at my school can afford their own target bows. They can’t even afford annual dues. But they sure can come to school and shoot and have fun.\n\nThe two certifications are similar but still apples to oranges.\n\nBUT\n\nIt gets kids involved in something rewarding, builds discipline and focus, teaches them to follow a process to be successful and that they are masters of their own destiny. Lots of my kids made connections between being process driven in archery to academics. That’s huge in my book.\n\nI’m excited about the future with these two partnering.\n\nNASP is what NASP is, and does what it does. It also does it well, just not the way \"we\" want it to because NASP doesn't, for the most part, introduce their participants to JOAD or other archery programs. I hear a lot of complaints about how poor NASP is for promoting archery, but that's not its primary purpose for the most part. As has been said a few times, NASP is often taught by a PE teacher who probably knew nothing about archery when they were told they had to teach it - along with all the other sports they have to teach as well. They probably teach five or six other classes as well, which may have nothing to do with archery, but is still sport oriented, so they have to learn that sport as well. What NASP does do well, is it gets the participants involved in something other than video games, trouble, gangs etc, and helps them develop some level of focus and interest that may be very helpful to them in school overall. It keeps a lot of them out of trouble and is something they can do without investing a lot of money, which a lot of them don't have. Anything that helps a kid stay out of trouble in school is something the schools are very appreciative of, especially if it also helps make them better students.\n\nAnother thing NASP does is it introduces them to archery, maybe not the archery that \"we\" want it to be, but it gives some of the participants a chance to learn, and if there is any interest there, they can explore it a bit more. A lot of them won't do that, some will. With todays access to information, those who show any level of interest in archery can find all kinds of information about it relatively quickly and can pursue it if they are interested. Those that say the NASP coaches don't teach them about other aspects of archery may be very accurate. There are also probably those coaches who, as has been pointed out, discourage their students from exploring other aspects of archery, we will always have those people around, and not just in archery. The same for those parents who are totally (?) unaware of other aspects of archery, there will always be those parents around. Not much you can do about either the coaches or the parents like that. No sense beating your head against a brick wall.\n\nI've read a lot of complaints about NASP and the coaches who teach it, but how many of you have tried to offer some ideas or suggestions about other options? How many of you have volunteered to help the NASP coach teach archery? How many of you have any idea about what it's like to be a teacher of any subject in almost any school system? We say we want to build a bridge, or we want USA Archery to build a bridge, but how many of you have tried to help that along?\n\nI'm a JOAD coach in my local area. We have both indoor and outdoor coaching available during the year. We open our doors up to NASP participants who just want to \"fling\" some arrows. We give them a place to do just that, but as they do that, they also get exposure to our JOAD students, some of whom are pretty good and have some very good equipment. We ask the NASP kids if they want any coaching before we do any coaching. Some of them do, some of them don't. For those who are comfortable with their NASP coach, we just make sure the NASP shooters stay safe. We have genesis bows they can shoot if they don't have their own, and we also have other equipment they can try out if they want. Do we pick up many NASP students in our JOAD program? A few, but what we are doing is exposing them to a different aspect of archery. If it is something they want to pursue, we provide an opportunity for exploration. If that is not where there interest is, even if we can see all kinds of potential, then we just let them enjoy archery for what they want to get out of it. I had a student tell me just a couple of weeks ago, he didn't want any coaching, he just wanted to fling arrows and have fun, that's all he wanted from archery. I stopped offering suggestions and told him if he wanted some help, let me know, otherwise, have fun.\n\nIt's real easy for those of us who are \"ate up\" with archery to want more and better things for others who don't know about archery, and to complain about those who don't see it our way, but let's face it, we're ate up with it. If we weren't, we wouldn't be on AT would we? That doesn't apply to most people, they aren't ate up with it like we are. Castigating them and complaining about how poor the NASP program is, and it's deficiencies, isn't going to change it, nor is it going to have any impact on it at all. The only way to have any chance of change, is to do what you can at your own level, if that means finding out about NASP and what it really is and offering to help out in some way, then that's the step to take. With our JOAD program, we welcome the NASP students in as part of our overall \"family\" of archers and only ask that they find a way to enjoy the sport of archery to the extent they want to do so. Is it the best we can do? Probably not, but it's a start, and it doesn't involve running down a different program just because it doesn't do what we would like it to do. We don't know if any of the NASP students will eventually make a switch to recurve or compound archery, but at least they have a place to \"fling\" arrows, and explore if they want. Without our involvement, many may have no other place than just school to shoot and may lose all interest. Will we change/help anyone? We don't know. But we certainly won't if we don't open our doors to them. We often shake our heads at the NASP shooters lack or archery knowledge and lack of decent coaching, at least from our perspective, but we want them to enjoy the sport for whatever reason they have. Challenging, or running down their coach or NASP won't be helpful to them and may lessen their enjoyment, and may cause us to lose a potential convert later on.\n\nProselytizing is over! Just remember, the PE teacher who teaches NASP may have any number of other sports they are responsible for teaching and NASP may be a low priority for them. I know a lot of us may not understand that concept, but it may be true for the NASP coaches."
