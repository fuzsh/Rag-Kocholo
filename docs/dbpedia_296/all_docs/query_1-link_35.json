        "text": "Every year, there's talk of WWE's big four, and how they seem to change through the \"eras\" of wrestling. It started as WrestleMania, Survivor Series, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, and has become some combination of WrestleMania and 3 others.\n\nWhat are TNA's Big Four? Bound For Glory is obviously the biggest, and is referred to as their \"flagship\" PPV. Slammiversary has the name of a big PPV, and is frequently advertised as a huge show, and ends up with a big card, and exciting matches. I'd say Destination X would be another one. It doesn't always get the billing as a huge event, but it usually pays off as one, and the main events have all been solid over the years.\n\nAs for which one would be #4, I'm not sure. Is it Victory Road? How about Hard Justice? Against All Odds? I'm torn between the three, and can't make up my mind. So, convince me. Name the 4 you think have the title of the \"Big Four\".\n\nReminder: Do not spam!\n\nDespite what TNA might say, Lockdown is their biggest show of the year. Most feuds end at that show and it draws more than the rest.\n\nI'd agree it's big, but naming it as the biggest after seeing WWE's recent failures with gimmick pay-per-views didn't seem like a logical idea. They usually have big matches, but that's because you can't stick a \"nothing\" feud into a cage and expect it to work. As far as drawing, I think it's because of the gimmick more than the matches. Everyone likes to watch the Six Sides Of Steel, if only because it's six-sided.\n\nThey don't have a 4th. Half they treat as transitional PPVs, the ones they don't aren't much different than them.\n\nI was afraid of this response. They really don't hype a 4th as a big deal, but there are shows where the cards stack up. Hard Justice is usually one, as is Destination X, and that's why they made my Big Four.\n\nI'd agree it's big,\n\nI wouldn't say it's a big show. Just big by TNA standards.\n\nbut naming it as the biggest after seeing WWE's recent failures with gimmick pay-per-views didn't seem like a logical idea.\n\nWWE gimmick PPVs are presented as nothing shows, and they're recieved as such. Despite their failing TTNA do try their hardest to make this show appear important. It's usually reflected in the build and better highlight packages they produce for the show.\n\nAs far as drawing, I think it's because of the gimmick more than the matches.\n\nMaybe, but WrestleMania is a gimmick. It's WWE's highest drawing show because fans view it as being important and must see. Bound For Glory is presented by TNA as being important, but it barely draws more than a typical show. Gimmick or not, TNA fans view the show as being the most important of the year.\n\nI was afraid of this response. They really don't hype a 4th as a big deal, but there are shows where the cards stack up. Hard Justice is usually one, as is Destination X, and that's why they made my Big Four.\n\nThey're nothing shows. There's nothing difference between Destination X, Genesis, Turning Point or any of the other 9 shows they put on. You know Destination X will feature an Ultimate X match, but that's an undercard match and it appears on other shows as well.\n\nI'd say the Big Four are the following :\n\nDestination X - As you said NSL, while it does not get billed as a huge pay per view for them, it usually ends up as one.\n\nSlammiversary - When I first started watching TNA I believed this was their Wrestlemania until someone actually said on air that Bound For Glory was Wrestlemania for them. It essentially reminds me of the Rumble as it usually has that big time feel going into it and usually sets up the feuds for Bound For Glory.\n\nBound For Glory - TNA's Wrestlemania. This show has always turned out great and always has a huge card. This past year was the best Bound For Glory yet in my opinion. Sure we all think Sting may not be retiring, but not it was nice to see him lose at BFG for once.\n\nAgainst All Odds - While it is leading up to Destination X and takes place in the new year I believe this to be their fourth. While Final Resolution is the last pay per view of every year I feel like TNA's \" year \" so to speak starts with Against All Odds. I believe this pay per view to be the start of the year and start of new feuds for the year coming off Turning Point, Final Resolution, and Genesis. I believe this pay per view to be the one where the feuds of the previous year end and the new ones begin. Again, while it does not always have a huge card or a very good one, the show has always turned out quite well in my opinion.\n\nAgainst All Odds - While it is leading up to Destination X and takes place in the new year I believe this to be their fourth. While Final Resolution is the last pay per view of every year I feel like TNA's \" year \" so to speak starts with Against All Odds. I believe this pay per view to be the start of the year and start of new feuds for the year coming off Turning Point, Final Resolution, and Genesis. I believe this pay per view to be the one where the feuds of the previous year end and the new ones begin. Again, while it does not always have a huge card or a very good one, the show has always turned out quite well in my opinion.\n\nI'd have to agree with this. The WWE \"year\" does not end at Armageddon, or whatever they named it, so TNA's doesn't need to either. I'd actually say NoC is WWE's \"year end\" PPV, because it wraps up feuds, and kicks off others. Against All Odds does that for TNA as well.\n\nBut, is it the PPV that makes that time of year big, or is it the Impact shows surrounding it? The stories are mostly told on Thursdays, with the PPV being the \"climax\" of everything going on. I'd say it's important, but I don't know if it's a \"big one\" yet.\n\nI think I'll have to agree with Jake and say Lockdown is one of the big 4.\n\nYeah, more often than not it's not a great show. But it's definately one of the most remembered TNA PPV's, probably because of how insane (good and bad) it is. If I had to list off TNA PPV's off the top of my head, it would probably go Bound for Glory, Slammaversary and Lockdown. It's just a PPV that casual fans know the name of and know the idea behind. And for some people it's a big deal PPV because of all the gimmick matches. Alot of feuds also have their last matches (or should I say last rematches) in one of the six sides of steel gimmick matches.\n\nIt's like how the Royal Rumble PPV is known for the Royal Rumble match, Lockdown is known for all the gimmick twists on regular cage matches.\n\nBut, is it the PPV that makes that time of year big, or is it the Impact shows surrounding it? The stories are mostly told on Thursdays, with the PPV being the \"climax\" of everything going on. I'd say it's important, but I don't know if it's a \"big one\" yet.\n\nGood point NSL. I'd have to say that it's the Impact shows. The things that happen leading to the pay per view are what make the pay per view big. The stories surrounding it are what make the pay per views big. It has nothing to do with the time of year really. If Wrestlemania were to be held in August would it still be as important? If Bound For Glory were held in April or March would it too still be important?\n\nEssentially any pay per view could become a part of the big four. It just depends on which pay per views have the major storylines happening heading into it. For example, if Sting's retirement match were to take place at Final Resolution. Would that make it one of the big four for that year? I certainly think so.\n\nGenesis is now, because last year it was made to be a big deal. It has Angle/Jarrett 2, Foley's TNA in-ring debut and Shelley/Sabin. Plus it was outside the iMPACT! Zone. That counts for something.\n\nTo be fair though, TNA has a Big 3 and then everything else. WWE has a big 4 because of The Rumble, Survivor Series, Summerslam and WrestleMania because they started with JUST those PPVs. However, TNA went right to 12 once they switched to weekly TV.\n\nLockdown, Slammiversary and Bound For Glory are ALWAYS done outside of Orlando since 2007. So thus, TNA has a big 3, not a big 4.\n\nIn my opinion, TNA only has 3 &#8220;Big&#8221; PPVs, Lockdown, Slammiversary, and Bound For Glory. All the other PPVs either took place at Orlando only, or have taken place outside of the Impact! Zone just once (2008). Now I know that&#8217;s not a valid reason, but any PPV that takes place in the Impact! Zone doesn&#8217;t have that &#8220;Big Event&#8221; feel to it. It feels more like a Sunday 3 hour Impact special than a PPV. If I had to pick a forth, then I'd go with Victory Road, only because it was the first PPV, but that's it.\n\nBound For Glory is their Wrestlemania. They have almost entirely clean finishes and most feuds begin and end there, very few continue past it. The wrestlers bust their ass to another level akin to WWE guys at Wrestlemania.\n\nLockdown is their second biggest for me. I consider it like WWE's survivor series in that it's roughly 6 months apart fro BFG and it's got high stakes. I know a lot of people don't like the every match in a cage gimmick but I'm a fan. You get a bad match or two at every PPV, you can't blame the gimmick. Look at Joe/Angle if you require proof of the status of the event. Plus Lethal Lockdown is like an old school survivor series match as you split the heels and faces definitively and face them off against each other.\n\nSlammiversary is like Summerslam. It's a fun event but also has magnitude. The King of the Mountain matches always deliver. Summerslam has featured a lot of Ladder matches so I think the comparison is apt. They have a lot of big rivalries at Slammiversary.\n\nThe fourth though... tough to say. A lot of them are transitional. Hard Justice has had some big matches over the years, as has Victory Road. Destination X normally hosts an Ultimate X.\n\nJust for the sake of being different I'm going to say Genesis as well, but I honestly have no clue why, it just sticks out to me. Angle/Joe, Angle/Jarrett, just a memorable PPV for me.\n\nSlammiversary and Bound For Glory are there by default. I'd count Lockdown too, but considering how they used its signature match, Lethal Lockdown outside of it, it gives me the feeling we may not see it again. Destination X could fit. It always ends up having a big card, not to mention it always feature's an Ultimate X match. So we could qualify that. Against All Odds had the Feast Or Fired match last year so it could also fit. However now that they have the TNA Global Championship, it may not return this year.\n\nIf you ask me, they should create a new PPV that will determine the #1 Contender for the TNA World title for BFG. It could feature the Fight For The Right tournament. Without the \"reverse\" battle royal of course.\n\nSo let me make my official picks:\n\n1) Bound For Glory\n\n2) Slammiversary\n\n3) Lockdown\n\n4) Destination X\n\nI'd say the Big Four are:\n\nBound For Glory: Despite what it draws in attendance and in PPV buys, this show is marketed by TNA throughout the year as their biggest show. Lots of big matches take place here, and it is a show where Sting has dominated, up to the past year. They even took a big risk and held it in the West Coast this year...only such a risk would be taken for their main show.\n\nLockdown: Tons of blowoff feuds have taken place within the six sides of steel. There have been some memorable matches here also: AJ Styles / Abyss (2006), Kurt Angle / Samoa Joe (2008), and most recently Sting / Mick Foley (2009). The Lethal Lockdown matchup is always exciting and different every year, with a great build and always nonstop action that leaves the fans satisfied.\n\nDestination X: This show has seen the most appearances by the Ultimate X match on any PPV, and has given us two Elevation X (scaffold) matches as well. It is where Christopher Daniels won his first X Division belt in 2005, and where Jeff Hardy and Abyss put on a memorable Falls Count Anywhere match in the same year. Overall, the show is usually focused on the X Division in general and hardly disappoints.\n\nSlammiversary: The annual celebration of TNA's founding and continuing existence. The King of the Mountain match is always intriguing, and it is an event that Kurt Angle has won twice for the TNA World title. Who can forget the classy package TNA put together for the passing of Jeff Jarrett's wife in the 2007 event, or the controversy in 2006 when a heel Double J won the World title with help from the referee. I always remember what Mike Tenay said after Jarrett hung up the belt to win: \"The words we hate to hear more than any other in the English language, yes, Jeff Jarrett has become the NWA World Heavyweight Champion!\"\n\nSo those are my picks...mostly because of personal memories alone...but also because big things have always taken place at these 4 PPVs almost every year...\n\nI thought I had already responded to this thread long ago, but apparently not. So.... here are what I think TNA's Big 4 are.\n\n1. Bound For Glory\n\nThis is TNA's \"Wrestlemania\". The biggest show of the year (according to the hype, anyway) and it is always one of the most entertaining shows of the year. Easily the #1 show for TNA.\n\n2. Lockdown\n\nIt probably falls to #3 or 4 in terms of hype.... but every year Lockdown seems to do the best out of any TNA show, including Bound For Glory. Having every match be the same gimmick is not always my cup of tea, but this is one of the best shows of the year every year.\n\n3. Slammiversary\n\nGoing by the hype, this is TNA's 2nd biggest show. They have hyped it almost as much as Bound For Glory. This is more or less TNA's \"Summerslam\" as it is their big show of the summer. It doesn't seem to ever live up to the hype for some reason and never does as well as it should for a show as over-hyped as it is. However, it is still in the top tier regardless of that.\n\n4. Destination X\n\n#4 was a tough pick, but I give it to Destination X. Something about has that \"huge show feel\" to it, and it has often been among the more entertaining shows of the year.\n\nThe top tier were a no-brainer.... but all the rest of TNA's PPV's seem too similar sometimes, and that is why it was a bit harder to pick what I think their #4 show is. Anyways, that is what I think their Big 4 are."
