        "text": "Just wrapped up \"Game Development Patterns with Unity 2021\" by David Baron, and what a game-changer! As a game developer at Genesis Creations S.A.E, I've faced my fair share of coding challenges, often wrestling with architectural solutions that led to a few questionable design decisions. That's when I realized the power of design patterns in shaping robust solutions. Seeking guidance, I explored various resources on design patterns. However, many took a generalized approach, leaving me uncertain about their application within game development—until I stumbled upon this gem of a book. \"Game Development Patterns with Unity 2021\" not only provided clarity but seamlessly connected the dots between design patterns and the intricate world of game development. It transformed my approach to coding by illustrating how to implement design patterns in games, completely altering my coding style. Now, organizing my code to be adaptable feels like an adventure, not a chore! This read opened my eyes to a plethora of new game design ideas using different patterns. It's a resource I'd recommend to any game dev eager to elevate their codebase! #GameDev #Unity #DesignPatterns\n\nHello, Unity commUnity!👋🏻 Today we're going to talk about MVC and MVP patterns. In Unity game development 🎮, choosing the right architectural pattern is crucial. Today, we'll compare two very similar ones: Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-Presenter (MVP). Let's compare these patterns to understand their differences and determine the best choice for your Unity projects. Let's take a look at the components of these patterns: ✳️ Model: Data for display. ✳️ View: User interface. The only MonoBehaviour in this trio. ✳️ Controller/Presenter: Responsible for all business logic and responds to user input. ✨ The main difference between these two patterns lies in their connections. In the case of applying the MVC pattern, you will have more connections. In MVP, only the Presenter has a connection with the Model and View, taking all the responsibility. In MVC, besides the Controller having references to the Model and View, the View also has a reference to the Model. What does such a seemingly insignificant difference give us at first glance❓ ✨ MVP reduces coupling by having the Presenter act as a mediator between the Model and the View, simplifying testing and enhancing separation of concerns. In MVC, while the Controller handles user input and updates the Model and View, the View directly accesses the Model, potentially leading to tighter coupling and more complex relationships. ✨ In MVP, changes to the Model don't directly affect the View, promoting better isolation and testability. On the other hand, in MVC, changes to the Model can directly impact the View, which might lead to unexpected behaviors and maintenance challenges. In conclusion, MVP typically offers better decoupling and testability, making it suitable for larger projects or when clarity in responsibilities is paramount. MVC can be simpler to implement and understand, making it a good choice for smaller projects or when rapid development is needed. Thus, depending on the project's scale, complexity, and requirements, you can choose between MVC and MVP to achieve an optimal architectural design for your Unity game development. Sometimes, both of them can be encountered in projects. #unity #gamedev #architecture #mvc #mvp\n\nWhile No Code is mainly used for creating software and applications, some tools allow you to make games.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned professional, these tools can help you bring your game ideas to life without writing a single line of code. Will you try to create a game with these No-Code game engines? #GameDevelopment #NoCode #GameEngines\n\nLooking to Jumpstart Your Game Development? Why Buying Unity Source Codes Can Be a Game-Changer! 🎮🚀 In the fast-paced world of game development, starting from scratch is often daunting and time-consuming. Here’s why purchasing Unity game source codes could be your best move: 👉 Faster Development: Leveraging existing codes can significantly reduce your game's time to market. 👉 Learning Opportunity: Analyzing and modifying advanced code is a phenomenal way to enhance your coding skills. 👉 Cost Efficiency: Invest in assets, not just development. Save resources by adapting pre-built frameworks to your needs. I remember when I first started in game development, purchasing a Unity source code for a side project not only saved me weeks of initial development but also improved my understanding of robust coding practices. This head start was instrumental in launching my own custom features sooner than planned. Curious to explore some top-tier source codes? Check out 🌐 https://gameosophy.net/ for a variety of options! 📣 **Engage & Share:** What’s your take on buying vs. building game codes? Ever had an experience with source codes boosting your project? Drop your insights below! 👇 #Unity3D #GameDevelopment #IndieDev #UnityAssets #GameDesign #DevCommunity #Coding #GameDev #Programming #TechTalks\n\nMy opinion on Godot 4 as a game engine has shifted from \"seems interesting\" to \"would recommend.\" For small-scale projects, it has what you need. If you want to go deeper, this is the book that got me up to speed on its concepts and architecture. I recommend it as well, especially for experienced developers. Plus! I can't overstate the value of source code access. I've personally detonated Unity's physics engine in a production environment, to the point where the only answer was a source code fix... source code I didn't have access to! Implementing a jury-rigged solution cost the company tens of thousands of dollars in design, development, testing, and iteration time. With Godot, I could have actually, you know, fixed it. #books #gamedevelopment #godot #unity\n\nAt times, it may seem like not much is happening, but don't be fooled. What you're watching represents three to four days of dedicated work, spanning various topics and features. You might find it hard to believe, but my coding was nearly flawless, except for one persistent Unity error that eluded me for two days. The challenge revolved around a seemingly minor detail: getting that counter to move smoothly downward. This experience underscores the importance of patience in game development. Progress may seem incremental, but I'm steadily moving forward. #unity3d #unity2d #unitydeveloper #gamedevelopment #Csharp\n\n🕹️ Calling all Unity game developers! 🚀 Are you on the hunt for top-notch open-source projects on GitHub to enhance your game development skills?
