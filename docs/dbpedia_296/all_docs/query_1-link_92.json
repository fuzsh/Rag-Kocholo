        "text": "We know when IMPACT locked in the decision to return to their brand’s roots.\n\nAs IMPACT Bound For Glory was ending, it was announced that TNA Wrestling would return on January 13, 2024 with TNA Hard To Kill. The promotion was named this from 2004 to 2017, when they rebranded to IMPACT Wrestling.\n\nPWInsider now reports that this decision was not done on a whim, and a lot of thought was put into the re-branding. It was also reported that new title belts will be ready for the re-branding.\n\nTNA returning was a move that wasn’t made without a lot of planning and at one point, the announcement was tentatively slated to be made back at Slammiversary. The final decision to flip the switch back to TNA was locked in about 2-3 weeks back.\n\nThere will be new TNA Championship belts rolled out with the current titleholders using those belts instead. The new belts have already been crafted and produced, but they aren’t likely to be used until January.\n\nPWInsider\n\nTNA Hard to Kill will emanate from The Palms in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nFollow Corey at @CoreyBrennanBS on Twitter\n\nIf you enjoy Bodyslam’s content, you can help donate to the site here.
