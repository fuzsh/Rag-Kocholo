        "text": "Its time to learn more about The Notorious 187 then you have ever heard before. Opening up to John and Chad of The Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling, former Ring of Honor Champion and TNA Superstar Homicide gives his take on his last Impact Wrestling run and what went wrong with the BDC. He also takes us all on a journey back to his intense rivalry in ROH with Steve Corino as well as the CZW vs. ROH feud which culminated in a huge POP that nearly blew up Ring of Honor. We also find out from Homicide how he aspires to be a trainer of the stars of the future and how he feels that he can offer a lot to WWE NXT from a coaching capacity. Also as a passionate New York Yankees fan Homicide debates the Mets/Yankees rivalry and turns his attention to Boston.\n\nFull Episode Download Link:\n\nhttp://tmptow.podoma…T21_00_00-07_00\n\nHomicide Talks CM Punk’s Meteoric Rise & Punk’s Ribbing\n\nBecoming a trainer post retirement and his next run being his last:\n\nI think I would bring back what professional wrestling was supposed to be like. I know it’s sports entertainent and it’s about marketing and I would bring none of the cookie cutter, I would bring realistic out there and people could say I don’t know if this is real or fake. When I trained I trained like the way Fit Finally and Steven Regal wrestled, but I don’t do none of that stuff on TV or on the Independents. But now it’s different as I make my comeback, I’m changing my style. But I would teach them to be aggressive, to have guts and not to quit and just be the best. I’ve got so much knowledge and so many ideas that I could bring. I’ve been telling people on the Independents to look for the hard camera and not just look to the left or the right, there’s a reason why. It’s little things like that and I think I’m good with it and I’m very confident that I could be one of those big time scouts, agents or whatever. I’m going to be one of those guys in the futue. First I’m going to have my last run and my comeback and then afterwards I am going to go behind the scenes.\n\nWhat went wrong with TNA and how did it change over the time:\n\nThe first time I went there it was pretty awesome. The staff, the camera crews and the people who write the books but when Hogan and Eric Bischoff came in everything just changed. I was one of those guys that was like when if you’ve ever seen the old Dave Chappelle sketch “When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong” well I was one of those guys who kept it real but sometimes in professional wrestling, especially corporate wrestling you need to play the games. Meaning sometimes you have to be quiet and sometimes you need to not say things. I would just outburst and didn’t care. I didnt care if I got fired. But when I did get released it felt like freedom and like I was a slave, almost because when Hogan and Eric Bischoff came in it was like everthing was different and a lot of people were scared of losing their jobs. When I got released it was like I got woken up I had people like The Dudley Boyz, Konnan and my teacher Manny Fernandez teaching me about the game about corporate wrestling and how it really is. I look back and say maybe I made a mistake just going out there and I didn’t care. Now, I am getting older and the way the wrestling industry is right now you need to keep you job and you’ve got to be quiet and just have to play along.\n\nHas he heard from TNA since his last run:\n\nI’ve got respect for TNA. Even though if they are doing bad because I don’t hear anything from them anymore. If they are doing good or bad, I’ve got respect for them because I had a lot of fun with those guys.\n\nThe BDC (The Beat Down Clan) and the calamity that led to the end of the group:\n\nMe and MVP and Low Ki go way back. We love the Wu Tang Clan, the Japanese culture of wrestling even anything Jiu-Jitsu. I made a joke and said we were like the Wu Tang Clan of pro wrestling and that joke became something. Myself, Samoa Joe, MVP and Low Ki just got together with the blue print of it and we knew we were different and we spoke to the management of TNA. Suddenly things were not going well. I got injured, I had a bad shoulder since my Ring of Honor days. Then Samoa Joe had the “guys from Connecticut”. The WWE was looking at him and they gave him a great offer. So, so many things just came out. When things got a little more hectic we had our good friend Kenny King (who I think is the most underrated wrestler right now) and we brought my former LAX partner Hernandez from Lucha Underground coming back to TNA and still things didn’t go very well so we just broke it off. But we feel in spirit that we are the Beat Down Clan inside the locker room of course. But we wanted to make this bigger and so big that we would go to Japan and face The Bullet Club because that is the hottest faction right now in Pro Wrestling.\n\nA dream feud of The BDC vs. The Bullet Club and who would Homicide love to face:\n\nI love AJ Styles, I faced AJ Styles so many times and actually him with Christopher Daniels had great feuds with LAX. The Young Bucks are guys that are just keeping it real and I love them. But, I would say Tonga, the face paint, I know his brother and I actually trained with him at the Dudleys school in Kissimmee, Florida. He is very talented and I’d like to face him because I think he is the one who is going to break through. After AJ, The Young Bucks and all the guys in the group I think Tonga is the one who is going to break through it all.\n\nHomicide also gives extreme detail about his feuds in Ring of Honor, the intense rivalry with Steve Corino, how ROH has changed since he first debuted with the company, heat with Dan Maff, Winning the X-Division title, his love of baseball and how his John Sterling Home Run Call would sound.\n\nWhen it comes to playing a super-natural character Kevin Fertig is in a class by himself. Today the superstar formerly known as Kevin Thorn and the mysterious Mordecai takes The Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling on a bone chilling stroll into the genesis and conception of two of the most unique characters the WWE has created in the last fifth-teen years. John, Chad and Kevin dive into the story behind the fascinating Mordecai character that clearly was built to be made for a massive feud with The Undertaker in 2004 and how WWE’s start and stop booking caused Fertig to grow frustrated with the politics of management. We also get an insightful look into the re-launch of ECW on SyFy and now playing Kevin Thron where was headed before being repackaged and consequently dropped. Listen to the stories and feel the vicious bite of Kevin Fertig.\n\nFull Episode Download Link:\n\nhttp://tmptow.podoma…T21_00_00-07_00\n\nKevin Fertig on The Origin of Mordecai & The Proposed Undertaker Feud\n\nHow WWE invests time and money into Development and NXT versus when he competed:\n\nWhen I was in the gym I was watching some NXT, I was watching Baron Corbin. It’s crazy because I started at Power Pro which was kind of like USWA and so many guys came through there and I remember the rings from the Power Pro days and the USWA days that the rings were basically about to fall apart. They were water-hose and wire and went up and down the roads. Granted we did have live TV on Memphis Channel 5 which is to this day is one of the greatest wrestling television programs for ratings ever. When I got into Ohio Valley Wrestling, Jim Cornette tried to use Ohio Valley Wrestling as a way to put talents in Royal Rumbles and different ways to bring the championship up and it was always kyboshed. Cornette always had the mind for that if the developmental talent are stronger stars now, then they are only going to be stronger stars when they get up to the WWE. To me that’s a huge thing. That’s something to Hunter’s credit he is trying to do. These guys are already on video games and here it is, they haven’t even done anything yet for WWE and they are on the new video games and talking about action figures, they’ve got t-shirt sales now. They are already stars coming out of the gate. Hell, their Twitter followers are in upwards of 40,000 which unheard of but they are known.\n\nThe lack of effort in presenting a quality brand in OVW:\n\nI remember our 8x10s. I laugh at the photo quality of what we had. It was basically everyone stood in front of a black screen, took a quick picture and they printed it on a cheap piece of paper and they sold it for two/three bucks. These guys have got freakin’ beautiful 8x10s and they are giving them out and signing them and selling t-shirts. Back in the OVW days it was a freakin’ jam box that played the entrance music. With a curtain that was basically made out of two bed sheets. There was no guard rails. The production quality of what they have now as compared to what we had is insane.\n\nAre the changes directly the Evolution of WWE as a brand or an Evolution of the Pro Wrestling business:\n\nI think that’s just the way the evolution of the business has gone. There are no territories. When I was coming up, I think a lot of these guys would have been eaten alive by the likes of The Dudleyz and Bradshaw because at that time it was sink or swim. You had Bob Holly and Billy Gunn, these veterans that had been around and who were around when business was cut-throat and deadly. They instilled that in a lot of us. I was reading the Rene Dupree article that you guys did and he was saying that Bob beat him up and all that other stuff and that’s unfortunately the nature of the beast at that time. I remember guys getting their sh*t cut, glued stuff in their bags and now it’s so corporate that kind of stuff does not go on. It’s just a different age I guess. Is it better? I dont know, I kind of like coming in with your butt clenched a little bit wondering what was going to happen or who is going to fight. It was always an interesting day just making sure you weren’t the last guy to have heat on you, as long as you weren’t the last it was never that bad.\n\nDid Rene Dupree have instant heat when arriving at OVW:\n\nHe was a kid that looked like an Adonis. I remember when Rene came in down in OVW, I was like holy crap because he looked phenomenal and right out of the gate he already had a pedigree because of his Dad and where he had been. He was a ten year “vet” coming in at eight-teen/nineteen years old, he was already there as far as being around enough of “the boys” to kind of carry himself in that manner to me and I think that is what got him some heat. Some of the older guys just didn’t get why he was carrying himself in that manner and granted he should have. I always thought Rene was a hell of a talent.\n\nHas modern day wrestling passed Vince McMahon by:\n\nIt’s one of those things where Vince is a hard guy to get to know. Unless you are a John Cena or The Undertaker or Hunter, those are the only guys who kind of knew Vince, you know those top guys like Hogan and Randy Savage back in the day. At what point do you care? It’s kind of like Howard Hughes, he’s got to have his peas a certain way. He’s got a mind for it somehow. The basic concept of wrestling is never going to change. Good versus Evil. I think he proved a lot back in the Austin days of having the tweener heel as the good guy but still kind of a bad guy, I think that revolutionized the business for sure.\n\nBeing pitched the re-launch of ECW and introducing Kevin Thorn:\n\nAt the time Tommy Dreamer was with Talent Relations and I had just been signed back and he was talking about they were going to redo ECW. But the problem was it’s going to be on SyFy and SyFy wants Zombies, Aliens and all this other sh*t. About a year prior to that they were talking about bringing me, Gangrel and Shelly (Martinez) as being a vampire tag team. Tommy asked if I still had the vampire gear that I had bought and said that I was going to need it. He said they want you to be a vampire and at that time just getting signed back and not having a place on the roster, I didn’t care what they wanted to make me at that point. I would have done whatever. The vampire thing was something that was always cool and something that I really enjoyed. But Gangrel probably did it the best out of anybody back in his days with Luna, but you can never go wrong being a vampire.\n\nHis chemistry and relationship with Shelly Martinez:\n\nNow it’s great, then it was different, a little bit of different agendas at the time but when we finally started getting it going the rug got pulled out from underneath us. Look wise, she’s incredible. Good looking girl, had a different look, she’s not your average Barbie-blonde “diva”. I would associate her to like Paige now in the way she looks. I think the Diva division now has become Barbie-cut-outs for the most part, within reason.\n\nThe ECW Originals role in the new ECW and the WrestleMania match of The New Breed vs. Originals:\n\nThey were all cool. They came in and everybody was a good time that’s for sure. Sabu and RVD were so talented with all their different stuff, but like Sandman a couple of times I was like why? But it’s so cool to just walk through the crowd, crush a couple of cans of beer, throw your kendo stick and you are over. Who wouldn’t want that role? But then he’s getting in the ring, it just wasn’t there sometimes and just like holy crap come on. But anyone would want to be as over as him throwing up a beer and walking through the crowd. Everybody came in thinking they were going to be a part of the second coming of ECW and as they got into it, it was like it’s not going to be that ECW we remember. But WrestleMania was awesome. Walking in front of that crowd was insane. You look out and its like a sea of people and you hear the crowd and it just like rolls, it starts at the front and just rolls to the back and then come back to the front and is like a wave of noise. For a while though we didn’t even know we were going to have the match. Time restraints made it that we didn’t even know we would have the match because a couple of times matches went over and our ten minute match went to like six minutes and then our six minute match went to four and when were out there we got five. I get to say I was in WrestleMania but it was a little nerve-wracking at the beginning. I love the match at WrestleMania but I think the match in Fort Wayne when we had as the rematch was ten times better with all the gimmicks. Had we had that match at WrestleMania we would have stolen the show.\n\nKevin Fertig also discusses the end of his run with WWE, why Kevin Thorn was repackaged, signing back to WWE and being assigned to FCW, his thoughts on Mordecai, the reason the angle with Undertaker was dropped, Paul Heymans influence and his comeback from vital surgeries needed to save his push.\n\nToday The Two Man Power Trip is joined by the very outspoken and often controversial Jamie Dundee. John and Chad gear up for a no-nonsense, pull-no-punches conversation with the man known as JC Ice as he embarks on getting back into the wrestling ring on the Independent Scene. Dundee also gives his uncensored take on all the hot topics in professional wrestling including NXT, the Hulk Hogan racism allegations and his thoughts on Vince McMahon.\n\nFull Episode Download Link:\n\nhttp://tmptow.podoma…T21_00_00-07_00\n\nJamie Dundee Shoots Hard On Tag Teams Stealing PG-13’s Gimmick:\n\nGetting back in the ring:\n\nIt’s one of those things where I don’t give a f*ck I guess that’s what all wrestlers do. We either die in a hotel by OD’ing but I quit getting high and doing cocaine about seven years ago, so I guess we just die in the ring. I’ve looked in the paper every f*cking Sunday and not one ad says “WANTED” used washed-up wrestler, nowhere does it say that. If that was the case there would be a lot of guys like Ric Flair and Razor Ramon they would all have jobs still, but not one ad in the paper says washed-up, used-up, has-been wrestler. So I guess I’ve got to go do what I know, I f*cking hate it, I hate the wrestling business today, I hate getting in the car, I hate the driving part so I have to drink a lot of beer and go wrestle. I just can’t stand it.\n\nThe current state of the wrestling business:\n\nI ain’t never watched wrestling unless I’m on the tape. If I’m not on the show I ain’t got to f*cking watch it. Once I see me, I think I’m the best, I love me, I think I’m the f*cking greatest so once I see me I don’t want to watch anybody else. I guess that’s because of growing up in the wrestling business. I bet Dale Earnhardt Jr. doesn’t watch Nascar. But today it’s not the wrestling kids fault, they just want to f*cking wrestle. Vince McMahon has taken it to a place where I heard he went to bed a billionaire and woke up a millionaire. When you lose three-hundred million in a 24 hour period if he does that two more times he’s broke.\n\nDid he see wrestling evolving to what we see now:\n\nIt’s like anything the f*cking mafia, magic, wrestling, the circus. Once you let the outside world in you’ve f*cking killed it. I knew David Copperfield didn’t make the Statue of Liberty disappear but I didn’t want to know how he did it because I saw it disappear and I loved it and I didn’t care how he did it. Same with wrestling, if the people can f*cking turn the TV on and call the match then obviously why would you pay to see it. It’s like everyone knew wrestling was a work but they didn’t know how. Once you let the outside world in and by making a show called Tough Enough or by doing other things that Vince McMahon did. But he doesn’t give a f*ck about what I’m saying driving to Tullehoma, Tennessee because he’s got a billion dollars in the bank. The wrestlers, there are hundreds of guys that can’t get a job because they are wrestlers and coming from the old school they knew if there character wouldn’t do certain things so Vince McMahon said f*ck you, I’ll make somebody that can do that. It’s not the wrestling guys fault.\n\nIs all the responsibility aimed at Vince McMahon:\n\nI’ve always said he has a video game with real people. He’s killed them, he’s discarded them, he’s OD’ed them. He’s done everything you do in video games. Grand Theft Auto is no different than Vince McMahon playing with real people.\n\nRecent controversies involving racism and racist comments surrounding pro wrestling:\n\nThere is not a mother f*cker on this planet that can tell me that a white person on this planet has never used the “n” word or a black woman who has neveas never used the “n” word or a black womanr said “honky-ass”, “cracker-ass-bitch” not anyone ever can say they’ve never said that because they are full of sh*t. Whether it’s behind closed doors, by themselves, during sex whatever it may be. I saw some chick from WWE just got fired because she had a My Little Pony with a “swastika” on it, and its Seth Rollins old lady. If you are going to f*cking fire her over a picture that was from three years ago on a Facebook page then they need to fire the whole f*cking crew, the camera crew and Vince McMahon needs to fire himself. There isn’t a mother f*cker on this planet that has done sh*t like that never thinking of consequences in the future.\n\nDid he get into the wrestling business simply following in his father Bill Dundees footsteps:\n\nNo, never. A wrestler doesn’t want to wrestle and as a second generation wrestler I hated wrestling. I liked wrestling when I would go to wrestling, I liked that people would touch me and tell me how great I was and since I was eight years old I would sell kisses to fat chicks for $1. I knew how to “manipulize” and it’s hard to separate the fantasy world from the real world and that’s what happens to the wrestlers who OD in hotel rooms. Everybody wants that one more shot. My brother-in-law played a video for me of Michael Hayes singing to Terry Gordy’s grave and it’s great but everybody wants to go back and everyone would love to go back to the greatest time in their life but we can’t.\n\nLiving the lifestyle of a wrestler from a very young age.\n\nIt’s a different world we live in today. My father was raised by a man who was born in 1891 or some sh*t and my Dad was born in 1943 and he went from Scotland to Australia when he was 13 years old so he was/is a tough task-master type of a f*cking guy. So I didn’t like the guy and we didn’t get along but I was a wild child and of course I would be. I’m around people that are telling me how great I am and sending me money and drugs. When I was 4 years old my Dad and Tommy Rich got me drunk and pierced my ear, so in 1975 when I went to Kindergarten my teachers said I can’t wear that earing, well why not? My Daddy put it there. Youve got to understand that I lived in Hendersonville, Tennessee and our neighbors were Conway Twitty, The Oakridge Boys and Johnny Cash so in that world we were the outsiders. We had motorcycles and pit-bulls but my old man made more money a week then they did.\n\nWorking for Jerry Lawler and Jerry Jarrett:\n\nLawler paid good and Jarrett kept all the f*cking money. The reason being is I guess because Jerry had to pay for Jeff and Jennifer and Jason and Lawler was one of the boys so he knew how to take care of the guys. But Lawler was also anti-drug and everything you did seemed like it was never right for Jerry Lawler. Now the wrestling part and the angles that drew money, he definitely would give you your props but as far as anything else it seemed like every time I would see him he would be mocking you.\n\nDoes he have a favorite memory of Lawler vs. Dundee:\n\nYeah of course, I remember waking up and my Dad was bald and when I woke up my Mom was bald and I thought well f*ck me and my sister were next in line. What are you all doing bald? In their credit it was 1979 and they paid my mom ten or fifth-teen grand and a house back then cost about eight grand so two f*cking houses? No b*tch on this planet wouldn’t shave their head right now.\n\nJamie Dundee also gives further uncensored and intense comments regarding racism in wrestling, whether or not he felt that Nation of Domination was fueled by racism, Hulk Hogans exile from WWE, his tag team with Wolfie D as PG-13, wrestling with WWE and the schedule, tag team imposters, The Rock N Roll Express and more on getting back into the ring.\n\nToday John and Chad are joined by Bobby Horne FKA Mo from Men On A Mission for an episode of The Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling that continues to take the phrase “straight-shoot” to a new level. Giving not only his honest take on the current happenings surrounding the lawsuits brought forward against WWE by former superstars and the widow of his former tag partner but also and quite candidly gives a lengthy look back at his career that took him through Memphis and into the WWF alongside his tag team partner, the monstrous Nelson Frazier aka Mabel. Mo also presents a scenario that saw M.O.M being held back from receiving a push because of supposed substance abuse and how Shawn Michaels took nine-months of Mo’s career and led him right into the dog-house of WWF management.\n\nFull Episode Download Link:\n\nhttp://tmptow.podoma…T21_00_00-07_00\n\nMo From Men On A Mission Talks The Four Doinks at Survivor Series 1993:\n\nFormer wrestlers and Nelson Frazier’s wife holding Vince McMahon liable for medical issues and forcing performers to work hurt:\n\nI’ve really thought about that myself, even with some medical issues that I’ve had myself and basically I worked there for three years and I’ve never seen Vince McMahon force anybody to do anything they didn’t want to do. I’ve never seen Vince McMahon ask anyone to work hurt, though I’ve done it before myself. As far as taking care of talent after they leave the company, I think its a great and noble thing, the whole drug rehab thing. The medical stuff, I don’t think he should be held responsible for that simply because and here’s the deal, Nelson and I wrestled in this business for more than three years before the WWE, then there is all the years after it so if we wrestled three years together in WWE and the whole three years that we wrestled there we worked every day, every month and we didn’t sustain any major injuries the whole three years we were there.\n\nHolding the business responsible rather than one single promoter:\n\nThere’s a million and one of us guys that worked for Vince and worked for Turner and worked for Crocket and worked for Bill Watts and worked for Joe sh*t- the-rag-bag Promoter or Jeff to-the Left and Eddie damn- Spaghetti and in some way taken a chance and got hurt or whatever. Ten years removed from working for Vince McMahon we are sick, we are broke down, we may even die but should Vince McMahon be held liable for that? Or should we have a list of every single promoter that each one of us worked for and include every single one of those into that lawsuit?\n\nBackstage incident with Shawn Michaels:\n\nWe were overseas in Israel, it was during Passover and one night we were at an event and Nelson fainted in the hallway. So since we were overseas they wouldn’t take him to a hospital so they just took Nelson back to the hotel and we were working a program at the time against The Headshrinkers. The agent comes to me and the agent said Mo you are going to work a singles match against Samu from the Headshrinkers and Fatu is not going to work at all. Fatu didn’t like that idea, he was pissed off, he was ranting and raving about it and I’m standing there going over the match with Samu and Shawn Michaels comes out of the shower and he hit me in the back harder then I’ve ever been hit on the football field, he just knocked the hell out of me. The operative word from me was excuse-me and his response was f*ck excuse me, you guys have no work ethic. He said you young guys come up here with no f*cking work ethic and your f*cking partner fell down in the hall way, all he had to do was get his fat ass up and walk to the ring and you do all the work and there would be a tag match tonight instead of the bullsh*t singles match. He thought Nelson should have sucked it up, went to the ring and stood on the side and work because the kind of tag match we worked, I take the heat anyway. So that’s what he was pissed off about and he took it out on me. My response was being the man that I am is if you put your hands on me again, I’m gonna beat your f*cking-ass. Did I pay for it? Yeah, dearly. What did it get me? It got me pulled off TV for nine months and I had to travel on the road for nine months and not work. In that nine months I got highly depressed and I attempted suicide.\n\nWWE not recognizing Men On A Missions Tag Team Championship win:\n\nThere were a couple of matches on TV where for example me against Owen Hart that it was mentioned about the tag team championship on TV. I think Ted Dibiase and Stan Lane were doing the commentary and Stan Lane always pushed that and always put that over. It was mentioned a couple of times on TV but it just kind of faded away.\n\nThe backstory as to why the title win is not addressed:\n\nDuring the “New Generation” era at the same time Vince McMahon was having the steroid trial. So of course, we were getting drug tested two or three times a week and back then in that era if you failed a drug test and if it was like a steroid or cocaine thing or a narcotic failure of a drug test you immediately got suspended. But, if you failed a drug test, first offense and you had marijuana in your system (THC) you would get fined. Up to a certain point maybe your fifth or sixth violation you were suspended. A member of our team, which will remain nameless loved smoking the wacky-weed, loved it and because they loved it JJ Dillon came to me one day and said “Lets just say, we put the tag team gold on a particular tag team and we put the titles on you Sunday and then you go to a house show on Monday and fail a drug test and one member of the tag team has to be suspended, why are we going to take a chance or risk of putting the tag team titles on somebody if there is a possibility of one member of the team getting suspended” and that was the hold back right there.\n\nTaking the hit when your team is under fire:\n\nAt some point you’ve got to take responsibility for yourself and you’ve got to tell the truth and the truth is whether it’s Men On A Mission or the Hardy Boyz or the Dudley Boyz or Edge and Christian as a tag team if there is one member that screws up it’s going to effect the whole tag team. That’s why it was on one day and off a couple of days later. It was given because it was deserved but it was taken away at the same time because there was an issue that needed to be resolved. But by the time the issue got resolved all this other stuff had happened with Shawn Michaels. In 94 is when we got the tag belts. It was another tour overseas in 94 when the issue with Shawn Michaels happened and so I’m out for nine months.\n\nWhat kept M.O.M from leaving to go to WCW:\n\nWhen those nine months are up in 1995 we are at the Royal Rumble and Nelson and I had decided because it was driving me crazy we decide we’re going to leave in January of 95. I had been on the shelf for nine months and it wasn’t going the way we wanted. The deal to keep us there and not leave was The King of The Ring.\n\nIn quite possibly the most controversial episode of The Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling Podcast to date, John and Chad welcome former WWE Tag Team Champion and La Resistance member Rene Dupree. Dupree is not one to cut corners as he gives his honest and candid take on WWE Developmental, NXT, his issues with his former tag team partner Sylvan, disdain for Bubba Ray Dudley, Hardcore Holly and also JBL. Dupree’s pull no punches style makes this a can’t miss episode and if you are a fan of the mid 2000s WWE you will recall the missed opportunity by WWE not getting behind what was the youngest wrestler ever signed by the organization.\n\nFull Episode Download Link:\n\nhttp://tmptow.podoma…T21_00_00-07_00\n\nRene Dupree Shoots On Bubba Ray Dudley Purposely Giving Him Concussions:\n\nDid he get along with former tag team partners (Sylvan Grenier and Kenzo Suzuki):\n\nAs far as Sly, no I didn’t like the guy. Does that answer your question? We don’t like each other, we haven’t talked to each other and probably never will. He (Kenzo Suzuki) was great. That’s when I got into Japanese culture was traveling with him and his wife. I spent more time in Japan than I did with the WWE or the United States. I had a seven or eight year career there but now I am winding down, I’m only 31 going to be 32 in December but I’ve had my fill with wrestling. I say that now but a wrestler never retires.\n\nWorking in Japan over The United States and WWEs current product:\n\nIf you are good, you can get anybody off their ass. It took time but I learned how to get them off their ass and that’s why I stayed there so long. I learned how to get over with that crowd. There it’s different, for example if it’s an opening match they are going to treat it as an opening match but if it’s a match with significance, like a title match that has importance and has been built up right they will get more involved and into it and more into the false finishes and be just as loud as an American crowd. Now with WWE, they do everything on TV. Nobody gives a sh*t if it’s a title match or not. You don’t even know the rules or know what the hell is going on. Who gives a sh*t if it’s a title match, they switch the belt every other week, as far as tag titles or Intercontinental. I couldn’t tell you who the tag champs are or who the Intercontinental Champion is now, I don’t know.\n\nHow have injuries played a part in his wrestling career coming to an end:\n\nI’m pretty much done with the whole wrestling game. I’d like to do the convention circuit so I don’t have to take any bumps because my brains are so scrambled from throughout the years that it’s starting to affect me and starting to affect my daily life. Now that I am getting older, it started when I was around 27, I started forgetting stuff, I had twenty-five concussions just within WWE. You think about well I have so many, not really when you work a full time schedule and I was there for 5 1/2 years and when you wrestle what 150- 250 matches a year to have four or five concussions a year do you think that’s highly unlikely? No, that’s normal.\n\nDid The Dudley Boyz take liberties with him in the ring:\n\nDoes a bear sh*t in the woods? Oh my God. I’ve had so many concussions from Bubba Ray Dudley it’s not even funny. You know Chris Nowinski had to retire because of Bubba Ray giving him concussions right? Devon, it’s universal everyone likes Devon because he’s a pro, but Bubba can be difficult to work with.\n\nWhat he thinks led to The Dudleyz leaving WWE in 2005:\n\nOne time in the ring, Sly screwed up a spot and then Bubba punched him in the face and bloodied his nose and Sly asked him why backstage and Bubba went off and punched him in the face again. Sylvan was very good friends with Pat Patterson and they weren’t around shortly thereafter.\n\nThe WWE Developmental process and the Performance Center:\n\nWho have they developed since they’ve had that Performance Center? The ones that will become stars are the ones that will prove themselves elsewhere. Quite frankly there is not too many place to go and learn but the ones that show the heart and determination and the love for it, not some f*cking ex-football player that twisted his ankle in camp and can’t play in the NFL anymore, not some underwear model or some bodybuilder. The ones that will make it and will get over and will put up with their bullsh*t quite frankly are the guys that love it.\n\nHis take on former WWE Superstars suing WWE for negligence in relation to injuries:\n\nI don’t know anything of it but I can tell you from experience that, yeah there is definitely or at least there was. I don’t know about now, I think they are trying to cover their tracks. I have no opinion of it. What happens, happens and I just want to stay clear from that place.\n\nWere there ever motions to push medical treatment:\n\nThey definitely didn’t. I personally got knocked out one night. I was wrestling Rob Van Dam and he hit me with a spin kick and I was out for five hours. I was out on my feet for five and half hour! I didn’t get no concussions tests. I didnt even go to a doctor. After a concussion you are not supposed to go to sleep, well I woke up in my bed and Sylvan called me up and said you got kicked in the head and don’t worry about it. You know how long I waited until I got back in the ring? I was back in the next night. Remember the Bob Holly Incident? I got kicked about fifth-teen or twenty times in the f*cking head with a wrestling boot. You know how hard the sole of a wrestling boot is? It’s like a steel-toed boot. Did I go get a concussion test. No. Did I go to a doctor? Yes, but just to see if anything was broken around my eye.\n\nWhat led to the infamous Bob Holly incident and did anyone encourage his attack:\n\nI was a kid and I made a mistake not paying a parking ticket and I offered to pay him double for whatever it is that I owed him and that wasn’t good enough. So, he threatened to kill me on a plane and threatened to run me over. The guy is a psychopath. I am a firm believer because I was about twenty and he was forty-one and I believe he was suffering from dementia to be honest with you. John Laurenitis is behind it all too because he is the one who booked me in a f*cking match with him and they knew exactly what they were doing. They knew exactly what was going to happen and they were laughing at it, the whole place is f*cking corrupt.\n\nSimilar heat with JBL:\n\nJBL is a piece of sh*t.\n\nRene Duprees added thoughts on JBL had to be wiped from the record. Rene also discusses being signed at 18, restarting Grand Prix Wrestling, his fathers influences, having wrestling in the blood, working for Vince McMahon, The Great Muta, Heat with The Dudley Boyz, thoughts on WWE Developmental and his run as part of La Resistance.\n\nToday John and Chad welcome one-half of the tag team PG-13 and the writer of the legendary “Nation of Domination Rap” the innovative and artistically inclined, Wolfie D to the Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling. Wolfie’s stories of the Memphis territory and teaming with longtime partner Jamie Dundee make for an entertaining ride through a career that saw PG-13 dominate the Memphis tag team scene and what helped them catapult to the WWF in 1996 to join the Nation of Domination. Wolfie also gives his rather amusing take on the imposter teams that grabbed the PG-13 look and attempted their own spin on what was at the time an original act. Additionally, Wolfie’s artistic abilities are discussed as Wolfie explains what Jerry Lynn means to the wrestling business and why he designed a t-shirt that pays homage to one of the best workers in the history of pro wrestling.\n\nFull Episode Download:\n\nhttp://tmptow.podoma…T21_00_00-07_00\n\nWolfie D Talks Writing The Nation of Domination Rap:\n\nPG-13s initial tryout with WWE in 1995 and why they did not last:\n\nThe wrestling business is all about timing and we were just a little bit early on our timing going up there because that was a time when everybody was huge giant monsters and we were not that big. We went up there and they loved our work, they loved our gimmick, they loved our interviews but “oh they are too small” is what they said. A couple of years later all of a sudden the Mexican invasion happens with the cruiser-weights and everybody starts shrinking and there was room for guys our size. So it’s like we were a little bit too early. Had we come along maybe a year or so later it could have been a different story and we might have stuck around the whole time and we didn’t because they said we were too small. So we went back to Memphis and then in 96 we get called up to do the rapping for The Nation of Domination.\n\nRejoining the WWE and being an essential part of The Nation of Domination:\n\nThat was cool and of course we were always trying to find ways to get involved in the match instead of just standing there, which was kind of the original thing of maybe just to take something here or there. Believe me we were going to Ron (Simmons) and we were creating sh*t for ourselves and probably more than they really wanted us to do but that is how we knew how to get over, so we had a one-up on people because we were from Memphis and we worked all the time and had a little bit of experience. We would always find the camera and if you ever watch it and especially Jamie we knew where that camera was at all times and we would be sure to put our faces in it as well as when I wrote the rap, I put our names in it. Little things like that to help us stand out more than the original Nation crew that were just basically bodies to be around Farooq.\n\nVince McMahon’s response to the Nation of Domination rap:\n\nIt kind of sucked the way it happened. We flew up to the office and I had written it all out and we met with Jim Johnston the guy who does the music and he laid down a track for it and we knew we were going to have to rap this thing live every night. They gave us a copy on a cassette tape and gave us a copy of the music. It didn’t have all the “We are the Nation” in it, it only had it like one time and we were driving up and down the road every night putting that instrumental in and me and him (Jamie Dundee) rapping back and forth. We got the timing down. So we get to Survivor Series and that was the debut of it and us and before the show here comes Vince and we are supposed to walk out and do this thing for Vince right there. We get live mic’s, we get ready to start rapping and they f*cking changed the beat. It was kind of a scramble for us to figure it out but we did it. I’m not going to lie, there was a lot of times and Jamie wouldn’t either, that he has no rhythm and he was playing off of me and there was times when he would get off rhythm and I would have to jump in and try my best to get us back on.\n\nWWE releasing the PG-13 version of the Nation theme:\n\nSo I wrote that and they laid the track down and it’s on tape. When they came out with the CD of the WWE Music Volume whatever in the Nation song they took our vocals out of it. Years later and the internet wasn’t what it is now I find out that the overseas version does have our vocals in it and I’ve never received a nickel for that and that kind of gets me hot.\n\nDid he feel Vince McMahons take on The Nation was fueled by racism:\n\nHonestly, no. I didn’t have many dealing with Vince. I was low low low on the totem pole so I didn’t have to deal with him that much. The wrestling business is a jacked up place, especially the “older wrestling business”. I know it’s changed a lot where if I were in WWE at the moment, I might not recognize the dressing room the way things are now and the way things changed with cameras everywhere, I’m just glad there wasn’t camera phones back in the 90s I can tell you that much. The wrestling business has always been a bit corrupt, it came from carnies. It was a secret society. If you think about the fact that his father was a promoter, he learned from him and I’m not saying Vince McMahon is a racist by any stretch but I’m just saying the business is different. I’ve seen things that would make “normal” people that haven’t been in the wresting business eyes pop out of their head or their ears bleed.\n\nThe Nations feud with Ahmed Johnson and his supposed reputation of being reckless:\n\nThis is going to sound bad but me and Jamie both knew we were better workers then he was so like I said we were always trying to find spots for ourselves. Ahmed was cool and if you ever watch Royal Rumble (97) at the end I think I feed into him and he press slams me but he’s so blown up he can’t even pick me up all the way. So when he goes to toss me over the top, I’m at an angle and my leg catches the top ropes and thank GOD there was people there to catch me because I tumbled out on my head. I don’t ever recall him doing anything that made me go Jesus Christ or anything, he was just one of those big guys that we were used to having to protect ourselves and to position ourselves for people that were “less than” when it came to timing and working. In Memphis, as a collective group some of the worst freaking wrestlers I’ve ever been in the ring with were the Memphis job guys, they were terrible. You literally had to really arm-drag them or really do sh*t to them so we were used to putting people in positions to make ourselves look good.\n\nImposters to the original PG-13 gimmick including John Cena:\n\nAbsolutely, I can take it back to 1993 when Jerry Jarrett gave us a break with a months worth of rap videos before we ever came on the air and actually wrestled, they just showed videos of us rapping. If you notice, there was a team called Men on a Mission that came out not too soon after and that’s when Jerry Jarrett went to New York, now you tell me? Guys that were in his company, that everyone thought were too small for WWE, so the guy from Memphis goes to WWE for a little bit and the first thing you see that comes out is a rap gimmick. But instead they hired two giant black dudes to do it. If you look at the original music Jamie and I came out to it was “Hip Hop Hooray”, we were waving the hands back and forth, Men on a Mission waved their hands back and forth, to me that was the first one. Then you have Too Cool, which I love Brian (Christopher) to death but I’ve joked with him before that Too Cool is absolutely PG-13, I don’t care what anybody says. John Cena, same thing. I am not bitter because of it but I do think there was heavy PG-13 influence because PG-13 came before. Our gimmick was original. It kind of sucks when you are the original but your gimmick didnt get the national exposure that the imposters did so then people are looking at you like youre f*cking imitator, that sucks. When you know, hold-up little kid, Im not copying John Cena you little bastard.\n\nWolfie D also discusses the entire Memphis run for PG-13, the Memphis wrestling scene, winning the USWA tag titles 16 times, working with Ron Simmons, Loving The Road Warriors, his breakup with JC Ice, wrestling in TNA as Slash, signing with WWE again and heading to OVW\n\nToday The Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling welcomes ring veteran and the focus of the MTV True Life: I’m a Pro Wrestler documentary, Rory Fox. Fresh off our episode with Les Thatcher where Rory Fox is highly praised by his original trainer and nearly seventeen years after the original airing we get Rory’s take on the highlights of his career as well as some very candid and remarkable comments regarding an in-ring incident with a former TNA/Lucha Underground wrestler who carelessly took liberties with him multiple times. John and Chad advise that you strap in because the final moments of this podcast are out of this world.\n\nFull Episode Download Link:\n\nhttp://tmptow.podoma…T21_00_00-07_00\n\nRory Fox Destroys Hernandez Over Recklessly Giving Him The Border Toss:\n\nRory Fox On How He Was Selected For MTV True Life: I’m A Pro Wrestler :\n\nBeing able to step-in and become the focus of the MTV True Life documentary:\n\nIf we are not going mention his name I just want to say thank-you wherever you are for being such a screw-up crack-head and a thief, I would not have had the opportunity to take part in the MTV Special. I was just another guy at the wrestling school, six months in and doing all right with Les at wrestling training and when they went around and interviewed everybody I was a guy from small-town Iowa that had 100 people in it and never left the state of Iowa and I’m telling my whole story about how I saved all my money to come out to Cincinnati and how I worked in factories and had this dream to wrestle since I was 5 years old.\n\nWhat led to him being selected:\n\nThis kid just stopped showing up. He stopped coming to practice, he would just go out all night and tell all the chicks at the club that he was a wrestler. He was already worried about being a TV star so they kind of gave up on him and had to salvage this (documentary). So then they thought the kid from Watkins, Iowa has a story and low and behold they go with me and I’ve got this opportunity for National TV.\n\nHow MTV True Life opened the door to being booked by WWE:\n\nI got the opportunity and it helped me in so many ways. I had my first match in 1999 and I had to go home in 2001 for financial reasons and I sent in a demo tape and resume to WWF and Kevin Kelly was in Talent Relations at that time so two years in the business I got booked for the TV’s (Monday/Tuesday). I wrestled Haku on the Jacked/Metal syndicated tapings and they actually did commentary for the match and Michael Hayes referred to the MTV special and said because the first Tough Enough was coming around “who could be the next Rory Fox in the making on Tough Enough”. It’s so crazy now because they won’t even acknowledge enhancement guys let alone mention them with such regard.\n\nLearning to properly bump from Les Thatcher and staying mostly injury free:\n\nThe great thing about Les’s school and all that bumping and learning how to safely bump will definitely help you in the long run. I was pretty injury free for most of my career, the only one time I really felt any kind of real neck pain was with BJ Whitmer. He did a dive over the top rope and I was standing too far and all his weight came at the top of my head, it felt like it made me an inch shorter that night.\n\nTimes where you cannot control how you take a bump:\n\nIt was Shawn Hernandez, I knew him from Texas Wrestling and you are without a doubt the biggest piece of scum-bag trash in wrestling, you gave me that “border-toss” three different times and three different times you dropped me on my head. What happened to Doug Williams in TNA Wrestling, I suffered that three different times and never once did he ever apologize for it. Even after I was icing my neck in the back he didn’t say a word to me about it.\n\nHis relationship with Hernandez while wrestling in Texas:\n\nWhen I first got down to Texas I was his friend, I was putting him over we were riding together to some shows and I was working shows that he was promoting and I was like his best friend. All of a sudden another promotion starts up with a combination of different talent and he says can I no-show the other promotion and I said I can’t do it and I’ll do his next show. After that we were no longer friends again and I never worked a show again for him. One night at River City Wrestling, the locker room was outside the building and he’s watching the monitor so I went and was with the boys and he looks at me and says what the f*ck are you doing here? Shoves me down infront of the whole locker room, Lance Hoyt was there that night and got a good laugh out of it so f*ck him too and this was when he (Hernandez) was a big scary guy and all juiced up and he never apologized. I think karma has a way coming around, he had a chance to be TNA World Champion, he got to wrestle Sting and Kurt Angle and he put on sh*tty matches with Sting and Kurt Angle and I don’t know how you do that.\n\nHe would always say well at least I got a contract Rory. Well congrats because you are a big jacked up hispanic wrestler and I’m just an under-sized white guy from the Mid West. I laughed my ass off when they couldn’t use his footage at TNA because he was still under contract to Lucha Underground, he lied to TNA and said he had a release but they had to throw away the footage. He doesn’t have a job now and he will never be that singles star that they thought he could be, because he sucks.\n\nRory Fox also talks about the infamous tights incident on ECW TV against Zack Ryder, other WWE Dark Matches and TV appearances, veterans in the WWE locker room, more on MTV and Les Thatcher, BJ Whiter, Shark Boy and HWA\n\nTV 1994-09-20 (Matches taped 1994-08-28 at ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pa)\n\nChampions\n\nWorld: “The Franchise” Shane Douglas\n\nTV: Jason\n\nTag: Cactus Jack & Mikey Whipwreck\n\nBack to the Tournament and we get the post match interview from “The Franchise” Shane Douglas.

Loved the angle for the main event that few minutes right there made this whole episode worth it. The Taz Malenko stuff was also lots of fun with them countering back and forth.

We go to Tommy Dreamer and he is watching what he did to Sandman in slow motion in his living room. Dreamer is very upset and looks like he is going to cry. He says he sees what happened every time he closes his eyes. Dreamer is an emotional wreck and tells Sandman that he didn’t mean to blind him. Dreamer says he wanted to give the fans a hardcore match and if him not wanting to take out someones eye makes him not hardcore well then he’s not hardcore. Dreamer tells Sandman he is trying to get a benefit show going and that from now on every time he wrestles he does it for the Sandman. Dreamer then cries like a pussy.\n\nMy thoughts on the show…\n\nI liked the Borne Again / Scorpio match. Borne was a great talent that played crazy awesomely. The Dreamer crying stuff was decent but over the top."
