        "text": "WWE Hall of Famer Eric Bischoff isn’t entirely convinced that Impact Wrestling’s rebranding back to TNA Wrestling will be a game-changer for the promotion.\n\nDuring the Bound for Glory 2023 event, it was officially announced that Impact Wrestling would be returning to its TNA branding in the coming year, starting with TNA Hard to Kill on January 13.\n\nHowever, Bischoff shared his doubts about the impact of this name change on his “Strictly Business” podcast. He voiced his skepticism, saying:\n\n“I just don’t think that TNA brand had enough value ever, so that bringing it back is going to have any kind of — no pun intended — impact. Unless the product changes and there’s significant change in the presentation, it’s just changing the name of the show and I don’t think that’s gonna matter one bit.”\n\nBischoff went further to suggest that not only might reverting to the TNA name fail to provide a boost, but it could even deter potential viewers due to its suggestive implications. He added:\n\n“You can [say] ‘it means Total Nonstop Action.’ It means ‘t*ts and ass,’ it was a Vince Russo idea.”\n\nThe decision to return to the TNA brand has sparked discussions and debates in the wrestling world, and it remains to be seen whether this change will truly impact the promotion’s future or if it’s just a name game.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Eric Bischoff’s skepticism regarding Impact Wrestling’s rebranding back to TNA? Do you agree that the TNA brand may not have enough value to make a significant difference, or do you think it could potentially rejuvenate the promotion? Leave us a comment below."
