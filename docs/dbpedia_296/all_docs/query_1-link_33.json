        "text": "Nashville, TN (May 10, 2002) – Jerry Jarrett, CEO of J Sports & Entertainment, commenting today on the announcement of the launch of the new weekly NWA: Total Nonstop Action wrestling series, talked about the importance of the NWA name being attached to the show.\n\n“We’re thrilled to be using the NWA name for our program,” said Jarrett. “The National Wrestling Alliance has a long and prestigious history and was at one time the dominant name in the professional wrestling industry. We believe it’s important for our company to be affiliated with a name that fans will recognize and we believe the NWA name is a familiar one to most fans of professional wrestling.”\n\nNWA President Jim Miller was equally excited, saying, “This is a win-win for everybody involved. I’m very excited about the prospects of working with J Sports & Entertainment to make NWA: Total Nonstop Action a tremendous success. The pay-per-view broadcasts will expose the NWA to fans in a way that hasn’t been possible before and the opportunities for our member organizations will be better than ever.”\n\nJ Sports President Jeff Jarrett added, “The NWA name is the foundation that sports entertainment was built on. We plan to build on that foundation with the cutting edge characters and revolutionary concepts expected by today’s wrestling audience. Total Nonstop Action will be more than the name of the show, it’s what we want our fans to think of every time they watch our program.”\n\nNWA: Total Nonstop Action will broadcast every Wednesday night at 8pm Eastern and will be available on cable and satellite at a suggested retail price of $9.95."
