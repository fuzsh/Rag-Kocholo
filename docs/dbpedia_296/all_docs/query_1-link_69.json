        "text": "The return of Total Nonstop Action looks to breathe new life into IMPACT Wrestling, with a rebranding back to their old name being announced at the Bound For Glory PPV event last night.\n\nThis change in presentation has apparently been a long time coming, but plans for it were completely locked in place within the last month. A report on PWInsider has provided the reasons as to why this change is taking place, with it citing quite a few different factors.\n\nFirst and foremost, they are looking to “unite the fragmented history of the promotion” given that over the years they have had several different names and banners. It is also a decision done based on the popularity and nostalgia of the TNA brand and name. Fans were polled earlier this year and voted that they preferred “TNA”, with chants of these three letters being heard in the crowd too. International partners are also apparently a fan of the old name, with some even still using it.\n\nThe success of IMPACT 1000 and the nostalgia rub that it got was also a factor in bringing about the final decision on making this switch."
