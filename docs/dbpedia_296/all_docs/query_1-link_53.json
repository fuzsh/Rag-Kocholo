        "text": "Impact Wrestling is crossing the line back to TNA.\n\nAt the conclusion of Bound for Glory on Saturday night, Impact Wrestling aired a video revealing that the promotion is changing its name back to TNA Wrestling. It will be the first time since 2017 that the promotion has been known as TNA.\n\nThe rebrand goes into effect starting with Hard to Kill 2024, which is taking place from the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas on Saturday, January 13.\n\n“I can still hear it. People want to pretend that it went away, but we’re reminded of it every [expletive] day,” Frankie Kazarian said in Saturday’s video. “All of you, you’re my brothers and my sisters. And I feel it in my core. Professional wrestling is bleeding. There needs to be a change. This is that change.”\n\n“And to get there, we have to go back to where it all started,” Jordynne Grace added.\n\nEric Young, Alisha Edwards, Eddie Edwards, Alex Shelley, Josh Alexander, and Chris Sabin also spoke in the video. It ended with a box being opened that revealed the return of TNA.\n\n“We still hear the ‘TNA’ chants wherever we go,” Impact Wrestling president Scott D’Amore said in a press release. “Fans have longed for TNA Wrestling, so that’s what we’re bringing back in 2024: TNA Wrestling, we’re back!”\n\nThe press release stated that the rebrand will include TNA running “larger, more prestigious venues.”\n\n“Company officials confirmed that the new year will launch a new-look TNA Wrestling that runs from the entrance ramp to turnbuckles in the ring to larger, more prestigious venues and much, much more,” Impact wrote.\n\nD’Amore will provide further details in an interview with Tom Hannifan on Impact’s Facebook page this Tuesday (October 24).\n\nTNA launched as NWA: Total Nonstop Action in 2002. The company celebrated its 20th anniversary last year.\n\nThe first match for Hard to Kill 2024 already looks to be set. After winning the Call Your Shot gauntlet match at Bound for Glory, Grace declared that she’s going to challenge for the Knockouts Championship at Hard to Kill. Trinity currently holds the Knockouts title.\n\nAfter Hard to Kill, TNA is holding television tapings at The Palms on Sunday, January 14. Those matches will air on future episodes of Impact."
