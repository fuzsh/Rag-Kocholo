        "text": "TNA have gone all out in pushing and promoting this event. It's the strongest marketing they've done in recent memory, have sold 4000 tickets and that is all without factoring in the partnership with NXT/WWE.\n\nAnthem have given every indication they are all in on TNA, and this PPV in many ways represents their investment. A success in terms of the in-ring & PPV buys could very be what gets them the distribution deal they are chasing. If things go astray (production issues, lackluster buys, poor in ring), the momentum could very quickly be lost and a professional outfit like the WWE might think twice about their working relationship."
