        "text": "WWE Hall of Famer Eric Bischoff isn’t sure whether Impact Wrestling’s impending change to TNA Wrestling will have much of an effect on the promotion.\n\nDuring the Bound for Glory 2023 pay-per-view event, it was announced that Impact will go back to its TNA branding next year, starting with TNA Hard to Kill on January 13.\n\nOn a recent edition of his “Strictly Business” podcast, Bischoff cast doubt on the idea that the rebranding will have a massive change to the promotion. He said,\n\n“I just don’t think that TNA brand had enough value ever, so that bringing it back is going to have any kind of — no pun intended — impact. Unless the product changes and there’s significant change in the presentation, it’s just changing the name of the show and I don’t think that’s gonna matter one bit.”\n\nBischoff later stated that not only will using the TNA name not help the company but could in fact deter potential viewers due to its suggestive meaning. He said,"
