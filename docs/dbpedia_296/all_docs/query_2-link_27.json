        "text": "Instead, I suggest that the Old Testament text is a literary and theological unit in its final post-exilic shape (Law, Prophets, and Writings). As a textual unit the Old Testament has an introduction which sets the stage for the rest of the text and serves as the hermeneutical lens through which to read the Old Testament. I propose that Genesis 1-4 serves as this theological introduction to the Scripture. These chapters create the theological prototypes for the Old Testament, which are repeated and elaborated upon through the Law, Prophets, and Writings. The repetition of these theological prototypes provides more detail and clarification of OT instruction. As a Christian, whose Scripture includes the New Testament, the trajectory of theological concepts must be followed into the New Testament to complete the scriptural perspective.\n\nFew passages in the Hebrew Bible have been subject to more scrutiny than Genesis 1 and 2. In this volume, a diverse international team of experts guides readers through interpretations of the Genesis creation stories throughout history, inviting readers to consider perspectives from the earliest times to the present. Written with the capabilities and needs of students in mind, this book offers an accurate description of how Genesis 1 and 2 have been read through the centuries and explains each interpretive approach in its own terms. Each chapter includes sidebars and suggestions for further reading. Since the Beginning is well suited for courses on the Old Testament, Genesis and creation, the history of interpretation, and science and religion. It will also appeal to teachers, pastors, and others following the creation debates and discussions. http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/since-the-beginning/376810\n\nThis commentary is the result of my first ‘Discipleship Training Through Genesis’ taught by Pastor Don Kim of Berendo Street Baptist Church in 1987. Since then using this material I taught my first Discipleship training in 1988 with College department members and then several times at Oikos Community Church."
