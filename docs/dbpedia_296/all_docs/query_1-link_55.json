        "text": "Creation\n\nFollowing the collapse of World Championship Wrestling in 2001, the WWE was left completely unopposed in their monopoly of the wrestling business. Bob Ryder, Jerry Jarrett and Jeff Jarrett sought to provide fans and workers alike with an alternative.\n\nIn 2002, Vince Russo joined the team and coined the name of their new promotion: Total Nonstop Action, or TNA for short. They began airing weekly pay-per-view shows, filmed mostly at the Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena. In 2004, TNA debuted a second weekly television show, Impact!. This would coincide with a surge in popularity for the young promotion.\n\nRise In Popularity\n\nWhile WWE showcased its “sports entertainment” style of television, TNA presented fans with a more grounded, sports-like style of professional wrestling. It proved to be immensely successful and attracted a devoted following.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, TNA had gathered a star-studded cast of ultra-athletic competitors, including Christopher Daniels, Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, and AJ Styles. Their six-sided ring added to the promotion’s unique feel and helped it feel more innovative and cutting-edge than its competition.\n\nThe Hogan and Bischoff Era\n\nIn 2009, TNA President Dixie Carter made an incredibly controversial decision by hiring Hulk Hogan and former WCW President, Eric Bischoff. Both worked backstage on the company’s creative and as onscreen personalities.\n\nHogan and Bischoff drove TNA in a very different direction. Firstly, they did away with the six-sided ring. They also deterred from the sports-style, athletic presentation that made the promotion so successful in favor of a soap opera-style program. TNA was no longer the cutting-edge alternative, but a smaller, sloppier WWE.\n\nFinancial Hardships\n\nStarting in 2013, several of TNA’s biggest stars parted ways with the company, including AJ Styles, Sting, Christopher Daniels, and Kazarian. These departures came after TNA resorted to pay cuts for top talent in order to try and escape their looming financial trouble. The company required financial assistance and loans from its broadcasters in order to avoid filing for bankruptcy.\n\nMiraculously, TNA made it through these difficulties. Anthem Sports & Entertainment purchased a majority stake of the promotion, and President Dixie Carter stepped down after a fourteen-year tenure.\n\nRebrandings\n\nIn 2017, TNA rebranded as Impact Wrestling. Scott D’Amore was promoted to Executive Vice President and began overseeing daily operations. The promotion kept the traditional four-sided ring, but returned to its sports-style roots. New names and faces began to emerge within the company, including Brian Cage, Pentagon Jr and Fenix, and Eli Drake (now known as LA Knight).\n\nToday, Impact boasts one of the greatest women’s divisions in wrestling history, referred to as the Knockouts. Stars like Jordynne Grace, Killer Kelly, Rosemary, Deonna Purrazzo, and Trinity (FKA Naomi) have helped rebuild and elevate Impact’s reputation among wrestling fans.\n\nOn October 21, 2023, Impact announced that it would be reviving its former title, Total Nonstop Action, on January 12, 2024, at their annual Hard To Kill PPV."
