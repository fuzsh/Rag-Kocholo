Giovanna of Italy (13 November 1907 â€“ 26 February 2000) was Tsaritsa of Bulgaria. She was born in Rome, the third daughter and fourth child of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Queen Elena, former Princess of Montenegro. She married Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria in Assisi in October 1930, in a Roman Catholic ceremony. At a second ceremony in Sofia, Bulgaria, Giovanna was married in an Eastern Orthodox Church ceremony. Giovanna adopted the Bulgarian version of her name, Ioanna. She and Boris had two children: Marie Louise of Bulgaria, born in January 1933, and then the future Simeon II of Bulgaria in 1937. In August 1943, the Tsar became seriously ill and died, aged 49. Ioanna's son, Simeon, became the new Tsar and a regency was established led by his uncle Prince Kyril. In the dying days of World War II, Bulgaria was invaded by the Soviet Union. Prince Kyril was tried by a People's Court and subsequently executed. Ioanna and Simeon remained under home arrest at Vrana Palace, near Sofia until 1946, when the new Communist government gave them 48 hours to leave the country. Tsaritsa Ioanna and the children initially fled to Alexandria, Egypt, to be with her father, Victor Emmanuel III, and then they moved to Madrid. In 1962, Tsaritsa Ioanna moved to Estoril, Portugal, where she lived for the rest of her life.
