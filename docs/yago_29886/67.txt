Queen Giovanna of Bulgaria was born on this day in 1907, exactly 110 years ago! The third daughter and forth child of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Princess Elena of Montenegro. In 1930, she married Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria at the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi. The couple had two children, Tsar Simeon and Princess Marie Louise, and were happily married until his death in 1943, under dubious circumstances in the second world war.
