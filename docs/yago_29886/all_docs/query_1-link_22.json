        "text": "Crown Prince Boris is the oldest son of Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria and the current heir-presumptive to the Bulgarian throne. Due to his father's high age, he often represents the Tsar on public occasions and is beloved by his people.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nPrince Boris was raised by his parents at Vrana Palace in the outskirts of Sofia. He was christened Christian Orthodox to appease Russia & the Bulgarian people, a move that earned Prince Ferdinand the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives (particularly his uncle Franz Joseph I of Austria) and excommunication from the Catholic Church. In order to remedy this difficult situation, Ferdinand christened all his remaining children as Catholics. Nicholas II of Russia stood as godfather to Boris and met the young boy during Ferdinand's official visit to Saint Petersburg in July 1898. Boris received his initial education in the so-called Palace Secondary School in Sofia, which Ferdinand had created in 1908 solely for his sons.\n\nLater, Boris graduated from the Bulgarian Military School and took part in the Balkan Wars (1912-1913). During the Weltkrieg, he served as liaison officer of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army on the Macedonian front. In 1916, he was promoted to colonel and attached again as liaison officer to Army Group Mackensen and the Bulgarian Third Army for the operations against Romania. Boris worked hard to smooth the sometimes difficult relations between Field Marshal August von Mackensen and Lieutenant General Stefan Toshev, the commander of the Third Army. Through his courage and personal example, he earned the respect of the troops and the senior Bulgarian and German commanders, even that of the Generalquartiermeister of the German Army, Erich Ludendorff, who preferred dealing personally with Boris and described him as excellently trained, a thoroughly soldierly person and mature beyond his years. In 1918, Boris was made a major general.\n\nAfter the Great War[]\n\nAfter the war, Boris decided to study in Germany. He married Giovanna of Italy (b. 1907) who is the third daughter and fourth child of the now deposed King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy his wife Queen Elena, former Princess of Montenegro. They have one daughter Marie Louise, Princess of Koháry (b. 1933)\n\nWIP\n\nMarriages[]\n\nHe had married Giovanna of Italy (b. 1907), the third daughter and fourth child of Victor Emmanuel III, the ex-King of Italy and ex-Queen Elena, former Princess of Montenegro. They have one daughter named Marie Louise, Princess of Koháry (b. 1933) who is currently 3 years old."
