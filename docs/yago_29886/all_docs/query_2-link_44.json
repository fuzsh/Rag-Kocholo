The crowd in the town was estimated at 100,000. To-night the Royal couple will leave by train for Brindisi, where they will embark for Bulgaria. There will be a torchlight procession through the streets.\n\nThe Royal trains arrived at Assisi in the morning from Pisa, bringing King Boris, of Bulgaria. Princess Giovanna, of Italy, and the members of their families for the wedding in the historic Basilica, St. Francis. A large number of guests had already arrived —many motor car—including many representatives of the couple's families and foreign Royalty. Station and trains were gaily decorated, and the Royal parties were greeted on their arrival by civic dignitaries, and a delegation of the Franciscan Order.

About 300 guests were accommodated in the church.\n\nSix thousand troops were brought into Assisi to line the streets, and there was a similar number of Fascist legionaries on duty. The Royal escort consisted of 40 Cuirassiers.\n\nPrincess Giovanna expressed the hope that wedding presents for her might take the form of gifts to the poor. Nevertheless, many handsome presents arrived at San Rossore.\n\nAmong the notable gifts were a diadem set with diamonds and pearls, from ex-tsar Ferdinand, a silver samovar of old workmanship, made in London, from the Fascist Party, a collection of old embroidery work from the ladies of the Court, and very handsome piano from the ladies of Turin.\n\nThe Italian Government gave her a bronze statue by Vincenzo Gerrmto, entitled \"The Fireman.\"\n\nAll over Italy, the towers are hung with Italian and Bulgarian flags, in celebration of the wedding.
