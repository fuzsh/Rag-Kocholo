The third daughter and forth child of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Princess Elena of Montenegro. In 1930, she married Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria at the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi. The couple had two children, Tsar Simeon and Princess Marie Louise, and were happily married until his death in 1943, under dubious circumstances in the second world war. After remaining in house arrest by the Communist government until 1946, Queen Giovanna and her children were forced to flee into exile, joining her father, also in exile, in Egypt, then Madrid, and then to Portugal, where she spent the rest of her life, apart brief return to Bulgaria in 1993, and died in 2000.\n\nThe Bulgarian Royal Tiaras"
