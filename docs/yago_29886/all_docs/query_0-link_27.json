        "text": "Ioanna, the Bulgarian queen whose marriage was blessed by Mussolini and whose husband, King Boris III, may have been poisoned by Hitler, died Saturday in her home in Estoril, Portugal. She was 92.\n\nThough her husband made a reluctant alliance with Hitler, she is remembered for efforts to save Bulgarian Jews from the Nazis. She and her two children, including Simeon, who became king at 6 when his father died in 1943, were kept under house arrest by the Gestapo.\n\nWhen the Communists came to power they held a mock referendum calling for an end to the monarchy, and Ioanna fled into exile with her children.\n\nThe slender, cheerful woman, often called the ''country's memory,'' represented an elegant thread between the days the world watched the meaningful glances, dalliances and marriages of European royalty like a sport, and the 20th-century specters of war and revolution. Her roots reflected a breathtakingly exclusive royal society, in which kings as often as not were cousins and romance might serve political purposes, or vice versa.\n\nThe queen was born Giovanna Elisabetta Antonio Romana Maria, princess of Italy. Ioanna is the Bulgarian translation of her name.\n\nShe was the third of four daughters of King Victor Emmanuel III, who reigned from 1900 to 1946, and Queen Elena, one of the daughters of King Nicholas of Montenegro. King Nicholas was known for planting his daughters in the courts of Europe for use as ambassadors and spies.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
