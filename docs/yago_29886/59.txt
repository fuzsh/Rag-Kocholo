Boris III, Tsar of Bulgaria (30 January 1894 â€“ 28 August 1943), son of Ferdinand I, came to the throne in 1918 upon the abdication of his father, following the defeat of the Kingdom of Bulgaria during World War I. Boris married Giovanna of Italy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, first in a Catholic ceremony in Assisi, Italy in October 1930 and then at an Orthodox ceremony in Sofia. The marriage produced a daughter, Maria Louisa, in January 1933, and a son and heir to the throne, Simeon, in 1937. In the early days of World War II, Bulgaria was neutral, but powerful groups in the country swayed its politics towards Germany. In March 1941, Boris allied himself with the Axis powers, thus recovering most of Macedonia and Aegean Thrace back to his kingdom, as well as protecting his country from being crushed by the German Wehrmacht like neighboring Yugoslavia and Greece. For recovering these territories Tsar Boris was called the Unifier. However, in spite of this strong alliance, Boris was not willing to render full and unconditional cooperation with Germany, despite the German presence in Sofia. He died of apparent heart failure on 28 August 1943, shortly after returning to Sofia from a meeting with Hitler.
