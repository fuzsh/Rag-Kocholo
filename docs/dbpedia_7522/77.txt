I'm going to be placing an order with Jeff Rapps from TUIC. I am thinking about adding one of his 4-4.5'' male salvini cichlids to the order. Do salvini males get any red coloration to them? I love the look of females but never kept a male only females. If you could post pictures of your salvini males that would be great.

This pic is of the best pair of Salvinis I've kept. The male displayed a lot of color.

Depends on the fish. I have seen a lot of salvinis with a red coloration.

I believe that there are two location pints where males show a lot of red. Off the top of my head I canâ€™t think of them, however

Rio chacamax males display almost an equal amount of red as the females. I've also read rio candelaria males display a lot of red as well, but so far my grow out males are displaying more of the blue spangling and less red.
