The Salvini Cichlid, also known as the Tricolor Cichlid and the Yellow Belly Cichlid, is a brightly coloured cichlid from the lakes and rivers of southern Mexico and northern Central America.

They have a bright yellow body with two blotchy dark lines running from the eyes to the caudal fin and turquoise-blue dots scattered over the body.

The fins are long and have a turquoise-blue sheen to them. A bright red colouring is seen in the anal fins and on the body behind the pectoral fin, as well as edging the caudal fin. The head has approximately four horizontal stripes running along the forehead.

Salvini Cichlids require a tank of at least 150 litres with a fine gravel or sand bottom. It does not burrow or destroy plants, which are recommended to use as territories.

The Salvini Cichlid should be provided with numerous rocks and roots for use as hiding places. Plenty of room should be left for open swimming.

They may be housed with smaller fish that are also more aggressive, but be aware, they are territorial and will bite others. The males have pointed fins which is one way to distinguish between the sexes.

Salvini Cichlids make excellent parents, and both the male and female share in the rearing of the fry.

After carefully cleaning the rocks in the tank, the female will deposit up to 500 eggs.

Salvini Cichlid is omnivorous and will eat most prepared and frozen foods, including freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, and ocean plankton, as well as flake food and Cichlid pellets.
