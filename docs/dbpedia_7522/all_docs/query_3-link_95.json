        "text": "Italy’s anti-immigration leader Matteo Salvini, who is trailing the far-right’s Giorgia Meloni in the polls ahead of next week’s general election, sought on Sunday (18 September) to galvanise his hard-right, populist, eurosceptic base.\n\n“This is Italy, full of hope and dreams and looking to the future,” Salvini told the crowd in the northern town of Pontida, which has for three decades been the venue for the annual mass gathering of the far right.\n\nOn Sunday it was awash with the flags representing Italy’s provinces and the banners of the General Labour Union (UGL), founded in 1996 from the ashes of the neo-fascist CISNAL union.\n\nSalvini’s League party claimed 100,000 people had turned up, many bussed in to hear “Il Capitano”, drink beer and buy T-shirts bearing Salvini’s name and the slogan “Italians first”.\n\nThe League is trailing Meloni’s post-fascist Brothers of Italy (FDI), polling at 12% to the FDI’s 24.\n\nSurveys suggest immigration is less of a concern for Italians than the rampant inflation squeezing already stagnant wages.\n\nSalvini hailed the result of the Swedish general election, where voters “sent the left packing” and ushered in an alliance of the right and far right.\n\nHe conceded Americans had rejected former US president Donald Trump and his cry of “America first” in favour of Democrat Joe Biden. “That’s democracy,” he said.\n\nSalvini said the League’s top six priorities were to curb soaring energy prices and develop nuclear power, give more decision-making powers to the regions, make tax and legal reforms, guarantee retirement at 41 years of service and stop immigrant boats landing on Italy’s shores.\n\nHe also proposed scrapping the TV licence fee, defended women’s right to have an abortion and “traditional values” around gender and the family.\n\n‘A lion entering the arena’\n\nThe League, FDI and former leader Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia form a coalition seen as favourites for the 25 September poll.\n\nThe League’s current estimated vote share of 12% would represent a notable decline from its performances in 2018 and 2019 as it participated in successive governments while FDI remained in opposition.\n\nLeague activist Anna Valdotta, 67, told AFP some supporters had not forgiven Salvini and left, but she remained loyal to the man she compared to “a lion entering the arena”.\n\nStefano, a 27-year-old postman, praised Meloni’s leadership and said she had won votes rather than Salvini losing them.\n\nThe League has toned down its secessionist aspirations for Lombardy, focusing instead on what it calls a European Union dominated by Germany and France “that declares war on Italian farmers and fishermen”.\n\nThe mainstream left-wing Democratic Party (PD) held a rally in nearby Monza, where its leader Enrico Letta criticised the Italian right’s links to populist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.\n\nPD is predicted to arrive in second place with 21% of the votes and has no major support among the left and centre.\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
