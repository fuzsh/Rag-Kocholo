        "text": "This afternoon we invited influencers and Youtubers to the ministry, who have millions of kids who follow them, to give us a hand to talk about road safety education, prudence, and safety. “The new code needs to enter not only the norm but also the minds and hearts of 15-16 year olds”. This was stated by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Matteo Salvini, on the sidelines of the presentation of the project \"First Hydrogen Refueling Station in Rome\".\n\n“Even social networks can be used intelligently and not in a demented way and I count on the fact that girls and boys who come today for free help us get into many schools,” added Salvini.\n\nWith the new rules for road safety \"more education, prevention and controls and, for repeat offenders, harsher sanctions up to the definitive revocation of the licence\" wrote the minister in reference to the accident that occurred yesterday in Pesaro, where a BMW with two people on board fleeing the carabinieri hit a car in which two women and a man were travelling. The accident, which caused the death of the driver of the car responsible and of one of the two women aboard the second, as well as the injury of the other passengers on board, represents for the minister a tragedy caused \"by those who do not respect laws and common sense ”. “A prayer for the young mother and a thought for those who were with her and are fighting for her life – added Salvini-. Whoever makes a mistake pays,” said the minister."
