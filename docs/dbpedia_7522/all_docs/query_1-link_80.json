It can be done fulltime but we imagined it being a role where people grow into it because a sales network takes a while to build. We have taken several steps to help speed up the process of building up a viable sales pipeline. 1.We have a sales academy for anyone new to sales. 2.We let our reps continue getting commissions year after year from their clients they bring in (yes this is unusual). 3.We meet with our reps regularly to answer questions and talk about our services. 4.We have a chat where everyone can share information and help each other So yea part time is a thing and it is encouraged.\n\n#hiring *Regional Channel Manager (Remote - West)*, Los Angeles, *United States*, fulltime #jobs #jobseekers #careers #LosAngelesjobs #Californiajobs #SalesMarketing *Apply*: https://lnkd.in/gPR2ph72 Secureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a global cybersecurity leader that secures human progress with Secureworks Taegis , a SaaS-based, open XDR platform built on 20+ years of real-world detection data, security operations expertise, and threat intelligence and research.

In previous years it was common to see a high performing sales person secure a move to a vendor in a completely different area of tech. As we all know, a great solution sales person with plenty of drive should be able to sell anything. Yet hiring managers seem to be under more pressure than ever to get fast results which leads to a tendency to bring in so called 'known quantities' from their space. My advice to sales people who are currently looking for work - 1) Spend time curating a list of companies that are closely aligned to what you have sold in your last 1-3 roles. 2) Be prepared to speak in detail about deals you have recently won in this space. You may have competed with the business you are interviewing with and won! 3) You may need to do more than just send your CV to an online portal to get an interview. If your trusted recruitment partners can't get you in front of them, be prepared to pick up the phone and contact the hiring manager yourself. Leverage internal champions where possible. There is a ton of opportunity in the cyber job market right now. But in order to stand out from the crowd, make sure to be strategic about your approach.\n\n#hiring *Regional Channel Manager (Remote - West)*, San Diego, *United States*, fulltime #jobs #jobseekers #careers #SanDiegojobs #Californiajobs #SalesMarketing *Apply*: https://lnkd.in/d5z8Aftd Secureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a global cybersecurity leader that secures human progress with Secureworks Taegis , a SaaS-based, open XDR platform built on 20+ years of real-world detection data, security operations expertise, and threat intelligence and research.
