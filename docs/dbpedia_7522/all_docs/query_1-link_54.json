        "text": "Taxon Treatments\n\nacuminatus group overview\n\nThis group is composed of two previously undescribed species, Temnothorax acuminatus sp. nov. and T. tuxtlanus sp. nov., which are found in Southern Mexico, from the mountain complexes of Los Tuxtlas and the Sierra Madre de Chiapas at mid-to-high elevations ( ). These species are united by the lack of setae on the dorsum of the propodeum, reduced subpetiolar tooth, moderately impressed metanotal groove, posterodorsally directed propodeal spines, and dark coloration. Members of this group have been collected from bark crevices, from under epiphyte mats on treefalls, and from sifted leaf litter. Species of the acuminatus group may be confused with T. acutispinosus sp. nov., which has an overlapping distribution, similar habitus, and lack of setae on the propodeum. Temnothorax acutispinosus sp. nov. can be distinguished from the acuminatus group by the larger subpetiolar tooth and dorsally directed propodeal spines. The two species of the acuminatus group are sister to the remainder of the salvini clade (Prebus, in prep.).\n\nTemnothorax acuminatus sp. nov.\n\nDistribution: ; worker & gyne: .\n\nTemnothorax mmp07 Prebus, 2017: 8. In phylogeny.\n\nType material examined: Holotype worker: MEXICO: Chiapas: Custepec, 15.72196°N 92.95037°W ± 50 m, 1,530 m, 19 May 2008, J. Longino#6281, mesophyll forest, ex bark crevice in treefall (JTLC000007439) [CASC].\n\nParatype workers and gynes: same data as holotype, 1 dealate gyne (JTLC000007440) [CASC]; same data as holotype, except: J. Longino#6286, under epiphytes in treefall, 1 dealate gyne (JTLC000007452) [MCZC] 1 worker (JTLC000007451) [MCZC] 1 worker (CASENT0869118) [LACM]; same data as holotype, except J. Longino #6278-s, mesophyll forest, foragers, 1 worker (JTLC000007468) [USNM].\n\nNon-type material examined: MEXICO: Chiapas: 5 km NNW Coapilla, 17.18276°N 93.15187°W, 1,915 m, 25 May 2008, LLAMA#Wa-A-04-2-20, secondary mesophyll forest, ex sifted leaf litter, 1 dealate gyne (JTLC000014336) [USNM]; same data as previous, except: 17.18330°N 93.15209°W, 1,915 m, 25 May 2008, LLAMA#Wa-A-04-2-07, secondary mesophyll forest, ex sifted leaf litter, 1 worker (JTLC000014329) [UCDC]; Sierra Morena, 16.13462°N 93.60080°W ± 100 m, 1,780 m, 14 May 2008, D.J. Cox#0031b, at bait along trail, 1 worker (CASENT0609711) [UCDC].\n\nGeographic range: Southern Mexico, mid-to-high elevations in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas ( ).\n\nWorker diagnosis: Temnothorax acuminatus sp. nov. can be separated from all other members of the salvini clade by the following character combination: dorsum of mesosoma very weakly sinuate in profile view; dorsum of propodeum without erect setae; petiole with a weak transverse carina anterodorsally; petiolar peduncle short, comprising about a quarter of the total petiole length; petiolar node cuneiform; postpetiole relatively narrow (PWI < 170); setae on head, mesosoma, waist segments and gaster erect, short, sparse and blunt (never long and tapering); integument dark brown, with mandibles, pronotal neck, tibiae, tarsi, and sting testaceous brown.\n\nSimilar species: Temnothorax achii sp. nov., T. acutispinosus sp. nov., T. altinodus sp. nov., T. ixili, T. subditivus, T. tuxtlanus sp. nov., T. xincai sp. nov., members of the augusti, goniops, and pulchellus groups, and species of the sallei clade. T. acuminatus sp. nov. may be separated from T. acutispinosus sp. nov. by the cuneiform petiolar node (rounded dorsally in T. acutispinosus sp. nov.), smaller subpetiolar tooth, and more posteriorly directed propodeal spines. Temnothorax acuminatus sp. nov. can be distinguished from similar appearing members of the sallei clade (e.g. T. manni (Wheeler), T. mexicanus (Mackay), T. punctithorax (Mackay)) by the sculpture of the head: in similar looking sallei clade species, the head is mostly smooth and shining, with concentric rugulae surrounding the antennal insertions; additionally, the medial lobe of the clypeus is typically smooth, with three distinct longitudinal carina, whereas it is densely costulate-rugulose in T. acuminatus sp. nov. In contrast to all of the remaining species above, T. acuminatus sp. nov. has a cuneiform petiolar node, a feature not found in other members of the salvini clade, except for T. rugosus. Temnothorax acuminatus sp. nov. is easily separated from T. rugosus by the smaller size, lack of medial notch in the anterior margin of the clypeus, lack of setae on the propodeal dorsum, and hind femora that are not incrassate.\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 5): SL = 0.450-0.509 (0.475); FRS = 0.175–0.219 (0.198); CW = 0.575–0.641 (0.611); CWb = 0.542–0.614 (0.575); PoOC = 0.282–0.316 (0.292); CL = 0.645–0.713 (0.666); EL = 0.143–0.164 (0.151); EW = 0.093–0.112 (0.102); MD = 0.132–0.153 (0.141); WL = 0.752–0.837 (0.785); SPST = 0.178–0.195 (0.189); MPST = 0.244–0.286 (0.261); PEL = 0.255–0.278 (0.269); NOL = 0.141–0.159 (0.151); NOH = 0.114–0.128 (0.119); PEH = 0.216–0.240 (0.227); PPL = 0.172–0.211 (0.191); PW = 0.363–0.418 (0.382); SBPA = 0.156–0.184 (0.168); SPTI = 0.187–0.239 (0.207); PEW = 0.147–0.166 (0.154); PNW = 0.112–0.115 (0.114); PPW = 0.227–0.243 (0.235); HFL = 0.487–0.539 (0.510); HFWmax = 0.118–0.131 (0.125); HFWmin = 0.044–0.048 (0.047); CS = 0.865–0.971 (0.908); ES = 0.192–0.218 (0.202); SI = 80–85 (83); OI = 22; CI = 84-88 (86); WLI = 132–139 (137); SBI = 27–30 (29); PSI = 22–26 (24); PWI = 144–164 (152); PLI = 131–158 (142); NI = 112–139 (127); PNWI = 68–78 (74); NLI = 52–61 (56); FI = 265–273 (269).\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, longer than broad (CI 84–88). Mandibles weakly, finely striate but shining and armed with five teeth: the apical-most well developed and acute, followed by a less developed preapical tooth and three equally developed smaller teeth. Anterior clypeal margin weakly convex. Antennal scapes short: when fully retracted, failing to reach the posterior margin of the head capsule by about the maximum width of the scape (SI 80–85). Antennae 12-segmented; antennal club of composed of three segments, with the apical-most segment slightly longer than the preceding two in combination. Frontal carinae short, extending past the antennal toruli by about one and a half times the maximum width of the antennal scape. Compound eyes weakly protruding past the lateral margins of the head capsule. Lateral margin of head weakly convex, forming a continuous arc from the mandibular insertions to the posterior margin of the head. Posterior head margin weakly concave medially, rounding evenly into the lateral margins.\n\nIn profile view, compound eyes elongate-ovular and small (OI 22), with 10 ommatidia in longest row. Pronotal declivity indistinct, neck and anterior face of pronotum forming a ~120° angle. Mesosoma weakly sinuate: evenly convex from where it joins the pronotal neck to the metanotal groove; propodeum slightly depressed below the level of the promesonotum, and weakly convex. Promesonotal suture extending from the posterior margin of the procoxal insertion to the mesothoracic spiracle, which is moderately well developed, then continuing dorsally as a weak sulcus. Metanotal groove visible as a disruption of the sculpture laterally from where it arises between the mid- and hind coxae to the poorly developed metathoracic spiracle, which is nearly indistinguishable against the ground sculpture, then continuing dorsally as a weak impression. Propodeal spiracle weakly developed, directed posterolaterally, and separated from the propodeal declivity by about four spiracle diameters. Propodeal spines short (PSI 22–26), about two thirds the length of the propodeal declivity, tapering evenly from the base, straight, and acute. Propodeal declivity with a weak carinae joining base of propodeal spine and propodeal lobe; weakly concave, forming a rounded ~120° angle with the base of the propodeal spines. Propodeal lobes rounded and weakly developed, but dorsal margin weakly angulate. Metapleural gland bulla small, extending from the metacoxal insertion halfway to the propodeal spiracle. Petiole short (PLI 131–158), with tubercles anterodorsally. Subpetiolar process in the form of a small, blunt, triangular tooth which grades evenly into the ventral margin of the petiole posteriorly; ventral margin of petiole weakly bulging posterior to it. Petiolar peduncle short: comprising about a quarter of the total petiole length. Petiolar node erect and cuneiform: peduncle grading evenly into the anterior node face; anterior face forming a ~70° angle with the evenly rounded posterior face; posterior face forms a ~120° angle with the caudal cylinder. Postpetiole weakly rounded anteriorly, anterior face rounds evenly into the weakly rounded dorsal face; weakly lobed ventrally.\n\nIn dorsal view, humeri developed and distinct: evenly rounded and wider than the rest of the mesosoma; mesothoracic spiracles weakly protruding past the lateral margins of the mesosoma, visible as slight angles where the pronotum meets the mesonotum. Promesonotal groove visible as a weak sulcus and disruption in the ground sculpture. Metanotal groove visible as a weak impression. Propodeal spines broadly approximated basally and weakly diverging apically, their apices separated from each other by about twice their length, the negative space between them “U” shaped. Petiolar peduncle with spiracles weakly protruding past the lateral margins, but not noticeably constricted anterior to them. Petiolar node, when viewed at a posterodorsal aspect, tapering evenly from the base, with the dorsal margin evenly and strongly convex; apex of node narrower than the peduncle and caudal cylinder. Postpetiole narrow (PWI 144–164) and subquadrate. Anterior margin of the postpetiole flat and evenly rounds into the lateral margins through a ~90° angle; lateral margins weakly converge to the rounded posterior corners; posterior margin broadly concave. Metafemur moderately incrassate (FI 265–273).\n\nSculpture: median clypeal carina present, extending posteriorly nearly to the frontal triangle, and flanked on either side by multiple weaker carinae; clypeus appears costulate-rugulose. Lateral clypeal lobes with additional, weaker carinae; ground sculpture weakly areolate. Antennal scapes weakly areolate. Cephalic dorsum predominantly areolate-rugulose, with the areolae arranged into longitudinal rows by fine costulae; very fine concentric rugulae surrounding the antennal insertions. Lateral surfaces of head sculptured similarly to the dorsum, but with areolae arranged into concentric whorls by fine costulae above the compound eyes; fine rugulose sculpture overlying the areolate sculpture between the compound eye and mandibular insertion. Ventral surface of head smooth and shining. Pronotal neck and anterior face of the pronotum shining through weak, transversely arranged areolae. Lateral surface of the pronotum shining medially, with weak costulae and areolae around the margins. Meso- and metapleurae areolate, with fine costulae overlying the ground sculpture. Smooth and shining between the propodeal spiracle and the propodeal spines. Dorsal surface of mesosoma uniformly areolate, with fine strigulae on the anterior margin of the pronotum. Femora shining, with weak areolate sculpture on the distal third. Petiole predominantly weakly areolate; anterior face of petiolar node smooth and shining. Postpetiole predominantly weakly areolate; anterior face smooth and shining. First gastral tergite and sternite smooth and shining, without spectral iridescence.\n\nSetae: antennal scapes and funiculi with short, decumbent pilosity. Dorsum of the head, pronotum, waist segments, and gaster with moderately abundant, erect, blunt-tipped setae, the longest of which are about half the width of the compound eye. The head bears ~32, mesosoma ~16, petiole 4, postpetiole ~8, and first gastral tergite ~56 setae. Short, sparse pubescence present over the entire body, but difficult to detect against the densely sculptured integument.\n\nColor: predominantly dark brown, with mandibles, pronotal neck, tibiae, tarsi, and sting testaceous brown.\n\nGyne measurements & indices (n = 3): SL = 0.495–0.513 (0.506); FRS = 0.22–0.231 (0.226); CW = 0.72–0.739 (0.727); CWb = 0.668–0.719 (0.691); PoOC = 0.295–0.304 (0.3); CL = 0.727–0.75 (0.739); EL = 0.212–0.22 (0.217); EW = 0.157–0.173 (0.164); MD = 0.139–0.159 (0.146); WL = 1.171–1.205 (1.193); SPST = 0.211–0.272 (0.247); MPST = 0.278–0.333 (0.307); PEL = 0.312–0.365 (0.343); NOL = 0.17–0.217 (0.197); NOH = 0.131–0.146 (0.139); PEH = 0.273–0.293 (0.28); PPL = 0.215–0.242 (0.225); APT = 1–1 (1); PW = 0.651–0.699 (0.677); SBPA = 0.305–0.325 (0.312); SPTI = 0.305–0.319 (0.311); PEW = 0.189–0.212 (0.204); PNW = 0.126–0.146 (0.138); PPW = 0.301–0.33 (0.314); HFL = 0.59–0.614 (0.603); HFWmax = 0.128–0.152 (0.138); HFWmin = 0.053–0.065 (0.059); CS = 1.032–1.094 (1.061); ES = 0.299–0.3 (0.299); SI = 71–74 (73); OI = 27–29 (28); CI = 92–96 (93); WLI = 167–176 (173); SBI = 43–47 (45); PSI = 18–23 (21); PWI = 147–159 (154); PLI = 145–168 (153); NI = 122–166 (143); PNWI = 59–75 (68); NLI = 54–62 (57); FI = 205–258 (235).\n\nGyne description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, slightly longer than broad (CI 92–96).

Dorsum of the head, pronotum, waist segments, and gaster with moderately abundant, flexuous, tapering setae, the longest of which are about half the width of the compound eye. Short, sparse pubescence present over the entire body, but difficult to detect against the densely sculptured integument.\n\nColor: predominantly dark brown, with mandibles, pronotal neck, tibiae, tarsi, and sting testaceous brown.\n\nMale: Unknown.\n\nEtymology: Morphological, from the Latin ‘acuminatus’ (= pointed, tapering), in reference to the cuneiform petiolar node.\n\nComments: Temnothorax acuminatus sp. nov. has been collected from several high elevation mesophyll forest localities in Chiapas state, Mexico. The type series was collected in the same treefall as the holotype of T. acutispinosus sp. nov., under epiphytes and in bark crevices. Additional workers have been collected from Winkler leaf litter extraction and terrestrial baiting; it remains unclear whether this species is strictly arboreal. This species is most closely related to T. tuxtlanus sp. nov. from the Los Tuxtlas volcano complex in Veracruz state.\n\nTemnothorax tuxtlanus sp. nov.\n\nDistribution: ; worker: .\n\nType material examined: Holotype worker: MEXICO: Veracruz: Ruiz Cortinez, 12 km NE San Andrés Tuxtla, 18.53194°N -95.14302°W ± 20 m, 1,140 m, 3 June 2016, ADMAC#Wa-F-02-2-31, montane wet forest, ex sifted leaf litter (CASENT0640472) [CASC].\n\nGeographic range: Southern Mexico, mid elevation of the Los Tuxtlas volcano complex ( ).\n\nWorker diagnosis: Temnothorax tuxtlanus sp. nov. can be separated from all other members of the salvini clade by the following character combination: dorsum of mesosoma weakly sinuate in profile view; dorsum of propodeum without erect setae; petiole with a weak transverse carina anterodorsally; petiolar peduncle short, comprising about a quarter of the total petiole length; petiolar node rounded dorsally; postpetiole relatively narrow (PWI < 170); setae on head, mesosoma, waist segments and gaster erect, short, sparse and blunt (never long and tapering); integument black, with antennae, mandibles, pronotal neck, coxae, and femora dark brown; trochanters, tibiae, and tarsi testaceous yellow.\n\nSimilar species: Temnothorax achii sp. nov., , T. acuminatus sp. nov., T. acutispinosus sp. nov., T. altinodus sp. nov., T. ixili, T. subditivus, T. xincai sp. nov., members of the augusti and pulchellus groups, and species of the sallei clade. Temnothorax tuxtlanus sp. nov. can be distinguished from similar appearing members of the sallei clade (e.g. T. manni, T. mexicanus, T. punctithorax) by the sculpture of the head: in similar looking sallei clade species, the head is mostly smooth and shining, with concentric costulae surrounding the antennal insertions; additionally, the medial lobe of the clypeus is typically smooth, with three distinct carinae, whereas it is densely costulate-rugulose in T. tuxtlanus sp. nov. In contrast to all of the remaining species above, the petiole of T. tuxtlanus sp. nov. has a weak transverse carina anterodorsally, a feature not found in other members of the salvini clade, except for T. acuminatus sp. nov., T. altinodus sp. nov., T. rugosus, and the annexus group. Temnothorax tuxtlanus sp. nov. is easily separated from all of the preceding species, except T. acuminatus sp. nov., by the weakly incrassate hind femora (FI < 300) and lack of a medial notch in the anterior margin of the clypeus. Temnothorax tuxtlanus sp. nov. can be distinguished from T. acuminatus sp. nov. by the dorsally rounded petiolar node, which is cuneiform in T. acuminatus sp. nov. Finally, this species may be distinguished from the morphologically similar T. acutispinosus sp. nov. by the smaller subpetiolar tooth and more posteriorly directed propodeal spines.\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 1): SL = 0.524; FRS = 0.222; CW = 0.671; CWb = 0.630; PoOC = 0.316; CL = 0.720; EL = 0.178; EW = 0.116; MD = 0.142; WL = 0.869; SPST = 0.185; MPST = 0.268; PEL = 0.329; NOL = 0.190; NOH = 0.118; PEH = 0.224; PPL = 0.229; PW = 0.423; SBPA = 0.199; SPTI = 0.204; PEW = 0.165; PNW = 0.128; PPW = 0.239; HFL = 0.551; HFWmax = 0.132; HFWmin = 0.047; CS = 0.990; ES = 0.236; SI = 83; OI = 24; CI = 88; WLI = 138; SBI = 32; PSI = 21; PWI = 145; PLI = 144; NI = 161; PNWI = 78; NLI = 58; FI = 281.\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, longer than broad (CI 88).

The closest known relative of T. tuxtlanus sp. nov. is T. acuminatus sp. nov. from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Chiapas state.

It is morphologically similar to the members of the acuminatus group, with which it overlaps geographically ( ), but differs from them by the larger subpetiolar tooth and dorsally directed propodeal spines. However, T. acutispinosus sp. nov. is apparently more closely related to the members of the rugosus and annexus groups (Prebus, in prep.).\n\nTemnothorax acutispinosus sp. nov.\n\nDistribution & worker: .\n\nTemnothorax mmp06 Prebus, 2017: 7.

Temnothorax acutispinosus sp. nov. can be distinguished from similar appearing members of the sallei clade (e.g., T. manni, T. mexicanus, T. punctithorax) by the petiole, which lacks a transverse carina anterodorsally. In contrast to all of the above species (except T. altinodus sp. nov.), T. acutispinosus sp. nov. has acute, dorsally directed propodeal spines. Temnothorax acutispinosus sp. nov. can be distinguished from T. altinodus sp. nov. by the relatively compact mesosoma (WLI 131–136 vs. 148 in T. altinodus sp. nov.) and weakly incrassate hind femora, which are enlarged in T. altinodus sp. nov.\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 3): SL = 0.533–0.608 (0.567); FRS = 0.201–0.232 (0.217); CW = 0.689–0.770 (0.725); CWb = 0.636–0.725 (0.675); PoOC = 0.287–0.324 (0.302); CL = 0.721–0.816 (0.764); EL = 0.165–0.195 (0.179); EW = 0.122–0.124 (0.123); MD = 0.180–0.210 (0.198); WL = 0.867–0.964 (0.899); SPST = 0.188–0.233 (0.211); MPST = 0.272–0.338 (0.298); PEL = 0.325–0.337 (0.331); NOL = 0.183–0.204 (0.195); NOH = 0.137–0.139 (0.138); PEH = 0.238–0.263 (0.25); PPL = 0.200–0.231 (0.213); PW = 0.402–0.464 (0.431); SBPA = 0.157–0.180 (0.166); SPTI = 0.208–0.210 (0.209); PEW = 0.148–0.170 (0.158); PNW = 0.155–0.163 (0.158); PPW = 0.258–0.271 (0.263); HFL = 0.564–0.652 (0.599); HFWmax = 0.144–0.169 (0.158); HFWmin = 0.050–0.062 (0.055); CS = 0.997–1.133 (1.057); ES = 0.227–0.257 (0.240); SI = 84; OI = 23; CI = 88–89 (88); WLI = 131–136 (133); SBI = 24–25 (25); PSI = 22–27 (24); PWI = 159–175 (166); PLI = 146–163 (156); NI = 134–149 (141); PNWI = 96–105 (100); NLI = 56–61 (59); FI = 258–319 (288).\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, longer than broad (CI 88–89).

This species is apparently a canopy dweller, and probably nests arboreally: the types were collected from under epiphytes on a treefall or via canopy baiting. Temnothorax acutispinosus sp. nov. is closely related to the rugosus and annexus species groups from Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Southwestern United States, all of which are apparently arboreal.\n\naltinodus group overview\n\nThis group is monotypic, with the nominal Temnothorax altinodus sp. nov. being the only member. It is morphologically similar to the members of the acuminatus and acutispinosus groups, sharing a lack of setae on the propodeal dorsum. It can be distinguished from these groups by the larger subpetiolar tooth (small in the acuminatus group) and the incrassate femora (not incrassate in the acuminatus and acutispinosus groups). Known from a single collection in the mid elevations of Honduras ( ), this species is apparently sister to the fuscatus and pergandei groups (Prebus, in prep.).\n\nTemnothorax altinodus sp. nov.\n\nDistribution & worker: .\n\nType material examined: Holotype worker: HONDURAS: Cortés: Parque Nacional Cusuco, 15.48896°N 88.23439°W ± 70 m, 1,290 m, 1 June 2010, LLAMA#Go-C-06-4-03, mesophyll forest, beating vegetation (CASENT0617708) [CASC].\n\nGeographic range: Honduras, mid elevations of the Central American Nucleus (Cortés) ( ).\n\nWorker diagnosis: Temnothorax altinodus sp. nov. can be separated from all other species in the salvini clade by the following character combination: antennal scapes short, failing to reach the posterior margin of the head capsule by about the maximum width of the scape (SI 83); mesosoma relatively elongate (WLI 148); dorsum of propodeum without erect setae; propodeal spines directed dorsally; hind femora strongly incrassate (FI 327); petiole with a weak transverse carina anterodorsally; petiolar node compact (NI 143); in dorsal view, apex of petiolar node narrower than caudal cylinder; petiolar node dorsally rounded; postpetiole moderately broad (PWI 202); integument predominantly black; setae on head, mesosoma, waist segments and gaster erect, moderately long, sparse and blunt (never long and tapering).\n\nSimilar species: Temnothorax achii sp. nov., T. acuminatus sp. nov., T. acutispinosus sp. nov., T. ixili, T. subditivus, T. tuxtlanus sp. nov., T. xincai sp. nov., members of the augusti and pulchellus groups, and species of the sallei clade. Temnothorax altinodus sp. nov. can be distinguished from similar appearing members of the sallei clade (e.g. T. manni, T. mexicanus, T. punctithorax) by the sculpture of the head: in similar looking sallei clade species, the head is mostly smooth and shining, with concentric costulae surrounding the antennal insertions; additionally, the medial lobe of the clypeus is typically smooth, with three distinct carinae, whereas it is densely costulate-rugulose in T. altinodus sp. nov. In contrast to all of the remaining species above, the petiole of T. altinodus sp. nov. has a weak transverse carina anterodorsally, a feature not found in other members of the salvini clade, except for T. acuminatus sp. nov., T. tuxtlanus sp. nov., T. rugosus, and members of the annexus group. Temnothorax altinodus sp. nov. is easily separated from T. acutispinosus sp. nov., T. acuminatus sp. nov. and T. tuxtlanus sp. nov. by the hind femora, which are incrassate in T. altinodus sp. nov.; it may be distinguished from T. rugosus and the members of the annexus group by the anterior margin of the clypeus, which entire in T. altinodus sp. nov., as opposed to medially emarginate.\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 1): SL = 0.607; FRS = 0.223; CW = 0.773; CWb = 0.727; PoOC = 0.343; CL = 0.823; EL = 0.188; EW = 0.131; MD = 0.164; WL = 1.079; SPST = 0.252; MPST = 0.353; PEL = 0.38; NOL = 0.22; NOH = 0.154; PEH = 0.272; PPL = 0.190; PPH = 0.276; PW = 0.499; SBPA = 0.197; SPTI = 0.266; PEW = 0.157; PNW = 0.146; PPW = 0.317; HFL = 0.715; HFWmax = 0.209; HFWmin = 0.064; CS = 1.1385; ES = 0.254; SI = 83; OI = 22; CI = 88; WLI = 148; SBI = 27; PSI = 23; PWI = 202; PLI = 200; NI = 143; PNWI = 93; NLI = 58; FI = 327.\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, longer than broad (CI 88). Mandibles densely striate but shining and armed with five teeth: the apical-most well developed and acute, followed by a less developed preapical tooth and three equally developed smaller teeth. Anterior clypeal margin flat medially. Antennal scapes short: when fully retracted, failing to reach the posterior margin of the head capsule by about the maximum width of the scape (SI 83). Antennae 12-segmented; antennal club of composed of three segments, with the apical-most segment about one and a half times as long as the preceding two in combination. Frontal carinae moderately long, extending past the antennal toruli by about two times the maximum width of the antennal scape. Compound eyes weakly protruding past the lateral margins of the head capsule. Lateral margin of head weakly convex, forming a continuous arc from the mandibular insertions to the posterior margin of the head. Posterior head margin flat but rounding evenly into the lateral margins.\n\nIn profile view, compound eyes ovular and small (OI 22), with 11 ommatidia in longest row. Pronotal declivity indistinct, neck and anterior face of pronotum forming a ~120° angle. Mesosoma evenly rounded anteriorly and flat dorsally to the bases of the propodeal spines. Promesonotal suture extending from the posterior margin of the procoxal insertion to the mesothoracic spiracle, which is moderately well developed. Metanotal groove visible as a disruption of the sculpture laterally from where it arises between the mid- and hind coxae to where it ends in the poorly developed metathoracic spiracle, which is nearly indistinguishable against the ground sculpture. Propodeal spiracle well developed, directed posterolaterally, and separated from the propodeal declivity by about three spiracle diameters. Propodeal spines moderately well developed (PSI 23), about as long as the propodeal declivity, tapering evenly from the base, straight, and acute. Propodeal declivity weakly concave, forming a rounded ~120° angle with the base of the propodeal spines. Propodeal lobes rounded and weakly developed. Metapleural gland bulla moderately large, extending from the metacoxal insertion two thirds of the way to the propodeal spiracle. Petiole moderately long (PLI 200), with moderately well-developed tubercles anterodorsally. Subpetiolar process in the form of a small, posteriorly directed, blunt tooth; ventral margin of petiole flat concave posterior to it. Petiolar peduncle short: comprising about a third of the total length of the petiole. Petiolar node erect: transition between peduncle and node marked by a rounded angle of ~140°, resulting in a weakly concave anterior node face; anterior face forming a ~90° angle with the dorsal face, which is weakly convex; dorsal face meeting the posterior face at a ~100° angle; posterior face forming a ~90° angle with the caudal cylinder. Postpetiole evenly rounded anterodorsally, bulging before flattening posterodorsally; lobed ventrally.\n\nIn dorsal view, humeri developed and distinct: evenly rounded and wider than the rest of the mesosoma; mesothoracic spiracles weakly protruding past the lateral margins of the mesosoma, visible as slight angles where the pronotum meets the mesonotum. Promesonotal suture visible as a slight disruption in the ground sculpture. Metanotal groove absent: mesonotum and propodeum completely fused and lateral margins converging evenly to the bases of the propodeal spines. Propodeal spines broadly approximated basally and diverging apically, their apices separated from each other by about their length, the negative space between them “U” shaped. Petiolar peduncle with spiracles protruding past the lateral margins; peduncle broadened where they arise. Petiolar node subquadrate; node slightly broader than the peduncle, and evenly grading into the caudal cylinder, which is slightly wider than the node. Postpetiole moderately broad (PWI 202) and campaniform, articulating with the nearly the entire anterior margin of the gaster but leaving small angulate corners exposed. Anterior margin of the postpetiole weakly convex and evenly rounds into the lateral margins, which diverge slightly to the angulate posterior corners; posterior margin flat. Metafemur incrassate (FI 327).\n\nSculpture: median clypeal carina present, extending posteriorly to the frontal triangle, and flanked on either side by two equally strong carinae. Lateral clypeal lobes with additional, weaker carinae; ground sculpture weakly areolate. Antennal scapes areolate-costulate. Cephalic dorsum densely areolate-rugulose, with fine rugose sculpture overlying it. Lateral surfaces of sculptured similarly to the dorsum, but with areolate-rugulose sculpture becoming stronger between compound eye and mandibular insertion. Ventral surface of head longitudinally areolate-costulate. Pronotal neck weakly areolate. Lateral surfaces of mesosoma densely areolate, with fine rugose-costulate sculpture overlying it. Propodeal declivity weakly areolate. Dorsal surface of mesosoma densely areolate, with fine rugose overlying it. Femora shining through weak areolate sculpture.

Postpetiole uniformly areolate. First gastral tergite weakly areolate on the basal quarter, otherwise smooth and shining, with weak spectral iridescence. First gastral sternite smooth and shining.\n\nSetae: antennal scapes and funiculi with short, adpressed pilosity. Dorsum of the head, pronotum, waist segments, and gaster with sparse, short, erect, blunt-tipped setae, the longest of which are slightly less than the width of the compound eye. The head bears ~16, mesosoma ~8 restricted to the promesonotum, petiole 2, postpetiole ~4, and first gastral tergite ~20 setae. Short, sparse pubescence present over the entire body, but difficult to detect against the densely sculptured integument.\n\nColor: predominantly black, with dark brown antennae, mandibles, and legs (excluding tarsi). Tarsi and sting testaceous yellow.\n\nGyne: Unknown.\n\nMale: Unknown.\n\nEtymology: Morphological, from the Latin ‘altus’ (= high, tall) + ‘nodus’ (= node), a reference to the very tall petiolar node.\n\nComments: Temnothorax altinodus sp. nov. is known only from the holotype worker, collected via beating vegetation in a mid-elevation mesophyll forest in northwestern Honduras. This species is most closely related to the exclusively arboreally nesting fuscatus species group, which ranges from Central Mexico to Costa Rica, and the pergandei group, ground nesting species ranging from the northern United States to Nicaragua (Prebus, in prep.).\n\nannexus group overview\n\nConsisting of five species (four of which are newly described here), the annexus group is a relatively small one, with a range spanning the low-to-mid elevations of the American southwest to central Mexico ( ). Although collections for many of these species are scant, all nest collections so far have been from habitats associated with vegetation, either from epiphytes (Temnothorax annexus) or from hollow branches and stems on live vegetation (T. arbustus sp. nov., T. balnearius sp. nov., T. obtusigaster sp. nov., and T. quercicola sp. nov.). As collections accumulate, this may prove to be the rule. Temnothorax quercicola sp. nov. has a long history of being conflated with T. silvestrii, to the extent that Creighton (1953) described the male and gyne of T. quercicola sp. nov. as T. silvestrii. The two species are superficially similar, but T. silvestrii belongs to another clade entirely (the sallei clade), in yet another example of convergent evolution in Temnothorax. See the comments under T. quercicola sp. nov. below for a more detailed discussion. These species are large, and typically have an emarginate clypeus, short petiolar peduncle, subquadrate petiolar node, and incrassate femora.\n\nTemnothorax annexus (Baroni Urbani, 1978)\n\nDistribution: ; worker: .\n\nMacromischa annectens Wheeler, 1931: 11.

Nomen novum for Leptothorax annectens (Wheeler): 11 (nec Leptothorax curvispinosus ssp. annectens Wheeler, 1903b: 242).\n\nTemnothorax annexus (Baroni Urbani): Bolton, 2003: 271. First combination in Temnothorax.\n\nType material examined: Lectotype worker: MEXICO: Morelos: Cuernavaca, 26 June 1929, E. Skwarra#Z867/Sk., ex Tillandsia circinnata, 1 worker (M.C.Z. co-type 2-3 16359, MCZENT00561747, bottom specimen on pin) [MCZC].\n\nParalectotype workers: same pin as lectotype, 1 worker (top specimen on pin); same data as lectotype, 2 teneral workers (M.C.Z. co-type 4-5 16359, MCZENT00561746) [MCZC].\n\nGeographic range: South-Central Mexico, mid elevations of the Southern Sierra Madre ( ).\n\nWorker diagnosis: Temnothorax annexus can be separated from all other species in the salvini clade by the following character combination: subdecumbent setae present on gula; metanotal groove absent; propodeum bearing erect setae; propodeum not depressed; propodeal spines short, slightly shorter than the propodeal declivity (PSI 28–29); hind femora strongly incrassate (FI 338–349); petiole with a moderately long peduncle: peduncle comprising about half of the total length of the petiole; petiolar node erect and subquadrate, not overhanging the caudal cylinder; postpetiole narrow (PWI 169–173); first gastral tergite smooth and shining; integument testaceous; dorsum of head, mesosoma, waist segments and gaster with erect, short, blunt-tipped setae; legs without erect setae.\n\nSimilar species: Temnothorax andersoni (Mackay), T. andrei (Emery), T. aureus sp. nov., T. aztecoides sp. nov., T. aztecus, T. carinatus (Cole), T. casanovai sp. nov., T. cokendolpheri (Mackay), T. goniops, T. nitens (Emery), T. paraztecus sp. nov., T. punctaticeps (Mackay), T. rugosus, T. subditivus (light form), T. tenuisculptus, T. terrigena, T. wardi Snelling et al., and species of the annexus, fuscatus, and silvestrii groups. Temnothorax annexus can be separated from T. andersoni, T. andrei, T. aztecoides sp. nov., T. aztecus, T. carinatus, T. cokendolpheri, T. goniops, T. nitens, T. terrigena, T. wardi, and species of the silvestrii group by the strongly incrassate hind femora (FI > 330). Furthermore, it can be distinguished from T. andersoni, T. andrei, T. aztecoides sp. nov., T. aztecus, T. carinatus, T. cokendolpheri, T. goniops, T. nitens, T. terrigena, and the silvestrii group by the anterior clypeal margin, which is emarginate in T. annexus. The absence of erect, long, tapering setae on the body will separate T. annexus from T. aztecoides sp. nov., T. aztecus, and T. paraztecus sp. nov., while the erect, subquadrate petiolar node differentiates T. annexus from the fuscatus group, T. punctaticeps, T. rugosus, T. subditivus, and nearly all other species listed above. To separate T. annexus from other members of the annexus group, look for the following character combination: a continuous dorsal margin of the mesosoma in profile (propodeum not depressed as in T. tenuisculptus); decumbent setae on the gular region (T. arbustus sp. nov., T. balnearius sp. nov., and T. obtusigaster sp. nov. have erect setae); propodeal spines slightly shorter than the propodeal declivity (PSI ~ 29), pedunculate petiole, with the peduncle comprising about half the total petiole length, and heavily sculptured, predominantly areolate-rugose head and mesosoma will all distinguish T. annexus from T. quercicola sp. nov.\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 3): SL = 0.759–0.766 (0.762); FRS = 0.261–0.302 (0.284); CW = 0.891–0.917 (0.904); CWb = 0.778–0.826 (0.807); PoOC = 0.350–0.378 (0.367); CL = 0.947–0.993 (0.973); EL = 0.218–0.238 (0.226); EW = 0.163–0.182 (0.173); MD = 0.236–0.262 (0.245); WL = 1.304–1.395 (1.345); SPST = 0.361–0.408 (0.387); MPST = 0.433–0.435 (0.434); PEL = 0.505–0.529 (0.514); NOL = 0.299–0.313 (0.304); NOH = 0.185–0.204 (0.198); PEH = 0.322–0.344 (0.336); PPL = 0.229–0.248 (0.241); PW = 0.572–0.622 (0.590); SBPA = 0.243–0.290 (0.272); SPTI = 0.329–0.340 (0.333); PEW = 0.230–0.234 (0.233); PNW = 0.250–0.273 (0.260); PPW = 0.389–0.405 (0.400); HFL = 0.835–0.850 (0.841); HFWmax = 0.251–0.274 (0.266); HFWmin = 0.072–0.081 (0.078); CS = 1.252–1.323 (1.294); ES = 0.300–0.329 (0.312); SI = 92–98 (94); OI = 23–25 (24); CI = 82–84 (83); WLI = 163–169 (167); SBI = 30–37 (34); PSI = 28–29 (29); PWI = 169–173 (172); PLI = 206–221 (213); NI = 147–162 (154); PNWI = 107–117 (112); NLI = 59; FI = 338–349 (342).\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, longer than broad (CI 82–84). Mandibles densely, finely striate but shining and armed with five teeth: the apical-most well developed and acute, followed by a less developed preapical tooth and three equally developed smaller teeth. Anterior clypeal margin emarginated medially. Antennal scapes moderately long: when fully retracted, just reaching the posterior margin of the head capsule (SI 92–98). Antennae 12-segmented; antennal club of composed of three segments, with the apical-most segment about one and a half times as long as the preceding two in combination. Frontal carinae short, extending past the antennal toruli by about one and a half times the maximum width of the antennal scape. Compound eyes moderately protruding past the lateral margins of the head capsule. Lateral margin of head weakly convex, forming a continuous arc from the mandibular insertions to the posterior margin of the head. Posterior head margin weakly emarginate medially but rounding evenly into the lateral margins.\n\nIn profile view, compound eyes ovular and moderately large (OI 23–25), with 13 ommatidia in longest row. Pronotal declivity distinct: dorsal margin of anterior face of pronotum marked by a carina; neck and anterior face of pronotum forming a ~120° angle. Mesosoma very weakly convex from where it joins the pronotal declivity to the propodeal spines, nearly flat. Promesonotal suture extending from the posterior margin of the procoxal insertion only to the mesothoracic spiracle, which is moderately well developed. Metanotal groove visible as a disruption of the sculpture laterally from where it arises between the mid- and hind coxae to where it ends in the poorly developed metathoracic spiracle, which is nearly indistinguishable against the ground sculpture. Propodeal spiracle well developed, directed posterolaterally, and separated from the propodeal declivity by about four spiracle diameters. Propodeal spines moderately well developed and moderately long (PSI 28–29), about as long as the propodeal declivity, flared at the base, downcurved, and blunt. Propodeal declivity weakly concave, forming a rounded ~110° angle with the base of the propodeal spines. Propodeal lobes rounded and weakly developed. Metapleural gland bulla small, extending from the metacoxal insertion halfway to the propodeal spiracle. Petiole moderately long (PLI 206–221), with weakly developed tubercles anterodorsally. Subpetiolar process in the form of a small, blunt tooth; ventral margin of petiole flat posterior to it. Petiolar peduncle moderately long: comprising about half of the total petiole length. Petiolar node robust, erect, and subquadrate: transition between peduncle and node marked by a rounded angle of ~120°; anterior face forming a ~110° angle with the dorsal face, which is weakly convex, nearly flat; dorsal face meeting the posterior face at a ~90° angle, which forms a ~100° angle with the caudal cylinder. Postpetiole flat anteriorly, bulging slightly anterodorsally before flattening posterodorsally; weakly lobed ventrally.\n\nIn dorsal view, humeri moderately well developed: evenly rounded and barely wider than the rest of the mesosoma; mesothoracic spiracles weakly protruding past the lateral margins of the mesosoma, visible as slight angles where the pronotum meets the mesonotum. Promesonotal suture represented by a disruption in the ground sculpture. Metanotal groove absent: mesonotum and propodeum completely fused and lateral margins converging evenly to the bases of the propodeal spines. Propodeal spines broadly approximated basally and weakly diverging apically, their apices separated from each other by slightly more than their length, the negative space between them “U” shaped. Petiolar peduncle with spiracles not protruding past the lateral margins. Petiolar node nearly evenly ovular, but posterior margin flattened; node broader than the peduncle, and evenly grading into the caudal cylinder, which is the same width as the node. Postpetiole narrow (PWI 169–173) and subquadrate. Anterior margin of the postpetiole flat and evenly rounds into the lateral margins, which diverge slightly to the rounded posterior corners; posterior margin flat. Metafemur strongly incrassate (FI 338–349).\n\nSculpture: median clypeal carina present, extending posteriorly to the frontal triangle, and flanked on either side by two equally strong carinae. Lateral clypeal lobes with additional, weaker carinae; ground sculpture shining through weak areolae. Antennal scapes areolate. Cephalic dorsum areolate, with coarse rugae over the ground sculpture; concentric costulae surrounding the antennal insertions; overlying sculpture primarily costate between the frontal carinae. Lateral surfaces of head areolate, with coarse rugae over the ground sculpture. Ventral surface of head smooth and shining anteromedially, but otherwise weakly areolate-costulate. Pronotal neck areolate. Lateral surfaces mesosoma areolate with coarse rugae over the ground sculpture, but with longitudinal rugae stronger than transverse rugae. Propodeal declivity areolate-rugulose. Dorsal surface of mesosoma sculptured similarly to the lateral surface, but stronger longitudinal rugae restricted to the pronotum. Femora finely, densely areolate. Petiole uniformly areolate; a weak carina present laterally, extending longitudinally from the petiolar spiracle to the caudal cylinder; weak rugae on the dorsal and posterior faces of the node. Postpetiole uniformly areolate, with weak rugulose sculpture on the lateral faces. First gastral tergite areolate, but with sculpture becoming weaker posteriorly, without spectral iridescence. First gastral sternite smooth and shining, without spectral iridescence.\n\nSetae: antennal scapes and funiculi with short, adpressed pilosity. Dorsum of the head, pronotum, waist segments, and gaster with moderately abundant, erect, blunt-tipped setae, the longest of which are about half the width of the compound eye. The head bears ~18, mesosoma ~26, petiole 10, postpetiole ~16, and first gastral tergite ~20 setae. Short, sparse pubescence present over the entire body, but difficult to detect against the densely sculptured integument.\n\nColor: predominantly testaceous, with apex of mandibles dark brown.\n\nGyne: Unknown.\n\nMale: Unknown.\n\nEtymology: In the original description, Wheeler (1931) states that this species, which he placed in Macromischa, nonetheless bears many features of the rottenbergii group of the Palearctic. Presumably ‘annectens’ (= connected) from Greek refers to the implied link between these taxa.\n\nComments: Known only from the type series, which was collected from Tillandsia circinnata epiphytes near Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico by Elizabeth Skwarra. Temnothorax annexus has close relatives in Baja California, Arizona, and Sonora that nest in dead vegetation, including live branches of oak trees. It is morphologically convergent with, but not particularly closely related to, members of the rottenbergii group of the Palearctic, or the sallei clade of southern North America, Central America, and the Greater Antilles (Baroni Urbani, 1978; Fontenla Rizo, 2000; Prebus, 2017).\n\nTemnothorax arbustus sp. nov.\n\nDistribution: ; worker: .\n\nTemnothorax sp. nr. peninsularis Prebus, 2017: 7.

Temnothorax arbustus sp. nov. can be separated from all of the above species, except for T. rugosus and other members of the annexus group, by the medially emarginate anterior clypeal margin. Furthermore, it can be distinguished from T. caguatan and T. whitfordi by the 12-segmented antennae, which are 11-segmented in the latter two. Additionally, the absence of long, tapering setae on the legs and most other surfaces of the body will differentiate T. arbustus sp. nov. from T. politus. The erect, subquadrate petiolar node of T. arbustus sp. nov. contrasts with the node of T. subditivus, which is squamiform, and the node of T. rugosus, which is cuneiform to subcuneiform. The dorsal margin of the mesosoma is continuous in T. arbustus sp. nov. (as opposed to sinuate with a depressed propodeum in T. tenuisculptus). Within the annexus group, the following characters distinguish T. arbustus sp. nov. from its close relatives: gular region with erect setae, as opposed to absent (T. quercicola sp. nov.) or present but decumbent (T. annexus); head relatively broad (CI 87–88 vs. 80–84 in T. balnearius); a petiole with a distinct posterior face in lateral view, which is about two thirds as long as the dorsal face will separate T. arbustus sp. nov. from T. obtusigaster sp. nov., which has a very short posterior face of the petiole; the first gastral tergite of T. arbustus sp. nov. is not sculptured, as opposed to T. obtusigaster sp. nov., which has an areolate first gastral tergite.\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 2): SL = 0.683–0.701 (0.692); FRS = 0.306–0.310 (0.308); CW = 0.928–0.969 (0.949); CWb = 0.848–0.895 (0.872); PoOC = 0.394–0.407 (0.401); CL = 0.962–1.028 (0.995); EL = 0.240–0.263 (0.252); EW = 0.196–0.212 (0.204); MD = 0.225–0.227 (0.226); WL = 1.357–1.445 (1.401); SPST = 0.376–0.380 (0.378); MPST = 0.416–0.439 (0.428); PEL = 0.455–0.477 (0.466); NOL = 0.271–0.279 (0.275); NOH = 0.196–0.209 (0.203); PEH = 0.351–0.376 (0.364); PPL = 0.294–0.335 (0.315); PW = 0.622–0.648 (0.635); SBPA = 0.284–0.300 (0.292); SPTI = 0.334–0.353 (0.344); PEW = 0.238–0.242 (0.240); PNW = 0.198–0.210 (0.204); PPW = 0.373–0.388 (0.381); HFL = 0.798–0.839 (0.819); HFWmax = 0.265–0.269 (0.267); HFWmin = 0.062–0.071 (0.067); CS = 1.329–1.409 (1.369); ES = 0.338–0.369 (0.354); SI = 78–81 (79); OI = 25–26 (26); CI = 87–88 (88); WLI = 160–161 (161); SBI = 33–34 (34); PSI = 26–28 (27); PWI = 154–163 (159); PLI = 136–162 (149); NI = 130–142 (136); PNWI = 83–87 (85); NLI = 58–60 (59); FI = 379–427 (403).\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, slightly longer than broad (CI 87-88). Mandibles densely, finely striate but shining and armed with five teeth: the apical-most well developed and acute, followed by a less developed preapical tooth and three equally developed smaller teeth. Anterior clypeal margin emarginated medially. Antennal scapes short: when fully retracted, failing to reach the posterior margin of the head capsule by about the maximum width of the antennal scape (SI 78–81). Antennae 12-segmented; antennal club of composed of three segments, with the apical-most segment about one and a half times as long as the preceding two in combination. Frontal carinae moderately long, extending past the antennal toruli by about two times the maximum width of the antennal scape. Compound eyes strongly protruding past the lateral margins of the head capsule. Lateral margin of head weakly convex, forming a continuous arc from the mandibular insertions to the posterior margin of the head. Posterior head margin weakly concave medially but rounding evenly into the lateral margins.\n\nIn profile view, compound eyes ovular and moderately large (OI 25–26), with 15 ommatidia in longest row. Pronotal declivity distinct: dorsal margin of anterior face of pronotum marked by a very weak carina; neck and anterior face of pronotum forming a ~120° angle. Mesosoma very weakly sinuate: weakly convex from where it joins the pronotal declivity to the propodeum, the propodeum slightly depressed and weakly concave. Promesonotal suture extending from the posterior margin of the procoxal insertion to the mesothoracic spiracle, which is moderately well developed. Metanotal groove visible as a disruption of the sculpture laterally from where it arises between the mid- and hind coxae to where it ends in the poorly developed metathoracic spiracle, which is nearly indistinguishable against the ground sculpture. Propodeal spiracle moderately well developed, directed posterolaterally, and separated from the propodeal declivity by about five spiracle diameters. Propodeal spines moderately well developed, but short (PSI 26–28), slightly shorter than the propodeal declivity, slightly flared at the base, straight, and blunt. Propodeal declivity weakly concave, forming a rounded ~100° angle with the base of the propodeal spines. Propodeal lobes rounded and weakly developed, but with an angulate dorsal margin. Metapleural gland bulla small, extending from the metacoxal insertion a third of the way to the propodeal spiracle. Petiole short (PLI 136–162), with tubercles anterodorsally. Subpetiolar process in the form of a moderately long, acute, triangular tooth; ventral margin of petiole weakly concave posterior to it. Petiolar peduncle short: comprising about a quarter of the total petiole length. Petiolar node robust, erect, and subquadrate: transition between peduncle and node marked by a rounded angle of ~110°; anterior face forming a ~100° angle with the dorsal face, which is weakly convex, nearly flat; dorsal face meeting the posterior face at a rounded ~90° angle; posterior face forms a ~110° angle with the caudal cylinder. Postpetiole flat anteriorly, bulging slightly anterodorsally before flattening posterodorsally; weakly lobed ventrally.\n\nIn dorsal view, humeri weakly developed: evenly rounded and slightly wider than the rest of the mesosoma; mesothoracic spiracles weakly protruding past the lateral margins of the mesosoma, visible as slight angles where the pronotum meets the mesonotum. Promesonotal suture represented weak sulcus and disruption in the ground sculpture. Metanotal groove represented by a weak sulcus. Propodeal spines broadly approximated basally and weakly diverging apically, their apices separated from each other by slightly more than their length, the negative space between them “U” shaped. Petiolar peduncle with spiracles weakly protruding past the lateral margins. Petiolar node nearly ovular, but posterior margin flattened; node the same width as the peduncle, and evenly grading into the caudal cylinder, which is slightly wider than the node. Postpetiole narrow (PWI 154–163) and subquadrate. Anterior margin of the postpetiole very weakly convex, nearly flat, and meet the lateral margins at a ~90° angle; lateral margins converge parallel to each other; posterior corners rounded; posterior margin flat. Metafemur strongly incrassate (FI 379–427).\n\nSculpture: median clypeal carina present, extending posteriorly to the frontal triangle, and flanked on either side by two slightly weaker carinae. Lateral clypeal lobes with additional, weaker carinae; ground sculpture weakly areolate. Antennal scapes areolate. Cephalic dorsum weakly areolate, with coarse rugae over the ground sculpture; concentric costulae surrounding the antennal insertions; sculpture between the frontal carinae costate. Lateral surfaces of head areolate, with coarse rugae over the ground sculpture. Ventral surface of head smooth and shining anteromedially, but otherwise weakly areolate-costulate. Pronotal neck areolate. Lateral surfaces mesosoma areolate, with costae over the ground sculpture; region between propodeal spiracle and base of propodeal spines areolate. Propodeal declivity areolate. Dorsal surface of mesosoma predominantly areolate, with rugulae that become very weak on the mesonotum. Femora finely, densely areolate. Petiole uniformly areolate; a weak carina present laterally, extending longitudinally from the petiolar spiracle to the caudal cylinder; areolate-rugulose on the dorsal and posterior faces of the node. Postpetiole uniformly areolate, with rugulose sculpture on the lateral faces. First gastral tergite and sternite smooth and shining, without spectral iridescence.\n\nSetae: antennal scapes and funiculi with short, adpressed pilosity. Dorsum of the head, pronotum, waist segments, and gaster with moderately abundant, erect, blunt-tipped setae, the longest of which are about the width of the compound eye. The head bears ~38, mesosoma ~28, petiole 6, postpetiole ~18, and first gastral tergite ~90 setae. Short, sparse pubescence present over the entire body, but difficult to detect against the densely sculptured integument.\n\nColor: predominantly dark brown, with antennae, mandibles, pronotal neck, legs (excluding femora), basal third of gastral sclerites (excluding the first gastral sclerites), and sting testaceous brown.\n\nGyne: Unknown.\n\nMale: Unknown.\n\nEtymology: Behavioural, from the Spanish ‘arbusta’ (= shrub), in reference to the dry forest and nesting site in which this species was collected.\n\nComments: Known only from the type specimens, which were extracted from a nest in a small hollow branch of Bursera in the subtropical dry forests of Baja California Sur by Bob Johnson. Like other members of the annexus group, this species most likely nests exclusively in dead plant material on live plants. Temnothorax arbustus sp. nov. was mistakenly reported as T. sp. nr. peninsularis in Prebus (2017). Temnothorax peninsularis (Wheeler) is a member of the distantly related sallei clade, which is morphologically convergent with members of the salvini clade (Prebus, in prep.). Temnothorax peninsularis was described from a dealate gyne but differs from other gynes in the annexus group by the absence a medial depression or notch in the anterior margin of the clypeus (Mackay, 2000; Wheeler, 1934, see CASENT0922107 on antweb.org).\n\nTemnothorax balnearius sp. nov.\n\nDistribution: ; worker & gyne: .\n\nType material examined: Holotype worker: MEXICO: Baja California Sur: El Charro, 30 October 1969, E. L. Sleeper, ex dead Agave stalk (LACMENT323199, top specimen on pin) [LACM].\n\nParatype workers and gyne: same pin as holotype, 1 worker (middle specimen on pin) 1 dealate gyne (bottom specimen on pin); same data as holotype, 3 workers (LACMENT323198) [LACM] 3 workers (CASENT0758290) [LACM].\n\nGeographic range: Low elevations of Baja California Sur ( ).\n\nWorker diagnosis: Temnothorax balnearius sp. nov. can be separated from other species in the salvini clade by the following character combination: head narrow (CI 80–84); erect setae present on gula; metanotal groove absent; propodeum not depressed; propodeum bearing setae; propodeal spines moderately short, slightly shorter than the propodeal declivity (PSI 24–27); hind femora strongly incrassate (FI 357–452); petiole with short peduncle: peduncle comprising about a quarter of the total length of the petiole; petiolar node erect and subquadrate, not overhanging the caudal cylinder in profile view; postpetiole narrow (PWI 153–180); first gastral tergite smooth and shining; integument medium brown; dorsum of head, mesosoma, waist segments and gaster with erect, short, blunt-tipped setae; legs without erect setae.\n\nSimilar species: Temnothorax anaphalantus Snelling et al., T. andrei, T. caguatan, T. carinatus, T. cokendolpheri, T. nitens, T. pilicornis sp. nov., T. pseudandrei Snelling et al., T. rugosus, T. subditivus, T. tenuisculptus, T. wardi, species of the silvestrii group, and other members of the annexus group. Temnothorax balnearius sp. nov. can be separated from all of the above species, except for T. anaphalantus, T. rugosus, T. wardi, and other members of the annexus group by the medially emarginate anterior clypeal margin. Furthermore, it can be distinguished from T. caguatan by the 12-segmented antennae, which are 11-segmented in the latter. The erect, subquadrate petiolar node of T. balnearius sp. nov. contrasts with the node of T. subditivus, which is squamiform, and the nodes of T. nitens, T. rugosus and T. wardi, which are cuneiform to subcuneiform. The dorsal margin of the mesosoma is continuous in T. balnearius sp. nov., as opposed to sinuate, with a depressed propodeum in T. tenuisculptus. The narrow postpetiole contrasts with the very broad postpetiole of T. pilicornis sp. nov. and T. wardi (PWI 153–180 vs. > 180). The massively incrassate hind femora will separate T. balnearius sp. nov. from all species listed above (except for T. subditivus, T. tenuisculptus, T. rugosus, and the annexus group), which have less incrassate hind femora (FI 357–452 in T. balnearius sp. nov. vs. < 300). Within the annexus group, the following characters distinguish T. balnearius sp. nov. from its close relatives: gular region with erect setae, as opposed to absent (T. quercicola sp. nov.) or present but decumbent (T. annexus); head relatively narrow (CI 80–84 vs. > 85 in T. arbustus sp. nov. and T. obtusigaster sp. nov.).\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 8): SL = 0.625–0.699 (0.668); FRS = 0.241–0.293 (0.269); CW = 0.802–0.897 (0.855); CWb = 0.713–0.807 (0.769); PoOC = 0.334–0.400 (0.363); CL = 0.860–0.996 (0.928); EL = 0.194–0.229 (0.215); EW = 0.149–0.181 (0.166); MD = 0.208–0.246 (0.229); WL = 1.120–1.312 (1.219); SPST = 0.287–0.343 (0.315); MPST = 0.331–0.416 (0.382); PEL = 0.354–0.459 (0.407); NOL = 0.182–0.261 (0.234); NOH = 0.150–0.184 (0.167); PEH = 0.279–0.337 (0.308); PPL = 0.201–0.262 (0.239); PW = 0.508–0.599 (0.550); SBPA = 0.205–0.272 (0.241); SPTI = 0.256–0.316 (0.290); PEW = 0.188–0.226 (0.208); PNW = 0.181–0.244 (0.214); PPW = 0.299–0.380 (0.344); HFL = 0.708–0.805 (0.761); HFWmax = 0.223–0.257 (0.245); HFWmin = 0.054–0.072 (0.063); CS = 1.151–1.296 (1.233); ES = 0.275–0.320 (0.298); SI = 84–91 (87); OI = 23–25 (24); CI = 80–84 (83); WLI = 156–164 (158); SBI = 29–34 (31); PSI = 24–27 (26); PWI = 153–180 (166); PLI = 158–178 (171); NI = 121–154 (140); PNWI = 93–108 (103); NLI = 51–63 (57); FI = 357–452 (393).\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, longer than broad (CI 80–84).

Johnson #BCS 197, 6 m high 3 cm dead branch Quercus oblongifolia (CASENT0758654, bottom specimen on pin) [CASC].\n\nParatype workers and gyne: same pin as holotype, 1 worker (CASENT0758654, top specimen on pin) [CASC]; same data as holotype, 1 dealate gyne, 2 workers (CASENT0869104) [CASC] 2 workers (CASENT0104939) [UCDC] 3 workers (MCZENT00561743) [MCZC] 3 workers (CASENT0758322) [MCZC]\n\nNon-type material examined: same data as holotype, 100 workers (CASENT0869070-CASENT0869103) [RAJC]. MEXICO: Baja California Sur: 27 km SW Loreto, 9 November 1969, E.M. Fisher & E.L. Sleeper, 1 worker (LACMENT323251) [LACM] 1 worker (LACMENT323250) [LACM].\n\nGeographic range: Low to mid elevations of Baja California Sur ( ).\n\nWorker diagnosis: Temnothorax obtusigaster sp. nov. can be separated from other species in the salvini clade by the following character combination: head relatively broad (CI 86–90); erect setae present on gula; metanotal groove absent; propodeum not depressed; propodeum bearing setae; propodeal spines short, slightly shorter than the propodeal declivity (PSI 28–29); hind femora strongly incrassate (FI 333–406); petiole with short peduncle: peduncle comprising about a third of the total length of the petiole; petiolar node erect and subquadrate, not overhanging the caudal cylinder in profile view; posterior margin of petiolar node indistinct in profile view, much shorter than the dorsal margin; postpetiole narrow (PWI 160–173); first gastral tergite areolate; integument yellow; dorsum of head, mesosoma, waist segments and gaster with erect, short, blunt-tipped setae; legs without erect setae.\n\nSimilar species: Temnothorax anaphalantus, T. andrei, T. caguatan, T. carinatus, T. cokendolpheri, T. nitens, T. pilicornis sp. nov., T. pseudandrei, , T. rugosus, T. subditivus, T. tenuisculptus T. wardi, species of the silvestrii group, other members of the annexus group. Temnothorax obtusigaster sp. nov. can be separated from all of the above species, except for T. anaphalantus, T. rugosus, T. wardi and other members of the annexus group, by the medially emarginate anterior clypeal margin. Furthermore, it can be distinguished from T. caguatan by the 12-segmented antennae, which are 11-segmented in the latter. The erect, subquadrate petiolar node of T. obtusigaster sp. nov. contrasts with the node of T. subditivus, which is squamiform, and the nodes of T. rugosus and T. wardi, which are cuneiform to subcuneiform. The dorsal margin of the mesosoma is continuous in T. obtusigaster sp. nov. (as opposed to sinuate with a depressed propodeum in T. tenuisculptus). The narrow postpetiole contrasts with the very broad postpetiole of T. pilicornis sp. nov. and T. wardi (PWI 160–173 vs. > 180). The massively incrassate hind femora will separate T. obtusigaster sp. nov. from all species listed above (except for T. subditivus, T. tenuisculptus, T. rugosus, and the annexus group), which have less incrassate hind femora (FI 333–406 in T. obtusigaster sp. nov. vs. < 300). Within the annexus group, the following characters distinguish T. obtusigaster sp. nov. from its close relatives: gular region with erect setae, as opposed to absent (T. quercicola sp. nov.) or present but decumbent (T. annexus); head relatively broad (CI 86–90 vs. 80–84 in T. balnearius sp. nov.); a petiole with an indistinct posterior face in lateral view (much shorter than the dorsal face) will separate T. obtusigaster sp. nov. from T. arbustus sp. nov., which has a relatively long posterior face of the petiole; the first gastral tergite of T. obtusigaster sp. nov. is areolate, as opposed to smooth in T. arbustus sp. nov.\n\nWorker measurements & indices (n = 5): SL = 0.743–0.767 (0.753); FRS = 0.302–0.332 (0.322); CW = 0.950–1.026 (0.990); CWb = 0.863–0.923 (0.898); PoOC = 0.354–0.375 (0.364); CL = 0.991–1.051 (1.024); EL = 0.258–0.300 (0.275); EW = 0.177–0.223 (0.199); MD = 0.233–0.278 (0.256); WL = 1.364–1.433 (1.396); SPST = 0.389–0.410 (0.399); MPST = 0.412–0.457 (0.433); PEL = 0.511–0.526 (0.516); NOL = 0.279–0.314 (0.300); NOH = 0.169–0.205 (0.191); PEH = 0.337–0.390 (0.369); PPL = 0.264–0.313 (0.293); PW = 0.625–0.688 (0.658); SBPA = 0.260–0.310 (0.284); SPTI = 0.322–0.417 (0.375); PEW = 0.237–0.264 (0.249); PNW = 0.250–0.292 (0.276); PPW = 0.407–0.440 (0.417); HFL = 0.840–0.877 (0.858); HFWmax = 0.266–0.293 (0.281); HFWmin = 0.070–0.081 (0.077); CS = 1.359–1.442 (1.41); ES = 0.347–0.405 (0.375); SI = 81–87 (84); OI = 25–28 (27); CI = 86–90 (88); WLI = 150–158 (156); SBI = 30–34 (32); PSI = 28–29 (29); PWI = 160–173 (167); PLI = 164–195 (177); NI = 151–168 (157); PNWI = 105–117 (111); NLI = 54–61 (58); FI = 333–406 (367).\n\nWorker description: In full-face view, head subquadrate, longer than broad (CI 86–90). Mandibles densely, finely striate but shining and armed with five teeth: the apical-most well developed and acute, followed by a less developed preapical tooth and three equally developed smaller teeth. Anterior clypeal margin emarginated medially. Antennal scapes moderately long: when fully retracted, just reaching the posterior margin of the head (SI 81–87). Antennae 12-segmented; antennal club of composed of three segments, with the apical-most segment about one and a half times as long as the preceding two in combination. Frontal carinae short, extending past the antennal toruli by about one and a half times the maximum width of the antennal scape. Compound eyes strongly protruding past the lateral margins of the head capsule. Lateral margin of head weakly convex, forming a continuous arc from the mandibular insertions to the posterior margin of the head. Posterior head margin weakly concave medially but rounding ev"
