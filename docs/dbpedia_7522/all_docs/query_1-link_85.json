        "text": "ITALY'S Matteo Salvini has hailed the birth of a \"new Europe\" amid a Europsceptic surge in the EU elections.\n\nHuge voter turnout to elect MEPs to the European Parliament helped secure victories for parties led by the likes of populist Salvini and France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen.\n\nHowever, updated provisional results from the European Parliament elections confirm that mainstream political parties will retain power in the assembly.\n\nThis is despite losing significant seats to the far-right and to the Greens as results from elections in 28 countries have trickled in today.\n\nFresh results as of midday on Monday showed the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) would remain the biggest group, with 182 seats - down from 217 in the last polls in 2014.\n\nThe centre-left Socialists and Democrats would secure 147 seats, a drop of 40 seats from five years ago.\n\nThe two parties have dominated the parliament with a combined majority since elections were first held in 1979.\n\nMeanwhile, the Greens are likely to make significant gains, with 69 seats - up from 52 - as will the pro-business ALDE group with 109 seats, compared with 68 last time.\n\nThe Europe of Nations and Freedom group, uniting the French far-right and Italian populists, looks set to secure 58 seats, up from 37 in 2014.\n\nThe results show a revamped political landscape where far-right, pro-business groups and environmentalists will be forces to be reckoned with.\n\nSALVINI MESSAGE: JOIN US\n\nSalvini, Italy's hard-line interior minister, said at his League party headquarters in Milan early today: \"A new Europe is born. The rules are changing in Europe.\"\n\nVoter projections showed the League won 33 per cent of the vote, a massive leap from just six per cent at the last European vote in 2014.\n\nSoaring support bolsters his role as the flagbearer of the nationalist and far-right forces in Europe, and could also \"shake up politics at home\".\n\nSalvini told reporters in Milan that he is counting on Britain's new Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, and Hungarian leader Viktor Orban's Fidesz to leave their current groups and join the Europe of Nations and Freedom group that includes far-right parties in France and Germany.\n\nHe also hopes to expand the group to at least 100 members, with an ambition to make it as many as 150, by also bringing in parties from the Czech Republic, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Spain, \"if everyone can overcome jealousies, sympathies and antipathies.\"\n\nA new Europe is born. The rules are changing in Europe.\n\nMatteo Salvini, Italy's interior minister\n\nThe latest figures show Le Pen's National Rally party neck and neck with pro-EU President Emmanuel Macron's En Marche, with both on 23 seats.\n\nBut the French far right is set to gain an additional seat when Britain leaves the EU and the Parliament reapportions its seats.\n\nLe Pen's party had 5.3 million votes overall, compared to 5.1 million for Macron's party, according to results from the Interior Ministry.\n\nAfter the exit polls, Le Pen said her rival should dissolve the French National Assembly, adding: \"The trust that the French people have given to us by choosing us as the first party, but above all as the future alternative power, is an immense honour.\"\n\nFrance's Green party will have 13 seats after placing a surprisingly strong third, followed by eight seats for the conservative Republicans and six seats each for the far-left Defiant France and the Socialist group.\n\nThe free-market liberals saw their stake in the 751-seat parliament rise to 107 seats, from 68 in 2014.\n\nIn the UK, a triumphant Nigel Farage said his Brexit Party plans to \"change the shape of British politics\" after storming to victory in the European elections.\n\nAlthough the party only formed after Britain failed to leave the EU on its planned exit date in March, it's won 28 of the 73 British EU seats up for grabs and almost a third of the votes in results announced early Monday.\n\nMore results are expected later in the day.\n\nFarage said: \"We're not just here to leave the European Union but to try and fundamentally change the shape of British politics, bring it into the 21st century and get a Parliament that better reflects the country.\"\n\n\"CHANGING SHAPE OF BRITISH POLITICS\"\n\nThe Brexit Party received nearly as many votes as the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party combined.\n\nThe Conservatives were the main casualties of the Brexit Party's advance, securing just nine per cent of the vote in England and Wales, and they are set for their worst ever national election share once the full picture from Scotland becomes clear.\n\nLabour also suffered a terrible night as voters split between the clear Brexit alternatives offered by Farage and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats.\n\nJust three Conservatives were elected in England and Wales, while the Brexit Party had 28 seats, overtaking the 24 MEPs that Mr Farage's former party Ukip sent to the European Parliament in 2014.\n\nThe Lib Dems, reduced to just a single MEP in 2014, were on 15 after their best ever European results.\n\nThe result in Scotland will not be formally declared until later on Monday but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her SNP had won \"emphatically\" and would take three of the six available seats.\n\nIt'll be a fractured assembly for the next five years as many voters turned their backs on the centre-right European People's Party.\n\nBoth German Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right Union bloc and her junior partner, the Social Democrats, have met for internal talks today.\n\nHer party won 28.9 per cent of the vote and the Social Democrats got 15.8 per cent, down from 35.4 per cent and 27.3 per cent, respectively, five years ago.\n\nGermany's Greens surged to second place on Sunday amid increasing concern about climate change.\n\nArmin Laschet, a member of the Union bloc, called the results \"a wake-up call for politics\".\n\nMore than 50 per cent of the EU's more than 400 million voters have turned out to have their say over four days in the world's biggest transnational elections.\n\nFormer White House strategist Steve Bannon said that European integration was \"dead in its tracks\" after election wins by nationalist and populist parties in Italy, France and Britain.\n\nBannon told The Associated Press the results showed Europe's centre was imploding and that traditional right-left politics were being replaced by a battle between \"nationalist versus globalist\" forces.\n\nEUROSCEPTIC \"SUPERGROUP\"\n\nHe said \"people are taking their countries back ... it's just the beginning. It's going to get more and more powerful over time.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether the diverse nationalist, populist and far-right parties across Europe will be able to form a united bloc in the European Parliament. And even if they do, they will be far short of a majority.\n\nBannon predicted a \"supergroup\" of eurosceptic parties would block any attempts to deepen integration among EU member states.\n\nBut Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesperson for the European Commission, said the results would provide a pro-EU majority, with a “constructive and engaged” house.\n\n“Contrary” to “doomsday”-like forecasts, “it is the pro-EU political forces across the political spectrum that won the day.\n\n“Those who won the elections are the ones who want to work in and for Europe – not those who want to destroy Europe.”\n\nWhile real power in Europe remains in the hands of the 28 member states, the assembly's influence has grown.\n\nIt's helped improve air flight safety in Europe, cut down on plastics use, end mobile telephone roaming charges inside the bloc, boost data privacy, and cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars.\n\nThe parliament also has an important say in international treaties ranging from trade talks to Brexit.\n\nBut now new, uncomfortable alliances must be forged."
