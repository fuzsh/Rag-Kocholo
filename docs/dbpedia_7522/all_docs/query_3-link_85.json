The effective head of the government in Rome is not the titular premier, Giuseppe Conte, nor the winner of the last election, the Five Star Movement (M5S) leader Luigi Di Maio. It is the interior minister, Matteo Salvini.

In Italy, Salvini has led a revolt of the next-to-last; as their leader he has learned to talk, with great skill, to their hearts and souls.\n\nThe Northern League was founded in 1991, on the eve of the implosion of the mass parties — the Christian Democrats, Communists and Socialists — that had dominated Italy since the second world war.

Its first electoral successes marked a change in Italian politics. Its goal was specific: independence for Padania, an imaginary nation centred on the River Po. Its message was that the north, an industrious and prosperous (...)"
