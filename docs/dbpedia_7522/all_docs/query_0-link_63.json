        "text": "The 1930s was a period of spectacular progress in aircraft performance and led to the introduction of long-distance flights. Several pilots set records while wearing an Oyster. Others used a Rolex watch as an on-board chronometer, such as Owen Cathcart-Jones and Ken Waller, who, in 1934, made a return voyage from London (United Kingdom) to Melbourne (Australia) in record time with a twin-engine De Havilland Comet.\n\nUnique aesthetics\n\nThe Air-King sports a distinctive black dial with a combination of large 3, 6 and 9 numerals marking the hours and a prominent minutes scale for optimal navigational time readings. Rolex’s symbolic crown is displayed in yellow on the dial, while the seconds hand and the name “Rolex” are green, echoing the brand’s emblematic colour. Since the watch was launched in 1958, the inscription “Air-King” has featured in lettering that makes the model easily identifiable.\n\nThe Air-King offers great legibility in all circumstances, even in the dark, thanks to its Chromalight display: the 3, 6 and 9 numerals, triangle hour marker at 12 o’clock and hands are filled or coated with a luminescent material emitting a long-lasting blue glow.\n\nReliability and performance\n\nA paragon of robustness and reliability, the Air-King’s 40-mm Oyster case is guaranteed waterproof to a depth of 100 metres (330 feet). The middle case is crafted from a solid block of Oystersteel, a particularly corrosion-resistant alloy.\n\nThe Air-King is fitted on a three-piece link Oyster bracelet in Oystersteel. This bracelet is equipped with an Oysterlock safety clasp, designed by Rolex and patented, which prevents accidental opening. It is also fitted with the Easylink comfort extension link, which allows the wearer to adjust the bracelet length easily, by approximately 5 mm.\n\nSuperlative Chronometer certification\n\nLike all Rolex watches, the Air-King is covered by the Superlative Chronometer certification. This designation testifies that every watch leaving the brand’s workshops has successfully undergone a series of tests conducted by Rolex in its own laboratories, according to its own criteria. The Superlative Chronometer status is symbolized by the green seal that comes with every Rolex watch and is coupled with an international five-year guarantee."
