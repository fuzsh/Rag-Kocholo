I am thinking about adding one of his 4-4.5'' male salvini cichlids to the order. Do salvini males get any red coloration to them? I love the look of females but never kept a male only females. If you could post pictures of your salvini males that would be great.\n\nStephen St.Clair\n\nPotamotrygon\n\nJul 2, 2017\n\n1,324\n\n2,261\n\n164\n\n#2\n\nThis pic is of the best pair of Salvinis I've kept.

I've also read rio candelaria males display a lot of red as well, but so far my grow out males are displaying more of the blue spangling and less red."
