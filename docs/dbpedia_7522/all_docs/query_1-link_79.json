        "text": "Italy’s political situation is a bit of a mess at the moment to say the very least. They haven’t had a government since March.\n\nAnd their latest attempt at a government has collapsed after just four days, forcing the new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to quit.\n\nOne man at the epicentre of the crisis is the popular right-wing politician Matteo Salvini, a major critic of the EU and immigration, but a big fan of Donald Trump.\n\nHe has served as Federal Secretary of the political party Lega Nord (Italy’s more popular version of UKIP) since December 2013, and is now struggling to form a government correctly with various rival parties.\n\nAs of March this year he became a Senator in the Italian Senate too. Here is what we know about him.\n\nMatteo Salvini, known as The Captain to his supporters, is 45 years old and was born in Milan. From 1993 onwards, he was a Councillor in Milan for almost two decades.\n\nHe’s been married to Fabrizia Ieluzzi since 2003 and they have a son, Federico, and daughter, Mirta.\n\nIn terms of his political career, he was first a member of the Young Padanians Movement, Lega Nord’s youth faction, then in 2004 was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Italy’s North-West region and participated in the European Parliament as a part of the Non-Inscrits.\n\nTaking a dislike to the EU altogether, he stood down from the European Parliament in November 2006 and switched to become a member of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group in 2009 before switching back to the Non-Inscrits in 2014.\n\nIn June 2015, he was part of the creation of a new group, the Europe of Nations and Freedom, involving parties like the French National Front (led by Jean-Marie Le Pen) and the Dutch Party for Freedom. Salvini is the vice-president of the Italian delegation.\n\nAlso in 2015, he led a protest in Rome against illegal immigration, and Lega Nord’s popularity soared across the regions subsequently.\n\nBut the European immigration crisis isn’t the only thing that’s riled Salvini as he has called the euro a ‘crime against humanity’, and has opposed same-sex marriage.\n\nIn December 2017, Salvini unveiled a new logo for the party without ‘north’ in the title, hoping to appeal to more voters and seize more power.\n\nThen, lo and behold, they did well in the 2018 election, winning 17.4 per cent of the vote, making them the third largest party in Italy.\n\nWhile a hung parliament was declared, Salvini became the de facto leader of the five Centre-right coalition parties and was involved in forming a government.\n\nBut Matteo said he would refuse to compromise when working with Luigi Di Maio, the leader of another successful party, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S).\n\nWhile trying to sort this out, Matteo also found time to declare that he would not choose a finance minister that the EU liked.\n\nSubsequently, Salvini’s choice of minister, 81-year-old Eurosceptic Paulo Savano, was rejected by Italian President Sergio Mattarella who fears that an exit from the EU would damage Italy irreperably.\n\nNow Mattarella has said he is considering calling another Italian election to sort this chaotic situation out.\n\nItaly in crisis as Prime Minister is forced to quit after just four days in power\n\nMORE : Builder bites off pigeon’s head while it’s still alive"
