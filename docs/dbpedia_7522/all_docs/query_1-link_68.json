        "text": "The Salvini Cichlid, also known as the Tricolor Cichlid and the Fire Red Belly Cichlid, is a brightly colored cichlid from the lakes and rivers of southern Mexico and northern Central America, This variety was collected in the Tabasco Region, south Mexico. They have bright yellow bodies with blotchy dark lines running from the eyes to the caudal fin and turquoise-blue dots scattered over the body. The female belly gets bright Red. The fins are long and have a turquoise-blue sheen to them. The bright red coloring is seen in the anal fins and on the body behind the pectoral fin, as well as on the edging of the caudal fin.\n\nThese are aquarium-bred first-generation F1, parents are wild-caught.\n\nSalvini Cichlids require a tank of at least 20 gallons with a fine gravel or sandy bottom. They prefer rocky aquariums, they will dig and move gravel to make a nest and establish territories when they are adults ( 4”-5”). The Salvini Cichlid should be provided with numerous rocks and roots for use as hiding places. Plenty of room should be left for open swimming also. They may be housed with smaller fish that are aggressive or fast swimmers such as large danio, Silver Dollar, and other large cichlids, but be aware, they are territorial and will chase others. They will do well with most cynodonts and plecostomus.\n\nThey prefer alkaline water, ph of 7-8 and temperature of 78-85F. Salvini Cichlid is omnivorous and will eat most prepared foods, frozen and freeze-dried, tubifex worms, shrimp, flake food, and pellets.\n\nApproximate Purchase Size: 3”-4″"
