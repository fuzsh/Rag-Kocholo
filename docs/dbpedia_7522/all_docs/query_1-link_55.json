        "text": "Description\n\nBright Salvini Cichlid, cichlasoma salvini, salvin’s cichlid\n\nThe Salvini Cichlid is native to southern Mexico and Honduras, thus preferring warm temperatures between 72 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit. These fish sport impressive yellow bodies with black and red patterned coloring across the sides and bottom. If you’re raising other fish alongside Salvini Cichlids, these fish are known for their lack of aggression and tend to get along with fish of similar size. Note that this species is omnivorous, and they enjoy having nooks and crannies in the tank to hide among. Colorful from birth and only get better with age.\n\nWe’ve found that using New Life Spectrum Ultra Red fish food will greatly enhance and improve the color on these fish significantly, naturally without hormones.
