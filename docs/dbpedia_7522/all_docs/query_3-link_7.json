        "text": "The ideological gap between Italian Prime Minister and Fratelli d’Italia leader Giorgia Meloni (ECR) and her coalition partner Lega leader Matteo Salvini (ID) continues to widen, notably over their global allegiances and the upcoming US and EU elections.\n\nItaly has been governed by a right-wing coalition composed of Meloni’s right-wing Fratelli d’Italia (ECR), Matteo Salvini’s far-right Lega (ID), and Antonio Tajani’s centre-right Forza Italia (EPP) since 2022.\n\nAlthough Meloni’s relations with Forza Italia seem to be smooth, this is not the case with Lega and its leader, Matteo Salvini.\n\nDespite the centre-right’s victory in the Abruzzo elections on Sunday, Meloni’s candidate and confirmed president, Marco Marsiglio, did not seem to have the necessary support from Lega.\n\nParticularly significant was Salvini’s decision to leave the event in support of the candidate last week in Pescara during Meloni’s closing speech and before the family photo session.\n\nIn late February, Meloni and Salvini clashed over another local election in Sardinia.\n\nSalvini had to give in to Meloni’s pressure in favour of her preferred candidate, mayor of Cagliari Paolo Truzzu, and drop his support for former governor Christian Solinas.\n\nUltimately, Meloni’s choice proved wrong, as Five-Star Movement candidate Alessandra Todde won the elections with the support of centre-left Partito Democratico (S&D).\n\nMeloni: A ‘moderate’, right?\n\nIn an interview with Euractiv Italy, Gianluca Pastori, an associate researcher at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), stressed that the government has been experiencing tensions of various kinds for a long time, which are now “becoming evident” in light of the upcoming elections in Europe and the US.\n\nOn 1 March, Meloni met with US President Joe Biden, and they publicly reaffirmed their mutual support.\n\n“Italy and the United States are strong allies and really close friends. And as you said when we first met here in the Oval, Giorgia, that we have each other’s backs. And we do. And you’ve [Meloni] demonstrated that from the moment you took office”, Biden said after the meeting.\n\nMany in Rome interpreted Meloni’s move as a clear intention to strengthen ties with current administration, while, in contrast, government ally Salvini openly supports Trump’s victory in the November elections.\n\nPastori highlights Meloni’s strategic shift: “Giorgia Meloni has long been trying to accredit her image as leader of the moderate right”.\n\nAccording to the analyst, Meloni’s decision to ally Fratelli d’Italia with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group is in line with this logic and has proved more advantageous than Salvini’s decision to ally his Lega with the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group.\n\nThe expert also observes that “the fact that Meloni places herself close to US ‘mainstream’ republicanism responds to the same logic.”\n\nThis strategic choice appears to be aimed at reassuring those sections of the Italian “moderate” electorate that have played an important role in her success.\n\nOn the other hand, Pastori believes Meloni’s close relationship with Biden meets institutional needs, especially given Italy’s role in the G7 this year.\n\nThe EU elections and von der Leyen\n\nPastori pointed out that while the differences between Meloni and Salvini in the US election are obvious, he does not believe a crisis will arise over this issue alone.\n\nAnother point of contention dividing the right and far-right camps is the attempt by some members of the European People’s Party (EPP) to bring Meloni’s party into Europe’s centre-right ranks.\n\nAt the EPP congress in Bucharest last week, MEP Salvatore De Meo, who comes from centre-right Forza Italia – the third government coalition partner in Italy and member of the EPP– told Euractiv that his party is open to Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia joining them in Europe’s biggest political family.\n\n“[Former Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi thought this, and [current leader] Antonio Tajani has always imagined that the Italian centre-right, everything, even the Lega, could find a way into the EPP”, he added.\n\nSome in the EPP see this development in positive light, suggesting that after the EU elections in June, the EU centre-right will look for “healthy elements” on the right side of the spectrum, such as Meloni.\n\nThanasis Bakolas, the secretary general of the EPP, told Euractiv that this will take time.\n\n“It takes time to politically position oneself and adjust, and we will see who these political elements are and how they position themselves. But, you know, the day after the elections, we need a majority to get the job done regarding the top positions, the Commission and the other institutions. The timing of the two is not necessarily something that’s going to coincide”.\n\nHowever, not everybody in the EPP supports this idea, especially the German centre-right.\n\n“Meloni represents a category herself […] Italy is a founding member of the EU and G7 member. Joining the EPP will also impact the internal political balances of the EU centre-right family, considering that it is projected to get many MEPs, and this should not be disregarded,” an EPP source recently told Euractiv. The source added that this wouldn’t be seen positively by the German right-wing parties, who may see their dominance in the EPP being questioned.\n\nAnother thorny issue is support for Ursula von der Leyen to be re-elected as the president of the European Commission.\n\nMeloni and von der Leyen have not hidden their good relations.\n\nRead more: Meloni, von der Leyen walk tightrope ahead of EU elections\n\nFratelli d’Italia and Forza Italia are expected to back von der Leyen’s second mandate, contrary to Salvini’s Lega, which rejects any support.\n\n(Alessia Peretti, Simone Cantarini | Euractiv.it, Sarantis Michalopoulos | Euractiv.com)\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
