Shortly after PayPal's IPO, the company was acquired by eBay on October 3, 2002,[22] for $1.5 billion.[16][23][24] More than 70 percent of all eBay auctions accepted PayPal payments, and roughly 1 in 4 closed auction listings were transacted via PayPal.[25] PayPal became the default payment method used by the majority of eBay users, and the service competed with eBay's subsidiary Billpoint, as well as Citibank's c2it, Yahoo!'s PayDirect, and Google Checkout.[14]In 2005, PayPal acquired the VeriSign payment solution to provide added security support.[26] In 2007, PayPal announced a partnership with MasterCard, which led to the development and launch of the PayPal Secure Card service, a software that allows customers to make payments on websites that do not accept PayPal directly.[27] By the end of 2007, the company generated $1.8 billion in revenue.[28]In January 2008, PayPal acquired Fraud Sciences, a privately held Israeli start-up that developed online risk tools, for $169 million.[29][30] In November 2008, the company acquired Bill Me Later, an online transactional credit company.[31]

PayPal was originally established by Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek and Max Levchin, in December 1998 as Confinity,[10] a company that developed security software for hand held devices. It had no success with that business model, however, it switched its focus to a digital wallet.[11] The first version of the PayPal electronic payments system was launched in 1999.[12]In March 2000, Confinity merged with x.com, an online financial services company founded in March 1999 by Elon Musk.[13] Musk was optimistic about the future success of the money transfer business Confinity was developing.[14] Musk and Bill Harris, then-president and CEO of X.com, disagreed about the potential future success of the money transfer business and Harris left the company in May 2000.[15] In October of that year, Musk decided that X.com would terminate its other internet banking operations and focus on PayPal.[16] That same month, Elon Musk was replaced by Peter Thiel as CEO of X.com,[17] which was renamed PayPal in 2001 and went public in 2002.[18][19][20] PayPal's IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and generated over $61 million.[21]

The denial of service attacks occurred in December 2010, after PayPal stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks.
