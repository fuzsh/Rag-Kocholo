Too many other options out there that protects the seller as well as the buyer.\n\nNonpayment has been an issue since the day auctions began on eBay.\n\nFalse returns have been an issue since 2008 when eBay introduced the Money Back Guarantee.\n\nSelling on Ebay once was fun and rewarding experience and a good way to good stuff from around the house still in great shape. My last two sales have been difficult / frustrating to say the least.\n\nFirst item the buyer refused to pay. After many attempts to reach out the buyer responded with this \" oh, I guess no one else bid - I no longer want the item\". REALLY? How irresponsible - if you didn't want it - don't bid.\n\nMany complain about non-payers and recommend using BIN/IPR and eBay has in fact deployed a solution, although it is still in test phase, that will require offerors and bidders to provide payment information before offering or bidding. This equates to basically the same as BIN/IPR, or autopay as some are calling it. However, there are potential tradeoffs. You may see increased cancelation requests or in the worse case situation you send it and then the buyer opens an NAD and you are possibly stuck paying for return postage.\n\nSecond item was a set of trail cameras. Buyer claimed they didn't work properly. Both were confirmed in perfect condition before shipping and again after returned. Ebay would not allow me to refuse return even though the listing was stated (no returns).\n\nBe glad it was eBay that handled the claim and the buyer did not open a chargeback with their CC company for NAD. In those cases the seller is probably going to loose, the buyer is going to be fully refunded and the CC company will not require the buyer to return the item. No returns does NOT translate to no refunds.\n\nWhat happened to protecting the seller? I for one will not be using this platform in the future to sell. Too many other options out there that protects the seller as well as the buyer.\n\nHave to semi agree with you on this point. There are things that I will simply not list on eBay due to the risk.\n\nFirst item the buyer refused to pay.\n\nYou are a returning seller, and well... things have changed.\n\nAuctions make up less than 15% of listings and most of those have Buy It Now or Best Offer options that end the auction immediately.\n\nAuctions have a much much higher rate of Unpaid Items.\n\nYou can however set up your Seller Preferences to automatically make an Unpaid Item Cancellation after 96 hours.\n\nEbay would not allow me to refuse return even though the listing was stated (no returns).\n\nThat's always been the case.\n\nNo Returns does not mean and never has meant No Refunds. (At least since Billpoint days, remember those?)\n\nAt best it means the buyer pays for the return if you demand it before refunding.\n\nAt worst it means you refuse to pay for return shipping and eBay makes you refund anyway.\n\nBy the way, are you signed up for Managed Payments?\n\nPaypal can no longer be used to process payments. EBay has moved that back in-house like Billpoint and the early days of Paypal, when eBay owned that.\n\nWithout your SSN and checking account information, eBay can't transfer payments to your bank."
