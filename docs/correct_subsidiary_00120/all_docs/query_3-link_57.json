After this, Kitsap Transit will switch back to the temporary Saturday sailings funded by the Washington State Department, which operate between 10:50 AM to 9:00 PM.\n\nSATURDAYS\n\nBremerton to Seattle (Eastbound)\n\nSeattle to Bremerton (Westbound)\n\nDepart Bremerton Ferry Dock Arrive Pier 50 Seattle Ferry Dock Depart Pier 50 Seattle Ferry Dock Arrive Bremerton Ferry Dock AM 9:20 AM 9:50 AM 10:05 AM 10:35 10:50 11:20 11:30 PM 12:00 PM 12:15 PM 12:45 PM 1:00 1:30 2:00 2:35 2:45 3:15 3:30 4:00 4:10 4:40 5:30 6:00 6:10 6:40 6:50 7:20 7:30 8:00 8:10 8:40 8:50 9:20 9:30 10:00 10:10 10:40 10:50 11:20 11:30 AM 12:00\n\nDeparture times listed on the schedule refer to the time that vessels pull away from the dock. Passengers should arrive a minimum of 10 minutes before scheduled departures. Passengers must be on board 2 minutes prior to departure.\n\nGeneral Policies & Information\n\nAccessibility\n\nKitsap Transit ferries and gangways are wheelchair friendly. Crewmembers will help to ensure a safe and secure ride. The Rich Passage 1 can accommodate up to four mobility devices* on a first-come, first served basis. Passengers can reach the Bremerton Ferry Dock from the bus deck by taking the main elevator down to the boardwalk and following signs to the gangway towards the Foot Ferries. An elevator at the end of the gangway will transport passengers to the ferry dock.\n\nAt Pier 50\n\nFor everyone's safety, passengers using a wheelchair or other mobility devices must be assisted down the ramp by a customer-service representative due to the potentially steep slope.\n\n*Mobility Devices are defined by the ADA as \"a manually-operated or power-driven device designed primarily for use by an individual with a mobility disability for the main purpose of indoor and outdoor locomotion.\" Other power-driven mobility devices (OPDMDs) will NOT be allowed aboard the passenger only Rich Passage 1 to maintain the safety of all passengers and crew members. OPDMDs (i.e, ATVs, Segways, mopeds, scooters, golf carts) infringe upon safe operation due to strict weight limits enacted and enforced by the United States Coast Guard, the high volume of pedestrian traffic, the design and operational characteristics of the vessel (there is no available storage to secure such devices), and the substantial risk posed by combustion-engines containing flammable liquid fuel that is a marine pollutant.\n\nBicycles/Scooters\n\nBicycles are welcome aboard on a first-come first-served basis. Crews will direct passengers on secure placement of their bikes in one of the 12 exterior racks. The current design of the existing bike rack (each with inside openings of 2.25\") makes it impossible to safely secure bikes with fenders, disc brakes, or balloon tires. Bicycles that do not fit safely in the bike rack will not be allowed on the vessel. If you would like to test the bike rack and see if your bicycle fits, you may do so using the bike testing rack located on the Bremerton Dock gangway.\n\nKitsap Transit limits the size and number of electric scooters allowed onboard the Bremerton Fast Ferry. Any electric scooter must measure 43 inches or less in length (folded); any electric scooter larger than 43 inches will not be allowed onboard. A scooter size-testing box is available at the Bremerton dock. Scooters that do not fit in the box will not be allowed onboard.\n\nA maximum of five (5) electric scooters are allowed on each sailing of the Bremerton Fast Ferry. Approved scooters must be stowed beneath the table at the rear of the cabin and oriented in a forward-and-aft direction. Scooters may not be hung on bicycle racks or stowed beneath seats.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the onboard storage area is available on a first-come, first-served basis for mobility devices, strollers, luggage and scooters. If the storage area is full, no additional scooters will be allowed onboard. Riders must keep any electric motorized skateboards, hoverboards or unicycles at their seat and not stow them beneath the table at the rear of the cabin.\n\nChaining your bicycle/scooter to the rail of the vessel is prohibited. Vessel weight restrictions also prohibit heavier bikes/scooters. Shoes with metal sports cleats are not allowed in passenger areas.\n\nService Animals\n\nOnly service animals are allowed in Kitsap Transit buildings, vessels, or buses (the only exception is small animals inside a fully enclosed pet carrier not exceeding 25 pounds). Passengers that are traveling with a service animal are responsible, and may be held liable, for its behavior and actions. Kitsap Transit reserves the right to deny transportation, regardless of certification, if any animal poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others.\n\nComfort animals, emotional support animals, and service animals in training are not service animals and must be in a fully enclosed pet carrier.\n\nPets and comfort/emotional support animals will not be allowed to board in a purse, back pack, reusable grocery bag, etc. Only fully enclosed approved pet carriers are allowed.\n\nFares\n\nOne-way fares are payable with exact cash, Transit GO day passes or ORCA E-purse. Monthly passes can be purchased for round trips. Fares are based on the direction of travel. Passengers can travel to Seattle from Bremerton for the cash fare of $2 and from Seattle to Bremerton for the cash fare of $10. More information on fares can be found on our Kitsap Transit Fares page.\n\nItem Size Limitations\n\nDue to space and weight constraints on our vessels, larger items are not allowed aboard Kitsap Transit vessels. As a rule of thumb, items larger than standard luggage will not be allowed (i.e, kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, bike trailers, large carts/wagons, wheelbarrows, shopping carts, etc.). For a list of other items not allowed on Kitsap Fast Ferries, see the \"Accessibility\" section of this webpage.\n\nFood and Beverages\n\nNo food or beverages are sold aboard the Bremerton Fast Ferry. Passengers are not allowed to eat in the cabin, and beverages must be in closed containers.\n\nLost and Found Bremerton Fast Ferry\n\nItems left aboard the Bremerton vessels will be taken to Kitsap Transit’s Customer Service office after a.m. sailings. Kitsap Transit’s Customer Service Office is located at 10 Washington Avenue inside the Bremerton Transportation Center building. Please call 360.479.2877 before coming to claim your item to make sure we have it.\n\nKitsap Transit is not responsible for lost or stolen items. Any item not claimed after 30 days is donated to charity.\n\nPark & Ride to the Ferry Terminal\n\nKitsap Transit offers free commuter parking at park & ride lots across Kitsap County. Bus service connects park & ride commuters to ferry terminals. Also see Connecting Service above.\n\nLine Cutting or Holding a Spot is Not Permitted\n\nDue to limited seating on the Bremerton Fast Ferry, please respect your fellow passengers who arrive early to secure a spot. Line cutting or holding a spot for another person is not permitted. Please join the line in the order you arrive. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.\n\nRestrooms\n\nThe vessels have two restrooms on board, both of which are ADA compliant. There are also public restrooms along the Bremerton boardwalk for your convenience.\n\nTransfers\n\nOrca E-purse transfers offer free connecting service within two hours of initial travel. If the next connecting service charges a higher fare, you pay only the additional amount.\n\nWaterfront Parking\n\nPaid parking is available in downtown Port Orchard. For details and questions, call the City of Port Orchard at 360.876.4407.\n\nA variety of paid parking options are available in downtown Bremerton. Click here for a detailed list of locations and costs complied by The City of Bremerton.\n\nKitsap Transit offers paid parking at the Annapolis Ferry Dock. The daily parking fee of $5 and monthly parking permits are available for $80 (please call 800.501.7433). Permits do not guarantee a space as spaces are available on a first-come, first-served basis."
