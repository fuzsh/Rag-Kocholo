        "text": "“I got it on eBay.”\n\nThat is the glossary of the new millennium. eBay, the cyber-forum that sells more than 45,000 categories of products – from chocolates to fine antiques – hosts about 254,000 online stores worldwide. It has over 135 millFion registered users and, after Google, is arguably the biggest success story of the Internet era. So how did it get there?\n\nIn eleven dramatic years, eBay has evolved from being a nofrills website trading Pez dispensers to a mega online market for, well, just about everything. eBay is today a $70 billion global electronic souk, one of the earliest survivors of the embryonic Internet era. It has over 9,000 employees and its founder, Pierre Omidyar, is the eighteenth richest man in the United States with a net worth of $10.2 billion.\n\nHow did a small online auction house hit such heights? How did a man who started the site as a hobby became a billionaire?\n\nLegend has it that it all began with Pez. In the summer of 1995, Pierre Omidyar was having dinner at home in Campbell with his then fiancée, Pam Wesley. During a dinner conversation Pam, an avid collector of Pez dispensers, remarked that she was disappointed there were so few people in Silicon Valley to trade with. She told Omidyar how great it would be if there was a way for her to interact with other Pez collectors outside the area and trade with them.\n\nThe conversation ended there but Omidyar, who was just 28 at the time and a computer buff, didn’t forget it. He began writing the code for what would one day become the world’s largest online bazaar. It occurred to Omidyar that the still fledgling Internet could provide the answer to Pam’s problem. Over a long holiday weekend, Omidyar sat down to write the original computer code for what eventually became an Internet superbrand – eBay.\n\nWell, that’s the legend. But it is, Omidyar concedes, the “romantic” version of eBay’s founding. The truth is Omidyar was doing what every other tech person of his time, within a hundred-mile radius of San Jose, was also doing, which was obsessing about the Internet and finding out ways in which it could be put to commercial use. The key question: “What could be that big opportunity I can tap into?” And the answer came to Omidyar in Pam’s need to trade Pez and interact with collectors of everyday things.\n\nOmidyar had always been something of a computer whizkid. Born in Paris he had come to the US at the age of six. Growing up in Washington, DC, he developed an interest in computing, and in 1988 after two years of majoring in computer science at Massachusetts’ Tufts University he joined Claris, an Apple subsidiary\n\nIn 1991 Omidyar teamed up with friends to found a startup called Ink Development Corporation. Ink Development was producing software for pen-based computers. The thinking was that users would eventually abandon their keyboards and use instead a stylus for writing, an approach Palm would popularize years later. “It was going to be great; it was going to bring computers down to the rest of us,” says Omidyar. “Of course, the market didn’t think so.”\n\nSoon Omidyar and his partners realized that this pen-based computing was not about to take off anytime soon and instead put together some software tools for online commerce. The company relaunched an electronic retailing company, eShop. In 1994, Omidyar left eShop as he wished for a job that would let him “do Internet things”, as well as put him in more direct contact with people. Omidyar did, however, retain a sizable equity stake in the company and two years later, when Microsoft bought out eShop, the stock he received made him a millionaire.\n\nOmidyar’s next job was with the developer-relations department at General Magic. Here Omidyar developed contacts with customers as his job was to help third-party software developers-programmers outside the company to write software that worked with General Magic’s Magic Cap platform.\n\nBy 1995 the Internet was fast gaining critical mass. Dial-up service providers like AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy were bringing millions of Americans online. As an early Internet enthusiast, Omidyar realized the immense potential of the still-fledging technology. Keeping in mind Pam’s dilemma, Omidyar toyed with the idea of using the Internet as an auction site to create a more equitable and efficient market. A market where everyone would have access to similar information and would be able to meet other users with similar interests.\n\nOmidyar himself had never attended an auction, and knew little about how auctions worked. He just thought of them as “interesting market mechanisms” that would produce a fair price for items. The questions he was trying to answer were: “What do users really need?” and “What is the best way I can make it easily accessible to them?”\n\nOmidyar remarks: “Instead of posting a classified ad saying I have this object for sale, give me a hundred dollars, you post it and say here’s a minimum price. If there’s more than one person interested, let them fight it out. When the fighting was done, the seller would by definition get the market price for the item, whatever that might be on a particular day.”\n\nOmidyar decided to make the program for a perfect marketplace his project for the long Labor Day weekend of 1995. On Friday afternoon Omidyar holed up in his home office, converting an extra bedroom on the second floor of his modest town house, and began writing code. Using his $30-a-month home Internet service, he had, by the end of the Labour day break, created an auction website.\n\nThe site was not especially glamorous to look at. It had blueblack text against a dingy grey background. Omidyar created a few basic categories: computer hardware and software, consumer electronics, antiques and collectibles, books and comics, automotive, and miscellaneous. At that time the site let users do only three things: list items, view items, and place bids. The name Omidyar chose was as utilitarian as the site itself – AuctionWeb.\n\nSince Auction Web was only a hobby, he intended to offer its services for free. He therefore needed to keep overheads minimal. So rather than creating a new website, Omidyar added AuctionWeb to the site he was already operating. That spring, Omidyar had formed a sole proprietorship firm for his web consulting and freelance technology work, naming it Echo Bay Technology Group. When Omidyar later tried to register EchoBay.com, he found the name already taken. So he shortened it to eBay.com.\n\neBay was officially launched on Labor Day, Monday, September 4, 1995. Omidyar advertised on free listing forums online. Within a week, the for-sale list had grown from eighteen to thirty items, a 66 per cent increase in just seven days. By the end of 1995, AuctionWeb had hosted thousands of auctions, attracting more than ten thousand individual bids.\n\nIn February 1996, Omidyar’s internet provider, Best, began charging Omidyar $250 a month, the rate for a commercial account, ignoring his protests that AuctionWeb was not a business. At the time he was not sure where the capital to cover the additional expenses would be acquired. So to cover his increasing Internet service provider costs, Omidyar started charging a small fee, “basically out of necessity,” he says. Having done no market research, he decided he would not charge buyers at all, and that he would not charge sellers to list items. He believed it would be fair to charge what he called final-value fees, or a percentage of the final sale price. The fees, he decided arbitrarily, would be 5 percent of the sale price for items below $25, and 2.5 percent for items above $25.\n\nNot sure whether it was the right strategy for the fledgling site, Omidyar waited impatiently. Soon cash and checks started arriving at his front door, some containing no more than dimes and nickles. But Omidyar soon found that in the first month he grossed $1,000, and the revenues kept doubling monthly. eBay was one of the very few Internet companies that was profitable from its first month of operation.\n\nSETTING THE CODE\n\nAt that time Internet users were still not confidant about the efficacy or security of e-commerce. If AuctionWeb was to have any chance of success, establishing user trust and confidence was essential. Though Omidyar had set out ethical guidelines for the AuctionWeb community to follow, the harmony he hoped for did not always prevail. He soon realized he had to come up with some sort of a mechanism to enforcing good behavior as, unlike most companies, AuctionWeb was not able to control the quality of its service. It depended on its users for good behavior and Omidyar soon discovered that he had no control over that.\n\nOmidyar decided to depend on the users’ thinking process in relation to emotions and ethics. He wrote on eBay’s website: “People are generally good, treat other people on the site the way you would want to be treated, and when disputes arise, give the other person the benefit of the doubt.”\n\nSo in 1996, Omidyar announced the Feedback Forum. Through it user complaints would be brought out into the open and the entire community would know about the complaints and have an opportunity to deal with them. The rules for it were straightforward. Users were allowed to give each other a rating of plus one, minus one, or neutral, and to include a written explanation if they wished. Through the numbers that appeared after users names, the AuctionWeb community’s opinion of them would follow them wherever they went. If a user’s Feedback Forum ratings got too low (negative four or less) they would be banned from the site. Omidyar arrived wholly arbitrarily at the cut-off point of negative four, which even years later today remains the number that causes eBay to “NARU” someone to make him or her Not-A-Registered User.\n\nKeeping in mind Pam’s dismay at not being able to interact with other Pez collectors, Omidyar introduced the Bulletin Board. As Omidyar did not have time to explain to each individual user how to write a listing or to give advice on bidding strategy, the Bulletin Board was a place for people to gather, share information, and ask for help. It was basically formed so that users could communicate with each other. Throughout eBay’s early days, user need drove the site’s evolution.\n\nOmidyar soon did not have time to keep up with the growing work of AuctionWeb, so he got Chris Agarpao, the brother-in-law of a close friend, to start coming to his house twice a week to open the remittance envelopes and deposit the money. In June 1996, when revenues doubled for the fourth consecutive month, topping $10,000, Omidyar knew he had a real business on his hands and needed to make a critical decision. It was a major risk, but he considered that it was relatively more important to focus on the still fledging AuctionWeb. He decided to quit his day job.\n\nOmidyar knew that if AuctionWeb was going to keep growing, he would need a proper business strategy and the people who were incorporated into his core team should be able to jell. He immediately thought of Jeff Skoll, a Stanford MBA, Omidyar had met two years earlier through friends. In February 1996, Skoll agreed to do consulting work for AuctionWeb and by August, the site was so successful that Skoll quit his job and signed on full-time.\n\nIn Skoll, Omidyar had found the perfect balance. Omidyar says: “I tended to think more intuitively, and he could say, ‘Okay, let’s see how we can actually get that done.’” Skoll was the hard-driving one, the one focused on business development and fending off the competition.” Like all visionary entrepreneurs, Omidyar recognized his limitations. World-class scale needs systems and experienced managers are mandatory to balance the innovatorentrepreneur’s passion. Steve Ballmer has performed the role at Microsoft, Eric Schmidt at Google, providing grounding, direction and perspective.\n\nWith Omidyar and Skoll in the driving seat, AuctionWeb was ready to fly. When Skoll joined, AuctionWeb was still operating out of Omidyar’s home. They decided it was time to move out. While they looked for offices, Omidyar and Skoll moved AuctionWeb’s headquarters from Omidyar’s home to Skoll’s, which he shared with a few of his business school classmates. One of Skoll’s housemates worked at the NASA Ames Technology Center. He helped AuctionWeb get temporary offices there, a one-room space.\n\nOmidyar and Skoll finally shifted AuctionWeb to a dentist’s officesized suite on the second floor of 2005 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, CA.\n\nSkoll’s second priority, after office space, was professionalizing the AuctionWeb site which he considered the flagship. The site still contained the San Francisco Tufts Alliance, the biotech start-up, and Ebola Virus Information. Skoll thought all these to be distracting. He and Omidyar argued about removing the pages, and finally Skoll was able to remove everything but AuctionWeb from the eBay site.\n\nTwo people who became common users in the early days of eBay were Aunt Patti and Uncle Griff. Both went on to become part-time employees of AuctionWeb. As Aunt Patti and Uncle Griff they answered questions on the Bulletin Board and as Dale@eBay.com and Louise@eBay.com they answered customer support e-mails.\n\nIn September 1997, Omidyar and Skoll realized that it was time to change and renamed their auction service eBay. They launched a second generation of the service with a substantially redesigned user interface and a new robust, scalable transaction processing architecture. The company’s total headcount grew from six employees in 1996 to 41 by end-1997 and to 131 by September 1998.\n\nOmidyar soon attracted the attention of Benchmark Capital, a major venture capital firm. It made an initial investment of $6.5 million in eBay. Just before eBay went public, Omidyar resigned as CEO and former Hasbro executive Meg Whitman stepped in.\n\nOn September 24, 1998, eBay went to market. Shares were initially offered at $18, rose to $47 the same day and raised more than $60 million. Potential investors were attracted by the fact that eBay would not have any money invested in inventory, as items that were auctioned on the site remained the property of the seller who received the payment directly from the buyer.\n\nThe company’s revenues for 1997 were $5.7 million. They more than doubled to $13.2 million in 1998. During that period the number of registered users increased from 340,000 to more than 850,000. At the time of the IPO, founder and chairman, Pierre Omidyar owned 42 percent of the company.\n\nJust before its IPO, eBay had entered into a three-year agreement with America Online (AOL). In exchange for $12 million in payments to AOL, eBay became the exclusive online trading community for AOL. By October 1998 eBay’s community had grown to more than 1 million registered users, and some 700,000 items were listed in more than 1,000 categories.\n\nSOARING GROWTH\n\nThroughout 1999, 2000 and 2001 eBay grew by adding new categories, forming strategic partnerships and making acquisitions. Following the buy-out of Kruse International in 1999, eBay launched a new automotive category later in the year. In March 2000, the company launched a co-branded automotive site with AutoTrader.com called eBayMotors.com that sold only used and collectible cars. eBay also acquired Billpoint, to facilitate person-to-person credit card payments over the Internet.\n\neBay collaborated with Warner Bros. and Juno Online Services, among others. These partnerships allowed the company’s online users to bid on entertainment merchandise and made eBay the exclusive provider of online trading services on JunoLand, Juno’s online community site, and on Shop@Juno. eBay also acquired the prestigious art and antiques auction house Butterfield & Butterfield for $260 million. This facilitated eBay’s entry into higher priced items and enabled it to enhance its position in middle-tier items priced from $500 to $5,000. Later, in 2002, it sold Butterfield & Butterfield after disappointing results. Internationally, eBay purchased Germany’s largest online trading company, alando.de AG.\n\nDuring 1999, eBay also rolled out more than 30 regional websites in US cities nationwide. It introduced a new service called Personal Shopper that provided potential buyers with email alerts when an item in a category they were interested in came up for auction. In November 1999, together with collectible and hobby publisher Krause Publications, eBay launched eBay Magazine. Two books, The Official eBay Guide and eBay for Dummies, were also published in 1999.\n\neBay, however, faced a series or problems in 1999 – from a man trying to sell his kidney online to its servers going down. In mid-1999 the company experienced its worst outage ever when software problems and a lack of server redundancy put the company offline for more than a day. As a result, eBay lost more than $5 million and 20 per cent of its market value.\n\nIn 2000 eBay and Wells Fargo launched Electronic Check, a new payment option for eBay buyers and sellers – essentially an online personto-person payment platform. eBay Japan was launched with NEC Corp the same year. It also announced several wireless agreements as part of its “eBay anywhere” strategy. The strategy was designed to make eBay accessible from any Internet-enabled mobile device. Specific agreements also were reached with Oracle Mobile, a subsidiary of Oracle Corp., and with Sprint PCS.\n\nBy mid-2000, a survey found out that eBay users spent an average of one hour and 42 minutes on the site and viewed 256 pages, making eBay the ‘‘stickiest” website on the Internet. At the time eBay had more than 12 million registered users. The same year, eBay acquiredfor more than $300 million in stock Half.com, a fixed-price, person-to-person trading marketplace.\n\nIn November 2000 eBay announced that it would begin to license its auction technology to enable other firms to create their own applications. The eBay application program interface (API) initially was made available to selected licensed partners and developers. By February 2001 some 20 to 30 other sites and developers were enrolled in the program or had expressed an interest in joining. FairMarket hosted private label auctions for 70 companies including J.C. Penney, Dell Computer and CompUSA. Another licensee, GoTo Auctions, became the first application to be certified for eBay’s API program. GoTo Auction’s ChannelFusion Network allowed users to sell items on six different auction sites, including eBay, Amazon.com and Yahoo! Auctions.\n\nTHE KEY : INNOVATION\n\nFor 2000, eBay reported revenue of $431.4 million and net income of $48.3 million. The company was debt-free and had no interest expense. In its first five years of operations, eBay had grown from one man’s hobby into a global business. At each key moment in its development, eBay’s creator and managers had constantly matched market need with service delivery. And the innovations continued to flow.\n\nIn January 2001, eBay launched eBay Premier, a new site for art, antiques, and rare collectibles. eBay Premier hosted an online auction of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia, including the famous “Red Velvet” nude photos from 1949, in conjunction with a live auction at Butterfield & Butterfield. Although bidding for the photos failed to reach the necessary minimum price and they were not sold, other items were sold out in the $15,000 to $20,000 range. eBay reported that close to 60 per cent of the bids were placed through eBay Premier, as were about 20 per cent of the items that sold.\n\nIn 2001 eBay announced that it would acquire a majority interest in Korea’s largest auction website, Internet Auction Co. Ltd., for about $120 million. At the time eBay was reported to be the number one online auctioneer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Australia. It also operated sites in France, Japan, Ireland, New Zealand, and Switzerland.\n\neBay meanwhile formed an alliance with Microsoft that would integrate eBay’s auction marketplace into selected Microsoft websites. Other new partnerships included an alliance with Artnet.com that made Artnet.com’s fine art pricing database available to eBay Premier customers. An alliance with Eppraisals.com gave eBay users access to professional art and antiques appraisers. EBay also bought iBazar, the Paris-based online trading network that hosted online auction sites in eight European countries, including six where eBay had no current presence.\n\neBay launched eBay Stores in 2001 and 18,000 merchants signed up to sell musical instruments, jewelry, electronics and collectibles. President and CEO Meg Whitman called eBay Stores “the next step in eBay’s evolution.” The storefronts combined fixed-price retailing with eBay’s auction system. Other new initiatives included an agreement with luxury gift e-tailer Ashford.com to sell its left-over and close-out merchandise on eBay in both a fixed price and an auction format. eBay also formed an alliance with Terra Lycos to integrate eBay auctions into the Lycos auction site and make eBay a featured advertiser onthe Lycos network. In mid-2001 eBay launched a new service involving newspaper classified ads. The eBay Seller Classifieds program gave sellers the opportunity to market their items to a wider range of potential buyers.\n\nEver more ambitious by the day, eBay now decided to raise its listing fees. The fee increases were the company’s first since December 1996. Analysts had predicted that the new fees could boost eBay’s revenue by as much as five per cent in 2001. So, despite the dot-combust, when numerous Internet companies went under and closed down, eBay was one of the few to achieve continuous profitability. It was the first company to figure out how to make online auctions work.\n\nIn 2001 eBay’s audience grew by nearly 4 million to a total of more than 22.1 million users. eBay ranked second among all Internet sellers, capturing 14.5 percent of all Internet shoppers. Little competition was seen on the horizon, although Amazon and Yahoo! were creating a niche in the online auction marketplace through new initiatives.\n\nTo facilitate secure online money transactions, eBay acquired online payment system provider PayPal for around $1.5 billion in stock in 2002. eBay’s tax-free, stock-for-stock acquisition of PayPal enabled it to accelerate the velocity of trade by eliminating the various obstacles presented by traditional payment methods. eBay’s net revenues for 2002 were $1.21 billion, a 62 per cent increase over the $748.8 million reported in 2001. In 2003 eBay bought Eachnet, a leading Chinese e-tailer, for $180 million. eBay sellers listed a total of 971 million items in 2003, 52 per cent higher than the 638 million listings reported in 2002. Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS), the total value of items sold, was a record $24 billion, representing a 60 per cent year-on-year increase from the $15 billion reported in 2002. eBay declared net revenue of $2.17 billion, a 78 per cent increase over the $1.21 billion it reported in 2002.\n\nThe success of eBay would have been impossible without the emergence, however incipient, of an online community. This was the institutional platform on which eBay astutely built a scalable business. It was also essential to eBay’s long-term viability that it made the online trading experience faster, easier and safer, to better enable the success of its user community. For example, through the acquisition of its PayPal service, the company enabled any business or consumer with e-mail to send and receive online payments securely, conveniently and costeffectively.\n\nTechnology was the key to eBay’s success. David F. Hawkins and Jacob Cohen of Harvard Business School in a research paper analysed the online firm’s approach: “The eBay platform was composed of a scalable transaction processing system, consumer user interface, and externally accessible Application Programming Interface, API, for third-party integrations. The scalable system was primarily based on internally developed proprietary software, but also included selected vendor components. eBay used internally developed systems to operate its service and for transaction processing, including billing and collections processing. The company believed it had to continually improve its system to accommodate the increasing levels of use of Websites.”\n\nBut beyond the technology lay the sheer spirit of fun that drew buyers and sellers to eBay. Echoing a broad sentiment, Patti Waldmeir of the Financial Times said: “I hate to shop but I love to eBay and the bargains are the least of it. Trading on eBay is like living in a medieval village in cyberspace: a place where the cash is cold but the hearts are warm, where every transaction has its story.”\n\nIn 2005, eBay acquired Gumtree, a network of UK local city classifieds sites. It then bought an online comparison site for $635 million and Skype Technologies, the soft phone/messaging company founded by the developer of KaZaa, for $2.60 billion. eBay saw its revenue and earnings rise in its third quarter ending September 30, 2005: net revenue came in at $1.106 billion and net income rose to $255 million.\n\nMETHOD IN THE MADNESS\n\nThroughout its frenetic expansion, eBay has merged diverse companies following an apparently random strategy. It has a track record of making deals that harmonize its core business. While the auction site is still the company’s flagship, it has mitigated future risk by acquiring these companies.\n\nWhen you look at Half.com, Shopping.com and PayPal they are all directly related to online commerce and were quite well established in their own way. By acquiring them eBay created a stronghold in their specific territories. Skype, on the other hand, at first glance looks a bit of an over-reach. Dave Edwards of American Technology Research, says: “The Skype acquisition is an expensive price tag in the short run, it’s challenging to figure out if the Skype business model will be successful, but the company is valuing it on its long term potential, as Skype is not expected to break even until the fourth quarter of 2006.”\n\nBut if you look at it carefully, acquiring Skype was a natural decision to make as, by combining Skype and PayPal, eBay can create the ultimate e-commerce and communication engine for buyers and sellers. For example, the company can give its customers a new way to interact with each other and facilitate two-way exchanges.\n\nTHE eBay COMMUNITY\n\neBay is the middle-man between the seller and the buyer. Its community is made up of a variety of people: individual buyers and sellers, small businesses and larger companies. It has no control over user behavior at all. The key to eBay’s success is trust. Trust between the buyers and the sellers who make up the eBay community, and trust between the user and eBay, the company. eBay has tried to create a community where open and honest communication between all of its members are encouraged and fostered. Its values are simple but effective:\n\nWe believe people are basically good.\n\nWe believe everyone has something to contribute.\n\nWe believe that an honest, open environment can bring out the best in people.\n\nWe recognize and respect everyone as a unique individual.\n\nWe encourage you to treat others the way that you want to be treated.\n\nCEO Meg Whitman says: “It’s different from traditional leadership where, it’s usually: what does the center want to do? It’s command and control. At eBay, it’s a collaborative network.” She adds reflectively: “You are truly in partnership with the community of users. The key is connecting employees and customers in two way communication. We call it ‘The Power of All of Us.’”\n\nToday, large and small, “eBayers” come together to do more than just buy or sell. They have fun, shop around, get to know one another and pitch in to help. The sense of community on the eBay website is very active. eBay members have planned vacations together, chipped in and bought a special item for another member, and even helped other members to do home repairs. Some members have started scholarship foundations with the proceeds of their profits from eBay and some have become great friends through trading online.\n\nOmidyar says: “eBay’s business is based on enabling someone to do business with another person, and to do that, they first have to develop some measure of trust, either in the other person or the system. What makes eBay successful? The real value and the real power at eBay is the community. It’s the buyers and sellers coming together and forming a marketplace.”\n\nDriving the strategy of all this is eBay’s ability to reading accurately the shifting behavior of consumers. eBay’s business, in particular, has been moulded by its users and the belief of its founder. The success of eBay can be attributed to the firm’s ability to change, to adapt and to keep an open mind. Throughout its short history, i has kept on reinventing itself repeatedly. eBay attained great and early success but did not become complacent.Most of all, it listened carefully to its customers, paying close attention to what they do and don’t want. Where it could, it acquired other companies in the early curve of their own evolution cycles and integrated them.\n\neBay is now one of the world’s fastest-growing global businesses. Profitable right from its creation in 1995, the company dominates online auctions. Yet what eBay will become in another decade is impossible to predict, not least because it is a customer-based company and users’ needs keep surprising even eBay’s own management team at every turn.\n\nThe eBay story clearly is still being written. With the Internet expanding geometrically, eBay’s challenge is to continuously mitigate risk going forward. Competition could spring up at every corner. eBay’s relatively flat management structure makes it as nimble as a small start-up. Add to that its cash reserves and overwhelming marketshare and you have a formidable force. But the bedrock of it all: identifying the psychology of user trust and the power of community. All the complex dimensions of thinking – from motivation to ethics – come into play when you build a business model around people exchanging products and services.\n\nClear-thinking innovators like Omidyar recognize the key elements that go into buying and selling on the web. The ability to convert the creative ideas that emerge from such clear, innovative thinking into a scalable business is what has made eBay such an outstanding, if yet incomplete, story. Meg Whitman at ebay continues to lead the revolution."
