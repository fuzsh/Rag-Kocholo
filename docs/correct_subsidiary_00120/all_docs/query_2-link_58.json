        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThe Wisconsin G.I. Bill is a tuition remission program for eligible Wisconsin veterans, and certain children and spouses of eligible veterans, who are attending public institutions of higher education in Wisconsin. Details and application materials are available in this brochure pdf and online from the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs. A list of Universities of Wisconsin staff that can help you understand different features of the Wisconsin G.I. Bill is here Campus Veterans Coordinators. Important and up-to-date information about the Wisconsin G..I Bill is contained in Frequently Asked Questions on this page. The Frequently Asked Questions have been split into two parts, one for those with service before September 10, 2001, and one for those with service following September 10, 2001.\n\nAfter Sept 11, 2001\n\nBefore Sept 10, 2001\n\nUnderstanding Your Benefits\n\nAfter Sept 11, 2001\n\nPDF downloadable version of Q&A page: Post 9-11 pdf\n\nWhat is the WI G.I. Bill?\n\nThe WI GI Bill is a state of Wisconsin program to provide tuition benefits for qualifying Wisconsin veterans at Wisconsin public post-secondary educational institutions. The WI G.I. Bill was enacted in 2005. Wis. Stats. §36.27(3p) provides for a tuition remission for certain qualifying veterans, including both veterans who are Wisconsin residents and those veterans who would otherwise be non-residents but who are classified as residents for tuition purposes under the provisions of Wis. Stats. §36.27(2)(b)4.\n\nThe WI G.I. Bill also provides tuition remission benefits of 128 credits or 8 semesters, whichever is longer, for the eligible spouse, unremarried surviving spouse, and children of certain deceased and disabled veterans. The tuition remission is for the combined total credits and semesters attended at all University of Wisconsin (UW) institutions and Wisconsin Technical Colleges. For example, if a student uses 30 credits of WI GI Bill tuition remission at a Wisconsin Technical College and 30 credits of WI GI Bill tuition remissions at UW institutions, that student will have 68 WI GI Bill credits remaining of the 128 total credits allowed. Students will be responsible for the costs of credits beyond 128 credits or 8 semesters, whichever is longer.\n\nTo be eligible to receive the WI GI Bill tuition remission, spouses and children of eligible veterans must themselves be residents for tuition purposes (as defined by Wis. Stats. §36.27.2). Non-resident children and spouses are not eligible for WI G.I. Bill benefits.\n\nFurther questions about the WI GI Bill benefit can be directed to each UW System institution\n\nby the School Veterans Certifying Official. A list of those individuals and their contact information is available at http://uwhelp.wisconsin.edu/studentlife/gicontacts.asp\n\nThe Wisconsin G.I. bill includes two programs:\n\nVeterans who meet the qualifying criteria under Wis. Stats. §36.27 are eligible to receive 100% remission of standard academic fees (resident tuition) and 100% of segregated fees for 128 credit or 8 semesters, whichever is longer. An eligible veteran who entered active military duty as a Wisconsin resident but is nonetheless considered a non-resident for tuition purposes is eligible also to receive 100% remission of the non-resident portion of the tuition.\n\nThe spouse, surviving spouse, or child of certain deceased or disabled veterans who meet the eligibility criteria under Wis. Stats. §36.27(3n) are eligible to receive a remission of standard academic and segregated fees for 128 credit or 8 semesters, whichever is longer.\n\nAcademic fees are commonly referred to as either “resident tuition” or “in-state tuition.” Segregated fees are separate non-instructional fees charged to all students for the support of student life activities such as the student center and recreational sports, among others.\n\nAcademic fees over and above regular tuition and fees for undergraduate, graduate or professional courses are also eligible for remission including courses funded on a self-supporting or “cost recovery” basis. These courses, including distance education and online programs, are operated without state support. If you have questions about the remission of tuition and fees for a specific course contact the veterans' services coordinator at your campus for more information.\n\nThe Wisconsin G.I. bill remission does NOT apply to the following:\n\nAcademic fees charged by a UW institution for study abroad programs where the fees collected are subsequently paid by the UW institution to a non-Wisconsin institution. It also does not apply to any non-instructional fees charged in connection with a study abroad program such as for travel or living expenses.\n\nOther fees that are assessed in addition to academic student fees and segregated fees are not covered. Examples of costs that are not covered by the remission include, but are not limited to, travel, books, supplies, meals, parking, textbook rental, laptop rental, and other miscellaneous expenses. The excess credits surcharge, the United Council assessment and housing and meals plans are also not covered by the remission. Special course fees, such as laboratory fees, may also not be covered by the remission depending on the purpose of the special course fee.\n\nFees charged for continuing education courses (where continuing education units – CEU’s – are granted). The Wisconsin G.I. Bill applies only to tuition remissions for eligible individuals enrolled in academic, university-credit courses.\n\nPrior to registration, you are urged to check with the School Veterans Certifying Official at the campus you plan to attend to obtain specific information about any costs that may not be covered by the WI GI Bill Tuition Remission for your planned course of study. You will be assessed and are responsible to pay for any fees not covered by the WI G.I. Bill remission. Once the certification and eligibility process is completed you will be provided a bill indicating what fees are due and a due date by which to pay them. You will be responsible for the assessed fees.\n\nThe best way to know what benefits you are eligible for is to contact your County Veterans Service Office http://dva.state.wi.us/CVSO.asp or the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs http://dva.state.wi.us/ directly.\n\nRelationship between WI GI Bill and Federal Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chap 33)\n\nThe Post-9/11 GI Bill is a federal veterans’ benefits program administered by the federal Veterans Administration (VA) that began in August of 2009. The Post-9/11 GI Bill applies only to those who have had active duty military service following September 10, 2001. Veterans who are eligible for the federal Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit must elect that federal benefit in order to use the WI GI Bill. Veterans who are eligible to receive, but elect not to apply for Post-9/11 benefits will not be eligible for WI GI Bill benefits including tuition remission and supplemental payments. In the unlikely event a Post-9/11 eligible veteran elects to use the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) or another federal veteran’s education benefit program instead of the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) that veteran will not be concurrently eligible for WI GI Bill tuition remission and supplemental payments.\n\nEffective retroactive to January 1st 2010 credits and semesters supported by the Post-9/11 GI Bill at University of Wisconsin institutions or Wisconsin Technical Colleges will not be deducted from the total 128 credits or 8 semesters, whichever is longer, that a student can receive from the WI GI Bill. If you were a Post-9/11 eligible student on or after January 1st 2010 and have questions about the number of credits or semesters you have available under the WI GI Bill please contact your campus veterans’ services coordinator for more information.\n\nNOTE: The relationship between the federal and state legislation is extremely complex and depends upon an individual’s status and eligibility for a wide range of federal and state benefits. A flow chart is provided at the end of this document to visually capture some of the “what if” situations.\n\nFor WI GI Bill eligible veterans: Yes, if a veteran has fewer than 12 months of eligibility remaining under Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill – Active Duty), Chapter 1606 (Montgomery GI Bill – Selected Reserve), or Chapter 1607 (REAP) as of the first day of the academic term in which he or seeks to enroll, he or she may be exempt from the requirement to switch to the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.\n\nOr, if a veteran has no Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit eligibility based upon his or her own military service but has received transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits from a parent or spouse, the student is not required to use the transferred benefits in order to use the WI GI Bill.\n\nFor WI GI Bill eligible children and spouses: Yes, if the student is eligible for the WI GI Bill as a child or spouse, and the student also has Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit eligibility based upon his or her own military service, the student may continue to use the WI GI Bill without using his or her own Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.\n\nStudents certified for partial Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and for the WI GI Bill remission can use both benefits in a single term. The WI GI Bill remission will pay the difference for any tuition and fees that it would normally cover, as described above in Question #2.\n\nYes, if a WI GI Bill eligible child or spouse (who is not themselves a veteran), has received transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits from a parent or spouse, the student (that is the child or spouse) must use the transferred benefits before he or she can receive benefits under the WI GI Bill. If the child or spouse has received transferred Post-9/11 Bill benefits and does not elect to use them, he or she will not be eligible to receive the WI GI Bill tuition remission until such time as he or she does elect to use the transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit first.\n\nIf the WI GI Bill eligible child or spouse has fewer than 12 months of eligibility remaining (as of the first day of the academic term in which he or she seeks to enroll) under Chapter 35 (DEA), Chapter 1606 (Montgomery GI Bill – Selected Reserve), or Chapter 1607 (REAP), he or she may be exempt from the requirement to use transferred benefits first.\n\nNo. Veterans who have transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a spouse or children must have retained or reclaimed for their own use sufficient months of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits in order to use the WI GI Bill for that term.\n\nIf a veteran transfers all of their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a child and/or spouse, the veteran will be ineligible for the WI GI Bill until such time as the child or spouse completely exhausts the transferred benefits, or the veteran reclaims some benefits for him or herself.\n\nApplying for WI G.I. Bill Benefits\n\nNO, these FAQs are only for:\n\nVeterans, children and spouses also eligible for the federal Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (Chapter 33); and\n\nStudents attending University of Wisconsin System institutions.\n\nIf you are a student in the Wisconsin Technical College System, contact the appropriate School Veterans Certifying Official. They are listed in the brochure described in the next question.\n\nA brochure that explains the benefits and includes links necessary to apply is available for online at WIGI Bill Brochure.\n\nThis information is also available from your County Veterans Service Office (CVSO) or the School Veterans Certifying Official at your educational institution. Your CVSO provides information and assistance in obtaining state and federal veterans benefits. For a listing of CVSO’s go to https://wicvso.org/locate-your-cvso/\n\nYes. To be considered for the WI G.I. Bill benefits you must submit the form entitled “Request for Certification…” (#2030) to the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) AND submit the form “Application for WI G.I. Bill Benefits…” (#2029) to the educational institution you plan to attend. When WDVA determines the eligibility of the veteran, they will notify the educational institution of their determination. To have the certification process proceed in a timely manner, you must submit your application to the educational institution at the same time you submit your certification request to the WDVA. Certification by WDVA is only the first part of a two part WI GI Bill eligibility process. WDVA certifies the veteran is eligible, and the post-secondary educational institution determines if a student (be it veteran, spouse, or child of a veteran) is eligible for tuition remission based upon state statute.\n\nApply early! Please submit applications for WI G.I. Bill benefits to WDVA and to the UW institution you plan to attend no later than 14 calendar days from the official start of the fall or spring term, by June 1st for summer terms, and by the due date for term fees for interim terms in order to have your remission processed in a timely manner. Applying within the suggested timeline allows for financial aid to be accurately determined and reduces the risk of receiving an overpayment that would need to be repaid to the institution.\n\nBe sure to submit the request for certification to WDVA at the same time as you submit the application to your educational institution in order to allow time for WDVA to process the application, request additional information if needed, and send the completed certification to the educational institution. You are responsible for responding in a timely fashion if WDVA requests additional information.\n\nIf WDVA certification is not received by the educational institution by November 1 for fall, April 1 for spring, and July 1 for summer, you may not be eligible to receive the remission for that term. Certifications received after these dates will be processed for the subsequent term. Remissions will not be granted for terms occurring prior to the date established on an approved WDVA 2031 \"REQUEST FOR CERTIFICATION FOR WISCONSIN G.I. BILL\" form.\n\nOnce the certification and eligibility process have been successfully completed, a student's account will be adjusted to reflect the remission. The student will be responsible for any unpaid fees and late charges that accrue after a specified due date.\n\nAn academic term, and its beginning and ending date, is defined by the educational institution. A term may be fall, spring, winter, or summer. In this document, “semester” and “term” are used synonymously.\n\nOnce you have applied, have been granted certification by WDVA, and have been determined eligible by the educational institution, you do not need to reapply if you are continuously enrolled at that same institution. However, if there are changes to your residency, marital status, or to other items requested as part of the WI G.I. Bill benefits application (Form #2029), you must inform the school. If there is a break in your enrollment, excluding summer, or if you transfer to another UW System institution, you will need to reapply to the educational institution you plan to attend.\n\nOnce a specific UW institution has deemed that you are eligible for the WI G.I. Bill tuition remission, you will continue to receive this remission unless you inform the School Veterans Certifying Official in writing, within 14 calendar days from the official start of the fall or spring term, or by June 1st for summer sessions, that you do not wish to receive it.\n\nIt is your responsibility to notify WDVA of any changes in the disability assessment of the eligible veteran.\n\nIf you have been awarded a remission, the educational institution to which you have applied will notify you that your application has been successful and that the remission has been put into place. You will also receive a bill assessing you for any fees not covered by the remission (see Question #2). To avoid late charges, you will be responsible for paying those fees by the date determined by your campus for individuals receiving WI G.I. Bill remissions.\n\nYes. The amounts and types of financial aid for which you are eligible may be affected by the WI G.I. Bill tuition remission. If your WI G.I. Bill tuition remission is approved after your financial aid package has already been issued, the financial aid package will need to be reassessed to reflect the new tuition resources you have received. Financial aid reassessments may occur throughout a term and are required by federal law whenever a student’s financial need changes. Please consult the Financial Aid Office at the school you are attending if you have questions.\n\nEligibility\n\nEligibility for the WI GI Bill benefit is determined in part by the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) and in part by the Wisconsin public institution of higher education where you will attend. WDVA determines some components of eligibility and the institution of higher education determines other components. You will be required to submit to the UW System institution you wish to attend, an application (Form #2029), and other materials to demonstrate if:\n\nYou have been certified as eligible for the benefit by WDVA.\n\nYou maintain or enroll with a cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.0.\n\nYou are a child or spouse of an eligible veteran, and are you within the statutory time frame to receive the benefit.\n\nIf you are a child or spouse of an eligible veterans, and you are a resident of Wisconsin for tuition purposes as defined by Wis. Stats. 36.27(2).\n\nYou have had no active duty service since September 10, 2001.\n\nYou have had active duty service since September 20, 2001, you have applied for the Federal Post-9/11 GI Bill and provided a Certificate of Eligibility, current Federal Veterans Administration Award letter, or a rejection letter from the Federal Veterans Administration.\n\nYou have had Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (Chapter 33) transferred to you.\n\nYou have exhausted the 128 credits or 8 terms, whichever is longer, eligibility to receive the WI GI Bill Benefit.\n\nYour remaining federal benefit eligibility and any kickers or buy-up contracts you have.\n\nThe application packet for the WI GI bill has a checklist of the documentation that will be needed depending upon whether you are applying for the WI GI Bill as a veteran, child, or spouse. If you have questions about what documents are needed, confer with your Veterans Certifying Official at the higher educational institution.\n\nNo, the WI G.I. Bill legislation is only for students attending University of Wisconsin institutions or Wisconsin Technical Colleges.\n\nWisconsin veteran status does not require that one is in inactive duty status. If you meet all of the eligibility requirements, the WI G.I. Bill can apply for those still on active duty. It is possible to be currently in the military (Active Duty, Guard, or Reserves) and be considered a Wisconsin state veteran at the same time.\n\nTo be eligible a veteran applicant must be a resident of Wisconsin at the time of application and remain living in Wisconsin while using the benefit unless serving on active duty. The WDVA definition of resident is found under Wis Stat. §45.02(2) of the Wisconsin Statutes and the UW System definition of resident under Wis. Stats. §36.27(2).\n\nThe term “resident” as it is used in Wis. Stats. §36.27(3n) relating to fee remissions for certain family members of eligible veterans” refers to residency for tuition purposes under Wis. Stats. §36.27(2). In other words, the family member (eligible child or spouse) must be determined to be a “resident for tuition purposes” to satisfy one of the criteria for eligibility for G.I. Bill benefits.\n\nIf you are denied eligibility by WDVA, you will receive notice of the denial directly from WDVA. You may appeal this denial to WDVA according to WDVA’s own appeal protocol as described in the notice of denial.\n\nIf you are denied a tuition remission after having been determined eligible by WDVA, you will be informed by the educational institution. Typically, the School Veterans Certifying Official will contact you in writing to inform you of the denial and the basis for the denial. If you wish to appeal the institutional decision, contact the School Veterans Certifying Official at your institution to request information about the institution’s appeal protocol.\n\nNo, spouses, unremarried surviving spouses, and the veterans themselves are not required to be enrolled full-time. However, children and spouses must be Wisconsin residents for tuition purposes and meet other eligibility requirements.\n\nYou can receive the WI GI Bill tuition remission for a combined total of up to 128 credits or eight semesters (whichever is longer) at any public higher educational institution in Wisconsin (i.e., all UW institutions and all Wisconsin Technical Colleges) beginning the first time you are granted the WI G.I. Bill remission, provided that you maintain the other eligibility status requirements. The WI G.I. Bill was first implemented for the fall 2005 academic term. Students cannot receive remissions for semesters or credits used prior to that time or for any academic term for which there is no WDVA certification.\n\nYour credits/semesters while enrolled at any Wisconsin public higher educational institution (UW institutions and Wisconsin Technical Colleges) are cumulative under the WI G.I. Bill. Your eligibility limitations (age, number of credits/semesters, etc.) are tracked based on enrollment at all UW System institutions and at Wisconsin Technical Colleges. Remember that if you transfer or have a break of more than a semester (other than summer) in enrollment, you will need to submit a new application for the WI G.I. Bill tuition remission to the applicable UW institution.\n\nIn order to receive a WI G.I. Bill remission, you need to apply for it at each UW institution or Wisconsin Technical College you attend.\n\nIf you are concurrently enrolled in more than one UW System institution and/or WTCS institution and have been granted a WI G.I. Bill tuition remission, your credits earned/semesters attended at UW System institutions and WTCS institutions are cumulative under the WI G.I. Bill, the same as they are in the case of transfer between institutions (see question #25).\n\nYou have eight full semesters to receive this remission, even if your credits total more than 128. Conversely, you may receive this remission for more than eight semesters, as long as your total credits remain under 128.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf you have received the remission for fewer than eight semesters but have completed 128 credits, you will still be eligible for eight semesters of remission even if it will put your total credits over 128.\n\nYou can continue to get the remission for more than eight semesters if the number of credits you’ve taken is less than 128. After you have received the remission for eight or more semesters, and your credits total 128, you will not receive the remission for subsequent semesters.\n\nIf a grade is assigned in a course, then those credits will count towards the 128 credit limit. All courses graded on an A-F scale, pass/fail, or other basis that earns degree credit will count toward the limit. If you drop a course prior to the institutional add/drop deadline, the course will not appear on the transcript and will not count toward the 128 credit limit. Courses dropped after that deadline will appear on the transcript with a grade (e.g. W or DR) and will count toward the 128 credit limit.\n\nIf you withdraw from the institution prior to the 100% refund deadline, the semester and credits will not be counted toward the eight semesters and 128 credits allowed for the WI G.I. Bill benefits. If you withdraw from the institution after the 100% refund deadline, the semester and credits will count against the eight semesters and 128 credits you are allowed under the WI G.I. Bill.\n\nIf you are eligible for a partial refund because of the timing of your withdrawal, the University will refund the appropriate percentage of tuition paid by the federal VA. For example, if you are eligible for a 50% refund, 50% of the tuition paid by the federal VA will be refunded. Remember, because of federal VA rules regarding dropping and withdrawing, you may be responsible to repay the VA more than the amount refunded to you by the University. Please note that the semester and all credits will count against the eight semesters and 128 credits you are allowed under the WI G.I. Bill.\n\nIn some cases, if the withdrawal is due to medical circumstances, you may not be required to count the semester or credits against your WI GI Bill eligibility. Contact the veterans' services coordinator at your campus for more information.\n\nState law has mandated since January 1, 2014 that you must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA to qualify for any tuition and fee remissions under the WIGI Bill program. This means that if your cumulative GPA is not at least 2.0, you will not qualify for tuition and fee remissions and you are responsible for any tuition and fee costs associated with enrolling in classes. The 2.0 cumulative GPA requirement covers grades earned at any point in your post-secondary academic career that your institution determines count toward your cumulative GPA.\n\nWhat if I earned a low cumulative GPA several years ago and plan to return to the same institution now?\n\nYour cumulative GPA does not change or reset at the institution where it was earned regardless of when the GPA was calculated. The integrity, consistency and accuracy of student records is an important job on campus and subject to regulation by state and federal law. The state law creating the 2.0 cumulative GPA requirement does not include provisions that would enable institutions to modify or ignore grades earned in the past.\n\nCan I appeal my cumulative GPA?\n\nThere is no cumulative GPA appeal process linked to the Wisconsin GI Bill. Some, but not all, UW institutions have processes that allow students to appeal or request “academic forgiveness” that if granted, can impact the calculation of a student’s cumulative GPA. Academic forgiveness is not granted based on eligibility for the Wisconsin GI Bill and typically requires academic approval at the program, departmental and provost levels. Academic forgiveness is managed by academic departments and is not granted by the campus veterans’ coordinator. Students interested in learning about academic forgiveness should contact an academic advisor.\n\nCan I use the Wisconsin GI Bill if transfer a UW institution other than the one where I earned a cumulative GPA less of than 2.0?\n\nIt depends on polices in place at the institution where you are planning to enroll. In the same way that requirements for admission differ across UW institutions so do rules around how they accept and count grades earned at other institutions. UW institutions may start transfer students with a “clean” 0.0 cumulative GPA and exclude grades earned at other institutions. Depending on policies in place, institutions and academic departments may include grades earned at other institutions in their cumulative GPA calculations for transfer students. If you are planning to transfer with less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA, contact the admissions office and the Veterans Certifying Official to check on institutional rules covering grades for transfer students. Remember that if you enroll in classes with less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA you will not use any credits against the Wisconsin GI Bill 128 credit limit and the full amount of your remaining benefit will be available to use in terms when your cumulative GPA returns to 2.0 or higher.\n\nHow does the Wisconsin GI Bill benefit work if I am not eligible but improve my cumulative GPA to 2.0 or better?\n\nBecause cumulative GPA is calculated after a term ends, you will be able to use Wisconsin GI Bill benefits in the first term when your cumulative GPA is established to be 2.0 or better. For example, if your cumulative GPA at the start of a fall term is 1.8 you will not receive tuition and fee remissions for that fall term. However, if your cumulative GPA improves to 2.2 at the end of the fall term you will be eligible to use benefits in the subsequent spring term. In the same manner, if at the end of the spring term your GPA falls from 2.5 to 1.8, your tuition and fee remission is still in effect for the spring term in which your grades fell. The benefit will not be available in subsequent terms however.\n\nWhat is the basic idea underlying cumulative GPA and how is it calculated?\n\nKeeping in mind that transfer students and students granted academic forgiveness may have certain grades excluded from GPA calculations the general quality of a student's work over time can be expressed in terms of the cumulative grade point average (GPA).when grades earned in all terms are added together. The cumulative GPA is the total number of grade points earned divided by the total number of academic credits. The highest possible average is 4.000 or an A in every subject. In general, a letter grade of A equals 4.00 points, a B grade equals 3.00 points, a C grade equals 2.00 points, a D grade equals 1.00 point and an F equals 0.00 points. Below is an example of how a cumulative GPA is calculated for hypothetical Fall and Spring term:\n\nSupplemental Payment\n\nStudents who elect to switch from federal Chapter 30 (Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty), Chapter 1606 (Montgomery GI Bill–Selected Reserve), or Chapter 1607 (REAP) to the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit in order to use WI GI Bill benefits (as required by Wisconsin State Law), may be eligible for a state Supplemental payment paid by the Wisconsin college or university.\n\nThis payment represents an approximation of the difference between the benefits a student would have received from Chapter 30, Chapter 1606, or Chapter 1607 and those the student will receive after relinquishing another federal benefit to enroll in the Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n\nNo. Students who receive an equivalent or larger benefit package under Post-9/11 GI Bill, or who have exhausted their 36 months of Chapter 30 benefits, will not receive a Supplemental payment.\n\nAlso, veterans using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits that were transferred to them by a parent or spouse are not eligible for a Supplemental Payment.\n\nChildren and spouses may be eligible for a Supplemental Payment if they switched from Chapter 35, Chapter 1606, or Chapter 1607 in order to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits transferred to them by a parent or spouse. Children and spouses are not eligible for a Supplemental Payment if they switch from Chapter 30.\n\nChildren and spouses who switched from Chapter 30, Chapter 35, Chapter 1606, or Chapter 1607 to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits earned through their own military service are not eligible for a Supplemental Payment.\n\nYes. To determine if you are eligible for a supplemental payment and to make the necessary calculations to determine the amount you will receive if you are eligible, you will need to provide the following documents to your school certifying official:\n\nFederal VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for the Post-9/11 GI Bill OR Current Federal VA Award Letter for Post-9/11 GI Bill\n\nMost recent DD-214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)\n\nPapers documenting “kicker” entitlements\n\nPapers or receipts documenting “buy-up” contracts\n\nIf a student is attending multiple schools during a single semester, the student can only receive a supplemental payment from one school. It is the responsibility of the student to tell the school certifying officials at the UW and/or Wisconsin Technical College(s) about any other schools he/she is attending during that semester. Based on a number of factors, the schools will determine which institution will make the supplemental payment. The school calculating the supplemental payment will include enrollment information from all of the schools that the student is attending. Students failing to inform their school certifying official may receive too small a supplemental payment because the school does not have enough information to calculate the correct payment, or may receive too large a supplemental payment and will be required to return any excess payment.\n\nThe supplemental payment paid under the WI GI Bill is considered as a student resource for financial aid purposes and may affect your eligibility for other state or federal financial aid. Financial Aid offices will estimate the Supplemental Payment when determining your financial aid package.\n\nSupplemental payments will be directly deposited into your student account according to standard campus business practices and are subject to any other outstanding financial obligations you may have.\n\nThe Supplemental Payment will be made twice each term. The first payment will be for 50% of the estimated semester amount and applied to the student’s account sometime after the institution’s last day to drop courses. The second payment, for the remainder of the final adjusted amount, will be made after grades for the term are posted. All Supplemental Payments will be made based on this timing, even if the student is enrolled in a session that does not coincide with the standard term begin and end dates.\n\nIn compliance with federal requirements, UW and WTCS institutions provide the 1098-T to students. Neither UW nor WTCS institutions provide personal tax advice or guidance to students. Students are responsible for working with a tax professional to assess the tax implications of the Supplemental Payment.\n\nStudents will be responsible for repaying the college or university for any supplemental payment amount paid in excess of their eligibility. This is most likely to occur if a student adds or drops classes or withdraws during a semester.\n\nSpouse and Child Benefits\n\nFor the purposes of the WI G.I. Bill, the UW System has chosen to use the definitions outlined in Wis. Stats. §45.01(4), which define a child as “any biological child, any adopted child, any stepchild, or any other child who is a member of the veteran’s household, or any non-marital child if the veteran acknowledges paternity or paternity has been otherwise established.”\n\nThe following documentation in addition to providing your own government issued photo I.D. (driver license, state I.D., passport, etc) demonstrates that a student applicant is a “child” of an eligible veteran.\n\nBiological Child: A copy of the student’s Birth Certificate or similar official documents that identify parentage.\n\nAdopted Child: A copy of the student’s Adoption Certificate.\n\nStepchild: A copy of the student’s Birth Certificate and a Marriage License that demonstrates the eligible veteran has married a biological parent of the student, or a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility for Federal VA benefits that indicates recognition as a stepchild.\n\nOther Child Who is a Member of the Veteran’s Household: A copy of the veteran’s most recent state and federal income taxes where the student is listed as a dependent and the student’s permanent address is the same as the veteran’s household address.\n\nNon-marital Child: A copy of a certificate of paternity.\n\nThe following documentation is required to demonstrate that a student applicant is eligible for WI GI Bill tuition remission as the spouse of an eligible veteran.\n\nThe spouse’s government issued photo I.D. (driver license, state I.D., passport, etc).\n\nA copy of the marriage certificate showing the student’s marriage to the certified veteran.\n\nThe following documentation is required to determine that a student applicant is eligible as an unremarried surviving spouse. These documents will be used to determine the eligibility ending date of WI GI Bill benefits for the unremarried surviving spouse.\n\nA copy of the marriage certificate showing the student’s marriage to the certified veteran.\n\nA copy of the latest federal or state tax return for the unremarried surviving spouse.\n\nA copy of the birth certificate or adoption papers for the youngest child born to or adopted by the unremarried surviving spouse and the certified veteran.\n\nYes. Photocopies are fine.\n\nThe child of an eligible veteran must be at least 17 years old but not yet 26 years old on the first day of instruction as established by the institution, in order to take advantage of the WI G.I. Bill in a particular academic term.\n\nIf the child’s 26th birthday falls on or after the second day of the term, the child would be eligible for the benefit for that term.\n\nNo. Wis. Stats. §36.27(3n) provides 100% remissions to certain spouses, surviving unremarried spouses and children of deceased or disabled veterans, if the student (spouse or child) is a resident student, which means a resident for tuition purposes. Thus, if the student was not a Wisconsin resident or relinquished Wisconsin residency, he or she would no longer be eligible for the benefit, even all of the other qualifications were met.\n\nNew Wisconsin G.I. Bill Benefit Structure as of July 2011\n\nBefore Sept 10, 2001\n\nPDF downloadable version of Q&A page: Pre 9-11 pdf\n\nWhat is the WI G.I. Bill?\n\nThe WI GI Bill is a state of Wisconsin program to provide tuition benefits for qualifying Wisconsin veterans at Wisconsin public post-secondary educational institutions. The WI G.I. Bill was enacted in 2005. Wis. Stats. §36.27(3p) provides for a tuition remission for certain qualifying veterans, including both veterans who are Wisconsin residents and those veterans who would otherwise be non-residents but who are classified as residents for tuition purposes under the provisions of Wis. Stats. §36.27(2)(b)4.\n\nThe WI G.I. Bill also provides tuition remission benefits of 128 credits or 8 semesters, whichever is longer, for the eligible spouse, unremarried surviving spouse, and children of certain deceased and disabled veterans. The tuition remission is for the combined total credits and semesters attended at all University of Wisconsin (UW) institutions and Wisconsin Technical Colleges. For example, if a student uses 30 credits of WI GI Bill tuition remission at a Wisconsin Technical College and 30 credits of WI GI Bill tuition remissions at UW institutions, that student will have 68 WI GI Bill credits remaining of the 128 total credits allowed. Students will be responsible for the costs of credits beyond 128 credits or 8 semesters, whichever is longer.\n\nTo be eligible to receive the WI GI Bill tuition remission, spouses and children of eligible veterans must themselves be residents for tuition purposes (as defined by Wis. Stats. §36.27.2). Non-resident children and spouses are not eligible for WI G.I. Bill benefits.\n\nFurther questions about the WI GI Bill benefit can be directed to each UW System institution\n\nby the School Veterans Certifying Official. A list of those individuals and their contact information is available at http://uwhelp.wisconsin.edu/studentlife/gicontacts.asp\n\nThe Wisconsin G.I. bill includes two programs:\n\nVeterans who meet the qualifying criteria under Wis. Stats. §36.27 are eligible to receive 100% remission of standard academic fees (resident tuition) and 100% of segregated fees for 128 credit or 8 semesters, whichever is longer. An eligible veteran who entered active military duty as a Wisconsin resident but is nonetheless considered a non-resident for tuition purposes is eligible also to receive 100% remission of the non-resident portion of the tuition.\n\nThe spouse, surviving spouse, or child of certain deceased or disabled veterans who meet the eligibility criteria under Wis. Stats. §36.27(3n) are eligible to receive a remission of standard academic and segregated fees for 128 credit or 8 semesters, whichever is longer.\n\nAcademic fees are commonly referred to as either “resident tuition” or “in-state tuition.” Segregated fees are separate non-instructional fees charged to all students for the support of student life activities such as the student center and recreational sports, among others.\n\nAcademic fees over and above regular tuition and fees for undergraduate, graduate or professional courses are also eligible for remission including courses funded on a self-supporting or “cost recovery” basis. These courses, including distance education and online programs, are operated without state support. If you have questions about the remission of tuition and fees for a specific course contact the veterans' services coordinator at your campus for more information.\n\nThe Wisconsin G.I. bill remission does NOT apply to the following:\n\nAcademic fees charged by a UW institution for study abroad programs where the fees collected are subsequently paid by the UW institution to a non-Wisconsin institution. It also does not apply to any non-instructional fees charged in connection with a study abroad program such as for travel or living expenses.\n\nOther fees that are assessed in addition to academic student fees and segregated fees are not covered. Examples of costs that are not covered by the remission include, but are not limited to, travel, books, supplies, meals, parking, textbook rental, laptop rental, and other miscellaneous expenses. The excess credits surcharge, the United Council assessment and housing and meals plans are also not covered by the remission. Special course fees, such as laboratory fees, may also not be covered by the remission depending on the purpose of the special course fee.\n\nFees charged for continuing education courses (where continuing education units – CEU’s – are granted). The Wisconsin G.I. Bill applies only to tuition remissions for eligible individuals enrolled in academic, university-credit courses.\n\nPrior to registration, you are urged to check with the School Veterans Certifying Official at the campus you plan to attend to obtain specific information about any costs that may not be covered by the WI GI Bill Tuition Remission for your planned course of study. You will be assessed and are responsible to pay for any fees not covered by the WI G.I. Bill remission. Once the certification and eligibility process is completed you will be provided a bill indicating what fees are due and a due date by which to pay them. You will be responsible for the assessed fees.\n\nThe best way to know what benefits you are eligible for is to contact your County Veterans Service Office http://dva.state.wi.us/CVSO.asp or the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs http://dva.state.wi.us/ directly.\n\nRelationship between WI GI Bill and Federal Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chap 33)\n\nThe Post-9/11 GI Bill is a federal veterans’ benefits program administered by the federal Veterans Administration (VA) that began in August of 2009. The Post-9/11 GI Bill applies only to those who have had active duty military service following September 10, 2001. Veterans who are eligible for the federal Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit must elect that federal benefit in order to use the WI GI Bill. Veterans who are eligible to receive, but elect not to apply for Post-9/11 benefits will not be eligible for WI GI Bill benefits including tuition remission and supplemental payments. In the unlikely event a Post-9/11 eligible veteran elects to use the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) or another federal veteran’s education benefit program instead of the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) that veteran will not be concurrently eligible for WI GI Bill tuition remission and supplemental payments.\n\nEffective retroactive to January 1st 2010 credits and semesters supported by the Post-9/11 GI Bill at University of Wisconsin institutions or Wisconsin Technical Colleges will not be deducted from the total 128 credits or 8 semesters, whichever is longer, that a student can receive from the WI GI Bill. If you were a Post-9/11 eligible student on or after January 1st 2010 and have questions about the number of credits or semesters you have available under the WI GI Bill please contact your campus veterans’ services coordinator for more information.\n\nNOTE: The relationship between the federal and state legislation is extremely complex and depends upon an individual’s status and eligibility for a wide range of federal and state benefits. A flow chart is provided at the end of this document to visually capture some of the “what if” situations.\n\nApplying for WI G.I. Bill Benefits\n\nNO, these FAQs are only for:\n\nVeterans, children and spouses also eligible for the federal Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (Chapter 33); and\n\nStudents attending University of Wisconsin System institutions.\n\nIf you are a student in the Wisconsin Technical College System, contact the appropriate School Veterans Certifying Official. They are listed in the brochure described in the next question.\n\nA brochure which explains the benefits, lists School Veterans Certifying Officials at each institution, and includes the forms necessary to apply is available for downloading on line at http://dva.state.wi.us/webForms/WDVA_B0105_Wisconsin_Tuition_Programs_WI_GI_Bill_Color.pdf\n\nThis information is also available from your County Veterans Service Office (CVSO) or the School Veterans Certifying Official at your educational institution. Your CVSO provides information and assistance in obtaining state and federal veterans benefits. For a listing of CVSO’s go to http://dva.state.wi.us/CVSO.asp.\n\nYes. To be considered for the WI G.I. Bill benefits you must submit the form entitled “Request for Certification…” (#2030) to the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) AND submit the form “Application for WI G.I. Bill Benefits…” (#2029) to the educational institution you plan to attend. When WDVA determines the eligibility of the veteran, they will notify the educational institution of their determination. To have the certification process proceed in a timely manner, you must submit your application to the educational institution at the same time you submit your certification request to the WDVA. Certification by WDVA is only the first part of a two part WI GI Bill eligibility process. WDVA certifies the veteran is eligible, and the post-secondary educational institution determines if a student (be it veteran, spouse, or child of a veteran) is eligible for tuition remission based upon state statute.\n\nApply early! Please submit applications for WI G.I. Bill benefits to WDVA and to the UW institution you plan to attend no later than 14 calendar days from the official start of the fall or spring term, by June 1st for summer terms, and by the due date for term fees for interim terms in order to have your remission processed in a timely manner. Applying within the suggested timeline allows for financial aid to be accurately determined and reduces the risk of receiving an overpayment that would need to be repaid to the institution.\n\nBe sure to submit the request for certification to WDVA at the same time as you submit the application to your educational institution in order to allow time for WDVA to process the application, request additional information if needed, and send the completed certification to the educational institution. You are responsible for responding in a timely fashion if WDVA requests additional information.\n\nIf WDVA certification is not received by the educational institution by November 1 for fall, April 1 for spring, and July 1 for summer, you may not be eligible to receive the remission for that term. Certifications received after these dates will be processed for the subsequent term.\n\nOnce the certification and eligibility process have been successfully completed, a student's account will be adjusted to reflect the remission. The student will be responsible for any unpaid fees and late charges that accrue after a specified due date.\n\nAn academic term, and its beginning and ending date, is defined by the educational institution. A term may be fall, spring, winter, or summer. In this document, “semester” and “term” are used synonymously.\n\nOnce you have applied, have been granted certification by WDVA, and have been determined eligible by the educational institution, you do not need to reapply if you are continuously enrolled at that same institution. However, if there are changes to your residency, marital status, or to other items requested as part of the WI G.I. Bill benefits application (Form #2029), you must inform the school. If there is a break in your enrollment, excluding summer, or if you transfer to another UW System institution, you will need to reapply to the educational institution you plan to attend.\n\nOnce a specific UW institution has deemed that you are eligible for the WI G.I. Bill tuition remission, you will continue to receive this remission unless you inform the School Veterans Certifying Official in writing, within 14 calendar days from the official start of the fall or spring term, or by June 1st for summer sessions, that you do not wish to receive it.\n\nIt is your responsibility to notify WDVA of any changes in the disability assessment of the eligible veteran.\n\nIf you have been awarded a remission, the educational institution to which you have applied will notify you that your application has been successful and that the remission has been put into place. You will also receive a bill assessing you for any fees not covered by the remission (see Question #2). To avoid late charges, you will be responsible for paying those fees by the date determined by your campus for individuals receiving WI G.I. Bill remissions.\n\nYes. The amounts and types of financial aid for which you are eligible may be affected by the WI G.I. Bill tuition remission. If your WI G.I. Bill tuition remission is approved after your financial aid package has already been issued, the financial aid package will need to be reassessed to reflect the new tuition resources you have received. Financial aid reassessments may occur throughout a term and are required by federal law whenever a student’s financial need changes. Please consult the Financial Aid Office at the school you are attending if you have questions.\n\nEligibility\n\nEligibility for the WI GI Bill benefit is determined in part by the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) and in part by the Wisconsin public institution of higher education where you will attend. WDVA determines some components of eligibility and the institution of higher education determines other components. You will be required to submit to the UW System institution you wish to attend, an application (Form #2029), and other materials to demonstrate if:\n\nYou have been certified as eligible for the benefit by WDVA.\n\nYou maintain or enroll with a cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.0.\n\nYou are a child or spouse of an eligible veteran, and are you within the statutory time frame to receive the benefit.\n\nIf you are a child or spouse of an eligible veterans, and you are a resident of Wisconsin for tuition purposes as defined by Wis. Stats. 36.27(2).\n\nYou have had no active duty service since September 10, 2001.\n\nYou have had active duty service since September 20, 2001, you have applied for the Federal Post-9/11 GI Bill and provided a Certificate of Eligibility, current Federal Veterans Administration Award letter, or a rejection letter from the Federal Veterans Administration.\n\nYou have had Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (Chapter 33) transferred to you.\n\nYou have exhausted the 128 credits or 8 terms, whichever is longer, eligibility to receive the WI GI Bill Benefit.\n\nYour remaining federal benefit eligibility and any kickers or buy-up contracts you have.\n\nThe application packet for the WI GI bill has a checklist of the documentation that will be needed depending upon whether you are applying for the WI GI Bill as a veteran, child, or spouse. If you have questions about what documents are needed, confer with your Veterans Certifying Official at the higher educational institution.\n\nNo, the WI G.I. Bill legislation is only for students attending University of Wisconsin institutions or Wisconsin Technical Colleges.\n\nWisconsin veteran status does not require that one is in inactive duty status. If you meet all of the eligibility requirements, the WI G.I. Bill can apply for those still on active duty. It is possible to be currently in the military (Active Duty, Guard, or Reserves) and be considered a Wisconsin state veteran at the same time.\n\nTo be eligible a veteran applicant must be a resident of Wisconsin at the time of application and remain living in Wisconsin while using the benefit unless serving on active duty. The WDVA definition of resident is found under Wis Stat. §45.02(2) of the Wisconsin Statutes and the UW System definition of resident under Wis. Stats. §36.27(2).\n\nThe term “resident” as it is used in Wis. Stats. §36.27(3n) relating to fee remissions for certain family members of eligible veterans” refers to residency for tuition purposes under Wis. Stats. §36.27(2). In other words, the family member (eligible child or spouse) must be determined to be a “resident for tuition purposes” to satisfy one of the criteria for eligibility for G.I. Bill benefits.\n\nIf you are denied eligibility by WDVA, you will receive notice of the denial directly from WDVA. You may appeal this denial to WDVA according to WDVA’s own appeal protocol as described in the notice of denial.\n\nIf you are denied a tuition remission after having been determined eligible by WDVA, you will be informed by the educational institution. Typically, the School Veterans Certifying Official will contact you in writing to inform you of the denial and the basis for the denial. If you wish to appeal the institutional decision, contact the School Veterans Certifying Official at your institution to request information about the institution’s appeal protocol.\n\nNo, spouses, unremarried surviving spouses, and the veterans themselves are not required to be enrolled full-time. However, children and spouses must be Wisconsin residents for tuition purposes and meet other eligibility requirements.\n\nYou can receive the WI GI Bill tuition remission for a combined total of up to 128 credits or eight semesters (whichever is longer) at any public higher educational institution in Wisconsin (i.e., all UW institutions and all Wisconsin Technical Colleges) beginning the first time you are granted the WI G.I. Bill remission, provided that you maintain the other eligibility status requirements. The WI G.I. Bill was first implemented for the fall 2005 academic term. Students cannot receive remissions for semesters or credits used prior to that time or for any academic term for which there is no WDVA certification.\n\nYour credits/semesters while enrolled at any Wisconsin public higher educational institution (UW institutions and Wisconsin Technical Colleges) are cumulative under the WI G.I. Bill. Your eligibility limitations (age, number of credits/semesters, etc.) are tracked based on enrollment at all UW System institutions and at Wisconsin Technical Colleges. Remember that if you transfer or have a break of more than a semester (other than summer) in enrollment, you will need to submit a new application for the WI G.I. Bill tuition remission to the applicable UW institution.\n\nIn order to receive a WI G.I. Bill remission, you need to apply for it at each UW institution or Wisconsin Technical College you attend.\n\nIf you are concurrently enrolled in more than one UW System institution and/or WTCS institution and have been granted a WI G.I. Bill tuition remission, your credits earned/semesters attended at UW System institutions and WTCS institutions are cumulative under the WI G.I. Bill, the same as they are in the case of transfer between institutions (see question #25).\n\nYou have eight full semesters to receive this remission, even if your credits total more than 128. Conversely, you may receive this remission for more than eight semesters, as long as your total credits remain under 128.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf you have received the remission for fewer than eight semesters but have completed 128 credits, you will still be eligible for eight semesters of remission even if it will put your total credits over 128.\n\nYou can continue to get the remission for more than eight semesters if the number of credits you’ve taken is less than 128. After you have received the remission for eight or more semesters, and your credits total 128, you will not receive the remission for subsequent semesters.\n\nIf a grade is assigned in a course, then those credits will count towards the 128 credit limit. All courses graded on an A-F scale, pass/fail, or other basis that earns degree credit will count toward the limit. If you drop a course prior to the institutional add/drop deadline, the course will not appear on the transcript and will not count toward the 128 credit limit. Courses dropped after that deadline will appear on the transcript with a grade (e.g. W or DR) and will count toward the 128 credit limit.\n\nIf you withdraw from the institution prior to the 100% refund deadline, the semester and credits will not be counted toward the eight semesters and 128 credits allowed for the WI G.I. Bill benefits. If you withdraw from the institution after the 100% refund deadline, the semester and credits will count against the eight semesters and 128 credits you are allowed under the WI G.I. Bill.\n\nIf you are eligible for a partial refund because of the timing of your withdrawal, the University will refund the appropriate percentage of tuition paid by the federal VA. For example, if you are eligible for a 50% refund, 50% of the tuition paid by the federal VA will be refunded. Remember, because of federal VA rules regarding dropping and withdrawing, you may be responsible to repay the VA more than the amount refunded to you by the University. Please note that the semester and all credits will count against the eight semesters and 128 credits you are allowed under the WI G.I. Bill.\n\nIn some cases, if the withdrawal is due to medical circumstances, you may not be required to count the semester or credits against your WI GI Bill eligibility. Contact the veterans' services coordinator at your campus for more information.\n\nState law has mandated since January 1, 2014 that you must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA to qualify for any tuition and fee remissions under the WIGI Bill program. This means that if your cumulative GPA is not at least 2.0, you will not qualify for tuition and fee remissions and you are responsible for any tuition and fee costs associated with enrolling in classes. The 2.0 cumulative GPA requirement covers grades earned at any point in your post-secondary academic career that your institution determines count toward your cumulative GPA.\n\nWhat if I earned a low cumulative GPA several years ago and plan to return to the same institution now?\n\nYour cumulative GPA does not change or reset at the institution where it was earned regardless of when the GPA was calculated. The integrity, consistency and accuracy of student records is an important job on campus and subject to regulation by state and federal law. The state law creating the 2.0 cumulative GPA requirement does not include provisions that would enable institutions to modify or ignore grades earned in the past.\n\nCan I appeal my cumulative GPA?\n\nThere is no cumulative GPA appeal process linked to the Wisconsin GI Bill. Some, but not all, UW institutions have processes that allow students to appeal or request “academic forgiveness” that if granted, can impact the calculation of a student’s cumulative GPA. Academic forgiveness is not granted based on eligibility for the Wisconsin GI Bill and typically requires academic approval at the program, departmental and provost levels. Academic forgiveness is managed by academic departments and is not granted by the campus veterans’ coordinator. Students interested in learning about academic forgiveness should contact an academic advisor.\n\nCan I use the Wisconsin GI Bill if transfer a UW institution other than the one where I earned a cumulative GPA less of than 2.0?\n\nIt depends on polices in place at the institution where you are planning to enroll. In the same way that requirements for admission differ across UW institutions so do rules around how they accept and count grades earned at other institutions. UW institutions may start transfer students with a “clean” 0.0 cumulative GPA and exclude grades earned at other institutions. Depending on policies in place, institutions and academic departments may include grades earned at other institutions in their cumulative GPA calculations for transfer students. If you are planning to transfer with less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA, contact the admissions office and the Veterans Certifying Official to check on institutional rules covering grades for transfer students. Remember that if you enroll in classes with less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA you will not use any credits against the Wisconsin GI Bill 128 credit limit and the full amount of your remaining benefit will be available to use in terms when your cumulative GPA returns to 2.0 or higher.\n\nHow does the Wisconsin GI Bill benefit work if I am not eligible but improve my cumulative GPA to 2.0 or better?\n\nBecause cumulative GPA is calculated after a term ends, you will be able to use Wisconsin GI Bill benefits in the first term when your cumulative GPA is established to be 2.0 or better. For example, if your cumulative GPA at the start of a fall term is 1.8 you will not receive tuition and fee remissions for that fall term. However, if your cumulative GPA improves to 2.2 at the end of the fall term you will be eligible to use benefits in the subsequent spring term. In the same manner, if at the end of the spring term your GPA falls from 2.5 to 1.8, your tuition and fee remission is still in effect for the spring term in which your grades fell. The benefit will not be available in subsequent terms however.\n\nWhat is the basic idea underlying cumulative GPA and how is it calculated?\n\nKeeping in mind that transfer students and students granted academic forgiveness may have certain grades excluded from GPA calculations the general quality of a student's work over time can be expressed in terms of the cumulative grade point average (GPA).when grades earned in all terms are added together. The cumulative GPA is the total number of grade points earned divided by the total number of academic credits. The highest possible average is 4.000 or an A in every subject. In general, a letter grade of A equals 4.00 points, a B grade equals 3.00 points, a C grade equals 2.00 points, a D grade equals 1.00 point and an F equals 0.00 points. Below is an example of how a cumulative GPA is calculated for hypothetical Fall and Spring term:\n\nSpouse and Child Benefits\n\nFor the purposes of the WI G.I. Bill, the UW System has chosen to use the definitions outlined in Wis. Stats. §45.01(4), which define a child as “any biological child, any adopted child, any stepchild, or any other child who is a member of the veteran’s household, or any non-marital child if the veteran acknowledges paternity or paternity has been otherwise established.”\n\nThe following documentation in addition to providing your own government issued photo I.D. (driver license, state I.D., passport, etc) demonstrates that a student applicant is a “child” of an eligible veteran.\n\nBiological Child: A copy of the student’s Birth Certificate or similar official documents that identify parentage.\n\nAdopted Child: A copy of the student’s Adoption Certificate.\n\nStepchild: A copy of the student’s Birth Certificate and a Marriage License that demonstrates the eligible veteran has married a biological parent of the student, or a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility for Federal VA benefits that indicates recognition as a stepchild.\n\nOther Child Who is a Member of the Veteran’s Household: A copy of the veteran’s most recent state and federal income taxes where the student is listed as a dependent and the student’s permanent address is the same as the veteran’s household address.\n\nNon-marital Child: A copy of a certificate of paternity.\n\nThe following documentation is required to demonstrate that a student applicant is eligible for WI GI Bill tuition remission as the spouse of an eligible veteran.\n\nThe spouse’s government issued photo I.D. (driver license, state I.D., passport, etc).\n\nA copy of the marriage certificate showing the student’s marriage to the certified veteran.\n\nThe following documentation is required to determine that a student applicant is eligible as an unremarried surviving spouse. These documents will be used to determine the eligibility ending date of WI GI Bill benefits for the unremarried surviving spouse.\n\nA copy of the marriage certificate showing the student’s marriage to the certified veteran.\n\nA copy of the latest federal or state tax return for the unremarried surviving spouse.\n\nA copy of the birth certificate or adoption papers for the youngest child born to or adopted by the unremarried surviving spouse and the certified veteran.\n\nYes. Photocopies are fine.\n\nThe child of an eligible veteran must be at least 17 years old but not yet 26 years old on the first day of instruction as established by the institution, in order to take advantage of the WI G.I. Bill in a particular academic term.\n\nIf the child’s 26th birthday falls on or after the second day of the term, the child would be eligible for the benefit for that term.\n\nNo. Wis. Stats. §36.27(3n) provides 100% remissions to certain spouses, surviving unremarried spouses and children of deceased or disabled veterans, if the student (spouse or child) is a resident student, which means a resident for tuition purposes. Thus, if the student was not a Wisconsin resident or relinquished Wisconsin residency, he or she would no longer be eligible for the benefit, even all of the other qualifications were met.\n\nNew Wisconsin G.I. Bill Benefit Structure as of July 2011\n\nUnderstanding Your Benefits\n\nThe WI GI Bill legislation is complex. Understanding the relationship among state and federal veterans benefits, and knowing which are best for your specific circumstance will require you to be well informed. You are urged to speak directly with the following resource people:\n\nCounty Veterans Service Officer regarding Wisconsin Veterans Benefits programs,\n\nVeterans Administration regarding federal benefits programs, and School Veterans Certifying Officer at your campus (campus contact information)\n\nNOTICE: Changing to the Federal Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefit is an irrevocable decision. We recommend careful consultation with federal, state, and higher education veteran’s benefits staff about any decision to elect the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit."
