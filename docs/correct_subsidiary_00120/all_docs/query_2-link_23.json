        "text": "Linus Williams Ifejika, commonly known as BLord, a Nigerian tech pioneer and cryptocurrency investor, turned down $10 million in funding from overseas investors for his most recent invention, the BillPoint app.\n\nThe founder of the B-Lord Group claimed that he declined the offer since his company anticipated that the app will make far more money than the sum in a few years.\n\nThis information was provided in a statement released by his media office as he outlined how the BillPoint mobile app is reviving modernity.\n\nTo make it simple for people to pay their electricity and cable TV bills, Linus launched the app in April 2023.\n\nAccording to him, “The BillPoint app is here to make transactions easy for Nigerians. It is an unarguable fact that no one walks down to vendors to sort their bills any longer when they can do so online that is one of the more reasons this App will succeed and I am optimistic about the future of the app and its acceptability.”\n\nBLord also said it has generated a lot just within days of its launch and it is proof of how valuable the product is, adding that it’s going to solve problems for many users in the coming.\n\nThe BLord Group is a fintech firm that has diversified into real estate and other industries over time. Their bill payment service, Billpoint, was developed as a reaction to some of the significant problems traditional banks were having with small transactions like subscription payments, power bills, and other recurring utility payments.\n\nWith more than 30 service providers linked to the network, Billpoint offers a secure, simple, and useful way to pay bills online."
