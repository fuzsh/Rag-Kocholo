        "text": "The easiest, fastest bill manager in the App Store. A universal app for Mac, iPhone & iPad and iPad. Use Chronicle Cloud sync to see your bills Mac on all your devices, plus even share them with a partner if you want.\n\nIf you pay bills, you need Chronicle.\n\nHere's why: A single late payment can cost you $30 or more and cause your credit score to plummet by up to 100 points.Â\n\nChronicle reminds you to pay your bills, so you can just enter them once, and never have to worry about them again.\n\nIn addition to reminding you to pay your bills, Chronicle keeps track of all your payment history, including confirmation numbers, so you always have proof of payments.\n\nOn the Mac, the free version allows you to manage up to 5 bills.\n\nChronicle Pro takes things even further. Available as an in-app purchase, Chronicle Pro gives you access to all new features of Chronicle as they are updated, on Mac, iPhone and iPad. It allows you to track an unlimited number of bills, plus much more.\n\nHere's what is currently available features in Chronicle Pro:\n\nForecast View & Amount to Save: See the futureâsee what will be due every month for a year in advance, including how much to save every month for bills that repeat less often.Â For example, you may have an auto insurance bill of $500 that is due every 6 months. Chronicle will calculate that you need to set aside $83.33 each month in order to have enough to pay the bill each time it is due.\n\nIntelligent Estimated Amount Due: Helps you know how much will be due for bills that vary. Using the type of bill, your payment history, and the time of year, Chronicle will intelligently calculate an estimate of how much is due. For example, Chronicle will be able to learn if your electric bills are higher or lower in the winter, and estimate accordingly.\n\nMonthly History & Annual Reports: See your spending month by month, and compare year-over-year spending for each month. On the Mac, you can also see spending for each month.\n\nChronicle Cloud: Backup your bills to the cloud, sync across all your devices, and share with a partner, spouse or business associate.\n\nCustom Repeat Intervals: Custom repeat intervals allow you to manage bills with less common repeat intervals, and even some irregular intervals, like US Estimated Income Tax Schedules.\n\nChronicle Pro is an auto-renewing subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours prior end of the subscription. Payment will be charged to your App Store Account at confirmation of purchase. You may cancel or disable your subscription by going to your App Store Account Settings after purchase.
