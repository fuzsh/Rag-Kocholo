        "text": "Chen was one of the founders of Billpoint, an Internet payments company acquired by eBay in 1999, and has been a private equity investor for the last several years in China.\n\nFor example, eBay enabled various businesses or consumers with e-mail in various countries to send and receive online payments through its acquisition of Billpoint in 1999 and PayPal service in 2002.\n\n(43) Companies that have tried but failed to provide online services for consumer-to-consumer and consumer-to-business payments include Citibank, Yahoo!, and eBay, with their respective products C2it, PayDirect, and BillPoint.\n\nThree of these relate to the acceptable methods of payment by the seller, and are entered as dummy variables: CreditCard, equal to 1 if the seller accepts credit cards directly and 0 otherwise; PersonalCheck, equal to 1 if the seller accepts personal checks and 0 otherwise; and OnlinePayment, equal to 1 if any online payment method (e.g., PayPal, BidPay, Billpoint, C2it) is an acceptable method of payment and 0 otherwise.\n\nAt the same time, eBay was aggressively pushing its own online payment system, called Billpoint. Jackson recounts several episodes in which eBay issued new policies specifically designed to give Billpoint an advantage over PayPal, such as demanding smaller logo sizes from outside vendors or changing auction procedures and settings in ways that transparently favored Billpoint.\n\nSystems like eCash, PayPal, BillPoint, Smart Cards and PowerWallet are being used by various e-commerce companies for online financial transactions.\n\nThe Billpoint payment method - used on eBay alongside PayPal - will now be phased out.\n\nBusinesses specializing in online payment transactions, like PayPal, Billpoint, and Bidpay, are encouraging an increasing number of consumers to pay online.\n\nIn effect, eBay provides the productmanagement and distribution links of the value chain, while the company's specialist partners, such as Billpoint, iShip, Mail Boxes Etc., Tradenable, and UPS, handle direct payment, shipping, and other essential services (Exhibit 2, on the next spread).\n\nThere should also be a variety of payment systems, such as Billpoint, an electronic payment service that eBay makes available, which allows sellers to accept credit cards or electronic checks, or PayPal.\n\nThe net auction giant has acquired Billpoint Inc of Redwood City, California, for its person-to-person credit card payment technology."
