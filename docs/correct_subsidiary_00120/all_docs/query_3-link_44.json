        "text": "A bank account number is a series of numbers (and sometimes letters) thatâs designed to identify an individual bank account and its owner. This way, financial institutions can securely provide access to the account for sending and receiving payments.\n\nIn the past, social security numbers were used for this role. However, the frequency of their use made fraud and identity theft more common.\n\nAs a result, banks have gradually moved away from this practice. While social security numbers are still in use, unique checking account numbers are now used for banking purposes.\n\nHow many digits is an account number?\n\nAn account number usually has eight to 12 digitsâthough some accounts numbers can technically have up to 17.\n\nToday, nearly every financial transaction an individual makes is attached to an account number in one way or another. A bank account number is used to tell the bank what account you want to deposit or withdraw money from.\n\nWhat's a bank account number used for?\n\nA bank account number tells banks from which account to take money or to what account to deposit money.\n\nIn business, a bank account number can be used for a variety of things including:\n\npayments to other businesses\n\ndirect deposits Â\n\nWhatâs the difference between an account number and a routing number?\n\nTo understand the difference between a routing number and an account number, think of a hotel where your money is staying. The routing number is like the address of the hotel, so itâs the same for all the guests staying at that particular hotel.\n\nYour account number, however, is like your room number in the hotel. Yours is different from everyone elseâs, and itâs a more specific way of identifying where a package thatâs addressed to you is meant to go.\n\nYour routing number, also known as ABA routing number or ABA number (American Banks Association), tells financial processing algorithms and humans which bank you come from, and your account number is the specific savings or checking account associated with you.\n\nThis is all designed to ensure that both computer systems and people working at financial institutions are clear on where the money in a transaction is going or coming from.\n\nDoes the account number or routing number go first?\n\nAny basic banking transaction requires both a routing transit number and an account number, whether you're writing a personal check, initiating an electronic payment, or setting up a direct deposit for your paycheck from work.\n\nThe routing number is always first and the account number follows.\n\nLike looking up the address of a hotel, anyone who wants to find the routing number for a specific bank can simply locate it online.\n\nYour account number, however, is a unique identifier that is extremely private and should be carefully protected, just like a social security number or a debit card pin code.\n\nIf someone knows which bank you hold a checking account at, all they would need to initiate a funds transfer from your account into their own is your unique account number. The restâsuch as the bank routing numberâthey could easily find with a quick web search.\n\nIs your debit card number the same as your account number?\n\nThe 16-digit debit card number found on your physical debit card is not the same as your account number. Though they may both be tied to the same account they have different purposes.\n\nThe debit card number comes from and is used by the card's network systems where the account number is unique to the bank and its internal systems.\n\nHow to find your bank account number\n\nIf youâre trying to track down your checking account number, you can search multiple locations for it, depending on whatâs most convenient for you.\n\nYou can find your account number on checks, bank statements, online banking account profiles, and within the bank's mobile app. You can also access it by calling your bank directly to request itâthough youâll have to provide some verification info over the phone first.\n\nWhere is the account number on a check?\n\nFor some, the easiest place to track down a bank account number is at the bottom of a check. In particular, if you open up your checkbook and look at the bottom of your checks, the checking account number is almost always the second set of numbers from the left.\n\nThe first series of numbers is the nine-digit routing number for your bank, which is the same for all people who use that bank. An account number will usually have a pair of bracketing symbols on either side. It typically looks like this:\n\n|:0123456789:|\n\nOn a bank statement\n\nYour account number can also be found on your bank statements. These may be sent to you every month in the mail, or they could be saved online in your online banking account if youâve requested paperless billing. Usually, the account number on a bank statement appears near the very top of the statement. Itâs typically labeled like this:\n\nAccount No. 0123456789\n\nOn your bank's website\n\nIf you have a computer or mobile device handy, you can always navigate to your bankâs website and log in to your account to access your bank account information.\n\nIf you have multiple accounts with the same bank (a checking account and a savings account, for example), youâll usually find their respective account numbers by navigating to the specific account, and then looking for where the account number is listed.\n\nIn your mobile banking app\n\nSimilar to using your bankâs website, you can access your account number through your mobile banking app.\n\nContacting your bank directly\n\nIf all else fails, you can usually contact your bank directly to find out all your important account information. Youâll find the customer service number on the back of your debit card. If you donât have access to your debit or credit card right now, you can do an online search to find your financial institutionâs contact information.\n\nIs an IBAN number the same as an account number?\n\nAn IBAN number is a universally accepted code you can use in addition to your account number to make or receive international payments.\n\nAn IBAN code is different than an account number in that it has different identifiers and does not take the place of your existing account number rather it helps banks overseas identify your account in order to send or receive international payments.\n\nWays to protect your bank account number\n\nWhile security measures have reduced the frequency of fraud and theft over time, bank account numbers are still at risk of being stolen and used for nefarious purposes if account holders arenât careful enough to practice safe online banking.\n\nSomeone in possession of your account number and your password or pin number can access your account and then authorize payments or withdrawals from it.\n\nSecurity measures banks take to protect you\n\nBanks have instituted a range of security measures to help prevent this. They include multi-factor authentication, which is the practice of asking for multiple forms of verification before allowing you to access your account.\n\nIf youâve ever had to enter a one-time pin number thatâs been sent to your phone by your bank, youâve used multi-factor authentication.\n\nOther measures, such as security questions and automatic logouts after long periods between uses, are designed to help keep your account informationâand your moneyâsafe.\n\nHow BILL can protect your account privacy\n\nAnother way to keep your account number safe is by reducing the use of paper checks, which feature your full account number printed on each one."
