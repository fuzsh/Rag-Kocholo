I was unable to complete the payment and sent a check. The next day I saw a $55 charge to my bank account from Bill.com. It's hardly worth chasing this down but there appears no way to connect with Bill.com. I would really hesitate to use this business as they really appear to be unscrupulous. I use Microsoft payment on another account and it's easy and very straightforward. Unlike Bill.com which feels very much like a scam.\n\nDate of experience : July 03, 2024\n\nReply from BILL\n\nThank you for sharing your feedback with us, Ben. We sincerely apologize for the delay you've experienced receiving funds through BILL. We are sorry to hear you had trouble with our bank verification process. We have set up the bank verification process to deliver your funds to the right bank account in a secure manner. We have located your ticket with our team and have updated it with your concerns. Your feedback is valuable to us, and we're always striving to improve our service. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further suggestions.\n\nBeen trying to add new Users and the…\n\nBeen trying to add new Users and the Users have not been able to enroll, which make Bill useless. Customer Support is not helpful and never gets anything resolved. Changing a User's email address is more complex then it needs to be. The number of days before a vendor gets payment takes longer then it needs to.\n\nBill has gone downhill. They need to make improvements with Customer Support and Technoloy or it will end up like Blackberry where the competitors come out with a better product.\n\nLook at other AP products before choosing Bill.Com\n\nDate of experience : April 30, 2024\n\nReply from BILL\n\nThank you for reaching out with feedback on BILL, Steve. Our apologies for the trouble you have had with adding new users, changing user email addresses, payment delays and your customer support experience. We have passed your feedback on to our product team and would like to offer our assistance if it is needed. From this site, we are unable to identify the best way to contact you - making it difficult for us to help you with a solution. To protect your privacy, we will not ask you to post your contact information on this forum. Instead, through Trustpilot, you will receive an email requesting suitable contact information so that we can help provide you with the right assistance in this matter.\n\nOpen issues\n\nThe billing system has made a lot of features addition over the period which has made it easy to use. The interface is user friendly and easy to understand. But we have also seen an increase in the prices over the timeline. Also, we still face issue with vendor payments where multiple currencies are involved. I would love to have this feature. It also has some issues with syncing inventory based purchase orders hence the bill relating to the same need to be created in the ERP system and then synced to Bill.com.\n\nThe feature relating to virtual cards which can be deactivated only when we contact support is another issue.\n\nDate of experience : March 12, 2024\n\nUser friendly and flexible\n\nI use Bill almost every day for multiple clients for years now, and integrate with QuickBooks (Online and Desktop versions). I have found it to be user friendly and flexible, but we only use it for AP and I don't care for Divvy. I like that Bill improves the layout, UI and processing. Definitely makes our payables a breeze, we have lots of approvals, I love that paper copies, paper filing, paper checks are no longer used in our organizations. Much easier for our admins and during audits. I would give this 5 stars if 1) Bill would not try to push products that cost more on us (like Divvy) and 2) the monthly prices for the subscription and the users would be a bit lower.\n\nDate of experience : March 14, 2024\n\nReply from BILL\n\nOur gratitude to you, Christina, for providing valuable feedback! We are thrilled that you use BILL on a regular basis for multiple clients, that it integrates with both QuickBooks, as well that you find it user-friendly and flexible. Also that BILL improves the layout, UI, processing and that it makes your payables a breeze especially with lots of approvals. We appreciate the feedback on our marketing and costs and have passed that on to our team. We always want to hear what works and what will make your experience better.\n\nReply from BILL\n\nThank you, Philip for sharing your feedback on our customer service. We sincerely apologize for the difficulties you experienced during your interaction with us. We strive to provide a seamless and efficient service, and we appreciate your feedback as we work to improve. We understand you had trouble with the Instant Transfer feature that charges 1% fee. This is one of the faster ways to get paid in BILL and its an optional feature that can be turned off from inside your account, if you prefer the standard delivery method. We have located your case internally and someone from our BILL Leadership team will reach out to you soon. Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns.\n\nBill.com is a SCAM\n\nBill.com is a SCAM! It is a horrible company with horrible customer service. In April, I was to receive a payment from a client. It was a smaller invoice, and I could use the money a little quicker, so I chose to have it wired to my bank and pay the 1% fee.\n\nYesterday, I received another payment from a vendor, and BILL.com elected to wire the funds and hold out another 1% fee. However, I DID NOT want this invoice to be paid via wire, as it was a bit more money and the 1% fee was too high.\n\nI explained this to their customer support team, and they told me that when I opted last April to receive the money by wire, it was enabled for all future invoices paid to me to be wired. What a sneaky way to squeeze hard-earned money from consumers.\n\nThey refuse to refund the fee, which I DID NOT authorize, and communicating with their support staff is awful!\n\nI would NOT recommend this company to anyone. Please avoid them at all costs. They will take advantage of you and have all kinds of little quirks to cheat the consumer. HORRIBLE!\n\nUpdate - 7/16/24 - Ignore the kind little replies they post on all of the one-star ratings. I was excited that someone planned to reach out to me and hopeful I could post a positive result. Not at all. I received a call, and that lady was worse than my previous encounters.\n\nI understand now, and buyer BEWARE, if you ask for an invoice to be wired, you are committing to this for ALL future transactions. Unbelievable!\n\nI cannot believe this company is allowed to be in business. Please find a different provider. It is simply AWFUL!\n\nDate of experience : July 10, 2024\n\nWe love Bill.com\n\nWe love Bill.com. We have used it in house as well as for clients for years. We love the approval process as well as the document management system.\n\n2 issues - One is there seems to be hiccups with the app. Sometimes a bill has to be paid online instead of using the app because there is an unknown error.\n\nAlso, I wish there was an easy way to change from the card payment option to direct deposit for a vendor. Once the card option is selected you cannot go in to the vendor payment options and change it to direct deposit.\n\nDate of experience : March 14, 2024\n\nReply from BILL\n\nBre, thank you for providing your feedback on BILL. We understand your frustration and our apologies for difficulties you had while utilizing our instant transfer feature. We genuinely value your feedback and would like to help with your concern. From this site, we are unable to identify the best way to contact you - making it difficult for us to help you with a solution.
