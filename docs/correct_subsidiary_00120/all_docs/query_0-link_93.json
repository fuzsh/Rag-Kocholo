        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- CEO Meg Whitman is battling skepticism over eBay Inc.'s decision to pay at least $2.6 billion for Internet phone provider Skype Technologies SA. Many analysts are questioning both the price tag and the companies' compatibility.\n\nSkype -- founded by the creators of Kazaa, the file-sharing program that riled the music business -- gives away software that lets people talk for free over the Internet using computers and microphones. A paid version, SkypeOut, allows those calls to be connected to regular phones.\n\nSkype's voice capabilities will speed communication between eBay's buyers and sellers and increase the level of trust, Whitman said in announcing Monday's cash-and-stock acquisition.\n\nMoreover, privately held Skype has attracted a broad international following that eBay hopes to leverage, especially in countries where eBay has little or no presence.\n\nBut eBay's buyers and sellers can already communicate via e-mail -- 5 million messages a day are sent -- and some analysts questioned Whitman's claim that voice communication would be welcomed by sellers.\n\n\"EBay is well out of its comfort zone on this one,\" said Forrester Research analyst Maribel Lopez.\n\nMark Main, an analyst with the tech firm Ovum, said that he considered the deal \"far-fetched\" and that eBay had the power to improve its Internet communication abilities much more cheaply.\n\n\"EBay could have developed its own sophisticated messaging and communications platform, or even bought one, for far less money than it is paying for Skype,\" Main said.\n\nWhitman agreed that eBay could have built a similar function.\n\n\"But we believe that when a company is out in front of the competition -- and you have an opportunity to acquire such a company -- it's a great thing to do,\" Whitman said in a phone interview from London.\n\nShe compared Skype to PayPal, the online payment company that eBay bought in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Before buying PayPal, eBay unsuccessfully tried to compete against it with Billpoint, its own payment company.\n\n\"We worked hard to build up Billpoint,\" Whitman said. \"In the end, PayPal had the technology lead, they had already built the ecosystem. Skype is in the same position. It has a global footprint and is already a well-known brand.\"\n\nThe acquisition's total value may climb to $4.1 billion based on whether Skype meets a series of performance targets over the next three years, eBay said.\n\nSkype offers more than a speedy new line of communication, Whitman argued. It can help San Jose, Calif.-based eBay boost transactions that are complex and require significant communication, such as real estate deals, she said.\n\nAnd eBay stands to pocket fees for the calls.\n\nEBay shares rose 32 cents, or 0.8 percent, to close at $38.94 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nAs eBay grew from humble roots into one of the top-performing Internet companies, Whitman earned praise for avoiding deals beyond eBay's core marketplace-based strategy, especially during the late 1990s Internet craze.\n\nThat high level of credibility seemed to factor into whatever positive analyses the Skype deal received.\n\nFor the past year eBay has been on a buying binge.\n\nIn June, EBay acquired comparison shopping and consumer review site Shopping.com Inc. for about $620 million in cash. The other companies eBay has gobbled up are real estate firm Rent.com; India's most popular online shopping site, Baazee.com; and a leading Dutch classified site, Marktplaats.nl.\n\nMeanwhile, low-cost Internet phone providers like Skype are creating upheaval in the telecommunications industry.\n\nThat's because their Voice over Internet Protocol technology, or VoIP, breaks calls into data packets that get routed over the Internet, which is much more efficient and cheaper than the traditional circuit-switched phone system.\n\n\"I'm convinced over time, all voice communication will migrate to the Internet,\" said Niklas Zennstrom, Skype's CEO and co-founder.\n\nSkype has 53 million registered users, including more than 2 million who pay for its premium services. In 2004, Skype generated about $7 million in revenue, which it projects will snowball to $60 million this year.\n\nVoIP usage figures to become more prevalent as broadband penetration deepens, Whitman said. For now, VoIP users in the United States number only about 2.5 million. That pales compared with the 75 million registered U.S. users eBay claims."
