Specifically, this bill: 1)Revises the definition of \"claimant\" to exclude a spouse of the person claiming the base year value transfer property tax relief. Eliminates the requirement that the claimant's spouse, who is a record owner of the replacement dwelling, be considered a \"claimant\" for purposes of determining whether in any future claim filed by the spouse the condition of eligibility has been met. 2)Makes technical, conforming changes to the provisions relating to the base year value transfer eligibility requirements. 3)Applies only to persons who file a claim on or after January 1, 2016, and who have not been previously granted the base year value transfer property tax relief. AB 1378 Page C 4)Takes effect immediately as a tax levy. FISCAL EFFECT: According to the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Board of Equalization (BOE) estimates that the bill would result in a $350,000 annual property tax revenue loss, increasing annually thereafter. Approximately 50% of property tax revenues statewide accrue to schools, which generally offsets state General Fund obligations pursuant to Proposition 98. Consequently, any reduction in the school share of property tax revenues that are attributable to the bill's impact on assessed values would result in a commensurate increase in General Fund costs. BOE indicates that the bill's administrative costs would be minor and absorbable. COMMENTS: 1)The Author's Statement. The author has provided the following statement in support of this bill: \"Assembly Bill 1378 recognizes the evolving nature of marriage relations and living patterns of Californians and expands eligibility for a Proposition 60 [1986]/[Proposition] 90 [1988] transfer to include one transfer per person in a recognized long-term relationship. Assembly Bill 1378 ensures California law recognizes all types of marriages, cohabitations and housing situations.\" AB 1378 Page D 2)Proposition 13 (1978). Much of the law pertaining to property taxation is prescribed by Articles XIII and XIII A (commonly known as \"Proposition 13\") of the California Constitution. Proposition 13 was added to the California Constitution in June 1978 and was most recently amended by Proposition 26 in 2010. Proposition 13 was designed to provide real property tax relief by imposing a set of interlocking limitations upon the assessment and taxing powers of state and local governments.<1> California Constitution Article XIII A, Section 1 states that, as a general rule, the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property may not exceed 1% of the property's full cash value, as adjusted for the lesser of inflation or 2% per year. The term \"full cash value\" means the \"county assessor's valuation of real property as shown on the 1975-1976 tax bill\" or, thereafter, \"the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment\" (emphasis added) [California Constitution, Article XIII A, Sections 1 and 2]. In other words, the California Constitution requires that real property be reassessed to its current fair market value whenever a \"change in ownership\" occurs. The definition of a \"change in ownership\" was not included in Proposition 13, but was left to implementing legislation. 3)Base-Year Value Transfers. California Constitution Article XIIIA contains provisions allowing a homeowner over the age of --------------------------- <1> Since any tax savings resulting from the real property tax limitations provided in Sections 1 and 2 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution could be effectively eliminated through the imposition of additional state and local taxes, Sections 3 and 4 place additional restrictions upon the imposition of any such taxes. See Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization, (1978) 22 Cal.3d 208. AB 1378 Page E 55<2> or a homeowner who is a disabled person<3> a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transfer the base year values in his/her principal residence, within two years from the sale of the original residence, to a replacement home of equal or lesser value within the same county or to a replacement home in counties that have adopted ordinances allowing the transfer<4>, provided certain conditions are met and the county assessor is properly notified. Base year transfers allow homeowners to continue paying property taxes at the amount and rate of growth of their previous homes and prevent reassessments of their newly purchased or constructed homes to full market value. 4)Fifty-Five and Over. California has one of the lowest property taxes in the nation and provides the greatest benefit to property owners, especially those that have lived in their homes for many years. Subject to certain conditions, a homeowner may sell his/her home, buy or build a new one, and transfer the base-year value to a replacement dwelling. Any person claiming the base year value transfer relief is defined as a \"claimant.\" To qualify, the claimant must provide certain information to the assessor, including his/her name and Social Security number as well as the name of Social Security number --------------------------- <2> In 1986, the voters passed Proposition 60 that amended the Constitution to allow a person over the age of 55 to sell a principal residence and transfer its base year value to a replacement principal residence within the same county. <3> In 1990, the voters passed Proposition 110 that amended the Constitution to extend these provisions to any severely and permanently disabled person regardless of age. <4> In 1988, Proposition 90 was passed by the voters. That proposition amended the Constitution to extend the base year value transfer provisions to a replacement residence located in another county on a county-optional basis. AB 1378 Page F of his/her spouse who is also a record owner of the replacement dwelling. Under existing law, a person of any age may make a base year value transfer claim as long as that person resides with a spouse who is over 55 or permanently disabled, even if the spouse is not an owner of record of either the original or replacement property. A spouse who shares title of the newly purchased home with the \"claimant\" is also considered to be a \"claimant.\" Consequently, if \"A\" and \"B\" are married and record owners of property which has received the benefits of the base year transfer value relief, then neither \"A\" nor \"B\" is eligible for a similar benefit in the future.<5> Furthermore, if \"A\" and \"B\" divorce, and \"A\" marries \"C\", C will not be eligible for the base year value transfer relief with respect to C's replacement dwelling if both \"A\" and \"C\" are co-owners of record. The relief will be unavailable to \"C\" because \"A\" would be considered a \"claimant\" for purposes of \"C's\" claim. 5)What is a Problem? The proponents of this bill point out that married people are unfairly penalized when divorced. According to the author, existing law creates a \"marriage penalty\" by disallowing the benefits afforded by Propositions 60 and 90 to a married person whose spouse has already claimed a base year value transfer property tax relief. The author argues that base year value property transfers \"remains one of the few areas of law continuing to make a distinction between domestic partnership and marriage.\" The purpose of this bill is to \"remove tax considerations\" when a couple decides on the type of relationship that \"is best for them.\" 6)Proposed Solution. This bill proposes to stop treating a married couple as one \"claimant\" for purposes of the base year value transfer relief and, instead, grant this property tax relief to every individual regardless of his/her marital status. Practically speaking, this bill would allow a married --------------------------- <5> BOE Annotation 200.0020 \"Claimant (New Spouse)\". AB 1378 Page G couple to transfer their base year value twice, similarly to unmarried co-owners and registered domestic partners. However, this bill would disallow a claim made by a claimant who is under the age of 55, even if the claimant resides with a spouse who meets the age requirement. As noted by the BOE staff, residency by an over-55 spouse will no longer suffice to permit transfer of the base year value. To qualify, the over-55 spouse must file the actual claim and be a recorded owner of both homes. Under current law, a person who is under the age of 55 may be a claimant if he/she resides with a spouse who is over 55 years of age. 7)Statewide Tracking Database. To monitor and enforce the one-time relief, the BOE is required to collect data from counties and maintain a database of base year value transfer claimants and their spouses if names of both spouses appear on the title to the new home. If claimant's spouse subsequently claims another base year value transfer, the BOE database would match the name and the claim will be denied. This bill would allow a married couple to move their base year value twice but only if each spouse makes a claim for the first time after January 1, 2016. Because this bill applies prospectively, a spouse of the person who has already been granted a base year value transfer will not be able to claim a second base year value transfer. GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE: This bill would allow each spouse in a marriage to submit a separate base-year property tax valuation transfer claim. I think this bill is too broad and allows an already generous property tax benefit to be allowed a second time on a larger scale. AB 1378 Page H I do not believe that it would be prudent to authorize legislation such as this that would result in significant long-term costs to the General Fund.
