        "text": "In Denmark Directive 2013/34/EU has been transposed into one Act: The Financial Statements Act. The Financial Statements Act is structured as a building block system with four accounting classes A, B, C, and D with a number of important recognition and measurement simplifications and exemptions for micro-sized and small companies in accounting class B and medium-sized companies in accounting class C. Denmark has a long tradition of exploiting the size limits in the Accounting Directive for micro, small, medium, and large undertakings to the maximum. There is no official standard setter in Denmark, but occasionally the Danish Business Authority issues interpretations and guidelines that clarify the accounting issues that arise in relation to the provisions of the Financial Statements Act. IFRS standards play a decisive role and have strong legitimacy in Denmark for completing the national rules, and even non-listed companies have the option to apply (full) IFRS in the consolidated, individual or both sets of financial statements instead of using the provisions of the Financial Statements Act. The Financial Statements Act clearly demonstrates that the Danish legislators are not opposed to the use of fair values; fair value is often mandatory for financial assets and an optional measurement basis for many other financial and even non-financial assets. Denmark has a progressive attitude to CSR/ESG reporting in the annual report. New provisions have been added to the Financial Statements Act before EU regulations required such information, and whenever the EU has caught up, Denmark has often decided on an expanded scope."
