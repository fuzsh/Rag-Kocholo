Unfortunately is also makes identification of the owner difficult. We prefer if the website does show his true identity.\n\nCloudflare is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) Platform that does not offer web hosting services. It simply offers web performance and security. Additionally, Cloudflare collaborates with IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform, which implies that the three businesses have many well-known clients in common. The Domain Name Service (DNS), one of Cloudflare's most well-known products, integrates security measures like a Web Application Firewall and a DDoS-blocker. Because of the platform's solid reputation, many reliable organizations and platforms, including ScamAdviser, use it; nevertheless, like anything else on the internet, scammers can still exploit its services.\n\nWe diminished the review score of the website as it is using registrar facilities also used by many websites with a low to very low review score. High end domain registration bureaus have an extensive \"Know your customer\" process. This is unattractive for online scammers. It may be bad luck that so many websites with a low trust score reside at this registrar but we reduced the trust rating of the website to be sure.\n\nWe identified an SSL certificate meaning that the data shared between your browser and the website is encrypted and cannot be read by others. SSL certificates are always used by legit and safe websites. Unfortunately scammers increasingly also use SSL certificates so it is no guarantee that you are visiting a reliable website.\n\nAs the influence of the internet rises, so does the prevalence of online scams. There are fraudsters making all kinds of claims to trap victims online - from fake investment opportunities to online stores - and the internet allows them to operate from any part of the world with anonymity. The ability to spot online scams is an important skill to have as the virtual world is increasingly becoming a part of every facet of our lives. The below tips will help you identify the signs which can indicate that a website could be a scam. Common Sense: Too Good To Be True When looking for goods online, a great deal can be very enticing. A Gucci bag or a new iPhone for half the price? Who wouldn’t want to grab such a deal? Scammers know this too and try to take advantage of the fact. If an online deal looks too good to be true, think twice and double-check things. The easiest way to do this is to simply check out the same product at competing websites (that you trust). If the difference in prices is huge, it might be better to double-check the rest of the website. Check Out the Social Media Links Social media is a core part of ecommerce businesses these days and consumers often expect online shops to have a social media presence. Scammers know this and often insert logos of social media sites on their websites. Scratching beneath the surface often reveals this fu\n\nSo the worst has come to pass - you realise you parted with your money too fast, and the site you used was a scam - what now? Well first of all, don’t despair!! If you think you have been scammed, the first port of call when having an issue is to simply ask for a refund. This is the first and easiest step to determine whether you are dealing with a genuine company or scammers. Sadly, getting your money back from a scammer is not as simple as just asking. If you are indeed dealing with scammers, the procedure (and chance) of getting your money back varies depending on the payment method you used. PayPal Debit card/Credit card Bank transfer Wire transfer Google Pay Bitcoin PayPal If you used PayPal, you have a strong chance of getting your money back if you were scammed. On their website, you can file a dispute within 180 calendar days of your purchase. Conditions to file a dispute: The simplest situation is that you ordered from an online store and it has not arrived. In this case this is what PayPal states: \"If your order never shows up and the seller can't provide proof of shipment or delivery, you'll get a full refund. It's that simple.\" The scammer has sent you a completely different item. For example, you ordered a PlayStation 4, but instead received only a Playstation controller.
