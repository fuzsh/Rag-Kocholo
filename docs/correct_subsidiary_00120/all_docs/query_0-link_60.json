        "text": "It used to be so easy. When you sold something and ebay confirmed the payment was sent, it was right there in your Paypal account! But now with ebay handling the payment, even after they've confirmed that payment was sent, you have to wait for them to put it in your checking account. So instead of mailing the item right out, I have to wait until I actually see the money in my account! So I'm wondering, just how long does it take ebay?\n\nI sold an auction yesterday, and ebay confirmed payment was made. But I still don't see it in my account!\n\nDo not wait until you \"see\" the money in your account. You can use those held funds right now to ship through ebay labels. If you don't you will get a ding on your account standing. (just scroll to the bottom of the label page and you can either use paypal or your pending funds to pay for postage)\n\nAlso, since it appears you are a 'new' (in the eyes of ebay) seller, I would be shocked if your sold item is already in the available/payout status....it will probably be 14-30 days or so.....(after delivery confirmation). Just like a standard money request from paypal before, it takes anywhere from 1 day to 5 days (depending on YOUR bank) to transfer to your account.\n\noh...\n\n\"...When you sold something and ebay confirmed the payment was sent, it was right there in your Paypal account!...\"...welcome to the new online selling world...even paypal holds money for \"new\" or infrequent accounts anymore......\n\nIf they can hold it for 30 days, then what is the purpose of ebay? Like I said, before they started managing payment, it would just go into my Paypal account! I could spend it on other auctions! But now I have to wait for the money, and that means the winner has to wait for me to send it.\n\nTrue, I haven't sold anything for awhile, but I did before. And it was fun! But now, it's become a chore!\n\n@tmbz wrote:\n\nIf they can hold it for 30 days, then what is the purpose of ebay? Like I said, before they started managing payment, it would just go into my Paypal account! I could spend it on other auctions! But now I have to wait for the money, and that means the winner has to wait for me to send it.\n\nTrue, I haven't sold anything for awhile, but I did before. And it was fun! But now, it's become a chore!\n\nThe purpose of eBay? To provide a platform for buyers and sellers to conduct business.\n\nWhen eBay owned PayPal (up to 2015) they enforced holds on funds for new/infrequent sellers as well, at least since the late 00's.\n\nPayment holds are more common now because thieving and/or just downright poor sellers are more common that they were 25 years ago when you started. If transactions go south eBay doesn't want to be the one paying to rectify.\n\nManaged Payments doesn't front the money for us as PP did. Perhaps they learned from PP that this wasn't a good idea, perhaps because the Dutch finance officers at Ayden are more cautious than Elon Musk.\n\nThe default is a weekly deposit, but you can opt for daily transfers if you think it worthwhile. Otherwise the transfers will be every Tuesday.\n\nIf you got paid on Tuesday or Wednesday, you will be waiting a week for the transfer. If you got paid on Monday, only about 24 hours.\n\nBut.\n\nWhile the money is transferred as promised, some banks are better than others about accepting the transfers.\n\nSo instead of mailing the item right out, I have to wait until I actually see the money in my account!\n\nOh oh.\n\nThat's an emotional response that is going to cause you trouble.\n\nJust as PP used to Hold payments from time to time, and just as the money we saw in our PP account was actually being fronted to us, we are still expected to ship when the buyer pays, not when we get the money in our bank, or even in our MP account.\n\nUsually having a three or five day \"handling time\" covers us on this, but it can also lead to lost sales.\n\nIt's business not personal.\n\nLook at your records.\n\nAre there any examples of a payment made by a customer that did not get to your bank at all? Do you have any confirmed reason not to expect the money to arrive at some point within a week of customer payment?\n\nthey can hold it for 30 days, then what is the purpose of ebay?\n\nThey hold it because, having been away from selling, your track record is obsolete.\n\nLike I said, before they started managing payment, it would just go into my Paypal account!\n\nBut when you started using PP, your customer's payment was also Held for 30 days, and PP did and does put Holds on selling accounts, usually when they suspect fraud.\n\nFor most of us it was a long time ago, I still remember being annoyed that BillPoint was disappearing back in 2002, and we occasionally see complaints that eBay does not allow personal checks as payment.\n\nMy sale yesterday was the first one this year! I've had other auctions, but no bids. This is my first one since they changed the system. I used to tell watchers that my shipping time was 1 day. But now I have to say 5 days. You told me they put it in my account every Tuesday, so I'll have no problem shipping it. In fact, I'll probably ship it Monday. So it's only 3 days. But thank you for telling me when they send us the money. Now I'll probably send it out the day after I get confirmation!\n\nThank you again."
