        "text": "Ecurrencies have rarely been worth the paper they're not printed on. But with a potent viral marketing gimmick and a dose of dumb luck, PayPal is making person-to-person transactions pay.\n\nOn a sunny spring Friday, a section of parking lot in a Palo Alto office complex is clear of cars, and 170 or so youthful dotcom survivors sit attentively in white plastic folding chairs. It looks like a graduation ceremony. Trees are blooming, birds are chirping, people are squinting. Peter Thiel, their sandy-haired, 33-year-old CEO, takes the podium in a white PayPal T-shirt and faded Levi's. His purpose today is to announce that their company is on track to turn a profit by early fall, a major milestone. After running through revenue and expense numbers for the 18-month-old Internet payments service - the first to let people exchange real money via regular email - he assures his crew that the buffet-lunch budget is secure. Then he takes questions.\n\nA hand shoots up. \"Did you really meet the president?\"\n\nThiel, who recently flew to Washington for a photo op with President Bush and several dozen sympathetic high tech types, acknowledges that he did, in fact, shake W's hand. As an avowed libertarian and coauthor of The Diversity Myth, a stinging critique of multiculturalism at Stanford - a book blurbed by Dinesh D'Souza and Bill Kristol - Thiel has earned the White House equivalent of a backstage pass. Next question.\n\n\"Is the blue-hair thing confirmed?\"\n\nApparently, the boss's offhand pledge to dye his mane if PayPal reaches profitability by August has gotten around. \"I guess I - I will do that,\" Thiel stammers, like a politician called on a regrettable campaign promise. \"We'll do PayPal blue.\"\n\nHe glances down at his chest and ponders the bright cobalt logo. \"Well, we'll do some sort of blue.\"\n\nIt was a rare moment: Peter Thiel doesn't often hedge. A more timid CEO wouldn't have opened shop by offering $10 cash to anyone who signed up for, or persuaded someone else to sign up for, a free, no-obligation, person-to-person direct-payment account. But in late 1999, Thiel and his partner, Max Levchin, did. By March 2000, they were doling out $10 million a month to lure consumers to a business that, if the history of Internet money was any indication, was likely to fail. While banks and brokerages had been dealing in bits for years, no scheme aimed at the general public had ever worked.\n\nRoughly $3.5 billion will flow through PayPal this year, yielding an estimated $80 million to $100 million in revenue. Just over half of the company's customers come from eBay, where a quarter of all auctions settle via PayPal. If eBay CEO Meg Whitman's revenue projections are even half right - she predicts growth from $431 million last year to $3 billion by 2005 - PayPal is sitting in a very sweet spot.\n\nThe attainability of Whitman's goal aside, PayPal's reliance on the auction niche is both risky and limiting. Thiel devotes four days out of five to expanding the company's nonauction business, a payments potpourri currently dominated by retail purchases. PayPal Shops, an online directory of 16,000-plus PayPal-ready vendors, is designed to build on that momentum. To wrest online bill payment from CheckFree, the current leader in that area, PayPal has tapped into MasterCard's conduit to 2,000 telcos, utilities, and other billers. A deal with Intuit to integrate the service into QuickBooks will boost PayPal's profile among small businesses. Thiel's target is ubiquity. \"The two- to three-year goal is to become the de facto online payment standard,\" he says.\n\nToday, PayPal serves 8.5 million customers, a number he expects to swell to 20 million by 2003. After nearly a decade of false starts, electronic money is finally going retail.\n\nWhether PayPal can hold on to its lead is another matter. With trillions in consumer and business payments passing through the US banking system each year, the territory is bound to be fiercely contested. \"There's so much money in it, my god,\" observes 20-year payments veteran Janet Crane. Crane is CEO of Billpoint, a venture between eBay and Wells Fargo, and she's intent on owning auction payments. Citibank's c2it service has been spending heavily for prime real estate on AOL and MSN. Bank of America has teamed up with CheckFree to offer WebPay, which aims to shave days off the lag time in traditional bank transactions. Meanwhile, American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and payment-processing kingpin First Data, whose networks are bypassed in most PayPal transactions, are watching closely.\n\nThiel believes his company could ultimately compete with titans like AmEx, but the prize he has in mind is bigger than a place in the Dow. He hopes to make PayPal a vehicle of geopolitical liberation. \"The ability to move money fluidly and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related,\" he explains. With a PayPal account, anyone on the Net can transfer value with greater anonymity than they could with a Swiss bank account. Hard to tax. Harder to regulate. Nearly impossible to control.\n\nWorld domination remains on the back burner, though, as pressing issues crowd Thiel's agenda. First, there's that promise to turn a profit. Then there's the competition, and regulators in Washington, DC.\n\nA successful epayments operation must conquer three related challenges. First, payment processing is extremely price-competitive; profit margins are measured in fractions of a percentage point. That leads to number two: Making slim margins pay requires a huge number of transactions, which means creating a fast, easy way for customers to get at their money. This raises the third issue: fraud. Seeking the widest possible customer base, many epayments services have opened themselves to the entire Net, only to fall prey to credit card cracking rings from Russia, Bulgaria, Nigeria, Indonesia, and other places inaccessible to the US justice system.\n\n\"There's a trade-off between privacy, security, and convenience,\" Thiel admits. \"You can have any two at 100 percent, but the third will be almost nonexistent.\"\n\nThus, the emoney graveyard was already strewn with headstones when PayPal came along. Services like DigiCash and CyberCash, which launched in the mid- and late '90s with complicated schemes involving encryption-software downloads and electronic certificates, amassed little volume. More recent attempts such as Beenz made it easy to open an account, but their novel currencies - sort of gift certificates, sort of frequent-flier points - proved too hard to get and spend.\n\nPayPal's approach is far less ambitious, and far more effective. PayPal is based on established standards, starting with the popular and time-tested networking device known as the dollar. By providing a Web front end to existing channels for moving money electronically, PayPal extends them into places they didn't previously reach.\n\nUnderstanding how PayPal works requires knowing a bit about the existing payments infrastructure. Credit and debit card transactions flow through separate networks, and merchants pay a fee known as interchange - the aggregate of several small vigs distributed to various intermediaries between buyer and seller, such as the merchant bank, card association, and card issuer - that comes to between 2 and 5 percent. Checking account transactions travel through another network. They cost vendors only pennies but take a few days to clear.\n\n__Unlike earlier emoney schemes, PayPal is based on established standards: the dollar and the existing payments infrastructure. __\n\nPayPal simply acts as an additional intermediary, initiating transactions and sending confirmation notices. The difference - a mere technicality, to a person sending money - is that PayPal pays the interchange. As long as it's low, the company eats the expense. When it becomes significant, PayPal charges the recipient. For small merchants, charities, football pools, dues-collecting treasurers, and so on, PayPal's fees compare favorably to the price of a credit card merchant account, which carries initiation, equipment, and maintenance costs on top of transaction fees.\n\nAll it takes to open a PayPal account is a name, email address, and password. Once you've signed up and furnished a credit, debit, or checking account number, you can send and receive money free of charge.\n\nThe result: viral proliferation. The service's simplicity and low cost attract people seeking payment. They persuade payers to open their own accounts, and when these new users want to receive funds, they, too, ask others to get onboard.\n\nBut the free lunch has limits. After the first $100 in incoming payments from credit card accounts, PayPal charges recipients 2.2 percent plus 30 cents per transaction.\n\nMost customers who do that amount of volume are businesses, and PayPal has a different account structure for them. Businesses accrue fees on all payments they receive, regardless of amount or origin.\n\nThese commercial customers comprise only one-fifth of PayPal's base, yet they receive 90 percent of all payments. That is, person-to-person exchanges are a loss leader. The company's profit, overwhelmingly, is in commercial transactions.\n\nPayPal augments its basic activity with a raft of other features designed to turn the service into what Thiel calls a \"financial OS.\" Balances can be redeemed in the form of a paper check or swept into a bank account or an interest-bearing money market fund. With a PayPal debit card, account holders can withdraw money using any ATM and spend it anywhere that accepts MasterCard (with a 1.5 percent cash-back rebate, no less). A new equity partnership with Providian, the US's sixth-largest credit card issuer, will give PayPal a hand in that business, too. Increasingly, the Palo Alto upstart is becoming a full-service financial institution.\n\nSome would say it's starting to look like a bank.\n\nThe last thing Peter Thiel wants is for government regulation to intrude on his business. There are solid financial reasons - complying with banking laws is expensive - but his philosophical objections are at least as strong.\n\nThiel traces his libertarian leanings to his reading list at San Mateo High School, where Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (wherein the Ring of Power corrupts whomever possesses it) convinced him of the perils of concentrated authority. He won the Northern California high school chess championship before proceeding to Stanford, where he studied 20th-century philosophy and stayed on to earn a law degree. After unhappy stints in NewYork practicing corporate law and trading currency derivatives, he returned to Silicon Valley in 1996 to start a modest venture fund with $3 million in friends-and-family money. In his spare time, he lectured at Stanford on his pet topics, chief among them the relationship between market globalization and political freedom.\n\nIt was at one such talk that Max Levchin, a young cryptographer who had recently alighted in the Valley, introduced himself. Levchin came from Chicago, where he and his family had settled in 1991 after emigrating from Kiev as refugees. He had studied computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he had watched fellow student Marc Andreessen graduate and then conquer the world.\n\nSoft-spoken and darkly handsome, Levchin, 26, takes a seat in the Lira Room, one of several spare conference rooms at PayPal named for a currency. \"I'm nowhere as libertarian as Peter,\" he begins, his eyes on Lira's blue carpet. \"But I'm quite freedom-loving.\" Having lived as a Jew in the Soviet Union, where documents specifying his religion limited his family's opportunities for housing, education, and employment, \"I know what it means to have no privacy,\" he says.\n\nLevchin's ideas - especially his notion to develop crypto software for handheld devices - appealed to Thiel's political sensibility. At first, Thiel offered to fund a startup, but soon proposed that he become Levchin's partner and CEO. The cryptographer accepted. They called the company Fieldlink, and then switched to Confinity because Levchin already owned the domain name.\n\nThe pair quickly discovered a fundamental problem with Palm crypto: no demand. So they came up with an application that required their technology. In its first incarnation, PayPal let handheld users beam money from one unit to another. To enable their customers to deal with people who didn't own handhelds, Thiel and Levchin launched a Web version in October 1999. With venture dollars flowing, they kicked off the $10 giveaway program as a viral marketing campaign in the manner of Hotmail. By year's end, 10,000 people had signed up - a modest success, but at such a small scale, not a viable business.\n\nThen, just after Y2K came and went, the PayPal contagion hit eBay. \"In the good old days,\" reminisces Jeff Johns, a power seller who was among the first on eBay to adopt PayPal in January 2000, \"you could list a cheap item and buyers could basically get it for free because of the sign-up bonus. It was the greatest thing since sliced bread.\"\n\nPreviously, small-time auctioneers who couldn't afford credit card merchant accounts had no choice but to take checks, which were risky and slow, or money orders, which entailed a considerable hassle for customers. Now they could take plastic, get their money immediately, send the merchandise quickly, and pay no more than a low-end transaction fee. Nearly every time a PayPal-affiliated seller closed an auction, the service picked up a new customer, since the buyer could get what amounted to a nifty discount for signing up. Thiel and Levchin took small steps to encourage eBay usage - like developing a form that helped auctioneers track their business - but mainly they just looked on, awestruck at their dumb luck, as the service took off.\n\n\"Between January and March 2000,\" Thiel boasts, \"we grew at 7 to 10 percent a day\" - faster, he says, than ICQ, Napster, or Hotmail at their peaks. He closed a $100 million funding round in March 2000, pulled off a merger with early competitor X.com, cut the sign-up bonus to $5, and watched as new accounts continued to roll in. A pack of me-too services sprang up, both small (ExchangePath, payMe, ProPay) and large (Yahoo! PayDirect, Western Union MoneyZap).\n\nBut success spread PayPal dangerously thin. As 2000 wore on, the company accumulated a backlog of more than 100,000 unanswered emails and became something of a chart-topper at the San Jose Better Business Bureau. Auction winners weren't receiving their stuff and wanted PayPal to make good. PayPal, meanwhile, often knew little more than the putative seller's email address.\n\n__Touting better security, PayPal convinced customers to use checking accounts, not cards. These transactions are 10 times more profitable. __\n\nPayPal finally opened a customer service phone center last year in Omaha, Nebraska, nearly tripling the company's head count with the addition of 430 employees. Slowly, it seems to be working out the bugs. \"From February to April of this year, they've had half the number of complaints,\" reports Sharon D'Amico, chief of the San Jose Better Business Bureau. \"They've been very responsive. It's looking much better.\"\n\nCustomer service woes weren't the only challenge facing PayPal. \"The possibility of fraud has always existed,\" says Tom Arnold, CTO of Cybersource, a software developer specializing in fraud detection. \"But the Internet made it more efficient, and something like PayPal even more so.\"\n\nBefore PayPal, you could use a stolen credit card to make purchases, but to get cash, you had to fence the goods. With PayPal, you could open separate accounts for any number of cracked cards and send money to yourself. Cashing out was as simple as requesting a paper check, which would arrive long before the real cardholder got the bill.\n\nBetter yet, you could automate the process. For a time, offshore fraud rings were acquiring CDs full of stolen credit card numbers and writing scripts that set up a PayPal account for each number. Even if three-quarters of the bad charges were stopped, those that slipped through would amount to a tidy sum.\n\nPayPal wasn't the only victim. Credit card crooks have taken epayments companies for millions of dollars in the past 18 months. \"We didn't have that kind of money to burn,\" says eMoneyMail's Steve Dierenkorn, explaining why the service limited its purview to BankOne customers after less than a year in operation.\n\nBut where competitors threw in the towel, Thiel and Levchin tackled the problem head-on, adroitly turning the payments industry's weakness into a strength.\n\nLevchin knew that a more intrusive sign-up procedure could hobble online thieves, but he also realized it would discourage potential customers. Flush with venture capital and free of ties to Wall Street, PayPal came to regard fraud as something akin to an R&D expense. It reimbursed customers for their losses, learned how the crooks worked, and engineered ingenious fixes.\n\nFor instance, to thwart automated registration schemes, Levchin's team devised a script-proof security question. The site's sign-up pages now prompt users to type an eight-character code word presented in a GIF file - easily legible to the eye, but invisible to code-crawling fraud bots, forcing automated cons to turn their attention on other targets. Today, Levchin claims an overall bilk rate of less than half a percent - far less than the average ecommerce rate (about 2.5 percent) and below the level some PayPal competitors deem \"acceptable.\"\n\nIf the GIF gambit plugged the biggest security hole, PayPal's success in persuading customers to make payments from their checking accounts sealed most of the remaining cracks. Promising a better margin of security, PayPal leads customers willing to supply a checking account number through a more involved sign-up process (which recently became a prerequisite for the $5 bonus). PayPal makes two small deposits, whose amounts the account holder must learn from the bank and report back to the site. If the prospective customer enters the right figures, PayPal can consider the email address a valid ID.\n\nThis strategy has paid off beyond security. Checking account transactions are not only less fraud-prone than card payments, they're far more profitable. A checking account transfer costs only a few cents - but PayPal still collects 2.2 percent on commercial activity. Consequently, its profit margin on these payments, about 2 percent, is nearly 10 times what it reaps on card transactions.\n\nAmong payments pros, the difficulty of getting people to share their checking account numbers is legendary. Yet 40 percent of PayPal payments are drawn from banks accounts. Seventeen percent come from money parked in PayPal accounts, accruing no interchange at all, and the remainder - less than half - from cards. The result is an advantage that rivals will have to work overtime to match.\n\nOff the record, competitors express a subtle contempt for PayPal. They denigrate the quality of its customer service, or suggest that the cash sign-up bonus amounts to cheap trickery (\"anyone could get market share that way\"). Yet, given PayPal's commanding lead, it's hard not to hear these complaints as the sound of grapes going sour.\n\n\"We have a different strategy,\" says Janet Crane, BillPoint's energetic CEO. Clad in lemon yellow and kelly green, she sips a decaf Diet Coke during an early-morning meeting in Billpoint's San Jose offices on the eBay campus. Billpoint, which eBay purchased in May 1999 for roughly $90 million (later selling a minority stake to Wells Fargo), serves eBay almost exclusively. PayPal might be seen as strip-mining the auction site's backyard.\n\n\"Because of our connection with eBay,\" Crane explains, \"we know a lot about our sellers - the amount of business they've done and their feedback profiles.\" She looks down as though envisioning the epayments playing field on the Formica table between us. She sweeps her arms to indicate her point's broad importance. \"That lets us do a number of things, like charge lower fees to our biggest customers and lower the amount of fraud.\" According to PayPal's numbers - Billpoint won't release figures - the eBay subsidiary has been gaining ground. The number of eBay auctions that allowed settlement via Billpoint grew from 20 to 25 percent between April and July 2001; PayPal's presence grew from 64 percent to 68 percent during the same period.\n\nIf onetime ease-of-use is paramount, Billpoint has an edge. Buyers don't open accounts, so they don't have to register. When you win an auction, you simply enter a credit card number. Billpoint routes the payment (minus a fee) to the seller, the seller sends the goods, finito. But Billpoint's expedience sacrifices the ongoing customer relationships that incubate the PayPal virus.\n\nThe similarities between PayPal and Billpoint can make their competition seem like sibling rivalry - two young companies, located just 20 minutes from one another, vying for control over what both consider their home turf. But given PayPal's goal - its need, really - to reach beyond the auction market, Thiel has recently shifted his competitive focus toward the payments industry's grown-ups. After all, the biggest financial company in the US has PayPal in its sights.\n\n__PayPal may act like a bank, but it's not regulated like one. \"No one knows what defines a bank,\" Thiel insists. Regulators aren't so sure. __\n\nIt takes a good deal of coaxing to get c2it COO Antony Jenkins even to mention PayPal by name. It seems as though the head of Citibank's direct-payments play would just as soon banish the California startup to the fifth dimension. Jenkins, wearing a black turtleneck and snakeskin boots, sits in his office on the 38th floor of Queens' only skyscraper, framed by a panoramic view across the East River to Manhattan.\n\n\"People tend to overestimate new technologies' impact on financial services in the short term, and underestimate it in the long term,\" he says in an Oxford-educated English accent. \"We think that's what's going to happen here.\" In other words: We're in the game, we're not going anywhere, and no bootstrapped tech company is going to scare us.\n\nJenkins has little choice but to counsel patience. Nearly a year after launching the pay-anyone-by-email service, he claims 70,000 users, a fraction of PayPal's customer base. \"We've had a deliberate policy of entering the market slowly,\" Jenkins says.\n\nStill, it's too early to count out c2it, if only because Citigroup, Citibank's parent, has the resources to buy presence. Big-time presence. An August 2000 deal with America Online - rumored to have put $100 million in Steve Case's coffers (Jenkins says that number is \"way, way, way off to the high side\") - placed c2it, cobranded QuickCash, front and center in AOL's personal-finance areas. c2it announced a similar deal with MSN in May.\n\n\"The auction space is good, but there are lots of other opportunities,\" says AOL epayments guru Bob Sandler, who views AOL's community features as a powerful springboard. Chat and Instant Messaging clients with integrated QuickCash buttons could carry epayments into the mainstream, with students, as always, leading the way.\n\nc2it's model differs sharply from PayPal's in that it levies its fees on those forking over the cash, rather than those receiving it. \"We thought, typically the sender pays,\" Jenkins says. \"You use a stamp and pay for the check.\" He adds that c2it \"may change that position\" in the future.\n\nThough c2it initially charged more than PayPal or Billpoint, last May it cut its rate to just 1 percent, well below that of its competitors. It's also adding features to match PayPal blow for blow, including a debit card.\n\nThiel, who calls c2it \"one of our most insane competitors,\" says charging senders instead of recipients tops the list of \"everything they've done wrong.\" c2it won't let you make a payment until you've surrendered your Social Security number - a serious breach of privacy and a major tactical error, according to Thiel - and then you have to wait to receive a piece of paper via snail mail before you can make a payment.\n\nSome of those seeming missteps flow from Citibank's very different status before the law. It is, in contrast to PayPal, a bank - officially chartered, federally insured, regularly audited, and legally compelled to comply with a litany of anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer statutes.\n\nAs it stands, PayPal doesn't have to carry that baggage. Despite the fact that, in many ways, PayPal walks like a bank and talks like a bank, it's regulated much less stringently. Although it does insure accounts against \"unauthorized\" withdrawals - through the Travelers, which is, ironically, a Citigroup subsidiary - it does so voluntarily, without the cost or hassle of red tape. Billpoint, too, complies with federal banking regulations, due to its Wells Fargo relationship. Crane calls PayPal's lack of compliance \"unfair.\"\n\nThiel, himself a lawyer, downplays the issue. \"No one knows what defines a bank,\" he says. \"There's no clear standard.\" He characterizes PayPal as a \"payments service\" with features similar to the brokerage and cash-management accounts offered by mutual-fund companies, over which banking regulations don't have jurisdiction.\n\nJames Van Dyke, senior financial services analyst at Jupiter Research, believes PayPal is riding the edge. \"They have a number of banklike attributes,\" he says, \"but I wouldn't say they're a bank.\" Van Dyke thinks the government is playing it smart, letting the epayments market mature before it intervenes. \"PayPal should be more regulated,\" he asserts. \"Just not yet.\"\n\nLawyers at both the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve admit to having PayPal on their radar screens. The definition of banking is a tricky legal question, with statutes varying from state to state. \"If PayPal were found to be acting as a bank without the proper charters,\" confirms a Federal Reserve attorney, \"they could definitely be ordered to shut down.\"\n\nEventually, insiders say, the epayments industry will consolidate into a few players. \"Payments startups often seize a market opening, and financial processors and institutions watch and learn the ropes, and then buy the survivors,\" Crane points out. That's the story of credit cards - introduced by local banks in the 1960s, drawn together in the 1970s - and ATM networks in the 1980s.\n\nConsolidation helps consumers as well as businesses. No one wants to open several accounts when they can have one that serves all their needs. That demand drives dealmaking, and PayPal, with its huge customer base, is in a position to become one of the few companies that make the deals.\n\n__With offshore epayment accounts, people could keep their money where they choose, effectively defunding countries they don't like. __\n\nUntil then, Thiel's focus will be on going global, something he understands he can't do alone. As the stock market was bottoming out in March 2001, he closed on $90 million in new investment from a quartet of foreign banks: the Netherlands' ING-Barings, Spain's BankInter, France's Crédit Agricole, and eBank of Japan. The cash infusion gives PayPal the fuel it needs to break even, possibly by the end of the year, and then go public. Moreover, these new international relationships give PayPal legal expertise, political connections, and physical presence to extend its network to markets whose stricter financial-service licensing standards might otherwise make the going a lot tougher.\n\nAfter work on the evening of his parking-lot speech, Thiel tramps into a Palo Alto restaurant, his PayPal T-shirt still untucked. In the relatively dressy milieu, he comes off like an overgrown 12-year-old, though his adolescent tastes stop at the dining table. After teasing the meat from between the narrow bones of an herb-stuffed rabbit, he finishes his meal with a vintage dessert wine. Then he leans forward to expand on what he calls \"the really megalo version\" of PayPal's potential.\n\n\"Let's say you're in the middle class in Moscow, with a ruble-based bank account and a credit card,\" he says. \"Use the card to make payments to a PayPal account and you've effectively opened an offshore account.\" That's vastly preferable, he suggests, to keeping your wealth in an unstable currency backed by a volatile government.\n\nToday this scenario is theoretical. PayPal doesn't yet do business in Russia. What's more, the economically troubled nations where small offshore accounts might have the greatest appeal tend to have the tightest money-export controls.\n\nHowever, as epayments diffuse the notion that money has a physical location, national governments will find it increasingly difficult to allow citizens access to some parts of the emoney universe, such as credit and debit cards, while cordoning off others, like fluid foreign exchange.\n\nIn a year or two, Thiel says, he'll be ready to test certain legal ambiguities with an eye toward making such obstacles crumble. His logic goes like this: Today, a Muscovite MasterCard holder is allowed to buy a book from Amazon.com; credit card purchases over the Net are legal in Russia, despite the fact that they effectively export local currency to the US. Once PayPal can accept registrations from Russia, a Russian cardholder with a PayPal account will have the ability to bid on an eBay auction and settle electronically, likewise sending rubles westward in a state-sanctioned credit card payment. And if the money were to reside with PayPal before it continued on its way to the auctioneer? The cardholder would have established an untaxed, dollar-dominated haven from the Kremlin.\n\nManaging an offshore emoney account wouldn't even require a PC; PayPal has had a WAP interface since June 2000. Anyone with access to an Internet-enabled phone would be able to move money in ways that confound centralized control. Members of the developing world's growing middle classes would be able to vote with their wallets, stashing money in countries whose economic policies they preferred, effectively defunding governments they didn't like.\n\nThere are reasons to doubt that Thiel will shoulder the legal risks that come with provoking powerful foreign governments. For one thing, he wants to take PayPal public, and public companies tend not to exhibit the same regulation-baiting swagger as private concerns. Whether or not PayPal realizes his vision of liberated capital, though, he has no doubt that it's inevitable.\n\n\"I like to think of us as being at the forefront of financial liberation,\" Thiel says, sipping his wine thoughtfully. \"But if we didn't do it, someone else would.\""
