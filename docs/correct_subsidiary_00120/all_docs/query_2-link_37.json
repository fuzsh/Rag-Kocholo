        "text": "BILL ANALYSIS Ã“ SB 594 Page 1 Date of Hearing: June 25, 2012 ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON UTILITIES AND COMMERCE Steven Bradford, Chair SB 594 (Wolk) - As Amended: May 15, 2012 SENATE VOTE : vote not relevant. SUBJECT : Energy: net energy metering. SUMMARY : Allows an electric utility customer to aggregate their electricity usage on multiple meters for purposes of establishing the maximum project size for renewable generation and fuel cells for purposes of net energy metering (NEM). Specifically, this bill : 1)Allows the electric utility to use the sum of the electric load on multiple electric meters located on property adjacent or contiguous to the property on which the generation facility is located, if those properties are solely owned, leased, or rented by the eligible customer-generator. 2)Allows the customer-generator to use the sum of the load for purposes of establishing the maximum size generation renewable generation to be used for both NEM credits and maximum rebates allowed through the California Solar Initiative (CSI). 3)Allows aggregation of electricity usage of multiple meters for purposes of establishing the maximum project size for fuel cell customer-generation. 4)Prohibits an electric utility customer who uses aggregated NEM from receiving compensation for surplus kilowatt-hours (kWh). EXISTING LAW : 1)Authorizes the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires those rates and charges to be just and reasonable. (451 Public Utilities Code) 2)Requires inclining block rates (known as tiers) on residential customers. An Inclining Block Rate means that customers are charged more for greater electricity usage. As a result, usage in a higher tier is charged a higher price per kWh, SB 594 Page 2 irrespective of the cost of energy or energy services. (739 Public Utilities Code) 3)Establishes nonbypassable charges and recovery of those charges via from customers of investor owned utilities. (848.1 Public Utilities Code) 4)Created the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program to provide affordable service to low-income residential electric and gas customers and provides rate discounts for CARE customers. (739.1 Public Utilities Code) 5)Requires the state's investor owned utilities (IOUs), publicly owned utilities (POUs) (except the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power), and other entities offering retail electric service, to credit all electricity generated by a customer-owned solar or wind system against the customer's usage of electricity, on a kWh basis, a procedure known as \"net energy metering\" (NEM). Participation by all utilities is capped at 5 percent of each utility's aggregate peak electricity demand and the size of individual solar and wind systems is limited to those that will offset all or part of the customer's own electrical requirements to a maximum of 1 megawatt. This program also exempts the customer from paying transmission and distribution costs. This is commonly referred to as full retail NEM. (2827 Public Utilities Code) 6)Permits a customer enrolled in NEM to apply excess kWh accumulated at the end of the 12-month billing cycle to the next 12-month cycle or receive reasonable compensation as determined by the commission. (2827 Public Utilities Code) 7)Permits fuel cell customer-generators to participate in a modified NEM program that allows electricity generation to be credited at the full retail rate against the customer's usage of electricity only. The fuel-cell customer generator pays all non-energy charges. (2827.10 Public Utilities Code) 8)Allows a Renewable Energy Bill Credit Transfer allowing local governments to transfer the excess bill credits related to generation among various accounts for up to 250 MW. (2830 Public Utilities Code) 9)Provides for a standard fixed price contract for sale of electricity to a local utility. (399.20 and 399.23 Public SB 594 Page 3 Utilities Code) FISCAL EFFECT : Unknown COMMENTS : 1)Author's Statement . Customers with multiple meters, for example, farmers with separate meters for each of their irrigation pumps and other functions, are currently required to have separate renewable facilities for each meter to utilize NEM. In some cases, customers are told they are only allowed to have one facility on their premises connected to one meter. Installing multiple facilities, if it is allowed is incredibly costly and inefficient and does not allow the customer to optimize the location of the renewable facility on the property, since the incentive is to join the facility with the largest energy usage. SB 594 removes this obstacle by allowing customers to aggregate all the energy consumed at each of their meters located on the same property as the renewable energy facility, or on their contiguous property, and net that use against the power produced at a single renewable facility. 2)Who pays for NEM. The cost of NEM is paid by ratepayers. The cost of NEM is not paid by utility shareholders (in the case of a publicly owned utility, there are no shareholders, only ratepayers). NEM allows utility customers to avoid paying for the costs of using transmission and distribution infrastructure and maintenance. Those costs are then shifted to the non-NEM customer. In addition, NEM customers are allowed to use excess bill credit to offset their obligation to contribute to public good programs, such as the low-income assistance program, energy efficiency programs, and renewable energy rebates (customers on low-income assistance programs are exempt from paying charges for public goods programs). Because those costs are fixed, if one group of ratepayers doesn't pay their share of these costs, those costs are shifted to the remaining ratepayers. These costs typically comprise 40% to 45% of a customer's bill. 3)Otherwise Applicable Tariff. The value of the NEM credit varies based on the customer's electricity rate schedule (known as a tariff). Each utility has multiple tariffs for various customer types (e.g., residential, residential time of use, multifamily, industrial, small commercial, commercial, SB 594 Page 4 street lights, agricultural, etc.). Each of these tariffs has a variety of rates for a kWh of electricity - as low as $0.08/kWh for a large agricultural customer, to as high as $0.52/kWh for a residential customer (i.e., PG&E E-7 tariff schedule). SB 594 allows a transfer of credits between meters but is not clear if the higher value of the kWh on one meter can be transferred to a meter that is on a different, lower cost kWh tariff. The author may wish to consider an amendment to clarify that the value of the NEM credit can only be applied at a rate equal to the tariff on the meter to which the credit will be applied. 4)Cap on NEM Cost Shift . Since the inception of NEM, the Legislature has limited the total capacity (megawatts) of NEM accounts, based on aggregated peak demand, in order to limit the costs that NEM shifts onto other ratepayers utility bills. The Legislature has periodically raised the cap. In 2010, the Legislature approved a cap on NEM equal to 5% of aggregated peak demand. Recently the PUC decided to define the phrase \"aggregate peak demand\" which resulted in a significant and controversial expansion of the full retail NEM program. The action was contrary to legislative history. Even parties to the proceeding who argued for the new math and expansion of the full retail NEM cap admitted that the calculation was not technically possible until the full installation of Smart Meters (which will not be accomplished in the largest IOU territories until the end of this year at the earliest). To the extent that aggregated NEM increases the use of NEM, non-NEM customers will be further affected by the cost shift. In March 2010, the PUC issued a report which analyzed the impact of NEM. At that point, based on 386 megawatts of installed rooftop solar, the cost to non-NEM ratepayers was estimated at $20 million per year. Installed rooftop solar is now over 1,200 MW so that cost has now at least tripled. However, the PUC NEM report did not fully quantify the NEM cost shift, particularly for grid use and maintenance and public purpose programs offset by NEM customers. Nor did it quantify the cost of interconnection services. SB 594 Page 5 AB 2514 (Bradford, 2012) is pending in the Senate and would require the PUC to study and report on the costs and benefits of NEM by June 2013. When the PUC modified the capacity cap on NEM it also included a provision it would not authorize new NEM after January 1, 2015. The PUC has also initiated a study to examine the costs and benefits of NEM and the impacts of the program for nonparticipating customers. The study will examine the costs and benefits by utility, customer class, and income group and to consider possible revisions to NEM and evaluate alternatives. 5)In addition to the costs shifts described above, SB 594 would impose a new cost for non-NEM ratepayers: the cost of billing services to calculate the credits and reconcile the billing statements for an unknown number of meters located on adjacent and contiguous properties. Opponents to the bill point out that customers eligible for aggregated NEM may have one or more accounts. Reconciling bill credits among various accounts that are potentially on different tariffs imposes an unknown administrative cost on non-NEM customers. The author may wish to consider an amendment to allow the cost of billing services to be charged to aggregated NEM customers. 6)Project Size Cap . Current NEM statute limits the maximum project size to 1 MW and intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer's own electrical requirements. Some of the customers eligible for aggregated NEM may have electrical requirements that are in excess of 1 MW. If aggregated NEM is allowed, it may be necessary to clarify that the customer's own electrical requirements applies to the sum of the demand of all of the meters. Without clarification, some might interpret the 1 MW project cap to apply to each meter. This incorrect interpretation could have the unintended consequence of increasing the maximum project size allowed under NEM. The author may wish to clarify that the maximum project size of 1 MW applies, regardless of the number of meters that are aggregated. 7)Aggregated NEM, also known as \"Wheeling. \" This bill will allow a customer to credit the excess generation from one renewable facility connected to one meter against all other separate meters so that, on paper, the customer receives the benefits associated with renewable generation and the full SB 594 Page 6 retail NEM credit for all metered service. This is also referred to as the wheeling power because the customer's load at the separately metered sites is still fully serviced by the utility but the customer is exempt from charges for that service to the extent that the NEM credit offsets the charges for the services. Currently, NEM customers are limited to offsetting their load at only one meter. To the extent that SB 549 allows customers to use generation at one site to offset demand at another site, this amounts to wheeling. By allowing wheeling, the cost of NEM will increase costs for non-NEM ratepayers to cover the costs of NEM customers using wires and lines. In a PUC decision on Virtual NEM for multifamily buildings, the PUC recognized that customers with multiple meters may have multiple service delivery points that are maintained by the utility. The PUC considered adding a distribution charge for this situation but instead limited Virtual NEM to single Service Delivery Point. Some supporters of this bill suggest that wheeling costs are paid for through demand charges. Demand charges are a method used to pay for the cost of extra equipment needed for a commercial or industrial customer so that power is available during peak demand. Facility-related demand charges are calculated by using the maximum demand that occurs during the billing period, which is the maximum average kilowatt input indicated or recorded by instruments at 15-minute intervals. Time-related charges vary by time period (on-peak, off-peak and super-off-peak). Once the maximum demand is established in each time period, the respective time period's maximum demand is multiplied by the corresponding time-related demand rate. Demand charges can vary based on the customer's interconnection level (secondary, primary, or transmission). Some utility rate schedules include demand charges. Some do not. In addition to demand charges, these customers pay transmission and distribution charges to cover the costs of maintaining the grid. The author may wish to consider an amendment to clarify that customers who receive the aggregate NEM tariff shall pay their proportionate share of grid usage charges for those kWh that are wheeled among the aggregated meters. 8)NEM impacts on Publicly Owned Utilities (POU). The current SB 594 Page 7 statute applies to allow publicly owned utilities in California, with the exception of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. For small POUs, the loss of revenue due to NEM may cause rate increases to non-NEM customers to maintain utility service. A small POU, with fewer ratepayers to spread the costs to, would have to pass on proportionally higher rates than utilities with more customers. In addition, one POU has raised concern that aggregated NEM could have electrical system impacts such as frequency and voltage problems. Managing these problems and keeping systems stable and reliable will require expensive system upgrades that would ultimately be paid for by nonNEM customers. This may also be true in the rural areas served by IOUs. 9)Support for Aggregated NEM. The PUC supports SB 594 because it is \"a helpful way to support the State's achievement of distributed generation-related policy goals.\" The PUC suggests one clarifying amendment to allow parcels that are divided by a street, highway, or public thoroughfare as long as they are otherwise contiguous, and under the same ownership to qualify for aggregated NEM. The PUC suggests also that this bill \"would improve the cost effectiveness of NEM by enabling larger more efficient installations which represent a lower marginal cost to ratepayers.\" It is unclear if NEM aggregation would alter the participation rates in the NEM program between residential and non-residential customers, however on a project for project basis any subsidy would be the same (i.e., combining two 500kW projects into one 1MW project would result in the same amount of subsidy). The School Energy Coalition and the Coalition for Adequate School Housing also supports SB 594 as it addresses an 'inequity because schools and other multi-metered customers may not receive full credit toward their true system-wide electricity use.\" 10)Support and Opposition to Aggregated NEM . Supporters assert that individuals who have multiple meters on their contiguous parcels are precluded from the using the NEM program because the cap on NEM is limited to load serving a single meter. In the specific case of agricultural businesses, who may have large parcels of land and several electric service drops to SB 594 Page 8 serve isolated loads (such as pumps) they argue that this prevents them from combining the loads and installing a single large solar facility. A number of utilities have taken positions in opposition to aggregated NEM. Their opposition centers on several issues raised in this analysis: rate impacts to non-NEM customers, administrative cost borne by non-NEM customers to administer this program; potential impacts on electricity reliability. 11)Summary of proposed amendments . The author may wish to consider the following amendments as discussed in this analysis: Add the following to 2827(4): (C) If an eligible customer-generator chooses to aggregate pursuant to subparagraph (A), the net metering tariff applied to each meter shall be identical to the tariff on the meter pursuant to Section 2827 (h) (2) (A, B, C, as applicable) such that the credit is no more than the otherwise applicable tariff for each kilowatthour that is credited to each meter. (D) Section 2827 (h)(4) shall not take effect until the commission has determined whether or not allowing customer-generators to aggregate their load from multiple meters will result in an increase in expected revenue obligation for customers who are not net energy metering. In making this determination, the commission shall determine if there are any public purposes, or other non-commodity charges that, compared to the net energy metering program that existed prior to enactment, would otherwise be recovered from a customer absent the aggregation under this paragraph, but that the customer would no longer be paying as a result of the aggregation. The commission shall make this determination no later than March 31, 2013. If the commission determines that allowing customer-generators to aggregate their loads from multiple meters will increase any expected revenue obligation from net energy metering, then section 2827 (h)(4) shall be inoperative. (E)For purposes of aggregating pursuant to subparagraph (A), parcels divided by a street, highway or public thoroughfare are considered contiguous as long as they are otherwise contiguous and under the same ownership. (F) For purposes of aggregating pursuant to subparagraph (A), the maximum eligible renewable electrical generation facility SB 594 Page 9 shall have a total capacity of not more than one megawatt. (G) Notwithstanding Section 2827(g), an eligible customer-generator who chooses to aggregate pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall remit to an electric utility providing service charges for the cost of billing services. RELATED LEGISLATION Currently the Legislature is considered several bills related to NEM: AB 2514 (Bradford): requires a study by the PUC to investigate and report on costs and benefits. AB 2165 (Hill): expands the current NEM cap on fuel cell facilities. SB 1473 (Kehoe): places a moratorium on changes to NEM rates. PRIOR LEGISLATION A number of bills to allow aggregated NEM were introduced in prior Legislative Sessions. All of these bills limited aggregated NEM to agricultural customers. AB 594 is the first bill to propose offering aggregated NEM to all customer classes (residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers). None of the bills reached enactment: SB 370 (Blakeslee, 2011) AB 2519 (Arambula, 2010) SB 1512 (Wiggins, 2008) AB 51 (Blakeslee, 2008) AB 1223 (Arambula, 2007) REGISTERED SUPPORT / OPPOSITION : Support AEE Solar, Inc.
