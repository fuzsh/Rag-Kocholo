        "text": "If you have an issue paying with PayPal, contact your seller first to let them know there could be a delay in payment. If the following troubleshooting tips don't resolve the problem, contact PayPal directly to find a solution.\n\n\"PayPal users have a love-hate relationship with the service mostly because of customer service problems,\" she said. \"PayPal has had so many problems with customer service in terms of being difficult to reach, etc. If eBay can put a little muscle behind the service, PayPal users will be pleased, as opposed to being alienated or frustrated by the change.\"\n\nPayPal reported reaching operating profitability before it went public, and last month the company said it expected to report second quarter revenue of $53 million to $54 million, with pro forma earnings per share of 8 cents to 9 cents.\n\nPayPal was originally established by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek in December 1998 as Confinity,[9] a company that developed security software for hand-held devices. Having had no success with that business model, however, it switched its focus to a digital wallet.[10] The first version of the PayPal electronic payments system was launched in 1999.[11]\n\nIn March 2000, Confinity merged with x.com, an online financial services company founded in March 1999 by Elon Musk, Harris Fricker, Christopher Payne, and Ed Ho.[12] Musk was optimistic about the future success of the money transfer business Confinity was developing.[13] Musk and Bill Harris, then-president and CEO of X.com, disagreed about the potential future success of the money transfer business and Harris left the company in May 2000.[14] In October of that year, Musk decided that X.com would terminate its other internet banking operations and focus on payments.[15] That same month, Elon Musk was replaced by Peter Thiel as CEO of X.com,[16] which was renamed PayPal in June 2001 and went public in 2002.[17][18][19] PayPal's IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and generated over $61 million.[20]\n\nShortly after PayPal's IPO, the company was acquired by eBay on October 3, 2002,[21] for $1.5 billion in eBay stock.[15][22][23] More than 70 percent of all eBay auctions accepted PayPal payments, and roughly 1 in 4 closed auction listings were transacted via PayPal.[24] PayPal became the default payment method used by the majority of eBay users, and the service competed with eBay's subsidiary Billpoint, as well as Citibank's c2it, Yahoo!'s PayDirect, and Google Checkout.[13]\n\nIn 2005, PayPal acquired the VeriSign payment solution to provide added security support.[25] In 2007, PayPal announced a partnership with MasterCard, which led to the development and launch of the PayPal Secure Card service, a software that allows customers to make payments on websites that do not accept PayPal directly.[26] By the end of 2007, the company generated $1.8 billion in revenue.[27]\n\nBy 2010, PayPal had over 100 million active user accounts in 190 markets through 25 different currencies.[31] In July 2011, fourteen alleged members of the Anonymous hacktivist group were charged with attempting to disrupt PayPal's operations. The denial of service attacks occurred in December 2010, after PayPal stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks. On 5 December 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges related to the attacks.[32][33]\n\nIn August 2012, the company announced its partnership with Discover Card to allow PayPal payments to be made at any of the seven million stores in the Discover network.[35] By the end of 2012, PayPal's total payment volume processed was US$145 billion.[36] and accounted for 40% of eBay's revenue, amounting to US$1.37 billion in the 3rd quarter of 2012.[37]\n\nIt was announced on September 30, 2014, that eBay would spin off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company, a move demanded in 2013 by activist hedge fund magnate Carl Icahn. The spin-off was completed on July 18, 2015.[43][44][45] Dan Schulman is the current president and CEO, with former eBay CEO John Donahoe serving as chairman.[42] On January 31, 2018, eBay announced that \"After the existing eBay-PayPal agreement ends in 2020, PayPal will remain a payment option for shoppers on eBay, but it won't be prominently featured ahead of debit and credit card options as it is today. PayPal will cease to process card payments for eBay at that time.\" The company will \"instead begin working with Amsterdam-based Adyen\".[46]\n\nThe fiscal year for Paypal is from January 1 to December 31. For fiscal year 2019, Paypal reported earnings of US$2.459 billion, with an annual revenue of $17.772 billion, an increase of 15% over the previous fiscal cycle. PayPal's shares traded at over $108 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over $127.58 billion in December 2019.[94][95]\n\nThe PayPal app is available online or at the iTunes App Store and Google Play. One year after acquiring Braintree, PayPal introduced its \"One Touch\" service, which allows users to pay with a one-touch option on participating merchants websites or apps.[108]\n\nIn 2007, PayPal acquired the online credit product Bill Me Later, Inc.,[109] which has since been rebranded as PayPal Credit and provided services for Comenity Capital Bank, the lender of PayPal Credit accounts. Founded in 2000, Bill Me Later is headquartered in Timonium, Maryland.[110] PayPal Credit offers shoppers access to an instant online revolving line of credit at thousands of vendors that accept PayPal, subject to credit approval. PayPal Credit allows consumers to shop online in much the same way as they would with a traditional credit card. The rebranding of Bill Me Later as PayPal Credit also means that consumers can use PayPal Credit to fund transactions virtually anywhere PayPal is accepted.[111] In 2015 PayPal agreed that PayPal Credit would pay a $25 million fine to settle a complaint filed in Federal Court by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[112]\n\nIn the first phase, payment volumes were coming mostly from the eBay auction website. The system was very attractive to auction sellers, most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards, and for consumers as well. In fact, many sellers could not qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.[123]\n\nUntil 2000, PayPal's strategy was to earn interest on funds in PayPal accounts. However, most recipients of PayPal credits withdrew funds immediately. Also, many senders funded their payments using credit cards, which cost PayPal roughly 2% of payment value per transaction.[citation needed]\n\nTo solve this problem, PayPal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts. Instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds, PayPal started relying on earnings from service charges. They offered seller protection to PayPal account holders, provided that they comply with reimbursement policies. For example, PayPal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over $750.[citation needed]\n\nAs of March 2011, PayPal has made changes to the User Agreement for Indian users to comply with Reserve Bank of India regulations.[127] The per transaction limit had been set to USD $3,000, since October 14, 2011. However, on July 29, 2013, PayPal increased the per transaction limit to USD $10,000.[128] This brings the per transaction limit for India in line with the restrictions imposed by PayPal in most other countries.\n\nOn 8 November 2017, PayPal launched domestic operations under PayPal Payments Private Limited and now provides digital payment solutions for merchants and customers in India.[131] As of 2020, Paypal supports the domestic card system RuPay and is planning to further integrate Unified Payment Interface (UPI) in collaboration with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).[132] PayPal now has the largest global engineering team in India outside of the US, which is spread over Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.[133]\n\nEight years after the company first started operating in the country, Paypal ceased operations in Turkey on 6 June 2016 when Turkish financial regulator BDDK denied it a payment license. The regulators had demanded that PayPal's data centers be located inside Turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue. PayPal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in Turkey.[141][142]\n\nIn 30 July 2022, Kominfo blocked PayPal due PSE regulation. Many PayPal users in Indonesia are concerned, as some of them stored lot of their money in this platform.[148] The service had been temporarily unblocked for 5 days for users to withdraw their money from the platform.[149] The main reason is that PayPal have yet to get a permit from Bank Indonesia and Otoritas Jasa keuangan.[150] PayPal had been unblocked in 3 August 2022 after registering.[151]\n\nIn the United States, PayPal is licensed as a money transmitter, on a state-by-state basis.[162][163] But state laws vary, as do their definitions of banks, narrow banks, money services businesses, and money transmitters. Although PayPal is not classified as a bank, the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry, including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act.[164] The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from peer-to-peer (P2P) payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. ÂÂ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution, and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges.[165] Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. ÂÂ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.[165]\n\n38c6e68cf9"
