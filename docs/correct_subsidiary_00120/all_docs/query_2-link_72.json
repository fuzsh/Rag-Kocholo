        "text": "Billing Cycles\n\nWater and Sewer bills are sent out quarterly around the first week in January, April, July, and October. Utility bills are due within 20 days of the billing date.\n\nGermantown Utilities crew members collect usage data from your water meter with an automatic meter reading (AMR) device. Our data collection devices read your meter from a distance and store that information in a format that is then downloaded into our billing software to help produce your quarterly billing statement.\n\nIn some cases or during certain times of year when we are not able to get close enough to your meter, our data collection devices are not able to communicate with your meter to deliver consumption data. In that event, we provide you with an estimated billing statement, based on your normal usage history for that time of year. Any difference between the amount actually used and the estimated amount billed is corrected automatically when the next regular meter reading is obtained. Ultimately, you pay only for the amount of water actually used.\n\nGermantown calculates the volume charges per 1,000 gallons used.\n\nHave You Recently Purchased/Sold a Home/Condo in Germantown?\n\nIf you have recently closed on a property in Germantown, please contact the Utility Department at 262-250-4703, to update your utility billing information and, if applicable, cancel any future AUTOPAY instructions. This simple step will ensure utility invoicing is sent to the correct property owner/tenant.\n\nBilling Inserts for the Current Utility Invoice:\n\nUtility Bill Backer(Rates and Information)\n\nUtility Billing Updates (Additional Information)\n\nGermantown News\n\nCommunity Library News\n\nParks & Rec News\n\nRates & Fees\n\nCurrent Water & Sewer Rates\n\nView our Historical Rates here.\n\nLate Fees: 1% per month Returned Check Fee: $20\n\nNot receiving your utility bill does not eliminate the late fee penalty. If you do not receive your bill within five (5) days of when it is normally delivered, please call our office at 262-250-4703.\n\nPayment Options\n\nUtility Bills can be paid:\n\nAutomatic Payment Plan: Register online in the Citizen Self Service Portal or click HERE to complete and mail in the form with a voided check or letter from your financial institution. To complete the form and submit online, please click HERE.\n\nOnline through the Citizen Self Service Portal.\n\nBeginning with the 3rd quarter utility bill, online payments should be made through the Citizen Self Service Portal. The Village no longer accepts utility bill payments via Doculivery or Point & Pay.\n\nYou can also pay your utility bill through your personal online banking.\n\nFor instructions on how to sign up with the Citizen Self Service Portal please click here\n\nTo access the Citizen Self Service Portal please click the link below:\n\nCITIZEN SELF SERVICE PORTAL\n\nBy Mail:\n\nVillage of Germantown\n\nP.O. Box 337\n\nGermantown, WI 53022\n\nDrop Box: Village Hall (see above), located next to front doors under clock tower\n\nIn Person at Village Hall (during normal business hours):\n\nN112 W17001 Mequon Road\n\nGermantown, WI 53022\n\nWe accept cash, checks (made payable to Village of Germantown), or credit cards (VISA, MasterCard or Discover).\n\nSummer Sewer Credit - Pool Fills/Lawn Irrigation\n\nWater used for watering the lawn, trees, flowers, car washing, filling pools, etc., does not normally enter the sewer system, accordingly, it is considered appropriate and reasonable to make certain allowances for these non-sewage volumes. As a result, the Village Board has expanded the Summer Sewer Credit to include the 2nd quarter billing cycle.\n\nWith the Village’s implementation of the Summer Sewer Credit now covering BOTH the 2nd and 3rd quarter billing cycles, the Village no longer processes additional credits during the 2nd and 3rd quarters for pool fills (or top offs), or sodding or seeding a new lawn at an existing residence.\n\nThis broader/automatic ‘summer’ billing adjustment provides residential customers with a discount on sewer charges; and will alleviate the need to call in for additional non-sewage volume adjustments.\n\nSewer credits may be requested for pool fills (or top offs), or lawn irrigation at an existing residence, if performed outside of the 2nd and 3rd quarters meter readings [approximately mid-September through mid-March.]\n\nIn order to receive a credit during this off-season, residents are asked to take a picture of the meter reading immediately before and immediately after usage; and email those pictures, along with the following information, to the Utility Clerk:\n\nPlease provide: your full name, address, phone number, utility account number, date of water usage, before/after meter readings, along with pictures of the readings.\n\nCredits will no longer be processed without a before and after meter read and photographic evidence.\n\nOne credit per quarter will be considered."
