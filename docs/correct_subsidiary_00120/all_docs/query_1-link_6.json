        "text": "Technology and user demand are driving payment systems in new directions at an extraordinary rate. Recognition of the systemic implications of payment mechanisms and the systems that provide them are resulting in new regulatory requirements and establishing new standards for payment systems to meet. Existing systems are being rebuilt and improved to meet international principles of stability and robustness, while new market participants and new systems are offering functionality never before available to users and consumers.\n\nS&C remains at the forefront of payment systems developments, representing banks, financial services companies, entrepreneurs, industry groups, and others in developing, establishing, analyzing, buying and selling, and improving payment systems and payment systems operators, as well as in the full range of related regulatory issues. S&C has also worked with a number of payment systems and other designated financial market utilities to address the requirements of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, and to respond to developments in the regulatory and insolvency statutes applicable to the systems’ members.\n\nS&C’s corporate, regulatory, M&A, financial crime, insolvency, intellectual property and other practices work together to provide a full range of services to both established and new payment systems operators."
