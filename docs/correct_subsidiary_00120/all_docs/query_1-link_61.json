        "text": "[Congressional Record Volume 140, Number 124 (Thursday, August 25, 1994)] [House] [Page H] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Printing Office [www.gpo.gov] [Congressional Record: August 25, 1994] From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] VIOLENT CRIME CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1994--CONFERENCE REPORT The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are coming down to the wire here today on this particular conference report. One way or the other, we are going to resolve it. I think we should. I think we have debated it enough. But I have been absolutely astounded to find out that last week the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys--the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys--who took the brave and unprecedented stand of opposing certain aspects of this crime bill are now being threatened by politicians in the Justice Department. (Mr. REID assumed the chair.) Mr. HATCH. This organization of the assistant United States attorneys, the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, represents the nearly 4,000 Federal prosecutors who have to prosecute Federal violent crimes. Nobody is on the front lines more than these 4,000 prosecutors. They are Democrats, Republicans, independents, and are nonpolitical. They prosecute the Federal violent crimes, the Federal drug cases, and white-collar crime cases, among others. They have the guts, as an organization, to express their opposition to this conference report's mandatory minimum--I should say, to the original conference report's minimum repeal proposal and this conference mandatory minimum repeal proposal in this bill. They had the guts to stand up and speak out, as they should have, in helping us to know what to do to arrive at the appropriate posture legislatively on this bill. It has come to my attention that some of these prosecutors on the board of the association have been threatened with political reprisals. Worse yet, they have been reportedly threatened with criminal prosecution under 18 United States Code, Section 205, the Federal conflict of interest section. I believe that this is the correct section. How dare the political cronies of the Clinton administration abuse the prosecutorial powers of the Justice Department for political gain so they can get their way on this bill. How dare they subject their own prosecutors to this sort of blackmail. How dare they. I am standing here and I am sending a warning to this administration: I will be watching them regardless of what happens to this bill. If they take any action against these brave men and women who took a position on principle, not politics, and in the interest of justice, there is going to be a sorry day of reckoning for them if it takes every fiber of my being to get us there. When I heard that this morning, I was absolutely outraged. It shows the lengths to which they would go to get this--I want to be nice about it--so-called crime bill through both Houses of Congress. They have a tremendous majority in the House of Representatives, a tremendous majority in the Senate, and they are having some trouble getting their way. So they play this kind of political games and chicanery. There are a lot of us who are just plain sick of trying to stop this gravy-sucking hog called the Federal Government and its liberal friends from eating us alive. It is a Federal hog. And some think that the only issue in this bill happens to be the money issues. Those are important, but there are real issues, in addition to the soft language against crime throughout this bill. The amendments that we have called for would not only take the $5 billion away from the gravy-sucking hog called the Federal Government in this instance. They are sucking the taxpayers dry while this Government gets fatter and fatter, and the people get poorer and poorer, and this country gets worse off. In addition to that, we want to tighten that present language, because it allows them to do almost anything they want to with the money as long as they call it prevention. I would like to say that this happens to do a lot with the pork in this bill. There are $11 billion in discretionary grants in this bill, and that has to do with pork as well. The Simpson amendment to expedite criminal alien deportation, it seems to me, is critical to this country. What are the people in California going to do if they just indict and convict these criminal aliens, and they get out, and because the Immigration and Naturalization Service is so doggone busy and oppressed and so underfunded, they cannot keep track of them, and they go right out on the street and commit more crimes? This amendment would solve that for California and Arizona and Texas and Florida--you name any of those States where they have this problem. It is one of the few chances to solve the immigration problem in this society, and amazingly the Democrats in the House took it out. We want to put it back in. What that means is that once a criminal alien is sentenced, the judge can immediately issue an order for deportation to throw that person out of this country the minute they have served their time, so they do not mess up our country anymore, so they cannot just go out and go into the streets and do the same thing they did before this happened. How could anybody be against that? Yet, my colleagues on the other side do not want that amendment. Why? Because they are going to lose on it. If they do not lose, they know darn well the American people are going to hold them responsible for it. I would think that our Congresspeople and Senators from these States would fight their guts out to have that amendment in this bill, which is the opportunity I would like to give them. Mandatory minimum penalties for use of a gun. How could anybody be against that, if you are really serious about doing something about gun crimes in our society? How about the mandatory minimum penalties for selling drugs to minors? How in the world can you be against that if we are serious about helping our kids and our society? I hear all this talk about prevention being the answer. Well, I agree. We have 266 programs in existence right now on prevention--without this bill. Why can we not do something on mandatory minimum penalties for anybody who sells drugs to our kids? Why? Who would fight against that? Well, I have to tell you, the offer that the majority has sent back to us fights against these amendments. How about mandatory minimum penalties for employing minors to sell drugs? Who could be against that? But their offer back to us is only to have one vote on the pork and that is it. That does not cover all of the pork. That only covers $5 billion of it. It does not cover all of the discretionary grants in this bill and the poor language and the weak-on-crime language that is in this bill. We are trying to put some tough-on-crime language in this bill, but they do not want to vote on these matters. Why? Because we might win on them. There are enough Democrats over here who voted with us when the programs were in the Senate bill then before. In fact, we were instructed by the Senate-- Senator Biden and I--to keep them in the conference report. Somewhere along the way, although I fought very hard for them, they were taken out in the back rooms of the conference committee. Of course, I was not there in the back rooms. I was waiting for them to come out of the back room so I could see what we were going to have to eat. One program the conference dropped is mandatory minimums. One of our amendments is to restore this program. We want the tougher Senate mandatory minimum language in the final language. Furthermore, we are willing for first-time offenders, who really have not used guns, have not sold guns, and have not had a gun in their schools, and other types of injustices like that, not have mandatory minimum penalties apply to them. I was the author of that. I am a conservative, but I also see where there is some injustice for these first-time offenders. What about the Mafia drug lord whose action resulted in the death and killing of hundreds of thousands of our people? What about that Mafia drug lord? That Mafia drug lord, I might add, under the Democrat language of the conference report, because this may be his or her first conviction, is not subject to mandatory minimum penalties. Put back the mandatory minimum language so as to affect the Mafia drug lord. That is what these folks over here do not want to vote on. Why? Because maybe they can beat us on it, but I do not think they can, because they are going to lose. If they lose, this bill will become much tougher and, I think, would have much more support, certainly from our side. But the other aspect of that particular amendment is that the Federal prosecutors, these assistant U.S. attorneys from this National Association of United States Attorneys, had the guts to come forth during the House deliberations last weekend and make it clear that they support the Senate language rather than the House language or this conference report language. Now, there are those who are threatening them politically, threatening them with reprisals for having done that. That is the way this game has been played throughout. I hate to see it. I cannot understand why the left in this country wants this bill so badly that they are willing to even trample upon the rights of the Federal prosecutors in the process and do it politically. I am sure they did not want anybody to ever find out about this, but this outraged some of the prosecutors so badly they are willing to stand up and say, ``We are sick of it ourselves.'' I have had more than one of them say, ``We think it is a lousy crime bill in its current form and it ought to be defeated.'' We have an offer back from the Democrats, from the majority leader, that will allow one vote, one vote on the pork barrel aspects, as we have called them, the $5 billion, although, remember, there is a lot of other pork in this soft language. But they will allow one vote. The problem is that the rest of the pork will not be affected. It will not come out. We all know that. Then the remaining amendments, which would tighten this bill and make it a tough anticrime bill, at least more than it is, they are unwilling to face. I suspect they are unwilling to face it because we would win on most of them because we won on them before. Mr. President, I am really concerned. When it gets this tough, when prosecutors are tramped on and treated like this for political purposes, it ought to tell everybody in America what is happening here. I would like someone from the other side to tell me why these other amendments are so bad, why we should not tighten the prison language, why we should not have an amendment to deport criminal aliens? Why should we have to support them? Why should we have them committing crimes in our country? Why should we not, once they have served their time, get them out of our country? Do you know what that means to California? Do you know what that means to Arizona? Do you know what that means to Florida and each State in this Union, to be honest with you? Right now we do not have that law. Mandatory minimum for gun sentences--how can anybody be against it? But they are. How about a mandatory minimum for selling drugs to minors? How could anybody be against those? And mandatory minimum penalties for those who employ minors to sell drugs? I do not know how the point of order is going to go. I can say this: If the point of order is sustained, these will be the amendments that we would offer. These would be the only amendments, and we would deliver our side on this issue if the point of order is sustained. There will not be any other amendments. It will be the deal that we sent over there yesterday: One final cloture vote, which they know they will win, and final passage on the bill ultimately once the House acts on the concurrent resolution. But we will guarantee that these are the only amendments that we will call up, win or lose on, if we win on the point of order. If we lose, then it is over, and we understand that, and we will accept it. But we will not feel good about it. Let me just go through that one more time so my colleagues understand why I am so worked up this morning. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a comment? Mr. HATCH. Yes. Mr. BIDEN. I listened to every single word the Senator said on television and here. I understand why he says he is worked up. Mr. HATCH. I am worked up about it. Mr. BIDEN. There is no need to repeat unless the Senator would like to repeat it. Mr. McCAIN. Coming from someone who never talks less than 2 hours, that is a very interesting comment. Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague--he is such a generous man--for his pointing that out. Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield without losing my right to the floor. First, let me just say this, that I personally enjoyed listening to my colleague because he is knowledgeable on this bill and I have respect for him. We worked hard together on many aspects of this bill. Mr. BIDEN. Yes. Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this: The discretionary spending in this bill on the prevention side happens to be $1 billion for the drug courts, $625 million for the model intensive grants, $245 million for the family and community endeavor schools, the faceless part of the school, $271 million for the community economic partnerships, which, of course, is going to allow community development corporations to spend this money to improve the communities. By the way, there is a lot of money being spent on that right now. In fact, a lot of these programs are very good programs. There is $91 million for the ounce-of-prevention grants, $50 million for the community-based justice grants, $24 million for community--not police recruitment, not the police department recruitment of their own police officers--but community efforts to recruit police. I wonder why the police department cannot do that. There is $35 million for delinquent and at-risk youth. Keep in mind there are 266 programs and more than $3 billion already being used for that. You have gang resistance education and training grants, the GREAT Program, $22.5 million. That subtotal comes to $2,363,500,000. Now on the law enforcement side, here is where the discretionary grants are there. You have community policing, $6.6 billion, contained in very broad language, very broad language, indeed. You have prison grants, $710 million. Again, no real definitive direction on how to spend the money; it is encompassed in very broad language, which we would like to tighten up. It is pork as far as we are concerned if the language is not tightened up. But that will not be solved by the $5 billion of pork. It will be solved by the extra amendments to tighten up the language. And there is a total of $7.3 billion just in the pork we could control by tightening up the language and making it go for the purpose all of us thought it was going for. There is $1.8 billion for alien incarceration, but, of course, no alien deportation is proffered. We are going to pay to keep them in our prisons, but we are not going to allow the judge to issue a deportation order. There is $150 million for Federal assistance to State courts. That comes to a total of $9.260 billion of just general grant money. And if you add that to the $2,363,500,000, you are talking about $11.623 billion in discretionary grants. Now, this, of course, is based on an analysis by the Senate Budget Committee. We would like to solve some of those problems. And we could cover, in some of these grants, an awful lot of that and make it go for better purposes. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to. Order of Procedure Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I inquire whether or not our Republican colleagues are ready to proceed to bring this matter to a conclusion in the following manner: I have proposed an agreement this morning, which my colleague from Utah has rejected. I propose, as soon as the distinguished Republican leader comes to the floor--which we were advised sometime ago would be momentarily--that I present the unanimous-consent request which is the language identical to that presented to me by the distinguished Republican leader, the change being in the amendment, as the Senator from Utah suggested. I understand that will be objected to. Following that, I understand Senator Domenici will be recognized to make the point of order. Following that, I would seek recognition to make the motion to waive the point of order and then the Senate, having debated this matter now for 4 days, I believe it appropriate to vote on it, to bring it to a conclusion one way or the other, vote on the point of order. If the point of order is sustained, why, then, of course, unless later reversed, the conference report would be defeated. If the point of order is not sustained, I would hope we could proceed to complete action on the bill. In either event--either that the point of order is sustained or we complete action on the bill--I would hope we could do it promptly. And it would be my intention then to have the Senate adjourn until after Labor Day. So my question is--I directed it originally to the Senator from Utah; I notice the distinguished Republican leader is present, so I would direct it to him--if we can proceed on this in the manner as suggested and bring this matter to a conclusion one way or the other? Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, do I still have the floor? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor. Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for these purposes between the two leaders. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yielding to whom? Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for a discussion between the two leaders, without losing my right to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DOLE. I would like to work it out that the two leaders would have a discussion and then Senator Hatch could be recognized. Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the two leaders be recognized, with the floor coming back to me later. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MITCHELL. Is the Senator prepared for me to put the request? Might I ask, is this procedure acceptable, to put the request, it would be objected to, and Senator Domenici or some other Senator would be recognized to make the point of order, and I would be recognized to make the motion to waive? Mr. DOLE. Yes. Mr. MITCHELL. That is agreeable. Unanimous-Consent Request Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, as Senator Hatch has previously explained, the document I will now read is a proposed agreement, entitled ``Crime Consent Agreement,'' which was prepared by Senator Dole and presented to me yesterday. The terms of the agreement are unchanged and identical to the form in which it was presented to me; indeed, this is the original document itself. The document was accompanied by a list of 10 amendments, the first 4 of which related to so-called spending in the bill. The change that is made with respect to our offer is to consolidate the first four amendments on the list we received into a single amendment regarding spending, and that would be the only amendment under this proposal which Senator Hatch has indicated is not acceptable. Therefore, Mr. President, understanding that there will be objection: I ask unanimous consent that the pending crime conference be laid aside. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to a Senate Concurrent Resolution that would correct the enrollment of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3355, and that it be considered under the following agreement: (With all amendments limited to 1 hour, equally divided). The document then says, ``Read list of amendments,'' but I will simply send the amendment list to the desk, as I have described. I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above mentioned amendments, if any amendments are agreed to, the conference report be placed back on the Calendar and it not be in order in the Senate to consider that conference until the House has adopted the Senate concurrent resolution, as amended, if amended. I further ask unanimous consent that if all the amendments mentioned above are defeated or tabled, then the Senate proceed to a vote on cloture on the conference report, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, with 2 hours equally divided between the two leaders prior to the cloture vote, and that if cloture is invoked, the Senate proceed to an immediate vote on adoption of the conference report. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that if the House agrees to the Senate concurrent resolution as amended, then it be in order for the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, proceed to the crime conference report. I believe the word ``to'' should be inserted in there, so I insert the word ``to'' proceed. And there then be 2 hours for debate, to be followed by a cloture vote on the conference report, and if cloture is invoked, the Senate proceed to adoption of the conference report, without any intervening action or debate. I send the list of amendments to the desk. The list of amendments follows: There being no objection, the list of amendments was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: List of Amendments One amendment striking approximately $5 billion in ``social spending'' from the conference report, as follows: Strike Local Partnership Act (Title III, Subtitle J). Strike Model Intensive Grants (Title III, Subtitle C). Strike: Local Crime Prevention Block Grants (Title III, Subtitle B); Family and Community Endeavor Schools (Title III, Subtitle D, section 30402); Community-Based Justice Grants (Title III, Subtitle Q); Urban Recreation (Title III, Subtitle O); At-Risk Youth (Title III, Subtitle G); Police Recruitment (Title III, Subtitle H). Strike: National Community Economic Partnership (Title III, Subtitle K); Community Schools (Title III, Subtitle D. section 30401); Ounce of Prevention (Title III, Subtitle A); Family Unity Demonstration Project (Title III, Subtitle S, chapter 2); Gang Resistance Education and Training (Title III, Subtitle X); Drug Courts (Title V). The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent request. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I was not on the floor earlier, but the Senator from Utah may have already made the distinction. We suggested 10 amendments. We get back one amendment and we are told this is something that ought to be acceptable. We had four amendments on spending. They lumped it together in one, and then the other six amendments that we think are fairly important, like expediting criminal alien deportation, mandatory minimum penalties for gun crimes, mandatory minimum penalties for selling drugs to minors, mandatory minimum penalties for employing minors to sell drugs, tightening up truth-in-sentencing, and making certain money is going to be spent for prisons. We believe that notwithstanding the fact that these amendments passed the Senate at an earlier time, over 30-some amendments, according to the Senator from Utah, were dropped in the conference. And further, with the reservation I assume that it is easier to vote to table this one big pork amendment than a lot of little pork amendments. That is probably a good strategy. Maybe that will be successful--a lot of big pork amendments. Because we had one which saves $1.62 billion, one of $235 million, one saves $724 million, one to save $2 billion. We were going to have four amendments and ask our colleagues to take a look at each of those. I assume the majority has concluded that if we just lump all these together and throw out all the amendments that nobody wants to vote against, then try to convince enough Republicans to join with Democrats to waive the point of order--the motion. So therefore, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader. Mr. MITCHELL. I thank my colleague. I do not intend to prolong this discussion. I merely want to say from our standpoint we regarded the offer as a very fair and reasonable one because we accepted the truly extraordinary procedure that was suggested with respect to offering amendments to the conference report. At least in the 6 years I have been majority leader I have no recollection of this procedure ever having been used. And, therefore, we felt that agreeing to this procedure was a major concession. It was something, I would say to my colleague, about which there is a great deal of reservation by many Members of the Senate because, as we all know, conference reports are not amendable under Senate rules and this would have done so. At the same time, the debate over the past several days has focused primarily on the spending issue and we felt that, further, by having a vote on the spending issue was a major concession. I can understand the view of my friend and colleague from their standpoint it was not acceptable. But we felt from our standpoint it was a major concession on our part, to make this proposal, and it now having been objected to, I suggest we proceed to the budget point of order and the waiver and then let us vote on the matter and dispose of it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor? Mr. MITCHELL. I believe we agreed the Senator from New Mexico would be recognized to make a point of order. Mr. HATCH. I thought I had the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has been yielded the floor by the Senator from Utah for making a point of order. Mr. HATCH. For that purpose, not losing my rights to the floor--but I formally protect it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to Budget Act section 306, I raise the point of order against the conference report on the basis that it contains matters within the jurisdiction of the Senate Budget Committee, and because it has not been considered by the Budget Committee it is subject to a point of order. I make such a point of order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act for the consideration of the conference report. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive, of course, is debatable. The Senator from Utah has the floor. Is the majority leader finished? Mr. MITCHELL. No, I just ask the Senator if he will yield for me to make a comment. Mr. HATCH. For that purpose only. Mr. MITCHELL. I say to my colleagues, we have debated this matter now for 4 days. I believe all Senators are fully aware of the issues involved. I hope we can vote as soon as possible. I propose we vote immediately and whatever the outcome, pursue the alternatives which I suggested, which I repeat again. If the point of order prevails and the motion to waive fails, in my view there will be no point in remaining in session and I will suggest that we adjourn until after Labor Day. If the point of order fails and the motion to waive prevails, I believe we should complete action on this bill as soon as possible thereafter, and then adjourn until after Labor Day. So I hope we can get on with this. The matter having been fully debated, let us bring it to a vote, let us decide it one way or the other at this time. I thank my colleagues for their courtesy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, of course naturally we are going to bring this to conclusion today, one way or the other, at least as far as Senators going home. I pledge if we sustain this point of order and the other side of the aisle cooperates, and the President is willing, we will deliver a tougher crime bill to the American people. It will take a little while longer but Congress has plenty of time left before it adjourns this fall to send a tough crime bill to the President. We will increase spending on law enforcement, we will target prison spending on building and operating actual conventional prison space--that is if our amendments are adopted. So we would concentrate on actually building and operating actual conventional prison space, not alternative facilities to prisons or other soft-headed approaches to punishment which characterizes the Clinton administration's approach. We will drop the requirement that States must establish a liberal corrections policy, dictated by the Federal Government, before they can receive this money. We will distribute this money and the other funds in the bill fairly. We will do away with the administration's wide discretion to use the funding in this bill as a virtual political slush fund. We will cut more pork, hopefully all of it, from the bill, not just the amount we are talking about. We will add back tough provisions adopted in the Senate in November but dropped in a conference controlled by the liberals on the other side of the aisle in both Houses. We would add back into the bill tough anticrime provisions such as mandatory minimum penalties for gun crimes. We would add back into the bill tough mandatory minimum penalties for selling drugs to children, or employing them in drug crimes. We would add back the Dole-Hatch-Brown provision providing tough Federal penalties for violent juvenile gang offenses. We would add provisions like the Smith-Simpson Terrorist Alien Removal Act to address the threat of terrorism being imported to our streets. We would add provisions like the Simpson criminal alien deportation provision which expedites the removal of convicted aliens from our country after they do time, and similar other tough provisions. If the point of order is upheld, we will hear a series of counterproductive partisan blasts from the President and his allies, no doubt about it. I have not engaged in the inside-the-beltway exercise, but after the partisan rhetoric clears, if the President and his allies want a tough crime bill they will be able to get one from this side of the aisle. I was making my point a little earlier that we already have seven Federal departments sponsoring 266 programs which serve delinquent and at-risk youth: 31 of them in the Department of Education, 92 in the Department of Health and Human Services, 3 in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 9 in the Department of the Interior, 117 in the Department of Justice, 8 in the Department of Labor, and 6 in the Department of Transportation--all for programs which serve delinquent and at-risk youth; 266 Federal programs. Now we want to add even more. Even though the source of this, of course, is the General Accounting Office of the United States of America, May 5, 1994--this is what they have said here. They have also said, just to make it abundantly clear, the General Accounting Office recently reported that there are already 7 Federal departments sponsoring, like I say, 266 prevention programs. The GAO found that there already exists ``a massive Federal effort on behalf of troubled youth.'' They also say: Taken together, the scope and the number of multiagency programs show that the Government is responsive to the needs of these young people. It is apparent from the Federal activities and response that the needs of delinquent youth are being taken quite seriously. Yet, we have all kinds of money in this bill for that purpose. Now, in the Crime Control Fund, the trust fund proposed by the Democrats as a means of financing this conference report, I think it has been amply explained that is going to increase the deficit by $13 billion if this bill passes in its current form. The crime control fund, as proposed in the Senate-passed bill, was deficit neutral. As proposed in the Republican alternative, deficit neutral--meaning it would not cost the taxpayers additional moneys. Nor would the deficit be increased because the crime control fund in the Senate bill provided for a lowering of the discretionary spending caps by an amount exactly equal to what is transferred into the crime fund. The proposed Democrat fund in this bill, in this conference report now, on the other hand, lowers the caps through 1998 but extends the crime fund through the year 2000. Almost half of the funding of this bill is concentrated in the last 2 years. So the American people, if this bill passes, if we lose on the point of order and it passes, which would be the case, they are being sold a bill of goods as to how much this is going to do against crime, because most of this funding comes in the last 2 years, 1999 and the year 2000. The reason that is so--well, there are a variety of reasons that is so. The discretionary caps run through 1998. Therefore, spending after that year without the control mechanism of the caps results in an increase in the deficit. So you are talking $13 billion in deficit spending under this bill if it passes today, or whenever. My colleagues on the other side may well argue that the crime bill is paid for by reductions in the Federal work force. However, the only real way to make sure those savings will be used for the crime bill is to limit the possibility that they cannot be spent elsewhere. The only way to do this is to lower the overall cap on discretionary spending by the amount that is set aside for this crime bill, and they are unwilling to do that. By the way, an awful lot of the spending will be just waste because if we lose on the point of order, we know we would lose on the lumped together amendments suggested by the majority leader and the Democrats. So that is why we are going to go ahead to a point of order. This is the wasteful spending that will be in the conference report, not in the Senate bill: Model Intensive Grant Program. They can do whatever they want to, $625.5 million. They can read the language of the bill and claim that it is more specific, but really it is so broad they can do just about anything with it; Local Partnership Act, $1.6 billion. They can do just about anything they want to with that; National community economic partnerships, $230 million. I might add, we are going to give money to community development corporations with no mention of fighting crime. I suppose, the argument will be, ``Well, if we can get the community development corporations to do some building, that will help with crime.'' I suspect if we spend $3 trillion this year and put that in this bill, we can argue that will help crime, to help against crime. Community based justice grants, $50 million; Police recruitment, not by police departments but by community organizations, to be established, I guess or brought together. One would think that the police are very capable of recruiting their additional officers, but we are going to put 24 million bucks of the taxpayers' money in there just for police recruitment purposes; There is $150 million for certain punishment for young offenders. My goodness, they knocked out the Moseley-Braun-Hatch amendment that would have treated youthful offenders who committed heinous crimes the same as adults. That would have done a lot more than spending $150 million to try and fund good old feel-good programs for the punishment of young offenders; There is $377 million for local crime prevention block grant programs --$377 million; There is $243 million for family and community endeavor schools, for that grant program. You notice how the word ``grant'' crops up all the time. That is money you can just go out there and spend. That is money that makes the administration look good. I suppose all administrations have been getting away with this, including Republican administrations, for years, and I am for stopping it now because this country is wallowing in debt. You have $36 million for assistance for delinquent and at-risk youth. You have $4.5 million for urban recreation and at-risk youth. That is after 266 programs for at-risk youth already in existence. I think what we have been trying to do by fighting as hard as we have over these last number of days is to stop this gravy-sucking hog that happens to be the voracious-eating Federal Government and the liberal community from just eating us alive in this country. That is what we are trying to do. Let me just say, we have been discussing this report for the past several days. During this debate, several of my colleagues have extolled the virtues of the social spending in this bill as vital to our communities, and they stress the need for these programs now. Well, Mr. President, I would like to point out to these Senators that programs like them are throughout our communities now and many of them have been around for quite a long while. These existing programs may have different names, they may be administered slightly differently from the way these additional, duplicable programs under this bill will be administered or they may even be granted to different organizations, but their purpose is the same as those contained in this conference report. In other words, under the guise we are going to have a tough crime bill, they have hidden all of this money to spend so they can spend and spend and spend and spend and spend some more. You wonder why I call it a gravy-sucking hog. That is what this bill is. And it is not just the $5 billion we have been talking about. There are so many different grants in here it is unbelievable. Mr. President, if we examine the social programs included in this conference report, we find that several of them overlap in their purpose and what they are meant to provide to our communities. Many of them, in fact, under the broad goal of crime prevention are actually youth development and services programs. Others are economic and community development programs. And while I agree with the broad goal of those programs where they have had hearings and they have had to justify themselves and we advanced them, I just do not think we should create new additional duplicative programs and pour billions of dollars into them when similar programs already exist. And we are not talking about one or two programs. We have hundreds of domestic assistance programs designed to promote youth, economic or community development. Now, I admit that not every one of these existing programs overlaps the new programs in this bill, but the vast majority do. This is a game that has been played here for 40 years, and I am trying to put an end to it. If we do not win on the point of order, I just have to say the American people have lost. I may have lost here, but the American people lost. So I am hoping we will sustain this point of order. Let us just look at one of the new social programs in the conference report before us, the National Community Economic Partnership Program. The purpose of that section of this report, of this conference report, is to increase private investment in distressed local communities and to build and expand the capacity of local institutions to better serve the economic needs of local residents through the provision of financial and technical assistance to--get this--economic development corporations. You do not see the word ``crime'' in there anywhere, although I am sure an argument can be made that anything that does good will help to alleviate crime. Therefore, my argument: Why do we not spend a trillion dollars if that is the way it is? This is just an authorization bill. What difference does it make? Mr. President, as I mentioned--I am going to just choose this one area, because there are a lot of them--as I have mentioned before, we already have numerous programs to foster economic and community development. While all of these do not involve community development corporations, they are still funneling money and resources into economic and community development projects across this country. Let me just cite a few examples and the obligation for fiscal year 1994. Let me just talk about this Economic Development Corporation language of this bill and the moneys that we are going to duplicatively spend if this bill passes in its current form, if we do not win on the point of order. Now, I might add, all of these do not involve community development corporations. They are still similar, throwing money into economic development projects across this country. Let me give a few examples. The community facilities loans, $75 million; the intermediary relending program, $32.5 million; business and industrial loans, $249 million. These are already existing programs, by the way, that we wonderful Members of Congress have done in our compassionate way. I want you to know that we are all very compassionate around here. We do these things for you people out there. We want you to benefit from these, and you do. So we are really great, are we not? By the way, we do not dig in our pockets any more than anybody else. We are digging into your pockets to pay for all of these. Let me just keep going through here for a few minutes. Community facilities loans, it is a mere $75 million. What is that in an almost $2 trillion economy per year? Intermediary relending programs, $32.5 million, again an inconsequential amount, is it not? Business and industrial loans, why, that is only $249 million. Do not worry about it. It does a lot of good. It does a lot of good. We are compassionate here. Rural development grants, that is only $32.35 million; economic development grants for public works and development facilities, $171.9 million. I submit all these do do good. I submit it. We are doing this for you. Do not worry, our hearts are right. We are doing this all for you. Economic development, support for planning organizations, $26 million. Every one of us here want to help our States. I am no exception. I do, too. Economic development technical assistance, $12.5 million; economic development public works impact program. I do not know how many million are in that. Economic development State and local, I do not know how many in that, but the State and local economic development planning is $4.5 million. That is inconsequential. We all know that. Special economic development and adjustment assistance program, that is $24.1 million--a small amount really in the overall consideration if you think about it. Community economic adjustment, growth management planning assistance, community development block grant--I might add, the other two I do not have the figures for but the community development block grant entitlement grants--I have to admit I support that--it is only $2.871 billion, and it does do a lot of good. In fact, all of these do. I would have a rough time taking any of them out, I have to tell you, because we want to do so much good for you. Cities programs, $54.36 million; community development block grants technical assistance, I do not know how much that is. I do not have the figure there. Community Development Block Grants States Program, that is only $1.233 billion. Remember, this is just one of the areas where we spend money for you wonderful people that we love in our States. And we do, we love you. And we are showing our compassion for you because we really do. And I have to say I do love the people in my State, and I want them to have everything that they can. All these programs help. I am not ridiculing them. They help. I may be ridiculing the total number. Now, that may be what I am doing here. For those who are wondering why I am talking about this, it may be that I am pointing out that we already have so many duplicative programs that why in the world do we need to spend billions of dollars in a crime bill most of which will not be paid for until 1999, the year 2000. Why do we need to do that? There is good reason for these. Indian Community Development Block Grant Program, Indian loans, economic development. I am for those. Economic grants, economic development, Appalachian regional development, Community Development Revolving Loan Program, loans for small business. We all agree with that. Tennessee Valley region rural development community services block grant, the Community Development Work Study Program, Empowerment Zones Program, community services block grant, community services block grant. These are duplicative block grants by the way. Discretionary awards, I do not know what that means. I do not know if I am for that or not. Buildings and Facilities Program, schools and roads, grants to States schools and roads, grants to the counties. I do not have the monetary figure but you can figure they are in the millions and in some cases the billions. I am just talking about one area. These are the community services areas, just one little area. And yet--well, let us go a little further. Grants to counties, very low to moderate income housing loans, rural housing site loans, cooperative extension service, rural economic develop loans and grants, outdoor recreation, acquisition development and planning, Urban Park Recreation and Recovery Program, minority business development centers, technical preservation services, disposal of Federal surplus real property for parks, recreation and historic monuments, business services--business services--technical assistance and training grants, Volunteers In Service To America, urban community service. I can go on and on. The point is that--and I am assuming that every one of those programs is good. We have had hearings on them. We have had the appropriate committees investigate them and decide that they are worthwhile for America, and these billions of dollars of duplicative programs are essential. I am willing to admit it. Then why are we adding billions of dollars more to this particular bill? Why are we doing that and at the same time cutting back on Senate-passed, overwhelmingly Senate-passed amendments that they just tossed out in conference that would really make a difference on crime? That is what really gets me. I could even spend more if I knew the crime bill really had all these tough provisions in it. To me that has been more important than the pork barrel parts, although those are important. But the reason I am talking about pork barrel right now is because if we lose on the point of order, we lose on getting the pork barrel out. My friends on the other side will say, ``Well, you have had a chance to vote on it.'' We all know how the vote will turn out. Nobody does not. My purpose is to show that we already have programs designed to provide the same goals as those contained in this conference report-- hundreds, actually thousands of programs, thousands. And I am willing to admit that they are all well-intentioned and most all of them are good. Why do we have to, in a crime bill, hide billions of dollars more? And even if we took the full $5 billion out, what happens to all of the discretionary grant money if we do not allow the other amendments, which the majority leader's approach would not do. I suspect that will all be spent, if it is ever raised, if it is ever appropriated, it will all be spent on discretionary grants. Now, this is a how-to book, just one little book, on Federal domestic grants. Now, just look at this. That is just one of them. It is a how- to book, how you can get these grants. It lists Federal grants which go to the States and to individuals. Look at that. We do a good job in the Federal Government. We let people know what we have here to give to them. I agree all these programs--frankly, I suppose they are all good. I know they are--I know, with every fiber in my being, they are all well-intentioned. I know that. My colleagues are very sincere in spending your money. There is no question about it. They want to do what is right for you, and they are even telling you how to get it. They even outlined it--if you would care to read all of this, that is. I admit there are a lot of people who care to read it. There are people who always have their hands out to the Federal Government. And you know, they are growing every day in this country, people with their hands out to the Federal Government, people who read this one single catalog of Federal domestic assistance every day. I would suggest that all of you should read it, too. Everybody in America ought to read this. And you will be able to get some of this money, too, maybe, and then we can even spend more of your money. We can hide it in other bills that are touted as being very, very important for us. And we can take away some more if you would let us. I mean, it is fun around here because we have almost $2 trillion--well, no, we have about $1.4 trillion a year to spend around here. There is nothing better than spending. We get credit at home for that, you know. That is why this crime bill has all the spending and all these discretionary grants which we do not even, we do not even try to knock out but we want to tighten the language so that they go for what has been represented here. I only waved this around because this is doggone ridiculous, I can hardly stand it. There are people who just love that book because that is the way to get more of your dollars. My purpose today is to show that we already have programs designed to provide the same goals as those contained in this conference report. We do not need to create new programs and pour money into them. Recent GAO reports show that we have over 150 job training programs-- 154 to be exact, if I am correct, and I think am--and over 200 new programs. Mr. President, we do not need any more. We need to protect the taxpayers for a change. These programs already exist. And we still have the crime problem in this country. If the current programs--they are everywhere--are not working, if the current overspending of your tax dollars is not working, why put additional moneys in at a time when our country is going broke and when we cannot fix it with the additional money? Why do we not fix the problems we have now and not create a bigger maze of bureaucracy and programs which this bill tends to do--not ``tends'' to; does. (Mr. CAMPBELL assumed the chair.) Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the purpose of this conference report is to fight crime, not to set up a new system of grants and programs similar to those we already have. The reason all 10 amendments are important, and the reason we have to reject the kind offer of the majority leader to lump all pork into one $5 billion amendment is because we know it would not pass. We would not take it up. We have four amendments so the people would have to stand up and vote. One amendment only has to be voted on once. It is only distasteful once to vote that amendment down. But if we split that into four amendments, we might have one in a few of them. We might have saved the taxpayers' dollars. That is one reason why we do not like this deal. Our liberal spending colleagues know that with one distasteful vote they can probably get away with that at home and live with it. But they cannot live with passing and removing some of this pork out of the bill through individual, single amendments. But even if that were the case, and it is not--but if it were the case--the more important part of our proposal of 10 amendments is to toughen this bill, to tighten the prison language so the money goes to build prisons instead of for everything related to prisons, which means more and more bureaucracy and more and more social workers. That is why Charlton Heston is saying two social workers for every cop on the street. He is right. He is absolutely right on that. We would tighten that language. We think we would win on that amendment. They do not want that amendment because the language lets them do as much as they want to and they can help their social worker friends. We also believe that it is worth the fight to go after these mandatory minimum sentences. On prison language, I will go back to that. We would tighten that language. We would eliminate the reverter clause. And we would reinforce the truth-in-sentencing provisions of this bill. That means that in order to get the money, the States would have to have people serve 85 percent of their sentences. Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. HATCH. Not at this point. I would like to finish this one line of thought, although normally I would. We want to eliminate the correctional plan provided for in this bill. Again, I hate to tell you this, but the people who wrote this bill know that we here in the Federal Government do a lot better job of telling you what to do than you can do yourselves. We do. We are just better at it. So they in their own enlightened way have actually defined how you get this prison money. You meet their correctional standards. You let the Federal Government tell us how to run our State and local prison systems and, by gosh, you might have a chance of getting money. It is a joke. We want to tighten that language up. We want to ensure that the prison money will go to build brick-and- mortar prison cells for hardened criminals because there is a revolving door. The States are so burdened right now with the lack of prison space that prisoners are walking in and out of prison almost at will. They go right out to their life of crime because they do not know what to do with them. We would have truth-in-sentencing for first-time offenders as well. We would add the Simpson amendment which would expedite criminal alien deportation, get rid of these illegal aliens and get them out of our country. Who could be against that? Why would the majority of us not vote on that? Why? We will never vote on that unless we sustain the point of order. It is that simple. We will never vote on it. We will not take up the prison language unless we sustain the point of order. We will never vote on it. The Gramm mandatory minimum penalties for the use of guns in crimes, the one thing that could do something about the proliferation of guns. We will never vote on that because the majority leader does not want a vote on it, because he knows we would win. He knows we would win on the criminal alien language. People are fed up to here. Where are my colleagues from the affected States who are awash in immigration? Where are they on this floor saying we need to vote on that criminal-alien deportation provision? They know we would win. They do not want to face that. They do not want to tighten this bill in these respect. Mandatory minimum penalties for selling drugs to minors--how could anybody not want to vote on that or automatically put it in the bill? How about it? I feel so strongly about that that I am almost to the point that I would go with the majority leader's approach if you put that provision in the bill. I would hate to lose all these other good things on tough crime. I would. What about mandatory minimum penalties for employing minors to sell drugs? Who would think anyone would be against putting that in the bill? But it will never have a chance if we do not sustain the point of order. None of these will. We will not get the pork out of the bill. Of course, we will not if we go with the majority leader's program. They would never do it. They would hold their noses and let those who are up for election this year vote, to the extent they can vote against it. But they would get the 51 votes. There is no question. They would keep the pork in the bill. We know it. They have to keep their side together. Their side spends more than we do. Mandatory minimum repeals--these assistant U.S. attorneys put their lives on the line to stand up, and then we find that this administration--at least attorneys in the Justice Department have-- threatened them with criminal indictments because they have spoken out on this bill. These are career attorneys. Assistant U.S. attorneys, the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys comprises nearly 4,000 prosecutors who have to prosecute Federal crimes and Federal violent crimes. They have been threatened with political reprisals. Worse yet, they have been reportedly threatened with criminal prosecution. How dare these people do this? We are never going to vote on these things if we do not sustain a point of order. I suggest to any who might think of voting to waive the Budget Act that the more important part--what I have been trying to do, even more important than getting the fat out of this bill, although that is extremely important, and I would like to do it, and we would have a better chance if the point of order is sustained--is all of these tough-on-crime provisions that they know we would pass. So they will not let them see the light of day because they are afraid they will pass. I want to say one last thing before I give up the floor. I notice that the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee is here. Let me say one last thing, because I want to let the American people know how cynical the approach is on this bill. The Clinton administration has promised the Nation that it will put 100,000 new police officers on our streets to combat crime. Republicans believe that placing additional police on the street is a step in the right direction. So Republicans, in a bipartisan effort to assist the President in fulfilling his pledge, have been willing to provide the administration with the funding that is needed to do so. The hiring will be implemented by the crime bill's $8.85 billion cops-on-the-beat program. The $8.85 billion would be spread out over 6 fiscal years. Got that? The $8.85 billion will be spread out over 6 fiscal years. Unfortunately, it has become evident that the administration's plan on the cost estimate falls far short of the lofty goal of 100,000 police officers. According to recent studies, if one were to include the cost of recruitment, salary, benefits, background checks and equipment, the actual cost of hiring a new police officer is approximately $71,000 in the first year alone. Accordingly, the total cost of fully funding 100,000 new State and local police officers is closer to $7 billion per year, not just $8.85 billion over 6 years. Or should I say the average of $1.47 billion a year that the conference report provides for. Yet, as recently as just this last week, the President was saying we are going to get you 100,000 new cops on the street. There is no way. It is cynical. With $8.85 billion spread over 6 years, at $1.47 billion a year, no way can you get 100,000 police on the street. With that particular level of funding, assuming all the funding is dedicated to police hiring, the crime bill only fully pays for the hiring of the retention of the 20,000 police. According to a card-carrying Democrat, John Diluilio, it is estimated that it takes 10 officers to put the equivalent of one officer on the beat around the clock. Accordingly, the crime bill's cops-on-the-beat program will put only an additional 20,000 around-the-clock officers on the street. That is according to this leading Democrat theorist at Brookings, who is constantly quoted when his expertise meets their needs, but is ignored in this particular case. He is not a Republican. He is a Democrat. The cops-on-the-beat program is intended to provide seed money for State and local law enforcement hiring. It only permits the Federal Government to pay up to 75 percent of an officer's salary. Under the administration's implementation strategy, the Federal share of the salary will be phased out over 3 years. Now get that. Under this bill, even if we spend the full $1.47 billion a year--and that might be higher--if you used every penny, it would provide up to 20,000 cops. Think about it. The Federal Government is only going to pay 75 percent of the officers' salaries. I just wonder about that. The States and localities--and get this-- are expected to pick up the full salary after 3 years and contribute other costs. It is 25 percent in the first, 50 percent in the second, and 75 percent in the third, and 100 percent in the fourth--including the new pensions, contributions and health insurance. I have had more than one local leader tell me: Gee, if we had the 25 percent, we would be doing it now. We would be spending the money on police now. But it is only 25 percent that they have to come up with in the first year, and the second year it is 50, the third year 75, and the fourth, 100 percent. The cops-on-the-beat program no longer requires that grants be used to hire or rehire police officers and provides strong incentives for alternative uses of the money. So it is extremely cynical to say you can have 100,000 police. They have known this for the last 2 months-- really since November, as a matter of fact. It is a joke, and yet that is what they are selling the American people on this bill. This is a tragic bill because it could be so good if these 10 amendments were adopted. But they do not even have a chance unless the point of order is sustained. As much as 3 percent of the $8.8 billion--$260 million of this police money--can be spent on technical assistance grant studies and evaluation. Of the remaining funds, $1.2 billion can be expended in nonhiring grants. Furthermore, the remaining funds, which are supposed to be dedicated to hiring grants, could be used for paying overtime if the Attorney General concludes more police would be deployed by doing so. None of this is saying that the Federal Government should pick up the full tab for hiring 100,000 State and local police officers. Crime control is, and should remain, primarily a local function. The Federal Government should assist and not supplant the States in this effort. However, the Congress should be forthcoming in the facts surrounding this bill. We have not been. There has never been more disassembling on a bill than I have seen on this one. I will be happy to have it pointed out if we have not. This crime bill is not going to put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Senator Biden knows it, the President knows it, everybody knows it. However one chooses to analyze the crime bill's cops-on-the-beat program, the result is the same. It will only fund--if that--a small fraction of the President's promised 100,000 police officers. Let me just make a comment, and I will be happy to yield the floor. Let me make this point one more time. The more important part of the 10-amendment offering that we made, to me--as much as I hate the pork in this bill, as much as I do not see a justification for hundreds more duplicative programs, or should I say the dozens of programs in this bill that provide for duplicative programs--as much as I hate all that, as much as I hate to see the taxpayers ripped off one more time, and we all know the game here, and anybody that denies that just is not telling the truth in my book; as much as I hate that, the other nine amendments are, to me, more important, because they will make a difference for our kids, they will make a difference against crime, they will make a difference against violence in our society, and they will make a difference against criminal aliens all over our society. I am talking about criminal aliens. We have a lot of honest and decent aliens in our country. So this should not be construed as criticizing them, but just those criminal aliens that are convicted of crimes in our society. We have removed the gun battle from this. But let me say that something interesting happened to me. I was on C-SPAN, and I mentioned my father-in-law who died a couple years ago. I dearly loved him. He was as honest a person as I have ever met in my life. He was a hardworking farmer, a successful farmer on Utah and Idaho soil, which is very dry. A lot of the soil was used for dry farming. He really worked hard to earn what he owned. He came to me 1 day and said, ``Orrin, don't you let them take our guns away from us, because a little community like ours''--at that time it was around 500 people but I think it is now around 700 people--``the thing that keeps us free is they know we have guns and we are tough and we are not going to put up with it.'' He said that to me. It would keep corrupt people from coming in and taking over our communities, including criminal--and I want to emphasize the word ``criminal''--motorcycle gangs. I was not particularly picking on the motorcyclists or the bikers. But I got a lot of calls on this from motorcyclists all over Utah and, frankly, all over the country who know I supported them through the years. And I stood up and voted against the DeConcini amendment, and I said I would do it again. They said, ``Are you talking about us?'' I want to make it very clear I am not talking about them. I promised this morning in a phone call to one of them I would say this on the floor. I am living up to it. I am glad I remembered it. I almost got through it without saying it. I would feel badly if I did not say it. I had my friend from Colorado indicate to me that bikers are not all bad. I know that he has a Harley-Davidson and enjoys it. So I would not want to offend him either. The fact is I want to make it clear that I will stand up for bikers. It is the criminal elements that I am talking about. I am talking about gangs in Utah. I am maybe a little upset about it because Utah has become such a popular place and we are getting gangs from elsewhere coming in there and shooting people. That is what we do not want. His point is true. I do not mean to make this a gunfight. That is over. His point was ``Do not take our guns away from us because that is what keeps us free.'' I am glad I remembered that and made that particular point. I ask the indulgence of the Senator from Delaware. I kept my friend and colleague way too long, and I apologize to him. Mr. BIDEN. No problem. Mr. HATCH. I really had not intended to speak this long, although I have been encouraged to do so, I might add. Let me just ask if I could ask unanimous consent to allow our colleague from South Carolina, the senior Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], who used to be chairman of the Judiciary Committee, just 5 minutes to make his comments. I will yield the floor if he will. Mr. BIDEN. On the condition that I am recognized and then allow me to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina before I say anything, that is fine by me. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah made the unanimous- consent request? Mr. HATCH. Yes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized. Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the able chairman of the committee. I ask if it is agreeable to make it 7 minutes instead of 5 minutes. Mr. BIDEN. Of course, I will. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to state my support for the point of order that the current crime bill conference report is in violation of the Budget Act. The conference report now under consideration has fallen short as a true crime control plan. I supported the crime bill adopted by the Senate in November 1993. At that time it was my belief the Congress was moving to send a bill to the President that would address violent crime in a decisive manner. After the House and Senate met in conference, the price tag on the crime bill had ballooned over $10 billion. The Democrat-controlled conference tacked on a myriad of social programs which will cost the taxpayer billions of dollars and in my opinion do little to reduce violent crime. Upon consideration of the first conference report to the crime bill, the Republicans in the House and many Democrats joined together and said ``no'' to the excessive Federal spending in the bill. That conference report was defeated and the President was forced to negotiate with those House Members who stood up to the pork spending and other weakened law enforcement provisions in the bill. I congratulate my Republican colleagues in the House who were able to gain several important changes in the conference report. The White House and Democratic leadership were careful to negotiate only to the point where they would secure enough votes for passage. Once that was achieved, many remaining serious flaws with the conference report were not considered and pushed aside. Thus, the conference report was narrowly approved by the House and is now pending before this body. Mr. President, now we have an opportunity to further improve this bill. The action taken by the House of Representatives tells us that when necessary, President Clinton will negotiate on specific provisions within the bill. All we are asking is an opportunity to consider changes in the conference report to reflect a truly bipartisan crime bill worthy of the American people and our Nation's law enforcement. The Senate should take steps necessary to improve this bill. We can strengthen provisions to hold violent offenders accountable and we can cut billions in social spending from this bill without compromising our responsibility to address violent crime in this country. At this point, the Senate should uphold a point of order that the crime bill conference report violates the Budget Act. This is the only way that the crime bill can be improved. By upholding the point of order, modifications can be made and we can then pass a crime bill the American people deserve. We must cut the pork in this bill and restore the true crime control measure which were weakened in conference. I urge my colleagues to support the point of order and oppose any motion to waive the requirements of the Budget Act. Mr. President, on a related matter I want to make a parliamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it. Mr. THURMOND. Over the past few days during debate on the crime bill, on several occasions, a Senator on the other side of the aisle stated that a Republican Senator opposing this bill was being ``disingenuous.'' This disturbed me as we had been acting in good faith to address flaws in the crime bill. It struck me that his comments were in violation of Senate rule XIX. Senate rule XIX states, in part, that ``No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.'' Webster's dictionary defines ``disingenuous'' as lacking sincerity or insincere. My parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President, is it a violation of rule XIX for a Senator to state that another Senator is engaged in conduct on the Senate floor which is insincere or disingenuous? The PRESIDING OFFICER. As the Chair understands rule XIX, page 717, paragraph 2, the Senator is correct, and the Chair does agree with the Senator. Mr. THURMOND. Further, Mr. President, if that Senator is in violation of Senate rules, he may be called to order and may not proceed until the motion to allow that Senator to proceed is agreed to. Is that the case under the Senate rules? The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that that is the remedy if it is done while the Senator in violation is speaking. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I do not believe that my colleague on the other side of the aisle would intentionally violate the Senate rules. Those of us seeking modifications to the crime bill are doing so in good faith. In all sincerity and with no disingenuous motive, we take seriously our duty to our constituents and the American people to legislate in a responsible manner. In a further show of good faith, I know of no Senator who plans to raise the point of order that the Senate rules were violated when our motives were tainted without credibility. However, I felt compelled to raise this issue because our views are strongly and sincerely held that this crime bill can be improved and it should be improved. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], is recognized. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what is the motion before the Senate? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion before the Senate is the motion by the majority leader to waive the Budget Act. Mr. BIDEN. I ask for the yeas and nays on that motion. I am not going to move it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a sufficient second at present. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand there are other Senators who wish to speak on the Republican side, and I think there are several on the Democratic side. But basically we are ready to vote. Mr. President, I would only make two points about what the Senator from Utah has said and what others have said here. First of all, if you have observed, this is an incredible moving target. Every time my Republican friends stand up and say they just want something done on the bill, on the conference report, to change it, knowing that conference reports are not amendable--the first time it started off, we were told by one of the leading Republicans that they had three amendments. A day later, it was six amendments. Then a day later, it got up to 13 amendments. Then it got down to 9 amendments, broken into several parts; could have been as many as 15 amendments, depending how you read it, never having copies of any of these amendments. And then, today, I find out that the issue is not pork. We have a new word in the lexicon here, that it is ``discretionary spending.'' This is not about pork. If we took out every single penny that they call pork, none of which is pork, but even if we take out every single penny we are talking about--which we gave them a chance to do. They have been saying for 4 days, ``Let's vote, let's vote. We want to take out the pork,'' what they call ``pork.'' Fine, give them a vote on it. They do not want to do that. Now, I heard this morning that there are two new phrases that have crept into this last gasp on this debate to keep the crime bill from becoming law. One is that it is discretionary. Now discretionary is described as the money for the police, the money for the prisons. That is discretionary spending, according to them. So now they want to vote on discretionary spending, too. I hope everybody gets it clear: They are not for this bill in any incarnation, if I read correctly what they are saying. If you are against pork--and if they define everything in there that is not for police and not direct spending on police or prisons as pork, which I think they do; maybe some exception. I do not know what it is. And then you add another, I think he said, $13 billion or $14 billion in discretionary spending, that is police and prisons, and they want to deal with that as well. Then you have a problem here, whereas you can see the target moves here. Make it clear: This is not about pork. This is about the crime bill. Now, I will not suggest what motivates them. I will not suggest today that their motivation relates to assault weapons or their motivation relates to a political defeat or success. I will not assert a motivation. But I will assert a conclusion. They are against the bill, period. How can you be for this bill and say I am against, quote, what they call pork, what we call prevention? By the way, I might point out, every police agency is for this; every prosecutor is for this. And I might add, the other thing I heard, by the way, today was--you know, I get these incredible--they are really amazing; I do not know whether incredible violates the Senate rules--but fascinating. How about that--fascinating assertions that those wide eyed liberal big spenders are doing this. Usually, if my friends on the right want to talk about liberals, what has become sort of the mantra that they use? They say--and it turned out it was in the last Presidential debate about the ACLU. ``He is a card-carrying ACLU member.'' Is that not the usual epithet cast at someone? I am not a member, but I am proud of the ACLU. I think they are a first-rate organization. Let me point out, the ACLU is the only outfit that sent a letter that is against this bill. The ACLU is against this bill--card-carrying ACLU. I guess the usual phrase I hear from this side is ``superliberals,'' ``whacko lefties.'' They are the kind of phrases I hear. The ACLU is against the bill. Now that is the letter I got--not only I, every Senator who receives ACLU mail--dated August 24, 1994. It says: We write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union to urge you to oppose the conference report on the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (H.R. 3355). While the conference report contains some laudable measures, we are against it. OK, now, the day before, who do I receive a letter from? Of the last two letters I received, one is from the ACLU against the bill. Now, remember, they are saying, ``Anybody for this bill is a big spending liberal. It is a giveaway program, and it is a product and tool of liberals.'' And the superliberal organization, according to my friend from Utah in the past, has been the ACLU. The ultimate insult would be, ``You are a card-carrying ACLU member.'' That is even more of an insult than saying, ``You are a motorcycle gang guy,'' although he clarified that, I guess. Now, who did I get a letter from the day before, dated August 23, 1994? From the National District Attorneys Association. Now, they are the group that I heard mentioned repeatedly in the last 10 years, representing thousands and thousands of State and local prosecutors. These are not the attorneys general, these are not the people who are up there who deal with the Federal Government, these are back home, local prosecutors. And we were told last time that they were against the habeas corpus and this and that. And they also portrayed them as being conservative, tough law enforcement people. And they are. I am sure there are a few liberals who are prosecutors, but, by and large, this is the group they always hold up and say, ``The National District Attorneys Association is not for the ACLU''--they are clearly not for the ACLU--``is not for this habeas corpus, letting people out of jail, soft on crime thing.'' Well, here is a second letter I got from the National District Attorneys Association. It is addressed to ``Dear Senator Biden,'' and is dated August 23, 1994. I will put both of these in the Record, by the way. It says: As the peoples prosecutors we pledge to do all within our power to lead our communities in their daily struggle against crime. We ask you, the Congress, to give us the means and the leadership to accomplish this task by passing the Crime Bill without further delay and debate. Signed, Robert Deschamps, a real, live, tough prosecutor. I ask unanimous consent that both letters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: American Civil Liberties Union, August 24, 1994. Dear Senator: We write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union to urge you to oppose the Conference Report on the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (H.R. 3355). While the Conference Report contains some laudable measures such as those which make a credible commitment to addressing the root causes of crime, other features in the bill such as the broad expansion of the Federal death penalty and the so called ``three strikes'' provision render this bill a net loss for civil liberties. We are particularly disappointed by the intransigent stand of some in the Senate against the Racial Justice Act. This opposition resulted in that measure being removed from the final Conference Report. We are, however, no less disappointed that so many others have apparently acquiesced in their support of a bill that contains the broadest expansion of the federal death penalty in our nation's history without an equally broad and strong commitment to assuring that the punishment is applied without regard to race. It is more important than ever to separate the federal role from that of the states' role in crime control and prevention. The fundamental role of Congress in this area should be to insure and guarantee civil and constitutional rights in the enforcement of the criminal laws and to provide resources, support and, when necessary, leadership to the states as they carry out their missions. It is equally important that the Congress seek out and respect the limits of the Constitution. In our view, the Conference Report utterly fails in these two important respects. It greatly overreaches by federalizing criminal activity at the state level to create dozens of new federal crimes. Other aspects of the Conference Report blatantly ignore the clear mandates of the Constitution. Nowhere is this more apparent than the provision in the bill which makes death a possible punishment when no murder has occurred. We enclose for your information a detailed analysis of the original Conference Report and later modifications. We believe that a fair reading of these documents should lead you to the conclusion that many of the provisions described should not become the law of the land. Accordingly, we urge you in the strongest possible terms, to oppose the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Sincerely, Ira Glasser, Executive Director. Laura Murphy Lee, Director, Washington Office. ____ National District Attorneys Association, Alexandria, VA, August 23, 1994. Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Biden: The House of Representatives has finished its long debate on the Crime Bill and passed the much needed effort to provide the means to combat this national tragedy. The National District Attorneys Association calls upon the Senate to emulate their colleagues and swiftly end the six year wait for an effective program to address crime. As the prosecutors for every town, city and county across the nation we have worked long and hard with you, the Congress of the United States, to provide the American people with an initiative that both fights crime and address the causes of crime. Our support has been bipartisan, with the needs of our nation foremost in our efforts. The Crime Bill has come too far and too much is at stake to have the Senate reject it at this juncture. As the peoples prosecutors we pledge to do all within our power to lead our communities in their daily struggle against crime. We ask you, the Congress, to give us the means and the leadership to accomplish this task by passing the Crime Bill without further delay or debate. Sincerely, Robert L. Deschamps, President. Mr. BIDEN. The liberal ACLU against the bill; the prosecutors for the bill. Now, I hope we kind of stop this stuff. We debated all this at length before. We are ready to vote, and I would like to ask whether or not the Republicans are ready to vote. Mr. HATCH. I do not think they are right now. The minority leader is working on this matter. I do not know where we are, to be honest with you. Mr. BIDEN. I will yield the floor in about a minute or two here for everyone else to seek recognition. But let the record show, we have been told all along we are ready to vote on striking all the prevention money in the bill. We are ready. Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. BIDEN. I yield for a question. Mr. WELLSTONE. Just for a question. Some of us have been on the floor all morning. We have been anxious to be a part of this debate. But since the debate has gone on for days and days and days, we have just been patient, assuming we were going to vote. Are we about to vote or is this going to go on and on and on? Mr. BIDEN. As my grandfather used to say, ``God willing, and the creek not rising,'' I think we are getting ready to vote. I yield the floor. Let us vote whenever we can. Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Delaware yield for a question? Mr. BIDEN. Yes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. Mr. BUMPERS. I just wanted to ask the Senator, we are prepared--is he saying we are prepared to vote at any time? Mr. BIDEN. Right now. Right this instant. Mr. BUMPERS. The second question is, has the Chair been going back and forth between that side of the aisle and this side in choosing speakers? Mr. BIDEN. The answer is ``yes'' thus far. There have been two Republican speakers and one Democratic. Mr. BUMPERS. Let me just say I am prepared to vote, too. I am probably the only Member of the U.S. Senate who has not spoken on this, but I will be more than happy to go home with that distinction if we can get a vote. Mr. BIDEN. I will say to my friend it would be the only issue he has not spoken on, on the floor. But he usually enlightens us all when he does, so I would like to hear him speak. But I am ready to vote. Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is entirely right. But I am willing to forsake that for the sake of expediency, to get this bill passed. I say to the distinguished chairman, if and when I get a chance to speak on it, I will happily stop in the middle of a sentence if the Republicans are prepared to vote. Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized. Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, there is no doubt that the gravest issue confronting America today is the fear of crime. Crime--and especially crime related to illegal drug use--is running rampant in this Nation, and the public expects Congress to do something to curb this increasing wave of lawlessness and violence that threatens the very fabric of our free society. Many are now asking how free are we, really, if we are afraid to go out into the streets at night? The crime bill coming out of the conference committee provides for 100,000 additional policemen, nearly $10 billion more for new prison construction, military-style boot camps, expanded death penalty provisions, ``three strikes and you're out,'' effective DNA testing, special drug courts, and federalization of drive-by shootings and gang crimes, as well as a number of other excellent features. At the same time, it is not by any means a perfect bill, and there are objectionable provisions with which I strongly disagree. I have consistently opposed gun control, including the Brady bill. Serious efforts were made to remove the gun control provisions from both the Senate version and the conference report, but they failed. The gun control provisions in this conference report deal entirely with the future manufacture and sale of assault weapons. There are 19 assault weapons that are banned. I have studied the assault weapons issue carefully, and have come to the conclusion that it is really primarily an issue of symbolism. It is not really a problem for two reasons: It would be difficult, if not impossible, to find in my State of Alabama a hunter, sportsman, or law-abiding homeowner who uses one of the 19 banned assault weapons. Their rights to hunt, engage in target practice, or protect their families and homes will not be, for all practical purposes, actually affected by the ban in this conference report. At the same time, very few crimes are committed with assault weapons, although it is true that the crimes which are committed using these weapons are more sensational and therefore gain more media attention. Therefore, if laws are enacted to ban such assault-style weapons, they will have little effect, since the few hardened criminals who do want to use these guns will find ways to obtain them. So, the issue is only a symbolic one. This conference report and the good things it does should not be jeopardized by something that affects only a very small number of people and is primarily symbolic. Congress has tried for 6 years to pass a major comprehensive crime- fighting measure, but each time it has failed because of certain provisions, including those relating to gun control. In the meantime, the problems of crime and drugs have continued unabated. It is now time to act. The issue comes down to whether or not we are going to pass a crime bill now and start a truly comprehensive effort to stop the onslaught of crime and drugs. In my judgment, the good features of this bill far outweigh its objectionable provisions. As is the case with all omnibus legislation, we have to weigh the good against the bad and support the side that tilts toward doing something substantial for the public. In my opinion, the good outweighs the bad by at least 5 to 1 in this conference report. The budgetary point of order that has been raised applies to a trust fund into which moneys will flow from previously adopted budget cuts-- primarily from a reduced Federal work force. If the point of order is sustained, funds from this budget-cutting approach cannot be used to finance this $30 billion crime bill. If the trust fund method of financing is not used, the funding of this crime bill or any other crime bill we pass will likely have to come from increased taxes or deficit spending. I would much prefer a crime bill to be paid for through budget savings instead of increased taxes or further deficit spending. For three consecutive Congresses now--since 1989--a comprehensive crime bill has failed to be enacted into law for various reasons. Our failure has always been portrayed as a victory for one political party or particular group and a defeat for the other. But the truth is, our failure to enact a crime bill will be a victory for criminals and a defeat for law enforcement. Law enforcement officials across this country--those who put their lives on the line every day to protect us--overwhelmingly support this legislation. It is time to move forward by defeating this point of order. A vote to sustain the point of order is a vote to kill any chances for enacting anticrime legislation this year. It should be defeated. Mr. President, I would like to have a list of the semiautomatic weapons which are not banned to be printed in the Record following my remarks. In this bill 19 assault-style weapons are specifically banned. To a great extent, efforts have been made to show under some type of interpretation that the 600 weapons listed could not be included in any banned group. Included in this list of 600 weapons is practically every rifle or semiautomatic rifle that is used by sportsmen for hunting in the United States. I think this approach shows our citizens they will be able to keep their rifles. The bill applies only to future manufacturing and sale. In just glancing over this list, I see included a Winchester model 12 pump shotgun. It is not banned and so on down through the list over 600 similar hunting and defense weapons are not banned. I ask unanimous consent that list be printed in the Record following my remarks. There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Excerpt From the Congressional Record of Aug. 21, 1994--Weapons Not To Be Banned ``APPENDIX A Centerfire Rifles--Autoloaders Browning BAR Mark II Safari Semi-Auto Rifle Browning BAR Mark II Safari Magnum Rifle Browning High-Power Rifle Heckler & Koch Model 300 Rifle Iver Johnson M-1 Carbine Iver Johnson 50th Anniversary M-1 Carbine Marlin Model 9 Camp Carbine Marlin Model 45 Carbine Remington Nylon 66 Auto-Loading Rifle Remington Model 7400 Auto Rifle Remington Model 7400 Rifle Remington Model 7400 Special Purpose Auto Rifle Ruger Mini-14 Autoloading Rifle (w/o folding stock) Ruger Mini Thirty Rifle Centerfire Rifles--Lever & Slide Browning Model 81 BLR Lever-Action Rifle Browning Model 81 Long Action BLR Browning Model 1886 Lever-Action Carbine Browning Model 1886 High Grade Carbine Cimarron 1860 Henry Replica Cimarron 1866 Winchester Replicas Cimarron 1873 Short Rifle Cimarron 1873 Sporting Rifle Cimarron 1873 30\" Express Rifle Dixie Engraved 1873 Rifle E.M.F. 1866 Yellowboy Lever Actions E.M.F. 1860 Henry Rifle E.M.F.
