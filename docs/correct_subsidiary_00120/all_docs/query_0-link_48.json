I've been around quite a few years. However Ebay was NOT our money processor when they owned PayPal. Paypal was the processor. Ebay was not licensed or operated at the money processor.\n\nAnd no, all the funds that PP earned did not go to Ebay. PP was its own company with its own operating expenses. PP generated their own financial statements, paid their own employees and paid their own expenses. Certainly some of the net income would come back to Ebay because they owned it, but not every penny they made. If that were to happen then who is paying the expenses for the PP site?\n\n\"EBay/MP is irritating us by making registration more difficult and by asking for further verification of long standing accounts randomly.\" I'm not sure how correct this is. Certainly from my point of view Ebay made the process more cumbersome than it needed to be, but Ebay only asked for info that was required by law for them to collect. And I haven't seen anything about it being random. That would mean that Ebay is randomly complying with the federal laws. I'm not sure they would risk something like that as that could backfire big time.\n\nIndividual accounts that get hijacked is something that Ebay does take seriously but isn't due to a lack of security on the site. Individuals getting hacked is usually do to something that happened on the account holder's end. Lapse in security, using unsecured wifi connections, sharing passwords, firewalls, etc. etc.\n\nmam98031 • Volunteer Community Member • Buyer/Seller since 1999\n\nHi thanks for your pleasant reply. Yeah, I have to agree with your reply, your 100% on it. The big thing is no one likes their money being held. What else can I say. Anger towards them, with their policies. The never ending\n\nconflicts between partners and who is in charge of what. Sort of offensive when you are left no preferred choices in the policies. Note \"preferred choices\". While same day payment is now possible through EBay, for a small fee it is just another hornswaggle to get more $ out of your sales for their bottom line. business is business and these days with the way our economy is going, the separation of one's bits of money getting nipped at every turn and the options limited to take it or leave it, makes a person feel like they fall into a black hole and give up. Not that I ever give up, knowing where and when to make a beef makes a difference.\n\nHaving nice people to interact with helps cool the angers and brightens perspectives, Thanks for your time.\n\nEither way you look at it when the kingdom has all the eggs in their basket, the king gets to divide the royalties however they want. Us \"pheseants\" joke are lucky we get anything out of our labors.\n\nThe 12.9% FVF is calculated on the item, shipping and tax as the base amount for the FVF.\n\nwhere when and how does one figure that into the price of an item?\n\nYour getting charged 12.9% on a tax and shipping fee that has no beginning to no end for your bottom line on the item you sell. No matter how much you think you should pad your item. That totally defeats the competitive pricing aspect of selling anything. EBay should be charging the tax man and the shipping company the 12.9% not the seller. or do they charge both and we don't know it. that is the elephant in the room.\n\nI think what you stated is correct. Ebay charges a fee (12.9%) on shipping cost you charged to customers. For instance an item selling for $25 and you charged shipping costs of $10. Ebay would collect a commission of $1.29 from the $10 shipping. So if USPS charges $8.75 for shipping the item to the buyer. Your actual cost in shipping is $10. 04 and you have to absorb the extra four cents. Ebay charges not only a commission on shipping but also a fee (commission) on the taxes it collected from sales. So if the buyer is from a state that charges 10% sales tax, Ebay would collect $2.50 in tax from the buyer. However, Ebay would charge 12.9% of commission from the $2.50 of tax or collect four cents from the seller. Somebody is getting really greedy here."
