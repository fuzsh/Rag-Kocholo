        "text": "How Can I Lower My Monthly Bill for Natural Gas and Electricity?\n\nNatural gas service providers, such as Southwest Gas Corporation and UNS Gas, Inc., pass on increases in their natural gas costs through purchased gas adjustor mechanisms that are approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. Arizona Public Service Company and Tucson Electric Power customers may also experience higher electric bills as a result of those utilities' approved power and fuel adjuster mechanisms that allow APS and TEP to pass energy costs (that include natural gas) on to their customers. With this in mind, RUCO offers the following suggestions on how you can lessen the effects of natural gas costs that are directly passed on to you by your local service providers. You can also use RUCO's \"Consumer Links\" page to go directly to your local service providers' websites to find out what types of energy savings plans are available to you.\n\nLink from Porch on how to lower your utility bills\n\nLevelized Billing Plans\n\nMost of Arizona's utilities offer levelized billing plans that allow you to spread your total annual costs for natural gas or electricity over a twelve month period. In the case of natural gas, plans such as this have the effect of lowering your monthly bill during colder months and raising it over warmer months. For many consumers this type of plan makes their monthly utility bills more manageable. For example, if you have average monthly natural gas bills of lets say $65 during the five coldest months of the year, but only have average bills of $25 during the remaining seven warmer months of the year, a levelized billing plan would allow you to pay approximately $42 per month. Any increases or decreases in your consumption habits would be averaged into your next year's monthly bills.\n\nLow Income Assistance Programs\n\nDepending on your annual household income, you may qualify for low income assistance plans that can lower your monthly costs for natural gas and electricity. An example of this is a federal program called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP, which provides funds to state governments to help pay part of those bills for households that qualify, as well as for home weatherization. To find out more about LIHEAP you can contact the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Community Services Administration office. In addition, Most of Arizona's utilities offer programs of their own. Some of these programs, such as UNS Gas, Inc.'s \"Warm Spirit\" program, are funded by contributions that come directly from customers themselves.\n\nDemand Side Management Programs\n\nDemand side management, or DSM, programs are offered by utilities to help customers to conserve and use natural gas and electricity in the overall interests of reducing utility costs. In other words DSM is the implementation of those measures that help customers to use natural gas and electricity more efficiently. RUCO believes that properly implemented DSM programs can provide ratepayers with the tools they need to help mitigate the effects of utility rate increases. DSM programs include discounts for purchasing newer energy saving light bulbs and appliances and for the installation of home improvements that include insulated windows and weather stripping. You can contact your local electric or natural gas service provider to find out what types of DSM related plans are available to you.\n\nWeatherization Tips\n\nHere are some tips on how to \"weatherize\" your home in order cut your monthly consumption of natural gas and electricity:\n\nFurnaces and water heaters\n\nTune up your existing furnace.\n\nClean filters on forced-air furnaces in your home.\n\nWrap your home's hot water heater in an insulating jacket.\n\nIf you're buying a new furnace, do not get one any larger than what you need.\n\nIf possible, replace inefficient furnaces and water heaters with new high-efficiency models.\n\nDoors and windows\n\nInstall curtains on the windows in your home.\n\nCheck for leaks and drafts and add weather stripping as needed around your windows and doors.\n\nInsulation\n\nIf your home already has some insulation, consider increasing the amount of insulation in the attic and/or floors over a basement or crawlspace.\n\nInsulate older homes that lack insulation.\n\nMiscellaneous"
