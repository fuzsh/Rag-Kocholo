        "text": "And the Theory of Customer-Centric Innovation\n\nWe can all remember back to the 2008 presidential election when “change” was the word on everyone’s lips. Something about that word excites us. It suggests replacing our mundane world with a future full of opportunity. When applied in a generic way, it can be easy to get everyone on the “change” bandwagon. However, in practice, change can be scary as us humans have an innate instinct of self preservation. Many a Yankees fan was dismayed when “The House That Ruth Built” was abruptly torn down. As a college football fan, I was in disbelief when my school’s long-time rival changed conferences and we were no longer scheduled to play each other. People are naturally nostalgic of the past and how things used to be.\n\nThis same natural behavior we see in people occurs in companies. Executives from all industries are jumping on the “change” bandwagon. Words like “innovation” and “disruption” are in vogue. We talk about cannibalizing our own business before the competition does. However, in practice most companies have a natural tendency to preserve the status quo.\n\nQuite often in the beginning of a company’s history, the company starts out with an intense focus on a core customer for which it has built a platform which makes hard tasks very easy for customers. Building a successful platform requires intense customer centricity so as to understand what the customer is doing and then remove friction for the customer via platform innovations. Early on companies have little to lose but once a platform becomes dominant, the risks become greater and suddenly change becomes a word that is easy to say but hard to follow through on. It is at this stage that most companies have the tendency to exert control over their platform to fend off competition. This change in focus from the customer to threats and competition has an unintentional effect of stifling innovation on the platform. Instead of coming out with new business models, pricing models, or innovative offerings, a company focuses instead on competitor features and tries to imitate those in hopes that their customers will have no reason to leave their platform if they just match everything the competition is doing.\n\nOne of the best examples of this transition from customer centricity to self preservation is the digital payments industry. Because the payments industry crosses over on practically all other industries, innovative companies in this space have constantly found extreme opposition from entrenched players in other industries.\n\nIn the beginning…\n\nPayPal began in 1998 as a mobile payment company with wireless transactions on Palm Pilots but soon switched focus to online payments when it found a strong customer base on eBay. When PayPal came on the scene, eBay had established such a powerful auction platform that it soon became the de facto monopolist of the auction market. As such, eBay could rely on acquisitions to expand its geographic footprint and coast along as it dominated its seller-buyer platform. When eBay sellers began to enlist in PayPal however, eBay’s culture felt threatened and was ill prepared to innovate on the customer experience at the same speed as PayPal. PayPal created one innovation after the other such as sending payments using email addresses, reducing fraud by launching the first reverse Turing test, creating HTML payment buttons, and so on.\n\neBay responded by creating Billpoint which mimicked much of PayPal’s core functionality. Rather than building innovative features that reduced friction for customers, eBay resorted to cajoling users into adopting Billpoint by exerting more control over its platform. Some of eBay’s tactics included:\n\nOffering free listing days for using Billpoint\n\nCutting fees\n\nMandating use of Billpoint for its Stores sites\n\nForcing buyers to use Billpoint to contribute to the “Auction for America” fundraising campaign following Sept. 11\n\nRolling out a checkout button at the top of every listing that defaulted to Billpoint\n\nNot just eBay tried to defeat PayPal with marketing gimmicks and monopolistic power but also banks tried to pursue legal means against PayPal to classify it as a bank or as an unsecure service.\n\nSo why did PayPal survive this onslaught of attacks from entrenched players? The answer is that their customers repeatedly came to their defense in the form of exponential user growth (not to mention vehement repudiations of eBay’s actions on eBay’s discussion boards). PayPal maintained a customer-centric focus on building a platform that removed more and more friction for its customers.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nEventually eBay realized that its customers had chosen PayPal as their preferred payment solution and so eBay acquired PayPal. While this acquisition greatly improved the customer experience on eBay through platform integrations, eBay’s executives still did not make the decision to acquire PayPal solely for the benefit of its customers. Instead, the acquisition was made to regain control of their “shopping cart.”\n\nDuring the subsequent years under eBay’s ownership, PayPal experienced significant growth from greater integration and therefore adoption on eBay. However, PayPal spent a significant amount of resources in improving the shopping experience on eBay rather than focusing relentlessly on reducing friction for their core customers of the overall payments market.\n\nEnter Carl Icahn stage left. In Feb. 2014 Icahn publicly called for eBay to spin off PayPal as a separate company so as to “focus and empower independent management teams to most effectively build two very different business platforms, make economic decisions independent of each other and, most importantly, foster innovation.” Carl Icahn also quoted Elon Musk, another co-founder and former CEO of PayPal, who said, “It doesn’t make sense that a global payment system is a subsidiary of an auction website… It’s as if Target owned Visa….[PayPal] will get cut to pieces by Amazon Payments, or by others such as Apple and by startups if it continues to be part of eBay.”\n\nJohn Donahoe, eBay’s CEO, brushed off Icahn’s calls for separating the two businesses by labeling Icahn’s actions as “theatrics” and “charades.” After the debate died down, most spectators agreed that the event was indeed a short-term stunt by Icahn to drive up eBay’s stock price…until months later when eBay announced it would reverse course and spin off PayPal.\n\nWallet Wars\n\nEBay announced PayPal’s separation on Sept. 30, 2014 — only three week’s\n\nafter Apple unveiled Apple Pay. Apple had approached PayPal to be a “prominent partner” in Apple Pay but John Donahoe “forced PayPal” to ally with Samsung even against the protests of David Marcus, PayPal’s president at the time. David Marcus subsequently left PayPal to work on a mobile payment solution at Facebook.\n\nIt is obvious that Apple meticulously thought through all of the users — credit card holders, financial institutions, and merchants — when developing Apple Pay. For credit card holders, Apple Pay makes it easy to add a credit card to their account via a camera scan of the card and when the user is ready to make a payment, they merely need to touch their finger to iPhone’s fingerprint scanner and wave the iPhone over the near field communication (NFC) reader.\n\nFor financial institutions, Apple placed security as a top priority. With Apple Pay, no sensitive account numbers are in plain sight like on a credit card and no sensitive data is stored on the phone or on Apple’s servers. Apple has convinced credit card providers that Apple Pay is so secure that they are willing to pay a fee to Apple for each transaction since they can expect reduced fraud.\n\nFor merchants, the security benefits are equally rewarding. If a merchant’s system is hacked (e.g. Target and Home Depot), then the hackers will only make off with tokenized numbers that are meaningless. Apple timed the launch of Apple Pay with requirements by Europay, Mastercard, and Visa (EMV) for all merchants to update their point-of-sale machines to new technology that will includes NFC capabilities by October of 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, across the Pacific Alibaba’s mobile payment solution, Alipay, has quietly surpassed PayPal to become the largest mobile payment solution with nearly $150 billion worth of transactions in 2013 on its platform. In contrast PayPal processed $27 billion worth of mobile transactions in 2013. Unlike eBay, Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba, is aggressively seeking an alliance between Alipay and Apple Pay.\n\nOn another front in the payments industry are retailers like Wal-Mart, CVS, Rite-Aid, and Best Buy who have built an alliance to develop their own answer to digital payments called CurrentC. CurrentC requires the user to unlock their phone, launch the CurrentC app, and scan a QR code — a very clunky experience when contrasted with Apple Pay. Rite-Aid and CVS have NFC readers installed in their stores but have purposefully blocked customers from using Apple Pay with their readers. These tactics echo those of eBay in confronting PayPal to defend their turf.\n\nOn another front, Bitcoin is revolutionizing the way we think about currency and is pursuing the original mission of PayPal’s founders of removing control from mismanaged central banks and governments and providing a stable global currency.\n\nPerhaps most amazing in this history is how PayPal originally started out as a mobile payment company but eventually abandoned mobile payments to focus on online payments. Now that mobile payments is the current battleground, PayPal finds itself entrenched with competitors and should be wary of falling into the same self preservation mindset eBay fell into when attempting to defend its platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt this point the reader may be thinking that I am against any company defending itself from upstart intruders. I want to be clear that this customer-centric focus does not conflict with the idea of achieving and maintaining a dominant position. Actually, I’m arguing that the only truly defensible strategy to market dominance is to have a customer-centric focus.\n\nPeter Thiel, PayPal’s original CEO and co-founder, has argued that competition is for losers and that entrepreneurs should strive to build monopolies. While this may sound like self preservation, Peter clarifies what he means by monopoly, “By ‘monopoly,’ I mean the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.” According to Thiel, the only truly defensible monopoly is a customer-centric monopoly."
