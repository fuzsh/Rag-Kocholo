Passengers should arrive a minimum of 10 minutes before scheduled departures. Passengers must be on board 2 minutes prior to departure.\n\nGeneral Policies & Information\n\nAccessibility\n\nKitsap Transit ferries and gangways are wheelchair friendly. Crewmembers will help to ensure a safe and secure ride. Kitsap Transit can accommodate up to six mobility devices* on the Finest on a first-come, first served basis.\n\n*Mobility Devices are defined by the ADA as \"a manually-operated or power-driven device designed primarily for use by an individual with a mobility disability for the main purpose of indoor and outdoor locomotion.\" Other power-driven mobility devices (OPDMDs) will NOT be allowed aboard the passenger only vessle to maintain the safety of all passengers and crew members. OPDMDs (i.e, ATVs, Segways, mopeds, scooters, golf carts) infringe upon safe operation due to strict weight limits enacted and enforced by the United States Coast Guard, the high volume of pedestrian traffic, the design and operational characteristics of the vessel (there is no available storage to secure such devices), and the substantial risk posed by combustion-engines containing flammable liquid fuel that is a marine pollutant.\n\nBicycles and Scooters\n\nBicycles and electric bikes under 100 pounds are welcome aboard on a first-come first-served basis. Crews will direct passengers on secure placement of their bikes. There are no hanging bike racks on this vessel. Bicycles and electric bikes that do not fit safely in a bike rack will not be allowed on the vessel. Oversized bicycles and electric bikes are allowed on board if they do not block block pathways or doorways. Chaining your bicycle to the rail of the vessel is prohibited. Shoes with metal sports cleats are not allowed.\n\nElectric scooters are allowed on the Kingston Fast Ferry. On the M/V Enetai and M/V Commander, scooters must be stored in the scooter bins at the rear of the vessel, near the bike racks.\n\nService Animals\n\nOnly service animals are allowed in Kitsap Transit buildings, vessels, or buses (the only exception is small animals inside a fully enclosed pet carrier not exceeding 25 pounds). Passengers that are traveling with a service animal are responsible, and may be held liable, for its behavior and actions. Kitsap Transit reserves the right to deny transportation, regardless of certification, if any animal poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others.\n\nComfort animals, emotional support animals, and service animals in training are not service animals and must be in a fully enclosed pet carrier.\n\nPets and comfort/emotional support animals will not be allowed to board in a purse, back pack, reusable grocery bag, etc. Only fully enclosed approved pet carriers are allowed.\n\nFares\n\nOne-way fares are payable with exact cash or ORCA E-purse. Monthly passes can be purchased for round trips. Fares are based on the direction of travel. Passengers can travel to Seattle from Kitsap County for the cash fare of $2 and from Seattle to Kitsap County for the cash fare of $10. More information on fares can be found on our Kitsap Transit Fares page.\n\nItem Size Limitations\n\nDue to space and weight constraints on our vessels, larger items are not allowed aboard Kitsap Transit vessels. As a rule of thumb, items larger than standard luggage will not be allowed (i.e, kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, wheelbarrows, shopping carts, etc.). For a list of other items not allowed on Kitsap Fast Ferries, see the \"Accessibility\" section of this webpage.\n\nFood and Beverages\n\nNo food or beverages are sold aboard. Passengers are not allowed to eat in the cabin, and beverages must be in closed containers.\n\nLost and Found Kingston Fast Ferry\n\nItems left aboard the Kingston vessels will be held on the vessel for 30 days. You can claim a lost and found item within 30 days by asking a crew member for the item.\n\nKitsap Transit is not responsible for lost or stolen items. Any item not claimed after 30 days is donated to charity.\n\nPark & Ride to the Ferry Terminal\n\nKitsap Transit offers free commuter parking at park & ride lots across Kitsap County. Bus service connects park & ride commuters to ferry terminals.\n\nLine Cutting or Holding a Spot is Not Permitted\n\nPlease respect your fellow passengers who arrive early to secure a spot. Line cutting or holding a spot for another person is not permitted. Please join the line in the order you arrive. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.\n\nTransfers\n\nOrca E-purse transfers offer free connecting service within two hours of initial travel. If the next connecting service charges a higher fare, you pay only the additional amount."
