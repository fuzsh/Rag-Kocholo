        "text": "Written by Henry Igwebuike 1min 47sec reading time.\n\nThere is something always similar about Non-Tech founders running a tech company. Their creativity, perseverance, and belief in their idea have always been what steered them to reach the pinnacle of success. Like Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia Co-founders of Airbnb, (an online marketplace founded in 2008 that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations,)worth $100Billion, Linus William Ifejika better known as BLORD (Bitcoin Lord) founder of BLORD GROUP is one amongst Africas Non-technical entrepreneur founders leading some of the biggest Tech business portfolios in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nBLord’s experience in the cryptocurrency business has truly made him one of the finest brains with an entrepreneurial insight and profound understanding as a superlative Bitcoin trader. His ability to successfully decipher the complex intricacies surrounding the cryptocurrency business myth to the least of persons interested in joining the business is what cuts him out from a few Tech entrepreneurs.\n\nBILL POINT, a subset of the larger BLORD GROUP is one of the leading Android and IOS payments service applications that enables users to easily and securely pay for various bills and subscriptions including electricity, internet, airtime, data bundles, education bills, cable TV and Airline tickets at the comfort of your home, at the office or on the go.\n\nAs a smart and very intelligent entrepreneur, BLord saw the need of the society at a critical time during the inglorious days of the Naira colorization policy, which led to the scarcity of Naira notes, bank apps congestions, failures in transactions, and disruptions in the financial system in Nigeria which made it very difficult for people to make payments, buy airtime and data plus subscriptions to online services. BILL POINT was at the time the best option of the hassles for many.\n\nIts user-friendly experience with many customers and a 110% military-grade safe security tight system protection for personal and financial information is a top priority at Billpoint. The platform saves time, and effort and ensures that transactions are processed quickly, accurately, 24/7 whenever and wherever it’s convenient for you. Its reward for every referral earns both the new first-time subscriber who makes their first deposit and the referrer earning great rewards.\n\nIt was sure a groundbreaking moment for Bill Point at the Dublin Tech Summit held May 31 to June 1, 2023, when Bill Point justified its value, attaining an impressive valuation of $ 40 million months after rejecting a $ 10 million buyout offer from a foreign investment group. This resounding status solidified Bill Point as the foremost bill payment app on a global scale and showcased the founder, BLords dogged belief in the app’s perspective.\n\n…like he would say: “Billpoint app is available on iPhone or Android. Download and enjoy”."
