        "text": "Okay, had a bidder on ebay that bought a nokia phone from me - in June.\n\nHe didn't even check what model he needed, so he got the wrong one. He called me up and yelled at me saying I was trying to screw him over. Then he talked to his provider who explained that he had the wrong model phone. His fault completely, but he continued to insist that I could not have had a cingular contract with that model of phone. I told him I'd send a copy of the contract and he disappeared for a couple months with no reply.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I get a message from Billpoint saying that they've received a complaint, so I called the courier and they forwarded me delivery confirmation information. I forwarded it on to Billpoint about 3 days later. Yesterday, I get a message that they're charging back on my bank account!!!! WTF?? :| This is so bullpoop.\n\nWhat can I do? They won't respond to any of my emails and I can't find any phone # to contact them at.\n\nDoes anyone have a contact #???\n\nAs far as I can figure out, this idiot will cost me\n\nmy 2 8260's he has\n\nthe money being taken back\n\nOVERNIGHT SHIPPING to NJ from Cali so he could get it before a weekend\n\nEbay fees, Billpoint fees\n\nchargeback fee!!!\n\nSo now instead of making some money, I'm gonna have to PAY money out of my pocket to this buttmonkey and he's gonna get to keep the phones????!!!!\n\nWTF?\n\nSomebody help me out please. I hate idiots like this.\n\n:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|\n\nOriginally posted by: DaveSimmons\n\nIf nothing else you can report him to eBay's SafeHarbor, though from what PsychoAndy says they're much less helpful to sellers than they used to be.\n\nIt's theft for the guy to keep the phones BTW, but obviously what you want is the chargeback to be re-reversed.\n\nYou mean they actually helped sellers at some point?\n\nI've dealt with Non paying bidders that hung me up on like $40,000 total. They didnt do S**T. I now have lawyers\n\n*evil grin*\n\n-PAB\n\nHow can I get the charge re-reversed?\n\nBillpoint still hasn't returned my many emails from yesterday morning!\n\nShould I contact my bank or something?\n\nIf anyone can lend advice, I would really like to hear it. I'm so pissed at this guy right now, mainly because of his attitude. I almost want to give up the money, let the chargeback occur, then press charges instead. :|\n\nOf course, money is always nice"
