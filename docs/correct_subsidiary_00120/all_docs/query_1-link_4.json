        "text": "I am fascinated by the accelerating pace of innovation occurring in digital payments. We are truly on the threshold of altering how we make transactions in a big way. I did a lot of research on digital payments and wrote in detail on this topic in a Medium post. For this LinkedIn post, I will narrow my focus to the history between eBay and PayPal.\n\nPayPal began in 1998 as a mobile payment company with wireless transactions on Palm Pilots but soon switched focus to online payments when it found a strong customer base on eBay. When PayPal came on the scene, eBay had established such a powerful auction platform that it soon became the de facto monopolist of the auction market. As such, eBay could rely on acquisitions to expand its geographic footprint and coast along as it dominated its seller-buyer platform. When eBay sellers began to enlist in PayPal however, eBay’s culture felt threatened and was ill prepared to innovate on the customer experience at the same speed as PayPal. PayPal created one innovation after the other such as sending payments using email addresses, reducing fraud by launching the first reverse Turing test, creating HTML payment buttons, and so on.\n\neBay responded by creating Billpoint which mimicked much of PayPal’s core functionality. Rather than building innovative features that reduced friction for customers, eBay resorted to cajoling users into adopting Billpoint by exerting more control over its platform. Some of eBay’s tactics included:\n\nOffering free listing days for using Billpoint\n\nCutting fees\n\nMandating use of Billpoint for its Stores sites\n\nForcing buyers to use Billpoint to contribute to the “Auction for America” fundraising campaign following Sept. 11\n\nRolling out a checkout button at the top of every listing that defaulted to Billpoint\n\nNot just eBay tried to defeat PayPal with marketing gimmicks and monopolistic power but also banks tried to pursue legal means against PayPal to classify it as a bank or as an unsecure service.\n\nSo why did PayPal survive this onslaught of attacks from entrenched players? The answer is that their customers repeatedly came to their defense in the form of exponential user growth (not to mention vehement repudiations of eBay’s actions on eBay’s discussion boards). PayPal maintained a customer-centric focus on building a platform that removed more and more friction for its customers.\n\nEventually eBay realized that its customers had chosen PayPal as their preferred payment solution and so eBay acquired PayPal. While this acquisition greatly improved the customer experience on eBay through platform integrations, eBay’s executives still did not make the decision to acquire PayPal solely for the benefit of its customers. Instead, the acquisition was made to regain control of their “shopping cart.”\n\nDuring the subsequent years under eBay’s ownership, PayPal experienced significant growth from greater integration and therefore adoption on eBay. However, PayPal spent a significant amount of resources in improving the shopping experience on eBay rather than focusing relentlessly on reducing friction for their core customers of the overall payments market.\n\nEnter Carl Icahn stage left. In Feb. 2014 Icahn publicly called for eBay to spin off PayPal as a separate company so as to “focus and empower independent management teams to most effectively build two very different business platforms, make economic decisions independent of each other and, most importantly, foster innovation.” Carl Icahn also quoted Elon Musk, another co-founder and former CEO of PayPal, who said, “It doesn’t make sense that a global payment system is a subsidiary of an auction website… It’s as if Target owned Visa….[PayPal] will get cut to pieces by Amazon Payments, or by others such as Apple and by startups if it continues to be part of eBay.”\n\nJohn Donahoe, eBay’s CEO, brushed off Icahn’s calls for separating the two businesses by labeling Icahn’s actions as “theatrics” and “charades.” After the debate died down, most spectators agreed that the event was indeed a short-term stunt by Icahn to drive up eBay’s stock price…until months later when eBay announced it would reverse course and spin off PayPal only 3 weeks after Apple Pay was announced."
