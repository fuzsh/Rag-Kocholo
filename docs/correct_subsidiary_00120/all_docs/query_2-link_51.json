All other communities in the Town of Hempstead are serviced by either private companies or villages.\n\nThe department offers tours and lectures at its East Meadow facility. This service is available to schools and senior groups, among others.\n\nNeed help paying overdue water bills?\n\nThe New York State Low Income Household Water Assistance Program assists low-income households who are in arrears on water bills. Visit the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) to see if you may qualify.\n\nWater Supply\n\nWater supply for the districts is drawn from 32 wells, of which 29 are located in the Magothy Aquifer. Three of the 32 wells are located in the Lido-Pt. Lookout Water District and are drawn from the deeper Lloyd formation. Wells range in depth from 487 feet to 1,285 feet and were installed between 1951 and 2012.\n\nIn 2020, the 32 wells produced 6,308,290,000 gallons (including Lido) of water. To deliver water to the department's 37,109 customers, there are 377 miles of water mains, ranging in size from 6 inches to 24 inches in diameter. The department has seven elevated and two ground storage tanks with a storage capacity of nine million gallons. In addition, the department maintains 3,317 fire hydrants.\n\nIn 2020, the average residential customer used approximately 144,271 gallons of water, a daily average of 395 gallons. All of the department's water meters are equipped to be read via a remote reading terminal, thus eliminating the need to enter a customer's home.\n\nWell and Distribution Samples\n\nThe Water Department routinely samples district wells and the distribution system. Laboratory tests were performed on thousands of water quality samples collected in 2020. These tests monitor various inorganic, organic, and microbiological constituents listed in New York State's drinking water standards. All tests performed at district wells and from the distribution system met all of the current state and federal drinking water standards."
