        "text": "AJ, the co-host of Connecticut’s most popular morning show “Chaz and AJ in the Morning” on 99.1 PLR and 95.9 the FOX, will live for 24 hours in a tiny glass box at McDermott Chevrolet and Lexus of New Haven. AJ will get into the box at 9am on Thursday, November 9th, and come out exactly 24 hours later on Friday November 10th at 9am. While living in the box, he will be forced to listen to “It’s a Small World” on repeat.\n\nThis is all to raise money for the annual Chaz and AJ McDermott Chevrolet and Lexus of New Haven Toy Drive happening on December 8th at Jordan’s Furniture in New Haven, featuring national recording artists Foghat (playing their hits “Slow Ride,” “Fool for the City,” “Run, Run Rudolph” and more) and Finger Eleven (performing a special acoustic set), plus Senator Blumenthal, and over ten Connecticut mayors.\n\nThis yearly event raises toys and cash for five local Connecticut charities that serve children in need. Chaz and AJ have been doing an annual Toy Drive since 2003 and have raised over 2 million dollars for local charities.\n\nDonations can be made in person and at wplr.com and 959thefox.com. “Let’s raise the most money for this event ever! Let’s help these kids have a happy holiday!” AJ said. Chaz added, “It’s a fun way to help kids who are in very difficult situations in our own back yards.”\n\nTo arrange for press coverage of the event, please contact Drew Carrano at 203-783-8334. Connoisseur Media owns market-leading radio clusters in regions including Nassau-Suffolk, NY, Metro Fairfield CT, New Haven CT, and Frederick, MD.\n\nThe future of AM radio was the talk of the 2023 NAB show. WHLI-AM staff discussed the importance of the AM band, and how it serves the Long Island market. The following is an excerpt from Radio Ink, which covered the panel.\n\nThe first panel delved into winning content strategies for AM radio, featuring insights from Perry Publishing and Broadcasting GM Kevin Perry as well as WHLI-AM Program Director/Brand Manager Jon Daniels, and Production/Creative Services Director Sean Lynch. The panelists discussed the unique challenges and opportunities that AM radio presents, especially in a landscape where FM often takes the spotlight.\n\nDaniels posed the question of whether strategies effective for FM radio could also work for AM, noting that AM stations are often overshadowed by their FM counterparts. Lynch recounted how WHLI-AM was crucial during emergencies like Hurricane Sandy, providing real-time updates on flooded roads and blackouts. Daniels echoed this sentiment, stating that radio stations serve as a lifeline during crises, offering both real-time information and a sense of calm.\n\nPerry discussed the importance of AM radio to under-served communities, such as immigrants who prefer AM for its content and music available in their native languages.\n\nLynch stressed the importance of modernizing the sound and imaging of AM stations to make them seem as cutting-edge as their FM counterparts. Daniels added that reducing the frequency of ads could significantly improve listener experience, using the example of a station that went from eight stopsets an hour to just two.\n\nradioink.com\n\nRead the entire article at Radio Ink.\n\nConnoisseur Media with New Haven Pizza School have partnered to present a first of its kind Pizza & Brew Fest this summer.

Aimee takes over weekdays between 11am and 2pm, beginning Monday, June 26. Brooks brings with her a wealth of rock knowledge and experience making her the perfect fit for the “everything that rocks” format.\n\n“This is a big win for The Shark,” said Rob Rush, 94.3 The Shark Program Director and Afternoon Drive host. “Aimee lives and breathes the rock culture and I know our audience will love her passion and genuine appreciation for the music during the workday.”\n\nBefore joining 94.3 The Shark, Brooks spent seventeen years at Rock 104.7 WIOT in Toledo, Ohio, has experience in multiple markets around the country and is excited to bring her voice and talents to Long Island’s 94.3 The Shark. She grew up listening to music, usually at full blast, loves New York, loves coffee, plays guitar, and rescues kittens.\n\n“I am beyond excited to join the team at 94.3 The Shark!” I want to thank Patrick Shea and Rob Rush for bringing me on board. I’ve been grinning ear to ear for the past week. I’m looking forward to spending middays on Long Island!”\n\nAimee Brooks\n\nJennifer Grullon is added as co-host in the afternoon on STAR 99.9 (WEZN-FM). Jennifer comes to Connecticut from Burlington VT and will join market vet Kevin Begley. Jennifer remarked, “I could not be more excited to join Kevin Begley at Star 99.9. Thank you to the whole team at Connoisseur Media for challenging me with this wonderful opportunity!” Kevin and Jenna will debut on air May 15th for what will be a fun, fast moving, local focused “morning show in the afternoon” style program.\n\nEd Oliveira is upped to a new a role of overseeing “Ferocious Content” which is the video arm of Connoisseur Media. Ed will continue to manage the production, traffic and continuity departments within the CT cluster. “I have had the pleasure of working with Ed for over twenty years from Richmond to Boston and for the last 12 here in CT,” said Vice President of Programming Keith Dakin, “And he is one of the most forward-thinking guys I’ve ever met. Putting him in charge of our video production was a no brainer move.”\n\nWith Ed moving up the ladder, Andrew Krause, who is currently assistant production director, moves into the role of production director. Andrew is a homegrown talent having started as an intern and working his way through almost every job in the building. Dakin added, “Andrew is an incredible dedicated employee and great with clients. This is a perfect fit for him.”\n\nConnoisseur Media Long Island donated its studio offices to the Companions in Courage Foundation for the fourth year in a row to host the annual “Santa Connection”. The Santa Connection serves pediatric patients across their “Courage Network” with a one-on-one live video chat with Santa. Many of these children are isolated in the hospital and cannot visit Santa at the mall. Patients are joined by family members and their caretakers for a few moments of “normal” holiday cheer. The Child Life Specialists at the hospitals prime Santa with details about each patient, so each visit is incredibly personalized.\n\nThe Santa Connection broadcasted from the Connoisseur Media Long Island studio offices on December 7th and 8th, 2022. Years ago, when the pandemic shut down the Santa\n\nConnection studios in New York City, Connoisseur Media Long Island offered space in the Farmingdale studio offices to connect Santa “from the North Pole” via video chats with patients across the “Courage Network.” It’s been an annual tradition ever since.\n\nThe Companions in Courage Foundation was originally founded by NHL Hall of Famer, Pat LaFontaine in 1997. They are recognized as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization and eligible to receive donations. In just the last five years, their efforts have provided interactive playrooms, called “Lion’s Dens”, in hospitals throughout North America. Through innovative communications tools, these playrooms replace the isolation of a hospital with a connection to family, friends and celebrities during each hospital stay. By virtue of their location (primarily in major metropolitan areas), children’s hospitals tend to be safety nets to the most vulnerable in our society. On average, these facilities devote almost half of their care to children of low-income families. Their “Lion’s Den” rooms were designed by Edwin Schlossberg and his renowned ESI Design team in New York City.\n\n“I’ve always said that it’s important to score your goals early in life, because later on, it’s all about the assists! Our partnership with the kind team at Connoisseur Media has brought smiles and good cheer to pediatric patients for almost two decades. That’s the kind of teamwork that means the most to me and to Long Island!”\n\nPat LaFontaine\n\n“We first connected with Companions in Courage about 17 years ago with event marketing and promotional support,” said David Bevins, Connoisseur Media COO and Long Island Market Manager. “The Santa Connection is truly an inspiring program and their team is welcome to host it from our studio offices annually.”\n\nConnoisseur Media Long Island is a proud long-term partner of the Companions in Courage Foundation. Their mission is simple: no child in the fight for life or health should ever have to go through it alone. The Companions in Courage Foundation provides courage, friendship, compassion and support to those children and families who are overcoming illness and life-threatening obstacles.\n\nLong Island Uncle Giuseppe’s Marketplace during the month of November to donate food and/or funds for Long Islanders who need food assistance.\n\nIn support, WALK 97.5 hosted a special live broadcast on November 17th, from 5am until 7pm, at the Uncle Giuseppe’s Marketplace in Port Jefferson Station. Over the course of the day, WALK 97.5’s on-air appeal and in-store promotion produced 17,589 pounds of food collected for Long Island Cares. Additionally, in-store monetary donations raised $10,557.14 for Long Island Cares.\n\n“This is the 22nd year WALK 97.5 was able to use our airwaves to collect a large amount of food to support our friends and neighbors who receive help from Long Island Cares,” said Patrick\n\nShea, Program Director and midday personality on WALK 97.5. “It’s a tradition I look forward to each and every year.”\n\nThe WALK 97.5 Thanks-For-Giving food drive is a month-long effort with dozens of food drives anchored by an annual live broadcast event. 2022 welcomed Uncle Giuseppe’s Marketplace to the campaign as the host sponsor offering both WALK 97.5 and Long Island Cares the opportunity to be on-site in their stores working with their staff and customers for the betterment of Long Island.\n\nCheck out the video recap!\n\nLong Islanders loved when WALK 97.5, the radio station that they listened to every day, began playing nothing but holiday music. After tremendous joyful feedback, an annual tradition was born and since then, celebrating the holidays on Long Island has meant tuning the radio in your car, office, or business to WALK 97.5 for the perfect holiday soundtrack.\n\nWALK 97.5 will once again play non-stop holiday music through Christmas Day. The moment when WALK 97.5 officially switches over to holiday music varies each year and the ceremony surrounding “hitting the big red button” is always unique. To celebrate the 21st anniversary of this tradition, WALK 97.5 is adding star power to make it EXTRA SPECIAL!\n\nOn Friday November 18th at 5 P.M., WALK 97.5 afternoon host Christina Kay will officially usher in the holiday season with the help of The Backstreet Boys! WALK 97.5 will play The Backstreet Boys’ new holiday song “Last Christmas” from their new holiday album “A Very Backstreet Christmas.” Christina, said, “Hitting that ‘Big Red Holiday Button’ is one of my favorite traditions. It just makes it feel like the holiday season is finally here! “Some of the biggest acts in music have helped me kickoff holiday music on WALK 97.5; but when I heard that The Backstreet Boys accepted our invitation…it sent needle on my Holiday Spirit “Clausometer” over 110%! This year is going to be extra special!”\n\nJovia Financial Credit Union continues their partnership as the presenting sponsor of Long Island’s Holiday Music Station. “WALK 97.5 has been the soundtrack for the holidays on Long Island for decades, and listeners are as excited now as they have ever been. The biggest question is when will WALK 97.5 start? I am really happy to be able to give people an answer. Now I just want to hear requests,” said Patrick Shea, Program Director for WALK 97.5.\n\n“The best place for Long Islanders to listen to festive holiday music from now through the new year is WALK 97.5 FM. This has become an annual tradition of its own and Jovia Financial Credit Union is ecstatic to be the presenting sponsor for the sixth consecutive year,” noted Renu Dalessandro, Jovia Financial Credit Union’s Chief Marketing Officer. “Jovia is committed to the communities we serve, and together with Connoisseur Media, we’re making the season merry and bright.”"
