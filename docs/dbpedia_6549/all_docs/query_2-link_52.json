        "text": "WEEK 1\n\nAs late summer arrived, The Dead Daisies hit the road in the US, returning for the third season in a row. This time, they were guests of legendary rockers Whitesnake, as they travelled from New York to the southern states, through Texas and finishing off in the mid-western city of St Louis. Enlisted for the tour rhythm guitarist, Damon Johnson from Black Star Riders added his flavour to the collective.\n\nLike every tour, the band would achieve another list of firsts. On this trek they made their first appearance in a morning TV show with a live audience, as well as venturing to the World’s most famous playground in Orlando, Florida to play the Hard Rock Live at Universal Studios for the first time.\n\n“Playing with some of the best fricken musicians on the Planet,\n\nhow could you not be happy!” – Marco Mendoza\n\nIt had been nearly a year since The Dead Daisies toured the US making big waves and now they were back with an even higher profile line-up including former Mötley Crüe singer John Corabi, so there was much anticipation in the camp ahead of the first show with Whitesnake in the NYCB Theatre, Westbury in New York State. A busy day would see members of the band doing pre-gig interviews with ‘Loudwire’ and WWSK The Shark 94.3 Radio in Farmingdale.\n\nOn-stage, with a brand-new album ‘Revolución’ to promote, the band led by John Corabi continued in the same way they had electrified audiences in Europe with a series of explosive performances through the theatres, clubs, amphitheatres and arenas. Songs like ‘Mexico’, ‘Midnight Moses’ and ‘Devil Out of Time’ seeped into the hearts of the American rock fans who witnessed the band take on a new life on this tour.\n\nAs the band travelled down the East Coast, next stop was the College Street Music Hall in New Haven where once again, the band ripped up the stage with another blistering hot performance. Just like a tornado crashing its way down the coast, the band left a serious impression on all that stood in the way of The Dead Daisies musical hurricane.\n\nMoving on to Jacksonville for a few days, the band kicked off with a television appearance at First Coast Living, where John Corabi, Marco Mendoza and Richard Fortus performed an acoustic rendition of ‘Mexico’. The show which beams across northern Florida was a great way to introduce the band to a new audience. The show at the Florida Theatre once more saw a large conversion of new Daisies fans after they witnessed the full power of the band live on stage.\n\nWEEK 2\n\nAfter the show in Melbourne, Florida, a few days rest and play camped at Universal Studios in Orlando, was enough to recharge the band for their next show at Hard Rock Live. As with most gigs on this tour, promotional work was always important especially with the release of a new album. The band stopped off at Hard Rock Radio Live as well as visiting Promo Only, Inc to shoot some videos to promote the new release.\n\nExperiencing the sights and sounds and the make-believe of the Universal theme parks, along with some great music from The Dead Daisies and Whitesnake made for the perfect day out for any rock fan. The band were on fire, taking the stage to ‘Mexico’ which continued to gain popularity live and on-air throughout the tour. With a set that covers both old classics and soon-to-be classics, John Corabi once more took control of the stage while the band hammered out the power chords! Guest guitarist Damon Johnson added his own style to the mix. The fireworks that exploded over the Universal Park skyline, were a good metaphor for The Dead Daisies performance exploding onto the stage. They left the audience wanting more.\n\n“So in the end, ask yourself this, when was the last time\n\nyou saw a six-pack of eccentric world-class musicians,\n\nthat took four parts of vocal harmonies, two gritty guitars,\n\na pounding of bass & drums, added in some acoustic\n\npiano/electric keys, put it in the blender of life and\n\npoured it down your face into your heart? The answer?\n\nProbably never.” – knac.com\n\nMoving on to the West Coast of Florida and Clearwater where many rock fans come to retire, Richard, Marco and John were guests on Studio 10 in nearby Tampa. An acoustic version of ‘Mexico’ followed by an interview with 96-K Rock Radio was the next piece of promotion for the album ‘Revolución’. Capped off with another phenomenal performance at the Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, the band would head back out on the road.\n\nLeaving Florida in their wake, The Dead Daisies headed for Marksville, Louisiana to continue the Revolución journey. The show was at the Paragon Casino Resort. Once again, another rock crowd experiencing their very first taste of The Daisies rock and roll. The show like most nights on this tour was loud, tight and totally kicking ass! The band were on fire. Although it was a short set, the songs and hooks spoke for themselves, which is why you saw see a continual stream of new Daisy fans after every show eager to get their hands on the new album which was evident to see as they lined-up to meet the boys after their show. Next up the band would head for Texas!\n\nWEEK 3\n\nMidland, Texas was next on the itinerary for some classic rock! Around 8pm, as with every show night, it was time to put on the war paint, (or eyeliner in the case of Marco Mendoza) and head for the stage. As the lights went down and the thumping bass and guitar chords of ‘Mexico’ started stabbing out, the guys took to the stage to a warm welcome. Forty minutes of great guitar riffs, Hammond organs and solid rhythms fronted by John Corabi’s voice was more than enough to convince the Midland crowd that The Dead Daisies mean business.\n\nThe band appeared on Great Day Houston, a popular local television show where they performed and gave the audience a taste of what to expect at the show at The Concert Pub North where they would perform later as well as tickets and a copy of the new album!\n\n“Touring with Whitesnake has been great.\n\nThey are all such nice guys and the set list is amazing.\n\nI’m a huge Purple fan, so it’s a thrill to hear David sing\n\nthose songs. I don’t think I could have picked\n\na better set list.” – Richard Fortus\n\nThe Houston show was the only night of this tour when The Dead Daisies temporarily jumped off the Whitesnake trek to fly solo and headline their own. The performance started early with Marco Mendoza, John Corabi and Richard Fortus heading off to radio station KGLK/Houston The Eagle (Classic Rock) where they would chat and play unplugged.\n\nThe Concert Pub North is well known in the Houston area with many artists passing through. For The Daisies it was a more ‘in-your-face’ kind of venue compared to the larger theatres they were playing with Whitesnake on this tour, allowing them to really get close to the audience and playing a much longer set than normal. Hitting the stage at the much later time of 11pm, ‘Mexico’ exploded into life followed by most of the usual set including ‘Midnight Moses’ ‘Looking For The One’ and ‘Helter Skelter’ with more cuts than a teen slasher movie being thrown in to the mix, mainly from the new album to cover 75 minutes of loud and anthemic music. With the musical ‘Revolución’ continuing throughout this tour and now in their own shows, it is easy to see the popularity of the band grow literally in front of your eyes.\n\nFor the final nights of the tour, David Lowy returned to take up his rightful place as the Rhythm King to Fortus, who plays like a lead guitarist possessed by their instrument.\n\nArkansas was the next state to feel the Revolución. The Dead Daisies arrived in Rogers, Arkansas on Saturday to rejoin the Whitesnake tour at the Walmart Amphitheater. Arriving on the stage at about 7.20pm in the bright sunshine the band and started to generate their own heat with their opening song. A short, sharp and decisive set including all the regular classics like ‘Hush’ and ‘Midnight Moses’ with more from the new album followed. Once again, the crowd who were discovering The Dead Daisies for the first time were converted as they headed for the merchandise stand to grab their very own copy of Revolución!\n\nClosing the curtain of the tour in St Louis, home city of Richard Fortus, The Dead Daisies finished the tour the same way they started it, Arriving on the stage like a detonated explosive and leaving with a trail of new fans in their wake."
