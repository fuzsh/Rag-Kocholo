        "text": "RADIO ONLINE | Wednesday, March 31, 2021\n\nWWSK (94.3 FM The Shark)/Long Island morning host Brian Orlando has dedicated his life to music and amplifying the importance of mental health. Through his #Choosesong initiative, which he launched last year at the height of the pandemic and social isolation, he is successfully combining both of his passions by encouraging others to seek solace in the power of song.\n\nReminding listeners that \"with music you are never alone,\" Orlando has recently unveiled his second all-star artist collaboration with Vinnie Dombroski and Andy Patalan (Sponge), Brendan B Brown (Wheatus), Long Island favorites Black Suit Youth and a special appearance and message from the legendary \"King Of Rock\" DMC for their rendition of the iconic Stevie Wonder hit \"I Just Called.\" A quarantine-style video was also released here.\n\n\"I got the idea for the quarantine video message when Vinnie from Sponge told me one of his favorite memories was singing the song with Brendan (Wheatus) over the phone to my Grandmother for her birthday,\" said Orlando. \"When I asked Darryl (McDaniels \"DMC\") to be a part of it and explained the mission statement of reminding people that their voice can be a healing factor to others, he responded 'no problem, it's our obligation' and he had the verse done three hours later.\""
