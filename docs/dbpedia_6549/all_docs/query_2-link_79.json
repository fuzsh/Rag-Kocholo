        "text": "The Town of Huntington recently acquired twelve acres of open space in Greenlawn. While valued as a natural habitat, the property also has a long history dating back to the early eighteenth century when it was owned by Charles Saxton, who sold a portion of his land to Jeremiah Smith in or about 1719. An easement to allow Saxton access to Smith’s property to clear a drainage ditch refers to the earlier land transfer.[i]\n\nBut the property is known for its connection to the Brush family. Thomas Brush was a farmer in West Neck who, in addition to his farm at West Neck, owned land in Old Fields (now Greenlawn). When he died in 1862, he bequeathed to his son Samuel the large farm in Old Fields “where he now resides.”[ii] The 1858 atlas lists “S. Brush” in that location. Samuel’s brother James owned the farm to the east across Old Field Road.\n\nSamuel Brush was born in 1807 in Huntington. He married Elizabeth Sammis in 1835. Two years later, he acquired six acres from Moses Rogers on the west side of the road leading from “Centre port to the Old Fields” bounded on the east and south by the road, on the west by land owned by someone whose name is illegible and on the north by land of Henry Lewis.[iii] Six years later he acquired from William Smith 20 acres of partly enclosed arable land and partly timber land near Centerport bordered on the south and west by an old road, on the north by the timber land of Henry Lewis and on the east partly by other land Brush already owned and partly by the highway leading from Centerport to Old Fields.[iv] From the descriptions given in the deeds, these two tracts would appear to include at least part of the current 12-acre subject property.\n\nAn inspection of the original part of the house indicated a construction date in the 1830s, which is consistent with the date of Brush’s marriage and his acquisition of the property described above.\n\nSamuel’s son Samuel Brush, Jr., who was born in 1845, and his wife Anna lived with him on the farm when he was widower (his wife died in 1864).[v] Father and son were both farmers.[vi] Samuel Brush Jr. inherited the farm when his father died in 1881.\n\nIn 1905, Samuel Brush, Jr. sold the 116-acre farm to Frederick A. Phelps of Brooklyn.[vii] Phelps was a land speculator who acquired hundreds of acres of land in the Centerport-Greenlawn area as an agent for Dean Alvord, the developer of Prospect Park South in Brooklyn and Belle Terre in Port Jefferson. Locally, he subdivided land overlooking Northport Harbor, known as Cedarcroft. Part of that subdivision became the Grace Estate, and a part of that property including a log cabin, is now Town of Huntington parkland.\n\nPhelps did not intend to live in the house and his acquisition of the property saw its transformation from a working farm to a wealthy gentlemen’s farm, where horses, sheep and show dogs would be raised. Two years after he acquired the property, Phelps sold it to Harrison Gilmore of Utica. Gilmore was a successful coal dealer in western New York[viii] and did not intend to live in the house year round—it would be a summer retreat. Gilmore hired William A. Davis to work as foreman on the farm.[ix] In 1912, Gilmore sold 12½ acres at the southern end of the farm to Claire A. Knapp of Bellport;[x] and the northern parcel of about 80 acres to Francis C. Hicks of Philadelphia.[xi]\n\nClaire Knapp, who was only 23 years old at the time, was from an old Fairfield, Connecticut family. Her grandfather made a fortune in the printing business in Brooklyn and was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Her father Joseph Palmer Knapp followed his father in the printing business, merging the family company with others to form American Lithograph Company, later known as ALCO. Joseph P. Knapp also acquired and started several newspapers and magazines, including Everyweek magazine and Collier’s Weekly.\n\nAccording to one account, Joseph P. Knapp purchased the Greenlawn property for his ex-wife, who divorced him in 1903, and his two children; and spent $75,000 fixing it up. [xii] The work included adding a large wing to the west side of the old Brush farmhouse. An article in December 30, 1914 editions of The American Architect shows the historic house with the new west wing forming an L shaped house. The new wing contained a spacious living room and dining room on the first floor and a large master bedroom on the second floor. The original deed was to Claire Knapp; but within a year, she transferred the property to her father.\n\nMiss Knapp, operating under the name Clairedale Farm, raised show dogs—and cats.[xiii] She apparently moved the operation to Mastic in 1916, where she later eloped with her chauffer (but that’s another story). The same year, Joseph Knapp leased the farm to Baron de Stackelberg of Russia for the summer.[xiv] A year later, the Knapps sold the 12½-acre property to Annie Brinley, the widow of Captain Edward Brinley of Greenlawn subject to a $15,000 mortgage held by Joseph Knapp.[xv] Edward Brinley, a member of the Annapolis class of 1880, had died just six months earlier.\n\nThe property then changed hands several times over the next thirty years. Brinley sold the property to James G. Hall of Garden City in 1924.[xvi] Just three years later Ida Bell Hall of Coronado, California (presumably the heir of James G. Hall) conveyed the land to Waldron and Rey Belknap of Manhattan.[xvii] The Belknaps also acquired a 76½-acre parcel to the north reuniting the property to close to its original size. Waldron Belknap was a vice president of the Bankers Trust Company. As a young man, he had been a member of Manhattan’s Squadron A Cavalry unit, whose Brooklyn rival, Squadron C, had a summer farm in Huntington. He re-enlisted in 1916, at the age of 43, to serve in World War I.\n\nIn 1946, Rey Belknap, now residing at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, sold the 12½-acre southern portion of the property to Henry Sanford of Smithtown Branch for $50,000.[xviii] Two years later Henry Sanford conveyed the property to Anne N. Sanford.[xix]\n\nAnne Sanford married Dr. Walter T. Carpenter and transferred ownership of the property to him in 1977.[xx] Dr. Carpenter was the first board-certified pediatrician in Suffolk County. He was born in Brooklyn in 1911. After graduating from Cornell Medical School, he volunteered as a ship’s surgeon during World War II and later joined the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, he set up his pediatric practice in Greenlawn. He enlarged the east wing to the house in the 1950s for his medical practice.\n\nDr. Carpenter died in October 2008. His estate had the house and outbuildings demolished in 2010 in order to save the expense of insurance and taxes.\n\n[i] Suffolk County Clerk’s Office Deed Liber X, page 85\n\n[ii] The Descendants of Thomas and Richard Brush of Huntington, Long Island, compiled by Stuart C.

For 175 years, the spit of land now known as Eagle Dock Community Beach was a center of commercial activity. With the removal of the oil storage facility to the north of the beach, the area is returning to its bucolic past.\n\nThe east side of Cold Spring Harbor was known in the nineteenth century as Clamtown because of the abundance of clams found in the local waters. Oysters were also harvested here. But it was commercial activity that defined the area.\n\nAs early as the 1830s, a steamboat dock was built near the north end of the spit of land known as Middle Beach—now the site of the community beach. Walter R. Jones and John H. Jones acquired this parcel and the adjoining land to the north from the Huntington Board of Trustees in 1837. The outline of the dock can be seen on the 1837 Coastal Survey of Long Island. From this dock, the steamboat American Eagle made three trips a week into New York. The side-wheel steamboat carried passengers and freight on its regular run and also was used to tow whale ships in and out of the harbor when tides and wind conditions required. One passenger in 1843 wrote of his trip aboard the American Eagle. The ship left Cold Spring Harbor at 5:00 on a Monday morning. There were stops in Oyster Bay, Glen Cove and New Rochelle before reaching Fulton Market pier at 9:30. During the four and a half hour ride, the passengers enjoyed a hearty breakfast and a very good cup of coffee—“the best cup of coffee that is made in the ‘nine counties’,” according to the correspondent.\n\nThe American Eagle was retired in 1845 and replaced by the Croton. Seven years later a new dock was built at the southwest corner of Lloyd’s Neck and the Croton used that dock saving passengers 45 minutes. By 1873, the dock used by the American Eagle was identified on a survey as “Old S.B. Dock.”\n\nBut Middle Beach had not been abandoned. Around 1860, John P. Dole established a ship salvage yard south of the old steamboat dock. Over the next 25 years, Dole would purchase old wooden boats, some from the U.S. Navy, and salvage what useable material he could. The most valuable commodity was the metal hardware. Larger timbers were used to build houses. After all that could be salvaged was removed, the ship’s carcass was burned. The spectacular fires drew large crowds along Shore Road. Reportedly, Cornelius Vanderbilt’s famous yacht, The North Star met its demise at Dole’s Beach.\n\nBy the 1870s, Cold Spring Harbor had become a resort community. Grand hotels—Laurelton, Glenada and Forest Lawn—and smaller boarding houses attracted New Yorker seeking to escape the heat of the city. What better way to start a vacation than with a steamboat ride? With that in mind Dr. Oliver Jones decided to rebuild the old steam dock, this time with a causeway across the cove to reach shore road. At the time, the cove extended as far north as the present day Beach Club property. Dr. Jones, whose obituary noted he had a hobby of building new roads, planned to extend the road through a ravine and on to Huntington village two miles away. The road was never completed east of Shore Road.\n\nDr. Jones used bricks from his yard at West Neck for fill, which explains the plethora of bricks in the area where the dock had been. The new dock was completed in 1885 and was named “Eagle Dock,” undoubtedly in honor of the first steamboat to ply Cold Spring Harbor’s waters. On the dock—which was really more of a bulkhead pier—was a freight house. The steamboat Sylvan Dell made the trip from Eagle Dock to Pier 23 in New York in two hours and fifteen minutes—half the time it took the American Eagle­ forty years earlier.\n\nA few years earlier (1881), Elwood Abrams leased from Charles H. Jones the land north of the dock for use as his shipyard. He had arrived in Cold Spring Harbor in 1868 and operated a shipyard further south on the harbor. Abrams eventually added a saw mill. He lived across Shore Road and there he operated an ice cream, soda, candy and tobacco store as well as a boarding house.\n\nIn the 1890s, there seemed to be no end to the activities at Eagle Dock:\n\nWilliam Bingham and Benjamin Brush opened a grocery store near the present site of the crew team’s boathouse in 1890. Bingham also had an ice house and imported ice from Maine when the local ice crop failed.\n\nA gentleman named Mason converted the old sail loft and ice cream saloon at Eagle Dock into a dance hall in 1891. Mason’s Eagle Dock Pavilion became a popular social gathering place.\n\nIn the late 1890s, T. Wilson Gildersleeve had a bowling alley at Eagle Dock. But it wasn’t until 1957, when he was 74 years old, that Gildersleeve bowled a perfect game and that was at the Commack bowling alley.\n\nIn 1896, the State fish hatchery started a lobster hatchery at Eagle Dock.\n\nWhen the grand old hotel, the Glenada was dismantled in 1906, the used lumber was shipped from Eagle Dock.\n\nIn 1908 when William K. Vanderbilt II invited motorist from Europe and across the country to come to Long Island to race their automobiles on Long Island’s rural highways, steamboats from Connecticut and Westchester brought passengers to Eagle Dock where they were met by stage coaches to take them to see the race from Woodbury turn—the corner of Jericho Turnpike and Woodbury Road. The next year, Eagle Dock welcomed the steamer Victor, which had been outfitted to take cars across the Sound from Stamford, CT.\n\nDuring Prohibition, Eagle Dock was reportedly the drop off point for hundreds of cases of illicit liquor from Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, the Abrams shipyard continued to be busy. Instead of building ships, the yard was now mostly involved with repairing yachts and storing them for the winter. Abram’s saw mill was considered one of the best and largest on Long Island.\n\nThe land on which Eagle Dock and Abrams shipyard were located continued to be owned by the Jones family. The rest of Middle Beach to the south as well as the land under the cove had been acquired by Henry DeForest in 1879. DeForest acquired hundreds of acres of uplands reaching from Shore Road to Goose Hill Road. The last 31 acres of that estate is now being offered for sale.\n\nThe DeForest land on Middle Beach had, according the 1952 estate appraisal of the property, “a summer beach house and shacks with no market value.” DeForest also had a small engine, known as a donkey engine, that would pull his yacht, the 8 meter sailboat Priscilla III, along rails to the beach for winter storage. Remains of the engine and rails can still be seen. The house at the north end of the DeForest property on Middle Beach (about where the “pirate” ship is today) was the home of George Shellack, who was the captain on the DeForest boats during the summer and their chauffer during the winter. There were three other buildings, all on stilts. The largest, near the donkey engine, was where all the yachting paraphernalia was kept. A second was home to two young bachelors who helped with the DeForest boats. The third is where the maids from Johnston DeForest’s house (the white house behind the pond) changed their clothes when they went to swim every afternoon during the summer. The Dole family had a boathouse on the beach between the three shacks and the Shellack’s cottage.\n\nThe Deforests also had a small floating building moored along Shore Road opposite the driveway to their mansion, Wawapeck. They kept rowboats and canoes in the house, which they used to get out to the spit.\n\nThe DeForest family allowed Cold Spring Harbor residents to use their beach for swimming. The Cold Spring Harbor Civic Association raised money to fund the operation of the beach. Access was across the road built by Dr. Jones to the old Eagle Dock.\n\nIn July 1922, Rosalie Jones, acting as executor for her mothers’ estate, offered several pieces of land, including the Eagle Dock property, for sale. The parcel was described as being “five acres in all” so it included the shipyard property as well. Walter Abrams, who had taken over the shipyard from his father, purchased the shipyard property from the Jones family for $50,000 in October 1922. Just two years later, Abrams sold the land to the Standard Oil Company of New York for $175,000. Abrams moved his shipyard to Halesite and it is now operated by the Knutson family. Interestingly, Abrams’ father was appointed an agent of Standard Oil in 1900 for the sale of naptha, a petroleum product used as a solvent and sometimes for fuel.\n\nLocal legend has it that the oil tanks were the result of the failure of the newly formed Beach Club to invite members of the Jones family to join. According to this story, Rosalie Jones convinced Walter Abrams, whose shipyard was supposedly struggling, to sell his land to her. She in turn sold the land to Standard Oil of New York, the rival of Standard Oil of New Jersey, whose president Walter Jennings was the founder of the Beach Club. But since the Jones family owned the land in 1921 when the Beach Club was formed and since the deed to Standard Oil was signed by Walter Abrams not Rosalie Jones, the accuracy of the legend has to be questioned.\n\nIn any event, until they were torn down in 2005, Standard Oil’s tank farm would be the last remnant of Clamtown’s industrial past.\n\nThe Jones family didn’t sell the old Eagle Dock property until 25 years after it sold the shipyard property. Dolores Brock purchased and just three months later sold the land to Harry Knight and August Carbone. Four months after they acquired the land, Knight and Carbone requested that the zoning on the property be changed from residential to business. The request was not met favorably by the neighbors.\n\nKnight and Carbone intended to use the property to rent boats, sell refreshments and operate a bathing beach for profit. They promised to tear down the existing old buildings and build a new dock and a refreshment stand and some bath houses. Almost 200 people showed up for a hearing before the Huntington Planning Board in June 1948—only two spoke in favor of the re-zoning. One of the supporters of re-zoning was none other than Rosalie Jones, who had argued unsuccessfully to have the property classified as business rather than residential when Huntington first adopted zoning laws in the early 1930s. Jones noted that many in the room were not natives of Cold Spring Harbor, yet they seemed wary of any development that would attract outsiders.\n\nOpponents were led by Johnston DeForest, who was one of the members of the commission that first proposed that Huntington should adopt a zoning ordinance. Where Knight and Carbone saw a refreshment stand, opponents saw a bar. Some saw the opposition as an attempt by wealthy residents to keep regular folks away from the town’s beaches.\n\nAfter a summer of controversy, the application for re-zoning was denied.\n\nOn September 23, 1948, 42 concerned residents gathered at the home of B. Tappen Fairchild on Shore Road. They resolved to form a charitable organization to purchase the Eagle Dock property and make it available to Cold Spring Harbor residents who did not have access to private beach facilities. At the time 80 residents had made pledges totaling $24,000. The beach would be available to residents of Cold Spring Harbor school district 8 at no charge. The corporation formed to purchase and maintain the beach would be “charitable and educational and exist for the general welfare of the people” of Cold Spring Harbor.\n\nOn October 21, 1948, seven residents formed Eagle Dock Foundation, Inc., the purpose of which was\n\nTo establish, equip, maintain and operate a public beach, playground and bathing facilities for the children and other residents of Cold Spring Harbor School District No. 8, to create and promote better under-standing and sympathy between the people of the community and to further the general welfare and health of all the people in the said School District.\n\nThe next month they purchased the 1.1-acre Eagle Dock property from Knight and Carbone for $22,293.11. It was reported that Knight and Carbone managed to turn a nice profit on the sale. In addition to the Eagle Dock property, which only included the roadway and the area between the current split rail fence and the Standard Oil property, the Foundation entered into a lease with Johnston DeForest for part of his property on the spit—the area up to the line of boulders near the current floating dock. The rent was one dollar a year.\n\nAn early concern of the donors was the tax-deductibility of their gifts. They were advised that no assurances could be made concerning deductibility, but that they should nonetheless claim the deduction on their tax returns. The IRS initially refused to allow the deduction. But one of the original supporters, Isabel Peters, pursued the case in Tax Court and in a landmark case finally prevailed in 1953. The IRS was reluctant to accept the outcome, but acquiesced six years later.\n\nFrom the beginning, the management of the beach was turned over to a committee of Cold Spring Harbor residents for the benefit of the children and families of Cold Spring Harbor. A management committee of seven local residents was appointed in time for the 1949 bathing season. The committee had the two old buildings near Shore Road torn down and a large amount of fill was brought in to level off the property and provide more space for playground and parking facilities. Leslie Peckham, who was the first chairman of the committee, writes in Clamtown, which was published in 1962, that the old bulkheads “were demolished during the recent landscaping at Community Beach. However, some of the piling was left standing—upon which rests a portion of the float ramp.” Peckham also writes about adding earth and “other fill” to the cove to widen the road built by Dr. Jones in 1885. (Standard Oil had filled in the Cove north of the road when it built its storage tanks in the 1920s.)\n\nThe committee relied on volunteer labor and volunteer contributions. In 1951 a new bathhouse, about the size of a garage, was built. Water was provided by Standard Oil from its property at no charge to the beach. On a year-to-year basis, beach privileges were extended to residents of school district 11 in Suffolk County. School district 8 was the old East Side district, while district 11 was the West Side district and also included Laurel Hollow. Over the years, the Foundation was concerned that Cold Spring Harbor’s growing population might preclude extending these privileges to district 11 residents. The border between the two districts was just north of Lawrence Hill Road. But eventually the privilege was made permanent.\n\nIn 1953, 195 families provided support for the beach, a second life guard was hired and the beach was opened seven days a week instead of just six.\n\nBeach finances relied on voluntary contributions from residents, all of whom were issued admission cards. Boy Scouts distributed pledge cards, but donations were slow to arrive. It was not until 1961, that stickers were issued for the privilege of parking at the beach.\n\nFrom the earliest days, vandalism, noise and unauthorized use were problems. In 1954, it was decided to lock the gate at night. In 1966, a high chain link fence was installed. (The driveway entrance was moved to the north end of the property in 1956 as an accommodation to the Fairchilds, who lived across the street.)\n\nJust a dozen years after its first season, Eagle Dock faced an existential crisis. New York State had just acquired the Marshall Field Estate in Lloyd Neck. The Parks Commission proposed building an extension of the Bethpage Parkway that would run up along Harbor Road and then along the east shore of Cold Spring Harbor—right over the beach. The Foundation was very concerned. The State made promises of either giving the Foundation money to buy other beach property—but where was there a beach to buy? —or to create a manmade beach along side the new parkway. The Foundation surprisingly did not take a position to either support or oppose the Parks Commission’s plans, in part because the plans were not yet final. But the Foundation did submit a memorandum to the Parks Commission outlining its concerns:\n\nThe shore route should not be chosen because it will destroy or impair the natural harbor which is the principal physical asset of the area.\n\nThe choice of the shore route does not take into account developments in transportation, such as monorails, helicopter, or hydrofoils, which may well be better methods of transportation to the new park before any route can be completed, and which would better serve the new park without spoiling the adjoining area.\n\nThe choice of the shore route, and the substitution of other property for the property presently owned by the Foundation, may impose annual charges for maintenance on the Foundation which it will not be able to meet.\n\nThe shore route raises practical problems regarding water and electric lines, the solution of which is unclear.\n\nThe issue was discussed every year at the Foundation’s annual meeting into the early 1970s, but no further information was provided by the Parks Commission. Perhaps bearing in mind that Sunken Meadow Park opened in 1929, but the parkway leading up to it was not completed until 1957, the Foundation’s ongoing concern was justified. The threat was not removed until 2004 when the Cold Spring Harbor Library secured a long-term lease from the Parks Commission for five acres on the proposed parkway right of way. With the community’s library standing in the way, the parkway would not be built.\n\nEven with the uncertainty presented by the proposed parkway, the beach thrived. But by the 1980s, the beach was at a crossroads. The dock built on the old pilings was destroyed by winter storms in 1981. A floating dock was built to replace it. In 1984, a reorganized and re-energized Management Committee announced plans for a major upgrade of the beach, including “dock restoration, landscaping, security enhancement, bathing beach improvement, and building restoration and improvement.” The community responded to appeals for donations to realize these plans.\n\nIn 1986, the beach made several strides. The sail locker was built and the floating dock was completed. But the most important development was Priscilla DeForest Williams’ decision to donate the rest of the spit as well as the land under the Cove and land on the water side of Shore Road to the Foundation on the condition that the land be kept forever wild.\n\nThroughout its history, Eagle Dock has been a place for Cold Spring Harbor residents to socialize with their neighbors. A long-standing tradition is the annual clambake in August. Over the years other events have been added to the calendar: Field Day, the Sunday Brunch, Dancing Under the Stars, S’Mores to mark the end of the school year, Wine & Cheese night, and even potluck parties.\n\nIn keeping with the terms of its charter that the beach was for the children of the community, in 2001, the Foundation entered into an agreement with the Cold Spring Harbor Rowing Club, the sponsor of the high school’s crew team. Pursuant to the agreement, the Rowing Association constructed a boathouse and uses Eagle Dock for its practices. The arrangement allows for greater use of the beach by the children of the community, without interfering with the swimming and boating that have always been the focus of beach activities.\n\nIn recognition of the importance of the fragile marine environment, in 2009, the Foundation—harking back to the educational aspect discussed at the Foundation’s 1948 organizational meeting—restated the beach’s mission statement:\n\nThe mission of Eagle Dock Community Beach is to establish, equip, maintain and operate a public beach, playground and bathing facilities for the children and other residents of Cold Spring Harbor and to promote a better understanding of the marine ecosystem of Cold Spring Harbor, including our beach and its surrounding coastal environs.\n\nEagle Dock Community Beach is dedicated to the protection of the marine ecosystem of Cold Spring Harbor in order to facilitate our continued access to a healthy waterfront. Through the conduct of environmental education programs, our community is engaged in the stewardship of this important natural resource.\n\nEnvironmental education programs have proven very popular and will help to ensure that the community remains sensitive to the need to protect its harbor. Although the removal of the oil tanks was a welcomed development, the removal of the oil dock has accelerated erosion of the beach property presenting new challenges. But with the community support Eagle Dock has enjoyed for the past sixty plus years, it is certain that the people of Cold Spring Harbor will continue to have a beach to call their own.\n\nOver the last half-century, the Town of Huntington and the County of Suffolk have assembled an impressive collection of open space totaling some 520 acres in the Crab Meadow section of Huntington. But a small portion of that land was acquired by the Town more than 350 years ago.\n\nUnder the Town’s colonial patents issued by various royal governors, the Trustees of the Town were granted all lands that constitute the town. Over the years, the Trustees sold almost all of the land. The few remaining trustee lands include the beach at Crab Meadow. As early as 1901, several residents had erected shacks on this beach.[1] In 1907, residents of the area sent a petition to the Town Board requesting the Town to remove the houses; “thereby giving all citizens of the Town the use of said property in common.”[2] The Huntington Board of Trustees retained attorney Willard Baylis to render an opinion on the legal status of these shacks. After examining records at the County Clerks’ Office as well as the Town Clerk’s Office, Baylis concluded that the Board of Trustees had never conveyed the lands at Crab Meadow beach. As a result, none of the persons who erected the structures on the beach “has any right in or title to such beach, and certainly their possession has not been long enough in time or of such character as to give any of them adverse rights against the Town, or its Trustees.”[3]\n\nThe beach in question extended from the highway leading south from the Sound (what we know as Waterside Avenue) east to the Gut or creek that flows out of the meadows south of the beach. Prior to 1890, the road jogged to the east and separated the Trustees’ land, which was on the east side of the road, from private land on the west side of the road. In about 1890, the road had been straightened, and as a result 196.7 feet of the private property along the Sound was now on the east side of the road.\n\nThat parcel was part of the land acquired by Willis B. Burt from William Chesebrough in 1900. Burt developed the land on the west side of the road as Waterside Park. On the beach on the east side of the road, Burt operated a private beach pavilion.\n\nAfter Baylis confirmed the Town’s ownership of the beach property east of Burt’s pavilion, residents petitioned the Town Board to maintain the beach as a public park and to appropriate $5,000 to equip and maintain the park. Proponents pointed out that most of the town’s waterfront was owned by private parties and was, therefore, inaccessible to the public. In fact, the Town’s only waterfront park at the time was Halesite Park, which had opened a dozen years earlier and had only 200 feet of shoreline along Huntington Harbor. The proposal was the subject of a special town wide referendum held in October 1919 at the Centerport firehouse. The two resolutions passed by a 4 to 1 ratio.[4] Once the park was established, Burt served as the manager of the park on behalf of the Town, in addition to operating his concession stand.\n\nUnfortunately, swimming at Crab meadow was not without risk. Northeast storms had built up a peninsula from the east side of the Crab Meadow Creek across the outlet of the creek, which diverted the flow of the creek westward directly in front of the town beach. The swift current created hazardous swimming conditions, especially for children. The dangers presented by this situation were brought to the Town’s attention as early as 1920,[5] but it would take decades before the problem was resolved.\n\nAn attempt in 1920 to cut a channel through the peninsula so that the creek would flow north into the Sound rather than along the beach was met with a letter from one of the owners of the adjoining land on the east side of the creek. Edwin H. Brown asserted that he and his partner Frank Lambert owned the peninsula. Lambert and Brown had purchased land on the east side of the creek in 1903.[6] They claimed ownership of the peninsula as an accretion of their property.[7] Brown warned the Town, “I hereby forbid the work above mentioned and give notice that if, as I believe, we can establish title to said land I shall claim and endeavor to collect damages if the work is continued.”[8]\n\nDespite Brown’s warning, the Town hired Burt to proceed with the work in 1923. Brown made good on his threat and sued. The case dragged on for the next twenty years during which time attorneys became ill, interested parties died, and settlement talks fell apart. All the while, the current caused by the peninsula continued to pose a threat to swimmers.\n\nIn the meantime, thousands of residents visited the beach each summer. Five years after voters approved a resolution to create a park at Crab Meadow, they approved another resolution to spend $20,000 to acquire Burt’s property on which he operated his pavilion.[9]\n\nBut the park’s popularity was not without its downside. Residents of Waterside Park complained about late night partying at the beach. Members of the Waterside Park Association, many of whom were Brooklynites with summer homes at Waterside Park, reported that young people would arrive at the beach late in the evening after the town’s beach pavilion had closed and they would stay until as late as 3:00 in the morning and sometimes until dawn. They asserted that “the hilarity and boisterousness that occasionally ensue not only cause serious discomfort, annoyance and disturbance, but are a distinct menace to the good name of the place.”[10] The problems of late night use of the beach continued—especially when there was a high tide after midnight. In 1926, the Town Board placed a police officer at the beach to help avoid the problems presented to nearby residents.[11]\n\nThere was also another private pavilion nearby. As early as 1929, Walter Post had opened Post’s Pavilion on Waterside Avenue just south of the town beach. Having a somewhat unsavory reputation in later years, Post’s Pavilion remained open until the late 1950s. It then was known as the Soundview Inn and burned to the ground in the early morning hours of June 7, 1963.[12]\n\nBurt’s old wooden pavilion was showing its age and as early as 1927 voters were asked to approve expenditures to replace it. The measure was defeated each time it was presented. But the need to create jobs during the Great Depression fit nicely with the need to improve the facilities at Crab Meadow beach. In 1937, the old pavilion was finally replaced with a Mediterranean style brick and concrete building designed by Huntington architect David Dusenberry that featured men’s and women’s locker rooms, showers and lavatories. The locker rooms would be in the two wings of the building that were joined by an open-air court. On the roof of the center portion was a sun deck. The cost of the building, which was a WPA project, was split between the State and the Town.[13] The new building also included food concessions. In front of the building, the Town built an 18 foot wide boardwalk extending 700 feet east and west of the pavilion.[14] The new building was ready for the opening of the 1938 season. As part of the dedication ceremony on May 28, 1938, a time capsule was placed in the cornerstone of the building.[15]\n\nThe building was a hit, a perfect compliment to the always-popular beach. However, the dangerous current created by the outflow from the creek continued to be a concern. Moreover, the erosion occasioned by the current threatened the new pavilion. In light of the failure of earlier efforts to reach a settlement in the matter, the Town Board voted to seize the offending sand bar by eminent domain. The action was, of course, challenged by the Brown and Lambert interests. By this time Edwin Brown and Frank Lambert had both died, but their estates continued to fight the Town. In 1942, the Town finally prevailed and paid Brown & Lambert $9,258.64 for the disputed sandbar.\n\nAfter a hurricane in 1944, the Town constructed a breakwater along the creek, which resulted in the accumulation of so much additional land that the Town was able to add parking for 120 to 150 additional cars.[16] The continued popularity of the beach—one neighbor compared it to Coney Island on a hot summer weekend—led the Town to acquire an additional eight acres south of the parking area for additional parking.[17] At the time private homes continued to stand on the south side of Waterview Street West, which now runs just past the entrance gate to the beach, but at one time extended as far as the creek.\n\nBut Brown & Lambert (or more accurately their estates) continued to own hundreds of acres of the meadow and uplands. On the higher ground to the south of the meadows, a golf course, known as the Northport Country Club, was laid out in 1923.[18] The club lasted only about twenty years and the abandoned clubhouse burned to the ground in 1949.[19]\n\nIn 1956, a private company with a public sounding name—Empire State Development Company, Inc.—acquired Brown’s interest. Justine Lambert, Frank Lambert’s widow and heir to the bulk of his estate continued as the co-owner. In all the years this tract was privately owned, it was never developed. Of course, the meadows were too wet to be easily developed, but the uplands where the Northport Country Club had been located could have been developed.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the Brown & Lambert holdings in Crab Meadow were one of the largest undeveloped lands in a fast growing town. In June 1961 the Town held a special election to vote on a proposed $2,500,000 park and recreation plan that would involve the acquisition of nine sites for parkland, including the Brown & Lambert holdings.[20] Town Supervisor Robert J. Flynn explained. “We are trying to solve our desperate need for space while the area is still available. If we wait much longer, we will have to take what the speculators leave us at costs that would be frightful.” The referendum failed by 548 votes out of 7,224 votes cast.[21]\n\nAt the same time, the Empire State Development Company instituted legal proceedings to clarify title to the property so that it could proceed with development plans.[22] In 1962, Justine Lambert and Empire State Development engaged in a bidding war at Town Hall. Bids were made for individual parcels and then the referee asked for bids for the entire tract. Lambert started at $705,000; Empire responded, only to be outbid by Lambert. The parties raised their bids by a thousand dollars a bid, sometimes four or five thousand dollars at a time. Until, finally, Lambert bid one million dollars. There was no response from Empire. [23]\n\nLambert said she intended to develop the property with luxury homes on lots of two to three acres—and no “split levels”—even though the Town had already announced plans for a re-vote on the parks referendum.\n\nIn September of that year, the parks referendum was put before the voters again and passed by an overwhelming majority, 5,272 to 1,815. The referendum covered only the cost of acquisition; it was estimated that it would cost another $3.8 million to develop the parks. The proposal for the Crab Meadow parcel included plans to dredge the meadow to create fresh water fishing lakes, restoration of the golf course, bridle paths, a salt-water marina and a wildlife refuge.[24]\n\nOf course, Lambert’s plans to develop the property were rendered moot by the passage of the referendum. Subsequent condemnation proceedings to establish the fair market value of the land did not commence until 1966. The case also involved title issues arising from the Town’s Colonial grants. The Town’s Board of Trustees claimed ownership of the waterways through the meadow under these patents arguing that their ownership had never been transferred. The Town prevailed and began making payments for the land in 1967.[25] The Town had hoped to acquire all the land between the Sound and a right of way established by the Long Island Lighting Company for its transmission lines, but there were not enough funds. However, in 1970, Suffolk County was persuaded to purchase the 140 acres along Makamah Road from the LILCO right of way to the meadows that the Town had not purchased earlier.[26]\n\nThe old Northport Country Club golf course was renovated and a new clubhouse was built overlooking the meadow.\n\nIn the 1980s, the town undertook an extensive renovation of the Crab Meadow beach pavilion. What had been a snack bar was expanded to a full service restaurant with the addition of greenhouse enclosures on the west side of the building. The boardwalk and gazebos were rebuilt, shuffleboard courts were added and lights were installed. When the work was done, the Town Supervisor and Town Board sent invitation to a 50-year “Golden Anniversary Celebration and Rededication of Crabmeadow Beach.” Cocktails and hors d’oeuvers were served. It is doubtful that anyone pointed out that the building was in fact only 48 years old.\n\nBy 2009, the WPA pavilion was showing its age. An engineering report indicated that the breezeway between the two wings was structurally unsound, perhaps because salt water was used to mix the cement when it was built. The Town replaced the breezeway with an exact replica. The bricks have not been painted so the building appears as it did when it was originally built. Another benefit is that the rooftop sundeck is once again open to the public.\n\nIn recent years, the Town has added additional parcels to its open space. The Ingraham Nature Preserve, which includes the Crab Meadow Burying Ground and which lies across Waterside Avenue, was added in 1998 with partial funding coming from the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company. The Fuchs property was purchased with Suffolk County in 2003.\n\nBut a question remains. Who were Brown and Lambert?\n\nFrancois Lambert was born in Lyons, France on June 13, 1851. He arrived in the United States in 1876. He was an inventor, eventually holding 60 patents. His first patent, secured in 1878, was for a striking mechanism for clocks. He also invented an early recording device, which appears to have been intended to be used for a talking clock. A recording of his voice announcing the hours of the day made in 1879 is the oldest surviving recording in the world.\n\nLambert’s most financially successful invention was of a water meter. He shared that 1887 patent with John Thomson. The Thomson Water Meter Company was based in Brooklyn. The company was sold to Neptune Water Meter Co. in 1925, netting Lambert $800,000 (the equivalent of about $10 million dollars in 2012). Later that year Lambert’s wife died.\n\nThe following June, the 74 year old Lambert married 30 year old Jennette Justine Lawson Ebbets, who had sold sheet music in Lambert’s son-in-law’s office. After a yearlong honeymoon in Europe, the couple moved from Brooklyn to the 22nd floor of the Savoy Plaza Hotel in Manhattan and later moved to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. A profile of Lambert notes that in his retirement “he owned several rental properties in Brooklyn, and some undeveloped land on Long Island.”[27]\n\nLambert died in 1937 and left the bulk of his estate to his young widow. Justine Lambert was apparently a successful investor and when she died in 1975, the fortune had grown to an estimated $15 million (or about $64 million in 2012 dollars). That explains why the widow of a man who had first purchased land in 1903 was still around in the 1960s and was able to coolly bid one million dollars to gain complete control over the hundreds of acres her husband had purchased so long ago.\n\nEdwin H. Brown was Lambert’s patent attorney. Born in Brooklyn to English parents the same year as Lambert was born in France, Brown graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1874. He became one of the most well regarded patent attorneys of his day. He retired in 1902 and traveled extensively, living in London for two years. When he returned in 1912 he focused his attention on his extensive real estate holdings, which he had acquired previously. He developed Addisleigh Park in St. Albans, Queens in 1892. Based on English garden suburb designs, the neighborhood features homes built in the Colonial Revival, English Tudor Revival and Arts and Crafts styles popular in the period from 1910 to 1930. Starting in the 1940s, the neighborhood became a popular place for jazz musicians. The Addisleigh Park Historic District was created by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2011.[28]\n\nBrown died in 1930.\n\n[1] The Brooklyn Eagle, June 9, 1901, page 36\n\n[2] Petition dated December 21, 1907 in the files of the Huntington Town Historian\n\n[3] Report of Willard N.
