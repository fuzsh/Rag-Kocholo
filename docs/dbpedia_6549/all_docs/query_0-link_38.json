        "text": "By Shannon Begley\n\nIt’s that time of year…we are officially in the holiday season! And that means lots of treats and cookies. But you can’t eat these cookies – GeoCookies! GeoCookies target mobile users based on historical location data. What does that mean? Well first, you know people are always with their phone. Where a consumer has been with their phone says a lot about their interests. Using location based data, and a past window of time, you can develop a list of devices to target that were in a specific geography, including mapping locations that are as small as a parking lot. You will need to identify several thousand devices to implement this strategy.\n\nGeocookies is a great digital tool because it allows you to target the right audience. This is important to your business because consumers are more likely to be interested when they are served relevant ads. It’s also an opportunity for your business to conquest competitor’s visitors, re-engage with your past customers, and even target individuals who attended a specific event, like a conference or convention. Another great thing is that with GeoCookies, your message only reaches people in the desired area that you are looking to target. Therefore, if someone is visiting a competitor, or event from out of state, an impression won’t be wasted on them. The other great thing about GeoCookies is that you can target more than one location.\n\nHere are a few examples of how your business can utilize this great digital tool.\n\nYou are a local business looking to reach moms with teenage daughters. A couple of months ago, Taylor Swift came through town on her Reputation Tour, you can GeoCookie her concert venue on the dates she had shows and serve ads to the mobile handsets that attended the concerts!\n\nYou are a store that sells soccer equipment and clothing. You know that there was a huge soccer tournament this past summer in your area. You can Geocookie all of the handsets that attended the event and serve them ads to promote your store’s inventory!\n\nThe best part about these GeoCookies, they are calorie free and get businesses like yours results!\n\nBy Erica Chludzinski\n\nIt’s hard – if not impossible – to stay relevant and top of mind if you’re not appearing in your target market’s Google searches. Why? Google processes over 40,000 searches every second. Among those searches are people looking for your business! But are they seeing your ad online? It is important for you to know where your ads are appearing on the search results page; that’s where Google Ad’s new search ad position metrics come in.\n\nGoogle is rolling out four new metrics that will “provide clear insights on where your ads are appearing on the search results page.” The four new metrics are defined as:\n\n(Absolute Top) % – the percent of your ad impressions that are shown as the very first ad above the organic search results.\n\n(Top) % – the percent of your ad impressions that are shown anywhere above the organic search results.\n\nSearch (Absolute Top) IS – the impressions you’ve received in the absolute top location (the very first ad above the organic search results) divided by the estimated number of impressions you were eligible to receive in the top location.\n\nSearch (Top) IS – the impressions you’ve received in the top location (anywhere above the organic search results) compared to the estimated number of impressions you were eligible to receive in the top location.\n\nGoogle is constantly improving its algorithms and metrics, and if your business doesn’t keep up, it will be left behind. So how will these new metrics affect your Google Ads? By providing you with a more detailed insight into where your ads are showing up on the results page. Before, Google Ads advertisers could only see average position of their impressions, which told business’s where their ads appeared versus other ads in the ad auction (not where their ad appeared on the page). This means that an ad position of “1” means that your ad shows ahead of all other ads, but it doesn’t mean the ad was at the very top of the page.\n\nNow, businesses will know what percentage of their impressions are served as the very first ad and what percentage are shown before the organic search results! This information can help advertisers understand the location of their ads and decide how to bid on page location.\n\nIf you are looking for professional help with your Search Engine Management and Google Ads, make sure that the company you work with is constantly staying up-to-date with all of Google’s updates.

A twenty year Radio veteran, Rush looks forward to continuing to shape the brand of The Shark, work with local organizations, and continue to move the brand ‘forward’ with both listeners and advertisers alike. “We’ll continue to be Everything That Rocks….and then some! I work with really awesome people, and we keep it grassroots, and are very involved with our listeners and the local communities we serve”.\n\nBrian Orlando, 94.3 The Shark’s current morning show host, looks forward to taking on the additional responsibilities as Assistant Program Director. “94.3 The Shark has provided me the most and best opportunities of my career.

Rob and Orlando have long demonstrated that type of dedication. We are thrilled about their expanded roles working with Operations Manager Patrick Shea to execute and guide our brand strategy,” said Michelle Stevens, Connoisseur Media’s Director of Brand Management.\n\nBy Doug Gunsolley\n\nEveryone in the digital marketing space knows that in the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) world, things can change quickly. With Google tweaking their search algorithm dozens of times a year, it can seem overwhelming to keep up with the changes. Fortunately, though, if you think about it from Google’s point of view, all these changes are designed to deliver the best search results possible. This means that a website that is designed to give its users the best information possible can thrive in this changing environment.\n\nFor example, Google recently rolled out an update dubbed the medic update which primarily affected sites in the medical, health, fitness, healthy lifestyle space. With the Medic update, Google changed the significance of its algorithm’s core ranking factors. This is the overall framework for how your content gets ranked in search results. Some site showed traffic increases and others showed traffic drops after this update.\n\nSo how does a business protect their site from potential negative impact of these algorithm changes? While Google does not reveal its secret sauce for ranking websites, it does give guidelines. The most basic thing a business can do is to focus on making a great experience, offer better content and a more useful website. Remember that Google wants the best results for the user. If your site offers a great experience for the user, that will go a long way towards making sure your site does not suffer dramatic traffic swings.\n\nHere are some factors that can help\n\nFreshness: When was the last time you updated your web site? Does the copyright date in the footer say © 2002? Google loves to crawl new content and add it to their database. For this reason, it is a great idea to add something new to your website on a regular basis. Whether it’s a new product, a new web page, or a new article, providing something new will help keep Google happy and, more importantly, your users coming back.\n\nContent: Related to freshness is content. Not just any content but content that is related to what your web site is offering. If you are selling cat products, adding an article about proper cat care or information about the various cat breeds will enable the natural addition of search phrases to be added to your website. The addition of keywords related to what your site focuses on will provide an indication to Google what your site is focused on. It will also bring in new visits for different but related search terms from visitors that have a vested interest in what you are offering.\n\nUrls: A url stands for uniform (or universal) resource locator. It is the unique name of the web page address. Google likes it when it finds words in the url that are related to the content found on the web page. A web page with the url odorless-kitty-litter.html will receive a much better position in the search engine rankings for the search term “odorless kitty litter” compared to a web page with the url page1.html\n\nSpeed: Google loves to get things done quickly. There are hundreds of elements Google considers when deciding where a web page shows up in a search result. This mathematical algorithm is made up of a number of different ingredients. One of these is the amount of time it takes for a page to load. If it loads quickly, Google knows that is helpful to the user. If it takes longer than a few seconds, Google knows your site will lose visitors. Google will then be reluctant to even show your site to those searchers.\n\nQuality links: If you want your website to send a signal that it is a worthy resource, obtain a link from a highly trusted and established website. Having a site linked to from the New York Time’s website will carry more weight from Google than a link from a newly created blog with very little history. Trust is very important in any relationship and having high quality links pointing to your website will instill this trust and solidify your standing on the web.\n\nAge: This is one factor that is difficult to pull off inorganically. When it comes to age, older is better. You can’t trick Google with a fake ID. If your web site’s domain age is older than your competitors, your site will have a better chance to show up higher in the search engines. If your domain name was purchased last week and your site is brand new, it will take a little more time to get great rankings.\n\nThese are just a few of the many ranking signals that can affect your SEO. Google also publishes an SEO Starter Guide with more information on SEO best practices\n\nFinally, if you are looking for professional help with your SEO efforts, make sure that the company you work with is doing “white hat” SEO. A white hat SEO firm avoids risky practices, such as paying for links, publishing spammy content, and using other questionable tactics. At Connoisseur Digital, we know the importance of using best practices and tactics for your SEO efforts.

In fact, the first documented piece of direct mail marketing was actually an advertisement on papyrus. Next time you’re in London, feel free to fact check me. It’s housed in the British Museum.\n\nSo what makes direct mail such a valuable tool, and why are we talking about it here? Patience, young padawan. Direct mail stands apart from other traditional forms of media because it is a highly targetable form of advertising. You can put your brand in front of your core consumers by sending mail directly to their house! Sounds pretty great, until you factor in what I like to call the “junk mail” factor. According to the NYU School of Law, 44 percent of junk mail is thrown away without ever being opened. That’s a lot of eyeballs that will never see your carefully crafted (not to mention expensive) mailer.\n\nThat brings us to IP Targeting. Think of IP Targeting as direct mail for the digital age. The average American spends 24 hours a week online…that’s an average of over three hours and 20 minutes per day! Ninety-three percent of this time is spent outside of search browsers (Google, Bing, Yahoo). That means that people are living in the now on their favorite websites, apps, etc. IP Targeting allows you to reach your core consumers while they’re plugged in, branding your company with creative messaging to make sure you are top of mind the next time they’re in need of your product or service. How? I’m glad you asked.\n\nThanks to Internet Protocol (aka IP) Addresses – which are numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a computer network – you can target individual households, businesses, convention centers and more. All it takes is matching a physical mailing address to the associated IP Address and voila! We’ve just served a banner ad to your target consumer.\n\nIP Targeting is a highly precise form of marketing. In fact, it’s 50-100 times more targeted than TV ads. This high level of targeting also results in greater ad interaction (3.3 times the industry average) and enhanced efficiency (6-60 times more effective than other display ads).\n\nThere are, of course, downsides. People, and even businesses, tend to move, so there’s about a 60 percent match rate. And it’s certainly not a cheap marketing strategy. However, when used effectively, along with a programmatic display campaign, IP Targeting can achieve high ROI (return on investment).\n\nLet’s review: nearly half of what is deemed junk mail (which often contains direct mailers) is thrown away without ever being opened, whereas banner ads are served directly to a consumers’ computer or phone, practically ensuring it’s seen. IP Targeting isn’t just limited to B2C marketing either – you can target people at work through businesses’ IP Addresses.\n\nSo whether you’re looking to target existing customers from your own database, or striving to engage potential new customers, consider IP Targeting as part of your digital strategy. After all, like it or not, we live in a constantly evolving digital world. It’s time to take your direct mail strategy online.\n\nBy Erica Chludzinski\n\nWhat is OTT: Over-The-Top\n\nOTT, or “over-the-top,” refers to the online services that stream television and film. Countless devices exist that are OTT-compatible, including smart TVs, gaming consoles, smart set-up boxes (think Apple TV or Google Chromecast), desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones. If I asked you to think of someone you know who didn’t own at least one of those devices, you probably would have a difficult time answering me. So we know OTT is accessible, but is it being embraced?\n\nStudies say yes! Last year, the amount of people who cancelled their traditional cable television service reached 27.1 million. This year, that number is expected to climb to 33 million. These people, dubbed “cord cutters,” are replacing cable with OTT streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. Cord cutters are attracted to OTT not only for the convenience of streaming but also the original content offered by OTT providers.\n\nWhy Advertise on OTT\n\nOTT advertising comes in the form of a video advertisement that is non-skippable by the viewer. In other words, the viewer must watch the video advertisement in its entirety to access the desired OTT content. This video can be 15, 30 or 60 seconds long. To summarize, OTT advertising is done by streaming a commercial before streaming a desired television program or movie.\n\nDue to the fact that there are so many consumers who are switching from cable to OTT, advertising on OTT means access to consumers that are not available through advertising on traditional cable TV. OTT provides you the opportunity to choose where you air your non-skippable, must-watch video advertisements, so you can better reach your target market and increase ROI.\n\nBy settling for only airing traditional television commercials, advertisers are missing out on the increasing consumer base that is available through OTT advertising.

The mission of this initiative, which was developed by Connoisseur Media CEO, Jeff Warshaw is to encourage unity, love, kindness, acceptance and hope in our communities through the power of music and the artist’s messages by featuring a song at 2:00pm every weekday on all stations. The song will essentially be chosen by the listener; it will be their song and their story which they will share by visiting the website of their favorite Connoisseur Media radio station. One of the songs that inspired Jeff initially was Macklemore’s “Same Love”.\n\nMichelle Stevens, Director of Brand Management had this to say:\n\n“Jeff is as competitive and outspoken as anyone in our industry. I asked him what his hope was, and it was simple, ‘to use the power of our stations to encourage inclusiveness, respect and love in our communities’”.\n\nStevens went on to say, “The interactive nature of this initiative will provide listeners an authentic acceptance of the things that really matter most to each of us as human\n\nbeings. We all have struggled with issues like depression, addiction, insecurity, abuse and a host of other things, that can be disabling to the human spirit without compassion and support. Music is so often the familiar tie that is able to connect us all on a deeper level when it’s difficult to articulate for ourselves. Together, we can take a fresh approach to the meaning behind the lyrics and weave a bond of unity, inner strength and the simple reassurance that we are not alone”.\n\nWarshaw said, “We hope that the artists will join with us and share their inspiration for the meaning within their songs with a brief message of positivity and encouragement. In return, this will offer the artists a great opportunity to connect with the audience in a more intimate way than ever before, creating a more personal bond between listener and artist.”\n\nStevens concluded by saying, “As we all know, great stations are a balance of art and science, of research and heart. In other words, a great brand is strategy + emotion. This brings heart to our communities and what we do each day. Our mission now is to translate that to each listener, one song at a time: One Song, One Us”.\n\nConnoisseur Media owns/operates radio stations in Bridgeport, New Haven and Stamford-Norwalk, CT; Long Island, NY; Allentown, Erie and Stroudsburg, PA; and Billings, MT.\n\nContact information:\n\nJeffrey D.
