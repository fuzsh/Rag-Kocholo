        "text": "Mayly Tao, Owner of DK's Donuts & Bakery + Donut Princess LA, joins Jerry to chat about her childhood growing up the daughter of Cambodian immigrants in the donut business, how she found her way back into that business, and what she has done to improve and expand upon the legacy started by her Uncle Ted. Check out The Donut King Movie at www.DonutKingMovie.com\n\nWe celebrate Mayly's success in taking her parent's business and improving and expanding well on its way to a new empire.\n\nWe support her work of helping those around her expand their own brands and businesses through her firm.\n\nWe are inspired by her using her voice to share the story of Uncle Ted, The Donut King himself.\n\nMeet Mayly!\n\nWhile many kids may have been watching Saturday morning cartoons or sleeping soundly, Mayly at the age of seven was already awake by 5 a.m. accompanying her parents to their shop and assisting them in any way should could. Both Mayly and her brother helped around the shop and became a common fixture of the DK’s Donuts and Bakery experience. Whether it was her brother helping his father bake or Mayly standing on a milk crate to reach the top of the donut showcase to give out change to customers, this was truly a family run business. Mayly’s parents were immigrants, survivors of the Khmer Rouge, and found the American Dream through donuts. Her great uncle, Ted Ngoy, is known as the “Donut King” for opening hundreds of donut shops in Southern California as an opportunity for survival in the 70s and 80s. Donuts have always ran in Mayly’s bloodline.\n\nAfter attending UC San Diego with a degree in Communications, she came back to the family business with the initial idea to improve upon the branding, documentation and overall marketing strategy for DK’s Donuts and Bakery. Mayly wanted to capture all the beautiful and unique aspects of DK’s Donuts that often went overlooked or only seen by the handfuls of loyal westsiders. But what she soon discovered that beyond using her communication skills to update the outward facing look and feel of her family’s 30 year old establishment, her real talent was in the introduction of new experimental flavors that were a completely new interpretation of the classic donut catalog. She relished in the investigation of these new culinary concoctions and truly attempted to mash up a cross section of flavors on the human palette. It was Mayly’s unique combination of social media acumen and culinary creativity that made DK’s Donuts the Westside’s best kept favorite secret. Donut Princess LA is her newest concept, with a focus on donut bouquets and mini donuts. Donut Princess LA focuses on the experience of a unique gift, a delicious product, displayed beautifully at an event, baby shower, office party, birthday… You name it.\n\n(Source: https://www.donutprincessla.com/about/)\n\nWatch The Donut King: https://www.donutkingmovie.com/\n\n// Connect with Mayly!\n\nWeb: https://www.dksdonuts.com/about/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/maylytao\n\n// Join the Dear Asian Americans Community on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/dearasianamericans\n\n// Listen to Dear Asian Americans on all major platforms:\n\nTransistor.fm: http://www.dearasianamericans.com\n\nApple: https://apple.dearasianamericans.com\n\nSpotify: https://spotify.dearasianamericans.com\n\nStitcher: https://stitcher.dearasianamericans.com\n\nGoogle: https://google.dearasianamericans.com\n\nFollow us on Instagram:\n\nhttp://www.instagram.com/dearasianamericans\n\nLike us on Facebook:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/dearasianamericans\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/dearasianamericans\n\nLearn more about DAA Producer and Host Jerry Won:\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerrywon/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jerryjwon/\n\n// Support the show by becoming a patron on Patreon at http:www.patreon.com/dearasianamericans\n\n// Join the Asian Podcast Network:\n\nWeb: https://asianpodcastnetwork.com/\n\nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianpodcastnetwork/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asianpodcastnetwork/"
