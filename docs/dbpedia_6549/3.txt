The Radiothon took place Saturday, November 7th, 2020 from 11am to 7pm. WWSK (94.3 The Shark FM) broadcasted live from the studio at the Paramount in Huntington for the first “Hope Rocks” Fundraiser. Donations and funds raised through an auction benefited the American Foundation For Suicide Prevention, Long Island Chapter. “Hope Rocks” used the many resources 94.3 The Shark has at its disposal to raise money and awareness to help combat the challenges faced by those who suffer from mental illness and support those who struggle. 94.3 The Shark personalities, including morning host Orlando, midday host Gabby and program director, Rob Rush, who also hosts weekday afternoons will be present for the event.

Rob Rush says, “The goal of Hope Rocks is to shatter the stigma of mental health and to let people know that it’s ok NOT to be ok sometimes but know that help is always there and you ARE NOT alone”. A.F.S.P. Long Island Director, Ann Morrison says, “The past several months have been challenging for all of us, and now more than ever before, it is important to focus on our mental health and understanding how to reach out for help. The Long Island Chapter is honored to be partnering with Connoisseur Media Long Island and 94.3 The Shark for this exciting event!”
