• Connoisseur Media Mainstream Rock WWSK (94.3 The Shark)/Long Island welcomes major market rock vet Aimee Brooks to the crew for middays — she will take over the 11am-2pm weekday shift, beginning Monday, June 26.

Brooks brings with her a wealth of rock knowledge and experience making her the perfect fit for the “Everything that rocks” format, most recently doing nights for Beasley Active Rock WRIF/Detroit. “This is a big win for The Shark,” said Rob Rush, 94.3 The Shark’s PD/afternoon personality. “Aimee lives and breathes the rock culture and I know our audience will love her passion and genuine appreciation for the music during the workday.”

Brooks notably programmed iHeartMedia Mainstream Rock WIOT/Toledo, OH from 2003-2020. She also served as APD of AC sister WRVF (101.5 The River). Brooks grew up listening to music, usually at full blast, loves New York, loves coffee, plays guitar, and rescues kittens.
