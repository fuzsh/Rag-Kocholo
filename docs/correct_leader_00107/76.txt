Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga has declared a state of emergency as the country plunged into political turmoil following the sacking of three ministers, her office said.

Ms Kumaratunga used her executive powers to impose the state of emergency which give sweeping authority to the security forces to arrest and detain suspects, an official at her office said.

The move followed Tuesday's sacking of ministers of defence, interior and information as well as the suspension of parliament until November 19.

The tough laws would be in force for a period of 10 days, the maximum period allowed without parliamentary sanctions, officials said.

Any continuation of the extraordinary laws would require parliament to be resummoned to ratify her decision, officials said.

Sri Lanka was under a state of emergency, apart from a few short breaks, from March 1983 until October 2001 when the draconian laws automatically lapsed as Ms Kumaratunga's then government lost its majority in the assembly.

At subsequent parliamentary elections in December 2001, her party lost to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP) plunging the country into an uneasy cohabitation arrangement.

Despite the political turmoil in the capital, the streets remained calm on Wednesday except for a larger than usual presence of troops at state media institutions.
