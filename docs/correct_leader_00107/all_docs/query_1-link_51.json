        "text": "Context\n\nSince the civil war in Sri Lanka ended in 2009, successive governments have taken a variety of measures to advance the process of reconciliation. In 2011, the Sri Lankan Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) drafted its initial recommendations on how to tackle the fundamental causes of the long-running conflict and coming to terms with the past. The policy of reconciliation received another boost when the Government elected in January 2015 supported a Resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nIn 2016, the Government convened a Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) and tasked it with undertaking nationwide consultations to identify the views of the Sri Lankan population on a range of reconciliation mechanisms and processes. The final report of the CTF and the approval of a National Policy for Reconciliation and Coexistence in 2018 led to the establishment by the Government of an Office on Missing Persons and preparations for a new Office on Reparations. A key measure paving the way for these initiatives was the creation of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) in 2015, chaired by the former president Chandrika Kumaratunga.\n\nA new Government was elected in November 2019, headed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. It has announced a critical review of the existing reconciliation policy. Parliamentary elections take place in 2020, and it remains to be seen whether new political priorities and practical initiatives will follow.\n\nThe reconciliation programme financed jointly by the Federal Foreign Office and the European Union builds on these political and institutional initiatives and supports the Sri Lankan Government and civil society in their efforts to ensure lasting peace.\n\nObjective\n\nThe reconciliation process in Sri Lanka is strengthened. Governmental and non-governmental organisations in Sri Lanka address key aspects of the reconciliation process jointly."
