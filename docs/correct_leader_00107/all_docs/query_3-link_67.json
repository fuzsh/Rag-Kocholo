The Bank Supervision, Economic Research, Public Debt and Secretariat departments were housed in this building while the Banking Department which also included the Currency Division functioned from the Secretariat Building (General Treasury Building, in which the Ministry of Finance is located).",

        "text": "Under these circumstances, the Central Bank realized the necessity to move to its own building. A land of one acre owned by the British colony which was located at Queen's Street in Colombo Fort was gifted as a Crown Grant to the Central Bank to build its Headquarters. In its vicinity was the prominent landmark, the clock tower lighthouse at the junction of Queen's Street and Chatham Street.\n\nInternational tenders were called through Sri Lanka embassies abroad for a reputed building contractor and Ed. Zublin AG, Stuttgart in Germany was selected. Van Gothem Company from Belgium was the architect. Selwarathnam and Monk, the Chartered Architects were their Sri Lankan resident representatives. The construction commenced in the year 1960 when Mr. D. W. Rajapathirana was the Governor. The Assistant to the Governor, Mr. D. C. Gunasekera was the Officer in charge of construction.\n\nThe next serious challenge was to bring different departments of the Central Bank located in different buildings, under one common roof of the Central Bank Headquarters. Central Bank’s administration with the assistance of private movers, within a few days relocated all departments and offices of the Central Bank housed at the Hemas building, YMBA building, Echelon building and the Secretariat building to its own Headquarters in July 1964. It is on record that the Governor Mr. D. W. Rajapathirana had commended the Bank’s administration for the excellent support given to completing the relocation project without misplacing even a single item.\n\nIn addition to the refurbishment of the damaged Headquarters building, the Central Bank also commenced construction of the two new towers to its Headquarters in the adjacent land, where the foundation stone had already been laid in August 1994. Both the refurbishment of existing damaged building and construction of the Central Bank extension building had been undertaken by Ed. Zublin AG, Stuttgart of Germany with Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) providing detailed architectural drawings, interior design, detailed structural and electro- mechanical drawings and contract administration. Original design for the project had been done by Dutch Architects in collaboration with a local architectural firm. A modern bridge connects the old building to the new building at 3 levels, through 9th, 10th, and 11th floors.\n\nTogether with these added novel towers, the new premises of the Headquarters was positioned as a modern Central Bank in the region. It was equipped with an international conference hall (named John Exter International Conference Hall, as a tribute to the Bank’s founding Governor), with state-of-the-art conference facilities, comprehensive IT setting facilitated with intra and international networks, while giving birth to a new working culture with modern working facilities including a fully equipped research library to enhance the knowledge based learning environment. Central Bank commenced operations at the new Headquarters building in October 1999. To commemorate the 50th Golden Jubilee anniversary of the Central Bank, the new building was officially declared open as the Central Bank Headquarters on 27th August 2000 by Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of Sri Lanka and the Minister of Finance and Planning, during the tenure of Governor Deshamanya A. S. Jayawardena. Further, a Rs. 1000/- commemorative silver coin, a commemorative stamp with first day cover, and Swarna Jayanthi publication had been issued to mark the Golden Jubilee."
