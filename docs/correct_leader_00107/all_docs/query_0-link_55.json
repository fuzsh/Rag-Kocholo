        "text": "Colombo (dpa) - Sri Lanka, still suffering from the afternoon of the December 26 tsunami, has offered to help victims of Hurricane Katrina in the U.S., the President's Office said Friday.\n\nPresident Chandrika Kumaratunga, on an official visit to China, offered 25,000 dollars for the victims of the hurricane.\n\n\"Having experienced the fury of nature ourselves during the December 26th tsunami, the people of Sri Lanka and I fully empathize with you at this hour of national grief,'' she said.\n\nShe recalled with gratitude the spontaneous U.S. response in the wake of the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nPresident Kumaratunga expressed her profound condolences on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka to the families who have lost their loved ones and articulated solidarity with the victims, the President's office said.\n\nSri Lanka, in the aftermath of the tsunami, received substantial U.S. military and other assistance.\n\nAn estimated 41,000 persons were killed in Sri Lanka when nearly two thirds of the coastal areas were damaged.\n\nThe cash offer from Sri Lanka to the American Red Cross immediately drew a response from the U.S. embassy in Colombo.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador in Colombo, James F. Entwistel expressed gratitude to President Kumaratunga.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate Sri Lanka's concern and assistance for the victims of Hurricane Katrina ... Sri Lanka's commitment to help relieve the suffering our citizens illustrates the deep bonds of friendship between our two countries,'' the ambassador said in a statement. dpa ad jh"
