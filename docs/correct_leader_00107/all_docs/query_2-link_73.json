        "text": "Overall Situation\n\nThe Development Forum meeting was held in Kandy on 16 to 17 May and focused on post tsunami relief and reconstruction, macro-economic policy of the Government of Sri Lanka and partnership in the peace process. The MDG 2005 Report for Sri Lanka was launched at the meeting. Three key issues dominated the statements of donors and and UN agencies: the importance of coordination, the need for a smooth and effective transition from relief to recovery and concern over the lack of progress in the peace process -- particularly regarding the need for a joint mechanism for relief and recovery efforts in the North and East.\n\nIn addition, the need for increased transparency and accountability was acknowledged and supported by all participants. Documents related to the Development Forum are available on the HIC website at <www.humanitarianinfo.org/srilanka> and a media monitoring of coverage of the Development Forum is attached to the end of this sitrep.\n\nOCHA has produced the first of what will be a monthly print newsletter, \"Post-Tsunami Update,\" that reports on United Nations activities in support of the relief and recovery efforts of the Sri Lankan government and its people. The newsletter is also available electronically through the website of the Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC) at the address: www.humanitarianinfo.org/srilanka/mediacentre/press/docs/PostTsunamiUpdate.pdf\n\nWater and sanitation\n\nUNHCR and the Ministry of Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconciliation (MRRR) are signing on 20 May an agreement that ensures vital water supplies to residents of three villages in Mannar. Over 1,000 families in Thevanpiddy, Vellankulam and Moonampiddy will benefit from the construction of a 10.3 km-long water pipe along the coastal belt of Manthai West DS division, providing better access to safe drinking water, improvements in hygiene, and new livelihood opportunities for the local population. The project is being implemented by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS & DB) Trincomalee, with supervision by the MRRR through the Northeast Community Restoration and Development Project (NECORD). Upon completion, UNICEF will connect the pipeline to schools and health centres, while UNDP will further extend the pipeline to two other villages.\n\nThe project, funded by the Government of Denmark through the Danish Development Co-operation Office (DANIDA) at a cost of Rs.25.9 million, seeks to address the poor availability of water to the three villages, which currently rely on water bowsers or a well in Paliaru, that has gradually increased in salinity. By supplying water directly to beneficiaries the scheme reduces the burden of water collection, improving their standard of living. Through the building of the new pipeline and supplying beneficiaries with immediate access to potable water, the scheme supports efforts to establish conditions that allow internally displaced persons (IDPs) to return voluntarily to their homes, a key requirement of UNHCR's Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (GPID).\n\nCommunities and camps in Batticaloa are now receiving between 12 to 16 litres of water/per person/per day. This meets WHO standards for emergency situations. UNICEF plans to further increase supply to 25 l/p/d. A water treatment plant (with the capacity of purifying 20,000 litres per day) has been installed at the UNICEF-constructed water source in Kattankudy by the Italian Red Cross. UNICEF has supplied a diesel pump to Italian Red Cross for use at the plant.\n\nIn Ampara district, UNICEF is progressing in the construction of water and sanitation facilities that complement UNHCR transitional shelters. Thirty-eight units are being constructed with over 75 toilets, urinals and bathroom facilities. Cleaning of wells in the Ampara district has also progressed with 5,000 wells now completed. A further 2,000 will be cleaned in coming weeks\n\nIn Jaffna, the progress on shelter construction has been significant. Out of a planned 3,087 shelters, 2,705 have been completed and construction of a further 382 is in progress. An estimated 2,660 families have moved into these shelters. Safe drinking water is supplied on continual basis to the 72 water tanks available in these shelters with a total capacity of 79,000 litres.\n\nHealth\n\nSome 12,400 mosquito nets, which were handed over by UNICEF to the Deputy Director of Health Services in Batticaloa district, are being distributed to families in the malaria prevalent areas of the district. An increase in Mosquito-borne diseases is likely due to the seasonal North East monsoon rains.\n\nA one day vitamin A supplementation campaign conducted on 30 April 2005 was successfully carried out in nine tsunami-affected districts. The campaign targeted over 450,000 children between 6 months and 5 years of age. Reports received to date show very high coverage. In Jaffna district the coverage was reported to be 94.9 per cent, in Trincomalee coverage was reported at 94 per cent and Ampara reported 97 per cent. A similar report is expected to come from the remaining districts. UNICEF zone and country office staff conducted monitoring visits on 30 April to health clinics and mobile clinics near IDP camps. NGO's were also mobilized to assist with monitoring.\n\nNon-food items and shelter\n\nA two-day meeting was recently held in Galle by INFORM and the National Human Rights Commission to raise awareness and discuss issues arising from the land policy and resettlement programmes of the government. The aim was to highlight some of the government actions, to hear input and the experiences of the tsunami affected population through a public forum, and to engage in preparing joint future plans. Key participants of the meeting were Lionel Fernando, the Director of Disaster Unit; National Human Rights Commission, the Government Agent of Galle and other relevant officials including the Deputy Inspector General and Senior Superintendent of Police Officers from Matara and Hambantota, Secretaries and GNs of relevant divisions, representatives from I/NGO's operational in the districts of Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, and tsunami-affected population and their representatives.\n\nAccording to Save the Children in Sri Lanka, the general situation appears to be continuing to improve in the Northern Province, with 99 per cent of transitional shelters at Transit camps in Mullaitivu now being occupied, and about 85 per cent in Vadamarachchi East. In addition, transitional shelters are now going to be built for those living under canvas who were not included in the original numbers of shelters to be built, but who were directly affected by the tsunami.\n\nProtection\n\nThe issue of children's land rights is now being increasingly highlighted by child protection actors. Many of the children registered as having lost parents are entitled to land as inheritance in the buffer zone. There is the issue of ensuring that they receive their entitlements, and ascertaining that guardians do not abuse this right. UNICEF Batticaloa agreed to raise this issue with headquarters and perhaps look at implications for programming. Additionally, UNICEF agreed to work with Probation and ESCO to conduct a study on the numbers of children who might be affected.\n\nUNICEF Batticaloa provided seven bicycles for each of the seven Women and Children's Police Desks in Batticaloa. These bicycles will assist officers to be more mobile and improve follow-up and response to cases of abuse. The Women and Children's Police Desks also organized a meeting initiated by UNICEF and CARE on the Campaign against Domestic Violence. Participants agreed to a month-long campaign, with a focus on the importance of family unity, as well as to stress positive messages. It was also agreed that the Campaign should support the Women's Committee for Disaster Management initiative to support camp and village level Action Groups to prevent violence.\n\nSri Lanka Local Media Monitoring of the Development Forum\n\nWorld Bank deputy leader confers with the President on common mechanism\n\nPraful Patel the deputy leader of the World Bank had discussions with the President on the common mechanism for an hour yesterday at Kandy.

The appeal comes even though the donor forum is no longer an annual review of the country's performance, proposed programmes and projects and commitment of aid as in the past. As the title suggests, the event is more development and policy oriented as opposed to the famous Paris Aid Group meetings of the past. Private sector sources said that more than aid Sri Lanka was seriously lacking the right and consistent policies and worse even if there are correct policies there is inexplicable delays in implementation or ad-hoc changes.

They agreed that the reconstruction strategy that has been formulated based on a set of guiding principles that would include inter alia (a) allocation of resources based on identified local needs and priorities, (b) delegation or subsidiarity to the lowest level of government, (c) consultation with affected communities, (d) ensuring transparency, accountability and flexibility, (e) reduction of future vulnerabilities, (f) sensitivity to equity considerations and (g) effective coordination between the Government and development partners, should be operationalised.\n\nWhile noting that financing was not an issue given that the pledges and commitments already made now stand at approximately US dollars 3 billion including debt relief, the Forum focused on the implementation challenges currently being faced, among which were the operationalising of the guiding principles and effective donor coordination.\n\nThe development partners noted the significant progress that had been made with respect to transitional housing and permanent housing, and stressed the importance of an early resolution of the problems related to land acquisition and allocation.\n\nWhile recognizing the need for the establishment of appropriate buffer zones for coast conservation and safety, the development partners urged the government to adopt maximum flexibility to allow for a more practical implementation of the principle, especially in areas of acute land shortage.\n\nThe Government reiterated its commitment to a number of key initiatives with regard to the need to improve information flows and coordination mechanisms involving all key partners, including non-state stake holders whose contribution is critical in the post tsunami recovery effort; the clarity of roles at all levels and the determination to assign responsibility to the lowest possible level of government, while strengthening their capacity; and monitoring mechanisms with a focus on transparency, accountability and good governance.\n\nFor their part, the development partners committed themselves to assist Sri Lanka in these efforts and in ensuring that their pledges of financial and technical assistance would be realized, and to deepen their coordination process to minimize the burden on the Government's administrative capacity.\n\nEconomic Conditions and Policies\n\nThe Government presented an analysis of recent economic developments and current economic conditions, and set out its plans for the medium term.

Among the areas of concern noted on the macroeconomic front were the need to raise investment especially for infrastructure, the need to strengthen government revenue performance to address the problem of continuing high fiscal deficits and growing public debt, and the need to reduce inflationary pressures that could be exacerbated by rising petroleum prices and high levels of inflows and domestic activity related to post-tsunami reconstruction.\n\nPoverty Reduction Strategy and the Millennium Development Goals\n\nThe Government presented its discussion paper for a 'New Development Strategy, a Framework for Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction' (FEGPR) based on accelerated growth, reduced regional imbalances, and improved opportunities for the poor. It also presented its report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as a number of more detailed presentations such as those on NCED, SEMA, financial sector reforms, and administrative reforms.\n\nThe international community commended the Government for the quality of these reports. Development partners noted the issues of income distribution and regional disparity in economic activity in Sri Lanka and how these were impacting on the prospects for achieving MDGs.\n\nWhile the proposals that had been introduced to the Forum were viewed as encouraging, it was agreed that more work was required, especially on how to improve the growth prospects for the poor. In particular, the principle of 'no growth, no poverty reduction' was espoused, and the government was encouraged to continue to build consensus on the specific strategies for increasing economic growth.\n\nThe Government strongly indicated its intention to engage in reinvigorated efforts to complete its new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) to achieve the MDGs. In particular, the Government committed itself to a wider consultation process with all its social, political and development partners, and declared its intention to complete this process in the coming months.\n\nWhile committing itself to key economic reforms, the government would pay particular attention to the reform design and sequencing of the implementation process.\n\nThe development partners offered their strong support for such efforts and looked forward to further discussions of the government's PRS.\n\nPartnership and Peace\n\nThe participants welcomed the maintenance of the ceasefire agreement, the continued efforts to implement the National Plan of Action for Children, and the efforts toward a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\n\nThere was strong support for efforts to bring all communities into the process through a possible joint mechanism for managing post-tsunami assistance in the affected areas in the North and East.\n\nThe international community strongly endorsed the idea of such a mechanism and encouraged the parties to continue their efforts to bring it to fruition as soon as possible to ensure effective aid distribution at ground level. The Forum especially welcomed the strong commitment by Her Excellency the President in moving toward consensus building through wider consultation. Several partners indicated their support and cooperation for her initiative and commitment.\n\nThe partners expressed the hope that this joint mechanism would contribute to creating an environment that would lead to enhanced mutual trust and confidence-building between parties to the conflict, thus enhancing the prospects for peace.\n\nThere was a clear recognition that a just and durable peace acceptable to all her communities would remain the top priority on Sri Lanka's agenda and that with a return to lasting peace, maintenance of macroeconomic stability and effective implementation of a comprehensive PRS, prospects for sustained economic prosperity in Sri Lanka will be greatly enhanced.
