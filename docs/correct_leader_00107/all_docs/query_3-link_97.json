        "text": "In August, Sri Lanka’s President Chandrika Kumaratunga was impeached on charges of violating the constitution. The United National Party cited the March agreement with the IMF as an abuse of power because the president failed to obtain prior approval from her ministers.\n\nThe IMF has already released half of the US$253m loan but the remainder is unlikely to be released without changes to the programme. Kumaratunga is also charged with “subjecting the country to unspecified and unlimited conditions which the IMF may impose… and thereby guilty of abuse of the powers of her office.”"
