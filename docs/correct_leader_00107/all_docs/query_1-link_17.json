        "text": "President Kumaratunga envisioned enriching education to empower future generations. Her overarching mission was to modernize education to help young people to be valuable citizens of Sri Lanka with a competitive edge in a global setting.\n\nA Presidential Task Force was appointed including academics, experts from the education sector and private sector to study the recommendations of the National Education Commission and help formulate a National Policy.\n\nThe set of reforms based on the recommendations of the National Education Commission were implemented beginning in 1997. The National Education Commission’s findings and recommendations were based on wider public consultation on existing problems and issues in the education sector. The recommendations covered General education, University education and Technical and Vocational education.\n\nEducation Reforms of 1997\n\n• 1997 was designated as the “Year of Educational Reforms” and propelled Sri Lanka to a new dimension in education; a major breakthrough away from traditional methods was achieved and focused progress made creating a new culture of creative thinking and learning.\n\n• Educating ‘Human Capital’ was recognized as a primary tool in leveraging the country’s prospects by the Government, which showed a will and an unwavering commitment to expand and enrich the quality of education.\n\n• The reforms of 1997 were grounded on enhancing life competencies and upholding the value of peace and social cohesion. The task at hand was to lay a firm foundation from which the existing culture of memory based, examination oriented teaching could be transformed into a thinking, creative and problem solving learning culture.\n\n• High on the agenda was to minimize the gap between the education and the labour market requirements by making quantum improvements; in education, promoting access, ensuring equitable allocation of resources and providing adequate infrastructure facilities and support.\n\n• Exceptional emphasis was given to competency-based education, special education and inclusive education, empowering students with knowledge in ICT and English education to reduce regional disparities in enrolment, achievements in improving teacher competence and commitment was also introduced.\n\n• The reforms of 1997 have already reaped rich dividends and Sri Lanka has made impressive advances in education. Further enhancements are planned in the coming years as the country forges ahead towards excellence in education.\n\nSetting the foundation towards Education Reform\n\n1994 – Sri Lanka Teacher Service set up to enhance status of teachers.\n\nSri Lanka Principal Service set up to enhance status of school principals.\n\n1995 – Non-formal technical unit assumes role of provider of non-formal education to non- school going children and provide literacy programmes for adults.\n\n1997 – Major education reforms stimulating a wave of progress in primary, secondary and tertiary education.\n\nNational ICT education drive launched.\n\nImplementation of the second phase and third generation education reforms. During the second wave curriculum reforms, examination and text book reforms were also launched.\n\n1998 – Compulsory Education Regulations introduced to ensure the enrollment of all children aged 5-14 in schools. School Attendance Committees and School Attendance monitoring Committees were established to facilitate enrollment.\n\n1999 – ‘Navodya Schools Programme’ was launched to develop at least one school of excellence per administrative division.\n\n2001 – English medium education was reintroduced in GCE A/L\n\nScience and for selected subjects in secondary schools\n\nThe subsequent increased investment in education has paid rich dividends and the country is widely considered a success story in achieving high levels of human development. The primary paradigm shift witnessed was in the philosophy of education; where from ‘teaching rudimentary’ to ‘learning competencies’, paved the way for a vibrant 21st century generation of creative thinkers ready to take on the challengers of knowledge -based economies in the globalized world.\n\nGovernment Expenditure for Education (in Million)\n\n1994 2005 16,602 45,861.5\n\nThe present schools system which has evolved over the past two centuries, now involves 9766 government schools and 54 private schools as well as 607 Buddhist Centers of learning.\n\nCategories of Schools:\n\nType of Schools Most senior class offered Collegiate schools GCE(A/L)(Science, Commerce and Arts)\n\nGCE(A/L)Arts and Commerce only) Secondary schools GCE(O/L) Primary Schools Grade 5,and some cases Grade 8\n\nSchools, Students and Teachers in government schools by Provinces (2004):\n\nTotal Number of Schools Total Number of Students Total Number of Teachers Students Per Schools Student – Teacher Ratio 9,766 3,875,050 185,955 397 20.8\n\nMany of these schools had only basic facilities and the reforms of 1997 proposed refurbishment and improvement in schools to suit modern learning needs.\n\nSteps were taken to refurbish and rebuild modern facilities such as upgrade classrooms, IT laboratories, introduce fully fledged science laboratories, activity rooms, libraries, aesthetic units, home science units and play areas.\n\nThe Total Quality Development (TQD) Programme\n\nThis Programme undertook to develop the physical infrastructure in schools with modern facilities. The TQD was first implemented at 440 Navodya Schools and 324 National Schools and then rolled out across all schools countrywide.\n\nNavodya Schools – Taking education to the periphery:\n\nThe Navodya Schools concept was formulated by President Kumaratunga as part of her electoral programme in 1994, in keeping with her vision to expand opportunities of quality education to children in disadvantaged and deprived areas of the country, and to ensure equity in the provision of quality education.\n\nUnder the Navodya Programme, a Center for Education Excellence was created and sustained in each of the administrative divisions in the country. President Kumaratunga herself developed a new approach while she was Chief Minister of the Western Province, which was then adopted by the Government after 1994.\n\nSchools were developed in a holistic manner. The traditional approach of providing fragmented ad-hoc facilities, failed to improve the quality of infrastructure in schools. Under the holistic approach which spearheaded infrastructure development, the current infrastructure stock of a school was matched against the infrastructure needs of the particular school for qualitative improvement. The needs gap was identified through this exercise and resources channeled to fill these needs.\n\nThe schools were modernized with pleasing landscape, and enhanced attractive physical appearance. The classrooms, laboratories, libraries, computer labs, aesthetic units, activity rooms, play areas multimedia units of these schools were being transformed into hives of activity where teachers and students enthusiastically engaged in well planned learning activities.\n\nProvince District Number of schools Western Province Colombo\n\nGampaha\n\nKalutara 40\n\n56\n\n21 Southern Province Galle\n\nMatara\n\nHambantota 24\n\n17\n\n10 Sabaragamuwa Province Ratnapura\n\nKegalle 21\n\n20 Northern Western Province Kurunegala\n\nPuttalam 30\n\n13 North Central Province Anuradhapura\n\nPollonnaruwa 12\n\n07 Uva Province Badulla\n\nMoneragala 19\n\n07 Central Province Kandy\n\nMatale\n\nNuwar Eliya 24\n\n06\n\n19 North East Province Trincomalee\n\nAmpara\n\nBatticaloa\n\nVauniya\n\nJaffna\n\nMannar 11\n\n05\n\n10\n\n06\n\n10\n\n01 Total 388\n\nWhen the killer waves of 26 December 2004 receded, it rapidly become clear that education was one of the worst hit areas of civic life.\n\n182 schools took the brunt of the disaster; 74 were completely destroyed and 108 partially damaged, while 444 others were used as welfare camps to house the hundreds left homeless. The tsunami was experienced by nearly 91,000 students and 3700 teachers. It was also witnessed by another 264,000 schoolchildren.\n\nPresident Kumaratunga headed the entire tsunami Reconstruction Programme and paid special attention to the Education and Health Sectors as well as Housing. As the Minister of Education, she directed her officials within a few days of the disaster, to commence relief and recovery activities.\n\nThe Ministry of Education assessed and evaluated the damage caused to schools across the affected areas, recognizing that its response must be speedy with strategic direction to suit the emergency. Mindful of the donor driven agenda, post-tsunami education recovery programmes were formulated within the guild lines of the Inter-Agency Network on Education in Emergencies.\n\nIn January 2005, reconstruction and rebuilding got underway to reconstruct 182 schools damaged by the Tsunami at a cost of Rs. 10 Billion. Another x schools situated in close proximity to the damaged schools were also rehabilitated at an estimated cost of Rs. 3 Billion.\n\nThe priority of the education Ministry was to ensure that affected communities were empowered and encouraged to actively participate in the reconstruction process, and to ensure that mere symbolic consultation and token participation avoided."
