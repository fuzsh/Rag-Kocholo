        "text": "Definition\n\nleadership\n\nBy\n\nNick Barney, Technology Writer\n\nMary K. Pratt\n\nWhat is leadership?\n\nLeadership is the ability of an individual or a group of people to influence and guide followers or members of an organization, society or team. Leadership often is an attribute tied to a person's title, seniority or ranking in a hierarchy. However, it's an attribute anyone can have or attain, even those without leadership positions. It's a developable skill that can be improved over time.\n\nLeaders are found and required in most aspects of society, including business, politics, religion and social- and community-based organizations. Leaders are seen as people who make sound and sometimes difficult decisions. They articulate a clear vision, establish achievable goals and provide followers with the knowledge and tools necessary to achieve those goals.\n\nAn effective leader has the following characteristics: self-confidence, strong communication and management skills, creative and innovative thinking, perseverance, willingness to take risks, open to change, levelheaded and reactiveness in times of crisis.\n\nIn business, individuals who exhibit leadership traits can ascend to executive management or C-level positions, such as chief executive officer (CEO), chief information officer (CIO) and president. Individuals who have exhibited strong leadership in the technology industry include Apple founder Steve Jobs, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\n\nWhy is leadership important?\n\nLeadership plays a central role in the success and direction of a business. Organizations depend on successful leaders to communicate its mission, vision and goals, unite team members around those goals and then achieve them. These capabilities are especially important in times of crisis.\n\nHard decision-making is often required for the success and evolution of a business. Businesses often depend on leaders with high competencies and emotional intelligence to make tough decisions and solve problems. This level of trust and success often leads to positive, productive work environments that encourage teamwork, employee well-being and strong work cultures that are attractive to top talent.\n\nStrong leadership is critical to an organization's competitiveness because it drives change and innovation. The best leaders keep an eye on changing directions in their industry, promote new ideas from within their company and bring in innovative thinkers.\n\nLeadership theory\n\nHow people become leaders and what makes a great leader have been the subject of study for centuries. The 19th century was dominated by the Great Man Theory, which stressed that leadership is a unique, natural skill and that great leaders are born to the task.\n\nThe following are some of the many leadership theories advanced in the 20th century:\n\nTrait theory dates to the mid-20th century and it centers on the idea that some people are born with certain personality traits that make them great leaders, such as integrity and self-confidence.\n\nSituational leadership is where the leadership style is adjusted based on the readiness or skill-level of followers in a given situation.\n\nContingency theory posits that effective leadership depends on having the right leader for the right situation.\n\nTransactional leadership is an approach where leaders reward or punish followers to achieve results.\n\nTransformational leadership is where leaders appeal to followers' values and emotions to transform the way they think and approach their work or life.\n\nBehaviorist theory encompasses a person's leadership skills are developed and trained as products of their environment.\n\nBehavioral theory is where a leader models certain behaviors, setting a good example for others to follow.\n\nFunctional theory is leadership based on a collection of people's behaviors and group dynamics, not individuals.\n\nPath goal theory is where leaders set goals and smooth the path to those goals to motivate and drive performance.\n\nLeadership vs. management\n\nThe terms leadership and management are used interchangeably, but they aren't the same concept. Leadership roles involve creating and articulating a vision and inspiring others to want to work toward that vision. But leaders might not be skilled at or involved with the day-to-day management of the work needed to turn that vision into a reality.\n\nManagement is the oversight of the tactical steps required to complete the work and achieve the objectives. Good managers excel at articulating the steps required to complete tasks and holding people accountable for doing assigned work. Leaders can be good managers and good managers can be good leaders. Very often, managers are put into positions where they need to exhibit leadership characteristics, such as motivating and aligning employees to goals. Likewise, leaders often must take on management tasks, such as holding employees accountable for an organization's goals and vision.\n\nSome specific differences between leaders and managers include the following:\n\nLeaders Managers\n\nWhat makes a great leader?\n\nSeveral attributes separate good leadership from great leadership, including the following:\n\nStrong, realistic visions.\n\nClear and effective communication.\n\nAdaptability, flexibility and creativity.\n\nHonesty.\n\nPatience.\n\nResiliency.\n\nEmotional intelligence and empathy.\n\nIntegrity.\n\nCollaboration.\n\nPassion.\n\nFairness.\n\nCultural awareness.\n\nIntelligence and expertise.\n\nStrategic and visionary decision-making.\n\nPersuade, motivate, empower and inspire.\n\nGreat leaders inspire people, motivating them to do what it takes to achieve the leader's and organization's goals. Former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower articulated this idea when he said, \"Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.\"\n\nLeadership styles\n\nThe following leadership styles are among the many commonly seen in business and other organizations:\n\nAffiliative leaders foster positive group dynamics.\n\nAuthoritative leaders provide clear direction and require compliance.\n\nAutocratic leaders maintain complete control and decision-making powers.\n\nCharismatic leaders use sociable and charming personality traits to persuade followers.\n\nCoaching leaders teach and motivate others to reach goals.\n\nCoercive leaders force people to follow instructions whether they want to or not.\n\nCommand and control, also called bureaucratic, leaders establish strict rules and regulations.\n\nDemocratic leaders focus on compromise and group consensus; they include others in decision-making.\n\nInnovative leaders foster creativity and adaptability.\n\nLaissez-faire leaders take a hands-off approach.\n\nPacesetter leaders use emotional-leadership styles to drive employees to achieve goals at a high rate.\n\nTransactional leaders use a system of rewards and punishment.\n\nServant leaders focus on serving the needs of the group and the greater good.\n\nSituational leaders adapt their style to different situations and people.\n\nStrategic leaders focuses use different management styles to develop adaptable strategies.\n\nTransformational leaders motivate others to grow both professionally and personally.\n\nHow to become a better leader\n\nThe workplace has changed dramatically over the last few years, with the increase of remote work and the growing importance placed on employee touchpoints, such as diversity, equity and inclusion. There are several leadership qualities that can be refined to help individuals become better leaders:\n\nBecome more self-aware. Great leaders know their strengths, weaknesses and effects on the people they lead. They set a good example and model good behavior. One way to become more self-aware is to seek feedback from those people.\n\nRefine communication skills. Leaders should be effective and clear in their communication; they must also be good listeners. Communication should be based in openness, honesty and transparency. This involves setting clear goals and expectations and giving regular feedback to employees.\n\nConnect with team members. Connections build trust, understanding and bonds that are critical for successful leadership. The best leaders should get to know the personalities and capabilities of their team members.\n\nEncourage growth. The best leaders encourage their own, their colleagues' and their employees' or followers' personal and professional growth. Encouraging growth strengthens bonds and trust between leaders and team members, and increases what teams can accomplish.\n\nBe open to change. Change is inevitable in business; being open to it and encouraging new ideas and perspectives from team members can help leaders become more effective.\n\nDevelop positive attitudes. Responding to negative situations and problems with positive approaches and encouragement is a great way to model and improve problem-solving skills.\n\nSeek out growth opportunities. Great leaders look for opportunities for continuous improvement and education. This can involve attending conferences, finding a mentor and reading books on leadership.\n\nLeadership training and development\n\nMany individuals inherently possess some leadership traits, but most people must develop many of the characteristics associated with leadership. The following are some of the leadership training and development programs available:\n\nAriel Group.\n\nCenter for Creative Leadership Development Program.\n\nColumbia Business School's Executive Education Program.\n\nDale Carnegie.\n\nGlobal Knowledge.\n\nHarvard Business School's Executive Education Programs.\n\nINSEAD.\n\nThe Ken Blanchard Companies.\n\nMaxwell Leadership.\n\nMind Tools.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management's Executive Education Program.\n\nOpenLearn.\n\nSkillsoft.\n\nStanford Graduate School of Business Leadership.\n\nLeadership in hybrid and remote environments\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the number of remote workers tripled between 2019 and 2021. This shift to hybrid and remote environments has made leadership skills, such as flexibility, adaptability, communication and empathy, even more important.\n\nWith more employees working from home, it's important to focus on employee well-being and engagement. Leaders must develop a culture that includes virtual culture-building programs, such as book clubs, townhalls, mentorship programs and other events.\n\nLeaders should also adapt their communication skills to hybrid and remote environments. This includes virtual check-ins, team meetings and workshops to ensure everyone has a clear understanding of goals and projects. Additionally, leaders must trust that their employees are productive in their remote or hybrid environments and hold employees accountable without violating that trust.\n\nLeadership is a critical skill in the C-suite.
