        "text": "The other peoples casually keep socializing and eating, getting dirty looks from the big cats, but what can they say? They're the assholes who were trolling me in my sleep. They wanted me here, they can take me the rest of the way. Fack! How'd they even lead me away? I remember doing a quick circuit around to grab some more fire poison trees, but I didn't move far, so how far did they take me?\n\nI'm grumbling as they lead me through narrow paths, well worn from their failed attempts or from patrols?, into an area with strange vegetation. The plants don't look bad. Just different. What were trees are now clumps of vines. Not super weird or unfamiliar. The whole area just looks like someone imported a bunch of other plants, trying to make the area look like somewhere less tropical.\n\n\"This area around the den has been corrupted,\" Green Crescent sucks her teeth. How? \"It will take time to get this cleared, and more time for it to recover.\"\n\nSo subtle. I glare at her, roll my eyes, sigh, then summon crescents.\n\n\"Stay clear,\" I grumble and start clear cutting.\n\nShe roars, part of me nearly shitting myself, another part of me wishing she'd shut up, and keep working. Some of the plants release puffs of miasma when cut, a nice fog forming around me as the sacred kitties shout threats and curses while racing away. And~ collect.\n\nI should be good on collecting essences and what not, but is there a storage limit on the crystal? I'm not sure what the rules are for Qi and Sacred Jade storage are. Do items stack or does it count individual items as unique?\n\nI go to toss a crescent and have to pull up when I see a big cat casually sniffing around one of the stumps I cut. Tch! I've been auto-filtering. It looks at me, definitely notes me trying to work, and keeps investigating. Standing right in the way. Fucking cats. I narrow my eyes at it, target the clump of vegetation past it, then throw.\n\nGreen Crescent swats the crescent away, smacking the horse-sized cat before scruffing it and walking out of my clearing path with a big cat just casually dangling from her mouth, its paws not touching the ground. She's a big bish.\n\nI see another cat in the corrupted vegetation, casually sniffing at my wayward blade, and will a destruction binding from string tricks into the blade, exploding it before it dissolves back into essence. There's an unpleasant twinge in my head and I rub my arm under my nose, wiping away a bit of ichor. Cool. It worked.\n\nAnnoying... These frickin' oversized house cats keep sneaking in to the yet to be cleared areas because it's safe, question mark? How the fuck is the miasma more dangerous than my blades, or do they just expect me to work around them? 'Cause I won't. They're getting in my way, not the other way around. Even Green Crescent gave up on running herd on these assholes. No goodbye or I'll check back later. Just watched her looking like something interesting is gonna happen somewhere else. So I guess the cave is in here somewhere.\n\nBy night I'm on a bald patch of mountainside, super small in comparison to everywhere else, with a series of openings, alarmingly large, leading deeper into the mountain. This looks more like the cliffside openings that the crawling hands didn't use. Maybe they were attempts by the other peoples to dig them out. Didn't work. Those bishes had tunnels and smaller hidden doors everywhere. I see traces of miasma deeper in some of the caves, and I slowly realize that my range on collecting and clearing is way higher than it used to be. Shit.\n\nIt's gonna be harder to follow traces of essence and aura if I'm cleaning them before I realize they're there. This sucks. I'm gonna leave the stumps so the roots can keep doing rooty things. Pretty sure that deforesting places is bad, right? So if the stumps stay the roots can keep the top soil in place. I think. I have no idea how this shit works! I turn around and storm into a cave that still has traces coming out of it, figuring if nothing else the miasma would keep the assholes out. Until I clear it. Fack.\n\nI'm pretty sure the lyrics I'm singing are, like, 90% wrong. I'm wandering through caverns with multiple openings into other caverns, but there aren't any real tunnels. My voice doesn't echo back as much as I figure it should and there's a lot of flooded tunnels. Or are these just cave pools? Iono, but there's a lot of liquid in this mountain. Not all of it is actual water.\n\nI've found a pool of liquid Qi being generated by a pearl, all collected, including the bits and pieces of Qi infused pebbles and sticks. There are some very powerful pests, regular rats, frogs, and fish that have been turned into super snacks by their time spent in the Qi. So essence causes things to change? Not Qi? Maybe the Qi would help them live longer if I hadn't wandered by. Wonder if I'm supposed to eat them as is or cook them? I'll ask later.\n\nI punch the wall, trying to dislodge the shiny stone. And break nothing. Not even my own hand. I give a prayer of thanks and then wonder if this is one of those bullshit things where I can make a stone pickaxe and it'll work, but my fist, which can punch through dragon scale -- probably --, isn't good enough. 'Cause reasons. I glare at the cave wall, narrowing my eyes and growling. It wants me to use a piercing tool? My new stingers come up and I reinforce them with wimble energy and Qi, the world vibrating around me as a breeze kicks up. I've got plenty of penetrating power, jackass.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm mentally trash talking a wall, but I'm just happy I'm not saying any of this out loud. Pretty sure I've got an inner monologue now. I sing a super space soldier show theme song out loud while I stab and punch, but that's on purpose. My stingers do pierce the wall, the wall fills with cracks, then my fists break the stone loose. This works. Don't know why I can't just punch the wall, but I found a solution. Fack. I know I'm a tool but I really want to shout it out. But I don't want to deal with the fallout of the admittedly funny joke of throwing one's hands up and shouting \"I am a tool!\" only to find that there are people actively watching you. It's funny, but I don't want to deal with people like that. I'm not anti-social. Other people are tools, too.\n\nEventually I clear enough Qi stone for it to start pulling away from the regular stone in chunks. I'm not sure why there are layers of stone like that, but it's super useful. Once the walls are no longer shimmering and gem like I move on. I don't know if the odd colored bits of rock are metal or not, and I can look at the streaks in the stone to see that I'm looking at a mineral of some sort, but I don't think I have enough knowledge, or maybe I need to upgrade the skill... Whatever, I don't know what the fack this stuff is. But I mine it. I don't know if I have to mine it, but nothing happens when I want to collect it, so either some part of me thinks I want the whole mountain and another part of me drop kicks that part to ensure it doesn't accidentally kill me, or I have to mine. So... I'm a tool!\n\nEnsure your favorite authors get the support they deserve. Read this novel on the original website.\n\nEmpty... Empty... Not empty! Two plain caverns then one filled with what appears to be ice. I gather the ice, 'cause void bug is synonymous with hoarder, heh. Oh.\n\n\"Ew.\"\n\nI recoil when I find a dried up big cat corpse. I guess it got freeze dried? The cold is coming from... It... 'S mouth. It's got freezing teeth. As in teeth that generate cold. Ice essence? I've got a new essence. Water and wind? Wasn't there something else that was water and wind? No. Wait. I do have Ice. Ice is air and water. Why is this wind and water? Oh! Wind is much stronger. Is this some kind of upgraded ice? Yeah... Even in my last world there were different types of ice, weren't there? Like gases and stuff that freeze. And different levels of \"this is frozen\". Cool.\n\nWait. Do the teeth count as ice artifacts, then? I stash the corpse and keep collecting ice and find a chunk of someone else. Whatever the cat was fighting is stubby in comparison. And muscular. Stonky with digging claws. Is this an arm of the corrupted creature or someone else? Wait. How long has the corruption been here? 'Cause if people have been using these caves for a hot minute then I'm gonna run across lots of old battles. Maybe. Let's find out!\n\nI march onwards, hands swinging to a high-tech task force theme song, yes, I'm still singing kid's show tunes while rubbernecking like the greedy tourist I am. This cave has water and a few pale fish. I don't know if they're rare or not but I'm getting tired. I guess the mining took a lot out of me. Or I've been awake too long. Weird how I thought it was weird that I was sleeping so much, now it's weird that I'm awake. Blech.\n\nThere's a loud, long scream and I scream. Like a bitch. It's been so quiet for so long, just me and my theme songs and then someone starts dying somewhere. Oh. Someone's dying somewhere. Fack. Where are they?\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nFack. I'm that guy. I'm running through an unknown maze, not marking where I've been or where I'm going, towards sounds of distress in the distance, knowing there's something dangerous somewhere nearby. And I'm SHOUTING! It takes everything in me to resist shouting \"I'm coming!\" as I sprint headlong towards the badness. Fack, I'm such a child...\n\nI sprint out of an opening into the air, falling a little, and landing in a large hollow. The drop is just a little over my height, maybe a me and a half, and there are a lot less openings in this cavern. Which is filled with miasma. And is occupied.\n\n\"Oh, hi,\" I snark to myself as I register there's someone, either a mutated hunan or something with a hunan form, curled up in the middle of the cavern.\n\nWhoever they are they slowly climb to their knees and elbows, their back is hunched and bumpy, a hunchback? No. A shell. They've got a turtle shell and short, messy pale hair, barely finger length on a disturbingly human head. That's it. They look human. Not just hunan. Hunans seem like normal people cosplaying as super heroes. That's the best I can think of. Not physically. Personality wise. They act like people pretending to be other people.\n\n\"Did you get dragged to this world, too?\" I ask. Then I notice they're glaring at me.\n\n\"Bastards!\" they squirm, fists clenched before squinting at me.\n\nI want to focus but they've got a super shiny thing sticking out of their shell. And every time they move it sparkles then miasma comes out. Pretty sure a tool that makes miasma is a bad. It's not like it's even generating other elements. It's literally just spewing out wisps of miasma. I'm hyper focusing, but I can't stop. When they charge at me I just step to the side and grab the item, ripping it out. What is it? It's a knife. Dagger? Really long short blade that's too small to be any kind of sword. They grab me and I bank the knife -- it's mine now! --, but they don't seem to notice. How much pain were they in that they don't notice me tearing a chunk out of them?\n\n\"You're gonna burn!\" they scream before igniting.\n\nOh~. There's all this liquid-y stuff and icy stuff, kinda just assumed they were water or plant based. Maybe earth when I saw the shell. Nah, this dude torches himself on purpose. With basic fire. I blink at him, unaffected. Take a deep breath, still unaffected. Then grin.\n\n\"You gonna try to burn me or keep practicing until you're ready?\"\n\nWhat is wrong with me? But, seriously. Tier 1 basic bitch fire? And he's trying to burn me? He lets out a confused \"what?\", and I'm so happy to know I'm not the only one that asks the same question when I'm confused. He's got me in a hug so I hug him back, heh, and then stab him and pump him full of fire poison. His eyes widen, pupils getting real~ big then shrinking down before going back to normal. Then he grins at me and all my fuzzy feelings go away.\n\n\"Oh, yeah!\" he says and I feel all kinds of violated. He's enjoying this way too much. \"Where the fuck did you think those trees came from, asshole?!\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I shout back in his face. \"I just got here! Some flamingo things kept attacking me, then there were these lions and tigers, and now I'm here with your special brand of bullshit! Why the fuck do you have a turtle shell and why did you have a dagger that farts out miasma?!\"\n\n\"You knew about the dagger?\"\n\nHe goes from manic to homicidal, releasing his hold. I don't let him get away, opting to bearhug his arms to his sides, no longer pumping venom into him but using my spikes to hold him in place as well. When he can't pull free he grins again, his neck bulging before slowly stretching out, still thick and knotted. And~ new nightmare fuel acquired. Why is his head shitting out more neck?\n\n\"You are so gross,\" I shudder before making a bubble of Tier 2 Fire lightning and then filling it with us inside.\n\nHe screams and writhes, miasma pouring out of the wound in his back, his eyes, ears, some cuts and scratches, any and every opening in his body. And I collect it all. Until he giraffe headbutts me. He doesn't just bring his head back then slam it forward. He whips his head around then slams it sideways into the side of my head. He's using his head like a frickin' flail. Whatever happened to just biting someone?\n\n\"Could you not?!\" I scream as he whips his head around, twice, then bludgeons me again. \"You are so gross!\"\n\n\"Fuck you, snowflake!\" he shouts, winding up again.\n\n\"The fuck are you calling a 'snowflake'?\" I collect the Tier 2 Fire and squeeze harder.\n\nI can't get me arms around his shell but I'm hoping to crack it. My fingers fit nicely in the grooves between plates, but I was kinda expecting to be able to punch through by now.\n\n\"Wanna burn? I got your fire, right here!\" I make sure I've got a good grip, nearly losing it when he starts laughing.\n\n\"Well, light 'em up, boy!\"\n\nThis bish did not just \"boy\" me.\n\n\"Okay, boomer.\"\n\nThe look of startled guilt on his face. Dude just tried some shady shit and found out he had an audience. This is why inner monologue. You think I'm gonna let him live that shiz down? I swap the fire lightning for actual lightning to stop him from being weird, then switch over to Arcane Fire to let 'em cook. And he does. Cooks and screams. Why does he smell like the fish fry?"
