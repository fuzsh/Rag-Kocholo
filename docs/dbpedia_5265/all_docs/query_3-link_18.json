        "text": "Religious discrimination involves treating a person (an applicant or employee) unfavorably because of his or her religious beliefs. The law protects not only people who belong to traditional, organized religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, but also others who have sincerely held religious, ethical or moral beliefs.\n\nReligious discrimination can also involve treating someone differently because that person is married to (or associated with) an individual of a particular religion.\n\nReligious Discrimination & Work Situations\n\nThe law forbids discrimination when it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, and any other term or condition of employment.\n\nReligious Discrimination & Harassment\n\nIt is illegal to harass a person because of his or her religion.\n\nHarassment can include, for example, offensive remarks about a person's religious beliefs or practices. Although the law doesn't prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that aren't very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).\n\nThe harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.\n\nReligious Discrimination and Segregation\n\nTitle VII also prohibits workplace or job segregation based on religion (including religious garb and grooming practices), such as assigning an employee to a non-customer contact position because of actual or feared customer preference.\n\nReligious Discrimination & Reasonable Accommodation\n\nThe law requires an employer or other covered entity to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious beliefs or practices, unless doing so would cause a burden that is substantial in the overall context of the employer’s business taking into account all relevant factors, including the particular accommodation at issue and its practical impact in light of the nature, size, and operating cost of the employer. This means an employer may be required to make reasonable adjustments to the work environment that will allow an employee to practice his or her religion.\n\nExamples of some common religious accommodations include flexible scheduling, voluntary shift substitutions or swaps, job reassignments, and modifications to workplace policies or practices.\n\nReligious Accommodation/Dress & Grooming Policies\n\nUnless it would be an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business, an employer must reasonably accommodate an employee's religious beliefs or practices. This applies not only to schedule changes or leave for religious observances, but also to such things as dress or grooming practices that an employee has for religious reasons. These might include, for example, wearing particular head coverings or other religious dress (such as a Jewish yarmulke or a Muslim headscarf), or wearing certain hairstyles or facial hair (such as Rastafarian dreadlocks or Sikh uncut hair and beard). It also includes an employee's observance of a religious prohibition against wearing certain garments (such as pants or miniskirts).\n\nWhen an employee or applicant needs a dress or grooming accommodation for religious reasons, he should notify the employer that he needs such an accommodation for religious reasons. If the employer reasonably needs more information, the employer and the employee should engage in an interactive process to discuss the request. If it would not pose an undue hardship, the employer must grant the accommodation.\n\nReligious Discrimination & Reasonable Accommodation & Undue Hardship\n\nAn employer does not have to accommodate an employee's religious beliefs or practices if doing so would cause undue hardship to the employer. Undue hardship is shown when a burden is substantial in the overall context of an employer’s business, taking into account all relevant factors in the case at hand, including the particular accommodation at issue and its practical impact in light of the nature, size and operating cost of the employer. An accommodation may cause undue hardship if it is costly, compromises workplace safety, decreases workplace efficiency, infringes on the rights of other employees, or requires other employees to unwillingly do more than their share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work.\n\nReligious Discrimination And Employment Policies/Practices\n\nAn employee cannot be forced to participate (or not participate) in a religious activity as a condition of employment."
