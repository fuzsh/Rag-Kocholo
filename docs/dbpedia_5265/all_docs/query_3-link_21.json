        "text": "When terms denoting family relationships are used as proper nouns (as names), they are capitalized. However, when the terms are used as common nouns (not as names), they’re not capitalized. Generally, there will be a possessive adjective (my, her, his, our) or an article (the, a, an) in front of family titles used as common nouns.\n\nIt’s easy to get confused about whether you should capitalize family names in your writing. If you come across a family “title” such as mom or dad in your writing, ask yourself: Is this title being used as if it were a person’s name? Is the person being directly addressed?\n\nHere’s a tip: Want to make sure your writing shines? Grammarly can check your spelling and save you from grammar and punctuation mistakes. It even proofreads your text, so your work is extra polished wherever you write.\n\nYour writing, at its best\n\nGrammarly helps you communicate confidently\n\nExamples of family titles\n\nCan I go to the mall once I finish my homework, Mom?\n\nI know the crash was serious, Dad, but I’d really like to borrow your car.\n\nWhat have you been up to, Grandma?\n\nIn the examples above, Mom, Dad, and Grandma are capitalized because they are being used like names. You could replace them with proper names without changing the rest of the sentence.\n\nWhat have you been up to, Diana?\n\nIf a family member is not being directly addressed, but rather is being spoken about, his or her family title should not be capitalized, and an article or possessive adjective should be used before the title.\n\nGracie asked her mom if she could go to the mall after finishing her homework.\n\nI asked my dad if I could borrow his car the day after the crash.\n\nLorraine wondered what her grandmother had been up to.\n\nWhen quoting a conversation, simply think about whether that person is being directly addressed in the conversation."
