        "text": "Jim New Supporter Just a follower of Jesus Christ and him only!\n\nGods word is very clear about this- the book of James 2:24-26 says \"faith without works(deeds) is dead\" gotta have both. Where most Christians get confused about this issue is in the initial stage of salvation, this is where faith alone comes in- believing in Christ, no amount of works(nothing we can do) can save us. We can be the kindest, gentlest most compassionate loving person but without faith in Christ we're not saved and we can have all the faith in the world but without works(deeds) its dead. After the initial stage of salvation then faith must go one step further and that is in deeds(works). We just can't say we trust in Christ without doing anything to show for it. In other words I can say I believe in Christ but If I don't show love,kindness,outreach to the needy and so on then faith alone is dead. We must have faith plus works to please God! And yes, we will be judged by our works! Revelations 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works! 2 Corinthians 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive a reward of the deeds done in the body; things according to what he hath done, whether good or bad. To Him be the Glory.\n\nJamie Page Supporter Pastor\n\nSimple answer, no. Only becuase you are \"Christ's workmanship\" who relies on Christ's work in your place. But, that does not mean we don't work. In fact, it's the only real reason for working. Just as justification is by faith alone. (Justification is being declared righteous by God - just as if you never sinned - just as if you always obeyed). Many Christians move from justification by faith alone to sanctification by mostly “me alone” with a little help from the Holy Spirit. (Sanctification is being set apart for holiness and growing in Christlikeness). Look, what you can't miss is a phrase that James uses several times in his short and very important letter. That phrase is \"Law of Liberty.\" This phrase is what Paul says in Galatians 5.6 as \"faith working through love.\" James's point, and Paul's is this: Because Jesus has both - note both - died for our sin of not doing good works and crediting all of His righteousness of doing His own good works to us, then - and only then, do we do good works freely. Because the cross of Jesus accomplishes both the forgiveness of sin and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness (that means just as God the Father looks at Jesus and says “This is My Son and with Him I AM well pleased.” So God looks at us and says “You are My Son/My Daughter and with you I AM well pleased. Not because of your work but because of your Savior’s work.” There is a deep issue seen even in the wording of your question: \"Will we be judged...\" It's a \"motivation\" question. What do I get or don't get for believing and working. Look, we can't be free of motivation unless all of the credit for doing the work is already accomplished. That's why James calls it the law of liberty, and Paul says \"all that remains [for us to do] is faith working through love. Therefore, just as justification is by faith alone, so is sanctification. And as Paul tells the Ephesian church “walk as children of light” because you are children of light. “You do who you are.” Not “you do to be who you are.” I should add a huge thing that is implied in my answer, but hasn't been made explicit...yet. That's this: As one answer pointed to \"you know a tree by it's fruit\" we can't miss the gospel in that. The gospel point is that WE ARE ALL BAD FRUIT. Yet, Jesus -the only good fruit - became our nastiness so that we could become good fruit. I often make this point asking a few quesitons. 1. What does the Bible say about God. 2. What does the Bible say about people. 3. Because of that what should I just do? 4. HUGE!! How am I not doing it? 5. How did Jesus do it perfectly, earning all righteousness? 6. How is Jesus's death on the cross satisfactory for my sin and how does God see me in Christ's perfect obedience of - alone - being the good fruit. 7. Because I'm new in Christ, therefore how can I live in Christ to do what He commands - through the empowerment of the gospel (Romans 8.11)?\n\nMeluleki Maphosa Supporter\n\nThe parable of the wedding garment is quite helpful in view, to this question. Everyone is invited, even those that thought they did not qualify. Everyone is issued with the garment free of charge, by the King Himself. The only requirement is for the guests to put on the garment and keep it clean for the feast. In other words once you have put on the garment it is your responsibility to keep it clean as you await the feast to begin. It is the same with salvation. (Mat 1:21) She will bring a son to birth, and when she does, you, Joseph, will name him Jesus--'God saves'--because he will save his people from their sins.\" Jesus does not save us in our sins but from our sins. Jesus forgave the sins of the woman caught in adultery, but added \"Go and sin no more\". The duty of man is to do the will of God. The will of God is contained in the bible, from Genesis to Revelation. Jesus likened it to bread, we have to eat it everyday and grow everyday. As you read through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, you learn new things and you have to do (deeds/ works) those things. God will ignore those things that you did not know (times of ignorance), but as you grow through reading his word, you will have an obligation to do the works expected of a child of God. Surely if a murderer were to repent, even society would expect him to stop murder, and produce good works. This may be dramatic but it brings home the point.\n\nJudy Jentz Supporter Christian, Lay Person Who Studys God's Living Word\n\nWhen I first began my journey of studying the Bible I was afraid I would not understand any of it and I wanted to know what everything meant. So, I ordered a DVD set by a theologian, who went through the Books verse by verse and then did commentary. When he cam to the aspect of Christians being judged, he said that this judgment would determine what area in Heaven in which we would serve God. In other words, the more good deeds, the higher upper on the scale of serving God. I have yet to get any other answer, as I have wondered about this myself. I realize if you have a true faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior you are truly going to change outwardly and inwardly. Faith and deeds just go together. If a person is in a relationship with someone and really cares about that person, they are going to show it in how they act towards them. It will not consist of negativity, beating, arguing, etc. It will be all kind, generous, selflessness, etc. Since I have been studying the Bible I can truly say that God's Word has changed me inwardly and outwardly. I have been born again. Not that I didn't believe in God before, but I was not an acting Christian. Here is a verse to show we are now clean: 1 Corinthians 6:11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. If not for knowing and believing in this with all my heart and soul, I probably would not have had the changes in me that have taken place. I wouldn't be producing good deeds. But they just come naturally when with all your heart and soul, you know God and His love and all He has done for us.\n\nDan Rivers Supporter Christian, Husband, Grandfather, Son, AT&T retiree\n\nThose with the indwelling Holy Spirit will NOT be judged! Rom 8:1 NIV - Therefore, there is now NO CONDEMNATION for those who are in Christ Jesus, Jhn 5:24 NIV - \"Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and WILL NOT BE JUDGED but has crossed over from death to life. Jhn 3:16 NLT - \"For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who BELIEVES in him will not perish BUT HAVE eternal life. Rom 5:9 NIV - Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall WE BE SAVED from God's WRATH through him! Rev 3:10 NIV - Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also KEEP YOU FROM THE HOUR OF TRIAL that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth. Only those with the HS in them can endure... Rom 8:11 NIV - And IF the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead IS living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you. I don't see works, baptism or anything else mentioned at all...All we must do is believe! Jesus was asked about works, here's his answer... Jhn 6:28 NIV - Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the WORKS God requires?\" Jhn 6:29 NIV - Jesus answered, \"The WORK of God is this: to BELIEVE in the one he has sent.\" In the Old Testament the Jews had to it all for him. In GRACE God does it all for us! All Glory and Praise to the Lord...none for me... PS- One more thing...God says that once he forgives he forgets...Heb 8:12, Heb 10:17...He doesn't remember nor does he keep a record of our sins... Ps 130:3, Rom 4:6... So how will he judge those he's forgiven if he doesn't remember and doesn't keep a record of our sins? When we appear in front of the Lord, he will look at us and know that we've been made righteous by the blood of Jesus and he'll say, \"Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. Rev 22:14 NIV\n\nTim Beeker Supporter\n\nYes, one will be judged. Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw — each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire. (I Cor. 3:12-15) Don't forget: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Master, Master,’ shall enter into the reign of the heavens, but he who is doing the desire of My Father in the heavens. “Many shall say to Me in that day, ‘Master, Master, have we not prophesied in Your Name, and cast out demons in Your Name, and done many mighty works in Your Name?’ And then I shall declare to them, ‘I never knew you, depart from Me, you who work lawlessness!’ (Mt. 7:21-23) Yes, everyone will be judged. Those who are of unbelief, those who are true belief, and those who say they believe, but truly do not.\n\nBrian Stewart Supporter\n\n17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them (Matt 7) The answer is yes you will be judged for your deeds. As a Christian you must bring forth the fruit of a christian. Jesus issued forth judgements on the 7 churches of Asia. This was not written to the world but to the church. 5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent (Rev 2:5) 10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. 12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. (Rom 14) Notice the words \"us\" and \"we\". This is Paul writing to the church at Rome not to sinners. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works Just \" getting saved\" is not enough, you have to line up with the bible. If anything will do, nothing will do just as well.\n\nEzekiel Kimosop - Pastor & Bible Scholar Supporter\n\nOf course believers will be judged because Paul clearly declares that if judgment shall begin with the house of God, how much more will it be for the wicked. God's children will not be judged on the basis of their faith but on their obedience and service to the Lord. Paul says that our works will be judged or tested to see how sound they are but at the worst of things we shall escape with nothing to show for our diligence in serving God. Our crowns will not shine and we shall be ashamed of our lost opportunity to do good while we had time. I do not believe we shall face the same judgment as the sinners because Romans 8:1-2says \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.\" Jesus has given us eternal life on the basis of the faith we have in Christ by which he has washed our sins and in which we are declared righteous in the presence of God. We do not earn salvation on the basis of our works but if we deliberately sin an go on in sin in the false belief that we are freed from condemnation then Hebrews has the answer where it declares that we shall vex God and may lose our salvation\n\nDruunah Dreamze Supporter\n\nThe actual gospel message is literally written out for us plainly in God's Word: The Gospel is found in 1st Corinthians 15:1-4: “Now, brothers, I want to remind you of THE GOSPEL I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this Gospel you are SAVED, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of FIRST IMPORTANCE: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures…” Notice that there is no mention of repentance of sins or water baptism, or discipleship included as the way to be saved. These are NOT part of the saving Gospel. The Bible clearly says that salvation is “not of works, lest any man should boast.” (Ephesians 2:9) Everyone who believes in Jesus alone, without simultaneously relying on his or her good works to be saved, has everlasting life. (John 6:47: \"Most assuredly, I say to you, he [or she] who believes HAS everlasting life.”) Many Christians find it difficult to understand the idea of eternal security or salvation. This subject has also led to significant disagreements among Christians. Some who still have an attachment to the flesh and its callousness find it difficult to understand the idea that the salvation we have in Christ is eternal and cannot be lost so long as Christ lives. AT THE MOMENT OF SALVATION = In whom ye also trusted, after that, ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were SEALED with that holy Spirit of promise. (Ephesians 1:13-14) To deny eternal security is to deny God’s free gift of eternal life because God is the only One who can provide eternal salvation! (1 John 5:20) Jesus Christ is our eternal security, and people need to grasp that He is our Rock. What part of Rock they don’t even understand? That’s sad when they attack the believer's eternal security, they are actually attacking the real Jesus Christ of the Bible. **Colossians 1:13 KJV Who HATH DELIVERED US FROM THE POWER OF DARKNESS, AND HATH TRANSLATED US INTO THE KINGDOM OF HIS DEAR SON:” **Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.” **Ephesians 2:10 KJV - For WE ARE HIS WORKMANSHIP, CREATED IN CHRIST JESUS unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.” **Titus 3:4-6 KJV - But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, [5] Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, BY THE WASHING OF REGENERATION, AND RENEWING OF THE HOLY GHOST; [6] WHICH HE SHED ON US ABUNDANTLY through Jesus Christ our Saviour; **Titus 3:7 KJV- That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.” **Romans 3:24 KJV - Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:” **Romans 11:6 KJV - And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.” **Ephesians 1:13-14 KJV- In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, YE WERE SEALED WITH THAT HOLY SPIRIT OF PROMISE” **1 Timothy 1:16 KJV - Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to THEM which should hereafter BELIEVE on HIM to LIFE EVERLASTING.” **Romans 6:23b KJV - For the wages of sin is death; but THE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nJohn Mulvihill Supporter\n\nHebrews 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. Jesus is the Author and Finisher of our faith. It begins and ends with him. Christ is the foundation of our faith. Our works are laid on the foundation. He is the Solid Rock of our salvation. Ephesians 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. If God prepared the work, or before ordained it, then all the glory belongs to Jesus. Salvation is when you trust in Jesus as your Savior. Acts2:40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. 41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. In one day were added 3,000 souls. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved on the spot, period! Don't muddy the waters with what you do. Some will do a little, some will do a lot, but they will be saved just the same. Salvation by Christ alone. Grace is not a license to sin, unless you like conviction of the spirit, and God's correction. I prefer to live in God's blessing. I prefer that he hear my prayers and supplications, so that I can pray for others, and be an effective witness of the gospel.\n\nJohn Morris Supporter\n\nScripture states; ‘Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.’ And Jesus said to him, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in paradise’” (Luke 23:39-43) So, after the cross we see n John 20:1-17 that Jesus meets Mary in the garden on the first day of the week and says, ‘Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.’” The Scriptures are clear that Christ had not ascended to the Father on Sunday morning. Therefore, He could not have been with the thief in paradise on Friday. It is very possible that Jesus is promising that the thief will be with him in paradise eventually. This would have to be so or Jesus would seem to be telling an untruth by contradicting John 20:17. The greater picture here is that Jesus promised the thief that he would go to paradise...and I believe the thief more than likely, being nailed on a cross, had no time to perform any \"believer\" type works yet was granted paradise as a reward for his confession of belief alone. Romans 10:10: For with your heart you believe and are justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved. Great discussion..."
