        "text": "You have 30 days from the date of purchase to title and pay sales tax on your newly purchased trailer. If you do not title the trailer within 30 days, there is a title penalty of $25 on the 31st day after purchase. The penalty increases another $25 for every 30 days you are late with a maximum penalty of $200.\n\nTrailer definition\n\nExemptions\n\nTo title and register a trailer in the state of Missouri, the owner must submit the following\n\nProof of ownership\n\nYou will pay\n\nEstimate your taxes\n\nHomemade Trailer Inspection Requirements\n\nTrailer definition\n\nA trailer is a unit attached to and towed by a motorized vehicle designed to carry property and/or passengers. A trailer cannot be motorized or self-operable. A trailer may include (but is not limited to) the following:\n\nHomemade trailers;\n\nKit trailers;\n\nFarm wagons;\n\nBoat trailers;\n\nUtility trailers;\n\nFlat bed trailers;\n\nSemi trailers;\n\nLivestock trailers; and\n\nCamping trailers\n\nExemptions\n\nThe following types of trailers are exempt from titling and registration:\n\nCotton trailers\n\nTow dollies\n\nCertain hay trailers\n\nTo title and register a trailer in the state of Missouri, the owner must submit the following:\n\nThe Certificate of Title or Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO), properly signed over to you (see instructions);\n\nA signed Application for Missouri Title and License (Form 108);\n\nAn original paid personal property tax receipt or a statement of non-assessment from your county of residence (or city of St. Louis) for the previous year, if registering the trailer.\n\nNotarized Lien Release (Form 4809), if applicable.\n\nProof of ownership\n\nIn most cases (as outlined above), the applicant for title will submit a Certificate of Title or a Manufacturerâs Statement of Origin (MSO) as proof of ownership. However, there are certain exceptions:\n\nOut-of-State purchase â Some states do not title or register trailers. In those cases, the applicant must submit a bill of sale as proof of ownership. To verify whether a title or a bill of sale is required for a used trailer purchased from an out-of-state seller, Ask Motor Vehicle! Your email should include the weight of the trailer, as well as a description of the type of trailer and the name of the state where the seller resides.\n\nKit â A trailer that is purchased from a retailer (in- or out-of-state) as a kit will not normally come with an MSO. In that case, the applicant may submit a bill of sale or paid invoice.\n\nFarm Wagon â An applicant who is applying for title to a farm wagon may submit a bill of sale, paid invoice, or a statement with the unit description, name of seller, purchase price, and all facts regarding how ownership was acquired.\n\nYou will pay\n\nState sales tax of 4.225 percent and any local sales tax due on the net purchase price (the purchase price less trade-in allowance or other allowance, if any). Local sales tax is based on the rate where you live, not where you bought the trailer.\n\nNOTE: If you owned and operated the trailer in another state for at least 90 days prior to titling and registering in Missouri, no sales tax is due. Owners who have owned the trailer for less than 90 days and paid sales tax to another state, less than the amount of Missouri State and local taxes, will be required to show proof of payment of those taxes and also pay the difference of the two amounts.\n\n$8.50 title fee\n\nThe applicable registration fee;\n\n$7.50 â 1-year registration\n\n$22.50 â 3-year registration\n\n$52.50 â Permanent registration\n\n$6.00 title processing fee; and\n\n$6.00 registration processing fee, if applicable.\n\nEstimate your taxes:\n\nUse our online sales tax calculator for an estimate of the taxes.\n\nHomemade Trailer Inspection Requirements:\n\nIf you have constructed your own homemade trailer you will not pay sales tax when you title the unit, but there are special inspection requirements.\n\nEffective August 28, 2019, all homemade trailers, regardless of the length of the trailer, must be inspected by either the Sheriff in your county of residence, or by authorized personnel from the Missouri State Highway Patrol ($25 inspection fee).\n\nAn Application for Vehicle/Trailer Identification Number Plate or Verification (Form 5062) must be completed at the time of inspection.\n\nYou may obtain the Form 5062 from any Missouri license office.\n\nTo title a homemade trailer in the state of Missouri, the owner must submit the following:"
