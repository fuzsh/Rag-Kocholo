        "text": "It’s five answers to five questions. Here we go…\n\n1. Should I tell candidates that two employees they’ll be managing are dating?\n\nAn organization I’m involved with is hiring their next executive director. There are two key long-time employees who are dating (there are fewer than 10 full-time employees total). When new people join the organization, nobody tells them that these two people are a couple, and they tend to find out in ad hoc and sometimes awkward ways.\n\nI’m involved in the process of bringing on the next executive director and wondering at what point we should tell candidates this information (finalists who interview in-person? only the last candidate? after they start?) and also how to share it. I imagine straightforward is best — e.g., “You should know these two are a couple.” And if they ask whether it’s something to be concerned about, say, “It’s common knowledge, we just wanted you to be aware.” But in fact, these two do hold some power (they can essentially veto things if they don’t want them to happen). I don’t want candidates to be taken by surprise by these dynamics once they get the job, but also want to respect people’s personal lives and work/life boundaries.\n\nWhen I started reading your question, I was thinking, “Just mention it after they’re hired; it’s not a big enough deal that it needs to be disclosed.” But then I got to the part about the power they hold as a unit — and yeah, I’d be pretty unhappy to take a job leading a small organization and only find out after I started that two key employees were in a personal relationship that allowed them to veto things they don’t like, and that no one had bothered to tell me I’d be walking into that.\n\nSo I’d raise it at the finalist stage. The message shouldn’t just be “we just wanted you to be aware they’re dating” because that’s not the most relevant part. You need to disclose what the relationship means for the dynamics in the organization, so that your finalists have a chance to ask questions about how that plays out and to consider whether they want a job where they’ll be managing that situation.\n\nDisclosing it isn’t a violation of people’s personal lives; it’s about sharing a problematic staff dynamic that the person you hire will need to navigate.\n\n2. Employee is making videos about our customers and posting them on his own social media\n\nWe have a newish salesperson who is creating his own videos/posts three times per week on his social channels about our customers/businesses. The quality is poor and his posts are not fact-checked. He graduated from college one year ago and works in B2B sales.\n\nBecause he is posting on his personal social accounts and not mentioning our company name, do we have the right to talk to him about his posts and ask him to stop creating his own videos about our customers? I’m concerned because he uses tthe customer’s actual websites in his videos. Their websites are in the background and he literally scrolls through their website during his videos, clicking on their videos and pictures, etc.\n\nIs he breaching some kind of business SOP, ethics, or no-no by creating content about our customers? I have no doubt that if our customers saw his jenky videos, they would not be happy.\n\nYes, he absolutely is breaching basic professional expectations by posting about your customers, and you need to tell him to stop!\n\nIt doesn’t matter that he’s doing it on his personal account and not mentioning your company by name. He’s an employee of your company and you’re on very solid ground in telling him he can’t comment on your customers publicly, period, and that it would be a customer relations disaster if clients find out an employee is doing that. Tell him he needs to remove the existing videos immediately and not post more. If that single warning doesn’t resolve it, that’s a firing-level offense.\n\nEven if that conversation does solve it, though, you should take a closer look at his work and judgment more broadly because this speaks to a real lack of sense.\n\nRelated:\n\nmy new employee keeps tagging us in negative social media posts after we’ve told her to stop (and then live-streamed her performance review)\n\n3. Several weeks of uncontrollable burping\n\nI have a soon-to-be embarrassing situation coming up. I have a condition called R-CPD, basically the inability to burp. Excitingly, in a few weeks, I will be having surgery to correct this. Without going into the details, I will literally have no control over my burping for at least several weeks and possibly longer. Some people’s side effects are so much that they burp every time they open their mouth or turn their head.\n\nI work in a couple of different settings, some in a quiet space where everyone will undoubtedly hear. One day a week is directly in client’s homes and I’m dreading explaining it to them (it sounds weird and fake!) or just pretending it isn’t happening. Taking so much time off, or getting accommodations to be in a different location, isn’t an option due to the nature of the work.\n\n“I need to warn you — I just had a medical procedure that’s causing a lot of uncontrollable burping for the next few weeks! Please excuse me in advance!”\n\nIf you want, you can say, “I won’t excuse myself every time or that will end up being more distracting than the burping is, so I’m going to say one blanket ‘excuse me’ now.”\n\nThat’s it! Be upbeat and matter-of-fact about. It doesn’t sound like being coy will be an option anyway, so you might as well just be open and direct about what’s going on. (It would be a lot weirder if you didn’t acknowledge it.)\n\n4. I can’t get people to attend mandatory trainings\n\nHow much handholding should be expected of professionals? I am at my wit’s end. I am in a relatively senior role that involves keeping our staff compliant with various rules. So let’s say we’re going to have a mandatory training, which will keep our company on the right side of the law (and which we do at most twice a year). A month in advance, I will send an email explaining the training and why everyone needs to attend. I will quickly follow it up with a calendar invite, which maybe half of recipients will accept immediately. I will include it in the monthly staff newsletter. I will ping everyone in Teams a few days in advance. And on the day of the training, I STILL get a handful of people saying, “Oh, I didn’t realize that was today” and “Sorry, double booked/ something came up, can’t make it.”\n\nI could complain to their managers, but it’s MY job to make sure we’re in compliance. That this is still happening in 2024 tells me it’s not about the tools or the technology for keeping track of appointments, it’s just plain disrespect. What do you think these folks need to hear in order to take it seriously?\n\nYou need to involve their managers — meaning that a week before the training, you message all the managers reminding them the training is on Date and is mandatory for their staff members, and asking them to confirm that all their team will be in attendance, and then you do that the day before too (not several days before — one day before, so it’s less likely to be forgotten in the interim). You do the same thing with individual attendees.\n\nYou will still have people flake out unless you have the ability to impose any kind of real consequence, which it sounds like you don’t (but their managers do, so you want them on your side!) but you’ll get less flaking than is happening now.\n\nBut there are no magic words that make people take this stuff seriously, unless those magic words involve consequences — like “if you miss this training, your vacation accrual will be frozen until you make it up.” I assume you don’t have that authority, so if the above doesn’t fix it, you need allies — maybe that’s your legal team, maybe it’s just someone higher up than you — who can put real teeth behind the requirement. You’d approach that by pointing out the legal risk for the company, the stats on lack of attendance, and what you’ve tried so far, and pointing out that you’re at the limits of what you can accomplish without real consequences for no-shows.\n\n5. How do I network with the people who ghosted me after an interview?\n\nI’m pursuing a job in the academic market, which is … tough, to say the least. I was recently ghosted after interviewing for a position at a university in my area. Months later, I found out through connections that while my interviewers liked me, they ended up going with another candidate.\n\nThere is another position at this university which I want even more than the position I didn’t get. In fact, I think it’s a much better match for my skills and goals than the last one was! However, I’m not sure how to network and communicate with the people who ghosted me. I was recently at an event where one of my interviewers was in attendance and they seemed decidedly nervous every time they saw me, like they clearly wanted to avoid talking to me.\n\nAlthough I’m not happy about being ghosted, I am capable of getting over it for the sake of pursuing this other position. However, I’m concerned that my past interviewers’ own nerves over dealing with someone they ghosted may impact me negatively. Do you have any advice on how I can navigate this situation graciously?\n\nAny nervousness at seeing you probably wasn’t about the ghosting; it’s more likely to have been about interviewing but not hiring you. People who ghost candidates often don’t even realize they ghosted them; they think someone else sent rejections, or it just fell off their radar, etc.\n\nThat said, people who hire normally don’t feel that much awkwardness about running into rejected candidates unless there’s something else going on, like they made you promises they later reneged on, etc. Any chance some of this might have been you projecting the awkwardness you feel about the ghosting on to them? Or maybe these people are particularly odd, but either way they’re probably not horribly consumed with guilt about the ghosting.\n\nWhen you apply for the new job, send them a note saying you really enjoyed talking with them earlier this year, were glad to see the X position open up, have thrown your hat in the ring for it, and hope to get the opportunity to talk with them about it. Be cheerful and upbeat. All of that will demonstrate that you aren’t feeling weirdly about what happened and that there’s no need for them to feel they need to tiptoe around you.\n\nLast week we talked about animals at work and here are 10 of my favorite stories you shared.\n\n1. The unauthorized dog\n\nI’ve worked my entire career at tech start-ups, which are invariably filled with multiple office dogs. Beyond stories of those dogs peeing under desks, pooping in conference rooms, and even one lone kitten who crawled through a hole into the wall and had to be lured out with some turkey, the wildest story was the day a dog arrived who didn’t belong.\n\nWe noticed the new dog running through the office, but just thought it belonged to an employee. The dog got wilder and wilder, jumping on and barking at people, and soon the work chat escalated from “Whose dog is this?” to “Will the owner please come get your dog already!!!”\n\nThe receptionist checked that morning’s front door footage to see who arrived with that dog and to our shock, we realized it had arrived alone. It had snuck in after an oblivious coworker, which was impressive because we were many floors up in an elevator building (we would later learn the dog had ridden an elevator with a different coworker who also didn’t say anything because he “thought the dog knew where it was going”).\n\nI ended up catching the dog after it muscled its way into a conference room which unfortunately was hosting an important call with an external party. The dog was later reunited with its owner who worked on a different floor.\n\n2. The ducks\n\nOne year, a duck nested in a bush next to the employee entrance of my office. There were signs on the door warning everyone to leave her alone, but she – and her babies, once they hatched – were so quiet, you’d never have known they were there if not for the signs. Then one morning around 8:30, it was time for them to leave and head to a nearby pond. Mama duck and her babies marched across the parking lot while three employees blocked all the traffic and everyone else lined up at the office windows to watch the babies. The head of HR later sent out an email to the whole office announcing the departure of the ducks for anyone who’d missed it. He made sure to include photos of the babies and a shoutout to the people who’d blocked traffic for them.\n\n3. The known individual\n\nA few years ago a cougar wandered down from the mountains and made it across about two miles of suburbia to end up in a wildlife preserve next to our campus. This obviously concerned people who walked around the area, and even though the cougar left, for a while people were on edge about anything that looked like a big cat. One “cougar sighting” turned out to be an old bobcat that lived in the preserve, which led to a police press release saying that he was “an individual known to police and not dangerous,” as if he were a drunk they’d had to rouse out of the gutter or something.\n\n4. The peacock\n\nA friend of mine worked front of house at a huge winery that hosted concerts and events throughout the year, including a classic car show. This winery also has resident peacocks that freely roam the grounds. At this particular car show, a peacock wandered by a car that had loads of shiny chrome all over it. The bird saw his own reflection in the bumper and immediately went into attack mode, trying like hell to get at that other damn peacock — and like most male birds, he had beak and claws going for him and caused several thousands of dollars worth of damage to the paint job and the shiny metal bits of the car.\n\n5. The iguana\n\nI once stopped at a vendor stall at our local farmers market. The money was handled by what looked to be maybe an 11-12 year old girl, and the cash box was guarded by a large iguana parked on top. When she needed to make change, she’d remove the iguana, make the change, and then put it back. Makes sense to me – I’m not messing with an iguana.\n\n6. The geese vs. the CEO\n\nWe had a pair of Canadian geese nesting in the landscaping right up against our building. Canadian geese aren’t known for their social skills at the best of times, but when they’re nesting it becomes Jurassic Park but with honking and feathers. They chased everyone who came in the front entrance, which happened to be closest to their nest. We had signs for people to go around to the side entrance so they didn’t get a goose bite, which was likely because Papa Goose would stand guard right on the steps, hissing and honking at you.\n\nOur CEO was annoyed that grounds wouldn’t get rid of the geese and went to great lengths to try to get them to leave on their own including installing fake owls around the top of the building himself to scare them off; he went up on the roof in a suit. It was awesome. He tried clapping at them, chasing them with a broom. They chased him right back and cornered him at his car. After a lot of swearing and hissing, he got into his car and left. The geese were allowed to stay.\n\n7. The seals\n\nI work at a marina. We have guest moorage, which is basically a campground for boats. We built a new breakwater dock, which is attached to land at one side, so there’s only one way on or off. There’s a small floating office moored about halfway down.\n\nWe didn’t anticipate that the seals would love this dock so much. We were in the middle of pupping season and there are extremely strict laws regarding approaching or interacting with seals, and even stricter ones about their pups. Well, our employee was out working in the office and a seal decided to give birth on the dock right outside the door. She was trapped in the office both because she didn’t want to break the law and she also didn’t want to get bit (those things get big!). She finally had to call our maintenance department and have them bring the little boat over so she could climb out the office window onto the boat so she could go home.\n\n8. The cat\n\nI had an internship at a CPA firm about three hours from where my husband and I were based, so my husband stayed in our apartment and I rented a room near the firm. During my second week there, my young and otherwise healthy cat needed emergency surgery and sadly didn’t survive. This was my first experience with pet loss and let me tell you I was A MESS. When it all went down I needed to rush home in the middle of a work day and not come back for several days, and then I cried in the office several times. Everyone was understanding but I was so worried I was giving them the wrong impression.\n\nThe rest of my five-month-long internship went smoothly. My very last client had an office cat who was there to be a mouser. This cat spent every day snuggled up next to my laptop and I loved him. Right before the engagement ended, I got wind that they were about the take the cat back to the shelter because they’d realized he should live in a home but were unable to find one for him. I think you know that I took the cat.\n\nAt the end of my internship they offered me a full-time position. The partner said I’d done a great job and added, “You made the firm look really good by adopting that cat.” Nine years later I’m no longer with that firm but I still have the cat. His name is Siren.\n\n9. The goat\n\nAn adult goat joined us once for entire day. We worked in a professional environment (read: not business-casual, just business), with a humorless director and a lot of phone calls from the public. The goat’s human dad lived a long commute from the office, needed to take the goat to the vet for a checkup after work, and thought it quite reasonable for us to have an “intern” for the day. Given his title, none of us felt empowered to resist.\n\nSome of us loved it (“A goat! Fun!”), some of us hated it (“#$@# GOAT!”), and one woman was terrified because as a child, she was taught horizontal pupils were a sign of evil and she wanted him nowhere near her cube. Goat Dad had a busy day of offsite meetings, so we all tried to keep an eye on our new coworker. It was tough – he laughed at our barricades, tipped over lamps, let out extremely loud bleats (but only when he noticed someone was on the phone), and thought he ascended to heaven when he discovered our staff kitchen. No salad was safe, and he discovered a previously unknown love of Pop-Tarts.\n\nWhen our director unexpectedly stopped by in the afternoon, we knew the goat was cooked (metaphorically). We not only had to keep him out of sight, but completely silent. Goat Dad had said we could lull him nearly to sleep if we stroked his chin. For the last three hours of the day, we snuck the goat from cube to cube to cube, depending on our director’s movements, and all the goat-sitters had to give up one hand for chin-stroking. Only one bleat was heard, and a quick-thinking coworker popped his head up above his cube and said, “YouTube! Sorry!”\n\nOf course, no good deed goes unpunished, and Goat Dad grumbled the next day that his pet’s farts were unbearable in the car ride home, which definitely were not caused by the broccoli our our receptionist picked out of her salad.\n\n10. The Dean\n\nI was six. The school I went to had no air conditioners and was intolerable when it was above body temperature, so school was canceled for a “hot day.” My mother worked at a very fancy job (a professor) and she had air conditioning. She had to go work and brought me. I got to be all grown up and be mum’s little helper and run messages/errands around my mum’s floor while my mother was frantic with end-of-school-year things.\n\nMy most important quest yet — I’m supposed to get a signature from her boss. I thought his name was Dean, and he was so important, he was “The Dean” (I’d never met any Dean). So I go into The Dean’s office, and there is a pug sitting on the chair behind the desk. I knew that dogs could work and had important jobs, ceremonial and otherwise. I thought that only working dogs were allowed at work. I am so pissed that my mother never told me her boss was a dog, but she’s really busy right now.\n\nI try for a minute to very respectfully ask for a signature on paper from this dog, who just sits and yawns. Luckily, I had just helped out at a wedding recently, and with everyone who was too young to write their name, they put their finger or foot on an ink stamp to sign the guest book. I knew how to help with that. So I found an ink pad, and lo and behold the dog had one black paw and three pink paws — so the black one went into the ink, and onto the lines, and the document is signed. It goes into the pile, I remember to wipe the paw down, and I move on to the next thing.\n\nMaybe a month later, my mother and I are at a barbecue with “Chris Potter,” a family friend, who has brought his dog (and I recognize Chris Potter’s dog is The Dean!). I joyfully explain to my cousins (some older than me) that this dog is my mum’s boss. Chris Potter relates a story to the adults about how some poor student’s important paperwork (post-doc appointment form) had been walked over by a dog so his signature wasn’t visible, and he had been called by the money people (grant holder’s department accountant) over normally un-interruptable three-week summer vacation, to confirm that he did approve of important mum-work things (research funding allocation).\n\nOne of my cousins was annoyed I was lying about my mum’s boss being a dog and went to tell on me to the adults. My mum asked why I thought that, and all the adults started laughing. I was gently told that the dean is a title (more important than Dr!), and the dog was not the dean. Julie, the dog, did get a wonderful embroidered collar that Christmas that said “the boss” on it, and the next time I visited for a heat day, everyone with a pet in their office had put a sign up warning of their existence. This was the best since with a bit of work, I got to pet every dog.\n\nA reader writes:\n\nI started at a new company a few months ago and, in getting acquainted with other staff, several people mentioned that they find one of my reports, Linda, a little abrasive. Basically, there was a lot of coded talk that she can be difficult/rude. Since we have started working together, I do find that sometimes she phrases things in a way that I never would to a supervisor, but overall I think we work together very well and some other staff members have actually mentioned to me that Linda seems happier at work.\n\nIn the past two weeks, I received two complaints about Linda’s tone, and I also received an email her from her that felt overly aggressive considering the circumstances. I would like to discuss the issue with her in our next 1:1, but in preparation for that discussion I checked in with her two former supervisors, who are now the highest level staff at our company, and even though both of them have spoken to me quite a bit about “how Linda can be,” I learned she has never received feedback during her 15+ years here about this seemingly well-acknowledged issue among other staff.\n\nThe problem that I am having in considering how to phrase it is that both complaints about her tone have come from people who were ALSO rude to her and apparently that has not been discussed with them, either. One of those people is our HR director. Both complaints were sent to me via email, with the chains in question forwarded to me, and I feel that the other people were rude to Linda first, and she basically responded in-kind. Is that what I would have done? No, but if I had received similar emails outside of a work setting, I probably would have taken a similar tone to Linda’s. I did let the other supervisor know that I thought her report was also rude in the interaction, but I have no idea what came of that.\n\nEveryone involved with this issue has been here at least as long as Linda. I want to do better than her previous supervisors, but this feels like a difficult message to present. I have already spoken with the CEO about other issues regarding the HR director, and to be honest he seems afraid of her, so I can’t exactly promise she will start being more cordial. I am wondering if I should ignore the other complaints for now and just focus on the email she sent me, but that doesn’t seem totally right either since I was clearly asked to speak to her about it by both the HR director and other supervisor.\n\nThe framing you want is: “You can’t talk to colleagues this way regardless of the provocation.”\n\nBut it’s essential to pair that with, “It’s not acceptable for anyone to talk to you this way, either. If that’s happening, please loop me in so I can address it. But the solution can’t be that you snap back at them.”\n\nIt sounds like you should also talk with Linda about the reputation she’s developed for being difficult and rude. No one has done her any favors in hiding from her! But here, too, it’s essential to pair it with an acknowledgement that, from what you’ve seen, others are part of the problem. And again, the message should be, “I don’t want our team speaking to people this way even if we’re provoked.”\n\nFirst, though, make sure that Linda isn’t being held to different standards than others. “Abrasive” in particular is often leveled against women when men saying the exact same things don’t get characterized that way, and Black people can get characterized as “angry” when others saying the same things don’t. It sounds like you’ve seen plenty of evidence that Linda genuinely is off-base in a lot of her communications, and I’m going to assume for the rest of my answer that that’s the case — but keep an eye out for a more problematic dynamic and address it head-on if you do see it.\n\nAssuming that the issues are legitimate ones, though, the fact that you’re coming in as a new player might make you better-positioned to address them. If you’d managed her for years and ignored the way she spoke to people that whole time, it would be harder to address it now. (You’d still need to! But it would be harder and she’d have the right to be irritated that you waited years to speak up.) As a new person without the history her previous managers apparently have with her, you might find it easier to say, “Hey, we can’t talk to people like this” — and also “I don’t want them talking to you this way either.” Plus, the fact that Linda seems to mesh better with you than with previous managers is likely to help; you sound like you might have built up some credibility and good will with her.\n\nI’m glad you point out to that other manager that her employee had been rude in her dealings with Linda. Keep doing that. It’s possible that people have fallen into bad habits with Linda over the years — if she has a history of being difficult, they might start off interactions with her already on the defensive — but just as it’s not okay for Linda to respond to provocation rudely, it’s not okay for people to do it to her either. And for you to maintain credibility with Linda, she needs to see that you’re not holding her to a different standard than other people are held to, and that you’ll go to bat for her when she has a legitimate beef with how someone speaks to her.\n\nIt’s five answers to five questions. Here we go…\n\n1. Can my husband hang out in my office at night until I’m ready to leave?\n\nI am a woman in my early thirties. If I am going to stay late at night at work, would it be possible to bring my husband to stay somewhere in the office until I finish my work? Is it an unusual request to make?\n\nIt will vary by office. Some offices would be fine with it. Others have security policies that could make it tricky.\n\nAre you wondering about it for safety reasons or something else (like, I don’t know, you carpool to work and your husband needs to wait somewhere until you’re done so you can drive home together)?\n\nIf it’s safety reasons, I’d raise that with your manager directly; if you need to stay late at work, you need to feel safe doing that and your employer should work with you to make that possible.\n\nIf it’s more “my husband is bored and needs somewhere to hang out until I can leave,” it would be better for him to find somewhere else to do that until you’re done (especially if it would be a regular thing).\n\n2. How do I get my coworkers to treat me like “the talent”?\n\nI work in an industry where there’s crew (the production peeps) and talent (people in front of camera or behind the mic). I’ve been crew for maybe 10 years now. But I’ve pitched a project of my own and will be behind the mic for it. Exciting!\n\nUsually, the production peeps take a lot of care briefing the talent — what happens when, who’s handling what, next steps, etc., etc. But because I’ve been on the team and am part of the company and someone from outside, they are skipping all these steps with me.\n\nClassic slippery slope. Initially, I didn’t mind, because we were still in my area of preproduction expertise. No need to brief. Now we are reaching post and I feel totally lost and worried about who’s handling what and is somebody handling it at all or must I be sorting it out, etc. It feels dramatic to now hit them with an email saying KEEP ME ABREAST AT ALL TIMES. And how do I transition from being a mellow fellow coworker to a fussy client with lots of pointers about editing and marketing and such? (I don’t go overboard with fussiness, I swear.)\n\n“Hey, I know I didn’t initially need everything talent normally needs, but now we’re at a point where I do need the same level of support we give to people without experience in production. I’m realizing I feel lost about things like XYZ, so going forward, can you give me the same level of briefing you’d give anyone else, even if you think I won’t need it?”\n\nAs for moving from a mellow coworker to a fussy client with lots of notes … there’s just some inherent awkwardness in there that you probably can’t entirely avoid, but if you just jump in and do it, it’ll feel more natural in time. That said, your knowledge from being on the other side can inform your approach — be as detail-oriented as you want, but be kind about it. Think of it as taking the work very seriously, rather than taking yourself seriously; that usually helps with humility. (At the same time, I bet seeing the process from the talent side is going to make some things talent does that were annoying when you were crew seem less annoying now. That always happens when you do this kind of flip, and that perspective-broadening can be useful if you return to the crew side at some point.)\n\n3. What feedback should I give to a temporary worker who didn’t get the job?\n\nI became a first-time manager within the past year, so this is all new to me. My first act was to make a temporary hire for my old role until our organization could fill it full-time. I hired someone I knew from a similar org who had recently been let go for budget reasons. I am completely confident she knew it was a temporary position. Within a year, I got the greenlight to hire full-time. She applied and was a finalist out of a pool of several hundred applicants. But she lost out to someone with extensive specific past experience that made them a unicorn-level fit for the job.\n\nI told her that she did not get the job, and that it honestly wasn’t anything she did wrong; we just had a candidate we couldn’t pass up. She has been professional about it but is taking it hard.\n\nThis surprised me. Even during interviews, she did not seem very excited, but rather like applying was the expected thing to do. Even so, it was a close decision because she is very good. I have honestly told her I will be a glowing reference for her. I told her, if she wants, she can stay through end of the month. (She doesn’t know this yet but I’m also trying to get the budget to give her some cover for the next month.) We also lined up some short projects that I hope she can use as examples in future interviews. I genuinely want her to do well in a job she cares about.\n\nIn our last check-in, she started crying and asked for more specific feedback. Like anyone, she isn’t perfect and I have a couple of things I could suggest. But none are why we didn’t hire her. Do I give her honest feedback? Does that include telling her she didn’t seem to want to be here? Or does that rub salt in the wound? As a newbie manager, I try to start with empathy, but I clearly misread her enthusiasm and am doubting my instincts now.\n\nGive her feedback because she’s asking for it, but frame it as, “I can give you some feedback on things that will strengthen your work generally, but I want to be clear that they weren’t the reasons you weren’t hired. You were a very competitive candidate and the decision was about hiring someone who was an unusually good match; it wasn’t based on any concerns about you or your work.”\n\nI would not tell her she didn’t seem enthusiastic unless she seemed so disengaged that you’re concerned it will be an obstacle for her in future interviews. But it’s useful data that people don’t always wear their hearts on their sleeves in interviews and can be much more invested than you can see on the surface. (Not always! Some people genuinely aren’t that enthused. But it’s good to be aware that there’s a wide spectrum of “normal” on this.)\n\nRelated:\n\nhow to show passion for your work when you’re not a demonstrative person\n\n4. Can I ask for my own office?\n\nI work for a large nonprofit that is mostly remote, but has an office from the days when folks were expected to come in. The building sits mostly empty. On my floor, for example, there are about 20 cubicles and 15 enclosed offices. There are maybe five of us that come in at some point during the week, and of those, only two of us are in every day. Of course, all five of us are in the same cube area, and the two of us in every day sit right next to each other. This leaves over 15 offices empty and unassigned.\n\nThis is frustrating! All of my meetings are on video calls, so I spend a lot of time going in and out of enclosed offices. My colleagues often take their videos and calls in the open area, which results in unnecessary sensory overload and frustration for me. (If it matters, I likely have sensory processing disorder from some combination of anxiety/ADHD/etc.)\n\nI’ve only been here a month, and I’m the lowest role in our structure. Still, with so many offices sitting open, I would love to move into one. Would it be okay to request? How should I approach it?\n\n“I’m spending a lot of time going in and out of the enclosed offices since I have so many video calls. Since it seems like a lot are unused, would it be okay for me to regularly work out of one of them?” They might say no — a lot of offices have intense politics around who gets an office and who doesn’t, even the people they’re assigned to are never there to use them — but it’s reasonable to ask. (Those politics are why my suggested wording is “regularly work out of one of them,” which sounds less permanent than “can I have my own office?” even if that’s what it turns into in time.)\n\nIf the answer is no, you could ask about moving to a cubicle that’s further away from the current cluster so that you’re not in the middle of so much action.\n\nAlso, depending on how much the sensory overload is interfering with your work, you could also consider going the formal accommodations route — but in a lot of cases it makes sense to start with a less formal conversation first.\n\n5. Should I tell my over-performing employee to leave?\n\nI have a superstar employee. She was fairly fresh out of university when we hired her, but I have never had a regret about her performance. She’s now been working for us for almost two years and doing more work than I would expect someone at her level to perform, it’s at an exceptional quality, and she consistently takes on bigger and newer challenges.\n\nObviously, I’ve been advocating for her to get a promotion. Recently, HR told us that for her to get that promotion, she’d have to have had three years of experience in her current (or any equivalent) role. But she’s performing at a higher level than what her title indicates! She deserves the promotion. She did get a decent raise, which I am happy about, but I know from experience that the title can make a big difference as well. Honestly she could leave and do so much better for herself. I’ve made the case again for her and hope that HR will change their mind (or find some combined level of experience that will help her qualify for it), but what else can I do?\n\nDo I tell her that she should start looking elsewhere because she deserves a role that recognizes and pays her what she is worth? This is the first I’ve heard of the title structure that bases things off of years of experience, but I assume I should just lay it out for her so that she knows what the logic is? Do I have to make it sound like I agree with this because I am her manager?\n\nIt’s not terribly unusual to have experience requirements for promotion. It’s also reasonable for you, as her manager, to argue for an exception to that policy, based on her extraordinary level of performance and the possibility that the company may lose her entirely if you don’t reward that performance sooner rather than later.\n\nThat said, what’s your employee’s take on all this? Is she happy to wait another year for promotion or is she pushing for it to happen sooner? If she hasn’t shown any unhappiness with the situation, there’s no reason to encourage her to start looking outside the company. If you had the sense that they’d never promote her, that would be different — and you’d owe it to her to be relatively candid about that — but that’s not the case here. You should still share with her what the promotion timeline is so she has it, and you should lay out for HR why you think her accomplishments in two years are the equivalent of the average candidate’s accomplishments in three (or longer), but the three-year timeline isn’t inherently outrageous (as long as it’s real and they don’t kick the can down the road once people get there, and also as long as it’s not at odds with the norms of your field).\n\nIt’s five answers to five questions. Here we go…\n\n1. My employer wants us to “volunteer” for groundskeeping and cleaning\n\nI work in a faculty position at a private university that is struggling with all the challenges that higher education is facing right now, including declining enrollment. We have not had raises in years, and positions are only replaced if they are determined to be absolutely necessary. Even though housekeeping and groundskeeping are deemed necessary, they are having trouble filling those positions because they either can’t or won’t pay a competitive wage for the area.\n\nRecently the administration sent out an email asking all employees to participate in a voluntary workday to make the campus beautiful before students arrive. Staff who would be working that day can count it toward time worked, but faculty, who would typically not be working that day, are expected to do it with no additional compensation. Tasks include power washing buildings, planting flowers and laying mulch, and cleaning. I had planned to use that day to prepare for my fall semester classes. Part of the reason they are asking for help is because they don’t have an adequate number of groundskeeping and housekeeping staff, although the email didn’t say that. I do not think it is my responsibility to do tasks outside of what I was hired to do because the university failed to hire people to do them.\n\nI’m planning to not sign up for a time slot, but do you think this is something that we should push back on? Also, do you think that those who don’t participate could face backlash for failing to be a team player?\n\nYes, it’s something you should push back on. It’s bad enough that you’re being asked to pick up extra work from unfilled jobs similar to your own (for no additional compensation), but now you’re supposed to “volunteer” for manual labor that has nothing to do with your job at all? No. If they want to cut positions, they need to deal with the consequences of cutting those positions — not add power washing and cleaning onto your already full plates so that you’re the ones shouldering those consequences.\n\nWill you face backlash for “not being a team player”? Maybe! But the more of you who decline to sign up, the less feasible that will be — so encourage your colleagues to sit this out.\n\n2. People ask if my hair color is natural\n\nI’m a woman in my late thirties and I work for a company of approximately 600 people. My role has me connecting with people across many departments. I have found my hair to be a frequent topic of conversation at work and I’m looking for a script to politely shut people down.\n\nMy hair was dark blond most of my life, but I started going gray early. I think gray hair looks lovely on many people, but it made me look washed out and ill so I had fun trying out lots of different hair colors. For the last five-ish years, I’ve dyed my hair red (Cowboy Copper, to be precise). It’s bright, but not outside the realm of natural hair colors.\n\nMy problem is that I get asked approximately once a week if my hair color is natural. I think it’s rude and would never ask someone whether they dye their hair. I’ve tried different answers — a joke, the truth, lying and saying it’s natural, and they always respond with compliments, but every exchange leaves me uncomfortable. I don’t think the people asking mean to be rude (they all legitimately seem to like the color) but I never know how to respond. How do I politely shut these people down?\n\nYes, it’s rude. Welcome to life as a redhead! People constantly ask redheads if our hair is real. A friend’s mom once poked around in my hair looking for roots because she didn’t believe it was real. I’m pretty sure adults asked me if it was real when I was a child.\n\nThat said, most people who ask are just interested because it’s unusual. You certainly don’t need to tell them it’s dyed if you don’t want to, but it’s also not a shameful secret and you could simply respond, “No, I just like it.” But if you don’t want to answer on principle, some options for you:\n\n* “Why do you ask?”\n\n* “I don’t think you’re supposed to ask people that.”\n\n* “That’s between me and my hairdresser.”\n\nStill, “No, I just like it” is likely to make it less of a big deal.\n\n3. I was snubbed by a mentee I’ve given countless hours of my time to\n\nI am a seasoned professional in a niche spot in my field. Early on in my career, I spent some time talking to my alma mater classes about my niche area of work, and took to mentoring a student who was interested in my field.\n\nI have spent hours over nearly a decade giving advice to this person, editing his resume, and providing extraordinary amounts of input for which positions would be a good fit.\n\nRecently I had a question for this mentee. He had accepted a job at an agency I cross paths with very infrequently, and I thought he could provide me very general information on a topic. Instead, he immediately discussed billing my agency for work over 30 minutes, and even mentioned an unwarranted inspection of my facility. I was floored. I told him to forget about it, reached out to a consultant, and worked out the question on my own.\n\nI do not plan to give my time to this person ever again. Should I tell him how disrespectful he was, and why I plan to separate myself from his future advice needs? He contacts me only when he needs career advice. He has stolen countless hours from me and gave nothing as a show of thanks.\n\nNah, there’s no point. You’re right to be unavailable to him in the future now that he’s shown his interest in the relationship is so one-sided, but there’s little to be gained by spelling it out for him. (And really, you’ve already invested a ton of time in coaching him! You don’t need to do this final bit of it on your way out the door.)\n\nFor what it’s worth, though, I don’t think it’s useful to look at this as him stealing your time. You presumably mentored him voluntarily. And sure, you assumed the relationship would be a two-way one, but he didn’t engage with you under false pretenses. He’s just selfish and apparently sucks at networking. Now you know!\n\n4. How do I reject a qualified former coworker?\n\nI am the senior director for a small firm. We are in the process of hiring a new lead engineer in a very niche field where the applicant pool is tiny in our region. We recently received an outstanding resume from somebody with 30+ years of experience, a master’s in our field, and a ton of awesome project work that lines up with exactly what we need. Great news; our months’ long search is over! Only one catch: this person used to be my boss, left on overall good terms with our organization, but also left a bad taste in the mouths of a number of current team members. He resigned 10 years ago to take a high level director position at a neighboring company.\n\nThe word is that he left his director role in an acrimonious fashion last year (forced resignation). He is currently at another company as a chief engineer, which is two steps below director but two steps above our position. Our location would save him almost an hour commuting each day and I am guessing that is at least part of why he wants to come back. But beyond the personnel issues if he were to return (people are already freaking out about the possibility), the position he applied for requires a lot of desk time and actual crunching numbers type of engineering work, with no supervisory requirements. My experience with him as my boss was that he was a super delegator — to the point of asking senior engineers to draft emails on his behalf to send to vendors, prepare his presentations for conferences, do the annual cap ex budget for him (!), etc.\n\nWe have a handful of junior engineers and my gut is telling me he will pass his work on to them even though they don’t report to the senior engineer. He also has 15 years more experience than the manager he would report to — they have very different management styles and I believe he would question/go around him constantly. HR is trying to do everything by the book and although I have relayed all of this to them, they are insisting, based on his qualifications, that we have to offer him an interview. He will ace the interview and I am sure he will outshine the other candidates we have (he’s a very good politician and is very sharp). Is there anything else I can do to convince HR to not bring him in for the interview? Or if we must interview him, how can we justifiably turn him down? I also want to maintain a professional relationship with him, as we still occasionally cross paths at industry events.\n\nFirst of all, what exactly does “the senior director” mean here? If you’re in charge of the firm, HR should be working to support you, not laying down edicts that they can’t defend. Yes, they’re charged with ensuring the company complies with the law and minimizes risk, but there’s no legal requirement that you interview everyone who’s qualified on paper. If you’ve worked with the candidate in the past and know they’re wrong for the role based on that experience, you do not need to interview out of a sense of fairness. So first, push back on HR and ask them to explain exactly why they think you should ignore firsthand experience working closely with a candidate.\n\nSecond, are you in charge of hiring for this position? If so, and you’re pushed into interviewing him, you can name your concern pretty explicitly in the interview: “This is an individual contributor position that doesn’t manage anyone, and about 80% of your time will be spent doing XYZ personally, not supervising others in doing it. I know that’s different than the role you had when we worked together, so I hoped you would speak to your interest in making that kind of move and what appeals to you about it.” Who knows, maybe you’ll hear something that changes your mind. But assuming you don’t, you can simply decline to hire him based on your experience working together in the past and your knowledge of the needs of the role. And if you’re not the decision-maker, you should share your experience and concerns very candidly with whoever is.\n\n5. Can you take back your resignation?\n\nThis is a hypothetical, but it’s made me curious: Is there any way to pull back a resignation within the notice period? I had a wild dream where I quit a job I liked a lot for a reason I regretted, and found myself having to try to un-quit. I didn’t actually do this, but now I can’t stop thinking about it! Is there a script for changing your mind gracefully?\n\nSure, you can always try. If they valued you and haven’t already hired someone else, they might leap at the chance to keep you — although on the manager side of that, I’d want to make sure I understood what led you to quit in the first place and why you’d changed your mind, and I’d want to feel confident that whatever led to your quitting wasn’t going to put us in the same spot a few months down the road. And of course, if they weren’t terribly sad about you leaving, you might hear, “We appreciate the offer, but we’ve already planned for the transition and are pretty far into hiring for your replacement.”\n\nAs for how to say it, you need to explain why you’ve changed your mind. For example: “I’ve been thinking a lot about this, and I’d be interested in staying if it’s not too late to change course. I’d been concerned that my job was moving to more of an X focus, but you were so responsive when we talked about it and I can see that with Jane joining our team, those projects won’t fall as heavily to my role for much longer. If you’re open to me staying, I’m looking at a lot of this differently now.” (But that’s a reason that makes sense! If it’s just “oops, I acted too hastily / in the heat of the moment,” you still might be able to reverse it, but you should expect a fair amount of concern about what happened and whether you can really be happy there or not.)\n\nRelated:\n\nemployee resigned but now wants to stay\n\nA reader writes:\n\nI recently took a couple of weeks off work because of a work-stress-related mental breakdown, and came back today. Our project is a nightmare — toxic culture, inexperienced leadership, over-budget, understaffed.\n\nBrian, our project manager and my grandboss, is responsible for a lot of the problems. He also can’t manage the members of our team who underperform (he has no clue what everyone below him does all day) or the ones who fly off the handle (yelling, slamming doors, walking out of meetings). I’m not the only one who’s one bad day away from resigning on the spot. It’s the perfect storm, and I was on a slow spiral for months until I snapped.\n\nBrian pulled me aside today to “make sure you’re doing okay.” I answered that I was on the mend, and am keeping an eye on my mental health and implementing some strategies I’m working out with my psychologist. For example, taking regular breaks, and working 7am-5pm only (standard hours in my industry). I’d already had a meeting with my line manager, Sarah, to sort out workload priorities to make sure the critical work got done. Sarah is really happy with my performance, and she supports my recovery and boundaries.\n\nBrian was shocked and insisted that I work overtime (unpaid — I’m exempt). He believes he’s been generous by “letting” the team to leave by 5:15pm and hadn’t mandated Saturdays (an old school industry norm, but definitely not the norm now), so I should “put in the hours” now. He insisted that I wasn’t performing and if I don’t work through to the evening, I risk pushing his project deeper into distress. He’s expecting everyone to “step up because the company and client will expect it” and “nobody is bigger than the project.” This is wildly out of step with our company culture/values.\n\nI flatly told Brian that I’m not planning on slacking off, but I’m planning on managing my health. Working more hours won’t solve the project’s problems, and I’d just had a breakdown because of overwork and chaotic management. If he wants me to sacrifice my health, I’ll quit. I asked him to speak to Sarah if there are any issues with this. He did this afternoon, and Sarah was supportive of everything we’d agreed to and told him he was being ridiculous and to butt out.\n\nI don’t know where to go from here. I’m expecting Brian to retaliate somehow. Sarah, my actual boss, is happy with my performance and doesn’t want me sticking around late for the sake of it — she wants me healthy so I can do my job. I have a mentor within the company, but he’s national head of our department (my great-great grandboss), and he’s already on Brian’s case about his performance and the project culture, so I feel like that’s breaking chain of command to ask him for advice. I’m hesitant to get HR involved.\n\nThe job market is hot for this industry and I could find another job tomorrow, but I really want to stick it out because I’ve worked hard on this project and want to see it out. I just think Brian’s being completely unreasonable, and while I’m happy to quit I want to try something else first.\n\nIf you’re confident that you could find another job tomorrow, you have a lot of power here. Knowing you could easily get another job means you don’t need to feel pressure to compromise on your health or the hours you’re willing to work.\n\nI don’t know that there’s anything you need to do right now. It sounds like Sarah has your back and made it clear to Brian that she’s happy with your work and he needs to leave you alone.\n\nOf course, Brian is Sarah’s boss, so I don’t know if he’ll actually accept that or not. But you probably have a good idea of how much capital and influence Sarah has, what her dynamic is with Brian, and how willing or unwilling he is to overrule her — and those things are likely to play a role in what, if anything, happens next.\n\nAt this point, it likely makes sense to just wait and see. If Brian backs off, great. If he doesn’t, you’re willing to walk. Also great.\n\nA few things I might disagree with from your letter: First, it’s not necessarily a bad idea to have a discreet conversation with your mentor. You said you’re worried about breaking chain of command, but (a) this is your mentor, so that’s less of a concern than it would be if you never talked to each other, and (b) since he already has significant concerns about Brian, he’d probably be pretty interested in hearing that Brian is actively in the process of messing up something additional. Second, it might also be wise to loop HR in — not in the “I’m here to complain about Brian” sense, but as a way to ensure the steps you’re taking to manage your health are documented (and possibly officially sanctioned, which could make it harder for Brian to give you a hard time about it).\n\nLast, this part: “I really want to stick it out because I’ve worked hard on this project and want to see it out.” That’s understandable, and it’s a normal thing to feel if you’re conscientious and invested in your work. But you also just had a breakdown related to work stress, and you describe the culture you’re returning to as a toxic mess, and one where you’re worried about retaliation for protecting yourself. Your mental health is more important than seeing out a project. Don’t get so focused on “must stay” that you miss signs that you’d be better off leaving."
