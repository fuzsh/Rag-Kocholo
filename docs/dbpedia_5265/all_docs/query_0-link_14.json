        "text": "Paul begins his letter to the Romans by stating that he is a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God. He also adds \"by the will of God\" in most of his other letters to affirm the purpose of his calling to preach the gospel to Jews and Gentiles, something Paul never doubted. So sure was he of his calling and purpose that he gave up his freedom and eventually his life to pursue and fulfill it.\n\nAt least for me, the beginning of a new year feels like renewal. It's like I've been given another opportunity to start over. As I've reflected on this new opportunity, purpose, and what I've been called to pursue, it brought me to the question: Am I living out this calling? Am I fulfilling God's purpose for my life?\n\nThe apostle Paul's conversion and calling were dramatic. Having Jesus physically appear to you and call you into a new mission would be unforgettable and very convincing. But we need to remember that this wasn't a pleasant encounter for Paul. Being confronted by the Son of God for persecuting his followers left him without his vision and unable to eat or drink for three days. I am glad not to have been called in such a dramatic fashion, but regardless, I am called, as are you, if you received Jesus as your Lord and Savior.\n\nWhat is your calling and purpose?\n\nDepending on who you listen to, the percentage of Christians who say they know their purpose is between eleven and forty percent. I'm not sure how accurate that is; what I know is that I had many conversations over my years as a pastor with individuals who struggled to know their calling and life purpose. The reason for this confusion may very well be due to a lack of understanding of what each of these means. First, let's define the difference between calling and purpose because they are not the same thing. Purpose has to do with the reason something exists or was created. God created you, and the reason you exist is to glorify Him. Everyone's purpose is the same: to glorify God.\n\n\"For everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. All glory to him forever! Amen.\" (Romans 11:36 NLT)\n\nCalling is God's invitation to you to participate in a specific way to bring him glory. This is a stewardship opportunity that all of us are entrusted with. It will involve different roles and responsibilities, which may change in various seasons of your life. One thing is sure: every person whom God creates is called.\n\n\"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.\" (Jeremiah 1:5 NIV)\n\nYou may be a manager in one season and a missionary in the next. Regardless of what you do and your roles and responsibilities, your purpose is always to glorify God. Each of these opportunities are God-given callings to fulfill that purpose.\n\n\"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.\" (1 Corinthians 10:31)\n\nWe will face opposition as we carry out our calling.\n\nDo you remember why Satan sinned? Ezekiel 28 reveals that Satan's downfall came because of his pride. God had anointed Satan as a guardian cherub, the \"inner circle\" of angels, who had the closest access to God and guarded his holiness. He is described as the model of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty, and that beauty caused him to seek worship for himself and to rebel against God.\n\nSatan opposes God and everything he's created and tries to obstruct God's plan. After his fall, Satan succeeded in getting Eve and then Adam to join his rebellion, and he's been trying to do the same to every person since. The Bible tells us, \"Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.\" (1 Peter 5:8 NIV)\n\nThere are major problems in the world today, and their impact is felt by most. Difficulties, hardships, and opposition come in many forms, but we must never lose sight of their true origin.\n\n\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\" (Ephesians 6:12 ESV)\n\nPeople are not the enemy. It's not a co-worker, a political party, or the person in the Oval Office that's the opposition and the source of your hardships. It's the devil and all the spiritual forces of evil that oppose God, who are trying to obstruct his plan and keep you from living your purpose.\n\nWe steward our calling through faith.\n\nAlthough we wrestle against rulers, authorities, cosmic powers, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places, we don't do it alone, and certainly not by our own strength. This is a spiritual battle we must engage and win by faith.\n\nBefore ascending to the Father, Jesus promised His followers, \"I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper (Comforter, Counsellor, Advocate) to be with you forever; the Spirit of Truth… You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you… He will teach you all things\" (John 14:16-17, 26 ESV)\n\nThe Holy Spirit came to indwell and empower the disciples and all believers. This Spirit is the most powerful force in the universe. He lives in us and gives us knowledge so that we can have the mind of Christ, and by his power, we can oppose every work of the enemy.\n\nWe are destroying sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself up against the [true] knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought and purpose captive to the obedience of Christ. (2 Corinthians 10:5 AMP)\n\nDon't let yourself get caught up in the physical world and miss out on what God wants to do in and through you. Your purpose is to glorify Him, and He's calling you to bear fruit where he's planted you. Receive by faith all Jesus has done for you, and be confident that His Spirit is with you, empowering you to fight and win every battle and accomplish your purpose.\n\nFor Further Reading\n\nCapital Campaigns and Biblical Stewardship\n\nHow to Use “Thank You” as a Powerful Opportunity to Connect with Givers\n\nWhen God Provides a Surplus, it’s Always for a Purpose\n\nMarriage and Money\n\nEngaging Givers from First Gift to Lapsed or Legacy\n\nWhy is it So Hard to Give?\n\n. . .\n\nAre you a pastor or church leader?\n\nAt Christian Stewardship Network, we are passionate about teaching the biblical perspective on finances so that you can teach your church with authority, confidence, and integrity.
