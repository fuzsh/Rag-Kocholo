        "text": "In addition to crediting other creators, the point of in-text citations is to get your reader to the long-form citation on the Works Cited page. According to the MLA Handbook, the citation should interrupt the text of your essay as little as possible (227). There are two ways to do this:\n\nSignal phrase (\"Citation in prose\" in the MLA Handbook): Introducing the name of the author or the work's title in the text of your sentence.\n\nParenthetical citation: Paraphrasing an idea or using a quotation without the author/title in your sentence text. The author/title goes in parentheses at the end of your sentence.\n\nSignal Phrase\n\nFormat: Signal phrase, \"quote\" or paraphrase (page number).\n\nThe signal phrase lets your reader know that you are paraphrasing or quoting an idea from someone else's work. If your paper deals with a particular work of literature, or if you are relying heavily on the work of one or more sources, a signal phrase introducing the source is recommended.\n\nPage or paragraph numbers go in parentheses at the end of your sentence. (If your source has no page/paragraph numbers, do not include them.)\n\nIf you are quoting a source, the in-text citation always comes after the closing quotation mark.\n\nIf there is no author, use the title of the work in your signal phrase.\n\nExamples of a Signal Phrase\n\nIn her work Pride and Prejudice, Austen makes the famous observation that \"it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\" (3).\n\nDuhigg argues that we can change our habits, but because they are deeply ingrained into the brain, it can be a struggle to do so (20).\n\nKite reports that Kansas has 5,446 lead pipes per 100,000 residents, the third highest rate in the United States.\n\nThe MLA Handbook encourages writers to use they as a singular pronoun instead of the phrase he or she (91-92).\n\nParenthetical Citations\n\nFormat: \"Quote\" or paraphrase (Author Page).\n\nWhen you do not include the author/title in your sentence text of the paragraph, a complete parenthetical citation is necessary.\n\nQuotes in your paper flow better when they are integrated the into a sentence.\n\nIf the work has no author, use a shortened version of the title in your parenthetical citation.\n\nPage or paragraph numbers come after the author or shortened title.\n\nExamples of a Parenthetical Citation\n\nWe can change our habits, but because they are deeply ingrained into the brain, it can be a struggle to do so (Duhigg 20).\n\nAlthough \"research is a collective process, one shared and added to by all researchers,\" it is not OK to plagiarize someone else's work (Upson et al. 90).\n\nKansas has 5,446 lead pipes per 100,000 residents, the third highest rate in the United States (Kite).\n\nWriters may use they as a singular pronoun instead of the phrase he or she (MLA 91-92).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAusten, Jane.

U of Chicago P, 2015.\n\nAuthor Named in Your Paper\n\nFormat: Signal phrase with author's name, \"quote\" or paraphrase (page if available).\n\nExamples\n\nDuhigg argues that we can change our habits, but it can be a struggle to do so (20).\n\nKite reports that Kansas has 5,446 lead pipes per 100,000 residents, the third highest rate in the United States.\n\nTwo Authors Named in Your Paper\n\nFormat: Signal phrase with author's name, \"quote\" or paraphrase (page if available).\n\nExample\n\nStrunk and White argue that writers should use the active voice because it is \"direct and vigorous\" (18).\n\nThree or More Authors Named in Your Paper\n\nFor a source with three or more authors, the MLA Handbook recommends using the first author's name followed by one of the following phrases: \"and colleagues\" or \"and others\" (232-233).\n\nFormat: Signal phrase with author's name and colleagues/others, \"quote\" or paraphrase (page if available).\n\nExample\n\nTaylor and colleagues explore doctors' responses to patients with chronic illnesses after the doctors' diagnoses with long COVID (839).\n\nOne or Two Authors Not Named in Your Paper\n\nFormat: Signal phrase, \"quote\" or paraphrase (Author page).\n\nExamples\n\nWe can change our habits, but because they are deeply ingrained into the brain, it can be a struggle to do so (Duhigg 20).\n\nWriters should use the active voice because it is \"direct and vigorous\" (Strunk and White 18).\n\nThree or More Authors Not Named in Your Paper\n\nFormat: Signal phrase, \"quote\" or paraphrase (Author et al. page).\n\nExample\n\nAlthough \"research is a collective process, one shared and added to by all researchers,\" it is unacceptable to plagiarize someone else's work (Upson et al. 90).\n\nNo Author\n\nIf the source has no named author, your in-text citation will be an abbreviated version of the title. If it is a very short title, you may use the entire title. If the work without an author is an article, put quotes around the shortened title in the parenthetical citation; if it is a book, italicize it.\n\nFormat: Signal phrase, \"quote\" or paraphrase (Shortened Title page).\n\nFormat: Signal phrase with title, \"quote\" or paraphrase (page).\n\nExamples\n\nFull Title: Go Ask Alice\n\nThe diarist describes her first experience with LSD as \"tremendous and wonderful and miraculous\" (Go Ask 30).\n\nIn Go Ask Alice, the diarist describes her first experience with LSD as \"tremendous and wonderful and miraculous\" (30).\n\nSource with No Page Numbers\n\nWhen citing an article without page numbers in your paper, omit the page element from your in-text citation.\n\nFormat: Signal phrase with author's name, \"quote\" or paraphrase.\n\nFormat: \"Quote\" or paraphrase (Author).\n\nExamples\n\nAccording to DeRuy, a baby’s caretakers \"have an enormous role in creating an environment where children have both the freedom and support to learn.\"\n\nA baby’s caretakers \"have an enormous role in creating an environment where children have both the freedom and support to learn\" (DeRuy).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDeRuy, Emily. “The Complex Lives of Babies.” The Atlantic, 20 June 2016, www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/06/the-complex-lives-of-babies/487679/.\n\nDuhigg, Charles.
