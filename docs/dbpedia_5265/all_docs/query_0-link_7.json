Giving up in these cases can be seen as a form of surrender.\n\nGive up is also used in a number of other ways.\n\nTo give up information is to reveal or disclose it, especially when forced to.\n\nTo give up a possession is to relinquish it.\n\nTo give up a person usually means to turn them over to the authorities or reveal their location."
