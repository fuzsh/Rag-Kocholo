        "text": "Millions of Christians all over the world will be marking the start of an important period of time on 14 February 2024.\n\nThat is because it is Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent in Western Christian churches.\n\nDuring Lent, many people decide to give something up that they love - perhaps chocolate, sweets or even using social media.\n\nOthers might decide to take up something, like helping out more with chores at home or making an effort to do nice things for their family and friends.\n\nThis year, Lent starts on Wednesday 14 February and leads to Easter Sunday, on 31 March.\n\nLent is a period of 40 days during which many Christians remember the events leading up to and including the death of Jesus Christ, whose life and teachings are the foundation of Christianity.\n\nThe 40-day period is called Lent after an old English word meaning 'lengthen'.\n\nThis is because of the time of year when it happens, as this is when the days start to get longer, as we approach Summer.\n\nIt is a time of reflection and of asking for forgiveness, and when Christians prepare to celebrate Jesus's resurrection at the feast of Easter, which comes at the very end of Lent.\n\nAsh Wednesday is the day after Shrove Tuesday, which is also known as Pancake Day.\n\nExactly when Ash Wednesday is each year depends on when Easter is, so the date changes.\n\nOn Ash Wednesday, lots of churches hold special services where worshippers are marked on the forehead with ash and which is where the day gets its name from.\n\nTypically, the ash is made from burning special crosses made out of palm wood, which were used in church services on the previous year's Palm Sunday. It is sometimes mixed with special oil.\n\nMillions of people do this during Lent as a sign of sacrifice and to test their self-discipline.\n\nChristians believe that this is to represent Jesus Christ's sacrifice when he went into the desert to pray and fast for 40 days before later dying on the cross.\n\nIn the Bible's New Testament, while Jesus was there, Satan tempted him to turn away from God and worship him instead, but Jesus refused to, which is why people might give something up, in order to test their own self-discipline too."
