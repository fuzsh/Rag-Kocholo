        "text": "(pronounced ā-fab) Acronym meaning Assigned Female at Birth. AFAB people may or may not identify as female some or all of the time. AFAB is a useful term for educating about issues that may happen to these bodies without connecting to womanhood or femaleness. Generally not considered an identity, as calling a transgender man “AFAB,” for example, erases his identity as a man. Instead, use a person’s pronouns and self-description.\n\nSee also Binding\n\nA term generally relating to individuals who support marginalized groups. In the LGBTQ+ community, this term is used to describe an individual who is supportive of LGBTQ+ individuals and the community, either personally or as an advocate. Allies include both heterosexual and cisgender people who advocate for equality in partnership with LGBTQ+ people, as well as people within the LGBTQ+ community who advocate for others in the community. “Ally” is not an identity, and allyship is an ongoing process of learning that includes action. (Visit Straight for Equality to learn more about how to become an active and effective ally.)\n\n(pronounced ā-mab) Acronym meaning Assigned Male at Birth. AMAB people may or may not identify as male some or all of the time. AMAB is a useful term for educating about issues that may happen to these bodies without connecting to manhood or maleness. Generally not considered an identity, as calling a transgender woman “AMAB,” for example, erases her identity as a woman. Instead, use a person’s pronouns and self-description.\n\nRefers to a romantic orientation on the aromantic spectrum. It can be defined as 1) a romantic orientation that fluctuates, but always stays on the aromantic spectrum. Or 2) a romantic orientation that fluctuates between being alloromantic, completely aromantic, and/or somewhere in between. Aroflux people can be romance-repulsed, indifferent/neutral/apathetic towards romance, or romance positive. They can have any sexual orientation.\n\nSee also Alloromantic, Allosexual, Aromantic\n\nSometimes abbreviated as aro (pronounced ā-row), the term refers to an individual who does not experience romantic attraction. Aromantic people exist on a spectrum of romantic attraction and can use terms such as gray aromantic or grayromantic to describe their place within that spectrum. Aromantic people can experience sexual attraction, although not all do.\n\nSee also Grayromantic\n\nSometimes abbreviated as ace, the term refers to an individual who does not experience sexual attraction. Each asexual person experiences relationships, attraction, and arousal differently. Asexuality is distinct from chosen behavior such as celibacy or sexual abstinence; asexuality is a sexual orientation that does not necessarily define sexual behaviors. Asexual people exist on a spectrum of sexual attraction and can use terms such as gray asexual or gray ace to describe themselves.\n\nThe gender assumed about an individual, based on their assigned sex as well as apparent societal gender markers and expectations, such as physical attributes and expressed characteristics. Examples of assuming a person’s gender include using pronouns for a person before learning what pronouns they use, or calling a person a man or a woman without knowing their gender.\n\nOften described as offensive, a term used to identify a person who is interested in exploring their attraction to people of the same gender as their own and different genders from their own. The term is considered offensive as it implies that sexual orientation is something that must be explored sexually and romantically before it can be determined. Additionally, many feel that this term invalidates bisexuality by implying that it is a questioning or exploratory phase, instead of a valid sexual orientation. Use this term only when self-identifying or when quoting an individual who self-identifies as bi-curious.\n\nSee also Heteroflexible, Bisexual\n\nThe process of tightly wrapping one’s chest in order to minimize the appearance of having breasts, often by using a binder. Note: One must bind themselves carefully, with appropriate materials, and for reasonable periods of time in order to avoid discomfort and potential negative health impacts. Unsafe binding can lead to negative health outcomes, such as broken ribs and trouble breathing.\n\nShort for biological essentialism. Reliance or weaponization of biology in an attempt to disprove trans people’s genders. Common bioessentialist arguments reduce people to their chromosomes (though there are more than 30 chromosome combinations that people have); their genitalia (though there are many natural variations); or their binary gender (though gender and sex are not binary).\n\nRefers to anatomical, physiological, genetic, or physical attributes that determine if a person is male, female, or intersex. These include both primary and secondary sex characteristics, including genitalia, gonads, hormone levels, hormone receptors, chromosomes, and genes. Often also referred to as “sex,” “physical sex,” “anatomical sex,” or specifically as “sex assigned at birth.” Biological sex is often conflated or interchanged with gender, which is more societal than biological, and involves personal identity factors.\n\nAnimosity, hatred, or dislike of bisexual people which may manifest in the form of prejudice or bias. Biphobia often stems from lack of knowledge about bisexual people and the issues they face, and can sometimes be alleviated with education and support. PFLAG does not use this term as it frequently prevents such educational dialogue. Related to homophobia and transphobia.\n\nSee also Bisexual, Homophobia, Transphobia\n\nRefers to an individual who acknowledges in themselves the potential to be romantically attracted to people of more than one gender, not necessarily at the same time, in the same way, or to the same degree. Individuals who identify as biromantic aren't necessarily sexually attracted to the same people to whom they're romantically attracted.\n\nCommonly referred to as bi or bi+. According to bi+ educator and advocate ​Robyn Ochs, the term refers to a person who acknowledges in themselves the potential to be attracted--romantically, emotionally and/or sexually--to people of more than one gender, not necessarily at the same time, in the same way, or to the same degree. ​The \"bi\" in bisexual can refer to attraction to genders similar to and different from one's own. People who identify as bisexual need not have had equal sexual or romantic experience--or equal levels of attraction--with people across genders, nor any experience at all; attraction and self-identification determines orientation.\n\nSurgery performed on an individual’s reproductive system as a part of gender-affirming surgery. Not all trans people undergo medical interventions as part of their transition. As with any other aspect of transition, trans people retain the right not to discuss their surgical history, and surgery does not define gender.\n\nSee also Gender-Affirming Surgery (GAS)\n\nAlso known as found family, people who support an LGBTQ+ person, who are not biologically related, and who often fill the role of the biological family if an LGBTQ+ person’s family is not supportive of them. PFLAG supports LGBTQ+ people in the pursuit of their found families through local chapter meetings and online communities.\n\n(pronounced sis-gender): A term used to refer to an individual whose gender identity aligns with the sex assigned to them at birth. The prefix cis- comes from the Latin word for “on the same side as.” People who are both cisgender and heterosexual are sometimes referred to as cishet (pronounced “sis-het”) individuals. The term cisgender is not a slur. People who are not trans should avoid calling themselves “normal” and instead refer to themselves as cisgender or cis.\n\nDescribes a person who is not open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. A closeted person may be referred to as being “in the closet.” There are many degrees to being out/closeted; closeted individuals may be out to just themselves, close friends, or to their larger network, or not publicly open about their status as LGBTQ+ people.\n\nSee also Coming Out, Disclosure\n\nFor LGBTQ+ people, coming out is the process of self-identifying and self-acceptance that entails the sharing of their identity with others. Sometimes referred to as disclosing. Individuals often recognize a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/gender-expansive, or queer identity within themselves first, and then might choose to reveal it to others. There are many different degrees of being out, and coming out is a lifelong process. Coming out can be an incredibly personal and transformative experience. It is critical to respect where each person is within their process of self-identification, and up to each person, individually, to decide if and when and to whom to come out or disclose.\n\nSee also Closeted, Disclosure\n\nFrom the Queerspawn Resource Project: Living Language Guide, “Speaks to the feeling shared by many people with LGBTQ+ parents that they grew up immersed in queer culture, including traditions, celebrations, media, and language. Queerspawn are often raised in the queer community and learn about society primarily through a queer lens, and experience heterosexual culture and its norms as a secondary cultural influence.” Some LGBTQ+ individuals use the term to describe allies who go over and above expectations in demonstrations of both their allyship and understanding of queer culture.\n\nSee also Queerspawn\n\nOccurs when an individual, intentionally or not, refers to the name that a transgender or gender-expansive individual used at a different time in their life. Avoid this practice, as it can cause trauma, stress, embarrassment, and even danger. Some may prefer the terms birth name, given name, or old name.\n\nA word that some people use to describe the act or process of revealing one’s transgender or gender-expansive identity to another person in a specific instance. Some find the term offensive, implying the need to disclose something shameful, and prefer to use the term coming out, whereas others find “coming out” offensive, and prefer to use disclosure.\n\nThe theatrical performance of one or multiple genders (often including makeup, costume, dance, lip-syncing, and temporary body modifications). Performers who present in a feminine manner are sometimes called Drag Queens, while performers who present in a masculine manner are sometimes called Drag Kings. There are also Drag Performers who do not perform in a binary way. These performances often push traditional boundaries of gender presentation, calling into question societally defined gender roles. Drag performance refers to expression and performance, which is different from transgender, which refers to gender identity.\n\nSee also Transgender, Gender Identity\n\nA queer woman or AFAB person. While some believe it to only describe masculine lesbians, many bisexual and gender-expansive people also connect to this term. Traditionally a slur, the term has been reclaimed and should only be used to self identify or to refer to the way an individual has identified themselves, i.e., “She identifies as a dyke.”\n\nAn alternative spelling to folks, pronounced the same way. While folx is viewed by some as a more inclusive version of the word folks, both are gender-neutral ways of addressing a group of people. PFLAG National does not use folx because it is difficult for screen readers (for people with visual disabilities) to read.\n\nA broad term, not only used within the LGBTQ+ community, which describes the process by which an individual decides who does or does not belong to a certain community, group, or identity. For example, a gay man telling a questioning man that he has to have sex with another man before he can call himself gay is an example of gatekeeping. Gatekeeping, which can come from inside or outside the LGBTQ+ community should be avoided, as it is painful and invalidating to the recipient in either instance.\n\nA term used to describe people who are emotionally, romantically, and/or physically attracted to people of the same gender (e.g., gay man, gay people). In contemporary contexts, lesbian is often a preferred term for women, though many women use the term gay to describe themselves. People who are gay need not have had any sexual experience. Attraction and self-identification determines sexual orientation, not the gender or sexual orientation of one’s partner. The term should not be used as an umbrella term for LGBTQ+ people, e.g. “the gay community,” because it excludes other sexual orientations and genders. Avoid using gay in a disparaging manner, e.g. “that’s so gay,” as a synonym for stupid or bad.\n\nThe disproven concept that there are only two genders, male and female, and that everyone must be one or the other. Also often misused to assert that gender is biologically determined. This concept also reinforces the idea that men and women are opposites and have different roles in society (see Gender Roles).\n\nSee also Gender Roles\n\nThe distress caused when a person's assigned sex at birth and assumed gender is not the same as the one with which they identify. Not all people who are transgender experience gender dysphoria. According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the term \"...is intended to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults.\"\n\nAn umbrella term for those who do not follow gender stereotypes, or who expand ideas of gender expression or gender identity. People of any gender identity can be gender expansive. While some parents and allies use the term gender expansive, the preferred term by the LGBTQ+ community is gender non-conforming. Gender expansive is not equivalent to non-binary. It is important to respect and use the terms people use for themselves, regardless of any prior associations or ideas about those terms.\n\nSee also Gender Non-Conforming (GNC)\n\nThe manner in which a person communicates about gender to others through external means such as clothing, appearance, or mannerisms. This communication may be conscious or subconscious and may or may not reflect their gender identity or sexual orientation. While most people’s understandings of gender expressions relate to masculinity and femininity, there are countless combinations that may incorporate both masculine and feminine expressions, or neither, through androgynous expressions. All people have gender expressions, and an individual’s gender expression does not automatically imply one’s gender identity.\n\nA person’s deeply held core sense of self in relation to gender. Gender identity does not always correspond to biological sex. People become aware of their gender identity at many different stages of life, from as early as 18 months and into adulthood. Gender identity is a separate concept from sexuality and gender expression.\n\nSee also Sexual Orientation, Gender Expression, Gender\n\nAn umbrella term for those who do not follow gender stereotypes, or who expand ideas of gender expression or gender identity. GNC does NOT mean non-binary and cisgender people can be GNC as well. It is important to respect and use the terms people use for themselves, regardless of any prior associations or ideas about those terms. While some parents and allies use the term “gender expansive,\" gender non-conforming is the preferred term by the LGBTQ+ community; always use the term preferred by an individual with whom you are interacting.\n\nSee also Gender Expansive\n\nA process that influences and teaches an individual how to behave as a man or a woman, based on culturally defined gender roles. Parents, teachers, peers, media, and faith traditions are some of the many agents of gender socialization. Gender socialization looks very different across cultures, both inside and outside of the U.S. It is heavily impacted by other intersecting identities.\n\nSee also Gender Roles, Intersectionality\n\nA term sometimes used by the medical community to describe individuals who dress, behave, or express themselves in a way that does not conform to dominant gender norms. Some people avoid this term because it suggests that these identities are abnormal, preferring terms such as gender non-conforming.\n\nSee also Gender Expansive, Gender Non-Conforming (GNC)\n\nNon-surgical gender-affirming care and services that support transgender people in their transition goals. Examples include electrolysis or laser hair removal, voice training, and tailored or affirming clothing and accessories. Many cisgender (see Cisgender) people use gender-affirming services as well, including the ones above, but because they are not transgender, people don’t often refer to them in this way.\n\nSee also Cisgender\n\nSurgical procedures that can help people adjust their bodies to match their innate gender identity more closely. Used interchangeably with gender affirmation, gender confirmation, and gender-confirming surgery. Not every transgender person will desire or have resources for gender-affirming surgery. Use this term in place of the older term sex change. Also sometimes referred to as gender reassignment surgery, genital reconstruction surgery, or medical transition.\n\nSee also Top Surgery, Bottom Surgery, Transition\n\nA branch of radical feminism which is critical of gender. This belief maintains that a person's sex is distinct from their gender identity, and that sex is immutable. People with this belief often see transgender people as the sex they were assigned--and gender they were assumed--at birth. They believe that trans women are not women and/or should not be included in female spaces.\n\nSee also Gender-Critical Feminists, TERF\n\nA salutation or title that does not specify the gender of the addressee in a formal communication or introduction. Also used for persons who do not identify as a binary gender, addressing an individual where the gender is unknown, or if the correspondence-sender is unsure of the gender of the person to whom the correspondence is being sent. Mx. (pronounced mix) and M. are the most commonly used gender-neutral salutations (e.g. “Dear Mx. Smith…” or “Hello M. Moore…:). Generally, M. is used when the gender is unknown, and Mx. is used when the person uses that prefix.\n\n​​Commonly understood as language that has a bias towards a particular sex or social gender. This can lead to women being excluded or rendered invisible. For example, the way titles are used. “Mr.” can refer to any man, regardless of marriage status, whereas “Miss” and “Mrs.” define women by whether they are married, which until quite recently meant defining them by their relationships with men. Some languages, like Spanish, French, and others, will change the endings of words to associate them with a particular gender and person. English is NOT a gendered language in this particular way.\n\nRefers to individuals who blur preconceived boundaries of gender in relation to the gender binary; they can also reject commonly held ideas of static gender identities. Sometimes used as an umbrella term in much the same way that the term queer is used, but only refers to gender, and thus should only be used when self-identifying or quoting an individual who uses the term genderqueer for themselves.\n\nSee also Gender Binary\n\nA straight person who is most often attracted to people of a different gender from themselves but sometimes experiences attraction to people of the same gender as them. It is distinct from bisexuality. The term can have negative connotations of experimentation or indecision.\n\nSee also Bi-curious\n\nA gay person who is most often attracted to people of the same gender as themselves but sometimes experience attraction to people of other genders or engage in sexual behavior with people of different genders from their own. It is distinct from bisexuality.\n\nSee also Bisexual\n\nAnimosity, hatred, or dislike of LGBTQ+ people that often manifests itself in the form of prejudice and bias. Homophobia often stems from lack of knowledge about LGBTQ+ people and the issues they face and can sometimes be alleviated with education and support. PFLAG does not use this term as it frequently prevents such educational dialogue. Related to biphobia and transphobia.\n\nSee also Biphobia, Transphobia\n\nA term to describe gay, lesbian, or queer people which may be offensive depending on the speaker. Originally used as a scientific or clinical term to describe LGBTQ+ people, the word has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community and may be colloquially used by an LGBTQ+ person to reference themselves or another member of the community. Non-LGBTQ+ people should avoid using the term.\n\nA type of gender-affirming treatment that allows trans and gender-expansive people to medically transition or feel more at home in their bodies. Those taking testosterone (masculinizing hormones) may grow more facial/body hair and notice their voices deepening. Those taking estrogen (feminizing hormones) may see some breast growth and decreased libido. Many intersex people take HRT to balance the naturally occurring levels of estrogen and testosterone in their bodies. Benefits of such therapy can include improved mental and physical wellness, and reduced anxiety and dysphoria, for those who experience it.\n\nSee also Gender-Affirming Surgery (GAS), Transition\n\nThe underground subculture consisting of mainly Black and Latinx members of the LGBTQ+ community who ‘walk’ to earn recognition and awards within their community. ‘Houses’ are chosen families that individuals compete with and often live with. These categories represent the barriers that Queer and Trans People of Color (QTPOC) face in accessing formal employment, housing, and public services.\n\nSee also Chosen Family\n\nTerm for the exaggeration of stereotypically male behavior, based on so-called gender roles (see Gender Roles). Hypermasculine behavior is often expected of trans men in order to be seen as “real” men. Heterosexual men may display hypermasculine behaviors to “prove” they are not gay, even though gay men have many understandings of their own masculinity.\n\nSee also Gender Roles\n\nWhen a person, whether consciously or unconsciously accepts homophobic biases and applies these biases to themselves. It can happen to anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, though most studies of internalized homophobia have looked at people who identify as LGBTQ+. This occurs as a result of the assumption that all people are or should be heterosexual.\n\nIntersex is the current term used to refer to people who are biologically between the medically expected definitions of male and female. This can be through variations in hormones, chromosomes, internal or external genitalia, or any combination of any or all primary and/or secondary sex characteristics. While many intersex people are noticed as intersex at birth, many are not. As intersex is about biological sex, it is distinct from gender identity and sexual orientation. An intersex person can be of any gender identity and can also be of any sexual orientation and any romantic orientation. The Intersex Society of North America opposes the practice of genital mutilation on infants and children who are intersex, as does PFLAG National. Formerly, the medical terms hermaphrodite and pseudohermaphrodite were used; these terms are now considered neither acceptable nor scientifically accurate.\n\nA scale developed in the 1940s by Alfred Kinsey which places an individual’s sexual orientation on a spectrum from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual). The scale included the measurement “X” which indicated an absence of sexual behavior. The scale was an early recognition of fluid sexual orientation and was credited with challenging the heterosexual/homosexual binary.\n\n(Pronounced Latin-ex or la-TEEN-ex) A gender-neutral term--sometimes used in place of the gendered, binary terms Latino or Latina--used to describe a person of Latin American origin or descent. While some in the progressive space use this term, 2019 Pew research shows that, while one-in-four U.S. Hispanics have heard the term, only 23% of U.S. adults who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino have heard the term, and just 3% say they use it to describe themselves. Some use the term Latine (la-TEEN-eh) as a gender neutral term for Latino or Latina.\n\nAn acronym that collectively refers to individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, sometimes stated as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) or, historically, GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender). The addition of the Q for queer is a more recently preferred version of the acronym as cultural opinions of the term queer focus increasingly on its positive, reclaimed definition. The Q can also stand for questioning, referring to those who are still exploring their own sexuality and/or gender. The “+” represents those who are part of the community but for whom LGBTQ does not accurately capture or reflect their identity.\n\nSee also Queer\n\nTo refer to an individual using a word, especially a pronoun or form of address, which does not correctly reflect their gender. This may be unintentional and without ill intent or can be a maliciously employed expression of bias. Regardless of intent, misgendering has a harmful impact.\n\nSee also Mispronoun\n\nSimilar to misgendering, mispronouning is to refer to a person with the incorrect pronouns. This term is less common than misgendering, as pronouns are often an important aspect of people’s genders. This may be unintentional and without ill intent, or can be a maliciously employed expression of bias. Regardless of intent, mispronouning has a harmful impact.\n\nSee also Misgender\n\nA pronoun mix, like he/they or she/they, is generally shorthand for “I use both he/him/his and they/them/theirs pronouns.” The use of two pronouns means they can generally be used interchangeably. However, desired use is different for each person; it is okay to ask if a person uses one over another.\n\nRefers to a large single upright block of stone, formally, and a group or organization with unified and unchanging attributes, informally. In context, the term monolith is used to show that “[group of people] are not a monolith.” It means that members of a group have varying experiences, and the voice of one member of the group should not be taken as a representation of the experiences of all members of that group.\n\nStands for Men Who Have Sex with Men. Reports on STIs and public health commonly use this term, although those who identify as MSM might or might not identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community. This designation often allows discrimination against GBTQ+ men, for example in blood donation.\n\nRefers to people who do not subscribe to the gender binary. They might exist between or beyond the man-woman binary. Some use the term exclusively, while others may use it interchangeably with terms like genderqueer, genderfluid, gender non-conforming, gender diverse, or gender expansive. It can also be combined with other descriptors e.g. nonbinary woman or transmasc nonbinary. Language is imperfect, so it’s important to trust and respect the words that nonbinary people use to describe their genders and experiences. Nonbinary people may understand their identity as falling under the transgender umbrella, and may thus identify as transgender. Sometimes abbreviated as NB or Enby, the term NB has been used historically to mean non-Black, so those referring to nonbinary people should avoid using NB.\n\nA term to describe a nonbinary person whose primary romantic, emotional and/or sexual attraction is to women. Lesbianism has historically included people of varying gender expressions and people with varying relationships to the lesbian community (before bisexual and pansexual came into common use, any woman who felt romantic, emotional and/or sexual attraction to women was considered a lesbian). This combination of terms came about due to the lack of a specific term for a nonbinary person who is only attracted to one gender.\n\nSee also Butch, Stud, Femme\n\nRefers to an individual who is romantically attracted to all genders, with gender playing a role in the attraction. This term differs from panromantic (see Panromantic), in that people who are panromantic are also romantically attracted to people of all genders, but do not notice their partner's gender.\n\nSee also Panromantic\n\nRefers to a person whose emotional, romantic, and/or physical attraction is to people of any gender, and who notice their partner's gender. This term differs from pansexual, in that people who are pansexual are also emotionally, romantically, and physically attracted to people of all genders, but do not notice their partner's gender.\n\nA term which describes people who openly self-identify as LGBTQ+ in their private, public, and/or professional lives. There are many states of being out; individuals can be out only to themselves, close friends, or everyone. Some transgender people prefer to use the term disclose.\n\nSee also Coming Out, Disclosure, Outing\n\nWith sexuality, the act of presenting as straight. With gender, the act of presenting as cisgender or gender-typical, which is generally accomplished through conforming to gender roles. People may try to pass in anti-LGBTQ+ environments to ensure their safety. People who pass as straight or cis have the choice to either talk about their LGBTQ+ experience or to “fit in” to a cis- and hetero-normative world. Passing is not required for LGBTQ+ people to deserve respect and love.\n\nSee also Gender Roles\n\nA term used to describe people who have the desire for multiple consenting intimate relationships at the same time. Also referred to as “ethically non-monogamous,” “polya” or “polyam.” There is a movement away from shortening polyamorous to “poly” since poly already means Polynesian. Consent and transparency are key components of polyamorous relationships.\n\nRefers to an individual who experiences romantic attraction towards people of more than one sex or gender, but not all. Unlike panromantic this term implies that sex or gender is still a factor in attraction, and it does not imply the gender binary as biromantic does.\n\nSee also Panromantic, Biromantic, , Alloromantic, Aromantic, Demiromantic, Grayromantic, Heteroromantic, Homoromantic, Omniromantic, Polyromantic, Transromantic\n\nThis is an emergency prescription antiretroviral medication to be taken within 72 hours of possible exposure to HIV. Possible exposure includes during sex, sharing needles to inject drugs, or if you have been sexually assaulted. Though PEP is highly effective in preventing HIV, it should not be taken in place of other HIV prevention measures, such as taking PrEP or practicing safe sex.\n\nSee also Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nThe terms used to describe the surgery status of a transgender person. Pre-Op means that a person has not had gender-affirming surgery and may or may not plan to. Post-Op means that an individual has had gender-affirming surgery. Non-Op means that a person does not plan to have gender-affirming surgery. The choice to have gender-affirming surgery is highly personal and does affect the validity of a person’s gender identity. Refrain from discussing a trans person’s surgical history or future unless they bring up the topic.\n\nSee also Bottom Surgery, Gender-Affirming Surgery (GAS), Top Surgery, Transition\n\nA prescription medication those at higher risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use. Though PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV, it should not be taken in place of other HIV prevention measures, such as practicing safe sex and not sharing drug-related injection equipment.\n\nSee also Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)\n\nA preference is a specific set of desires people have in romantic, emotional and/or sexual partners. People’s sexual orientations are not preferences, but they can have preferences (e.g. having a “type”) in the people they become involved with. Preferences can be logistical (e.g. lives within a certain distance, not looking for a relationship) and interest based (e.g. likes to stay in, enjoys long walks on the beach). They can also be influenced by personal and systemic prejudices (e.g. not considering people whose gender expressions do not conform to conventional standards of that gender, people whose bodies are not conventionally attractive, or people with other marginalized identities). People can have their own preferences but should consider examining why they hold these preferences in order to make sure they are not reproducing inequalities.\n\nUnearned benefits, which are often unconscious or taken for granted, afforded to a particular population in society based on norms. There are multiple types of privilege, i.e., race privilege, gender privilege, sexual orientation privilege, etc. For example, heterosexuals have privilege in a heterosexist society because of their sexual orientation.\n\nThe words used to refer to a person other than their name. Common pronouns are they/them, he/him, and she/her. Neopronouns are pronouns created to be specifically gender neutral, including xe/xem, ze/zir, and fae/faer. Pronouns are sometimes called Personal Gender Pronouns, or PGPs. For those who use pronouns--and not all people do--they are not preferred, they are essential.\n\nA term used by some LGBTQ+ people to describe themselves and/or their community. Reclaimed from its earlier negative use--and valued by some for its defiance--the term is also considered by some to be inclusive of the entire community and by others who find it to be an appropriate term to describe their more fluid identities. Traditionally a negative or pejorative term for people who are LGBTQ+, some people within the community dislike the term. Due to its varying meanings, use this word only when self-identifying or quoting an individual who self-identifies as queer (i.e., “My cousin identifies as queer” or “My cousin is a queer person”).\n\nAlso referred to as Biological Sex. Refers to anatomical, physiological, genetic, or physical attributes that determine if a person is male, female, or intersex.
