Before Jesus came to earth, the people were required to work hard for every blessing from God. God’s ability to show favor to them depended on what they did first, and strict obedience to the Law of Moses was required in order to escape punishment. Jesus’ death and resurrection reversed the order and made available new life that was previously closed off to us."
