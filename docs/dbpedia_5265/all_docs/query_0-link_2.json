It should be, But emptied (or, stripped) Himself of His glory by having taken on Him the form of a slave and having been made (or, born) in likeness of men. The \"glory\" is the \"glory which He had with the Father before the world was\" (John 17:5; comp. Philippians 1:14), clearly corresponding to the Shechinah of the Divine Presence. Of this He stripped Himself in the Incarnation, taking on Him the \"form (or, nature) of a servant\" of God. He resumed it for a moment in the Transfiguration; He was crowned with it anew at the Ascension.\n\nMade in the likeness of man.--This clause, at first sight, seems to weaken the previous clause, for it does not distinctly express our Lord's true humanity. But we note that the phrase is \"the likeness of men,\" i.e., of men in general, men as they actually are. Hence the key to the meaning is to be found in such passages as Romans 8:3, God sent His own Son in \"the likeness of sinful flesh;\" or Hebrews 2:17; Hebrews 4:15, \"It behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren,\" \"in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\" It would have been an infinite humiliation to have assumed humanity, even in unique and visible glory; but our Lord went beyond this, by deigning to seem like other men in all things, one only of the multitude, and that, too, in a station, which confused Him with the commoner types of mankind. The truth of His humanity is expressed in the phrase \"form of a servant;\" its unique and ideal character is glanced at when it is said to have worn only the \"likeness of men.\" . . .\n\nVerse 7. - But made himself of no reputation; rather, as R.V., but emptied himself; not, he indeed, of the Godhead, which could not be, but of its manifestation, its glory. This he did once for all, as the aorist implies, at the Incarnation. The word \"emptied' involves a previous fullness, \"a precedent plenitude\" (Pearson on the Creed, 2:25). The Divine majesty of which he emptied himself was his own, his own rightful prerogative; and his humiliation was his own voluntary act - he emptied himself. \"He used his equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement\" (Alford). \"Manebat plenus, John 1:14, et tureen perinde se gessit ac si esset\" (Bengel). And took upon him the form of a servant; rather, as R.V., taking the form. The two clauses refer to the same act of self-humiliation regarded from its two sides. He emptied himself of his glory, taking at the same time the form (μορφήν as in Ver. 6, the essential attributes) of a servant, literally, of a slave. Observe, he was originally (ὑπάρχων) in the form of God; he took (λαβών) the form of a slave. The Godhead was his by right, the manhood by his own voluntary act: both are equally real; he is perfect God and perfect Man. Isaiah prophesied of Christ (Isaiah 49 and Isaiah 52; comp. Acts 2:33, in the Greek or R.V.) as the Servant of Jehovah; he came to do the Father's will, submitting his own will in all things: \"Not as I will, but as thou wilt\" (comp. Matthew 20:27, 28; Mark 10:44, 45). And was made in the likeness of men; translate, becoming, or, as R.V., being made (aorist participle). This clause is another description of the one act of the Incarnation he was God, he became man. Form (μορφή) asserts the reality of our Lord's human nature. Likeness (ὁμοίωμα) refers only to external appearance: this word, of course, does not imply that our Lord was not truly man, but, as Chrysostom says ('Hom.,' 8:247), he was more. than man; \"We are soul and body, but he is God and soul and body.\" The likeness of men; because Christ is the Representative of humanity: he took upon him, not a human person, but human nature. He is one person in two natures. As Bishop Lightfoot says, \"Christ, as the second Adam, represents, not the individual man, but the human race.\" Parallel Commentaries ...\n\nGreek\n\nbut\n\nἀλλὰ (alla)\n\nConjunction\n\nStrong's 235: But, except, however.
