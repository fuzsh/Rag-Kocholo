        "text": "Answer\n\nJesus is referred to as the âSon of Manâ 82 times in the New Testament (NIV and ESV). In fact, Son of Man is the primary title Jesus used when referring to Himself (e.g., Matthew 12:32; 13:37; Luke 12:8; John 1:51). The only use of Son of Man in a clear reference to Jesus, spoken by someone other than Jesus, came from the lips of Stephen as he was being martyred (Acts 7:56).\n\nSon of Man is a title of humanity. Other titles for Christ, such as Son of God, are overt in their focus on His deity. Son of Man, in contrast, focuses on the humanity of Christ. God called the prophet Ezekiel âson of manâ 93 times. In this way, God was simply calling Ezekiel a human being. Son of man is simply a periphrastic term for âhuman.â Jesus Christ was truly a human being. He came âin the fleshâ (1 John 4:2).\n\nSon of Man is a title of humility. The Second Person of the Trinity, eternal in nature, left heavenâs glory and took on human flesh, becoming the Son of Man, born in a manger and âdespised and rejected by mankindâ (Isaiah 53:3). The Son of Man had âno place to lay his headâ (Luke 9:58). The Son of Man ate and drank with sinners (Matthew 11:19). The Son of Man suffered at the hands of men (Matthew 17:12). This intentional lowering of His status from King of Heaven to Son of Man is the epitome of humility (see Philippians 2:6–8).\n\nSon of Man is a title of deity. Ezekiel may have been a son of man, but Jesus is the Son of Man. As such, Jesus is the supreme example of all that God intended mankind to be, the embodiment of truth and grace (John 1:14). In Him âall the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily formâ (Colossians 2:9). For this reason, the Son of Man was able to forgive sins (Matthew 9:6). The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28). The Son of Man came to save lives (Luke 9:56; 19:10), rise from the dead (Mark 9:9), and execute judgment (John 5:27). At His trial before the high priest, Jesus said, âI say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heavenâ (Matthew 26:64). This statement immediately ended the trial, as the court accused the Lord of blasphemy and condemned Him to death (verses 65–66).\n\nSon of Man is a fulfillment of prophecy. Jesusâ claim before the high priest to be the Son of Man was a reference to the prophecy of Daniel 7:13–14, âI was watching in the night visions, And behold, One like the Son of Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near before Him. Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, Which shall not pass away, And His kingdom the one Which shall not be destroyedâ (NKJV). Daniel saw glory, worship, and an everlasting kingdom given to the Messiah—here called the âSon of Manâ—and Jesus applied this prophecy to Himself. Jesus also spoke of His coming kingdom on other occasions (Matthew 13:41; 16:28). The author of Hebrews used a reference to the âson of manâ in the Psalms to teach that Jesus, the true Son of Man, will be the ruler of all things (Hebrews 2:5–9; cf. Psalm 8:4–6). The Son of Man, in fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, will be the King.\n\nJesus was fully God (John 1:1), but He was also fully human (John 1:14). As the Son of God and the Son of Man, He is deserving of both titles."
