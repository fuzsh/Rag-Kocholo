The activities on the table with the check mark mean they will meet the stricter EB job search requirements. EB is currently unavailable in Washington state.\n\nJob search FAQ\n\nI am receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Do I need to look for work?\n\nYes. You are required to complete at least one approved job search activity, even if you are on PUA. We strongly encourage you to complete at least three activities because:\n\nThe PUA program expired on the week ending Sept. 4, 2021.\n\nIt can prevent possible issues in the future. If we need to re-evaluate your claim, and find past weeks of yours are eligible for regular unemployment instead of PUA, completing three searches will meet the requirement for regular unemployment benefits and may prevent issues or overpayments on past weeks. You can learn more about why we would re-evaluate your claim on the Potential new claim alert page of our website.\n\nWhat job search activities are only available to claimants who receive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)?\n\nActivity typeApproved job search activityDocumentation ideasApproved for\n\nExtended Benefits* Self-employed and/or business owners ONLY Advertising your business to new and potential customers. Link or screenshot of your ad (digital, newspaper, social media, etc.). Self-employed and/or business owners ONLY Bidding on jobs. Copy or picture of the proposal submitted for the bid. Self-employed and/or business owners ONLY Contacting potential or former clients. Name, date contacted and contact information (email or phone number) of the client contacted. Self-employed and/or business owners ONLY Attending a webinar or workshop to develop business-related skills or learn a new trade. Registration letter or email confirming attendance, or certificate of completion for the workshop or webinar. Self-employed and/or business owners ONLY Using small business services, or consulting with a Small Business Development Center (SBDC) professional (for example: using services on websites such as business.wa.gov or sba.gov). Screenshot to show proof of visit and engagement with a small business service website.\n\nName and contact information of SBDC professional. Self-employed and/or business owners ONLY Other activities to demonstrate ongoing and active efforts to build your business. Screenshot or picture of the renewal of your professional license with Department of Licensing or business license with the Department of Revenue.\n\nName and contact of loan officer for your business loan.\n\nScreenshot with timestamp of website updates for your business website.\n\nScreenshot of a networking event that you attended or hosted. * The Extended Benefits (EB) program allows up to 20 additional weeks of benefits but comes with stricter job search requirements. The activities on the table with the check mark mean they will meet the stricter EB job search requirements. EB is currently unavailable in Washington state.\n\nI cannot work because I am at high-risk for COVID-19. Do I still need to complete the job search activities?\n\nYes. If you are unemployed, it is required by law that you must complete the required job search activities to remain eligible for benefits.\n\nKeep in mind that there are many activities that can be done virtually.\n\nYou can also keep looking for suitable work that can be done from home.\n\nI am self-employed and/or own a business. Do I still need to complete job search activities?\n\nYes. By law you do need to complete the job search activities to remain eligible for benefits. If you are receiving PUA, you need to complete at least one. If you are receiving regular unemployment you need to complete at least three.\n\nThree things to know:\n\nMost activities do not include applying for jobs with other employers.\n\nThere are approved activities specific to self-employed and business owners to make meeting this requirement more relevant to you.\n\nYou can complete any of the approved activities to meet the requirement. You don’t have to stick to only those approved for self-employed and/or business owners.\n\nI’m working part-time because of the pandemic. Do I still need to look for work to receive unemployment benefits?\n\nYes. You are required to look for suitable full-time work, even if you took a part-time job.\n\nI am caring for someone else and can’t work. Do I still need to look for work to receive unemployment benefits?\n\nYes. You must continue to meet the job search requirement to remain eligible for unemployment benefits, even if you are caring for someone else. This includes children who are out of school or daycare due to the pandemic.\n\nAre you receiving Paid Family and Medical Leave benefits? This program is different from Unemployment Insurance and has different requirements. If you are receiving Paid Family and Medical Leave because you are temporarily off work and caring for a family member who is ill or injured, the job search requirement does not apply. Go to paidleave.wa.gov for more information about that program. You cannot receive both unemployment insurance and Paid Family and Medical Leave at the same time.\n\nWhy was I denied for standby when I have a return to work date from my employer?\n\nReinstating standby in our system is taking longer than anticipated and it may create some complications for certain standby requests.\n\nYou may be initially denied standby and later approved if you:\n\nAre connected to an employer, and\n\nHave a return to work date, and\n\nUsed standby earlier in the pandemic, and\n\nDo not have sufficient weeks left of standby on your active claim to be approved for a new request of standby.\n\nIf this applies to you, the old weeks of standby will be cleared once we update our system. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nIf the conditions above do not apply to you, check your denial letter for the reason/s you were denied standby.\n\n3 things to know:\n\nYou must meet the job search requirements until you hear from us that you are approved for standby.\n\nDo you already have a return to work date with your current employer? You still must complete the required number of job search activities until you are approved for standby.\n\nIf you have a job and a return date to that employer, we strongly encourage you to complete job search activities that do not require you apply for jobs or make an employer contact. This will help to not jeopardize your current employer relationship.\n\nYou may receive a denial letter that says you don’t have enough weeks of standby available, but you may later be approved for standby when our system is fully updated.\n\nWe expect our system to be fully updated for these standby requests in August.\n\nComplete the required job search activities (not necessarily applying with other employers if you have a job and a return date to that employer) until you receive an approval letter.\n\nDenial of standby does NOT mean you are denied unemployment benefits.\n\nStandby ONLY waives the job search requirements. It has nothing to do with eligibility for benefits.\n\nWhat are the basic requirements to claim unemployment benefits?\n\nWhile claiming unemployment benefits, you must be:\n\nAble to work.\n\nAvailable for work.\n\nActively seeking suitable work, unless we've told you otherwise.\n\nRegistered for work with a WorkSource employment center or local employment center (if living outside of Washington).\n\nWhile collecting unemployment benefits, you must typically look for suitable work and keep a record of your job search to remain eligible for benefits. You are required to log a combined total of three approved job search activities each week. You can log this information online when you file your weekly claim or you can use our paper job search log, if you file on the phone. WorkSource has programs and services that can help you get back to work faster\n\nIt is very important that you understand your responsibilities when it comes to conducting and documenting your job search to avoid mistakes which could result in you having to repay the benefits you receive.\n\nCan I do the same activity more than once and have them count for multiple job search activities?\n\nNo. You cannot do the exact same activity more than once and have it count. For example:\n\nYou cannot watch the same video multiple times, or apply for the same job multiple times, and have it count.\n\nYou can watch different videos relevant to job search within the same week (for example, one on interview best practices and one on resume writing), or apply for different jobs within the same company, and have each application count.\n\nAre you required to register with your local WorkSource office or American Job Center?\n\nIf you live in Washington, you are automatically registered for work through a Washington state WorkSource office once you file your unemployment claim. The assignment is based on your zip code. If you live outside of Washington, you must register with your local American Job Center within one week from the date you receive your first unemployment benefit payment. If you originally file for benefits from Washington then move within the United States or to Canada and continue to meet all eligibility requirements, you’ll remain eligible for benefits. You must look for work and register for work where you live. Go to WorkSourceWa.com to locate the WorkSource office closest to you.\n\nWhat do I do if I am out of state?\n\nIf you live in another state or relocate to a new area, you must register for work with an American Job Center within one week from the date your first payment is issued on your new or reopened claim. You can locate an American Job Center using the website at servicelocator.org. In many cases you may be able to register online. Contact your local office to find out how to complete the registration process.\n\nIf you do not register for work, you will be denied benefits for each week you are not registered.\n\nAre there exceptions to the job search requirement?\n\nHow will I know if my job search activities have been waived?\n\nWe will notify you in writing through the preferred correspondence method you selected. You must look for work unless you have been notified by the department that you don’t have to. If you are required to look for work, you must meet Washington state’s job search requirements each week you claim benefits (unless we inform you otherwise).\n\nWhat is an employer contact?\n\nWhen inquiring about a position, you must take all steps necessary to apply for the position for the contact to count as a job search activity. You make an employer contact when you ask about or apply for a job. If you have applied for, or inquired about the job, and discovered that the employer is not hiring or accepting applications, you may still count your inquiry as an employer contact if you were unaware the employer was not hiring or accepting applications. You should note that fact in your job search log. You can contact an employer by:\n\nEmail\n\nFax\n\nInternet\n\nMail\n\nPhone\n\nMeeting in-person\n\nVirtual meeting using conferencing services like Skype, Zoom, etc.\n\nAn employer’s self-service kiosk\n\nHow do I document my job search?\n\nIf you use eServices to submit your weekly claim, you can answer “yes” to the job search question each week you complete your required activities. We will require that you enter the details of your job search activities on your weekly claim in order to be eligible for benefits. We highly recommend you use our job search log to keep track of your job search activities. You do not need to provide us with proof of your activities unless we ask for it.\n\nIf you submit weekly claims by phone, you’ll need to keep a written log of your job search activities. We prefer you use the job search log that we provide, but you’re welcome to keep track of your job search activities on any document you choose.\n\nHighly recommended: Keep a written record of your job search\n\nWe prefer you use the job search log that we provide. Please use dark ink and print clearly.\n\nYou can keep track of your job search activities on any document you choose. If you do not use our log, be sure to document the required information to demonstrate you are making an active search for suitable work. You will need to show us this documentation if we ask for it.\n\nWhy keep a written record of job search activities?\n\nWe may contact you for proof of your job search activities even after you’ve stopped claiming each week.\n\nDo I need to submit my job search log?\n\nNo, but we may request to see it at any time. You must keep it at least 30 days after the end of your benefit year or 30 days after you stop receiving benefits, whichever is later. You don’t need to send it to us unless we request it.\n\nWe conduct random reviews of job search activities to make sure you are looking for suitable work. If you are selected for a review or we have a question about your job search, we will request a copy of your job search log(s) and you must provide them as instructed.\n\nWe may send you a letter to schedule a review of your job search activities to make sure you are looking for suitable work, review your eligibility for benefits and, when appropriate, provide feedback on how to improve your job search. Read the letter carefully to see if your interview is by phone or in-person. Have your job search log(s) ready. If your log is missing or incomplete, or you are not making a genuine attempt to find suitable work, we may deny benefits. You then have to pay back benefits for all the weeks you didn’t meet the job search requirements.\n\nWhat happens if I don’t log my job search activities?\n\nEven if you can show you have complied with the job search requirements, we may suggest how to modify your job search efforts or improve your documentation. We may also schedule you for an additional appointment to confirm you are meeting the requirements.\n\nIf you cannot show you are making a genuine attempt to find suitable work, we could deny your benefits. If we deny your benefits, you must pay back benefits you received for weeks you did not meet the job search requirements. In addition, we will schedule a review of your job search activities for all weeks you claimed.\n\nDo I need to accept any job offer I receive?\n\nYou must accept an offer of suitable work based on your skills, abilities and other factors for your occupation in your labor market. If there are limited jobs in your occupation or geographical area, you may have to expand your job search. For example, you may have to consider looking for a job virtually, or in a different field or location.\n\nYou can’t limit your search to jobs that start in the future. For example, if you’re a school bus driver on summer break, you can’t limit your search to jobs that start in the fall or work that will end when school begins. Learn more on the Refusal of work page on our website.\n\nHow can WorkSource help with my job search?\n\nWorkSource offices in Washington state, and affiliates in other states, are partners in the American Job Center network. They provide employment and training services to job seekers and employers. Most services are free.

You also can call 211 for additional resources.\n\nI’m receiving Extended Benefits. Are the job search requirements the same for this program? (Note: Extended Benefits is currently not available in Washington state. Go to the Benefit extensions page to learn more.)\n\nIf you have exhausted your 26 weeks of regular unemployment and your federal PEUC, you may be eligible for Extended Benefits, which allows up to 13 additional weeks of benefits. This program has strict job search requirements, which are different from regular unemployment job search requirements. The consequences for not meeting these job search requirements are high. If you apply and qualify for Extended Benefits, we’ll send you instructions for conducting your job search. Learn more about Extended Benefits and how to apply on the Benefit extensions page.\n\nGet help finding a job\n\nWould you like to connect with a dedicated expert to help you find a job? Then WorkSource is here for you!\n\nWorkSource staff can connect you with employers hiring right now in your community, identify training opportunities or help you brush up on your application and interview skills.\n\nHere’s what to do:\n\nThe best way to connect with a WorkSource team member is virtually.\n\nIf this doesn’t work for you, some WorkSource offices are re-opening for in-person services. This may be by-appointment only.\n\nPlease go to WorkSource's office locator page to find available options for virtual and in-person services in your area.\n\nWe expect demand may be high for WorkSource services as the requirement goes back into effect.
