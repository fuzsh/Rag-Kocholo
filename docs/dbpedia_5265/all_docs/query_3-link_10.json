        "text": "Courtesy form of address\n\nSee also: Honorific\n\nIn the English language, an honorific is a form of address conveying esteem, courtesy or respect. These can be titles prefixing a person's name, e.g.: Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms, Mx, Sir, Dame, Dr, Cllr, Lady, or Lord, or other titles or positions that can appear as a form of address without the person's name, as in Mr President, General, Captain, Father, Doctor, or Earl.[1]\n\nMany forms of honorifics are for members of the nobility, clergy, military, or royalty, these are found mainly in countries that are monarchies.[citation needed] These include \"Your Majesty\", \"Your Royal Highness\" or simply \"Your Highness\", which are used to address certain members of royalty and \"My lord/lady\" or \"Your Lordship/Ladyship\" to address a peer other than a Duke, who is referred to as \"Your Grace\".[citation needed]\n\nCommon titles\n\n[edit]\n\nMaster: ( ) for boys and young men, or as a style for the heir to a Scottish peerage. It may also be used as a professional title, e.g. for the master of a college or the master of a merchant ship.[2]\n\nMr: ( ) for men, regardless of marital status, who do not have another professional or academic title.[3][4] The variant Mister, with the same pronunciation, is sometimes used to give jocular or offensive emphasis, or to address a man whose name is unknown.[5]\n\n\"Mr\" is used with the name of some offices to address a man who is the office-holder, e.g. \"Mr President\"; \"Mr Speaker\", see \"Madam\" below for the equivalent usage for women.\n\nMessrs: is short for the French Messieurs, is a title used to refer to two or more men in a group.\n\nMiss: ( ) for girls, unmarried women, and (in the United Kingdom) married women who continue to use their maiden name (although \"Ms\" is often preferred for the last two). In the United Kingdom, it has traditionally been used in schools to address female teachers, regardless of marital status. It is also used, without a name, to address girls or young women and (in the United Kingdom) to address female shop assistants and wait staff.[6][7][8]\n\nMrs: ( in the United Kingdom, or in the United States generally, or or in the southern United States) for married women who do not have another professional or academic title, an abbreviation of Mistress.[9][10] The variant Missus ( ) is used in the United Kingdom to address a woman whose name is unknown.[11] There are examples of professional women who were unmarried using the title Mrs, such as Mrs Crocombe, the Cook at Audley End House in the late 19th century.\n\nMs: ( or ) for women, regardless of marital status or when marital status is unknown.[12][13]\n\nMx:[14] ( or ) a gender neutral honorific for those who do not wish to specify their gender or who do not identify with Mr/Master or Ms/Mrs/Miss, for example if they are non-binary.[15][16]\n\nFormal titles\n\n[edit]\n\nSir: for men, formally if they have a British knighthood or if they are a baronet (used with first name or full name, never surname alone) or generally (used on its own) as a term of general respect or flattery, when it is equivalent in meaning to \"Madam\" for women (see below).

This title derives from the Hebrew word רַבִּי‎ rabi [ˈʁabi], meaning \"My Master\" (irregular plural רבנים rabanim [ʁabaˈnim]), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \"master\" רב rav [ˈʁav] literally means \"great one\".\n\nThe Reverend: Was often used for rabbis, cantors, mohalim, and shochetim in English-speaking countries. May sometimes be used for Jewish chaplains who are not ordained rabbis. This usage has widely gone out of usage in the modern era.\n\nCantor: Generally used for Jewish clergy trained to perform the sung portions of prayer services. The word \"cantor\" comes from the French word \"chanteur\", meaning \"singer\".\n\nChief Rabbi: Generally used for a leading rabbi of a city or country, often known in Hebrew as רב הראשי. Sometimes an honorific title if a community rabbi has an ancestor who served as a chief rabbi of a town, or for a son of a grand rabbi who is heir apparent to the position of grand rabbi and serves a rabbinical role in a Hasidic community. Generally, in such cases, this is known in Hebrew as אב בית דין, meaning \"leader of the rabbinical court\" (literally \"father of the house of law\"), and abbreviated אב\"ד. May also be titled as גאון אב בית דין or ראש אב בית דין, which would be abbreviated as גאב\"ד or ראב\"ד. These abbreviations may be rendered in English spelling as Ab\"d, Gaava\"d, or Raava\"d, and will often be called \"Rav\". Generally the abbreviated title will be followed either by the name of the city or town (including ancestral towns), or the name of the congregation, or when called \"Rav\" the town or congregation will come before the title. For example, the chief rabbi of the Vien community is known either as \"Ab\"d Vien\" or the \"Vienner Rav\". In some communities, particularly those from Hungarian and Galician backgrounds, the title is used interchangeably with the title of Grand Rabbi or Admo\"r.\n\nGrand Rabbi: The charismatic leader of a Hasidic court or community. Generally known in Hebrew as אדונינו מורינו ורבינו, literally \"our lord, our teacher, our rabbi\", and abbreviated as אדמו\"ר and rendered in English spelling as Admo\"r or Rebbe. Generally the abbreviated title will be followed either by the name of the city or town (including ancestral towns), or the name of the congregation, or when called \"Rebbe\" the town or congregation will come before the title. For example, the grand rabbis of the Boston Hasidic communities would be known as either \"Admo\"r miBoston\" or \"Bostoner Rebbe\".\n\nRebbetzin: A rabbi's wife, although in some sense a religious leader for the women in her community in some communities.\n\nIslam\n\n[edit]\n\nImām: for Islamic clergymen, especially the ones who lead prayers and deliver sermons.\n\nShaykh: umbrella term used for those qualified in various fields of knowledge of Islam.
