In it, any family having more than one child would be subject to harsh fines. Due to the status associated with male heirs, the policy led many families to give up their newborn daughters, ending up in international adoption. Now that over two decades have passed, those daughters have become adults, and many wish to be reunited with their biological parents. In this program, one such woman makes the journey to her homeland to meet her birth parents for the first time.  2024 New York Festivals TV & Film Awards â Human Concerns Category SILVER",

Why were we forced\n\nto give her away?\n\n01:22\n\nChina's Jiangxi Province.\n\n01:24\n\nUnder 38-degree heat, one woman traverses the city streets.\n\n01:29\n\nDo you know anyone who gave up\n\ntheir daughter?\n\n01:35\n\nDo you know anyone who gave up\n\ntheir daughter?\n\n01:41\n\nDo you know anyone who gave up\n\ntheir daughter?\n\n01:44\n\nYou might as well look for stars in the sky.\n\n01:50\n\nLong Stuy is carrying out a nationwide search after coming here from America.\n\n01:59\n\nHer goal is to find the parents of a number of children.\n\n02:03\n\nAll of them were sent overseas for adoption and separated from their birth parents.\n\n02:10\n\nThere are so many people searching for\n\ntheir parents.\n\n02:15\n\nThey've asked me to look for them.\n\n02:19\n\nThat must be like hunting a needle\n\nin a haystack.\n\n02:24\n\nIt happened to many children\n\nin that era.\n\n02:29\n\nIn China, one system was responsible for separating countless children from their parents.\n\n02:37\n\nThe One-Child Policy.\n\n02:40\n\nCreated to curb overpopulation, it spanned the 36 years from 1979 to 2015.\n\n02:50\n\nCalling women of fertile age.\n\n02:55\n\nWhen you hear this announcement,\n\nplease go for a pregnancy test.\n\n03:02\n\nThe nationwide policy set a general limit of a single child per married couple.\n\n03:11\n\nFarming villages in particular held a strong culture of valuing male heirs over females,\n\n03:19\n\nwhich they regarded as preserving the family lineage.\n\n03:23\n\nMany families continued to have children until a son was born, intending to give up their daughters.\n\n03:31\n\nThose who violated the policy\n\nhad to pay a large fine.\n\n03:36\n\nMany parents grappled with how to hide\n\nthe birth of their daughters.\n\n03:42\n\nThe result was many of them being\n\ngiven to orphanages.\n\n03:49\n\nThey would be sent overseas for adoption.\n\n03:57\n\nThrough international adoption, it's estimated that 150,000 children were relocated to various parts of the world.\n\n04:12\n\nThese are all documents for people\n\nsearching for their birth parents.\n\n04:21\n\nThis girl's birth name was Guang Fuyan.\n\nShe was sent to an orphanage in Jiangxi.\n\n04:29\n\nHer English name is Mikayla.\n\n04:45\n\nMy name is Makayla from Blackstone, Massachusetts.\n\n04:49\n\nI'm senior at UMass Amherst, and I'm currently studying anthropology.\n\n04:54\n\nI was adopted when I was 9 months old from China at the Guangcheng Welfare Institute.\n\n05:01\n\nIn my whole town, like, not even just like Chinese or Asian but just like non-white people in general,\n\n05:07\n\nand so I just remember, like wanting to fit in so bad, and wanted to be like everybody else,\n\n05:12\n\nI wanted blonde hair and blue eyes, and I just wanted to not look so different from everybody else.\n\n05:19\n\nI obviously wanna find my birth parents that's why...\n\n05:22\n\nEven the smallest bit of information about like, my history or who my family, my biological family is, anything like that,\n\n05:31\n\nfor me, it's super meaningful and important because I just feel like my whole life has just been like missing something.\n\n05:42\n\nLong set out on a journey on Mikayla's behalf, to locate her biological parents.\n\n05:48\n\nI'm looking for someone named Lai Xiaohua\n\nin the town of Yiqian.\n\n05:56\n\nThat should be the person who\n\nfound her abandoned.\n\n06:03\n\nLong's only clue in this search is the document that was submitted from the orphanage.\n\n06:10\n\n\"Early on the morning of May 30th 2001,\n\nlocal government officials Lai Xiaohua and Tang Mingliang of Yiqian\n\n06:19\n\nfound a recently born girl and delivered her to the orphanage.\"\n\n06:29\n\nDo you know Lai Xiaohua?\n\n06:35\n\nThere are tons of people with that name\n\naround here.\n\n06:39\n\nThat many?\n\n06:41\n\nIt's a very common name here.\n\n06:45\n\nTry asking the local government office.\n\n06:52\n\nLong tries her luck there.\n\n06:56\n\nI've never heard of someone called\n\nLai Xiaohua working here.\n\n07:02\n\nNo Tang Mingliang, either.\n\n07:04\n\nApparently they were officials here.\n\n07:08\n\nYou're sure that you don't know a\n\nTang Mingliang?\n\n07:14\n\nAll the Tangs here are related,\n\nbut I don't know a Mingliang.\n\n07:18\n\nIt's true.\n\n07:22\n\nHer search for the two town officials fails to turn up any leads.\n\n07:30\n\nWith the enormous number of children who were sent to orphanages at the time,\n\n07:34\n\nshe thinks that the names may have been recorded carelessly.\n\n07:40\n\nThis sort of thing happens\n\nall the time.\n\n07:46\n\nBut with nothing else to go off of,\n\nwe can only rely on the document.\n\n08:02\n\nShe drives another 2 hours from Yiqian.\n\n08:05\n\nThis visit is based on information of a woman regretting giving up her daughter.\n\n08:12\n\nI've been searching for a long time,\n\nwithout any luck.\n\n08:19\n\nZhou Xiaofang is 50 years old.\n\n08:22\n\nShe gave up her daughter in the winter of 2001.\n\n08:28\n\nHolding the meaning of living a content life, Zhou had named her Feng Yuan,\n\n08:34\n\nbut she was forced to surrender her soon after birth.\n\n08:37\n\nWhere did you give birth?\n\n08:42\n\nIn an old clay and tile home.\n\n08:46\n\nBecause the policy was so strict,\n\nI gave birth there in secret.\n\n08:56\n\nI was scared that she might cry, and couldn't\n\nhang her swaddling clothes outside.\n\n09:03\n\nIf my daughter's cries were heard,\n\nthey'd have been sure to catch me.\n\n09:09\n\nI had to let her go.\n\n09:14\n\nAt the time, Zhou had already given birth to 4 other daughters.\n\n09:21\n\nIn this region, families bearing a child illegally were fined 3.5 times their yearly income,\n\n09:28\n\nwith further births subjected to a fine twice as large.\n\n09:35\n\nI didn't even make US $1,300 a year,\n\nand the charge was several times that.\n\n09:40\n\nWe barely had the money to eat.\n\n09:44\n\nWhen I gave birth to her,\n\nI was terribly poor.\n\n09:49\n\nAs punishment they'd demolished my home,\n\nand taken my food and crops.\n\n09:52\n\nThey'd even taken my pigs.\n\n09:56\n\nIf they'd found out again...\n\n09:59\n\nI'd have been forced to undergo sterilization\n\nso that I couldn't have more.\n\n10:06\n\nWhy did you keep having children?\n\n10:09\n\nThis is a farming village.\n\n10:12\n\nWe need a male heir to carry on\n\nour household.\n\n10:18\n\nProsperity of descendants\n\nis set in stone here.\n\n10:32\n\nZhou runs a meat shop in the local marketplace.\n\n10:36\n\nThe year after giving up Feng Yuan, she gave birth to a sixth child, her first son.\n\n10:46\n\nYou have five children here, but you still\n\nwant to search for your daughter?\n\n10:51\n\nOf course any child I gave birth to\n\nis precious to me.\n\n10:57\n\nIf not for the One-Child Policy,\n\nI'd have never given her up.\n\n11:02\n\nNo matter how poor I was, I'd have\n\nfed her before taking a bite of food.\n\n11:08\n\nEven now, when I see a girl my\n\ndaughter's age I focus in on her.\n\n11:15\n\nI unconsciously wonder if it might be her.\n\n11:22\n\nI'd just like to see her once.\n\n11:27\n\nI don't mind if she won't accept me\n\nas her mother.\n\n11:34\n\nAfter hearing Zhou's account, Long considers it likely that her daughter may be living overseas.\n\n11:41\n\nShe obtains a swab of saliva from Zhou's son to use in DNA testing.\n\n11:51\n\nPlease, do anything you can\n\nto find my daughter.\n\n11:59\n\nThis is Hunan.\n\n12:02\n\nThis is Anhui.\n\n12:11\n\nLong lives in Utah, with her husband Brian Stuy.\n\n12:18\n\nAlthough they have no biological children together, they've adopted and raised 3 girls from China.\n\n12:25\n\nEventually, their daughters asked things like,\n\n12:29\n\n\"Who are my birth parents?\"\n\n12:31\n\nand \"Why was I given up?\"\n\n12:34\n\nBeginning with these questions, they commenced their activities connecting children with their birth parents.\n\n12:43\n\nThey've utilized DNA testing to reunite nearly 300 children with their original families.\n\n12:54\n\nWe wanted to kind of just touch base on progress.\n\n12:59\n\nSo if we wanted to spend a couple minutes with you, is this good?\n\n13:04\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\n13:07\n\nMost recently, they identified this woman's parents.\n\n13:12\n\nWhile living in America, she had long held the wish to find her biological parents in China.\n\n13:20\n\nAnd so we tested the sister, and her results came in on Friday.\n\n13:25\n\nOkay? And she's a match to you, Grace. She's your birth sister.\n\n13:33\n\nOh my gosh.\n\n13:34\n\nYeah. It's astounding.\n\n13:38\n\nI found my birth sister.\n\n13:45\n\nOh my gosh.\n\n13:49\n\nShe sort of looks like me.\n\n13:50\n\nYeah, she looks like you.\n\n13:52\n\nShe's pretty though.\n\n13:55\n\nMy name is Grace Romig, I'm 20 years old.\n\n13:59\n\nI was adopted from Maoming, Guangdong.\n\n14:03\n\nA female was abandoned in front of 32 South Guandu Road, Maoming City on 1/27/2002.\n\n14:09\n\nAccording to the policeman, the child was in a set of light blue and pink cloth wearing a pink woolen hat and wrapped in a child's blanket.\n\n14:16\n\nLying in a paper box quietly.\n\n14:18\n\nThe umbilical cord was clean and still attached.\n\n14:21\n\nAfter failing to find family members, the police station sent her to the Maoming Social welfare Institute of Custody on the day.\n\n14:30\n\nWhen Grace was 10 months old, her future adoptive mother visited China.\n\n14:39\n\nThis video shows the first time they met.\n\n14:45\n\nThere's Grace, there's May May.\n\n14:50\n\nJust staring at me like, \"what the heck are you?\"\n\n15:00\n\nBeth Romig adopted Grace when she was 44.\n\n15:04\n\nUnmarried but wanting children, she applied to the Chinese International Adoption program.\n\n15:14\n\nWhile working as a nurse, Beth also has raised her other adopted daughter, Jenna.\n\n15:22\n\nShe always cried and she always cried about her birth family.\n\n15:27\n\nShe looked for people who look like her,\n\n15:30\n\nand even when we were out in public in the States and she would see other Asians, usually, she'd say you know,\n\n15:36\n\n\"Oh there's my mom! There's my sister!\"\n\n15:38\n\nBut then she would say, \"they really don't look like me.\"\n\n15:43\n\nAlthough raised in America, Grace never stopped wondering about her parents in China.\n\n15:50\n\nTo help Beth, she works part-time in a used clothing store.\n\n15:56\n\nI was a person who wasn't like, born and raised in America.\n\n16:02\n\nIt did feel a little bit isolating and something.\n\n16:06\n\nMy background, and this is the life I live now, and I don't know my birth parents,\n\n16:10\n\nI don't know... I haven't yet considered if they didn't want to meet me, but I know that, that is a possible occurrence.\n\n16:19\n\nFinding my birth parents would mean the world to me because I'd love to learn more about them and their life\n\n16:26\n\nbecause like everyone else - they're people - and they have their own stories and reasons why they had to do something.\n\n16:39\n\nIn some ways, even though they've been welcomed into the family and into the community,\n\n16:45\n\nI don't think they feel comfortable.\n\n16:49\n\nAnd how much more of just the abandonment part is always in there.\n\n16:56\n\nWhen you see aspects that they aren't happy, it's very difficult.\n\n17:02\n\nAnd sometimes there's nothing you can do about it.\n\n17:09\n\nGrace finding her family is perhaps bringing some resolution to the \"not being wanted.\"\n\n17:17\n\nI hope that if she continues to explore this, she'll realize that she was wanted.\n\n17:24\n\nIn China, Grace's parents are notified that their daughter has been found at last.\n\n17:31\n\nThree months later, Grace goes to meet her birth parents for the first time.\n\n17:49\n\nThis is Wuchuan, a small town in Guangdong Province.\n\n18:01\n\nWhy bother to film this?\n\n18:05\n\nI'm worried my daughter will see\n\nhow dirty I get.\n\n18:12\n\nShe might not want to come back.\n\n18:19\n\nYang Yagui is a day laborer who works in construction sites there.\n\n18:26\n\nHe's confirmed to be Grace's biological father.\n\n18:31\n\nI've worked since I was 18,\n\nand have to keep on working.\n\n18:38\n\nWhat can I do? I need money\n\nto feed my children.\n\n18:45\n\nFood and water cost money.\n\n18:51\n\nYang lives together with his wife, Chen Xuandi.\n\n18:55\n\nFor 21 years, they've wondered what became of their daughter.\n\n19:03\n\nI thought about where she lives,\n\nand if she's going to school.\n\n19:08\n\nAll this time, I'd hoped that\n\nshe's doing well.\n\n19:13\n\nI had no idea she was so far away,\n\nin America.\n\n19:18\n\nThe food and education system there\n\nare better than in China.\n\n19:24\n\nIt's a land of abundance, after all.\n\n19:29\n\nYang has in fact never once seen his daughter's face.\n\n19:37\n\nWhile he was out working, his mother gave Grace away without so much as asking him.\n\n19:46\n\nMy mother was here when my daughter was born.\n\n19:52\n\nShe decided to give her away.\n\n19:57\n\nShe'd wanted a grandson.\n\n20:07\n\nIn this town, families without sons\n\ncarry no status.\n\n20:13\n\nThe more male heirs, the more\n\nstatus a family carries.\n\n20:23\n\nAt the time Grace was born, Yang and his wife already had a 10-year-old son.\n\n20:31\n\nHoping to gain another son, they opposed the Policy by having three more children, but all of them were girls.\n\n20:43\n\nThe One-Child Policy was strict.\n\n20:46\n\nWhenever an official came by,\n\nwe had to shut the door and hide.\n\n20:51\n\nWe had our door broken in so many times.\n\n21:00\n\nThey used a log to bust it.\n\n21:04\n\nI was caught twice, my wife three times.\n\n21:08\n\nWe were taken away and locked up.\n\n21:15\n\nWe couldn't get out unless we paid.\n\n21:19\n\nIt was terrifying.\n\n21:26\n\nTogether, they paid a fine of around 3 times their yearly income.\n\n21:33\n\nAfter using up the money they'd saved away with migrant labor, their finances were pushed to the limit.\n\n21:43\n\nBut Yang's mother still insisted on them having another son.\n\n21:50\n\nInstead, Grace was brought into the world.\n\n21:57\n\nWith three daughters already, my mother\n\nwouldn't let her stay.\n\n22:04\n\nMy wife couldn't speak up\n\nagainst her mother-in-law.\n\n22:12\n\nI was heartbroken.\n\n22:18\n\nYang's brother and his wife recall that after giving birth to so many girls, Chen was looked down upon.\n\n22:27\n\nMy mother insisted on having sons.\n\n22:31\n\nWhen the first child was a boy,\n\nmy mother-in-law was very happy.\n\n22:36\n\nBut after several granddaughters,\n\nshe began acting colder.\n\n22:42\n\nWeren't you upset with her?\n\n22:49\n\nShe had no place to complain.\n\n22:52\n\nShe just had to accept it.\n\n22:59\n\nI don't know how to feel about it.\n\n23:04\n\nI missed my daughter so much.\n\n23:08\n\nWith how strict the policy was,\n\nwe had trouble getting by.\n\n23:13\n\nI thought my daughter might be\n\nhappier away from this poverty.\n\n23:19\n\nWhat would you talk about with her?\n\n23:23\n\nI don't know.\n\n23:26\n\nI can't understand English.\n\n23:37\n\nMy daughter's coming back home\n\nto see us, her birth parents.\n\n23:47\n\nPlease let her have a safe trip.\n\n24:03\n\nAfter a 22-hour flight from the U.S., Grace arrives in the country where she was born.\n\n24:15\n\nHer adoptive mother Beth and younger sister Jenna accompany her.\n\n24:23\n\nWuchuan is a 3-hour ride from Guangzhou by high-speed train.\n\n24:29\n\nI got this secondhand at a store in my community I think.\n\n24:33\n\nI got it within the last couple weeks, and I chose to wear it today because red in China means good luck.\n\n24:41\n\nAnd everybody - it just doesn't seem real; it doesn't seem like it's actually happening.\n\n24:47\n\nI'm looking forward to when I get to see my parents face-to-face, see their reactions, and I'm probably going to cry.\n\n25:02\n\nOur whole extended family is coming.\n\n25:08\n\nWe'll hold a welcome party.\n\n25:10\n\nWe'll light firecrackers to celebrate\n\nthe occasion.\n\n25:17\n\nIt's a tradition here in Guangdong.\n\n25:25\n\nGrace's mother puts on a new pair of shoes, to greet her for the first time in 21 years.\n\n25:33\n\nAll of her sisters are here.\n\n25:42\n\nYang's second daughter Yang Tudi works in Guangzhou.\n\n25:47\n\nShe was the one who provided the sample for DNA testing.\n\n25:56\n\nNaturally, Long Stuy also joined them to witness the fruits of her efforts.\n\n26:07\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\n26:12\n\nMom is crying.\n\n26:20\n\nYou're about to see her.\n\n26:22\n\nThat's right.\n\n26:32\n\nFinally, the time has come for a reunion more than 2 decades in the making.\n\n26:41\n\nJust nervous being in a new place and nervous, I guess like, what they'll expect of me.\n\n26:49\n\nI'd be worried that they would have high expectations for me.\n\n26:52\n\nI'm worried about coming back home, and like, interrupting them from what they are doing.\n\n27:10\n\nGrace's parents and siblings all wait to meet her.\n\n27:20\n\nDespite their anticipation, her parents are nervous as well.\n\n27:27\n\nI hope she isn't angry at us.\n\n27:31\n\nAbout why we gave her up.\n\n27:35\n\nI'm scared that she'll ask.\n\n28:07\n\nWatch your step, dear.\n\n28:28\n\nWelcome home.\n\n28:42\n\nThis is our mom and dad.\n\n28:50\n\nAnd our big brother.\n\n28:58\n\nDon't cry. Don't cry, dear.\n\n29:18\n\nMama, thank you.\n\n29:21\n\nShe is my gift from you to me.\n\n29:28\n\nIt says, \"Welcome back home.\"\n\n29:35\n\nWelcome back home!\n\n29:49\n\nFor the long-awaited reunion, the family prepared an array of special dishes.\n\n29:57\n\nIncluding friends and extended relatives, around 70 people gather to celebrate.\n\n30:07\n\nIt's the family's first dinner together with Grace.\n\n30:12\n\nI feel like every moment with them, I felt accepted and welcomed by them.\n\n30:17\n\nWhen it's time to eat, they wanted me to be full and eat more food.\n\n30:22\n\nThey just care about every little thing about me, and I feel that love.\n\n30:32\n\nThe biggest surprise I think was the family's reaction to us.\n\n30:37\n\nWe, in America, we've always heard that girls are not appreciated,\n\n30:42\n\nand the way he welcomed Grace was totally opposite as to what we have always heard in America.\n\n30:52\n\nHow much did you spend on the party?\n\n30:55\n\nAround $4,000 for the evening.\n\n31:00\n\nWith our daughter coming home,\n\nwe were happy to spend it.\n\n31:05\n\nWe borrowed it from relatives\n\nto make her feel welcomed.\n\n31:14\n\nA new week together begins after 2 decades apart.\n\n31:27\n\nGrace's birth mother and father seek to make up for their absence.\n\n31:35\n\nAlthough hesitantly, Grace poses a serious question to them.\n\n31:43\n\nIf I was their son instead of a daughter, would grandmother have kept me in the family?\n\n31:57\n\nI see. That's a hard question.\n\n32:02\n\n- If she'd been a son?\n\n- What'd she ask?\n\n32:10\n\nIf she'd been a boy, I'm sure that\n\nmy mother wouldn't have given her up.\n\n32:14\n\nIt was just because she was a girl.\n\n32:17\n\nThey said that if you were a boy,\n\nyour grandmother would have kept you.\n\n32:30\n\nDoes she feel that we abandoned her?\n\n32:37\n\nThe truth is that we wanted to keep\n\nour daughter.\n\n32:45\n\nAt the time Grace was born, Yang had been away for migrant labor in Shenzhen.\n\n32:52\n\nHe returned as soon as he heard the news, but by the time he arrived, his mother had already given up their daughter.\n\n33:05\n\nNo matter how he pleaded, his mother refused to tell where the infant had been sent.\n\n33:13\n\nI asked with different midwives\n\ntrying to get her back.\n\n33:21\n\nWhen I didn't find her that day,\n\nI searched the next.\n\n33:27\n\nI kept on searching for days.\n\n33:35\n\nIn the end, Yang was unable to regain his daughter.\n\n33:43\n\nWithout even seeing her face or giving her a name, the years passed.\n\n33:54\n\nIf not for the One-Child Policy,\n\nI'd gladly have raised many children.\n\n34:01\n\nBut we couldn't afford the fines,\n\nso my mother gave her up.\n\n34:06\n\nThere was nothing I could do.\n\n34:11\n\nUnder pressure from both the Policy and his mother, Yang finally accepted the fate.\n\n34:20\n\nI'm so sorry that despite being her father,\n\nI couldn't raise her.\n\n34:34\n\nYes yes, I understand.\n\n34:38\n\nI know, I know it's not anyone's fault.\n\n34:40\n\nI know it's not anyone's fault.\n\n34:49\n\nThis is the old house where\n\nmy grandparents lived.\n\n35:05\n\nThis is our grandpa and grandma.\n\n35:09\n\nI think our grandma is very beautiful.\n\n35:13\n\nGrace's grandmother passed away last year at age 85.\n\n35:18\n\nHer older sister Tudi says that despite her grandmother's actions, she couldn't blame her.\n\n35:27\n\nOur grandmother may have given you away,\n\nbut she was very good to us.\n\n36:05\n\nwhile their grandmother contributed her savings.\n\n36:11\n\nI'm very grateful to her.\n\n36:15\n\nSo I want you to forgive her.\n\n36:19\n\nShe was very good to our dad\n\nbecause she knows he is very kind.\n\n36:27\n\nDo you think you can forgive her?\n\n36:30\n\nYes, I still care about her, and I wish I could have met her in China, too.\n\n36:46\n\nGrace has cried a lot, I feel happy for her because she has found something she's been looking for, for so long.\n\n36:58\n\nBeth recognizes the complex emotions growing within her daughter.\n\n37:06\n\nWell she wants to be here to help them but she also doesn't want to leave me.\n\n37:12\n\nIf she were to move, she says, \"I don't want to leave you alone, I need to take care of you.\"\n\n37:19\n\nIt's a big adjustment to make, it's a big change in her life.\n\n37:25\n\nIf she needs to do what she needs to do, I would support her.\n\n37:34\n\nYour aunt is here.\n\n37:37\n\nWhat do you say?\n\n37:41\n\nHello.\n\n37:50\n\nOn the previous nights, Grace had been staying with Beth in a hotel.\n\n37:57\n\nTonight, she'll spend the night at her family's home for the first time.\n\n38:04\n\nYou can put your bag on the bed.\n\n38:10\n\nBeth wasn't unhappy about this?\n\n38:20\n\nI want to stay here because it's like, how they grew up and I haven't grown up here,\n\n38:27\n\nso it's like, I need different time of the day spending time here and want to live here at all different times in the day.\n\n38:36\n\nGrace has finally gotten a taste of life together with her birth parents.\n\n38:45\n\nThat night, her father makes an unexpected statement.\n\n38:52\n\nPlease tell my daughter.\n\n38:56\n\nIt's best for her to return to the US\n\nto focus on her work and study.\n\n39:02\n\nWe want that for her.\n\n39:06\n\nAmerica is a rich nation,\n\nand we're very poor.\n\n39:14\n\nYou want her to live in America?\n\n39:21\n\nIt's best for her standard of life.\n\n39:25\n\nThere are 3,000 people here,\n\nand they all look down on us.\n\n39:31\n\nWe're just so poor.\n\n39:35\n\nIf she wanted to live here,\n\nit'd be different than in America.\n\n39:44\n\nGrace hears of her father's wishes.\n\n39:50\n\nI would stay with them anywhere they are because that what matters. Because we're family.\n\n39:55\n\nThey had to give up a child not knowing where I was,\n\n40:00\n\nbecause I feel like that would be very difficult and especially because my mom had to go back to work and then my dad didn't know,\n\n40:08\n\nso that makes me feel sad for them, because I think they had it more difficult than me.\n\n40:20\n\nBut I wanna take care of them.\n\n40:25\n\nI don't want them to have to work forever.\n\n40:49\n\nAs long as I'm with my family that's all that matters.\n\n40:54\n\nI'll work on their farm and do anything to help make them money.\n\n41:06\n\nI want to let them know that like,\n\n41:08\n\nI'm not embarrassed and I don't care what other people think if they think more like...\n\n41:15\n\nlike they're less than anyone else.\n\n41:18\n\nBecause it's not true.\n\n41:26\n\nIt's all right.\n\n41:30\n\nDon't cry.\n\n41:33\n\nWe've grown used to this life,\n\nbut it would be hard for her.\n\n41:40\n\nFarm work is awfully tough.\n\n41:48\n\nYou have a good life in America,\n\nthen we're happy for you.\n\n41:56\n\nWhenever you want to see us,\n\nyou're welcome here.\n\n42:07\n\nBut you should go back for now.\n\n42:39\n\nThe One-Child Policy was abolished in 2015, ending 36 years under its control.\n\n42:49\n\nThe Chinese government now supports population growth,\n\n42:53\n\nand is implementing policies to encourage having multiple children.\n\n43:15\n\nHow did you sleep last night?\n\n43:18\n\nI slept good.\n\n43:19\n\nIt was hot, that bed was really comfortable.\n\n43:28\n\nWhen my mom was washing her clothes out 1 in the morning, and I was sleeping,\n\n43:34\n\nyes, I felt like I was a member of the family.\n\n43:42\n\nThank you.\n\n43:44\n\nSo it felt nice to be included in something that I missed in the past.\n\n44:07\n\nGrace's time spent with her family now draws to an end.\n\n44:27\n\nI have something for my daughter.\n\n44:35\n\nYang takes out all of the money he has available, around 300 dollars.\n\n44:45\n\nNo, no. No, please.\n\n44:48\n\nFor our daughter.\n\n44:51\n\nNo.\n\n44:52\n\nIt's for her tuition.\n\n44:56\n\nWhat does he say?\n\n44:58\n\nPlease send her to school.\n\n45:01\n\nIt's for her good.\n\n45:06\n\nI want her to be kind to Beth.\n\n45:15\n\nI can't express my thanks to her\n\nfor raising my daughter.\n\n45:24\n\nI love them both the same, like no more than the other.\n\n45:29\n\nYeah, I want it to be one without the other.\n\n45:32\n\nI couldn't live with my mom if they did not give me life.\n\n45:35\n\nAnd, I wouldn't have the life I have today without my mom.\n\n45:45\n\nSo she can come back.\n\n45:51\n\nThank you.\n\n45:59\n\nBe well.\n\n46:18\n\nDon't cry.\n\n46:36\n\nAfter 21 years of separation...\n\n46:42\n\nOnce again, their daughter will cross the ocean to a faraway land.\n\n46:52\n\nOf course, I didn't want her to leave.\n\n46:58\n\nBut she has her home there.\n\n47:06\n\nShe has a bright future.\n\n47:18\n\nI missed 21 years spending time with them,\n\n47:22\n\nbut it definitely helps a lot knowing that they're there for me\n\n47:28\n\nand support me in everything I do and want the best for me.\n\n47:38\n\nI see how hard they worked to send my two sisters to university to show there is a better life for them,\n\n47:46\n\nand I just want to have a better life for myself so I can give it back to them.\n\n47:57\n\nGrace's parents give her the Chinese name that she should have received at the birth.\n\n48:10\n\nYang Siqing.\n\n48:12\n\nIt represents the wish for their daughter to live a pure and beautiful life.\n\n48:25\n\nThe newly named Yang Siqing has decided that by the time they next meet,"
