00:01

I've been searching for my daughter

for 18 years.

00:06

I only held her once.

00:09

What's her name?

00:11

I hadn't given her one.

00:12

Your biological daughter?

00:15

Of course.

00:17

His father gave her up without

our consent.

00:23

My father wanted a grandson,

so he just gave her away.

00:27

I've never stopped searching.

In the winter, I can't sleep.

00:31

Our daughter was born in the winter.

The sadness eats away at me.

00:36

It's turned my hair gray.

00:40

The One-Child Policy was harsh.

00:44

A lifelong nightmare.

00:47

Nothing could make me forget

our daughter.

00:52

Even just once, I'd like to see her again.

00:57

I won't give up. Why were we forced

to give her away?

01:22

China's Jiangxi Province.

01:24

Under 38-degree heat, one woman traverses the city streets.

01:29

Do you know anyone who gave up

their daughter?

01:35

Do you know anyone who gave up

their daughter?

01:41

Do you know anyone who gave up

their daughter?

01:44

You might as well look for stars in the sky.

01:50

Long Stuy is carrying out a nationwide search after coming here from America.

01:59

Her goal is to find the parents of a number of children.

02:03

All of them were sent overseas for adoption and separated from their birth parents.

02:10

There are so many people searching for

their parents.

02:15

They've asked me to look for them.

02:19

That must be like hunting a needle

in a haystack.

02:24

It happened to many children

in that era.

02:29

In China, one system was responsible for separating countless children from their parents.

02:37

The One-Child Policy.

02:40

Created to curb overpopulation, it spanned the 36 years from 1979 to 2015.

02:50

Calling women of fertile age.

02:55

When you hear this announcement,

please go for a pregnancy test.

03:02

The nationwide policy set a general limit of a single child per married couple.

03:11

Farming villages in particular held a strong culture of valuing male heirs over females,

03:19

which they regarded as preserving the family lineage.

03:23

Many families continued to have children until a son was born, intending to give up their daughters.

03:31

Those who violated the policy

had to pay a large fine.

03:36

Many parents grappled with how to hide

the birth of their daughters.

03:42

The result was many of them being

given to orphanages.

03:49

They would be sent overseas for adoption.

03:57

Through international adoption, it's estimated that 150,000 children were relocated to various parts of the world.

04:12

These are all documents for people

searching for their birth parents.

04:21

This girl's birth name was Guang Fuyan.

She was sent to an orphanage in Jiangxi.

04:29

Her English name is Mikayla.

04:45

My name is Makayla from Blackstone, Massachusetts.

04:49

I'm senior at UMass Amherst, and I'm currently studying anthropology.

04:54

I was adopted when I was 9 months old from China at the Guangcheng Welfare Institute.

05:01

In my whole town, like, not even just like Chinese or Asian but just like non-white people in general,

05:07

and so I just remember, like wanting to fit in so bad, and wanted to be like everybody else,

05:12

I wanted blonde hair and blue eyes, and I just wanted to not look so different from everybody else.

05:19

I obviously wanna find my birth parents that's why...

05:22

Even the smallest bit of information about like, my history or who my family, my biological family is, anything like that,

05:31

for me, it's super meaningful and important because I just feel like my whole life has just been like missing something.

05:42

Long set out on a journey on Mikayla's behalf, to locate her biological parents.

05:48

I'm looking for someone named Lai Xiaohua

in the town of Yiqian.

05:56

That should be the person who

found her abandoned.

06:03

Long's only clue in this search is the document that was submitted from the orphanage.

06:10

"Early on the morning of May 30th 2001,

local government officials Lai Xiaohua and Tang Mingliang of Yiqian

06:19

found a recently born girl and delivered her to the orphanage."

06:29

Do you know Lai Xiaohua?

06:35

There are tons of people with that name

around here.

06:39

That many?

06:41

It's a very common name here.

06:45

Try asking the local government office.

06:52

Long tries her luck there.

06:56

I've never heard of someone called

Lai Xiaohua working here.

07:02

No Tang Mingliang, either.

07:04

Apparently they were officials here.

07:08

You're sure that you don't know a

Tang Mingliang?

07:14

All the Tangs here are related,

but I don't know a Mingliang.

07:18

It's true.

07:22

Her search for the two town officials fails to turn up any leads.

07:30

With the enormous number of children who were sent to orphanages at the time,

07:34

she thinks that the names may have been recorded carelessly.

07:40

This sort of thing happens

all the time.

07:46

But with nothing else to go off of,

we can only rely on the document.

08:02

She drives another 2 hours from Yiqian.

08:05

This visit is based on information of a woman regretting giving up her daughter.

08:12

I've been searching for a long time,

without any luck.

08:19

Zhou Xiaofang is 50 years old.

08:22

She gave up her daughter in the winter of 2001.

08:28

Holding the meaning of living a content life, Zhou had named her Feng Yuan,

08:34

but she was forced to surrender her soon after birth.

08:37

Where did you give birth?

08:42

In an old clay and tile home.

08:46

Because the policy was so strict,

I gave birth there in secret.

08:56

I was scared that she might cry, and couldn't

hang her swaddling clothes outside.

09:03

If my daughter's cries were heard,

they'd have been sure to catch me.

09:09

I had to let her go.

09:14

At the time, Zhou had already given birth to 4 other daughters.

09:21

In this region, families bearing a child illegally were fined 3.5 times their yearly income,

09:28

with further births subjected to a fine twice as large.

09:35

I didn't even make US $1,300 a year,

and the charge was several times that.

09:40

We barely had the money to eat.

09:44

When I gave birth to her,

I was terribly poor.

09:49

As punishment they'd demolished my home,

and taken my food and crops.

09:52

They'd even taken my pigs.

09:56

If they'd found out again...

09:59

I'd have been forced to undergo sterilization

so that I couldn't have more.

10:06

Why did you keep having children?

10:09

This is a farming village.

10:12

We need a male heir to carry on

our household.

10:18

Prosperity of descendants

is set in stone here.

10:32

Zhou runs a meat shop in the local marketplace.

10:36

The year after giving up Feng Yuan, she gave birth to a sixth child, her first son.

10:46

You have five children here, but you still

want to search for your daughter?

10:51

Of course any child I gave birth to

is precious to me.

10:57

If not for the One-Child Policy,

I'd have never given her up.

11:02

No matter how poor I was, I'd have

fed her before taking a bite of food.

11:08

Even now, when I see a girl my

daughter's age I focus in on her.

11:15

I unconsciously wonder if it might be her.

11:22

I'd just like to see her once.

11:27

I don't mind if she won't accept me

as her mother.

11:34

After hearing Zhou's account, Long considers it likely that her daughter may be living overseas.

11:41

She obtains a swab of saliva from Zhou's son to use in DNA testing.

11:51

Please, do anything you can

to find my daughter.

11:59

This is Hunan.

12:02

This is Anhui.

12:11

Long lives in Utah, with her husband Brian Stuy.

12:18

Although they have no biological children together, they've adopted and raised 3 girls from China.

12:25

Eventually, their daughters asked things like,

12:29

"Who are my birth parents?"

12:31

and "Why was I given up?"

12:34

Beginning with these questions, they commenced their activities connecting children with their birth parents.

12:43

They've utilized DNA testing to reunite nearly 300 children with their original families.

12:54

We wanted to kind of just touch base on progress.

12:59

So if we wanted to spend a couple minutes with you, is this good?

13:04

Yeah, yeah.

13:07

Most recently, they identified this woman's parents.

13:12

While living in America, she had long held the wish to find her biological parents in China.

13:20

And so we tested the sister, and her results came in on Friday.

13:25

Okay? And she's a match to you, Grace. She's your birth sister.

13:33

Oh my gosh.

13:34

Yeah. It's astounding.

13:38

I found my birth sister.

13:45

Oh my gosh.

13:49

She sort of looks like me.

13:50

Yeah, she looks like you.

13:52

She's pretty though.

13:55

My name is Grace Romig, I'm 20 years old.

13:59

I was adopted from Maoming, Guangdong.

14:03

A female was abandoned in front of 32 South Guandu Road, Maoming City on 1/27/2002.

14:09

According to the policeman, the child was in a set of light blue and pink cloth wearing a pink woolen hat and wrapped in a child's blanket.

14:16

Lying in a paper box quietly.

14:18

The umbilical cord was clean and still attached.

14:21

After failing to find family members, the police station sent her to the Maoming Social welfare Institute of Custody on the day.

14:30

When Grace was 10 months old, her future adoptive mother visited China.

14:39

This video shows the first time they met.

14:45

There's Grace, there's May May.

14:50

Just staring at me like, "what the heck are you?"

15:00

Beth Romig adopted Grace when she was 44.

15:04

Unmarried but wanting children, she applied to the Chinese International Adoption program.

15:14

While working as a nurse, Beth also has raised her other adopted daughter, Jenna.

15:22

She always cried and she always cried about her birth family.

15:27

She looked for people who look like her,

15:30

and even when we were out in public in the States and she would see other Asians, usually, she'd say you know,

15:36

"Oh there's my mom! There's my sister!"

15:38

But then she would say, "they really don't look like me."

15:43

Although raised in America, Grace never stopped wondering about her parents in China.

15:50

To help Beth, she works part-time in a used clothing store.

15:56

I was a person who wasn't like, born and raised in America.

16:02

It did feel a little bit isolating and something.

16:06

My background, and this is the life I live now, and I don't know my birth parents,

16:10

I don't know... I haven't yet considered if they didn't want to meet me, but I know that, that is a possible occurrence.

16:19

Finding my birth parents would mean the world to me because I'd love to learn more about them and their life

16:26

because like everyone else - they're people - and they have their own stories and reasons why they had to do something.

16:39

In some ways, even though they've been welcomed into the family and into the community,

16:45

I don't think they feel comfortable.

16:49

And how much more of just the abandonment part is always in there.

16:56

When you see aspects that they aren't happy, it's very difficult.

17:02

And sometimes there's nothing you can do about it.

17:09

Grace finding her family is perhaps bringing some resolution to the "not being wanted."

17:17

I hope that if she continues to explore this, she'll realize that she was wanted.

17:24

In China, Grace's parents are notified that their daughter has been found at last.

17:31

Three months later, Grace goes to meet her birth parents for the first time.

17:49

This is Wuchuan, a small town in Guangdong Province.

18:01

Why bother to film this?

18:05

I'm worried my daughter will see

how dirty I get.

18:12

She might not want to come back.

18:19

Yang Yagui is a day laborer who works in construction sites there.

18:26

He's confirmed to be Grace's biological father.

18:31

I've worked since I was 18,

and have to keep on working.

18:38

What can I do? I need money

to feed my children.

18:45

Food and water cost money.

18:51

Yang lives together with his wife, Chen Xuandi.

18:55

For 21 years, they've wondered what became of their daughter.

19:03

I thought about where she lives,

and if she's going to school.

19:08

All this time, I'd hoped that

she's doing well.

19:13

I had no idea she was so far away,

in America.

19:18

The food and education system there

are better than in China.

19:24

It's a land of abundance, after all.

19:29

Yang has in fact never once seen his daughter's face.

19:37

While he was out working, his mother gave Grace away without so much as asking him.

19:46

My mother was here when my daughter was born.

19:52

She decided to give her away.

19:57

She'd wanted a grandson.

20:07

In this town, families without sons

carry no status.

20:13

The more male heirs, the more

status a family carries.

20:23

At the time Grace was born, Yang and his wife already had a 10-year-old son.

20:31

Hoping to gain another son, they opposed the Policy by having three more children, but all of them were girls.

20:43

The One-Child Policy was strict.

20:46

Whenever an official came by,

we had to shut the door and hide.

20:51

We had our door broken in so many times.

21:00

They used a log to bust it.

21:04

I was caught twice, my wife three times.

21:08

We were taken away and locked up.

21:15

We couldn't get out unless we paid.

21:19

It was terrifying.

21:26

Together, they paid a fine of around 3 times their yearly income.

21:33

After using up the money they'd saved away with migrant labor, their finances were pushed to the limit.

21:43

But Yang's mother still insisted on them having another son.

21:50

Instead, Grace was brought into the world.

21:57

With three daughters already, my mother

wouldn't let her stay.

22:04

My wife couldn't speak up

against her mother-in-law.

22:12

I was heartbroken.

22:18

Yang's brother and his wife recall that after giving birth to so many girls, Chen was looked down upon.

22:27

My mother insisted on having sons.

22:31

When the first child was a boy,

my mother-in-law was very happy.

22:36

But after several granddaughters,

she began acting colder.

22:42

Weren't you upset with her?

22:49

She had no place to complain.

22:52

She just had to accept it.

22:59

I don't know how to feel about it.

23:04

I missed my daughter so much.

23:08

With how strict the policy was,

we had trouble getting by.

23:13

I thought my daughter might be

happier away from this poverty.

23:19

What would you talk about with her?

23:23

I don't know.

23:26

I can't understand English.

23:37

My daughter's coming back home

to see us, her birth parents.

23:47

Please let her have a safe trip.

24:03

After a 22-hour flight from the U.S., Grace arrives in the country where she was born.

24:15

Her adoptive mother Beth and younger sister Jenna accompany her.

24:23

Wuchuan is a 3-hour ride from Guangzhou by high-speed train.

24:29

I got this secondhand at a store in my community I think.

24:33

I got it within the last couple weeks, and I chose to wear it today because red in China means good luck.

24:41

And everybody - it just doesn't seem real; it doesn't seem like it's actually happening.

24:47

I'm looking forward to when I get to see my parents face-to-face, see their reactions, and I'm probably going to cry.

25:02

Our whole extended family is coming.

25:08

We'll hold a welcome party.

25:10

We'll light firecrackers to celebrate

the occasion.

25:17

It's a tradition here in Guangdong.

25:25

Grace's mother puts on a new pair of shoes, to greet her for the first time in 21 years.

25:33

All of her sisters are here.

25:42

Yang's second daughter Yang Tudi works in Guangzhou.

25:47

She was the one who provided the sample for DNA testing.

25:56

Naturally, Long Stuy also joined them to witness the fruits of her efforts.

26:07

What's wrong?

26:12

Mom is crying.

26:20

You're about to see her.

26:22

That's right.

26:32

Finally, the time has come for a reunion more than 2 decades in the making.

26:41

Just nervous being in a new place and nervous, I guess like, what they'll expect of me.

26:49

I'd be worried that they would have high expectations for me.

26:52

I'm worried about coming back home, and like, interrupting them from what they are doing.

27:10

Grace's parents and siblings all wait to meet her.

27:20

Despite their anticipation, her parents are nervous as well.

27:27

I hope she isn't angry at us.

27:31

About why we gave her up.

27:35

I'm scared that she'll ask.

28:07

Watch your step, dear.

28:28

Welcome home.

28:42

This is our mom and dad.

28:50

And our big brother.

28:58

Don't cry. Don't cry, dear.

29:18

Mama, thank you.

29:21

She is my gift from you to me.

29:28

It says, "Welcome back home."

29:35

Welcome back home!

29:49

For the long-awaited reunion, the family prepared an array of special dishes.

29:57

Including friends and extended relatives, around 70 people gather to celebrate.

30:07

It's the family's first dinner together with Grace.

30:12

I feel like every moment with them, I felt accepted and welcomed by them.

30:17

When it's time to eat, they wanted me to be full and eat more food.

30:22

They just care about every little thing about me, and I feel that love.

30:32

The biggest surprise I think was the family's reaction to us.

30:37

We, in America, we've always heard that girls are not appreciated,

30:42

and the way he welcomed Grace was totally opposite as to what we have always heard in America.

30:52

How much did you spend on the party?

30:55

Around $4,000 for the evening.

31:00

With our daughter coming home,

we were happy to spend it.

31:05

We borrowed it from relatives

to make her feel welcomed.

31:14

A new week together begins after 2 decades apart.

31:27

Grace's birth mother and father seek to make up for their absence.

31:35

Although hesitantly, Grace poses a serious question to them.

31:43

If I was their son instead of a daughter, would grandmother have kept me in the family?

31:57

I see. That's a hard question.

32:02

- If she'd been a son?

- What'd she ask?

32:10

If she'd been a boy, I'm sure that

my mother wouldn't have given her up.

32:14

It was just because she was a girl.

32:17

They said that if you were a boy,

your grandmother would have kept you.

32:30

Does she feel that we abandoned her?

32:37

The truth is that we wanted to keep

our daughter.

32:45

At the time Grace was born, Yang had been away for migrant labor in Shenzhen.

32:52

He returned as soon as he heard the news, but by the time he arrived, his mother had already given up their daughter.

33:05

No matter how he pleaded, his mother refused to tell where the infant had been sent.

33:13

I asked with different midwives

trying to get her back.

33:21

When I didn't find her that day,

I searched the next.

33:27

I kept on searching for days.

33:35

In the end, Yang was unable to regain his daughter.

33:43

Without even seeing her face or giving her a name, the years passed.

33:54

If not for the One-Child Policy,

I'd gladly have raised many children.

34:01

But we couldn't afford the fines,

so my mother gave her up.

34:06

There was nothing I could do.

34:11

Under pressure from both the Policy and his mother, Yang finally accepted the fate.

34:20

I'm so sorry that despite being her father,

I couldn't raise her.

34:34

Yes yes, I understand.

34:38

I know, I know it's not anyone's fault.

34:40

I know it's not anyone's fault.

34:49

This is the old house where

my grandparents lived.

35:05

This is our grandpa and grandma.

35:09

I think our grandma is very beautiful.

35:13

Grace's grandmother passed away last year at age 85.

35:18

Her older sister Tudi says that despite her grandmother's actions, she couldn't blame her.

35:27

Our grandmother may have given you away,

but she was very good to us.

36:05

while their grandmother contributed her savings.

36:11

I'm very grateful to her.

36:15

So I want you to forgive her.

36:19

She was very good to our dad

because she knows he is very kind.

36:27

Do you think you can forgive her?

36:30

Yes, I still care about her, and I wish I could have met her in China, too.

36:46

Grace has cried a lot, I feel happy for her because she has found something she's been looking for, for so long.

36:58

Beth recognizes the complex emotions growing within her daughter.

37:06

Well she wants to be here to help them but she also doesn't want to leave me.

37:12

If she were to move, she says, "I don't want to leave you alone, I need to take care of you."

37:19

It's a big adjustment to make, it's a big change in her life.

37:25

If she needs to do what she needs to do, I would support her.

37:34

Your aunt is here.

37:37

What do you say?

37:41

Hello.

37:50

On the previous nights, Grace had been staying with Beth in a hotel.

37:57

Tonight, she'll spend the night at her family's home for the first time.

38:04

You can put your bag on the bed.

38:10

Beth wasn't unhappy about this?

38:20

I want to stay here because it's like, how they grew up and I haven't grown up here,

38:27

so it's like, I need different time of the day spending time here and want to live here at all different times in the day.

38:36

Grace has finally gotten a taste of life together with her birth parents.

38:45

That night, her father makes an unexpected statement.

38:52

Please tell my daughter.

38:56

It's best for her to return to the US

to focus on her work and study.

39:02

We want that for her.

39:06

America is a rich nation,

and we're very poor.

39:14

You want her to live in America?

39:21

It's best for her standard of life.

39:25

There are 3,000 people here,

and they all look down on us.

39:31

We're just so poor.

39:35

If she wanted to live here,

it'd be different than in America.

39:44

Grace hears of her father's wishes.

39:50

I would stay with them anywhere they are because that what matters. Because we're family.

39:55

They had to give up a child not knowing where I was,

40:00

because I feel like that would be very difficult and especially because my mom had to go back to work and then my dad didn't know,

40:08

so that makes me feel sad for them, because I think they had it more difficult than me.

40:20

But I wanna take care of them.

40:25

I don't want them to have to work forever.

40:49

As long as I'm with my family that's all that matters.

40:54

I'll work on their farm and do anything to help make them money.

41:06

I want to let them know that like,

41:08

I'm not embarrassed and I don't care what other people think if they think more like...

41:15

like they're less than anyone else.

41:18

Because it's not true.

41:26

It's all right.

41:30

Don't cry.

41:33

We've grown used to this life,

but it would be hard for her.

41:40

Farm work is awfully tough.

41:48

You have a good life in America,

then we're happy for you.

41:56

Whenever you want to see us,

you're welcome here.

42:07

But you should go back for now.

42:39

The One-Child Policy was abolished in 2015, ending 36 years under its control.

42:49

The Chinese government now supports population growth,

42:53

and is implementing policies to encourage having multiple children.

43:15

How did you sleep last night?

43:18

I slept good.

43:19

It was hot, that bed was really comfortable.

43:28

When my mom was washing her clothes out 1 in the morning, and I was sleeping,

43:34

yes, I felt like I was a member of the family.

43:42

Thank you.

43:44

So it felt nice to be included in something that I missed in the past.

44:07

Grace's time spent with her family now draws to an end.

44:27

I have something for my daughter.

44:35

Yang takes out all of the money he has available, around 300 dollars.

44:45

No, no. No, please.

44:48

For our daughter.

44:51

No.

44:52

It's for her tuition.

44:56

What does he say?

44:58

Please send her to school.

45:01

It's for her good.

45:06

I want her to be kind to Beth.

45:15

I can't express my thanks to her

for raising my daughter.

45:24

I love them both the same, like no more than the other.

45:29

Yeah, I want it to be one without the other.

45:32

I couldn't live with my mom if they did not give me life.

45:35

And, I wouldn't have the life I have today without my mom.

45:45

So she can come back.

45:51

Thank you.

45:59

Be well.

46:18

Don't cry.

46:36

After 21 years of separation...

46:42

Once again, their daughter will cross the ocean to a faraway land.

46:52

Of course, I didn't want her to leave.

46:58

But she has her home there.

47:06

She has a bright future.

47:18

I missed 21 years spending time with them,

47:22

but it definitely helps a lot knowing that they're there for me

47:28

and support me in everything I do and want the best for me.

47:38

I see how hard they worked to send my two sisters to university to show there is a better life for them,

47:46

and I just want to have a better life for myself so I can give it back to them.

47:57

Grace's parents give her the Chinese name that she should have received at the birth.

48:10

Yang Siqing.

48:12

It represents the wish for their daughter to live a pure and beautiful life.

48:25

The newly named Yang Siqing has decided that by the time they next meet,
