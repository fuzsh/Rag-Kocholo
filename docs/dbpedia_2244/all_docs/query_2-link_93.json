        "text": "News\n\nAngolaâs 2025 limited tender will feature Block 40, Block 25, Block 39 and Block 26 in the Benguela basin as well as Block 22, Block 35, Block 37, Block 38 and Block 36 in the Kwanza basin. Additionally, the country has four onshore blocks available; 11 blocks on permanent offer; and five marginal fields ready for exploration.\n\nNews\n\nThe merger of TGS and PGS forms a powerhouse in the energy sector, enhancing its capabilities to support energy exploration and production on a global scale. This integration will enable the company to leverage a wider pool of technological resources and expertise, significantly boosting its operational efficiency, innovation and customer engagement strategies.Â\n\nNews\n\nThe Italian oil and gas company is working with advisers including Standard Chartered Plc on the possible stake sale, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Eni could sell up to 30% of the business and is drawing interest from other energy companies, including from Asia, the people said.\n\nNews\n\nAngola aims to produce 1.1 MMbopd by 2027, with plans to reach 2 MMbpd in the long-term. At the same time, the country aims to increase the share of natural gas in the energy mix to 25% by 2025, highlighting strategic opportunities for foreign investors and project developers.\n\nNews\n\nAlgeria is stepping up exploration efforts and has made eight large discoveries so far this year, with the aim of raising production to 200 Bcm a year in the short to medium term from 137 Bcm currently.\n\nNews\n\nOn the back of recent investments, exploration and production updates and strong willingness by the government, the Republic of Congo is taking historic measures to ensure its oil and gas industry drives resource monetization and energy access throughout Africa\n\nNews\n\nOil reserves are being consumed faster than theyâre being replaced. If the reserve replacement ratio doesnât improve, supply could fail to meet demand before lower-carbon and new energy solutions mature. Companies rethinking strategies are using infrastructure-led exploration as a digital solution to find economically viable new prospects."
