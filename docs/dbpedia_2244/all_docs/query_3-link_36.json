Gas consumption in the country increases at rapid paces due to active gasification and using gas for heating purposes by retail consumers,” Magzum Mirzagaliyev said.\n\nAccording to him, the company set to elaborating its gas strategy, as per which gas production both from operating and exploration assets will be raised.\n\n“At the moment, growth potential, according to our estimates, could amount to additional 6.7 billion cubic meters of gas per year by 2030, without consideration of large projects - Tengiz, Karachaganak and Kashagan,” he noted.\n\nHe reminded of the launch of three new gas fields last year – Rozhkovskoye in West Kazakhstan region, Aksai Yuzhny in Kyzylorda region, and Vostochnyi Urikhtau in Aktobe region.\n\nIn his words, the introduction of the Improved Model Contract significantly contributed to increasing the gas projects’ attractiveness.\n\nApart from the abovementioned projects, the Gas Strategy includes Central Urikhtau gas field with the production potential at 900 million cubic meters per year, Zapadnaya Prorva and Kalamkas fields with the annual capacity of 1.1 billion cubic meters.\n\nBesides, KMG implements a number of exploration projects which may hugely raise the country’s natural gas output. They are Karaton Podsolevoy and Turgai Paleozoi fields, where exploration well drilling works will be carried out in 2024"
