(CSE:TCF, OTCQB:TRLEF) expects to produce an average of 23,096 MCF (1,000 cubic feet) per day at its South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (SASB) gas field in the #BlackSea during 2024. Based on optimization work at the SASB field to ensure all six drilled and completed wells are able to produce concurrently, the company said it expects to exit 2023 with SASB field production of 15,397 MCF per day. Optimization work includes the addition of a compressor at the Cayagzi #gas process facility to reduce inlet pressure from 125 to 135 pounds per square inch (psi) to 50 to 60 psi and the installation of an artificial lift to reduce water loading in two of the six wells. #TrillionEnergy said to meet its 2024 production guidance, it intends to drill five new sidetracked production wells from existing platforms at the SASB gas field to raise the total number of producing wells to 11.

The number of oil pipelines under construction at that time was 25. This was notably lower than the number of gas pipelines worldwide, as the fossil fuel is more commonly transported via pipelines than crude oil. As reported by Statista still in October 2023, there was a total of 1,869 operational gas pipelines worldwide. Seven pipelines, two of which located in Russia, were retired and China had the largest number of the operational gas pipelines.

Dec 4 (Interfax) - KazMunayGas has put the East Urikhtau field in Kazakhstan's Aktobe region commercially in stream, Kazakhstan's national oil and gas company said in a press release. \"Oil production in Eastern Urikhtau is expected to amount to 89,000 tonnes of oil and about 46 million cubic meters of gas in 2024. As mature oil and gas fields become depleted, the commissioning of this field is of particular importance in terms of increasing hydrocarbon resources to ensure the country's energy security,\" KMG said.\n\n#Pressure_Relief_Valve Market Forecasts Remarkable Growth in the Period 2023–2032 https://lnkd.in/drWZYZ7j The major contributing factor for the rising #demand for valves is emerging economies investing in new industrial projects in the #oil & #gas #industry, water infrastructure, and other industries. Oil & Gas pipeline projects currently under implementation would further increase the sales of the valves. As the industries are expanding businesses across the various sectors, it creates an #opportunity for #instrumentation and #equipment to grow as well.
