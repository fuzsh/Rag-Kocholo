        "text": "On December 21st, the Rozhkovskoye gas condensate field was put into commercial operation in the West Kazakhstan region.\n\nThe Rozhkovskoye field was discovered in 2008. By 2040, the field is expected to produce 14.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 7.1 million tons of condensate. The field is operated by a joint venture which includes Kazakhstan’s national oil and gas company, KazMunayGas (50%), the Hungarian company, MOL Group (27.5%), and the Chinese Sinopec (22.5%). To date, about $534 million has already been invested in the field’s development.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, Alikhan Smailov, who took part in the launch ceremony via teleconference, emphasized the strategic importance of the project, initiated upon the instructions of the Head of State to attract investment in the exploration and development of new gas fields. Smailov added that in the medium term, the launch of several more gas projects is expected in Kazakhstan, including Urikhtau Central (Aktobe region), Western Prorva (Atyrau region), and Kalamkas (Mangistau region).\n\n“Combined, they will provide an increase in production of over 2 billion cubic meters per year. Together with international companies, 12 more promising geological exploration projects are being developed, as well as projects for the additional exploration of existing fields,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nIn his words, the growing needs of the population and industry require not only an increase in gas resources, but also the capacity for its processing.\n\n“The head of state has set the task of increasing commercial gas production to 30 billion cubic meters by 2030. In this regard, new gas processing plants will be built at the Kashagan and Karachaganak fields, as well as in the city of Zhanaozen,” Smailov said."
