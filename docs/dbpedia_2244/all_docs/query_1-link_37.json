The number of oil pipelines under construction at that time was 25. This was notably lower than the number of gas pipelines worldwide, as the fossil fuel is more commonly transported via pipelines than crude oil. As reported by Statista still in October 2023, there was a total of 1,869 operational gas pipelines worldwide. Seven pipelines, two of which located in Russia, were retired and China had the largest number of the operational gas pipelines.

Dec 4 (Interfax) - KazMunayGas has put the East Urikhtau field in Kazakhstan's Aktobe region commercially in stream, Kazakhstan's national oil and gas company said in a press release. \"Oil production in Eastern Urikhtau is expected to amount to 89,000 tonnes of oil and about 46 million cubic meters of gas in 2024. As mature oil and gas fields become depleted, the commissioning of this field is of particular importance in terms of increasing hydrocarbon resources to ensure the country's energy security,\" KMG said.\n\n#Pressure_Relief_Valve Market Forecasts Remarkable Growth in the Period 2023–2032 https://lnkd.in/drWZYZ7j The major contributing factor for the rising #demand for valves is emerging economies investing in new industrial projects in the #oil & #gas #industry, water infrastructure, and other industries. Oil & Gas pipeline projects currently under implementation would further increase the sales of the valves. As the industries are expanding businesses across the various sectors, it creates an #opportunity for #instrumentation and #equipment to grow as well.

Firstly, the cost efficiency offered by these plants is a major driver. The standardized #design, reduced #labour #costs, and #scalability contribute to overall cost savings. Rapid deployment is another factor, as the modular approach allows for faster project timelines and quicker gas production. GazSurf,LLC Pioneer Energy Gas Processing Equipment Pvt. Ltd.

It still remains niche as there is shortage of skilled professionals well versed with skidding and the ability to manage inter-disciplinary teams up against killer deadlines. Will be interesting to see how companies are able to use tech and business process re-engineering to overcome this challenge."
