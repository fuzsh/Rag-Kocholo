        "text": "Article analyzes geopolitics of Kazakhstan, examines how it should look like in accordance with classic geopolitical theory and how it does look in practice, in particular in case of Kazakhstan membership in the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which reflects Kazakh geostrategy in relations with Russia and China as the main factors of stability in Central Asia. Additional value of the article is that it is purely geopolitical while geopolitical method (theory) is usually misunderstood in the discipline of international relations, used rather freely often being confused with realistic paradigm. Also Central Asia as an object of analysis is not in the centre of global academic discourse and any additional study in the field of CA geopolitics broadens understanding of the external and internal political process in the region. The study showed that Kazakh geopolitics is predetermined to be continental, Heartland oriented, because Kazakhstan is located in the closest neighborhood of Russia and is a steppe land with the conservative identity totally different to the one of see powers. Therefore its geopolitical gravitation towards strategic alliance with Moscow is very strong and even more strengthened by its president Nursultan Nazarbayev as a consistent partisan of the Russian geopolitical theory called Eurasism. Kazakhstan membership in EEU, initially initiated by Nazarbayev, supports the idea that geopolitical union with Russia is the essence of Kazakh geostrategy. At the same time Kazakhstan has good relations with China, but they are of secondary importance for Astana in comparison to cooperation with Russia. SCO is a comfortable platform for Kazakhstan to find its place in geopolitical dialogue of Moscow and Beijing. The problem is that nobody knows how Kazakh foreign policy will look like after Nazarbayev leaves the office, but classic geopolitical theory says that geopolitical orientation of Kazakhstan will hardly change in the long run because its conservative land identity is too strong.\n\nThis chapter surveys the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) efforts to influence society in Central Asia within the framework of its ambitious BRI. China has, among other things, invested considerable effort in improving perceptions of the PRC among local public opinions in Central Asian countries and addressing latent Sinophobia and fears of Chinese expansionism. PRC representatives have actively sought to involve local actors from different segments of society (elites, intellectuals, public organizations, civil society, etc.) in reinterpreting shared history and legitimizing the BRI project in the region. From a theoretical perspective, the chapter draws on studies of transnational actors in international relations and the developing field of transnational studies. Specifically, it utilizes the concept of “transnational societal spaces” instead of automatically referring the research to a nation-state. Te concept addresses the sustained ties linked to networks and organizations across national borders. Unlike other studies, which approach PRC initiatives as monocentric, center–periphery endeavors, the chapter proposes to study China’s BRI and its social and cultural aspects as a polycentric effort. This analytical framework provides innovative and unique insights into the processes that are taking place in Central Asia in the fields of academia and civil society as a result of the PRC’s efforts. Furthermore, it draws our attention to the role of domestic structures as they influence the BRI and the PRC’s attempts to exercise soft power in Central Asia. Here I specifically review several concrete “sites” of transnational societal spaces, as well as the “people” and networks connecting them in the cities of Almaty and Tashkent. Te chapter is based on field research in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and discourse analysis carried out between 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe unique physical setting of Uzbekistan, an exposed and dependent location within central Eurasia, invites a geopolitical description, the goal of this essay. The interest of the authors lies in utilizing the concepts of “heartland” and “autarky,” both terms intersecting and reinforcing, along with additional concepts, to portray the contemporary foreign affairs of this newly-independent, centrally-positioned, but vulnerable Islamic country. A common theme throughout will direct to Uzbekistan’s resident liability caused by its isolation, an interior placement within an immense continent that will encourage an eventual dependency erasing its current autonomy. In addition, the authors’ intent will be to test appropriate theories, in this case, as taken from the classical geopolitics model, for bringing deeper insight into international events, those being within the realm of the geopolitics of Uzbekistan. For example, will a heartland motif offer further understanding into the regional setting of Uzbekistan? Does the concept of autarky or self-sufficiency contribute new light into the country’s security? Similar queries will be exhibited to offer the reader a wide assortment of classical geopolitics methodology that will contribute to a deeper study of the regional setting of Uzbekistan and its neighbors."
