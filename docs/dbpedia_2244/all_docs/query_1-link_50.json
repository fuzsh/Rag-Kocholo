Dec 4 (Interfax) - KazMunayGas has put the East Urikhtau field in Kazakhstan's Aktobe region commercially in stream, Kazakhstan's national oil and gas company said in a press release. \"Oil production in Eastern Urikhtau is expected to amount to 89,000 tonnes of oil and about 46 million cubic meters of gas in 2024. As mature oil and gas fields become depleted, the commissioning of this field is of particular importance in terms of increasing hydrocarbon resources to ensure the country's energy security,\" KMG said.\n\nMari Petroleum Company has made a significant contribution to Pakistan's energy sector by integrating new gas reserves from five wells in Sindh into the national gas network. This addition of 3 million metric standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of gas from the Ghazij Gas Field is now being supplied to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). The company has successfully completed testing and production, paving the way for a comprehensive development plan for the Ghazij Gas Field. This plan will soon be submitted to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) for approval. This development is expected to strengthen Pakistan's gas supply and enhance energy security. The integration of new gas reserves is a positive step towards meeting the country's growing energy demands. . . . #GasReserves #PakistanEnergy #MariPetroleum #SNGPL #EnergySecurity #tribunetrends\n\n--Company Update-- Pennpetro Energy PLC announces that oil production more than doubles from their Chalk Talk 1H Well, Texas.

Nigeria has enormous potential to become a regional leader in green hydrogen production. Despite lagging behind other African countries, Nigeria has a robust gas distribution infrastructure and experience in the renewable energy sector, making it well-positioned to accelerate its movement towards utility-scale infrastructure for green hydrogen production. With the country's large oil and gas industry, Nigeria could potentially enter the green hydrogen sector after making entry into blue hydrogen. The explosive growth of dialogues, workshops, and discussions on green hydrogen in Nigeria since early 2023 is a promising sign of the country's readiness for this transition. Let's keep our eyes on Nigeria's potential for green hydrogen production and regional leadership. #GreenHydrogen #RenewableEnergy #Nigeria #Sustainability\n\n\"Excellent and very useful.
