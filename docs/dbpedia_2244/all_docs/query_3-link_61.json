        "text": "The Russian oil and gas sector saw substantial growth in 2022, with a 40.1% increase, reaching a market value of $491,875.1 million. Despite challenges, including global sanctions due to geopolitical tensions, the sector is forecasted to grow further, reaching $556,902.4 million by 2027, marking a 13.2% increase since 2022.\n\nIn 2022, the market’s volume grew marginally by 0.5% to 4,353.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (BoE), with predictions indicating a rise to 4,546.7 million BoE by 2027, a 4.4% increase from 2022. Natural gas remains the dominant segment, representing 60.7% of the market’s total value, underscoring Russia’s significant role as a major player in the European oil and gas market with a 24.7% share.\n\nOn March 8, 2024, SOCAR, the Azerbaijani state-owned oil and gas company, and Tatneft, a leading Russian oil and gas entity, entered into a cooperation agreement in the petrochemical sector. This collaboration was formalized after discussions between SOCAR’s President Rovshan Najaf and Tatneft’s Head Nail Maganov, marking a significant step towards strengthening ties in the petrochemical industry between the two companies.\n\nOn February 28, 2024, SOCAR’s Rovshan Najaf and Gazprom’s Alexei Miller held discussions on enhancing cooperation in the gas sector, amidst ongoing contractual engagements with Gazprom Export.\n\nIn a significant shift on March 7, 2024, the Dörtyol oil terminal in Türkiye’s Hatay province announced its decision to stop accepting Russian crude oil imports. This move comes as a direct response to the tightening of U.S. sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The Dörtyol terminal, previously known for its business with Iraqi crude, had seen an influx of Russian oil as Europe imposed restrictions and Russia sought alternative trade routes. In 2023, the terminal reported record levels of Russian crude passing through Türkiye to Europe, in direct contravention of EU sanctions. Global Terminal Services (GTS), which operates Dörtyol, stated that this cessation is an added precaution to ensure compliance with international sanctions, despite all previous operations fully adhering to them, including the G7’s price cap on transporting Russian oil.\n\nOn March 4, 2024, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal announced Ukraine’s willingness to continue the transit of Russian gas through its territory beyond 2024, conditional on requests from European countries. This statement underscores Ukraine’s role in the European energy landscape and its openness to facilitating gas supply despite ongoing tensions.\n\n\"If the European countries act as a consortium or one of the European partners will act as a transit country for their gas -- we are ready to provide such a service,\" Shmyhal told a press conference.\n\nUkraine can seal a deal on gas transit with the European Commission or a group of European countries that are interested in maintaining the transit, Shmyhal said.\n\nHe stressed that Ukraine will not extend the existing gas transit contract or sign a new contract with Russia.\n\nOn February 27, 2024, KazMunayGas (“KMG”), Kazakhstan’s national oil and gas company, detailed its full-year operational results for 2023. Under the leadership of Magzum Mirzagaliyev, Chairman of the Management Board, KMG successfully pursued its strategic initiatives, benefiting a wide range of stakeholders from shareholders and investors to employees, regional operations, and the country at large.\n\nIn 2023, KMG’s notable endeavors included the initiation of three new fields to boost gas production. May saw the start of the Aksai Yuzhny field, followed by the Vostochny Urikhtau field in early December, and the year concluded with the Rozhkovskoye field’s commencement. Additionally, in November, KMG finalized the acquisition of a 60% interest from French TotalEnergies in the Dunga oil and gas field in Mangistau region, contributing 547 thousand tons of oil production for the year, with KMG’s share amounting to 40 thousand tons since joining the project.\n\nIn a strategic move to stabilize domestic gasoline prices and meet the increased consumer and agricultural demand, Russia declared a six-month suspension of gasoline exports starting March 1, 2024. This decision, as reported by Reuters on February 27, 2024, aims to address the seasonal surge in fuel requirements, particularly during spring agricultural activities, refinery maintenance periods, and the summer holiday season.\n\nAlexander Novak, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister, confirmed the prohibition, which was officially sanctioned by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. This regulatory action was propelled by Novak’s insights on impending fuel demand challenges outlined in a proposal dated February 21, 2024. The ban is anticipated to mitigate domestic gasoline price volatility, a matter of significant concern for Russian motorists and the agricultural sector, especially leading up to the presidential election set for March 15–17, 2024.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, Gazprom announced the commissioning of new gas pipelines in various regions of Russia, marking significant progress in the nation’s gasification efforts. In the Novospassky district of the Ulyanovsk region, a 4.7 km gas distribution network was introduced, providing gas to 89 households in the villages of Samaykino and Fabrichnye Vyselki. Similarly, the village of Sidelnikovo in the Republic of Mari El celebrated the completion of its gasification, with a newly built pipeline under the Program for the Development of Gas Supply and Gasification of the Republic. Another noteworthy development was in the Leninsky district of Tomsk, where gas distribution networks spanning 4.9 km were launched to serve 132 households. These projects underscore Gazprom’s commitment to enhancing regional gas supply and infrastructure.\n\nRussNeft achieved a significant increase in oil reserves in 2023, adding 8.3 million tons, primarily through its operations at the Tagrinskoye field. The company reported an impressive reserve replacement rate of 174%, producing 6.434 million tons of oil and 2.11 billion cubic meters of gas with a 96.6% APG utilization rate. New technological advancements have led to the commissioning of 69 oil wells and a notable increase in the overhaul period of the mechanized well stock to 834 days.\n\nSince the end of February 2022, the Russian oil and gas industry has faced continuous pressure. While Europe initially expected the process of reducing dependence on Russian hydrocarbons to take several years, by mid-autumn it became clear that European countries had nearly eliminated their total reliance on Russian oil and gas. In a recent interview, Aleksey Belogoriev, Deputy Chief Director for Energy at the Institute of Energy and Finance (IEF), discussed how the oil and gas industry has developed since the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine and what to anticipate in the future.\n\nAccording to the Center for Energy and Clean Air Research (CREA), Russia currently earns more than $551 million a day from the sale of oil and gas, despite attempts by the U.S., EU, and other countries to limit its revenue from fossil fuel exports.\n\nHowever, CREA analysts predict that the ceiling of Russian oil prices may be lowered to $30 per barrel in the future, which could lead to a drop in Russia’s fossil fuel revenue to $340 million a day. Europe may also completely abandon LNG and pipeline oil supplies from Russia, further reducing its revenue.\n\nRussia’s current fossil fuel revenues are only slightly below what the country was earning on average in May 2021, despite some countries boycotting Russian raw materials. The EU has banned maritime imports of Russian oil and oil products, but EU countries continue to import Russian oil and gas via pipeline or in the form of LNG.\n\nThe value of the Russian oil and gas market fell by 15.2 percent in 2019 due to a decline in oil and gas prices this year. This decrease marked the end of a period of double-digit growth recorded in 2017 and 2018. A sharper decline is expected in 2020, amid weaker demand and a sharp decline in oil prices. For the rest of the next five years, the market is expected to return to double-digit growth rates, as oil and gas prices are expected to pick up again after 2020, in line with the recovery in demand and a reduced supply.\n\nThe mean price of Brent, WTI, and Dubai crude oil fell by an average of 10.2 percent in 2019. Specifically, the price of Brent international benchmark crude oil in 2019 was USD64 per barrel, almost USD7 per barrel below the 2018 average. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude averaged USD57 per barrel in 2019, almost USD8 lower than in 2018, while the price of Dubai crude oil averaged USD63.2, USD6 lower than in 2018.\n\nA new gas deposit was discovered at the Leningradskoye field of the Yamal gas production center, Gazprom said on October 8, 2020.\n\nAs a result of drilling and testing of an exploratory well, commercial gas inflow of approximately 600,000 cubic meters per day has been achieved. This proves that the new deposit contains considerable volumes of gas. The commercial value of the field is therefore much higher today than in the past.\n\nThis is the fourth major discovery made by Gazprom in the past two years on the Yamal Peninsula shelf in the Kara Sea.\n\nThe company will calculate the newly discovered reserves of the Leningrad Field and submit the results to the State Reserves Commission for registration in the State Register.\n\nA working meeting between Alexei Miller, chairman of the Gazprom Management Committee, and Vagit Alekperov, president of Lukoil, took place in St. Petersburg on October 1, 2020.\n\nThe parties discussed current issues of cooperation, including further steps to prepare the development of the Vaneyvisskoye and Layavozhskoye fields.\n\nGazprom and Lukoil are bound by the General Agreement on Strategic Partnership from 2014 to 2024, under which Lukoil supplies gas to Gazprom’s gas transmission system.\n\nIn 2018, Gazprom and Lukoil signed an agreement setting out the parties’ intention to jointly develop the Vaneyvisskoye and Layavozhskoye fields in the Nenets autonomous district.\n\nPetroNeft, an oil and gas exploration company operating in Russia’s Tomsk region, has announced the successful test of a mini-oil refinery ahead of the projected timeline. The company owns and operates 50 percent of licenses 61 and 67 in the region. The successful test of a mini-refinery processing unit took place on license area 61, with regulatory approval expected by the first quarter of 2021. The project significantly reduces operating costs.\n\nIn January 2020, the company started the construction of a mini-oil processing plant on license area 61 to obviate having to purchase significant quantities of diesel fuel needed for machinery and power generation in production facilities, especially in the winter months. The project will reduce operational costs by more than USD600,000 by 2021. It will also further improve the profitability of the company by allowing the sale of surplus products on the local market at a significant premium to unrefined barrels.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, HMS Group, the leading manufacturer of pumping, oil and gas equipment, compressors and flow control solutions, and related systems in Russia and the C.I.S., announced its financial results for the six months ending June 30, 2020.\n\nFinancial highlights for first six months of 2020\n\n• Turnover: 19.5 billion rubles (minus 17 percent against previous year);\n\n• EBITDA: 2.1 billion rubles (plus eight percent against previous year), EBITDA margin at 10.8 percent;\n\n• Operating profit: 524 million rubles (minus 13 percent);\n\n• Loss for the period: 314 million rubles;\n\n• Total debt: 22.8 billion rubles (plus 14 percent against previous year);\n\n• Net debt: 16.2 billion rubles (plus 4.0 percent against previous year);\n\n• Net debt to EBITDA LTM (most recently completed 12-month period): 3.25x.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, Volga Gas plc, the oil and gas exploration and production company operating in the Volga region of Russia, announced the potentially significant discovery of a new oilfield as part of its ongoing exploration drilling program.\n\nAs announced on August 14, 2020 and published in the interim report of September 30, 2020, the Group is conducting a program to drill six exploration wells within its Karpenskiy License Area in structures separate from its existing oil reserves in the Uzen Field.\n\nThe presence of oil has been detected in a Triassic sandstone formation in a well in the north of the Uzen field.\n\nTransneft, the world’s largest oil pipeline company, published consolidated IFRS interim results for the second quarter of 2020 and the first half of the year on its official website for investors and shareholders on October 2, 2020.\n\nA particular feature of the first half of 2020 was the combination of strong results in the first quarter of 2020 and a significant reduction in key operational and financial indicators in the second quarter of 2020 due to a significant decrease in Russian oil production and, therefore, in the transport volume through the Transneft system under the OPEC+ agreement of May 1, 2020.\n\nCrude oil shipments declined by 7.1 million tons, or six percent year-on-year, and by 11.2 million tons, or nine percent year-on-year, to 109.0 million tons in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe Tatneft Group produced 2,104 thousand tons of crude oil in September, and the production volume since the beginning of the year amounted to 19,548 thousand tons, which was 2,803.7 thousand tons less than in the same period of 2019.\n\nTatneft’s production in September amounted to 2,078 thousand tons of crude oil, and the company’s production since the beginning of the year amounted to 19,307 thousand tons (a decrease of 2,799 thousand tons compared to the corresponding period of 2019). Tatneft’s production from license areas outside Tatarstan amounted to 25,000 tons in September and since the beginning of the year to 240.7 thousand tons, a decrease of 4.05 thousand tons compared to the corresponding production volume in 2019. The production volume of high-viscosity oil in September was 284.9 thousand tons and since the beginning of the year 2,468 thousand tons, which is 501.1 thousand tons more than the volume for the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nThe Omsk oil refinery of Gazpromneft in Siberia, Russia, has significantly reduced its air emissions through the use of BELCO wet washing technology licensed from DuPont Clean Technologies, the Russian company announced on October 1, 2020. With an installed capacity of 22.23 million tons of oil per year, the Omsk oil refinery is one of Russia’s leading refineries.\n\nThe BELCO wet scrubbing technology was installed in Omsk during the conversion of the Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU). It efficiently removes contaminants from the exhaust gases emitted by the FCCU, thereby reducing air emissions well below the detection limit.\n\nOn September 23, 2020, Lukoil shared its successful experience in integrating digital technologies into hydrocarbon production with Russian experts and businessmen at the 11th Tyumen Oil and Gas Forum. The project to digitize the company’s production offers integrated field models that enable the management of oil and gas facilities to be optimized. These digital models contribute to the efficient production of hydrocarbons in the fields of the Bolshevik basin (Yamal-Nenets autonomous district) and the Yuzhno-Yagunskoye field (Khanty-Mansi autonomous district, Yugra), where an integrated operations center has been established. Similar centers are being built at the production facilities of Povkhneftegaz and Pokachevneftegaz in Western Siberia.\n\nIn September 2020, Salym Petroleum Development drilled its 1,500th well since the Salym Group began exploring oilfields in 2003. The anniversary well is 2,493 meters deep and has an S-shaped profile. It was drilled in an area of the upper Salym field developed as part of the South Hub project. Sibirskaya Servisnaya Kompaniya (SSK), one of the drilling companies of the SPD group, carried out the drilling.\n\nShale gas production is expected to continue in just a few countries around the world besides the United States.\n\nOn November 19, 2019, the Gazprom board of directors took note of the information regarding the growth prospects of the shale gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry across the world, as well as the opportunities and the threats facing the company.\n\nIt was highlighted that the share of the United States in the global shale gas production exceeded 95 percent in 2018. According to current forecasts, the U.S. will remain the main producer of shale gas for the long term.\n\nIt is expected that shale gas production outside of North America will not have a significant impact on the global gas market configuration and Gazprom’s future export activities, as far out as 2030.\n\nRosneft’s nine-month net income jumped by 25 percent year-on-year to RUB550 billion, including a quarter-on-quarter increase to RUB225 billion in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) increased by 7.6 percent quarter-on-quarter to RUB554 billion with a margin improvement to 24.4 percent. In the third quarter, FCF (free cash flow) more than doubled quarter-on-quarter to RUB281 billion. Financial debt and trading liabilities decreased by RUB820 billion since the year’s beginning.\n\nQ3 & 9M 2019 IFRS results\n\nNovatek announces consolidated IFRS results for Q3 and 9M 2019.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Novatek’s total revenues and its normalized EBITDA, including the company’s share in the EBITDA of its joint ventures, amounted to RUB189.2 billion and RUB104.5 billion, respectively, representing decreases of 13.8 percent and 11.5 percent as compared to the prior year’s corresponding period. The decreases were primarily due to lower hydrocarbons sales prices on international markets in 2019, which were largely offset by an increase in the company’s natural gas sales volumes due to the production launch at the second and third LNG trains at Yamal LNG in July and November 2018, respectively.\n\nGazprom posts IFRS net profit of RUB1.10 trillion in 9M 2019.\n\nOn November 29, 2019, PJSC Gazprom issued its unaudited consolidated interim condensed financial information prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) for the nine months ended on September 30, 2019.\n\nSales (net of excise tax, VAT, and customs duties) decreased by RUB203,252 million, or three percent, to RUB5,698,339 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. The decrease in sales was mainly due to a change in volumes sold and a change in average prices.\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of Energy and former Texas Governor Rick Perry told reporters at the CERAWeek Energy Conference (hosted by IHS Markit), which was held in Houston from March 11 to 15, that the United States does not rule out introducing new sanctions against Russia and other countries supporting the Maduro government in Venezuela.\n\nIn answering a question from a TASS reporter, Rick Perry first spoke fondly of his time in Russia and praised Smoke BBQ restaurant in St. Petersburg, which he visited on his prior trip. In what amounted to an advertisement of the Russian restaurant, the Energy Secretary said that the barbecue at Smoke BBQ was simply superb, suggesting that the owners must have traveled to Texas to learn how to make real barbecue.\n\nGazprom held its 14th annual Investor Day in Hong Kong (February 26) and Singapore (February 28).\n\nTaking part in the events were Andrey Kruglov, deputy chairman of Gazprom’s management committee, Oleg Aksyutin, member of the management committee and department head at Gazprom, Elena Burmistrova, director general of Gazprom Export, and representatives of the company’s relevant subdivisions and its subsidiaries Gazprom Neft and Gazprom Energoholding.\n\nThe events were once again attended by representatives of the world’s leading investment funds and banks, as well as credit organizations from the Asia-Pacific region, continental Europe, the U.K., the U.S., and Russia, including analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Sova Capital Limited, and Gazprombank.\n\nThe livestream of the Investor Day was also available on the internet.\n\nOn February 27, 2019, Alexey Miller, chairman of Gazprom’s management committee, and Dmitry Rogozin, director general of State Space Corporation Roscosmos, held a joint meeting in Moscow on the prospects for further cooperation. The event was attended by heads of the relevant subdivisions and subsidiaries of the company and the state corporation. The cooperation between Gazprom and Roscosmos is strategic in nature. Specifically, Russia’s Unified Gas Supply System operates with the use of about 500 gas compressor units developed by RPA Iskra (part of Roscosmos).\n\nRosneft Deutschland GmbH, a Rosneft subsidiary, started direct marketing operations in order to increase the company’s efficiency. The company markets all refined products produced by Rosneft Deutschland at three refineries in Germany. The products range includes gasoline, diesel, heating oil, jet fuel, LPG, bitumen, fuel oil, and petrochemical products.\n\nRosneft Deutschland markets oil products not only from the three refineries directly, but also from more than 30 lifting locations throughout Germany via road, rail, and barge. Rosneft Deutschland has an established client base of more than 500 customers in Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Austria, and France.\n\nIn 2018, RN-Bunker, a subsidiary of Rosneft Oil Company, increased its bunker oil sales by 10 percent year-on-year to 3.2 million tons.\n\nThe increase in the bunker oil sales volumes was due to the company’s efficient operations, customer service expansion, and cooperation development with major foreign and Russian consumers, including those in the Far East ports.\n\nFurthermore, in 2018, RN-Bunker managed to increase its bunkering volume in ports of Kaliningrad (2.6x) and the Caucasus (almost 1.5x). In addition, last year long-term contracts were signed with key domestic consumers, such as Rosmorport, Russian Fishery Company, and Morspassluzhba.\n\nThe Fifth OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting was held in Vienna, Austria, on December 7, 2018, under the co-chairmanship of OPEC’s President, HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Industry of the United Arab Emirates and head of its delegation, and Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe meeting recalled the rights of the peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources.\n\nLukoil announced the results of the reserves assessment and independent audit as of December 31, 2018.\n\nAccording to the SEC classification, the company’s proven hydrocarbon reserves totaled 15.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 76 percent of which stood for liquids. The proven reserves replacement ratio for liquids totaled 101 percent. In Russia, the main region of Lukoil’s operations, the replacement ratio reached 127 percent. The company’s proven hydrocarbon reserves life is 19 years.\n\nAs a result of geological exploration and production drilling conducted in 2018, Lukoil added 576 million barrels of oil equivalent to proven reserves with the largest contribution from production drilling in West Siberia and Timan-Pechora.\n\nIn 2018, NOVATEK’s total revenues amounted to RUB831.8 billion and the normalized EBITDA, including the share in the EBITDA of the entity’s joint ventures, totaled RUB415.3 billion, representing year-on-year increases of 42.6 percent and 61.9 percent, respectively. The increases in total revenues and the normalized EBITDA were largely due to a production launch at the first three LNG trains at Yamal LNG and a favorable macro-economic environment with increases in average realized liquids and natural gas prices.\n\nOn April 30, 2018, the deep-water pipelay for the first line of the TurkStream offshore gas pipeline has been completed off Turkey’s Black Sea coast.\n\nThe average rate of the deep-water pipelay carried out by the pipelaying vessel Pioneering Spirit was 4.3 kilometers per day. The maximum pipelaying rate of 5.6 kilometers per day was reached two times in February 2018.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule, the project is being simultaneously implemented onshore in Russia and Turkey and in the Black Sea. The receiving terminal is being constructed near the settlement of Kiyikoy, Turkey. Upon the completion of the landfall sections, work on the first line will be completed. Following the schedule, Pioneering Spirit will continue the deep-water pipelay of line two in the third quarter of 2018.\n\nOn May 31, 2018, Gazprom’s management committee completed the review of operating results of the company’s subsidiaries over the period of months spanning the fall of 2017 and the winter of 2018, finalizing the discussion of measures to be taken to ensure uninterrupted gas supplies to consumers during the upcoming winter.\n\nThe committee noted that in the past winter Gazprom provided reliable gas deliveries to consumers in Russia and abroad.\n\nGazprom supplied gas to domestic consumers without restrictions. Particular attention was paid to gas deliveries for socially significant facilities, public utility enterprises, and the general population.\n\nFrom October 2017 through March 2018, gas demand showed considerable growth in Europe and in Turkey. Overall gas supplies rose by 3.8 percent compared to the previous fall/winter season, reaching 107.4 billion cubic meters.\n\nOn June 5, 2018, the chairman of Gazprom’s management committee Alexey Miller and the chairman of OMV’s executive board Rainer Seele signed an agreement to extend until 2040 the existing contract between Gazprom Export and OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH for Russian gas supplies to Austria. The original contract was valid until 2028.\n\nRussia’s President Vladimir Putin and Austria’s Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz attended the signing as part of celebrations marking 50 years of supplies of Russian gas to Austria.\n\n“The Agreement signed today is yet another testament to the growing need for gas imports both in Austria and in Europe in general – the need that Gazprom is ready to satisfy. By implementing the construction project for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, we will make gas deliveries even more reliable for the benefit of consumers,” Alexey Miller said.\n\nThe chairman of Gazprom’s management committee Alexey Miller and the chairman of the board of executive directors of BASF Martin Brudermueller had a working meeting in St. Petersburg on May 28, 2018. The meeting covered a broad range of issues related to the companies’ cooperation, including joint projects for hydrocarbon development in Russia.\n\nAlexey Miller and Martin Brudermueller discussed the Nord Stream gas pipeline that has been brought into operation. It was noted that the pipeline provided reliable supplies of Russian gas to thousands of companies and millions of households across Europe every day. The parties also addressed the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 project.\n\nBASF is a leader in the global chemical industry. The company’s portfolio includes oil and gas, chemicals, synthetics, and petroleum derivatives.\n\nOn May 26, 2018, Gazprom and the government of Turkey signed a protocol for the construction of the onshore section of the TurkStream gas pipeline. The pipeline will deliver Russian gas to European consumers. As a follow-up to the protocol, Gazprom and Botas inked an agreement detailing the terms and conditions of the construction work. TurkAkim Gaz Tasima A.S., a joint venture that will be established on equal terms, will build the onshore section.\n\nIn addition, Gazprom Export and Botas signed documents to settle out of court the ongoing arbitration dispute on the contract terms of Russia’s gas supplies to Turkey. The arbitration will be resolved shortly.\n\nA working meeting between the chairman of Gazprom’s management committee Alexey Miller and the CEO of Edison and executive vice president of the EDF Group Marc Benayoun took place on May 25, 2018 at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nThe parties addressed the ongoing interaction in the energy sector, in particular the implementation of the two sides’ cooperation agreement and the status of the TurkStream and the Poseidon projects.\n\nEdison is a part of the EDF Group. Its core businesses include the procurement, production, and sale of electricity, the provision of energy and environmental services, as well as exploration and production.\n\nOn May 25, 2018, director general of Gazprom Energoholding Denis Fyodorov and the chief financial officer of Siemens Alexander Liberov signed a strategic cooperation agreement. The agreement sets out the main directions and principles of cooperation in the field of technological upgrades of Gazprom Energoholding’s generating facilities with the use of Siemens-manufactured innovative electrical equipment. Specifically, one of the priority areas of joint work is the introduction of vacuum generator switches and high-tech components in the construction and upgrading of power units.\n\nSiemens plans to set up its manufacturing facilities to make that equipment in Russia and bring the local content of its finished products to at least 50 percent by 2020, with an option for a phased increase to 75 percent by 2022.\n\nOn April 26, 2018, Gazprom published its audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the year that ended on December 31, 2017.\n\nTotal sales (net of excise tax, VAT, and customs duties) increased by RUB435,092 million, or seven percent, to RUB6,546,143 million for the year that ended on December 31, 2017 compared to the year that ended on December 31, 2016. The increase in sales was mainly driven by an increase in sales of refined products and crude oil.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, Gazprom’s management committee endorsed the proposal to convene the company’s annual general shareholders meeting in St. Petersburg. In addition, the management committee approved the proposals on the format and the content of voting ballots and the wording of decisions on the meeting’s agenda.\n\nThe management committee submitted to the Gazprom’s board of directors the company’s annual accounting statements for 2017 compiled in accordance with the Russian law, as well as the drafts of the shareholders’ meeting agenda and the distribution sheet allocating Gazprom’s profit based on the 2017 operating results.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, Rosneft released its first quarter results for 2018. The company’s average daily hydrocarbon production stood at 5.71 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), which is a figure close to the level observed in the first quarter of 2017. Liquids production increased 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter. Gas production in the reporting period amounted to 16.9 billion cubic meters (bcm). The company also managed to achieve refining quality improvement with the light products yield reaching 58.8 percent and the refining depth increasing to 75.4 percent.\n\nUpstream\n\nHydrocarbon production at Rosneft reached 5.71 mmboed in the first quarter of 2018, remaining close to the level observed in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nOn May 1, 2018, Rosneft’s board of directors approved additional provisions to Rosneft-2022 strategy that followed the annual address of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to the Federal Assembly.\n\nAs previously announced, the key strategic focus of Rosneft-2022 is to increase the company’s profitability and the oil major’s returns on existing assets. The company’s portfolio is comprised of high-yield investments having the primary objectives of ensuring delivery on time and on budget. Rosneft’s other initiatives include employee development programs, educational and social projects, regional development programs, as well as accelerated technological advancement.\n\nOn May 25, 2018, during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Rosneft and Bashneftegeofizika signed an agreement for working together in developing high-tech LWD (logging while drilling) equipment for horizontal well drilling, as well as equipment for pay zone well testing in the exploration drilling of oil and gas wells.\n\nThe volume and complexity of the construction of horizontal wells at Rosneft’s fields in recent years has been constantly increasing. The share of horizontal wells in the overall number of the wells drilled increased to 36 percent in 2017. The number of new horizontal wells with multistage hydraulic fracturing increased by 67 percent. For instance, in the first quarter of 2018, the number of new horizontal wells with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing that were put into operation increased by more than 65 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017.\n\nBashneft International B.V., a Rosneft subsidiary, has discovered a new oilfield named Salman, following the drilling of the first exploration well in Block 12 in Iraq, the oil major announced on May 23, 2018.\n\nThe exploration well was successfully drilled to the depth of 4,277 meters, resulting in an oil flow that makes reserves apparent.\n\nThe company considers this discovery an important landmark in upstream projects abroad.\n\nBlock 12 is located in southwest Iraq, in an unexplored area of the Arabian Plate, approximately 80 km to the south of the city of As-Samawah and 130 km to the west of the city of Nasiriyah. It has an area of 7,680 sq. km. Bashneft International B.V. is an operator of the project.\n\nRosneft has opened an international research and development (R&D) center in Qatar, which will become a full-scale representative office of the company. The new office will perform scientific and technical activities, as well as promote the company’s business in the region.\n\nThe research and development center will be located at the Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), which is a part of the Qatar Foundation (QF).\n\nQSTP is one of the world’s leading science incubators that provides a unique economic environment for enterprises engaged in the development and the implementation of new technologies, including those in the energy sector.\n\nOn May 28, 2018, Lukoil released its condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three-month period that ended on March 31, 2018 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018 the company’s sales were RUB1,630.7 billion, 13.9 percent higher year-on-year, mainly as a result of higher hydrocarbon prices. Lower refined products trading volumes, inventory build-up and a stronger ruble negatively impacted sales dynamics. The company’s sales decreased by 1.9 percent quarter-on-quarter as a consequence of lower oil trading volumes.\n\nEBITDA\n\nOn April 27, 2018, Lukoil announced that the company completed the installation of a wellhead platform’s topside at the Yury Korchagin field. The Korchagin field, which is now in phase two of its development, lies within the Russian sector of the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe wellhead platform is a satellite platform designed to drill wells in the eastern part of the field. Drilling at phase two sites is expected to start by the summer months.\n\nApart from hosting processing equipment, the platform is equipped with safety systems, living personnel quarters, and a helideck. As most of the operations are automated, only eight workspaces are designed for the temporary stay of the personnel.\n\nThe oil and gas produced will be transported to the host platform through subsea pipelines and treated for delivery onshore.\n\nLukoil’s cumulative production of oil in Russia exceeded two billion tons, the company reported on February 1, 2018. The company’s Russian projects produced jointly no less than 80 million tons of oil annually in the past 14 years.\n\nThe first billion tons of oil was produced by Lukoil in 2006, fifteen years after the company was established. The milestone of two billion tons was reached eleven years later.\n\nThe uptick in production can be attributed to the recent commissioning of major oilfields, including the Vladimir Filanovsky field in the Caspian Sea, the Pyakyakhinskoye field on the Yamal Peninsula, and the Imilorskoye field in Western Siberia. New technologies have made it possible to increase significantly the production of hard-to-extract hydrocarbons, for instance the super-viscous oil at the Yarega field within the Komi republic.\n\nOn February 16, 2018, Lukoil announced the results of the company’s oil and gas reserves assessment done as part of an independent audit. According to the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) standards, the company’s proved hydrocarbon reserves as of December 31, 2017 totaled 16.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 75 percent of which were oil reserves. The company’s proved reserves life is 19 years.\n\nOn May 18, 2018, the board of directors of Novatek resolved to create a transportation subsidiary called Maritime Arctic Transport LLC to manage and optimize transportation costs, build up Arctic navigation skills, and provide for centralized management of the company’s Arctic fleet.\n\nNovatek’s management board chairman Leonid Mikhelson said, “Novatek’s long-term development strategy envisages a significant growth in LNG production from the company’s vast hydrocarbon resource base located on the Yamal and the Gydan peninsulas in the Arctic zone of more than 55 million tons per annum by 2030. Therefore, establishing an efficient Northern Sea Route shipping model is one of the company’s key priorities to realize the long-term strategy. Creating the company’s own shipping company fully supports this goal and will optimize transportation cost and ensure a well-balanced, centralized management structure to improve the competitiveness of Novatek’s Arctic projects.”\n\nOn May 24, 2018, Novatek’s management board chairman Leonid Mikhelson and Total’s chairman and chief executive officer Patrick Pouyannе signed a binding agreement for working together on the Arctic LNG 2 project.\n\nThe agreement provides for Total’s acquisition of a 10-percent participation interest in the project, together with a five-percent option that may be exercised in case Novatek decides to decrease its participation interest below 60 percent. The project’s value has been estimated at 25.5 billion dollars.\n\nOn March 27, 2018, Novatek announced that Novatek Gas and Power Asia Pte. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, shipped its first cargo of LNG produced by the Yamal LNG project to the Indian market.\n\nNovatek’s first deputy chairman of the management board Lev Feodosyev said, “One of the company’s core priorities enumerated in the company’s corporate strategy 2030 is the expansion of the supply geography and the growth of the company’s presence in key Asian markets. The first cargo delivered to the growing Indian market is an important development step in this direction.”\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Novatek released its consolidated interim condensed financial statements for the three months that ended on March 31, 2018 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company’s total revenues amounted to RUB179.4 billion and its normalized EBITDA, including the company’s share in the EBITDA of the joint ventures, totaled RUB76.3 billion. These figures represented year-on-year increases of 16.0 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. The increases in the company’s total revenues and the normalized EBITDA were largely due to the launch of production at the first LNG train at Yamal LNG at the end of 2017 and an increase in the average realized liquids and natural gas prices.\n\nOn June 1, 2018, Transneft released consolidated interim condensed financial statements prepared according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the three months that ended on March 31, 2018. Crude oil delivery for the three months that ended on March 31, 2018 amounted to 116.5 million tons, 1.2 million tons or 1.0 percent down year-on-year. Oil freight turnover decreased by 1.8 billion ton-km or by 0.6 percent.\n\nPetroleum products deliveries for the three months that ended on March 31, 2018 came to 9.9 million tons. The growth year-on-year amounted to 1.8 million tons, or 22.2 percent.\n\nTransneft’s revenue grew by RUB6.2 billion, or 2.8 percent, mainly due to higher revenues from oil transportation, exports, and other earnings.\n\nOn May 29, 2018, Tatneft’s management, headed by the company’s general director Nail Maganov held a meeting with institutional investors in Kazan. Investors were represented by managers and analysts of large investment companies from the U.S., Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and Singapore. Investment bank Goldman Sachs organized the group’s visit to Tatarstan.\n\nDuring the meeting, which was held in an open discussion format, the participants talked about the company’s operational and financial results, its production and investment plans, its dividend policy, as well as other issues.\n\nOn April 5, 2018, Transneft announced that it commissioned the Volgograd Refinery – Tinguta – Tikhoretsk – Novorossiysk petroleum products trunk pipelines (PPTPs), a part of the company’s Yug project.\n\nThe implementation of the Yug project entails creating an infrastructure suitable for both pipeline transportation of diesel fuel in the direction of Novorossiysk, a Russian port, and for exporting up to six million tons of crude oil per year from Russia’s Black Sea coast to European countries. The commissioning of the Yug project’s PPTPs was preceded by successful system tests at peak oil pumping modes using an agent, with a number of technical measures taken during the trial.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, Tatneft published its unaudited consolidated interim condensed financial statements for the three months that ended March 31, 2018, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and a related financial analysis done by company management (“MD&A”).\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Tatneft produced 7.1 million tons, or 50.6 million barrels (MMbbl) of crude oil and 223.3 million cubic meters of gas. The TANECO refinery’s output in the first quarter of 2018 was 2.2 million tons of refined products.\n\nThe company said that the gas produced will be exported in the form of liquefied natural gas.\n\nRosneft plans to carry on production at two fields offshore Venezuela for 15 years, averaging at 6.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year. The gas produced will be exported in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the Russian oil company reported on December 17.\n\nAccording to the company’s statement, Venezuelan authorities gave a Rosneft subsidiary, a license to develop the offshore fields of Patan and Mejillones for 30 years.\n\nAccording to the license, Groupo Rosneft will be the project operator and will be able to export all the volumes produced, in the form of LNG among other options. The gas reserves in place for the two fields are 180 billion cubic meters. The targeted production level is 6.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year for 15 years,” the company stated.\n\nAt the same time, Ministry of Economic Development predicts a gradual decline in oil prices in 2018.\n\nThe average price of the Urals-brand crude oil totaled 52.17 dollars per barrel from January to November 2017, according to a report by the Russian Ministry of Finance published on December 1.\n\nIn the corresponding period of the previous year, the average price of a barrel of the Urals-brand crude oil stood at 41.02 dollar. As such, on an annualized basis, for the first 11 months of the current year, the increase in the average price of the Urals oil was 27.2 percent.\n\nThe average price of the Urals-brand oil in November 2017 was 61.97 dollars per barrel, which is 1.41 times higher than a year earlier.\n\nThe chairman of Gazprom’s board of directors Viktor Zubkov said that the concern relies on companies from the defense industry.\n\nGazprom relies on the Russian defense industry to develop technologies and equipment for offshore operations, the chairman of Gazprom’s board of directors Viktor Zubkov said while taking part in launching the Leaders of Russia competition in Rostov-on-Don on December 11, 2017.\n\n“We did not have all of these technologies [for gas production at sea]. Now, through the association of Russian companies that are developing equipment for Gazprom and with the involvement of defense sector companies, we are creating these technologies. We need to get all the thinking, all research, all development knowhow to produce on deep shelves,” Zubkov said.\n\nProcessing volumes in the reporting period will stand at 39.7 million tons.\n\nBy the end of 2017, Gazprom Neft plans to increase the production of hydrocarbons some 4.2 percent relative to the previous year. Volumes are expected to go up to 89.8 million tons of oil equivalent, the company said on December 25, 2017.\n\n“In 2017, the volume of hydrocarbon production of Gazprom Neft will be 89.8 million tons of oil equivalent, which is 4.2 percent higher than the volume of production registered in 2016. The annual volume of processing according to preliminary estimates is expected to reach 39.7 million tons,” the company’s statement said.\n\nThe development of new large-scale projects in the Arctic region, such as the Novoportovskoye, the East Messoyakhskoye, and the Prirazlomnoye fields have made the largest contribution to increasing hydrocarbon production in 2017.\n\nFrom January 1 to August 15, 2017, Gazprom’s gas supplies to the countries that will be serviced by the future Turkish Stream pipeline rose up markedly. In particular, Russian gas supplies to Turkey, Southern, and Southeastern Europe increased against the corresponding period of 2016 as follows: exports to Turkey increased by 22.4 percent, to Greece by 13.2 percent, to Serbia by 40.8 percent, to Bulgaria by 11.1 percent, and to Hungary by 24.4 percent.\n\nThe volume of Russian gas exports to foreign countries increased from January 1 to August 15, 2017 by 12.7 billion cubic meters, or 12 percent, relative to the corresponding period of the prior year, up to 118.3 billion cubic meters (4.17 tcf).\n\nThe U.S.-based oil giant ExxonMobil has challenged the decision of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Treasury Department that imposed a fine on the company for violating the sanctions against Russia, the company said in a statement on July 20, 2017.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury fined ExxonMobil a total of two million dollars for violating anti-Russian sanctions related to Ukraine. OFAC’s statement said that the company was punished for signing eight documents in May 2014 with the president of Rosneft Igor Sechin, who had been included on the American sanctions list. The divisions of the U.S. company involved in the deals with Rosneft are ExxonMobil Development Co. and ExxonMobil Oil Corp.\n\nThe U.S. State Department later said that the former head of ExxonMobil and the U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not participate in the Treasury Department’s imposition of penalties against the company.\n\nIn August 2017, Russia maintained the leading position in world oil production, producing on average 10.608 million barrels of oil per day, Rosstat data released on October 23, 2017 demonstrate. Russia’s daily production stood ahead of Saudi Arabia’s output for the sixth month in a row. Saudi Arabia’s extraction volume in August was in the second place, with 10.022 million barrels of oil per day.\n\nIn the reporting period, the OPEC countries produced 32.755 million barrels a day on average. Iraq’s production stood at 4.448 million barrels. Experts believe that Saudi oil exports will continue decreasing because the country’s crude stockpiles are being drawn down.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has called on shale oil producing companies in the U.S. to join the agreement on reducing production. The OPEC’s Secretary General Muhammad Barkindo made the request in a speech at the CERAWeek conference in New Delhi on September 26, 2017. He has called on producers in the U.S. “to show responsibility” and not to allow for the collapse of the price of oil.\n\n“We urge our friends in the shale basins of North America to take this shared responsibility with all seriousness it deserves, as one of the key lessons learned from the current unique supply-driven cycle,” Secretary General Barkindo said at the conference.\n\nHe explained that the need to decrease production comes as a result of the market’s oversaturation. In Mr. Barkindo’s words, the oil supply hasn’t reached a balance in the nine months that the Russia-OPEC agreement has been in effect.\n\nIn the timeframe from January 1 to July 15, 2017, Gazprom increased gas production by 18.8 percent against the corresponding period of the previous year. The company extracted 248.8 billion cubic meters of gas (8.7 tcf), which is 39.3 billion cubic meters (1.3 tcf) more than the figure reported last year, the gas company’s July 17, 2017 press release said.\n\nOver the reporting period, exports of Russia’s gas to foreign countries increased by 11.3 billion cubic meters (0.4 tcf), or 12.3 percent year-on-year. Deliveries to the countries of Northwest and Central Europe have increased overall. In particular, supplies to Germany rose by 16.7 percent, to Austria by 77.2 percent, to the Czech Republic by 24.8 percent, and to Slovakia by 25.8 percent.\n\nAccording to Rosneft’s published materials, the company’s program until the year 2022 entails drilling ten search wells and undertaking exploratory works at license areas in the Far East and on the East Arctic shelf. Rosneft’s total spending for exploration and production in the region are anticipated to reach RUB140 billion (USD2.37 billion) in the planning period, the company’s materials released September 8, 2017 suggest.\n\nIn the beginning of April, Rosneft started drilling a well at the northernmost Central Olginskaya-1 offshore field in the Khatanga license area in the East Arctic.\n\nRosneft intends to speed up exploratory drilling on the Arctic shelf, drilling four search wells in the Laptev Sea, and eight wells in the Karsky and the Barents seas. Rosneft now has 28 license areas on the Arctic shelf with total resources of 34 billion tons of oil equivalent. Rosneft’s share comprises 78 percent of total licensed areas in the Arctic.\n\nAuthorities in the U.S. are ready to prohibit the transfer of actual control over the Citgo oil refining company to Russia’s Rosneft, The Wall Street Journal reported on September 1, 2017. According to The Wall Street Journal, the White House stands ready to block the transaction for Rosneft’s receiving control over Citgo, which is the U.S.-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state oil and gas company PDVSA. Moreover, some U.S. officials think that the report of Rosneft’s receiving a controlling stake in the company is likely to engender adverse legal consequences for Citgo.\n\nWhile the U.S. implemented restrictive measures targeting Russia in connection with the situation in Ukraine, it did not absolutely prohibit American companies from participating in all unconventional projects.\n\nUnconventional reserves include hard-to-extract resources that typically necessitate such techniques as hydraulic fracturing. In the years past, Russian oil companies looked to Western firms to supply the technology for effectively recovering unconventionals.\n\nDespite the sanctions, the Norwegian multinational oil and gas company Statoil still develops Russian unconventional reserves. BP is also looking to undertake a similar project. The reason that the Western companies’ participation in Russia’s unconventional plays is not in breach of U.S. sanctions is that those Southeast Russian sites constitute limestone formations.\n\nRosneft predicts very low oil prices of USD40 to USD43 per barrel in 2018. Shale oil producers and also U.S. financial markets are likely to exert an impact on oil prices.\n\n“One of the most essential factors, along with the active work of shale oil producers, is the great influence of U.S. financial markets on oil prices. The devaluation of the dollar is now at about 20 percent. To use the corresponding coefficients, the true price of oil is about USD40 per barrel,” Rosneft’s CEO Igor Sechin summed up on September 11, 2017.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, the price of Brent crude oil fell to USD40 per barrel. This year, the lowest price of oil was USD44.3 per barrel, and the maximum price has been recorded at the beginning of this year at USD58.37 per barrel.\n\nDuring the 9th BRICS Summit in China, Rosgeo and South Africa’s PetroSA agreed to work together on shelf projects, the Russian geological company announced on September 4, 2017.\n\nIn particular, the contract provides for exploration and development of blocks 9 and 11A of the southern continental shelf off the coast of South Africa. The agreement envisions a considerable exploratory phase. Three-dimensional seismic prospecting will cover more than 4,000 square kilometers, while gravity-magnetic prospecting will span over 13,000 kilometers. Rosgeo will also drill exploratory wells. The estimated volume of investment is about USD400 million.\n\nReserves in the region have been estimated at over 50 million tons of oil and over 400 billion cubic meters (14 tcf) of gas. Expected gas resources can reach as much as 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42.3 tcf).\n\nThe U.S. would not be able to replace Russia’s gas supplies to Europe, the Permanent Representative of Russia to the E.U. Vladimir Chizhov said on August 17, 2017. “Even if the U.S. delivered the liquefied gas (LNG) to Europe free of charge, they just wouldn’t have a chance to replace Russia’s deliveries,” Ambassador Chizhov elaborated.\n\nThe Permanent Representative named three reasons for why the U.S. couldn’t become an alternative to Russia.\n\n“In the United States, the export terminal for the shipment of LNG is in Louisiana. The U.S. is yet to construct a half-dozen terminals in different parts of the country. Second, there is not enough gas. Third, in Europe there aren’t a lot of terminals that are ready to accept the liquefied gas, and there aren’t a lot of tankers for transporting it,” Ambassador Chizhov noted.\n\nGerhard Schröder confirmed his intention to hold a position on Rosneft’s board of directors. The ex-chancellor from the Social Democratic Party (SPD) said that the answer to his decision lay in his desire to make Germany and Europe energy-independent. He left open the question of whether he will hold the position as the chairman of Rosneft’s supervisory board.\n\nThe ex-politician called unreasonable the attempts to isolate Russia. “The demonizing of Russia won’t bring benefit to anybody,” he has emphasized. Mr. Schröder rejected the opinion that Rosneft is “a hand of the Russian government,” noting that the shareholders of the world’s largest oil company also include BP, Qatar, and Glencore. He has also emphasized that Russian representatives do not dominate Rosneft’s supervisory board."
