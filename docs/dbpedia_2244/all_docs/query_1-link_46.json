        "text": "In a drive to become more self-reliant in gas, Kazakh state Kazmunaigas (KMG) has been handed the Urikhtau gas field in the west of the country. The field is earmarked to supply a 1,500 km gas pipeline that is planned to be built from the energy-rich west to the heavily populated south of Kazakhstan, where alarm bells rang last month when Uzbekistan briefly cut gas flows due to higher consumption at home. Prime Minister Karim Massimov said he had given the energy and economy ministries one month to transfer the Urikhtau field to KMG for development in connection with the construction of the Beyneu-Bozoy-Samsonovka pipeline, which should start this year for completion in 2011. \"The field is free and nobody can use it,\" Uzakbay Karabalin, KMG president, was quoted as saying by local reports."
