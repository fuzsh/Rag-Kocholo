At the initial stage, Chevron will re-process existing seismic data and develop technical interpretations. The parties consider the signed agreement as a potential starting point for broader cooperation,” the information says.\n\n\"We are pleased to start working with Chevron on new gas fields. It is expected that further exploration and development of a potential gas and gas condensate field at the Zhalibek site in the future will contribute to the development of the resource base of commercial gas and the economic growth of the country,\" said Sanzhar Zharkeshov, Chairman of the Board of QazaqGaz, quoted in a press release.\n\nQazaqGaz manages the infrastructure for gas transportation through main gas pipelines and gas distribution networks, provides international transit and sells gas on domestic and foreign markets, develops, finances, builds and operates pipelines and gas storage facilities.\n\n---"
