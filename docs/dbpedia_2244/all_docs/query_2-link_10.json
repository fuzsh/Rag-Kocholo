        "text": "Kazakhstan and Chevron Sign Gas Exploration Agreement\n\nJSC NC QazaqGaz and Chevron Munaigas Inc. have entered into a cooperation agreement focused on natural gas exploration in Kazakhstan’s Aktobe region. This partnership, initiated by Kazakhstan’s national gas company (QazaqGaz) and Chevron Corp., aims to evaluate the gas potential near the established Urikhtau and Zhanazhol fields.\n\nChevron Munaigas will start by reprocessing seismic data and contribute to a broader exploration campaign supported by Samruk-Kazyna JSC and the Kazakhstan Energy Ministry. The exploration targets the Zhalibek site, with expectations to boost the country’s gas resource base and foster economic growth. This agreement follows a memorandum of understanding signed in 2022 for joint efforts in hydrocarbon exploration, gas processing, and energy transition.\n\nChevron has had a significant presence in Kazakhstan since 1993 and holds stakes in major projects like the Tengiz and Karachaganak fields, and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium."
