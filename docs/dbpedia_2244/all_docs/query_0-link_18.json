        "text": "News\n\nThis five-year agreement covers a comprehensive range of services, from consulting and concept to detailed engineering, aimed at optimizing and expanding the existing facilities and infrastructure of one of the largest oil and gas condensate fields in the world.\n\nNews\n\nThe expansion of the Tengizchevroil venture, known as the Future Growth Project, has delayed its full startup into the second quarter of next year. The project has gone well beyond its initial budget of $37 billion and the completion date had already been rescheduled twice from the original plan of mid-2022.\n\nNews\n\n“The market has now reached a price level that potentially doesn’t reflect current fundamentals,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. “Oil could be next in line” to suffer from a stronger dollar after other commodity prices came under pressure.\n\nNews\n\n“We are the guardian of this industry,” Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said as he announced Saudi's production cut on Tuesday, preserving the OPEC+ deal and sending oil prices to 10-month highs. He emphasized that the decision was made unilaterally by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman himself.\n\nNews\n\nThe deal, which emerged after two days of talks, sent crude surging to a 10-month high in New York. It appeared to give most members of the group what they wanted -- the additional price support desired by Saudi Arabia and the production boost Russia had been pushing.\n\nNews\n\nThe difference of opinion between Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two de-facto leaders of OPEC+, could make for another tricky meeting. While Russia appeared to be outnumbered, the group typically requires a consensus among all members before concluding talks.\n\nNews\n\n“Our involvement in the early stages of the project means we can work with KPO across a range of work to optimize the Karachaganak field with a focus on achieving an outstanding safety performance and operational excellence,” said Mark Fields, group president of Fluor’s Energy & Chemicals business.\n\nNews\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell, Eni and their partners in the Karachaganak oil and gas venture may be required to pay an additional $1 billion to settle a dispute with Kazakhstan over revenue sharing, said people familiar with the matter."
