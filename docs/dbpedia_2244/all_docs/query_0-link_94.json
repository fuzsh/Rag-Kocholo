        "text": "According to the Prime Minister's press service on February 5th, Kazakhstan has expressed its dedication to augmenting the oil supply volume through the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), also known as the Middle Corridor, to three million tons within a span of two years.\n\nIn 2023, close to one million tons of oil were transported via the Middle Corridor, and Kazakhstan aims to increase this figure to 1.5 million tons in the current year.\n\nThe Kazakh government is placing a significant emphasis on energy opportunities, with a focus on enhancing the oil and gas industry, modernizing electricity infrastructure, and expanding renewable energy capacity.\n\nExpansion projects are underway in the oil industry, particularly at the Tengiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan fields.\n\nAdditionally, Kazakhstan's section of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) has increased its throughput capacity from 54 million tons to 72.5 million tons per year. There are ongoing efforts to expand the Shymkent oil refinery to double its capacity from six to 12 million tons annually, which will adequately fulfill the domestic fuel and lubricants market demands.\n\nFurthermore, construction is in progress for new gas processing plants in Kashagan, Karachaganak, and Zhanaozen.\n\nThe report indicates that construction will commence this year on the Butadiene petrochemical project, valued at $1 billion. Additionally, projects to produce polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and carbamide, totaling $13.7 billion, are being implemented in the Atyrau and Aktobe Regions.\n\nKazakhstan successfully commissioned the Aksai South, Anabay, and Rozhkovskoye gas fields last year, which collectively hold over 31 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves.(Source:astanatimes)\n\nFurthermore, Kazakhstan has plans to launch several more gas projects in the near future, including Urikhtau Central in the Aktobe Region, Western Prorva in the Atyrau Region, and Kalamkas in the Mangystau Region. These projects are estimated to have recoverable reserves totaling 69 billion cubic meters of gas."
