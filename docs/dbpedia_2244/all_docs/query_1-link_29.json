Within the framework of the first phase, the commission of two wells in the Eastern Urikhtau field and five wells in the Central Urikhtau field are planned until December 2021.\n\nIn the case of successful completion of the first phase and favorable economic conditions, the possibility of implementing the second phase will be considered. The second phase oversees the operation of a total of 58 wells at the Urikhtau group of fields, as well as the construction of a number of production facilities.\n\nThe company said that in the case that the project is fully implemented, the expected production may reach up to 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas and 500,000 tons of oil annually. The recoverable reserves of the field are about 12 million tons of oil and over 40 billion cubic meters of gas.\n\nThe Urikhtau group of fields is located in the Mugalzhar district of the Aktobe region and includes the Central Urikhtau, East Urikhtau, and South Urikhtau fields.
