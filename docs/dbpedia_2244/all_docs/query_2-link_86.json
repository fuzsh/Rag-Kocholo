        "text": "After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia inherited the infrastructure that Central Asian states needed to transport energy out of the region creating excessive dependence on the Russian pipeline network and energy market. In the 1990s, the Central Asian states continued to barter energy with each other and Russia, in almost the same way as they did in the unified Soviet energy system. However, regional energy exporters’ dissatisfaction with the conditions of the energy trade dictated by Russia and the willingness of other external customers to invest in the construction of alternative pipeline networks transformed the relationships among state actors within the Central Asian energy system (CAES), which consisted of Central Asian Power System (CAPS) and natural gas pipeline networks. Shifts in the regional gas trading dynamics also affected electricity export–import relations among Central Asian upstream and downstream countries. As a result, two interlinked levels of relationships emerged that affect energy security of the Central Asian states: first, energy supply relations within Central Asia; and second, energy export/import between Central Asian producers and external customers. The latter perfectly lines up with the energy export diversification policies, which are being prioritized, to different extents, by all Central Asian states. However, limited research has been conducted on possible pitfalls of those energy policies. In this regard, the paper aims to analyze the impact energy export diversification policies have on the governments’ ability to ensure energy security in their respective countries.\n\nExchange of energy resources ensured the stability and reliability of energy supplies within the Central Asian Energy System (CAES) for many decades. While the CAES provided conditions for all Central Asian states to enjoy energy security simultaneously, it could not withstand recently emerged geopolitical and economic challenges. This policy paper studies competing energy policies that have led to fundamental disagreements over the water-energy nexus along with disputes over the price for fossil fuels, which in its turn to a different extent affected sufficiency of energy supplies and sustainability of the Central Asian energy sectors. The analysis shows that energy policies of the Central Asian countries focus on various initiatives to address energy security challenges, but do not prioritize intra-regional\n\nThe Central Asian energy system (CAES) represents a unique case in which — despite a long history of mutually beneficial cooperation — regional actors suddenly decided to pursue myopically self-interested energy policies. In the 1990s and early 2000s, coordinated operation of the national energy sectors ensured energy security for Central Asian states. However, isolationist energy policies focused on full self-reliance and self-control, without the establishment of self-sustaining independent energy systems, significantly compromised the security of the CAES. While most of the Central Asian states, since then, have succeeded in building a country-wide energy-transporting network, they still suffer, to differing extents, from excessive dependence on single sources of energy, lack of production capacity and seasonal variation of power generation. For example, Uzbekistan’s lack of a major gas field significantly limits the state’s ability to meet a fast-growing internal demand for energy. Authorities in Tajikistan have failed to utilize its possession of four percent of the world’s hydro power potential, because of water-energy nexus disagreements between upstream and downstream states in the region. The Government of Kyrgyzstan responded to energy insecurity by making a difficult decision to sell its strategic gas sector. In Kazakhstan, 80 percent of electricity is still generated by environmentally damaging coal-fired thermal power plants (TPPs). Turkmenistan may have to sell large quantities of gas to external markets at the expense of its domestic consumption. Apparently, without energy sector development innovations, securing sufficient energy supplies will be problematic. In terms of resource potential from fossil fuels and hydro power, as well as system-level energy governance, Central Asian states and Canada share similar characteristics. Canada has achieved remarkable progress in reducing energy loss through efficiency initiatives, engaging in mutually beneficial trade and developing a mechanism to coordinate provinces’ energy sectors. This paper looks at what Canadian best practices in energy security can offer Central Asian states to improve their prospects for energy security.\n\nCentral Asian countries are not only rich in energy resources, but also possess considerable energy production and power generation capacity, which could potentially be sufficient to meet their own domestic demands, and to some extent, external demands. The disintegration of the Central Asian energy system (CAES) caused intra-Central Asian energy trade to be compromised, forcing regional producers to look for alternative energy markets. Afghanistan, neighbouring Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, has turned into an attractive new energy market and a transit territory to transport gas and power to Pakistan and India. Currently, all three of these Central Asian countries (i.e. Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) export electricity to Afghanistan. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are also potential suppliers of gas. This paper traces the extent of the Central Asian energy exporters’ contribution to improving the level of energy security in Afghanistan. It analyses the stability and reliability of the energy trading dynamics within the framework of the following primary energy policies: a) Afghanistan as an end-consumer of Central Asian energy supplies, which also evaluates the challenge for all countries to enjoy energy security simultaneously; b) Energy self-sufficient Afghanistan, with a particular focus on the development of indigenous hydropower resources, which could potentially escalate water-energy nexus tensions with its Central Asian neighbours; c) Obstacles preventing Afghan authorities from taking full advantage of the country’s energy potential, in order to determine Afghanistan’s dependence on Central Asian energy supplies; and d) Afghanistan as an energy transit hub with limited contribution to the energy security of the country.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to study the role and impact of the world powers in Central Asia. The paper analyses the Central Asian countries - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan - in terms of their economic and trade cooperation with Russia, the United States of America and China, taking into account the impact of such developments like sanctions and labour migration. The study addresses both the national and supranational levels, as it features the mapping of the role of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Further, it addresses the engagement of the Central Asian countries in the international trade agreements and bilateral trade by providing an outlook of the most notable investment and bilateral projects and looks into the disputes that have arisen during the implementation of the said projects.\n\nThis report is the final outcome of a comprehensive desk study and a field research on the environment and energy nexus in Central Asia. This final report seeks to produce recommendations based on experiences and needs of the people of the region, supported by a fieldwork and in cooperation with the partners from inside the region. This report is composed of seven sections. After the first introductory section, the second section summarizes the scope and objective, and the third puts the research question and the methodology. The fourth section gives a summary of the approaches in the literature that assess environment and energy issues, including the nexus approach, and the interrelationship between the nexus and politics and economics. The fifth section outlines the major problems in Central Asia that can be assessed through the lenses of environment-energy nexus. Then, the sixth section explores the main approaches to address these problems on three levels, which are state-level, regional level, and international level. Finally, the seventh section provides a short conclusion and some policy recommendations for the stakeholders.\n\nHydroelectricity has always been a challenging issue for Central Asia since independence. Especially high amounts of water demand for the traditional cotton production in Uzbekistan has long made water one of the most valuable yet disputable natural resources in the region, along with hydrocarbon resources. This paper deals with the hydroelectricity in the Naryn River basin, shared by Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, and argues that the current status of the Soviet era electricity institutions, such as the Central Asian Power System, and infrastructure do not fully meet the demand of the basin countries, neither in terms of electricity, nor in terms of irrigation. Although the hydroelectricity-irrigation dispute can be technically solved by the completion of the Kambarata-1 project on the upper Naryn basin, mutual trust and cooperation among the basin countries are vital for a sustainable, effective and integrated energy system and market to be established in the region. Especially for the economic development of Kyrgyzstan, the accomplishment of the planned hydroelectricity projects and exporting electricity to the high-demand markets like China, Afghanistan and Pakistan in the south and east besides Central Asia is an important alternative. The support of third parties, such as the US or China is essential in this process.\n\nThe resource-sharing mechanism, which ensured sufficiency and reliability of energy supplies within the Central Asian energy system (CAES) collapsed soon after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Isolationist energy policies, both in terms of full self-reliance and self-control, without the establishment of self-sustaining independent energy systems, not only threatened security of energy supplies, but also, to a different extent, hampered the socio economic development in Central Asia. In an attempt to mitigate the negative impact of the new energy policies, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) was introduced as one of the key programs to ensure sustainable access of the population and economies to energy. One of the top priority areas has been strengthening regional cooperative dynamics in the energy sector. Primarily focusing on regional cooperation CAREC attempts to solve the problem of uneven distribution and seasonal variation of energy production in the region, assuming that this would lead to better standards of life and economic growth. This article aims to analyze the extent of contribution of CAREC energy initiatives to improve energy security and promote energy led economic growth in Central Asia through regional energy projects.\n\nCentral Asian energy sectors were designed in such way that turned regional state actors into interdependent units of a complex Central Asian Energy System. Resource-sharing mechanism ensured stability and reliability of energy supplies in the region. However, over the last decade the energy system has undergone significant transformation and the resource sharing mechanism could not withstand geopolitical realities. Disintegration of the Central Asian Energy System to a different extent affects the level of energy security in Central Asia. In an attempt to respond to energy insecurities several regional level energy mechanisms were put in place. Despite the fact that these mechanisms operate within a well-developed conceptual framework, they lack effective enforcement mechanism to implement regional level projects."
