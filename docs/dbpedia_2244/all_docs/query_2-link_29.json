        "text": "AZERBAIJAN, TURKMENISTAN DISCUSS JOINT EXPLORATION OF 'DOSTLUG' HYDROCARBON FIELD Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have engaged in discussions regarding the joint development of the 'Dostlug' hydrocarbon field. Azerbaijan's Minister of Economy, Mikayil Jabbarov and SOCAR President Rovshan Najaf have met with Deputy Chairman of Turkmenistan‚Äôs‚Äô Cabinet of Ministers Batyr Amanov, and his colleagues. The discussions focused on key aspects of bilateral energy cooperation, encompassing ongoing collaboration in energy exchange and joint exploration of hydrocarbon resources at the 'Dostlug' field. Additionally, they explored SOCAR's potential involvement in the development of other fields in Turkmenistan. A memorandum of understanding between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan for the joint exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources at the 'Dostlug' deposit in the Caspian Sea was signed on January 21, 2021. 'Dostlug' is the new name for the field, previously known as 'Kapaz' in Azerbaijan and 'Sardar' in Turkmenistan. Prior negotiations had been conducted for the joint development of this field. This oil and gas field, as assessed by SOCAR, could have its reserves confirmed using modern seismic exploration methods and possibly exploratory drilling. Addressing numerous technical and commercial considerations is essential for the ongoing development of this field. #SOCAR #Azerbaijan #Turkmenistan #oilandgas #qasequipment #oilandgas #caspiansea #drillig #oilplatform #gas #oil #energy #Azerbaijan #innovation #linkedIn #downstream #midstream #upstream #hydrocarbon\n\n„ÄêCNOOC Gas Discovery in South China Sea Estimated to Hold Over 3.5 Tcf„Äë CNOOC Ltd. said Wednesday Chinese authorities had approved the amount of proven natural gas in-place in the Lingshui 36-1 field near disputed parts in the South China Sea, an estimate of more than 100 billion cubic meters (3.5 trillion cubic feet). ‚ÄúIt is the first large-size ultra-shallow gas field in ultra-deep water in the world, which opens up a new area of exploration in deep waters‚Äù, the oil and gas exploration and production company said in a statement. After testing, Lingshui 36-1 has been shown to produce over 10 MMcm (353.1 MMcf) per day of absolute open-flow gas, said CNOOC Ltd., majority held by state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC). The field sits in the southern part of the Central Sag of the Qiongdongnan Basin at an average water depth of 1,500 meters (4,921.3 feet). Lingshui 36-1 is buried 210 meters (689 feet) deep, ‚Äúmaking it a typical ultra-deep-water ultra-shallow gas field‚Äù, CNOOC Ltd. said. With the new reserves, proven gas in the South China Sea has now exceeded one Tcm (35.3 Tcf), according to the company. CNOOC Ltd. said Lingshui 36-1 is the fifth large gas field discovered in the sea after Dongfang 1-1, Liwan 3-1, Lingshui 17-2 and Baodao 21-1. The fields are spread across the Pearl River Mouth, Qiongdongnan and Yinggehai basins. ‚ÄúThe South China Sea trillion-cubic-meters gas region has thus become reality‚Äù after decades of exploration, CNOOC Ltd. said. #CNOOC #China #NaturalGas #OilandGas\n\nLatest from World Oil (https://rb.gy/k5zlb3): - Ukraine's state-owned Naftogaz subsidiary, Ukrgasvydobuvannya, has made a significant gas discovery in the Carpathians, previously thought to be depleted. Exploratory tests from a drilled well indicate an impressive gas flow rate exceeding 200,000 m3 per day, a notable achievement for western Ukraine. Leveraging modern technologies, including the \"Ivan Bohun\" drilling rig, the find highlights the effectiveness of contemporary methods. The discovery has prompted further exploration, with a focus on applying new technologies and attracting investments to unlock the region's hydrocarbon potential. The operationalization of the well involves innovative data interpretation from seismic 3D surveys, contributing to rapid progress in pipeline construction and gas plant modernization. Lvivgasvydobuvannya specialists are enhancing local infrastructure to boost well productivity based on geophysical studies, expanding prospects for drilling new wells. The results of the test well will enable an estimation of the reserves in the new deposit. - #permex #permexpetroleum #oilprice #oildrilling #naturalgas #worldoil #OilWealth #Gasproduction #gasnews #oilnews #UkraineGas #Carpathiansl\n\nüöÄ Turkmenistan's Galkynysh Hotspot: A Major Gas Breakthrough! üåç I'm excited to share some remarkable news today. #Turkmenistan's supergiant Galkynysh hotspot, the world's largest onshore #gasfield, has achieved yet another commercial #gas inflow during drilling operations at well No.312. Here are the key takeaways: 1. Impressive Output: Well No.312 at Galkynysh is producing a daily output of 1.7 million cubic meters of natural gas, with expectations of a significant increase in this figure. In September 2023, well No. 238 produced a debit of 2.2 million cubic meters per day. 2. Vast Reserves: The combined reserves of this gas source, along with nearby fields, where the first stage of commercial development has been implemented, are estimated to be a staggering 27.4 trillion cubic meters. This forecast was made with the involvement of British consultancy GaffneyCline. 3. #Investor Interest: Turkmenistan is actively engaged in negotiations with international investors for the second and third phases of Galkynysh development. A \"breakthrough\" in this direction is anticipated in 2024, signifying the growing international interest in Turkmenistan's energy sector. 4. Long-Term Potential: With six stages of industrial development planned, Galkynysh has the potential to produce up to 200 billion cubic meters of gas annually. This significant output positions Galkynysh as a crucial source of gas supplies. 5. Global Gas #Supply: Galkynysh plays a pivotal role in supplying gas to China and serves as a potential feedstock base for the construction of pipelines connecting South Asia and Europe via the Caspian Sea. It's a key player in the global energy landscape. The progress at Galkynysh is a testament to Turkmenistan's commitment to energy development and its increasing importance in global energy markets. As we look ahead, the potential for expanded gas production and international collaborations in this supergiant field is truly exciting! üëâ Details ‚Äî http://dy.uz/8GXP3 #Turkmenistan #Galkynysh #GasProduction #EnergySector #GlobalSupply #InvestmentOpportunity üáπüá≤üõ¢Ô∏èüíº\n\nAccording to all companies who can came to Iran and could cooperation with Iranian company.

Firstly, the NOC has indicated that it will sign a new exploration agreement on the NC7 block in the Ghadames Basin at the next Libya Energy and Economic Summit. (The 2023 Summit, originally scheduled for November and now pushed back to early January, seeks to facilitate deal-signing on projects in Libya‚Äôs energy sector by both Libyan and international companies.) Interest in the NC7 block has been growing for some time, with reports that major international energy giants had been seeking to sign the exploration agreement for the block earlier in the summer. It is believed that the block contains oil and gas reserves, and the NOC is keen to see this potential explored. Secondly, the NOC has announced it will soon recommence factory operations at the Ras Lanuf Industrial Complex, including operations at its thermal cracking plant. Operations at Ras Lanuf have been suspended for over 12 years and this latest development stems from a plan, set up in 2019, to re-activate works at the complex. With the re-commencement of operations at the complex now almost complete, commentators expect it to facilitate sizable economic activity in Libya. Both developments are key examples of the NOC‚Äôs focus on increasing hydrocarbon input in Libya not just in the immediate moment, but for the years ahead. Should block NC7 prove to be fruitful ground for exploration, it will add to Libya‚Äôs hydrocarbon output on both fronts. Similarly, the recommencement of works at Ras Lanuf indicate the country‚Äôs re-emerging capacity to handle large amounts of hydrocarbon production in the long-term, as it scales up to become a major market in the global energy sector.
