On 11 December 2020, an official ceremony of bringing two wells into pilot operation at the East Urikhtau field took place in Aktobe Oblast. The ceremony was attended by Chairman of the Management Board of JSC NC “KazMunayGas” Alik Aidarbayev, First Deputy Akim of Aktobe Oblast Nurzhaugan Kalauov, Deputy Chairman of the Management Board, Exploration and Production, of JSC NC “KazMunayGas” Zhakyp Marabayev, and General Director of Urikhtau Operating LLP Amangeldy Taspikhov. During the field inspection, the delegation members visited the camp, well VU-1 and the booster pump station.

Note that the Resolution of the Investment Committee of JSC NC "KazMunayGas" (KMG) approved the implementation of the first phase of the Urikhtau project in May 2020. As part of the implementation of this phase, bringing into operation of two wells at the East Urikhtau field and five wells at the Central Urikhtau field is planned for December 2021.

In case of successful completion of the first phase and favourable market conditions, potential implementation of the second phase will be considered, which implies the operation of 58 wells of the Urikhtau fields group as well as the construction of a number of production facilities.

“In case of a full-scale implementation of the project, the expected production may reach 1.5 bln cubic meters of gas and 500 thousand tonnes of oil annually. Given that the recoverable reserves of the field amount to around 12 mln tonnes of oil and over 40 bln cubic meters of gas, I am confident that Urikhtau will take its rightful place in the KazMunayGas assets portfolio”, CEO of KMG A. Aidarbayev, noted.

The Urikhtau fields group is located in Mugalzhar District of Aktobe Oblast and includes the Central Urikhtau, East Urikhtau and South Urikhtau fields.

KMG is a founder and the only member of Urikhtau Operating LLP.
