        "text": "(I'd call them SPOILERS, but I don't think they spoil anything)\n\nOkay, let's start off by saying I don't think there's a studio production out there that a quarter way measures up to some of the better indies. And I always loved Corman and lower budget movies in general.(Even Mark Borchardt's COVEN) That love does not, however, extend to this movie.\n\nTo give the movie even more slack, I liked Brian O'Halloran's portrayal of Dante: a likable guy who I was actually rooting for, even as he is ready to dump a perfectly good girlfriend for a questionable one. I think the opening of this movie is great, and like pretty much any scene where it's Dante and his girlfriend. (The cigarette thing was really forced humor in my opinion)\n\nThen starts the march of the assholes, Randall and Jay (Silent Bob really isn't a character, so i'm not classifying him as either) Jeff Anderson, I guess, isn't such a bad guy, and I guess he is actually trying in this movie, but I spent the whole movie wanting something to happen which removed him from the plot. His scenes where he demonstrates his fixation with semen and penises don't even seem to be trying to be funny, except to Middle Schoolers who think the word \"shit\" is funny in any context.\n\nI wish most for two modifications to this movie: A. Kevin DOES use his robbery ending, B. he pegs Randall instead. Same for Jay. While Jason Mewes may have had a really horrid life (If what I heard about his mom from Kevin is true) that doesn't make his Jay character any more than the annoying bastard who you just want to leave. While I'm all for loading movies like KIDS with these guys, they aren't funny. And when you get down to it, it's no surprise to hear than he was stoned or drunk most of his performance.\n\nAs for the rest of the movie, Smith's allegedly brilliant dialogue is, i think, overrated. I can only guess it was called that because people think he's some kind of little guy. I think there's only one good line in the whole thing( it's from Randall), and that's only because I hate my dad too. (Well, Dante has some good ones, but they aren't funny)\n\nThe premise of guys at work just getting through a day, however, I find to be the best possible premise a movie could have, and I much prefer black and white film stock to color. (though there's not enough contrast in this movie)Incidentally, Smith can cram the cartoon that comes before the movie up his ass. (This might be because I've met people who have been molested, so I guess people will say I'm biased against having a good time)\n\nIn short, watch if you think cum is hilarious, don't care that a movie seems to be trying to be a lot of things without really being any of them, has a good premise it doesn't pursue, a few interesting characters scattered amongst endless ranks of unfunny schmucks, is in black & white and cheap.\n\n0 out of 0 found this helpful.
