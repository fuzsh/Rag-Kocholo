        "text": "What makes humour an honest and a direct communication tool for people? How do social networking and digital media transmit user-generated political and humorous content? Our research argues that the way in which humour is deployed through digital media during protest action allows protestors to assert humanity and sincerity against dehumanising political manipulation frameworks. Humorous content, to this extent, enables and is indicative of independent thinking and creativity. It causes contemplation, confronts the hegemonic power of the oppressor, and challenges fear and apathy. In order to conduct this research, we collected and analysed tweets shared during the Gezi Park protests. Gezi Parkı was chosen as the keyword since it was an unstructured and neutral term. Among millions of visual images shared during the protests, we concentrate on those that depict humour both in photography and video formats.\n\nHistorically, humour has been conceived of as a site of liberation and freedom – a free play of affect wherein the self can critically appraise the political conditions of its existence. Moreover, contemporary laudatory accounts of humour – specifically those associated with the incongruity tradition – have sought to tie humour to a liberatory political project that challenges authoritarian or oppressive governmental technologies in its very nature: in Revel with a Cause, Steven Kircher even goes so far as to argue that humour served as an essential form of dissent in postwar America. In this talk, I will map the ways in which humour has been tied to the expectations of liberal democratic society, from Jon Stewart to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, as a gauge of social tolerance and self-critique and how the reasonable subject of liberal society has thus become configured as a humourous subject. I will argue that the centrality of humour to the dominant liberal capitalist political configuration suggests that humour has come to play an increasingly central role in the political, as well as aesthetic, terrain of the current moment, but that the liberal understanding of humour fundamentally misconstrues the way in which it functions as a political force, underestimating its aggressive and even repressive force. Contrary to this dominant understanding, I will suggest that humour acts to discipline as well as liberate, and any rigorous examination of the political role of humour must take this into account. Given the importance of humour to the constitution of the ‘reasonable’ and sophisticated subject of the contemporary Western metropolis, I will then suggest that a better understanding of the cultural mechanics of humour is a vital part of any rigorous critical theory of the political potential of contemporary culture.\n\nThe study of mass social movements, and their influence on legal, constitutional, and political reform, has long preoccupied legal scholars. Bottom-up social revolutions, ranging from the Civil Rights Movement in the United States to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, are studied extensively in the literature. The traditional conceptions of social movements largely portray them as somber occasions that reflect the gravity of the moment and the seriousness of their objectives. This Article identifies and studies a novel pattern emerging from the social movements of the 21st century, providing a unique contribution to the burgeoning legal literature on the role of non-state actors in shaping legal and constitutional change. These new social movements — including the Arab Spring, the Occupy Wall Street movement, and the mass protests that took place in Summer 2013 in Turkey and Brazil — bear a counterintuitive ingredient in their conception and design: the ubiquitous use of humor. Although humor might appear to be antithetical to the somber nature of social movements, this Article argues, drawing on behavioral research and social movement theory, that humor can be an effective strategic tool to influence legal, constitutional, and political reforms. Humor can pierce the culture of fear prevalent in tyrannical regimes, serve as an effective coping mechanism against repressive government practices, and provoke government officials into reactionary conduct that furthers the social movement’s objectives. The use of humor can reframe and supplant the negative regime narratives of the movement and build solidarity among heterogeneous members of a movement with pre-existing sociopolitical differences. Humor can also support political mobilization by providing a low cost point of entry into a social movement, obtaining domestic and global resonance for the movement, and persuading others to join the movement by depicting an alternate, more appealing, reality. Finally, humor can provide an effective avenue for expressing popular discontent and undermine traditional methods for suppression employed by repressive leaders, including laws that criminalize and censor dissent and social mobilization.\n\nIn this contribution we will reflect on the Gezi events, which took place in Turkey in the summer of 2013. In particular, we will focus on the role of humor in the formation of a new political subjectivity by looking at some examples and by drawing on literature on humor and protest as well as on theories of humor in general. One of the core characteristics of the emerging Gezi Movement was that the vast majority of visual and verbal utterances were produced in a humorous manner, which did not prevent the protests from being militant or radical. We will argue that humor is not to be understood merely as a sideshow of protest, as a decorative element to the bemusement of the spectator. Rather, it provides a tool in the process of recomposition of the protesters as a group due to the specific mechanisms of de-escalation and affect redirection it involves."
