Does make mention of ‘126’ Army, meaning RCB, but even that is inaccurate as the numbers varied between 1970 and 1989 during the CIM68-89, and since. Imagery of the aircraft is useful; again a strong RAAF bias plays down the presence of RMAF troops and aircraft. Of some value beware of the strong (retired) RAAF bias not shared by the Army who deployed to protect the base.

Narrative in English\n\nIn the 1970s communist guerrillas (CTs) from the Malayan Communist Party settled in the Piyamit Hills in Thailand near Betong in a one kilometre tunnel to hide from air raids and use as a shelter and store. After the surrender of the Malayan Communist Party (The Haadyai Peace Accord) in 1989, the CTs settled down here through the courtesy of the Thai government. A signboard at the tunnel reads: “The Piyamit Tunnel is the Malaya Communists’ base build for bombshells and storing food supplies. The battlefield bases are located on the mountain top in the midst of the deep forests which separates the boundaries of Thailand and Malaysia covered the area of Yala Provinces. The Piyamit Tunnel was built in 1977 with the length of 1 km and 5-6 feet wide. It took three months for excavation of 50 hard manships and there are 9 entrance exit paths.” This is the last bastion for the CTs against whom Australian troops of Rifle Company Butterworth defended the Air Base Butterworth, Malaysia.
