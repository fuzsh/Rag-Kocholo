        "text": "What's next for Batman and the \"Clerks\"?\n\nWill ink-on-paper comic books go the way of the pterodactyl?\n\nThere were no hard-and-fast answers, only educated guesses from people in the know, at the third Asbury Park Comicon held at Convention Hall in the city on Saturday.\n\nThe event, which celebrated a medium in its 80th year, underscored the comics' wide inclusiveness — artists and writers of all ages and statures greeted the public — as well as New Jersey's unique connection to the screen adaptations of iconic comic-book characters.\n\nOn a clear, sunny day that suggested spring had finally arrived, the effects of Hurricane Sandy were still apparent — plywood and barricades dotted the boardwalk — but Asbury Park looked very much like a city on the mend.\n\nA replica of the 1966 Batmobile sat in the Grand Arcade in front of the Convention Hall entrance as patrons, some in costume, filed in. \"Star Wars\" and Batman-related characters were the most popular; the glow of lightsabers was inescapable. Most unusual costume: a dog dressed as Captain America.\n\nOutside the adjacent Wonder Bar, where convention panels were held, stood Ming Chen and Bryan Johnson, two stars of AMC's reality show \"Comic Book Men.\" Chen and Johnson were mulling the possibility of a third season for the show, which is executive-produced by filmmaker Kevin Smith, a Red Bank native, and taped at his Red Bank comic shop, Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash.\n\n\"I'm crossing my fingers,\" said Chen. \"I had fun doing it. I want to do more. People think: Can I take more abuse? Can I get made fun of more? The answer is yes.\"\n\nChen said TV fame hasn't changed his life, until Johnson reminded him: \"You got into this comic book show for free.\"\n\nChen was an early spotter of the Internet's interactive potential; in the mid '90s, his work came to the attention of Smith, whose breakthrough was the raunchy made-in-Jersey comedy \"Clerks\" (1994).\n\nHe recalled: \"I made a 'Clerks' fan site. I was really, really freakin' bored one day. He popped into an Internet cafe and saw it and gave me a call. Anyone can do that now.\"\n\nBut how many people could do it then?\n\n\"Anyone could have done it then,\" Chen said. \"But he just saw it. I got lucky.\"\n\nAdded Johnson: \"You had to have that meager of a social life in order to do it.\"\n\nSaid Johnson of the \"Comic Book Men\" phenomenon: \"I'd say I've finally got the perfect job. I couldn't craft a better occupation for myself. All I have to do is make fun of my friends and joke around.\"\n\nChen seems confident that web comics will not supplant printed comic books. \"I don't think print will ever die,\" he said. \"Nah, they'll still exist.\"\n\n\"I don't know about never, though,\" said Johnson. \"When you have this generation, and then the next generation, and then the next generation, it just has to peter out eventually. Until everyone is, like, 'Why are we knocking down trees, when we can just send it to your tablet?' And who even knows what a tablet is going to be? It'll be, like, inside your eye or something. I'm glad I'll be dead. I don't want that kind of future.\"\n\n\"I don't like that Google Glass crap, no,\" said Chen (referring to portable web eyeglasses currently in development).\n\nEven though, Chen was told, he helped push the whole web thing along.\n\n\"I did. I'm guilty,\" Chen said, dropping his head in mock remorse.\n\nInside the hall, writer-artist Evan Dorkin (\"Milk and Cheese\") pondered the demise of printed comics.\n\n\"The newspaper strips have been moribund for a long time,\" Dorkin said. \"Print is obviously on the way out. I don't think it's going to disappear. I hope not. It's what I prefer. But the web is the 'wild west.' Clearly, newspapers have moved to it. All the syndicated stuff is up on the web. New Yorker cartoons are up on the web.\n\n\"I think it's going to be less than 10 years before it's the dominant form, if it isn't already. There are very successful web strips out there. That's where the most popular work is in comics right now.\"\n\nCartoonist John Holmstrom co-founded Punk magazine in the pre-Internet '70s. Does he believe digital advancements have helped young artists get noticed?\n\n\"I think it's a tough time for any aspiring cartoonist or artist, because the money's not there,\" Holmstrom said. \"If you're not getting paid for your work, you're not a professional. So then, everybody's an artist. But if everybody's an artist, then nobody's an artist.\n\n\"I think there will always be something printed. One of my favorite analogies is: If digital came first, and then they invented the printing press, the novelty of it would be so appealing that everybody would want everything printed. There's something about the portability and the permanence of print that's better than digital.\"\n\nJim Salicrup, formerly of Marvel Comics, is the editor-in-chief for Papercutz, a publisher of all-ages comics such as Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys and its biggest seller, LEGO Ninjago. Despite Papercutz' youthful demographic, Salicrup believes there is hope for printed comic books.\n\n\"Kids still seem to want to have something they can touch, something that's indestructible,\" Salicrup said. \"If they drop it, it doesn't break and cost their parents a lot of money. So for us, we're going to keep doing print, but we're excited about digital as well. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nThe Asbury Park Comicon boasted some guests who are considered legends of the medium.\n\nArtist Allen Bellman, 88, drew Captain America and the Human Torch for Timely (later known as Marvel) Comics during the so-called \"golden age\" of comics in the 1940s. The Florida resident once lived in Asbury Park and Ocean Township. \"It's like coming home,\" Bellman said of travelling north for the convention. Bellman has used the Internet to reach a new generation of fans who dote on golden-age comics. \"I'm very busy,\" said the artist, who draws commissioned artwork of his old characters for paying fans.\n\nAlso on hand was artist Al Jaffee, 92, creator of Mad magazine's long-running \"Fold-In\" and \"Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions\" features. Jaffee has drawn 430 Fold-Ins since the feature began in 1964, and said he is at work on another.\n\nArtist Herb Trimpe is the founding artist of Wolverine, the claw-wielding superhero portrayed four times onscreen by Hugh Jackman. When Trimpe first drew Wolverine in 1974, did he ever dream the character would have such longevity?\n\n\"Nobody had dreams,\" Trimpe said with a laugh. \"We were working deadlines. Maybe we were dreaming about the check. Wolverine was basically a throwaway. It was a secondary character. Sometimes they might go on for a few issues, and sometimes you might never hear from them again.\n\n\"I happen to be lucky to be connected with characters — the Hulk, Wolverine and some licensed characters like Transformers and Godzilla and G.I. Joe — stuff that other people didn't want to do, because they weren't really cool. But they wound up making movies out of them. So I benefitted quite a bit from that, and from having the connection to Wolverine.\"\n\nArtist Jay Lynch, an East Orange native, was part of the underground comics movement of the late 1960s. The irreverent, barrier-busting comics drawn by Lynch, Robert Crumb and others introduced sex, drugs and self-expression to the medium. Was it truly a movement? Or a bunch of unconnected artists who had the same idea at the same time?\n\n\"Well,\" Lynch said wryly, \"I think it had to do with LSD.\"\n\nLynch later penetrated the mainstream by illustrating \"Wacky Packages\" and \"Garbage Pail Kids\" stickers and cards.\n\nUp-and-coming artists included Stephanie Buscema, illustrator of \"My Little Pony\" comic books (and granddaughter of the late Marvel Comics artist John Buscema). Has Buscema encountered the so-called \"Bronies\" — grown men who love \"My Little Pony\" and attend \"Pony\"-themed conventions? (Mainstream reaction to the Bronie phenomenon has been, shall we say, on the judgmental side.)\n\n\"I have to be honest,\" said Buscema. \"I did Ponycon last weekend (in Brooklyn), and they are some of the nicest people I've ever met. It's like any fandom, from 'Trekkies' on. Everyone is very kind.\"\n\nWhit Taylor is the writer-artist of \"Madtown High,\" her self-published comic book set in a thinly disguised version of Madison, where Taylor grew up. Her artwork looks like it was drawn by a high-school girl — in a good way — which lends it undeniable charm and speaks to the anybody-can-play inclusiveness of comics.\n\nThe heroine of \"Madtown High\" is Wren, a grunge-loving high-school girl in the late '90s whose friends tend to make fun of deserving parties, especially teachers. Wren also struggles with the occasional unrequited crush. The stories are part autobiography, part fiction, according to Taylor.\n\n\"She (Wren) represents me,\" Taylor said. \"I use auto-bio to express myself and hopefully connect with others. The comics medium is growing more and more by the day. It's a good way to address things like literacy and exploring different cultures.\"\n\nAnd what of that movie scuttlebutt?\n\nActor Brian O'Halloran, who spent his teens in Old Bridge, starred as Dante, harried manager of a Leonardo convenience store, in Kevin Smith's \"Clerks\" and its 2006 sequel, \"Clerks II.\" O'Halloran's current projects are \"Miss December\" (a straight-to-DVD horror comedy with Gilbert Gottfried) and a web series about a New Jersey-based community theater.\n\n\"Then,\" O'Halloran added, \"there's always the mystery of: If Kevin finishes, and we start working on 'Clerks III.'\"\n\nSo, there are whispers about a \"Clerks III\"?\n\n\"It's no longer whispers,\" O'Halloran said. \"Kevin tweets it out all the time. He is literally, as we speak, in the process of finishing the script now.\"\n\nMichael Uslan, a Jersey City native who grew up in Ocean Township, is the executive producer of the Batman movies. Uslan was asked how the caped-and-cowled avenger — who made the ultimate sacrifice for Gotham City in the 2012 film \"The Dark Knight Rises\" — will return to the screen. Perhaps in the rumored Justice League movie, which would team Batman with colleagues Superman and Wonder Woman?\n\n\"Everybody's kind of waiting to see what happens,\" Uslan said. \"Hopefully, everyone will enjoy (the Superman movie) 'Man of Steel' this summer. And then, who knows what will follow? Stay tuned.\""
