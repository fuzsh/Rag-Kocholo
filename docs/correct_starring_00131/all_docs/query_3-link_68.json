        "text": "Although a subscription to HBO Max may be more bang for your buck, HBO remains one of the top premium cable channels. Why? It’s all in the name: Home Box Office. HBO has gone out of its way to land major motion pictures soon after they hit theaters. It also has the advantage of being able to draw directly from the rich film library of Warner Bros. Pictures, as well as a selection of movies from other studios. Plus, the multiple HBO channels curate the movies for you, so you can just turn on the TV and watch something. But with our newly updated list of the best movies on HBO right now, you don’t have to wait to make your plans.\n\nLooking for more to watch on HBO? We’ve got guides to the best movies on HBO Max, the best HBO series, the best shows on HBO Max, and more.\n\nRecently added to HBO\n\nDon't Worry Darling\n\nr 2022\n\nRaging Bull\n\nr 1980\n\nPredator\n\nr 1987\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\n\nr 1996\n\nDon't Worry Darling (2022)\n\n48%\n\n6.2/10\n\nr\n\n123m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Mystery, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nFlorence Pugh, Harry Styles, Chris Pine\n\nDirected by\n\nOlivia Wilde\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nIf your first response to Don’t Worry Darling is “what the heck is going on?!”, then you’re in good company. Alice Chambers (Florence Pugh) is wondering the same thing. Alice and her husband, Jack (Henry Styles), are among the residents of Victory, a town that is run like a cult of personality by Frank (Chris Pine). As Frank and the men work on the Victory Project, Alice and the other women are expected to tend to their homes and be grateful housewives. But why don’t the pieces of their lives fit together or make sense? When Alice can no longer ignore these questions, she slowly discovers the alarming truth behind Victory.\n\nDon't Worry Darling | Official Trailer\n\nRaging Bull (1980)\n\n89%\n\n8.2/10\n\nr\n\n129m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, History\n\nStars\n\nRobert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci\n\nDirected by\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nRaging Bull is widely regarded as one of the finest American movies ever made, and it earned Robert De Niro an Oscar for Best Actor. Director Martin Scorsese thrillingly adapts the real story of Jake LaMotta (De Niro), a boxer who fought some of the all-time greats in his sport, including Joe Lewis (Coley Wallace) and Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes). But Jake’s most important battles happen outside of the ring. Jake’s self destructive streak destroys his first marriage and threatens to derail his aspirations of ever becoming a world champion. The ending of the movie is also quite famous, and you may realize that you’ve already seen it parodied without realizing where it came from.\n\nRaging Bull Official Trailer #1 - Robert De Niro Movie (1980) HD\n\nPredator (1987)\n\n47%\n\n7.8/10\n\nr\n\n107m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Action, Adventure, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Elpidia Carrillo\n\nDirected by\n\nJohn McTiernan\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nThey say that “in space, no one can hear you scream.” But in Predator, you’ll be hearing plenty of screams in the jungle. Arnold Schwarzenegger solidifies his status as an action star as Major Alan “Dutch” Schaefer, the leader of an elite group of soldiers sent by the CIA on a mission in South America. Just as Dutch and the others start questioning the nature of their mission, they find themselves being hunted by a being not of this world. The Predator (Kevin Peter Hall) makes quick work of Dutch’s men, which leads to a one-on-one battle for the ages.\n\nPredator (1987) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn (1996)\n\n48%\n\n7.2/10\n\nr\n\n108m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Action, Thriller, Crime\n\nStars\n\nGeorge Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel\n\nDirected by\n\nRobert Rodriguez\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nQuentin Tarantino wrote and co-starred in director Robert Rodriguez’s From Dusk Till Dawn. Fittingly, this movie starts out like a crime story with bank robbers Seth (George Clooney) and Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the run from the law. To sneak into Mexico, the Geckos take a pastor, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu), as their hostages. But once they arrive at their destination, the Fullers and the Geckos must make a desperate alliance when they come face to face with actual vampires.\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn Official Trailer #1 - (1996) HD\n\nElvis (2022)\n\n64%\n\n7.6/10\n\npg-13\n\n159m\n\nGenre\n\nMusic, Drama, History\n\nStars\n\nAustin Butler, Tom Hanks, Richard Roxburgh\n\nDirected by\n\nBaz Luhrmann\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nIf you’re looking for a 100% historically accurate biopic, you won’t find that in Elvis. What you will get is a wildly entertaining film with a star-making turn from Austin Butler as the legendary Elvis Presley. Director Baz Luhrmann frames the story around Elvis’ complex relationship with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks), the man who helped make Elvis a music icon. You can expect to see this flick get a lot of attention around Oscar time. And now it’s available on both HBO and HBO Max for anyone who missed it earlier this year.\n\nBaz Luhrmann’s ELVIS | Official Trailer\n\nHot Tub Time Machine (2010)\n\n63%\n\n6.4/10\n\npg\n\n101m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Comedy, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nJohn Cusack, Lyndsy Fonseca, Collette Wolfe\n\nDirected by\n\nSteve Pink\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nHot Tub Time Machine is what we call a “high concept comedy.” The title is the premise. After Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) nearly loses his life, his estranged friends, Adam Yates (John Cusack) and Nick Webber-Agnew (Craig Robinson), plan to take Lou on a trip to Colorado to recreate a vacation they enjoyed as kids. While accompanied by Adam’s nephew, Jacob Yates (Clark Duke), the four accidentally dump an energy drink on a hot tub that somehow sends them back in time to their youth. Now inhabiting their younger bodies, Adam, Lou, and Nick try to maintain history as they know it despite the temptation to change their lives.\n\nHot Tub Time Machine Official Trailer #1 - Craig Robinson Movie (2010) HD\n\nAirplane! (1980)\n\n78%\n\n7.7/10\n\npg\n\n88m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nRobert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Leslie Nielsen\n\nDirected by\n\nJerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nIf we were to simply tell you the plot of Airplane!, you might confuse it for an actual drama. Instead, it’s one of the silliest movies ever made, and an all-time great comedy that is filled with sight gags and hilarious dialogue. Robert Hays stars as Ted Striker, a former military pilot who is so traumatized by his war experience that he can’t fly any longer.

Rosamund Pike portrays Colvin on-screen as the film follows some of her most memorable journeys into countries that were torn apart by civil war. Colvin pays a very high physical price for her bravery and determination, and she doesn’t back down from danger. There is a very tragic element in her story, but also many reasons to celebrate her life and what she stood for. This film stands as a tribute to that.\n\nA Private War Trailer #1 (2018) | Movieclips Trailers\n\nUnder the Skin (2014)\n\n80%\n\n6.3/10\n\nr\n\n108m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Science Fiction, Drama\n\nStars\n\nScarlett Johansson, Jeremy McWilliams, Lynsey Taylor Mackay\n\nDirected by\n\nJonathan Glazer\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nIs it a stretch to cast Scarlett Johansson as a beautiful woman?

The alien feels no emotion as she watches her victims die … at least until she faces an unexpected sensation of empathy.

All Bruce wants is a cure for his condition, but Betty’s father, General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross (William Hurt), basically wants to dissect Bruce’s body so he can create a new generation of super soldiers. And the prospect of gaining superhuman strength is a little bit too appealing to the General’s top operative, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (2008) Official Trailer - Edward Norton, Liv Tyler Movie HD\n\nA Shot in the Dark (1964)\n\n70%\n\n7.4/10\n\npg\n\n102m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Crime, Mystery\n\nStars\n\nPeter Sellers, Elke Sommer, George Sanders\n\nDirected by\n\nBlake Edwards\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nA Shot in the Dark is the second film in the Pink Panther series, but don’t worry.

That said, this movie is worth rewatching for Robin Williams’ quietly terrifying performance as Seymour “Sy” Parrish. On the surface, Sy is a harmless older man who becomes attached to the Yorkin family because he has developed their photos for years. So much so that Sy imagines himself as a member of the family. But when Sy discovers that Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan) is cheating on his wife, Nina (Connie Nielsen), he takes extreme steps to protect “his” family regardless of the consequences.\n\nOne Hour Photo (2002) Official Trailer #1 - Robin Williams Movie HD\n\nAmerican Splendor (2003)\n\n90%\n\n7.4/10\n\nr\n\n101m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nPaul Giamatti, Hope Davis, Judah Friedlander\n\nDirected by\n\nShari Springer Berman, Robert Pulcini\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nGet ready for a comic book movie like no other.

The real Harvey Pekar periodically appears to comment on the story of his life, as Harvey meets his future wife and collaborator, Joyce Barbner (Hope Davis), before they face his cancer diagnosis together. The movie is a true story, and a number of Harvey’s other friends and family appear as themselves in addition to the actors who play them on screen.

Eight years after the Joker’s defeat, Batman is gone, and Gotham City is a very different place. However, the arrival of Bane (Tom Hardy) forces Bruce Wayne to come out of retirement, as a sinister plan uses the Wayne family fortune to finance the utter destruction of Gotham itself.

But this dramatization of a real story features a powerhouse performance by Redford as Henry Brubaker, the new warden of Wakefield State Prison. Henry even goes undercover in his own prison to get a better look at the rampant abuses and corruption within. Henry is like a force of nature who refuses to look away from the graft and the horrific conditions.

Anna Kendrick stars as Beca Mitchell, a young first-year student at Barden University. Beca’s singing ability quickly draws the attention of the Barden Bellas, the university’s female a cappella group. However, Beca butts heads with the Bellas’ leader, Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp), which jeopardizes the group’s national championship hopes.\n\nPitch Perfect - Trailer (HD)\n\nDunkirk (2017)\n\n94%\n\n7.8/10\n\npg-13\n\n107m\n\nGenre\n\nWar, Action, Drama\n\nStars\n\nFionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Tom Hardy, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles\n\nDirected by\n\nChristopher Nolan\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nChristopher Nolan’s Dunkirk is based on a true World War II story. In the aftermath of the Battle of France, thousands of British soldiers were stranded on Dunkirk as German troops advanced. The film follows the rescue effort by sea and by air. But back in Dunkirk itself, soldiers Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and Alex (Harry Styles) find danger at every turn. The first few rescue attempts are disastrous, and even the rescuers are in danger. Not everyone is going to come home from this mission.\n\nDUNKIRK - OFFICIAL MAIN TRAILER [HD]\n\nIndependence Day (1996)\n\n59%\n\n7.0/10\n\npg-13\n\n145m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nWill Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum\n\nDirected by\n\nRoland Emmerich\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nIndependence Day is not necessarily great cinema, but it excels as a popcorn action flick that took theaters by storm in 1996. Arguably, it was the film that made Will Smith a movie star, thanks to his turn as ace fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller. But the real stars of this movie are the aliens themselves and the destruction that they leave in their wake. This is a disaster film dialed up to 11, and we still get goosebumps from President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) as he delivers a speech for the ages.\n\nIndependence Day: Resurgence | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX\n\nHigh Fidelity (2000)\n\n79%\n\n7.5/10\n\nr\n\n113m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama, Romance, Music\n\nStars\n\nJohn Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Tim Robbins\n\nDirected by\n\nStephen Frears\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nPop quiz: What are your top five favorite John Cusack movies? Chances are good that High Fidelity is on that list. That’s fitting because Cusack’s Rob Gordon loves making top five lists all throughout the movie. Poor Rob also loves Laura (Iben Hjejle), but not as much as he loves music. With his relationship on the rocks, Rob tries to figure out how he can improve himself. Regardless, the real joy in the movie comes during the moments when Rob just can’t help embracing his inner music geek. The man’s got good taste!\n\nHigh Fidelity (2000) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers\n\nTour de Pharmacy (2017)\n\n71%\n\n7.1/10\n\ntv-ma\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, TV Movie\n\nStars\n\nAndy Samberg, Orlando Bloom, Freddie Highmore, John Cena\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nAfter the success of 7 Days in Hell, a mockumentary about a legendary tennis match between two fictional idiots, the Andy Samberg-led team earned a second go-round via HBO. The result? Tour de Pharmacy, a story that spoofs the Tour de France by focusing on competitors’ use of performance-enhancing substances in the early 1980s. Samberg returns to play Nigerian rider Marty Hass, while Orlando Bloom, Freddie Highmore, Daveed Diggs, and John Cena appear as the other made-up competitors. Tour de Pharmacy is filled with classic slapstick comedy, and the concept is bolstered by the inclusion of several veteran actors — we won’t spoil the hilarious surprises here — who play the “modern-day” versions of the film’s protagonists. Lance Armstrong’s cameo doesn’t hurt, either.\n\nTour de Pharmacy: Official Trailer (HBO)\n\nClerks (1994)\n\n70%\n\n7.7/10\n\nr\n\n92m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nBrian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes\n\nDirected by\n\nKevin Smith\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nClerks was the film that famously launched the career of writer and director Kevin Smith, who also co-stars in the movie as Silent Bob alongside Jason Mewes’ Jay. While Jay and Silent Bob became staples of Smith’s later films, Clerks belongs to Brian O’Halloran’s Dante Hicks and Jeff Anderson’s Randal Graves. Dante and Randal’s banter showed off Smith’s gift for dialogue, but it also allowed them to be more than just Smith’s pop culture sounding board. The duo justifiably have contempt for their dead-end jobs, but they don’t necessarily appreciate the good things they do have. It’s a hard lesson for Dante to learn, but he does get the point in the end.\n\nClerks Official Trailer #1 - (1994) HD\n\nBirds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) (2020)\n\n60%\n\n6.1/10\n\nr\n\n109m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Crime\n\nStars\n\nMargot Robbie, Ewan McGregor, Rosie Perez, Mary Elizabeth Winstead\n\nDirected by\n\nCathy Yan\n\nWatch on HBO\n\nIntroduced to the role in 2016’s critical bomb, but commercial home run, Suicide Squad, Margot Robbie gets another turn as fan-favorite Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey. Told from Harley’s smart but certifiable point of view, Birds of Prey shows us how Harley goes from being the spurned lover of Gotham’s Clown Prince of Crime, to forgetting her “puddin'” and becoming her own gun-toting, butt-kicking self. Along the way, she gathers a team of former cops, killers, and super-powered singers to help her face down the endless criminal hordes of Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), aka Black Mask. McGregor is perfect as the brutal Sionis, who’s just as twisted as Harley or her ex-boyfriend, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is another standout as the lethal vigilante Huntress.\n\nImage: https://www.hbo.com/movies/birds-of-prey-and-the-fantabulous-emancipation-of-one-harley-quinn\n\nBIRDS OF PREY - Official Trailer 1\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nBlair Marnell has been an entertainment journalist for over 15 years.
