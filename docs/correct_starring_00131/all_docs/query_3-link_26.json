        "text": "Everybody, including their past childhood nightmares, is talking about the latest remake of IT which is getting rave reviews from critics, us here at Screen Geek, and fans of the Stephen King novel. With the release, sites across the web have been shelling out their top favorite Stephen King adapted films in the form of many diverse and interesting lists. We could follow the crowd by doing the same thing – and we did several weeks earlier – but we decided to put our own list together of films that you might want to check out if you want more clown in your diet.\n\nSlap on that creepy white makeup, put on that red nose, and grab onto some balloons while you inform you of some creepy clown movies that you might enjoy.\n\nBlood Harvest (1987)\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to see singer Tiny Tim portray a killer clown – look no further than Blood Harvest from 1987. Tiny Tim takes on the role of the Marvelous Mervo, a murderous clown who invades a small town in his only film role. Throughout the movie he kills a variety of people, and it’s done to quite a shocking degree. This movie really has its roots in the exploitation genre.\n\nMervo consistently sings throughout, bringing a sinister sense of style to his clown performance. And we all know how creepy his music is; after all, it was used in Insidious. And the death scenes are all just as disturbing. This is a truly unique clown horror film, if not just for Tiny Tim’s striking appearance; so seek it out if you dare and give Blood Harvest a watch! – Jacob Dressler\n\nClown (2014)\n\nClown was one of those movies that flew under the radar went it hit cinemas, but was something that should’ve been given proper recognition. The concept of the film was somewhat original with a bit of flare of classic horror tropes. The story follows Kent, a regular average Joe that throws a birthday party for his son. When the clown he hires fells to show up, Kent is fortunate enough to find an old clown costume to dawn on and win father of the year award. What slowly unveils is the notion that the clown costume might be cursed and begins to turn our dad in a nightmarish monster ready to eat anyone it deems fit.\n\nThe film was directed by Jon Watts of Spider-Man: Homecoming fame – you read that correctly – and it took a different spin on the idea of a killer clown. Plus, this was a movie that had Eli Roth’s backing as well; say what you will about that man’s directing he does have an eye for interesting films. Give it a watch and see what Marvel and Sony saw in this director’s past work. – Mark Salcido\n\nKiller Klowns from Outter Space (1980)\n\nKiller Klowns From Outer Space is a wonderful example of creativity, comedy, horror, and a mix of the three that could only work in the 1980s. The film functions as a parody of 1950s science-fiction horror films, focusing on a small town and its teenaged inhabitants shortly after an object falls from space. The concept was used in dozens of films, The Blob being the most notable example.\n\nKiller Klowns is unique, however, with the way it executes the idea. Rather than show your generic alien monster, it gives us the very human designs of clowns and warps them into disturbing caricatures. The titular Klowns come from space with one specific goal – to get a bite to eat. In other words, they kidnap humans, wrap them in cotton candy cocoons, and drink their blood through crazy straws.\n\nThe practical effects used to bring these Klowns to life are outstanding, built and operated by the Chiodo Brothers who also wrote and directed the flick. There are also plenty of outrageous sets inspired by circuses and carnivals, but the movie always plays it straight and makes you feel immersed in this zany world.\n\nIf you’re looking for a good movie with killer clowns, you’ll find nothing with more fun than this. –Jacob Dressler\n\nVulgar (2000)\n\nVulgar is a movie that really has you say, “What the hell?” after credits begin to role. The film was directed by Comic Book Men’s very own Brian Johnson when he decided to follow his friend Kevin Smith into the film industry. The film circled around Brian O’ Halloran who played “I’m not even suppose to be here today” Dante from Clerks. The very low budget film is a somewhat disturbing tale of revenge set behind a dark comedy.\n\nO’ Halloran’s plays Will Carlson, a man in his 20s that barely gets by as a birthday party clown for kids. When he decides to change his profession from kid’s party clown to bachelor party clown, that’s when all types of things go wrong for him.\n\nThe film screams a 90s VHS independent flare that was well suited for its time. The story also featured many characters from Kevin Smith’s View Askewniverse like Jason Mewes, Bryan Johnson himself, and even Kevin Smith as charismatic gay TV executive. Just a word of caution: The movie is pretty messed up and should be shielded from the eyes of all children. So, have a grand all time watching Vulgar.– Mark Salcido\n\nGacy (2003)\n\nThough 2003’s Gacy isn’t a great film (by any means) it’s definitely one that will keep you interested due to its bizarre nature and subject matter – all of which is true.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with John Wayne Gacy, he was a notorious serial killer that would dress up as a clown – but would also murder teenage boys and bury them in the crawl space underneath his house. And he didn’t just murder a few, he murdered 33 people between 1972 and 1978.\n\nSo it’s not exactly a good movie, but if you’re in the mood to feel uncomfortable the rest of the night knowing that this crazy stuff actually happened, this is your movie. – Frank Palmer\n\nHouse of 1000 Corpses (2003)\n\nRob Zombie’s directorial debut, House of 1000 Corpses, opens with a bang to say the least.\n\nIt starts off with a Quentin Tarantino-esque dialogue between Sid Haig’s creepy clown character Captain Spaulding and what appears to be a regular customer at his macabre museum/gas station. The two are interrupted by a pair of robbers, who eventually are killed in self-defense by Spaulding and one of his assistants.\n\nWe later come back to Captain Spaulding and his gas station when a group of teenagers stop in for fuel. The crazy clown gives them a tour on his “Murder Ride”, and the kids get the idea to look for Dr. Satan, an infamous killer from the area who disappeared decades prior.\n\nThis sets the rest of the film into motion, and we only see bits of Spaulding in between and at the very end. His character isn’t properly explained until the sequel, but the few scenes we do get are rather brilliantly performed. His character fluently transitions between creepy and hilarious, a trait that could only be so easily done by actor Sid Haig.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for a scary clown among a variety of other creepy individuals – with a Halloween backdrop no less – then look no further than Rob Zombie’s House of 1000 Corpses. – Jacob Dressler\n\nIT (1990)\n\nWell, it wouldn’t exactly be a clown list inspired by IT without Tim Curry’s version would it?\n\nThough the 1990 miniseries (yes, it’s a film list, but this is essentially a film when you watch it as one) isn’t without its problems, Curry’s performance definitely holds up and is an interesting one to watch.\n\nThe movie itself, however, is very dated and features some questionable acting and effects. If you can look past some of that, then you’re in luck, because Tim Curry definitely carries the miniseries with his iconic portrayal of Pennywise The Clown. It’s definitely one of those things you need to watch, just because. – Frank Palmer\n\nWhat do you guys think of our list? Are there any other clown films you guys want to share with us?
