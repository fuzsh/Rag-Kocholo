        "text": "Grading the Franchise is a recurring feature at Cinecaps Digest where I review an entire film series. Today, it’s the working-class comedy Clerks series.\n\nRegular readers may be exclaiming, “Hey, didn’t you just tackle Clerks on Cinecaps a week or so ago??” That I did, but that was just the first film, and before I got sidetracked with piracy on Talk Like a Pirate Day, I was planning on getting to this one promptly.\n\nThe original Clerks was the moviegoing world’s introduction to Kevin Smith, a newcomer working on a microbudget to deliver a word-of-mouth indie success story which promised a fresh and funny talent in the 90s DIY scene. Many of the decade’s rising scenesters were video store kids (none more clearly defined than literal ex-video store clerk Quentin Tarantino), and they brought with them a hyper-literacy of film and geek culture; not necessarily the techniques and aspirations, but the language and the reference points. The dudes from Clerks could talk about Star Wars and reference Steven Spielberg flicks and scoff at mindless junk like Navy SEALs all day long. After all, what else were they going to do? Give people good service? Work hard for minimum wage? Try and care? Please.\n\nClerks was actually the third film from Smith I saw, viewed shortly after my brother’s friend brought copies of Mallrats and Chasing Amy to our house. I got hooked pretty quickly, enough so I eagerly anticipated Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Although Amy narrowly remains my preferred film in the writer/director’s canon, Clerks remains the funniest, and as hard as I may laugh at times at his later work, it’s not even close. All of his (good) films are highly quotable, but Clerks is the one I can repeat with the most length and exuberance (and cheerful vulgarity: “In a row?”).\n\nAs noted, I already reviewed the first Clerks, but Smith had the inspiration for two more, each one spaced out more than a decade from the previous chapter. Interestingly enough, they sort of represent the three phases of Smith’s filmmaking career. The first one was unpolished but brash, the work of someone clearly hungry and inspired. The second was slicker and more commercial (and not in the begrudging fashion of Mallrats), its story beats more conventional. And the third had ambitions but got lost in the reeds, yearning to please fans but insistent on pushing the material in unexpected (and often unsuccessful) new directions. Most of his other movies released close to each film bear similar trademarks, so as Brian O’Halloran’s Dante and Jeff Anderson’s Randal get older and change onscreen, so, too, does Smith in real life.\n\nWhere Kevin Smith’s career goes from here is anyone’s guess, but based on how Clerks III ends, I think it’s safe to say the trilogy has been wrapped up. Despite diminishing returns, I have a lot of affection for the series. Again, you could say the same in terms of how I feel about the man.\n\nClerks (1994)\n\nDirected by Kevin Smith. Starring Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonauer, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith. [R]\n\nFrom debuting writer/director Smith, this black-and-white 16mm indie comedy made on a shoestring budget (approximately $27,000, by most estimates) proves you don’t need movie stars or studio resources to make a sharp, very funny film whose cult fandom comes quite close to bleeding into the mainstream. It’s a day in the lives of a couple of Jersey retail workers—convenience store clerk, Dante (O’Halloran), and video store clerk, Randall (Anderson)—as they deal with a variety of customer types, frustrating and/or comedic encounters with acquaintances, “random” interludes that move the action to the roof and an (offscreen) funeral, a couple of drug dealers hanging around outside the store (Jay and Silent Bob, played by Mewes and Smith), and Dante’s indecision toward his “comfortable” current girlfriend (Ghigliotti) and an “exciting” former flame (Spoonauer). No real plot, just a string of observations, conversations, and misadventures, many of them as profane as they are hilarious, although it’s too eventful to really feel like an authentic slice-of-life; I won’t refute its humorous shock value, but did they really need to include the, ahem, necrophilia episode? (If for nothing else, it makes Dante’s love-life conundrum too easy for him to solve.) Terrific soundtrack ranges from Alice in Chains’ “Got Me Wrong” and Soul Asylum to the Jesus Lizard and Supernova’s “Chewbacca”; reportedly, the cost to secure the rights to the songs ended up costing more than the film’s actual production! Launched Smith’s “View Askewniverse” of recurring and interconnected characters, inspired an animated TV series, and spawned a couple of sequels with over a decade separating each chapter.\n\n83/100\n\nClerks II (2006)\n\nDirected by Kevin Smith. Starring Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Rosario Dawson, Trevor Fehrman, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Jennifer Schwalbach, Zak Knutson. [R]\n\nAbout a decade has passed since the last “day in the life” of two Jersey boy clerks, and since their old haunt, Quick Stop, burned down a year back, they’re stuck working at a fast food restaurant. Dante is about to move to Florida to get married, and Randal isn’t happy about it…but then, maybe Dante’s not all that happy about it either, especially considering the flirtatious “friendship” he has with his manager (Dawson). Kevin Smith has softened the edges of his outrageous film debut for this sequel, which often feels like Clerks filtered through the more cartoonish and commercial energy of Mallrats or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back; there’s still some envelope-pushing material here (Kinky Kelly, anyone?), but even those episodes feel like inauthentically manufactured bits instead of random episodes breaking up the drudgery of paper-hat retail work. Some of the new characters, like Schwalbach’s overbearing fiancée or Fehrman’s oddball virginal nerd, are (intentionally?) off-putting, but even in “cuddly stoner mascot” form, Jay and Silent Bob still score a few laughs…just don’t play “Goodbye Horses” in their vicinity. Lacks the intelligence and provocative insights of the original, but it’s enough fun for an okay viewing…still, even hardcore fans of the first film will probably grow restless over how long it takes Randal to get to the point in the jail cell scene, or scratch their heads over how a brief choreographed dance sequence set to the Jackson 5 ended up in this all-too-slick second helping. Features the usual grab-bag of cameos from Smith semi-regulars (Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Ethan Suplee) and random famous faces (Wanda Sykes, Kevin Weisman).\n\n57/100\n\nClerks III (2022)\n\nDirected by Kevin Smith. Starring Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Trevor Fehrman, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Rosario Dawson, Austin Zajur, Amy Sedaris, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Jennifer Schwalbach. [R]\n\nDante and Randal, now middle-aged and running the Quick Stop from the original Clerks (the video store next door has turned into a marijuana dispensary improbably run by Jay and Silent Bob), are still up to their old tricks, but a health scare causes Randal to seek out a new purpose in life, and he decides to turn all of his crazy stories from a lifetime spent as a retail employee into a motion picture. As is typical of this self-reference-heavy movie, that means he’s basically making/recreating Clerks almost thirty years after the fact, but his co-star and longtime-“sidekick” isn’t as devoted to the vision, still struggling to cope with the loss of his girlfriend and unborn child many years ago. Kevin Smith clearly made this third chapter as a love letter to his fans—and many of his fans will appreciate such reciprocated affections—but the reconciliation of its tonal shifts from dumb comedy to sappy tragedy and back again is so forced, it borders on the amateurish (surely, Smith has learned a thing or two over the last thirty years as a dick-and-fart-jokes-loving auteur, right?), and the script is so busy trotting out the callbacks, catch-ups and cameos, it almost never finds the time to actually be funny. The nearly ubiquitous presence of Fehrman’s weirdo nerd from Clerks II doesn’t help; even more so than the last one, he’s more odd and irritating than amusing. Features appearances from several View Askewniverse alumni, along with several other famous faces (Sarah Michelle Gellar, Fred Armisen, Anthony Michael Hall, etc.). Dedicated to the late Lisa Spoonauer, who played Caitlin Bree in Clerks.\n\n44/100\n\nCheck back in a few days for the next update!"
