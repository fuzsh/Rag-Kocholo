        "text": "Time travel is one of the most marvelous creations of human imagination that is still fascinating to this day. It makes us fantasize about going back in time to experience important historical events to perhaps alter them or to correct some myths surrounding them. Such a concept is not new to fiction and even real life science (e.g. Albert Einstein‘s theory of general relativity). Yet an idea that traversed a lot of peoples minds which is quite underexplored in film is going back to the past and fixing personal mistakes. This is exactly what an underrated 1998 German thriller “Run Lola Run” analyses within its plot: what can be changed to alter the past for a brighter future and how can it be done?\n\nThe plot is fairly simple. It starts off with the main character Lola, portrayed by Franka Potente. She and her boyfriend Manni, played in the film by Moritz Bleibtreu, are involved in illegal drug trafficking. When her partner accidentally leaves a bag full of 100.000 Deutschmarks (about £70.000 in today’s currency) in a metro, Lola is left with no choice but to come up with such a sum of money in 20 minutes or her boyfriend gets killed. The story takes us through different scenarios of the same amount of time and shows her bumping into random strangers whose lives are indirectly impacted by how she bumped into them during her tiring sprint. Each storyline, while consisting of the same idea, takes different minor turns while still having Lola meet the same characters over and over again. It reminds the audience of a sort of “Groundhog Day” scenario where Bill Murray has to relive the same day over and over again, however, Lola is reliving those crucial 20 minutes in order to find a perfect ending to the intense situation. The simple premise, however, does not save the film from the confusion and fatigue it gives the audience by showing audience so much information in a short amount of time. I am not sure if Tom Tykwer, the director and writer of the film, wanted this to be intentional as to make the viewer relate to Lola’s confusion and constantly racing mind, but it definitely is a film that cannot be fully understood just through one sitting because of all the subtleties it shows. Yet, if anything, it is enjoyable to watch every outcome and try to think for yourself where she went wrong on her run and what can be fixed in order to achieve a ‘happy ending’. This intense action is accompanied by an intense techno soundtrack, something that was culturally impactful to Germany during that period of time. It adds to the discomfort and stress to the plot that makes every shot of her sprinting incredibly intense.\n\nAs far as acting goes, it is a mixed bag. The performances given by Franka Potente and Moritz Bleibtreu are stellar. It is enjoyable to watch them react to the hardship they are going through and the pressure they feel of their main enemy – time. Even though their choice of making ends meet is definitely not something to cheer for, the film still makes the viewer feel sympathy for what Lola and Manni are going through. I do not think anyone wants to end up in such a horrific situation, so their discomfort here is portrayed incredibly well, especially on Franka Potente’s part, because we see her confront incredibly heartbreaking situations while having to rush to save her boyfriend’s life. It is enough to give anyone a panic attack, so it makes the audience relate to the character much more. However, apart from the old lady she confronts at the beginning of her 20 minutes, the other characters do not really stand out that much. It is a shame, because if the viewer got to see some more emotion on the other characters, it would have made the plot much more intense. However, despite bumping into them multiple times, they do not get fledged out more for an audience to feel love or hate for them, it just sort of sits in the middle. Yet I guess it is incredibly difficult to do so when the majority of the film shows Lola running and breathing heavily. If there is one character that could have gotten better treatment, though, it should have been the gangster who Manni was supposed to deliver money to. We see him a lot in the film through one of the brief encounters that Lola impacts on her way, yet we do not hear him speak, react or do pretty much anything except ‘look threatening’ (I use the word ‘threatening’ very loosely here), which makes the plot lose its impact at times. If one of the main villains is not even scary, then why be so scared of him?\n\nNow, one of the main stars of the film is its cinematography. Apart from the bird’s-eye view and establishing shots, the audience is exposed to a lot of subtle semiotics. For instance, on a ‘bad ending’ run, Lola runs past through houses with red window frames and gets money put in a red bag, indicating a certain doom. Where as on a better ending, she runs past green window frames, gets money put in a green bag and so on and so forth. A lot of these subtleties are also seen when bumping into characters and seeing their fates change by how she reacts or the way she bumps in. We see them in quick jump cuts of their not so distant future, yet the audience can see that if their lives are affected in a better way, Lola’s own run becomes more and more lucky. It is beautiful to watch and, if anything, makes the viewer want to watch the movie a second time to see how did her interaction made their lives go that specific way.\n\n“Run Lola Run” is a film that should be watched by everyone that is interested in open-ended and non-linear stories. What seems at first as an edgy thriller soon transforms into a beautiful narrative that challenges the audience’s memory, creativity and eye for details. It will leave you replaying the films events in your head long after you have finished watching it, even making you think up of perhaps better, different ways that those 20 minutes could have been used.\n\nDid you ever had a day in your life where every single thing was just going wrong? Did you ever think that it is going so bad that it is almost like your twenty-four hours is like a comedy? Well, you should have written it down then and you might have had something like “Clerks” – a 1994 independent comedy about a particular day like this. The film that is about everything and nothing at all at the same time, a motion picture that invites the viewer with its casual and comforting setting, but ends up taking that person on an incredibly crazy day of its life by introducing crazy characters; awkward, unusual situations and unforgettable dialogue. So how did I get here, reviewing this film? I’m not even supposed to be here today.\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that this should be a prime example of how to make a motion picture with an incredibly low budget. It was written and directed by Kevin Smith (“Mallrats”, “Dogma”, “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back”) – an unknown name back then, but one of the most famous comedians today. The plot is simple, yet brilliant – something that a low budget movie should always aim for. It stars Brian O’Halloran (“Mallrats”, “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back”) and Jeff Anderson (who is known for the same films as Brian) as Dante and Randal – two clerks who work in stores that are a few feet away from each other. Dante gets called by his boss to come to the shop on his day off and he agrees to do it until 12:00 of that day. As he arrives to the place, it is there where this satisfying trainwreck begins. As I have already mentioned, the plot is written beautifully and simplistically. Most of it takes place in Dante’s store with Randal hanging out there and the two of them having all sorts of random conversations about anything. The dialogue here is incredible and feels natural – like something two close friends would discuss. Anything from over analysing the plot of “Return of the Jedi” to tricking one of them into confessing his trial and error of fellating himself. It is brilliant and incredibly funny – something that a lot of films can not be as they age because humour always keeps evolving as time goes by. Watching these two banter in order to solve their problems or just to get through their boring day is nothing short of magical. The reason behind this is because it feels relatable. We have all been in these situations where we are so bored of our minds that we come up with such nonsensical, Tarantino-esque dialogue. Yet the day gets anything but boring. The customer shorts are nothing short of insane – they make our characters question their viewpoints on life, teach them things they might not have known before, or, just simply annoyed. It is always funny either way, and that is what’s so brilliant about it. Being a film that was made in the early 90s, it radiates all the most memorable things about the decade: “cool kids” clothing, primitive technology, and my favourite, the incredible 90s rock soundtrack with bands like “Alice In Chains” and “Bad Religion”.\n\nThe performances are quite well in this film. It’s not giving the audience anything groundbreaking, yet it does not need to. Brian O’Halloran’s character almost always reacts angrily to the situations he finds himself in due to the fact that he had to work on his day off. Randal, on the other hand, is a complete opposite of Dante, who acts relaxed and is not concerned much about anything in life. These roles were acted out pretty fine – they really felt genuine since characters would sometimes stutter like people do in real life. Not always, however, because one particular scene at the beginning felt unnatural due to the actors talking instantly after another without taking a pause as if they were doing a fast reading. And, considering that Dante was looking at his notebook and Randal was reading a newspaper, it would not be surprising if it was just that. The supporting cast also provide a great performance. The most notable characters were Jay and Silent Bob, portrayed by Jason Mewes and by Kevin Smith himself. These characters are a portrayal of stereotypical youth: they swear to seem cool and they talk about sex, drugs, alcohol and partying while engaging in a hedonistic lifestyle. However, they serve a completely different role towards the end, which gives them more meaning in the whole essence of the film. Their ridiculousness and laid-back attitude made them incredibly popular to the point where they appeared in almost every single Kevin Smith production ever made; got their own spinoff film and even starred in cartoons that were made due to the box office success of “Clerks”. The only negative about the performances is the fact that Dante’s girlfriend Veronica, played by Marilyn Ghigliotti, alongside his ex-girfriend Caitlin Bree, played by Lisa Spoonauer, give pretty mediocre performances. They were not terrible, but they were not memorable either, and also felt as if they were reading the script instead of actually trying to act. Also, some of the minor characters that we see act too similar to each other, to the point where I actually mixed up one of Dante’s unnamed friends with Jay. Yet these minor things are not enough to ruin the film and its atmosphere and can only be counted as a minor nuisance.\n\nOverall, “Clerks” is an underrated film that everyone should check out. What it lost in its recognition due to the fact that it came out only 5 days after Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction”, it regained in a cult following, sequels and cartoons. If you want an easy, laid-back and a funny watch, this is definitely a film to be checking out – not only because of its comedic value, but also to appreciate the culture of the 90s and its campiness.\n\nThere are three types of memorable films. The first type are the undisputed masterpieces, where the acting is solid, the plot is innovative and well written and the visuals are unforgettable. Then we have the historically significant films: the ones that debuted some sort of an interesting camera technique, plot device or was the first of its kind to do something that would later become a cliché. The third type are the so called “so bad it’s good” films: the kind of pictures that do everything completely opposite that the “undisputed masterpieces” did, yet somehow achieve a cult following by the people that view it ironically. The motion pictures that do get forgotten by time are the ones that do not fit into any of these categories: the acting is bad in an unamusable way, the plot makes the viewer want to watch the paint dry, it does not innovate in any way (if anything, each one is innovatively more boring than the other),it is a visual bore from start to finish and it becomes extremely dated almost the year it is released. The movie “Taxi” falls under the latter forgettable film category, and, even though it is only 1 hour 26 minutes long, it feels like an eternity.\n\nThe sad thing is, the concept itself has potential. You have an incredibly professional driver who owns a simple looking Peugeot automobile that can turn into an unsafely fast speed machine by the press of a couple of buttons and a change of the steering wheel. So the question stands: how did Luc Besson, one of the great names of modern cinema, could come up with such a vile script filled with boring characters and even more boring dialogue? I do not have an answer to this, and I am afraid that we never will. The film stars Samy Naceri as Daniel Morales, a man who just quit his job as a pizza delivery man in order to become a taxi driver. Now, usually in my reviews I mention some of the films that the actors are known from, but as I have checked the IMDB page of the “Taxi” cast, their careers did not go anywhere past this film, so I will leave it at that. Daniel (played by a 37 year old man at the time) has just quit his job as a pizza delivery man in order to become a taxi driver. He keeps showing off his super vehicle to his customers and soon gets busted by a police officer called Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec, played by Frédéric Diefenthal. Émilien offers Daniel a deal: either he takes away his drivers license for good, or Daniel uses his driving skills to help him catch a gang of bank robbers called “Mercedes Gang”. You would think that a car that can transform into a super vehicle within the matter of seconds would be the most unrealistic thing in the film, but it does not even come close. The most mysterious thing is how incredibly unfunny the jokes are. For instance, in the beginning of the film, Émilien is taking a practical exam for his drivers license when he crashes the car he is driving into a butcher shop. The examiner is going nuts about his carelessness when suddenly Émilien pulls out his badge and the teacher suddenly becomes apologetic. The fact that a police officer should still be respected after endangering the lives of the person next to him and the butcher in the shop is not only completely humourless, it shows that the writer treats his audience as if they were kindergarteners. And every time the plot tries to bring in some comic relief to take the audiences minds away from the action, the jokes become more and more childish than the previous one told. They are unfunny at best and extremely uncomfortable at worst. The only thing that is decent in this film are the action scenes. It is satisfying to see Daniel’s taxi transform into a super vehicle for the first time, and the fast paced driving scenes are very well shot. The audience usually sees the cab speeding through the road from the behind, which makes each scene quite intense to look at. This is also enhanced by the reactions of the people who are either riding as a passenger or noticing the car from the distance. It really makes it feel like an almost invincible creation that is above anything else. The stunt scenes are also fierce and very well done, so the film strives in the action part of its “action-comedy” genre.\n\nSo the question stands: “How did this film become such a box office hit?”. I am afraid that I have no answer, though we can only guess. The 90s was a weird period in terms of blockbusters, so the same question can be asked about films like “Junior”, “The Matrix” and “Anaconda”. My best guess would be Luc Besson’s name in it and the audience’s thirst for fast car racing films. “Taxi” came out three years before the first “Fast and Furious” picture and the latter franchise is still going strong to this very day. To this day, “Taxi” remains one of the most profitable French film franchises of all time and it is simply mind boggling. I know that the film most definitely is not meant to be taken seriously, yet even if I tried to shut off every brain cell in my head and just enjoy it even a little bit, it would still be nothing but face palm after face palm.\n\nIn summary, avoid this film at all costs. Even if you just want to relax with your friends and watch a cheesy picture, you could find loads more flicks that would satisfy your needs. “Taxi” has definitely not aged well (not that it was ever in touch, not even for the 90s), and the fact that it spawned four more sequels (the most recent one being “Taxi 5”, released in 2018), an American remake and even its own spinoff TV show on NBC is my contestant for the “8th wonder of the world”. This is a film that should be buried deep below the ground and left to be rot and forgotten by time.\n\nA lonely carriage drives on an empty road towards what seems to be an abandoned castle. The passenger looks frightened before he peeks his head out only to notice that the driver is a giant bat. We see the image that is now as iconic as apple pie or The Beatles crossing Abbey Road: The Bran Castle. The 1931 film “Dracula” is one of the most iconic and one of the best horror pictures in history. With its shocking imagery, iconic tropes, pop culture influence and controversial screening, this feature is an absolute blast to watch from beginning to end.\n\nThe plot of “Dracula” is based on Bram Stoker’s book of the same name. It follows Count Dracula, played by one of the most famous actors of all time, Bela Lugosi (“The Raven”, “The Black Cat”, “Glen or Glenda”), trying to move from his castle in Transylvania to Carfax Abbey, which is located in London. However, since he arrived, strange deaths keep appearing around the area, all of whose victims bear two strange marks on their necks. Fearing that the old folklore of the vampire may be true, Professor Van Helsing, played by Edward Van Sloan (“Frankenstein”, “The Mummy”, “Dracula’s Daughter”) utilizes his knowledge of these mythical creatures and tries to stop these unexpected horrors. I have not read the original book, but from what I know, the plot follows it closely, which makes it a great adaptation of the novel. What it does best, however, is capture the atmosphere that Bram Stoker described in his work. During the film, the viewers see lots of creepy spiders, spider webs, incredible close ups of insects and even armadillos for some reason. I have not really seen such detailed shots of animals in old features before, and they really add to the uneasy feeling the story portrays.\n\nThe acting in the film is the definition of incredible. Bela Lugosi really seems as if he was born for this specific role: from the Hungarian accent that he speaks, the fancy tuxedo he wears, all the way to the disturbing dead-eyed stare he keeps giving throughout the motion picture. His performance is truly unnerving, even 88 years later, hence why his image is always associated with Dracula in pop culture. The supporting cast also gives an incredible act. Dwight Frye (“Bride Of Frankenstein”, “Frankenstein”, “The Maltese Falcon”) plays Mr. Renfield – the solicitor of Count Dracula’s new purchase. His performance easily matches, if not succeeds, that of Lugosi’s. I do not want to give too much away about his character, but his drift to insanity and creepy laughter is truly the stuff of nightmares. It sends chills down the viewer’s spine due to how disturbing and realistic it sounds. Edward Van Sloan’s performance is also executed really well, given that he has to perform a character who is German. He easily adapts the broken accent and intellectual posture of Professor Van Helsing, which gives a feeling of safety to the audience whenever he is on screen. I do not know what else to add without repeating myself, but given the fact that during “Dracula’s” original screening multiple ambulances were waiting outside for any viewers that might faint from being too scared, I think the performances really speak for themselves. And faint they did, though the exact number of the blood sucker’s off screen victims is unknown.\n\nNow, no film is truly perfect, and “Dracula” definitely does have its own flaws. One of the main things that I did not like about it is its runtime. Only clocking in at 74 minutes, the length of the film would probably be considered that of a short film. I do not know whether that was intentional just in case the audiences of the time would not be able to handle it, but it definitely leaves you wanting for more substance, especially when its spiritual predecessor “Nosferatu” was longer, and therefore, was able to tell a more detailed story. Another problem that I found is the rest of the supporting cast. Their acting was definitely great, but the issue lies within their screen appearances. I found that Dracula’s neighbours were not shown that much or given any real character and it made them very forgettable to the point where I can not remember their names even if my life depended on it. The only really memorable character was Ms. Mina, and that is only because her name got repeated in almost every sentence during the third act. And last, but not least, the ending was very anti climatic. I am not going to give away too much, however, I will tell you that it was building up to a very big showdown between Dracula and Van Helsing, and then, before you even know it, it just ends and the film’s credits roll. I feel like this treatment gives the plot a great disservice for what it tried to achieve by scaring the ever living hell out of its viewers. However, I think its flaws can be forgiven, considering that the film was very innovative for its time, especially since films with sound was a new thing and they were still called “talkies”.\n\nOverall, “Dracula” is one of the best and one of my personal favorite horror films of all time. Its atmosphere alone can be incredibly unsettling even if you watch it without any sound, and the performances of Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye is nothing short of nightmare material. Even though it’s not too gory, I would definitely not recommend showing this to kids just because “it’s old, so the scary parts are very dated”. That is simply not the case here, and that’s why I love it. Despite its flaws, it was a very original movie for its time, spawning a plethora of not only great horror films, but the concept of “shared universe” with other “Universal monsters” in later films – a gimmick that is used by Marvel comic book films today. This is definitely a film that you should watch this Halloween, if not for interest, then at least out of respect for how it changed the horror film scene back in the day.\n\nDuring the Classical Hollywood era, one of the most popular genres of film in the theatres were Westerns. Nothing else really speaks of the mid 20th century cinema of the United States like the clanging of horse hooves whilst riding fast in the desert, the dirty clothing of the residents of a small desert town, the excessive use of the revolvers and the loud ringing of the bell that just hit 12 o‘clock sharp followed by the sound of gunshots from the dueling cowboys. While this image may be quite stereotypical, the 1962 film “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” is anything but. Even though the story follows the cliché imagery of the Western genre, it differs from the period by criticizing the society of The American Frontier instead of romanticizing the primitiveness and violence that it is known for.\n\nThe film stars James Stewart (“Vertigo”, “Rear Window”, “Anatomy Of A Murder”) as Ransom Stoddard: a fresh out of school lawyer travelling through the western part of the U.S as he is suddenly robbed by the notorious hoodlum Liberty Valance, played by Lee Marvin (“The Dirty Dozen”, “Paint Your Wagon”, “The Professionals”). During the robbery, Ransom is heavily injured by Liberty, and is later brought to the town of Shinbone by a cowboy called Tom Doniphon, portrayed by the legendary John Wayne (“True Grit”, “The Alamo”, “El Dorado”). From there on in, the main character decides to avenge Liberty Valance by taking him to jail, yet he finds that the Wild West does not understand the definition of law.\n\nThe plot of the film, written by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck, does feature interesting insights of the American Frontier society. We as viewers see the confusion and disgust of Ransom Stoddard for the lack of order in the town of Shinbone. We meet the cowardly and hated town Marshal, the always drunk newspaper editor and the illiterate and scared townsfolk who are constantly terrorized by Liberty Valance and his gang. This unpleasant image inspires Ransom to educate Shinbone and make them stand up for themselves by ways of the law, dismissing the violence that everyone is used to. Yet Tom Doniphon is always the one to remind him otherwise: that in this part of the country, the bullet of a gun is judge and jury and that there is nothing it can be done to change this perspective. This serves as great commentary on the often overlooked idolization of violence of the Western genre. Instead of showing a grand adventure with cowboys, saloon fights, petty criminals and gunshots, the film puts the viewer in the perspective of a nonviolent man: a person, who in many ways, represents the law-abiding modern-day citizen. We see him trying to solve the problems he is facing by using logic and peace, which, in my opinion, makes Ransom Stoddard relatable to the viewers, because we also solve problems this way instead of reaching for the gun. This contrast between a lawful man and the unlawful town he finds himself in shows the audience that the Wild West is a scary place where every breath a person takes could be his last.\n\nThe acting in “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” is pretty hit or miss to be honest. On one hand, you have James Stewart, one of the greatest actors of all time, best known for his work with Alfred Hitchcock, as well as John Wayne, the absolute definition of a cold-blooded cowboy. The performances from these are actors are as stellar as you would expect, with both of them being able to show a wide range of emotions through the incredible dialogue they speak. Also, this is the first film where John Wayne started to use his famous catchphrase “pilgrim”, which is nowadays associated with every Western movie role he plays. However, the other performances are not as memorable, and, most of the times, downright cheesy. We see Vera Miles (“The Searchers”, “Psycho”, “The FBI Story”) playing Hallie: Tom’s love interest and the caretaker of Ransom. She’s not a bad actress per say, but her performance was really downplayed in this film. She gets very little dialogue and her character seems to only serve as the love interest and nothing more: not a rare occurrence during this period of Hollywood movies. Sure, she gets angry and tries to express her opinion, but every single episode like that ends up in John Wayne calming her down. As for the rest of the cast, their performances have not aged too well and are really downright annoying at times. For instance, Andy Devine (“Robin Hood”, “Stagecoach”, “How The West Was Won”) plays the town Marshal Link Appleyard, who is supposed to be an incredibly cowardly man. He established his fear of taking action at the beginning of the film by speaking in a squeaky voice and walking in an unmanly manner, but his stupidness gets really unbearable after a while and it starts to feel just lazy. I do not know if the screenwriters thought his character would be funny that way, but it really was not and I was praying to see less and less of him each scene. That being said, at least the main villain of the story, Liberty Valance, feels pretty threatening to the audience and I generally felt uncomfortable every time I saw his signature whip that he was always carrying. It also felt weird to see Lee Van Cleef playing one of his goons with minimal dialogue, considering the importance of his role later on in The “Dollars” trilogy: arguably the greatest Western films of all time.\n\nOverall, “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” is definitely an important watch for someone who has not heard of it and is a fan of Western genre, or for someone who is looking to get into it. It tells a different tale of the American Frontier that is not typically seen in this category of films and will leave the viewers quite surprised because of its themes. While the supporting casts acting can be quite cheesy at times, do not let it scare you off of one of the most underrated Hollywood films of its era.\n\nImagine this. A sunny day in a small American town where the sun is shining, beautiful flowers are growing and the whole neighbourhood is living in peace. However, just underneath it, right under the grass, filthy beetles are laying there, digging everything around. This juxtaposition of images is none other than the opening scene of “Blue Velvet”: a tale that seems innocent at first, but becomes much more twisted as it progresses.\n\nThe film stars Kyle MacLachlan (“Dune”, “Twin Peaks”, “The Doors”) as a young man named Jeffrey Beaumont, who, after finding a dismembered ear in a vacant lot, decides to take on the mystery of the crime. However, he finds that real life mysteries and crimes are not as exciting as described in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, as he keeps getting himself into trouble, nearly escaping death and meeting some very colorful characters along the way. The film’s director is the now well known, winner of this year’s Academy Honorary Award for his lifetime work, David Lynch. During “Blue Velvet”, we do not see many of his well known movie quips (probably because this was his third film only), however, they are there, and are just as confusing as they are creepy. As far as visuals go, Lynch completely nails in showing viewers the colorful scenery of the American suburbs, the bleak industrial sites and the overall Americana style that, as he mentioned in his interviews, adores very much. And rightfully so, no viewer would be blamed if they thought that the film was set in the 1950s as we do get an insight to the decade through the world that surrounds the characters: from the American diners and cars all the way to the film’s soundtrack, which also does not shy itself away from more modern tracks at the time, composed by the incredibly underrated Angelo Badalamenti.\n\nThe plot of “Blue Velvet” is also something that Lynch (who is also the screenwriter of the film) should be commended for. Considering the fact that he had concepts of it since 1973 (4 years before his first film “Eraserhead” came out), the story is very good. It blends the genres of psychological horror and neo-noir so well that the viewer will never get prepared for the switch between those two, rather he will get sucked right into it without any warning and may come out shocked. If there are any complaints for the plot, it would definitely be the sometimes unintentionally unnatural behavior of the film characters. Particularly, some of the scenes with Jeffrey and Detective Williams, played by George Dickerson (“Death Warrant”, “After Dark, My Sweet”, “American Playhouse”), felt quite unrealistic of how a professional police detective would react to the evidence brought to him by a teenager. Another thing that bothered me is the relationship between Jeffrey Beaumont and his love interest Sandy Williams, played by the now famous Laura Dern (“Jurassic Park”, “Wild At Heart”, “Star Wars Episode VIII”). It felt quite unnatural from her side, as if her love was forced by Lynch just so the plot could move on. Now, whether or not that was intentional, I have no idea, and it does make sense from the perspective of Jeffrey. However, it was not a big issue for the film, and if anything, it was cute to watch.\n\nAnother thing to address about “Blue Velvet”, which is somewhat hit or miss. I am not sure whether or not some of the bad acting was intentional, though I would not be surprised, considering David Lynch likes to put bad actors in his films on purpose so that the viewer would feel uncomfortable watching it. However, main lead Kyle MacLachlan gives one of his best performances here. He can be a cheery teenager when the day is going well for him, and he can give an amazing performance of a traumatized person when he experiences awful things. It shows the audience that the incidents he saw really shook him down to his very core and makes us feel really bad for him. On the contrary though, I feel that Laura Dern’s performance was a bit lackluster. In the film, she is supposed to be a shoulder to cry on for Jeffrey, yet the audience needs to be constantly reminded that the reason for it is because she gave him some of the details for the case. Another lackluster performance I saw was from one of the main suspects of the mystery in the film, Dorothy Vallens, played by Italian actress Isabella Rossellini. Now, it is weird enough that a woman with an American name would speak in a heavy Italian accent, but the fact that the highlight of her performance in the film is asking “Who are you? Why did you come here?” in a shaky voice really speaks for itself. It probably sounds like I do not enjoy the acting in this film at all, which could not be further from the truth. By far, the best performance throughout “Blue Velvet” comes from the criminal boss Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper (“Apocalypse Now”, “Easy Rider”, “Speed”). The character he plays is so mentally insane that everytime you see him on screen, it gives you a swarm of uneasy emotions. Frank is one of the most unpredictable people I have seen in cinema, and his insane dialogue and facial movement really adds to the psychological horror aspect of the film. Back in 1986, audiences never saw characters like him, and, in my opinion, we still have not seen anyone get even close to his obnoxiousness. Though Hopper’s performance has inspired other filmmakers, especially Quentin Tarantino, to write unpredictable characters with obnoxious dialogue in their movies. One of the most recent examples I can remember is the film “Killer Joe”, and, if you have seen the film, you will know just what I am talking about.\n\nOverall, “Blue Velvet” is a one of a kind film that can pull in its viewers into the insanity it offers without any warning. It does have its flaws, however, its strengths easily outshine all the problems, and you are guaranteed to have a great time watching it. If you have never seen or heard of it before, or you are looking forward to get into the filmography of David Lynch, this is a perfect start that shows the director’s love for semiotics, Americana setting and creepy, unexplainable characters.\n\n1980s. Miami. A setting so known in pop culture that it does not even need an introduction. In the midst of all the craziness comes “Scarface”: an almost 3 hour remake of the 1932 original that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout it’s runtime. While many movies of its era suffer from pop culture of its time, “Scarface” embraces the bright colours, cheesy clothing and dated songs while delivering its viewers a compelling story of the struggle to be at the top of the criminal underground, false promises of the American dream and the contrast between capitalism and communism.\n\nThe main protagonist of the story is Tony Montana, played by Al Pacino (“The Godfather”, “Dog Day Afternoon”, “…And Justice For All”). Tony is a ruthless criminal, who has suffered all his life under Fidel Castro and his communist Cuba. In the beginning of the movie, it is explained to us that he, alongside 125,000 other Cubans, have been shipped to Florida in order to “let some of his people join their relatives in the United States”. The famous actor really gave his all to this role: from changing his appearance almost unrecognizably, to speaking in a broken English Cuban accent. Joining the cast of “Scarface” is Michelle Pfeiffer (“Dangerous Minds”, “Hairspray”, “Dangerous Liaisons”) as Elvira, Tony’s love interest, who was a brand new actress in the Hollywood scene at the time, as well as Steven Bauer (“Primal Fear, “Breaking Bad”, “Ray Donovan”) as Manny, Tony’s best interest and partner in crime, Robert Loggia (“Big”, “Independence Day”, “Lost Highway”) as Frank Lopez, Tony’s and Manny’s boss, and F. Murray Abraham (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”, “Amadeus”, “Finding Forrester”) as Omar, the right hand of Frank Lopez.\n\nThe plot of the film, written by Oliver Stone, takes Tony Montana from the poor slums of Freedom Town all the way to a multimillion dollar mansion in the suburbs of Miami, in search of the American dream that he feels, as quoted in the movie, “is coming to him”. We, as viewers, experience these struggles the main character faces along with him. You can almost feel the stink of the slums in the beginning of the movie, and breathe the air of freedom when he and his friend Manny finally leave it with a green card. These scenes are beautifully directed by Brian De Palma, a director who had already established his name with movies like “Phantom of the Paradise” and “Carrie”. One of the more memorable moments of the aforementioned struggle moments is the scene where we see Tony and Manny working at a sandwich truck, and right across the street is where a fancy night club called “Little Havana” is located: a place of their dreams where people with fancy suits, beautiful dresses and a lot of money come to have a great time. These are the moments where De Palma’s directing succeeds the best. Even though to us, viewers, full background of Tony Montana is never revealed, we feel Tony’s pain when bad things happen to him, and his joy when he is fortunate. Throughout the movie, we see beautifully bright neon colours, men with coloured suits and wide collars, lots of blood, various weapons, expensive cars, and obviously, a lot of cocaine. De Palma has done an excellent job of fully immersing the viewers into the crazy, drug ridden setting of 1980s Miami, and the film still stands as one of the most accurate representations of that era in pop culture and media.\n\nThe film explores various themes, including money, power, respect, violence, drug addiction, greed and climbing the ladder of the criminal underworld, of which the latter is the most prominent. Of course, one of the more underrated aspects of the film is the exploration of America by people who don’t understand it and have never seen it. Tony and Manny have spent a lot of years in jail prior to getting shipped to Florida, so we see them not only as immigrants trying to understand the country in which they landed for the first time, but also as ex-inmates trying to restore themselves in society. And one of the ways scriptwriter Oliver Stone has chosen to portray their misunderstanding is through women. In one of the film’s most famous scenes, we see Manny telling Tony that the way to get partners in this country is by being sexually inappropriate, following his explanation by wiggling his tongue in the air with implementation of performing oral sex. The main character does not believe him, so he challenges his friend to demonstrate his act in front of a woman, which results in Manny getting slapped and being called a creep. At this point in the scene, Tony gives a speech about how in order to successfully get a female partner, you have to earn money and power first. Yet, moments later, we see that his method is completely wrong either, as he demonstrates his net worth in front of his love interest Elvira by buying an expensive vehicle. She seems completely disinterested in him, and when Tony tries to kiss her in the vehicle later on, he gets pushed off and insulted. This, while being an unusual way of portraying the characters’ lack of understanding of modern society, is also a great way to develop them on screen. Up until that point, we never really saw them struggle with society itself, because for a couple of ex-inmate Cuban immigrants, their English is really great, and they seemed to have enough enthusiasm to get anywhere they wanted. Yet it is ironic that the one thing they claim to understand the best is the one thing they both fail at.\n\n“Scarface” is a rare film to see in the film industry. We usually do not see remakes of movies holding up to the greatness of the original, let alone surpassing it in every way to the point where the two movies are almost unrecognizable. If you have not seen it yet, I definitely suggest you watch it as soon as possible, as it is going to leave a good impression for first time viewers. It’s immersive setting, broad range of characters and an uncomparable aesthetic is what made it stand out of the crowd back in 1983, and these same reasons are why the film still has a strong audience even to this day."
