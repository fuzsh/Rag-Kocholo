        "text": "Kevin Smith’s debut irreverent comedy Clerks details a day in the life of Dante Hicks (Brian O’Halloran), a convenience store clerk working at Quick-Stop Groceries in Rebank, New Jersey. The film is littered with a quirky cast, many of whom also making their film debut, and funny quips one can find themselves quoting on the regular among friends.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nClerks opens with Dante Hicks being called into work on his day off. (Which becomes a theme among O’Halloran’s roles in Smith’s View Askew movies) Reluctantly, he goes in. A day of hilarity, and well as drama, ensues. Including dealing with a lazy coworker named Randall Graves (Jeff Anderson), a caring girlfriend (Marilyn Ghigliotti), a cheating ex (Lisa Spoonauer), an ensemble cast of many of Kevin Smiths real live friends such as Walter Flanagan and Scott Mosier, and of course every body’s favorite dim-witted burnout Jay (Jason Mewes) and his quiet heterosexual life mate Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), as they all get into situations that are completely unreasonable, as well as ones that may hit too close to home.\n\nMY REVIEW:\n\nSmith’s ability to write dialogue is unmatched in the independent movie world. Though it has flaws, and some stuff sounds so bizarre that no one would ever actually talk like his characters do, his work is still relatable to anyone who has had to bear the hell that is the customer service world. He’s able to capture the essence of the 90’s in the movie, without making it feel outdated. The soundtrack is an amalgam of great hits of the time period, as well as independent bands Smith knew himself. The soundtrack is one of my favorites due to the dark motif it portrays. The general theme of how shitty life can be in the films is extremely relevant and relatable to the audience. The necessary choice to use black and white film due to it being cheaper, and the overall independent aesthetic of the movie helps the viewer feel like they themselves can make a movie. Smith’s work serves as an inspiration to independent film makers, and Clerks proves that anyone can pick up a camera and make their dreams come true.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\n“You’re living in denial and suppressing rage, motherfucker!”"
