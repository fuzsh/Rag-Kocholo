More Books The Bulletin of the Boston Public Library January, 1940 First Editions of German Classics THE Library has just acquired a score of first editions of German classics — works by Lessing, Goethe, Kant, Heine, and others. The Rare Book Department is of course rich in German books of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; and, in its Barton, Parker, and various other collections, has also many representative works from later periods. Hitherto there has not been, however, a systematic attempt to develop a special collection of German first editions. The new items may be regarded, therefore, as a nucleus for such a group. Today, when the magnanimous views of Nathan der Weisc have been repudiated, it is especially desirable to remember Gottfried Ephraim Lessing. Germany's one-time apostle of tolerance. His Fabeln, a small book in an old calf binding, contains a collection of fables with a dissertation on their na- ture. Printed by Voss at Berlin in 1759, with an attractive frontispiece, the Library's copy is apparently of the first issue, as it contains certain misprints which were later cancelled. The fables of Lessing may be read today with unaffected pleasure for their epigrammatic terseness. Indeed, they have had a long life, for as late as twenty years ago they still figured in German school-books. Lessing was thirty years old when he published the Fabeln, and by that time he had estab- lished his reputation as a journalist and had also published his first tragedy, Miss Sarah Sampson. In the introductory chapter he tells how, when he was laboring on some fables in the poetic form popularized by La Fontaine, the Muse appeared to him in a vision and reminded him that, while truth required the charm of a fable, the fable itself needed no further adornment. Lessing took the advice to heart, and the result was ninety prose tales, admirably brief and concentrated, often pointed at some contemporary foible. In his essay, he finds fault with the flowery imitators of La Fontaine, and, after discussing the theories of various French and German writers, gives his own definition. When you apply a general moral principle to a particular case, he explains, and out of the case make a story in which the reader can clearly recognize thih principle, then you have a fable. Bound together with the Fabeln is Lessing's second tragedy, Fhilotas, also printed in 1759. The drama is written in the style of the Greek classics, pre- serving the unities of time and place. It is exceptional in its complete lack 12.19.39 I 4M+7E 1 4 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN of women characters. Although in his later critical work Lessing praised Shakespeare and deplored the imitation of French models by German writers, in Philotas he carried on the heroic tradition of Corneille. Writing in the time of the Seven Years' War, the dramatist celebrated the military ideals of blind obedience and sacrifice for king and country in the character of a young prince who, taken prisoner, kills himself rather than be returned to his father for a humiliating ransom. The Library has hitherto lacked the first edition of Laokoon, printed, also by Voss, in 1766. The title-page designates the volume as \"First Part,\" for Lessing planned the work in two or three parts, although he never con- tinued it. Laokoon, a treatise \"on the limits of painting and poetry,\" has, until recent times, been a classic of aesthetic theory, so that its influence for more than a century can hardly be overestimated. The discussion centers round the well-known marble group of the Trojan priest Laocoon and his two young sons, struggling in the deadly embrace of two serpents. The statue was dis- covered in the Baths of Titus about the beginning of the sixteenth century and is still, as in Lessing's time, in the Vatican ; it is now attributed to sculp- tors of Rhodes about 50 B. C. Virgil told the story of Laocoon in the second book of the Aencid, and Lessing insisted that the statue was made after Virgil's account and probably stimulated by it. He denied that stoical restraint was a characteristic of the Greeks, who were able to reconcile weeping with hero- ism. If the sculptors did not, like Virgil, make Laocoon scream, this was not, as the great art critic Winckelmann supposed, an expression of stoicism, but an aesthetic principle, because screaming is ugly, and sculpture, like painting, may represent only the beautiful. Lessing further developed the distinction between the functions of visual and literary art. The former is stationary and extended in space, while the latter exists in time and must therefore represent only successive stages and actions. This theory dealt a blow at the descriptive poetry then in vogue, and established a new aesthetic criterion. OF four first editions of works by Goethe, recently purchased by the Li- brary, by far the most generally appealing is Die Leiden des jungen Wer- thers. The acquisition of this epoch-making tale in the original edition of 1774, bound in contemporary calf, is all the more cause of rejoicing because the Library hitherto owned no copy earlier than that of 1795. It was the spontaneous first Werther, as Goethe himself wistfully remembered in his old age, and not the later versions with the changes of 1786, that set all liter- ary Europe aflame. The Library's copy is of the especially rare second issue, differentiated from the first by a vignette on the last page in place of a list of errata and the correct spelling of \"harne Gewand\" (hair shirt), which in the first issue reads \"harine.\" In May 1772 Goethe, at the age of twenty-three, met in Wetzlar the amiable and domestic Charlotte Buff, the fiancee of an honest young attache, and developed for her a romantic attachment. As early as September of the same year the poet fled from the strained situation, and soon found, as he himself expressed it, the moon of a new love rising before the sun of the old had set — the moon being Maximiliane La Roche. In November, Wilhelm FIRST EDITIONS OF GERMAN CLASSICS 5 Jerusalem, a high-strung young man whom Goethe had met in Wetzlar, shot himself because of a hopeless love for a married woman. These are the raw ingredients from which Goethe's genius created this short novel into which he put, to be sure, the morbid sensibility of his time, but also a naive direct- ness of feeling, a freshness which all subsequent imitations and parodies have not been able to mar. Die Wahlverwandtschaften (\"The Elective Affinities\") — the novel of Goethe's maturity which stands chronologically between the more famous IVilhelm Mcisters Lehrjahre and the great autobiographical narrative Dichtung und Wahrheit — was published by Cotta in Tubingen in 1809. One of Goethe's permanent interests was art. This manifested itself in his practice of drawing and painting, as also in his concern with classical art. He devoted the years from 1786 to 1788, which he spent in Italy, to this pas- sion, which left its trace on the second part of Faust. Ten years after his journey, Goethe, together with his friend Heinrich Meyer, edited a somewhat esoteric magazine which enabled him to discuss aesthetic problems in brief essays. The Propylacn, which means \"entrance hail,\" had only a small circula- tion and languished after three years. The Library has now the three volumes of 1798, 1799, and 1800. Many of the contributions, though unsigned, are by Goethe, notably the opening essay of the first volume, which analyzes the much-discussed statue of Laocoon. One of the most significant figures in the art world of Goethe's time was johann Joachim Winckelmann. Born in 1717, a German shoemaker's son, he became Papal Curator of Roman Antiquities ; at the age of fifty-one, he was brutally murdered in Trieste. An example of the wide respect which the art historian enjoyed is the little-known fact that the French novelist Henri Beyle adopted as his pseudonym the name of Winckelmann's native town, Stendhal. In 1805 Goethe published Winkebnann mid sein Jahrhundert, a third of which consists of letters from Winckelmann to his friend Hieronymus Dieterich Berendis. The greater part of the volume is a survey of art history in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries — a work of original criti- cism which the art student of today should not neglect. Next to Leonardo da Vinci, Goethe was perhaps the most universal genius of Western civilization. And, like Leonardo, he combined in himself the artist and the scientist. He collected minerals ; discovered the intermax- illary bone; made astronomical observations; and experimented with botany and optics. In the two latter fields the Library has acquired the monograph Die Metamorphose der Pflanscn, printed in Gotha in 1790, and the two volumes of Zur Farbcnlehrc, published by Cotta in 1810. The former describes the growth and change of a plant and predicates the identity of the organs in the metamorphosis, foreshadowing later evolutionary principles. The treat- ise on optics was the fruit of a long and intense preoccupation which Goethe considered more important than his literary work. It is divided into three parts, which the author called didactic, polemical, and historical. At the con- clusion of the third he wrote a \"Confession\" in which he told how he arrived at his chromatic discoveries. It was his interest in painting which led Goethe to seek a systematic color rule. One day in Weimar he looked through a prism, expecting to see 6 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN on the white wall the chromatic color scale according- to Newton's theory ; he saw instead that the wall remained white, except where it was contiguous to a dark object. He straightway declared that Newton's doctrine was wrong and from then on began his own experimentation. While he received en- couragement from the Duke of Weimar and other princes, from Schiller and various scholars, the physicists treated his refutation of Newton coldly. How- ever tempting it may be to side with an original genius against the schools, it will have to be admitted that the scientists were right. The great Helmholtz, while paying tribute to Goethe's ideas on biology, has pointed out that Goethe's contradiction of Newton's theory sprang from the poet's insistence on sense perception as a reliable guide to the knowledge of nature, whereas the physicist must seek to understand the working of invisible forces. A sup- plementary pamphlet to Zur Farbenlehre, containing sixteen colored plates ;ind explanatory text, shows Goethe's careful draughtsmanship. THE Library has hitherto lacked first editions of the most important works by the greatest German philosopher — Immanuel Kant. It now fortunately owns the Critik der reinen Vernunft, printed by Hartknoch in Riga in 1781 ; the Mctaphysische Anfangsgriinde der Natumnsscnschaft, issued by the same house in 1786; and the Critik der Urtheilskraft, published in Berlin and Libau in 1790. The cheerful, methodical bachelor, by whose daily walk the people of Konigsberg set their clocks, and who never went beyond seven miles from his native city, brought about what has been called a Copernican revolution in philosophy. The Critique of Pure Reason, the first systematic presentation of Kant's new ideas, although written in four or five months, was actually the fruit of twelve years' study and contemplation. \"Our period is the period of criti- cism,\" the philosopher explained in his preface; and his innovation was just this, that he subjected the thought forms of the mind itself to critical exam- ination, discovering in the process that the mind can attain knowledge of an existing thing {Ding and sick) only as the impression of it can be conveyed through the sense perceptions and grasped by the faculties of the intellect. Modern thinkers can see in this once revolutionary theory indications of the recent development of the idea of relativity in physical science. The Critique of Judgment represents, in a way, a link between the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of Practical Reason, the latter expounding Kant's system of moral categories. In the year of Kant's death, 1804, a high-strung young man came as an official to Konigsberg, and there wrote some short stories and a play. Hein- rich von Kleist was a strange mixture of passionate patriotism and melan- choly brooding. In November 181 1 he committed suicide, after first killing a friend to whom he had given his word that he would, whenever she wished, release her from incurable suffering. The year before his death Kleist's well- known play, Das Kdthchcn von Heilbronn, was performed and also appeared in hook form in Berlin. The Library's copy is of the first edition, which is all the more desirable because the posthumously-published collected works of Kleist were considerably bowdlerized by their editor, Ludwig Tieck. Das Kdthchen von Heilbronn is a fantastic play of medieval knighthood, written in FIRST EDITIONS OF GERMAN CLASSICS 7 rather bombastic prose and fluent blank verse. The heroine, ostensibly the daughter of a village blacksmith, but later revealed as the child of the em- peror, follows the knight to whom she feels bound by a mysterious destiny through unbelievable trials, which are finally rewarded. Unreal though the story is, there is in the character of Kathchen, in spite of its excessive humility, an almost Shakespearean touch which makes the reader sympathize. A contemporary of Goethe and Schiller, the lyric poet Friedrich Holder- lin was saturated with their enthusiasm for Hellas. There has been in recent decades a Holderlin revival in Germany, which is not surprising in view of the idealized paganism in his poems. The slender volume of Gedichte, printed by Cotta in 1826, contains beautiful pieces, some of them unrhymed and sug- gestive of Greek lyrics. The first edition appeared twenty-four years after the poet had fallen victim to a madness which afflicted him till his death in 1843. \"With the works of Heine, the American reader is on more familiar ground. The Library's copy of Die romantische Schidc, printed in Hamburg in 1836, is in the original paper covers. Taking Mine, de StaeTs work Dc I'Allc- magne as starting point, it criticizes the neo-Catholic literary movement in Germany, with pointed comments on A. W. Schlegel, Tieck, Schelling, Uhland, and others. Acid though his pen is, when he comes to an appraisal of Arnim and Brentano's lovely collection of folk songs, Dcs Knabcn Wunderhorn, the German poet has the better of the Parisian critic. His playful meditations on the possible meanings of Don Quixote may entertain the modern reader. The collection Nene Gedichte, 1844, contains some of Heine's most de- lightful songs, such as \"Leise zieht durch mein Gemut,\" \"Es ragt im Meer ein Runenstein,\" and that perfect expression of an exile's homesickness, \"Ich hatte einst ein schones Vaterland\" ; yet on the whole, both in the ballads and lyrics, the volume represents the poet rather in his satirical vein. It includes a long poem, Dcutschland, ein W inter m'tihrchen, in which Heine, with inspired mockery, describes his return, as a dangerous character, to the apprehensive Germany of the time. The \"winter's tale\" appeared under separate covers in the same year, after the publisher had removed some of the sharpest barbs for the censor's sake. Finally, in the satire Atta Troll of 1847 — a \"summer night's dream\" suggested by the exotic ballads of Freiligrath, notably his \"Prince of the Moors\" — Heine tells the story of two communistic dancing bears which protest against the cruelty of man. This tale is only a starting-point for va- rious madcap digressions in which it is hard to recognize the one-time singer of \"Die Loreley.\" As Heine explains in the preface, he composed the satire at a time when his enemies of the most diverse political colors were banded against him, and orders for his arrest awaited him at every station. \"In the German forest of bards,\" he described the political atmosphere of the period, \"there arose that particularly vague, unfruitful pathos, that miasma of enthusiasm, which cast itself with contempt for death into general- ities, and always reminded me of the American sailor who was so inordinately devoted to [AndrewJ Jackson that one day he leaped from the top of the mast into the sea, crying out: 'i am dying for General Jackson!' \" MARGARET MUNSTERBERG An English Country Calendar AT this season of the year, the Elizabethan farmer probably turned the pages of his favorite book from Christmas carols to the warning, \"A kindlie good Janiueere, Freeseth pot by the feere.\" This is the heading for January in Thomas Tusser's Five hundreth pointes of good husbandrie, a rhymed calendar which was the authoritative farmers' manual well into the seventeenth century. It was in 1557 that Tusser published the first version of the work, A hundreth good pointes. In 1571 he added to it \"a hundrethe good pointes of Huswifery\" ; for \"housekeping and husbandry, if it be good, Must love one another, as cousinnes in blood.\" Two years later he extended the book to Fiue hundreth pointes, its final form, which went through four more editions before his death in 1580, and seven others by the end of the century. In spite of these repeated printings, copies of any edition are very rare. The Library is fortunate to have ac- quired a copy of that of 1599, printed in London by Peter Short. The vol- ume includes the author's famous auto- biography in verse, and is complete with the large printer's device at the end. It is bound in green levant morocco by Riviere, who has in this case merci- fully spared most of the margins. Of this particular edition little is known, though it was reprinted by Sir Walter Scott in the third volume of the Somers Tracts two centuries later. Like most of the editions produced after Tusser's death, it is not entirely accurate as to text, and has frequent errors in pagination. The book owes its continued popu- larity since those days to the spirit of farm life which it so well conveys. Written for a practical purpose, it re- tains all the humor and charm of an author who had been both chorister and barley-grower. Thus Tusser made a purely English contribution to the early Elizabethan period when foreign influences were all too strong. His classic of husbandry — a far cry from the stilted pastoral — still gives a sound picture of the English countryside of his time. The author writes for the most part in rough couplets which sing-song their way into the memory. He divides the whole into passages for each month of the year, with an abstract of the work to be done, and a lesson in agriculture. These are followed by digressions on \"life and riches\" or \"the usage of diuers countries concerning tillage.\" Tusser began the year's cycle with the harvest month : \"September blow soft, Til fruit be in loft.\" In this edition, August's husbandry is followed by short poems such as a dialogue on \"wiuing and thriuing.\" The \"Pointes of Huswiferie\" are separated into morning works, after- noon works, and \"after supper matters,\" to which are added all manner of useful topics. The \"Posies for diners roomes\" are maxims on hospitality for the hall, or on friendship for the parlor: The quiet friend all one in word and deed, Great comfort is, like readie gold at need. Southey called Tusser a \"good, honest, homely, useful, old rhymer,\" but this is surely an understatement. He had con- siderable training in music at Saint Paul's and at court in the service of Lord Paget, whose praise he sings here in a dedicatory acrostic. After several years of unlucky farming life, he obtained some sort of situation at Cambridge. It is true that his career, which ended in a debtor's prison, was no very con- vincing proof of the value of his own precepts. \"He was successively,\" com- mented Thomas Fuller in his dry fashion, \"a musician, schoolmaster, serving- man, husbandman, grazier, poet; more skilful in all than thriving in any voca- tion . . . He spread his bread with all sorts of butter, yet none would stick thereon.\" One of his maxims, however, he illustrated extremely well: he was indeed \"an apt cunning man to teach.\" E. B.S. 8 Ten Books The Living Tradition. By Simeon Strunsky. Doubleday, Doran. 1939. 454 PP- In his examination of American tradition, Mr. Strunsky seeks \"the persistent change,\" the constants that link the country of today to the country of Jefferson and Hamilton. An editorial writer for the New York Times, he sees the troubled and exciting years since 1929 through the eyes of \"a working American journalist.\" His conclusions, while supported with statistics from government reports and census find- ings, are more often based on common knowledge, aptly restated. He attacks the idea of the closed frontier, finding its spirit transferred to new undertak- ings and its psychology persisting, particularly among the new immigrants. Similarly, the pioneer lawlessness has become a deeply-rooted national trait — even the \"sit-down strikes\" of 1937 being such a manifestation and un- related to the barricade fighting of Eu- rope. The years, he feels, have brought nothing revolutionary in either the political or economic position of women, nor has the education of the average child changed greatly. Challenging many of the New Deal reforms, he traces the improved health of the popu- lation, the housing developments, and the decrease of child labor to the pros- perous years before the crash. Contrary to the Beards' indictment in the Rise of American Ciwlisation, Mr. Strunsky does not describe the nation's business in terms of the robber baron but of the small independent shop-keeper. Neither does he consider increased unionization an indication of a stratified society. With the mid-term elections of 1938, he observes the re-appearance of the old \"illogical\" two party system, con- sidered a victim of the Roosevelt land- slides. Taking the European War of 1914-1918 and the business depression of the last ten years as outstanding tests of American behavior, he finds us neither juvenile in our foreign af- fairs, nor radical and revolutionary in our domestic. Even the various agencies of the New Deal do not depart from the well-established practice of bounties and protection. With the authors of Middletown in Transition, Mr. Strunsky concludes that there is very little change in the American democratic outlook ; beneath the country's extremes and con- trasts, the same small town society persists. (E. L. A.) The Awakening of America. By V. F. Calverton. Day. 1939. 474 pp. Admitting that he is writing the \"first extended Marxian history of America,\" Mr. Calverton nevertheless insists in his preface that he has not considered economic interests alone, but has at- tempted to trace their evolution in political and social form. The present volume tells the story of the settle- ment of the thirteen colonies up to the middle of the eighteenth century, in terms of the lower middle-class emi- grant. The outlook and aspirations of this type, he feels, took shape as early as the Lollard controversy of the four- teenth century. It was the spiritual descendants of these first Separatists, with the dissenter's belief in the im- portance of the individual, who began the democratic tradition of the New World. The wandering Quaker mis- sionaries, the religious experiments of Plockhoy and the Labadists, and the long-lived Ephrata community he sees as later manifestations of the same im- pulse. Mr. Calverton does not spare the avarice and intolerance of the better- class settlers, showing the native Indians as the first victims of their exploita- tion, only to be succeeded by the negro slaves and white redemptioners. The colonial revolts, led by such men as Bacon, Fendall, and Coode, he treats in detail, believing them the precursors of the Revolution, and true protests of the agrarian middle class against the authority of aristocratic and wealthy governors. Among the \"under-dogs\" whose personalities emerge with this approach are Roger Williams, \"the greatest latitudinarian of his day,\" the firebrand Samuel Gorton, inspired by the Familists, and Nathaniel Bacon, the popular champion of the small 9 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN farmers of Virginia. Mr. Calverton adds a further chapter on the influence of the frontier, which he considers the ideal laboratory for the development of an agrarian democracy. (E.L.A.) America Faces South. By T. R. Ybarra. Dodd, Mead. 1939. 321 pp. For the reader who wishes a hasty glance at South American countries as they appear today, Mr. Ybarra's sur- vey will provide useful reading. He has covered the historical, political, eco- nomic, and social aspects of most of the South American states, without paus- ing for a detailed analysis of any one of them. To Argentina and Brazil he has devoted the largest spaces. In the former, he sees the clash between native and European cultures embodied in Buenos Aires; in the latter he finds our recent loan a strong combative mea- sure against German control. Mr. Ybarra draws attention to Nazi and Fascist influences, and attributes the rise of dictatorial powers to the earlier condi- tions imposed by monarchical control of the colonies. To those unfamiliar with the South American scene, the briefly-sketched biographies of promi- nent men are good introductions, as are also the descriptions of beauty spots such as the Chilean Lakes. The author defines the good-neighbor policy as one in which the neighbors must be cajoled into friendliness and the former deeds of an imperialistic United States be erased by an entirely different \"big- brotherliness.\" Elihu Yale. By Hiram Bingham. Dodd, Mead. 1939. 362 pp. The author, a former Senator from Connecticut, has through researches in the archives of the East India Company recreated the life of the \"American Nabob of Queen's Square\" whose name the college in New Haven bears. Born in Boston in 1649, of an old Welsh merchant family, Elihu Yale was taken back to England at the age of three and never saw America again. Begin- ning as a humble clerk in the East India Company, he became a man of great wealth and considerable influence. Where- as earlier biographers have passed over the twenty-seven years that he labored in India, Mr. Bingham devotes three- fourths of his book to this period. Through good judgment and diplo- matic dealings with the Indian rajahs, Yale advanced rapidly in the Company's Madras settlement, until in 1687 he be- came its Governor. In spite of numerous difficulties, he proved himself a wise administrator in the first years ; but later friction developed between him and the Council, and he was removed from office. In 1699 Yale returned to England, prosperous enough to build up one of the most remarkable art collections in the country. When Cotton Mather addressed to him a petition for a gift to the proposed college in New Haven, he responded generously. His gift was in the form of textiles which were sold for the benefit of the college, besides a group of 417 books. (M. M.) The Story of the Political Philoso- phers. By George Catlin. McGraw-Hill. 1939. 802 pp. Professor George Catlin, whose repute as an author and lecturer in both America and England is so well established, has in his comprehensive work provided \"a guide to political theory intelligible to the common reader.\" He traces it for three thousand years against the background of various civilizations, and illustrates it with the biographies of the great political thinkers of each age. Though he quotes long passages from their works, his own commentaries are the links in which he formulates the thesis of his book, namely, that \"the vision of eternal values through the ages has not significantly changed.\" The volume is divided into four parts. The first surveys the periods before Plato, and, afterwards, explains in de- tail the general trends through the Hellenistic, Roman, medieval, and Re- naissance periods, ending with Hobbes. Machiavelli is given a distinguished place as \"the first political scientist.\" Although he makes no claim to new- interpretations, the author has given many : the Renaissance, for instance, he finds disappointing because man \"had not discovered that the way to imitate the Greeks was not to imitate those who themselves imitated nobody.\" The second part covers Locke, the eighteenth-century revolutions, the Utili- tarians, Bentham, the Mills, and Kant TEN BOOKS 1 1 The third part discusses the theorists from Rousseau to Mussolini and Hitler. The latter are described in an interest- ing chapter in which Mr. Catlin uses past problems as a mirror for the rival philosophies of today. The \"Conclu- sion and Prospect\" presented in the last part is derived from long-range perspective. Mr. Catlin believes that there is no evidence of a history of progress. There is, however, a heritage, which \"is culture itself and of civiliza- tion the most sacred charge.\" (E.B.S.) The Life of Greece. By Will Durant. Simon and Schuster. 1939. 755 pp. Mr. Durant now offers the second volume of his series \"The Story of Civilization.\" The scope of the work is large, extending from the beginnings of Cretan civilization to the conquest of Greece by Rome. The sequence of events — wars and politics — serves as framework for a history of the whole Greek culture: its mythology and reli- gion, its philosophy, mathematics and science, drama, poetry, architecture, and sculpture. Family life, with its characteristic eugenic principles, social organization, and morals have an im- portant place in the narrative. The author skilfully suggests analogous problems in modern times, thus stimu- lating a realization of our Greek heri- tage in all spheres of intellectual and political life. \"Scopas played Byron to Pheidias' Milton and Praxiteles' Keats,\" is a typical example of his style. Chrono- logical tables for each larger division and a selected bibliography on sources make the volume a useful reference book, while the well-chosen illustra- tions add to its popular appeal. Ideas Are Weapons. By Max Lerner. Viking. 1939. 553 pp. The author has gathered into one volume fifty essays and book reviews which illustrate the power of ideas in directing political and social forces. At the present time it is especially neces- sary to understand the force of the ir- rational; but, Mr. Lerner warns us, \"there is an enormous difference be- tween the recognition of the role of the irrational and the glorification of it.\" Tdeas are instruments, which dictators or powerful interests may impose upon the masses for the extension of might. An obvious example of the \"cynicism of Realpolitik\" is the late rapproche- ment of the Nazi and the Soviet govern- ments — a case of power politics over- coming ideologies. America is by no means free from the manipulation of ideas for reactionary ends, and the author suggests meeting the attack of the large factories of propaganda, the corporate press and the radio, with a federal radio chain, run non-commer- cially. The bulk of the book consists of biographical essays on American and European originators of ideas. Mr. Lern- er interprets Emerson, Thoreau, and Lincoln from the angle of present needs. Perhaps his most distinctive contribu- tions are those treating of the Supreme Court, both in general essays and in separate studies of Justices Holmes. Brandeis, and Black. The reviews of works by Veblen, Beard, Thurman Arnold, Lynd, and others are especially penetrating. (M.M.) Land below the Wind. By Agnes New- ton Keith. Little, Brown. 1939. 371 pp. This narrative, the winner of the 1939 Atlantic Monthly non-fiction contest, is a highly individual record of four years in the \"Land below the Wind,\" which is the Malayan name for Borneo. The author, an American born in Hollywood, tnarried a Conservator of Forests for the British government in North Borneo, and settled with him in Sandakan, the capital city, inhabited by seventy Eu- ropeans, ten thousand Chinese, and more than twenty times as many natives. She tells in a frank, realistic way, spiced with humor, about her intimate con- tacts with the island people. She came to understand their stoic acceptance of fate and their indifference to suffering, their fitful laziness and unquestioning loyalty. Having accompanied her hus- band on his expeditions through the jungle, Mrs. Keith describes her ex- periences, ranging from high adventures to the discomforts of continual damp- ness and blood-sucking leeches. Charmed with the amiable Muruts who had proved so helpful in the jungle, she was no little surprised to learn that as recently as 1925 \"these pleasant persons were conducting regular and systematic head- hunting.\" I 2 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN Ingres. By Walter Pach. Harper. 1939. 284 pp. [8063.02-622.] In writing his book, Mr. Pach has drawn from the artist's voluminous correspondence and the wealth of anec- dotes preserved by his students. He divides the work into three sections — a biography, a series of excerpts from Ingres' own writings, and an evalua- tion of his art. The most impressive feature of Ingres' career was its single- ness of purpose. From his first drawing as a child to his \"Golden Age\" and \"Stratonice\" painted in his eighties he was an ardent classicist. His enthusiasm for the genuine spirit of the antique led his fellow pupils in the studio of David to regard him as revolutionary. Yet the same tendency was the cause of his popularity some twenty years later, upon his return after a long so- journ in Rome. As a measure of recog- nition, but even more to combat the rising tide of Romanticism, Ingres was promptly elected to the Academy. His devotion to Raphael, his dry color, and his emphasis on line represented the opposite pole from Delacroix in the artistic conflict of the period. Ingres was outspoken in his criticism of his rival, whose late admission to the Academy in 1857 symbolized a change in taste. The concluding section of the book discusses the artist's historical position. Mr. Pach believes that the present generation owes more to Ingres than is conceded, and that his realism is the most lasting of his many virtues. (/.£.) Art Young, His Life and Times. By Art Young. Sheridan House. 458 pp. Art Young proves by this autobio- graphy that a cartoonist can convey humor in writing as well as by the brush. With his keen eye for human interest, he has seen the comedy and pathos in daily life; and all these epi- sodes are captured in a volume flavored with observations. Here is an informal American history from 1887, when Young worked as a staff artist on the Chicago Daily News, to the present. During the intervening years the car- toonist's philosophy has undergone a marked change. At twenty he repre- sented as guilty the men executed for alleged bomb-throwing in the Hay- market riot; at seventy-two he rejoices in the signs of growing solidarity be- tween workers and protests against the brutality of \"our crazy economic system.\" As a youth he went to Chicago, where he quickly won recognition. During his long career there and in New York, he was in close contact with politics, social movements, and the active personalities of the day. Having become a Socialist, he was one of the initial contributors to The Masses. Eugene Field, Thomas Nast, Arthur Brisbane, Max Eastman, and many others have been his friends and associates. The recording of his many friendships and the description of his rural para- dise in the hills of Connecticut are among the most attractive features of the book. (/. E.) Library Notes Ben Jonson's Art of Poetry f~\\ . Horatius Flaccus: his Art of Poet- ry \"englished\" by Ben Jonson [ * *G. 389a. 344 1 represents a rare ad- dition to the Library's group of Eliza- bethan translations. The little book was printed in London in 1640, three years after Jonson's death. An engrav- ing- shows his bust, adorned with a laurel wreath. The volume contains, besides the translation of the Ars Poet- ica, an Execration against Vulcan, The Masque of the Gypsies and Epigrams to Several! Noble Personages. The Ars Poetica is a metrical dis- sertation on poetic art, written by Horace in the form of a letter to L. Calpurnius Piso and his sons. Consider- ing the great vogue of Horace among English men of letters in later times, it is noteworthy that he was not a favorite with the Elizabethans. How- ever, the first Engish translator of the Ars Poetica was not Jonson, but the Reverend Thomas Drant, whose Arte of Poetrie, Pistles, and Satyrs was printed in 1567. In the early 1600's Jonson, a guest at the house of Sir Robert Town- shend, where he could indulge his pas- sion for classical study, himself read and translated Horace's poem. How- ever, his version was not printed until several years later. Following the translation is a highly individual ten-page poem, Ben Jonson's Execration against Vulcan. In 1623, when the dramatist was at the height of his fame, a fire destroyed his precious li- brary, including many of his manu- scripts. In this invective against the god of fire he gave vent to his indig- nation and also much information, for which biographers must be grateful, about the lost works. The Library has also a separate edition printed in the same year as this copy. The one dramatic piece in the volume is The Masque of the Gypsies or The Gypsies Metamorphos'd. Ben Jonson had entertained the court with many masques, since the accession of James I. The King, always a friend to Jonson, doubtless found pleasure in the rollick- ing fantasy when it was first performed in 1621, at the country house of the Duke of Buckingham ; for it was re- peated at Belvoir and Windsor. The masque, a medley of dance and song, presents a band of gypsies, who tell fortunes for the King and court. The jokes have lost their relish for modern readers, but some of the lyrics still retain their charm. The final section of the volume con- tains Epigrams to Severall Noble Per- sonages. These poems were addressed to King Charles — who was far less inclined than his learned father to the poet's company; to Queen Mary; and various inltuential peers. The one to Sir Kenelm Digby has more than the conventional warmth. With frank plea- sure the laureate wrote: For he doth love my verses, and will looke Upon them, next to Spencers noble booke ; And praise them too! O what a Fame 'twill be? No less sincere, but much less friendly are the verses addressed to the \"blatent beast\" who had taunted him with re- ceiving forty pounds for some verses to the Lord Treasurer. M. M. King James's Treasure Hunt IN 1686, Captain William Phips - later the first royal governor of Massa- chusetts— persuaded Christopher Monck, the second Duke of Albemarle, and several other needy peers to form a joint stock company to \"fish\" for wrecked treasures in the West Indies. A war- rant to take up all \"gold, silver, and other riches as should be found\" was secured from James II, His Majesty reserving one tenth of the discoveries for himself; and Phips, trusting to the information he had wormed out of an old Spaniard, sailed from England on September 12. Cruising in the shallow reef waters off the coast of Hispaniola, now Haiti, he came across a sunken galleon which had headed the Spanish treasure fleet of 1642. His Indian divers brought up heavy ingots of silver, en- 13 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN 14 crusted with coral, and scattered orna- ments of precious metals and jewels, penetrating- finally into the \"coin room\" itself. The King's share alone of this fabu- lous wealth came to over £20,000, and Phips was promptly knighted for his services to the Crown. Among the manuscripts recently acquired by the Library is a second covenant between James II and the Duke of Albemarle with his five associ- ates, draw n up in the Treasure Chambers on the 20th of July. 1687. After review - ing the circumstances of Phips's suc- cessful voyage, the King was pleased to agree that the company should \"have the use of One of his Majesty's Shipps to make another voyage to the parts aforesaid, his Majesty paying for Weare and Teare and the said Duke and other said Undertakers to beare the charge of ye Victualls and to pay the men of the said Ship . . .\" In regard to his own share, he stipulated, \"His Majesty instead of a Tenth part is to receive one fifth part ... to any value not exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and one third part of what shall be received exceeding that Sum . . .\" The document, still bearing the royal seal, is signed by Thomas Watkins, the solicitor-general, and passed by Sidney Godolphin, John Ernie, and Stephen Fox, all Lords of the Treasury. E. L. A. The Dancing Master PRACTICAL discussions of the elegant bow, the curtsey, and the hand flutter are rarely recorded in the history of ballroom dancing; yet they are to be found in an important French book written by P. Rameau, Le Maitre a Danser, first printed in Paris in 1725. This work, which the Library has just acquired in a contemporary calf binding, was more than just an invita- tion to the dance. Here for the first time the author published descriptions of the actual steps and the five positions of the feet, and illustrated them with a series of copper engravings which are entertaining as well as instructive. The rather crude drawings serve their pur- pose admirably, though a courtier caught with both toes pointing outward, or both knees slightly bent, is not a grace- ful figure. There are fifty-seven plates ; one of them, absent in most copies, is a large folded sheet which pictures a court ball. Rameau recognized the superiority of the great teachers ; but, as he writes in his preface, \"Among all those who are commended for their teaching of the art of dancing, no one has set down the rules governing it . . . Thus I have committed to paper the lessons which they often gave in my presence.\" That they liked Rameau's book is certain, for the great ballet master, L. Pecourt, himself wrote for it an \"Approbation.\" In 1728 Rameau's explanation had al- ready been translated into English, and Spanish texts of that time definitely show his influence. In spite of his popularity, little is known of the author save what appears on the title pages of his works. Ac- cording to these, he was dancing master to the Queen of Spain, Elizabeth Farnese, second wife of Philip V. E. B. S. Letters of a Versatile Astronomer SIR JOHN Herschel, the son of William Herschel the astronomer, describes himself in 1816 as taking up \"star-gazing\" under his father's direc- tion, after experimenting with mathe- matics, chemistry, law, and optics. A group of three letters recently purchased by the Library shows him as a scien- tist of continuing versatility. The earliest, written from London on June 7, 1821, is addressed to Alexis Bouvart, the pupil and co-worker of Laplace, at the Royal Observatory in Paris. Herschel, foreign secretary to the newly-formed Astronomical So- ciety, thanks him for a report on the great solar eclipse of September 6, 1820, as it was observed at Fiume. He sends him in return the corresponding figures taken at various points about the city and at Slough, on the family's country estate. Herschel's wish to complete his father's survey of the heavens took him to Feldhausen on the Cape of Good Hope in 1833, where he initiated the study of the southern nebulae. Writing to John Lindley, the botan- ist, shortly after his return to England. LIBRARY NOTES 15 he promises to send him a number of choice gladiolus bulbs. Natives of Africa, they had been painstakingly planted in England \"and new bulbs formed satisfactorily.\" The amateur gardener classifies the seven specimens, giving them tentative names and adding the details of their cultivation. The third letter, written on May ri, 1848, to Jonathan Taylor of Liverpool, concerns the rights to the \"object glass\" or lens of the Catiehoix refractor, the invention of a French optician of that name. Herschel, not being in possession of all the information \"either personally or by epistolary correspondence,\" concludes the matter is too delicate to warrant any decision. Accompanying the astronomer's letters is one by his daughter Caroline Edith Gordon, recalling a spectral experience of her father's. Crossing the lawn on the night after his old forty-foot tele- scope had been torn down, he seemed to see it outlined against the sky. Shaken, he told his family, \"I have seen a ghost.\" E. L. A. Early Spanish Histories THE Library has acquired two sixteenth-century Spanish books which are important additions to the group of chronicles in the Ticknor Collection. An article in the April 1939 issue of More Books described this group in full. At that time the first of the chronicles printed by Sebastian Martinez at Valladolid in 1551 was lacking. The Chronica del principe y rey don Alfonso cl Onzeno — the first to appear, although the last in chronology — now completes the series which covers the deeds of the Kings of Castile and Leon from 12 18 to 1350. The other volume is the first edition of Pero Mexia's Historia imperial y Cesar ca, printed at Seville in 1545. This was an extremely popular work, some- what in the style of the universal histories, save that Mexia, being a scholar, quoted his sources. A chapter is devoted to each of the emperors from Julius Caesar to Maximilian I of Austria ; yet it is not exclusively a book of historical facts. Mexia told legends and stories of miracles along with records of actual events. Of the many other editions and trans- lations that followed, the Library has a copy produced in Antwerp in 1 561 and the English translation by Thomas Traheron published in 1604. Mexia. a friend of Cortes's son, Fernando, was known to his contemporaries as El Astrologo, and is said to have been con- sulted by navigators because of his ex- tensive knowledge of mathematics and astronomy as well as history. He dedi- cated the Historia imperial to Prince Philip; later in 1548 he was appointed official chronicler by the Emperor Charles V. The chronicle of Alfonso XI is bound in contemporary vellum ; a large wood- cut occupies two-thirds of the title- page which is similar to the others in the Valladolid set. Mexia's history of the emperors has large ornamental initial letters at the head of each chapter. Under the colophon is a small wood- cut of Hercules, the mark used by the printer, Juan de Leon. E.
