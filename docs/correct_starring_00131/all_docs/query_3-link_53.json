HANNIBAL “Ceuf” TEASER CLOSE ON - A POT ROAST SLICED yet UNTOUCHED. Dusted with MOLD. A common HOUSEFLY BUZZES into frame. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we are -- INT. TURNER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY 1 1 1 A grim family dinner. A POT ROAST turned rancid. BUGS crawling in the POTATOES. And the TURNER FAMILY - MOTHER, FATHER, and TWO CHILDREN - pitched forward onto the table from GUNSHOT WOUNDS to their heads. Resultant poolings of DRIED BLOOD read like inky shadows on the dining table. BLOOD sprays a FAMILY PORTRAIT on the wall. At the head of the table sits WILL GRAHAM. He takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes. A PENDULUM It swings in the darkness of Will Graham’s mind, keeping rhythm with his heart beat. FWUM. FWUM. FWUM. ON WILL GRAHAM - WILL’S P.O.V. His eyes are closed. The PENDULUM is now outside his head. It arcs in front of the grim family dinner, that PALE DEATHLY PALLOR of those seated at the table become flush with color. The PENDULUM arcs smoothly across frame - FWUM - shooing insects from pot roast. FWUM. Aromatic STEAM now rises from the roast as though it had been set down a moment before. The PENDULUM swings across the table and the pool of blood in front of Mrs. Turner SHRINKS and RECEDES back toward her head. FWUM. The pendulum swings in front of the table and the Turners begin to shift, blood receding, slowly sitting up one by one. FWUM. The BLOOD flies off the FAMILY PORTRAIT. The crime scene has now been decriminalized in Will’s mind. Will Graham opens his eyes, sitting at the table watching the Turner Family motionless in the TABLEAU before their deaths. Will inhales, able to smell the homemade meal. FWUM. FWUM. The PENDULUM STOPS SWINGING, snapping into place. (CONTINUED)\n\n3. Each member of the Turner Family has a full plate in front of them. In front of Will, an empty place setting. WILL GRAHAM Table has been set. Family dinner. I wasn’t invited. I take my seat at the empty plate. My seat. My place setting, next to Mrs. Turner. (then) I am the guest of honor. The YOUNGEST TURNER holds a fork in her hand with a small stalk of broccoli impaled on its tines. WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D) No one has taken a bite of their dinner. Except the youngest. (to Youngest Turner) Unless you eat your growing foods, you won’t get any dessert. The Youngest Turner pops the broccoli in her mouth. WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D) No one is bound. No one leaves the table. All afraid to move. Even the little ones behaved themselves. (then) I brought my new family to this home invasion, controlling the Turners with threats of violence. CLOSE ON - WILL GRAHAM - WILL’S P.O.V. He stares dispassionately into middle distance. WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D) Threats that turned to action. THREE SIMULTANEOUS GUN SHOTS ring out in the dining room. WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D) The Turner Family is executed simultaneously with the exception of Mrs. Turner. Who dies last. (then) This is my design. POP WIDE - WILL’S P.O.V. The Turner Family is now face down in their plates, with the exception of Mrs. Turner -- who stares directly at Will. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 2. CONTINUED: 1 1 (CONTINUED)\n\n4. WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D) I shoot Mrs. Turner, gun against the canvas of her forehead. Looking her directly in the eye when I pull the trigger. ON THE BACK OF MRS. TURNER’S HEAD - WILL’S P.O.V. BANG. It rocks violently back TOWARD CAMERA before swinging forward into her plate, CLEARING FRAME and REVEALING Will leaning across the table holding a smoking gun. OMNISCIENT P.O.V. CAMERA REVEALS JACK CRAWFORD standing in the dining room doorway, watching Will -- who now wears rubber gloves and is no longer holding a gun, but his arm is still raised. A moment, then: JACK CRAWFORD What do you see, Will? WILL GRAHAM Family values. JACK CRAWFORD Whose family values? OFF Will unable to answer that question... CUT TO: INT. WILL GRAHAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM - DAY 1 2 2 Will’s pack of misfit DOGS sniff and wander the house. Suddenly, they all go still. Tails motionless, heads turns to observe an OFFSCREEN PRESENCE with curious interest. ON HANNIBAL LECTER He appears at the front door, Will’s house lit up behind him. Holds up LINKS OF SAUSAGES. Dinner time. INT. WILL GRAHAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM - LATER 3 3 Dogs occupied, Hannibal stands before a cluttered BOOKSHELF. He scans the bindings, pulls one out for a better look: an instruction manual on fly fishing. He raises an eyebrow. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 3. CONTINUED: (2) 1 1 (CONTINUED)\n\n5. CLOSE ON - A DRESSER A DRAWER glides open. Hannibal inspects a pile of OLD T- SHIRTS looking for clues to Will’s past -- instead he only finds white t-shirts, a dozen of them neatly folded. Telling in its own way. CLOSE ON - A BOAT MOTOR Unceremoniously displayed in a partially disassembled state. Through Will’s glasses, Hannibal picks up the pieces of the disassembled BOAT MOTOR and puts them together effortlessly. INT. WILL GRAHAM’S HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER 4 4 Hannibal enters to find Will’s FLY TYING GEAR arranged on the table. There is a RACK of COMPLETED FLIES. A VICE, LAMP, MAGNIFYING GLASS, YARNS, THREADS, FEATHERS, and HOOKS. Hannibal sits at the station, admires Will’s handiwork, such delicate lures for catching fish. Hannibal applies himself to tying off an incomplete SALMON FLY, expertly using the TOOLS of Will’s hobby -- THREAD, BOBBIN, SCISSORS, PLIERS. His surgeon’s precision in play. Having completed his work, Hannibal admires the FLY and HOOK. He presses his THUMB gently against the pointed BARB, and keeps the pressure on until he draws a drop of BLOOD. Without lingering on his act, Hannibal sucks the lone DROP from his thumb-tip. The sound is not unlike a quick KISS. CUT TO BLACK.

PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - EVENING 1 5 5 The sprawling grounds of an elegant, self-funded psychiatric hospital. A CHYRON tells us we are -- BALTIMORE, MARYLAND INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - ABIGAIL HOBBS’ ROOM - EVENING 1 6 6 A private patient suite with many of the comforts of home. ON ABIGAIL HOBBS She gazes in the mirror. The bandages on her neck have been removed and we see her fresh, angry SCARS above her white slip. She runs her fingers across the wound before tying a scarf around her neck to conceal it from the world. ABIGAIL (V.O.) I can hide what happened to me. All I need is a scarf to pass. Or a turtleneck, the right high collar. EXT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - GROUNDS - EVENING 1 7 7 Abigail walks with ALANA BLOOM, a casual therapy session. ALANA BLOOM Part of the process of recovery. And hiding what happened to you defeats the purpose of being here. Sharing will help normalize. ABIGAIL I’m not normal. Not anymore. ALANA BLOOM What happened to you isn’t normal. ABIGAIL Some of these women aren’t even sharing. They speak in little girl voices telling everyone what was done to them and how they hurt without saying a word about it. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 5. (CONTINUED)\n\n7. ALANA BLOOM Certain traumas can arrest vocal development. Victims can sometimes broadcast victimhood involuntarily. ABIGAIL (adjusts her scarf) Not me. ALANA BLOOM That’s not necessarily true. Your victimhood has a high profile, thanks to Freddie Lounds. ABIGAIL I’m a celebrity victim. Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes. Like I was that girl who did oral with President Clinton. ALANA BLOOM How did that make you feel? ABIGAIL Like I wanted to go home. But I don’t have a home anymore, do I? ALANA BLOOM You will. I’ll help you find it. ABIGAIL Would’ve been my mom’s birthday yesterday. We were gonna climb Eagle Mountain to celebrate. Highest point in Minnesota, but it’s not really that high. Less than three hours to summit. You can see Lake Superior from there. ALANA BLOOM We could go there and scatter your mother’s ashes, if you like. ABIGAIL I would like that. ALANA BLOOM Abigail, I want you to give the support groups another chance. ABIGAIL Support groups are sucking the life out of me through a narrow straw. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 6. CONTINUED: 7 7 (CONTINUED)\n\n8. ALANA BLOOM Isolating yourself can suck just as hard and through an even narrower straw. You have to find someone to relate to in this experience. ON HANNIBAL LECTER He scribbles in a PATIENT NOTEBOOK. We are -- INT. HANNIBAL’S OFFICE - NIGHT 1 8 8 Hannibal looks up as the BUZZER on his desk RINGS. INT. HANNIBAL’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 9 9 Hannibal OPENS the door to find Alana Bloom waiting for him. ALANA BLOOM Hi. HANNIBAL (wry) Do you have an appointment? ALANA BLOOM Do you have a beer? INT. HANNIBAL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 10 10 Alana clinks her beer bottle to Hannibal’s wine glass. HANNIBAL Interesting day with Abigail? ALANA BLOOM The grief work, the trauma intervention, it’s all on course. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 7. CONTINUED: (2) 7 7 (MORE) (CONTINUED)\n\n9. But I think she may be wrestling with a low-grade depression. Drolly eyeing the large swig Alana takes of her beer -- HANNIBAL She? ALANA BLOOM Nothing wrong with a little self- medication, right, Doctor? (then) Professional neutrality be damned, it’s hard to see such a bright, young girl go so adrift. HANNIBAL One can certainly lose perspective tucked away for weeks in an ivory tower. Perhaps it’s time Abigail’s released from clinical treatment. ALANA BLOOM Released where? Back into the wild? HANNIBAL Spending each day immersed in tragedy may be doing more harm than good. Abigail should be out in the world finding her footing, giving her the confidence to move forward. ALANA Abigail is in no condition to tackle real-world issues like where she’s going to live, what to do about school, hell, where her next meal is going to come from. HANNIBAL I’m not suggesting abandonment. ALANA BLOOM You and Will both feel responsible but do you really think it’s wise to insert yourselves in her life? HANNIBAL I am qualified to help her. ALANA BLOOM You’re the sanest man I know. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 8. CONTINUED: 10 10 ALANA BLOOM (CONT'D) (CONTINUED)\n\n10. HANNIBAL I would agree. ALANA You saved her life. But it doesn’t change the fact that Abigail’s been through what she’s been through. HANNIBAL Was there when she went through it. ALANA I can’t tell you what to do. But if you insist on taking a personal interest in her welfare, then you’d better understand, you can’t walk away, no matter what the outcome. HANNIBAL We break it, we buy it? ALANA This is a girl who was very attached to her parents. Overly so, in fact. You stepping in as a surrogate would only be a crutch. Abigail needs to work things out for herself in a safe, clinical environment. That will give her the confidence to move forward. Seeing Alana isn’t about to budge, Hannibal bows his head. HANNIBAL I defer to the passion of my esteemed colleague. ALANA Have soapbox, will travel. HANNIBAL Passion’s good. Gets blood pumping. OFF Hannibal appreciating the flush in Alana’s cheek...

TURNER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 1 11 11 Jack Crawford strides past the few LOCAL POLICE who control the scene as his TEAM gathers evidence -- A CHYRON reminds us we are -- BANGOR, MAINE -- Jimmy Price stands, PHOTOGRAPHING the dinner table of death. Brian Zellar is in a CROUCH, checking WOUND ANGLES. Beverly Katz collects FINGER PRINTS from a GLASS of SUNNY-D. Jack finds Will at a remove, looking at FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS. JACK CRAWFORD Karen and Roger Turner. Childhood sweethearts. Owned a successful Real Estate business. Pillars of the community. Three children. WILL GRAHAM Minus one. JACK CRAWFORD A son, Jesse, disappeared last year. Last confirmed sighting had him boarding an RV at a rest area on route forty-seven. Possible runaway, probable abduction. WILL GRAHAM Or both. JACK CRAWFORD Hundreds of tips, but not a single one held up past lunchtime. When misery rains, she pours. This sentiment is counter to the SMILING FACES in the PHOTOS. WILL GRAHAM Holidays, vacations, milestones... never reveals the whole picture. JACK CRAWFORD Who wants to fill their scrapbook with arguments and dirty laundry? WILL GRAHAM False faces in family portraits. Layers and layers of lies betrayed by a sad glint in a child’s eyes. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 10. (CONTINUED)\n\n12. ON JIMMY PRICE He SNAPS a PHOTO of the DINNER TABLE, commenting -- JIMMY PRICE Norman Rockwell with a bullet. JACK CRAWFORD Any signs of forced entry? BEVERLY KATZ Perimeter is clean of scoring and rupture. No broken windows or torn screens. It’s all sealed up tight. JACK CRAWFORD They probably rang the doorbell. BEVERLY KATZ I’ve got bullet holes on the upper sections of the wall and ceiling. JACK CRAWFORD Pull the slugs for ballistics. BEVERLY KATZ If they aren’t frangible, it shouldn’t be a problem. BRIAN ZELLER Those elevated termination points match what I see on these bodies -- Zellar moves toward the table, indicating what he means -- BRIAN ZELLAR -- angled cranial impacts, coupled with acute exit wounds and conical spray, the shooter was firing from low to high, probably crouched. JIMMY PRICE Or maybe they were Hobbits. This odd information strikes a chord of epiphany for Will, he MOVES BACK toward that collection of FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS. WILL GRAHAM How long since Jesse was abducted? JACK CRAWFORD Just over a year. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 11. CONTINUED: 11 11 (CONTINUED)\n\n13. Returning to the stack of photos, Will stops on one in particular: a much younger version of the missing boy. THE PHOTO Six-year-old JESSE TURNER holds a STUFFED OCTOPUS, one of its dangling arms in his mouth. His mother sweetly looks on. The PHOTO CLEARS FRAME REVEALING we are now -- INT. B.A.U - MORGUE - DAY 2 12 12 The CORPSES of MOTHER TURNER, FATHER TURNER, and their TWO CHILDREN (in body bags or covered in sheets) are presented on slabs for inspection. Jack faces Zellar, Price, Katz, and Graham. He’s like a demanding father, presiding over his children as they present what they’ve just learned at school. Will stands slightly apart, not quite fitting into this surrogate family. BRIAN ZELLAR I’m glad we didn’t have guns in my house. I would’ve shot my sisters to get them out of the bathroom. BEVERLY KATZ I liked having a big family. JIMMY PRICE My parents gave me a gift. A twin. Why wouldn’t you want two of me? BRIAN ZELLER (to Will) Must’ve been an only child. WILL GRAHAM Why do you say that? BRIAN ZELLER Family friction is a catalyst for personality development. An odd remark, but Beverly swoops in to take the sting away. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 12. CONTINUED: (2) 11 11 (CONTINUED)\n\n14. BEVERLY KATZ I was the oldest, so all the friction rolled down hill. JACK CRAWFORD The attention and responsibilities given to firstborn children prime them for future success. BEVERLY KATZ Here I am. Livin’ the dream. WILL GRAHAM Any favoring of another sibling could undermine the oldest’s ability to handle stress. BEVERLY KATZ My baby sister got away with murder. She had ‘em all fooled. JIMMY PRICE I thought middle were the problems. BRIAN ZELLAR The middle is the sweet spot. WILL GRAHAM Always trying to figure out where they fit in. Forces them to use different strategies navigating up and down developmental spectrums. They can be great politicians. (then) Or lousy ones. Jack Crawford, who has been studying the crime scene photos as he looks over each of the bodies, observes: JACK CRAWFORD All of the victims have defensive wounds. Except for Mrs. Turner. Jack hands Will the crime scene photos of Mrs. Turner. WILL GRAHAM There’s acceptance in her body position. Forgiveness, even. Will realizes that he missed something that Jack didn’t. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 13. CONTINUED: 12 12 (CONTINUED)\n\n15. JACK CRAWFORD (prodding) What kind of victim forgives her killer at the moment of her death? Never taking his eyes off Jesse’s mother -- WILL GRAHAM A mother. CUT TO BLACK. END OF ACT ONE HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 14. CONTINUED: (2) 12 12\n\n16. ACT TWO INT. HANNIBAL’S OFFICE - NIGHT 2 13 13 Hannibal sits opposite Will, smiling warmly before asking: HANNIBAL Tell me about your mother. WILL GRAHAM That’s some lazy psychiatry, Dr. Lecter. Low hanging fruit. HANNIBAL I suspect that fruit is on a high branch, very difficult to reach. WILL GRAHAM So’s my mother. I never knew her. HANNIBAL An interesting place to start. WILL GRAHAM Tell me about your mother. Let’s start there. Quid pro quo. A fan of the language, Hannibal enjoys Will’s use of Latin. HANNIBAL Both my parents died when I was very young. The proverbial orphan until I was adopted by my Uncle Robertas when I was 16. Will considers that, understanding Hannibal a little more clearly than before -- or so he thinks. WILL GRAHAM You have orphan in common with Abigail Hobbs. HANNIBAL I think we’ll discover you and I have a great deal in common with Abigail. She’s already demonstrated an aptitude for the psychological. (then) Quid pro quo. Will is unwilling to return the volley. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 15. (CONTINUED)\n\n17. WILL GRAHAM There’s something so foreign about family. Like an ill-fitting suit. Never connected to the concept. HANNIBAL You created a family for yourself. WILL GRAHAM I created a pack of strays. Thanks for feeding them while I was away. Hannibal nods his “you’re welcome,” then: HANNIBAL I was referring to Abigail Hobbs. Hannibal lets Will get used to that idea, then: HANNIBAL (CONT’D) Tell me about the Turner Family. Were they affluent? Well to do? WILL GRAHAM They lived like they had money. HANNIBAL Did your family have money, Will? WILL GRAHAM We were poor. I followed my father from the boat yards in Biloxi and Greenville to lake boats on Erie. HANNIBAL Always the new boy at school? Always the stranger? WILL GRAHAM Yes. HANNIBAL Harboring a half-buried grudge against the rich? WILL GRAHAM Aren’t we all. HANNIBAL What grudge was Mrs. Turner’s killer harboring against her? HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 16. CONTINUED: 13 13 (CONTINUED)\n\n18. WILL GRAHAM Motherhood. HANNIBAL Not motherhood, a perversion of it. A BEAUTIFUL PLATTER OF BLOOD SAUSAGE We are -- INT. HANNIBAL’S HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 2 14 14 Hannibal dishes a generous portion of sausage onto Jack Crawford’s plate. Jack fills his lungs with the aroma. HANNIBAL A modified Bouidin Noir from Ali- Bab’s Gastronomie Pratique. JACK CRAWFORD Ali-Bab? HANNIBAL An engineer who, after losing his sense of appetite, spent the remainder of his life cooking for his brother. He developed a theory that great cultures meet their ends solely as a result of their cuisines becoming too decadent. JACK CRAWFORD You’ll meet your end if my wife catches you fattening up my liver. HANNIBAL Perfect for foie gras. (then) You promised to deliver your wife to my dinner table. JACK CRAWFORD We’ve got to polish our act. Can’t have you diagnosing our marital problems in one fell swoop. (then) What am I about to put in my mouth? HANNIBAL Rabbit. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 17. CONTINUED: (2) 13 13 (CONTINUED)\n\n19. JACK CRAWFORD (digging in) Should have hopped faster. HANNIBAL Yes, he should have. But fortunately for us, he did not. Jack takes a bite and savors the rich taste of blood sausage. JACK CRAWFORD Our friend Will seemed haunted today. More than usual. Thought maybe it was the nature of the case. A murdered family. HANNIBAL I doubt the age and relationship of the victims he’s investigating would affect his professionalism. JACK CRAWFORD Then what would? HANNIBAL We don’t know what nightmares lie coiled beneath Will’s pillow. JACK CRAWFORD We don’t? You should. HANNIBAL The first small bond to a killer itches and stings like a leech, that may be the distraction. JACK CRAWFORD Maybe it’s not such a small bond. Children killing other children. Not an unfamiliar notion for Will. HANNIBAL You still suspect Abigail Hobbs in her father’s crimes. JACK CRAWFORD Doesn’t matter what I suspect. It matters what I can prove. Ms. Hobbs has been absolved of any crime. HANNIBAL Yet? HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 18. CONTINUED: 14 14 (CONTINUED)\n\n20. JACK CRAWFORD The nightmare under Will’s pillow may be that he was wrong about her. HANNIBAL A more innocuous theory. JACK CRAWFORD Please. HANNIBAL Children transport us to our childhoods. Will may feel the tug of life before the FBI, before you. Simpler times in boat yards with dad. That life is an anchor streamed behind him in heavy weather. He needs an anchor, Jack. ON A PAIR OF BOYS’ SNEAKERS They have WELL-WORN SOLES, a DUCT-TAPED RIP in the canvas upper, a DOODLE on the rubber toe cap. We are -- INT. B.A.U. - FORENSICS LAB - DAY 3 15 15 BEVERLY KATZ inspects the sneakers. Jimmy Price dusts for prints at a nearby table, everything from VIDEO GAME CONTROLLERS to a FLUSH HANDLE from a toilet. He’s currently dusting a SODA POP can collected from an evidence crate. JIMMY PRICE Got the blurred print of a nose off a soda-pop can. Someone could use a Biore blackhead strip. BEVERLY KATZ One pair of size-six sneakers from the Turner house. Tread on left indicates uneven leg length. JIMMY PRICE Is that unusual? INCLUDE THE MORGUE BAY Brian Zeller works on the FOUR BODIES of the TURNER FAMILY, discreetly covered by sheets. BRIAN ZELLER Not in a 12 year-old. Growth plates are all out of whack.

Lived in the Turner’s house for a week after they were dead. Ordered pizza and Pay Per View Movies. Porn. Lots of porn. BEVERLY KATZ There’s a strong bond of aggressive and sexual drives that occurs in sadists at an early age. BRIAN ZELLER I didn’t turn out to be a sadist. BEVERLY KATZ How did Jesse Turner turn out? No one has seen him in almost a year. BRIAN ZELLER I’ve extrapolated present height and weight from abduction stats. Brian Zeller measures the corpses of the other Turner kids. BRIAN ZELLER (CONT’D) Even with the usual growth spurt between eleven and twelve, he’d be at most around four-and-a-half feet tall. Maybe eighty pounds. Jimmy dusts a VIDEO GAME CONTROLLER from an EVIDENCE BOX, pulling prints and scanning them into the COMPUTER. JIMMY PRICE God’s gift to trace analysts. Gorgeous fingerprints all over these things. No matches, but they’re gorgeous. Nothing forecasts violence like a first person shooter. BEVERLY KATZ Isolated 7 pairs of shoe prints, filtered out the Turners, including Jesse’s, so we’re down to three UNSUBS. Sneakers are a size 7, a 3- and-a-half and a boy’s 11.

WILL GRAHAM Most of the time in sexual assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center, a suck bruise. In certain cases, they do not. For some killers, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. Jack Crawford ENTERS crossing to the front of the hall. JACK CRAWFORD Class dismissed. Everybody out. (off their hesitation) What did I just say? HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 21. CONTINUED: (4) 15 15 (CONTINUED)\n\n25. The F.B.I. TRAINEES gather their books and quickly EXIT. WILL GRAHAM You’re making it difficult to provide an education, Jack. JACK CRAWFORD We found a match for a set of prints pulled from the Turner house. They belong to Connor Frist, a 13 year-old from Huntsville. WILL GRAHAM Another kid? JACK CRAWFORD Another missing kid. Vanished 10 months ago. Case never solved. WILL GRAHAM Good news, Mr. and Mrs. Frist. Your son’s alive. Bad news, he’s a suspect in four murders. JACK CRAWFORD Four so far. WILL GRAHAM How many kids in the Frist family? JACK CRAWFORD Three.

BEVERLY KATZ Hydrostatic shock of shell hitting skull would’ve caused brain damage. WILL GRAHAM Her body went into convulsions. Conner Frist went into a panic. He had been prepped to shoot his mother, but not watch her suffer. Zeller turns Mrs. Frist's head to the side revealing another entry wound that is clearly bigger. BRIAN ZELLER Shot her again to put her out of her misery. Different gun. BEVERLY KATZ Larger caliber. JIMMY PRICE So someone else shot Connor’s mom.

HANNIBAL Can’t you? (then) Tell me. Why were you so angry? WILL GRAHAM I’m angry about these boys. I’m angry cause I know when I find them, I can’t help them.

LINCOLN Don’t be sad about Connor. EVA Connor didn’t choose us. He tried but I guess I didn’t do a very good job being his mother. C.J. LINCOLN It’s not your fault. EVA I couldn’t make him understand. The family you’re born into isn’t really family. Those are just people you didn’t choose. You have to make family. That’s what we’re doing. We’re making our family. Chris O’Halloran works up the courage to ask: CHRIS O’HALLORAN What happened to your family? C.J. LINCOLN We’re her family. CHRIS O’HALLORAN I meant your other family. EVA I had a brother like you boys have brothers. He showed me that the family you think is family is just a stepping stone to real family. C.J. LINCOLN You have to step on that stone.

Eva fumbles through her purse standing at the CHECK-OUT COUNTER. Chris turns to see he is being watched. C.J. Lincoln’s cold, dead stare cuts right through Chris, who shrinks from the other boy’s gaze. After a moment, Eva looks up from her purse and realizes: EVA Oh, honey. Eva begins clutching napkins off the counter next to the spinning hot dog warmer, sopping up the urine from the floor as she apologizes profusely to the CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK. EVA (CONT’D) I’m so sorry. He’s never done this before. I’ll pay for the napkins. CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK Don’t worry about it.

HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 41. CONTINUED: 33 33\n\n51. EXT. O’HALLORAN HOUSE - GAZEBO - SAME TIME 34 34 ON CHRIS O'HALLORAN, running for his life. WILL GRAHAM Chris, stop. Chris pulls up short. He turns around. And we see that in his hand is a GUN. WIDENING, to reveal Will and several SWAT GUYS taking positions ten yards away from Chris. WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D) (to SWAT) Don’t shoot. (to Chris) You don’t have to worry about C.J. anymore. It’s okay. You’re home now. Put down the gun, Christopher. Chris shuffles on his feet, eyes welling. And this is when Will has a realization -- WOMAN’S VOICE Shoot him, Christopher. ANOTHER FIGURE emerges from the shadows. It’s Eva, the woman seen at the end of Act Three. She too has a gun in her hand, but it’s at the back of Christopher’s spine. EVA Shoot him for me. (to Will) Drop your gun. For my boy. WILL GRAHAM You’re his new mother. EVA I am. And I love him, but I will do what I have to do for my family. WILL GRAHAM You abducted these boys. Your “son” C.J. killed your other “son” Connor. You burned his remains to honor him as his mother. She studies Will, how dare he question her motherhood. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 42. (CONTINUED)\n\n52. EVA I’m honoring them like their other mothers wouldn’t. They’re not invisible anymore. I can see them. I see who they are and love them. WILL GRAHAM Be Christopher’s mother now. Protect him. Don’t murder him. EVA The most loving mothers commit murder with smiles on their faces. They force us to destroy the person we are. A subtle kind of murder. Will lets the gun FALL TO THE GROUND. EVA (CONT’D) Shoot him, Christopher. Like I showed you. Chris’s traumatized glance pierces Will’s heart. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 42A. CONTINUED: 34 34 (CONTINUED)\n\n53. WILL GRAHAM Christopher, please. She raises her gun. BLAM! The shot is so immediate and unexpected that Will checks his stomach to see where the bullet hit. It takes a moment for Will to realize he hasn’t been hit at all. Eva spins, her shoulder erupting in a cloud of arterial spray as she is hit. Chris’s arm goes limp at his side. REVERSE TO REVEAL BEVERLY KATZ, gun outstretched, smoke issuing from the barrel. Will kneels in front of Chris, gently taking the gun from his hand. Will watches as Beverly moves in and almost motherly guides Chris away. Will crosses to fallen Eva on the ground; she takes sharp breaths, tensing through the pain. As the SWAT TEAM surrounds her, Will stares down at her. Condemnation at what she’s done to these boys... INT. F.B.I. TACTICAL VAN - NIGHT 5 A35 A35 Chris O’Halloran sits on a bench, alone. After a moment, the back doors OPEN, blasting daylight and silhouetting Jack Crawford as he ENTERS. He sits opposite the small boy, who does not look up at the imposing man studying him. Finally: CHRIS O’HALLORAN Can I go home now? JACK CRAWFORD No. You might not get to go home for a long time... (then) You came here to kill your family. That’s all anybody knows. That’s all anyone may ever believe. CHRIS O’HALLORAN I wasn’t going to do it. JACK CRAWFORD You’re going to talk to a lot of people who will try to understand exactly what you were going to do. CHRIS O’HALLORAN Am I going to jail? HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 43. CONTINUED: (2) 34 34 (CONTINUED)\n\n54. JACK CRAWFORD I don’t think you have the capacity to plan and execute murder. The civilized thing to do with you would be counseling and rehabilitation, not prison. CHRIS O’HALLORAN She told me they weren’t my family. That we had to make our own family. (then) Do you have a family? JACK CRAWFORD I don’t have children, no. CHRIS O’HALLORAN Then you don’t know what it’s like. JACK CRAWFORD I wish to god you hadn’t gone with that woman, but you did. All of that can’t just suddenly be undone. But in time, if you trust me, we can start undoing what we can. CHRIS O’HALLORAN Can I talk to my mom? My real mom? JACK CRAWFORD In a little while, but right now I need you to talk to me. INT. HANNIBAL’S HOME - FOYER - NIGHT 5 35 35 Hannibal holds the door open as Alana Bloom ENTERS, annoyed with him and searching for the words to express it. ALANA BLOOM As someone who makes such a big deal about common courtesy, I’m a little taken aback, slash a lot taken aback, that you would check my patient, my patient, out of the hospital without permission. I’m not a professional scold. Don’t put me in this position ever again. HANNIBAL I’m sorry. ALANA BLOOM Rude, Hannibal. Shockingly rude. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 43A. CONTINUED: A35 A35 (CONTINUED)\n\n55. HANNIBAL You have every right to be upset with me. I overstepped my bounds. ALANA BLOOM Where is she? HANNIBAL She’s in the dining room. HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 43B. CONTINUED: 35 35 (CONTINUED)\n\n56. Alana moves toward the dining room, but Hannibal puts a gentle hand on her shoulder to slow her down. HANNIBAL (CONT’D) Alana, you were right. ALANA BLOOM Often am. Have to be more specific. HANNIBAL She wasn’t ready to leave the hospital. She experienced a bit of anxiety so I gave her a sedative. ALANA BLOOM A sedative? HANNIBAL Half a valium. She may be a little hazy. INT. HANNIBAL’S HOME - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 36 36 Hannibal and Alana ENTER to find Abigail sitting at the table with food and teacup in front of her. ABIGAIL Hi, Doctor Bloom. ALANA BLOOM (re: third place setting) You were expecting me? HANNIBAL In the interest of honesty, we were expecting Will Graham. But my phone calls went unreturned. (pulling out chair) Please. Sit down. Alana does as instructed. ABIGAIL Are you hungry? Hannibal made breakfast for dinner. ALANA BLOOM I could eat. Hannibal notices Abigail smiling and he and Alana. HANNIBAL What is it? What do you see? HANNIBAL - PROD. #104 - DBL GOLDENROD Collated 4/27/13 44. CONTINUED: (2) 35 35 (CONTINUED)"
