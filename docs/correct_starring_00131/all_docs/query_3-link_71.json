        "text": "THE SHINY RED HONDA\n\nChapter one\n\nI was thirteen tall and gangly when I first pulled on long trousers. What a relief that was; I was the longest streak of misery you were ever likely to see in the short ones. It was my last year at the National school in Newtown and the Master used every opportunity to drag me around the classroom shouting “just because you wear long trousers now O’ Brien, don’t think it makes you any smarter”. I wasn’t and it didn’t, but the Master was a law unto himself so I just kept my gob shut. There were discussions about what, if any, further education I was to get. Dungarvan was out I heard my father say; it was too far away and the fares were too expensive. That only left the ‘Tech in Portlaw - and that seemed to totter from one financial crisis to the next.\n\nWe were poor I guess; no running water, no toilets, to TV, no car…you name it we didn’t have it. But then, money wasn’t as important as it is nowadays. If you had enough to live on you were doing well. If you didn’t you wouldn’t starve because the countryside was abundant in most of the things needed to survive. Even the poorest cottage had half an acre of land attached, and enough spuds, cabbage and other vegetables could be grown to keep a family from the poorhouse. Hens provided eggs every day, a pig could be fattened and killed; and if you couldn’t afford turf or coal, well, there was plenty of wood scattered about…\n\nMy father worked in the Tannery in Portlaw, a Dickensian sprawl that tried to hide itself in the dense woodlands that ringed the town. It was fronted by massive wrought iron gates and had a lodge that was occupied by a gateman called Foskin and his buck-toothed daughters. A large square, bigger than the town itself it seemed, separated it from the streets that ran away from its outer rim. With names likes Georges Street, Brown Street and William Street the English influence was clear, and the only thing that differentiated one house from another was the colour of the doors. But then, it was a company town and they were company houses.\n\nThe first time I ever visited the Tannery was in our ass and cart with my father, to collect some empty barrels he had permission to remove. He took me to see the tanning department and showed me the bench where he worked. Here, he trimmed the hides prior to tanning, standing at a wooden table all day with his friend Bobby Haughton, dragging hides from a nearby pile, chopping the bad bits off. The place stank of dead meat and the pile of skins was crawling with maggots. They could have been abattoir workers; gowned up in their long aprons and wellingtons, constantly sharpening their hooked, wooden-handled knives.\n\nHew was up at six every morning, breakfasted and gone by seven. The six mile journey was negotiated on his high Nellie, which had only one gear and had to be pushed uphill. He always wore bicycle clips and carried a pump and a repair kit in his lunch bag. Occasionally, when snow and ice made the road treacherous, he walked to work. A day off was unthinkable.\n\nPortlaw had a bad reputation, like that of a loose woman. Although he worked there all his life he never socialised or mixed with the locals. He certainly never drank there. And mother would never dream of doing her weekly shopping there. People talked about Portlaw behind its back, yet on reflection it wasn’t any worse than Kilmac. Perhaps it was envy; it had the Tannery, the biggest employer in the region; it was surrounded by the magnificent estate of Curraghmore; it had the patronage of the titled gentry like the Marquis of Waterford. And of course it boasted hurling and football teams that invariably kicked the shit out of the lumbering hopefuls of Newtown, Ballydurn and the outlying areas.. Mostly though it was the ‘townie’ culture that got up the country-folks noses; it was only a few miles from the city and ‘city-ways’ had rubbed off to some extent.\n\nIts reputation never bothered me. I did manage to secure a place at the ‘Tech there and for eighteen months cycled daily, free-wheeling the last few miles from the Five Cross Roads down into the valley that housed it. The ’Tech consisted of a couple of rooms in a large house on the edge of the Square, where Mr Timmons taught us carpentry, ( we made shoe-boxes by the dozen, learned all about dove-tail joints, and made glue from boiled cow-hooves) and a tall, willowy lady taught us the rudiments of book-keeping. Neither pastime subsequently did me much good.\n\nWe put our free time to good use, invading the forbidden territory of the Tannery, watching from behind bushes and trees, the activities going on in the distance. One large shed was stacked with bales of various-coloured rubber and was ideal for playing the games of cowboys and Indians that we favoured. This rubber (I subsequently learnt ) was the raw material that was used in the moulding of the shoe-soles that were churned out by the thousand in the rubber department. The Tannery itself produced no shoes, just soles, insoles and rolls of coloured leather.\n\nSometimes we sat on the banks of the river Clodagh, reading our Kit Carson and Johnny Mack Brown comics, or practised our fast draws in the crouched style favoured by our heroes. My favourite weapon was a long-barrelled Colt 44 with ivory handles and a proper revolving chamber, which I had saved for nearly a year to buy. I took to wearing it to school, tucked inside the waistband of my trousers, until the day Miley Moore took it off me and broke it demonstrating his prowess as an outlaw. Attempting to side-swipe me, he missed and clubbed a rock instead. One half of it landed in the river, never to be seen again.\n\nThere were other diversions. Portlaw girls were supposed to be fast, something we discovered to be true, for no matter how hard we chased them we never managed to catch up. Sometimes when the weather was nice the girls from the bakery sat sunning themselves on the opposite bank. We admired their muscular arms and their floury faces, for very little else was visible beneath the long white coats and the elasticised head-coverings.\n\nOur learning curve may not have been very steep but the road home certainly was. The homeward journey was hell; the long climb back to the Five Roads couldn’t have been more tiring if it had been up the face of the Comeragh Mountains themselves. Portlaw wasn’t in a valley I had often heard my father mutter, it was at the bottom of a bloody pit.\n\nThere was also the little matter of getting safely past a particular farm. A seventh son of a seventh son lived there and all sorts of peculiar happenings went on inside. Sick animals and sick people traipsed in and out at all hours, ringworm was cured, and one woman who hadn’t said a word for twenty years suddenly started talking so much that her neighbours threatened to take her back and get the cure reversed. It was best to bless oneself and cycle quickly past.\n\nThe Five Roads was a kind of staging post, where we all recovered our breaths before going our different ways. A little whitewashed shop stood in the vee of two of the roads, where sweets and lemonade could be had over the half-door. Miley Moore called it a shebeen and said you could get bottles of Porter and poteen there too if you were that way inclined. We tried this once and the old woman who owned the shop chased us out, with her besom swinging. As we all took different routes she didn’t know which of us to follow, so she just stood in the middle of the road shaking her broom at us.\n\nI eventually followed in my father’s footsteps. My name had been down in the Tannery for years and as soon as I was old enough, and a vacancy occurred, I was summoned. I never gave it a second thought. It was expected of me, and I suppose my father had pulled a few strings to get me in.\n\n………………………………………..\n\nI guess Ballyhussa was much the same as any other cross-section of countryside out in the middle of nowhere. But to me it didn’t seem like that. It was home and it possessed my young soul and my growing body. I grew up there - and bits of me stayed there. In the hedges and furze bushes; in the groves and ploughed fields; in the streams and ponds. In the mass-path, in Newtown school, and in ‘The Bungalow’, with its patches of stony ground that we raked and raked but never could quite rid of stones.\n\nOn some mornings the Comeragh Mountains seemed to be in our back garden, on others they had retreated to another county. A mystery never fathomed by us youngsters. Did all mountains move we wondered? Their nearness signalled rain according to father; the further away they appeared the more settled the weather would be. Like most country-folk he was an expert weather-forecaster - in his own eyes anyhow - and he cast his eyes heavenwards with the same frequency that people nowadays look at their watches. For my own part, I always found the animals more reliable. Cattle, sheep and dogs were no fools when it came to the weather, and could be seen scurrying for cover long before the storm-clouds appeared.\n\nSometimes the tops of the Comeraghs were capped in a layer of snow so white it hurt your eyes to look at them, a sight that had the Master urging us to describe the view in poetic terms.\n\nThe Himalayas never looked so bright\n\nAs the Comeraghs do tonight\n\nTheir new overcoats bespoke,\n\nOvernight.\n\nEight miles in the other direction lay the sea. The Atlantic Ocean gnawing away at Ireland’s coastline like a hungry beast, according to the Master, sending currents of bracing air to collide with those sweeping down from the Comeraghs. The result was a fertile plain fit for both man and beast.\n\nMost nights you could see light twinkling in the distance. The bright city lights of Waterford, and, further away, the dimmer glow of Tramore. Here, the Metal Man could be seen, sweeping the Atlantic with a raking beam every ten seconds or so. Further along the coast lay Boatstrand, Bonmahon, Stradbally and Dungarvan, the latter just about discernible on a clear night.\n\nBallyhussa boreen was long and winding and Newtown village lay a mile and a half distant by road. By the mass-path, however, it was less than half that journey. The mass-path was our regular route to the village and we had used it for going to school and mass for as long as I could remember. It began about a hundred yards from our cottage at the stile (a couple of stepping-stones leading into the field) and was a clearly defined path across the land until it reached the road just outside the village. I suppose that the cows who grazed there, and who quite often followed the path in our wake, helped to preserve it. However, even in later years, when much of the land was tilled, it could still be seen scything its way through shimmering corn. Its origin was never quite clear; it may have been a legacy of the penal times, or it may merely have been a long-established short-cut to the church in Newtown.\n\nGoing to school never took more than fifteen minutes, coming home could take hours. The first couple of fields formed part of Michael Cummins’ farm, and this halfway stage was our usual stopping point. This was mainly because it contained a small pond and was surrounded by clumps of bushes. Depending on the season, there would be frogs’ eggs to inspect, birds’ nests to look at, Ice to be tested with belly-slides. Then there were all those games of cowboys and Indians to be played, our bows made from young sallys sprung with binder twine, our arrows carved from ash twigs. Tom Cummins, who was in the same class as me, was usually the one tied to the tree as we danced and whooped around him. Well, it was his tree…\n\nThe two other fields that comprised the mass-path were fairly uninteresting, although the last one, which bordered Power’s half-acre, had us stepping lively across it. Pat Power’s plot, with its remains of an old building, was haunted. It was overgrown and dank in there, surrounded by twisted and tangled trees and undergrowth. On windy nights you could hear the banshee wailing from deep within, and on a number of occasions we had witnessed several ghostly figures dancing among the ruins.\n\nThese sightings were seen on our return from attending the Lenten Devotions with mother. Despite being fortified with her bout of prayer, she, nevertheless, lengthened her stride as we approached, blessing herself as she dragged us youngsters with her in an undignified scramble down Cummins’ hill. On one occasion a pair of ghosts shot past us on bicycles, their white robes billowing behind them like sail-cloths as they disappeared into the night. I had never seen ghosts on bicycles before, and when mother found one of her best linen sheets shoved in the hedge near Galvin’s pump, relations with our next-door neighbours were cool for a while. Dick Galvin, who sometimes fetched our milk from Cummins, wasn’t seen around our house for some time after that.\n\nThe mass-path deposited us at Newtown Cross, a dark tree-lined junction which rarely saw sunlight, and was used as a giant umbrella when it rained. Motor transport, when it appeared, blew long and hard at this intersection - more than ever since the day a wandering ass almost spread-eagled itself across the bonnet of Paddy Nugent’s nearly-new car. His shiny black Morris Minor, which only infrequently broke into anything quicker than a trot, slowed to an almost permanent walking pace after that.\n\nMost of the land around the Newtown Cross belonged to Jamsie Wall, and the farmyard was almost as dark and foreboding as Power’s half acre. It wasn’t haunted, least not by conventional ghosts, but Jamsie’s scowling countenance was enough to ensure we youngsters steered well clear of the place. Wall’s was a ‘grab farm’, its original owners, the O’Callaghans, having being evicted from it before it came into the ownership of the Walls. There was still bad feeling in the neighbourhood about the whole affair, and local farm workers would have nothing to do with the farm. My grandfather, Tom O’Brien, had worked there at one stage, though he could hardly be described as local, having come from Ballyduff some eight miles away. In the ploughing and tilling season Walls hired in men from outside, mainly from the Nire Valley. These men didn’t care too much about the sensibilities of the locals, and could be seen in the early morning marching along the road as a body, banging their shovels and sprongs on the road surface as they went.\n\nThere wasn’t much of Newtown; the church, the school, two pubs and Lenihen’s grocery shop. Behind it, in the shadows of the Comeraghs, the land rose to wooded pastures and isolated groves of fir and pine. In front, the fields were barer and sloped down to Dunphy’s Cross and the New Line. It was here that the Master alighted from the Dungarvan bus each morning, before striding across the intervening fields to try and knock some sense into us in classrooms forever smelling of chalk.\n\n‘There are nine Newtowns in Waterford’, he would boom, ‘and eight of them are imposters. Can anybody tell me why?’ We couldn’t, of course. When someone suggested it might be the original site for the city of Waterford he laughed - a rare occurrence.\n\n‘And why, tell me, would the Danes build their city in the middle of the country? How would they get their ships up the Suir?’\n\nOn one occasion he took the whole class to the playing field at the back of the school and pointed to the two rows of gnarled ash trees that ran parallel through Walls farm as far as Newtown Cross.\n\n‘This avenue of ash is several hundred years old and was probably planted by a man called William Greatorix. He intended to build a new town here alright, but not to replace Waterford. He intended to replace Kilmac. And that is how we got our name’.\n\n‘Greatorix was, or had been, a wealthy man who travelled Ireland making up potions to cure all sorts of afflictions and ailments. A kind of early medicine-man, one might say. His fame spread to such an extent that he was summoned by the King of England to try and cure his sick son. He wasn’t successful and from then on his fortunes deteriorated, one of the consequences being that ‘ Newtown’ never got built’.\n\nLocal history was the Master’s pet subject. On foraging expeditions to the church we searched the graveyard for traces of old ruins. He informed us that there was evidence of some sort of church on the site going back 900 years, and asked John Mullins, the local gravedigger, to keep an eye out for these ruins.\n\n‘Sure isn’t the place full of ould ruins’, John replied, ‘mostly human ones’.\n\nThe graveyard’s most famous resident was Donncha Rua MacConnamara, an itinerant Irish poet originally from County Clare. He had travelled as far as Newfoundland and lived in West Waterford before ending his days on the Shanahan farm at Whitestown Cross, a couple of miles away. A woman’s man and a heavy drinker, he was reputed to have frequented Cullinane’s pub, directly across the road from where he now lay buried.\n\nAs a young man he was sent to Rome to study for the priesthood, but he never completed his studies, being expelled for drunkenness and other ‘inappropriate behavior’.\n\nAfter that, he led a wandering life, (this wanderlust remained with him all his life), and he seldom settled long anywhere. ‘Ban Chnoic Eireann O’ (The Fair Hills Of Eire), his classic lyric of exile, was written while in Hamburg.\n\nTake a blessing from my heart to the land of my birth\n\nAnd the fair hills of Eire O’\n\nAnd all that yet survive of Eibhear’s tribe on earth…\n\nWhen he did return to Ireland it was to Waterford he came, and he traveled around the countryside as a teacher, the fate of the ‘spoilt priest’, as his like were known in those days. In 1741 he was appointed assistant master at famous classical school at Seskinane, Tournaneena, Co Waterford, where he remained for several years. Of course Ireland was still in the grip of the Penal Laws in those days, but the Cromwellian diktat that all native Irish had tails, and that no Catholic could own land or be a civil servant or teach or own a horse worth more than five pounds wasn’t pursued as vigorously as previously, so Donncha survived.\n\nAs well as the drink, Donncha also liked the women, and in 1743 he had to make a hasty departure from Waterford to escape the wrath of a family whose daughter he had made pregnant. He traveled by fishing boat to Newfoundland, where he lay low until things quietened down.\n\nA subsequent second trip to Newfoundland, where he was said to have written his famous long poem ‘Eachtra Giolla an Amarain’ (The adventures of an unfortunate man) now seems likely to have been a hoax. It appears he got no further than Waterford city, where, instead of boarding his ship he spent his time drinking and womanizing until all his money was gone. Afterwards, in an effort to convince people he really had been there, he wrote the long poem (360 verses) which tells how the emigrant ship was attacked and captured by French pirates, before eventually making it safely to Newfoundland.\n\nShortly after this he changed his religion and became the church clerk at the Church Of Ireland in Rossmire, just outside Newtown. However, his rakish way of life once again found him out and he was dismissed.\n\nHe was a happy-go-lucky individual whose poems and songs were part of the folklore in County Waterford . Unfortunately, a lot of them died with the Irish language\n\nOne of Donncha’s last pieces of writing was an inscription in Latin on the headstone of one of his contemporaries, the Irish poet Tadgh Gaeleach O’Sulleabhain, who is buried just a few miles away in Ballylaneen.\n\nTadgh is put here…\n\nWho will sing the praises of the Irish?\n\nWho the deeds of men?\n\nWith Gaelic Tadgh dead the Irish muses are silent….\n\nThe same could be written of Donncha Rua. He died in 1810 in Newtown, where he had been a temporary protestant, but is now very much a permanent Catholic in an unmarked grave to the rear of the church.. The inscription on the commemorative headstone (inside front entrance) ends with these lines\n\n‘If whatever sins he committed have been wiped out by penance, give him, oh Lord, eternal rest in the true motherland’.\n\nJohn Mullins, who also dabbled in local history, liked to create the impression that he was an expert on Donncha Rua. To this extent he claimed that Maggie Bluett, who lived in one of the cottages up our boreen , was a direct descendant of Donncha. This was something Maggie neither confirmed or denied. He also took tourists on guided tours of the graveyard and to the farm in Whitestown, presumably being paid for his trouble. Finally there came his piece-de-resistance, a large stone by the side of the road, no more than a hundred yards from his own cottage, with the initials DM carved on it. These, he claimed, were carved by Donncha’s own hand.\n\nMany years later I learned it was John’s own hand. The best days work he ever done; it kept him in drink for most of his life.\n\n…………\n\nTwo components of the village held more fascination for us than all the others put together. One was the village pump, which could be persuaded, after several minutes of wheezing and croaking, to produce a rust-coloured liquid. This eventually turned to water but it never lost its rusty taste. The other was Lenihan’s shop. Inside there was all kind of trove; penny toffees, bulls-eyes, blackjacks, gobstoppers, and gallon sweets of all shapes and sizes. One shelf was devoted exclusively to those clear jars - dozens of them - which never seemed to empty. Some days all we could do was gaze longingly at them and watch enviously as other teeth bit into succulent toffees, other hands dipped lollipops into firmly clutched fizz bags. There were times when I hated Margaret and Tessy Lenihen; they never had to pay for anything and could dip their pudgy little hands into any jar they wished.\n\nOf the pubs Culinane’s was marginally more interesting than Nugents - if only because of the orchard at the rear. Here one could eat one’s fill without too many distractions. And sometimes Bridgie Culinane was willing to pay us a shilling or so for a few hours spent picking the apples.\n\nNugent’s had little to recommend it - although we were sometimes rewarded with a sighting of old Mrs Nugent by squinting through the side window. Dressed in black from head to foot, her face was often the same colour, for she invariably sat in the hob of the open fireplace. Her main pre-occupation seemed to be going to the church to pray. She had a path worn to it according to John Mullins. Strangely, this devotion hadn’t rubbed off on Paddy, the son who looked after both farm and pub. We concluded he must be a pagan.\n\nThere was another son, Edmond, but he was mad. What form this madness took I never found out, but he spent most of his life in the Mental Home in Waterford, occasionally cycling out to the village for a visit, but always returning again before nightfall.\n\nOnce inside the school walls we had little choice but to learn.. It was a prison from which there was no escape - not until we had finished sixth book anyhow. And by then a mixture of beating, bullying and cajoling had ensured that even the stupidest of us had learnt something.\n\nThere were two classrooms. Mrs Coffey took everyone up to third book and the Master took fourth, fifth, and sixth. Some in the sixth year had been kept back a year or two and John Mullins, who also looked after the school grounds, was often heard to remark; ‘Christ, there’s some hairy youngsters going to school these days. A few more years and they’ll be drawing the pension’.\n\nBoth teachers used the cane indiscriminately, the Master bolstering it with a variety of other persuaders. These included grabbing you by the fleshy bit under your chin and raising you up ‘till you were standing on your toes, then dragging you around the classroom and wiping your nose on the blackboard to make his point.\n\nNothing fazed us though; the pain and humiliation was swept from your mind as soon as break time came round. Bottles of milk and bread-and-jam sandwiches were hurriedly devoured before the serious business of playing could be attended to. Marbles were the currency of the playground - a boy with a pocketful was wealthy indeed. Three would buy a Buck Jones or Roy Roger comic; four conkers equalled one marble, and one with a star at its core could easily be traded for a fizz bag.\n\nThe bigger boys, scornful of anything thought unmanly, climbed the trees in Walls fields, sometimes hanging upside down making monkey sounds, or participated in vigorous games of hurling and football in the playing field behind the school. There were occasional inter-school matches, at which our ill-prepared teams usually got hammered. The girls’ lavatory always attracted its share of attention, the gaps between the walls and the corrugated roof acting as a magnet to the boldest of us. The hysterical shrieks of those girls inside, at the thought of some dirty-kneed, runny-nosed boy seeing the colour of their knickers, sometimes brought the teachers out. But by then all the peeping-toms had vanished.\n\nThe front playground was left almost exclusively to the girls, and here the chalk outlines of hopscotch and other girly games were on almost permanent display. Skipping, too, was a game almost exclusive to this area, and some of the routines were very elaborate and required a high degree of skill. One of the most popular was a chanted ditty which got progressively faster, until the contestant either completed five rounds or got knocked out. Most of the words pertained to the local priests;\n\n‘Tis going to rain said Father Keane\n\n‘Twill in a minute said Father Sinnott\n\n‘Tis only a shower said Father Power\n\n‘Arra go on! said Mary Dwan\n\nI wonder who Mary Dwan was?\n\nChapter two\n\nEvery year on St Brigids’ eve my mother hung a black tie or a strip of black cloth on the outside of our front door. She said that when St Brigids’ spirit passed over that night some of her healing powers would rub off on the cloth. After that, whenever one of us complained of a headache she got out her ‘Breegie’s Belt’ and tied it tightly round our heads, telling us it would take the pain away. It usually worked too. My father would shake his head and mutter something about ‘pisrogues’, but he himself wasn’t immune to strange behaviour.. Every time we passed a fairy ring for instance, he took off his cap and saluted. ‘The little people’, he insisted, ‘one day you’ll see them yourself, and then the grin will be on the other side of your face.’.\n\nThe first day of May saw another ritual enacted. Young nettles were collected from the side of the boreen and boiled in a skillet over our open fire. Each of us then had to eat a plateful - with mother standing over us to make sure we did. This was repeated three times throughout the month, after which we were all pronounced safe from all harm for the next twelve months.\n\n‘There was a healthy mistrust of doctors in our house. ‘Time enough to call them when you’re dying’, father would say. For both of them the old remedies were the best. Boils and blood-poisoned cuts were treated by applying hot bread poultices. Nettle-water was good for stomach ailments. The only medicines used with any frequency were castor oil, cod liver oil and syrup-of-figs. Castor oil was used to treat ear aches, heated and poured into the ear - excruciating enough - but it was cod liver oil that was the bane of our lives. Mother swore by it and poured it down our gullets for all sorts of ailments. The disgusting, oily taste lingered inside you for hours afterwards.\n\nNettle stings were a frequent occurrence in our short-trousers days, the quickest relief being obtained by rubbing a dock-leaf on the afflicted area. And to remove warts all you needed was a snail, rubbing the sticky substance on the wart. You then speared the snail to a blackthorn tree, and as it shrivelled up so did the wart.\n\nOnce, when I dislocated my ankle playing hurling at school, it wasn’t to the doctor or the hospital that mother took me but to the bone-setter in Dungarvan. This man operated from a dingy back room above a shop and I was in agony as I was carried up the stairs. Within minutes the bone-setter was massaging my leg and talking soothingly to me. A few quick movements with his hands and the bone slid back into place. The relief from pain was instantaneous and I walked down the stairs under my own steam. It had cost ten shillings. Not that a fee was ever mentioned, but I had seen the money discreetly change hands and disappear into my saviour’s pocket quicker than he had fixed my ankle.\n\nThe arrival of St Brigid’s day saw father come out of hibernation. The month of January had been a time to recharge his batteries, but the first day of February saw him surrounded by an assortment of tools, all laid out on the old pine table in the back shed. There were hammers, saws, pincers, crosscuts and billhooks. He never bought anything if he could make it himself; chairs, window-frames, doors, he hacked away at bits of wood with his selection of implements fashioning functional furniture and fittings. When these tools needed new handles he wouldn’t dream of buying new ones. Weren’t there plenty of trees about? The billhook was his favourite tool; he made an armchair once using mostly this implement, that had pride of place in the kitchen, and that no one else dared sit in except him. It was hard and upright; its only concession to comfort a chaff-filled cushion, but when he sat on it seemed to be part of him.\n\nMy grandfather, Tom O’Brien, had once made a horses cart for Sheehan’s, the next-door farmers, using mainly a billhook. It must have been a grand affair altogether for I had often heard it talked about afterwards by people in the neighbourhood. It may also account for father’s attachment to the humble billhook.\n\nWe youngsters were delighted when inspection time came round for it meant a trip across the fields for us. There would be river banks and bogs to cross, maybe even ice-covered ponds to negotiate.\n\nPlenty of small groves lay dotted about, mostly pine or spruce, though not so suitable as handle material. What father was after was a reasonably straight branch of ash or beech. Having found something suitable he hacked all the branches off it with his billhook before taking the saw to it. It wasn’t very elegant when it was pared and fitted to the implement but it did the job.\n\nWe were more interested in the animal signs we encountered along the way. Burrows were thoroughly investigated; rabbit warrens were fairly easy to recognise as the droppings were a giveaway. We studied the ground for signs of a path, somewhere suitable for a snare, and set our traps for the unsuspecting animals, checking them every morning to see if they bore fruit. Fox dens were rarer sights; those suspected of being so always aroused father’s interest. Hens and pullets disappeared on a regular basis despite his efforts to protect, and any suspected den got ‘the treatment’. Entrances were sealed up, others stuffed with oil-soaked rages and set alight. Either the foxes got used to smoking or they utilised other, secret, escape routes for very few were captured this way.\n\nBadgers were rarer still; shy creatures that only came out at night. Our Jack Russell knew all about their ferocity, having once been encouraged down what we mistakenly thought was a rabbit hole. He came back with a bit of his ear missing.\n\nBallyhussa boreen was roughly two miles long. Winding and overgrown, it degenerated to little more than a cart track once past our house. Clumps of ash and beech and the remains of several old farmyards were the only evidence that life had once existed beyond us. ‘The last outpost’, was how Dick Galvin referred to our house; and indeed there were days on end when our only companions were the cattle and sheep in the nearby fields.\n\nLike most of our neighbours, father grew all his own vegetables, and when we were big enough we were enlisted to help. About three quarters of our acre was under grass, the remainder being sown with potatoes. Every few years the tilled section was rotated to minimise the risk of disease.\n\nWork started by raking up all the old stalks and burning them. When father was satisfied he would spit on his hands, tilt the peak of his cap heavenwards and begin. He favoured a long-handled fork called a sprong, an implement which seemed to acquire the properties of a mechanical digger in his hands. Biting deep into the soil, he turned over a hefty chunk of it and pulverised it with a mighty whack from his sprong before it had time to settle. Dig, tilt, whack…dig, tilt, whack…this was the way he worked all through the day, except for the occasional pause to spit on his hands or push the cap back on his head. The exposed soil was then left for a few weeks for the elements to break it up some more.\n\nWhen the acre was finished there were several more plots requiring similar treatment.. Our acre was the only bit of land he owned; the others he paid a few shillings a year for their use. The Bungalow was an overgrown wilderness with a gate that hadn’t opened for years. Once a farmyard, it had been the home of Michael Francis Sheehan, a local poet who had published a book of poetry. Afterwards, it became part of Kelly’s farm, and galvanised bungalow was built for Jimmy Kiersey and his family. Jimmy worked as a farmhand at Kelly’s but had long since moved to a council house in nearby Ballyshunnock. The farmyard was now a warren of ivy-covered walls and stone floors, but there were still some fertile patches among the ruins. It was here that father grew his onions, cabbages and carrots. The bungalow still stood and he used this for rearing his few calves.\n\nOnce the digging was finished the preparations for sowing began in earnest. The dunghill at the back of the house was demolished; wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of it trundled across the acre and deposited over the dug area. The dunghill was a strange mixture of animal manure, ashes and household waste. When disturbed it steamed copiously and stank of urine. Father believed passionately in this concoction and never used anything else on his vegetables. There was also a dunghill in The Bungalow and this, too, was demolished. Any surplus was scattered on the acre to promote the grass, or taken to the Bog - father’s other bit of land.\n\nThe Bog was too far away to use the wheelbarrow so we used our ass and cart to transport it there. Neddy, our ass, spent most of his time with the sheep in the Bog, except during the coldest winter months when he lived in a shed behind the house. There were, in fact, a row of sheds out back; the cow-house, the hen house, the pig house, all built by father over the years. We called them the tar-barrel houses. At various times father collected empty barrels from the Tannery, cut the bottoms out using a cold-chisel and hammer, then split them down the middle and hammered them into flat sheets. These he used for roofing the wooden-frame sheds, waterproofing them with tar he got from friends who worked for the county council.\n\nNeddys cart occupied a lean-to at the side of the block, where it spent most of its time keeled up, shafts pointing skywards. It had at last been converted to rubber-tyre wheels by Bat Mansfield, the blacksmith who had a forge at Dunphy’s Cross. Its noiseless, easy movement after years of grinding metal-rimmed wheels must have surprised even Neddy because he actually consented to pull it these days. Previously he had to be beaten to do so.\n\nNeddy’s spell of inactivity during the winter months caused his hooves to grow long, consequently they needed paring before he could be tackled up. This could be a tricky operation for Neddy could kick harder than a mule - usually without any warning. Father reduced the risk somewhat by tying his back legs together when he wasn’t working on them. He then hoisted a free leg between his thighs and carved away at the hoof with his curved ‘leather knife’. He owned a selection of these, all honed to such sharpness he reckoned he could shave himself with one. When he had pared enough of the hoof away he smoothed it down with a rasp, before fitting shoes specially made by Bat Mansfield. He hammered the nails home till they came through the side of the hoof, clinching them to keep them in place.\n\nI wondered if Neddy felt any pain as he stood there, stoically chewing on a sop of hay as the nails were hammered in. Where was all the blood? Shouldn’t he be spouting the stuff? There was a picture of the Crucifixion at school, with Our Lord’s hands dripping blood where the nails pinned him to the cross. Maybe animals didn’t bleed like humans. They certainly didn’t bawl like them. When the Master asked Tomjoe Power what the letters INRI on the Cross stood for, and he said ‘Iron Nails Ran In’, you could hearing him roaring two fields away as he was dragged around the classroom by his ear.\n\nTackling up Neddy was usually my job. Once the winkers was on I fitted the collar and hames, the collar being buckled around his neck and the hames fitted over it. A piece of thin rope secured around the ears of the hames held it in position. The saddle was then slipped on and the belly-band tightened to hold it in place. After that the cart was dragged into position and the chain loops between the shafts attached to the broad groove in the saddle. All that then remained was for the traces to be linked to the hames.\n\nChoosing the seed potatoes was the next chore, and usually occupied a weekend. There were two potato pits; one for the seed potatoes and one for the eaters. These pits always reminded me of miniature thatched cottages; oblong, triangular-shaped mounds covered with straw and rushes to keep out the frost. The bottoms were banked up with earth to keep the rats at bay.\n\nWe carried the spuds to a bench in buckets, where father would do the ‘choosing’. They were examined carefully and any bad one discarded. By now they were beginning to sprout; dark ‘eyes’ shooting out from their skins to show they were healthy. The larger ones were sliced in two, the criteria being that each half possessed its own ‘eye’. All were then stored in one of the outhouses to harden out and sprout some more before being sowed.\n\nFather owned a long-handled shovel that he used for opening and closing drills. It was of the kind I had seen council workers lean on by the roadside, so perhaps one of them had had given it to him. He was deadly with it and shifted soil almost as fast as a horse-drawn plough. I remember trying to ape his actions but it still took me a long time to get anywhere near as proficient. He adopted a kind of crouch, knees slightly bent, arms extending and flicking scoops of soil to alternate sides. He moved through the clay as if it was sand, never slackening his pace except for the regular spit on his hands.\n\nWe filled the furrows ahead of him with seed potatoes, laying them eyes up on the manure. Each one had to be planted about a foot apart, and we used a wooden rod to space them. No matter how hard we worked he was always right behind us, urging us ever faster. When a drill was closed he tamped it down with the shovel to firm it up and break any lumpy bits of soil. Finally he criss-crossed the area with timber pegs and strung binder twine between them. This was to keep crows and other scavenging birds away. He supplemented this by sticking a scarecrow in the middle; a wooden cross dressed up in an old trousers and jumper stuffed with straw, one of his old caps nailed on as a head.\n\nOccasionally he hung a dead crow on a pole. This, too, had the desired effect. Once, he tried capturing a live one. He had heard of somewhere in Cork\n\nwhere they caught the live ones and tied coloured streamers to them before releasing them back among their compatriots. It was reckoned to frighten the living daylights out of the rest of them. He never got to prove the truth of it but he had no doubts; ‘those cute Cork hoors are fit for anything’.\n\nBy the time St Patricks’ day came round he usually had all his potatoes sown. It was a standing joke in the neighbourhood that if he hadn’t then he mustn’t be well. The rest of the vegetable were sown leisurely over the coming weeks; cabbage plants, carrots, parsnips and onions. Lettuce and spring onions were grown separately by mother in a little plot behind the house. Although she sometimes got her seed packets mixed up - and there might be nasturtiums and wallflowers sprouting among the salads come June.\n\nMy father was really a farmer at heart. Nothing meant as much to him as the land did. You could see it in his love for the way he coaxed and nurtured miracles from its often barren soil. Everything he touched grew tall for him; he grew the flouriest spuds, the biggest carrots, the juiciest cabbages. He was always first with the new potatoes, and many a neighbour went home with a bag-full on the handlebars of his bike singing his praises. All the shopkeepers knew of his reputation and frequently urged him to sell to them. He never would. Everything he grew was for his family unless he choose to give it away.\n\n……..\n\nOur whole life centred round the kitchen in the wintertime. There was always a roaring fire in the hearth, kept stoked up with wood from the fire bucket and the occasional nugget of coal. Sometimes a blast from the bellows machine was called for. This contraption consisted of a pulley wheel and handle, which, when turned, operated an underground fan that blew wind along a tunnel to the grate.\n\nIn the evenings, when the Paraffin lamp was lit, a soft, hazy glow permeated the kitchen. The corners remained unlit, and the objects in the room caused flickering shadows against the walls. Quite a lot of the light shone directly on to the ceiling, and it was here that the daddy - longlegs and moths changed into monsters, magnified by their own shadows as they scuttles across it. Sometimes father would add a wildlife menagerie - rabbits, geese, giraffes - as he knitted his hands together and manipulated his fingers.\n\nOver the kitchen door hung a silver horseshoe, grown fat over the years by the regular addition of silver paper to it. But pride of place went the wireless, a big dark mahogany box that sat on top of the kitchen cabinet. As big as a present-day TV, it was powered by a combination of a wet battery and a dry battery. The dry battery lasted three months, but the wet one had to be recharged every two weeks. For this purpose we kept a spare one, and Jimmy Carey, who called three times a week in his bread-van, changed it for us at Battyes shop in Kilmac when needed.\n\nListening to the wireless was more than a pastime; it was a ritual. One at which we youngsters had no say. Mother listened to The Kennedys Of Castleross - and a few other sponsored programmes at lunchtime, but it was then switched off until the Angelus at six in the evening. When those bells rang out the whole country blessed itself and turned to stone for a few brief moments. And no one stopped to wonder why.\n\nIn the evening it was father’s turn; the news programmes and weather forecasts, and certain light entertainment shows like ‘Does The Team Think’, The Maureen Potter Show and The School Around The Corner. There was great excitement the day The School Around The Corner came to Kilmac to transmit. We’d all be famous - well those of us who were to appear on it anyway. Then Noel Dee scandalised the whole community by telling Paddy Crosby he wanted to make jackets for gooseberries when he grew up. After that we had to make do with the news. Radio was, apparently, a bad influence on young people.\n\nOn Sundays the hurling and football matches were broadcast, and the sound of Michael O’Hehir’s voice filled our kitchen. Mick O’Connell soaring like an eagle and seconds later the ball is over the bar…Christy Ring running the length of the field and the ball is in the back of the net…John Doyle, Ollie Walsh and Nicky Rackard are breaking heads as well as hurleys…the Black And Amber and Tipp are winning all the All-Irelands, when are we going to win one?\n\nThen came 1959 and the bonfires were burning for a week in Newtown and Ballydurn. Phil Grimes, Martin Og Morissey, Tom Cheasty, our own Joe Harney, they had beaten the Kilkenny Cats at last. My father was dancing around the kitchen and shouting so loud that Michael O’Hehir was, for once, drowned out.\n\nThe kitchen mantelpiece contained all the photos of the family collected over the years. Silver-framed ones of us as small children, one of father and mother on their wedding day marked Tramore 1945. They looked a handsome couple as they posed on the near-empty seafront, him in his long tweed overcoat, his hat tilted at a carefree angle, his gap-toothed face beaming, her in her two-piece suit holding her bonnet steady in the breeze.\n\nThere was also a picture of my grand-uncle in military uniform. He had been in the British Amy and had lost a leg at the Somme. The war to end all wars, he called it. It made him pretty bitter because I had heard him tell my father that if a German shell hadn’t blown his leg off then a British bullet would have blown his head off. ‘They forced us out of the trenches at gunpoint’, he said. ‘Like sheep to the slaughterhouse. Thousands of tons of human fertiliser, that’s what keeps France’s fields so green’.\n\nHe died when I was quite young, but the memory of his visits still linger. There were presents for everyone; bags of bulls-eyes for us, a glass of brandy in a lemonade bottle for mother, and several large bottles of stout for father and himself. At various stages during the visit he pulled a plug of tobacco from his pocket and hacked a lump off it with a penknife. This he stuck in his mouth and chewed vigorously. Every now and then a big glob of brown sludge was spat out. Sometimes it would hit the back of the hob or land on an ember, hissing like a snake for several minutes, smelling like a dead dog after a week in the sun.\n\nIt was his leg, however, that fascinated me most. Quite often he would take it off and rest it against the wall beside him. It was shiny-smooth and hollow and felt cold to the touch. ‘Tin, boy’, he said to me once. ‘One of these days I’ll melt it down and have a good ould time on the proceeds’. After he had left I would tug at my limbs and wonder why they didn’t come away like his did. When he died I asked father what happened to the leg. Was it buried with him? And if it wasn’t, could I have it? All I got for my troubles was a clout on the ear.\n\nAlmost everywhere he went his melodeon went with him. He carried it in a knapsack, slung over one shoulder. It had even survived the war, despite having a lump of shrapnel embedded in its frame next to the buttons. He never removed the shrapnel, calling it his lucky emblem from the Kaiser, and proudly showed how the melodeon had been on his shoulder at the time.\n\nWhen he was in form he would have the kitchen cleared of furniture, and invite whoever was around to dance. ‘Dance till you drop’, he would urge’, ‘and if you can’t dance then give us an ould song’. When all else failed, he sang himself, usually a lament such as Boulavogue, Noreen Bawn, or his favourite, Danny Boy.\n\nOh Danny Boy the pipes the pipes are calling\n\nFrom glen to glen and down the mountainside\n\nThe summer’s gone and all the leaves are falling\n\nTis you must go and I must die….\n\nThe Londonderry Air, he called it.\n\nI sometimes wondered when he marched off to war in the spring of 1915 did he know what he was fighting for? Or did he care? Was it purely on economic grounds – at least the British Army would feed him and keep him and put a few shillings in his pocket at the end of each week – or did he have an overwhelming desire to kill Germans? But perhaps it never even entered his head that he might end up in the green fields of France, a part of the greatest military slaughtering exercise that ever took place?\n\nHe certainly never thought he would lose a leg in it, or that his friend, Jack Neil, would lose his life there. I still don’t know where he enlisted or with what regiment, but I imagine the place was either Waterford city or Clonmel and the regiment either the Royal Munster Fusiliers or the Royal Irish Regiment. I wonder if it was a spur of the moment decision? Did one of them say to the other – ‘come on, let’s join up, there’s nothing to do around this place?’ Was that how it was?\n\nI still remember the story he told about the ‘Big Push’ of 1917 – November I believe it was – when one of his comrades took out a German machine-gun nest with a grenade using the road bowling technique he had perfected bowling the roads in his native Cork. He said he had saved many of them from being slaughtered that day, and that he had subsequently been awarded the Military Cross.\n\nI wonder now if he knew John Condon from Waterford, who is widely acknowledged as the youngest soldier ever to enlist in the British Army? He must have stood out because he was only 12 years of age when he enlisted, and still only 14 years old when he died during a gas attack in 1915. His burial plot in France is now a shrine, and one of the most visited of all the graves. A shrine to what, I wonder? Perhaps the folly of youth?\n\nI also wonder what he thought about the Easter Rising of 1916. And when did he find out about it? I expect he was in one of his ‘fox-holes’ when it all kicked off. Would he have taken up arms against the British had he been around? I think it’s ironic that he was killing Germans for the English at the time that they were pounding the bejaysus out of a few hundred republicans behind the barricades at the GPO and at Bolands Mills in Dublin. And probably with guns similar to the ones he was manning.\n\nEighteen thousand men and a gunboat up the Liffey to put down what some have since described as a ‘minor disturbance of the peace’? I wonder how did he feel when they lined up Pearce, Connolly and the rest of them against the walls of Kilmainham goal and shot them in cold blood?\n\nAnd then a few years later, when the civil war started, he must have been asked to take sides again. Who was he for? Collins or De Valera? He must have been in demand, even minus one leg, because he knew about shooting and killing – which is more than many of the others, did. Was he a trained killer? Did the British Army show him how to kill his fellow human beings without mercy, and without any feeling of emotion?\n\nStill, I feel sure he must have felt some emotion when his own countrymen ambushed Michaels Collins at Beal Na Blath\n\n‘Twas on an August morning, all in the morning hours\n\nI went to take the morning air all in the month of flowers\n\nAnd there I saw a maiden and heard her mournful cry\n\nOh what will mend my broken heart? I’ve lost my Laughing Boy\n\nThat’s a sad song about Michael Collins - and I had heard him sing it many a time.\n\nMaybe it is true what they say about us; that all our wars are merry and all our songs sad.\n\nSometime before he died, he started to forget things. He forgot how to shave, he forgot how to play the accordion, he forgot how to write, even how to talk. If he went out he forgot to come back. Then he forgot himself. He didn’t recognise the picture of himself in military uniform. For a long time he kept talking of this man who was following him around, but he could never show him to anybody. Then one day he caught sight of himself in a wardrobe mirror and shouted, ‘there he is, there’s the man!’\n\n....................\n\nOn either side of the mantelpiece father had built two tall cupboards, all stuffed with clothes and linen. Two birdcages sat on top of these cupboards, occupied at various times by the linnets and finches captured by my brother John. He caught them by smearing bird-lime and dak on the branches of bushes and trees. They seldom sang or looked happy. They showered the kitchen with birdseed, often causing my father to threaten to set them free. Strangely though, he never did.\n\nReading newspapers was his main hobby. Every paper got read from front cover to back and could take several days to complete. This was probably deliberate; we only got the paper three days a week, when the bread-man called. The rest of the world could have been blown to kingdom come on the other days and we wouldn’t have known about it. Sunday was an exception, with The Sunday Press, The Sunday Independent and The People arriving home with him after Mass. Once dinner was over he rarely moved from his chair by the fire. If he wasn’t reading he was dozing or sucking on his chalk pipe.\n\nHe had a box-full of chalk pipes, mostly broken ones. He utilised them by finding two bits that made a whole, then stuck them together using blood pricked from his finger with a darning needle. Before the pipes he had smoked Woodbines, cycling into Waterford once a week to collect them during the time when rationing made them scarce. I got the impression they were bought on the black market.\n\nThursday night was his shaving night. The wash-stand was set out like an operating table; shaving brush, soap, razor and new Mac’s Smile blade, basin of hot water, and jug of cold water. We watched through the billowing steam as he lathered up his face. When he was finished all that could be seen were two eyeballs peering out at us. Usually he managed to get some soap in his eyes, and then he danced around the room shouting, ‘the towel, where’s the feckin’ towel’.\n\nHe didn’t believe in barbers and was in the habit of trimming our hair - the boys that is - with a pair of scissors almost worn away from sharpening. Then he saw an advertisement in the Sunday Press and bought a clipping machine by post from Clerys in Dublin.\n\nHis aversions to barbers meant that somebody had to cut his hair. When I was big enough, it became my job. He had several big lumps on his head, benign growths the size of gooseberries, and I had visions of slicing them off with the new machine. Fortunately, I never removed anything except his hair. The clipping done, the machine was cleaned and oiled, then put back in its box and stored away on the ledge above the mantelpiece.\n\nWednesday was mother’s washing day. The big steel bath was placed on a chair in the front yard, where carbolic soap and Persil were put to good use. When she had large items such as blankets to wash we were roped in to help with the wringing-out. Two tall poles stood in the acre where the washing was line was hung. Given the usual strong breeze, the clothes dried in a few hours. If the weather was bad it was hung in an outhouse, then dried by the fire as it was needed.\n\nThe same bath was used to scrub us down on Saturday night. We were expected to appear without a blemish for Mass on Sunday and mother inspected every orifice to ensure it. Ears were the worst offenders; she used a rough piece of cloth to scrape away at their insides. Knees weren’t far behind; sometimes the scrubbing brush was used to restore them to their natural colour. Afterwards she made us polish our shoes, making sure we selected the correct colour from the pile of tins stacked on the shelf in the porch. When the polish was dry she spat on them, and shined them until you could see your reflection in the toecaps.\n\nOur Sunday shoes were expected to last the whole year. If repairs were needed father carried them out himself. Off-cuts of leather were easily obtained in the Tannery, and these he cut and shaped into the required size. I watched him tip-tap his hammer on the last to get the rhythm then feed the tacks held between his teeth to the hammerhead, before driving them home with one clean hit.\n\nIf we weren’t quite self-sufficient then we were as near to it as father could get us. Everything we could grow we did. We killed a pig or a sheep occasionally, salting the meat and storing it in barrels. For heating we used firewood gleaned from the surrounding land; our drinking water was drawn from our well; our domestic water needs were served by the two rainwater butts situated under the eaves at the back of the house.\n\nFather could quite easily dispensed with money altogether. He would have been content using a bartering system. A system that still existed, to some extent, in the countryside. For example, when he needed the hay in the acre cutting, a machine from Kelly’s farm would be dispatched to cut it. He then returned the favour by spending a day in the fields when their hay was being saved.\n\nChapter three\n\nI remember the time mother got fat. I was about ten and I recall the turmoil this caused in my young mind. For years she had been the same comfortable shape, here she was getting bigger and uglier by the week. Then she got sick and took to her bed. Her sister Kathleen came calling to help out with the household chores and keep an eye on us kids. I liked Kathleen; she was as skinny as mother was fat, and she possessed this sharp, acerbic wit that was absent in mother. She lived next door to their mother, Grandma Butler, in Grenan, a few miles away, with her husband Tom and my six cousins, Peggy, Nellie, Minnie, Anice, Brigid and Michael.\n\nOn this occasion Grandma Butler came calling. Her visits were few and far between so it must have been serious. She arrived in her ass and trap, sitting in splendid isolation on a bag of straw in the driver’s seat, a rug across her knees. She had her shawl wrapped loosely about her, a black scarf tied tightly under her chin. Queen Victoria couldn’t have looked any grander.\n\nKathleen was already in attendance, and for the next hour they closeted themselves in mother’s room, the only sounds to be heard the ticking of our mantle-clock and the animated voices behind the closed bedroom door. Father was working so we skulked unhindered in the kitchen, ears to the door attempting to hear what was being said.\n\nNot that we paid too much attention to the conversation; often just watching the faces was enough. When the insurance man called for instance, the sight of his big red nose was enough to send us into raptures. Mother usually banished us to the scullery when he appeared, shushing us to keep quiet. Unable to see him and titter at his appearance, we had to suffer in silence in the dark while he drank a cup of tea and chatted with mother.\n\nDisaster struck the afternoon our ear-to-the-door manoeuvres became scuffles. The door shot open suddenly, depositing all three of us in a heap at their feet. Mother, who had been in the act of sugaring his tea, became flustered and asked him how many sugars he would you like on his nose. After that we were banished to the outhouses whenever he came within sight.\n\nGrandma and Aunt Kathleen eventually emerged from the bedroom and sat in the kitchen drinking tea, tut-tuting and shaking their heads at whatever it was that displeased them. Later on the doctor came, and a few days later mother wasn’t fat anymore.\n\nIf father had his vegetable then she had her hens and turkeys. She kept egg-laying pullets - Rhode Island Reds mostly - who tended to lay anywhere except the hen-house. We spent a lot of time following them to see where they were laying, sometimes sticking our fingers up their bums to see if they had already performed the task.\n\nShe also reared turkeys for the Christmas market, buying in young chicks, and fattening them up to be sold. We were all in a state of great excitement when the turkey man arrived in his van to buy them. They were sold by weight, and for this purpose he carried with him a set of beautiful brass scales. They were golden in colour and had a face like a barometer, with a hook at the top and the bottom.\n\nHe hung it on a bracket at the back of the van then pulled the bottom hook to demonstrate that it worked. Mother inspected it too, tugging at it as if she didn’t entirely believe what she was seeing. The legs of the turkeys were tied together, and they were hung upside down on it and weighed individually. She always kept a few turkeys back, one for ourselves and one each for Aunt Kathleen and her mother.\n\nSome years she hatched her own. There were always a couple of permanent turkeys about the place and they were taken to Mrs Hubbard, who lived in nearby Georgestown, and who owned a turkey-cock. She transported them in shopping bags, one either side of the handlebars of her bicycle, their red heads poking and pecking as she pedalled the few miles to their destination.\n\nSometimes I was given the job. At Mrs Hubbard’s I couldn’t fathom what it was all about; all the cock did was clamber onto the hens backs, scratch about for a while, them clamber down again. The eggs thus fertilised did produce chicks, those that survived the attentions of the rats and other foragers, but mother nearly always wound up buying in more to make up the numbers.\n\nShe had never worked after she married, so the only money she ever saw came from father’s wages packet - and that was easily taken care of by the needs of the family. For her pin-money she depended on her turkeys, her hens, her eggs, her knitting and, in the summer, her blackberry-picking.\n\nFor a few short weeks each summer we picked blackberries at every opportunity. Our hands turned purple, our faces turned purple, as, no doubt, did our insides. We ate them until they made us sick, filling our mouths along with the gallons and buckets we collected them in. Sometimes we made special trips with jam-jars and mugs, picking the juiciest ones, taking them home and mashing them on a plate, then sprinkling sugar on them before eating them. The berries we collected were used in some dye-making process, and we filled barrels with them. On the day the blackberry man called, mother increased the weight in the barrels by adding water to them. She got paid so much a stone, and our reward was bags of sweets and lucky-bags when she next did her shopping.\n\nSaturday was her shopping day. This was done in Kilmac and I sometimes accompanied her, pedalling one of father’s ‘high-nellies’ alongside her - under the cross-bar until I grew tall enough to reach the saddle.\n\nShopping with her was an unhurried affair and could take the best part of the day. There were always half a dozen ports of call, the first one usually Flynn’s, the butchers. Nicky Flynn was as big and red-faced as the bullocks he slaughtered; dispensing banter in equal measure with the lumps of mutton and beef he slapped and hacked about on the huge slab of wood behind the counter.\n\nThe shop was always full of gossiping women who never seemed in a hurry to buy anything. Mother was no exception. Nicky would heft a lump of meat in his huge hand, holding it aloft for inspection; ‘there you are Mrs O’Brien, a lovely bit of boiling beef’. She would shake her head and discard it as too fatty or too bony or too something-or-other. More chunks would be examined and discarded until the conversation was exhausted and something had to be bought..\n\nShe then visited several grocery shops, spreading her custom around, knowing that at Christmas time she would rewarded with a ‘Christmas box’ from each. Afterwards she visited the haberdashers and purchased the hanks of wool that she made the fair-isle and Aran sweaters from throughout the winter. (A job I always hated was holding those hanks between my outstretched hands as she re-wound them into balls for knitting) Lastly, she called at Lennon’s Drapery Store, where she paid off her bills at so much a week. All our clothes and shoes were bought at Lennons.\n\nSaturday was the day most of the country folk did their shopping, and she met many of her friends that day. One of them was Kathy Whelan, a sad-eyed woman married to Jack Morrissey, a distant relative of hers. Their house, across the road from the post-office, was a palace compared to ours. It had carpets in every room and furniture that smelled of leather and polish. And Nicholas, who was about my age, let me wear his glasses for the loan of one of my comics. I was prepared to swap existence with him any day - even if he had no father at home.\n\nThis was something which puzzled me greatly; Jack Morrissey was now living in Manchester with one of the O’Halloran’s - and no one was saying why. When I asked mother, all she said was; ‘that rip, ‘tis walking the road with the tinkers she should be’. Kathy sometimes received letters from Jack but she burnt them all without opening them. I wondered if they had money in them; several people in our boreen had relatives in England and they often received letters with five pounds inside. I once asked Nicholas but he must have told because mother got to hear about it. She walloped me about the house when we got home, telling me never to mention such a thing again.\n\nShopping done, mother would retire to the snug of Kent’s bar for a glass of port or stout. Maureen Kent, who hovered between the bar and grocery section, personified efficiency. Lean and elegant, her no-nonsense dark suits suited her admirably, while her hair always looked freshly permed. She chatted endlessly as she sliced thin slices of ham on the hand-operated slicing machine, filled cardboard boxes with packets of tea and other household goods, or uncapped bottles of stout and set them firmly on the counter, the froth oozing gently down their long necks. She was helped out occasionally by her brothers, Michael and John, who also assisted in the family’s other occupation of undertakers.\n\nAs I got older I was occasionally sent to do the shopping - mother writing down the message-list on a sheet of paper for me. Before too long I found this was an opportunity for me to make some money for myself. Where she had written down ‘seven shillings worth of boiling beef’, I asked for six shillings worth, thus making myself a whole shilling. I stuffed myself with chocolates and sweets, thinking of how easy it had been. When I got home she somehow knew I had short-changed her and beat me around the kitchen ‘till I was black and blue.\n\n……….\n\nSeveral times a year the council workmen swarmed the boreen, filling up potholes, opening drains and clearing the ditches. The fact that the pothole filler was gravel and got washed away in first heavy rain was neither here nor there; for a little while the boreen was all dressed up in its Sunday best. Looking like it had a shit, shave and a shampoo, as Tommy Galvin was fond of saying\n\nAt break times, a fire was lit by the roadside and the billycans came out, As many as half a dozen jostling for space over the open flame. All balanced precariously on a stick held by the kneeling or squatting workmen. When the water was boiled the little twists of tea and sugar came out and were tipped into the cans, which were then stood by the edge of the fire to draw.\n\nAll this activity was a Godsend to us youngsters; bored to death by our own company, we swooped on the workmen like vultures. The flashing billhooks or the long-tailed shovels held little interest for us; it was their bicycles that we were after. And some were content to let us ride them.\n\nMost of them had nicknames; Paddy Fat Meat, The Buachall, Grain- A-Meal, Johnny Pigs Eye. I studied the last-named closely to see what resemblance he bore to the pig’s head that we occasionally ate for dinner. This half-head sat on a big plate in the middle of the table. It had only one ear, half a nose, and one eye. And I could hear words running through my head as I stared at it and it stared back at me.\n\nJohnny pigs head, Johnny pigs head\n\nOne half live, the other half dead\n\nJohnny pigs ear, Johnny pigs eye\n\nJohnny we’re hungry, Johnny goodbye.\n\nThen mother would carve it up and we would fight like cats and dogs over the ear and the tongue, and the stringy bits behind the eyeball.\n\nSometimes there was whitewashing to be done, a task that that had us as white as the walls and piers when we were finished. A mixture of lime and water, It burnt the hands and scalded the eyes if you were unfortunate enough to get spattered. Included in the itinerary was the henhouse, the smelliest building we owned. The hens spent a lot of their time roosting in there, spattering everything with shit. It was slippery inside, covered in feathers, and sometimes wayward hens would come fluttering and squawking from a dark corner, with the result it never got much more than a ‘scots lick and a promise’. We finished off by painting the several large stones scattered about in front of the house. Mother often sat on these in the summer time, humming the song ‘The Stone Outside Dan Murphy’s Door’\n\nIn the winter the Hunt sometimes came by, the huntsman with his horn appearing first, the other riders following on in their bright red jackets. Then came the hounds, sweeping through the undergrowth in relentless fashion, their excitement high when a fox was scented.\n\nThere were always followers, the occasional car, but most came on foot, beating the bushes and ditches with their knobbly sticks, as if, they too, were following the scent. We followed the followers, never straying too far from home, mesmerised by the lepping horses. Nothing stopped their progress; neither brook or fence, not barbed-wire or steel gate. Over they went, tails flashing, nostrils blowing clouds of steam across the bleak, wintry landscape. Occasionally a dog got lost and you could hear the huntsman calling him home with his horn, often late into the night. What happened to the ones never found, I wondered? Did they roam the countryside in packs, hunting the foxes all by themselves?\n\nFather didn’t like too many animals around the house and when the cat and dog population increased a way had to be found of reducing their numbers. If homes couldn’t be found for the kittens and pups then he drowned them in the nearby river. They were put in sacks and taken there, probably a cruel way to depart the world, but if we were squeamish about the operation we kept it to ourselves, and didn’t protest too much. It was the way of the world; we had seen it before, we would see it again. He usually took a shovel with him, so at least they got a decent burial somewhere afterwards.\n\nI took to going out at night watching the night sky. It was easy to distinguish the lights of the various towns and villages on the horizon, but an intermittent blue flash coming from the direction of Kilmac had me puzzled for some time. Eventually, my father told me it was Nawnie, the blacksmith, welding in his forge. How come Bat Mansfield didn’t have blue flashes coming from his forge, I wondered. Maybe it was something to do with Nawnie advertising for a wife in some magazine in America. He had got the wife, and maybe she had brought the blue flashes with her. The Yank Power, who worked in the Tannery, and who had spent some time in New York, had brought a wife back too and she had some funny habits. We had tea at their house once and she had called us all ‘honey’ and given us fried tomatoes on our bread. Who had ever heard of fried tomatoes?\n\nThe Master had aroused my curiosity about the stars with his tales of Copernicus, Galileo and Isaac Newton. How far was the moon from earth? I had forgotten, but it wasn’t far. The sun was ninety three million miles away, now that was far, and the nearest star was zillions and zillions of miles away. Light years, in fact. How heavy was a light year? Lighter than an ordinary year, I concluded.\n\nAfter a while I could pick out the Dog and the Plough, and on a really clear night The Milky Way. The more I thought about it the more I came to the conclusion that if I got on a space-ship I could keep travelling out into space, forever and ever, without ever getting to the end. Was that was what was meant in the catechism when we said ‘world without end amen’?\n\nI became mesmerised by the vastness of space, and sometimes felt myself about to be swallowed up by the blackness out there. It was conceivable I might vanish, never to be seen again, a thousand questions on the tip of my tongue. Why is the world, God? Why are the stars? Why am I? In the beginning you created the Universe, so what did you do before that?\n\nChapter four\n\nI suppose I was quite intelligent at school. Lessons came fairly easy to me, particularly sums and English composition. But it was my grasp of Irish that pleased the Master most. He liked to converse in our native tongue whenever possible and was pleased when one of his pupils had a feel for it. Occasionally he got carried away; even attempting to teach us English in Irish.\n\nHe had only one eye - well, he had two but one of them was glass. This he liked to remove, polish on his sleeve then hold out at arm’s length. As if to see us better. I’ve got eyes in the back of my head, was one of his favourite sayings. He also reckoned he could hear the grass growing, a phenomenon we were prepared to accept, because he heard even the slightest whisper. He could turn unerringly to the source no matter where it came from.\n\nHe had his favourites; Master’s pets we called them, and I suppose I was marginally included in this group. Most tended to come from the brighter elements, or the wealthier ones, but they always included a few of the biggest and prettiest girls regardless of their intellectual qualities. These he would have sit close to him as he corrected their work, patting their heads and shoulders when something pleased him. Others currently in favour were given tasks considered perks; cleaning the blackboard, topping up inkwells, giving out books and, in winter, keeping the fire stoked up. Sometimes coal was in short supply, and some of us were sent out to collect firewood from the nearby fields.\n\nI found a regular supply in one of the outhouses behind Nugent’s pub when I fell through its door one morning. Out of bounds to us, my search for wood had nevertheless landed me almost on top of it. Balancing on top of a ditch to try and dislodge some rotten bits from between the branches of a tree, I spied several chunky pieces resting on the roof of the porch. However, when I reached out, I overbalanced. My momentum sent me skittering down the bank, through the porch, and crashing into the door beyond. The door lurched open and I was sent sprawling into the past.\n\nFor a moment I thought I had somehow gone back in time. Here was a world of thirty or forty years ago, all cocooned in cobwebs and dustcovers. At first I was petrified; the lumpy, shrouded things in the armchairs and on the tables might easily be mummies or monsters waiting for someone like me to stumble into their lair. I waited for something to happen, a leg or hand to appear from behind the veils, but nothing did.\n\nEverywhere I looked was piled with books and magazines, all stacked higher than me. I pulled a newspaper to me and read the date; 1922. One on another pile said THE WAR IS OVER in huge letters that covered almost the entire page. The date was 1918.\n\nI found a stack of photographs in one of the armchairs, mostly mildewed, with the glass cracked or broken. The sepia prints showed severe-looking men and women framed in oval; the women with their hair in buns mostly, the men smoking short-stemmed pipes or leaning on forks. Some of them looked to be of Paddy Nugent, but I knew that couldn’t be. They were too old-fashioned and his clothes were all wrong.\n\nAnother pile was records. I looked at the labels; The Charleston, Count John McCormick, Arthur Tracy. Others were unpronounceable. I had seen records before. Grandma Butler had a gramophone which she sometimes played for us, but God help us if we touched it. His master’s voice, she said, pointing to the dog painted on its side, be like him and sit and listen - and keep your paws to yourselves. I felt the texture of the records now, rubbing them against my cheek. Smooth and cool to the touch. I shoved the John McCormick under my gansy. Surely one wouldn’t be missed?\n\nThen I saw the books; Shakespeare, Dickens, Trollope and someone called James Boswell. There were dozens of them and I had never heard of any of them. I vowed to ask the Master, he was bound to know. Though he only ever talked of Padraig Pearse and Sean O’ Casey.\n\nThese books had a feel and a smell to them. Of what I didn’t know, but it felt right that I should be here. I raised one to my nose and smelled it. Maybe I could come back again. Nobody ever came here, so nobody need know. I picked up another book and looked at the title. THE STORY OF THE IRISH RACE. That was more like it. Some of the names leapt out at me; The Tuatha De Danann, Cuchullian, Conor MacNessa, Fionn Macool, Red Hugh, Cromwell, Robert Emmet, Daniel O’Connell and many others. I was definitely coming back again. And when I looked in the fireplace I knew I had a reason. Stacked in the hob was a large pile of wood that hadn’t been disturbed in years.\n\nThe woodpile outlasted me. I had hardly made any inroads before I was discovered and marched back to the classroom in disgrace. I had by then, however, removed a number of items and hidden them away in Neddy’s shed.\n\nThe full nature of the Master’s sadistic nature was now revealed to me. He kept an assortment of canes in the book cupboard behind his desk and I was the one ordered to fetch them to him. When I had complied he stood for a long time flexing and testing a number of them, all the time lecturing the class on the consequences of stealing. When he finally turned to me he ordered me to hold out my hand then held it firmly by the wrist as he slashed down on it. He repeated the dose on the other hand. My humiliation was complete when he made me stand in front of the whole class for the rest of the day. I felt like one of the thieves crucified on the Cross beside Jesus as I stood there, hands under my oxters, pain coursing through my raw limbs. My only consolation was the books still safely hidden.\n\nDespite my bleeding hands mother and father refused to condemn him. I had got what I deserved as far as they were concerned. And maybe they were right. Other parents weren’t as understanding though and there were often rows and arguments over his excesses. Once, Father Sinnott marched into the classroom and removed all the canes. Later, after a heated argument in the corridor, we heard him breaking them all up. The following week a new bundle of canes appeared.\n\nThen came the day of the big fight. It was like something out of our Batman comics as the Master reeled around the classroom while five masked avengers laid into him. It was lunch-break, and a couple of us who had been mooching in the cloakroom were given a grandstand view. The intruders swept into the hallway, their faces concealed by handkerchiefs, bolting the outer door behind them. Then it was into the classroom where the Master was having his lunch, barring that door also. By now I had realised something was afoot and I crept forward to see better what it was. Luckily, the frosted half-panel of glass had a little piece missing in one corner, just big enough to accommodate my eye.\n\nThe Master was getting murdered! Slapped around from pillar to post, kicked and punched this way and that. The flapping handkerchiefs weren’t hiding the faces too effectively and I was sure I recognised a couple of them. Wasn’t that Peter Kenny putting the boot in? And Paddy Galvin giving him a taste of his own medicine with the cane. Then Mrs Coffey appeared from her classroom, her face like thunder, rattling the locked door and shouting; ‘what’s going on in there you boys?’\n\nWhen the Master finally appeared he was bedraggled and bleeding, and the classroom was a mess. Of the intruders there was no sign, but there was an open window. I was queried and questioned but I shook my head. No, I had seen nothing, nor had I recognised anybody. A Garda came out to inspect the damage and to investigate further but nothing ever came of it.\n\nWe were given a couple of days off, and for a few weeks the Master was a changed man. But, as John Mullins used to say, you can’t teach an old Master new tricks, and within a short time he was back to his old ways. He beat the education into us, it could be said.\n\nChapter Five\n\nIt was the school’s responsibility to supply altar boys to serve Mass at Newtown church. Newtown was the seat of the parish and Father Sinnott lived in a big house across the road from the chapel. It had a large driveway with apple trees lining both sides of it; trees heavy each autumn with apples much bigger and sweeter than those to be found in Cullinan’s orchard. The difficulty was getting at them, for they were in full view of the house. And the housekeeper had eyes like a hawk. In fact she looked a bit like a hawk, with her hooked nose and straight black hair cut evenly across her shoulders. Becoming an altar boy gave me a reason to be in the grounds of the house; there were always items to be collected and delivered, and I made sure I always collected my fair share of apples on these visits.\n\nThe Master had the responsibility for the selection and training of altar boys. Training included regular visits to the chapel to rehearse the duties we had to perform during the Mass. These were many and varied; bell-ringing, assisting at the Offertory and Communion, taking charge of the collection boxes after they had been passed round. There were also the responses to the priest’s oration. The Mass was in Latin and we had to grapple with this difficult language until the Master was satisfied. Curiously, though we learned our responses off to perfection, we never bothered with the English translation.\n\nBeing an altar boy carried with it a certain status. It conferred an air of respectability on the family, and I could see mother purring with pride as she laid out my surplice on Saturday nights. God’s little helper, she called me. It made the family more saintly in her eyes. There were now plenty of reasons to get us all on our knees in the kitchen, saying a decade of the Rosary before the now-prominent picture of Mary which previously hung in obscurity in the back room. For me the rewards were more tangible; participating at the occasional wedding or funeral where, at some stage in the proceedings, a couple of half-crowns or a ten-shilling note would be pressed into my palm.\n\nI quickly made up my mind that I wanted to become a priest. There was something heroic about their deeds in darkest Africa and other heathen places. Converting the pagans and saving all the Black babies, now there was something worth doing. A missionary,that was what I would become.\n\nOf course priests had it much easier here in Ireland - and it seemed such a pleasant way of life. Visiting schools and asking questions about the Catechism during the week, saying the Mass on Sunday. Then there were all those collections at Easter and Christmas which yielded up hundreds of pounds. Plus, of course, the car. Father Sinnott was one of few in the neighbourhood to own one, a sure sign of wealth in my estimation. Paddy Nugent was another. Although Martin Galvin had recently acquired one - and they didn’t have two sods of turf to put on the fire as far as anyone could see. It was a hackney-car according to father, a phrase which went over my head at the time.\n\nThe proceeds of the church collections were read out at Mass a few weeks later. They read like rolls of honour and were hierarchical in the extreme, those at the top of the list being the wealthiest farmers, those at the bottom labourers. David Kiersey, Ballyshunnock, five pounds…James Kelly, Ballyshunnock, two pounds…Patrick O’Brien, Ballyhussa, five shillings…\n\nThose who paid nothing were never read out, but everyone knew who they were just the same. We were always near the bottom of the list, something which annoyed me because it showed everyone how poor we were. I never understood what the collections were for. The ones at school for black babies yes, they were starving and had no clothes and I could identify with that. But there were no hungry or naked priests as far as I could see. And when I asked my father he merely grunted that it was ‘to keep their lordships arses in comfort for the next year’.\n\nOne of the books I had hidden away was the Bible and I now took to reading it, hoping it might help with my entry into the priesthood. It was confusing though, a lot of the words didn’t make sense, so I decided to approach John Mullins about it one afternoon. If anyone would know he would, if he wasn’t digging a grave he was stretched out against a tombstone reading something.\n\nJohn was in the graveyard, clearing away bushes and weeds from an old section. ‘There’s too many people dyin’, boy. We’ll soon be buryin’ them standing up’.\n\n‘Begat?’ his eyebrows arched as I asked my question.\n\n‘Aye. There’s lots of begats. I just wondered…’\n\nHe began to laugh. ‘Oh yes, you’re right. Begor and there’s lots of begating in the Bible. Sometimes I think it’s all they feckin’ did’. He paused to get his pipe going again, taking several heavy sucks on it before speaking. ‘What do yerself think it means?’\n\n‘Fighting’.\n\n‘Begor now, that’s a good way of putting it. I couldn’t put it better meself’. He then went on to explain and I went away satisfied. My father begat me…Tommy Galvin begat Dick…Jack Power begat Tomjoe…\n\nThen I came across another phrase. ‘And Sarai Abram went into Hagar’…now what did that mean?\n\n…\n\nReligion was taken seriously in those days. Every season brought is own festivities and duties. March, for example, usually signified the beginning of Lent and weeks of fasting and devotion. Each of us owned our own prayer books and rosary beads, mother’s missal was stuffed to bursting with relics and Holy pictures. Blessed Martin himself had never been kissed as many times as had that faded picture of him she carried around with her. She had great faith in his powers as a healer. Whenever one of us was sick she kissed his picture and placed it on the afflicted part of our body. Holy water, Lourdes water, water from the healing well in Mothel lurked in every corner of the house and was dished out like tonic. As soon as sickness appeared she reached for one of her bottles and administered three sips to us. Never mind that it tasted like bog water, it still had to be swallowed.\n\nThe coming of Lent heralded a change of attitude in the lives of almost everyone in the community. From the priests whose sermons became more vociferous to the women who beat a path to the altar daily now, their eyes downcast, their heads shrouded in black veils.\n\nWe children denied ourselves too, no sweets or chocolates, no sugar in our tea. When the Master asked Tomjoe Power what he had given up he said smoking, and got walloped for his cheek. It was true though; a lot of the bigger boys could be found in sheltered spots during the breaks dragging on butts they had somehow got hold of.\n\nThis was also the time when the evangelists appeared; the Redemptorists, the Franciscans, and the Jesuits. And all breathing fire and brimstone at the retreats now held up and down the country. Billy Graham was in Ireland too, filling Croke Park fuller than the Waterford hurling team ever did. Several local women went. Farmers’ wives, who walked around for weeks afterwards as if they had corks up their arses. ‘You’d think butter wouldn’t melt in their mouths’, remarked John Mullins. ‘And sure maybe it wouldn’t. Frosty is as frosty does’.\n\nWe travelled occasionally to Dungarvan for a retreat, usually by train, or hiring Martin Galvin’s hackney car if one wasn’t available. Apart from the chest-beating and the wailing as some Jesuit or Redemptorist tore moral strips off the multitude the memory that lingers most is of that slow old steam train chugging out from Carroll’s Cross, colouring the air with thick billowing smoke, and filled to the brim with pilgrims, the driver blowing his horn at every level crossing, the engine snorting and whooshing as she picked up speed, the wheels pounding out their message\n\nWe’re on our way to heaven\n\nWe’re on our way to heaven\n\nWe’re on our way to heaven\n\nWe shall not be moved.\n\nOne year one of my cousins had to go and be ‘churched’. For some reason that nobody would talk about she had given up going to Mass and the Sacraments and had, to all to extents, been kicked out of the church. Excommunicated - the shame of it. ‘That strap’, my mother vented her anger, ‘she’ll have her mother in an early grave’.\n\nThat her mother was Aunt Kathleen made matters even worse; any slur on her family was a slur on us. You couldn’t have the neighbours talking behind your back. How could you hold your head up knowing that was going on? It was alright to talk about them of course, but not the other way round.\n\nThe errant cousin was coaxed back into the fold by getting her to go along to one of the retreats. ‘A good talking to be one of them Jesuits is what she needs’, I heard grandma say. ‘They’d put the wind up the divil himself’. The upshot was that she had to creep back into the church one Sunday after Mass. I always thought that being ‘churched’ was the result of some serious transgression and for many years I wondered what she had done. It wasn’t until much later that I learned it was a purification ceremony that the church carried out on women who had given birth. This is what I read. ‘The woman who has just had a child must first stand outside the church door and only when she has been solemnly purified by sprinkling with holy water and the prayers of the priest is she led back into the church’. Apparently it goes back to the middle ages when the church decided that women who had given birth were unclean and therefore had to be ‘cleansed’. I had often seen women before, dressed solemnly in black, kneeling in the vestibule at the back of the church after Mass, waiting for the priest to come and attend to them, but it never occurred to me that the church was punishing them for having children.\n\nI had to follow the priest about with the vessel of Holy water, while he placed a lighted candle in M’s hand, and recited the Gloria Patria and the Kyrie as well as the Our Father before sprinkling her with Holy Water and inviting her into the chapel with the words, ‘Enter into the temple of God, that though may have eternal life’. However, he made sure she was veiled before letting her pass, and I have since read that women who refused to cover their heads were often ex-communicated.\n\nThe ceremony ended with a blessing for us all and the priest telling us there was more rejoicing in Heaven when one lost soul returned to the fold than if a thousand righteous ones gained entry. Six months later, when she ran off with a married, man he was humming a different tune.\n\nI never stopped to wonder at the time why there were no Altar girls. I suppose it was to do with the Church’s attitude to women even then, as exemplified in the ‘churching’. Thank God things have changed a bit since my youth.\n\nOn Ash Wednesday the whole school lined up in spindly ranks and marched the hundred yards to the church, where we heard Mass. Afterwards, we formed an orderly queue to the altar. Here the priest made the sign of the cross over our heads and put the imprint of a cross on our foreheads with a thumb dipped in damp ashes. We looked like a nation of aliens when he had finished, those black crosses prominent between our eyes. ‘Ye have the mark of Zorro on ye now’, John Mullins teased, leaning on his shovel as we marched past. It didn’t seem too bad later though when we saw many of the grown-ups displaying the same marks.\n\n‘Power. Where is Thomas Power?’, bellowed the Master after we had returned from one such trip. ‘I did not see him in church. Has nobody seen him?’\n\nNobody had. Tomjoe was lazy and insolent, bullied us smaller boys mercilessly, and mooched off whenever he could get away with it. The trip to the church was ideal; he was probably asleep in the coal shed, his favourite hiding place.\n\n‘Go outside and find him’. Jim Kiersey was despatched to do the necessary. ‘I will not have shirkers in my class’.\n\nJim had barely got outside before Tomjoe came hurrying in, looking as if he had been sleeping in a ditch.\n\n‘Where have you been?’ roared the Master.\n\n‘At the church sir’, stammered Tomjoe. ‘I got shortaken on the way back’.\n\nBy now the whole class was tittering.\n\n‘Silence’, came the roar. He moved quickly to Tomjoe, grabbed him by the ears and dragged him into the centre of the room. ‘What is that…’ He jabbed at Tomjoe’s forehead with his free hand… ‘ there?’\n\n‘Ashes sir. Holy ashes’.\n\n‘Is it now? And what does it say?\n\n‘I don’t know sir. I can’t see’.\n\n‘And who put it there?\n\n‘Father Sinnott, sir’.\n\n‘Did he now? Did he indeed?’ By now he had dragged the helpless Tomjoe to the front of his desk and was searching his drawers. Within moments he had produced a hand mirror and held it to his victim’s face. ‘Now tell me what you see’.\n\nTomjoe could now see what had the rest of us tittering. The letters FUCK written large across his forehead.\n\n‘It’s a swear word sir’.\n\n‘And our parish priest put it there?\n\n‘No sir’.\n\n‘Then who did?\n\n‘I don’t know sir’.\n\n‘Why not, Power?’\n\n‘I was asleep sir’\n\n‘You were asleep! You glangeen, you amadan, do you think this school is run to suit your slothful habits?’ By now the canes were in his free hand. ‘Get down on your knees and say an act of contrition’. And while Tomjoe snivelled his way through the prayer he reddened his hand with a dozen mighty slashes. ‘Now go and see Father Sinnott. And leave that…’ he pointed to the offending word…’there’.\n\nWhen Tomjoe had gone he turned to the rest of us. ‘Now’, he said, ‘I want the boy or boys - it couldn’t be a girl - who wrote that disgusting word to come forward’.\n\nNobody Did. There were a lot of whispered conversations but nobody seemed to know who did it. Or if they did they weren’t saying. Eventually he lost patience. ‘Okay’, he said, ‘nobody leaves this classroom until we find the culprit. We shall stay here all evening if necessary’. Neither did this threat work. Besides, we knew it wasn’t going to happen. His bus left at half-past four and unless he was planning to walk home he would have to be on it. Shortly before that time he conceded defeat. Nobody ever owned up to writing FUCK on Tomjoe’s forehead. Maybe he wrote it himself. Everyone said he was stupid enough. One thing though; he never slept in the coal shed again.\n\nFor forty days there was no escaping the season of penance. Mass every morning; Devotions two evenings a week, the congregation following in the priests footsteps around the church as he stopped at each Station of the Cross and said a decade of the rosary, us altar boys leading the responses. Confession, usually heard on a Saturday night, was extended to several nights. The priests prowled the public houses and the dance halls with a vigour that bordered on the hysterical. Very few dances were held during Lent, and those that took place were usually in defiance of the religious - so much so that you nearly had to go in disguise for fear of repercussions! It was as if the collective sins of the whole community were being gathered in and squeezed out of us in those few weeks\n\nHoly Week saw the religious fervour intensify. It began with the celebration of Palm Sunday, proclaiming Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem on a donkey. To celebrate it a mound of palm leaves lay heaped behind the altar rails. They were blessed during Mass and given out to the congregation afterwards.\n\nAnd so it went on. Right through to Holy Thursday and Good Friday; men and women now openly prostrating themselves before the altar, begging forgiveness.\n\nOn Good Friday time seemed to stand still. Nothing moved; no cars, no people. Nothing opened; no shops, no pubs. The only sound was that of the solitary church bell counting down the death of Christ. We fasted all day, breaking our fast only when midnight had passed.\n\nEaster Sunday was a celebration. Christ was risen; all his pain and suffering was over. And all our starving too. The first thing that mother did was reach for her box of Woodbines, which had been gathering dust on top of the dresser. All our sins had been forgiven us, we were now free to let our hair down again for the coming year.\n\nAfter Mass we gorged ourselves on Easter eggs and got ready for the procession later in the day. Every building in the village had been dolled up for the procession. Streamers and bunting criss-crossing from telegraph-pole to telegraph-pole, Holy pictures in every window along the route. Even the parish pump had been decorated.\n\nAt the appointed time the band struck up and the long snake of people set off. Headed by the priests and altar boys then the school choir and the schoolchildren. We stopped for prayers and benediction at various points, slowly making our way from the priest’s house to Newtown Cross, and then back to the school. Here, an open-air altar had been erected, and more prayers and hymn-singing were conducted, culminating in the whole congregation singing ‘Faith Of Our Fathers.\n\nPart of our duties as altar boys included taking the filled collection boxes into the sacristy nearing the end of Mass and putting the money into a bag for the priest to take away. After I had been doing it for a while I found it easy to palm the odd shilling or two and slip it into my pocket under my surplice. I don’t remember if I ever stopped to consider my actions, or if I felt a pang of guilt as I subsequently devoured packets of Rollo’s and crisps, but I know I didn’t confess the sin at me regular confession. Here was a ready-made sin but I was still dreaming ones up to impress that impassive face on the other side of the confession box.\n\n‘Bless me father for I have sinned. It is two weeks since my last confession. I cursed three times last week…I had bad thoughts about Shiela Kiersey...I pulled Frances’s Power’s hair in class…’\n\n‘These bad thoughts my child, do they involve any…ah… physical activities?’\n\n‘No father’.\n\n‘Good my child. When these impure thought come into your head you must say an act of contrition straight away. And offer the bad thoughts up. Now for your penance say five Our Fathers and Five Hail Marys’.\n\nWhen I asked Tomjoe what the priest meant about ‘physical activities’ he said he meant was I pulling my wire. Then he grabbed hold of me and said I hadn’t any wire worth pulling anyhow.\n\nIn due course Thomas Kirwan and myself discovered the pleasure of a little wine-drinking. We usually served together, and were responsible for filling the jugs with the water and wine to be used during the mass. When Father Sinnott officiated very little water but nearly all the wine would be used. However, with Father Power it was the other way round and we were able to transfer some of the wine to a spare vessel we kept concealed in a recess, topping up the priest’s jug with water. We returned later in the day, retrieved the wine then sat amid the gravestones drinking it. Sometimes it made your head spin, and when you added the occasional illicit Woodbine everything started to revolve. Trees, poles, even the gravestones; whirling around so fast you had to hang on tightly to something for fear of taking off.\n\nI was eventually kicked out of the altar boys, though it wasn’t for stealing. One evening, before Devotions, I hid behind the sacristy door, one of the long-handled collection boxes raised above my head. I had intended to give Thomas Kirwan a fright as he came through the door - only it was Father Sinnott who walked through first. In my terror I crowned him with the box. Needless to say that was the end of me. Luckily for me the Master was off sick at the time. When he eventually returned I had finished my Primary exams, never to return.\n\nChapter Six\n\nThe summer months seemed to go on forever. Long languid days stretching into warm, drowsy nights. In the long evenings after school we rambled the boreen looking for birds’ nests, caught bees in jam-jars and chased butterflies with nets made from scraps of muslin.\n\nThe smaller birds like the robin, thrush, yellowhammer "
