        "text": "THE VIRGINIAN-PILOT Copyright (c) 1995, Landmark Communications, Inc. DATE: Monday, January 30, 1995 TAG: 9501280021 SECTION: DAILY BREAK PAGE: E5 EDITION: FINAL SOURCE: BY MAL VINCENT, MOVIE CRITIC LENGTH: Medium: 59 lines\n\nYOU'LL LAUGH OUT LOUD AT THESE ``CLERKS''\n\nIT'S CHEAP AND it's, technically, out of focus, but you'll laugh out loud at ``Clerks,'' the little film made by a group of kids in a New Jersey convenience store.\n\nIt appeals to the bad boy in all of us - and to a few of the bad girls, too.\n\nBe warned that the language is low-down and loud. (Those of you who think you've heard everything might learn a few new naughty words here - including the meaning of ``snowballing.'')\n\nBrian O'Halloran plays Dante Hicks, a clerk on the late shift at Quick Stop Groceries in smalltown New Jersey. During the night, all kind of kooky folks show up. There's a customer who wants to examine all the eggs in an effort to find the ``perfect dozen.'' There's the violent anti-smoking person who tries to drive off cigarette buyers by throwing the cigs at them, threatening death, and worse.\n\nThere's girlfriend trouble too. Veronica reveals that she's had sex with only a few guys in one way, but with many in other ways. Dante's upset that Caitlin, the high school girl he can never forget, stops by to announce her impending wedding.\n\nHis friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) comes over from the adjoining video store, where he has been busy insulting potential customers. When someone asks him for help in finding a video, he tells them, ``A person's privacy should never be invaded'' and returns to loafing.\n\nIt's audacious. Even outrageous. And, if you can take it, very funny. Sure, some of the humor is pretty sophomoric and strained. Still, for the gags that fall flat, there are more that stir us to attention.\n\nIt's much better than the bogus ``Dazed and Confused'' which took the too- obvious and too-silly path. In contrast, ``Clerks'' is uncompromising in its determination to be at ease about its naughtiness.\n\nThe soundtrack sounds too rich for the cheapie film itself. It was added only after the film got financial aid from Miramax studio. The photography and the sound are pretty bad, as befits the budget, but Kevin Smith's wit is likely to hit the intended market. MEMO: MOVIE REVIEW\n\n``Clerks''\n\nCast: Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghiogliotti Director\n\nand Writer: Kevin Smith\n\nMusic: Scott Angley\n\nMPAA rating: R (language and more language)\n\nMal's rating: 2 1/2 stars\n\nLocation: Naro Expanded Cinema, Norfolk ILLUSTRATION: MIRAMAX photo\n\nFrom left, Lisa Spoonauer, Jeff Anderson, Brian O'Halloran and\n\nMarilyn Ghigliotti are among the kooky folks in the cheapie film\n\n``Clerks.''\n\nby CNB"
