        "text": "Donnie Darko is a dark surreal horror movie from the mind of Richard Kelly. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager experiencing weird phenomena on a daily basis. From seeing a giant talking rabbit, to seeing giant wormlike apparitions coming out of people’s chests. His parents claim that he’s just experiencing psychosis, despite everything being true. Donnie’s imaginary friend, Frank, lures him out of his home in the night. While he is gone, a plane’s engine falls through his room. This leaves Donnie in a predicament. He feels he must do whatever Frank says no matter how morbid or crazy it is, because Frank saved Donnie’s life. Frank tells Donnie he has 28 days left without any explanation to what he is talking about. So Donnie follows Frank’s orders so he can figure out what the hell is going on. This leads to a month of hallucinations, crime, and trying to figure out what Frank’s motives are. The rest of the movie questions time travel and religion.\n\nDonnie Darko is an incredible film. It is an insane roller coaster of pure madness from beginning to end. Jake Gyllenhaal does an incredible job portraying Donnie and his twisted and insane adventure. I heavily recommend it for anyone who enjoys surreal movies. The film has become a cult classic over the years do to it’s absurdness. I throughly enjoyed it and I’m sure many of you will too.\n\nIn 1989, Stephen King’s Pet Semetary was brought from book to the big screen. King had already hit box office success with The Shinig, Stand By Me, and Cujo, so it was about time another one of his books was adapted again. This time, it was Pet Semetary. A thriller about a man who finds the power to bring life back to the dead.\n\nThe movie opens with the Creed family moving into a new home, where they meet their new neighbor Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne). He warns them of the dangers of the road next to their house due to neglectful semi drivers speeding past day and night. They notice a trail next to their house, and ask him about it. He takes them up the trial and reveals to them a pet cemetary, spelled Pet Semetary on the sign (Haha title of the movie). Later, the Creed’s cat is ran over by a truck, so Jud takes Mr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) to an ancient burial ground of the Micmac tribe. Burying animals here brings them back to life, at a cost. So throughout the movie Louis must decide what he should do with this knowledge.\n\nOverall. Pet Semetart is one of my favorite movies. It has gut wrentching twists and seriously makes you question your own moral stability. Over all I’d rate it a solid 7/10. It’s a must watch Stephen King movie. The child actors are completely believable, and it has a solid story with many parts that’ll make your skin crawl.\n\nWith the month of October drawing closer, it’s good to get in the spirit of Halloween by watching some great horror films. Here’s a list I curated of some of my favorite horror movies of all time.\n\n5. Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)\n\nHalloween III was the first movie of the series not to include the infamous Michael Myers. This is also the first Halloween film not to have John Carpenter in the director’s chair. Season of the Witch attempts to break away from Michael Myers and start an anthology series about different scary events that take place on Halloween. In the film, a crazed rich man tries to bring Halloween back to it’s pagan roots through sacrificing kids with cursed masks. Through this movie wasn’t acclaimed due to it’s lack of Michael Myers, it’s a great film with a fresh plot.\n\n4. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)\n\nTobe Hooper’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was one of the first slasher movies of all time. With a low budget of $300,000 and the grittiness of the filming location make this movie extremely realistic. A group of teens set out on a trip to an old house, but what they find there isn’t what they intended, a psychopath adorned in a mask made of human skin terrorizes them along with his insane family. This movie is one of the most realistic and unsettling horror movies of all time.\n\n3. Friday the 13th (1980)\n\nFriday the 13th‘s main antagonist, Jason Voorhees, is probably the most famous slasher villains of all time. But most people don’t know that he is barely in the first movie at all. The film is about a group of teenager’s working as camp counselors at Camp Crystal Lake, where a young boy, Jason, drowned due to neglect. Someone is going around killing the counselor in this flick, but it doesn’t reveal who it is until later in the story (It’s his mom. Sorry for spoiling a 30 year old movie). Friday the 13th is a great opening to one of the best horror series ever.\n\n2. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nWhat do you get when you mix gardening equipment with an ghoulish dream-controlling child killer? The answer is Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street. A group of teens (again) realize all their dreams are being invaded by Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund) who slowly picks them off one by one. This movie is truly a horror masterpiece. The dark and surreal visuals make you question what is and isn’t a dream, and keeps you in suspense. This is a must-see film for any horror fan.\n\n1. Halloween (1978)\n\nFinishing off this list is John Carpenter’s Halloween. The first film in a franchise that would ultimately spiral into the toilet. The film depicts a young woman named Lorie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who babysits on the same street as the old Myer’s house, where a young Michael Myers used to live before he turned his sister into Swiss cheese. Years after the incident, Michael returns to the town of Haddonfield, Illinois to wreak havoc on Lorrie Strode and her friends. This is by far my favorite movie to watch on Halloween. It’s extremely suspenseful and leaves you on the edge of your seat.\n\nHere’s an idea. On Halloween, pop one of these movies in your DVD player (or pirate it) around the time the sun sets, turn off the lights and ignore all the trick-or-treaters because screw them, you’re watching a scary movie. The ambiance of the sounds of the kids outside will put you in the right setting to watch these movies. Once the movie is over, and most of the kids have gone home, look out your window. You almost expect to see Michael or Freddy outside, waiting and watching. And that’s what makes these movies so good.\n\nKevin Smith’s debut irreverent comedy Clerks details a day in the life of Dante Hicks (Brian O’Halloran), a convenience store clerk working at Quick-Stop Groceries in Rebank, New Jersey. The film is littered with a quirky cast, many of whom also making their film debut, and funny quips one can find themselves quoting on the regular among friends.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nClerks opens with Dante Hicks being called into work on his day off. (Which becomes a theme among O’Halloran’s roles in Smith’s View Askew movies) Reluctantly, he goes in. A day of hilarity, and well as drama, ensues. Including dealing with a lazy coworker named Randall Graves (Jeff Anderson), a caring girlfriend (Marilyn Ghigliotti), a cheating ex (Lisa Spoonauer), an ensemble cast of many of Kevin Smiths real live friends such as Walter Flanagan and Scott Mosier, and of course every body’s favorite dim-witted burnout Jay (Jason Mewes) and his quiet heterosexual life mate Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), as they all get into situations that are completely unreasonable, as well as ones that may hit too close to home.\n\nMY REVIEW:\n\nSmith’s ability to write dialogue is unmatched in the independent movie world. Though it has flaws, and some stuff sounds so bizarre that no one would ever actually talk like his characters do, his work is still relatable to anyone who has had to bear the hell that is the customer service world. He’s able to capture the essence of the 90’s in the movie, without making it feel outdated. The soundtrack is an amalgam of great hits of the time period, as well as independent bands Smith knew himself. The soundtrack is one of my favorites due to the dark motif it portrays. The general theme of how shitty life can be in the films is extremely relevant and relatable to the audience. The necessary choice to use black and white film due to it being cheaper, and the overall independent aesthetic of the movie helps the viewer feel like they themselves can make a movie. Smith’s work serves as an inspiration to independent film makers, and Clerks proves that anyone can pick up a camera and make their dreams come true.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\n“You’re living in denial and suppressing rage, motherfucker!”"
