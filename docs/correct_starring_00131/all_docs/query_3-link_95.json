        "text": "Julie Ege: 'Sex Symbol of the 1970s'\n\nSee the complete article here:\n\nSaturday 3 May 2008\n\nIn the late Sixties and early Seventies, British cinema-goers, and British men in general, had a weakness for Scandinavian women. For a time, the Norwegian actress and model Julie Ege was as ubiquitous as Sweden's Britt Ekland.\n\nIn 1969, Ege's stunning looks caught the eye of the film producer Albert Broccoli, who cast her in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the only James Bond film to feature George Lazenby as the lead. In 1971, Ege was Voluptua to Frankie Howerd's Lurcio in the first Up Pompeii film, based on the titter-heavy sitcom of the same name. Having starred in Creatures the World Forgot, another Hammer \"cave girl\" film in the vein of the Raquel Welch vehicle One Million Years BC, Ege was touted as the \"Sex Symbol of the 1970s\" by Sir James Carreras, head of Hammer Film Productions, and his son Michael.\n\nDespite further appearances in sci-fi and horror hokum like The Final Programme (1973), Craze, Dr of Evil (aka The Mutations) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (all in 1974), she was typecast as a glamour girl, in comedies such as The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins (1971) and Not Now Darling (1973), both with Leslie Phillips, as well as Percy's Progress (1974) and The Amorous Milkman (1975).\n\nBorn in Sandnes, on the south-west coast of Norway, in 1943, she was a bit of a tomboy but blossomed into a teenager obsessed with Hollywood stars. Spotted by local photographers, Ege appeared in advertisements for \"anything from dresses to sardines\", she later recalled. Following a short-lived marriage to a major in the Norwegian army, she moved to Oslo, won a beauty contest and took part in the Miss Universe pageant in Florida in 1962. She then remarried and undertook various modelling assignments, including an appearance in Penthouse magazine.\n\nIn 1967, she made her acting début playing a German masseuse in Stompa til Sjøs (\"The Sky and the Ocean\"), a low-budget Norwegian film, and also had an uncredited part in Robbery, a British gangster picture about the Great Train Robbery. She settled in London, registered with various model agencies, and sent her picture to Broccoli. The Bond producer signed Ege to play the Scandinavian Girl, one of the 10 women of different nationalities being brainwashed by Blofeld, the villain portrayed by Telly Savalas in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (the English Girl was played by Joanna Lumley). Ege spent nearly three months on location at Piz Gloria, the revolving restaurant on top of the Schilthorn in Switzerland, but was disappointed to see that, in the finished film, she only appeared on screen for a few moments.\n\nIn 1970, Ned Sherrin gave her a role opposite Marty Feldman in the comedy Every Home Should Have One. \"It was my first real part with dialogue. They wanted me to look and sound like a Scandinavian nanny so I gave them just that. It was really difficult,\" Ege joked. She had spent time as an au pair in London in the early Sixties. \"Once the film opened, all the newspapers carried a photo of me with the caption 'Every Home Should Have One'. I was famous overnight and was not prepared for all the decision-making so crucial at that moment,\" she admitted.\n\nEge's subsequent career moves bore out this claim. She turned down the chance to appear with Peter Sellers in the saucy comedy There's a Girl in My Soup and signed up with Hammer to do Creatures the World Forgot. The shooting on location in Africa turned out to be something of an ordeal for Ege who had recently given birth to her first daughter. \"They made me wear this awful wig and my bikini was a far cry from the one Raquel Welch wore,\" she recalled. \"I had dirt smeared all over me. My newborn child was back in England and after a few days I got homesick.\"\n\nEge then undertook a gruelling publicity schedule which included appearances on the Johnny Carson and David Frost chat-shows and a special edition of The Money Programme documenting the amount of money Hammer was investing in her. However, Creatures the World Forgot was slated by the critics and her career lost momentum after she passed on Hammer's Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde in 1972. \"I was by then very reluctant about doing nudity,\" she said. \"Many people think I did so much nudity in my films. I did a short scene in Every Home Should Have One, and two bathtub scenes in Not Now Darling and Mutations.\"\n\nEge was happier doing comedies, including playing \"the sexy wife of a mad scientist\" (Donald Sinden) in Rentadick (1972), even if the project went so awry that Graham Chapman and John Cleese, the film's original writers with John Fortune and John Wells, asked for their names to be removed from the credits. In 1972, she also had cameos in The Alf Garnett Saga and in Go For a Take with Reg Varney of On the Buses fame. \"They needed a pretty girl with a good attitude to play these parts,\" she said. \"It was all a laugh and I have never seen these films since.\"\n\nIn the Seventies, Ege lived for several years with the Beatles associate Tony Bramwell and recorded a version of \"Love\", a John Lennon composition originally featured on the John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in 1970. She subsequently went back to Norway and took up photography before training as a nurse in the Eighties. She was delighted when one of her patients presented her with a video copy of The Amorous Milkman.\n\nOver the last decade, Ege was amazed by the renewed interest in her films. \"There I was on the front cover of so many newspapers as the forgotten diva of British horror and comedy films,\" she said in 2004, two years after publishing her autobiography, Naken (\"Naked\"), in Norway. In 1999, she visited Britain and took part in a reunion of Hammer alumni. In 2005, she featured in the BBC documentary Crumpet! A Very British Sex Symbol, presented by the former Daily Sport editor Tony Livesey. \"To be honest, I was never really that proud of my performance in films,\" she said, \"but I gave it my best and enjoyed the work very much.\"\n\nPierre Perrone\n\nJulie Ege, model, actress and nurse: born Sandnes, Norway 13 November 1943; twice married (two daughters); died Oslo 29 April 2008.\n\nCasino Royale must have looked an appetising prospect when it went into pre-production in 1965. The Saltzman/Broccoli Bond movies had established the playboy spy as a bankable commodity, and when producer Charles Feldman signed up comic genius Peter Sellers for his film version of Fleming's novel, he doubtless thought he had a licence to print money. Rather than breaking box-office records, however, Feldman's $12 million movie would devour its budget, fail to recoup its costs and destroy careers, including his own.\n\nBut Casino Royale was cursed even before Feldman optioned it in the early '60s. CBS, who had made a US TV movie of it in 1954, passed the option on to actor-director Gregory Ratoff. He signed to make a big-screen version for Fox in 1960 - only to die before a frame was shot.\n\nAs for Feldman, his problems began the day he hired Sellers - at the time one of the biggest movie stars in the world. The impact of his performances in Dr Strangelove, in addition to the commercial success of the Pink Panther movies, elevated Sellers to a position of rare power for a comic actor. Feldman knew from experience that Sellers was a draw - the actor had helped make a hit of the producer's giddy comedy What's New Pussycat? - so he agreed to pay the former Goon a then-unheard-of $1m to play accountant and Bond imposter Evelyn Tremble.\n\nNo sooner had he agreed terms than Sellers fell out with Feldman and began to act irrationally. He insisted that the producer hire his friend, TV director Joe McGrath, and refused to appear on set with co-star Orson Welles. Many concluded that the already eccentric Sellers had gone mad, especially after he came to blows with McGrath and then fled the set - never to return.\n\nThe impact of his performances in Dr Strangelove, in addition to the commercial success of the Pink Panther movies, elevated Sellers to a position of rare power for a comic actor\n\nPeter Sellers' walkout seemed to spell the end of Casino Royale. But rather than capitulating, Charles Feldman reverted to his original plan and set about making a truly immense movie. Out went McGrath and original writer Wolf Mankowitz; in came a string of different directors - Val Guest, John Huston, Richard Talmadge, Robert Parrish, Ken Hughes - and a raft of screenwriters that included co-stars Woody Allen and David Niven, Hollywood legend Billy Wilder and groundbreaking novelist Terry Southern .\n\nThe end result has to be one of the strangest films ever made by a Hollywood studio. The combination of Sellers' walkout and Feldman's extravagance deprived Casino Royale of anything approaching structure and transformed it into a series of unconnected sketches. Worst of all, here was a comedy almost totally devoid of laughs.\n\nIt was to be Feldman's swansong: he died of stomach cancer within a year of the film's 1967 premiere. The paranoid Peter Sellers had predicted as much. \"Feldman is going to die!\" he once ranted, \"and the reason he'll die is so he can blame me! He'll say, 'Sellers killed me!' He'll do it to spite me!\"\n\nCharles Feldman (producer): I love the movies, always have. I like money too, but only because it lets me make the movies I want to make.\n\nOrson Welles (actor, Le Chiffre): The movies need people like Charles Feldman: rich, jolly, generous men who're happy writing cheques.\n\nVal Guest (director): Charlie found out that, when he bought the book, all he got was the title. Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli had already used everything in the book except the baccarat game, so the whole thing had to be structured around that.\n\nWoody Allen (actor, Jimmy Bond/Dr Noah): I was offered a lot of money and a small part. My manager said, \"Why not? It could become a big movie.\" So I went to London. I was on a good salary and expense account. But they didn't film me for six months! I stayed in London at their expense for six months! That's only one example of how utterly wasteful the project was.\n\nI once saw him on one phone to Peter Sellers, on a second to United Artists and on a third to the Italian government\n\nBryan Forbes (first-choice director): Charlie came into my life brandishing a copy of Casino Royale. He told me he wanted to have five James Bond and would guarantee me an all-star cast. \"You can write it wherever you want. Do you like the south of France?\" Gifts started to arrive - silk scarves, theatre tickets. Charlie was talking Monopoly money to secure my services. Every time I expressed doubts, he sweetened the deal.\n\nPeter Sellers (actor, Evelyn Tremble): People will swim through shit if you put a few bob in it.\n\nWoody Allen: Charlie was a genius. I once saw him on one phone to Peter Sellers, on a second to United Artists and on a third to the Italian government. He was a big-time charming con man and I never trusted him for a second.\n\nBryan Forbes: I said 'yes' to Charlie and then thought about the basic idiocies of the script. Five Bonds! That meant departing from the novel. I called one of Charlie's assistants who went into a fit on the phone. But I stuck to my guns.\n\nWolf Mankowitz (screenwriter): Peter Sellers was a treacherous lunatic. My advice to Feldman was not in any circumstances to get involved with Sellers. But Sellers was at his peak. I told Charlie that Sellers would fuck it all up.\n\nJoseph McGrath (director): Feldman was glad to get Peter at any price. He'd put up the money for Sellers' insurance on What's New Pussycat? - after his heart attack, nobody would cover him.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Charlie gave Sellers a Rolls Royce on the first day of shooting as a come-on.\n\nPeter Sellers: I was offered $1 million to play Bond. I said, \"You must be out of your bloody minds - what about Sean Connery?\" Feldman said, \"Yes, I know, but I have this book and I'm going to make it.\" I said, \"I certainly can't play Bond!\"\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Charlie Feldman offered Peter more and more money to play 007. In the end, the fee was so large Peter would have been mad to turn it down.\n\nPeter Sellers: I wanted to play James Bond the way Tony Hancock would play him. But Ian Fleming's people would never have allowed it.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: In the end, Peter didn't play Bond. He played Evelyn Tremble. \"Who's Evelyn Tremble?\" everyone asked. Nobody knew. But then we didn't know who Sellers was either.\n\nCharles Feldman: The only way to make a film with Peter is to let him direct, write and produce it as well as star in it.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Sellers wanted different directors; he wanted to piss around with the script. He knew nothing about anything except doing funny faces and funny voices.\n\nJoseph McGrath: Peter asked me if I'd be interested in directing a film he'd agreed to star in. I said, \"I'd be delighted to.\" And that's where the trouble started.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: By Casino Royale, Peter Sellers was pretty well round the bend and couldn't function properly. He'd change the order of shooting. He'd be 'unavailable' or constantly change his timing, making it hard to splice material together.\n\nSellers was frightened of the scale of Orson - his legend, literally his weight and immensity.\n\nOrson Welles: Sellers wasn't terribly bright, but he came on as the great actor.\n\nJoseph McGrath: One of the problems that blew the film apart was that Orson and I got along really well. And Sellers got really annoyed. \"I didn't think you and Orson would take sides against me.\" I said, \"I'm not - but Orson thinks we can come up with some funny stuff.\" Sellers replied, \"I'll only attempt to come up with funny stuff so long as he's not here.\" He was frightened of the scale of Orson - his legend, literally his weight and immensity.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: I'll never forget the occasion Orson and I, two rather large fellows, were in the lift. The door opened and Sellers was there. Sellers wasn't talking to Orson, and he was none too keen on me either. He wouldn't go down in the lift with us - said it wasn't safe. Orson was pissed off. \"What the fuck is he talking about?\" \"I think he means the combined weight, Orson.\" \"What the fuck does he weigh? Skinny as a shrimp. Looks like a shrimp, come to think of it.\"\n\nJoseph McGrath: Orson didn't have the same attitude about his career as Peter did. Peter was what he did. Orson thought, I'll be here for four weeks, let's enjoy ourselves. Peter's thing was: My career is on the line.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Peter was terrified of playing with Orson and converted this into an aversion for him.\n\nJoseph McGrath: Orson would come onto the set at 9am prompt, sit down at the baccarat table and say, \"So, Joe, where's our thin friend today?\"\n\nOrson Welles: Sellers was very proud of how thin he was. Apparently, he'd taken a lot of pills to help shift the weight. If you listened to him talking, you'd think it was the greatest achievement of his career.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Sellers claimed Orson was surrounded by a dark aura and said it would not be healthy for him to be close to Orson. He was incredibly superstitious. He was obsessed with horoscopes, tarot cards and colours.\n\nPeter Sellers: Green has been a superstition of mine for a long time. And purple. Vittorio De Sica told me, \"My dear Peter, purple is the colour of death.\" And certain shades of green. The hard, acidy green is bad. I pick up strange vibrations from it. It disturbs me.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Sellers was completely obsessed with royalty. He was always going on about Princess Margaret. His biggest thrill was to present people to her.\n\nOrson Welles: The fact that Princess Margaret was stopping by every day at my house was unknown to Sellers. One day she came to the set to have lunch with Peter, or so he claimed. He couldn't wait to tell the cast and crew who he was dining with. Then she walked past him and said, \"Hello, Orson, I haven't seen you for days!\" That was the real end. That's when we couldn't speak lines to each other. \"Orson, I haven't seen you for days!\" absolutely killed him. He went white as a sheet, because he was going to present me!\n\nJoseph McGrath: Peter and I had a fist fight in his caravan. He threw a punch and I hit him back. We got separated by Gerry Crampton, the stunt coordinator. \"I love you both. I don't know who to thump first,\" Gerry said. Sellers and I started laughing and crying, but I said, \"There's no point going on, because somebody's going to hit somebody again.\" And he did.\n\nPeter Sellers: If I find myself surrounded by stupid people, I get rid of them.\n\nJoseph McGrath: After I was fired - at Peter's request - Sellers phoned and said, \"Come back! Feldman's going to give you a Rolls Royce.\" I said, \"I don't want one.\" Two years later, I was in LA and Jerry Bressler, who got a credit on Casino Royale as an executive producer, pulled up in a white Coriniche. \"Are you Joe McGrath?\" he said. \"I'm driving your Rolls Royce!\"\n\nPeter Sellers: In the end, Peter did one of his celebrated walkouts.\n\nKen Hughes (director): Peter stated that he was not prepared to complete the movie. Casino Royale came to a ghastly halt. Charles Feldman was left with a few scenes shot with Sellers but no movie. He had to consider closing down. But big money was involved and he decided to go ahead.\n\nJoseph McGrath: It's hard to finish a film when you lose your star.\n\nKen Hughes: At a panic script meeting, it was decided that since they no longer had Sellers, they'd have to improvise. The writers were working like crazy trying to save the day. Feldman hired everyone in sight: Woody Allen, David Niven, John Huston. It was total chaos. Units were shooting in three studios. I was shooting at Shepperton, another unit was shooting at MGM. And none of us saw a completed script. I had to call the director at MGM to find out what he was shooting so I'd know how it dovetailed into what I was shooting.\n\nOrson Welles: At the end of it, Charlie Feldman hired John Huston to direct and John moved everybody to Ireland because he wanted to go fox hunting.\n\nKen Hughes: The end result speaks for itself - a mish-mash that came into being because the star had walked out.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: The film doesn't make any sense. Because of Sellers it was cut, re-cut, screwed around with a thousand different ways.\n\nJoseph McGrath: Peter told me years later, \"I don't have a lot of friends, but I can trust you. Because we've been through hell together. You've actually faced me and thrown a punch at me. I know you won't put up with any shit.\n\nPeter Sellers: I am not a funny man. I don't have a strong comedy personality. But even without that, you can be successful if the material is funny.\n\nWoody Allen: I never bothered to see Casino Royale. I knew it would be horrible. The set was a madhouse. I knew then that the only way to make a film is to control it completely.\n\nPeter Sellers: The making of that film would make an interesting film in itself.\n\nThe Stakes Behind The James Bond Rights Auction\n\nAs Warner Bros And Others Try To Win 007’s Loyalties\n\nFrom Sony\n\nSee the complete article here:\n\nBy Anita Busch, Mike Fleming Jr | October 30, 2015 8:10am\n\nAsk anyone in the hunt for the next batch of James Bond films that are now up for grabs, and this is what you’ll hear, as voiced by one exec whose studio is among those in the chase: “They might not say they’re actively shopping it, but they are certainly making it known their deal is up and they will be.”\n\nThe James Bond distribution deal with Sony is done after Spectre bows in the U.S. on November 6. It could stay at Sony or it could head to Warner Bros., or Fox (which handles MGM’s home video), or Universal, and Paramount. Or even Disney, where Bob Iger has shown the wisdom of making big bets can work out in buying out whole companies like Marvel and Lucasfilm for cash and stock.\n\nAt a time when studios are hungrier than ever for proven global franchises, James Bond is Hollywood’s longest-running success story. Consider that 50 years after Sean Connery launched the character in 1962’s Dr No, 007’s last outing Skyfall became the series’ biggest grossing film, topping out at $1.1 billion globally. With Daniel Craig and that film’s director Sam Mendes a week away from the U.S. launch of what might be their last Bond film together, there is every expectation that Spectre will chase that high-water gross mark. It already opened briskly overseas.\n\nSo it’s not surprising that a hit-starved studio like Warner Bros, or any other major, would covet the franchise. Indeed, sources sighted Warner Bros chief Kevin Tsujihara at the Montage Hotel recently with Gary Barber, the point person at MGM whose job it is to figure out the distribution future of 007 for MGM and Danjaq producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. According to our source, the chatter seemed more intense than a meet and greet. It looked like they were throwing around numbers. Not surprisingly, Warner Bros has been oft mentioned as the most aggressive in this hunt.\n\nWhat’s odd about this is that nobody is saying that Sony hasn’t done a fine job in marketing and releasing the Bond films. But the last deal was made by Amy Pascal, and she is no longer in charge. The new guy in the seat, Tom Rothman, is known from his days running Fox as a tough, bottom-line-minded executive who most feel would walk away from a deal that gave the studio market share at the expense of profit. Indeed, some say that at Pascal’s urging, Sony gave up too much the last time around to keep 007 in the fold.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal rifled through those hacked Sony documents and pried out a memo that underscores the troubling risk-reward disparity. According to WSJ, co-financing and marketing and releasing Skyfall brought Sony $57 million on a film that grossed $1.1 billion globally. MGM, in turn, made $175 million, while Danjaq made $109 million. And that doesn’t factor in all the other things Sony gave up and the movies like the 21 Jump Street franchise that MGM was kissed into when the last re-up deal was made. Some would consider the math on this to be on par with the old first-dollar gross deal scenarios which became toxic to studios when owners like Sumner Redstone realized that a star like Tom Cruise had earned way more than $50 million on a Mission: Impossible movie through first-dollar gross participation before Paramount — which financed the whole film –had even recouped its outlay. His generous portion on video pushed that payday to an estimated $80 million.\n\nSo much is up in the air right now on 007. First off, the odds are against Craig and Mendes returning for another go, which would mean starting again with a new actor even though reports indicate Craig might owe one more film to fulfill his contract. When Craig recently observed that he would rather “slash his wrists” than do another Bond movie, it certainly echoed loudly around Hollywood, even if those close to him attributed it mostly to the bad idea of putting Craig in front of a journalist right after he completed a time-press and arduous Spectre shoot in which he seriously injured his knee. It would be similar, they said, to asking a woman just out of childbirth how eager she was to have another.\n\nHere’s what we hear. 007 rights gatekeepers Barber, and Wilson and Broccoli, will wait until Spectre plays around the world and accumulates an ungodly global gross that will only strengthen their leverage. And then, early next year, they will make the best deal. If that means bidding farewell to Sony, so be it.\n\nSony had initially gotten rights to Casino Royale years ago in a deal orchestrated deftly behind the scenes by former Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO John Calley, who revived James Bond while head of United Artists. Because of that, Sony released Casino Royale with a new Bond — Craig — and grossed about $600M worldwide.\n\nWhen it came time to re-up, Pascal was running the studio and people are still debating whether her zeal to keep Bond led Sony to give up too much. On the plus side, Pascal was invited to have a creative voice in the process over the last few films. Sony co-financed movies that were big hits, and received a distribution fee that some say was capped.\n\nBut it was the other concessions granted by Sony that still has tongues wagging. Sony offered up some of its plum projects to be co-financed by MGM. At the time, the sexiest one the studio had was The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. That film, which starred Craig, went into the pot and while the movie didn’t come close to meeting everyone’s out-sized expectations, 21 Jump Street — another film offered up for co-financing — certainly did. MGM got to be part of that hit and its sequel and presumably will be part of the next film that is rumored to meld that series with Men In Black. Sony, in turn, got to co-finance and release some MGM films, including the Robocop remake. Sony is now gearing up for another Dragon Tattoo installment with The Girl In The Spider’s Web, the book written by David Lagercrantz, who was installed by the rights-holder relatives of the late author Stieg Larsson. Pascal is a producer on that movie, and MGM is expected to be in the mix if the studio wants to be.\n\nThe proceeds from these co-fi deals went into into a split pot, but the unsung coup for MGM was that it got to broker almost all of the international TV deals. That studio was still getting back on its feet after being frozen in a bankruptcy, and it’s believed they didn’t have the kind of clout to get as high a price as Sony would have. It also left Sony’s loyal global customers on the outside looking in because MGM was making the deals and had its own list of customers. The prospect of all that led to widespread internal disagreements within Sony divisions over whether the studio should make such a deal, but Pascal won the day.\n\nTwo blockbusters and Spectre later, and Pascal is now off producing movies. And the studio will have some serious decisions to make as it formulates how crucial it is to keep James Bond. Many believe that no studio will replicate the horse trading that took place in the last Sony 007 deal. It is an open question whether another studio will find some ground on which they can get the market share bragging rights that come with 007, while not feeling they made a loss leader deal.\n\nIf ever MGM was going to get back into the distribution business — it disbanded distribution when it emerged from bankruptcy and has placed big movies like the Ben-Hur and The Magnificent Seven remakes all over town — the 007 franchise would be the one to relaunch. That’s always an option, but more of a long shot than the notion of Craig returning to His Majesty’s Secret Service.\n\nThe betting here is that if Sony’s brain trust led by Michael Lynton and Rothman won’t do it, another big studio like Warner Bros — which successfully partnered with MGM on the billion-dollar The Hobbit trilogy — will swallow hard and make the deal. Tsujihara and Barber are tight, and you can bet that Warner Bros will move heaven and earth to make a hit out of MGM’s upcoming Rocky film Creed, the Ryan Coogler-directed film that opens Thanksgiving with Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan starring. Is it too much to imagine that soon, the most important entries on Tsujihara’s call sheet will be Barber, along with Harry Potter author JK Rowling and James Packer?\n\nTimothy Dalton opens up about Penny\n\nDreadful, leaving James Bond, and the\n\ndemon in all of us\n\nSee the complete article here:\n\nScott Meslow | May 12, 2014\n\nI answer the phone and am immediately greeted by a warm, polite, and unmistakably British voice: \"Hello. This is Timothy Dalton.\"\n\nDalton quickly launches into a string of apologies, as he's calling several hours after our scheduled interview time, which he forgot because he was driving his children to school. \"I'm mortified,\" he reiterates, repeatedly, throughout our conversation.\n\nIndeed, Dalton is as warm and conversational in real life as Sir Malcolm Murray — the character he plays in Showtime's excellent new horror drama Penny Dreadful — is cold and solitary. Describing an emotional scene from the end of Penny Dreadful's first episode — a scene in which he doesn't even appear — Dalton becomes emotional: \"I wept,\" he proclaims. \"Literally. I just found it so moving.\"\n\nDalton is revelatory as the haunted, haunting Sir Malcolm, who assembles a group of misfits that includes Vanessa Ives (Eva Green), Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett), and Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadaway) to explore what he calls \"the place where science and superstition go hand-in-hand.\" Dalton himself isn't much of a horror fan, and he thinks for a long time before coming up with another piece of horror fiction that he admires. (\"The first thing that comes to my mind is the original Alien, where you never saw the damned alien until the end. That was pretty scary.\") He's also skeptical of television; in an interview with Entertainment Weekly several years ago, Dalton said that he doubted he'd ever take a recurring role in a TV series because he thinks he \"would find it difficult to do the same thing year in and year out.\" With all that in mind, I had to ask: What was it about Penny Dreadful that turned his head?\n\n\"How much good writing is there around these days?\" he asks. \"There are some terrific movies made. Great TV? There is good writing in TV, and some splendid writing in TV. But it's not common. So when it's in front of you, and it's good, and you've got someone like [writer and showrunner John Logan], and someone like [director J.A. Bayona] doing the first two episodes… You've got to do it. You can't say no, really. You could — but you shouldn't.\"\n\nBut as an actor, Dalton remains wary about the boredom that could come with playing the same character for too long. \"Once you've created a character… once you've done it, once you've taken on that challenge — and hopefully been successful — what is the joy of repeating it? I don't know that there is any joy in repeating it. Once you've done a few weeks in the West End or on Broadway, and you've really got to grips with a serious piece of work, there's got to come a moment when it loses some of its challenge because you've already done it. You've climbed the mountain.\"\n\nThat leads, quite naturally, into a discussion of the role that Dalton is still most famous for: James Bond, who Dalton played in 1987's The Living Daylights and 1989's Licence to Kill.\n\nDalton waves away the idea that the fear of stagnation was a part of his relatively short tenure as 007. \"That was my worry going into the James Bond franchise, certainly,\" he explains. \"But it wasn't why I left.\" That doesn't mean he didn't have some concerns about the franchise: \"On [Licence to Kill], I think I saw the script about two weeks before we started shooting. You know, that's not great, is it?\"\n\nLicence to Kill wasn't supposed to be his final James Bond movie; a third 007 movie, which would have starred Dalton, entered preproduction in 1990. \"We had the script. They were interviewing directors. We were really rolling forward, ready to start. It was actually quite a good story, I thought,\" says Dalton. But a lengthy legal dispute between Eon Productions and MGM delayed the film indefinitely — and gave Dalton an out. \"Because of the lawsuit, I was free of the contract,\" Dalton explains. \"And [producer] Mr. Broccoli, who I really respected as a producer and as a friend, asked me what I was going to do when it was resolved. I said, 'Look, in all honesty, I don't think that I will continue.' He asked me for my support during that time, which of course, I gave him.\"\n\nBut when the lawsuit was resolved several years later, Dalton had a change of heart. \"When [the next movie] did come about, it was probably four or five years later,\" he explains. \"[Broccoli] asked if I would come back, and I said, 'Well, I've actually changed my mind a little bit. I think that I'd love to do one. Try and take the best of the two that I have done, and consolidate them into a third.' And he said, quite rightly, 'Look, Tim. You can't do one. There's no way, after a five-year gap between movies that you can come back and just do one. You'd have to plan on four or five.' And I thought, oh, no, that would be the rest of my life. Too much. Too long. So I respectfully declined.\" When Goldeneye hit theaters in 1995, it was Pierce Brosnan in the starring role.\n\nIn the years since, Dalton has turned in strong performances in everything from Hot Fuzz to Toy Story 3 — but Penny Dreadful is the meatiest role he's had in a while, and he's clearly relishing the depth and complexity that comes with playing Sir Malcolm Murray. \"Vanessa, in a later episode, describes him as weak, foul, lustful, vainglorious,\" he explains. \"You could add into that obsessive, manipulative, ruthless. You could also add in compassionate and courageous and all sorts of things. […] But this could be true about all of us, at certain moments of our lives, because human beings are such complex creatures. Actors, sometimes, they look for a character and they just want to play one thing. But human beings are so multifaceted, you know? We carry with us our good and our evil.\"\n\n\"I know [Penny Dreadful] is set in Victorian times — but it's about us, isn't it? Our guilt, and our shame, and our own personal demons, and how we work them out. How we come to terms with them, and whether we try to go back and turn them the right way. I think some people try to atone, and I don't think atonement leads to redemption at all. That's my personal feeling. You know, I think you have to accept your guilt. You have to live with your guilt. It's always struck me as being weird: You do something terrible, and you do penance. Penance isn't anything. I mean, what does penance mean? You do a few good deeds here or there? The consequences of your foul deeds will live on. You've got to handle redemption a different way.\"\n\nOnce again, we've taken a philosophical detour — but Dalton hastens to get back on track. \"Let me bring it back to Penny Dreadful,\" he says. \"You have to have characters you believe in, characters you empathize with. You have to have truth. And then you take them on a really interesting and scary journey. We are human beings watching, and we do have to empathize. I think that's what we're doing, and I hope that's what we're doing in Penny Dreadful. Showing an audience that all of these people are humans. Even if they're warped, even if they've got great problems. They're human beings, and they're trying to come to terms with themselves.\"\n\nHe pauses, then laughs. \"But that's the boring side. On the other hand, you could say, 'All the good-looking people! Blood! Sex! Violence!' And fortunately, we've got it all.\"\n\nPenny Dreadful airs on Showtime every Sunday at 10 p.m. You can stream the first episode here.\n\n(Embedded Image: AP Photo/MGM/United Artists, FILE)\n\nFrom the Archives: Consummate Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nDies at 64\n\nSee the complete article here:\n\nBy Edward J. Boyer | Times Staff Writer |\n\nMay 17, 1990 | 12:00 AM\n\nAltovise and Sammy Davis Jr. in 1972\n\nSammy Davis Jr., the quintessential showman embraced by his peers as \"Mr. Entertainment\" for his enormous talent and versatility, died early Wednesday morning at his home in Beverly Hills after a nine-month battle with throat cancer.\n\nDeath came as friends and fans of the diminutive, 64-year-old entertainer maintained a vigil outside his home. They had been gathering there since Tuesday when word began to circulate that the end was near.\n\nThe tributes were immediate:\n\nFrank Sinatra, who with Davis, Joey Bishop, Dean Martin and Peter Lawford became Hollywood's fast-living \"Rat Pack\" of the 1960s and who knew him for 40 years, said he \"wished the world could have known Sam as I did. . . . It was a generous God who gave him to us for all these years . . . . Sam was the best friend a man could have.\"\n\nSaid Bishop: \"Guess they must need a good show up in Heaven, that's all I can say.\" Then he added, \"God I'm sorry. I loved him.\"\n\nMartin hailed Davis as a great entertainer and \"an even greater friend, not only to me, but to everyone whose life he touched.\"\n\nFormer President Ronald Reagan remembered him as \"a special talent which made him more than just a great entertainer--it made him magical.\"\n\nComedian Bill Cosby said that \"it would have been fantastic to see him at age 82 still enjoying performing for the people. I'll see him later.\"\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley—who counted Davis among his friends and political supporters—ordered the city's flags flown at half staff.\n\nDavis had battled the cancer in his throat since September, when a tumor was discovered growing behind his vocal cords. He began a series of radiation treatments that left his skin discolored and raw enough to bleed when he touched his throat.\n\nWhen his illness became known, fans around the world deluged him with letters letting him know that he was in their prayers.\n\nShow business friends from Sinatra and Cosby to Liza Minnelli and Steve Lawrence rallied to his side, putting themselves at his disposal. A month before the cancer was detected, Davis, Sinatra and Minnelli (filling in for an ailing Dean Martin) had been on a reunion tour, bringing sellout audiences to their feet.\n\nHis friends' affection for the man who enjoyed describing himself as a \"little one-eyed colored guy\" was nowhere more evident than during a television tribute earlier this year, commemorating his more than six decades in show business.\n\nSaid singer Whitney Houston, a guest on the televised tribute taped last year: \"He helped to break down the color barriers. I think he fought the battle for the rest of us.\"\n\nDavis would have been the first to acknowledge that he was but one soldier among generations of troops who assaulted color barriers. Nonetheless, he determinedly fought his battles with whatever weapons were available, including one that he felt the haters could not withstand—his talent.\n\nWhether dancing with his father and uncle on countless television guest spots, captivating movie audiences as Sportin' Life in \"Porgy and Bess,\" singing his way through \"Mr. Wonderful\" on Broadway, or finding a hit song and a theme in \"Candy Man,\" Davis brought an exuberance to every performance.\n\nHis versatility was such that he could go on a bare stage alone and weave a stunning evening of entertainment with song, dance, impressions and comedy.\n\n\"This is what I want on my tombstone,\" he once told an interviewer:\n\n\"Sammy Davis Jr., the date, and underneath, one word: 'Entertainer.' That's all, because that's what I am, man.\"\n\nBehind Davis' superb stagecraft, however, and despite the adoration of faithful fans, Davis was for much of his life a man at war with himself.\n\nHe buried his pain in alcohol and cocaine—chasing the delusion that his \"swinging\" lifestyle somehow compensated for his two divorces, his estrangement from his children, and his futile efforts to become what he thought others expected him to be.\n\n\"I didn't like me,\" Davis told an interviewer in 1989. \"So it made all the sense in the world to me at the time that if you don't like yourself, you destroy yourself.\n\n\"The monkey on my back is that I created a lifestyle that was no good for me. My life was empty. I had drugs, booze and broads, and I had nothing.\"\n\nHe had to fight his way through what he has called \"the tortures of the damned,\" and he credited Altovise, his wife of 20 years, with helping him make a turnaround.\n\n\"She was there for me,\" he said. \"She gave me all the support in the world.\"\n\nThe turnaround began when doctors told him in 1983 that his stomach and liver were so damaged that he would die soon if he didn't stop drinking. He stopped. In 1984 and 1985, he underwent hip replacement surgery.\n\nBut he returned to dance again and charmed movie fans as Little Mo, the veteran hoofer with still enough moves to accept a \"challenge\" dance, in the 1989 film \"Tap.\"\n\nThe drinking was only one of his excesses. He spent money just as easily.\n\nDuring his illustrious career, he had earned millions and spent or given away more. And by the 1980s, the Internal Revenue Service was clamoring for unpaid millions in taxes it said he owed.\n\nDavis also shamelessly gushed over every guest on his television shows. And his ostentation became a trademark. If one gold ring was good, four had to be better.\n\nTry as he might to win love with his talent, his public persona had become an easy target--grist for a devastating (and, he said, all too accurate) impersonation by comedian Billy Crystal.\n\nBut if his excesses were obnoxious to some, Davis, the individual, was a monument to generosity for others. He marched for civil rights in Selma, Ala., played benefits for Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH, and helped raise funds to investigate the Atlanta child murders.\n\nBenjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, remembered him Wednesday as \"a humanitarian whose heart was so big . . . that it dwarfed his frame.\"\n\nHooks, in a statement, called attention to Davis' accomplishments \"in the struggle of African-Americans,\" much of which \"was not widely known . . . .\"\n\nCoretta Scott King called him \"not only one of the greatest performing artists of our age\" but \"an ardent, tireless supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement . . . .\"\n\nDavis would break into his schedule to play a benefit for a blind ex-fighter or sell bonds for Israel. Even as his bank account slid toward empty, he was contributing thousands of dollars to his child's school.\n\nThis consummate entertainer whose career has been described as a series of radical mood swings was born Dec. 8, 1925, in Harlem, N.Y., where his father was lead dancer and his mother, Elvera (Sanchez) Davis, was in the chorus of a vaudeville troupe headed by his adopted uncle, Will Mastin.\n\nWhen the act went on the road, Davis remained with his paternal grandmother, Rosa (Mama) Davis, who raised him until his parents divorced. His father took custody, and by age 3 a mugging little Sammy had made his stage debut.\n\nHe learned to dance by watching routines from the wings, and the rhythms from his flashing feet soon became a popular addition to the act. He made his film debut in 1933, at age 7, in \"Rufus Jones for President,\" a comedy in which a boy dreams he is elected President.\n\nDavis never attended school. His father and Mastin hired tutors—especially when truant officers applied pressure—to teach the youngster the three Rs. That irregular instruction and Davis' later friendship with a U.S. Army sergeant who loaned him books and taught him remedial reading was as close as he came to formal education.\n\nMastin's troupe, which had included 12 members, began to shrink with the decline of vaudeville and eventually was reduced to \"The Will Mastin Trio, Featuring Sammy Davis Jr.\"\n\nTouring in the 1930s and '40s, the trio often could not find hotels that would rent rooms to blacks or restaurants that would serve them. But it was not until Davis was drafted into the Army's first integrated unit at age 18 that he ran into the naked racism never far beneath the surface of World War II America.\n\nDuring basic training in Wyoming, he was beaten, kicked and spat upon by bigoted whites in his barracks. Describing those days in his best-selling 1965 biography, Yes, I Can, Davis said his knuckles were covered with scabs from fighting racists during his first three months in the Army.\n\nPerhaps the ugliest incident occurred when a group of white enlistees decided to teach him a lesson for being too familiar with a white female officer.\n\nDavis said they lured him to a remote spot on the base, where they beat him and painted racial slurs on his chest and forehead. They forced him to tap dance and smeared more white paint over his body, only to remove a spot to demonstrate that beneath the paint he was still \"just as black 'n' ugly as ever.\"\n\nThe pain of that incident motivated him to pump even more energy into his performances at camp shows. He felt that his sheer talent could reach the haters, \"neutralize them,\" force them to recognize him as a person.\n\nHe used an audience's affection as fuel, and he made no secret of his \"joy of being liked.\" And he would work himself to exhaustion to please an audience, friends said, in a futile effort to make the world love him--to erase the brutal memories of his Army experiences.\n\nDavis rejoined his father and uncle after the war, but the trio led a hand-to-mouth existence as vaudeville died and they tried breaking into nightclubs. They worked hotels in Las Vegas, where they could neither register as guests nor enter the casinos because they were black.\n\nSome New York City clubs would not allow him to enter, and he needed a special permit just to be on the streets of Miami Beach at night when he performed there.\n\nBut Davis continued to increase his repertoire—adding trumpet, drums, celebrity impressions—as the trio crisscrossed the country, taking whatever dates they could find.\n\nIn 1946, Metronome magazine named him \"Most Outstanding New Personality\" on the strength of his Capitol recording of \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" the magazine's selection as record of the year. Davis recorded it under a deal paying him $50 a side for each recording.\n\nDuring the next two years, the trio appeared with headliners such as Mickey Rooney, Sinatra and Bob Hope. Jack Benny later intervened to get them a booking at Ciro's nightclub in Hollywood where they opened for singer Janis Paige. The audience would not let them off—or Paige on—stage. The next night, Paige was the opening act for the Will Mastin Trio.\n\nThe group's later appearance on Eddie Cantor's NBC television show was such a hit that they became the comedian's summer replacement.\n\nBy 1954, when Davis released his first album under a contract to Decca Records, his father and Mastin had become background accompaniment to his soaring performances.\n\nWith Davis as its centerpiece, the trio sold out clubs from Los Angeles to New York, and the group was in constant demand for guest spots on television variety shows.\n\nDavis' on-target impersonations of Jimmy Cagney, Jerry Lewis and Jimmy Stewart were a revelation to audiences who simply had never imagined a black performer being able to so accurately capture a white celebrity's character.\n\nBut it all nearly ended in November, 1954, in a car crash on a stretch of highway between Las Vegas and Los Angeles that cost him his left eye. During his recuperation at a San Bernardino hospital, he said, he began thinking seriously about religion and converted to Judaism.\n\nOnce out of the hospital, he was in even more demand. And contract offers began a steady march upward through five figures for a week's work. In 1956, he made his Broadway debut in \"Mr. Wonderful,\" a musical comedy created for him.\n\nBy the late 1950s, the Will Mastin Trio had broken up, but Davis continued dividing his income with his father and uncle for months—some friends say years.\n\nHe became a member of Hollywood's so-called \"Rat Pack\" and made six of his 23 movies with them, beginning with \"Ocean's Eleven\" in 1960 and ending with \"One More Time\" in 1970.\n\nAfter a brief marriage to dancer Loray White in 1959, Davis married Swedish actress May Britt in 1960. The couple had a daughter, Tracey, and adopted two sons, Mark and Jeff. The couple divorced in 1968, and two years later Davis married dancer Altovise Gore. They adopted a son, Manny, last year.\n\nDuring his marriage to Britt, his celebrity could not shield him from white anger and black consternation.\n\nDavis noted in an interview with Playboy magazine that his mother was Puerto Rican.\n\n\"So I'm Puerto Rican, Jewish, colored and married to a white woman,\" he said. \"When I move into a neighborhood, people start running four ways at the same time.\"\n\nHe was bitterly criticized in 1972, during the Republican National Convention in Miami, for hugging Richard M. Nixon. To many black Americans, the photo of that incident was eloquent testimony to what they saw as Davis' misplaced values.\n\nThat criticism, however, wasn't as painful as the rejection that came his way from John F. Kennedy, whose candidacy he had tirelessly supported.\n\nDavis had been invited to Kennedy's 1961 inauguration, but the invitation was rescinded a few days after it was offered because the Kennedy camp felt Davis and his white wife might anger Southerners.\n\n\"The guy I ran with is the man that told me, 'Don't come to the White House cause you'll embarrass me' because I was married to a white woman,\" Davis said in a 1987 interview. \"And I had to accept that. But that was the man I campaigned for, and went all out for. That was John Kennedy.\"\n\nBy now Davis was a fixture in the firmament of American stars. Before his \"Rat Pack\" movies, he had appeared in \"The Benny Goodman Story,\" co-starred with Eartha Kitt in \"Anna Lucasta\" and won rave notices as Sportin' Life in the film version of \"Porgy and Bess.\"\n\nHe returned to the stage in the mid-1960s in a musical adaptation of Clifford Odets' \"Golden Boy,\" a production that ran for 568 performances before closing in March, 1966.\n\nDavis, meanwhile, had remained busy in films, producing the forgettable \"A Man Called Adam\" with his own company in 1966. He also appeared as revivalist Big Daddy in \"Sweet Charity\" and performed in the 1972 documentary \"Save the Children.\"\n\nWhile moving between stage, television and movies, Davis also recorded dozens of albums and released several hit singles, including his all-time top-seller, \"Candy Man.\"\n\nHis was a familiar face in America's living rooms as he turned up on television in shows ranging from \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" to \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\" to the soap opera \"One Life to Live.\" He hosted several specials of his own, sat in for Johnny Carson and did the brief and ill-fated \"Sammy Davis Jr. Show\" on NBC from 1965 to 1966.\n\nHe was a smash hit in \"Sammy,\" a television retrospective of his first half-century in show business. But his second try at a network show, \"NBC Follies,\" was canceled midway through the 1973-74 season.\n\nLast year he published a second biography, Why Me?, co-written, as was his best-selling first book, with Jane and Burt Boyar. In interviews discussing the new book, he acknowledged that racial prejudice had profoundly affected him.\n\nHe poignantly told a story of a man coming to his table at a nightclub to greet him after he had become an international celebrity. The man was the very person who had refused him admission to the same club some years before.\n\nHe felt he should have told the man \"to get away from me with his hypocrisy.\" But he was silent.\n\n\"So I went home and threw up,\" he said. \"I had stifled my own feelings and made myself sick. That night I vowed: 'I'll never let that happen again.' \"\n\nHe said he began to fight the subtle prejudices he encountered, whether it was fellow board members of a company being surprised that he could do more than sing and dance, or making it clear to guests at a party that he could talk about more than what Carson or Sinatra are \"really like.\"\n\nStill, by his own admission, he had mellowed in the last five years.\n\nHe overcame what he called his obsession with his career even as he was being increasingly called upon to accept yet another honor for his body of work or for his commitment to various social and political causes.\n\n\"I've been looking inward,\" he said last year. \"I've been counting my blessings. I no longer feel I have to do it all. I don't yearn to be at the top of the mountain.\"\n\nDavis is survived by his wife, four children and two grandchildren. His mother and a sister also survive. Services are scheduled at 11 a.m. Friday at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, Hollywood Hills. Burial will follow at Forest Lawn, Glendale.\n\nThe family suggested that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Sammy Davis Jr. National Liver Institute at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark.\n\nTimes staff writer Eric Malnic contributed to this obituary.\n\nNote: most sources confirm his death as on 18 May 2017."
