This wlU bo extended northerly to the exist- ing 12-lncii mam on Henderson Road, and the new 13-lach main oo Lansdowne Road will be extended easterly to Cadboro Bay Road. This to expected to Improve present con- ditions in Uieae areas, and will fit In to the eventual picture of a large mam feeding into Oak Bay at Lana- downe and Foul Bay Roads. !

Because of the greatly-increased building In Oak Bay. new pumpa are being Installed for elevating sewage in the vklntty of Windsor Park. These will be In full operation before the coming Winter. New sewera and storm water drains are being Installed by contract on tarkedowne R«tod. GROrVDS Sl'RVKTED The bouridarlea of the first group of lots ki the exhibition grounds area ha* . been surveyed, and very shortly tlte individual lota win be marked out. Certain sonlng problems in this area hare been put up to the Town Planning Commission for re- port. following which prloes wlU be fixed on these lota. Eighteen lots have been stirveyed on AUenby Street and are now available for sale to the public. The extotlng park areas will all be well maintained, and certain ad- ditional ptoyground equipment pur- chased. and work done on the munlrlpally-owned area on Qulmper BtreeU Survey plans have been approved for the final units of the Hudaon's Bay subdivision on Lansdowne Road. A drive down Westdowa Road will give Oak Bay resldenta an Idea of this whole eventuill development, which to particularly attractive eveti now because of the absence of poles on the streK, and the pleasing curves of the subdivision which enhance the natural slope the ground, givinf each property an excellent new. AREA nrVELOPMrNTR It to hoped the exhtbUlon gr'^uiids area wUl also be devek^>ed without poles on the sUeeta, using back line easements, a* wUl, In addition, the futur# eubdlvtoion of the land )>mg north of lAnadovne Road. It to fmanclally out of the question at present to make any effort to removs poles from the old-estab- halted streets of Oak Bay. This wlU entail new wiring mto the back uf every mdlvidual home, and the erection of poles m positions on the bark of the lots which will be most Inacceaslble now thdt the properties art buUt up. In years to come the municlpai engineer said it to posslbk that more tcnnomlcal underground wiring may be available. Removal of poles from all streets would be an n^opous step forward tn the beautification of Oak Bay. he stated. Referring to the number of new attractive apartments built lu Oak Bay m the last year. Mr. Musgrave explained that the area for rurther buUdlng of such alructuras has been carefully toned so as not to Interfere m any way with the ordinary resi- dential districts.

This la precisely what the Doukhobor fanatics want, attention and lots of it. Tlie pity is that as a remedy the opera- tion proved a distinguished failure years ago. Their sojourn on Piers Island turned out to be a Joy-ride for the fanatics and a sorry bill of expense for the Crown. the same mistake have to be made twice over? When will wp leeni to Ignore thp disrobing and shephprd thp madmen back onto their reservations with good atout base! switches? If there are known arson- ists they can be tried and dealt with as such. But this gi^g In to the aim of the fanatical sect by a great hue and cry over Iheir revolt, standing by with blankets to cover them and ail the rest of it. is a sorry play indeed. Outside of the odd hard case, the majority of the men and women in trouble at Krestova now would be fit subjects for a psychiatric ward, rather than a Jail. It is no solution to arrest scores of the Sons of Freedom, tag them as criminals, and colonise them again in improvised jails at Vernon or elsewhere. When it Is ^ over and done with they will have to be freed, and the old game will start again precisely where it left off. Long ago the Dominion should have assumed Its real responsibilities in the matter — the Sons of Freedom are not true colonists In Canada and never will be. ITie case is one for the immigration authori- ties and for the psychiatrists if there is to be any lasting solution RpHfrfj^aniutlion of ihe Lnitetl ^aiionn IT was almost a forgone conclusion that some authoritative world figure would eventually urge the reorganization of the United Nations with Russia and her Communist satellites being left out. The lack of unity displayed in the world body during the past five years should remove any aspect of surprise over the proposal advanced last week by former United States President Hoover. This new.ipaper Itself suggested two years ago that if the United Nations idea would not work because of Rn.ssian intransigence perhaps it might be a good thing if the Soviet state withdrew. Mr. Hoover says publicly now that it would. Ideals are not of much value unless they can be translated into practice, and the ideals that gave birth to the United Na- tions organization five years ago have been sadly frustrated. On all major points the veto has reduced the United Nations to im- potence, Had there been no veto privilege there would have been no original Russian participation, but it has become clear this device has been misused by Russia for one purpose only, and that foreign to the hopes that permitted it. There seems little use in perpetuating the present helplessness of a world group created to bring order and peace into the world. Exclusion of Soviet Russia and her puppet states would, as Mr. Hoover points out. offi- cially divide the world into two groups, but that would change nothing since in actual fact the world is at present so divided. The United Nations ctmld then proceed to adjust numerous matters within its realm that Russian membersl^p enables the latter to block. There is also vital import in the fact that such a division of the United Na- tions would consolidate In positive fashion all nations opposed to the insidious spread of subversive Ru.ssian influence. Such com- pact unity might indeed be. the very thing to cause Russia to pause, reflect and change her ways. It seems as though nothing else wUI. Judicial Supfsestion Worthy of Note Mr. Justice O'Halloran’j suggestions on the subject of places of confine- ment for young offenders merit con- sideration by those responsible for policies of correction In this province. In His Lord- ship's view the gap between New Haven and the penitentiary is too wide, and there should be an intermediate Institution. Pre- sumably this would be for youths deemed fit subjects for Borstal training but unsuit- able for New Haven, with its absence of locks, bars, prison walls or other visible evidences of physical restraint. The com- ment was prompted by the cases of two 18-year-old lads who escaped from New Haven. The problem of combining punishment with rehabilitation in useful citizenship for those who go wrong on the threshold of manhood has long been receiving close at tentlon by provincial penal authorities. Although it has been m operation lor some time. New Haven itself is still in the experi- mental stage. It is a place of training for youths too old for the Juvenile corrective institutions, too young and pliable for ex- posure to the prison Influence of hardened criminals, dope peddlers and the like. Escapes from New Haven have been sur- prisingly few BO far; but there have been enough to support Mr. Justice O’Ualloran's reference to the need for a \"closed\" interme- diate institution, in the absence of which those who do make a bid for freedom usually end up in Oakalla or the penitentiar>'.

I shall quote you in part what one of the characters, a “Diana Amber- ley,” aays In a letter to the hero of the story. She has been vislUng America and Canada and la somewhere out in the Georgia Strait when she wrrlles: “1 have been over to the island of Victoria off the Pacific Coast of Can- ada. a day's Journey by boat from Vancouver. They were very kind to me, but sometimes I doubt whether in Victoria they have ever heard of the First World War: 1 am sure they have never heard of the Second.

Eren the newspaper in Victoria Island Is called ‘The Daily Coloniat,’ as if cveryorte there remained unaware that Canada had become a great Dominion.\" Interesting. Isn't tt? I have a feeling I should drop the author a nice, friendly little note, something along the following lines: ewe Dear Mr Evans. I hope you wont mind U 1 differ gently from the Hews you make Diana expound about Victoria. I am inclined to ^Ink she must have been aeaalek whM she wrote to the anonymous hero of your latest book. I won’t go deeply into the history of the First World War, since 1 did not live here then and It Is rather ancient history now in any cvenL Pethapa I should say, however, that on record is the fact that Victoria raised several battalions for sennee in France, that Royal Navy ahips limped into the ad- jacent naval port of Eaquimalt and that many men stood guard at big fixed guns lest Von Bpee or some other unwelcome German might pay Vic- toria an unauthoiixed visit. Oh. yes. and I should mention that a regiment connected with Victoria won four Vic- toria Crosses. As I say I wasn't here. Mr. Evans, but I have a feeling from this evidence alone that Victorians must have had the even tenor of their ways at least slightly disturbed. Regarding the Second World War. I am on a bit stronger ground than Diana seems lo have been, seeing that I had by then moved to the city she found so unsatisfactory 1 have no wish to bore you but per- haps you will bear with me while 1 recite briefly a few facta and figures. In the Second World War more than 700 Victoria and Vancouver Island men died on active servlet. Victorians served on every battlefront. oo land, at sea and In the air. The people of this city subscribed g90.N?,700 In seven victory loans, not to speak of two other war loans and coonUets war savings ceritficatef. Victoria sent $74 .ZU to London to the Lord Mayor’s Fund. It also sent 74 tons of clothing to Britain and 350.01)0 quarts of milk to British children. Nearly 7,000 men and women enrolled for civil defence. Two ahlpyardi buUt 53 warshlpa and large freighters as well as numerous •mailer craft. No fewer than 415.500 aenrleemen and women walked Its •LreeU on their way to civic sponsored entertainments. This city your Diana disparages did many other things during ihe war that I could cite, bat I feel sure you will agree now that with all Uiese happenings It Is highly doubtful* that Victoria could be unaware there was a war on. Yes. Mr. Evans, Diana was c<»Tect in saying that the newspaper here - although actually there are two— 1s named The Dally Colonist.’ It Is called that for the same reason that the King stops at Temple Bar when he Gdes Into the City of London ~\\t has always been that way. But since this newspaper has been reporting for BO years the eiecUoo of Victoria members to the paritament of the Dominion of Canada, you can assure Diana that we all know that Canada is a Domin- ion She need have no regreta on that score Jusl one thing more Obviously you are Interestod In history so perhaps you have an equal liking for geogra- phy. In which ease I’m sure the Brit- ish Museum would be glad to lend you a map so you may note that Vic- toria is a city on an Island called Vancouver Island. It may be a sur- veyor’s oversight but, alas, there is no Vlelorla Xaland Forgive my raialni this small point, and aleo menuoning tlial a mere four bom took Diana acroaa to Vancouver.

From the Press Gallery Car Observation By G. B. By I RED McNEIl. V^HEN the books of British Colum- ^ bia history are written a few years hence, the decade following the war may be known as the greatest era of road building since pack trails wrere first hewn out 100 years ago. Perhaps the learned gentlemen who write such books will show how the great new road network sparked a tremendous surge of development Perhaps time, which so often makes statesmen mt at pottttctani. wttt shroud the politicians of this decade with a halo of vision and courage. Or. again, the politicians may be condemned as crasy spendthrifts, who committed British Columbia's mllUon- odd people to fabulous expendltuxes on rosy dreams of the future. In either case the hiatorlans would be wrong. The cry for better roads has come from the grass roots, from the sage brush country, the logging towns, the mines, from the roiling cattle country of the Cariboo, from the vast landlocked plains of the Peace River where peoplg dream of a great empire, and from a thou.sand fertile valleys lacking only ready ac- cess to market. And when the members of the Leg- islature meet each year, the demand for more and better roads Is the main theme of every .speech. As a result British Columbia is sail- ing cloae to the wind financially, add- ing huge sums for roads to already heavy costs for education and social services. Much has done al- ready. And present plans call for $03,000,000 of provincial money in the next seven years, plus $30,000,000 from Ottawa^all for roads and bridges. * * w When the Job is done the Island Highway will be completely rebuilt from Douglas Street to Campbell River and beyond, with a spur to Port Al- beml. A 34-foot paved highway will run 700 miles from Vancouver via the Fraser Canyon and the Big Bend to the Alberta border Along the aouih- em route, where the 53-mlle eection punched through the mountains from Hope to Princeton cuts lOO miles of travel from the route to the Coast, the blacktop wlU be pushed from Oka- nagan to the Kootonays and beyond and, at the same time, link BrlUah Columbia with the American highway system. From the head of the Fraser Can- yon, the paving machines, already inching northward, will travel to Prince George, forming the backbone of north-south communications. From Prince George the $15,000,000 Hart Highway will snake through the mountains to the Peace River. Hun- dreds of feeder roads will be Improved to form the branches of these main arteries. ’The effect of such a network in de- veloping British Columbia will be tre- mendous. More than any other prov- ince. British Columbia must depend on truck-borne transport, because here few branch lines radiate out from the railroads. For the first time this province will be able to take full advantage of Its fabulous tourlsl resources. eat The man directly in charge of tliu huge undertaking is Works Minister S. C. ’’Emle\" Carson, tall. lean, soft- spoken ons-Ume cowboy, who grew up on his father's big ranch at Pavilion.
