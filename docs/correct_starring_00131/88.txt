Brian O’Halloran (birthname: Brian Christopher O’Halloran) is a comic actor best known as playing Dante Hicks in writer-director Kevin Smith’s Clerks movie franchise and Smith’s extended View Askewniverse, including his debut in Clerks (1994), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), Clerks II (2006), Jay and Silent Bob Reboot (2019), and Clerks III (2022).

O’Halloran has also played Dante’s brothers in various View Askewniverse movies, including Gill Hicks in Smith’s second feature, Mallrats (1995), with Shannen Doherty, Jason Lee, Claire Forlani, Ben Affleck, and Michael Rooker; as Jim Hicks (identified as Exec #1) in Smith’s third feature, Chasing Amy (1997), with Joey Lauren Adams, Affleck, Lee, and Jason Mewes; as Grant Hicks in Smith’s next film, Dogma (1999), with Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek, Lee, Bud Cort, Mewes, Alan Rickman, and Chris Rock; and again as Grant (as well as Dante) in Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, with Mewes, Smith, Lee, Adams, and Shannon Elizabeth.

In a further angle inside the world of Clerks, O’Halloran portrayed the character of Elis in a comedy-drama about the making of the original Clerks, titled Shooting Clerks (2016), which blended mostly unknown actors portraying real-life figures (such as Smith) and the actual Clerks actors appearing in cameo roles.
