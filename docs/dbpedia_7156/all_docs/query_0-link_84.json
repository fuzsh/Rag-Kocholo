        "text": "If you’re a parent, you’ll be well-acquainted with one of the more hotly debated parenting topics: screen time and kids.\n\nOn the one hand, screen time helps kids learn, develop creativity and supports social interaction and connection.\n\nBut too much screen time can negatively impact your child – not just their development but their physical health, too.\n\nSo how exactly does screen time impact your child’s physical health? And how can you help them develop a positive relationship with screens?\n\nHow much screen time is OK?\n\nThe Australian guidelines for screen time are part of its 24-hour movement guidelines. These prescribe the amount of time we should spend each day on physical activity, sleep and screen time to maintain physical and mental health and wellbeing.\n\nThe screen time guidelines, which are based on seated activity, recommend:\n\nno screen time for children under two\n\nno more than one hour of screen time for children aged two to five\n\nno more than two hours of recreational screen time outside of school work from the age of five to 17.\n\nBut just 17% to 23% of Australian pre-schoolers and 15% of 5 to 12-year-olds meet these recommendations.\n\nHow screen time affects kids’ diets and health\n\nChildren with higher screen time are more likely to engage in mindless eating and overeating. When they’re distracted by screens, kids can miss important signals from their brains letting them know they’re full.\n\nThey’re also more likely to crave and eat unhealthier foods. This is driven, in part, by junk food advertising accompanying children’s content on screens.\n\nThe lesser-known way too much screen time affects a child’s diet is by impacting their sleep. For children and adolescents, adequate sleep is:\n\n11 to 14 hours, including naps, for toddlers\n\n10 to 13 hours, including naps, for three-to five-year-olds\n\nnine to 11 hours for kids aged five to 13\n\neight to ten hours for teenagers.\n\nResearch shows a child’s ability to get adequate sleep is impacted by screen time. A review of 67 studies of school-aged children and adolescents found screen time was associated with shorter and later sleep in 90% of the studies reviewed.\n\nWe need adequate sleep to regulate two essential hormones – ghrelin and leptin – that manage our hunger and appetite. Getting less than our recommended sleep disrupts our appetite hormones, resulting in an increased desire to eat.\n\nIt also leads to increased impulsive behaviour linked to food choices, which often results in us reaching for foods high in sugar, fats and salt for immediate gratification. So if your child is not getting the sleep they need, there’s a good chance they’ll be using their pester power to satisfy their craving for sugary, fatty and salty foods the next day.\n\nFinally, more time indoors looking at screens can mean less time being physically active. Australia’s guidelines recommend children do at least 60 minutes each day of physical activity that makes the heart beat faster (or at least one hour of “energetic play” for pre-schoolers). The 60 minutes doesn’t have to be all in one go – it can be made up of several shorter sessions through the day.\n\nWhat can parents do?\n\nFortunately, there are some practical steps you can take to ensure your child has a healthy relationship with screens and ensure they’re getting enough sleep and physical activity.\n\n1. Establish screen time rules\n\nConsider guidelines for your child’s age and cover expectations for where, when and how screens are used. Young kids playing an educational game on a tablet in the family room might be OK, while watching YouTube in the bedroom might not.\n\nMake mealtimes and the bedroom at bedtime screen-free zones. Involve your children, particularly teenagers, in the process to ensure everyone follows the rules.\n\n2. Spend time outdoors\n\nTry establishing regular time in your family’s schedule for physical activity outdoors, whether a daily visit to the park or sports on the weekend. Making sure your child gets enough physical activity daily also supports their sleep and overall health.\n\nLike rule-setting, involving your child in the activity choice will make them more willing to participate.\n\n3. Be a role model\n\nKids closely observe and mimic their parents, so the best way to ensure your child has healthy screen time habits is to adopt them yourself. Apply rules to your own screen use at home, including being mindful of being distracted by never-ending notifications.\n\n4. Make your child’s bedroom a sleep sanctuary\n\nEnsuring your child’s bedroom is quiet, comfortable and dark enough is essential for a good night’s sleep. This includes being at a comfortable temperature (18°C to 22°C). Store toys and screens in other rooms so your child associates their bedroom with sleep time, not playtime."
