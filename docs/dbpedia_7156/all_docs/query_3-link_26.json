        "text": "Biliary atresia is a disease of the bile ducts that affects only infants. Bile is a digestive liquid that is made in the liver. It travels through the bile ducts to the small intestine, where it helps digest fats.\n\nIn biliary atresia, the bile ducts become inflamed and blocked soon after birth. This causes bile to remain in the liver, where it starts to destroy liver cells rapidly and cause cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver.\n\nFacts at-a-Glance\n\nBiliary Atresia is a rare disease affecting 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 18,000 live births worldwide. About 10-20% of infants with biliary atresia have abnormalities in other organs, such as heart defects or issues with their spleen.\n\nBiliary Atresia only occurs in newborn infants. The disease is slightly more common in female infants and in infants with Asian or African American heritage.\n\nInformation for the Newly Diagnosed\n\nWhat causes biliary atresia?\n\nThe cause of this disease is not known. In some infants, the condition is most likely congenital, meaning present from birth. About one in 10 babies with biliary atresia have other congenital defects. Some research indicates that an early viral infection may be linked to biliary atresia.\n\nScientists do know that biliary atresia is not hereditary; parents do not pass it on to their child. It is also not contagious, and it is not preventable. It is also not caused by anything an expectant mother did or did not do.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of biliary atresia?\n\nSymptoms of biliary atresia usually appear between two and six weeks after birth. The baby will appear jaundiced, with yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. The liver may harden and the abdomen may become swollen. Stools appear pale grey and the urine may appear dark. Some babies may develop intense itching.\n\nHow is biliary atresia diagnosed?\n\nSince other conditions lead to symptoms similar to those of biliary atresia, doctors must perform many tests before a conclusive diagnosis can be made. These tests may include blood and liver tests, an ultrasound examination, X-rays and a liver biopsy, in which a small amount of liver tissue is removed with a needle for examination in a laboratory.\n\nHow is biliary atresia treated?\n\nWatch this video on the Kasai Procedure.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for biliary atresia. The only treatment is a surgical procedure in which the blocked bile ducts outside the liver are replaced with a length of the baby’s own intestine, which acts as a new duct. This surgery is called the Kasai procedure after Dr. Morio Kasai, the Japanese surgeon who developed it.\n\nThe aim of the Kasai procedure is to allow drainage of bile from the liver into the intestine through the new duct. The operation is completely or partially successful about 80 percent of the time if performed early (before 3 months of age). In babies who respond well, jaundice and other symptoms usually disappear after several weeks.\n\nIn cases where the Kasai procedure does not work, the problem often lies in the fact that blocked bile ducts are “intrahepatic,” or inside the liver, as well as extrahepatic, or outside the liver. No procedure, except for liver transplant, has been developed to replace blocked intrahepatic ducts.\n\nThe Kasai procedure is most successful in babies younger than 3-months-old, so early diagnosis is important.\n\nIf the Kasai procedure is not successful, the only other option is a liver transplant. However, a suitable donor organ must be found quickly, before damage to the liver from the backed-up bile becomes deadly.\n\nWhat happens after surgery?\n\nThe aim of treatment after surgery is to encourage normal growth and development. If bile flow is good, the child is given a regular diet. If tests show that bile flow is reduced, a low-fat diet and vitamin supplements will be required, since the absorption of fats and vitamins is impaired.\n\nWhat happens to children with biliary atresia?\n\nWithout successful treatment, few children with biliary atresia live beyond age two. In some cases, where the Kasai procedure is completely successful, the child may recover and live a normal life. However, in most cases, even when surgery is successful, patients will suffer gradual damage to the liver. These children will need specialized medical care throughout their lives, and many will ultimately need a liver transplant.\n\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\n\nHave you ever treated any other patients with biliary atresia before?\n\nHave blood tests be performed to look at my bilirubin levels?\n\nWhat is the status of my child’s liver?\n\nDoes my child have liver damage?\n\nWill my child need a liver transplant?\n\n(If transplant is an option) Would it be best to pursue a living donation (from a friend or family member) or would we to wait for a deceased donor?\n\nWhat transplant hospitals are there in my state/UNOS region?\n\nWill the Kasai Procedure be needed to be done?\n\nHas the provider doing this procedure done this on many other patients?\n\nIs there any medication that can help with the portal hypertension?\n\nIs there any medication that can help with the pruritis?\n\nBiliary Atresia Support Group\n\nJoin the American Liver Foundation's supportive community for those affected by Biliary Atresia (BA). It is open to anyone connected to BA around the country. This community serves as a space to feel less alone, seek answers to your questions and find the strength for another day! It also allows you to stay updated with our webinar series and other special programs.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/alf.ba.families\n\nVideo Library\n\nFact Sheet\n\nTitleLinkBiliary Atresia Fact Sheet\n\nSearch for a Clinical Trial\n\nClinical trials are research studies that test how well new medical approaches work in people. Before an experimental treatment can be tested on human subjects in a clinical trial, it must have shown benefit in laboratory testing or animal research studies. The most promising treatments are then moved into clinical trials, with the goal of identifying new ways to safely and effectively prevent, screen for, diagnose, or treat a disease.\n\nSpeak with your doctor about the ongoing progress and results of these trials to get the most up-to-date information on new treatments. Participating in a clinical trial is a great way to contribute to curing, preventing and treating liver disease and its complications."
