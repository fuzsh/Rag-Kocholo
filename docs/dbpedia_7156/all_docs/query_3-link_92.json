        "text": "2.2.1Risks factors associated with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality\n\nIn a study published by Huang Q et al. [37] with 12,480 individuals, it was observed that MAFLD increased the overall risk for total mortality to a greater magnitude than NAFLD [Hazard ratio (HR) 2.07 vs. 1.47]. However, the difference was non-significant after metabolic parameters were adjusted. Risks for cardiovascular, neoplasm and diabetes-related mortality were similar between MAFLD and NAFLD. Referring to individuals without both NAFLD and MAFLD, individuals with only MAFLD independently increased the risk for total mortality [adjusted HR (aHR) 1.47] and neoplasm mortality (aHR 1.58).\n\nIn a study published by Kim D et al. [38] with 7761 individuals, it was observed that during a median follow-up of 23 years, individuals with MAFLD had a 17% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.17). Furthermore, MAFLD was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. NAFLD per se did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality. Individuals who met both definitions had higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.13), while individuals who met the definition for MAFLD but not NAFLD had a 1.7-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.66). Estimates for all-cause mortality were higher for those with advanced fibrosis and MAFLD than for those with advanced fibrosis and NAFLD.\n\nIn a very recently published study by Younossi ZM et al. [40] with 12,878 individuals followed for a median of 23 years, this group investigated a wide range of clinically relevant predictors of mortality. It was observed that insulin resistance (IR) and high-risk fibrosis were significantly increased risks for cardiac specific mortality among the NAFLD+ (HR 1.83 and 1.91, respectively) but not among the MAFLD+ (HR 1.36 95% CI 0.99–1.86 and HR 1.43 95% CI 0.93–2.19, respectively).\n\nRegarding liver-specific mortality, the top three risk factors significantly associated among the MAFLD+ were high-risk fibrosis (HR 17.15), ALD (HR 4.50), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR 2.92). In contrast, among NAFLD+, the top three risk factors were high-risk fibrosis (HR 9.26), high C-reactive protein (HR 4.47), and IR (HR 3.57). In fact, IR, a hallmark of metabolic abnormality, was not a predictor of liver mortality among MAFLD patients.\n\nMortality combining MAFLD and NAFLD definitions yielded the following results: the MAFLD+ had a 97% higher increased risk for all-cause mortality than the MAFLD-, whereas the NAFLD+ had a 67% higher risk for all-cause mortality than the NAFLD-. However, when ALD was added to the multivariable model, the MAFLD+ had no longer a significant risk for all-cause mortality, suggesting that the association between MAFLD and mortality was mediated by ALD (defined as ALT levels >40 U/L or AST levels >37 U/L in males, ALT or AST >31 U/L in females or fatty liver disease and excessive alcohol consumption). Of 70 deaths related to liver disease, 23 occurred in individuals with ALD (MAFLD+/NAFLD-) and the remaining 47 occurred in patients with (MAFLD+/NAFLD+).\n\nThe above discussed studies suggest that: a) the definition of MAFLD is associated with higher mortality than NAFLD when both are compared with individuals without either of these definitions. However, when both conditions are compared to each other, MAFLD is associated with higher mortality; b). In both MAFLD and NAFLD conditions, fibrosis is a risk factor for all-cause mortality and specific mortality to a greater degree in MAFLD. However, it is important to note that metabolic dysregulation parameters (such as IR) were associated with cardiovascular disease mortality in NAFLD but not in MAFLD. Conversely, in relation to mortality associated with liver disease, metabolic parameters were more relevant in NAFLD, while in MAFLD alcohol explained a large percentage of the deaths (approximately 32%) [40]. The potential negative impact of alcohol on MAFLD outcomes may explain the increase in the percentages of death from all causes and from specific causes, particularly hepatic. Therefore, metabolic abnormalities that should be the main incentive to change the name from NAFLD to MAFLD were not independently associated with mortality among patients with MAFLD. In support of this, a recently published study by van Kleef LA et al.[42] with 12,656 patients showed that both MAFLD and alcohol abuse (defined as an intake >10 g/d for women and >20 g/d for men) were independently and simultaneously associated with increased risk of death in models with full adjustment (aHR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.30 and aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04–1.26, respectively). Similarly, MAFLD was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with and without excessive alcohol consumption. Participants with both conditions (MAFLD and excessive alcohol consumption), which accounted for 4% of all individuals, had the highest risk of death. This indicates that excessive alcohol intake may exert a synergistic effect on the risk of mortality in patients with MAFLD.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the clinical evidence known so far previously discussed in this text, has been generated in studies with different methodological designs, patients' characteristics, clinical settings, methods for detecting FLD (ultrasonography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging and liver biopsy) and markers of liver fibrosis (non-invasive methods and liver biopsy) which may explain some differences in results among them."
