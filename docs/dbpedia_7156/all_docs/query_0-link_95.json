        "text": "Growing long, beautiful locks is every woman’s dream. Likely, you’ve seen countless videos across social platforms about the benefits of hair oil.. But with so many to choose from, how do you know which hair oils are best for growth and thickness?\n\nNo need to waste time trying to get down to the bottom of it! Today, we’re taking a deep dive into the best hair oils for growth and thickness… and how to use them!\n\nWhich Oil Is Best for Hair Growth and Thickness?\n\nThere are 10 hair oils that really stand out when it comes to growing longer, thicker locks. So, which hair oil is best for growth and thickness? Each one has unique properties that offer different benefits. Let’s take a look!\n\n1. Argan Oil\n\nArgan oil is one of the best hair oils for growth. That is because it is incredibly rich in Vitamin E and fatty acids. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect the hair from free radicals and damaging environmental factors.\n\nArgan oil helps both protect our hair and also promote a healthy scalp. The fatty acids in argan oil also help to improve hair elasticity which prevents breakage and split ends. Elasticity is crucial when we’re trying to grow longer, healthier hair.\n\n2. Coconut Oil\n\nCoconut oil is an ideal choice for hair growth thanks to its ability to penetrate the hair shaft and reduce protein loss while adding extra moisture. It allows the cuticles to absorb nutrients more easily, which leads to stronger strands.\n\nBut one of the most important aspects of coconut oil is the lauric acid. Lauric acid has antifungal properties that fight hair issues like dandruff and a flaky scalp. This leads to, ultimately, a healthier scalp. Those who incorporate coconut oil into their haircare routine will notice visibly softer and shinier hair.\n\n3. Rosemary Oil\n\nRosemary oil doesn’t get as much attention as some of our other recommendations but has become increasingly popular. And for good reason! Rosemary oil has been scientifically proven to stimulate hair growth from the base of the hair follicle.\n\nLike coconut oil, it also has the ability to address dandruff concerns and promote a healthier scalp, which is essential for healthy hair growth. But one of the most interesting properties is that it has the potential to prevent any premature gray hairs. This is because it inhibits the production of a hormone called DHT. DHT is often associated with hair thinning and premature gray hair.\n\n4. Jojoba Oil\n\nYou may not have heard of this oil before, but Jojoba oil comes from the seeds of the Jojoba plant. The interesting part of jojoba oil is that it mimics the same oil we produce naturally. Incorporating jojoba oil into your routine leaves you with hair that feels moisturized hair but not greasy.\n\nBecause of this result, jojoba hair oil is great for preventing breakage and split ends when you’re trying to grow out your hair.\n\n5. Olive Oil\n\nThe benefits of olive oil for healthy hair oil shouldn’t be underestimated. Olive oil is incredibly rich in Omega 3’s and other important fatty acids with strong antioxidant benefits. This leaves our hair stronger and better protected against environmental debris and damage.\n\nOlive oil can also be a quick and easy fix when your hair is feeling dull. It instantly adds shine and moisture, which is why it also prevents breakage.\n\n6. Castor Oil\n\nCastor oil has something unique to offer! This oil contains ricinoleic acid, which has a direct impact on hair growth. This acid promotes blood flow and circulation, so upon massaging it in, hair growth is stimulated in that area.\n\nAs a double benefit, the blood circulation produced by massaging the oil into your scalp further promotes growth and a stronger hair shaft as the nutrients are absorbed right at the base. As a cherry on top, it also helps combat tough scalp conditions such as dandruff!\n\n7. Almond Oil\n\nAlmond oil is sweet and can leave a soft scent, but it does much more than that. High levels of Vitamin E work to nourish and strengthen the hair. When you apply Vitamin E directly onto the scalp with an oil such as almond oil, you’ll notice reduced hair fall leading to thicker hair.\n\n8. Avocado Oil\n\nAvocado oil is great for anyone who feels like their hair is constantly tangled and knotted. It’s rich in monounsaturated fats, which is a superpower for nourishing and softening the hair. For those who have more coarse or drier hair, avocado oil is a great addition.\n\n9. Grapeseed Oil\n\nGrapeseed oil is every girl’s best friend because it’s a lightweight solution for all hair types. It’s rich in antioxidants that promote overall hair health and score 10s around the board. One of the best things about this particular hair oil is that it helps reduce frizz in staticky or humid climates.\n\n10. Tea Tree Oil\n\nLast but certainly not least on our list is tea tree oil. Tea tree oil is known for its calming and soothing effects, and it’s no different for our scalp. The power of tea tree oil lies in its ability to unclog the scalp and stimulate growth. This leaves us with a healthy scalp that is free of dandruff and other debris.\n\nWays to Use Hair Oil for Growth and Thickness\n\nKnowing what to use is one thing. Knowing how to use them is the real game-changer! Let’s explore some effective ways to seamlessly integrate these lush oils into your hair care routine.\n\nOn Your Scalp Treatment\n\nA quality scalp treatment, like Gisou’s Honey Infused Scalp Treatment, will help to restore your hair starting at the root. Packed with rosemary oil and Gisou’s signature Mirsalehi oil blend, it boosts hydration, circulation, and hair growth.\n\nApply and leave it on for 5-7 minutes for immediate benefits! Use it twice a week for dry and irritated scalps, or twice a month for preventative care.\n\nAdded to Your Deep Conditioning Hair Mask\n\nA good hair mask conditioning treatment can restore so much life back into our locks. But sometimes our hair is extra dry. Combining Gisou’s Honey Infused Hair Mask with a few drops of hair oil can be a great solution!\n\nOur hair mask already contains coconut oil to leave the hair hydrated and so soft to the touch. It also makes for a great scent combined with its special honey mixture. Since using a hair mask once or twice a week is recommended, you’ll want to consider what your hair needs at that moment.\n\nAs a Stand-Alone Oil Treatment\n\nUsing hair oil as a stand-alone treatment is also an excellent way to promote hair health. Gisou’s Honey Infused Hair Oil works both as an overnight option and as a pre-shower fix. The longer you give your hair to absorb the nutrients, the more benefits you’ll see.\n\nAnd the ingredient list is strong. You’ll get the best of everything as it contains honey for ultimate antioxidant repair, coconut oil to nourish, and sweet almond oil for a boost of Vitamin E. This is what helps prevent breakage and leads to long, luxurious locks.\n\nUse a Hair Repair Serum\n\nFor hair that’s had a rough go, a hair repair serum can be an excellent solution. Gisou’s Honey Infused Hair Repair Serum contains many of the best hair oils for growth and covers breakage from every angle. Combining their oils with the protein Keratin strengthens the hair so it can grow long and thick.\n\nKeratin is the natural protein that makes up the base of our hair strands. Incorporating this into our products boosts lower levels to strengthen dull and weakened hair. It also simultaneously protects our outer layer from any further damage caused by environmental factors or heat.\n\nAs the Last Step in Your Styling Routine\n\nIt’s worth coming back to Gisou’s Honey Infused Hair Oil here because it can be applied daily as the last step in your styling routine. Our hair oil combats frizz and adds an immediate shine for a polished and healthy look\n\nSimply apply a drop or two into your hand and run it through the mid-lengths to the end of your hair. You’ll love the soft and subtle scent that isn’t overpowering yet so complimentary.\n\nElevate Your Hair Care with the Best Hair Oils\n\nIn the pursuit of long, luxurious locks, don’t underestimate the transformative magic of hair oiling. Reaching for your favorite products from Gisou’s Honey and Propolis Hair Care Collection can make an astounding difference in the health and strength of your hair.\n\nOur products offer a seamless way to incorporate the best hair oils for growth into your routine without any extra steps. Incorporate them into your daily routine and watch the transformation unfold!"
