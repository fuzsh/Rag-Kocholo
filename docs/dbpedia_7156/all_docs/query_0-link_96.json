        "text": "Peripheral artery disease is similar to coronary artery disease.\n\nPeripheral artery disease, or PAD, is a circulation problem in the leg. It is a narrowing of the peripheral arteries that carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body. The most common type is lower-extremity PAD, in which blood flow is reduced to the legs and feet. Upper-extremity PAD (arms, hands and fingers) is less common but affects about 10% of the population.\n\nBoth PAD and coronary artery disease are caused by atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries that narrows and blocks them throughout the body, including in the heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis, kidneys and other organs.\n\nQuick facts about PAD\n\nThe most common symptoms of lower-extremity PAD are cramping, fatigue, aching, pain or discomfort in the leg or hip muscles while walking or climbing stairs. This pain usually goes away with rest and returns when you walk again.\n\nBe aware that:\n\nMany people mistake the symptoms of PAD for something else.\n\nPAD often goes undiagnosed by health care professionals.\n\nPeople with PAD have a higher risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack and stroke.\n\nLeft untreated, PAD can lead to gangrene and amputation.\n\nView our interactive PAD library.\n\nAdded risks for PAD\n\nCertain factors increase your chances for peripheral artery disease, including:\n\nOlder age.\n\nHigh blood pressure or high cholesterol\n\nSmoking\n\nType 2 diabetes\n\nNot getting enough physical activity\n\nStress\n\nDiets high in saturated fats\n\nObesity\n\nChronic kidney disease\n\nThe good news\n\nIf you’re at risk or have been diagnosed with PAD:\n\nPAD is diagnosed in a simple, painless way.\n\nYou can take control: Follow your health care professional's recommendations and strive to lead a heart-healthy lifestyle.\n\nSome cases of PAD can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication.\n\nAtherosclerosis and PAD\n\nIf you have atherosclerosis, that means that plaque has built up inside your artery walls. Plaque is made up of deposits of fats, cholesterol and other substances. Atherosclerosis in the peripheral arteries is the most common cause of PAD.\n\nTo see how plaque limits blood flow, view our interactive PAD library.\n\nFirst, plaque builds up enough to narrow an artery, which reduces blood flow. Next, if that plaque becomes brittle or inflamed, it may rupture. This causes a blood clot to form. A clot can further narrow the artery or completely block it.\n\nIf the blockage remains in the peripheral arteries of the legs, it can cause pain, changes in skin color, difficulty walking and sores or ulcers. Total loss of blood flow to the legs and feet can cause gangrene and the loss of a limb.\n\nIf the blockage occurs in a carotid artery, it can cause a stroke.\n\nWatch an atherosclerosis and PAD animation\n\nIt’s important to learn the facts about PAD. The more you understand, the more you can help your health care team make an early diagnosis. PAD has common symptoms, but many people with PAD never have any symptoms.\n\nTalk to your health care team and take control of your cardiovascular health."
