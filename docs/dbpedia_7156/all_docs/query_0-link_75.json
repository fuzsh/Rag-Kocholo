        "text": "Carotid artery surgery - open\n\nCarotid artery surgery is a procedure to treat carotid artery disease.\n\nThe carotid artery brings needed blood to your brain and face. You have one of these arteries on each side of your neck. Blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. This can reduce the blood supply to your brain and cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.\n\nCarotid artery surgery is done to restore proper blood flow to the brain. There are two procedures to treat a carotid artery that has plaque buildup in it. This article focuses on a surgery called carotid endarterectomy. The other method is called angioplasty with stent placement.\n\nDuring carotid endarterectomy:\n\nYou receive general anesthesia. You are asleep and pain free. Some hospitals use local anesthesia instead. Only the part of your body being worked on is numbed with medicine so that you do not feel pain. You are also given a medicine to help you relax.\n\nYou lie on your back on an operating table with your head turned to one side. The side your blocked carotid artery is on faces up.\n\nThe surgeon makes a cut (incision) on your neck over your carotid artery. A flexible tube (catheter) is put in the artery. Blood flows through the catheter around the blocked area during surgery.\n\nYour carotid artery is opened. The surgeon removes the plaque inside the artery.\n\nAfter the plaque is removed, the artery is closed with stitches or a patch from one of your veins or synthetic material. Blood now flows through the artery to your brain.\n\nYour heart activity is monitored closely during surgery.\n\nThe surgery takes about 2 hours. After the procedure, your surgeon may do a test to confirm that the artery has been opened.\n\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\n\nThis procedure is done if your health care provider has found narrowing or a blockage in your carotid artery. Your provider will have done one or more tests to see how much the carotid artery is blocked.\n\nSurgery to remove the buildup in your carotid artery may be done if the artery is narrowed by more than 70%.\n\nIf you have had a stroke or temporary brain injury, your provider will consider whether treating your blocked artery with surgery is safe for you.\n\nOther treatment options your provider will discuss with you are:\n\nNo treatment, other than tests to check your carotid artery every year.\n\nMedicine and diet to lower your cholesterol.\n\nBlood-thinning medicines to lower your risk for stroke. Some of these medicines are aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), dabigatran (Pradaxa), and warfarin (Coumadin).\n\nCarotid angioplasty and stenting is likely to be used when carotid endarterectomy would not be safe.\n\nRisks of anesthesia are:\n\nAllergic reactions to medicines\n\nBreathing problems\n\nRisks of carotid surgery are:\n\nBlood clots or bleeding in the brain\n\nBleeding requiring re-operation to remove clot\n\nBrain damage\n\nHeart attack\n\nMore blockage of the carotid artery over time\n\nSeizures\n\nStroke\n\nSwelling near your airway (the tube you breathe through)\n\nInfection\n\nBefore the Procedure\n\nYour provider will do a thorough physical exam and order several medical tests.\n\nTell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\nA few days before the surgery, you may need to stop taking blood-thinning drugs. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other drugs like these.\n\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n\nIf you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting.\n\nTell your surgeon about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\n\nFollow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking before surgery.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\nTake any medicines your surgeon prescribed with a small sip of water.\n\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.\n\nAfter the Procedure\n\nYou may have a drain in your neck that goes into your incision. It will drain fluid that builds up in the area. It will be removed within a day.\n\nAfter surgery, your surgeon may want you to stay in the hospital overnight so that nurses can watch you for any signs of bleeding, stroke, or poor blood flow to your brain. You may be able to go home the same day if your operation is done early in the day and you are doing well.\n\nFollow instructions on how to take care of yourself at home.\n\nOutlook (Prognosis)\n\nCarotid artery surgery may help lower your chance of having a stroke. But you will need to make lifestyle changes to help prevent plaque buildup, blood clots, and other problems in your carotid arteries over time. You may need to change your diet and start an exercise program, if your provider tells you exercise is safe for you. It is also important to stop smoking.\n\nAlternative Names\n\nCarotid endarterectomy; CAS surgery; Carotid artery stenosis - surgery; Endarterectomy - carotid artery\n\nBiller J, Schneck MJ, Ruland S.
