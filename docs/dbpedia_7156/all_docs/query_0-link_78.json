We're gonna find out which 3 of you are gonna move on to the finale for a chance to be named the winner of \"The Great American Recipe.\"\n\nHoo!\n\nDoug, voice-over: I am up against a lot of great home cooks.\n\nDown the home stretch.\n\nMae, voice-over: This has changed my whole way of thinking and cooking.\n\nJon, voice-over: I'm honoring my grandmothers and my family, and that's really the most important thing to me right now.\n\nYou're cooking for Dad today.\n\nI am cooking for Dad.\n\nDad's spaghetti.\n\nRamos: I know this is the moment you've been waiting for during these past 7 weeks.\n\nWelcome back to \"The Great American Recipe\"!\n\n♪ ♪ Adjo: Here we go.\n\nDoug: Another big week.\n\nAdjo: Guys, This is the last week we get to cook together.\n\nDoug, voice-over: We're heading into week 7, and there are only two challenges left before the finalists are gonna be announced, and some of us will be going home after this week, so there's definitely a bittersweet feeling.\n\nWe've become such a family, but, you know, it is anybody's ball game.\n\nRamos: Hey, everyone!\n\nDoug: Good morning.\n\nCome on in!\n\nHey.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nHollingsworth: Good morning.\n\nRamos: Another fun week.\n\nHa ha ha!\n\nWelcome back to \"The Great American Recipe.\"\n\nPlease join me once again in welcoming your incredible group of judges-- Tim Hollingsworth... Hi!\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nFrancis Lam...\n\nMorning.\n\nand everyone's favorite Texan Tiffany Derry.\n\nHey, y'all!\n\nThis is the last week of competition before the finale.\n\nCan you believe it?\n\nWhoo-hoo!\n\nJon: Yes!\n\nYes!\n\nLam: Last week, we did throw you a curve ball with that recipe swap round, challenging you to cook a dish from a new friend, one of your fellow home cooks, and then you paid homage to another special friend in your life by cooking one of their recipes, and this week, we're gonna find out which 3 of you are gonna move on to the finale for a chance to be named the winner of \"The Great American Recipe.\"\n\nAdjo: Yeah!\n\nKim: All right.\n\nRamos: This week, we want to focus on the story of your evolution as a home cook.\n\nFor this first round, you'll have 60 minutes to prepare a recipe that opened your eyes to new flavors and cuisines.\n\nWhether it be from a person in your life, a place you've traveled to, or even a restaurant you've visited, we want you to make us your version of a dish you discovered.\n\nAs always, your dishes will be judged on taste, execution, presentation, and how well you did with the theme.\n\nRamos: We can't wait to taste your dish discoveries.\n\nYour 60 minutes... starts now!\n\n[Cheering] Let's make some rice.\n\n♪ Ramos: We asked the cooks to prepare for us a dish they discovered somewhere, something they fell in love with.\n\nWhat are you looking to see from them this round?\n\nLam: Discovery is such an interesting word because we think of it as, like, you found something, but, you know, most of the time, those things were already there.\n\nDerry: Yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's about how did you open your eyes to it, and how did that help you open your eyes to other things?\n\nDerry: Sure, and everyone's fighting for the finale right now, and so I want to see all of those small things we've been talking about because details are gonna add up.\n\nI love seeing it when they start to soar, not just because the food is fantastic, but because they are able to tell their stories.\n\nYeah.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\n♪ Hour.\n\nMarcella: You know I'm out of my comfort zone when I'm measuring.\n\nFor this round, I'm making carne asada street tacos.\n\nI went to Mexico for my honeymoon, and my husband and I took a private ATV tour, and one of the stops on the tour was the tour guide's grandmother's farmhouse, and she made us these tacos, and when we took that first bite, it was like... our heads exploded.\n\nThis particular dish involves both a dry rub and a wet rub.\n\nWhen I had this taco, it changed me.\n\nI think I could do the corn now.\n\nWhile the meat is marinating, I make roasted corn.\n\nThis is gonna pop like popcorn.\n\nOoh!\n\nHa!\n\n♪ Jon: ♪ Una mas, una mas ♪ Last week, I won both rounds.\n\nLam: Jon the taste was wonderful, the textures were great.\n\nAppreciate it.\n\nJon, your chile relleno was delicious.\n\nThe ranchero sauce had spice.\n\nIt was really, really incredible.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAnd now I feel like there's a chance to get into the finale.\n\nConfidence is an 8.5.\n\nI'm making a shrimp Palermo with fettuccine in a cream sauce.\n\nIt's a combination of some Italian flavors and some Cajun flavors, so it's a little bit spicy.\n\nShrimp Palermo is a creamy pasta with shrimp and sausage.\n\nI learned this recipe at an Italian restaurant I was working at.\n\nIt was completely counter to my cultural background, but it's got some amazing flavors.\n\nIt's got a little bit of kick.\n\nDerry: Jon, what did you just add in that pot?\n\nGarlic to roast and some of the Creole seasoning.\n\nIt's ultimately gonna be more of a cream sauce when I'm done.\n\nOK.\n\nSounds good.\n\nAnd habanero, by the way.\n\nOh!\n\nOh!\n\nOh!\n\nThank you, thank you, Adjo.\n\nI got you.\n\n[Laughter] Just a small amount of ginger today.\n\nFor this round, I'm making panang curry.\n\nPanang curry is a Thai dish that's made with Thai curry paste, basil leaves, and I'm using shrimp as my protein of choice.\n\nI learned how to make it from a friend of mine.\n\nThey had a dinner party one time and had some panang curry.\n\nThe flavors were just so amazing and different.\n\nAnd I loved it so much that I asked them to teach me how to make it.\n\nI'm using curry paste to get all of the spices and all of the ginger and the garlic, and then I'm adding coconut cream and coconut milk to give it that thickness.\n\nOoh!\n\nWe're getting there.\n\nAdjo, voice-over: I'm also cooking some green beans, red bell pepper, and onion.\n\nDoesn't it smell so good?\n\nI love panang curry.\n\nAdjo, voice-over: Panang curry typically calls for peanuts, and last week, Mae had fried peanuts that the judges loved, so I'm making some.\n\nShe said you got to constantly swirl it so it doesn't get too dark.\n\nAdjo, voice-over: The peanut taste is something that I don't typically do, yet I absolutely love it.\n\nI think this is good.\n\nMy bestie Mae.\n\n♪ Ooh!\n\nOoh!\n\nOK.\n\nI got to get these in the oil so that they stop giving me all their vapors.\n\nDoug, voice-over: So it's the last week before the finalists are gonna be announced, and I am up against a lot of great home cooks.\n\nI know I need to bring it like I do every week, so I just have to keep my focus.\n\nHi, Doug!\n\nHi, Tiffany.\n\nWhat are you making?\n\nI am making some Thai-inspired lettuce wraps, and the star here really is this fish sauce with lots of lime juice, some brown sugar, shallots, and garlic.\n\nI learned it from my friend Jamie, who prepared us Thai food.\n\nJamie's married to Paul.\n\nPaul has Thai roots, and they invited us over to their house.\n\nDoug, voice-over: These flavors, they were so unusual and so foreign to me that it sort of broke some barriers for me.\n\nWe had this salad that was just phenomenal, and the dressing was this sauce, but really the undiscovered flavor for me was the fish sauce.\n\nI love fish sauce.\n\nYeah.\n\nI had never purchased fish sauce before.\n\nI will say make sure that it's pungent enough...\n\nRight, right, right.\n\nso when you're eating everything together, the rice doesn't tone it down.\n\nDown.\n\nWhat's the purpose here?\n\nAre you steaming it, sauteing it?\n\nI'm sauteing these chicken thighs till they're fully cooked.\n\nI like getting a little bit of that brown.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou're doing the fancy toss.\n\nThis is why you get paid the big bucks.\n\nThank you.\n\nYes.\n\nOf course.\n\nIt's such an honor to have you taste my food.\n\nAmazing.\n\nOh, no.\n\nThe pleasure is all ours.\n\nThank you so much, Doug.\n\nThank you, thank you, Tiffany.\n\n♪ I'm gonna get my grits going.\n\nI am going to make shrimp and grits with a fried egg on top.\n\nIt's a dish that has changed my life, and I thought it was just the most delicious thing I'd ever had.\n\nMy husband and I visited South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nI had cheesy grits one morning, and I was like, \"What are these amazing things?\"\n\nAnd I really loved them.\n\nKim, voice-over: The first thing I do is start my grits.\n\nI'm getting milk, chicken bouillon, and salt boiling, and then I'm gonna add my grits and let them go for about 20 minutes.\n\nI want my grits to be creamy.\n\nAlaskan sausage is one of my favorite items to use.\n\nIt infuses the nice smoky flavor, which I'm super excited about because that's my own spin.\n\nRamos: Shrimp and grits is a hearty dish, and I think Kim does hearty, well.\n\nYeah, she does do hearty well, but I see her cooking the shrimp right now, and it's a little early to be cooking the shrimp.\n\nLam: It's very early.\n\nDerry: You know.\n\nHome cooks love to cook shrimp, but it's also very easy to overcook.\n\nIt's like everybody thinks it's super easy, but it actually is a little bit more complicated.\n\nDerry: Yeah.\n\nI think sometimes they think, \"Oh, I'll parcook it,\" and that parcook is already cooked when it comes to shrimp.\n\nKim, voice-over: There's a narrow window where shrimp can become perfectly done, and I have to be really careful to not overcook it.\n\nDerry: Don't overcook my shrimp.\n\nNo, I'm not going to.\n\n♪ A lot of chopping in this dish.\n\nFor this round I am going to make lamb curry Jaffna style.\n\nIt has more chili flavor in it.\n\nI'm Cantonese.\n\nMy cooking has always been mild, delicate.\n\nAccording to my husband's friends, no flavor, which is not true.\n\nMy husband's from Sri Lanka.\n\nThey put a lot of chilies because that's their palate.\n\nThis has changed my whole way of thinking in cooking.\n\nMae, voice-over: When I married him, I discovered the world of making curries, so that is what I'm going to cook.\n\nTo make my lamb dish, I add the Jaffna curry powder in the pot along with the spices and the lemongrass and the curry leaves and add the lamb before it goes in the pressure cooker.\n\n45 minutes, everyone.\n\n45 minutes.\n\nOK. ♪ We got to get crack-a-lacking on these.\n\nTim, voice-over: For this round, I'm making a pan-seared duck breast with a sun-dried tomato polenta, as well as some maple glazed carrots.\n\nSo the first thing that I need to do is get my duck breast scored.\n\nThat is done to just make the fat render a little more evenly.\n\nThis dish kind of put me out of my comfort zone.\n\nI started a new job, and my boss took us out to dinner.\n\nHe says, \"You got to try the duck.\"\n\nHere I am in a new city, starting a career and trying to impress my boss.\n\nI ordered the duck.\n\nIt was different than any other type of protein I'd had at that time, and I just kind of fell in love with it.\n\nAny of my friends know if we go out to dinner and there's duck on the menu, Tim's gonna order it.\n\nIt became one of my favorite dishes.\n\nTim, voice-over: After my duck breast is scored, I'm gonna go ahead and start on my polenta.\n\nWe'll add some cheese, a little bit of cream to it.\n\nTim, voice-over: I'm gonna use chicken stock, sun-dried tomato, and a little bit of parmesan.\n\nJust a little bit.\n\nNot too much.\n\nIt's a big pot of polenta, so we should be OK. ♪ 30 minutes left.\n\nOK!\n\nMarcella: Hey, Jon.\n\nWhich one's hotter-- chili powder or chipotle chili pepper?\n\nChipotle chili pepper.\n\nI want a little kick here... and I don't want to overcrowd my skillet.\n\nMarcella, voice-over: My strategy to make it to the finale is really paying close attention to the details.\n\nBefore this competition, I would have thrown all the meat in there at once and not think twice, but I'm learning, and one of the things I remember the chefs saying was don't overcrowd your meat.\n\n♪ Tim, voice-over: Got my polenta started.\n\nMy carrots are in the oven.\n\nI'm gonna go ahead and start cooking the duck breast.\n\nIt's got some nice color on it.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nI'm kind of turning them more than I would, because I want to make sure they're cooked evenly.\n\n♪ Tim, you're sweating over here.\n\nI am, sir.\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nI'm doing good.\n\nI'm doing good.\n\nBeautiful, beautiful.\n\nYou have the duck breasts in here?\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nI started them off two skillets, searing them.\n\nI would recommend just making sure that the skin is nice and crispy.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat temperature are you going for on the duck?\n\nI'm going for just above a medium rare.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's nice.\n\nI would recommend checking the consistency on everything, so making sure that that polenta is all the way cooked out.\n\nI added some sun-dried tomatoes.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nI also put a little bit of parm in there.\n\n♪ I think it's got a great consistency.\n\nMascarpone goes great with polenta.\n\nIt helps, like, give that, like, fattiness, rich texture.\n\nParmesan is great, but I always do, like, a little parmesan and mascarpone combination.\n\nOK. Not a problem.\n\nI'm gonna check my pantry.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nThank you, chef.\n\nAll right.\n\nGood luck.\n\nBack to the polenta.\n\nOh, yeah, nice.\n\nAdjo: OK, home cooks.\n\nWe have 20 minutes!\n\n20 minutes.\n\nThank you, Adjo!\n\nJon, voice-over: I'm gonna start my pasta, but you don't want it to overcook.\n\nYou don't want it too firm.\n\nTime management with pasta is crucial.\n\nHey, Jon.\n\nSir!\n\nCan I do one thing for you right now?\n\nYes, sir.\n\nMove the pasta.\n\nThe reason why you want to move the pasta right when you put it in is all the starch on the outside of the pasta starts to gel when it hits hot water, and gelled starch is essentially glue.\n\nI really appreciate that, judge.\n\nI'm gonna salt this now and put the shrimp at the end.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou got a lot of stuff going on.\n\nI'm sort of competing with myself I recognize throughout all these cooks.\n\nI like what you're saying about competing against yourself because you had such a great week last week...

secrets, too.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nThis is just a meal that we make for my dad.\n\nIt's his favorite thing to eat in the world.\n\nAnd why is that?\n\nBecause he didn't grow up with much, and so whenever they got moose, my grandma would make spaghetti, and it's always been his favorite just because of that.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI think it's great.\n\nI think, um, obviously it needs time... Yeah.\n\nand reduce down, and I think, uh, even the addition of the meat and the fat coming out of that going into the sauce, I think, is gonna be delicious.\n\nOK.

your own tortillas, and the fact that you pulled it all together is really a testament to your improving organization in the kitchen.\n\nThe only thing I would say, the tortillas, some were thinner, and some were thicker than others.\n\nI don't know if that's part of the rustic style, but they ate pretty differently from one another from a technical point of view...\n\nYes.\n\nbut the flavor of

in there is, like--adds, like, a really nice, rich quality.\n\nIt helps kind of round out that gaminess from the moose and the meatball.\n\nLam: Yeah, it's funny, this is the second time you've served us moose, and in this one, I really taste the intensity of the moose flavor, and there's a real depth to the sauce.\n\nThe mushrooms help that umami, but, like, I didn't realize moose was, like, such an umami bomb.\n\nI really enjoy it.\n\nRamos: Thank you so much, Kim.\n\nThank you.\n\nAdjo, come and join us.\n\nAdjo: So today, I've made okra stew with akume.\n\nIn Togolese culture, okra stew is literally the fabric.\n\nThis is not just my family's DNA.\n\nThis is literally my country's DNA, and if I were to leave this competition and go home and I didn't showcase this, I would never forgive myself.\n\nSo I'm just glad that I get this opportunity to put my country here.\n\nDerry: Adjo, I think it is so flavorful.\n\nIt took me home in a really weird way.\n\nI didn't grow up having this dish, but I grew up having stewed okra.\n\nIt shows that our dishes and the roots of a lot of our cooking comes from Africa, and so thank you so much.\n\nIt was so delicious.\n\nHollingsworth: You know, Adjo, every single bite is beautiful.\n\nIt all comes together in this rich, craveable just, like, homey, homey dish, but... ♪ I think that you nailed the shrimp cooking, as well.\n\n[Cheering] The shrimp are cooked perfectly.\n\nWhoo!\n\n[Laughter] Finally!\n\nAdjo, voice-over: I am very proud of myself for bringing this dish.\n\nI don't know if I made it to the finale, but if they were to send me home right now, I would feel like I've done what I came here to do.\n\nThank you so much for sharing with us, Adjo.\n\n[Hushed] Thank you.\n\n♪ Thank you all for sharing these incredible dishes.\n\nYou really, really should feel so proud.\n\nPlease give us a moment so that the judges can discuss all the dishes you prepared over the past 7 weeks.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nTim: Thank you.\n\n♪ Ramos: This is an important round for our home cooks.\n\n3 of them will move on to the finale to compete for the title of winner of \"The Great American Recipe.\"\n\nAt this point, it's an extremely tight race.\n\nLet's talk about all of their journeys over the past 7 weeks.\n\nI mean, Marcella came out of the gate swinging, and I feel like she's been in the top maybe more than any other of the home cooks.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe all agreed that the eggplant was done to perfection.\n\nYour chicken piccata over couscous was such a beautiful dish.\n\nMarcella, I think this soup is really, really tasty, and what really impresses me about it is the depth of flavor in the broth.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere's so many good cooks here.\n\nDo you think Marcella deserves a spot in the finale?\n\nLam: I think she's definitely in the conversation for sure.\n\nTim's first win was in week 4.\n\nWe could see it coming.\n\nHollingsworth: Oh, yeah.\n\nI mean, I've had a lot of grits.\n\nI've never had anything like that.\n\nDerry: It's the first time I've ever had this, and I'm like, \"What is happening?\n\nI didn't grow up with this!\"\n\nI wish I would have.\n\nLam: He pulled a double-double that day.\n\nHa!\n\nHe did!\n\nHe came on top in the first round, on top in the second round and won.\n\nYour raspberry tartlets were phenomenal.\n\nI would struggle to think of a bakery that would make a raspberry tartlet that I want more than that.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nWow!\n\nTim really impressed us and was never in the bottom.\n\nLam: Wow.\n\nYeah, he's definitely a strong contender.\n\nYeah.\n\nLet's talk about Kim's journey.\n\nYou know, in week one, Kim came out on top with her Alaskan seafood chowder, which was itself a celebration of all of these proteins and flavors that are very unique to Alaska.\n\nI really liked the sweetness of the corn with the smokiness of the sausage.\n\nRamos: I think this was a first time for all of us, right, having reindeer?\n\nDerry: That's correct.\n\nYeah, first time.\n\nBut she came out on bottom with her strawberry rhubarb cupcakes.\n\nThe frosting is a little bit broken.\n\nBut the thing I love about what Kim has done through the course of this competition is the dishes come from all over.\n\nI don't know that anyone else has really done that in this competition.\n\nAdjo blew us away with her West African flavors and her Togolese recipes, and it landed her in the top 5 times.\n\nI think the depth of flavor that you were able to achieve in such a short amount of time is really, really incredible.\n\nAwesome.\n\nAlthough all of her dishes have had a tremendous amount of flavor, there's been a few technical issues.\n\nThe overcooking on the shrimp twice.\n\nDerry: Yeah, but the shrimp was cooked very well today.\n\nI appreciate the effort, but sometimes, she struggled with the execution.\n\nLam: Adjo, there was so much to love about your dish, but the cook of the lamb needed a little tweak of not crowding the grill as much.\n\nShe was on the bottom 3 times, I think, but the high highs are real high.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI mean, we had some amazing dishes from Mae in the very beginning.\n\nLam: This is a really terrific version of the Chinese chicken salad, and I totally see this as a dish that represents California.\n\nThank you.\n\nStraight out the gate, Mae told us who she was.\n\nYeah.\n\nImmediately, she's Mama Mae.\n\nDerry: But she struggled with the Singapore noodles.\n\nLam: I think the noodles started to break a little bit on you.\n\nThe noodles are a bit shorter, and here I think they overcooked.\n\nYeah.\n\nMae was one of the home cooks who I think was a little bit up and down.\n\nYeah, but you can really just see the delicateness in her technique and in her flavor profile.\n\nLam: Yeah.\n\nShe is just a great cook.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nJon's journey has been one of the most interesting of this competition.\n\nIn week two, he was in the bottom with esquites, the Mexican street corn.\n\nThe outside layer of the corn is just a little tough and chewy for me, but overall, it's a great dish.\n\nI appreciate it, chef.\n\nRamos: But the following week he came through with that mojo de ajo and salmon dish.\n\nThat is a perfectly executed salmon, Jon.\n\nYeah!\n\nDish after dish, he's gotten better and better.\n\nDerry: I agree.\n\nIt truly is a delight to have watched that journey, and the food is even tastier than it was before.\n\nDoes that mean you want to see him cook some more?\n\nI'm not sure yet.\n\n[Laughter] And I think with Doug, week one when he gave us the Pittsburgh pocket.\n\nDerry: The back half of it was underbaked dough, but I like everything that you have in it.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nBut Doug won week 2 and week 3 with the farro salad and the lemon pasta.\n\nYou can tell Doug knows how to cook.\n\nFor sure.\n\nConsistently, he's done OK, but he also struggled.\n\nYes, he has improved, but there are also a lot of people who have done better than him for a longer period of time.\n\nSure.\n\nThis is true.\n\nRamos: You know, I agree.\n\nEveryone here had their own unique journey, but at the end of the day, they're all incredible cooks, right?\n\nOK.\n\nIt does sound like you've come to a decision.\n\nDerry: Let's do it.\n\nYeah.\n\nAll right.\n\nLet's bring the cooks back in.\n\n♪ Ramos: Welcome back, cooks.\n\nI know this is the moment you've been waiting for during these past 7 weeks.\n\nFrom the start of this journey until now, the judges have been considering each of your dishes.\n\nIt's time to announce the 3 home cooks who will be moving on to the big finale next week for their chance to be named the winner of \"The Great American Recipe.\"\n\nOh, gosh!\n\nHollingsworth: The first home cook to move on to the finale is... ♪ Adjo!\n\n[Cheering] Adjo, voice-over: My heart is falling out of my chest.\n\nAdjo, we have loved seeing you cook and introducing us to your West African flavors, and we really thank you for the fact that you've shared your ancestral history and your story about bringing that and celebrating it to where you live today.\n\nI wanted to do this because I want people to know that... just because something is unfamiliar does not make it bad.\n\nIt just makes it different, and maybe if you give it a try, you might like it, too.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSo being here is just validation for that, and I'm just grateful to be the vessel, so thank you.\n\nThank you, Adjo.\n\nThe next home cook advancing to the finale is... ♪ Marcella!\n\n[Cheering] Mae: I told you.\n\nI'm going to the finale!\n\nIt's an honor just to be considered a finalist as one of the greatest home cooks in the United States.\n\nI feel like it's such an honor to be able to represent my culture, my little island, my family.\n\nI just want to make them proud.\n\nRamos: You've already made them proud.\n\nHollingsworth: Yeah.\n\nYou have produced some amazing dishes but not just your food-- your story.\n\nThe love you have for your family is something that shines so bright.\n\nYou truly show love through food, and to experience your food is to feel love.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou said it better than I could.\n\n[Laughter] Lam: And the final home cook making it through to next week's finale is... ♪ Jon!\n\n[Cheering] Doug: Yes!\n\nJon: Holy -- oh, sorry.\n\n[Laughter] Jon, voice-over: I can't believe it.\n\nTo be honest with you, I didn't think I was gonna make it into the finale, so I am very proud that the judges started seeing that improvement and that commitment.\n\nLam: Jon, when we talked about the spirit and the heart of your cooking, you've done that certainly from the beginning, and the ambition of what you're trying to put on the plate week after week.\n\nMaking the tortillas today, it was just such a moving culmination of your growth and your journey here, and we can't wait to see what you do next week.\n\nI feel privileged and honored because I'm a first-generation Mexican American, but it's about honoring your heritage and the people you love, and so I feel honored and privileged.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou should all feel so proud of yourselves.\n\nWhether you're moving on to the finale or not, the 7 of you without a doubt demonstrated why you are some of the best home cooks in the country, and I think it's safe to say you've all made some lifelong friendships.\n\nDoug: Yes, absolutely.\n\nDoug, voice-over: Of course, going home is a little bittersweet, but I am truly so happy for my fellow cooks that made it to the finale.\n\nI love that they're being able to share their food and the story around that for one more week.\n\nRamos: We'll be back next week to crown the winner of \"The Great American Recipe.\"\n\n[Cheering] Congratulations!\n\nGood night!\n\nHa ha ha!\n\nDoug: Thank you all.\n\nRamos: Thank you all.\n\nJon: Is this real?\n\nMarcella: Yes.\n\nIt's not a dream.\n\nRamos: Next time on \"The Great American Recipe\"... We're just two rounds away from one of you walking out of here as the winner of \"The Great American Recipe.\"\n\nMarcella: This is the culmination of a very emotional journey.\n\nJon: I want the judges to love my food the way my family loves my food.\n\nAdjo: All I ever want to do is share African culture, but winning this would just be the cherry on top.\n\nRamos: The winner of \"The Great American Recipe\" is... ♪"
