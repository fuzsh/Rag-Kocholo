        "text": "No celluloid will ever show the like of it or scenario tell the equal of it. It is Fatty’s masterpiece.\n\n—Freda Blum\n\nOn the morning Roscoe Arbuckle was to testify, November 28, 1921, it was rumored that an unidentified attorney threatened to quit the comedian’s “million-dollar defense” team. According to the Los Angeles Express, this was Milton Cohen, angered over the lead defense attorney, Gavin McNab, mulling the idea that it might be better not to have the defendant testify. Chandler Sprague in the San Francisco Examiner reported one possible reason for McNab’s hesitation: that “certain business interests were adverse” to the comedian testifying, a veiled reference to one man, surely, Adolph Zukor, who was hardly as sanguine about Arbuckle making a comeback as his manager and chief fund raiser for his defense, Joseph Schenck, and the man assigned to watch his clients in Hollywood, Lou Anger.\n\nThere was also dissension on the prosecution’s side. Milton U’Ren, a veteran assistant district attorney, had been passed over to lead the cross-examination of Arbuckle. He was angry enough to resign from the case as well, a case that he had largely developed with the approval of District Attorney Matthew Brady. During the noon recess, U’Ren could be heard arguing with Brady in the Hall of Justice because his fellow prosecutor, Leo Friedman, had hardly made a dent in Arbuckle.\n\nMost reporters expected the comedian to do well and eclipse anything thus far said from the witness chair. Otis M. Wiles for the Los Angeles Times used a slapstick term for the comedian’s impending appearance as a “climax stunt.” Early into his cross-examination, Arbuckle impressed most of the reporters who saw and heard him. Who they were rooting for, too, was evident in their copy. According to Bart Haley of Philadelphia’s Evening Public Ledger, Arbuckle\n\nrevealed himself in his narrative as the most piteous of fat men, the most tragically used of all good Samaritans, an amiable individual whose rooms were invaded by uninvited guests, who ate his food and borrowed his motorcar, and ran up a big bill on him and got him into a pit of trouble with the hotel management before they finally started him on the way to jail under a charge of murder.[1]\n\nEarl Ennis of the San Francisco Bulletin seemed to applaud Arbuckle as well. But he also touched on what the monitors of the Women’s Vigilant Committee—and Zukor as well—knew would be hard to square. “There was nothing nice about Arbuckle’s story—noting elevating,” Ennis wrote, “It was a ‘booze party,’ pure and simple with jumbled elements involved—salesmen, movie stars, women, all scrambled unconventionally into an afternoon’s entertainment.”[2]\n\nWhat follows is a revised version of our “provisional” transcript of Arbuckle’s testimony, which is likely the most complete version available since no state transcript has been preserved or discovered. For the most part, it is based on four San Francisco dailies—the Bulletin, Call, Chronicle, and Examiner—which employed their own stenographers.\n\nMost of the reporters covering the trial believed that Arbuckle had secured his acquittal. As it turned out, at least two jurors were unconvinced and saw Arbuckle as an actor playing a role. Indeed, the testimony reads as if it were tailored or, to use the language of the cinema, a recut of previous testimony by other witnesses to fit the image of a gentler Good Samaritan Arbuckle that would befit the public image of “Fatty.” This includes his original statement issued on the night of September 9, 1921, the day Virginia Rappe died, and published the next day in the morning Los Angeles Times. That statement, which was vetted by Arbuckle’s original lead attorney, Frank Dominguez, only states that “After Miss Rappe had a couple of drinks she became hysterical and I called the hotel physician and the manager.” In its place, however, Arbuckle posits a much expanded series of events.\n\nTraces of the real Virginia Rappe emerge here and there in the testimony. There was even a moment of unintended silence just before the noon recess, when Deputy Coroner Jane Walsh entered the courtroom, carrying Rappe’s bladder, preserved in a glass jar and placed on the evidence table. But in Arbuckle’s account of September 5, 1921, Rappe remains a cipher, a poseable doll even before she is found on the bathroom floor. The comedian is very careful to avoid how well he knew Rappe. They had a certain rapport. But here the comedian quite literally turns his back on her the moment she made her way to his bedroom. This way, he can assert that he was unaware that she was there when he entered to get dressed in order to go “riding” with the other woman in his story, Mae Taube.\n\nThough Arbuckle’s testimony is ductile, that fits and twists and conforms to what really happened in room 1219, it suggests to us that the injury that was inflicted on Rappe took place in the bathroom and even has the outlines of sexual imposition. Laws had been on the books for decades in regard to the temptations of hotel and furnished room accommodations as dens of lasciviousness, fornication, and adultery. But for casual sex during a party in a smallish three-room hotel suite, the privacy for such intimacies (and immediacies) could be found in the bathrooms. If there was a sexual encounter that preceded or led to the injury, the bathroom would have provided a space with greater privacy and sound dampening, not to mention conveniently located fixtures such as a sink, a toilet, and towel rods for grab irons, as well as the hard surfaces on which to brace oneself. The brass bedsteads in room 1219, shown in E. O. Heinrich’s photographs, could also serve this purpose. But Arbuckle, much as he was proud to cross his leg, likely could do it Venus observa.\n\nWhat was termed an “official transcript” lacked much of Arbuckle’s real “voice” dismissing Friedman’s skepticism and often making him Fatty’s straight man. But the seeming frustration and incompetence seen in the youngest member of the prosecution is exaggerated. Friedman’s approach likely relied on the jury’s perception of subtleties in Arbuckle’s testimony that reveal it to be rehearsed, coached, and a piece of fiction. We also see places where Friedman should have probed more deeply, such as Arbuckle’s making his friend and roommate at the St. Francis Hotel, the comedy director Fred Fishback, a patsy for the liquor and inviting Rappe at the behest of his friend, Ira Fortlouis, a San Francisco gown salesman, the latter being mysteriously expelled from the party at the time of Rappe’s crisis.\n\nIt was Fortlouis’s sighting of—or rather attraction to—Rappe that resulted in her invitation to Arbuckle’s suite. Did Fortlouis pay so much attention to her that Arbuckle saw a rival to his own attentions to Rappe? And why did Friedman not ask about the vomit? It seems as though Rappe vomited copiously and it’s unlikely all of it would have gone down the toilet, yet that word is absent in all the other testimonies. In the testimony of party guests Zey Prevost and Alice Blake, the back of Arbuckle’s pajamas is visibly wet. The double bed in which Rappe was wet. But nothing was asked about the source of the wetness, as though it were a taboo subject. One must wonder if there was a code among newspaper editors that prevented them from reporting specific details. (Interestingly, the prosecution’s criminologist E. O. Heinrich reported on old semen stains he found on the mattress pads and bedclothes, but these had already gone through the laundry and could have come from other guests. For this reason, Milton U’Ren elected to pursue only the fingerprint evidence and the marks left by the French heels of Maude Delmont’s kicking the door—which Arbuckle said that he didn’t hear.)\n\nThe same might be asked about the defense attorneys who failed to subpoena May Taube. She was possibly Arbuckle’s only close friend at the hotel that day. She was seen by other party guests in the early afternoon, as Arbuckle’s testimony states. But in her one statement to the District Attorney, she left because she didn’t know anyone there, which refers to the women and with the implication that they were low by her standards. Friedman does establish that Arbuckle introduced Taube to one of these women, indeed, Virginia Rappe. But that is as far as he takes it, leaving it to the jury and us to see if there was a “woman scorned.”\n\nTaube could have easily corroborated the story Arbuckle tells in the following transcript. She would also have been a perfect character witness. Although she didn’t go “riding” with Arbuckle on Labor Day afternoon, Mrs. Taube spent the night of September 5 dancing with him in the St. Francis ballroom according to her statement to the DA. But she is never called in any of the three Arbuckle trials. That she was that untouchable suggests she held a certain leverage. (See our Taube entry for more information about her.)\n\nSatirical photograph published in the Modesto Evening News, November 28, 1921 (Newspapers.com)\n\n[1] Bart Haley, “Fatty, Cool on the Stand, Recites New Version of Miss Rappe’s Hurt,” Evening Public Ledger, 29 November 1921, 1.\n\n[2] Earl Ennis, “Crowded Court Listens Tensely as Actor Tells Details of Tragic Party,” San Francisco Bulletin, 28 November 1921, FS1.\n\nArbuckle: My name is Roscoe Arbuckle.

Who were there when she came?\n\nA: Mr. Fortlouis, Mr. Sherman, Mr. Fischbach[1] and myself.\n\nQ: Did Miss Rappe come to those rooms by your invitation?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Who, if anybody, joined your party?[2]\n\nA. A few minutes —\n\nQ: Joined the company in your rooms?\n\nA: A few minutes after Miss Rappe came in Mrs. Delmont came in.\n\nQ: Dd you know Mrs. Delmont previous to that time?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Was Mrs. Delmont there by your invitation?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Who else came in, if anybody?\n\nA: Miss Blake came in.\n\nQ: Did Miss Blake come there by your invitation?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Anybody else come?\n\nA: Yes, Miss Prevost came later.\n\nQ: Did Miss Prevost come by your invitation?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Anybody else come?\n\nA: Mr. Semnacher came in.\n\nQ: Did Mr. Semnacher come by your invitation?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Did anybody else come?\n\nA: Yes, sir, Mrs. Taube and another lady.[3]\n\nQ: Did Mrs. Taube come by your invitation?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: How were you dressed on that occasion?\n\nA: I was dressed in pajamas and bathrobe and slippers.\n\nQ: I will ask you if this is the bathrobe that you wore on that occasion (showing bathrobe to witness).\n\nA: Yes, sir, my robe, yes, sir.\n\nQ: I will ask the ladies and gentlemen of the jury to look at this; this has been much commented on in evidence.\n\nQ: Did you at any time during that day see Miss Virginia Rappe in room 1219?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: About what time.\n\nA: Around 3 o’clock.\n\nQ: How do you know it was about 3 o’clock?\n\nA: I looked at the clock; I was going out.\n\nQ: And what fixes—what caused you to look at the clock at that time?\n\nA: I had an engagement with Mrs. Taube, and she came up about 1:30, but I had loaned Mr. Fischbach my car and she said she would wait downstairs until he came back; and he said he was going to the beach and he would come back just as soon as he could, so I figured it was about time for him to come back, so I looked—\n\nMr. Friedman: Just a moment. We ask that everything after the words “I figured” be stricken out as a conclusion of the witness.\n\nThe Court: It goes out.[4]\n\nMr. McNab: Where, if any place, previous to seeing Miss Rappe in 1219, where last before had you seen her?\n\nArbuckle: In 1220; I saw her go into 1221.\n\nQ: And when you entered—at what time did you enter 1219?\n\nA: Just about 3 o’clock.\n\nQ: At the time you entered 1219 was or not the door between 1219 and 1220 opened?\n\nA: Yes, sir, it was open.\n\nQ: Did you know at the time you entered 1219 that Miss Rappe was there?\n\nMr. Friedman: Now, that is objected to as calling for the conclusion of the witness, and as leading and suggestive. And upon the ground that the question has already been asked and answered.\n\nMr. McNab: I have not asked that, and the question is not leading.\n\nThe Court: Objection sustained.\n\nMr. McNab: Did your honor sustain the objection?\n\nThe Court: Sustained the objection.\n\nMr. McNab: At the time you entered 1219, I understand the door between 1219 and 1220 you state was open?\n\nArbuckle: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And where in 1219 did you see Miss Rappe?\n\nA: I did not see her in 1219.\n\nQ: Where did you see her?\n\nA: I found her in the bathroom.\n\nQ: Of what room?\n\nA: Of 1219.\n\nQ: And under what circumstances did you find her in the bathroom?\n\nA: When I walked into 1219, I closed and locked the door, and went straight to the bathroom and found Miss Rappe on the floor holding her stomach and moving around on the floor. She had been vomiting [ill].[5]\n\nQ: What did you do? Explain to the jury all the circumstances which occurred in the bathroom of 1219.\n\nA: When I opened the door the door struck her, and I had to slide in this way (illustrating) to get in, to get by her and get hold of her. Then I closed the door and picked her up. When I picked her up, [I held her, and she was ill again]; I held her under the waist, like that (indicating), and by the forehead, to keep her hair back off her face.\n\nQ: Then what else occurred? Give the jury all the circumstances occurring in the bathroom of 1219.\n\nA: I took a towel and wiped her face, she was still sitting there holding her stomach, evidently in pain, and she asked for a drink of water.\n\nMr. Friedman: We ask that the words “evidently in pain” be stricken out.\n\nMr. McNab: It may go out.\n\nQ: She asked for a drink of water, and I gave it to her, and she drank a glass of water, and she asked for another glass, and I gave it to her, and she drank another half a glass of water.\n\nQ: What else happened?\n\nA: I asked her if I could do anything for her. She said no, she would just like to lie down; so I lifted her into 1219 and sat her down on the small bed and she sat on the bed with her head toward the foot of the bed.\n\nQ: What else did you do, if anything?\n\nA: She just expressed a wish that she wanted to lie down; that she had these spells; that she wanted to lie down a while. I lifted her feet off the floor and put them on the bed; she was lying this way, with her feet off the bed, and I went into the bathroom and closed the door.\n\nQ: What else happened when you left, the bathroom and returned to 1219, if anything?\n\nA: I came back into 1219 in about—well, I was in there about two or three minutes, and I found Miss Rappe between the beds, rolling about on the floor, holding her stomach and crying and moaning, and I tried to pick her up, and I couldn’t get hold of her; I couldn’t get alongside of her to pick her up, so I pulled her up into a sitting position, then lifted her on to the large bed and stretched her out on the bed. She turned over on her left side (Arbuckle said Miss Rappe was taken ill again) and started to groan and I immediately went out of 1219 to find Mrs. Delmont.\n\nQ: Whom did you find in 1220 when you went there?\n\nA: Miss Prevost.\n\nQ: Did you advise Miss Prevost of the condition of Miss Rappe?\n\nA: Yes, I just said “Miss Rappe is sick.”\n\nQ: Did Miss Prevost go into 1219 at that time?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: What else happened?\n\nA: Just a few minutes after Mrs. Delmont came—not a few minutes, just may be a few seconds—Mrs. Delmont came out of 1221 and I told her and she went into 1219 and I followed behind her.\n\nQ: What happened in 1219 then?\n\nA: Miss Rappe was sitting up on the edge of the large bed, tearing her clothes in this fashion (illustrating), tearing and frothing at the mouth, like in a terrible temper, or something—\n\nMr. Friedman: We ask, of course, that the words “like in a terrible temper” be stricken out as a conclusion of the witness.\n\nMr. McNab: That may go out.\n\nThe Court: It goes out.\n\nMr. McNab: What else? Give the. jury a narrative of what occurred at that time in 1219.\n\nArbuckle: I say, she was sitting on the bed, tearing her clothes; she pulled her dress up, tore her stockings; she had a black lace garter, and she tore the lace off the garter. And Mr. Fischbach came in about that time and asked the girls to stop her tearing her clothes. And I went over to her, and she was tearing on the sleeve of her dress, and she one bad sleeve just hanging by a few shreds. I don’t know which one it was, and I says “All right, if you want that off I will take it off for you.” And I pulled it off for her; then I went out of the room.\n\nQ: Did you return to the room later?\n\nA: Yes, sir, some time later.\n\nQ: What was occurring in the room at that time, when you returned?\n\nA: Miss Rappe was then on the little bed nude.\n\nQ: What occurred?\n\nA: I went in there and Mrs. Delmont was rubbing her with some ice. She had a lot of ice in a towel or napkin, or something, and had it on the back of her neck, and she had another piece in her hand and was rubbing Miss Rappe with it. massaging her, and there was a piece of ice lying on Miss Rappe’s body. I picked it up and said, “What is this doing here?” She says, “Leave it here; I know how to take care of Virginia,” and I put it back on Miss Rappe when I picked it up and I started to cover Miss Rappe up, to pull the spread down from underneath her so I could cover her with it, and Mrs. Delmont told me to get out of the room and leave her alone, and I told Mrs. Delmont to shut up or I would throw her out of the window, and I went out of the room.\n\nQ: What else occurred? Tell the jury what did you do? Anything further?\n\nA: I went out of the room, and Mrs. Taube came in and I asked Mrs. Taube if she would phone Mr. Boyle, and we went into 1221, and Mrs. Taube picked up the phone and phoned Mr. Boyle and asked him to come up to the room and get a room for Miss Rappe.\n\nQ: What occurred after that?\n\nA. I went back into 1219 and told Mrs. Delmont to get dressed, that the manager was coming up, and she went out to get dressed, and she pulled the spread down underneath—from underneath Miss Rappe, down below, underneath her feet, and put it up over her, and went back into 1221.\n\nQ: What further happened?\n\nA: Mr. Boyle came in; he came to the door of 1221.\n\nQ: What occurred thereafter?\n\nA: I took him in to where Miss Rappe was lying in 1219.\n\nQ: And what was done then?\n\nA: Mrs. Delmont came in and we put a bathrobe on Miss Rappe, Mrs. Delmont and myself.[6]\n\nQ: Where did you get the bathrobe?\n\nA: Out of the closet; it was Mr. Fischbach’s robe.\n\nQ: And what then was done?\n\nA: We took her around through the hall into 1227.\n\nQ: How did you get out of 1219?\n\nA: Took her out of the door leading into the hall.\n\nQ: Who opened the door?\n\nA: Mr. Boyle.\n\nQ: How did you get Miss Rappe around to 1227?\n\nA: I carried her part of the way. She was limp and did not have any life in her body. She kept slipping, and I got about three-quarters of the way and I asked Mr. Boyle—I did not ask him to take her, I asked him to boost her up in the middle so I could get another hold of her, and he just took her right out of my arms and we went into 1227.\n\nQ: Then what occurred in room 1227, if you know?\n\nA: We put her to bed and covered her up, and I asked Mr. Boyle if he would get a doctor; and I walked back to the elevator with him and then I walked on into the room, into 1219.\n\nQ: Was the door between 1219 and the hall unlocked throughout the day?\n\nA: lt was, so far as I know. Mr. Fischbach went out that way.\n\nQ: You saw him go out.\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And when you took Miss Rappe out, the door was open from the bedroom of 1219, was it?\n\nMr. Friedman: We object to the question as leading.\n\nMr. McNab: Well I withdraw it. How was the door open from 1219 into the hall?\n\nArbuckle: Mr. Boyle just walked over and opened it.\n\nQ: Was or was not the window of room 1219 open that day?\n\nA: lt was always open.\n\nFriedman: Just a moment. We ask that the answer “always open” be stricken out.\n\nCourt: It goes out.\n\nArbuckle: lt was open.\n\nMcNab: How was the curtain of the window in room 1219?\n\nArbuckle: I raised the curtain myself in the morning when I arose.\n\nQ: During the time that you were in room 1219, did you ever hear Miss Rappe say, “You hurt me” or “He hurt me”?\n\nA: No, sir.

I introduced her to Miss Rappe, I think.\n\nQ: She stayed there for how long?\n\nA: Just a few moments.\n\nQ: And then she left?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Do you know why?\n\nA: Yes, I think I do.\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: Well, she had another girl with her.\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: And she didn’t want to stay there.\n\nQ: Did she say why she did not want to stay there?\n\nMcNab: I object to that as not proper cross-examination. It has nothing to do with the issues of this case.\n\nCourt: Objection overruled.\n\nArbuckle: This girl? Mrs. Taube says why—she didn’t say at that time. She said she was going down, that she would come back.\n\nFriedman: What time did she return? Did she return?\n\nA: Yes, she returned later on after this trouble in 1219; came up about ten minutes after Mr. Fischbach, somewhere along there.\n\nQ: And how long did she remain at that time?\n\nA: She remained in the rooms until after Miss Rappe had been taken to 1227 and I came back.\n\nQ: Yes. And then she went out?\n\nA: Then she went out again, yes, sir.\n\nQ: You did not go with her?\n\nA: No; she did not go riding.\n\nQ: You did not go riding?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And you saw her again that day?\n\nA: Yes, sir; she called back about 6 o’clock in the evening, I think.\n\nQ: Now, do you know why Mrs. Taube went away after you had moved Miss Rappe to room 1227?\n\nA: I don’t know; she just seemed to me like she was a little peeved or something.\n\nQ: Isn’t it a fact that she said something to you that indicated that she was a little peeved at the time?\n\nA: Yes, she did.\n\nQ: What was it she said?\n\nA: She asked me who those people were, and what they were doing; I told her I didn’t know who they were.\n\nQ: And she asked you on the first occasion, didn’t she?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And that is why she left, wasn’t it, because these people were in your rooms?\n\nA: I probably think so.\n\nQ: And you did not go with her on either of the occasions in the afternoon?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Now, upon Mrs. Taube’s first visit to your room on the 5th of September, about half past one, as you have testified to, what was Miss Rappe doing at that time?\n\nA: She was sitting on a settee in the corner, I think.\n\nQ: Did she remain there all the time that Mrs. Taube was in the room on the first visit?\n\nA: I can’t remember whether she did or not: I talked to Mrs. Taube.\n\nQ: You can’t remember whether she did or not. Did you notice where Miss Rappe was after Mrs. Taube left on her first visit? I was talking to Mrs. Taube. I don’t know.\n\nQ: You saw Miss Rappe go into room 1221. did you?\n\nA: Yes, sir, later on.\n\nQ: You introduced Mrs. Taube to Miss Rappe I believe you said?\n\nA: I think I did; I don’t know; maybe somebody else; I just can’t recall whether I introduced her.\n\nQ: Well, now, did you or didn’t you?\n\nA: I don’t know whether I did or not.\n\nQ: Did anyone else in that room know Mrs. Taube that you know of?\n\nA: Yes, Mr. Fischbach knew her, but he was not there.\n\nQ: He was not there, so you don’t know whether you introduced her to Miss Rappe, or not?\n\nA: No, I don’t know.\n\nQ: Do you know whether or not she was introduced to Miss Rappe?\n\nA: Yes, sir, I think she was. I suppose so.\n\nQ: Well, were you present when she was introduced to Miss Rappe?\n\nA: Well. I don’t know; I have a habit of introducing people. I don’t always do it.\n\nQ: We are not talking about your habits; we are talking about what happened in this room at this time, about 1:30 on September 5.\n\nA: Yes, I think she was introduced, as near as I can remember.\n\nQ: All right; now where was Miss Rappe when you were introduced to Mrs. Taube? What was she doing? Was she standing up or sitting down?\n\nA: I think she was sitting on the settee, as near as I can remember.\n\nQ: All right; how was she dressed?\n\nA: Miss Rappe or Mrs. Taube?\n\nQ: Miss Rappe?\n\nA: She had on a green dress, a green skirt and a green jacket.\n\nQ: Did she have a hat on?\n\nA: I can’t remember whether she had a hat on at that time or not.\n\nQ: Well, you don’t know whether she had a hat on or not; is that the answer?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Was her hair up or down?\n\nA: I can’t remember that, either.\n\nQ: You can’t remember that. You don’t recall seeing her hair down at that time, do you?\n\nA: No, I do not.\n\nQ: Now, when Miss Rappe went into room 1221, as you have testified to, was she still dressed as she was introduced to Mrs. Taube?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Did she have a hat on at that time, or not?\n\nA: I don’t—no, she did not have a hat on then.\n\nQ: Was her hair up or down at that time?\n\nA: I can’t remember exactly.\n\nQ: You can’t remember; you don’t remember of seeing her hair down at that time, do you?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: How long did she remain in 1221?\n\nA: I don’t know.[12]\n\nQ: You don’t know? You saw her go in?\n\nA: I saw her go in, yes, sir.\n\nQ: You saw her go in room 1219?\n\nA: I did not.\n\nQ: You did not—did not see her go into room 1219?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: How long a time elapsed from the time you saw Miss Rappe go into room 1221 until you went into room 1219?\n\nA: I couldn’t tell you.\n\nQ: Well, what were you doing when she went into room 1221?\n\nA: I was sitting there talking to her when she went into 1221.\n\nQ: You were sitting there talking to her?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And she got up and went into room 1221?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: What did you do when she got up and went into room 1221?\n\nA: I got up; I don’t know what I did; went to the Victrola or something, or danced; I don’t know; I don’t remember at that time.\n\nQ: Well, how long a time would you say elapsed from the time you saw Miss Rappe go into room 1221 until you went into room 1219?\n\nA: I couldn’t tell you.\n\nQ: Well, was it a half hour?\n\nA: No, I don’t think it was that long.\n\nQ: Well, fifteen minutes?\n\nA: I wouldn’t say what time it was. It was—\n\n[Order inferred[13]]\n\nQ: Now, you can’t fix the time—I withdraw that. What time did Miss Rappe to into room 1221?\n\nA: I couldn’t tell you just what time.\n\nQ: Well, you say that you had been sitting in 1220 talking to her when she went in there?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Where were you sitting?\n\nA: She was sitting here, and I was sitting on this chair here (indicating on diagram).\n\nQ: What time did Fischbach leave your room?\n\nA: Between 1:30 and a quarter to 2, I guess.\n\nQ: Between 1:30 and a quarter to 2. Did Miss Rappe go into room 1219 before or after Fischbach left your room?\n\nA: It was after Miss Blake had come back from Tait’s, sometime between 2:30 and 3 o’clock.\n\nQ: Sometime between 2:30 and 3 o’clock. And what time was it—withdraw that. You say that you told somebody to tell Mr. Fortlouis that the reporters were coming up to your room?\n\nA: Uh huh (affirmative).\n\nQ: Who did you tell?\n\nA: I told Mr. Sherman, I believe.\n\nQ: And when did you tell him that?\n\nA: Oh, I can’t just remember when.\n\nQ: You can’t remember when it was. Did Mr. Fortlouis leave your room?\n\nA: Yes, but I don’t know when he left.\n\nQ: You don’t know when he left. Well, how long after you told Mr. Sherman to tell him that the reporters were coming upstairs did he leave? Did he leave alone?\n\nA: I can’t remember; I don’t know when he left.\n\nQ: You don’t know when he left. Did he leave before or after Miss Rappe went into room 1221?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Did you see Mr. Semnacher again after he went out with Miss Blake?\n\nA: He was in and out all afternoon. I can’t—I couldn’t tell you anything about him at all.\n\nQ: Now you say that Miss Blake came in in about a half an hour or so; is that what you said?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: How do you fix that?\n\nA: That is just a judge of time; I don’t know; I couldn’t tell you; it seemed to me.\n\nQ: When did you next see her after she went to rehearsal?\n\nA: When she came back to the room.\n\nQ: What was she doing? What was the occasion? What attracted your attention to her? Did you see her come in?\n\nA: Not that I remember; she just appeared in the room.\n\nQ: All of a sudden you discovered she was there?\n\nA: She was back.\n\nQ: Right in the middle of the crowd again?\n\nA: Yes, she was there.\n\nQ: Now, after you had discovered that Miss Blake had returned and Miss Rappe was in the room, what did you do? Play some more music?\n\nA: Yes; the music was going.\n\nQ: Did you dance after that?\n\nA: I think I danced with Miss Blake, yes; I am not sure.\n\nQ: Do you remember if, after you discovered Miss Blake had returned to this room, of changing any of the phonograph records yourself?\n\nA: Yes, I think I did; I changed—\n\nQ: How many?\n\nA: Whoever was closest to it; I don’t know.\n\nQ: You don’t remember what you did. As a matter of fact, you don’t remember how long it was after Miss Rappe went into room 1221 that you went into 1219?\n\nA: Well, I couldn’t tell you exactly; no.\n\nQ: But your recollection is it was five or ten minutes?\n\nA: I believe, I don’t know; it might have been more or less.\n\nQ: It might have been less?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: It might have been as little as two or three minutes, isn’t that a fact?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Well, it might have been that short a period of time?\n\nA: I couldn’t tell you, because that is the last time I saw her, when she went into 1221.\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: As a matter of fact, was it only a minute or two?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Do you recall doing anything from the time that Miss Rappe went into room 1221 until you went into room 1219?\n\nA: Yes, certainly.\n\nQ: What did you do?\n\nA: I put—changed a record on the phonograph; I think I danced with Miss Blake; I am not sure what I did.\n\nQ: Then you don’t recall what you did; you don’t recall doing anything?\n\nA: I was around the room; I don’t just exactly know what I was doing.\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: You don’t know what you were doing or how long a time elapsed—is that it?\n\nA: I couldn’t tell you.\n\nQ: And what time was it that you entered the room 1219?\n\nA: About 3 o’clock.\n\nQ: About 3 o’clock? And how was it that knew it was 3 o’clock?\n\nA: I looked at the clock.\n\nQ: You looked at what clock?\n\nA: On the mantel.\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: Isn’t it a fact that the clock was not running when you looked at it?\n\nA: (laughs) No, sir; that is not so.\n\nQ: Are you certain the clock was correct?\n\nA: Well, everything else in the hotel is pretty good, so I supposed the clock was all right.\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: What time was Mrs. Taube coming back?\n\nA: She said she would call back; she didn’t say any particular time.\n\nQ: Then you didn’t know whether she was coming back about 3 o’clock or not, did you?\n\nA: She said she was.\n\nQ: Oh, what time did she say she was coming back?\n\nA: I told her when she came up. I says, “Mr. Fischbach has got my car; is going to use my car; when he comes back we will go riding.” And she says, “Where is he going?” I says, “He is going to the beach and back.” She says, “I will come back after a while.”\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: And, as a matter of fact, when you arose on the 5th of September and went into the bathroom to clean up, it was your intention then to get ready and go out riding with Mrs. Taube?\n\nA: When she came in.\n\nQ: When she came in?\n\nA: There was no particular time set; it was just for the afternoon.\n\nQ: But you did not get dressed at that time?\n\nA: No, these people kept coming in, and I was trying to be sociable.\n\nQ: With whom?\n\nA: With them.\n\nQ: They were not your guests?\n\nA: No, I didn’t want to insult them.\n\nQ: You didn’t invite them there, did you?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: With the exception of Miss Rappe, you didn’t know anybody that was coming there at that time, any of these young ladies?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: You did not invite them?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And you didn’t tell anyone else to invite them?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And they were not your guests?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And you had an appointment to take Mrs. Taube out riding?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And still you figured you couldn’t go away without insulting those people, is that right?\n\nA: No, I figured I couldn’t go away until Mr. Fischbach came back with my car.\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: And you don’t know what you did after that; and you don’t know how long a time elapsed after that before you went into room 1219?\n\nA: No, I suppose I did what I had been doing; there was music and dancing and kidding around the room.\n\nQ: You’ve heard the other witnesses testify on the stand to that time, haven’t you?\n\nA: I’m not telling their testimony.\n\nQ: Well, refresh your memory and don’t argue about it. You say it was 3 o’clock when you went into room 1219 and that this was a little after you noticed Miss Rappe go into room 1221—when did you see Miss Rappe come out of room 1221 and go into 1219?\n\nA: I didn’t see her leave room 1221.\n\nQ: How long after you saw Miss Rappe go into 1221 did you go into 1219?\n\nA: I don’t remember; it may have been five or ten minutes. I’ll guess for you if you wish, but I couldn’t say exactly.\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: And you had an appointment to take Mrs. Taube out riding?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And still you figured you couldn’t go away without insulting those people, is that right?\n\nA: No, I figured I couldn’t go away until Mr. Fischbach came back with my car.\n\nQ: Now, isn’t it a fact, Mr. Arbuckle, that Mrs. Taube came into room 1220 in the St. Francis Hotel on the 5th day of September, between the hours of 1 and 2 o’clock in the afternoon thereof, before Mr. Fischbach had left your rooms and used your car?\n\nA: No, sir, I don’t think so.\n\nQ: You are positive of that, are you?\n\nA: No, I would not be positive.\n\nQ: You wouldn’t be positive. Then are you positive that you told Mrs. Taube that Mr. Fischbach was out using your care when she arrived at your rooms?\n\nA: I don’t know whether I told her he was, or he was going to use it. I know I gave him my word he could have my car. I told her words to that effect.\n\nQ: You don’t know whether you told her that he did have or he was going to have your car?\n\nA: I gave her to understand that he was going to use the car for a while.\n\nQ: Had you and Mrs. Taube decided on any particular place to go driving on this 5th of September?\n\nA: No particular place.\n\nQ: No particular place at all?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And all that Mr. Fischbach wanted your car for was to go out and look at seal rocks?\n\nA: Not seal rocks; he was going out to look at some seals that he was going to use in a picture.\n\nQ: Some seals. Those seals were where, did he tell you?\n\nA: By the beach.\n\nQ: And you don’t know how long a time elapsed from the time that Miss Rappe went into room 1221 until you went into 1219?\n\nMcNab: If the court please, we are supposed to end this trial sometime. I object to the same questions being asked more than ten times.\n\nCourt: Proceed with the examination.\n\nFriedman: Very well, answer the question.\n\nArbuckle: What was it? (Question read by the reporter.)\n\nSchmulowitz: I object to the question on the ground it has been asked and answered several times, if the court please.\n\nCourt: Objection overruled.\n\nArbuckle: No, I couldn’t tell you.\n\nFriedman: Can you recall of speaking to anyone at all from the time that Miss Rappe went into room 1221 until you went into room 1219?\n\nA: Me speaking to anyone? Can I recall me speaking? If there was people in there, I suppose I spoke to them.\n\nQ: Can you recall of speaking to anyone, not what you suppose you did? Have you any recollection, any memory upon it all?\n\nA: If there were people in the room, I would speak to them.\n\nFriedman [to Louderback]: We ask that the answer be stricken out as not responsive, and ask that the witness be directed to answer the question.\n\nCourt: It goes out.\n\nArbuckle: I spoke to people.\n\nFriedman: Who did you speak to?\n\nA: Miss Blake.\n\nQ: You spoke to Miss Blake?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Who else, if anyone?\n\nA: I don’t know. I suppose Miss Pyvvon [sic], or whoever was in there at the time; I don’t know.\n\nQ: Who do you remember speaking to, not what you suppose?\n\nA: Well, I spoke to whoever was in the room.\n\nQ: Whoever was in the room; and if there were five people in the room, you spoke to the whole five of them?\n\nA: I don’t think there were five people.\n\nQ: If there were three people in the room, you spoke to the three of them; is that correct?\n\nA: I might have spoken to them, yes.\n\nQ: Who was in the room when Miss Rappe went into room 1221?\n\nA: Miss Blake, I think Miss Pyvvon was, possibly Mr. Sherman. I don’t recollect.\n\nQ: And you recall speaking to Miss Blake during that period of time?\n\nA: Yes.[14]\n\n[Order inferred]\n\nQ: Do you recall speaking to Mr. Sherman during that period of time?[15]\n\nA: I say I don’t recollect whether he was there; possible he was there; possibly he was not.\n\nQ: Then you have no recollection of whether you spoke to him?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Do you recall what you said to Miss Rappe at that time?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Now, prior to your going into room 1219 and locking the door, as you have testified to—\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Did you tell anyone who was in either one of these three rooms what you were going into room 1219 for?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: You didn’t tell anyone you were going to get dressed?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Just walked in and locked the door?\n\nA: Walked in.\n\nQ: And locked the door?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: When you spoke to Miss Blake just before going into room 1219, you didn’t tell her what you were going into 1219 for?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Never said a word to her about it?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Did you tell anyone that you were going to leave?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: And at 3 o’clock you decided, just without speaking to anyone about it, that you would go in and get dressed so that would be ready to go riding; is that it?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: What did you do after you entered room 1219? What was the first thing you did?\n\nA: Locked the door.\n\nQ: You locked the door; and which door?\n\nA: The door leading into 1219.\n\nQ: There are two doors; was it the door from 1219 into 1220?\n\nA: The door opening into 1219. As near as I can recollect, it had a mirror in it.\n\nQ: You don’t recall closing more than one door do you?\n\nA: No, I just closed the door and locked it.\n\n[Before the noon recess, Jane Walsh briefly took the stand to officially identify the preserved bladder of Virginia Rappe as evidence.]\n\nFriedman: Now, after Miss Rappe had gone into room 1221, did you remain in room 1220?[16]\n\nArbuckle: Yes, I was in 1220.\n\nQ: And you remained in there until you went into room 1219 as you have testified to; is that correct?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Did you at any time see Miss Rappe come out of room 1221?\n\nA: No, I didn’t see her after she went into room 1221.\n\nQ: You are positive you didn’t see her come out of room 1221?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Now, from the time that Miss Rappe went into room 1221, until you went into room 1219, will you just show on this diagram which portion of room 1220 you remained in?\n\nA: I do now know what part of the room I remained in; I was in the room.\n\nQ: And you do not know what portion of the room you remained in?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And you are positive you didn’t see Miss Rappe come out of room 1221?\n\nA: Absolutely.\n\nQ: And you remained in room 1220 all that time?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And you remained in room 1220 all that time?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And you can’t recall what you did while you were in there?\n\nA: I did the same thing as I had been doing all the afternoon.\n\nQ: But more specifically than that you cannot say?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And what was the first thing that you did after you went into room 1219?\n\nA: I closed the door and locked it.\n\nQ: And that was the door that opened in as far as room 1219 was concerned?\n\nA: I think so; I am not positive.\n\nQ: And why did you lock the door?\n\nA: I was going to get dressed.\n\nQ: Is that why you locked the door?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Is it your habit to lock that door when you to in to get dressed?\n\nA: Yes, if there is anybody in the room—the ladies were there.\n\nQ: Are you positive that is the only reason you had in locking the door?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: From 1219 to 1220?\n\nA: Yes, sir, to change my clothes and get dressed.\n\nQ: Did you bathe that morning?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Did you see Josephine Keza, the chambermaid, while you were bathing?\n\nA: I did.\n\nQ: Where were you at the time?\n\nA: I was in the bathroom, shaving. She opened the door, and then excused herself and went out.\n\nQ: Did you have your bathrobe on?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: What did you have on?\n\nA: Nothing.\n\nQ: Nothing?\n\nA: Nothing.\n\nQ: And you locked the door so you would not be disturbed while you were dressing?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: So you did not lock the door at all from room 1219 into the corridor?\n\nA: No, I did not; I never gave it a thought.\n\nQ: Why didn’t you lock the door from room 1219 out into the corridor?\n\nA: I told you I never gave it a thought.\n\nQ: All you did think about was the door between 1219 and 1220 being open, being unlocked?\n\nA: What do you mean? I locked it because there were so many coming back and forth through the rooms.\n\nQ: Well, had anybody gone out into the hall?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Do you remember Miss Rappe going in there at any time?\n\nA: No, sir, but the doors were open.\n\nQ: Now, after you had locked the door to keep those ladies out of room 1219, while you were dressing, what did you do?\n\nA: I went straight to the bathroom.\n\nQ: You went straight to the bathroom?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: What did you do then?\n\nA: Opened the door.\n\nQ: You opened the door?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And did the door open readily?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And then what occurred?\n\nA: The door struck Miss Rappe where she was lying on the floor.\n\nQ: You say the door struck Miss Rappe where she was lying on the floor?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And what was she doing at that time?\n\nA: Just holding her stomach with her hands and moaning.\n\nQ: Had she been ill up to that time?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Then what did you do?\n\nA: Then I asked her if there was anything I could do for her\n\nQ: She wanted to lie down?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Then what did you do?\n\nA: I helped her into the bedroom.\n\nQ: From the time that you picked her up off the floor—I withdraw that. From the time that you [. . .] until you helped her into 1219 [. . .]\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: She held the water that you gave her on her stomach until you got her into room 1219?\n\nA: I suppose so.\n\nQ: How did you assist her from the bathroom to the bed?\n\nA: She walked\n\nQ: She walked. Did you help her in any manner?\n\nA: I put my arm around her.\n\nQ: You put your arm around her and assisted her, and you walked off to which bed?\n\nA: To the little bed.\n\nQ: Then what did you do?\n\nA: She sat down on the edge of the bed.\n\nQ: She sat down on the edge of the bed?\n\nA: Yes; then laid over on it.\n\nQ: Then laid over on the bed. Which way was she facing?\n\nA: She was facing (going to diagram)—facing this way (indicating). She sat down here and just laid over on the bed with head toward the foot.\n\nQ: With her head toward the foot?\n\nA: Yes, sir. I picked her feet up and put them up on the bed.\n\nQ: Then what did you do?\n\nA: I went back into the bathroom.\n\nQ: You went back into the bathroom. What did you do in the bathroom?\n\nA: Well, I went back into the bathroom.\n\nQ: All right. How long were you in the bathroom?\n\nA: Three or four minutes, or a couple of minutes, I guess. I don’t know.\n\nQ: Then what did you do?\n\nA: I came out again.\n\nQ: You came out again [. . .] I take it?\n\nA: Naturally. [. . .]\n\nQ: How, after you had—after Miss Rappe had been seated on this small bed, as you have testified to, and after she lay over with her head toward the foot, and you raised her feet up upon the bed, in which portion of the bed was she lying? Was she lying in the center of the bed, on one side or the other?\n\nA: She just laid over in the bed; I didn’t notice whether she was to one side or the other.\n\nQ: But it was on the side nearest to the window of the room that she sat down; is that correct?\n\nA: Yes, sir?\n\nQ: Now, then, what did you do after you came out of the bathroom?\n\nA: I found her in between the beds.\n\nQ: You found her in between the beds after you came out of the bathroom?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And you were only in the bathroom how long?\n\nA: Three or four minutes, I guess.\n\nQ: Three or four minutes; and you found her in between the beds.

I couldn’t get to the side of her; there isn’t enough space, I just reached over like that, and picked her up and sat her over on the bed, and turned her around, and put her head upon the pillow.\n\nQ: Then what did you do?\n\nA: [. . .] Q: Did you put her feet on the bed?\n\nA: I put her whole body on the bed.\n\nQ: [. . .] A: I didn’t notice it particularly.

Didn’t you say anything?\n\nA: Yes, that the girl was sick and to get her another room.\n\nQ: Did you tell Mr. Boyle what caused her sickness?\n\nA: No, how would I know what caused her sickness?\n\nQ: Now, when you came out of room 1219 to room 1220 and said that Miss Rappe was sick, did you tell Miss Prevost or Mrs. Delmont what was the matter with her?\n\nA: No, I just said she was sick.\n\nQ: You just said she was sick?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: You didn’t say anything else?\n\nA: Not that I remember.\n\nQ: Now, did anybody ask you what was the matter with Miss Rappe?\n\nA: I cannot remember whether they did, or not.\n\nQ: You cannot remember?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: And you cannot remember of telling anybody about her illness except that she was ill?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: You didn’t tell anybody that you found her in the bathroom?\n\nA: No, sir, nobody asked me.\n\nQ: Did you see anybody give Miss Rappe anything to drink after you had gone into room 1220 from room 1219?\n\nA: No, I did not.\n\nQ: Do you know whether or not anybody gave her some bicarbonate of soda?\n\nA: I do not know.\n\nQ: You didn’t tell anybody that you had found Miss Rappe upon the floor between the two beds, did you?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: You didn’t tell anybody that you had placed her on a bed, and that she had fallen off while holding her abdomen and moaning with pain, did you?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Now, did you hear Miss Rappe make any statement of any kind, of any kind at all from the time that you found her upon the floor in the bathroom in room 1219 until you assisted in carrying her to room 1227?\n\nA: No, sir, just heard her moan and groan.\n\nQ: You just heard her moan and groan?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: She asked you for some water, didn’t she?\n\nA: Yes, that was in the bathroom\n\nQ: You understand that?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Did she say anything else to you?\n\nA: No, sir, excepting that she wanted to lie down for a little while.\n\nQ: You had changed your clothes you say?\n\nA: Yes, sir, after Miss Rappe was taken to room 1227, I changed my clothes.[19]\n\nQ: You dressed?\n\nA: No sir, I had on a pair of golf trousers, and a soft shirt.\n\nQ: You dressed in a pair of golf trousers and soft shirt?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And around 8:30 or 9 o’clock you changed again?\n\nA: Yes, sir, and put on a dinner suit.\n\nQ: And that is the way you went down to the ballroom and stayed there until after 12 that night, is it?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: What was Miss Rappe doing when you entered room 1219?\n\nA: Which time?\n\nQ: After you had been talking to Mrs. Taube in room 1220.\n\nA: She was lying on the little bed.\n\nQ: She was lying on the little bed?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And was that before or after Mr. Boyle came—\n\nA: (interrupting) That was before.\n\nQ: Before Mr. Boyle arrived?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Now, how long after Mrs. Taube had phoned for Mr. Boyle was it before Mr. Boyle appeared in your room?\n\nA: Just a few minutes, I guess.\n\nQ: And how long after you came out of room 1219 was it that you had Mrs. Taube phone for Mr. Boyle?\n\nA: I came out of room 1219 and talked with Mrs. Taube; then went back into room 1219, and then went back and asked Mrs. Taube to telephone.\n\nQ: All right.

You can answer that yes or no.\n\nA: Yes, that is where I found her.\n\nQ: Well, did anyone named Minnie Edwards come into your rooms on the day in question, the 5th of September?[20]\n\nA: Not that I can remember of.\n\nQ: Do you know anyone named Minnie Edwards?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Now, after Mr. Boyle had come in and you had gone to the closet in room 1219, and after you had got this bathrobe or cover, what did you do then?\n\nA: Mrs. Delmont and I put it around Miss Rappe.\n\nQ: Mrs. Delmont and you put this bathrobe around Miss Rappe?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And then what occurred?\n\nA: I picked her up in my arms.\n\nQ: And then what happened?\n\nA: Mr. Boyle opened the door and we went out into the hall.\n\nQ: And did you notice how Mr. Boyle opened the door?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Did you pay any particular attention to his opening of the door?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Do you know whether or not the door was open?\n\nA: I know it was open in the morning—when Mr. Fischbach went out.\n\nQ: You never looked at the door any time after Mr. Fischbach left in the morning to see whether or not it had been locked?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: And after you opened the door from room 1219 to room 1220, you didn’t go over to the door to the corridor to see whether it was unlocked or locked, did you?\n\nA: No, sir, I never paid any attention to it; never gave it a thought.\n\nQ: Now, from the time that you found Miss Rappe in the bathroom of room 1219, until she was removed into 1227, you never told anyone in those rooms on that day that you had found her in the bathroom upon the floor, did you?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Did you tell anyone on the 5th day of September in these rooms at the St. Francis hotel, anyone at all, that you had found Miss Rappe lying between the large bed and the small bed in room 1219, apparently writhing in pain?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: You never told that to anyone?\n\nA: No, sir, I just said she was sick.\n\nQ: Did you tell anyone that on the 5th day of September you had picked Miss Rappe up off the floor and placed her upon the large bed, and that [. . .] ?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: When was the first time you told anybody that you had found Miss Rappe in the bathroom of room 1219?\n\nA: I told Mr. Dominguez.\n\nQ: You told who?\n\nA: Mr. Dominguez.\n\nQ: Mr. Dominguez?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And who is Mr. Dominguez?\n\nA: He is an attorney.\n\nQ: And when did you tell him that?\n\nA: I told him when I came up here.\n\nQ: And when was that?\n\nA: After we came up here.\n\nQ: Well, when, what part of the month, what day of the month?\n\nA: What day of the month?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: I couldn’t tell you what day of the month it was; it was after I came up here.\n\nQ: Well, how long after the 5th of September?\n\nA: I told it to him when I was put in jail; I told him the whole story.\n\nQ: You told him in jail?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And from the time that you found Miss Rappe in the bathroom in room 1219, until you told your story to Mr. Dominguez in jail in this city and county, had you ever told anybody that you had found Miss Rappe in the bathroom of 1219, upon the floor, and that she had been vomiting.\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: And from the time that you told it to Mr. Dominguez in the jail here, when was the next time that you ever told that to anyone?\n\nA: I told it to Mr. McNab.\n\nQ: And with the exception—Mr. McNab is your counsel, is he not?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And with the exception of your counsel, have you ever told that to anyone?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nFriedman: That is all.\n\nMcNab: That is all.\n\n(Recess of twenty minutes)\n\nArbuckle is recalled and cross-examination resumed.\n\nFriedman: Mr. Arbuckle, you have stated that you returned to San Francisco after the affair of September 5.\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Who did you come to San Francisco with?\n\nA: Mr. Dominguez, myself and my chauffeur, and Mr. Anger.\n\nQ: And that was before you were first placed in the city prison, as you have testified to?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And you arrived in San Francisco what hour of the night?\n\nA: I couldn’t say; I guess around 9 o’clock—between 8 and 9 o’clock.\n\nQ: Between 8 and 9 o’clock that night. Now, isn’t it a fact, Mr. Arbuckle, that on the night you arrived in San Francisco, as you have been testifying to, about 10 o’clock that night, in the office of Captain Matheson, captain of detectives of this city and county, that you were asked what had occurred in room 1219 on the 5th day of September of the present year, and you replied that you refused to answer upon the advice of counsel?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: And had you told your counsel what had occurred in room 1219 prior to that time?\n\nMcNab: If the court please, that is invading the province of counsel, and it is a privileged communication, and has no right to go into the invasion of the confidence between attorney and client.\n\nThe Court: I think that had been answered heretofore, anyway. The objection will be sustained.\n\nFriedman: That is all.\n\nMcNab: That is all.\n\n[1] The original transcript uses the German spelling Fischbach—probably due to Arbuckle’s pronunciation—even though the name had been anglicized to Fishback as early as 1918 in reaction to the anti-German sentiments of the First World War.\n\n[2] McNab misspeaks here, since he wanted Arbuckle to deny that he had organized the party, invited guests, supplied the liquor, and so on.\n\n[3] The reference to “another lady” may refer to a “a wealthy and socially prominent Eastern woman” who, according to McNab, fled San Francisco as soon as the Arbuckle case made headlines.\n\n[4] The “Court” is Judge Harold Louderback of the Superior Court of San Francisco County.\n\n[5] The San Francisco Bulletin has “She had been ill.” That the prosecution didn’t have Arbuckle’s assertion—that Rappe had vomited—stricken from the record. Rappe’s vomitus makes for a serious oversight here and elsewhere in the Arbuckle case because no other witness besides Arbuckle suggests such copious amounts were disgorged that left no smell or trace in room 1219. (Nor does it help research that newspaper editors considered the v-word in bad taste, as if it might induce nausea on the part of readers.)\n\n[6] Note that the previous animus between Delmont and Arbuckle doesn’t impede their cooperation here.\n\n[7] But he had. When he found her in 1219’s bathroom, Rappe asked for water, to lie down, and said she had these “spells.” Friedman’s cross-examination didn’t question this inconsistency.\n\n[8] Sidi Wirt Spreckels, the widow of John Spreckels Jr., a San Francisco socialite and Rappe’s friend.\n\n[9] Friedman curiously falls back to using Zey Prevost’s professional name in early September.\n\n[10] This is an instance where Arbuckle intentionally doesn’t answer the question.\n\n[11] The San Francisco Bulletin transcript ends here.\n\n[12] The San Francisco Call transcript ends here.\n\n[13] Where indicated, the cross-examination’s questions and answers are inferred due to differences in newspaper transcripts.\n\n[14] The San Francisco Examiner transcript ends here.\n\n[15] The remainder of the composite transcript is largely based on the Chronicle version. The newspaper used two bold dots for ellipses or omissions, whether intended or unintended. In their place are conventional bracketed ellipses.\n\n[16] This is approximately where the cross-examination resumed after the noon recess.\n\n[17] Likely a transcription error here—recall that Arbuckle said she was “ill” while lying on the small bed, Friedman actually pinpoints an inconsistency but doesn’t give it anymore emphasis.\n\n[18] The transcript is “silent” in regard to Arbuckle’s response. Given the context of where the transcript picks up below, a brief passage of the cross-examination seems to be missing.\n\n[19] According to Betty Campbell, a party guest who arrived after 4:00 p.m. and after Rappe had been taken to room 1227, Arbuckle was still dressed in pajamas and bath robe.\n\n[20] This name is introduced for the first time in the Arbuckle case—possibly a red herring to test the witness.\n\nSources: "
