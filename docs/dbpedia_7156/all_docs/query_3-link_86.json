        "text": "Thanks for joining the virtual food tour last week. Here’s a wrap up with a few extra pictures incase you missed anything!\n\nDay 1: Red Bull Ice Cream Run\n\nI kicked the party with veggie dishes, street food and an emergency red bull ice cream run!\n\nSoi Yotse itself is good enough for a one stop food tour if you’re looking for something different one evening and can handle the challenge of getting there. There’s still tons of things there we didn’t try. Go and let us know what you eat! Or if you book a private food tour with Mark, request Soi Yotse and funky flavored ice cream.\n\nDay 2: Let’s Raise $2000 and Help Tareq Fulfill His Dream\n\nGreat news!\n\nOur friend Tareq, who was the victim of human trafficking, is now the featured story on HopeMob!\n\nThis is your chance to make a difference in this guy’s life. No long speech from me, no excuses from you. Visit his story, donate and share!\n\nWe’ll help him get sent to culinary school and begin his life again. Visit HopeMob for more.\n\nDay 3: Timezone Jumping at Sukhumvit 11’s Craze in Aloft\n\nAloft is a futuristic looking place. We checked out their wine buffet.\n\nBecause they’re new they’re always having random deals. We’re editing a video of us munching down their buffet and there may even be a chance to go back and try their bizarre molecular cocktails.\n\nSee their restaurant Crave’s, facebook page to see what’s happening.\n\nDay 4: The Local, Bangkok’s Food Museum on Sukhumvit 23\n\nThe Local Restaurant by Oam Thong takes you back in time.\n\nAdvanced Thai food lovers will dig it. They have a garden where they grow ingredients that aren’t found in Bangkok to make their specialty dishes from around the country.\n\nCheck out the fish they stewed for thirty hours for us. So tasty and you could chew right through the bones. Check out the article for more of what we ate there and we’ll publish a video for you later.\n\nDay 5: The Home Invasion\n\nFor the final day we got off the streets and into the home of a local blogger.\n\nThere we ate some really tasty food and met some interesting people. If you’re interested in doing something similar start your own in your city or watch the Mango Ginger website for news of their next event.\n\n——-"
