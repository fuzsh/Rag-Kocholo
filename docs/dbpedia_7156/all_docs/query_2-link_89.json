I had no intentions of getting a new bike but I recently rode with a few guys who were on fat bikes and I got the itch. If anyone has any leads on anything in stock anywhere I‚Äôd appreciate a heads up.\n\nBuy a medium RSD Mayor with a Mastodon fork and then sell it to me when you decide fat bikes are stupid.\n\nThe pricing seems reasonable. Is this what you would recommend to someone that is fat curious? Asking for myself.\n\nNot too much around. I know Canyon just got Dudes in stock because they posted it on the Social Medias.\n\nThe Dude isn't really doing much for me. Looks like pretty mediocre build at best, especially for the price point.\n\nAnd Reeb Donkadonk would be somewhat quicker being US made.\n\nThat looks like a pretty sweet bike but too much $$$.\n\nBuy a medium RSD Mayor with a Mastodon fork and then sell it to me when you decide fat bikes are stupid.\n\nThose look pretty nice and have more modern geo. The complete bikes are sold out but, surprisingly, I was able to pre-order a frame/fork in size large. You're gonna have to grow a few inches if you want to try and convince me it's stupid. üòù\n\nNow I need to to figure out if I want 26or 27.5 wheels and get some built. I predict a visit to @jimvreeland is in my future.\n\nThose look pretty nice and have more modern geo.

Is this what you would recommend to someone that is fat curious? Asking for myself.\n\nI'd rather it was carbon, but that'll probably be my next bike. I rode a friend's older generation Mayor for a few weeks and liked it.\n\nBuy a medium and then sell it to me when you decide fat bikes are stupid üòõ\n\ni was tempted....\n\nas an aside - these suckers are teeth rattling stiff. changed the ride of the bike.\n\nI've only test ridden a pair around the lot. That was enough to know they'd never work for me. Like having a 2x4 shoved up your ass for fun. Which is perfectly acceptable if you really like 2x4s.\n\nI've only test ridden a pair around the lot.
