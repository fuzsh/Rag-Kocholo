        "text": "​​A. A friend of mine saw a white turkey with a flock of wild birds. Is the white bird an escaped domestic turkey?\n\nThe white hen is probably a color phase known as the smoky-gray. From a distance, these birds appear to be white, though they are not albino. They have dark eyes and normal-colored legs. Up close you can actually see all the colors of the typical eastern wild turkey. However, the colors are muted or ghost-like, making the bird appear white or light gray. This color phase is a recessive trait and it is likely that the bird's mother was a typically colored wild turkey. However, both her mother and her father had a recessive gene for this color phase. So, it is likely that the offspring of the light colored hen would be of typical color. She would have to mate with a gobbler that had the recessive trait in order to produce white poults and the chances of that happening are pretty slim.\n\nB. Are other odd colors ever seen in real wild turkeys?\n\nYes, three other recessive traits for coloration occur occasionally in wild turkeys, but few people will ever see them.\n\nTrue albinism is extremely uncommon and has only been reported a handful of times. Such birds are pure white with pink eyes.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the melanistic or black color phase. A melanistic wild turkey is very dark in color and areas that are typically light colored on the bird would be dark as well.\n\nAn erythristic or red color phase is seen occasionally.\n\nC. Why do some hens have beards?\n\nTurkey beards are specialized structures of the skin that arise from a raised area of skin called a papilla. While all hens have a papilla, only around 10 percent (1 to 29 percent, depending on the population) actually have a beard. Hen beards tend to be shorter and thinner than gobbler beards. Bearded hens are able to reproduce successfully.\n\nD. How common are multiple beards?\n\nFewer than 10 percent of gobblers have more than one beard. In the case of multiple beards, the gobbler has more than one papilla and a different beard emerges from each one.\n\nE. Are blond beards unusual?\n\nTypically, turkey beards are dark gray or black in color. Sometimes hunters note a white residue on the beard. This residue is a waxy substance that adheres to the bristles as the beard grows out of the papilla. It is usually confined to the first few inches of the beard. Lighter colors are sometimes seen on other portions of the beard. The most common are bands of amber (orange) or blond across the beard horizontally. These light colors are likely areas of less melanin, the dark pigment that colors the beard. The lack of melanin may be a dietary deficiency or it may be inherited. In any case, the lighter colors indicate areas of weakness in the beard that may be more likely to break off. On occasion the whole beard will be blond or amber in color.\n\nF. Is it possible for gobblers to have multiple spurs?\n\nMultiple spurs are quite rare. Only one in perhaps a thousand gobblers has more than one spur on each leg. Double- and triple-spurred gobblers have been reported.\n\nG. Why do some birds have white in their tail feathers?\n\nThe white barring or markings on the central tail feathers of a gobbler occurs with some regularity on adult gobblers. It is estimated that about 10 percent of gobblers exhibit this kind of barring on their central tail feathers. The white barring is usually confined to the central two or three pairs of retrices or major tail feathers. This odd coloration is sometimes observed on jakes and occasionally noted in adult hens. It is not restricted to eastern wild turkeys. Biologists have noted white barring on the central tail feathers of Merriams turkeys, Rio Grande wild turkeys and the Florida or Osceola subspecies, too.\n\nBiologists theorize that this coloration may be caused by a dietary deficiency. Poultry experts have documented feather color abnormalities in domestic fowl and traced those abnormalities to vitamin deficiency. A dietary deficiency may be associated with the condition of the wild turkey when those feathers are growing. The central tail feathers are molted in mid-summer when many other feathers are being replaced. The demand for nutrients to grow feathers may exceed the availability of those nutrients when the molt is occurring in some birds or in certain years resulting in the barring of the tail feathers.\n\nA. Do turkeys die during harsh winters?\n\nNot typically in Pennsylvania - The Pennsylvania Game Commission has not documented any severe turkey winter mortaility since the three consecutive severe winters of 1976-78. Possible disease transmission from concentrated feeding sites.\n\nB. Should I feed turkeys during the winter? Will winter-feeding increase turkey winter survival?\n\nNo Winter Feeding Policy and Hixon 1997 paper (PDF)\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission has a policy of no winter feeding of wildlife. The Game Commission used to have a winter feeding program, but abandoned it because it is ineffective and impractical, and scientific studies of winter feeding programs are almost universal in pointing out the large numbers of disadvantages as opposed to a very few advantages.\n\n(In 1997, a Game Commission intern, Raymond Hixson, developed a report on winter feeding of deer and turkeys, and I will provide the highlights on turkeys.) Turkeys, like deer and other wildlife that are active during winter, have adaptations that help their survival. Fat tissues comprise 25 percent of winter body weights in adult turkeys and 15 percent in juveniles. The increased winter fat serves as an energy reserve and as added insulation, thereby improving survival. Body weight losses of 35 percent in adult wild turkeys and 25 percent in juveniles can result in death, although some wild turkeys may lose a third of their body weight without any devastating effects. Adults have a survival edge over juvenile birds due to greater adipose and muscle tissue reserves. Turkey hens survive longer than males when exposed to severe cold in fasting conditions. Although males may have greater fat reserves, females need relatively less food.\n\nEffects of snow on food availability and turkey mobility are more important to survival than temperature alone. Natural winter turkey food is primarily hard mast that is found on the ground. They also eat ferns, bulbs, and tubers, as well as grass and it's seeds, corn and grains, and what they can pick out of manure that is spread in fields. Vegetation and insects in and along spring seeps also are important. Turkeys often will frequent and roost in conifer stands on sunny slopes where snow melts quickly and bottom areas where terrain moderates the prevailing westerly winds.\n\nBeside other factors, disease transmission is a threat with winter-feeding. Aflatoxicosis, a condition where toxins produced by fungi on spoiled feed, particularly grains, cause wildlife mortality, and may affect turkeys.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission has conducted extensive field research regarding winter-feeding of wild turkeys. In a 19-year study in the Potato Creek drainage of McKean County to determine the effect of supplemental winter-feeding on wild turkey populations, winter turkey losses of up to 30 percent were found during severe winters with fluffy snow conditions, despite supplemental feeding in portions of the study area. Losses of up to 60 percent were documented in higher elevations. Populations usually recovered in one or two years, except during the period of three consecutive severe winters (1976-78), which resulted in depressed populations for three years before showing signs of recovery.\n\nTwo hunting preserves with controlled hunting in Elk County were evaluated. Expensive, intensive feeding programs were conducted. Food was distributed regularly along plowed roads. In one preserve, 150-200 turkeys consistently fed along roads. Following the three successive severe winters, the entire preserve was searched on foot and snowmobile. Only 16 turkeys were found in 1978 despite continual feeding programs. Turkey losses were attributed to winter mortality and poor recruitment. A similar decline occurred on the other preserve. Intensive feeding programs did not prove effective.\n\nIn one Pennsylvania study, turkey populations were more dependent on the previous summer's reproductive success than upon the mildness of the preceding winter or the number of breeders available. Other research has confirmed these results.\n\nIt is not necessarily winter survival that impacts populations, but rather, the success of summer reproduction. Cold, wet springs have the most detrimental effect on survival of turkey poults. Young birds are not only susceptible to hypothermia, but also, cold, wet springs delay insect emergence. Insects comprise the majority of a young poult's diet. Hens that come into the spring in good condition have a greater probability of renesting if their initial nest attempt fails. Therefore, good winter habitat as well as good brood habitat are the most important factors for turkey populations.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission stresses the necessity for habitat management and is extensively engaged in habitat improvement projects designed to provide more natural winter foods for wildlife. The Game Commission does plow State Game Lands roads primarily to open travel lanes and uncover planted food plots for wildlife. The Game Commission suggests that people and clubs develop habitat improvement projects that provide long-term habitat improvement and increase the carrying capacity of the habitat. Examples are planting mast and fruit producing trees and shrubs and protecting the plantings until large enough to survive deer browsing. Planting evergreen cover to provide winter thermal cover also is beneficial. Browse cutting along roadsides as well as timbering to provide regeneration also are beneficial, as well as maintaining spring seeps, which are very important feeding areas for wildlife during severe winters."
