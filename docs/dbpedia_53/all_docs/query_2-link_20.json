The Lewis Cass farm, purchased from the Macomb family, was one of the largest Detroit farms, the width of Cass to Third Street and north from the Detroit River to Grand Boulevard in length. The 500 acres bought for $12,000 and the subsequent growth of Detroit made Cass a very wealthy man.\n\nCass came to Detroit as a schoolmaster in the early 1800s and became a lawyer, a colonel in the militia, and a general in the U.S. Army.\n\nIn 1813 President James Madison appointed Cass the second governor of the Michigan territory, a post he held for 18 years.

Nicholas divided the land between his children (including his son, Stephen).\n\nStephen Young's great-grandson, Jeffery Young writes, ''I believe that Celestine Street was named for my grandfather Celestine Young (Stephen's son and Thomas Constance's great uncle.) The story goes that my grandfather, Celestine approx. 8 years old at the time, was standing at the corner of Young Street and a cross road that was under construction when he overheard the workers stating that they didn't have a name for the new street. He then said 'How about Celestine?' and the name stuck.''\n\nJeffery sent this photo of his father, Celestine Charles Young, standing at the intersection of Celestine and Young in June of 2014.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jeffery T.

A creek crossed the road near the tavern and overflowed onto the road in the spring. When the festive set of Detroit wanted some merry-making, they usually went up to Cliff's place and crossed over the creek by means of stepping stones. When the roisterers returned they had great difficulty keeping on the stones, so they would return to town wet to their knees (sometimes even elbows). The townspeople referred to the crossing as \"Cliff's ford.\" It first appeared on a map published by John Farmer in 1835.\"\n\nhttp://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=199#ixzz0qOP2Vxki\n\nClifton AvenueClinton StreetClippert StreetClough StreetCloverdale AvenueCloverlawn AvenueClyde AvenueCobalt StreetCobb PlaceNamed for Ty Cobb.Codding StreetCody AvenueCoe StreetColburn PlaceColby StreetColeman Avenue (Spw)Colfax AvenueCollege Avenue/StreetCollingham DriveCollingwood AvenueCollins Avenue (Ham)\n\nHamtramck\n\nColonial AvenueColorado Avenue (HP)Named for the state of Colorado.\n\nHighland Park\n\nColton AvenueColumbia Avenue E-WMary Bailey of the Detroit News writes: \"John R, Elizabeth and Columbia streets are named for personal reasons.

Schoolcraft.Schroeder AvenueSchuper StreetSchuper Street no longer exists, but when it did it was the 'shortest' (in distance) of any 'named' road in the entire City of Detroit. It connected Lakepointe to Barham (East Side between Chandler Park and E. Warren). It was named after the family that owned the lot. The city asked if they could purchase back the property to build the road. It was necessary because the homes on Barham (South Side) looked across the street at the garage(s) for the Homes that were on Maryland Road. Barham was the only street in Detroit that was a 'mistake' in planning (not enough property for homes on both sides of the street), so Schuper was created to accommodate the garbage trucks that started there route on Lakepointe.\n\nThanks to Leif A.
