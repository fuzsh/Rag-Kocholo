        "text": "The Early Days\n\nEugène Prévost, a cabinet maker from Sainte-Claire, Quebec, specialized in making church pews and school furniture. His foray into motorized vehicles capitalized on his carpentry skills. In 1924, he received a commission to build a wooden coach body to mount on an REO truck chassis. This initial order led to many others, and the company grew. In 1937, Prevost built a bus manufacturing facility in Sainte-Claire. Always the innovator, Eugène introduced the first all-metal body over an all-metal skeleton eight years later.\n\nReplica 1924\n\nFor years, André Turmel, one of Eugène’s grandsons, dreamed of recreating the very first Prevost ever made. As Prevost’s 100th anniversary approached, the family came together to turn this dream into reality.\n\nThe dream blossomed into a collective endeavor—a testament to Eugène’s values of unity and collaboration. “We supported each other, just like Eugène. That’s how he viewed life, in my opinion,” said André.\n\nThe quest was a labor of love, beginning with the search for the same truck chassis Eugène used. The journey led them to Tampa Bay, Florida, where they unearthed a period REO chassis. With diligent hands and generous hearts, they planned its journey back to Quebec.\n\nHowever, the return trip to Canada wasn’t without adventure. It turned out to be a race against the clock.\n\nTransporting their precious cargo, they had to drive 24 hours straight from Florida to New York so they could make it to U.S. Customs to get their papers stamped and cross the border before the office closed for the weekend.\n\nOnce they were back in Canada, the next phase began.\n\nEngineering challenges abounded, particularly in synchronizing the operation of the doors and the step—a task that tested their ingenuity.\n\nThe interior layout was also a mystery since the only existing photograph showed just the exterior.\n\nHowever, thanks to meticulous research, the family knew the coach had a capacity of approximately 10 passengers. But did the seats face forward or sideways? No one could say for sure. Undeterred, the family pressed on and, after several tests, they determined the benches were positioned sideways to maximize space.\n\nSpouses and great grandchildren were also called in to help. André’s wife, Francine, applied varnish to the interior and great grandson Nicolas, who works in the paint department at Prevost, used his skills to give the coach its shiny exterior.\n\nLast but not least, a name was chosen. In honor of Eugène’s wife, who supported him in all his endeavors—even going so far as to sew vehicle cushions—the 1924 coach was christened “Clarisse.”\n\nClarisse Hits the Road\n\nWith her dark green exterior, snappy black trim, and gleaming wooden interior, Clarisse is more than a beauty; she is a canvas of memories, a bridge across generations, and a celebration of a quality that remains the family’s unwavering commitment—a commitment Eugène Prévost himself would regard with pride. In this centennial homage, the Prévost family members look not only back but also forward, reaffirming their dedication to innovation, quality, and customer value. The legacy is encapsulated not merely in the wooden curves of Clarisse but in the very DNA of the Prevost brand, promising a future as steadfast and remarkable as the past."
