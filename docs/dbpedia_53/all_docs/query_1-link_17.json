        "text": "Incidence of spoken language disorders refers to the number of new cases identified in a specified time period. No reliable data on the incidence of spoken language disorders in children were located.\n\nPrevalence of spoken language disorders refers to the number of people who are living with a spoken language disorder in a given time period. The variability in prevalence estimates below is attributed to differences in how spoken language disorders are defined, the nature of the population studied, variations in the methodological procedures used, and the over-identification and under-identification of children from historically marginalized or minoritized populations (Laing & Kamhi, 2003; Law et al., 2000; Norbury & Sparks, 2013; Pinborough-Zimmerman et al., 2007).\n\nStudies of 4- to 5-year-old children in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Germany have estimated the prevalence of any spoken language disorder, either those that occur as a primary disorder or those that are secondary to a medical condition or diagnosis, to fall between 6.6% and 20.6% (Beitchman et al., 1986; Norbury et al., 2016; Reilly et al., 2010; Weindrich et al., 2000). For 7- to 11-year-olds in Australia and Germany, the prevalence of spoken language disorder was 3.4%–18.9% (Eadie et al., 2021; McKean et al., 2017; Weindrich et al., 2000).\n\nThe following studies of developmental language disorder (DLD) estimate the prevalence of spoken language disorder that cannot be attributed to a medical diagnosis or condition. For 4- to 6-year-olds in the United Kingdom and China, the prevalence of DLD was 7.58%–8.5% (Norbury et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2023). Another study found that the prevalence of DLD was 6.4% at 10 years of age for children in Australia (Calder et al., 2022). Assuming a 7.5% prevalence rate, the estimated number of cases of DLD in the United States in 2019 was 5,461,200 (McGregor, 2020).\n\nThe prevalence of specific language impairment for kindergarten children has been widely cited as 7.4% overall in the United States (Tomblin et al., 1997). This study’s use of the term “specific language impairment” refers to children who exhibit a language disorder but score within normal limits on nonverbal intelligence tests (Tomblin et al., 1997). It should be noted that the use of intelligence test score discrepancies to determine eligibility for language services is not a practice supported by ASHA. See the Cognitive Referencing section below for further explanation and a link to ASHA’s resource on this topic.\n\nStudies reported results based on gender; however, there were no indications whether the data collected were based on sex assigned at birth and/or gender identity. In 4- to 5-year-old children, the prevalence of spoken language disorder, which may or may not be associated with a diagnosed medical condition, was higher in boys (Beitchman et al., 1986; Weindrich et al., 2000). The prevalence of DLD in 4- to 10-year-old children was also higher in boys, but the differences were not significant (Calder et al., 2022; Norbury et al., 2016).\n\nCo-Occurring Conditions or Diagnoses\n\nBehavioral Disorders\n\nFor children aged 5–13 years who had been formally identified with emotional and behavioral disorders, 81% were considered to have a language disorder, with 34% having a mild language disorder and 47% having a moderate–severe language disorder (Hollo et al., 2014).\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Executive Function Differences\n\nIn children in the United States, the rate of co-occurrence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and DLD is estimated to be 22.35% (Redmond, 2020). Compared with children without DLD diagnoses, children with DLD often demonstrate poorer executive functions (e.g., working memory, inhibition, shifting). However, there is considerable individual variability, and not all people with DLD demonstrate deficits in executive functions (Kapa & Erikson, 2019; Pauls & Archibald, 2016; Vissers et al., 2015).\n\nReading/Writing Disorder\n\nMany children with spoken language disorders also have difficulty with reading/writing. Adlof et al. (2017) found that 54% of children with DLD also had dyslexia. At the same time, 71% of children with dyslexia had DLD. Although rates vary across studies, other researchers have made similar findings. For 7- to 9-year-old children with reading disorder in Norway, 46% were found to have language disorders (Helland et al., 2016). Of children in the United States diagnosed with language disorder, 27% were classified as poor readers by the end of kindergarten (Murphy et al., 2016).\n\nAutism\n\nIn a sample of 8-year-old children on the autism spectrum in the United States, 23.6%–63.4% were found to have language disorder (Levy at al., 2010; Rubenstein et al., 2018). About 30% of school-age children and adults on the autism spectrum use only a few words or phrases (Schaeffer et al., 2023).\n\nSpeech Sound Disorders\n\nIn 4-year-olds with speech sound disorder in Australia, the comorbidity of DLD was 40.8% (Eadie et al., 2015).\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nRisk Factors Related to Social Determinants of Health\n\nSeveral studies considered language disorders in the context of factors related to social determinants of health.\n\nOne study by King et al. (2005) considered households in the United States with risk factors such as inadequate income or housing, poor prenatal care, inadequate social supports, history of substance abuse, or history of mental health issues. The authors found that 10% of 3-year-olds living in these households had severe language delays (at least 2 SDs below average on a composite language test) and 49% had at least mild language delays (1 or more SDs below average).\n\nIn an Australian cohort of 5-year-olds living in households with risk factors such as mothers with no support, poorer health, no high school degree, no household income, or no previous employment, 24.9% presented with language difficulties as defined by scoring 1.25 or more SDs below average on a core language test. Had the authors used a less conservative cutoff of 1 or more SDs below average, the prevalence would have been 32% (J. Smith et al., 2021).\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on social determinants of health.\n\nSee the Assessment section of the Spoken Language Disorders Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nScreening\n\nScreening of spoken language skills is conducted if a language disorder is suspected. Some school districts screen all children for a speech or language disorder to accelerate identification and intervention.\n\nScreening does not result in a diagnosis but rather indicates the potential need for further audiologic, language, and/or speech sound assessment.\n\nScreening typically includes the following:\n\nteacher and/or caregiver report regarding concerns about the child’s language skills\n\nhearing screening to rule out hearing loss as a possible contributing factor to language difficulties\n\nstandardized screening assessments with adequate sensitivity and specificity, if appropriate\n\ninformal measures, such as those designed by the clinician and tailored to the population being screened (e.g., preschool vs. school age/adolescence)\n\narticulation screening, if indicated\n\nMany children who have experienced trauma pass language screening tests but may still experience language problems that require intervention (Ciolino et al., 2021). See ASHA’s resource on trauma-informed care.\n\nMulti-Tiered System of Support (MTSS)\n\nA multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) is a data-driven framework to support the academic, behavioral, emotional, and social success of all students in the general and special education settings (Center on Multi-Tiered System of Supports, n.d.). Essential components of the MTSS include universal screening, progress monitoring, data-based decision making, and a multi-level prevention system (Center on Multi-Tiered System of Supports, n.d.).\n\nResponse to intervention (RTI) is an example of a three-tiered multi-level prevention system [PDF]. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) can have several roles in the RTI process to identify children with disabilities and to provide instruction to struggling students. Educators cannot use the RTI process to delay or deny an evaluation to determine if a student is eligible to receive special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, 2004).\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on RTI for more information about how SLPs can be part of the RTI process.\n\nComprehensive Assessment\n\nIf screening results indicate a need for further testing, then an SLP conducts a comprehensive and linguistically appropriate assessment. Assessment of language skills should be culturally relevant and functional and should involve the collaborative efforts of families/caregivers, classroom teachers, SLPs, special educators, cultural brokers, interpreters, and other professionals, as needed. See Assessment and Evaluation of Speech-Language Disorders in Schools. See also ASHA’s Person-Centered Focus on Function: Language Disorder [PDF] for an example of assessment data consistent with the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.\n\nAssessment typically includes the following, with consideration made for the child’s age and linguistic development.\n\nCase History\n\nThe SLP gathers relevant case history, including the following:\n\nbirth, medical, and developmental history\n\nfamily history of cognitive, speech, language, reading, or academic difficulties\n\nfamily’s concerns about the child’s language (and speech)\n\nchild’s perspectives of strengths and weaknesses\n\nlanguages and/or dialects used, including\n\nage of introduction of additional language(s), as appropriate\n\ncircumstances in which each language is used\n\nparent/caregiver perspective on how the child acquired language relative to siblings, as appropriate\n\nparent, teacher, and child self-report measures of communication and behaviors, based on reason for referral\n\nteachers’ concerns regarding the impact of the child’s language difficulties on classroom functioning\n\nclassroom- and curriculum-based assessment data\n\nOral Mechanism Examination\n\nThe oral mechanism examination evaluates the structure and function of the speech mechanism to assess whether the system is enough for speech production. This examination typically includes an assessment of\n\ndental occlusion and specific tooth deviations;\n\nstructures of the oral cavity (e.g., hard and soft palate, lingual frenulum); and\n\nfunction (strength and range of motion) of the lips, jaw, tongue, and velum.\n\nHearing Screening\n\nA hearing screening is conducted during the comprehensive assessment if one was not completed during the screening.\n\nA hearing screening typically includes\n\nan otoscopic inspection of the ear canal and tympanic membrane,\n\npure-tone audiometry, and\n\nimmittance testing to assess middle ear function.\n\nSpeech and Language Evaluation\n\nSpoken language testing may include the following domains:\n\nphonology, including phonological awareness\n\nsemantics\n\nmorphology\n\nsyntax\n\npragmatics, including discourse-level language skills (conversation, narrative, expository)\n\nAssessment is accomplished using a variety of measures and activities, including both formal and informal assessment tools. Depending on the child’s cultural and linguistic background and communication profile, these tools may or may not be standardized and may be quantitative or qualitative measures. See ASHA’s resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources.\n\nAt this time, there are few standardized assessments developed in the United States for individuals who use additional languages besides English or dialects of English outside of General American English. It is essential to consider the language(s) and dialect(s) used by the child before selecting any standardized assessment. Standard scores are not reported when an assessment has been translated or used with a population it was not intended for; however, a narrative description of performance can be provided.\n\nDynamic assessment is a language assessment method (test–teach–retest) that helps identify the person’s current skills as well as their learning potential. Individuals able to make changes or modifications to their language by learning a skill are likely to have language differences, whereas those unable to make changes to their language by learning a skill are more likely to have a language disorder. Dynamic assessment can be used in conjunction with other assessment tools to guide clinical interpretations and recommendations.\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on dynamic assessment and ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Cultural Responsiveness and Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology. See also the Spoken Language Disorders section of the Cultural and Linguistic Diversity (CLD) Evidence Map.\n\nCognition\n\nAssessing cognitive abilities, such as executive function, helps identify the individual’s strengths and weaknesses and facilitates the development of a treatment plan. Cognitive abilities are often comprehensively evaluated by other professionals, such as psychologists. Given the interaction between cognitive processes and language abilities, SLPs and those who assess broad cognitive skills collaborate as much as possible on administering and interpreting evaluation findings. See the Assessment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Executive Function Deficits.\n\nLiteracy\n\nA literacy (reading and writing) assessment is included in the comprehensive assessment for language disorders because of the well-established connection between spoken and written language. Components of a literacy assessment will vary, depending on the child’s age and stage of language development, and can include preliteracy, early literacy, and advanced literacy skills. See the Assessment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Written Language Disorders.\n\nSpeech\n\nA speech sound assessment may also be included, given that speech sound errors can be a result of a phonological disorder, an articulation disorder, or a combined phonological–articulation disorder. See the Assessment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation and Phonology.\n\nIf appropriate, an assessment of an alternative or augmentative form of communication may be conducted. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).\n\nA comprehensive assessment may result in the following:\n\nthe determination of a cultural and linguistic difference only, which would not require further evaluation or intervention\n\nthe diagnosis of a spoken language disorder (receptive language disorder only, expressive language disorder only, or expressive–receptive mixed)\n\na description of the characteristics and severity of the disorder\n\na determination of performance variability as a function of communicative situations/contexts\n\nthe identification of literacy problems\n\nthe diagnosis of a speech sound disorder\n\nthe identification of possible hearing problems\n\nrecommendations for intervention and support\n\na referral to other professionals, as needed.\n\nConsiderations For Diagnosis of Spoken Language Disorder\n\nEarly Identification\n\nNot all children with early language delay (late talkers) have significant language problems when they reach school age (Paul, 1989, 1996; Rescorla, 2002). This makes it difficult to diagnose a language disorder before the age of about 3 years (Leonard, 2014). However, given the risk that language disorders pose, it is essential to assess a child’s language skills early and to monitor these skills periodically at critical educational stages (e.g., preschool; kindergarten, second grade, and third grade; early middle school; and high school). See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Late Language Emergence.\n\nIt is especially important to periodically monitor and assess language skills if multiple risk factors are present, such as a family history of language problems, chronic otitis media, cognitive delay, social communication difficulties, and environmental risks (Paradise et al., 2000; Paul, 1996; Paul et al., 2018).\n\nDetermining Eligibility For Special Education services\n\nIn the school setting, children with spoken language disorders who meet the eligibility criteria under IDEA receive special education services through an individualized education program under the primary or secondary disability category “speech or language impairment” (IDEA, 2004). Younger children may qualify under the category “developmental delay,” whereas older children often qualify under “specific learning disability.” Eligibility criteria include a disability that adversely affects educational performance, which is not limited to academic performance. See ASHA’s resource on eligibility and dismissal in schools.\n\nStudents who have a speech or language impairment, but do not qualify for special education services under IDEA, may be eligible for a 504 plan, under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. For more information, see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Documentation in Schools and ASHA’s resource on individualized education programs (IEPs), individualized family service plans (IFSPs), and Section 504 plans.\n\nSee also The ASHA Leader article on the IDEA guidance about the eligibility of developmental language disorders under IDEA.\n\nChanging Nature of Spoken Language Disorder\n\nChildren with spoken language disorders can show different patterns of strengths and weaknesses across listening, speaking, reading, and writing, and these patterns may vary over time. In some cases, the language skills of children with spoken language disorders can seem similar to those of children without spoken language disorders.\n\nHowever, as language demands increase, difficulties may resurface in one or more language domains, especially in written language. For example, children may no longer produce verb errors in conversations but may make these errors in written assignments. This phenomenon is referred to as illusory recovery (Scarborough & Dobrich, 1990). Although children may gain new vocabulary or improve their use of grammatical forms following language intervention, they typically do not catch up to their peers. Their rate of language growth may slow or level off when they reach early adolescence, resulting in language levels below those expected for their age (Rice, 2013). Language gaps between children with spoken language disorders and their peers without spoken language disorders may widen over time, such as with vocabulary (Rice & Hoffmann, 2015).\n\nFor this reason, clinicians use valid and reliable standardized assessments with normative data—in addition to other data sources (e.g., informal measures, benchmarking, progress reports)—when evaluating the language skills of children with spoken language disorders over time. Periodic monitoring of children who have been dismissed from services is also crucial.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Considerations\n\nClinicians may face unique challenges when identifying spoken language disorders in children who are multilingual, use a language they do not use, or speak a nonmainstream dialect of English. Diagnosing spoken language disorders requires the following skills:\n\nawareness of multilingual language acquisition (simultaneous and sequential)\n\ncultural and linguistic information about named languages that the child uses\n\nfamiliarity with the patterns of the child’s dialect in their named languages\n\nFor children who speak a dialect of English, such as Appalachian English or African American English, clinicians consider the influence of dialect patterns on assessment measures—which are typically based on Mainstream American English or General American English dialect. Standard score interpretations are not valid if the norming sample of an assessment is not representative of the child being assessed or when using accommodations or modifications that are not specified in the test manual. See IDEA Part B: Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students.\n\nRather than a strictly dialect versus disorder framework, a disorder within dialect framework keeps the nature and prevalence of childhood language disorders across dialects at the forefront when considering screening, assessment, and treatment planning as well as when providing education about the services that clinicians provide (Oetting et al., 2016).\n\nMultilingualism is not a cause of speech or language disorders. In multilingual children, language dominance may vary across domains of language, and competence may vary across named languages. For example, children may exhibit receptive language dominance in one language and expressive language dominance in another. Dominance may also shift over time relative to environmental linguistic demands. For multilingual children who have language impairment, typical processes of multilingualism, such as code-mixing, will be present in their speech (Gutiérrez-Clellen et al., 2009).\n\nSigns of expressive language difficulties will be present in all languages and dialects a child uses. Morphosyntactic delays (Castilla-Earls et al., 2021; V. P. Smith et al., 2021), decreased vocabulary and semantic knowledge (Kan et al., 2020), and reduced lexical diversity in narratives (Kapantzoglou et al., 2017) can be present in the expressive language of multilingual children with developmental language disorder.\n\nThere are some learning behaviors that a student might exhibit that could represent a language difference instead of a potential learning disability. By determining the root of each student’s difficulties using multiple sources of converging evidence, clinicians are better equipped to make diagnostic decisions (Castilla-Earls et al., 2020). See Tool #2 in the U.S. Department of Education’s English Learner Toolkit, Chapter 6, for more information about English language learners across language domains and content areas.\n\nFor assistance with diagnosing spoken language disorders in children who use additional dialects and languages, see ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Cultural Responsiveness and Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology as well as ASHA’s resource on phonemic inventories and cultural and linguistic information across languages. See also the Spoken Language Disorders section of the Cultural and Linguistic Diversity (CLD) Evidence Map.\n\nDisproportionality of Identification\n\nA disproportionate number of children who speak English as an additional language or minoritized dialects of the English language have been over- or under-identified in the school setting as having a speech-language impairment (Robinson & Norton, 2019). For example, children from minoritized backgrounds who may speak non-Mainstream American English dialects are less likely to receive needed services than similar Mainstream American English– or General American English–speaking peers (Morgan et al., 2015, 2017). This disproportionality may be due to various factors, such as students classified in other IDEA disability categories (e.g., specific learning disability, emotional disturbance), cultural differences, and standardized tests based on General American English (Robinson & Norton, 2019).\n\nNon-normed (criterion) measures, ethnographic interviewing, and dynamic assessment procedures are fundamental to determining how someone’s linguistic system influences their current language. Use of an accent or a dialect that is unfamiliar to the listener is not an indication of a spoken language disorder. Children who have a language difference, without a disability, are not eligible for special education services.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Cultural Responsiveness and Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology.\n\nCognitive Referencing\n\nCognitive referencing compares intelligence quotient scores and language scores as a factor to determine a child’s eligibility for speech and language intervention. This practice assumes that a language delay warrants intervention only when language skill development lags behind cognitive skill development. ASHA does not advise using cognitive referencing as one of the criteria for admission into or discharge from speech and language services (ASHA, 2004a).\n\nThe National Joint Committee for the Communication Needs of Persons With Severe Disabilities (2002) identified several concerns about using cognitive referencing, including the following:\n\nThe relationship between language and cognition is complex and changes over time.\n\nTests of cognitive and linguistic ability often measure the same fundamental skills.\n\nAssessments that are typically used for deriving cognitive and language profiles often result in sizable variation in discrepancy determinations.\n\nChildren with commensurate impaired cognitive and language skills would not receive the diagnosis of language impairment or the associated language services that they need. Children with commensurate cognitive and language impairments can still make positive gains with language intervention (Snell et al., 2010).\n\nThese issues with cognitive referencing are compounded by the fact that many standardized tests are culturally biased (e.g., the normative sample is not representative of all children from varied ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds), resulting in inaccurate score interpretations.\n\nWidely using presumptive criteria—including discrepancies between cognitive abilities and communication functioning, chronological age, or diagnosis—to determine eligibility for services is not consistent with the law and IDEA regulations. See ASHA’s resource on cognitive referencing for more information.\n\nCollege- and Career-Readiness State Standards\n\nCollege- and career-readiness state standards, such as the Common Core State Standards, are rigorous curriculum learning standards that most states have implemented. College- and career-readiness standards align with the knowledge and skills necessary to prepare students to enter college and the workforce.\n\nLanguage skills are addressed across subject areas, and the English Language Arts standards focus on the use of language for communication and academic success. Students who have language disorders may require specialized instruction and support to access the curriculum standards.\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency and/or English Language Development (ELP/D) Standards\n\nELP/D standards are specifically developed for students learning English and define progressive levels of English language competence. Reading and language arts standards are not the same as ELP/D standards. Two kinds of English language skills are taught and tested for school success:\n\nsocial and intercultural competence for the classroom\n\nacademic language needed to access content areas (i.e., English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies)\n\nELP/D standards act as a starting point for identifying the language that multilingual learners must develop to successfully access content in and beyond educational settings. Clinicians can use this information to plan linguistically appropriate individualized education program goals for multilingual learners with spoken language disorders.\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Spoken Language Disorders Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/patient perspective.\n\nThe goals of language intervention are to stimulate overall language development and to teach language skills in an integrated way and in context—with the aim of enhancing everyday communication and ensuring access to academic content. Goals are frequently selected with consideration for developmental appropriateness and the potential for improving the effectiveness of communication and academic and social success. See ASHA’s Person-Centered Focus on Function: Language Disorder [PDF] for an example of functional goals consistent with the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.\n\nSpoken language disorders are heterogeneous in nature, and the severity of the disorder can vary. Each individual with language difficulties has a unique profile, based on their current abilities with language, hearing, cognition, and speech production. Many individuals with spoken language disorders can benefit from interventions that are family-centered. Family-centered care views speech and language services as a collaboration between the clinician, the client, and their family. See ASHA’s resources on family-centered practice and person- and family-centered care.\n\nAlong with person- and family-centered care, individuals with spoken language disorders may also benefit from a strengths-based approach that affirms neurodiversity—including identifying the individual’s strengths, respecting the use of identity-first language, presuming competence, focusing on environmental supports, and allowing the individual to make their own choices (Donaldson et al., 2017).\n\nIn addition to considering the unique profile of strengths and needs, the clinician who uses a strengths-based approach considers the language(s) and dialect(s) used during intervention. For example, if the child’s heritage language and the language of instruction differ from one another, then the clinician might incorporate both languages into their treatment approach (Hamilton et al., 2018).\n\nAs indicated in the ASHA Code of Ethics (ASHA, 2023), audiologists and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are obligated to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services, regardless of the clinician’s personal culture (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity), practice setting, or caseload demographics. Multilingual clinicians who have the necessary clinical expertise to treat the individual may not always be available. When a language-matched clinician is not available, clinicians then collaborate with an interpreter to ensure that the individual receives clinically appropriate services. See ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology and Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators. See also the Spoken Language Disorders section of the Cultural and Linguistic Diversity (CLD) Evidence Map.\n\nTreatment Targets\n\nRoth and Worthington (2018) summarize steps in the selection and programming of treatment targets and provide sample case profiles for early intervention through adolescence. They also identify a number of basic principles of effective intervention regardless of client age or disorder—including the four principles listed below.\n\nTo the maximum extent possible, teach strategies for promoting communication rather than teaching isolated behaviors.\n\nProvide intervention that is dynamic in nature and that includes ongoing assessment of the child’s progress in relation to their goals, modifying them as necessary.\n\nProvide intervention that is individualized, based on the nature of a child’s needs, the languages they used, and their individual learning style.\n\nTailor the treatment goals to promote a child’s knowledge one step beyond the current level.\n\nThe sections below outline the intervention targets for various age ranges. Older people with severe language impairments may be functioning at developing language levels. Rather than being based on developmental sequences, interventions for these people may be more functional in nature, focusing on building independence in everyday settings.\n\nIntervention for Preschoolers (Ages 3–5 years)\n\nLanguage develops at a rapid pace in preschool children without spoken language disorders. Their vocabularies are growing, and they are beginning to master basic sentence structures. For children with language difficulties, this process may be delayed. Areas that might be targeted for intervention typically include the following.\n\nPhonology\n\nImproving intelligibility, if a speech sound disorder is indicated (particularly if impairments result in frustration and/or mask problems in semantics and syntax), including\n\nincreasing the consonant repertoire,\n\nimproving the accuracy of sound production, and\n\ndecreasing use of phonological processes.\n\nEnhancing phonological awareness skills, such as the following three examples:\n\nrhyming\n\nblending and segmenting spoken words at the following levels:\n\nsentence and phrase level (one sentence with three words: “The happy boy”)\n\nsyllable level (two syllables in “pancake”: “pan” and “cake”),\n\nonset and rhyme level (two onsets: “p” and “c”; two rhymes: “an” and “ake”)\n\nphoneme level (three phonemes: “p” + “a” + “n”)\n\ndeleting and substituting of syllables and phonemes in spoken words\n\nSemantics\n\nIncreasing the size of vocabulary, including\n\nverbs;\n\npronouns;\n\nconjunctions;\n\nbasic concept vocabulary (e.g., colors); and\n\nacademic vocabulary (i.e., cross-disciplinary or discipline-specific words used in the school context).\n\nIncreasing understanding and use of a wider range of semantic relationships (e.g., agent–action, agent–object, possessor–possession, attribute–entity, recurrence).\n\nImproving the semantic depth or richness of familiar words.\n\nMorphology and Syntax\n\nFacilitating the acquisition and use of age-appropriate morphemes within the child’s dialect—in particular, auxiliary verbs, articles, and pronouns.\n\nIncreasing sentence length and complexity.\n\nIncreasing use of varied sentence types.\n\nPragmatics\n\nIncreasing language flexibility for various contexts.\n\nUsing imaginative play activities to practice newly acquired language skills.\n\nImproving conversational skills, including\n\ninitiating and maintaining communication;\n\nturn-taking, topic maintenance, and topic shifts; and\n\nrequesting and making conversational repairs.\n\nDeveloping narrative skills.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Social Communication Disorder for more information about pragmatics.\n\nLiteracy\n\nBuilding emergent literacy skills, including\n\nprint awareness,\n\nbook awareness,\n\nunderstanding simple story structure,\n\nletter knowledge, and\n\nmatching speech to print.\n\nSee the Treatment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Written Language Disorders.\n\nIntervention For Elementary School Children (Ages 5–10 years)\n\nThe focus of language intervention for elementary school children with language difficulties is to help the child acquire the language skills needed to learn and succeed in a classroom environment. Interventions are curriculum-based, addressing language needs within the context of the curriculum.\n\nAreas targeted for this population typically are as follows.\n\nPhonology\n\nEnhancing phonological awareness skills.\n\nEliminating any residual phonological processes.\n\nSemantics\n\nImproving knowledge of vocabulary, including knowledge of curriculum-related vocabulary.\n\nImproving depth of vocabulary understanding and use, including\n\nsubtle differences in meaning,\n\nchanges in meaning with context,\n\nabstract vocabulary, and\n\nfigures of speech.\n\nRecognizing ambiguities in language (e.g., words with multiple meanings and ambiguous sentence structures).\n\nMonitoring comprehension by requesting clarification.\n\nParaphrasing information.\n\nMorphology and Syntax\n\nIncreasing the use of more advanced morphology (e.g., “monster/monstrous,” “medicine/medical,” “initiate/initiative”).\n\nIncreasing the ability to analyze morphologically complex words (e.g., prefixes, suffixes).\n\nImproving morphosyntactic skills (e.g., use of morphemes in simple and complex clauses, declarative statements vs. questions, relative clauses).\n\nImproving the ability to understand and formulate more complex sentence structures (e.g., compound sentences; complex sentences containing dependent clauses).\n\nJudging the correctness of grammar and morphological word forms and being able to correct errors.\n\nPragmatics\n\nUsing language in various contexts to convey politeness, persuasiveness, and clarification.\n\nIncreasing discourse-level knowledge and skills, including\n\nacademic discourse,\n\nsocial interaction discourse,\n\nnarrative discourse,\n\nexpository discourse, and\n\nuse of cohesive devices in discourse.\n\nImproving the ability to make relevant contributions to classroom discussions.\n\nImproving the ability to repair conversational breakdowns.\n\nLearning what to say and what not to say.\n\nLearning when to talk and when not to talk.\n\nLiteracy\n\nImproving word recognition and decoding.\n\nImproving reading fluency.\n\nImproving reading comprehension.\n\nImproving narrative and expository writing.\n\nSee the Treatment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Written Language Disorders.\n\nMetalinguistics and Metacognition (critical for developing higher-level language skills)\n\nImproving awareness and application of rules and principles governing various language forms.\n\nImproving awareness of others as listeners.\n\nImproving the ability to plan, monitor one’s performance, and evaluate/modify one’s work.\n\nIntervention For Adolescent Students (Ages 11 years Through High School)\n\nInstructional strategies are often used with older students. This approach focuses on teaching rules, techniques, and principles to help acquire and use information across a broad range of situations and settings. Curriculum demands increase as students enter their adolescent years, and children with language disabilities may have difficulty accessing the higher-level curriculum. It may not be possible to close the gap between skill level and grade level. At this point, interventions tend to focus on teaching ways to compensate for language challenges. Student involvement helps foster a feeling of collaboration and responsibility for achieving goals and learning how to self-advocate in the classroom. Adolescent students may also benefit from a strengths-based approach that leverages the student’s assets and focuses on creating environmental supports (Murza, 2021).\n\nEnhancing metalinguistic and metacognitive skills is fundamental to learning new strategies. The emphasis is on how to learn rather than on what to learn. Classroom assignments are often used to teach strategies for learning academic content. Some instructional strategies are discipline-specific, and others are generalizable across disciplines (Faggella-Luby & Deshler, 2008).\n\nExamples of strategies are as follows:\n\nusing context to deduce meaning, make inferences, and identify main ideas\n\ndeciphering morphologically complex words associated with different disciplines (e.g., history, literature, chemistry, algebra)\n\ncreating checklists and graphic organizers to plan assignments (e.g., book reports, presentations, research papers)\n\nusing spell check and grammar check to edit written work completed in electronic format\n\nusing digital technologies (e.g., Internet, collaboration sites) to access and evaluate information, share and collaborate with classmates, produce shared products, and so forth\n\nNot all language intervention approaches for adolescents focus on teaching strategies to students. Adolescents can also benefit from direct vocabulary instruction (Crosson et al., 2019; Elleman et al., 2019; Lowe et al., 2019; McGregor et al., 2021). Although it may not be possible to close the vocabulary gap between individuals with and without spoken language disorders, clinicians can carefully select words for direct instruction. This may include academic words that occur across multiple subjects (e.g., “summarize,” “describe”) or discipline-specific words that are crucial for understanding academic material (e.g., “molecule,” “archaeology”; Elleman et al., 2019; Gray & Yang, 2015).\n\nClinicians combine teaching strategies and providing direct instruction to best support adolescents with spoken language disorders (Elleman et al., 2019). Also see the Treatment section of the Written Language Disorders Practice Portal page.\n\nPostsecondary Transition Planning\n\nChildren and adolescents with spoken language disorders may still need support as they move into postsecondary education and vocational settings. When compared to peers without spoken language disorders, fewer students with spoken language disorders complete high school or receive an undergraduate degree (Johnson et al., 2010). Many young adults with specific language impairment who pursue education after high school seek vocational rather than academic qualifications (Conti-Ramsden & Durkin, 2012).\n\nThe data on educational and vocational outcomes for individuals with speech and language disorders highlight the need for continued support to facilitate a successful transition to young adulthood. SLPs are involved in transition planning in high school and may be involved, to varying degrees, in other support services after high school.\n\nAcademic counseling includes a discussion about requirements for admission to postsecondary schools and the difference between services provided in K–12 special education programs and postsecondary disability support services. Students must disclose their disability and provide current documentation to access services in postsecondary settings. They need to be aware that the supports they can receive differ in postsecondary settings from those provided in K–12 settings.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [PDF] provide protections for students with disabilities transitioning to postsecondary education and work settings. These laws ensure that programs and employment environments are accessible and provide aids and services necessary for effective communication in these settings.\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on postsecondary transition planning for more information about the transition planning process and services.\n\nTreatment Modes/Modalities\n\nTreatment modes and modalities are technologies or other support systems that the SLP can use in conjunction with, or during the implementation of, various treatments. Several treatment modes and modalities are described below. When selecting a mode or modality, the SLP considers the intervention goal and the individual’s developmental stage. For example, a mode or modality that is appropriate for an individual who is at the emerging-language stage may not be appropriate for an individual who is at the prelinguistic stage. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Telepractice for more information about providing services via telepractice. The list below is not exhaustive, and inclusion does not imply endorsement from ASHA.\n\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)\n\nAn AAC system is an integrated group of components used to enhance communication. Individuals with spoken language disorders can use an AAC system as their main communication system or to supplement their spoken verbal communication. AAC uses the following techniques and tools to help the individual express thoughts, ideas, wants, needs, and feelings:\n\npicture communication systems\n\nline drawings or photographs\n\nvideo clips\n\nspeech-generating devices\n\ntangible objects\n\nmanual signs\n\ngestures\n\nfinger spelling\n\nFor more information about AAC, see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).\n\nOnline Instruction\n\nOnline instruction involves the use of computer technology (e.g., iPads) and/or computerized programs (e.g., apps) for teaching language skills, including vocabulary, social skills, social understanding, and social problem solving (see, e.g., Khowaja & Salim, 2013; Weng et al., 2014). See the Service Delivery Options section below and ASHA’s Telepractice Practice Portal page for information about providing services via telepractice.\n\nVideo-Based Instruction\n\nVideo-based instruction (also called “video modeling”) is an observational mode of teaching that uses video recordings to provide a model of the target behavior or skill. The individual observes and then imitates video recordings of desired behaviors. Video modeling procedures can be implemented in three ways: (a) using a video of the behavior to be targeted with another person as a model, (b) using a video of the behavior to be targeted without a model (usually called “point-of-view video modeling”), or (c) using videos of the learner as a model (known as “self-modeling”). In all cases, the SLP works with the learner to provide practice and feedback. As recording devices become more portable and easier to use, video-based techniques are more frequently being used in treatment (see, e.g., Wilson, 2013).\n\nTreatment Options\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Spoken Language Disorders Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/patient perspective.\n\nInterventions can vary along a continuum of naturalness (Fey, 1986; Paul et al., 2018), ranging from drill-based activities in a therapy room to activities that model everyday activities in naturalistic settings. SLPs determine which methods and strategies are effective for a particular student by taking into consideration the individual’s language profile, the severity of the language disorder, factors related to language functioning (e.g., hearing impairment and cognitive functioning), cultural background and values, learning style, and communication needs. SLPs might combine these treatment options with a strengths-based framework for an inclusive approach to intervention. For older children and adolescents, this includes identifying and leveraging the student’s strengths and interests, promoting the student’s self-determined goals, and focusing on the environmental supports that facilitate the student’s success (Donaldson et al., 2017).\n\nBelow are brief descriptions of general and specific treatments for addressing language disorders. Treatment options are organized into broader categories, but intervention approaches do not always fit neatly into one category.\n\nSeveral of the approaches listed below are most often associated with treatment for social communication disorder and autism. These approaches are also used with a broader population of children with language disorders. This list is not exhaustive, and the inclusion of any specific treatment approach does not imply endorsement from ASHA.\n\nLanguage Interventions\n\nLanguage interventions are designed to target specific language skills (e.g., phonology, semantics, syntax, morphology) or broader language and communication skills (e.g., verbal expression, narrative production, and social communication).\n\nLanguage intervention approaches can include the following:\n\nClinician-oriented—The clinician selects the goals and the treatment setting and determines the stimuli to be used and the type and schedule of reinforcement. These approaches use operant procedures and are often used to teach language form (e.g., syntax and morphology).\n\nChild-oriented—The clinician uses indirect language stimulation techniques and follows the child’s lead in natural, everyday settings and activities to stimulate language growth. These approaches are typically used with young children but can be modified for use with older children. Examples include the following:\n\nExpansions—The child’s utterance is repeated in the clinician’s response, and the clinician adds grammatical and semantic detail (see Cleave et al., 2015, for a review on expansions and recasts).\n\nRecasts—In this type of expansion, the adult repeats the child’s utterance but changes the form of the utterance (e.g., sentence to a question, active to passive voice; Cleave et al., 2015).\n\nBuildups and breakdowns—The child’s utterance is first expanded (“buildup”), then is broken down into grammatical components (“breakdown”), and then is built up again to its expanded form.\n\nHybrid—The clinician develops activities that are very natural but, at the same time, allow opportunities for the child’s spontaneous use of utterances containing the targeted language forms. Examples include the following:\n\nFocused stimulation—The clinician produces a high density of the child’s target forms in meaningful and functional contexts; these contexts are designed to motivate target production by the child, although the child is at no time asked to respond (Alt et al., 2020; Fey et al.,1993; Girolametto et al., 1996).\n\nVertical structuring and expansion—The clinician presents a stimulus (e.g., a picture depicting a semantic relationship), asks the child to respond to the stimulus (e.g., “What is this?” “What’s happening?”), and then expands the child’s response into a well-formed sentence.\n\nNarrative Interventions\n\nNarrative interventions focus on improving a child’s storytelling ability and can provide a naturalistic means of targeting specific language difficulties. See Petersen (2011) and Pico et al. (2021) for systematic reviews of narrative interventions.\n\nNarrative interventions target\n\nthe ability to provide context for the listener,\n\nthe use of narrative structures (story grammars) to organize events, and\n\nthe use of microstructure (e.g., syntactic complexity, temporal and causal conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, elaborated phrases, and adverbs) to enhance the clarity of the narrative.\n\nCaregiver-Mediated or Caregiver-Implemented Intervention\n\nCaregiver-mediated or caregiver-implemented intervention consists of parents’ use of direct, individualized intervention practices with their child to increase positive learning opportunities and acquisition of skills. For language intervention, caregivers may receive training and support from an SLP (see Roberts et al., 2019, for a detailed review). Caregiver-mediated or caregiver-implemented intervention is most often used with young children.\n\nMore Than Words®—a Hanen Program®—is one example of a caregiver-mediated intervention. It offers a parent-directed approach focusing on day-to-day life, taking advantage of everyday activities to help the child improve communication and social skills (Sussman, 1999). This program is typically used for early language intervention with young children with autism. Mettler et al. (2023) provided another example of a caregiver-implemented language intervention, which involved trained caregivers applying focused stimulation techniques to support vocabulary development.\n\nInteractive Reading Interventions\n\nShared interactive book reading interventions, including read-aloud and dialogic reading, involve a trained caregiver or clinician reading a book to a child—or group of children—using different techniques to engage the child in the text (What Works Clearinghouse, 2015). Techniques may include the following:\n\nmaking predictions\n\ngiving explanations about specific words or pictures\n\nasking open-ended questions or wh-questions about the story and characters\n\nmodeling print and book awareness as well as critical thinking skills (e.g., relating the story’s topic to a real-life experience)\n\nShared book reading aims to support language development, emergent reading, and listening comprehension skills. The trained adult can implement this intervention in many settings (e.g., home, classroom, community) and from any socioeconomic background (Noble et al., 2020).\n\nPeer-Mediated or Peer-Implemented Intervention\n\nPeer-mediated or peer-implemented intervention incorporates peers, including siblings without language disorders, as communication partners for children with language disorders to provide effective role models and boost communication competence. Peers without spoken language disorders are taught strategies to facilitate play and social interactions; interventions are commonly carried out in inclusive settings where play with peers without spoken language disorders naturally occurs (e.g., preschool setting).\n\nRelationship-Based Intervention\n\nRelationship-based practices in early intervention are aimed at supporting parent–child relationships. DIR/Floortime® is one example of a relationship-based intervention. This model promotes development by encouraging children to interact with parents and others through play. It focuses on following the child’s lead; challenging the child to be creative and spontaneous; and involving the child’s senses, motor skills, and emotions (Greenspan et al., 1998).\n\nSocial Communication Intervention\n\nSocial communication interventions are designed to increase social skills and promote socially appropriate behaviors and communication, using story-based intervention, scripts, social group settings, and other platforms to teach peer interaction skills. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Social Communication Disorder.\n\nBehavioral Interventions and Techniques\n\nBehavioral interventions and techniques aim to teach target skills using the basic principles of behavior change. These methods are based on behavioral/operant principles of learning; they involve examining the antecedents that elicit a certain behavior, along with the consequences that follow that behavior, and then making adjustments in this chain to increase desired behaviors and/or decrease inappropriate ones. Behavioral interventions range from one-to-one, discrete trial instruction to naturalistic approaches.\n\nDiscrete trial training (DTT)—a one-on-one instructional approach using behavioral methods to teach skills in small, incremental steps in a systematic, controlled fashion. The teaching opportunity is a discrete trial consisting of an antecedent (such as an instruction from the teacher), a response from the learner, and a consequence or feedback regarding the response. DTT is most often used for skills that (a) learners are not initiating on their own; (b) have a clear, correct procedure; and (c) can be taught in a one-to-one setting.\n\nFunctional communication training (FCT)—a behavioral intervention program that combines the assessment of the communicative functions of maladaptive behavior with the use of applied behavior analysis procedures to teach alternative responses. Problem behaviors can be eliminated through extinction and replaced with alternate, more appropriate ways of communicating needs or wants. FCT can be used with children with autism across a range of ages and regardless of cognitive level or expressive communication abilities (Carr & Durand, 1985).\n\nIncidental teaching—a teaching technique that uses behavioral procedures. The clinician provides naturally occurring teaching opportunities that are based on the child’s interests. The clinician follows the child’s lead and reinforces communication attempts as these attempts get closer to the desired communication behavior (McGee et al., 1999).\n\nMilieu therapy—a range of methods (including incidental teaching) that are integrated into a child’s natural environment. Milieu therapy includes training in everyday environments and during activities that take place throughout the day rather than only at “therapy time” (Kaiser et al., 1992).\n\nPivotal response treatment (PRT)—a play-based, child-initiated behavioral treatment. Formerly referred to as the “natural language paradigm,” PRT’s goals are to\n\nteach speech sounds, first words, and language;\n\ndecrease disruptive behaviors; and\n\nincrease social, communication, and academic skills.\n\nRather than target specific behaviors, PRT targets pivotal areas of development (response to multiple cues, motivation, self-regulation, initiation of social interactions, and empathy) that are central to a wide range of skills (Koegel & Koegel, 2019). PRT emphasizes natural reinforcement (e.g., the child is rewarded with an item when they make a meaningful attempt to request that item).\n\nTreatments Not Recommended\n\nSeveral treatment options and approaches lack scientific evidence of validity and are not endorsed by ASHA. Below are brief descriptions of these treatments, along with ASHA’s position on each. Click on the hyperlinks provided to read ASHA’s full position statements.\n\nAuditory Integration Training\n\nAuditory integration training (AIT; Bérard, 1993), also known as “the Bérard method,” is a type of sensory integration treatment that involves exercising the middle ear muscles and auditory nervous system. AIT claims to treat a variety of auditory and nonauditory disorders, including auditory processing problems, dyslexia, learning disabilities, attention-deficit disorders, and autism.\n\nAccording to ASHA’s position statement, Auditory Integration Training: “The 2002 ASHA Work Group on AIT, after reviewing empirical research in the area to date, concludes that AIT has not met scientific standards for efficacy that would justify its practice by audiologists and speech-language pathologists” (ASHA, 2004b, para. 1).\n\nFacilitated Communication\n\nFacilitated communication (FC)—also referred to as “assisted typing,” “facilitated communication training,” and “supported typing”—is a technique that involves a “facilitator” using physical support (e.g., supporting the hand) to “assist” a nonspeaking person with a disability to point to letters, pictures, or objects on a keyboard or on a communication board.\n\nAccording to ASHA’s position statement, Facilitated Communication, \"It is the position of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) that Facilitated Communication (FC) is a discredited technique that should not be used. There is no scientific evidence of the validity of FC, and there is extensive scientific evidence—produced over several decades and across several countries—that messages are authored by the ‘facilitator’ rather than the person with a disability. Furthermore, there is extensive evidence of harms related to the use of FC. Information obtained through the use of FC should not be considered as the communication of the person with a disability” (ASHA, 2018a, para. 1).\n\nRapid Prompting Method\n\nThe rapid prompting method (RPM)—also known as Soma® RPM, “informative pointing,” “letterboarding,” and “spelling to communicate”—involves an instructor prompting the person who is nonspeaking to point to letters on a letter board to spell out words.\n\nAccording to ASHA’s position statement, Rapid Prompting Method, “It is the position of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) that use of the Rapid Prompting Method (RPM) is not recommended because of prompt dependency and the lack of scientific validity. Furthermore, information obtained through the use of RPM should not be assumed to be the communication of the person with a disability” (ASHA, 2018b, para. 1).\n\nService Delivery Options\n\nSee the Service Delivery section of the Spoken Language Disorders Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nSee also ASHA’s resource, Thinking Through Varied Service Delivery Models [PDF].\n\nIn addition to determining the type of speech and language treatment that is optimal for children with spoken language disorders, SLPs consider other service delivery variables—including format, provider, dosage, and timing—that may impact treatment outcomes.\n\nFormat\n\nFormat refers to the structure of the treatment session, including, but not limited to, the number of children in the session and the language(s) used. Children with spoken language disorders can use group treatment sessions to apply learned strategies and to practice language skills in natural contexts.\n\nClinicians can incorporate technology into service delivery, including computer-based treatment programs and the use of telepractice. Various types of assessments and interventions can be provided via telepractice; however, each state’s requirements for telepractice vary. See ASHA’s state-by-state resource for specific state rules and ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Telepractice.\n\nFor children who speak minoritized dialects of American English, consult with additional service providers with appropriate cultural and linguistic proficiency, including cultural informants or brokers, when necessary. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness.\n\nFor multilingual children, it is important to consider the language(s) used during intervention. Multilingual clinicians who have the necessary linguistic and clinical expertise to treat the client may not always be available. In these cases, the SLP collaborates with an interpreter or a cultural broker. See ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology and Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators.\n\nProvider\n\nProvider refers to the person offering the treatment, such as the SLP or the caregiver. SLPs can train treatment extenders—including family members, caregivers, and volunteers—to implement specific interventions (see the Caregiver-Mediated or Caregiver-Implemented Intervention section above) and to encourage the carryover of learned communication strategies beyond the treatment setting.\n\nDosage\n\nDosage refers to the frequency, intensity, and duration of service. Dosage of treatment will vary based on the child’s goals and needs; additionally, more sessions does not always mean better outcomes (Frizelle et al., 2021). For more information about dosage in the school setting, see ASHA’s resource on school-based service delivery in speech-language pathology.\n\nSetting\n\nSetting refers to the location of treatment (e.g., home, community). Settings of school-based interventions can include the SLP resource room and/or in the classroom. For more information, see ASHA’s resource on school-based service delivery in speech-language pathology. Treatment extenders, following training from an SLP, can provide language practice in the home and in the community.\n\nAdlof, S. M., Scoggins, J., Brazendale, A., Babb, S., & Petscher, Y. (2017).
