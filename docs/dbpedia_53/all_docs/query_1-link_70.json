        "text": "This post originally appeared on The Tribune, published by the SPT, a student society of McGill University, on 24 October 2023.\n\nElegant script, frayed edges, the occasional hole, and sketches of the man himself. Letters signed Voltaire, V, or – occasionally – Volt.\n\nUniversité de Sherbrooke professor Peter Lambert-David Southam has gifted McGill a stunning manuscript collection of 290 documents including handwritten letters, correspondences, and fragments of Voltaire’s work. Curated by Ann-Marie Holland in collaboration with professor Nicholas Cronk and digitised by faculty and students at the Université de Sherbrooke, these documents allow us to gaze into Voltaire’s life – particularly his time at the Château de Ferney. Four generations of Southam’s family lived in the Château after Voltaire, which is how the collection was assembled and brought to Québec.\n\nAs Cronk noted during his lecture on 28 October, ‘The McGill Library has now become one of the world’s major centres for the study of Voltaire’.\n\nBut why care about manuscripts today? Cronk made a case in his lecture.\n\nAn 1841 letter has ‘Open Cautiously’ written on the envelope. ‘Mr Reed, who lives in Leeds’ sent a letter to novelist Maria Edgeworth, begging for a signature. She wrote back with a signed reply – written on the inside of the envelope, knowing that if he ripped it open in his enthusiasm, he would destroy the signature.\n\nAn Ariosto manuscript at the Biblioteca Ariostea is smudged at the bottom. Over 200 years after its writing, Alfieri visited and loved the manuscript so much, he signed it like a visitor’s book (generally frowned upon today, but the librarians made an exception for Alfieri). He cried, smudging the ink.\n\nThese remnants let us see a different side of the author’s life, one unpublished, uncirculated, unremembered. Authors are often so much more than what they publish – we go far beyond the selves we choose to present to the world.\n\nVoltaire – whose given name was François-Marie Arouet – was an enormous celebrity as well as an amusing character in his time. He won the lottery multiple times – but not through luck. He and a group of friends discovered that the prize fund exceeded the cost of each ticket. So they proceeded to divide and conquer: buy every single ticket, split the profits, laugh at the authorities, repeat. But what about the parts of his life that society didn’t see?\n\n‘In the French sphere, we’re all familiar with those writers mainly in the 19th through 20th centuries: Flaubert, Proust, Valéry, who kept enormous numbers of manuscripts, they kept all their work in drafts… Sadly – or maybe happily – you can’t do that for Voltaire’, Cronk said.\n\nThere are exceptions. A famous scene in Candide involves the titular character encountering an escaped enslaved person. He sobs. A manuscript was found in the 1950s, written the year before publication. This scene isn’t there – it was added later.\n\nThe Collection allows us to connect with a different side of Voltaire. These are letters he wrote to friends, fans, and loved ones (Voltaire often gave his work to ‘women admirers’). There are holes. No margins. Cheap paper. But we can also see the inverse: instances of extreme formality, almost forced and very funny.\n\nVoltaire wrote a letter to the (extremely Catholic) Queen of France seeking her approval of La Henriade (an epic poem criticising the Catholic Church). The letter-writing convention of the time indicated that the more space left after the address, the more respect for the receiver. He left nearly a full page of space. She never answered.\n\nThe Collection offers incredible insight into Voltaire’s later years: who he was writing to, what he was writing, how. Strings of poetry, history, fun, official correspondences, and mistresses weave a tapestry of not only his essence as a person and author, but his everyday life.\n\nFragments of quotidian life allow us to connect with the past on another level. These documents bring us to the fantastic – but also disconcerting – conclusion that authors are everyday people as well.\n\n– Kellie Elrick\n\nSelected works from the collection can be viewed in the ROAAr Reading Room without appointment Monday to Thursday, 10 a.m.–6 p.m. with a piece of government or student ID.\n\nThe Letters of the Duchesse d’Elbeuf: hostile witness to the French Revolution by Colin Jones, Simon Macdonald, and Alex Fairfax-Cholmeley has recently published in the Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment series. This book features previously unpublished letters written by the duchesse d’Elbeuf which offer a vivid and exciting hostile account of the French Revolution and the Terror. In this blog post, we are introduced to the duchesse d’Elbeuf, the work of bringing together these new sources, and this latest publication in the series.\n\nOur new book centres on six notebooks confiscated by the state during the French Revolution and which have sat, largely undisturbed, in the police archives ever since. They are filled with the scrawled handwriting of one of the richest women in eighteenth-century France, the duchesse d’Elbeuf. We provide the first full transcription of her notebooks and this has allowed us to fix scholarly attention on the duchess for the very first time. Her extensive writing, framed as a record of a correspondence with an unknown female friend but perhaps also functioning as a form of diary or tool for personal reflection, is a distinctive and important addition to the list of contemporary chroniclers of the French Revolution and the quotidian experience of revolution. As a devout, elite, female counter-revolutionary observer she leads us through the tumult of late 1788 to early 1794 with a forthright, multi-faceted hostility to the revolutionary process. Her writing also draws on three distinct geographies of revolutionary experience: an exclusive residence in the heart of Paris; provincial life on her estate at Moreuil in Picardy; and a spell of temporary emigration in Tournai. Quite simply, there is no other French Revolutionary witness quite like her.\n\nAs a scholarly edition, this book provides a full transcription of the notebooks (unfortunately, we know that a further twenty notebooks, potentially covering several earlier decades of the duchess’s life, were confiscated but subsequently discarded, lost or destroyed). This was a painstaking process because although the duchess could be an astute observer, she often did not take the same care with her grammar or spelling. Likewise, she clearly felt that writing accessories were an unnecessary expense, even before her finances started to take a significant hit as the Revolution’s attacks on noble status and property escalated, and so the handwriting can tend towards illegibility. Our book interweaves two distinct parts of the notebook series: four notebooks contain a total of sixty-nine letters spanning 13 December 1788 to 6 November 1793; the other two notebooks are made up of note-form entries which appear to record some of the key information in preparation for drafting the letters themselves. In our introduction we interrogate the letter format of this source because it is unusual and intriguing. If these are copies of letters sent to the duchess’s unnamed friend, then who might be the intended target? The counter-revolutionary tone and content would also have made such correspondence an increasingly risky enterprise, and yet there is evidence from elsewhere that the duchess was prepared to take political risks even while living a stone’s throw from the centre of revolutionary government in Paris. Another possibility – that this was always (or became) a private record – would have been an extraordinary innovation for a woman of her generation. These different interpretative frames all show the value of the duchess’s writing for our broader understanding of eighteenth-century epistolary culture.\n\nOur book also provides a biography of the duchess, alongside an analysis of the Revolutionary history she has left us. The duchess’s pre-revolutionary life, reconstructed from a variety of archival sources in the regrettable absence of her notebooks from any of this period, is a case study in the construction and consolidation of noble status and wealth in eighteenth-century France. Childless and already twice a widow, the duchess dedicated much of her energy from the mid-1760s onwards to the successful advancement of her extended family, via marriage and the astute management of her own wealth. Indeed, when we finally have access to her own voice (in December 1788 via the first surviving notebook) she presides, aged eighty-one, over an impressive network of family patronage and can draw on a vast annual income of as much as 200,000 livres. From this pinnacle of French society, the duchess then provides us with a unique account of a revolutionary dynamic which she came to openly deride and despise – but which left her family empire in tatters, goaded her into a temporary exile she came to regret, and saw her live out her final months in uncomfortable proximity to the very revolutionaries she held responsible for destroying the religious and social underpinnings to the France she still held dear.\n\nThis account can now be read in full. Alongside our book with the French transcription, a sister website contains a curated selection of translated extracts with searchable text and related content: https://revolutionaryduchess.exeter.ac.uk. We hope people will enjoy both versions of a remarkable voice from the French Revolution.\n\n– Alex Fairfax-Cholmeley (University of Exeter), Colin Jones (Queen Mary University of London & University of Chicago), and Simon Macdonald (University College London)\n\nVisit the book’s accompanying website which provides free public access to extensive extracts (never previously translated into English) from the duchesse d’Elbeuf’s notebooks.\n\nThis post originally appeared on the Liverpool University Press blog.\n\nIrena Fliter’s Ottomans in Eighteenth-Century Prussia: Delegates to Diplomats has recently published in the Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment series. This book examines the cultural and social dynamics of Ottoman diplomacy in eighteenth-century Prussia. In this blog post, Irena Fliter introduces her new book with insights into the transformation which turned the former peripheral Prussian court into a central partner of the empire.\n\nPrussia was peripheral. From the perspective of Istanbul, the centre of the eighteenth-century Ottoman Empire, which stretched from the Arabian peninsula to what is now Romania and Hungary and from North Africa to the borders of present-day Iran, Prussia was originally only one of many European countries of minor importance. In the first half of the eighteenth century, Prussia was in any respect distant from the Ottoman world. Other countries such as Britain, France and the Habsburg Empire held significantly more economic, cultural and diplomatic importance for the Ottoman court. However, with the rise of Prussia as a military power in Europe, the interest of the Ottomans also changed: in the second half of the eighteenth century, the periphery had become the military centre and a desired ally. The dance of rapprochement between the two courts lasted until the nineteenth century, with diplomatic envoys, their entourages and other intermediaries being the main actors. These actors turned the former peripheral Prussian court into a central partner of the empire, and, in return, Prussia transformed the Ottoman visitors into members of the European diplomatic corps.\n\nOttomans in eighteenth-century Prussia is the story of these processes of transformation. It tells how negotiations, misunderstandings and disputes formed diplomatic relationships between two courts that had previously been strangers to each other. It also shows how individuals who had been Ottoman officials, merchants or dragomans (interpreters) now emerged as diplomatic and political actors in their own right during and after the missions. Yet it was not only official channels that brought the Ottoman Empire and Prussia closer together.\n\nAs the story of Ottomans in eighteenth-century Prussia progresses, it becomes clear that the challenges to diplomatic relations in the Early Modern period were primarily practical. Up until the present day, states have found it challenging to integrate foreign people who settle in the country for an extended period of time into the administrative, financial and cultural structures. Naturally, the situation today is facilitated by modern state cooperation, international banking and translation services. In the early modern period, however, these institutions existed only in rudimentary forms, if at all. Moreover, a shared knowledge and understanding of social norms regarding medical treatment, living culture and even literature had not yet been fully established. Ottomans travelling to eighteenth-century Berlin often relied on ad hoc solutions and the courtesy of Prussian officials and citizens when dealing with the crucial issues of health, housing and entertainment. These improvised and informal practices laid the groundwork for mutual trust and later cooperation.\n\nThe peripheral position of Prussia and the improvised character of Ottoman–Prussian relations are illustrated by an episode about the journey of the first Ottoman ambassador to Prussia. In 1763, Ahmed Resmi Efendi (1694/1695-1783) was an experienced Ottoman official and man of letters when Sultan Mustafa III (1717-1774) appointed him to the court of Berlin to negotiate a defensive alliance. It was not the first time Ahmed Resmi had travelled to Christian Europe, as he had already served as ambassador in Vienna in 1757. But, unlike his journey from the Ottoman to the neighbouring Habsburg Empire, Ahmed Resmi’s expedition to Berlin had to cross a third country, Poland-Lithuania. Yet neither the Ottoman nor the Prussian officials had prepared a diplomatic protocol for a situation where neither of the courts carried responsibility for the funding and security of the travelling ambassador. The mission came close to failure before it had begun. Eventually, the parties resolved the dispute with compromises and the help of a Jewish merchant in the entourage of the Ottoman ambassador. The improvised solution became the official protocol and remained in place until the introduction of permanent Ottoman embassies in Prussia in 1797.\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, Prussia was at the centre of military and diplomatic events in Europe. In Ottoman eyes, it was no longer just a peripheral region but a sought-after partner among the predominantly hostile European countries – a change sealed in 1790 with a defensive alliance between the two courts. On the informal level, the fascination of Prussian officials and the German-speaking public with Ottoman living culture, music and religious practices had faded, and the foreign had become more familiar. Likewise, Ottoman observation of an unfamiliar Prussian diplomatic, cultural and social life turned into increasing engagement with European diplomacy, the Enlightenment and German language and history. Although still geographically distant, the Ottoman and the Prussian governments could rely upon an increasingly shared intellectual, social and cultural familiarity when continuing to engage in and building upon diplomatic relations in the nineteenth century.\n\n– Irena Fliter (Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel)\n\nThis post originally appeared on the Liverpool University Press blog.\n\nCondorcet’s Vie de Voltaire was written between 1783 and 1789 and published in the spring of 1789 in the seventy-volume Kehl edition of Voltaire’s complete works, edited by Beaumarchais, Condorcet, and others. This biography sought to defend Voltaire against his critics and to restore his place in the ‘History of the progress of the human mind’. While Condorcet’s Vie de Turgot (1786) was a manifesto for Condorcet’s own reformist ambitions, his Vie de Voltaire was a tribute to one of the key leaders of the philosophes. Therefore, it is essential reading in order to fully comprehend Condorcet’s thinking.\n\nThis new edition, by Linda Gil, of the Vie de Voltaire provides, for the first time, comprehensive notes, as well as a preface that places the text within its editorial context, namely the monumental Kehl edition. The Vie de Voltaire marked the culmination of ‘one of the most significant literary endeavours of the century’ (Preface, p.13) that began immediately after Voltaire’s death in 1778. The objective of the Kehl edition was to establish Voltaire as a symbol of the militant commitment and pedagogical ambition of the philosophes. L. Gil shows Voltaire’s biography to be a pivotal moment in the process of glorifying Voltaire, which would reach its zenith in 1791 when he was interred in the Panthéon in Paris.\n\nThe Vie de Voltaire and the progress of the human mind\n\nWhat does the Vie de Voltaire teach us about Condorcet’s thinking? L. Gil is right when she states that it can be understood as a way to outline his own theory of the progress of the human mind. In the Ninth epoch of his Sketch for a historical picture of the progress of the human mind, Condorcet recalls Voltaire’s role in this progress. According to him, Voltaire did not discover new truths, but he unquestionably contributed to spreading philosophical ones, which had previously been reserved to a select few, far more widely.\n\nThe spread of these truths did not merely occur through the transmission of knowledge but rather through the communication of a new form of sensibility which Condorcet succinctly encapsulates as a ‘love for mankind’ (sentiment d’humanité), which he defines in the Sketch as ‘une compassion tendre, active pour tous les maux qui affligent l’espèce humaine, d’une horreur pour tout ce qui, dans les institutions publiques, dans les actes du gouvernement, dans les actions privées, ajoutait des douleurs nouvelles aux douleurs inévitables de la nature’. [1]\n\nCondorcet believed that this feeling finds its origin in the principles of philosophy. Thus, experiencing it is synonymous with acknowledging the truth of these principles. Voltaire’s work contributed to the emergence of these principles because, in its various literary forms, it helped a broad readership recognise the authenticity of this feeling. It is not insignificant that in his Vie de Voltaire, Condorcet describes one of Voltaire’s primary personality traits as ‘love for mankind’: ‘On peut le compter parmi le très petit nombre des hommes en qui l’amour de l’humanité a été une véritable passion’ (p.222). The book aimed to describe how Voltaire succeeded in communicating this feeling to his readers thanks to a unique literary style, accessible not only to philosophers but also to the ‘peuple des lecteurs’ (p.228).\n\nThis interpretation of Voltaire’s works reflects Condorcet’s optimism regarding the challenging issue of the spread of knowledge in society. This problem is the subject of a chapter entitled ‘Peut-on éclairer le peuple?’ in Antoine Lilti’s recent book, L’Héritage des Lumières. In this chapter, A. Lilti highlights a paradox specific to the Enlightenment: in order to enlighten the people, it is necessary for them to be able to identify those who are capable of enlightening them. In Condorcet’s opinion, Voltaire embodies the possibility of resolving this paradox because what is unique about his genius is precisely his ability to be recognised as such by his readers.\n\nThis conviction of Condorcet’s runs through the entire book and will serve as our guide to examine three themes that he announces on the very first page of his Vie de Voltaire, namely the progress of the arts, influence over public opinion, and the war against prejudice: ‘La vie de Voltaire doit être l’histoire des progrès que les arts ont dus à son génie, du pouvoir qu’il a exercé sur les opinions de son siècle, enfin de cette longue guerre contre les préjugés, déclarée dès sa jeunesse, et soutenue jusqu’à ses derniers moments’ (p.29).\n\nVoltaire’s plays\n\nCondorcet believed that Voltaire’s artistic genius found its best expression in his plays, which filled the first nine volumes of the Kehl edition. According to him, Voltaire was the only playwright who had improved the genre of tragedy in France since Racine (p.229). The value of his work lay in his ability to blend poetry with philosophy, thus using art to communicate the truth of philosophy to still resistant spectators and readers. Condorcet considered that L’Orphelin de la Chine demonstrates that ‘un grand poète peut quelquefois décider les esprits flottants entre d’anciennes erreurs et les vérités qui, pour en prendre la place, attendent qu’un dernier coup achève de renverser la barrière chancelante que le préjugé leur oppose’ (p.127). Theatre could be a means of spreading philosophical truths by sharing the sensibility specific to the philosophes, which Voltaire was perfectly capable of conveying to his audience. His plays demonstrate that ‘les spectacles forment en quelque sorte un lien entre la classe des hommes qui pensent et celle des hommes qui ne pensent point’ (p.55).\n\nVoltaire and public opinion\n\nCondorcet also believed that Voltaire exemplified how men of letters had gained influence over public opinion during the second half of the eighteenth century. Condorcet viewed public space as a battleground where various groups compete fiercely to gain dominance in shaping public opinion. This struggle holds a vital political dimension as public opinion invariably influences those with legislative authority. To establish a political power guided by reason, public opinion must first be made rational.\n\nCondorcet did not endorse a monolithic and naive view of the people. He describes public opinion as vague, erratic, and susceptible to prejudice. It has a passive dimension and lacks autonomy. Public opinion truly exists and is capable of passing judgment only when someone summons it to deliver its verdict. That is why public opinion can play a political role only if enlightened people want to defend a cause by making it public. To achieve this goal, they need to possess the talent to effectively communicate their ideas. Voltaire’s significant legal battles, such as the Calas, Sirven, and d’Étallonde cases, precisely represent this pivotal moment in the history of the progress of the human mind. Once again, Voltaire served philosophy by writing ‘des écrits plus courts, séduisants par le style, propres tantôt à exciter la pitié, tantôt à réveiller l’indignation publique’ (p.155).\n\nThe war against prejudice\n\nWhile Voltaire knew how to rally a public, he also contributed to unite a group, that of the philosophes, in the battle against prejudice. This battle was primarily aimed at promoting tolerance and fighting religious fanaticism and superstition. This group was composed of French philosophes, active at the time of the Encyclopédie. Nevertheless, in his Vie de Voltaire, Condorcet emphasises the European dimension of the Enlightenment. Voltaire is described as the leader of a group that transcends borders, united by the defence of common principles and coalescing around him: ‘Il avait formé dans l’Europe entière une ligue dont il était l’âme, et dont le cri de ralliement était raison et tolérance’ (p.165).\n\nThe spatial expansion of the Enlightenment spirit was coupled with a social expansion. Better than anyone, Voltaire succeeded in wrenching from prejudices men who were unable to study proofs, thanks to his unique talent for formulating philosophical truths in an accessible way. His use of short, entertaining literary genres, like the philosophical novella Candide, expanded the readership of philosophical works by making truths accessible to all, as he was aware that ‘la justesse naturelle de l’esprit y [à l’étude] peut suppléer pour les vérités simples qui sont aussi les plus nécessaires’ (p.134). Better than anyone else, Voltaire excelled at liberating from prejudices individuals who could not engage in rigorous philosophical discourse.\n\nThis edition of Condorcet’s Vie de Voltaire by L. Gil provides a valuable reading guide that was lacking in previous editions of this major work. It actively contributes to the recent effort to publish Condorcet’s writings in paperback, which include his Correspondance secrète with Voltaire and D’Alembert (Payot et Rivages, 2021), as well as Conseils à sa fille (Folio Gallimard, 2022). Most importantly, this edition offers a fresh perspective on a work by Condorcet which had been overlooked, but which, nonetheless, proves to be crucial in his intellectual trajectory.\n\n– Gabriel Darriulat (doctorant contractuel, Sorbonne Université)\n\n[1] Condorcet, Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain [1794], préface d’Alain Pons (Paris, Flammarion, 1998), p.230.\n\nKathryn Sutherland’s recent monograph, Why modern manuscripts matter (Oxford University Press, 2023) is a wonderfully evocative love letter to manuscript materials. Exploring the intricate lives and afterlives of manuscripts produced from the eighteenth-century onward, Sutherland argues for the importance of ‘waste’ as key sites of authorial development and provides a series of persuasive reasons as to why we should all protect, preserve, and revere manuscripts as works of art in their own right. Sutherland’s book strikes a powerful chord with the work I am currently undertaking to produce the Voltaire Foundation’s digital Catalogue of Manuscripts Relating to Voltaire, a catalogue which also emphasises the materiality of texts.\n\nOne of the central tenets of Sutherland’s book is that manuscripts often represent the ‘leftovers’, ‘waste’, and ‘fragments’ produced over the course of a lifetime, either of a printed literary output or of the author themselves. She demonstrates, for instance, that manuscripts played important roles in the lives of noted authors such as Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott, each one representing a moment in their creative process that was ultimately superseded by print. In this way, she presents manuscripts as items that were deliberately transitory by their very nature, wisps of smoke caught momentarily on the page, but never meant to be held forever. Once their purpose had been served, they were to be discarded. Though this argument does not hold true for all of Sutherland’s examples – Frances Burney, for instance, fastidiously held onto to the manuscripts in her possession – she nevertheless presents an overarching narrative of the apparent serendipity of manuscript survivals. Given the immense value that we now place on manuscripts, Sutherland’s description of them as ‘leftovers’ and ‘waste’ may seem jarring. It is this disjuncture, however, which lies at the heart of her argument. Manuscripts were often not meant to outlive their printed counterparts, their survival is merely down to chance, they were, in short, not highly valued. In today’s day and age, however, they are. So why do we now place such value on these sources? How did attitudes shift? And what happens to our view of manuscript materials when we view them through the lens of print?\n\nSutherland proposes that we have reimagined manuscript materials and the value that they hold. Rather than viewing them as necessary waste of diminished value when compared to a printed work, we now have a tendency to reimagine these artefacts as works of art to be subjected to the same critical gaze as a painted masterpiece. In this way, every mark on the page matters and reveals an aspect of the personality of its creator. Whether frenetic or considered, messy or organised, doodled upon or pristine, every stain, marginal note, crease, fold, and fingerprint matters. By analysing the materiality of texts, we value them as more than stepping-stones to a monolithic printed work, and embrace their diversity and ingenuity, seeing through the lines on the page and digging deeper into the life and inner workings of the author (this topic has been touched on in a recent colloquium in Paris, organised by ITEM). If eyes are the windows to the soul, then manuscripts are windows to the mind. This view of manuscripts is, admittedly, somewhat philosophical, yet the tools and frameworks that have emerged from exactly this sort of thinking are shaping scholarly interests and outputs. Greater emphasis, for instance, is being placed on codicology, marginalia are now being mined for additional insights, and cataloguing methods, such as the TEI-XML framework, have adapted to include tags and fields that record paratextual elements. We are valuing manuscripts in ways that are unprecedented. Perhaps one could even say that they matter now more than ever.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which Sutherland’s book synergises with the aims and approaches of the Voltaire Foundation’s Catalogue of Manuscripts Relating to Voltaire (CMV). Firstly, the catalogue itself stands as a testament to a belief that we cannot understand Voltaire through his printed works alone. Instead, it is his manuscripts that reveal the most about his thoughts, working methods, and aims. The need to be able to search Voltaire’s manuscripts is one that CMV addresses. However, CMV will also include manuscripts relating to Voltaire, featuring manuscript copies of his works, letters about him, and accounts of meetings with him amongst other things. In this way, CMV extends Sutherland’s argument, demonstrating that manuscripts about an author can be just as revealing as those produced by an author. Ultimately, however, the notions at the heart of both Sutherland’s book and CMV are the same: manuscripts matter.\n\nSecondly, the catalogue’s data model has been constructed in order to allow the material and codicological aspects of a manuscript to be captured, searched, and explored, providing researchers with a wealth of information usually lacking in more bibliographically-grounded catalogues. In making this information available to users, the catalogue recognises and anticipates new scholarly trends, whilst also advocating for the wider inclusion of such fields in manuscript catalogues. This tallies with Sutherland’s argument in favour of viewing manuscripts as works of art, with fields available to describe a whole host of material features of manuscripts including marginalia, stains, holes, wax seals, corrections, watermarks, and more.\n\nFinally, Sutherland often touches on the problematic issue of manuscripts falling into private collections, particularly those manuscripts created by authors of national significance. Who owns a manuscript? Are they valuable enough that they should be publicly accessible? And where geographically should manuscripts reside? Exploring this issue further in a ‘Book at Lunchtime’ session in Oxford, Sutherland and her fellow panellists questioned whether or not the manuscripts of writers such as Jane Austen, Walter Scott, and Frances Burney should, for example, so readily be subsumed into American collections and removed from their place of creation: England. Though they acknowledged that there is a nationalistic sentiment that leads some to argue that manuscripts belong in the soil in which they are grown, the audience was also reminded that America and England share a common tongue and thus also a vernacular literary history, making such a movement across the Atlantic entirely justifiable. The dispersal of manuscripts is a difficult issue, all the more so when manuscripts are broken up into innumerable private collections unable to be accessed by researchers, and it is unlikely that we will ever know the true extent of what is out there.\n\nAlthough this is an issue that cannot be easily solved, CMV has sought to navigate the global dispersal of manuscripts in two ways. Firstly, CMV is a union catalogue meaning that it digitally unites disparate global collections in one place, creating links that traverse national, regional, and institutional boundaries. This will allow readers to locate manuscripts relating to Voltaire in repositories across the globe, making previously unprecedented connections between various source materials, and allowing new discoveries to be made. Whilst this does not resolve debates around ownership, such an approach does facilitate transnational research in ways that were previously difficult and time consuming. Thinking more specifically about manuscripts in private collections, CMV provides catalogue entries for manuscripts that pass for sale at auction. Whilst buyer details cannot be shared by auction houses, and thus the exact whereabout of the manuscripts remain unknown, these entries provide an important record of those more ephemeral manifestations of manuscripts, as they pass from one private collection to another, before they are once more obscured from the scholarly gaze. Though this is not an entirely satisfactory solution, it does, at the very least, create place holders for manuscripts that will one day (hopefully) be brought to light.\n\nSutherland’s book is a wonderful read for anyone who uses manuscript materials dating from the eighteenth-century onwards, and the connections between her arguments and the aims of CMV are exciting to see. It is perhaps only fitting to end this blog post with a final sentiment from her book. Sutherland concludes her monograph with a plea for us to protect our manuscript legacies. Manuscripts matter. They reveal the personalities of their authors and their creative processes in a way that a finished, printed edition does not. They are examples of a life spilled out (sometimes literally) on a page. They record processes of not only being, but thinking and doing. They matter.\n\n– Zoe Screti\n\nAušra Bukniutė spent six weeks at the Voltaire Foundation this past summer thanks to the UNIQ+ programme and is now working towards an MA in Modern Languages at the University of Oxford.\n\nAt the start of Candide, Voltaire’s character Pangloss famously suggests that noses are made for wearing glasses, legs for wearing stockings, and pigs for being eaten: ‘les nez ont été faits pour porter des lunettes, aussi avons-nous des lunettes[,] [l]es jambes sont visiblement instituées pour être chaussées, et nous avons des chausses […] et, les cochons étant faits pour être mangés, nous mangeons du porc toute l’année’.\n\nUnlike more logical a priori claims such as ‘economy is not ethology, neither is it enology’ (derived only from reason, not experience), Pangloss’s claims use a twisted form of reasoning by taking the effect as his point of departure. By this curious logic, simply because noses can carry glasses, they are assumed to be designed to do so. Similarly, legs must be designed for filling stockings, while pigs surely exist for the sole purpose of being turned into food. While each of these functions is viable, it is obviously false to assume that they are the only funtions of the pigs, the legs, and the noses (hence why we can laugh at Pangloss).\n\nIn demonstrating the flawed nature of a priori reasoning, Voltaire was challenging Leibnizian optimism. German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz substantially contributed to the theological debate around the existence of evil by maintaining that the actual world is the best of possible worlds. In his Théodicée (1710), he argued that God, by virtue of his omnipotence, is capable of designing, not only the actual chain of causes and effects, but also all its potential alternatives ad infinitum. The divine preference for the actual world, defined by one specific string of cause and effect, must necessarily have sound reasoning behind it, and must therefore be the best possible chain of causes and effects. However, ‘the best possible’ does not necessarily equate to ‘gratifying’ or ‘devoid of pain and misfortune’. As with the introductory examples from Candide, Leibniz’s flawed reliance on a priori eschews a wider spectrum of possibilities and predetermines the outcome of any situation.\n\nIn his philosophical satire Candide, Voltaire stretched Leibnizian optimism to its limit. The eponymous protagonist, an impressionable mentee of Professor Pangloss, subscribes to his tutor’s teachings by maintaining the validity of optimism in the presence of evil and believing that the actual world is the best of possible worlds. After a string of misfortunes and disasters, Candide, unlike his tutor, eventually becomes disillusioned and adopts a more pragmatic approach to life. While Voltaire was not attempting to provide a theoretically nuanced refutation of Leibnizian optimism, he did succeed in illustrating its flawed reliance on a priori reasoning.\n\nBut was Voltaire’s rejection of Leibnizian optimism entire? In his correspondence, we find him consoling his friends with paradoxical arguments celebrating the benefits of physical illness, disability or old age. In his letter to Charles Emmanuel de Crussol, duc d’Uzès, of 19 November 1760, he argued that for certain individuals reduced vitality is conducive to concentration and critical reflection: ‘Béni soit Dieu, de ce que vous êtes un peu malade, car lorsque les personnes de votre sorte ont de la santé, elles en abusent, elles éparpillent leur corps et leur âme de tous les côtés, mais la mauvaise santé retient un être pensant chez soi, et ce n’est qu’en méditant beaucoup, qu’on se fait des idées justes sur les choses de ce monde et de l’autre, on devient soi-même son médecin’. In a letter to Anne Marie Dauphin, baronne de Verna, of 11 August 1764, Voltaire accentuated the correlation between a weakening body and sharpness of thought : ‘Il faut que vous ayez bien de la force dans l’esprit, puisque la faiblesse du corps en donne très souvent à l’âme. Comptez, Madame, que les vraies consolations sont dans la philosophie. Une malade pleine d’esprit et de raison, est infiniment supérieure à une sotte qui crève de santé. Vous ne pouvez pas danser, mais vous savez penser; ainsi je vous félicite encore plus que je ne vous plains’. In a similar vein, on 22 May 1764, Voltaire observed to Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise Du Deffand, that blindness was surely more bearable than spiritual and cognitive frailty: ‘n’est-il pas vrai que s’il vous fallait choisir entre la lumière et la pensée vous ne balanceriez pas, et que vous préféreriez les yeux de l’âme à ceux du corps?’.\n\nAs for himself, he could celebrate the wisdom and erudition of old age in letters that end with an emphasis on his own physical impairments, such as ‘vieux malade’ or ‘l’aveugle’. In his letter to François de Chennevières of 27 June 1763, he remarked that he was both too infirm and too philosophe to spend his time corresponding with royals: ‘je suis vieux, infirme, presque aveugle, j’écris à peine à mes amis, et je suis devenu trop philosophe pour écrire à des princes’. While the correlation between infirmity and wisdom does not imply causation, it might make it easier to accept an unsatisfactory state of affairs.\n\nAs opposed to a priori, a posteriori knowledge is derived from experience or actual observation. ‘Germany’s economy is limping’, ‘a palace coup is taking place’, or ‘ten per cent of Europeans are clinically insane’ are all examples of the types of statements that could be based on a posteriori truths. Voltaire’s reflections on the themes of illness, disability and old age were clearly drawing on empirical knowledge. Instead of the Leibnizian conviction, based on flawed a priori thinking, that everything in the world, including the unsatisfactory, is the most viable actuality, Voltaire used a posteriori thinking to express positivity – or optimism in its modern sense – in the face of adversity.\n\n– Aušra Bukniutė\n\nIn the contemporary landscape, the destiny of democracy appears to be navigating divergent trajectories. On the one hand, democracy stands on the brink of achieving universal ascendancy. The modifier ‘anti-democratic’ conveys connotations of scorn and aversion, as even autocratic leaders lay claim to democratic governance. On the other hand, pervasive concerns regarding the precarious state of democratic institutions extend beyond the so-called ‘fully developed democracies’, while even these entities remain susceptible to the allure of populism and the spectre of fascism. Calls for substantive transformation to rectify the vulnerabilities inherent in democratic systems are not uncommon. Amid this interplay of sanguine and despondent perspectives, a Korean publication has emerged, offering a lucid historical treatment of democratic paradigms: Minchul Kim’s An intellectual history of democracy.\n\nPublished by the esteemed publisher Changbi and released in May 2023, this book is divided into two main parts. The initial chapter introduces the concept of democracy, emphasising the distinction between sovereignty and governance. The first part, titled ‘Anything but democracy’, spans from Antiquity to the early stages of the French Revolution. The second part, ‘Democracy revisited’, focuses on the period during and after the French Revolution. The author’s unique approach becomes apparent as the narrative unfolds. Notably, the book does not extensively cover ancient Athens or the modern USA, both of which are often considered quintessential examples of democracy. Instead, most of the book – chapters 3 to 10 – delves into European political thought from the Renaissance to the French Revolution. Rather than tracing democracy’s lineage and precursors, the author investigates the reasons behind criticism and rejection of democracy by intellectuals and politicians in different eras and traditions. These rejections of democracy, aligned with the prevailing standards of their respective times and ideological contexts, form the focal point of the exploration.\n\nWhat underlies the author’s adoption of this particular approach is the urge to contextualise the concept of democracy. Upon reviewing the historical critiques, it becomes evident that democracy was not an isolated construct, but rather an integral component of a broader analytical framework employed to expound upon the functioning of states and political entities. Chapters 3 to 6 succinctly encapsulate the intellectual output often associated with the Cambridge School of Intellectual History during the past five decades. Through the convergence of distinct ideological currents in the Early Modern period, the parlance of European political discourse attained heightened sophistication and intricacy. The author adeptly reveals the causative factors and mechanisms that facilitated this linguistic unfolding, culminating in perspectives that cast democracy as an ill-suited and perilous political arrangement.\n\nHow could a rationale favouring democracy emerge from a foundation so staunchly anti-democratic? The answer lies within Part II, particularly in the section that expounds on the thought and actions of the ‘democrats’ during the French Revolution. These democrats engaged in a point-by-point rebuttal of the anti-democratic thesis, introducing the novel concept of ‘representative democracy’, a notion far from being universally acknowledged at the time. This endeavour expanded the horizons of democracy significantly. Chapters 8 and 9, deserving of repeated contemplation, meticulously reconstruct the transformative journey in which democracy transcended its rudimentary expression of people’s political abilities, evolving into a ‘modern’ political model encompassing intricate socio-political and economic dimensions. Naturally, this evolution did not guarantee democracy’s unqualified triumph. The concluding chapter of the book succinctly outlines the nineteenth-century liberals’ process of formulating the idea of ‘liberal democracy’, a construct that effectively eclipsed the radical perspectives inherent in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conception of democratic governance.\n\nAn intellectual history of democracy explores a wide array of complex topics, which cannot easily be boiled down to a single summary. Nonetheless, the book effectively presents these topics in a clear and engaging manner. The author uses straightforward language to bring together various strands from the forefront of academic research, making the book accessible and interesting to a diverse readership, from newcomers to seasoned researchers and individuals interested in politics. This book is a timeless read that offers the opportunity to discover new elements to feed into our everyday political and historical reflections.\n\n– Woochang Lee (Korea National Open University)\n\nAuthors have a long tradition of spreading the legend of the crimes of the Borgias, as recently explored in The Borgia family: rumour and representation, edited by Jennifer Mara DeSilva – and Voltaire was no exception. Huguenot writers such as Jean Crespin and Philippe de Mornay accused Pope Alexander VI of crimes as various as making deals with the devil, practising necromancy, committing incest with his daughter, and making deals with the Ottoman Empire. Also available in Early Modern France were translations of works by authors such as Francesco Guicciardini, Tomaso Tomasi and Alexander Gordon who were equally hostile to Pope Alexander VI and his son Cesare.\n\nVoltaire repeated many of the accusations that make up the Borgia mythology: their rise to power through corruption, frequent employment of deception and murder, tyrannical rule, and incestuous relations. He wrote about them no more kindly than authors of nations with whom the Borgias had been less friendly than France. Indeed, while Pope Alexander VI initially held an anti-French position, working against Charles VIII’s 1494 invasion of Italy, he later reversed this policy, aligning himself with Louis XII in 1499. This alliance saw his son Cesare married to the French princess Charlotte d’Albret and made the Duke of Valentinois, in return for the pope annulling the king’s marriage to Joan of France so he could marry Anne of Brittany and establish the rule of the French crown over her duchy. Despite these gains, the Borgian legacy in France was as sordid as elsewhere, stoked by anti-papal, anti-clerical, and anti-Catholic feelings. Indeed, the Borgias’ French alliance did little to help their reputation with Voltaire – or that of their royal ally. In 1753, Voltaire distinguished the Borgias’ ambition from that of ‘good king’ Louis XII, justifying the latter’s cooperation with them on the grounds of necessity: ‘Son père le pape et lui [Cesare] réussirent par l’empoisonnement et le meurtre; et le bon roi Louis XII avait été longtemps lié avec ces deux hommes sanguinaires, parce qu’il avait besoin d’eux’. [1] By 1768 however, Voltaire deemed that Louis XII had dishonoured himself by allying with the Borgias: ‘C’est ainsi que le bon roi Louis XII […] s’était déshonoré en s’unissant avec le monstre Alexandre VI et son exécrable bâtard le duc Borgia’. [2]\n\nVoltaire regularly portrayed Pope Alexander as dishonourable. He repeated the oft-cited claim that Rodrigo Borgia managed to bribe his way to the Holy See despite having an unsuitable bevy of illegitimate children: ‘Les cardinaux qui l’élurent, savaient qu’il élevait cinq enfants nés de son commerce avec Vanoza. Ils devaient prévoir que tous les biens, les honneurs, l’autorité seraient entre les mains de cette famille. Cependant ils le choisirent pour maître. Les chefs des factions du conclave vendirent pour de modiques sommes leurs intérêts, et ceux de l’Italie’. [3] He also claimed that Alexander and his son Cesare would use treachery to accomplish their goals, hypothesising that, if one of them had wanted to take La Rochelle, ‘il aurait invité dans son camp les principaux chefs sous un serment sacré, et se serait défait d’eux’. [4] For Voltaire, such murderous habits most notably characterised Cesare, who faced the familiar accusation of having killed his own brother in the Essai sur les mœurs, an allegation drawn from Guicciardini who no doubt coloured much of Voltaire’s view of the Borgias. [5] As for Alexander’s daughter and Cesare’s sister Lucrezia, Voltaire repeated the infamous accusation of incest: ‘On sait qu’elle couchait avec son frère et son père, et qu’elle avait des évêques pour valets de chambre’. [6]\n\nWhile Voltaire does not go into further detail on Lucrezia’s alleged relationships with her father and brother (an accusation concocted by the Borgias’ enemies), he makes other allusions to the Borgias’ sexual proclivities. In the Essai sur les mœurs he describes an orgy in the Vatican hosted by the pope where fifty courtesans performed for those present: ‘Ces noces furent célébrées au Vatican, par la plus infâme réjouissance que la débauche ait jamais inventée et qui ait effrayé la pudeur. Cinquante courtisanes nues dansèrent devant cette famille incestueuse, et des prix furent donnés aux mouvements les plus lascifs’. [7] The number of courtesans narrows this event to the alleged ‘Banquet of Chestnuts’, a chestnut-themed supper at the Apostolic Palace where fifty courtesans supposedly entertained the papal court and participated in contests of sexual prowess with attendees. Despite being largely dismissed as implausible by many contemporaries and eyed sceptically by historians, the Banquet of Chestnuts remains an enduring part of the Borgia mythos.\n\nPart of the Borgia legend that Voltaire did dispute is the idea that Pope Alexander died of poison. Legend had it that Alexander and Cesare accidentally poisoned themselves when trying to murder a cardinal, leading to the Pope’s death and the duke being seriously unwell. Voltaire was not convinced that these were the effects of poison however, suggesting several times that they were caused instead by a simple fever: ‘Enfin le journal de la maison de Borgia porte que le pape âgé de soixante et douze ans fut attaqué d’une fièvre tierce, qui bientôt devint continue et mortelle. Ce n’est pas là l’effet du poison’. [8] Voltaire would not be alone in proposing this theory, with various historians of the last 150 years casting doubt upon the Borgias’ use of poisons. [9]\n\nWhile Voltaire may have been sceptical about this one aspect of the Borgia legend, he was otherwise happy to use the Borgias as examples of some of the worst villainy in history. So certain was he of their dishonourable acts, proclivity for murder, embrace of tyranny, and indulgence of incest that he writes: ‘On a peine à croire de telles atrocités; mais s’il est quelque chose d’avéré dans l’histoire, ce sont les crimes d’Alexandre VI et de sa famille’. [10] The pillars of the ‘Black Legend’ to which Voltaire lent his support continue to stand within the popular imagination of Renaissance history to this day.\n\n– Thomas Wood\n\n[1] Annales de l’Empire depuis Charlemagne, ‘Maximilien, Quarantième empereur’, OCV, vol.44C, p.16.\n\n[2] Les Droits des hommes et les usurpations des papes, OCV, vol.67, p.161.\n\n[3] Essai sur les mœurs et l’esprit des nations (1756), ch.106, OCV, vol.25, p.40.\n\n[4] Le Siècle de Louis XIV (1733), ch.6, OCV, vol.13A, p.120.\n\n[5] ‘Le duc de Gandie fut assassiné dans Rome: la voix publique imputa ce meurtre au cardinal Borgia, et Guichardin n’hésite pas à l’en accuser’ (Essai sur les mœurs, ch.110, OCV, vol.25, p.88).\n\n[6] Les Droits des hommes et les usurpations des papes, OCV, vol.67, p.167.\n\n[7] Essai sur les mœurs, ch.110, OCV, vol.25, p.87-88.\n\n[8] Essai sur les mœurs, ch.111, OCV, vol.25, p.113–14.

This book changes our understanding of when, how, and why modern ideas of literature emerged in France. In this blog post, Gemma Tidman shares some insight into her new book in the form of a memory from when she was conducting the research in Paris.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, I found myself waiting at a drawbridge. Let me explain. I spent that year in Paris, conducting research for my book, The Emergence of literature in eighteenth-century France: The Battle of the school books. The book tells a new history of when, how, and why modern ideas of literature emerged in France, propelled – in part – by a quarrel about teaching reform and national identity.\n\nI had a hunch that the Royal Military School, founded by Louis XV in 1751, played a part in this history. This school was an innovative institution, distinct from the traditional boys’ collèges and their Latin-centric literary curriculum. As one early document in the school’s archives put it, ‘l’éducation d’un Collège de cette espèce ne tiendroit rien des principes de l’éducation que l’on reçoit dans les Collèges ordinaires’. [1]\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, the military school’s innovation has often been seen to lie in its teaching of disciplines sidelined by the collèges, such as mathematics, engineering, and the art of warfare. But this wasn’t all the school had to offer. Its programme changed over time, especially in the wake of the quarrel that emerged in 1762 about whether and how to reform collège-level literary teaching, following the expulsion of the Jesuits (who ran a third of France’s collèges) and the publication of Rousseau’s controversial novel about education, Émile, ou de l’éducation. I’ve called this debate the Querelle des collèges.\n\nScholars have elucidated some of the school’s innovations in humanities teaching: in French, history, and modern languages. [2] But what about ‘littérature’, specifically? This term became a keyword in the Querelle des collèges, often used to designate great, pleasing texts that should be taught to France’s future elite. In this debate, ‘littérature’ increasingly came to refer to a national canon, apt for a country out to reclaim power and patriotic pride in the aftermath of the Seven Years’ War. ‘Littérature’ was a word, moreover, that allowed anti-Jesuit reformers to distance themselves from the classical programme of ‘belles-lettres’ taught by the Jesuit Order. But did all this talk change anything in classrooms? Was ‘littérature’ actually taught in any public schools, pre-Revolution? Since the military school was often praised by reformers in the Querelle, I thought it was worth a closer look.\n\nToday, the Parisian École militaire’s archives are spread across two sites: the Archives nationales, in the Marais, and the Service historique de la Défense, housed in the fourteenth-century Château de Vincennes. [3] And like any self-respecting medieval fortress, the latter is accessed by a pretty excellent drawbridge. It was here, one morning in 2015, that my research got a shot in the arm.\n\nThat morning, while waiting for the archives to open, one of my fellow archival inmates – an older French gentleman – asked what I was researching. ‘L’enseignement littéraire à l’École militaire, au dix-huitième siècle’, I explained. My new friend puffed his cheeks. ‘Ho ! Vous ne trouverez pas beaucoup, à mon avis’, he said, shaking his head as he chuckled. Well, that was all it took. If there was anything in these archives, the merest hint of literature, I would find it. And, reader, I’m relieved to say there was.\n\nThere was the transformation, in 1764, of the ex-Jesuit Collège de La Flèche into a royal preparatory collège for the École militaire. This new school was to give all pupils a foundational education in the humanities. Then there were the reading books military school pupils could borrow from the library: predominantly French authors of the ‘grand siècle’ (Boileau, Corneille, Fénelon, La Bruyère, La Fontaine…), and collected biographies of the lives of great Frenchmen.\n\nThere was also the Director of Studies, Jean Dromgold, who wrote in 1774 that ‘l’enseignement de la grammaire et de la littérature françoise est un point trop important dans l’éducation de la jeune noblesse françoise, pour ne pas s’en occuper sérieusement’. [4] Teachers of ‘grammaire et littérature française’ were appointed in the early 1770s, around the time that the Collège royal, in 1773, abolished its Chaire de philosophie grecque et latine – held by the abbé Batteux from 1750 to 1773 – and replaced it with a Chaire de littérature française. Perhaps the two royal institutions influenced one another, or perhaps ‘littérature’ was simply gaining traction.\n\nIndeed, in 1776, Batteux was commissioned to produce the teaching manual for ten new regional military schools. While this vast manual had a chequered history, it opens with an abridged version of Batteux’s own literary manual which had begun life as the Cours de belles-lettres (1747–1748), before being republished as the Principes de littérature (1755). This was not the school’s only important literary teaching manual, however. In 1784, the Parisian École militaire’s then Chaire de grammaire et de littérature française, Louis Domairon, produced the Principes généraux des belles-lettres (1784–1785). This textbook describes ‘littérature’ in modern terms, as a type of great, crafted text, studied within the discipline of ‘belles-lettres’. The literary extracts that Domairon comments focus on the values the military school sought to inculcate: heroism, eloquence, and patriotic duty to the king.\n\nIf the military school used ‘littérature’ as a tool to form great Frenchmen, some would say it worked. As I discuss in my book, many of the school’s alumni maintained an engagement with literature in their careers as writers, teachers, diplomats, politicians and – in the case of the school’s most famous alumnus – as Emperor of the French. In a thoroughly Bourdieusian move, when Napoleon founded the small commission charged with deciding the literary syllabus for the first lycées, he appointed to it his former teacher, Louis Domairon… who swiftly put his own textbook, the Ancien Régime military school’s literary manual, (back) on the menu.\n\nThere are probably lots of morals to this little story. About the value, and power, of a humanities education. About the unexpected people and institutions involved in the history of modern ideas of ‘littérature’. About how the briefest chance conversation can sometimes be just what you needed. I should really thank my incredulous archival comrade for feeling chatty that morning in 2015. Perhaps I’ll head back to the drawbridge one day to tell him what I found.\n\n– Gemma Tidman, Queen Mary, University of London\n\n[1] ‘The education provided at a college of this kind will have nothing to do with the education one receives in a typical college’.
