        "text": "The following table lists all of the principal authors named in the first eighteen tomes of TUI 1584. (The remaining tomes are index volumes.). Some, but not all of the co-authors, authors of additiones, etc., are listed. The list will eventually be expanded to include all of these as well. The names are asigned a unique number that proceeds alphabetically according to the lemma. Most of the authors are given a brief biography, but in some cases, particularly in tomes 5 through 18, we simply gave a reference to where a biography can be found. We spent more time on those authors who are not well known or who have been misidentified in the past.\n\nTUI 1584 gives the authorsâ names in Latin. Starting at some uncertain date around 1200 or a bit later, library catalogues tend to give them in the vernacular; modern biographical dictionaries do so too, particularly when they are national biographies. We rather suspect that some of our authorsâ mothers would be quite surprised at the vernacular names that have been assigned to their sons, particularly when there is no contemporary evidence to support the assignment. The damage is, however, done. Normally, if one wants to find a TUI 1584 author in modern scholarship, one needs the vernacular name. With this in mind, we have listed our authors from 1200 on under their vernacular names, unless the author is normally listed under his Latin name or unless we could not find him. Similarly, library cataloguers tend to list our authors alphabetically under the second element of the name, imagining it to be a surname, even though it frequently is not. Since it takes some doing to get from the Latin name in TUI to the vernacular surname, we have given cross-references from all the Latin names in TUI 1584 to the name where the main entry is found. These cross-references begin with the authorâs Christian name, e.g., Achilles Personalis Mirandulanus, not Personalis, Achilles, Mirandulus. In a few cases we have also given the inverted version of the name as well, e.g., Aegidius, Jacobus, where we are aware that library catalogues list him that way. Christian names of authors given in TUI 1584 are somewhat normalized; for example, all authors with the Christian name âJohnâ are listed under âJoannesâ, ignoring the spelling variations that are found in TUI 1584 and elsewhere.\n\nMost library catalogues make an exception for authors who are known only by their Christian name and what is obviously a toponym. DGI and DBI follow this practice as well, and so have we. Hence, Antonius de Butrio will be found under Antonio da Budrio, and not Budrio, Antonio da.\n\nThere is considerable variation in library catalogues in the listing of surnames that have a prefix (de, le, von, etc.). Our listings invert these prefixes. Hence, Nicolaus de Lescut will be found under Escut, Nicolas de lâ, not lâEscut (or Lescut), Nicolas de.\n\nThe dating of the authors is complicated. Ideally, each author should be accompanied by the place and date of his birth and the place and date of his death, e.g., b. Milano 1492, d. Pavia 1550. We do not have, and probably never will have, solid information on all four items for all of the authors. Varying degrees and types of uncertainty are indicated by: a â?â before the item; âca.â for circa, âa.â for ante and âp.â for post before a date; âXâ for bracketing dates, or the word âorâ. A forward slash in a date, e.g., 1313/14 (used where the source does not indicate what convention it is using), means either 1313 or 1314 or that the event happened betwen 1 January and 25 March in 1314, using the modern beginning of the year of grace. Where one or more of the four items is known but not all of them, what is missing is indicated by an ellipsis. If known and if one or both of the dates are lacking, one or more floruit dates are also given. Hence, âb. ?Bologna . . . , fl. 1398 X 1412, d. Bologna . . . â means that the author was probably born in Bologna, that he is known to have died in Bologna, that neither his date of birth or death is known, but that he is found in documents dating between 1398 and 1412.\n\nWhere none of the four items is known, we have used floruit dates. Where not even those are known, we attempted to place our authors in a century, e.g. âsec. 16â, where âsec.â stands for âcenturyâ. Where some, but not much, precision is possible, âsec. 16/1â, âsec. 16/mâ, and âsec. 16/2â, stand for the first half, middle, and second half of the century respectively, and âsec. 16/ineunteâ stands for the beginning of the named century, âsec. 16/exeunteâ the ending.\n\nFuther information about our assignment of dates and places may be found here.\n\nThe search for the authors was not particularly systematic. We pursued them pretty much in this order, in DGI, DBI, Lange and Lange/Kriechbaum (only where the dates were early enough to make the pursuit worthwhile), DHJF, MEMJ, NDB, and ADB. (For DBE, see below). As a general matter, if we found them there, we did pursue them any further. Failing these, we went to the CERL Thesaurus. The Thesaurus is a work in progress. Since it is derived from library catalogues, it is no better than is the information in those catalogues, and some of it is quite obviously wrong. The entries, however, almost always provide useful clues. From the Thesaurus, we pursued sources online, including digital copies of the authorâs works, until we reached an identification that we thought was reliable or, in a couple of cases, until we reached the point where it seemed clear that the author was obscure indeed.\n\nThe following bibliographical abbreviations are used: ADB = Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, 56 vols.

Vallone, in DGI; G. Vallone, in DBI (vol. 31 [1985]); C. Donahue, in MEMJ. A. was the son of Marino of a well-known family originally from Scala (prov. Salerno) on the Amalfi coast. The branch to which A. belonged had been in Napoli since the early 15th century and produced a series of high magistrates and officers of the crown, including Leonardo who was the grand chancellor of King Ladislao. A. studied law under Antonio dâAlessandro. In 1468, he received his doctorate in civil law and, somewhat after, that in canon law. A. attracted the attention of the Aragonese monarchy early in his career. Although he never held a professorship, he lectured in civil, royal, and feudal law, for over twenty years, for which he received a royal stipend. In 1488, while A. was simply a practicing lawyer, the future King Alfonso [II] invited him to offer his opinion on a case before the Regio Consiglio. In 1489 he was appointed judge of the Gran Corte della Vicaria, and in 1491 he became president of the Gran Camera della Sommaria. During the French occupation in 1495, A. remained in the Sommaria, faithful to the house of Aragon. He was named to the Regio Consiglio, when Ferdinando II was restored to power in that year. During the reign of Louis XII of France, A. was removed from the Consiglio and the Sommaria in 1501. In this year or the next, he managed to obtain the noble Seggio di Nido (Sedile di Nilo).\n\nWhen the Spanish displaced the French in the Regno in 1504, A. was restored to his positions on the Consiglio and the Sommaria. But in 1506, Ferdinand the Catholic dismissed him from his judicial offices and also expelled him from the Seggio di Nido, for reasons that remain obscure. He was appointed to a magistracy in Vicaria in 1512. He probably served on the Sommaria during at least some of the last years of life, but he was never restored to the Consiglio, and he seems to have devoted most of his time to giving consilia and to writing.\n\nIn 1468, A. married Orsina Carafa, the daughter of the canonist Giovanni Antonio, by whom he had at least one son, who became a priest. Widowed, he married, around 1501, Diana Carmignano, who was considerably younger than he, and by whom he had at least three sons who survived him. His death date is unclear; he was certainly dead by April of 1529.\n\nAâs scholarly production was large, and not all of his known works, notably his consilia, have yet been found, and some survive only in manuscript. Between 1475 and 1480, he wrote a commentary on the feudal law while he was lecturing on that topic. His work addressed the Aragonese monarchy's need to distinguish between feudal and royal jurisdiction, between fiefdom and office, because the monarchy was focused on the latter. The commentary reflects the monarchy's anti-feudal ideology. A. is known to have revised the work around 1505. The first known printing, though not necessarily the first printing, is that of Venezia, 1543â1547.\n\nAâs Tractatus de jure prothomiseos (t. 17) probably dates from the same period. The term, derived from Greek âprotimesisâ describes an institution similar to the French retrait lignagier or the German Einstandrecht. The work is an extended commentary on a constitution of Frederick II on the topic. It was published in Venezia in 1499 along with the treatise on the same topic by Baldus, which follows it in TUI 1584. The work was reprinted a number of times in the 16th century.\n\nWhile A. was on the Consiglio, he compiled a well-known collection of its Decisiones (1st ed. 1509), which was published with the help of his cousin Michele, another high magistrate, and many times reprinted, frequently with decisions of the same court by other reporters.\n\nA. began a commentary to the Liber Augustalis of Frederick II in 1510 and completed it in 1514. The first-known edition was printed in Trino (prov. Vercelli) in 1517. This writing linked A. inextricably to Frederick II and was intended to supplant previous commentaries on the Liber augustalis. Vallone quotes a description of it as âthe last great voice of the Guelph regalism of the Angevin tradition and the Aragonese connectionâ. A. embedded his commentary in the editio princeps of the Liber augustalis of 1475, or, perhaps, the second edition of 1506, collating it with manuscripts. Almost all the printed editions of the Liber augustalis after his time use A.âs summaries of the titles of the work.\n\nAâs most important work that remains in manuscript is the repetitio, Super c. unico de natura successionis feudi (L.F. 2.50), dated 1520, which is preserved in Palermo, BM 2 Qq.A.10.\n\nC. Donahue and Mary Beth Chopas, in MEMJ. G. S. Pene Vidari in DGI, 1.207â8 offers an assessment of B. that we find convincing and that we attempt to summarize here: B. was from a prominent family of Alba (prov. Cuneo), who were in military service to the marquis of Monferrato. B., however, dedicated himself to the study of law at Perugia. From 1533, he practiced law in service to Monferrato and the Empire, filling various offices in an area devastated by the local wars and by the widespread clashes between the French and the imperial forces. In 1546, he was appointed uditore generale di guerra (roughly, judge advocate general) of the imperial army operating in the area. In 1560, after the peace of Cateau CambrÃ©sis, Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy appointed B. a councillor of state. He was successful in his work as consultant and diplomatic representative, and was known for his ability to handle difficult and complex international legal disputes. As a result, he rose socially and economically, and acquired land. He and his son became members of the ruling elite of the time.\n\nBâs only known work, De re militari et bello, finished in 1558, published in Venezia in 1563 and reprinted in TUI 1584, was the product of long experience. As an author Bâs method was that of Italian humanism rather than Italian Bartolism. He knew the sources, both ancient and more recent, that could be applied to the problems of military law and war, but his practical experience freed him from the excessively academic. His experience had convinced him that much in the practice of war in his time was morally and legally unacceptable especially as it concerned non-combatants. In his hands humanism became what we would call humanitarian, as he sought in his treatise to use reason and law to curb the excesses to which war had led in his time.\n\nB. was aware that political changes in his time called for a revision of the traditional approaches to international relations. He was on the imperial side, but he recognized the plurality of princes. Unlike Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius, however, who later wrote on the same topics, B. did not recognize religious pluralism, but remained an orthodox Catholic. His understanding, moreover, was that of a writer of the mid-16th century. He did not foresee the new international legal order that would emerge in the 17th. He relied on the traditional principles of aequitas and naturalis ratio, making his vision more medieval than totally modern.\n\nThe De re militari deals with the question of the legitimacy of war. It distinguishes between ius ad bellum and ius in bello, and thus anticipates a distinction usually attributed either to Gentili or Grotius. He strongly supported the rights of the neutrals and the legal duty not to harm defenseless persons or goods unrelated to the belligerents. He supported the use of arbitration to prevent the use of force. In all these ways he anticipates much that is still with us in the field of public international law.\n\nBâs De re militari seems to have been forgotten after the 16th century. It was rediscovered in the 20th with the publication of the Oxford edition of 1936 with an English translation (intr. Arrigo Cavaglieri) in the Classics of International Law series, followed by that of Alba in 2006 with and Italian translation (intr. Benedetto Conforti), and finally that of Alba in 2007 with a French translation by Dominique Gaurier.\n\nA. De Benedictis, in DGI 1:278-8. C. Donahue and M. B. Chopas, in MEMJ. B. was born into a family originally from Lucca, the members of which had long been citizens of Bologna. The family were one of the most important and richest in Bologna, connected to the merchant class in sympathy and financially. B. completed his legal studies at the Bolognese studium under Alessandro Tartagni and Andrea Barbazza, receiving his doctorate in civil law in 1469, and that in canon law in 1470. He taught at Bologna at various times throughout his life, lecturing on the Institutes, the Sext, the Clementines, the Code, all three parts of the Digest, and, at the end of his life, the Decretals.\n\nDuring a brief stay in Ferrara in the 1470s, B. was a judge of appeals there. At the Roman Curia (probably in 1486â89) he was a consistorial advocate, an office that he continued to hold by the authority of Innocent VIII after he had left Roma. He was one of judges of the âAnziani Consoliâ in Bologna in 1479, 1487, 1493, and 1506. In 1482 and 1493, he was a judge of the âForo dei Mercantiâ. In 1496, he was part of the âGonfalonieri del Popolo,â who from that year were also called âTribuni della Plebeâ. In 1494, on the eve of the Italian wars, the king of France, Charles VIII, named B. a councillor. During the lordship of the Bentivoglio, B. was never among the authoritative âSedici Riformatori dello Stato di LibertÃ â, but when Julius II ousted the Bentivoglio (1506), he replaced the Sedici with the âmagistratura dei Quarantaâ of which B. was a member. In the five years of his stay in Firenze, between 1501 and 1505, B. was judge of the Rota and podestÃ in 1503.\n\nB. legated his patrimonial library to the Libraria nova of San Domenico, a testimony to his ties with the Dominican order, although the Libraria nova ultimately got only a part of Bâs library. In 1496, when the âmal franceseâ was discovered in the Italian peninsula, B. was active along with others in the restoring the hospital of San Lorenzo dei Guerrini, later called San Giobbe, for the treatment of syphilis patients. His pro-papal position did not prevent him from defending the cityâs jurisdiction when Julius II wanted to subjugate it completely to his legate. In 1507, at the height of the Italian wars, he was twice appointed ambassador to Louis XII, with the mission to convince the king of France to abandon the Bentivolesco party. From Lyon, where he was in February 1508, B. returned to Roma in May to report to the pope. But at the beginning of July, struck by illness, he left for Bologna. He got worse and had to stop in Firenze in the convent of San Miniato, where he died on 27 July.\n\nAmong the many works of which B. was the author or editor, the repetitiones on fragments of the Corpus Iuris Civilis are connected with his teaching and were printed in Ferrara and Venezia in 1475; in Bologna in 1476, 1481, 1490, 1492, 1494, and 1495. They are also found in the Lyon collection of repetitiones of 1533. In particular, the Repetitio sup. Â§ Cato. l. iiii. ff. de uerbo. obliga. (Dig. 45.1.4.1), published in Bologna at the end of 1490, contained a restoration of that text on the basis of the littera Florentina, about which L. had corresponded with the Florentine humanist Angelo Poliziano. At this point that B. realized that philology was required for textual criticism. This realization is evidenced in his handwritten notes, written in 1501â02 while he was in Firenze, on an incunabulum of the Digestum novum (Venezia 1489) (now in Bologna, Bibl. dellâArchiginnasio, 16. D. I. 14). Much textual criticism is contained in his manuscript notebooks, formerly at San Domenico and now in the Archiginnasio (B. 1415, B. 1416, B. 1417, B. 1418 and B. 1567). Among these B. 1418 stands out, a first draft of a project to transcribe the Florentine Pandects, a project not realized until the Torelli edition of 1553. Bâs two volumes of Interpretationes novae (Bologna 1494â95, 1497) are also dedicated to textual criticism of the legal books. Since the sixteenth century, the quality of Bâs work has been the subject of unflattering judgments. Recently the harshness of those judgments has been questioned (Murano, Balbi, but cf. Osler).\n\nIn 1486 and 1489, B. published two works on canon law: Syllogianthon, seu Collectio florum in Decretum and De indulgentiis (t. 14), and, again in 1489, one in utroque iure, the Forma arboris consanguinitatis secundum ius canonicum et civile. In 1499, a volume of his Consilia was published; it had numerous subsequent editions (Venezia 1504 and 1576, Lyon 1556 and 1597, Frankfurt 1597).\n\nB. was also the editor of works of others. In 1475 he published the Consilia of NiccolÃ² Tedeschi and in 1481 those of his teacher Alessandro Tartagni, to which he added a repertorium (1484) in which he devised new criteria for indexing. Both collections were many times reprinted. In 1495, B. published the Consilia of Giovanni da Imola. He edited (Bologna 1489, Torino 1490) the collection recently called the Tractatus deorum: De successionibus ab intestato by Matteo Mattesillani; De beneficiorum permutatione by Pietro degli Ubaldi; De translatione Concilii Basileae ad civitatem Ferrarie of Cataldino de Boncompagni; the quaestio of Signorolo degli Omodei De praecedentia doctoris et militis; and De materia tormentorum by Guido da Suzzara.\n\nFinally, a long and elaborate allegatio on the validity of the statutes of the universitas mercatorum, written in 1482 while B. was a judge of the âForo dei Mercantiâ, survives in manuscript (Bologna, Bibl. Univ. Lat. 897) and a work on the Privilegium Theodosii pro universitate Bononiae concessum survives in print (Bologna 1491).\n\nM. Tocci, in DGI. A. Mazzacane, in DBI 16 (1973). C. Donahue, in MEMJ. C. was born of a family which had moved from Pisa to Piombino (prov. Livorno) when the Florentines conquered Pisa in 1406. He studied both at Siena and Pisa; he earned his doctorate at the latter in 1525, having studied under Filippo Decio, Ormanozzo Deti and Mariano Socini the younger. He took up the position of judge of appeals and of the mercantile court in Lucca in 1527, but ceded that position to a candidate favored by the duke of Urbino. He returned to Piombino where he served as podestÃ on a number of occasions. In 1530, he went with Jacopo V Appiani, the lord of Piombino, to the coronation of Carlo V at Bologna. The latter named him count palatine and cavaliere aurato in 1537. C. served as auditor of the Sienese Rota in 1541. In 1545, he became a member of the regency council at Piombino for Jacopo VI, whose tutor he became. He served as ambassador both at the imperial court and at that of the Medici.\n\nIn 1547, C. appears for the first time as an ordinary professor civil law at Pisa, giving what seem to be repetitiones on Dig. 1.21, Cod. 6.9, Dig. 12.1, and Cod. 2.1. He was a member of the college of jurists at Pisa, and gave many consilia. With the death of his senior colleague at the university, he obtained the chair as first lecturer on civil law in 1555, a position that he held for the rest of his long life. The last document that testifies that he was still alive is dated in June of 1586.\n\nCâs published works all seem to date from the 1560s. They include repetitiones: Enarrationes in aliquot leges Digestorum (Firenze 1564) (included in vol. 1 of Repetitones in varias iuris civilis Leges [Venezia 1608]) and Enarrationes in Rub. C. de edendo (Bologna 1566). 1564 also saw the publication in Lucca of his Speculum verae politicae nobilitatis, an elaboration on the Bartolan distinction between ânaturalâ and âpoliticalâ nobility. Mazzacane describes this work, which was also translated into Italian, at some length. Both Mazzacane and Tocci date Câs De equestri dignitate et principibus to 1567 (t. 18) without giving it a place of publication. The first edition that we have found is that of Milano 1581. C. is said to have rendered some 600 consilia, but according to Mazzacane and Tocci the only ones that have been found are those that G. B. Ziletti inserted in his Consilia criminalia (Venezia 1582). The online edition of the ed. 1560 suggests that these are not consilia, but decisions that C. rendered when he was auditor of the Sienese Rota (?1541).\n\nE. Cortese in DGI 1:439-40. C. Donahue and M. B. Chopas, in MEMJ. C., the son of Tommaso, was destined for an ecclesiastical career. He held various chaplaincies at a young age. Probably by 1433, he had received a doctorate utriusque iuris at the studium in Napoli. The head of the Carafa family, Antonio, called âMaliziaâ, had been supporting the Aragonese since 1420. He persuaded Alfonso V âthe Magnanimousâ of Aragon to promote C. as archbishop of Salerno in 1439, but the move did not succeed, and C. abandoned the clerical state and became a layman. When Alfonso took over Napoli in 1442, he made C. the castellan of Castel Capuano. From 1449 C. was a judge of the Sommaria and a member of the Sacro Regio Consiglio. On the death of Alfonso in 1458, the new king, Ferrante, confirmed C. in all his offices, and made him president of the Sacro Regio Consiglio in 1463.\n\nC. claimed that he had taught at the studium from 1425, but he is documented as teaching civil law there only from 1453. In 1463, he began to lecture in canon law, and did so for the rest of his life. When Jean dâAnjou attacked Napoli in 1459, C. began to work at the studium at a slower pace and only intermittently. In 1460, he conducted a doctoral exam in his own house. In September of 1463, with the defeat of Angevins at hand, King Ferrante wanted to revive the studium. He made C. the vice-chancellor and authorized him give both ordinary and extraordinary lectures. In January of 1465, the studium was solemnly refounded with a papal bull, and C. was charged to reform it. From that time forward he was the star of the school and of canon law in Napoli. At the time of the repression of the conspiracy of the barons in 1486, C. was among the judges who condemned Francesco Coppola and Antonello Petrucci and their two sons to death.\n\nMost of Câs writing remains in manuscript. The only printed work that we know of is his treatise De simonia first published in Napoli (GW 06117; Jodokus Hohenstein, after 1477; reprinted Roma 1556; TUI 1584 t. 15.2). Cortese calls particular attention to Câs repetitio on the regula âPeccatumâ (VI 5.12.[6.4]), probably given in 1479â80. Cortese also tells us that C. is known to have written other treatises, De ambitu, De iubilaeo, De restitutionibus, and a commentary on the Justinianâs Code. Many of Câs consilia and repetitiones have recently been discovered in manuscripts at the Vatican (Vat. lat. 5922; Vat. Barb lat. 1493) and at the Collegio di Spagna in Bologna (H. c 173 n. 6).\n\nC. married Caterina dâAcaia. They had eight children, one of whom, Orsina, married the famous Neapolitan jurist Matteo DâAfflitto, who used to cite his father-in-law, distinguishing him from the antiqui doctores.\n\nE. Spagnesi, in DGI. M. Palma, in DBI (22 [1979]). C. Donahue and M. B. Chopas, in MEMJ. C. is frequently called âil vecchioâ or âseniorâ, to distinguish him from his grandson, a humanist of the early 15th century of the same name. The toponym that serves as their surname is now a neighborhood in Rignano sullâArno (cittÃ metropolitana Firenze) in the Val di Sieve about 20 km. southeast of Firenze. Câs family descended from the Lombard lords of Quona (not precisely identified) in the Val, aristocrats but not high nobility. This family history influenced the ideas that C. expressed in Italian in his Epistola to his son Bernardo (ed. L. Mehus, Bologna 1753; ed. again in Antica possessione con belli costumi: due giornate di studio su Lapo da Castiglionchio il Vecchio (Firenze-Pontassieve, 3-4 ottobre 2003) [Firenze 2005]), a document that is taken to illustrate the intellectual pride of âthe noblesâ.\n\nWe first see C. around 1353, when he is studying canon law with Giovanni Calderini in Bologna, but we know that before that he was associated with the circle of Florentine literary friends of Francesco Petrarca (Zanobi da Strada, Francesco Nelli, and Giovanni Boccaccio). They regarded Câs move to law as a kind of apostasy. They continued to share, however, similar social and political views, views that tended to elitism, support of the Guelfs, and of the Florentine oligarchy.\n\nWhen Firenze reopened its studium in 1357, C., now a doctor, was paid, in some cases quite handsomely, to lecture, at various times, on the Decretals, the Sext, and the Clementines. The payments continued only until 1369â70, but it is possible he continued to teach for free until 1378, the year of his exile. He had illustrious colleagues in Firenze including the Perugian Baldo degli Ubaldi, who was such a good friend that C. was godfather to his son Giovanni in 1360. A list of Câs library survives. On the civil-law side he had only the basics: Azzone, Roffredo, Accursio, Bartolo, and of Corpus iuris civilis only the Institutes. On the canon-law side, he had all the parts of the Corpus iuris canonici that were available in his time and a full representation of the literature: the 13th-century masters, such as Bartolommeo da Brescia, Ostiense, Durante; the masters of the previous generation such as Giovanni dâAndrea, Alessandro dellâAntella, Guillaume de Montlauzun, Jesselin de Cassagnes, and contemporaries such as Giovanni Calderini, Federico Petrucci, Paolo de Liazari.\n\nC. played an important role in Florentine politics. Within the city, he served as: âconsoleâ, âconsigliereâ, member of the âArte dei giudici e notaiâ, âsapienteâ, âconsigliere del Comuneâ, and captain of the Guelf party. Outside the city, he was podestÃ of Monsummano and ambassador to the pope at Avignon, where he gave three discourses that survive; ambassador to Lucca, to Siena, and to Genova. C. went too far, however, in the name of the Guelph party, in the use of warnings (âammonizioniâ) and proscription, attracting the hatred of many. After the revolt of the Ciompi of 1378, from which he was lucky to escape, he was declared a rebel, sentenced to death, and the confiscation of his property, and ultimately to exile in Barcelona. Permission to kill him was given to anyone who found him elsewhere. But the following year, despite the warnings sent by the Florentine government, he was called to lecture on the Decretals at Padova. Following that he was in Roma, to which the pope had returned from Avignon. Urban VI made him a senator, and C. pronounced the official prayer when the pope invested Carlo di Durazzo with the kingdom of Napoli. It seems that C., with others of the exiles, was planning to intervene in Florentine affairs. In January 1381, a few months before his death of natural causes, there was an attempt to poison him.\n\nThe three short unpublished works called Disputationes in studio paduano (a quaestio and two repetitiones) may be connected with his stay in Padova. The repetitio known as Tractatus de hospitalitate (t. 14) certainly stems from Câs experiences in Firenze. In it C. shows that Firenze had the most ancient system of what was elsewhere a new and complicated hospital law. The De canonico portione et de quarta (t. 15.2), which Panciroli suspected was the work of Panormitano, is also, almost certainly, Câs.\n\nCâs Allegationes were his best-known work, as is evidenced by the subsequent reworkings of it. Spagnesi describes them as the first printed consilia. If we define the genre broadly, that is true. But unlike later consilia, these seem to be mostly arguments that had been, or should be, used in court. Antonio da Budrio wrote an abstract of them that the printer Riessinger put in the Florentine edition of 1568, in a work edited by Bernardo Zanchini, a descendant of Câs. The number of the allegations went from 132 (of which some were canceled) to 140. Three years later, Quintiliano Mandosi is said to have purged the text of defects and certainly accompanied each of them with extensive commentary and updates (Ziletti ed., Venezia 1571). For example, in allegation 89 Mandosiâs additio reaches fifteen pages, almost three times as much as the text commented on.\n\nC. Galligani, in DGI, M. T. Napoli, in DBI (25 [1981]). C. Donahue and M. B. Chopas in MEMJ. The variations on Câs surname are great: Cassus, Ciafari, Criffi, Graffi, Zacci, Zaffi, Ziaffa, Ziaffi. He is also known as Andrea da Pisa (Andreas Pisanus). Library cataloguers have followed suit. The authority file of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek settles on Andreas Pisanus, but reports 19 variants. This variety reflects that fact that relatively little solid information about C. is available, and over the course of centuries since his death bibliographers, historians of universities, and historians of Italian towns have filled in gaps with guess-work. C. was probably born in Pisa. Napoli even gives the name of the neighborhood in which his familyâs house was located. In the 19th century, however, an historian of ForlÃ¬ (P. Bonoli) claimed him for that town and said that he was called âPisanusâ because the Pisans made him a citizen when he taught at the studium there. One 19th-century bibliographer (G. Moroni) follows Boloni, but only one. The only solid dates that we have for Câs life are that he taught at Pisa in 1320, at Perugia in 1321, and at Siena from the autumn of 1321 through the autumn of 1322. He was cited and praised by his contemporaries and those of the next generation, notably Bartolo and Baldo. From what they say we can construct a bit more about his life and make some guesses as to why he was important. That he studied with Dino del Mugello at Bologna seems clear. He then is said to have gone to France and to have studied with Pierre de Belleperche at OrlÃ©ans. If that is right, then we would have a solid terminus ante quem, because Pierre left the university in 1296. It is unlikely, however, that Câs studies at OrlÃ©ans were with Pierre himself as opposed to being with those who followed his method. If we can rely at all on the reports that C. studied at OrlÃ©ans, then it is plausible, as Calligani suggests, that C. was as responsible as Dino for spreading the methods of the school of OrlÃ©ans in Italy, because the latter knew the work of that school only through, apparently, manuscripts and a brief encounter with Pierre at Bologna. More at this state of our knowledge we cannot say about Câs life, and perhaps we should not say this much.\n\nWe also know little about his work. The treatise De gerundis is solidly attributed to him both in print (Tractatus 1549, TUI 1584 t. 18, the only known printings) and in manuscript (see Dolezalek, Manuscripta juridica, s.n. Andreas Ciaffi [Pisanus]). In it C. analyzes the different meanings and legal effects that the gerund may have in the various circumstances. A consilium of his is found in a printed edition of the consilia of Ludovico Pontano (ed. Venezia 1500, no. 447, fol. 153v). In it C. confirms the opinion of Cino da Pistoia on a question dependent on the interpretation of the l. Hac edictali, C. De secundis nuptiis (Cod. 5.9.6). Others of Câs consilia are found in manuscript (CittÃ del Vaticano, BAV, Vat. lat. 8069; id. Vat. lat. 10726). A treatise De quaestionibus is attributed to him in some manuscripts but not in others (see Dolezalek, Manuscripta juridica, s.n. Andreas Ciaffi [Pisanus]). If TUI 1584 t. 11.1, fol. 291vb is the treatise De quaestionibus in TUI 1584 to which Napoli is referring, it is there attributed to Iacopo da Arena. A rather large collection of additiones to the gloss on the Infortiatum by various authors, including C., survives in manuscript (MÃ¼nchen, BSB clm 28162; Olomouc, Dombibl. ZemskÃ½ A, C.O.591 [not necessarily the same text]). More could be done with what we know that survives, particularly in manuscript, and it is always possible that more will be discovered in manuscript. The testimony of contemporaries or near-contemporaries suggests that C. was important. In the present state of our knowledge we really do not know why.\n\nCERL Thesaurus. Not in DBE. We have not confirmed, but have no reason to doubt, the places and dates of Eâs birth and death and that he was a professor of both philosophy and canon law. Italian edit16. He is described as a canon and operarius of Segovia in 1586, when the pope made him bishop of Viesti (now Vieste, prov. Foggia, ITA), a position that he resigned in 1589, when the pope collated him to deanship of Valencia. In 1594, the pope made him bishop of Orihuela (prov. Alicante, ESP), a position that he held until his death. Eubel. The De adoratione pedum Romani pontificis (t. 13.2) was first published in 1578 by Francesco Ziletti in Venezia, where E. is simply described as âValentinusâ. The title page adds: âAdiecta praeterea eiusdem authoris disputatio de coronatione, & eleuatione Rom. pont.â These items would also seem to be included in TUI 1584, without giving them separate titles. The exensive quotations of Greek and Latin authors in the work and the full quotation of the Dictatus papae of Gregory VII suggest that E. was a man of considerable learning. The work was reprinted twice in Roma in 1588, in one of which reprints E. is described as the bishop of Viesti. In 1584, his Sacri Rosarii Virginis Mariae ab haereticorum calumniis defensio was published in Roma. It was reprinted in Venezia in 1587 as part of the three-volume collection of material designed for the use of the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary. The oration that he gave on Ash Wednesday before Pope Gregory XIII was published in Roma in 1585, where he is described as a doctor of theology. The oration that he gave on the occasion of the profession of obedience of Philip II to Sixtus V was published in Roma in 1586 and 1587, and in Milano in 1586; in all three he is simply described as âValentinusâ. His De potestate coactiua quam Romanus pontifex exercet in negotia saecularia was published twice in Roma in 1586, one printing of which describes him as bishop of Viesti, the other as a doctor of theology and canon law and the operarius of Segovia (a position that he seems to have retained when he was made bishop of Viesti [Eubel]). His De luctu minuendo collectana ad Ludouicum de Torres vtriusq. signaturae referendarium, published in Roma in 1587, describes him, once more, as a doctor of theology and canon law, and the operarius of Segovia. The last known work of his of which we are aware, In causam Henrici Borbonii, ad episcopos, & presbyt. ceterosque catholicos regni Francorum, was published in Valencia in 1590, and in Trento (and elsewhere) in 1592. In edition of Valencia 1590, he is described simply as bishop of Viesti; in the the Trento edition, he is described as bishop of Viesti and dean of Valencia. The history of these publications may be enough to suggest that E. was operating in Roma in the 1580s and that he returned to Spain when he resigned the see of Viesti and became dean of Valencia.\n\nNot in DGI. CERL Thesaurus. We hesitate describe this jurist at all. Little is known about him, and much that has been said about him seems to have little support. That he was already dead in 1539 when the first edition of Tractatus reservationum papalium ac legatorum (t. 15.1) was published through the efforts of Luis GÃ³mez, bishop of Sarno (1534-1543) and auditor of the Rota, seems clear. He is described as âquondam I.U.D. Do. Aenea de Falconibus de Magliano SabineÃ±â. Magliano Sabina (prov. Rieti) was then, and is now, a relatively small town, and not known as a legal center. When we couple that fact with the fact that we find the reference to it in a position where we normally find an indication of the authorâs place of origin, we would normally conclude that F. came from there, not that he operated there. The authority file of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, however, says that he was born in Lecce (prov. Lecce). Italian edit16 says the same. That statement goes a long way back but not, so far as we can tell, back far enough to be reliable. The first reference that we have found to F. being born in Lecce is in NicolÃ² Toppi, Biblioteca napoletana (Napoli 1678) 76 where he lists two authors of a Tractatus de reservationibus beneficiorum one an Enea deâ Falconi di Lecce for whom he cites a reference in Conrad Gessnerâs Biblioteca universale (ZÃ¼rich 1545) fol. 13, and an Enea delli Falconi di Magliano, for whom he cites the editions in Tractatus 1549 and TUI 1584. He says that the Magliano is the modern Magliano in Toscana (prov. Grosetto) and that GÃ³mez got it wrong when he said Magliano Sabina. It is unclear whether Toppi thought that there were two men named Enea Falconi. What is clear is that he got the reference to Gessner wrong. What Gessner refers to is a work by Aeneas Silvanus Piccolimini in which Aeneas Silvanus comments critically on a work of Antonius Panormitanus on Alfonso king of Aragon. There is a reference to Aeneas de Falconibus in the second edition of Gessner (ZÃ¼rich 1574, p. 12), but it simply cites the De reservationibus and says nothing about Lecce. L. Maggiulli, âStudenti e professori Salentini nellâuniversitÃ di Padovaâ, Rivista storica salentina 1 (1903) 348, repeats that F. was born in Lecce and adds that he studied at Padova and became a famous canonist. His only reference is to Gessner (this time p. 13 rather than fol. 13) and TUI 1584. He may have had independent evidence that F. studied at Padova. If so, he does not cite it. More work in more recent sources is called for, but for now we are inclined to think that GÃ³mez probably got it right. F. probably came from Magliano Sabina. He may have studied at Padova, but of this we certainly cannot be sure. That F. is not mentioned in A. Belloni, Professor giuristi a Padova nel secolo XV (Ius commune Sonderhefte 28; Frankfurt 1986) is not dispositive; she does not purport to list everyone who studied law at Padova in the 15th century. It is, however, cause to doubt that F. was there. In addition to the De reservationibus, F. wrote a number of additiones to Panormitanusâ works, which were frequently published with Panormitanusâ works, beginning in 1512. That probably means that F. was operating after Panormitanusâ death in 1445. F. was dead by 1539. We, so far, have not been able to tie him down tighter than that.\n\nNot in DHJF. CERL Thesaurus. F. seems to have been what in French could be called an âÃ©diteur scientificâ, and in English, somewhat more bluntly, a âpublishersâ hackâ. We have not found any of the editions on which he is said to have worked online, so we rely here on the fullest of the descriptions that we have been able to find in WorldCat, supported, as we discovered after we had written it, by a recently published article about him: R. Menini,ââR. F.â (et non âF. R.â): De FranÃ§ois Rabelais Ã Raymond Fraguierâ, BibliothÃ¨que dâHumanisme et Renaissance, 75 (2013) 515-522. So far as we can tell, he appears first in Denis de Harsyâs edition of the consilia of Ãtienne Bernard (2 vols., Lyon 1531, 1532). He is there described as âiurisstudiosusâ, presumably a law student, and what he did on the edition is described as âconcinnatorâ, a word that at least classically means âhair dresserâ. In 1533, Simon Vincent and Harsy published in Lyon Andrea da Iserniaâs lecturaon the Neapolitan constitutions, which they called Peregrina lectura, and in which they urged the reader: âen damus tibi lector optime peregrina Comentaria D. AndrÃ¦Ã¦ ab Isernia inter classicos LL. autores jure supremi: quÃ¦ qde sparsim & circuncise in Constitutiones Neapolitani regni maxima studiorum tuorum comoditate Ã¦didit : Sed hac tandem accipe Peregrina ab exotico habitu exutam, & novo dotata ornatu opera Remudi Fragrier. I.S. qui illam suis vigiliis ex proselyta domestica tuam fecitâ. (âProselyta here may mean âalienâ). In Harsyâs edition of the Decisiones Neapolitani of Matteo DâAfflitto (Lyon 1533, repr. 1537), his work is described more conventionally as â[cum] sumarijs, titulis, additionibus & indice illustratum opera praesertim Remundi Fraguier Iuristudiosiâ. To Vincentâs Aerarium constitutionum regni Siciliae he is said to have contributed an index, a table of Iserniaâs Peregrina lectura, and a catalogue of the constitutions. To the Tabella of the decisions of DâAfflitto published by the heirs of S. Vincent (Lyon 1535), he is said to have contributed a digest. He made some contribution (not specified in the catalogue, probably the index) to the edition that the heirs of S. Vincent published (Lyon 1535) of Alberto Trottiâs De vero et perfecto clero (see Albertus de Ferrariis) and another unspecified contribution to A. Vincentâs edition of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (Lyon 1538). He wrote a poem to accompany the edition of Aulus Gellius that the heirs of S. Vincent published in 1539. In Tractatus 1549 and TUI 1584 (t. 14), the only editions that we found of his Tractatus de religiosis sectis eorumque auctoribus, he is described as âlegum professorâ, but that may be publishersâ hyperbole. The work itself is not particularly legal, an attempt to list all the religious orders and types of committed religious life, from the beginnings of Christianity to his day. There can be little doubt that he was active between 1531 and 1539. Whether he was still alive and active in 1549 is a matter of more doubt, but it is certainly possible. That he was is suggested by the fact that he supplied a brief avis au lecteur to the edition in Tractatus 1549 of LâEsnauderieâs De privilegiis doctorum (t. 18).\n\nCERL Thesaurus. The editio princeps of all of Râs known printed works (Lyon, Antoine Du Ry, 1516 or 1517) spells the name âRaygnaudiâ on the title page (Regnaudus or Regnaudi in TUI 1584). That may be an indication that the French form of his name should be âRegnaudâ, but one would hesitate to change what Giordanengno (above) decided to do on the basis of manuscript sources. The last item, De origine iuris, in the editio princeps (fol. 160r) is dated: âAnno domini millesimo ccccxxjâ. The main work in that printing is entitled Comprehensorium feudale, a lectura on the Libri feudorum, fol. 1râ88v. It begins with a dedication: âFlorenti et famoso studio eiusque sacre universitati insignite civitatis aveinionâ Joannes Raynaudi legum doctor inter ceteros minimus et dicte civitatis originarius, nunc vero civis Massilie ac predicte universitatis filius, humilem recommendationem ac honoris et felicitatis augmentum.â From this we may derive that R. was a native of Avignon, that he received his doctorate, probably in utroque (it is so mentioned on the title page and on fol. 89r), that he moved to Marseille, where he became a citizen, and that he engaged in some teaching. There being no university in Marseille, it is possible that the teaching was at Aix, where the university had been founded in 1409. That speculation is given some support by the dedicatory epistle (sig. a7r), dated in 1515 and written by one Jacobus Teulirius, who describes himself as a student at the university of Aix and who seems to suggest that he came upon the work while he was studying the Libri feudorum. He repeats the information given in Râs dedication, and adds that R. was âMassillitano concive alteroque exspectabilibus dum in humanis ageret in suprema parlamenti provincie curia condominisâ. The parlement of Aix was not created until 1501, and Jacobus must have known that. He is apparently referring, as Giodanengo suggests, to a short-lived parlement of Aix that Louis XII attempted to create at Aix in 1415. In addition to the Comprehensorium feudale and the De origine iuris at the end, the editio princeps also contains Râs De nobilitate and his Tractatus suitatis et extraneitatis, both of which may be thought of as being included within the Comprehensorium feudale. These are followed by his Tractatus mensurarum (t. 12), and a Tractatus monetarum (t. 12). The latter does not seem to be attributed to R. The incipit (fol. 109v) is simply: âSequitur materia seu tractus monete seu pecuniarum: an debeat inspici valor tempore contractus vel loci etc.â The running head is âDo. Jordanus busi.â The explicit (fol. ?111va; some of the pages are photographed out of order) is âTractatus seu questionis determinatio do. Jor. buci. utriusque iuris eximii doctoris ac armate militie strenuus miles ortus super solutione cuiusdam dotis feliciter finit.â There follows a quaestio (or consilium) that is not listed on the title page: âTestator quidam suum condidit testamentum et iuravit illud non revocare demum non obstante primo testamento iurato de ipso non revocando aliud fecit testamentum. Queritur nunc quod istorum duorum testamentorum valeat an primum iuratum an secundum.â The running head is âDo. Jo. Raynaudiâ. The explicit of this item (fol. 114rb) is: âFinit hoc preclarissimum opus domini Johan. Raynaldi utriusque iuris laureati super validitate testamentorumâ. Certainty is not possible on the basis of this evidence, but it looks as if the De moneta is not the work of R. but of a jurist named âJordanus Buc(s)iâ (?Bucci), whom Giodanengo identifies as Jourdain BrÃ¨s (G. Giordanengo, in DHJF 173), a contemporary of Râs in the short-lived parlement of Aix. The De testamentis is followed by the De securitate of Guillaume de Cun (t. 12), a repetitio by Baldo degli Ubaldi, a lectura by Jean de Garons on the title De secundis nuptiis (Cod. 5.9) said to have been given at the university of Avignon on 16 Nov. 1407 (t. 9), before closing with Râs De origine iuris. Jean Thierry of Langres supplied the numbers, notes, and an alphabetical index for the publisher. In turn, the publisher allowed him to include a brief dedicatory epistle and two of his consilia in the front matter before the first folio. There is thus nothing on the foliated pages that needs be dated after the first quarter of the 15th century. (We have not checked all the citations, but a spot check did not disclose any that have to postdate 1425.) It is thus possible that what is printed here is a transcription of a manuscript from that period. An examination of the manuscripts that Giodanengo cites is clearly called for. For example, Dolezalekâs Maunscripta juridica reports that Lisboa, Biblioteca de Ajuda, MS. H.9.8 (?before 1418), contains an item attributed to a Johannes Raynardus entitled âComprehensorium feudale super constitutione imperialiâ. Wien, ÃNB, Ms. Cvpl. 5063 (sec. 15), contains an item described as âRepetitio const. âImperialem decet sollertiamâ Friderici I imperatorisâ and attributed to one Johannes Rainaldus sive Raimundus, which has the same incipit as the Comprehensorium feudale in the editio princeps."
