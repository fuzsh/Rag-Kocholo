Macdonald’s name from Ontario’s public schools has laid bare a rift in the province, as the appeal is met with open arms in some circles but open hostility in others.\n\nAt its annual meeting last week, the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario passed a motion calling on all school districts in Ontario to rename schools and buildings named after Macdonald, who, as the “architect of genocide against Indigenous Peoples,” was prime minister when the federal government approved Canada’s first residential schools.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

It’s an emotional issue. But what’s important is that we’re having an open and frank discussion about pieces of our history that we’ve talked about, as we have with residential schools, as an example.”\n\nOntario Premier Kathleen Wynne weighed in on the matter Thursday, suggesting that the teachers’ union “missed the mark.”\n\n“Sir John A. MacDonald was a father of confederation, our first prime minister, and he contributed greatly to the creation of a stable federal government for Canada,” she said in a statement.\n\n“He is an important part of our history and, while decisions about naming schools belong to school boards, I don’t believe his name should be removed from schools in Ontario.\n\n“The more important question we should be asking ourselves as we move forward is ‘How do we enact meaningful reconciliation with our indigenous peoples?’”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOttawa Indigenous community activist Lynda Kitchikeesic suggested that one step toward that “meaningful reconciliation” would be to remove Macdonald’s name from schools and other edifices.\n\n“When you see Macdonald’s name, he’s the author of the residential schools,” she said, “at least in my mind. They did this to us, and people are still suffering the effects, and they will be for more generations. Why would you name something, especially a place of education, that is so offensive and was so harmful to all of us First Nations people?\n\n“There are no First Nations people who are not affected,” she added. “Not today, not yesterday and they’ll still be affected tomorrow.\n\n“I just find it a slap in the face. Five years ago, they renamed the Western Parkway. Why? Why would you pick the author of the residential schools, the person who harmed us to a point where we can barely recover? They finally apologized, so now let’s get rid of the memorabilia that makes this person heroic. He was not a hero to us.”\n\nThe ongoing tinkering with Canada’s history and how we portray it is an issue requiring careful thought and discussion, says Michel Prévost, president of la Société d’histoire de l’Outaouais and University of Ottawa archivist.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Where will it stop?” he asks “If we start to do that, where will it stop? And this is a good example.”\n\nIn the Ottawa region, he notes, no less than an airport, bridge, highway, street, parkway and federal building are named for Macdonald.\n\n“Will we change all these names?\n\n“John A. Macdonald, like all politicians, did good and wrong things, but he is the first prime minister of Canada and is really related to the history of Canada. I don’t think we have to throw out his name everywhere.”\n\nAnd if Macdonald goes, he asked, who’s to follow?\n\n“We’ll only be left with Pearson.”\n\nPrevost noted that some have lobbied for the removal of Mackenzie King’s statue from Parliament Hill for Canada’s decision in June 1939 to deny entry to more than 900 Jewish refugees who had fled Germany. Already barred from docking in Cuba and the United States, their ship, the MS St. Louis, returned to Europe, where more than 250 of them subsequently died in the Holocaust.\n\nAnd it was announced recently that Father of Confederation Hector-Louis Langevin would have his name stripped from the Wellington Avenue building that both bears his name and houses the prime minister’s office. One of the original framers of the residential school system, Langevin said in the House of Commons in 1883: “The fact is, that if you wish to educate those children you must separate them from their parents during the time they are being educated. If you leave them in the family they may know how to read and write, but they still remain savages, whereas by separating them in the way proposed, they acquire the habits and tastes — it is to be hoped only the good tastes — of civilized people.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPrévost points to numerous examples in the Ottawa region where historical figures’ places on buildings and street signs have been challenged and, in some cases, removed.\n\nIn 1967, two days after French president Charles de Gaulle uttered his infamous “Vive le Quebec libre!” line to a Montreal crowd, residents of Old Ottawa East’s De Gaulle Boulevard requested that their street name be changed. It was renamed Centennial Boulevard.\n\nCharlotte Whitton, the first woman elected mayor of a Canadian city, was a ground-breaking feminist. But her history of anti-semitism and her efforts to stop Jewish immigrants from coming to Canada tarnished that reputation. Plans in 2011 to name the building housing Ottawa’s archives after her were shelved because of the controversy.\n\nIn 2015, two Gatineau streets named for Nobel Prize winners Philipp Lenard and Alexis Carrel were renamed after people complained of the pair’s Nazi sympathies. “They’re now named for Albert Einstein and Marie Curie,” says Prévost. “But you have to take the time to consult historians and archivists to make sure you make a good decision.” The resolution to rename Rue Philipp Lenard and Rue Alexis-Carrel took about a year, he says, and involved consultations with residents, the mayor and historians.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“In this case, I’m sure no one in Gatineau or Ottawa wants to be associated with names related to Hitler or the Nazis.\n\nBut by the same token, he adds, efforts to rename Rue Amherst, named for Jeffrey Amherst, the 18th century British Governor General of the territories that eventually became Canada, failed. It was Amherst’s idea to give blankets infected with smallpox to Indigenous people. “We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them,” Amherst wrote at the time.\n\n“Right now,” says Prévost, “we’re trying to rewrite history with our eyes, from today. But when we look 100 years ago, society has changed so much. Generally I feel we should keep these names; it’s an opportunity to speak about what they did – something good, something wrong. But if you throw away these names, we will forget them and never speak about them.”\n\nWith files from Blair Crawford.\n\nbdeachman@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
