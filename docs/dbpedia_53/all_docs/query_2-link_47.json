        "text": "Provost History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nThe surname Provost is a ancient French name. It was a name given to a person from Brittany who was a prefect or chief magistrate. 1 Looking back even further, we found the name was originally derived from the Old French word, \"prevost\", which signified someone of that title. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Provost family\n\nThe surname Provost was first found in Brittany (French: Bretagne) where this noble family originated in ancient times.\n\nLords of Bonneseaux are cited in 1427 and maintained nobility of ancient extraction in 1669. The name was also found in Montreuil in the 18th century with a group of Lords from Bourgogne and a Commissioner General in the Navy. 1\n\nFrançois Prevost, born in 1638, son of Charles and Jeanne, was the Major of the Château Saint-Louis and Governor of Trois-Rivières. He married Geneviève Macard, daughter of Nicolas and Marguerite, in the province of Quebec on 1st August 1679. They remained together in Quebec until François passed away on 5th June 1702. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Provost family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Provost research. Another 122 words (9 lines of text) covering the years 1547, 1580, 1600, 1622, 1638, 1665, 1670, 1680, 1697, 1699, 1700, 1702, 1724, 1729, 1732, 1741, 1753, 1763, 1785, 1822, 1824, 1825, 1830, 1831, 1839, 1843, 1848, 1850 and 1865 are included under the topic Early Provost History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nProvost Spelling Variations\n\nThe many different spellings of French surnames can be partially explained by the use of local dialects and by the influence of other languages during the early development of the French language. As a result of these linguistic and cultural influences, the name Provost is distinguished by a number of regional variations. The many spelling variations of the name include Prévost, Prévoste, Prévosts, Prévostes, Prévaust, Prévauste, Prévaustes, Prévausts, de Prévost, du Prévost and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Provost family\n\nNotable amongst this name at this time was\n\nFrançois Provost (1638-1702), French-born, career soldier who served in the Carignan-Salières regiment stationed to New France in 1665, Governor of Trois-Rivières and temporary Governor of Montreal\n\nProvost World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Provost is the 3,927th most popular surname with an estimated 7,461 people with that name. 4 However, in Canada, the name Provost is ranked the 595th most popular surname with an estimated 8,481 people with that name. 5 And in Quebec, Canada, the name Provost is the 236th popular surname. 6 France ranks Provost as 722nd with 6,759 people. 7\n\nLoading...\n\nProvost migration to the United States +\n\nFrance finally gave land incentives for 2,000 migrants during the 1700s. Early marriage was encouraged in New France, and youths of 18 took fourteen-year-old girls for their wives. The fur trade was developed and attracted migrants, both noble and commoner from France. 15,000 explorers left Montreal in the late 17th and 18th centuries, leaving French names scattered across the continent. The search for the Northwest passage continued. Migration from France to New France or Quebec, as it was now more popularly called, continued until 1759. By 1675, there were 7000 French in Quebec. By the same year the Acadian presence in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had reached 500. In the treaty of Utrecht, the Acadians were ceded by France to Britain in 1713. In 1755, 10,000 French Acadians refused to take an oath of allegiance to England and were deported. They found refuge in Louisiana. Meanwhile, in Quebec, the French race flourished, founding in Lower Canada, one of the two great solitudes which became Canada.
