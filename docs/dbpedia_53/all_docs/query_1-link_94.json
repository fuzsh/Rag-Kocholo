        "meta_description": "Rather than repudiate Mao’s legacy, the post-revolutionary regime in China has sought to recruit him in support of “reform and opening.” Beginning with Deng Xiaoping after 1978, official historiography has drawn a distinction between Mao the Cultural Revolutionary and Mao the architect of “Chinese Marxism” – a Marxism that integrates theory with the circumstances of Chinese society. The essence of the latter is encapsulated in “Mao Zedong Thought,” which is viewed as an expression not just of Mao the individual but of the collective leadership of the Party. In most recent representations, “Chinese Marxism” is viewed as having developed in two phases: New Democracy, which brought the Communist Party to power in 1949, and “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” inaugurated under Deng Xiaoping and developed under his successors, and which represents a further development of Mao Zedong Thought. The Hu Jintao leadership has made an aggressive effort to portray “Chinese Marxism” as the most advanced development of Marxism that might also serve as a model for others. These interpretive operations have salvaged Mao for the national revolution and the legitimacy of the Communist Party. But it also presents a predicament in keeping alive memories of Mao’s policies, which the Party is not always able to control in political memory, as has been illustrated most recently in the Chongqing experiment.",

        "text": "I am grateful to Yige Dong, Sebastian Veg, Wang Guo, and Wu Yiching for reading and commenting on this essay. I am especially grateful to Sebastian Veg for helping me acquire the sources without which this essay would not have been possible. I am also grateful to an anonymous reader for China Perspectives for a careful reading and astute suggestions. These colleagues and friends helped enrich the argument but bear no responsibility for its shortcomings.\n\n1Mao Zedong is once again back in the news. He was resurrected by Chongqing (重庆) Party Secretary Bo Xilai (薄熙来) around four years ago to lend cultural/ideological weight to the experiment Bo planned with a socialism that would combine Mao-style populist egalitarianism with tighter party-state control over the economy; this time within the context of global capitalism, of which the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is an integral component, if not a motor force. The search for answers to apparent disagreements over Bo’s recent dismissal by those suspicious of his challenge to the existing state-capitalism controlled by the Communist Party seems only to have intensified speculation over the strength of Maoism in the Party.\n\nReform and the re-invention of Mao Zedong Thought\n\n4Contrary to the impression left by the radical transformations since 1978, the Chinese Communist Party has never officially repudiated Mao. Despite the demotion he has suffered over the past three decades in and out of the People’s Republic of China, Mao Zedong continues to occupy a central place in official and officially sponsored histories of the Chinese Revolution, its past and present. Whatever personal feelings they may harbour, Chinese leaders officially propagate the line that the Communist Party continues the work that Mao started: to build a strong socialist state informed by a Marxism that has been adjusted to national circumstances in keeping with the demands of the times. As might be expected, they view this work as having gotten under way sometime in the 1930s, then having gone astray for more than two decades from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s with the left-extremism of the Cultural Revolution before being revitalised by his successors.\n\n5This official line has shown remarkable consistency since the post-Mao regime reversed the policies of the Cultural Revolution, although it has undergone elaboration and consolidation. Attitudes toward Mao have likewise undergone shifts among the public, along with what officialdom has deemed appropriate in celebrating Mao. But the basic line, and the justification given for it, has remained much the same.\n\n7Deng himself would lead the effort to reconstruct Party history to appropriate Mao for the reforms. Representations of Mao in the PRC and abroad that are dominated by memories of the Cultural Revolution overlook that there is more than one Maoist legacy available to the Party in the legitimation of the revolutionary past: not only that of Mao the Cultural Revolutionary but also of Mao the leader of the national revolution who gave voice to the theoretical formulations of Marxism in defence of the pursuit of national aims: a “Chinese Marxism” growing out of the historical experience of the Chinese Revolution. The current leadership projects its own undertaking – and the 30 years of “reform and opening” under the successive leaderships of Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin (江泽民) (but not HuYaobang 胡耀邦 and Zhao Ziyang 赵紫阳) – as further developing the policies of New Democracy that brought the Communist Party to power in 1949 under Mao’s leadership. In this historical reconstruction, “socialism with Chinese characteristics” (中国特色社会主义) as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and enriched by his successors represents a second stage in the unfolding of “Chinese Marxism,” of which New Democracy (新民主主义) under Mao was the inaugural phase. The Cultural Revolution, sandwiched in between, serves in the new history of “Chinese Marxism” as a period when the ideology went astray (and a “negative example” from which to learn what not to do), but it leaves Mao’s “true” legacy intact for his successors to follow up on once this temporary deviation had been overcome.\n\n10The 1981 Resolution held Mao directly responsible for the leftist errors of the Cultural Revolution, but concluded nevertheless:\n\n11 “Resolution,” p. 34.\n\nComrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the “cultural revolution,” but if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary. He rendered indelible meritorious service in founding and building up our Party and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, in winning victory for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people, in founding the People’s Republic of China, and in advancing our socialist cause. He made major contributions to the liberation of the oppressed nations of the world and to the progress of mankind.\n\n15 “Resolution,” pp. 34‑35.\n\nThe Chinese Communists, with Comrade Mao Zedong as their chief representative, made a theoretical synthesis of China’s unique experience in its protracted revolution in accordance with the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. This synthesis constituted a scientific system of guidelines befitting China’s conditions, and it is this synthesis which is Mao Zedong Thought, the product of the integration of the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Making revolution in a large Eastern semi-colonial, semi-feudal country….cannot be solved by reciting the general principles of Marxism-Leninism or by copying foreign experience in every detail. The erroneous tendency of making Marxism a dogma and deifying Comintern resolutions and the experience of the Soviet Union prevailed in the international communist movement and in our Party mainly in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and this tendency pushed the Chinese revolution to the brink of total failure. It was in the course of combating this wrong tendency and making a profound summary of our historical experience in this respect that Mao Zedong Thought took shape and developed. It was systematized and extended in a variety of fields and reached maturity in the latter part of the Agrarian Revolutionary War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it was further developed during the War of Liberation and after the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism applied and developed in China; it constitutes a correct theory, a body of correct principles and a summary of the experiences that have been confirmed in the practice of the Chinese revolution, a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n20 “Resolution,” op. cit., p. 45.\n\nMao Zedong Thought is the valuable spiritual asset of our Party. It will be our guide to action for a long time to come….While many of Comrade Mao Zedong’s important works were written during the periods of new-democratic revolution and of socialist transformation, we must still constantly study them. This is not only because one cannot cut the past off from the present and failure to understand the past will hamper our understanding of present-day problems, but also because many of the basic theories, principles and scientific approaches set forth in these works are of universal significance and provide us with invaluable guidance now and will continue to do so in the future…. Mao Zedong Thought has added much that is new to the treasure-house of Marxist-Leninist theory. We must combine our study of the scientific works of Comrade Mao Zedong with that of the scientific writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.\n\n17The re-evaluation of Mao Zedong Thought in 1980‑1981 set the stage for the part Mao was to play in official historiography since then. It is worth stressing here two dimensions of this re-evaluation. On the one hand, Mao Zedong Thought was associated intimately with the policies of New Democracy that had prevailed for two decades between the mid-thirties and the mid-fifties, and therefore belonged to the past of the Party. On the other hand, as the foundation for a Chinese Marxism that would continue to develop for the foreseeable future, Mao Zedong Thought transcended its times, and lived on in Party ideology as a guide to the future of socialism. In his ninetieth anniversary speech in 2011, Hu Jintao reiterated this double temporality of Mao Zedong Thought when he stated:\n\n26 Hu Jintao, “Speech at Anniversary Gathering,” op. cit., p. 4.\n\nThe Party has consistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the specific conditions of China, and it has made two great theoretical achievements in the historical process of adapting Marxism to China’s conditions. One is Mao Zedong Thought, which represents the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China. Mao Zedong Thought has resolved in a systematic way the issue of how to accomplish the new-democratic revolution and socialist revolution in China, a big semi-colonial and semi-feudal country in the East, and made painstaking effort to explore the issue of what kind of socialism China should build and how to build it, thereby making new and creative contributions to enriching Marxism. The other theoretical achievement is the system of theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is a scientific theoretical system consisting of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development and other major strategic thoughts…. The system of theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics represents the continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought.\n\nMao in official historiography\n\n19Over the last three decades, official histories of the revolution have followed closely the line established in the 1981 Resolution. The editors of a three-volume Party history written for the required course on Marxism-Leninism at the Party School, published in 1990 (preface dated 1987), wrote:\n\n28 Li Jianwei (李践为, chief editor), Zhongguo gongchandang lishi (History of the Chinese Communist Party (...)\n\nThis book follows the correct line established at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and has been written according to the spirit of “The Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party since the Founding of the People’s Republic of China” at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. It applies the viewpoints of dialectical and historical materialism, is based on historical facts, and seeks truth from facts.\n\n20Ideological requirements in the composition of Party history would become more complicated in ensuing years with the addition to Deng Xiaoping’s “theory” of Jiang Zemin’s “important thought of ‘Three Represents’” (“三个代表”重要思想) and Hu Jintao’s “scientific outlook on development” (科学发展观), but the basic line has remained unchanged. The first volume of the most recent official Party history published in 2002 reiterated its faithfulness to the same principles, but added to it Jiang Zemin’s take on the revolution. The second volume published in 2011 additionally bears the stamp of Hu Jintao. But since every leader has reaffirmed the 1981 Resolution as a fundamental document of reform, the Resolution has been basic to their evaluations of the past as well. Zhang Qihua pointed to the 1981 Resolution as the primary guide to the writing of the second volume of the Party history published in 1911. In the words of the editors, the guiding principles in writing the volume were:\n\n29 Zhang Qihua, “Interview,” Zhongguo gongchandang lishi, vol. 2, op. cit., p. 1070.\n\nMarxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of “Three Represents,” deep and comprehensive pursuit of the scientific outlook on development, grasping important historical questions on the basis of the “Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People’s Republic of China,” decisions of important meetings of the Party, and important directives of leading comrades of the Party Centre.\n\n25The gap is now being filled through historical work more open to confronting sensitive issues in the Party’s past. What is genuinely new in these recent texts is not so much the overall interpretation, which largely follows the decisions of the 1981 Resolution, but the discussion in some detail of the period from the mid-1950s to 1978, and Mao’s leading role in the developments surrounding the Cultural Revolution. Mao, the individual, does not fare well in this account, although criticism of his “left-deviation” after 1952 is much more measured than that to be found in some of the more incriminating works published outside of China. Beginning with the “transition to socialism” after 1952, Mao began to ignore the circumstances of Chinese society that were nowhere close enough to fulfilling the conditions for socialism, but also wrongly shifted emphasis in his reading of Marxism from the primacy of the forces of production to continued class struggle. His anxieties about capitalist restoration led to the persecution of so-called “revisionists,” inflicting immense harm on the Party. In the verdict of the new Party history:\n\n39 Zhongguo gongchandang lishi, vol. 2, op. cit., p. 979.\n\nAs the important leader of the Party and the state, Mao Zedong cannot but bear the major responsibility for the serious and comprehensive errors of “the cultural revolution.” The power of the Party was excessively concentrated in one person, Mao Zedong’s erroneous “leftist” leadership replaced the collective leadership of the Party, and the worship of the individual reached an insane level, undermining the possibility of the Party and the state to prevent and control the initiation and development of “the cultural revolution.”\n\n26The authors continue to observe, nevertheless, that the perpetuation of the Cultural Revolution for ten years provides prima facie evidence that it should not be blamed solely on one individual. Not only did many in the Party support Mao’s line, but so did the people at large, who were still under the sway of the feudal practices of the past.\n\n27This is indeed the general approach to the evaluation of Mao Zedong in recent histories: he was responsible for what happened, but the responsibility must be shared by others, including other leaders in the Party. This was the case also with the communisation and Great Leap Forward movements of 1958‑1960, which are officially acknowledged for the first time to have cost more than ten million lives. As the Party history puts it:\n\n40 Zhongguo gongchandang lishi (2011), op. cit., p. 502.\n\nIn launching “the great leap forward,” Mao Zedong’s hope initially was to change as quickly as possible the visage of poverty and backwardness, and to truly advance and strengthen China to establish its place among the world’s nations. This was at one with the hopes prevalent among large numbers of cadres and the people. The problem was that it went against the line of seeking truth from facts that the Party promoted…exaggerated the uses of subjective will and effort, advocated leap-frogging over historical stages in purpose and policy, and created in practical work a situation that went against natural and economic laws. This kind of hot-headedness was not restricted to Mao Zedong; it was a prevalent attitude among central leaders and many cadres…\n\n29Admitting the Party’s spiritual and political complicity in Mao Zedong’s policies is, from everything we know, true to the spirit and the politics of the times, but that does not make it easily acceptable to those who suffered from his policies personally, or to those who for one reason or another would discredit Mao. The latter probably were the ones Deng Xiaoping in 1980 repeatedly enjoined not to exaggerate Chairman Mao’s shortcomings, and those whose disagreements may account for the nearly two decades it took to bring the recent Party History to its final form. The admission makes the Party and many Party leaders complicit in the leftist zeal that culminated in these deplorable events.\n\n30And yet, this is very much in line with the Party’s intentions in choosing from a variety of representation of the past: not to condemn Mao and jeopardise the legitimacy the Party draws from the revolutionary past, but rather to provide “lessons” with which to guide the Party into the future. The account of Party history is replete with struggles against the “right” and the “left,” more with the latter than with the former. The lessons of New Democracy are drawn out to stress the present day importance of the united front line, a mixed economy, respect for the past, etc. The Great Leap Forward provides the occasion for stressing the priority of the forces over the relations of production – in other words, class. The Cultural Revolution in its disorderliness provides proof of the centrality of unified Party leadership to national progress and welfare. It even had a bright side in preparing the Party for “socialism with Chinese characteristics” after 1978. The conclusions drawn in the texts after every major episode of Party history are not just summaries but also guides to the reading of the text and the correct “lesson” to be drawn from it.\n\nA spectral presence: Mao and the Party\n\n33There is also the Mao who was responsible for the Cultural Revolution, who is apparently still controversial. In the official line since 1978, Mao has been held responsible for the Cultural Revolution, although it took 30 years for this responsibility to be spelled out in any detail. A decision was made under Deng Xiaoping not to repudiate Mao as Joseph Stalin had been repudiated in the Soviet Union in 1956, perhaps because Mao was more like a combination of V.I. Lenin and Stalin in stature, and could not be repudiated without irreparably damaging the revolution and the Party. The official line remains ambivalent in stressing the “good” sides of Mao even during the Cultural Revolution. Mao made serious leftist errors, but they were exacerbated by the behind-the-scenes machinations of the Jiang Qing and Lin Biao cliques. Mao was not above recognising and trying to rectify his errors. He played some part in the progress during those years in the economy, technology, and foreign relations, in addition to producing theoretical documents of lasting value. The Party has been quick to suppress any expression of excessive zeal for Mao and his policies, but it also has been cautious in condemning Mao, even as it has reversed his radical policies. Even more so than in the popular celebrations of Mao referred to above, this ambivalence has been apparent in renewed experiments with “redness,” among which the so-called Chongqing Model by the “princeling” Bo Xilai is the most prominent (see fn. 45).\n\n34Rather than repudiate Mao, the current interpretation seeks to appropriate his image for its own “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” This is apparent in two important ways. One is the historical linkage between New Democracy and “socialism with Chinese characteristics” that was foregrounded with the bracketing of the Cultural Revolution as an episode in socialist development. The other is the institutionalisation of Mao Zedong Thought. In official ideology Mao Zedong Thought occupies a crucial role as the fountainhead of “Chinese Marxism.”\n\n38Similarly, in discussions of Chinese Marxism Party leaders continue to reference Mao for their theoretical and policy innovations. A vague but potentially quite significant development in recent discussions of Chinese Marxism is their self‑referentiality. Recently published studies of Chinese Marxism read mostly as histories of policy innovations by successive generations of Communist leaders that are now endowed with theoretical status in the formulation of a Chinese Marxism. There is little visible concern in these texts for theoretical discussions that critically engage issues of Marxist theory with reference to Deng Xiaoping’s theory, “the important thought of ‘Three Represents,’” or “the scientific outlook on development.” Rather, each references predecessors in its ancestral lineage, “building” on them to further develop Chinese Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought. Mao’s theoretical corpus from New Democracy days, and even some produced after his left deviation, are part of the theoretical corpus of the Party. Theory itself endlessly changes in response to the times and national needs. In the words of Hu Jintao in his ninetieth anniversary speech to the Party:\n\nConclusion\n\n46Mao has both an ancestral and a phantom existence in texts on Party history and Chinese Marxism. Like Marx, Engels, and Lenin before him, he is an ancestor to the present, and a source of valuable lessons and principles to draw upon as necessary or appropriate. As the founding ancestor of Chinese Marxism, he commands an even greater immediacy than Marx and Engels as an example in rendering theory meaningful for practice. On the other hand, it is obviously no easy task to de-personalise Mao Zedong Thought, or to safely retire Mao’s policies to a receding past while upholding the “thought” named after him as an exemplary principle of theorising the Party’s changing practice. Continued uncertainty over the future – whether in calls for a return to New Democracy or renewed experiments with “redness,” among others – seems inevitably to play out on a discursive terrain in which Mao is ever present in one form or another. In its very appropriation by the Party, Mao Zedong Thought guarantees to Mao and Maoism a phantom existence that is imminent in Chinese socialism, both in its achievements and its anxieties."
