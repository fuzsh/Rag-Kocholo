        "text": "LONDON — Pilchards, anyone? Yes, that quintessentially English comestible apparently best eaten on toast — I’ve never tried it — is making a comeback on the British stage, and we have the dramatist Alan Ayckbourn to thank. Mr. Ayckbourn deserves our gratitude for countless other reasons, as well, not least for having quite astonishingly penned more plays than he is years old (70) and for lifting the curtain on a highly specific middle-class Englishness in which civility hangs by an increasingly frayed thread; the delights of eating pilchards in bed may, in fact, be among the very few buffers remaining to the chaos that exists only the ringing of a doorbell away.\n\nI was reminded of this phenomenon the other afternoon during a visit to Peter Hall’s truly delicious revival of “Bedroom Farce,” at the Rose Theatre, Kingston, the venue a half hour or so west of London at which Mr. Hall, who will be 80 next year, has the title of director emeritus. (Mr. Ayckbourn’s seldomly revived play is running through Nov. 28 in repertory with the director Stephen Unwin’s new production of Strindberg’s “Miss Julie,” which features three members of the “Bedroom Farce” cast.)\n\nThirty years ago, the veteran English actors Michael Gough and Joan Hickson won Tony Awards for the Broadway premiere of this same play, the memory of the pair duly delighting in their late-night consumption of oily fish very much with me still. On this occasion, those assignments have passed, splendidly, to Jane Asher and Nicholas Le Prevost, playing the senior and most posh of the four couples anatomized by Mr. Ayckbourn’s alternately affectionate and scathing eye. And what I had forgotten are how richly written are two roles that in an instant convey a shared domesticity that has seen the couple through numerous ups and downs, culinary or otherwise. The younger relationships in the play may be as precarious as a crucial bit of furniture — a key prop — that exists to fall apart, but the long-married Delia and Ernest, one senses, will endure for as long as men of a certain class and breeding can speak volumes, as does Mr. Le Prevost’s Ernest, with a decisive harrumph.\n\nThe importance of poor carpentry to the narrative notwithstanding, Mr. Ayckbourn’s play looks highly durable, and not only because the recent London and Broadway revival of “The Norman Conquests” helped remind us how singular this author’s mixture of pleasure and pain remains still. Simon Higlett’s set shows three bedrooms in varying states of distress that play host through the night to various upheavals, the majority of them pertaining to what Ms. Asher’s pitch-perfect Delia refers to sotto voce as “s-e-x.”\n\nErnest and Delia are seen preparing for an anniversary dinner for which they will turn out to be overdressed and, when they return, will be revealed to have undertipped. Still, at least they can get about. That’s more than can be said for the bedbound Nick (Tony Gardner), who spends the play at the other end of the stage writhing in agony with a bad back while his wife, Jan (Lucy Briers), goes to a housewarming party hosted by newlyweds Malcolm (Daniel Betts) and Kate (Finty Williams). That same gathering numbers among its guests Jan’s former partner, Trevor (Orlando Seale), who also happens to be Ernest and Delia’s son and who is conspicuously on the outs with his ravishingly unself-confident wife, Susannah (Rachel Pickup). To whom does the febrile Susannah run for support? The understatedly wise Delia, of course, in one of the surprise nocturnal appearances that drive the play.\n\nAs one might expect from a self-described farce, the play is put together with a care that, apparently, isn’t available to most flat-pack furniture, and it scores numerous, often stinging points gently and with Mr. Ayckbourn’s abundant gusts of humor. Among a seamless cast, the irrepressible Mr. Seale impresses as a sort of kindred spirit to “The Norman Conquests” Norman, a charismatic sexual gadfly who means well even as he can’t help doing ill. Mr. Gardner’s incapacitated Nick gets vast comic mileage out of an increasingly wry, cynical laugh in the face of a spouse, Ms. Briers’s expertly deadpan Jan, whose sympathies were long ago spent.\n\nIn a cast full of the children of established British actors (Ms. Briers’s father is Richard Briers, a popular stage and TV name), devotees of matters dynastic may be especially interested in the appearance of Ms. Williams, whose mother, Judi Dench, will appear under Mr. Hall’s direction at the Rose Theatre in February in a new production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The young actress in her own right comes close to stealing “Bedroom Farce” as a chirrupy, excitable new wife who wants nothing less than to be normal amid a landscape whose putative suburban normalcy hides all manner of peccadilloes. “Bedroom Farce” has been mooted for a commercial transfer in the spring to London’s West End; do we really have to wait that long?\n\nAs it turns out, critics didn’t have to wait long before being invited back to “Prick Up Your Ears,” at the Comedy Theatre through Nov. 29, due to the replacement within a week of opening night of the leading man, Matt Lucas, by the onetime Tony nominee Con O’Neill (“Blood Brothers”). Mr. Lucas left the production following the suicide of his former partner, Kevin McGee, in a real-life event eerily close to the terrain of Simon Bent’s play, which chronicles the fraught relationship between the playwright Joe Orton and his lover, and killer, Kenneth Halliwell, who in 1967 then went on to take his own life.\n\nMr. Lucas was brave to tackle in Halliwell a part that must have seemed unimaginably raw when life, as is sometimes the way, takes art on apace. Now, that role has been handed to Mr. O’Neill, who, unlike Mr. Lucas, is a proven stage actor of considerable experience and also not a comic. The result means that some of the early campery seems a bit of a stretch when we find Halliwell swanning around the pair's increasingly claustrophobic Islington flat while Orton is out and about having casual and frequent sex. Oh, and furthering his career, both activities undertaken without regard to Halliwell, who was himself a writer as he, on this evidence, never stopped reminding the deeply ambitious Orton.\n\nBut Mr. O’Neill’s chops come in handy during the play’s devastating second act during which the actor’s voice on occasion swoops as high as the music he so loves, the lyrics from Rodgers and Hart’s “Pal Joey” cunningly deployed in counterpoint to the ruinous liaison on view before us. A totally different physical being (and more frequently clothed) than was the butterball Mr. Lucas in this same role, Mr. O’Neill spares nothing as Halliwell plunges headlong into psychosis, signaled in Daniel Kramer’s staging by a gathering cacophony that finds Halliwell ever more isolated, physically and mentally. (The invaluable sound designer is Gareth Owen.)\n\nThe production as a whole has sharpened, as well, whether or not it is seen in relation to the ever-dreary straight play versions of films (“The Shawshank Redemption,” “Breakfast At Tiffany’s,” one worse than the next) that are cluttering the West End at present. Playing a landlady on hand mostly to offer comic relief alongside the rather obvious aperçu (“failure, it’s a bitter pill to swallow”), Gwen Taylor is an evident audience-pleaser, and Chris New’s Orton — at once swaggering and cocksure, ruthless yet possessed of residues of affection — has moved on immeasurably from where it was before: a good performance has become a major one.\n\nBedroom Farce.
