My review of this subreddit and Google made me settle on either Gregg (haven't chosen between pre-anniversary, anniversary, etc.) or Orthic.\n\nI like Gregg because it seems easier to write (ample movements which looks more fluid in the speed of writing), and Orthic because of the concise results.\n\nI'd like my notes to be legible by me only, even much later after they were written. What hints could you give me to help me choose between one of those?"
