        "text": "It’s hard to believe that so much time has passed since I last blogged, but lately I’ve been moved to return to writing again, so here I am!\n\nRather than rehash the past few years, which for many of us were filled with fear, heartbreak and grief, I decided to begin writing about my life, right now, today. So, off we go….\n\nNew Book!\n\nMy best friend, Linda, is about to publish her first book in November. She had asked me if she could include some of my photographs to add to the thoughtful delivery of her stories and reflections. I was thrilled as we perused my photographs and she chose those suitable. Here are just a few of the pics that will be included:\n\nGenealogy\n\nAlthough I haven’t done much more research on my family tree, I am beginning again to dive in. With a membership to Ancestry that expires in December 2023, I have a lot of work to do and only 3 short months to do it in. In particular, I am going to search out history on my paternal grandmother, and her matriarchal line for at least a few generations. Stay tuned!\n\nArt\n\nI’ve lacked the inspiration to paint or draw for the last few weeks, but decided yesterday to order myself a small tub of Daniel Smith Watercolor Ground. I watched an interesting YouTube video by Gabrielle Anna Cormier Art where she uses the watercolor ground to add interesting texture to an abstract piece. Not only did the product intrigue me, but so did the tones of gold and blue that she used. I’ll attempt to play with this during the upcoming weekend and post my progress.\n\nWOE … Way Of Eating\n\nI’ve decided that KETO and low carb eating is the healthiest way for me to lose weight going forward. In one month, I’ve lost 10 lbs, for which I’m so thankful. MRI results of my spine described my back as being moderate to severe for several issues (it ain’t gonna get better). So I’ve decided that I’m tired of carrying around these 40-50 extra pounds (and I’m sure my back is saying “It’s about time!”) Wishing myself luck and a healthier lifestyle and weight. I’ll update as I progress.\n\nOur Beginnings in the New World . . .\n\nMost of the millions of people of French Canadian descent today are descendants of one or more of The King’s Daughters – a courageous group of women from the 17th century.\n\nClose to 800 young and courageous women (between the ages of 12 and 25) arrived in Canada between 1663 and 1673. They came under the financial sponsorship of King Louis XIV of France to promote the settlement of his colony in Canada i.e., “New France”. Most of these women married, and the resultant population explosion gave rise to the success of the colony.\n\nI strongly encourage you to go towww.fillesduroi.org to read about these women. There is a detailed article which describes these young and brave women, their challenges, and their success:Lonely Colonist Seeks Wife: The forgotten History of America’s First Mail Order Brides; and the following link provides the complete list of The King’s Daughters: https://fillesduroi.org/cpage.php?pt=9]\n\nAlthough I am still researching, following is a draft list of those King’s Daughters who are our direct ancestors responsible for our lineage in North America. They are as follows:\n\nElisabeth-Agnes Lefebvre (b1655)\n\nAnne Pineau Delavieville Pineau (b1656)\n\nAnne Brochu Nicole Saulnier (b1651)\n\nMarguerite Lamain (b1656)\n\nElizabeth Isabelle Doucinet (b1647)\n\nMarie DeLemarre (b1650)\n\nMarie Prevost (b1639)\n\nMarie Ann Couture (b1641)\n\nMarie Madeleine DuMontier DeLeur (b1641)\n\nI am pleased to introduce you to our 9th Great-Grandmother, and Native American:\n\nMarie Olivier Sylvestre Manitouabeo8ich\n\nI’ve spoken several times with our cousin, Sondra Jacques, about our family history, stories, rumors, etc. One of the things she and I discussed was the rumor of our having Native American lineage. Sondra shared with me that Yvette Chaloux (Henry Chaloux’s daughter) has done extensive genealogical research and discovered that our 9th great-grandmother (on the Thibault side) was a Native American. Upon researching, I discovered that this young woman has an interesting and important history that I am so excited to share with you. She was a “very special little girl who would come to hold a unique place in Canadian history.” (quote from Ontario Metis Family Records Center)\n\nThe following links will send you to blog posts from the Ontario Metis Family Records Center which will introduce you to our 9th great-grandmother, Marie Olivier Sylvestre Manitouabeo8ich:\n\nhttps://www.omfrc.org/2016/11/church-company-special-child/ https://www.omfrc.org/2016/12/marie-olivier-sylvestre-special-name-history/\n\nIf you’re interested in further information about the Metis records (anyone with aboriginal history), click on the following link of the Ontario Metis Family Records Center, which provided me with the information about Marie: https://www.omfrc.org/ontario-metis-family-records-center/\n\nThe flow chart below shows that we are linked, not through a direct paternal Thibault line, but rather both paternal and maternal sides throughout in our lineage. I’m thankful for all the strong, resilient women in our history."
