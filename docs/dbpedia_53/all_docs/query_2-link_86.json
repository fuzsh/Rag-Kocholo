        "text": "Formation of a platelet plug at sites of vascular injury begins with the arrest of circulating platelets on collagen and continues as additional platelets are recruited by secreted or locally generated agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A2 (TxA2), and thrombin. Once initiated, the ability of the platelet mass to continue to grow depends in part upon the intracellular events that promote the binding of the integrin αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface to fibrinogen, fibrin, and von Willebrand factor (VWF). In turn, sustained contacts between platelets, which can only occur once aggregation has begun, make possible a wave of contact-dependent signaling that favors the further growth and stability of the platelet plug. In this context, the phrase “contact-dependent signaling” refers to the intracellular signaling events initiated by the binding of proteins on the surface of one platelet to proteins on the surface of an adjacent platelet, either directly or indirectly.\n\nAmong the examples of contact-dependent signaling that have been described in platelets, outside-in signaling through αIIbβ3 is the best known; however, others exist as well. We have recently shown that human platelets express on their surface 2 Eph kinases, EphA4 and EphB1, as well as the Eph kinase ligand, ephrinB1.1 Eph kinases are receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular kinase domain. Eph kinases and their ligands, which are known as ephrins, play a role in axon guidance2 and development of the vascular system.3,4 Ephrins fall into A and B groups based on their membrane anchor. Ephrin A family members have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Ephrin B family members have a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain includes sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and a C-terminal binding site for cytosolic proteins with PDZ domains. This gives the B ephrins at least 2 ways to engage in protein/protein interactions, both of which allow the ligand to serve as a “receptor” even though it does not have a kinase domain.5,6 Eph kinases are also divided into A and B families based on their ephrin-binding preferences, although EphA4 in particular can bind to ephrin B as well as ephrin A family members.7 Thus, human platelets express on their surface at least 2 Eph kinases and a ligand that can bind to either.\n\nStudies in cells that are normally adherent have shown that transcellular interactions between ephrins and Eph kinases can produce signals in both the ephrin- and the Eph kinase–presenting cell and that these signals can result in increased adhesion or repulsion.2,8,9 Given the fact that platelets are normally mobile, we have previously proposed that Eph/ephrin interactions promote the growth and stability of the platelet plug.10 Such interactions would not be expected to occur during the transient contacts between circulating platelets but would be made possible by the onset of aggregation. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that signaling through EphA4 and ephrinB1 causes platelets to adhere to immobilized fibrinogen and triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic domain of αIIbβ3. We also observed that EphA4 forms a complex with Fyn, Lyn, and the cell adhesion molecule L1 during platelet aggregation, and that blockade of Eph/ephrin interactions prevents this association. Finally, we found that blockade of Eph/ephrin interactions during platelet aggregation initiated by ADP, a protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) agonist (SFLLRN), or collagen causes premature disaggregation and inhibits clot retraction.1,11,12\n\nThe goal of the present study was to better understand the ways in which Eph/ephrin signaling can regulate αIIbβ3 activation in platelets and identify mechanisms that might be involved. We now show that Eph/ephrin signaling is able to potentiate platelet aggregation in response to agonists and also promotes the ability of platelet agonists to activate Rap1, a Ras family member that has been linked to integrin activation in a variety of cell types including platelets. We also show that the adhesion of platelets to immobilized fibrinogen in response to Eph/ephrin interactions requires phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)–kinase and protein kinase C, but, interestingly in light of what is known about signaling by ephrin B family members, neither the induction of adhesion nor Rap1 activation requires ephrin B1 phosphorylation or the activation of Src kinases. These results help to establish a model in which contact-dependent Eph/ephrin interactions between adjacent platelets promote platelet aggregation by helping to sustain integrin activation.\n\nThe initial stages of platelet activation in vivo are heavily dependent on signaling through G protein–coupled receptors or the GP VI complex, leading to the activation of phospholipase C β and γ isoforms and, eventually, activation of αIIbβ3. Although this is sufficient to initiate platelet aggregation, additional signaling events appear to have a role in the continued growth and stability of the hemostatic plug. These events are dependent upon or facilitated by platelet-platelet contacts that can only occur once platelet aggregation has begun. Outside-in signaling through integrins represents one example of contact-dependent signaling. Thus, platelets from mice in which outside-in signaling through αIIbβ3 has been impaired by mutating Y747 and Y759 in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 have a phenotype that includes impaired aggregation and defective clot retraction.21,22\n\nWe have proposed previously that Eph/ephrin interactions provide an additional source of contact-dependent signaling during human platelet plug formation. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown elsewhere that forced clustering of EphA4 and ephrinB1 causes platelets to adhere and spread on immobilized fibrinogen, and that blockade of Eph/ephrin interactions inhibits platelet aggregation.1,11,12 In this study, we investigated how Eph-ephrin signaling might contribute to platelet adhesion and aggregation. We were particularly interested in understanding how ephrinB1 might contribute to platelet activation since ephrinB1, like other ephrin B family members, lacks intrinsic kinase activity and can serve solely as a means to oligomerize (and activate) Eph kinases or can generate signals itself. The results show that at least 2 separate mechanisms appear to be at work.\n\nStated succinctly, our results show the following: (1) Isolated Eph-ephrin signaling is sufficient to initiate platelet adhesion to fibrinogen but not the binding of soluble fibrinogen or aggregation. (2) Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen initiated by ephrin signaling is blocked by RGDS and A2A9 and is therefore mediated by αIIbβ3. (3) Although insufficient to cause platelet aggregation, Eph/ephrin signals can enhance aggregation induced by agonists or by a Ca++ ionophore and potentiate Rap1 activation. (4) Eph/ephrin–mediated adhesion occurs slowly in comparison to other agonists (10-30 minutes), but the ability of Eph/ephrin interactions to potentiate aggregation is evident immediately. (5) Ephrin-mediated adhesion is dependent on PI3-kinase and protein kinase C but activation of Rap1 is not. (6) Both adhesion and Rap1 activation by ephrinB1 require clustering of the ephrin, but neither requires tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrinB1 nor the involvement of Src family kinases.\n\nThe involvement of αIIbβ3 is not unexpected but revealing, nonetheless, in light of other observations. Whatever the activation state of αIIbβ3 required for the integrin to bind to immobilized as opposed to soluble fibrinogen, it is now clear that isolated Eph kinase and ephrin signaling can achieve the former but not the latter. The observation that signaling through Eph kinases can regulate the adhesive function of integrins is consistent with previous studies.23-26 However, most of those studies were performed using cells that are normally adherent, unlike platelets, and both increases and decreases in integrin function were observed. For example, activation of EphB1 causes endothelial cells to attach via\n\n\\({\\alpha}_{\\mathrm{v}}{\\beta}_{3}^{23}\\)\n\nand P19 cells to attach to fibrinogen.25 On the other hand, activation of EphB2 on NIH-3T3 or HEK-293T cells inhibits adhesion,24 and activation of EphA2 in PC-3 cells inhibits both adhesion and spreading.26 Whether Eph/ephrin signaling causes an increase or decrease in integrin function presumably depends on the repertoire of effector molecules expressed in a given cell type. On platelets, an increase in attachment due to Eph/ephrin signaling appears to be the rule.\n\nAlthough signaling through ephrinB1 is insufficient to cause soluble fibrinogen binding or platelet aggregation, it is clearly able to potentiate platelet responses to agonists. If Eph/ephrin interactions are to extend and stabilize platelet aggregates after they begin to form, as we hypothesize, then we might expect that signaling by Eph kinases and ephrins would be especially important in platelets that have also been exposed to soluble agonists. Thus, our observation that ephrin signaling enhances aggregation only in the presence of other agonists is a finding that supports this hypothesis.\n\nIf signaling through ephrinB1 promotes integrin engagement and supports aggregation in platelets, how does it do so? One leading possibility is that the potentiation of aggregation is linked to the activation of Rap1. Several prior observations have suggested that Rap1 activation promotes integrin activation in platelets. For example, Bertoni et al17 have shown that overexpression of an inactive Rap1 mutant inhibits agonist-induced αIIbβ3 activation in megakaryocytes. They also found that expression of constitutively active Rap1 was not sufficient by itself to activate αIIbβ3 but potentiated activation of the integrin by an agonist, as does signaling through ephrinB1. Together with our data showing that ephrin B1 signaling activates Rap1 and potentiates the ability of other platelet agonists to do so, this suggests that ephrin signaling potentiates aggregation by enhancing activation of Rap1.\n\nIf isolated ephrinB1 signaling can cause Rap1 activation, why does it not also cause platelet aggregation? The studies in megakaryocytes cited above suggest that activated Rap1 by itself is incapable of activating αIIbβ3. However, clustering of ephrinB1 in platelets enhances aggregation and activation of Rap1 in response toaCa++ ionophore. Because ephrinB1 signaling by itself does not cause an increase in the cytosolic Ca++ concentration in platelets,1 it appears that the combination of ephrin signaling plus an increase in cytosolic Ca++ provides everything needed for platelets to bind soluble fibrinogen and aggregate.\n\nFinally, the results of the present studies provide additional information about the molecular basis for signaling by ephrinB1 in platelets. Unlike the receptor kinases EphA4 and EphB1, ephrinB1 lacks a kinase domain. However, ephrins also become activated when they are bound and clustered by their surface ligands. Clustered ephrins then serve as the nidus for signaling complexes. Two distinct modes of signaling downstream of ephrin B family members have been identified: one is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytosolic domain of the ephrin by a Src family member, followed by the binding of protein(s) with Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding protein (PTB) domains5,6 ; the other is dependent on the binding of cytosolic proteins with PDZ domains.27-30 The present studies show quite clearly that ephrinB1 phosphorylation is not required in platelets: complete elimination of phosphorylation had no effect on either adhesion or Rap1 activation. This novel finding in platelets extends a very recent report of phosphorylation-independent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by ephrinB1.31\n\nThe alternative to phosphotyrosine-based interactions is the PDZ target domain in ephrinB1. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Ras family members interact with B ephrins by this mechanism. Whether an appropriate PDZ-containing GEF exists in platelets and performs this function for Rap1 remains to be established. However, a direct link of this sort would be expected to be phosphorylation independent and thus not inhibited by PP2, as we have shown for ephrinB1-induced Rap1 activation. Such a link would also be expected to be independent of PI3-kinase activity, which is also the case with ephrinB1-induced Rap1 activation. The fact that PI3-kinase inhibitors reduce adhesion, but not Rap1 activation, would suggest that PI3-kinases support adhesion in a pathway that is either downstream of Rap1 activation or independent of Rap1 activation (Figure 8).\n\nIn conclusion, the present studies show that activation of EphA4 and ephrinB1 on the platelet surface can support the binding of αIIbβ3 to immobilized fibrinogen and promotes aggregation in response to biologically relevant platelet agonists. A sustained activation of the integrin in the context of a fibrin- and fibrinogen-embedded hemostatic plug would be expected to help to stabilize the plug. Taken together, these results provide a mechanism by which Eph/ephrin interactions can support the growth and stability of the hemostatic plug and point to the direction in which the necessary downstream effectors in platelets can be found.\n\nWe thank Gaston Vilaire, Joel Bennett, Hong Chen, Mark Kahn, Peter O'Brien, and Jing Yang for many helpful discussions.\n\n1\n\nPrevost N, Woulfe D, Tanaka T, Brass LF.
