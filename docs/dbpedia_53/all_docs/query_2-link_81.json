Shattil\n\nPlatelets form hemostatic plugs to prevent blood loss and they modulate immunity and inflammation in several ways. A key event during hemostasis is activation of integrin αIIbβ3 through direct interactions of the β3 cytoplasmic tail with talin and kindlin-3. Recently, we showed that human platelets express the adapter molecule, SHARPIN, that can associate directly with the αIIb cytoplasmic tail and can separately promote NF-κB pathway activation as a member of the Met-1 linear ubiquitination activation complex (LUBAC). Here we investigated the role of SHARPIN in platelets after crossing Sharpin flox/flox (fl/fl) mice with PF4-Cre or GPIbα-Cre mice to selectively delete SHARPIN in platelets. SHARPIN-null platelets adhered to immobilized fibrinogen through αIIbβ3, and they spread more extensively than littermate control platelets in a manner dependent on feedback stimulation by platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (P < 0.01). SHARPIN-null platelets showed increased colocalization of αIIbβ3 with talin as assessed by super-resolution microscopy and increased binding of soluble fibrinogen in response to sub-maximal concentrations of ADP (P < 0.05). However, mice with SHARPIN-null platelets showed compromised thrombus growth on collagen and slightly prolonged tail bleeding times. Platelets lacking SHARPIN also showed reduced NF-κB activation and linear ubiquitination of protein substrates upon challenge with classical platelet agonists. Furthermore, the loss of platelet SHARPIN resulted in significant reduction in inflammation in murine models of colitis and peritonitis (P < 0.01). Thus, SHARPIN plays differential and context-dependent roles in platelets to regulate important inflammatory and integrin adhesive functions of these anucleate cells.\n\nOptogenetic-based Localization of Talin to the Plasma Membrane Promotes Activation of β3 Integrins\n\nApril 2021\n\n·\n\n41 Reads\n\n·\n\n6 Citations\n\nJournal of Biological Chemistry\n\nZhongji Liao\n\n·\n\nAlexandre R Gingras\n\n·\n\nFrederic Lagarrigue\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nSanford J. Shattil\n\nInteraction of talin with the cytoplasmic tails of integrin β triggers integrin activation, leading to an increase of integrin affinity/avidity for extracellular ligands. In talin knockout mice, loss of talin interaction with platelet integrin αIIbβ3 causes a severe hemostatic defect, and loss of talin interaction with endothelial cell integrin αVβ3 affects angiogenesis. In normal cells, talin is auto-inhibited and localized in the cytoplasm. Here we employed an optogenetic platform to assess whether recruitment of full-length talin to the plasma membrane was sufficient to induce integrin activation. A dimerization module (CRY2 fused to the N-terminus of talin; CIBN-CAAX) responsive to 450 nm (blue) light was inserted into CHO cells and endothelial cells also expressing αIIbβ3 or αVβ3, respectively. Thus, exposure of the cells to blue light caused a rapid and reversible recruitment of CRY2-talin to the CIBN-CAAX-decorated plasma membrane. This resulted in β3 integrin activation in both cell types, as well as increasing migration of the endothelial cells. However, membrane recruitment of talin was not sufficient for integrin activation, as membrane-associated Rap1-GTP was also required. Moreover, talin mutations that interfered with its direct binding to Rap1 abrogated β3 integrin activation. Altogether, these results define a role for the plasma membrane recruitment of talin in β3 integrin activation, and they suggest a nuanced sequence of events thereafter involving Rap1-GTP.\n\nGenetic Instruction of Megakaryocytes and Platelets Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Studies of Integrin Regulation\n\nJanuary 2021\n\n·\n\n7 Reads\n\n·\n\n1 Citation\n\nMethods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)\n\nAna Kasirer-Friede\n\n·\n\nSanford J. Shattil\n\nPlatelets are small, anucleate cells that play oversized roles in hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation. An important mediator of platelet function is integrin αIIbβ3, which is required for fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation during hemostasis. This platelet response is dependent on conformational changes in the integrin induced by “inside-out” biochemical signals that are triggered by platelet agonists. In turn, fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 initiates “outside-in” biochemical and mechanical signals that regulate the platelet cytoskeleton and help to promote full platelet aggregation and secretory responses. Without a nucleus, there is a limited range of experimental manipulations that are possible with human platelets to study the molecular basis of integrin signaling in these primary cells. Consequently, many studies of αIIbβ3 function use genetic approaches that rely on heterologous expression systems or platelets from gene-targeted mice, sometimes with uncertain applicability to human platelets. This chapter will detail a method for genetic manipulation of megakaryocytes and platelets derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells for molecular studies of αIIbβ3 signaling and for modeling of human platelet functions potentially relevant to hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation.\n\nUnderlying Immune Disorder May Predispose Some Transthyretin Amyloidosis Subjects to Inotersen-Mediated Thrombocytopenia\n\nFebruary 2020\n\n·\n\n48 Reads\n\n·\n\n23 Citations\n\nNucleic Acid Therapeutics\n\nPadmaKumar Narayanan\n\n·\n\nBrian R Curtis\n\n·\n\nLijiang Shen\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nSteven G. Hughes\n\nInotersen, a 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide, reduced disease progression and improved quality of life in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN) in the NEURO-TTR and NEURO-TTR open-label extension (OLE) trials. However, 300 mg/week inotersen treatment was associated with platelet count reductions in several patients. Mean platelet counts in patients in the NEURO-TTR-inotersen group remained ≥140 × 109/L in 50% and ≥100 × 109/L in 80% of the subjects. However, grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25 × 109/L) occurred in three subjects in NEURO-TTR trial, and one of these suffered a fatal intracranial hemorrhage. The two others were treated successfully with corticosteroids and discontinuation of inotersen. Investigations in a subset of subjects in NEURO-TTR (n = 17 placebo; n = 31 inotersen) and OLE (n = 33) trials ruled out direct myelotoxicity, consumptive coagulopathy, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Antiplatelet immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected at baseline in 5 of 31 (16%) inotersen-treated subjects in NEURO-TTR, 4 of whom eventually developed grade 1 or 2 thrombocytopenia while on the drug. In addition, 24 subjects in the same group developed treatment-emergent antiplatelet IgG antibodies, of which 2 developed grade 2, and 3 developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Antiplatelet IgG antibodies in two of the three grade 4 thrombocytopenia subjects targeted GPIIb/IIIa. Plasma cytokines previously implicated in immune dysregulation, such as interleukin (IL)-23 and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) were often above the normal range at baseline. Collectively, these findings suggest an underlying immunologic dysregulation predisposing some individuals to immune-mediated thrombocytopenia during inotersen treatment.\n\nSHARPIN at the nexus of integrin, immune, and inflammatory signaling in human platelets\n\nFebruary 2019\n\n·\n\n56 Reads\n\n·\n\n20 Citations\n\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n\nAna Kasirer-Friede\n\n·\n\nWinson Tjahjono\n\n·\n\nKoji Eto\n\n·\n\nSanford J. Shattil\n\nSignificance Platelets are professional hemostatic and immune cells. Integrin αIIbβ3 is required for fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation, but its role in immune/inflammatory responses is poorly understood. We identified interactions between αIIbβ3 and SHARPIN, a requisite member of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which mediates Met1 ubiquitination of signaling proteins. Using human platelets and megakaryocyte-lineage cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, we find that SHARPIN is expressed in platelets and associates either with αIIb to suppress αIIbβ3 activation or with LUBAC to promote Met1 ubiquitination and NF-κB activation. Knockdown of SHARPIN in the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage not only primes αIIbβ3 for fibrinogen binding, but also increases MHC class I presentation and proinflammatory sCD40L release. Thus, SHARPIN functions at the nexus of αIIbβ3 and immune/inflammatory signaling in platelets.\n\nuPAR isoform 2 forms a dimer and induces severe kidney disease in mice\n\nFebruary 2019\n\n·\n\n161 Reads\n\n·\n\n58 Citations\n\nThe Journal of clinical investigation\n\nChangli Wei\n\n·\n\nJing Li\n\n·\n\nBrian D. Adair\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nJochen Reiser\n\nSoluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is an immune-derived circulating signaling molecule that has been implicated in chronic kidney disease, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Typically, native uPAR (isoform 1) translates to a 3-domain protein capable of binding and activating integrins, yet the function of additional isoforms generated by alternative splicing is unknown. Here, we characterized mouse uPAR isoform 2 (msuPAR2), encoding domain I and nearly one-half of domain II, as a dimer in solution, as revealed by 3D electron microscopy structural analysis. In vivo, msuPAR2 transgenic mice exhibited signs of severe renal disease characteristic of FSGS with proteinuria, loss of kidney function, and glomerulosclerosis. Sequencing of the glomerular RNAs from msuPAR2-Tg mice revealed a differentially expressed gene signature that includes upregulation of the suPAR receptor Itgb3, encoding β3 integrin. Crossing msuPAR2-transgenic mice with 3 different integrin β3 deficiency models rescued msuPAR2-mediated kidney function. Further analyses indicated a central role for β3 integrin and c-Src in msuPAR2 signaling and in human FSGS kidney biopsies. Administration of Src inhibitors reduced proteinuria in msuPAR2-transgenic mice. In conclusion, msuPAR2 may play an important role in certain forms of scarring kidney disease.\n\nRap1 binding to the talin 1 F0 domain makes a minimal contribution to murine platelet GPIIb-IIIa activation\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n·\n\n196 Reads\n\n·\n\n30 Citations\n\nBlood Advances\n\nFrederic Lagarrigue\n\n·\n\nAlexandre R Gingras\n\n·\n\nDavid S. Paul\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nMark H. Ginsberg\n\nActivation of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa; integrin αIIbβ3) leads to high-affinity fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation during hemostasis. Whereas GTP-bound Rap1 GTPase promotes talin 1 binding to the β3 cytoplasmic domain to activate platelet GPIIb-IIIa, the Rap1 effector that regulates talin association with β3 in platelets is unknown. Rap1 binding to the talin 1 F0 subdomain was proposed to forge the talin 1-Rap1 link in platelets. Here, we report a talin 1 point mutant (R35E) that significantly reduces Rap1 affinity without a significant effect on its structure or expression. Talin 1 head domain (THD) (R35E) was of similar potency to wild-type THD in activating αIIbβ3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Coexpression with activated Rap1b increased activation, and coexpression with Rap1GAP1 reduced activation caused by transfection of wild-type THD or THD(R35E). Furthermore, platelets from Tln1 R35E/R35E mice showed similar GPIIb-IIIa activation to those from wild-type littermates in response to multiple agonists. Tln1 R35E/R35E platelets exhibited slightly reduced platelet aggregation in response to low doses of agonists; however, there was not a significant hemostatic defect, as judged by tail bleeding times. Thus, the Rap1-talin 1 F0 interaction has little effect on platelet GPIIb-IIIa activation and hemostasis and cannot account for the dramatic effects of loss of Rap1 activity on these platelet functions.\n\nFlow cytometric studies of platelet responses to shear stress in whole blood\n\nSeptember 2017\n\n·\n\n30 Reads\n\n·\n\n9 Citations\n\nBiorheology\n\nKonstantinos Konstantopoulos\n\n·\n\nKenneth K.

Shattil\n\nαVβ3 is reported to promote angiogenesis in some model systems but not in others. Here we used optogenetics to study effects of αVβ3 interaction with the intracellular adapter, kindlin-2, on endothelial cell functions potentially relevant to angiogenesis. Since interaction of kindlin-2 with αVβ3 requires the C-terminal three residues of the β3 cytoplasmic tail (Arg-Gly-Thr; RGT), optogenetic probes LOVpep and ePDZ1 were fused to β3ΔRGT-GFP and mCherry-kindlin2, respectively, and expressed in β3-null microvascular endothelial cells. Exposure of the cells to 450 nm (blue) light caused rapid and specific interaction of kindlin-2 with αVβ3 as assessed by immunofluorescence and TIRF microscopy, and it led to increased endothelial cell migration, podosome formation and angiogenic sprouting. Analyses of kindlin-2 mutants indicated that interaction of kindlin-2 with other kindlin-2 binding partners, including c-Src, actin, integrin-linked kinase and phosphoinositides, were also likely necessary for these endothelial cell responses. Thus, kindlin-2 promotes αVβ3-dependent angiogenic functions of endothelial cells through its simultaneous interactions with β3 and several other binding partners. Optogenetic approaches should find further use in clarifying spatiotemporal aspects of vascular cell biology."
