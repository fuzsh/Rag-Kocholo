        "text": "Prévost History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nThe surname Prévost is a ancient French name. It was a name given to a person from Brittany who was a prefect or chief magistrate. 1 Looking back even further, we found the name was originally derived from the Old French word, \"prevost\", which signified someone of that title. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Prévost family\n\nThe surname Prévost was first found in Brittany (French: Bretagne) where this noble family originated in ancient times.\n\nLords of Bonneseaux are cited in 1427 and maintained nobility of ancient extraction in 1669. The name was also found in Montreuil in the 18th century with a group of Lords from Bourgogne and a Commissioner General in the Navy. 1\n\nFrançois Prevost, born in 1638, son of Charles and Jeanne, was the Major of the Château Saint-Louis and Governor of Trois-Rivières. He married Geneviève Macard, daughter of Nicolas and Marguerite, in the province of Quebec on 1st August 1679. They remained together in Quebec until François passed away on 5th June 1702. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Prévost family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Prévost research. Another 122 words (9 lines of text) covering the years 1547, 1580, 1600, 1622, 1638, 1665, 1670, 1680, 1697, 1699, 1700, 1702, 1724, 1729, 1732, 1741, 1753, 1763, 1785, 1822, 1824, 1825, 1830, 1831, 1839, 1843, 1848, 1850 and 1865 are included under the topic Early Prévost History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nPrévost Spelling Variations\n\nThe many different spellings of French surnames can be partially explained by the use of local dialects and by the influence of other languages during the early development of the French language. As a result of these linguistic and cultural influences, the name Prévost is distinguished by a number of regional variations. The many spelling variations of the name include Prévost, Prévoste, Prévosts, Prévostes, Prévaust, Prévauste, Prévaustes, Prévausts, de Prévost, du Prévost and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Prévost family\n\nNotable amongst this name at this time was\n\nLouis-Constant Prévost-Paradol, journalist, Man of Letters, member of the French Academy\n\nFrançoise Prévost (c. 1680-1741), a French ballerina\n\nPrévost World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Prévost is the 6,525th most popular surname with an estimated 4,974 people with that name. 4 However, in Canada, the name Prévost is ranked the 591st most popular surname with an estimated 8,509 people with that name. 5 And in Quebec, Canada, the name Prévost is the 247th popular surname. 6 France ranks Prévost as 132nd with 22,734 people. 7\n\nLoading...\n\nPrévost migration to the United States +\n\nFrance finally gave land incentives for 2,000 migrants during the 1700s. Early marriage was encouraged in New France, and youths of 18 took fourteen-year-old girls for their wives. The fur trade was developed and attracted migrants, both noble and commoner from France. 15,000 explorers left Montreal in the late 17th and 18th centuries, leaving French names scattered across the continent. The search for the Northwest passage continued. Migration from France to New France or Quebec, as it was now more popularly called, continued until 1759. By 1675, there were 7000 French in Quebec. By the same year the Acadian presence in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had reached 500. In the treaty of Utrecht, the Acadians were ceded by France to Britain in 1713. In 1755, 10,000 French Acadians refused to take an oath of allegiance to England and were deported. They found refuge in Louisiana. Meanwhile, in Quebec, the French race flourished, founding in Lower Canada, one of the two great solitudes which became Canada. Many of this distinguished family name Prévost were prominent in social, cultural, religious and political affairs in France and New France.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 10\n\nPrévost Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nJohn Prevost, who settled in Barbados in 1685\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Prévost (post 1700) +\n\nPierre Dominique Prévost, French Brigadier General during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1789 to 1815 11\n\nFrançoise Prévost (1930-1997), French actress, journalist and author\n\nFlorent Prévost (1794-1870), French naturalist and illustrator\n\nEugene Marcel Prévost (1862-1941), French author and dramatist\n\nDaniel Prévost (b. 1939), French actor and humorist, best known for his role in the French television series Le Petit Rapporteur\n\nLouis-Constant Prévost (1787-1856), French geologist\n\nCharles Prévost (1899-1983), French chemist\n\nHelene Prevost, French two time silver Olympic medalist for tennis during the 1900 games\n\nJean Prévost (1901-1944), French writer and Resistance fighter\n\nJoël Prévost (b. 1950), French singer\n\n...
