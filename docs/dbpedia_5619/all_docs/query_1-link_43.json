        "text": "Maybe you’ve seen that famous snapshot of four of the greatest center fielders in New York baseball history, walking in together from their position.\n\nJoe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Duke Snider and Mickey Mantle made that stroll on July 16, 1977, at Shea Stadium, instantly creating another treasured memory for an appreciative crowd.\n\nThe occasion?\n\nIt was Old Timers’ Day, hosted by the New York Mets, at a time when it was better to recall the heroes of yesteryear than focus on the awful team of the present.\n\nAs bad as the Mets were for long stretches, you could count on the franchise to put on a good show for Old Timers’ Day, always a highlight of the schedule.\n\nNow, after a 27-year absence, the Mets are reviving that tradition at Citi Field.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Mets announced that they will host Old Timers’ Day on Aug. 27, with ceremonies beginning two hours before their scheduled 7 p.m. game against the Colorado Rockies.\n\n“Bringing back Old Timers’ Day was one of the most passionate requests I heard from our fans,’’ Mets owner Steve Cohen said in a statement.\n\n“As we celebrate our 60th anniversary season, having these legendary players return to the ballpark to hear cheers from Mets fans once again is the perfect way to honor our past.’’\n\nJon Matlack, Felix Millan, Mookie Wilson, Ron Swoboda, Howard Johnson, Bobby Ojeda, Robin Ventura, Turk Wendell, Endy Chavez, Cliff Floyd and Daniel Murphy are among the former Mets scheduled to attend, as well as Frank Thomas, 92, an original Met.\n\nMany more additional former players are expected to join that preliminary roster, according to the Mets.\n\n“I plan on taking some BP before the game,’’ Thomas said in a statement released by the club. “I hit homers at the Polo Grounds and at Shea. I would love to hit one at Citi Field.’’\n\nThe Mets last hosted an Old Timers’ Day in 1994.\n\n“Being back in the clubhouse with the guys will be great,’’ Matlack said via statement. “But probably the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to see the Tom Seaver statue. Tom meant everything to my career. He was such a terrific teammate.’’\n\nThe long-awaited statue of Seaver, who died in 2020, is scheduled to be unveiled on Opening Day.\n\nAs for the Old Timers’ Day game itself, Floyd is planning to have fun, \"other than the fact that I'm terrified of hurting myself and doing something stupid,'' joked the lefty power hitter who played with the Mets from 2003-06 and retired after the 2009 season.\n\nOnce more, Ventura will be reminded of his famous \"Grand Slam Single,'' the game-winning hit in Game 5 of the 1999 NL Championship Series against Atlanta, and how a full-house Shea crowd roared in big moments.\n\n“There’s just a certain noise that Shea had&mldr;I can’t think of another stadium that was like that,’’ said Ventura. Instead of the sound rising, “the noise came down and you felt it in your chest.’’\n\nNow a student assistant baseball coach at Oklahoma State, where he's completing his degree at age 54, Ventura - a former Chicago White Sox manager - has not closed the door on another MLB opportunity should one come along.\n\nThe MVP of the 2015 NLCS, Murphy - soon to turn 37 - has a good-natured sense of humor about being the youngest Old-Timer.\n\n\"I have such a fond place in my heart for the Mets...I was really excited,'' Murphy said of receiving the invitation in a phone call from Mets alumni director Jay Horwitz.\n\nMurphy exited as a free agent following that pennant-winning season and retired as a player last year.\n\n\"I’m sure when I hit the field my mind will be racing back to 2015,'' Murphy said. \"That was an incredibly special time.’’\n\nPete Caldera is the Yankees beat writer for NorthJersey.com.
