        "text": "Of the three basic components of baseball--pitching, hitting and\n\nfielding--only one is practiced with greater skill today than\n\never before. Pitching? Please. That discussion begins and ends\n\nwith two words: Colorado Rockies. Hitting? Another swing and a\n\nmiss. Major league players struck out more often last year than\n\nin any other season, despite a strike-shortened 144-game\n\nschedule. No one has hit .400 since Ted Williams, 55 years ago,\n\nand Roger Maris's home run record has stood virtually\n\nunchallenged for 35 years, longer than Babe Ruth's mark endured.\n\nThis is a glove story: Boy meets ball, boy gets ball. In no\n\nother aspect of the game but fielding has the evolution of\n\nequipment, playing conditions and overall athletic ability\n\ntranslated into such an unequivocal upgrade. Last season\n\nfielders committed one error for every 52.9 chances, a 30%\n\nimprovement from 1975. And shortstops, who play the most\n\nchallenging position, averaged one error every 34.4 chances,\n\nmaking them 33% more reliable than shortstops of 20 years earlier.\n\nTo even the best glovemen of, say, 40 years ago, today's\n\nstate-of-the-art fielder would have seemed like something out of\n\nscience fiction: a 6'4\", 220-pound shortstop, who is armed with\n\ncomputerized scouting reports of hitters' tendencies and a\n\nlarge, ergonomically designed glove of fine leather, gobbling up\n\ngrounders on fields--some of which are carpeted--groomed more\n\nneatly than an Augusta fairway and who flubs as few as three\n\nplays over a 162-game season.\n\nThat robostop, Cal Ripken Jr., has handled more consecutive\n\nchances without an error (431 in 1990) than anyone who has ever\n\nplayed the position. Likewise, no one has ever handled more\n\nerrorless chances consecutively at second base (484 from June\n\n1994 to July 1995) than Roberto Alomar. Talk about your heavenly\n\nalignments: This year they will play next to one another in the\n\nBaltimore Orioles' infield, forming what should be the best\n\ndouble play combination of all time.\n\nIn Chicago the Cubs start the only right side of an infield in\n\nhistory in which both the first baseman (Mark Grace) and second\n\nbaseman (Ryne Sandberg) have won at least three Gold Gloves. In\n\nSt. Louis the best fielding shortstop of all time, Ozzie Smith,\n\nhas returned for a 19th season with the Cardinals, though he may\n\nlose his starting job to a younger gloveman, Royce Clayton. In\n\nNew York the Mets will start a shortstop, Rey Ordonez, who\n\nalready promises to be as good as or better than Smith, even\n\nthough he has yet to play a major league game. In San Diego the\n\nPadres will start an entire outfield of former Gold Glove\n\nwinners: Rickey Henderson in left, Steve Finley in center and\n\nTony Gwynn in right. The reigning Gold Glove catchers, four-time\n\nwinner Ivan Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers and Charles Johnson\n\nof the Florida Marlins, are not yet 25 years old. It turns out\n\nthe game is in good hands.\n\n\"I think players catch the ball better than they ever did,\" says\n\nBuddy Kerr, 73, a slick shortstop for the New York Giants from\n\n1943 to '49, who now scouts for the Mets. \"They have more speed\n\nand quickness and the advantages of better gloves and fields.\n\nMarty Marion was a great shortstop, but I don't think anyone was\n\nbetter than Ozzie. And I can't believe anybody was better at\n\nsecond base than Alomar.\"\n\nTwo veteran Toronto Blue Jays scouts, Bobby Mattick, 80, and Al\n\nLaMacchia, 74, were discussing second basemen in spring training\n\nthis year when they decided that Alomar was the best ever at the\n\nposition. \"Tony Lazzeri and Charlie Gehringer were good second\n\nbasemen,\" LaMacchia says. \"They were good in the area they\n\ncovered, but they didn't have the range Alomar has. That's the\n\nbig difference between a guy like him and the guys from the old\n\ndays. They didn't have that quickness.\"\n\nUnlike the main hitting and pitching records, most of the\n\nsignificant fielding records have been set in recent years. With\n\nthe exception of third baseman Brooks Robinson (1955 to '77),\n\nthe career fielding-average leaders at each position all have\n\nplayed exclusively in the post-1961 expansion era: catcher Bill\n\nFreehan, first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Sandberg,\n\nshortstop Larry Bowa and outfielder Terry Puhl.\n\nSimilarly, the consecutive errorless games records have been set\n\nin the past 11 years, with one exception: third baseman Jim\n\nDavenport, who played 97 games without booting a ball from July\n\n'66 to April '68. The other marks are held by catcher Rick\n\nCerone (159 games), Garvey (193), Sandberg (123), Ripken (95)\n\nand outfielder Darren Lewis (392).\n\nThose players had advantages not enjoyed by, say, Pee Wee Reese,\n\nwho once made 47 errors in a season for the Brooklyn Dodgers; or\n\nAlvin Dark, who committed 45 errors for the pennant-winning 1951\n\nNew York Giants; or, especially, by John Gochnaur, the Cleveland\n\nIndians shortstop whose modern record of 95 errors in 1903 is\n\nlikely never to be broken. Those advantages include the following:\n\n--Better gloves. Today's mitts provide better flexibility and fit.\n\n--Artificial turf. In the 1990s there have been 11% fewer errors\n\nper fielding chance committed on turf than on grass. During this\n\nperiod shortstops have made 23% fewer errors on rugs than on\n\ngrass. Of the five shortstops with the best fielding percentages\n\nin history (minimum 1,000 games), four have played mostly on\n\nartificial turf. In order of their defensive prowess, they are\n\nBowa, Tony Fernandez, Smith and Spike Owen. The exception is\n\nRipken, who ranks third. The best fielding teams in history--at\n\nleast statistically--were turf teams: the 1988 Minnesota Twins\n\ncommitted the fewest errors (84), and the 1990 Toronto Blue Jays\n\nhad the highest fielding average (.986).\n\n--Improved playing conditions. Most outfield walls are padded,\n\nand fields are vigilantly maintained. \"That started with Peter\n\nUeberroth as commissioner in the 1980s,\" says Giants general\n\nmanager Bob Quinn. \"He liked to say, 'The field is your stage.\n\nAlways make it look good.'\"\n\n--High-tech scouting reports. Satellite television, computers and\n\nadvance scouts help define hitters' tendencies in greater\n\ndetail. \"You know where somebody hits the ball on two-strike\n\ncounts and who swings early in the count,\" says the Montreal\n\nExpos' 60-year-old manager, Felipe Alou. \"All of that is in\n\nblack and white. We didn't know any of that when I played. We\n\njust positioned ourselves in the vicinity of where somebody\n\nusually hit the ball.\"\n\nSays Texas Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, \"I think guys\n\ntoday have more agility and flexibility. They make plays every\n\nnight like diving flat-out in the outfield and crashing into\n\nwalls that I don't think players in other eras made as often.\n\nMaybe the best fielders today are the best ever. But overall?\n\nI'm not sure defense is better than in the past.\"\n\nThis being a glove story, there must be a catch. This is it:\n\nWhile players catch the ball better than ever, they don't have\n\nthe same instincts or grasp of fundamentals as their\n\npredecessors. \"There's no question the players now are better\n\nathletes,\" says LaMacchia. \"If a scout saw Hack Wilson or Yogi\n\nBerra today, he'd never recommend either of them. Lou Boudreau\n\ncouldn't run, and neither could Luke Appling. They weren't real\n\ngood athletes. But they had the instincts.\n\n\"Now you've got guys like [Kansas City Royals shortstop] Jose\n\nOfferman. He has all the physical tools, but he doesn't know how\n\nto play the game. Players today don't listen. They feel they\n\nknow it all, so they don't work on fundamentals.\"\n\nPlayers might be rushed more quickly to the big leagues today,\n\nbut when they arrive, they are armed with an unprecedented\n\namount of instruction. Today, a typical minor league team has a\n\nmanager, two coaches and a roving instructor. \"When I played in\n\nthe minors,\" Alou says, \"we had one manager and six baseballs\n\nfor batting practice. Sometimes one or two of us didn't hit\n\nbecause all the balls were lost.\"\n\n\"Even 15 or 20 years ago, you had a minor league manager and\n\nthat was it,\" says Cubs skipper Jim Riggleman. \"Maybe some\n\nthings were missed then. Nothing is missed anymore. Believe me,\n\nthere are people working hard and covering all the areas. There\n\nare no excuses for people to get to the big leagues not knowing\n\nhow to play. If a player gets to the majors and isn't\n\nfundamentally sound, it's his own fault.\"\n\nMajor league managers routinely pay lip service to defense. As\n\nGiants manager Dusty Baker says, \"If you mess up three to six\n\nplays a game--say two errors, some double plays not turned,\n\nthings like that--it's the same as letting the other team bat 10\n\nor 11 innings to your nine.\" But front offices don't put their\n\nmoney where their mouths are: They reward offense and overlook\n\ndefense. \"We don't put enough value on defense,\" says Boston Red\n\nSox general manager Dan Duquette. \"How many $3 million players\n\nare there because they play good defense? [Indians shortstop]\n\nOmar Vizquel (page 68) and [Marlins centerfielder] Devon White\n\nmay be it. It's true we don't reward defense like we do offense.\"\n\nSays Cubs centerfielder Brian McRae, referring to a teammate,\n\n\"Look at Sammy Sosa. He was a good defensive player who went\n\ndownhill in the field last year. He made 13 errors. Led the\n\nleague's outfielders in errors. But he hit 36 home runs and\n\nwound up with a $5 million contract. It's the same in\n\narbitration. Defense doesn't matter. They pay for offense.\"\n\nMoreover, some teams have proved you can win championships with\n\nmediocre or even bad defenses. Toronto general manager Gord Ash\n\nsays the Blue Jays earned the 1993 world championship with \"only\n\nadequate defense. We won that year because of our offense.\"\n\nThe Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers each won divisional\n\ntitles last season despite having the worst defenses in their\n\nrespective leagues. This year Boston figures to be even poorer\n\ndefensively because it is converting a former shortstop and\n\nleftfielder, Wil Cordero, to second base and sending an inept\n\ngloveman, former DH Jose Canseco, back to rightfield. Referring\n\nto a lineup packed with beefy sluggers, Duquette says, \"It's the\n\nkind of team fans like to see at Fenway Park.\"\n\nSays one scout, \"Look at the Indians. They were the best team in\n\nthe league, and they had only one good infielder, Vizquel. The\n\nrest were below average. And they had only one good outfielder,\n\n[Kenny] Lofton. The other two [Albert Belle and Manny Ramirez]\n\nwere terrible.\"\n\nIncreasingly, teams who are weak defensively try to compensate\n\nby loading up with big hitters or, as the Dodgers did last\n\nseason, with a pitching staff that gets a lot of strikeouts. The\n\nball simply isn't put into play as much as it used to be. For\n\nexample, the records for most chances at each position except\n\ncatcher (where strikeouts count as putouts) have stood since at\n\nleast 1937.\n\nNo position better illustrates the evolution of athletes and\n\noffensive emphasis than shortstop. Twenty years ago the 24\n\nstarting shortstops weighed an average of 168 pounds, batted\n\n.250 and homered once every 185 at bats. Last year the 28\n\nstarting shortstops weighed an average of 181 pounds, hit .260\n\nand homered once every 49 at bats. And yet shortstops in 1995\n\ncommitted 19% fewer errors than their 1976 counterparts.\n\nBaseball has squeezed out the light-hitting shortstop who hung\n\non only because of his glove. Players like Dal Maxvill (who\n\naveraged .217 while lasting 14 years), Mark Belanger (.228, 18\n\nyears) and Bud Harrelson (.236, 16 years) would have little\n\nchance of being long-term starters now. \"Today you couldn't\n\ncarry a guy like Belanger,\" says Orioles manager Davey Johnson,\n\nBelanger's former teammate. The prototype is Ripken or National\n\nLeague MVP Barry Larkin (6 feet, 195 pounds) of the Cincinnati\n\nReds. The next generation of shortstops includes the Rangers'\n\nBenji Gil (6'2\", 182), the New York Yankees' Derek Jeter (6'3\",\n\n185) and the Seattle Mariners' Alex Rodriguez (6'3\", 195).\n\nOnce teams leave spring training, they rarely practice defensive\n\ndrills, other than a coach hitting routine grounders and fly\n\nballs. Few players, even the best fielders, labor at defense the\n\nway they do offense. The Giants' Gold Glove third baseman, Matt\n\nWilliams, for instance, likes to take only 30 to 40 grounders\n\neach day. \"Quality is better than quantity,\" says Williams, who\n\nfirst took pride in his defense as a sophomore in high school.\n\nWhenever Smith feels his hands aren't \"soft enough,\" he fields\n\nhard ground balls on his knees at the edge of the infield grass.\n\n\"It takes your lower body away and forces you to rely on your\n\nquickness,\" Smith says. \"I've done that all my life.\" On his\n\nfirst day in spring training this year Smith flawlessly fielded\n\ngrounders at shortstop and--without turning his head to\n\nlook--blindly fired one perfect feed after another to second base.\n\nThis is a golden age of middle infielders, with Alomar, Larkin,\n\nOrdonez, Ripken, Sandberg, Smith and the Houston Astros' Craig\n\nBiggio. And as Grace notes, \"More and more teams are putting a\n\nbetter defensive player at first base rather than just a big ox\n\nwho hits the ball out of the ballpark.\" He counts Jeff Bagwell\n\nof the Astros, Rico Brogna of the Mets, David Segui of the Expos\n\nand J.T. Snow of the Angels among the young first basemen who\n\nare smooth with the mitt. (Third base, a position that does not\n\nplace a premium on athleticism beyond quick reflexes, has shown\n\nno statistical fielding improvement over the past quarter\n\ncentury.)\n\nThe evolution of outfield play is a mixed bag. Outfielders run\n\ndown the ball better than ever, but their lack of arm strength\n\nis universally bemoaned by baseball executives. \"You used to see\n\na lot of guys thrown out at home and on the bases,\" Baltimore\n\ngeneral manager Pat Gillick says. \"Now it's rare.\"\n\n\"Scouts tell me that the last thing on their list is arm\n\nstrength,\" says Baker. \"Kids just don't throw enough to build up\n\narm strength. You look for someone who can run the ball down.\"\n\nIn 1930, Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Chuck Klein set the\n\nmodern record for assists, with 44. Sixty-three years later\n\nanother Philadelphia outfielder, Lenny Dykstra, threw out only\n\ntwo runners all year. In 1958, Al Kaline led American League\n\noutfielders with 23 assists, and Roberto Clemente led the\n\nNational League with 22. Of active players, the Dodgers' Raul\n\nMondesi is the closest to those classic gunners. He led all\n\noutfielders last year with 16 assists.\n\n\"Guys today cover their mistakes with speed,\" LaMacchia says.\n\n\"Joe DiMaggio glided after balls. He didn't have to dive. But\n\nnow they make spectacular catches after they misjudge fly balls.\n\nHow many true centerfielders are there today, guys who can run\n\nit down and throw people out? Devon White, [the Seattle\n\nMariners'] Ken Griffey Jr., [the Atlanta Braves'] Marquis\n\nGrissom. That's about it.\"\n\nSays McRae, \"Good defensive players are naturals. You're either\n\na good defensive player or you're not. Look at Ryan Klesko with\n\nAtlanta. I mean, he's worked hard and gotten a little better out\n\nthere, but he's only going to be so good.\"\n\nDefense, despite its improvement, is the least appreciated side\n\nof the game. \"Brooks Robinson made the Hall of Fame primarily on\n\ndefense and Ozzie Smith will, but that's it,\" says Yankees\n\nmanager Joe Torre. \"It's not recognized enough.\"\n\nIn this era when players catch the ball better than ever,\n\nroutinely fill the nightly highlight shows with acrobatic plays\n\nand get to balls Tony Lazzeri only dreamed about, there is just\n\none sure place to find the true value of defense. Ask a pitcher.\n\n\"It's huge,\" says Braves lefthander Tom Glavine, whose\n\ncareer--along with those of pitching mates John Smoltz and Steve\n\nAvery--turned around in 1991. \"Things changed completely that\n\nyear when we got [third baseman] Terry Pendleton, [shortstop]\n\nRafael Belliard and [first baseman] Sid Bream. It made us more\n\nconfident. We knew we didn't have to make the perfect pitch, so\n\nwe threw more strikes. I can honestly say, we would not be the\n\npitchers we are today if we had kept the same defense we had in\n\n'88 and '89. Other people may take it for granted. But defense\n\nis a pitcher's best friend.\"\n\nGraphic by Kinuko Craft\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: CHUCK SOLOMON Fielders now benefit from superior gloves, well-groomed playing fields and high-tech scouting.
