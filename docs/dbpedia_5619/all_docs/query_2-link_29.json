        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio - In just its first 12 years, Yankee Stadium had already woven its way into baseball lore. The grandest ballpark in the nation's largest city was home to five of the Yankees' seven American League pennants and four World Series crowns, and the genesis for a growing parade of Hall of Fame careers. This was, after all, the House that Ruth Built.\n\nThus, if there was ever a perfect place for Cleveland's Bob Feller to first face New York's Joe DiMaggio, it had to be here, enjoining persons with place in a testament to youth, power and possibility.\n\nBefore meeting each other on Sept. 3, 1936, the rookies had already boldly introduced themselves to the baseball world. Feller -- all of 17 years with apple cheeks and a flamethrower for a fastball -- struck out 15 in his first start for the Indians. DiMaggio -- 21 and as handsome as his smooth swing -- was already an All-Star on his way to becoming the next Yankee legend.\n\nShortly before gametime, hitter and hurler shared a relaxed pregame chat. Not long afterward, Feller stepped on the mound, beginning a fierce, yet respectful rivalry that would span 12 seasons and feature career-defining moments that would ultimately be etched in bronze in Cooperstown. Feller and DiMaggio would see a lot of each other over the years as neither would face an opponent more. From beginning to end, theirs was one of the game's premier attractions, often played before the largest crowds and under the weight of the biggest hype.\n\n\"It got so it was more like a circus when we faced each other,\" Feller later recalled in 1975's \"Where Have You Gone, Joe DiMaggio?\"\n\nBut, boy, was their rivalry grand.\n\n\"He hit me good, sure, but I got him plenty of times, too,\" Feller said. \"That's the way it worked.\"\n\nLAUNCHING BASEBALL LEGACIES\n\nBy sea and through land, Giuseppe DiMaggio and Bill Feller made their living, respectively. Through hard work and sacrifice, they provided for their families. Through duty as fathers, they shared the desire to give their sons direction.\n\nAn interest in baseball, however, wasn't shared.\n\nLike the generations before him in Sicily, Giuseppe was a fisherman. After immigrating to the United States and settling in the San Francisco Bay Area, Giuseppe hoped his five sons would continue the family trade. However, Joe, the eighth of nine children, quickly decided that wasn't the life for him.\n\nWith the encouragement of his older brother Vincent -- one of three DiMaggio boys who would become major leaguers -- 18-year-old Joe joined the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League in 1932. A season later, Joe emerged as a bona fide right-handed slugging sensation. Providing a glimpse of what was to come, Joe set the league record by reaching base safely in 61 consecutive games. After the Yankees purchased his contract in 1934, Joe hit .398 with 34 home runs and 154 RBI to lead the Seals to the PCL title while being named Most Valuable Player.\n\nUnlike the DiMaggio patriarch, Bill Feller had no desire for his young son, Bob, to take over the family farm in Van Meter, Iowa. \"Baseball is the good life,\" the elder Feller shared with his wife. Where Giuseppe DiMaggio was dismissive of a life in sport, Bill Feller did whatever he could to encourage a prosperous athletic future for his only son.\n\nBill and Bob built a baseball diamond on the farm. In the winter, they played catch inside the barn to keep the boy's right arm strong. They traveled to national tournaments as far as Ohio. By 16, the young Feller's fastball was gaining the attention of scouts. Cy Slapnicka, a fellow Iowan and future general manager of the Cleveland Indians, signed the 17-year-old Feller in 1936, and through some creative -- and controversial -- maneuvering, managed to have Feller bypass the minor leagues. Feller made his major league debut in July in a relief appearance. A month later, he started his first professional game against the St. Louis Browns at League Park. After nearly breaking the American League record with 15 strikeouts, Bill Feller's boy was now thrust onto the national stage.\n\nHowever, Feller's fast rise was due for an equally swift reality check.\n\nIn his second start, a week after his stunning debut, Feller faced the Red Sox at Fenway Park. He got off to a solid start, even striking out two-time AL MVP Jimmie Foxx in the first inning, before the Red Sox battered him for four runs and sent Feller to his first loss after five innings.\n\nDiMaggio and the Yankees were next. While Feller's rookie season was a surprising late-developing revelation, DiMaggio's first year was star-making from the beginning. Heading into his first meeting against Feller, DiMaggio was already an All-Star outfielder batting .340 with 109 RBI and was four shy of the franchise home run record with 29.\n\nFeller struck out leadoff man Frankie Crosetti. After Jack Saltzgaver legged out a single, Feller's 12-season showdown with DiMaggio officially began, rather inauspiciously. After Feller took in DiMaggio's wide stance and graceful swing. DiMaggio flew out to left.\n\nThe best part of Feller's day was over as the Yankees feasted on his inexperience. Feller walked the next three batters and committed a balk as New York scored five runs to end the rookie's day -- after one inning. The Yankees won, 6-4.\n\n\"Feller's tenure on the mound was rather brief but painful,\" read The New York Times account. \"It was his first view of the mighty Yanks, and while he lasted only one inning, at least he left with the satisfaction of seeing them all. For all nine in the batting order came up in the harrowing frame.\"\n\nA humiliated Feller agreed. \"I was lucky to get out physically unharmed,\" he said in his 1947 biography \"Strikeout Story.\"\n\nAs significant as that first meeting was, and as powerful as the lessons learned, Feller's career-long feud against the Yankees and rivalry against DiMaggio was about to take root.\n\nA FUED TAKES HOLD\n\nA season later, Feller sat in the bonesetter's office. His prized arm in pain, the 1937 campaign already in doubt.\n\nAfter his humbling debut in New York, Feller recovered to finish his rookie season in respectable fashion. He won four of his last five starts, including a record-tying 17-strikeout performance against the Philadelphia Athletics at League Park. In 14 games, Feller finished 5-3 with a 3.34 ERA and 11 strikeouts per nine innings. But trouble surfaced early in his second season. Feller injured his elbow while throwing a curveball in his first start, an 11-strikeout setback against the Browns. Concerned, the team shut down its budding star for all but two brief appearances in May and June. In July, he started -- and dropped -- two games to the Tigers, falling to 0-3.\n\nSlapnicka and Feller visited with a joint manipulator named A.L. Austin, who discovered a dislocated bone in Feller's arm. Austin made a quick twist, Feller a quick grimace, and the bone was back in place. Feller started the next day, July 18, against the Yankees at Cleveland Stadium. It was a showdown so highly anticipated, it created traffic woes the police called \"worse than ever before.\"\n\nDiMaggio's second season wasn't so tumultuous. Fresh off a World Series title, he was again an All-Star, batting .359 with 23 homers when the Yankees opened a three-game set in Cleveland.\n\nThe disaster of his previous start against the Yankees still on Feller's mind and with 58,884 fans -- including his parents and sister -- in attendance, Feller retired the first two batters. DiMaggio followed with his first hit against Feller, a triple to left-center field. But Feller promptly ended the threat, striking out reigning AL MVP Lou Gehrig. In the third, DiMaggio broke a scoreless tie with a one-run double. Entering the ninth, with the game tied 1-1, Feller was pitching his best game of the season -- until the Yankees loaded the bases for DiMaggio with no outs.\n\nDiMaggio swung and missed on two consecutive fastballs. Then with long shadows stretching across the field, catcher Frankie Pytlak called for another fastball. But Feller went against his catcher's advice and opted for a changeup. Later, DiMaggio called it \"strictly a mistake.\"\n\nDespite the change of speed, the slugger connected with the high, slow pitch. Both batter and pitcher knew the result almost instantly.\n\n\"I took one quick look over my right shoulder, then looked away,\" Feller said in 1947.\n\n\"As soon as I hit the ball, I knew it was on its way to the grandstand,\" DiMaggio told The New York Sun afterward.\n\nWith the grand slam, DiMaggio finished 3-for-5, a single short of the cycle and accounted for all the Yankees' runs in the 5-1 win. Despite going the distance, Feller dropped to 0-4 on seven hits, seven strikeouts, eight walks -- and with little respect from the opposition. Several Yankees told the press post game that Feller should be in the minors.\n\n\"There are several pitchers in the American League who have showed me more speed than Feller did today,\" DiMaggio told The New York Sun. \"Tommy Bridges of the Tigers for one. Jack Wilson of the Red Sox is another.\"\n\nAfter reading the comments, an incensed Feller threw the newspaper aside.\n\n\"If I do anything in baseball,\" Feller recalled in 1947. \"I'll make them admit they were wrong.\"\n\nFeller made good on that promise well into the 1938 season. Over his next eight appearances against the Yankees -- including a complicated 1937 no-decision contest that was ordered replayed in its entirety -- Feller went 3-2 with 56 strikeouts. Over that span, DiMaggio hit .190 (4-for-21) with only one home run. Just when it appeared Feller had found some consistency against the Yankees, the Bronx Bombers struck back on Aug. 26, 1938, at Yankee Stadium.\n\nIn the opener of a doubleheader, the Yankees handed Feller the worst game of his young career (15 runs on 15 hits in seven innings) while DiMaggio recorded one of his best against Feller (4-for-5, two doubles, a home run and seven RBI) in a 15-9 rout.\n\nThe Plain Dealer sports editor Gordon Cobbledick summed it up simply, \"Feller had nothing.\"\n\nThe New York Times seemed to savor the blowout against Feller a little more, saying he was \"battered to a pulp\" and \"it looked as though the entire arena cracked down on Feller's head\" and \"(Feller) didn't seem to know whether he was throwing left-handed or right-handed.\"\n\nFor Feller, the sting of humiliation and doubt hung on even more.\n\n\"It took years to erase the stigma of that afternoon in the Bronx,\" he said in \"Strikeout Story.\"\n\nHis games against the Yankees were never so one-sided again.\n\nTHE ELITE OF THE AMERICAN LEAGUE\n\nFrom 1939 to '41, Feller steadily matured. With his curveball developed and his control improved, he and DiMaggio were the elite of the American League.\n\nIn 1939, Feller led the majors in strikeouts for the second consecutive season with 246 and was tops in the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2). He finished third in the MVP voting behind DiMaggio, who hit a major-league best .381. In 1940, Feller started the season with his first no-hitter -- on Opening Day against the White Sox -- and finished with the AL's Triple Crown (27 wins, 2.61 ERA, 261 strikeouts). Still, he was second in the MVP voting to Detroit's Hank Greenberg. While DiMaggio, the AL's batting champ with a .352 average, was third.\n\nIn 1941, DiMaggio began a hitting streak on May 15 that would extend a record 56 games. Facing Feller on June 2 at League Park, DiMaggio increased the streak to 19 games with a single to left field in a 7-5 Cleveland win. Twelve days later, with a season-high 44,161 fans watching at Yankee Stadium and Feller riding an eight-game win streak, DiMaggio pushed his streak to 27 with a two-run double to right in the third inning of a 4-1 victory for the host. On July 17, with Feller watching from the dugout, DiMaggio's streak ended in front of 67,468 at Cleveland Stadium, a record crowd for a night game.\n\nThe next day against Feller in front of 18,000 at League Park, DiMaggio picked up two hits in the wind and drizzle, the start of another 16-game hitting streak. At season's end, DiMaggio was again crowned MVP and went on to collect his fifth World Series title. Feller, the AL's leader in wins (25) and strikeouts (260), was third in the MVP voting.\n\nIn Feller's 19 starts against the Yankees during those three seasons, he went 11-8. DiMaggio hit .358 over the same stretch, but Feller allowed only one home run to his rival.\n\nAfter the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Feller and DiMaggio interrupted their careers for service to their country and wouldn't face each other for four seasons. Feller, the first professional athlete to volunteer, served with distinction in the Navy until 1945, while DiMaggio served from 1943 to '45 with the Army.\n\nAfter six full big-league seasons and part of a seventh, the league's best hitters had come to respect the 27-year-old Feller. Boston's Ted Williams, who would finish his career as a .357 hitter against Feller, said he wouldn't sleep for days before facing the man the press dubbed Rapid Robert. As DiMaggio prepared to return to baseball, he shared similar sentiments with The New York Times in January 1946.\n\n\"I'm aiming to run over to Tampa every day to Bobby Feller's baseball school,\" he explained. \"And if I can get a chance to step up against him in batting practice, it's clear velvet. When you hit against Feller, you're hitting against the best.\"\n\nThat early look, however, wouldn't help DiMaggio -- or any other Yankee -- once the season started.\n\nSILENCING CRITICS\n\nThe whispers started before the 1946 season began.\n\nFeller doesn't have it anymore ... The war took something away ... He's not the same guy.\n\nFeller had heard the doubts before. New York writers, of course.\n\nThe criticism remained, even as Feller opened the season with a three-hit, 10-strikeout 1-0 shutout of the White Sox at Comiskey Park; or when The Sporting News declared \"Bob Feller is a better pitcher now than when he left the Cleveland Indians for the Naval Service four years ago;\" or when one of the White Sox's best hitters, Taffy Wright, told The Sporting News \"I've seen him faster but never smarter.\"\n\nSlights were even coming from the hometown Plain Dealer opinion pages. \"The baseball writers to the contrary notwithstanding, Bob Feller has slipped. This conclusion is inescapable ...\"\n\nAll the doubts were still fresh in Feller's mind when the Indians visited Yankee Stadium on April 30. Pacing himself with a potent mix of curveballs, sliders and, of course, his signature fastball, Feller dominated the Yankees. He struck out 11 and allowing only two balls out of the infield through eight hitless innings.\n\nAs the ninth inning opened, the crowd of 38,112 was growing noticeably louder in support of Feller. Even Yankees president Larry MacPhail admitted later he was -- albeit briefly -- pulling for the Tribe ace. With one out, Indians catcher Frankie Hayes broke a scoreless tie with a solo home run off Bill Bevens.\n\nIn the bottom of the frame, Feller faced Snuffy Stirnweiss, who laid a bunt down the first baseline and reached on an error. Tommy Henrich, a Massillon native, followed with a sacrifice bunt to advance the runner to second. DiMaggio, who had grounded out in the first, and flew out in the fourth and sixth, was up next. With Feller thinking the Yankees were due some luck and DiMaggio facing a 3-2 count, Feller delivered a fastball. DiMaggio grounded out to short, while advancing Stirnweiss to third. Charlie Keller followed with a groundout to second to cap Feller's second career no-hitter.\n\nAmid a raucous roar of the crowd, Feller's teammates and jubilant fans rushed onto the field. The celebration was so immense, Feller -- who became the 11th man in major league history to throw two no-hitters and the first to no-hit the Yankees since Cleveland's Ray Caldwell in 1919 -- needed a police escort off the field. In all, Feller threw 133 pitches: 54 balls, 35 strikes (17 called, 18 missed), had 29 pitches fouled off and 15 put into play.\n\nWhen reporters caught up to Feller in the Indians' joyous locker room, Feller was snarky: \"Well, I guess that proves I'm washed up. Soon as I leave here, I'll head for the nearest hospital,\" he quipped to The Plain Dealer, and testy: \"Look, when the time comes that I doubt have it, I'll be the first to know about it,\" he told The New York Times.\n\nMeanwhile, in a somber Yankees locker room, DiMaggio showed his opponent sincere respect.\n\n\"Feller was as great as he's ever been,\" DiMaggio, one of only two Yankees not to strike out, told The New York Times. \"He deserved the no-hitter.\"\n\nDiMaggio's timing was noticeably off after Feller's performance. Entering the game, he was hitting .327 with four homers in 13 games, including .500 in the previous four. Afterward, he batted .133 over the next eight games and .227 for all of May, the second-worst month of his career.\n\nThe Sporting News anointed Feller Player of the Week, saying: \"... to make the demonstration all the more convincing, he picked the Yankees, with their notorious Murderers' Row, as the guinea pigs to prove the doubting Thomas that the Feller of 1946 is just as good as the sturdy, young Iowa lad who marched off to war after Pearl Harbor. The Yankees carried a lot of useless lumber to the plate ... He was a great Feller before the war, a great Feller in the war. And he's a great Feller with the war over.\"\n\nAnd those Plain Dealer opinion writers?\n\n\"This department of the Plain Dealer is fearful that it was responsible in part, at least, for the reports afloat since the beginning of the baseball season that Pitcher Bob Feller was slipping. In the light of the show young Feller put on at the Yankee Stadium ... We apologize to any and all those who might have been offended by our unsound judgement in the Feller-is-slipping incident.\"\n\nFor the rest of 1946, Feller completed perhaps his finest season, despite finishing sixth in the MVP voting and second among AL pitchers. He led the majors in victories (26), games started (42), complete games (36), shutouts (10), innings pitched (371.1) and strikeouts (348). After the no-hitter at Yankee Stadium, Feller won his next three starts against the Yankees, including an 8-3 triumph at League Park on June 25 that featured the best Feller-DiMaggio matchup since 1939. While Feller whiffed 13 -- his 10th double-digit strikeout game of the season -- DiMaggio batted 4-for-5, with a two-run homer.\n\n\"The Yankees seemed overcome with the Bob Feller jitters ... Only Joe DiMaggio seemed of a mind that Feller was not altogether invincible,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nWhile Feller showed himself to be near-invincible that season, DiMaggio would get his chance again soon enough.\n\nBUILDUP TO A SHOWDOWN\n\nEntering the 1948 season, Feller and DiMaggio were at the peak of their athletic prowess.\n\nIn Feller's sixth All-Star campaign in 1947, he led the American League with 20 victories, five shutouts, 196 strikeouts and 5.9 strikeouts-per-nine innings while racking up 299 innings. His 2.68 ERA was second in the league. He threw two more one-hitters, increasing his career total to 10.\n\nAnd he held a winning record against every team in the American League, including a 20-18 advantage over the Yankees. Before the season began, a new bonus-laden contract ensured Feller's place among the highest-paid players in the game.\n\nAfter an un-DiMaggio-like 1946 in which the Yankee Clipper hit a career-low .290, he began living up to his legacy once again. The Yankees won their 11th World Series title in 1947 and DiMaggio was named MVP for the third time. Feller was eighth.\n\nBut over the first month of the 1948 season, both players were facing questions.\n\nFeller started strong again, opening with a dominating two-hit shutout of the Browns in front of 73,163 at Cleveland Stadium. He followed up with another complete game in a 4-1 victory at Detroit four days later. Two days after that, Feller earned a save in a 14-inning victory over the White Sox.\n\nBut when the calendar flipped to May, Feller dropped two decisions in which he didn't last beyond five innings in either game. He had yet to strike out more than six in a game. National sportswriters -- unaware of Feller's personal turmoil that wouldn't be made public for weeks -- began to once again question the dominance of his fastball and durability. Bill Corum of The New York Journal American wrote a piece -- later picked up by The Sporting News with the headline \"Indian Ace Favoring Trick Stuff Over Fast Ball - and it's backfiring\" -- reporting opposing teams were speculating if \"the Iowa farm boy is selling his birthright for a mess of potage in the form of trick stuff that he may think is good.\"\n\nFeller, who had just gone 9.1 innings in a win at Boston, was livid about Corum's accusation. Upon arriving in New York on May 11, he vowed to reporters to find the writer who reportedly had never seen the pitcher play.\n\n\"I'll get him before I leave town and I'll really get him told off,\" Feller.\n\nFeller responded to the fresh jabs with two more complete-game victories over the White Sox and Athletes, giving up just one earned run in each. After seven starts, he was 5-2.\n\nDiMaggio was trying to find a rhythm, too. When the Yankees boarded the train in mid-May for their first western trip of the season, DiMaggio was hitting .268 with four home runs in 21 games.\n\nOn May 20, fortunes appeared to change for both men. Hours after picking up his third consecutive victory, Feller was called away from the Indians to return home to Illinois to tend to a personal matter. Feller wouldn't record a win for another month. Meanwhile, DiMaggio busted out for his biggest game of the season, batting 5-for-6 with two homers runs and six RBI in a 13-2 win at the White Sox.\n\nThree days later, the Indians sat atop the AL standings at 17-7. The Yankees were two games back at 16-10. When the Yankees pulled into Cleveland for a doubleheader, the table was set for perhaps the biggest baseball spectacle the city had ever seen.\n\nA RECORD DAY\n\nWith such a dream baseball scenario unfolding, Bill Veeck saw opportunity -- and dollar signs.\n\nFor the twinbill against the Yankees, the Indians new and ambitious young president envisioned a record-setting day. His talented club, the defending world champs, cavernous Cleveland Stadium, Feller, DiMaggio ... easy sell.\n\nTo Veeck, surpassing Major League Baseball's largest paid crowd -- 81,841 for the Red Sox's visit to Yankee Stadium on May 30, 1938 -- wasn't so far-fetched of an idea. As the game approached, Veeck and his staff appeared to be nearing the goal. All 57,000 reserved seats were sold two days before the game. A promotion directed at kids -- sketchbook, replica sleeve patch and a game ticket for $1 -- netted another 1,000.\n\nBut with Veeck stuck in his hospital bed at the Cleveland Clinic -- temporarily, at least -- recovering from the 14th surgery on his amputated right leg, his marketing handiwork unfolded unseen across town. As a chilly, windy dawn arrived under cloudy skies, a couple dozen eager fans stood in line at the stadium box office. By 8:30 a.m., there were more than 500 milling about. By noon, all 15,000 unreserved seats had been sold. Approximately 6,000 standing-room only tickets went quickly, too, until the fire department put a stop to their sale an hour before game time. Inside the stadium, concessionaires strained to meet demand. By the time the day was over, fans consumed an estimated five tons of hot dogs and 50,000 boxes of popcorn.\n\nIt wasn't just a local affair either. An estimated 40,000 arrived from out of town. Nearly 100 buses dotted the parking lot and special trains arrived from Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Dayton and Youngstown. The Joe DiMaggio Fan Club of Pittsburgh raised their banner in homage to the allure of the Joltin' Joe.\n\nWhen it started raining, the crowd of 78,431 -- short of the major league mark, but the largest ever to pay to witness a baseball game in the city's history -- watched the tarp roll out and waited undeterred.\n\n\"These (fans) were not to be denied their baseball by inclement weather,\" The Plain Dealer reported.\n\nAn hour before the game, DiMaggio sat in the dugout, watching the steady rain and taking comfort that he'd shaken off his slump. For the first five games of the road trip, he hit .350 with three homers and 10 RBI.\n\n\"My arm feels good, my heel hasn't bothered me and best of all, I started to hit last week,\" he shared with The Plain Dealer.\n\nAfter a 30-minute delay, the rain slowed and the tarp was pulled off. Feller warmed up, but felt off. Still, Feller quickly retired the Yankees' Bobby Brown, Henrich and Charlie Keller in order to open the game. In the bottom of the inning, Feller got plenty of help as the Indians pounced on New York starter Allie Reynolds. Joe Gordon gave the Tribe a 1-0 lead with a single to center field before third baseman Ken Keltner smacked a two-out, three-run home run -- his AL-leading 13th -- to make it 4-0.\n\nDiMaggio opened the second with a single, but Feller kept the rest of the Yankees hitless through three innings. With Veeck now present in the pressbox -- telling reporters he had \"escaped\" the hospital -- he watched the visitors rally. In the fourth, Feller walked Henrich and Keller flew out. DiMaggio followed, and took Feller's high and inside fastball deep into the lower left-field stands.\n\nStill 4-2 Indians in the sixth, with one out and Henrich and Keller aboard, Feller delivered another fastball to DiMaggio, this one low and away. DiMaggio launched a shot to left, an estimated 465 feet from home plate.\n\n\"Gee, I didn't realize I hit it that hard,\" DiMaggio told The Plain Dealer afterward. \"That would be the longest ball I ever hit in the majors. I had one over 475 in an exhibition game, but that wasn't against Feller.\"\n\nIt was only the second home run Feller had given up that season, and only the fifth time an opponent had hit two home runs against him in a game. The Indians were now trailing, 5-4, and Feller pitched through the seventh. After giving up seven hits while striking out three against two walks, Feller was relieved by Bob Muncrief. The veteran right-hander, in his first season in Cleveland, got Keller to open the eighth with a groundout, before DiMaggio stepped to the plate. Muncrief had no better luck with him. DiMaggio sent a shot over the outstretched glove of left fielder Dale Mitchell, his third homer in three consecutive at-bats, to give the Yankees a 6-4 lead. New York won. 6-5, but the final tally seemed insignificant to DiMaggio's second career three-homer game and first in 11 years.\n\n\"This is without parallel in the history of such an achievement,\" declared The Sporting News of the 11-year gap.\n\nJim Schlemmer of The Akron Beacon Journal wrote: \"The fact that two of Joe's four-masters were made off Bob Feller only adds to their luster ... DiMaggio and Feller, each in his own field, is the greatest there is in this business.\"\n\nIn the Yankees' locker room between games, jubilant teammates congratulated a visibly modest DiMaggio. Some overzealous fans wanted to congratulate the slugger, too, and nearly broke down the dressing room door before police intervened.\n\n\"You have good days and bad days,\" DiMaggio told reporters. \"I just had a good one.\"\n\nFeller, to his own admission, did not.\n\n\"DiMaggio is always tough for me,\" he said. \"But today I didn't have any stuff. I could feel it when I was warming up and I was lucky to get by as long as I did.\"\n\nFor the rest of the season, Feller was erratic, rarely appearing to be the dominant fireballer of the past. National sportwriters were predictably critical, even mean-spirited. \"Bulletless Bob,\" a UPI story called him. Virginia Feller, Bob's wife, tried to provide some insight to the International News Service. She was having trouble recuperating from the birth of their second child, she explained. Her husband's mind was elsewhere as he was called away from the team multiple times.\n\n\"No wonder he's been upset,\" she said. \"It's really my fault.\"\n\nAfter his three-homer outburst at Cleveland Stadium, DiMaggio smacked Feller for two more home runs in 1948 -- including a grand slam -- and finished the season hitting a career-best .450 (9-for-20) against the right-hander. After a season of struggle, Feller found a consistent rhythm in September that helped propel the Tribe to their first World Series title since 1920. Like DiMaggio, Feller was now a champion.\n\nON FINAL SHOWDOWN\n\nMatchups between the two stars weren't as dramatic after that.\n\nIndividually, they continued to pile up Cooperstown qualifications. DiMaggio, who added two more World Series crowns in 1949 and 1950, socked three home runs in a game for the third time in his career on Sept. 10, 1950, against the Washington Senators at Griffith Park. Feller, experiencing a resurgent 1951 season, achieved his third career no-hitter against the Tigers on July 1 at Cleveland Stadium.\n\nOver the next nine games between the pair in 1949 to '51, DiMaggio batted .250 (7-for-28) with two home runs. New stars like Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle were emerging in the Bronx, and the exploits of a Feller vs. DiMaggio showdown weren't as big as they once were.\n\nThat is, until one final meeting on Sept. 16, 1951, at Yankee Stadium.\n\nWhile Feller was enjoying his comeback year that included a 2-2 record against the Yankees, DiMaggio showed all the signs of a player pondering retirement. The 37-year-old DiMaggio was hitting .263 with 11 home runs as the Yankees sat a game behind the AL-leading Indians.\n\nWith his team's postseason fortunes in the balance and the largest single-game crowd of the season -- 68,760 -- filing into the ballpark, New York manager Casey Stengel made a bold choice. For the first time that season, he moved a displeased DiMaggio to the No. 5 spot, moving Berra up to bat cleanup.\n\nThe switch paid off quickly. In the first inning, Berra faced Feller and promptly gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead with a two-out triple to left. DiMaggio, who was 2-for-5 in his two meetings against Feller for the season, grounded out to end the inning. In the fifth, with the Yankees leading 3-1, Mantle opened with a bunt single and advanced to second on Joe Collins' sacrifice bunt. After Gil McDougald lined out to left for the second out, Indians manager Al Lopez instructed Feller to intentionally walk Berra so he would pitch to DiMaggio. The move backfired. Just as he had in for his first hit against Feller in 1937, DiMaggio tripled. This one soared to the far corner in left-center to empty the bases and give the Yankees an insurmountable 5-1 lead. The crowd erupted for the Yankee Clipper.\n\n\"I guess I would have done the same thing,\" said DiMaggio of Lopez's decision afterward. \"Who knows, though? Maybe Yogi would have hit the ball in the seats.\"\n\nAfter walking Gene Woodling, an Akron native and Feller's one-time Indians teammate, Feller exited. The Yankees won, 5-1, moved into first place in the AL by way of percentage points and clinched the pennant two days later when Reynolds no-hit the White Sox.\n\nGOLDEN YEARS AFTER GOLDEN CAREERS\n\nAfter winning his ninth World Series title in 1951, DiMaggio retired. In 58 games, he faced Feller more than any other pitcher in his career with 217 plate appearances and 193 at-bats. His .342 career average against Feller ranked third against pitchers he faced at least 100 times. Against Feller, DiMaggio collected the most hits (66), doubles (11, tied with Bobo Newsom), triples (7), home runs (11), RBI (46) and walks (23). But while DiMaggio wasn't prone to striking out (369 over his career), no one got him more than Feller, who struck him out 12 times.\n\nA career .325 hitter with 361 home runs and 1,537 RBI, the three-time MVP entered the Hall of Fame in 1955. His three three-home-run games -- including that day against Feller in 1947 -- were among the accomplishments emblazoned on his plaque.\n\nFeller hung around the big leagues a few more years after DiMaggio left, helped the Indians win the pennant again in 1954 and retired two years later after 266 victories, 2,581 strikeouts and 3.25 ERA. His turn in Cooperstown arrived in 1962. Feller's plaque listed the three no-hitters, including the gem against DiMaggio's Yankees in 1946.\n\nAfter his career was complete, DiMaggio revealed pitchers armed with sinkerballs -- such as the Indians' Mel Harder and Bob Lemon -- were tougher at-bats for him. However, despite his success against Feller, DiMaggio's respect never wavered far from a sentiment he expressed years earlier until his death in 1999, \"I don't think it will hurt anybody's feelings when I say Feller is the greatest natural pitcher I ever saw.\"\n\nFor Feller -- and just about everyone else -- Williams was the greatest hitter he ever faced. Even Williams' Red Sox teammate Bobby Doerr and the Yankees' Henrich were tough showdowns. Still, DiMaggio stood apart.\n\n\"He's a great ball player,\" Feller said of DiMaggio in 1957, \"the best all-around ball player I ever played against.\"\n\nAs old ballplayers tend to do, the former rivals seemed to gravitate toward each other in their later years. Autograph signings, old-timers games and charity functions brought them together. Shared moments of great games and grander careers bonded them for life. And a few years before his death in 2010, Feller paid tribute to that kinship.\n\n\"I considered my friendship with Joe to be something special,\" he said.\n\nPROJECT SOURCES\n\n\"Where Have You Gone, Joe DiMaggio: The Story of America's Last Hero\" by Maury Allen; \"Strikeout Story,\" by Bob Feller; \"Lucky To Be a Yankee,\" by Joe DiMaggio; \"Bob Feller's Little Black Book of Baseball Wisdom\" with Burton Rocks; \"Now Pitching: Bob Feller\" with Bill Gilbert; The Cleveland Plain Dealer; The New York Times; The New York Sun; Akron Beacon Journal; The Sporting News; The Associated Press; \"The Mike Wallace Interview (Aug. 4, 1957);\" Sports Reference, LLC (baseball-reference.com); baseballalmanac.com."
