        "text": "Joe DiMaggio played his last game on Oct. 10, 1951.\n\nWilliam Earl \"Bill\" Essick, the Yankees' West Coast scout who signed Joe DiMaggio, died in his sleep two days later at the age of 69 as a result of a heart ailment. One can romanticize the events, but they were merely coincidental.\n\nEssick was known as \"Vinegar Bill\" because he hated to lose so much. It was not unusual for him not to say anything for hours after a loss.\n\nVinegar Bill had not been a very good player, but he was an excellent judge of baseball talent.\n\nAlmost every team was after Joe DiMaggio, but when he hurt his knee, they lost interest.\n\nBill Essick was not convinced and persuaded the Yankees to purchase DiMaggio's contract for $25,000. The rest is history.\n\nAfter the Yankees won the 1951 World Series, Joe DiMaggio told reporters that he had played his last game.\n\n\"I have made up my mind to retire and that is my present intention. I have given it considerable thought.\"\n\nWhen referring to Joe DiMaggio, baseball writers usually described him as \"baseball's greatest star since Babe Ruth.\"\n\nYankees' manager Casey Stengel, who didn't get along with Joe, respected his ability.\n\n\"The day DiMaggio quits, part of the Yankees will be gone, too. In a sense, Joe was the Yankees, just as Babe Ruth was before him.\"\n\nGil McDougald, who had just completed his first season and would win the American League Rookie of the Year Award, was disappointed. McDougald, like most other players, was always in awe of DiMaggio.\n\n\"I wish I could tell DiMaggio just how I feel about playing on the same team with him. Just knowing that he may be watching me makes me try all the harder to do good. I still find it hard to believe that I am on the same team with him.\n\nJoe DiMaggio announced his retirement in December 1951.\n\nJoe DiMaggio was the heart of the Yankees and the greatest center fielder to play the game. He was a money player with few equals who rarely faltered when the chips were down.\n\nIt didn't matter what he had to do. It could be a big hit, a great catch, or a critical throw.\n\nDiMaggio's only flaw was that he rarely made a difficult play because he rarely made a play look difficult.\n\nThere wasn't a player with a better, stronger, or more accurate throwing arm than DiMaggio's when Joe was in his prime.\n\nRunners refused to challenge him, and the season that he suffered from a sore arm, he said that he would make one hard throw a game.\n\n\"It was the only throw I had in my system. Once I let go, I was through for the day.\"\n\nJoe DiMaggio was a natural baseball player who relied on his instincts. Unlike Ted Williams, DiMaggio couldn't break down hitting or fielding into component parts to analyze them.\n\nAs another great center fielder said, \"They throw the ball, I hit it. They hit the ball, I catch it.\"\n\nOnly Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Tris Speaker were considered greater outfielders than DiMaggio when he retired.\n\nBy refusing to play in 1952, Joe DiMaggio turned his back on $100,000, which was the most any player had ever made in a season.\n\nNew York Times columnist Arthur Daley expressed it succinctly.\n\n\"Only a man with character and overwhelming pride could take a step like that. The Yankee Clipper has always been a proud man. That's why he was such a great ball player. He was never satisfied with anything less than perfection.\"\n\nReferences"
