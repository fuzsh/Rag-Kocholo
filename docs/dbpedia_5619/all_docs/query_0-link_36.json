        "text": "One of the most famous records in sports is Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak, but few remember that his younger brother Dom still owns the Red Sox’ team record of 34. Nicknamed the Little Professor, Dom, who died last Friday, scorched the ball throughout the summer of 1949 as his Red Sox and Joe’s Yankees mounted what might have been their most exciting race for the American League pennant. As told to Alan Schwarz in 2006 for the book “Once Upon a Game: Baseball’s Greatest Memories.”\n\nA lot of people make a big deal about my 34-game hitting streak in the summer of 1949, and how it was snapped on a great play in center field by my brother Joe. I’d like to set the record straight.\n\nFirst of all, when I hit in 34 games in a row, I was only doing my job. I played every game pretty much as I played any other game. I got my fair share of walks during the streak  I don’t think I chased bad pitches. I was a line-drive hitter. My job was to get on base and let the sluggers like Ted Williams drive me home. I wasn’t even aware of my streak until it was at 22 or 23 games, and I didn’t make a big deal of it.\n\nOn the day it ended, Aug. 9, we were playing the Yankees at Fenway Park. Our rivalry with the Yankees was great  every bit as emotional as it is now. The atmosphere was very thick whether we played at Fenway Park or Yankee Stadium. That afternoon we were in third place, six games behind the first-place Yankees, but playing great. We were just entering the pennant race. These were big games.\n\nBut when you feel pressure, you do not perform. The first thing you’ve got to do is be completely relaxed. And that’s the way I was. On that day against the Yankees, I felt good. I hit one solid shot to the third baseman that was turned into an out. I got out another couple of times. I was 0 for 4 when I got to the plate in the eighth inning against Vic Raschi, who was a darn good pitcher.\n\nI smacked a line drive right up the middle so hard that it passed Raschi’s ear! He ducked to get out of the way of it! As soon as I hit it, I said, “O.K., that’s 35.” But that ball wouldn’t drop. The ball refused to drop. Joe is standing out there in center field, and he didn’t have to move. He said it himself later  if he hadn’t caught the ball, it would have hit him right between the eyes. So there was no effort on his part. It wasn’t a great play by him, like they’re still saying today. I just hit the ball too damn hard!\n\nBut the streak was over, and I didn’t mind that much. (After all, we’d won the game, 6-3.) And hitting streaks didn’t matter to me, even when I hit in another 27 straight in 1951. It’s just a statistic. And the only statistic that really matters to me is hitting .300. I did it four times in my 10 full seasons in the major leagues, and finished with a .298 average lifetime. My only regret is not hitting .300.\n\nIt would have meant so much. Enos Slaughter hit exactly .300 in his career  and he’s in the Hall of Fame. Why? Did he hustle any more than I did? Did he have a better arm than I did? Did he run the bases any better than I did? Did he play defense as well as I did? Who knows? All I needed was 12 more hits  only about one per season  and I would have had a .300 average."
