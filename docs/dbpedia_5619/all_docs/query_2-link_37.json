        "text": "Lefty Gomez and Joe DiMaggio were born almost exactly six years apart; Gomez on November 26, 1908, and DiMaggio on November 25, 1914. They came from two very different backgrounds, but they both loved baseball. They were roommates turned best friends and both a part some of the most dominant years of the New York Yankees franchise. Combined, they played 27 seasons in the MLB, have 20 All-Star appearances, 14 World Series titles, and hold records that put them in a league of their own.\n\nVernon “Lefty” Gomez spent all but one game of his 14 year MLB career pitching for the New York Yankees. During this time, he was a 7x All-Sar, 5x World Series Champion, 3x AL Strikeout leader, and 2x Triple Crown winner. Along his Hall of Fame resume, Gomez was known for his outgoing personality, self deprecating humor, and wit.\n\nGomez’s signature was his high leg kick and blazing fastball. He won 20 or more games in four separate seasons and held his opponents to a .242 batting average during the heavy hitting 1930s. Lefty’s best season was 1934 where he won 26 games and only lost 5. He also led the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts, which earned him the Triple Crown. His .649 winning percentage ranks 15th in major league history among pitchers with 200 or more decisions. Lefty’s ultimate claim to fame are his six World Series game wins without a loss. No other pitcher comes close to touching this record, and it is one that might stand forever.\n\nLefty was also famous for some of his quotes. In one, he jokingly credited himself for Joe DiMaggio’s emergence in the MLB. He claimed that it was on his batted balls that Joe DiMaggio mades some of his most outstanding plays and was able to show of his outstanding fielding ability out in center. Lefty liked to say, “I’m the guy that made Joe DiMaggio famous.”\n\nJoe DiMaggio would have become one of the greatest players in MLB history with or without Lefty’s help. However, it was Lefty’s friendship and guidance that helped pull Joe out of his shell when he first arrived in New York. When DiMaggio first came up to the majors he was a quiet and shy kid from San Francisco. He was assigned to room with Gomez when the team went on the road and back then he even said that, “In those day, Lefty was the only guy who could make me laugh.”\n\nJoe DiMaggio wasn’t just a baseball legend, he was a cultural icon. He gained fame outside of baseball from his marriage to Hollywood stars Marilyn Monroe and Dorothy Arnold. His celebrity grew further after his career ended thanks to the Simon and Garfunkel song, Mrs. Robinson, and later as he became the spokesperson for the brand Mr. Coffee.\n\nDuring his career, DiMaggio was most well known for his MLB record setting 56 game hit streak. He was also aa 3x AL MVP, 13x All — Star, and 9x World Series champion. He played 13 years in the MLB, all for the New York Yankees. DiMaggio gained even more favor as an American hero when he took 3 years off from baseball during his prime to serve in the military.\n\nOn the field, DiMaggio could do it all. He hit for a .325 lifetime average with 361 career home runs, and earned the nickname The Yankee Clipper for the way he expertly patrolled center field. His teammates admired him for the way he practiced and prepared for each game. The fans adored him for the way he would give 110% in every game, no matter the importance. Mickey Mantel, Ted Williams, and other legends praise him as well, saying he was one of the best that they had ever seen play the game.\n\nDiMaggio’s most impressive feat was his 56 game hitting streak during the 1941 season. This is referred to by many as the most unbreakable record in sports.\n\nDespite the similarities between Joe DiMaggio and Lefty Gomez, they are remembered in very different ways.\n\nGomez is one of the best known and one of the least known stars in baseball history. He played in an era where he was overshadowed by the other large personalities on the New York Yankees such as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Surprisingly to many, Lefty was not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame until 1972 when he was a unanimous selection of the Veteran’s Committee. When notified, Lefty replied with his usual jokes, “It’s only fair. After all, I helped a lot of hitters get in.” Joe DiMaggio on the other hand, is one of the best known Yankee superstars of all time. His number five was retired by the Yankees in 1952 and the team even created a monument for him; at the time it was the fifth ever dedicated to a Yankee player. He was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1955 with 88.8% of the vote.\n\nWhen given the opportunity, I had to purchase this autographed photo of the two of them. This picture represents two Yankee legends, an iconic friendship, and two very different legacies.\n\nThese two Yankee legends celebrated their birthdays on consecutive days. So here’s a happy birthday to two baseball treasures, Joe DiMaggio and Lefty Gomez!!\n\n#JoinTheHunt and find more baseball treasures here —\n\nBaseball Treasure\n\nRiley Poole\n\nBaseball Treasure\n\nRiley Poole\n\nBaseball Treasure"
