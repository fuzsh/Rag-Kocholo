        "text": "Unless they know something about the history of the game, many younger folks would simply think Joe DiMaggio was the Mr. Coffee guy. But to more than a generation of Yankee fans, he was one of the best that ever wore the pinstripes. Players like that are few and far between in todayâ€™s game. His type of player would be a dinosaur.\n\nHe struck out only 369 times in his entire 13-year career. Some players accomplish that in 2 seasons. A career .325 hitter, graceful in the field, and he wanted to beat you every time he walked onto the field. He lost 3 seasons to the war, and he only batted under .300 twice, 1946, the year he came back from the war, and his last season, 1951.\n\nThe only thing DiMaggio did not do well was stealing bases. He stole 30 in his career. The Yankee Clipper was all class. Some of the younger talents in the league could learn a lesson in baseball etiquette from Joe. I know society is a lot different now, but sometimes I think there are players in the majors who just do not respect the game. There is way more showboating in the game today, the bat flips, beating oneâ€™s chest, all the different handshakes and high fives â€¦ and standing there and admiring a HR that travels a long way.\n\nPlayers do not just drop their heads and run the bases. There always seems to be some sort of celebration. As good as Ricky Henderson was, I had a hard time liking the guy. He was one of the most self-promoting players I have ever seen. LeBron is the same way. The unwritten rules get ignored a lot. Not embarrassing the opposition is on that list, but you see it all the time.\n\nI was too young to see DiMaggio, but I watched Koufax most of his career. Sandy was another player who had a lot of class. Sandy would never think of hitting a player on purpose, conversely, Big D would hit anyone he felt was digging in on him, and taking away the inside of the plate. And woe be unto those who plunked a Dodger player. Drysdale would send a laser their way without batting an eye.\n\nI also think if one is doing something that might bring embarrassment or bad publicity to the organization, then usually, one is thinking about themselves and not the consequences that come with those kinds of behaviors. Back in the early â€™50s, the Yankees had some players who were heavy party animals, among them Mantle and Martin. The Yankees ended up trading Martin because they felt he was a negative influence on Mickey. But in later years, tales of their nightly escapades became known, and it tarnished some reputations.\n\nWhitey Ford was in that bunch too, and to look at him, it would be hard to believe. Whitey just always looked so respectable. Then you have players like Justin Turner and Clayton Kershaw. Both are active in the community, both have foundations that benefit the less fortunate. Kershaw has made several trips to Africa with his wife for various charitable reasons. Those kinds of activities get less press than they should. Oh, we know about Kershâ€™s and JTâ€™s because events they hold get advertised on the Dodger broadcasts.\n\nKershâ€™s ping pong tournament gets a lot of hype. The Dodgers, for the most part, are pretty good at handling the negative press. When the Ramirez PED case broke, they were right on top of it. There have been other fires that needed to be put out over the years. Most were handled well. But you would never expect anything like that from Joe D. The closest thing he came to any kind of negative press was when his marriage to Marylyn Monroe broke up in less than a year.\n\nBut Joe, like many a talented person, had an ego that needed to be stroked. He insisted on being introduced as The Greatest Living New York Yankee. Mantle, notwithstanding, he probably was. He would probably marvel at how far some of these players can hit a baseball. And he would be impressed with their fielding skills. But the antics and showboating he would not like at all.\n\nBut more now than ever, baseball is entertainment. Baseball now is big business, and it needs a product that is appealing to todayâ€™s fans. The bigger-than-life players are not all that abundant. But when amazing talents come along, baseball markets them to the hilt. Tatis, Guerrero, Ohtani, are 3 of the most recognizable names in the game, and all of them are kids. Ohtani is the old man of the group, he turns 27 on Monday.\n\nThere are others of course, but those 3, well they stand out the most. Ohtani and Guerrero are in the middle of a great HR race. Ohtani added 2 more today, and now has 30 before the All-Star game, which made that much more amazing since he also is a starting pitcher.\n\nI guess I am just getting old because I really have days when I miss the way the game was badly. Those really close pitchers duels between Marichal and Koufax, or Gibson and Big D. These Dodgers sometimes score more in a game than it seemed like the 60â€™s Dodgers scored in a week. Not really, but it seemed that way. I remember a story about Drysdaleâ€™s reaction when told Koufax had thrown a no-hitter. Big Dâ€™s first response was did he win?\n\nBut the game has changed, and I guess I should be more tolerant in my old age. There are posters on here who are older than I. And I respect their views a lot. But sometimes I close my eyes and I see DiMaggio gliding across the Yankee Stadium outfield to flag down a drive no one thinks he will catch. Or I even see the great Willie Mays, who I saw play several times, racing back in the Polo Grounds to catch Wertzâ€™s drive in the series. And I think to myself, no matter how hard some of these players try, they will never be that graceful making a play."
