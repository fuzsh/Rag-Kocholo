        "text": "When you think about it, there are really two Negro Leagues defensive spectrums, one for lefties and one for righties (as is true for MLB as well).\n\nLEFT CF 1B RF LF RIGHT C SS 3B CF 1B 2B RF LF\n\nBecause the best athletes migrated to the skill positions, and because Negro Leagues teams typically carried about 13 players, and because several of those players had to be pitchers, and because a team’s utility players and relievers might need to be used in any given game, right and left field were often occupied by lesser players, utility men, and, yep, good-hitting pitchers. So the paucity of excellent corner outfielders is counterbalanced by a team’s outfield anchor, its centerfielder. Here then are some of the greats of centerfield.\n\nCool Papa Bell’s MLEs make him out as the ultimate low-and-long candidate. Twenty-eight peak WAR and fifty-nine career. Really, it’s not the kind of profile that we have ever seen in MLB. Johnny Damon comes the closest at 33 peak and 57 career. Damon actually presents a pretty good comp: Meh-fielding, loooooong-career centerfielder with great speed and some batting value. Actually Bell (221 batting runs) way outhit Damon (93). Everything else skews toward Damon, however. Our baserunning estimate gives Damon a 40-run advantage. If we ran up a DP estimate for Bell, it would come out at around 10 runs; Damon racked up 49 DP runs. Finally, Damon’s fielding value tops Bell’s by about 22 runs. So 128 runs to the Bell side for batting but 101 to the Damon side for everything else. Anyway, unless there’s some additional fielding value that we don’t yet have for Bell, I’d put Cool Papa very close to but below Damon. The latter ranks 31st, so figure Bell slots in somewhere in the thirties.\n\nFor those into war credit, Willard Brown might prove interesting. He’s got 35 peak WAR and 59 career, which would put him just ahead of Earl Averill (39 peak, 51 career) who is 28th and just behind Chet Lemon (38 peak, 56 career). But if we consider some kind of credit sequence for Brown, things get more interesting. El Hombre missed two full years due to the war. When he returned, he was thirty-one, and he declined into a three-win player before tailing off for good. For the moment, say Brown was an average player for those two missed years. That would put him at 35 peak and 63 WAR, which isn’t that far off from Jim O’Rourke (32 peak, 67 career) or Max Carey (37 peak, 61 career) or Willie Davis (38 peak, 63 career). If instead, we’re talking two years at 3.0 WAR, Brown becomes a 35 peak, 65 WAR player, which clearly pushes him past O’Rourke and probably gets him past Willie Davis. Lastly, imagine adding two 4.0 WAR seasons, boosting him to 35 peak, 67 career. That’s basically Jake Beckley’s career, though he’s a first baseman. I don’t think that would get him anywhere beyond Davis because the next guy, Jimmy Wynn, would have a big enough peak advantage (10 wins) to hold him off. So this all means that depending on the scenario, Brown could rank as high as 17th and as low as 28th.\n\nNow we arrive at another contender for the Negro League GOAT, Oscar Charleston. He could flat out hit (554 batting runs), he could really run (32 runs on the bases), and he could go get it in centerfield (29 fielding runs). His peak value of 58 wins (which includes 1918 and 1919 adjusted upward from the truncated World War I schedules) and career value of 104 WAR put him right in the running with Pop Lloyd, Devil Wells, and Josh Gibson. His peak includes an 11.6 and a 9.5 WAR season. Centerfielders in MLB history with numbers near his? None, exactly. Joltin’ Joe DiMaggio ranks fifth with 56 peak WAR and 83 career, both of which Charleston surpasses. In fourth place, there’s Mickey Mantle whose 66 peak WAR and 113 career both exceed Charleston by a comfortable margin. So I’m left to think that the only place Oscar could go is the number-five slot. Is there anything left in the statistical ether that could boost him up a little? Well, possibly. If there’s any missing fielding data, and it’s strong, then he might catch a few more runs. I doubt, however, that it’s enough to get his peak to 60 WAR, let alone the mid-sixties.\n\nThe Negro Leagues’ on-the-field renaissance man was Martín Dihigo. He truly did it all and played everywhere on the diamond (well, he didn’t play catcher). We estimate him at more than 400 batting runs, with a little speed (15 runs on the bases) plus 110 fielding runs for centerfield, right field, and first base. Although he played everywhere, we placed him at what we perceived as his most likely positions based on where he played in the Negro Leagues, how athletic he was, and other attributes. All this earns him 40 peak WAR and 89 career WAR. This is another case of the peak-suppressive effects of the MLE routine. No player with that many wins for his career has a peak that low. So Dihigo’s peak is assuredly closer to 50 or more WAR. We’ve mentioned Joe DiMaggio (56 peak, 83 career) above, and he’s the number five centerfield. Mike Trout is sixth then at seventh there’s Ken Griffey, Jr. (53 peak, 81 career) and Richie Ashburn at eighth (50 peak, 79 career). So my guess is that he could fall anywhere between fifth and ninth.\n\nFor Larry Doby, it might seem as though the question is how many years do you want to give him? He first appeared in the Negro Leagues at age 18, which we have estimated at 150 plate appearances. At age 19, we reckon 310 PAs. For his age-twenty season, 1944, Doby went to war, but not until he’d notched twenty PAs. Then he spent all of 1945 in the military. There’s no doubt that Doby’s age-twenty-two season, 1946, is the latest season we could start with. If we start with that, he has 43 peak WAR and 63 career. This probably puts him in the region of Duke Snider (46 peak, 61 career), Paul Hines (39 peak, 67 career), and Kenny Lofton (40 peak, 66 career), which means 13th to 15th. The highest he could rank? Well, if you give him credit for all his seasons, he’d have 66 career WAR, and that wouldn’t change a thing.\n\nPete Hill, the great early centerfielder and contemporary of Pop Lloyd, earned 36 peak WAR and 72 career wins. This turns out to be the career-candidate version of Larry Doby. Their respective peaks and careers basically return the same CHEWS+ value, around 112. Which means that, like Doby, I’d expect him to rank 13th to 15th.\n\nOne might wonder why we place Monte Irvin among centerfielders. Once again, this is an educated guess. Irvin started out as a shortstop, played some centerfield, and in the majors played a vast majority of the time in leftfield. Shouldn’t he be a leftfielder? We strongly suspect that Irvin could still have played centerfield in the majors, but Willie Mays was in his way in the early 1950s, and Irvin had a couple of leg injuries. Despite that he was an outstanding +41 fielding leftfielder. While we keep him at his actual major league position for those seasons, prior to that, given all we know, he seems like a centerfielder to us. He peaks at 44 WAR and ends up with 62 career WAR. That’s with two and four-fifths seasons missing due to the second world war. So first let’s take the no-war-credit scenario. Irvin’s peak and career align nicely with Jimmy Wynn’s 45-WAR peak and 58-WAR career, so we can easily say that makes Irvin the 15th, 16th, or 17th best centerfielder in history. Let’s add some war credit. I suspect the maximum I’d be comfortable with would be around 4.0 per year. That bumps him up to 72 career WAR, real close to Carlos Beltran (45 peak, 70 WAR) and Jim Edmonds (45 peak, 68 career). That puts him around 10th, 11th, or 12th in my centerfield rankings.\n\nA contemporary of Irvin’s, Sam Jethroe, could really burn. We’re estimating more than 60 running runs for him, which in combination with 144 batting runs plus a little bit of value in DP avoidance and fielding nabs him 33 peak WAR and 57 career. As with Bell, that’s a great match for Johnny Damon’s 33 peak WAR and 57 career, which would place Jethroe around 29th to 33rd. But the Negro Leagues are sometimes strange, and you’d think a big star like Jethroe would be quick out of the gates. Nope. He didn’t make a major Negro Leagues team until twenty-five. Well, except that he made a very brief appearance, according to Jim Riley in 1938 at the age of 21 with the Indianapolis ABCs as, get ready for it, a catcher. It then took him another four years to catch on as a centerfielder despite his lightning speed. In circumstances more apt for efficient player development, he would almost sure have played centerfield from the start. If we want to imagine him into more playing time, we could give him, say, 3.0 wins a year for those missing four years. Those 12 wins would bring him up to 69 total, which would look a little better than peakless wonder Jim O’Rourke (32 peak, 67 career). That’s probably Jethroe’s ceiling if everything had gone right.\n\nAlthough the Hall of Merit elected the lean, gentlemanly Alejandro Oms, we did not. As more information has emerged, he’s looked marginal. He’s got a nifty 304 batting runs, but he doesn’t add anything on the bases and loses a little in in the field. It all adds up to 37 peak WAR, which is lower-level Hall of Miller and Eric territory in centerfield. On the other hand, he’s basically got two really amazing seasons, an All-Star year, and stuff, so he leans a little too heavily on his very best two years. He has 64 career wins, which is actually quite good, and the combination would place him in the electable vicinity of Willie Davis and Max Carey around 16th to 20th at the position. However, a lot of Oms’ numbers are built off of very small samples of seasons, and there’s enough gaps in his resume that we felt like unless more information comes through, we need to tread carefully. In fact, as more data has come through, his stock has declined. Stay tuned.\n\nA reader who goes by the Baseball Think Factory screen name of Jaack asked us to run up the numbers on Spots Poles, and we appreciate his request! Poles has been said by many to be a very fast runner. It doesn’t really show up in our estimates with just 7 baserunning runs and -7 fielding runs. It’s probably a weakness in our measuring tools rather than something real, but then again, we are using the same tools for everyone. Poles could hit (+219 batting runs), and his exploits sum up to 32 peak and 51 career wins. Some nice comps include Ellis Burks (32 peak, 50 career) and Jimmy Ryan (31 peak, 52 career), my 43rd and 44thranked centerfielders. For those so inclined, Poles missed one season due to the Great War. Give him another 3.0 wins or so (raising him to 54) and maybe guys like Mike Cameron (34 peak, 51 career) and Kirby Puckett (35 peak and 50 career) come into view, just a few notches ahead, around 40th all-time.\n\nI have to admit, I’m a fan of Lázaro Salazar’s. I’m not certain why, but I just think he’s interesting. Good hitter; good runner; slick fielder in centerfield, right field, and at first base; good pitcher; great manager. Lots to like about him. And when we eventually add DP avoidance estimates to his tally, he’ll be good at that too. With all that, his peak is worth 37 WAR and his career 63. We could place him at several batting positions. Let’s start with centerfield. Here he would be just a smidge better than Max Carey, so about 20th. In right field, he falls in somewhere around Dwight Evans (who is 19th with 37 peak, 67 career) and Dave Winfield (38 peak, 65 career), depending upon how we view the peak-suppression of the MLE routine. At first base, he’s duking it out with Harm Killebrew (39 peak, 62 career and 26th all-time).\n\nOur penultimate middleman is the great Turkey Stearnes with his 511 estimated batting runs and 31 fielding runs. He’s a force, and it all adds up to 44 peak WAR and 87 career. That’ll play anywhere on the diamond, but the peak is very low for a candidate with 80-something WAR. As usual, it’s the peak-suppression. My guess is that we’re talking about a guy who rivals Ken Griffey, Jr. (53 peak, 81 career) and Joe DiMaggio (56 peak, 84 career). That means Turkey lands around fifth to eighth all-time.\n\nOur last but hardly least centerfielder is the amazing Cristóbal Torriente. Were it not for a relatively short career, he’d be shoulder to shoulder with Stearnes. As it is, our MLEs show a 47 WAR peak and 78 career wins. That’s dang impressive and places him 8th, 9th, or 10th depending on your rankings of Rich Ashburn (50 peak, 79 career) and Sliding Billy Hamilton (49 peak, 72 career). I think he’s probably capped there, though it’s possible Ken Griffy, Jr. could come into play.\n\nMan, that’s a lot of centerfielders, but then the Negro Leagues were a centerfield factory. These are just the best ones! Next up corner outfielders, of which there are mercifully fewer, then we’ll move on to our friendly neighborhood moundsmen."
