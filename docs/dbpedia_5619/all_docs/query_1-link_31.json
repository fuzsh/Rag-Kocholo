        "text": "To help pass the time during the coronavirus pandemic, MLB.com has been engaging fans to debate the wait by ranking the top players at each position on each club.\n\nSo far, we’ve gone through the Yankees’ catchers, first basemen, second basemen, third basemen, shortstops and left fielders.\n\nUp next could be the biggest debate of them all: center field. Joe DiMaggio vs. Mickey Mantle. Legions of fans have been arguing about this for decades. MLB.com adds to the discussion with its two cents.\n\n1. Mickey Mantle (1951-68)\n\n20-time All-Star, 7-time World Series champion, 3-time American League MVP, 1974 Hall of Fame inductee\n\nMantle won the 1956 Triple Crown, hitting 52 home runs with a career-high 130 RBI and a .353 batting average (it would be Mantle’s only batting title).\n\nIn 18 years, he hit .298 with 536 home runs, which ranks 18th all-time.\n\n2. Joe DiMaggio (1936-51)\n\n13-time All-Star, 9-time World Series champion, 3-time American League MVP, 1955 Hall of Fame Inductee\n\nDiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak in 1941 stands as one of the untouchable records in baseball. He missed the 1943-45 seasons while serving in the military during World War II.\n\nDiMaggio was a lifetime .325 hitter, winning a pair of batting titles in 1939 (.381) and 1940 (.352).\n\n3. Bernie Williams (1991-2006)\n\n5-time All-Star, 4-time World Series champion\n\nWilliams also won four Gold Gloves as the center fielder for the Yankees’ most recent dynasty. He won a batting title in 1998, hitting .339.\n\n4. Earle Combs (1924-35)\n\n3-time World Series champion, 1970 Hall of Fame inductee\n\nCombs played 12 seasons, all with the Yankees, and was a key cog atop the Murderers’ Row lineup with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.\n\n5. Bobby Murcer (1965-74, 1979-83)\n\n5-time All-Star\n\nMurcer had two tours with the Yankees, but missed the World Series titles in 1977 and 1978. The Gold Glover winner finished in the top 9 of MVP voting three times.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
