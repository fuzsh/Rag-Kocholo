Although these names are some of the best of all time there is just one that stands out from the rest because he was a freak of nature and that is the fireballing right hander Nolan Ryan. Nolan Ryan is arguably the hardest thrower of all time in the past 30-40 years and is one of the best workhorse pitchers of all time besides the all time shutout leader, Walter Johnson.

Greg Maddux off the baseball diamond may look like a high school history teacher to some, but it was his work on the mound that earned him the nickname the professor. While Greg Maddux may not exactly fit what some say the best pitcher in baseball is supposed to look like it’s his statistics that say for the better part of his career he was. We’ve all been outmatched at some point in our lives; for some it was mentally, and for others it was physically. Greg Maddux is no exception to this because unlike Randy Johnson who was 6 foot 10 inches tall and left handed or Roger Clemens who was 6 foot 4 inches tall and weighed around 250 pounds Greg was physically outmatched everyday when he showed up to the ballpark.\n\nKyle Kleinman Mrs. Ross English 12 30 January 2017 Why Pete Rose Should Be In The Hall Of Fame We should be able to honor the hit king by electing him into the hall of fame with 4,256 hits, the most in MLB history but we can’t.
