        "text": "Joe DiMaggio was a a four-year veteran of the Pacific Coast League when Ed Barrow came calling on behalf of the Yankees. DiMaggio was playing for his hometown San Francisco Seals, coming off a 1935 season in which he hit .398. It would take a lot to persuade the young DiMaggio to leave a seemingly perfect situation.\n\nBarrow swaggered in with a $25,000 contract offer and the rest is history. DiMaggio’s calm presence and outstanding play ensured another successful era as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig wound down their careers.\n\nIn this photo, the smiling DiMaggio shakes hands with Yankee owner Jacob Ruppert. DiMaggio has signed this boldly across his chest. Joe’s brother Dom also enjoyed a stellar Major League career.\n\nJoe DiMaggio had a championship run never before seen in baseball history. When he joined the New York Yankees, the franchise had four World Series titles to their credit. In his 13-year run with the club they added 9 more.\n\nDiMaggio broke in with New York in the 1936 season. The Bronx Bombers were led by AL MVP Lou Gehrig who hit .354 with 205 hits, 49 homers, 152 RBI, and a 190 OPS+. The 21-year old DiMaggio was no slouch either. His 206 hits, 44 doubles, and league-leading 15 triples were all tops among Yankee hitters.\n\nIn his rookie season DiMaggio was an All Star and World Series champion. These two feats became commonplace for the Yankee Clipper. DiMaggio made the Mid Summer Classic in his 13 big league seasons. He played in 10 World Series and came away with 9 rings.\n\nDiMaggio received MVP votes in 12 of his 13 campaigns. He finished in the top-10 ten times, in the top-5 six times, and won the award three times. A two-time batting champ, DiMaggio boasts a .325 career average.\n\nIn 1937 he had 418 total bases, a figure surpassed just three times since. Two years later he hit .381 to earn the first of two consecutive batting crowns. He hit 20 or more homers in 11 of his 13 years and slugged 30 or more on 7 occasions. DiMaggio never struck out more than 39 times in any season and had 7 campaigns in which he tallied more home runs than strikeouts.\n\nIn 1941 DiMaggio hit in an MLB record 56 straight games and had a career-high 9.4 WAR. Nine of his seasons included a WAR greater than 5.0. After the ’41 World Series triumph, he missed three full seasons while serving in the military during World War II.\n\nThough his average dipped below .300 for the first time in his career upon his return in 1946, DiMaggio still had 25 homers, 95 RBI, and a .511 slugging percentage in 132 games. From 1947 through his age-35 season in 1930, he hit .317 with a .404 on-base percentage. During that time he averaged 26 home runs and 110 RBI.\n\nDiMaggio retired after the 1951 season after three straight World Series titles. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nIn the collection is his season pass to all Yankee games for the 1956 season with the facsimile signature of Yanks owner Dan Topping. New York had dropped the previous World Series to the Dodgers but avenged the loss in a seven-game thriller against Brooklyn in 1956. One can picture the dapper DiMaggio flashing the pass and making his way to see his former teammates.\n\nJoe’s brother Dom also enjoyed a stellar Major League career.\n\nThe iconic Joe DiMaggio remained in the public eye after leaving the game in 1951. Three years after hanging up his spikes he married Marilyn Monroe. Though the pair remained close until Monroe’s death in 1961, the starlet filed for divorce just nine months after tying the knot.\n\nThe 1968 Simon and Garfunkel hit “Mrs. Robinson” reached #1 on the US Billboard Top 100. It won two Grammy Awards and asked, “Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?”.\n\nMyth-building continued in 1969. During baseball’s centennial season sportswriters voted DiMaggio the game’s greatest living player. From then on, the former Yankee star insisted on being introduced that way during all public appearances.\n\nIn the 1970s DiMaggio became the television face of electric drip coffee maker brand Mr. Coffee. For more than two decades fans welcomed the Yankee Clipper into their living rooms.\n\nA heavy smoker for much of his life, DiMaggio was admitted to the hospital for lung cancer in October of 1998. After a 99-day stay, he returned home to Florida where he passed away at age 84 on March 8, 1999.\n\nJoe DiMaggio earned his fourth-straight All Star appearance and his first MVP Award in 1939. The batting champ hit a career-high .381 with 30 homers and 126 runs batted in.\n\nIn the postseason DiMaggio’s Yankees faced the Cincinnati Reds. After winning the first two games, the Yankees found themselves down 3-2 in the third inning of Game 3. A Cincinnati win would put the Reds back into the Series.\n\nDiMaggio had other ideas.\n\nWith one on and two out, DiMaggio came to the plate against Gene Thompson. The Yankee Clipper delivered the knockout blow, slugging a two-run homer over the centerfield wall to put New York ahead to stay.\n\nIn the collection is this letter from the pitcher Thompson. Dated June 22, 1979, the correspondence is on Cubs letterhead from Thompson’s time as a scout.\n\n“I had the chance to distinguish myself as being one of the younger ones to pitch in a World Series in 1939, since I had just turned 22 in June…,” Thompson writes. “What I would just as soon forget and I can’t was the four home runs hit off me that day, 2 by DiMaggio, one by (George) Selkirk + one by (Charlie) Keller.”\n\nDiMaggio’s go-ahead blast – his only of the Series – must’ve made quite an impression on Thompson. In the letter written 40 years after that Game 3, Thompson’s memory gives Joe more credit than he deserves, doubling his homer total.\n\nThompson later writes of a memorable play involving Hall of Fame catcher Ernie Lombardi.\n\nWho made the greatest catch in World Series history? Historians and fans alike debate the question.\n\nSome say it was Al Gionfriddo’s grab of Joe DiMaggio’s shot down the left field line in the 1947 World Series. Others maintain that Willie Mays’ catch off of the bat of Cleveland’s Vic Wertz was better.\n\nIn the collection is this letter from longtime St. Louis sportswriter and editor Sid Kenner. After his career in media, Keener became the Director of the Hall of Fame. It is in this capacity that Keener writes about the two catches.\n\n“Inasmuch as I saw both catches, I regard the one by Mays as the more difficult,” Keener opines. “Then again others may say that Gionfriddo was the more spectacular.\n\n“I regret to advise that the Baseball Hall of Fame does not possess photos of those particular plays.”\n\nThe following image shoes Gionriddo’s catch of the DiMaggio drive."
