        "text": "Join a Discussion on Baseball: Joe DiMaggio\n\nBy ARTHUR DALEY\n\no he turned his back on the $100,000 and abruptly walked away. That's what Joe DiMaggio did yesterday in announcing his retirement. Only an overwhelming pride could take a step like that. The Yankee Clipper has always been a proud man. That's why he was such a great ball player. He never was satisfied with anything less than perfection and he was lashed by inner torments whenever the DiMaggio of 1951 failed to accomplish things that the DiMaggio of 1941 would have done with effortless ease.\n\nJOE DIMAGGIO\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJoe DiMaggio, the Yankee Clipper and an American Icon, Dies at 84\n\nSports of The Times: His Privacy, Pride, Ego and Dignity\n\nSports of The Times: DiMaggio Left a Mark in the Sands\n\nDiMaggio's 56: A Streak for the Ages\n\nContemporaries Remember Him as the Best Baseball Had to Offer\n\nToday's Yankees Mourn a Timeless Hero\n\nCoast Friends Recall DiMaggio as a Loner\n\nComplete Times Coverage\n\nOp-Ed\n\nThe Silent Superstar by Paul Simon\n\nVideo\n\nVideo: The life of Joe DiMaggio\n\nAudio\n\nAudio: Dave Anderson, New York Times sports columnist\n\nAudio: New York Times Sports Columnist George Vecsey\n\nJoe DiMaggio\n\nAudio: Red Barber\n\nAudio: Mel Allen\n\nYogi Berra\n\nSimon & Garfunkel -- Mrs. Robinson\n\nPast Articles\n\nDiMaggio Hits in 56th Game (July 17, 1941)\n\nSports of The Times: End of the Trail (Dec. 12, 1951)\n\nWhen DiMaggio and Co.

Although he never had been a hail-fellow-well-met, he became more of a \"loner,\" almost a man apart from the rest of the team. He brooded more and more, unhappy in his weakness against injuries, great and small. And he was unhappy because the flashes of greatness he still experienced became briefer and briefer.\n\nWhen a fellow stops to analyze DiMaggio's nature, he can't help but wonder why he ever thought Joe might continue for another year. It should have been obvious that he'd never permit himself to go on, a journey that had to be downhill. His pride would not let him do it.\n\nDiMaggio had been the heart of the Yankees and Tommy Henrich had been the soul. Now both are gone. Only the shell remains. It's hard to realize it.\n\nThe Yankee Clipper was the heart of the Yankees just as Babe Ruth had been before him. Each was the leader, the man who extricated them from difficulties. Their personalities were as far apart as poles but in action they were blood brothers.\n\n\"It all depends on the Big Fellow,\" was Bucky Harris' stock reply to all questions as to Yankee pennant chances. \"If he has a good season, we're in.\"\n\nIt was amazing the way DiMag could respond to pressure, a money player with few equals. Rarely did he falter when the chips were down. He was eternally making the big play and it didn't matter what it had to be -- the big hit, the big catch or the big throw. He could make them all in flashing style.\n\nTime alone will be able to accord him his true place in baseball history. At the very worst he will rank as the fourth best outfielder behind Ruth, Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker. Maybe he'll do slightly better. But few can argue with the statement that he is the best ball player of this generation.\n\nIf he had a flaw to his make-up, it was that he rarely made it look difficult. He was always the very epitome of grace, gliding effortlessly into position with smooth, loping stride and uncanny sense of timing. Sure, he pulled an occasional superhuman play like his one-hand, last-second stab to the deepest wall of Yankee Stadium. DiMaggio was the only ball player who could have made that catch. So he did.\n\nThere wasn't a better, stronger or more accurate thrower than DiMaggio in his prime. Such was his reputation that no one dared run on him or try for the extra base one season even though Joe's arm had gone dead because of a shoulder injury. He confessed, at the end of the campaign, that he'd make one hard throw a game, if necessary, to keep the boys honest. \"It was the only throw I had in my system,\" he grinned. \"Once I let go I was through for the day.\"\n\nThe scouting report that Andy High filed on him before the World Series must have cut him to the quick. Among them were such capsule criticisms as these: \"He can't stop quickly and throw hard... You can take the extra base on him... He can't run and won't bunt... His reflexes are very slow and he can't pull a good fast ball at all.\" None of it was complimentary. This report could very well have hastened his decision.\n\nThe Yankee Clipper was a natural ball player all the way. Every instinct was correct. He never could discuss moves the way a Ted Williams or a Henrich could, breaking them down into component parts to see what made them tick and then giving a lucid analysis of each progressive step. He just did everything right by instinct. No one can remember seeing Joe in the sliding pits, for instance, and yet he probably was the most talented and accomplished slider in either league, one of the best ever in taking the extra base from first to third.\n\nJoe wrote a book once, \"Lucky to Be a Yankee.\" But he was not particularly lucky as a Yankee. Even in his freshman year he was left overly long in a baking machine in the trainer's quarters and burned. He missed out on games in every season but one, the 1942 campaign, when he played the full 154. A trick knee almost kept him out of the big leagues at the start and injuries of varying degree dogged his every footstep, including the best-publicized heel since Achilles.\n\nAt times, last season, he could hardly drag himself out of bed and only his flaming spirit kept him going. But now his pride has told him that the time has come to halt. So he has quit, fancy salary to the contrary. That makes his pride a rather expensive commodity but one can't help but admire him for it.\n\nHe was a great ball player and it hurts to see him go."
