        "text": "“The old-timers. They were better hitters! No question about it.”\n\nSaid Ed Barrow after he became president of the New York Yankees in 1939 and Jimmy Powers of The New York Daily News had the 71-year-old pick his all-time team.\n\nPowers said of Barrow:\n\n“The beetle-browed executive, one of the few remaining links between the gas-lit, coach-and-four, Wee Willie Keeler era and the moderns, boomed at us across his wide, flat-topped desk in the offices of the New York baseball club.”\n\nBarrow was “a great believer in ‘natural born’ stars,’ telling Powers, “A fellow has it—or he hasn’t it.”\n\nHe explained his theory:\n\n“Once in a while a manager will make a few minor corrections in stance, or change something here and there, but if player hasn’t the natural coordination, the God-given physique, the reflexes for rhythm and timing, he’ll never get ‘em. Sometimes one man will get more mileage out of his talents than another because he will work harder. That’s why the old-timers were better hitters. They looked at better pitching, and they practiced and practiced and practiced.”\n\nBarrow said there was one reason in particular for why old-timers were better hitters:\n\n“The tipoff is in the strikeout column. The moderns strikeout oftener—and there’s your answer. The present-day hitter is so homerun crazy that half the time he closes his eyes and swings; four bases or nothing! Usually, it’s nothing.”\n\nBarrow’s told Powers:\n\n“Now, on my All-Star, All-Time team I’d put Cobb, Speaker and Ruth in the outfield. Chase, Lajoie, Wagner, and Jimmy Collins in the infield. Matty, Johnson, Waddell, and McGinnity, pitchers. And Bill Dickey, catcher…I’d put Joe DiMaggio on that team as utility outfielder. I’d put Lou Gehrig as substitute first baseman and pinch hitter. Bill Bradley, Eddie Collins, Swede Risberg, and Buck Weaver would also get contracts on this ‘Dream Team.’ Keeler would be another utility outfielder and Bresnahan would be my second catcher. Ruffing and Gomez would fill out my pitching staff!”\n\nBarrow said he could offer “a million reasons’ for the rationale for each selected player.\n\n“(R)ecords can be misleading…I won’t quote you records of my All-Timers…A man must be in the dugout or in the stands to weigh the merits of a player and not be influenced by a record book.”\n\nHe said in choosing his team, he held “no grudges,” which is why he selected Risberg and Weaver, “Black Sox scandal or not.”\n\nHe said he would add Joe Jackson to the team, “if I thought he was smart enough. But Jackson, strange to say, was the only dumb one on that whole team. Up until 1938s Yankees—those Black Sox were the best team in baseball!”\n\nAs for some of his picks:\n\n“Chase on first base! Nobody near him. He could throw a ball through a knothole, covered the whole infield like a cat, and remember he used a glove that just covered his fingers and seldom had a palm. The ‘peach baskets’ first basemen use today would have been barred years back, Chase could hit behind the runner, bunt, steal, fake a bunt at third and then bunt over the third baseman’s head. He could do all the tricks.”\n\nHe called Napoleon Lajoie “the most graceful second baseman I have ever seen. He had a rifle arm and was as slick as a panther,” and gave him the edge “by a slight margin” over Eddie Collins.\n\nHonus Wagner, who Barrow signed for the Patterson Silk Weavers in 1896, “is my nomination as the greatest individual ballplayer of all time.”\n\nOf his first impression of Wagner, he said:\n\n“He was pretty terrible when I first ran across him, looked awkward as all get-out. But suddenly he would come through with a perfectly dazzling play that had everybody on our bench swallowing his tobacco cud in astonishment.”\n\nLike Lajoie, Barrow said Jimmy Collins just edged out the second choice—Bill Bradley—because:\n\n“Collins could make perfect throws to first from any position. When an infielder makes an off-balance throw today the crowd gives him a big hand. The old timers did it every play because the old ball was slow dribbling out there. Today the lively ball comes out fast in one or two hops, and this gives the third baseman a chance to make his throw from a ‘straightened up’ stance.…Remember, in the old days the ball was dark, wet with slippery elm juice; often it was smudged with grass stains, hard to follow.”\n\nIn the outfield, Barrow said, “I don’t think anyone will give you an argument on Cobb-Speaker-Ruth.”\n\nHe called Ty Cobb “the greatest hitter of all time,” with “a lightning-quick brain and plenty of gut.”\n\nBabe Ruth, he said was, in addition to the being the “great slugger of all-time,” changed the game because of “His salary, his magnetic personality, and his publicity.”\n\nTris Speaker “was superb. A good hitter, a great fielder, a brainy man. He was so confident of his ability ‘to go back’ he practically camped on second base.”\n\nOf the pitching staff, he said Christy Mathewson “could do almost everything with a baseball—practically make it talk.”\n\nOf Walter Johnson he said:\n\n“He had awe-inspiring speed. You’d stand up there watching and suddenly—pfffft—pfffft—pfffft. Three phantom bullets whizzed past. Too fast for your eyes to focus ‘em.”\n\nRube Waddell was “the best lefthander” he had seen.\n\nJoe McGinnity appeared to be a sentimental choice:\n\n“(He) was a work horse, a competent soul who loved the game so much I believe he’d work for nothing.”\n\nBill Dickey, he said was not “given the credit” he deserved:\n\n“He’s a hitter. A workmanlike receiver. Handles pitchers marvelously. Has a good arm. Is fast. Is always one jump ahead of the opposition. Dickey does everything well.”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLucius “Melancholy” Jones, after a college football and basketball career at Clark College—now Clark Atlanta University—served as sports editor for several black newspapers, wrote for The Pittsburgh Courier and the Southern Newspaper Syndicate which served many black newspapers across the country.\n\nIn 1941, he enumerated the “frailties of Negro baseball,” which were:\n\n“1. Selfish, dishonest, and insecure owners and higher ups;\n\n2. Absence of records, lack of publicity, failure to give the fans their money’s worth; and\n\n3. Trampish tendencies, jumping of clubs, moral indecency, and respect of a baseball contract as more than a piece of paper.”\n\nSatchel Paige, “rated by the immortal Grover Cleveland Alexander as one of the five greatest pitchers of all time, regardless of race, creed, or color and declare by Joe DiMaggio to be the best pitcher he ever batted against…should be the idol of his race; the pride of colored kids everywhere,” he said\n\nBut, instead, “(T)he average Negro boy knows 10 times as much about Joe DiMaggio as he does about Oscar Charleston or Turkey Stearns; 10 times as much about Bob Feller as he does Paige or Hilton Smith; 10 times as much about Lou Gehrig as he ever knew about Buck Leonard or Red Moore; and the average colored fan knows the standings of every club in the white major leagues but hasn’t the faintest idea as to just which of the Negro clubs is in first place. Published standings, game-to-game box scores, and official scoring are more or less mythical.”\n\nPaige had in 1941, appeared with four teams, including organizations “in both of the Negro major leagues,” and as a result “of his trampish tendency of playing with so many clubs.” And, despite the fact the was “a surprisingly clean liver…his utter lack of respect for a baseball contract,” resulted in him lacking the type of following enjoyed by white players.\n\nJones said:\n\n“But what is more remarkable than Paige’s pitching for four different clubs in a season is just three months old at this writing is the fact that this strange thing has been done with approval of officials of both leagues—or so it would seem, because instead of handling him severally for his trampish practices which automatically amount to ineligibility went to the other extreme, removing the bar against his participation in the annual East-West Classic.”\n\nBoth leagues required “overhauling,” because each stood “for little more than personal gain, and even in this selfish motive are not together. There is continuous bickering between” the two leagues’ officials.\n\nNegro League baseball was, according to Jones, in such precarious shape because of its lack of organization that if steps were not taken to shore up the “tottering empire,” it would be “doomed to oblivion.” Jones cited a popular vaudeville comedian and actor’s signature bit as an analogy:\n\n“Negro baseball is staggering about grotesquely on its last legs like a Leon Errol. Most of us fear for the worst.”\n\nJones’ regular rancor directed at the magnates of black baseball was continuous and based on his conclusion that:\n\n“White major league baseball is good. The white baseball loops are better organized and better patronized than the colored leagues. But the brand of ball played in those white circuits is not superior to that played by the best Negro teams.”\n\nJones, like Wendell Smith, his colleague at The Pittsburgh Courier continued calling for an “overhauling” of the Negro Leagues while at the same time pushing for integration in baseball. Jones outlined the “three important steps” to successfully integrate the game:\n\n“1. Crystallization of a favorable public sentiment; 2. Numerous experimental contests between white and Negro stars of major league caliber in the larger cities where mass reaction will be greatest; and 3. attainment of total endorsement from Commissioner Kennesaw M. Landis and organized baseball as an institution.”\n\nJones went on to become the New Orleans editor for The Courier and the first black host of a radio sportscast on a white station in the deep south when he hosted a show for 16 weeks on WDSU-AM in New Orleans in 1949—he also helped bring the first sports telecast in the deep south featuring two black teams to WDSU-TV on April 30, 1950 when the station aired a game between the Kansas City Monarchs and the New York Cubans with Jones presenting “between inning highlights.”\n\nHe also was a co-founder—along with his former Clark College teammate and fellow Courier writer Ric Roberts—of Atlanta’s “the 100% Wrong Club” which was established for the purpose of recognizing black collegiate athletes.\n\nJones was just 47 years old when he died in 1952.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSatchel Paige told Dave Condon of The Chicago Tribune that early in 1965, with the help of his wife Lahoma, and 17-year-old daughter Pamela he “wrote letters to everyone in baseball just looking for a steady job. Anything.”\n\nAfter not one professional team responded, the spring and early summer were like most during his 40-year career as a pitcher—Paige traveled wherever there was a chance for a paycheck.\n\nHe had made appearances with the Harlem Globetrotters in the winter and spring and then hit the road; pitching for the barnstorming Indianapolis Clowns and whoever else would call. In May, The Chicago Defender said Abe Saperstein, who was managing Paige’s appearances, took out an ad in The Sporting News:\n\n“(T)he man, who may have been the greatest pitcher of all time, is letting it be known that he has glove and is willing to travel. All that is necessary to secure his services is to contact Saperstein.”\n\nOne night Paige would be at Chicago’s Comiskey Park, in a White Sox uniform, pitching for the Clowns in front of a large crowd, or across town in Wrigley Field where 30,000 fans came out; another night would find him in Hastings, Pennsylvania taking “the mound for the Hastings VFW club,” or Wheatfield, Indiana pitching “for the Band Boosters against the Wheatfield Young Farmers,” in front of a few hundred people.\n\nThings began to look up in late July when the Cleveland Indians inducted Paige into the team’s Hall of Fame between games of a Sunday doubleheader with the Yankees; in front of the team’s largest crowd of the season: 56,634. According to United Press International:\n\n“Satch tossed examples of his blooper, drooper and hesitation pitches to (former Indians teammate) Jim Hegan, now a Yankee coach and explained his philosophy of pitching thus: ‘Just take the ball and throw it where you want to. Throw strikes. Home plate don’t move.”\n\nIn August, he accepted an offer to pitch for and manage a team in Anchorage, Alaska called the Earthquakers. In reality, Paige simply went to Alaska for a short series of exhibition games, and had no intention of staying there—he was already booked to appear at the old-timers game scheduled in September to mark the first season of the Houston Astrodome. But he did his best to sell it as a possible long-term move. He told a reporter for The Associated Press:\n\n“Lately, I’ve wanted to leave barnstorming baseball to settle down somewhat to help the sport. Anchorage seems to be the place to do it.”\n\nIn addition to his appearance in a handful of games in Alaska, his arrival in the state also resulted in a chance meeting that was reported in the press.\n\nAs a crowd of local residents gathered at the Anchorage airport to greet Paige, another plane arrived for refueling. It carried former Vice President Richard M. Nixon on his way to Tokyo. Nixon walked into the terminal while the plane was refueled, and when he asked about the crowd he was told they were waiting for Paige’s arrival. Nixon joined the line to greet the pitcher. The man who would be the leader of the free world in a little more than three years told a reporter from The Associated Press:\n\n“I always like to meet celebrities.”\n\nHis commitment in Alaska over, Paige made it to the Astrodome on September 6. The two-inning game, featuring a team of “immortals” versus “Texas All-Stars,” was an incredible collection of legends—more than 50 former players participated; twelve were already members of the Hall of Fame. The Houston Post said of the player introductions:\n\n“Joe DiMaggio, the Yankee Clipper, got a deafening cheer. So did Satchel Paige, peerless Negro hurler.”\n\nThe paper said the only others to receive a reception near that for Paige and DiMaggio were Dizzy Dean and native Texan Monty Stratton.\n\nPerhaps it was the reception in Houston that caused one of the letters Paige, and his wife and daughter had written months earlier to finally be answered.\n\nCharles Oscar Finley, who made his fortune in the insurance business and bought controlling interest of the Kansas City A’s before the 1961 season, was the one who finally responded.\n\nThat the signing of Paige appears to have been a spur of the moment decision for Finley after reading about the reception in Houston, is supported by the fact that it was announced by the marketing savvy Finley at what The Kansas City Times described as a “hastily called news conference,” which Finley, who was in Chicago, did not attend.\n\nHe appeared with General Manager Hank Peters and told reporters “I thought they were kidding” when Finley called and offered him a contract.\n\nHe said he was ready to pitch and brushed aside questions about his age:\n\n“I think I can still pitch and help this club. So what difference does it make what my age is if I can?”\n\nBill Veeck, who had signed Paige with the Cleveland Indians in 1948 and the St. Louis Browns in 1951, told The Times he hoped it wasn’t just a publicity stunt by Finley:\n\n“I am hopeful he will be used as he should be—as a pitcher. Leroy should surprise a few people as he has for a long time.”\n\nThe controversial Veeck, more than a decade away from his return to the game, told The Kansas City Star he blamed himself for the pitcher’s long absence:\n\n“When I left Cleveland the first thing the new owners did was get rid of Satch. When I sold the St. Louis Browns (and the team relocated to Baltimore), the same thing happened. That’s nothing more than guilt by association.”\n\nThe signing of the 59-year-old Paige, who joined a team that included five 19 and 20-year-old pitchers who appeared in at least one game that year—Jim “Catfish” Hunter, John “Blue Moon” Odom, Ron Tompkins, Tom Harrison and Don Buschorn—inspired a short poem published in The Star:\n\n“They’re either too\n\nYoung or too old,\n\nWhen Charlie puts ‘em\n\nIn A’s Green and Gold.”\n\nPapers across the country carried a photograph of Paige, seated on a chair, with one of Finley’s young pitchers, Catfish Hunter, on his knee. While the photo was straight from Finley’s marketing plan, the impact of one future Hall of Famer on another, forty years his junior, seems to have been real.\n\nThe Star spoke to Paige about his pitching philosophy one afternoon as Hunter stood nearby. The paper said:\n\n“Hunter listened intently as Satchel expounded his pitching theories.”\n\nPaige was equally impressed with the 19-year-old, telling The Star:\n\n“This young man has shown me a lot of poise. He has a great future in this game.”\n\nThe next two weeks were filled with pictures of, and stories about, Paige in a rocking chair, a nurse seated nearby, watching the A’s play, and while a “Satchel Paige Night” was scheduled, there appeared little chance the pitcher would be used as anything but a prop for publicity. Then Finley announced that his new pitcher would start on his night, September 25 against the Boston Red Sox.\n\nWhat took place on the mound on September 25 has been written about many times. With his six children and wife Lahoma—pregnant with number seven—sitting in the owner’s box with Finley, Paige pitched three shutout innings, allowing just one hit—a Carl Yastrzemski double.\n\nThe only disappointment was the anemic crowd—just 9,289 Kansas City fans turned out to see a legend, the second largest crowd during that six-game home stand was 2,874.\n\nAs Paige took the mound in the fourth inning, A’s Manager Haywood Sullivan, who was not consulted before Paige’s signing or before Finley announced he would pitch that night, came to the mound to remove Paige. The pitcher walked off to a standing ovation.\n\nPaige returned to the clubhouse. The Star said:\n\n“In the clubhouse he was down to his long underwear, and talking about helping the A‘s out of the basement when someone rushed in a and screamed, ‘Satch, they want you back on the field.’\n\n“The lights were out. More than 9,000 matches flickered in the darkness, and on ‘Salute to Satchel Paige Night,’ they sang ‘Rockin’ Chair,’ ‘Darling I am Growing Old,’ and “The Old Gray Mare.”\n\nAfter returning to the clubhouse, Paige was greeted by Finley, who called him “a real credit to the game.” Paige “shook the owner’s hand” and said “I want to thank you for bringing me here.”\n\nWhether he truly believed it or not, Paige told reporters he planned to pitch again in 1965.\n\n“Everybody doubted me on the ballclub. They’ll have more confidence in me now.”\n\nHe did not appear in another game but stayed with the club for the remainder of the season. Two days after his three-inning performance, he was with the team in Baltimore.\n\nA discouraging word had not been uttered by Paige during his time with the A’s. Perhaps being in Baltimore—where his big league career effectively ended after Veeck sold the Browns—or maybe just the realization that a man capable of throwing three shutout innings at age 59 was not given an opportunity by a major league club the previous 12 seasons, changed that.\n\nLou Hatter wrote in The Baltimore Sun:\n\n“Satchel Paige, the slender pitching ancient signed 2 ½ weeks ago by Kansas City, bared a deep-rooted wound here last night for the first time.”\n\nPaige said to Hatter:\n\n“You can put it this way. You can say I resent being overlooked by organized baseball all these years while I threw away most of my best years pitching for a barnstorming club…All they ask me, though, is how old am I. But nobody asks me why I stayed out of the major leagues for 15 [sic 12] years. That’s a long time isn’t it? That’s a lifetime for most professional players.\n\n“Let me ask another question. When Baltimore bought the St. Louis ballclub, why did they turn me loose?\n\n“When I went to the Miami club (again pitching for Bill Veeck with the International League Marlins) and was a top pitcher for three years (11, 10 and 10 win seasons with ERAs of 1.86, 2.42 and 2.95), how come nobody picked me up?…I know the answer, but I won’t tell that neither—like I won’t tell my age.”\n\nDespite Finley telling reporters throughout September that Paige would return to the A’s in 1966, if not as a player, then as a coach, he was released in September. The next time he appeared on the mound at Kansas City’s Municipal Stadium, it was again as a member of the barnstorming Indianapolis Clowns.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
