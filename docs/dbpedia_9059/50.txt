Funkdoobiest is a Native American rap group from Los Angeles, California. The original members are Son Doobie (Jason Vasquez), a Puerto Rican rapper, and DJ Ralph M (Ralph Medrano), a Chicano DJ, and Tomahawk Funk (Tyrone Pacheco) of the Lakota nation. The latter left after their second album.

Their first two albums were mainly produced by Cypress Hill’s DJ Muggs. Their third album, The Troubleshooters, included production by Ralph M and DJ Rectangle. Whereas the other albums were clearly hardcore rap in the vein of Cypress Hill and other Soul Assassins members, The Troubleshooters was more versatile.[citation needed] DJ Muggs was the group’s mentor and inspiration. The group is known for their sexually explicit song “Superhoes” about the perverted secret identities of superheroes. Most of their other songs have to do with sex, and Son Doobie proclaimed himself the porno king. They also had their own X-rated club in Los Angeles.

Funkdoobiest have never cared for censorship, and have released several hit singles such as, “XXX Funk” about controversial topics such as pornography.

Their fourth album ‘The Golden B-Boys’ was released in 2009. This album was produced and arranged by DJ Ralph M for B-Boy Beats LLC. The cover art was done by L.A. Graffiti Legend Galo “MAKE” Canote.
