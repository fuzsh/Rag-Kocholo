About Funkdoobiest

Funkdoobiest is a rap group from Los Angeles. The original members are Son Doobie (Jason Vasquez), a Puerto Rican rapper, DJ Ralph M (Ralph Medrano), a Chicano DJ, and Tomahawk Funk (Tyrone Pacheco) of the Lakota Nation. Tomahawk left after their second album. Their first two albums were mainly produced by Cypress Hill's DJ Muggs. Their third and so far last album, included production by Ralph M and DJ Rectangle. Whereas the other albums were clearly hardcore rap in the vein of Cypress Hill and other Soul Assassins members, "The Troubleshooters" was more versatile.
