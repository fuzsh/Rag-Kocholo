        "text": "Funkdoobiest is an Latino rap group made in Los Angeles, California. The original members are:\n\nSon Doobie (Jason Vasquez), a Puerto Rican rapper, DJ Ralph M (Ralph Medrano), a Mexican DJ, and Tomahawk Funk (Tyrone Pacheco) of the Lakota nation (Native American).\n\nThe latter left after their second album.\n\nTheir first two albums were mainly produced by Cypress Hill’s DJ Muggs. Their third album, The Troubleshooters, included production by Ralph M and DJ Rectangle. Whereas the other albums were clearly hardcore rap in the vein of Cypress Hill and other Soul Assassins members, The Troubleshooters was more versatile. DJ Muggs was the group’s mentor and inspiration. The group is known for their sexually explicit song “Superhoes” about the perverted secret identities of superheroes. Most of their other songs have to do with sex, and Son Doobie proclaimed himself the porno king. They also had their own X-rated club in Los Angeles.\n\nFunkdoobiest have never cared for censorship, and have released several hit singles such as, “XXX Funk” about controversial topics such as pornography."
