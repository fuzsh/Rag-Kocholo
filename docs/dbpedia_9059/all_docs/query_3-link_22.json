        "text": "Sage Francis is a forefather of the indie rap movement, the CEO of Strange Famous Records, and is widely considered one of our generation’s greatest lyricists. His career derives mainly from gifted wordplay which creates vivid narratives to instigate as well as inspire. There’s a lot more to it, but who has time for all that during times like these? A new solo studio album is slated for 2024 so expect that amongst many other creative endeavors."
