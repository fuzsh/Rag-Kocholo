        "text": "Happy Valentine’s Day, Bushwick! Whether you’re in love or single at the moment, we love you!! And that’s why Bushwick Daily contributors got together and created this super awesome Valentine’s Day playlist! So just sit back, hit play and get ready for a variety of emotions. You’ll be jumping, crying, laughing and cuddling whatever happens to be near you – your loved one, your pet or yourself (nothing wrong with that!). In other words, you will love it! Here is what we chose and why:\n\n“Pussy Ain’t Shit” by Funkdoobiest. As someone who as been single for 25 Valentine’s Days, I love listening to the most un-romantic rap song ever. – Kaitlin Parry\n\n“Hello Sunshine feat. Yelawolf” by STS. It has one of the most beautiful intro verses I’ve heard in hip hop in the last few years. That’s because it started out as a poem STS wrote for a former love. Sweet and sincere in its message, an unexpected rap combo, “Hello Sunshine” is a breath of fresh air every time I listen to it. – Wesley Salazar\n\n“No One’s Gonna Love You” by Band of Horses. I like a hint of melancholy in music (or let’s be honest, in everything), this song pulls at my heartstrings. What’s more romantic (and kind of sad) than the idea that no matter what happens or has happened, no one will ever love you more than this person? Ugh, it hits me right in my overly emotional, sappy heart. Single tear. – Arielle Sachar\n\n“Je t’ aime, moi non plus” by Jane Birkin et Serge Gainsbourg. For V-Day, I can’t think of anybody else but the biggest lover of French music and his song “Je t’ aime, moi non plus.” This song is the product of the relationship of this ugly singer with two of the most desirable women of the ’60s. Brigitte Bardot asked him to write the ultimate love song. He wrote it and they recorded it, but Brigitte’s husband found out about her relationship with Serge and they couldn’t release it. Serge loved the song and he found his muse in the eyes of the British actress Jane Birkin. The song was finally released in 1969 and landed poetically in no. 69 of the Billboard and when asked if the orgasmic sounds came from actual recording of sexual intercourse, he responded that they couldn’t have that long of a recording session. – Dimitri Manousakis\n\n“Love is a Losing Game” by Amy Winehouse. We’ve all been here! While you’re in a relationship, it’s all rainbows and puppies and walking on clouds. But after a breakup, it’s all “I wish we never met!” and “Love isn’t real!” and “My heart is as fragile as a china cabinet on the Titanic!” But the late great Amy Winehouse captures the fierce and fiery passion that makes all of the pain and period of alcoholism worth it all in the end. The song’s old timey ballad feel makes it a good one for either slow dancing with your partner or wistfully staring out your window with a glass of wine lamenting what could have been. Not to mention it comes with a number of awesome remixed versions! – Terri Ciconne\n\n“Play By Play” by Autre Ne Veut. If you pay attention to the new music scene you have probably heard all of the buzz surrounding Autre Ne Veut and his new single Play By Play. If you haven’t, get ready to be obsessed. Nobody cares about genres anymore but in case you are interested they are calling this new (micro?)genre DIY R&B. This song is about the trials and tribulations of co-dependency and if you are anything like me you won’t be able to stop listening to it. EVER. Even if your roommate threatens to smash your iPhone to pieces with a hammer and move out. – Nicole Bailey\n\n“In Too Deep” by Genesis. It is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I’ve heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole.” – Patrick Bateman. In a strange way, the anti-hero of American Psycho was totally right about Phil Collins. Three decades later this is still a great song to set the mood, either for pleasure or a loud argument about whether to become exclusive. – Eric Nelson\n\n“Spend A Little Doe” by Lil Kim. Brooklyn’s original Queen of rap lends casual hookups some must-have wisdom this Valentine’s Day. If you’re spending it with your main squeeze, you may wonder if you’re still too unofficial to let them foot the bill. But Kim lets us know it really doesn’t take much for someone to treat you to a beer & shot combo at a bar like The Cobra Club. So if they reach for their wallet, let them pay! And if you’re wondering if YOU should pick up the tab, Kim makes it clear this very well could make your mate feel a little appreciation this V-day. Don’t go dutch this round. Treat or be treated. Respect for the Queen who has taught us to keep realness within romance. – Cat Agonis\n\n“Wicked Games” by The Weeknd. If you haven’t heard of “Wicked Games” by now, be sure to check out this sultry track before hitting the town on Valentine’s Day. Whether you’re dressing to impress for your lover, dining with friends, or spending the night alone with Netflix, this R&B tune by The Weeknd is sure to get you in the mood, or at least make you want to jam out to Michael Jackson. It even might propel you to start planning your next rendezvous with that special someone. “Wicked Games” was originally released for free on the mix tape, House of Balloons. Coming off collaborations with Drake and Wiz Khalifa, The Weeknd’s sexy melodies are a surefire way to kickstart YOUR weekend into high gear. – Ashley Mathus\n\n“Somebody to Love” by Queen. My Valentine’s Day song has to be Queen’s “Somebody to Love” sung by George Michael. I have sung this song after break ups at the top of my lungs with stinging tears. I have sung this song with my best friends at the top of our lungs with stinging tears. This is the song you want to put out in the universe. As I am a hopeless romantic, and just want to find somebody to love. It has happened before, and will happen again. So crank this and sing it at the top of your lungs! #FindMe – Jenna Aranda\n\n“Greatest Love of All” by Whitney Houston. “Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all”. Truth! – Thérèse Maher\n\n“Fever” by Peggy Lee. My pick: the classy Peggy Lee. – Asha Chagoyen\n\n“Sweet Love” by Anita Baker. The only noise complaint I’ve ever received from a neighbor came while I was sitting alone, in the dark, listening to Anita Baker’s “Sweet Love” over and over again on repeat, circa Valentine’s Day 2005. It might not make you friends, but it definitely makes you happy. Or at least as happy as one can be while listening to Anita Baker alone in the dark on Valentine’s Day? – Danielle Thomson\n\n“The Sweetest Taboo” by Sade. Growing up Sade was always playing in my home. She was my mother’s favorite artist and from an early age she became one of mine. Personally I don’t think there is anyone that can compare to her ageless beauty and iconic quality. This song, which came out in 1985, is so sensual and seductive. She oozes femininity from every pore. The definition of a real woman. SADE SADE SADE! – Devon Groomes\n\n“Fuckin’ Problems” by A$AP Rocky, 2 Chainz, Kendrick Lamar, Drake. Contrary to popular belief, V-Day is the best day of the year to be single. Sure it can be hard ignoring the barrage of lovey-dovey ads and PDA, but if you go to the right bar at the right time, you have pretty good chances of meeting someone of the opposite sex just as desperate as you. On the walk back to the crib, take out your phone, hold it like a boombox, and play this song. The title says it all if you’re gettin’ laid or you ain’t, with some of the best lyricists of our era on the mic. The video is all erotic with those thick behinds movin’, and when the beat drops I just gotta shake my ass. Even if you do walk home alone tomorrow night, Kendrick can relate – at the end of his verse, he makes a pitch for unrequited love when he hollers at Halle Berry to hit him up, just in case she’s listenin’. BEAST! – Daniel Adler\n\n“#1 Crush” by Garbage. Waaay back in the 90’s, she was so much more than the perfect dark and stormy red head crush for both boys and girls alike. Aside from the smoky eyes and sultry voice, her lyrics spoke numbers, especially in this V-day pick. For anyone who has been passionately obsessed about anything, or anyone for that matter, this is the ultimate anthem. “I would die for you.” It’s the only thing you can give to someone and never get back and the only thing that should truly belong to you alone, your own life. If you’re that selfless, then it truly must be all about them. I’m not sure if anyone could have proved their love better than Shirley did about her #1 Crush, whoever they are. – Kathryn Lees\n\n“Everlong” by Foo Fighters. This is the most gorgeous song ever. – Jenna Aranda\n\n“2 become 1” by Spice Girls. “Be a little wiser, baby, put it on, put it on.” I picked this song because it promotes safe sex among teenagers, and I picked the orchestral version of it because I’m indulgent and want most out of life. Also because it reminds me of how love felt when I was a teenager, and how love feels now when I’m double the age. Despite what they tell you, it feels the same. Also, Spice Girls are awesome, am I right? – Katarina Hybenova"
