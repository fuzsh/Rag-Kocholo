        "text": "In many ways, Los Angeles’ Jurassic 5 were the ultimate hip-hop crew. A perfect example of — as stated in the title to their second official full-length — Power In Numbers.\n\nJ5 featured complicated vocal schemes and acrobatics — funky, forward-thinking, wide-ranging music and searching, positive lyrics that belied the chest-puffing usually attributed to the genre. Overall, they were a nearly perfect rap package for intelligent fans that cared about the art form and the culture that gave it life.\n\nPerhaps appropriately, the group’s formation story was as complicated as the six-headed monster itself. It was a Brady Bunch-style coming together from three separate directions in the mid-1990s. When the smoke cleared, six men stood side-by-side: DJ and producer Cut Chemist [Lucas Macfadden]; DJ and producer Nu-Mark [Mark Potsic]; MC Chali 2na [Charles Stewart]; MC Zaakir (aka Soup) [Courtenay Henderson]; MC Akil [Dante Givens]; and MC Marc 7 [Marc Stuart].\n\nThese men embarked on a unique journey that, over the course of the next decade-plus, took them through a surprising breakout single, an acclaimed EP, four albums, worldwide tours, robust album sales and boatloads of critical acclaim.\n\nThe first part of the story to tell is that of the Unity Committee, which gave the J5 Cut Chemist, Chali 2na and Marc 7. First forming around 1987, they came together despite geographic disparities — Cut was an Angeleno, but Chali and Marc both transplanted in the mid-80s, from Chicago and New Jersey, respectively.\n\nCut Chemist caught the hip-hop bug at an early age, thanks in no small part to pioneering hip-hop radio station KDAY, which became part of his life around 1983. In December of that year, he recorded a station broadcast of a Run-DMC show at the Pasadena Convention Center — which also featured the crucial L.A. hip-hop crew Uncle Jamm’s Army — and, as he states, “That was it. My mind was blown and my life changed forever.”\n\nHe already had vinyl collecting tendencies before being infected by the rap bug, but learning how to dig for records and being influenced by DJs he heard on KDAY like Jam Master Jay, Hitman Howie Tee, Cutmaster DC and Grandmixer D.ST drove him to add a second turntable to his arsenal and begin a new phase. “I was always more into scratching than mixing,” Cut explains. “By 1986, older DJs would bring me to parties as a ‘secret weapon’ scratch guy. At that time it was definitely a novelty to have a white kid scratching the way I was.”\n\nHe attended LACES [Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies] for both middle and high school, “in the Mid-City area,” and met future producer Thayod Ausar there, around 1987. Thayod was a nice guy, for sure. But just as importantly, he had a sampler, something the young DJ had never seen up-close before. That opened up another important avenue for Cut: production. He eventually bought Ausar’s Roland S-10 unit and was off to the proverbial races. “That sampler, my record collection and my dad’s 4-track became the beginning of me as a producer,” he recalls.\n\nChali and Marc 7 went to Marshall High School in the Silver Lake neighborhood of L.A. and had formed Unity Committee before Cut Chemist joined up. In early 1987, Cut met Chali at a Silver Lake Recreation Center party, introduced by their mutual friend DJ Cass. Early Unity Committee member Marvski was at the same jam. A mutual love of James Brown started the group’s coalescence, and by the late 80s they were making demos together — with another early member, Json aka Son Doobie of Funkdoobiest, who had moved on by 1990, along with Marv. For these early recordings, they converged upon a side room in Cut Chemist’s mother’s house, not far from Silver Lake.\n\nThis unassuming room would go on to play a critical role in Jurassic 5 lore. Christened The Red October Chemical Storage Facility, it would become the group’s clubhouse, recording studio and escape from the music industry for more than a decade. “It was a glass- and wood-paneled room where my mom used to hang plants,” Cut laughs. “You wouldn’t think it would work, but it had a nice ambient reverb on the vocals. Which was good, because there was no vocal booth. My parents were night owls and they liked the music and the energy. They were OK with us working there, day or night.”\n\nContinuing with the genealogy of the Unity Committee [which Cut Chemist and Chali both note could also be spelled as “U.N.I.T.Y” — for “United Nations of Intelligence Teaching Youth”], Chali 2na arrived in Los Angeles in 1986, from Chicago. “A lot of turmoil was going on around me in Chicago,” he explains. “My grandmother just lost her brother and son, we was just about to get kicked out of our house, and a good friend of mine had gotten killed right next to me. I had friends dealing drugs, gang banging, going to jail. That was all around me, but it wasn’t in me. I was more of an artist.”\n\nHe moved with his siblings and grandmother to his aunt’s in Silver Lake. “Meeting Marc 7 at Marshall [High School] helped me a lot, because I was really homesick when I got to L.A. We were both from outside of town and had come here through similar circumstances. We clicked right out the gate.”\n\nChali was a graffiti artist beginning in his early teens — as some fans know, he drew Jurassic’s early logos and did artwork for the group. “In 1986 I dabbled with rapping, breakdancing and DJing,” he says, “But I was more of a graffiti artist. I didn’t get more serious about rapping until 1987.”\n\nAccording to Chali, by 1990 U.N.I.T.Y. was the hip-hop group, with himself, Marc 7 and Cut Chemist. Unity Committee (sans acronym) included a wider range of people, including Marvski, Json/Son Doobie, as well as Volume 10 and Dark Leaf. When it came down to lyrical subject matter as the group came together as a threesome, Chali states, “We were trying to be the exact opposite of the gangsta rap movement at the time. We weren’t pro-Black since we had a white guy in the group. But I would definitely say we were ‘pro-right.’ We were conscious rappers.”\n\nMarc 7, who says he met Cut Chemist through Marvski, explains, “Unity Committee was a movement. We did a lot of stuff together, starting with going to Lucas’ [Cut Chemist’s] house to listen to music.” He adds, “Son Doobie was an original member of the group, we used to run together. It ended up with me and Chali as MCs, but we had more people in our extended crew.”\n\nFive miles away, in South Central Los Angeles, another faction of the Jurassic 5 was incubating at Manual Arts High School: The Rebels of Rhythm. The Rebels would give the J5 Akil and Soup [aka Zaakir], who met in high school around 1987. They also included a third MC, Shawny Mac [aka Afrika], who rhymed with them through the early 1990s. Akil and Afrika were on the mic first; Soup came in with bars a little later on. The crew also included breakdancers and graffiti writers. Akil produced the group’s early demos.\n\nAkil describes his early years: “I was in South Central until my mid-20s. I came from right where the [1992] Riots started, Florence and Normandie. Hip-hop came when I was a teenager. I used to pop and lock and do the robot. I have always been an entertainer.” His father was a DJ for neighborhood gatherings (“More of a selector than a DJ, really,” Akil says, “He didn’t speak on the mic. He made reel-to-reel tapes that he would play at parties.”), and a neighbor’s brother was a more serious cut-and-scratch DJ.\n\nAkil even considered going into the service at one point. “But by the late 80s, I had turned to MCing,” he explains. “Conscious groups like Public Enemy had come out. I wasn’t trying to be in the Army at that point, I chose to pursue hip-hop.”\n\nThe Rebels of Rhythm, still featuring Shawny, made a two-song cassette in 1992 that was printed up in a very limited batch and sold at gigs. It contained two songs: “Jessica” and “Da Rhythm.” The group’s uniqueness sprang from their combination of socially-conscious, positive rhymes and a true throwback vocal style. “Our content was different,” Akil explains. “Zaakir tried to sing a bit. We harmonized. We had a great live show, like Unity Committee, and we loved the same hip-hop — the classic stuff.”\n\nZaakir — alternately known as Soup, a teenage nickname — also grew up in South Central, and also had a music-loving father. Drawn to funk at an early age (“When I was five, I was obsessed with ‘The Funky Worm’ by the Ohio Players,” he says), he switched his allegiance to rap by the time Fatback Band’s “King Tim III (Personality Jock)” and the Sugarhill Gang entered his eardrums. “It was a lightbulb for me,” he explains. “From then on out, if it was hip-hop, I was on it.”\n\nBesides his love of music, Soup’s experience in the music industry would help the Jurassic 5 in various ways as they began to get more serious. Starting as an unpaid intern with Loud Records after high school, he went on to do college promotions at Immortal Records, Loud (for a second stint) and then Interscope. It was experience that would be useful to the group, since they started off releasing their own records. “The connections I had definitely helped once we started,” he says. “I got our stuff charted on college radio. The funny thing was that most of the people I knew and eventually talked to about Jurassic 5 didn’t even know I rhymed and was in a group.”\n\nThroughout the late 80s, Soup was always around the Rebels of Rhythm, but he didn’t dream of being an MC. “Originally, I didn’t want to rhyme,” he says. “I was into singing. So I wasn’t an original MC in the Rebels of Rhythm. I wanted to be a hype man, if anything. But Akil heard me freestyling at a show and he wanted me to rhyme more. So I gradually got better.”\n\nThe third and final faction of the Jurassic 5 was a solitary one: DJ Nu-Mark. Growing up in North Hollywood and eventually residing in Mid-City and Silver Lake, Mark was a drummer by age 12, playing in the jazz band at school and entering drum battles in junior high. He recalls, “I had a friend in junior high, Chris Cook, he was a bassist. He was really into hip-hop and his uncle was a DJ, so that combination completely spun my head around. Once I started hearing hip-hop samples and drum programming, the rock breaks I was trying to imitate on drums just didn’t seem so bad-ass anymore.”\n\nBy 9th grade, Nu-Mark had bought a Roland TR-606 drum machine, invested in dual belt-drive turntables, and had started digging for records to scratch and — eventually — sample. He also joined a DJ crew called Bumrush Productions. Money earned with Bumrush allowed him to upgrade to the industry standard: Technics 1200s. “We did a lot of house parties and some clubs,” he recalls. “That’s where I cut my teeth.”\n\nOn the DJ front, his drumming experience yielded a predictable result: “I always gravitated to more rhythmic records, and I scratched in a more rhythmic way than other DJs.” By the early 90s, he had left his jazz and rock drumming dreams behind. “Hip-hop was just raw to me,” he explains. “Rock wasn’t. [TR-] 808 beats were raw, Melle Mel was raw. I couldn’t go back to being a rock or jazz drummer at that point.”\n\nMark, like most Angelenos raised in the 1980s, also cites KDAY as a huge influence. He says, “Those DJs defined what it meant to be a selector. They took chances with the music they played. KDAY just spoke to L.A. And it really revealed hip-hop culture to people.”\n\nSome histories of the Jurassic 5 have stated that they first came together at the famed Good Life — a weekly, Thursday night MC and poetry gathering held at a health food store in South Central, starting in late 1989. That is partially true. In reality, all six of them first met at a lesser-known club night called Rat Race. Either way, Good Life and the atmosphere that it created held the most influence over them as they became an entity in 1994.\n\nNu-Mark explains, “Being there at Rat Race was a good example of me being in the right place at the right time. It was a night that moved around to different small spots, a lot of people wouldn’t even remember it. It combined a live band with MCs that they would invite. I was the DJ. And because of that, I finally met MCs who knew as much about hip-hop as I did, like Soup. It was the last piece of the puzzle for me.”\n\nNu-Mark also recalls, “The first time I met Luke [Cut Chemist] was also at Rat Race. He called me ‘DJ Hendrix’ because I was scratching with a wah-wah pedal. [Laughs]. That’s where I met all of the guys, even though I think they had met each other previously at Good Life.”\n\nAkil says, of Rat Race, “Bigga B was part of that night, he picked different MCs he thought were tight enough to perform with a live band. He used us [Rebels of Rhythm], Unity Committee, Medusa and some other people. We rehearsed for Rat Race at a spot on Pico in South Central, across from Roscoe’s Chicken & Waffles, right near where we took the cover photo for Quality Control.”\n\nWhile Rat Race was more rooted in the fly-by-night nightclub culture, the Good Life carried its weight as a weekly event and meeting ground that lasted for over five years. “We may have all eventually met and worked together if it wasn’t for Good Life, but it was a very important place,” states Cut Chemist. He adds, “In the fall of 1991, a friend told me that there was a place in South Central where people were freestyling in a health food store. I couldn’t imagine any way that it could have been dope. When I finally went, after Marc 7 told me I had to, it was amazing. I had never seen anything like it. Freestyle Fellowship and First Brigade with Ganja K and Dr. Bombay were the first artists I saw get up on that stage. It was a life-altering event for me.”\n\nUnity Committee became a popular act at the Good Life, as evidenced by their inclusion on the 1992 compilation Please Pass The Mic (a phrase chanted by the crowd when it was time for a current performer to exit the stage). Alongside artists like Volume 10, Mac-10, Big Al and a young Snoop Doggy Dogg, Unity was featured on two songs, both credited as co-productions but actually solely produced by Cut Chemist: “Who’s Gonna Be The Next Victim” and “The Fish Taste Superb” (with Superb SK). Cut also produced Volume 10’s song on the compilation, “Sho Is Hype (But Not My Type).”\n\nBy 1993, all members of what would become the Jurassic 5 were part of the Good Life world, in varying ways. Nu-Mark wasn’t as frequent of an attendee, since it was much more of a lyricist-centric event, but Unity Committee and Rebels of Rhythm performed as often as they could. “You could only do one song, and you had to get there early to get on the list, because it was only from 8 to 10 pm,” recalls Cut Chemist. “We would make songs during the week just to try them out at Good Life on Thursdays. It was a tough audience. If the people there liked something, it would stick. So we tried a lot of things out there.”\n\nChali 2na adds, “The thing with the Good Life was that everybody who liked each other there would try and work together. It was a meeting place. We [Unity Committee] liked Rebels of Rhythm’s style, because we were both pretty unique amongst that crowd.” Soup says, “Coming out of the Good Life, Unity Committee were the guys we [Rebels of Rhythm] connected with more than anyone else.”\n\nBy 1994, the Rebels of Rhythm had parlayed Soup’s industry connections and their experience at the Good Life into a “demo deal” with Relativity Records. This meant that they weren’t signed to the label, but Relativity had given them money for studio time, in the hopes that they would come up with some signable music. As Akil recalls, their regular DJ (T-Minus) had car trouble and couldn’t do scratches on their 4-song demo. At the last minute they called their Rat Race acquaintance: DJ Nu-Mark.\n\n“Basically, by 1994, all of us were shopping demos separately, and nothing was happening,” Nu-Mark remembers. “Luke [Cut Chemist] brought that beat for ‘Unified Rebelution’ and everything really started to click.”\n\nCut Chemist sums up the lead-in to the true beginning of the J5: “In L.A. there are a lot of styles of rap, but Rebels of Rhythm were unique in how they did what I would call ‘Harmony Rap.’ Sing-songy types of rhymes, like the Force MCs and Cold Crush Brothers. They did it really well. And at the time, I was really digging into a lot of that real old-school, East Coast rap. I said, ‘I could really do something with those guys.’”\n\nMarc 7 compares the two groups: “The common thing that brought Unity Committee and Rebels of Rhythm together was the type of hip-hop that we all liked. Rebels had a very old-school sound. They sounded like they was from the East Coast. That’s what we all loved. When you put us together, it just blended so well. And after we met Nu-Mark at Rat Race, he brought beats by Lucas’ spot and we all just hung out. There was never a time when we said, ‘OK, let’s put Nu-Mark in the group.’ It all just happened.”\n\nCut says, “I was really inspired by De La Soul’s ‘Area,’ off Buhloone Mindstate, and I could finger all the sampled elements that made up the song. The combination of those samples that were rooted in old-school rap was so inspiring to me that I went straight to my drum machine and made the song that would become ‘Unified Rebelution.’ I gave the song to the Rebels of Rhythm and said, ‘Do you think you could maybe also feature my guys [Unity Committee] on it?’ I didn’t even know Rebels very well at that point. I just liked what they did.”\n\nOriginally, all group members agree that “Unified Rebelution” was merely a song that they could all perform together at the Good Life. But after making it, it grew into something much bigger. “We all put the song on our separate demos,” explains Akil. “We still weren’t even a group at the time. We would do shows, and Unity would do that song with us, and they did the same thing when they had a show. So we kept building. When nothing was happening shopping our demos to labels, Cut said, ‘Maybe we should just put that song out ourselves.’ [Author’s note: Cut Chemist says he was influenced by the independent rap movement on the West Coast spearheaded by Good Life pioneers Freestyle Fellowship, who had self-released their debut LP, To Whom It May Concern, in 1991]. Basically we were all fed up with this industry shit.”\n\nBy the end of 1994, five/sixths of the assembled crew [Akil says he was too broke at the time to spare the cash] pooled their resources and pressed up 500 copies on wax. The first edition had a yellow label (and no cover); the second 500 were on light blue. At the bottom, it read: “Performed by Unity Committee & Rebels of Rhythm.” Two songs were produced by Cut Chemist [“Unified Rebelution” and “Lesson 4”] and two by DJ Nu-Mark [“Nu Mark’s Bonus Beats” and the spoken word skit “Quality Control”].\n\nChali says, “We had all been doing demos and trying to make moves with labels, so ‘Unified’ was another way for us to make a splash. It felt different. It just worked. We all felt the power of that song.”\n\nNu-Mark explains, regarding production between the two DJs early in their relationship: “When Luke [Cut Chemist] and I met each other, we looked at the other guy and said, ‘Wow, I can learn a lot from you.’ He had a bassline- and loop-driven production style, and I was more about chopped-up drums.”\n\nThe funky groove and loose-limbed, old-school leaning vocals on the song meshed together perfectly and the single began to get noticed. In fact, it sold as many in Europe as it did in the U.S., distributed overseas by the popular Mr. Bongo record shop in London. The attention, as well as a connection via Soup, led the TVT / Blunt label out of New York to sign them to a “single deal.” There was one problem, though: the group name they had on their own 12-inch was way too long and confusing.\n\nAnd so, Jurassic 5 was born. And not in a terribly scientific fashion. Chali 2na explains, “My girlfriend at the time, my son’s mama, is a musician and I played her ‘Unified Rebelution’ to see what she thought. She said, ‘You think you sound like the Fantastic Five [the old-school group featured in the film Wild Style, aka Fantastic Freaks, featuring two DJs and five MCs], but you’re more like the Jurassic Five.’ And she walked away. [Laughs]. I told Marc 7 about it and then everyone eventually agreed on the name, even if it was ‘5’ and we actually had six people in the group.”\n\nAkil adds, “In the movie ‘Jurassic Park,’ they took the DNA from something old, and brought it into modern times. And that’s exactly what we were doing. The name just fit, it was organic.”\n\nThe single, under the name Jurassic 5, was released with a cover (drawn by Chali 2na) on Blunt / TVT in 1995. This edition only had “Unified Rebelution” on it (with Radio/LP/Instrumental/A Cappella versions). “By then, a lot of good things were going on for us,” says Cut Chemist. “By the time the Blunt single came out, we thought of ourselves as one unit. It wasn’t a collaboration anymore, we were a group. We worked on new songs as a group and did shows as Jurassic 5.”\n\nUnfortunately, things didn’t go as expected — or at least hoped — with Blunt. According to several J5 members, the label considered the song to be a “novelty” and didn’t push them. It was a bit of a Catch-22: the song wasn’t selling gangbusters, but the group says Blunt also wasn’t giving it a push. Cut Chemist says, “They kept asking us for new music, but we said we didn’t have any. Although we had been working on new stuff.” Interestingly, one of their new, secret songs was called “No Promotion,” and was about their situation. It was never released.\n\nAs a side note, by 1995 Nu-Mark was doing college promotions and A & R for the newly-minted label Correct Records, who put out artists including Al’Tariq [aka Fashion from the Beatnuts], Mannish and Black Attack. By 1997, the label was defunct, but Nu-Mark gained a great deal of industry experience with the label, which in some ways mirrored Soup’s own work in the music business.\n\nNu-Mark recalls, about the second go-around with “Unified Rebelution,” “When Blunt came along, the other guys were all excited, but I wasn’t. I wanted to stay on our own and wait for something better. I didn’t even sign the original Blunt contract, even though I was doing shows with them. I felt like there were bigger things in store for us. In the end, they didn’t promote us right and didn’t believe in us, long term.”\n\nLike “Unified Rebelution,” the EP and Jurassic 5 album were also recorded at Cut Chemist’s childhood home (aka Red October). The reason was simple: familiarity and comfort. “We stayed there even through some of Quality Control because it was the last bit of innocence we had left,” says Nu-Mark. “People and labels started wanting a piece of our pie. They wanted to pull us out of our element. At the same time, we didn’t want to pay for studio time when we were just laughing and goofing around. The sound quality at Lucas’ spot wasn’t always crackin’, dynamically, but it was enough. The music was there. It was the vibe.”\n\nSoup explains, “Red October was just where it all started. It was like our first girlfriend, on the recording side. We got our first experience there. Plus, it was free. Lucas’ mom was so great, she was on the team. Even when we got more immersed in the game and things changed, we still always loved being there.”\n\nAside from Soup’s and Nu-Mark’s industry gigs to help pay their own bills as Jurassic 5 grew, Cut Chemist and Chali had their own side gig: the popular Latin/rock group Ozomatli. Both men joined up in the mid-90s with the dynamic live band, which was led by bassist Wil-Dog Abers. They first met Wil around 1991, when Unity Committee was experimenting with using live players. Cut Chemist became the group’s DJ, and Chali was their rapper. Both are featured on “The Cut Chemist Suite,” a single off Ozomatli’s self-titled debut album from 1998 (Almo / Interscope).\n\nCut and Chali were gone from Ozomatli by 1999 — Cut Chemist says he left first during the 1998 Vans Warped Tour, handing over his tour duties to DJ Z-Trip. Chali held out longer, touring with the group until J5 duties could not be juggled concurrently anymore. He recalls, “I don’t think Lucas signed the Ozomatli contract, even though he was always there. I had a son, so I signed it, I wanted that stability. And as long as the Ozomatli stuff didn’t interfere with Jurassic 5, I was down. Overall it didn’t interfere. It was a great experience.”\n\nAs evidenced by the multiple pressings and labels with Jurassic 5, by 1998 it was undeniable that the group had something unique going on. In fact, they had been there for a year or two by the time Interscope came calling to sign them for their actual debut album. “The U.K. embracing the EP is really what established us,” says Nu-Mark. “By 1998 we were playing to 12,000 people at festivals in Europe. It was all happening by then.”\n\nAkil adds, “Around that time we met Grandmaster Caz and Charlie Chase [from The Cold Crush Brothers] and Dot-A-Rock [from Fantastic Five], and they sanctioned us with what we were doing. They loved it, and that gave us a lot of energy to keep going.”\n\nSpeaking of energy, the group built the loyal fan base it still retains today by more than just skillful vocals and excellent music. Their live show was one of the best in the rap game, and outdid many rock groups as well. “We definitely rehearsed more than our peers,” says Cut Chemist. “We felt like we had to. We were inspired by hip-hop artists who always impressed their fans. Doug E. Fresh coming out of a pyramid. LL Cool J coming on stage out of a huge radio. Plus at the Good Life, you had to come correct or you’d get ushered off the stage.”\n\nHe adds, “A lot of the reason that we crossed over and had the appeal we did was because of our live show, plain and simple. We entertained, and that got us on the bill for a lot of unique shows. Honestly, we connected with non-hip-hop artists more than with hip-hop ones. Indie and artsy rock people really liked us. We toured with Green Day and Fiona Apple. How many other hip-hop groups did that?”\n\nBy 1998, as Jurassic 5 continued to sell very respectably (especially for an old-school leaning, positive and intelligent group), their next stage was set. Interscope first came into the picture by re-releasing the song “Improvise” that year, a song which was originally done to extend the Jurassic 5 EP into an LP. Other labels were courting the group, but there were a couple reasons that Jurassic 5 went with Interscope. First, Ozomatli was distributed by Interscope, so Cut Chemist and Chali knew some of the people there, and approved. (Soup says that his previous Interscope tenure didn’t influence him either way).\n\nJust as importantly, Interscope allowed the group to keep the vinyl rights to the album (which they licensed to Rawkus Entertainment in 2000). Unsurprisingly, a group with two DJs found that very appealing. “That was major to us,” says Cut Chemist. “For us back then, in the independent, Fat Beats era, that was important.”"
