        "text": "Funkdoobiest\n\nFunkdoobiest is a Latin rap group from Los Angeles, California. The original members are Son Doobie (Jason Vasquez), a Puerto Rican rapper, and DJ Ralph M (Ralph Medrano), a Chicano DJ, and Tomahawk Funk (Tyrone Pacheco) of the Lakota nation. He left after their second album due to the fact he became a family man. Their first two albums were mainly produced by Cypress Hill's DJ Muggs. Their third and so far last album, \"The Troubleshooters\", included production by Ralph M and DJ Rectangle."
