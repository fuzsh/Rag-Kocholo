        "text": "Tina Weymouth is a bassist and producer who is best known as a member of Talking Heads and the Tom Tom Club. She has also worked with Happy Mondays, Ziggy Marley, Ian Dury, Nona Hendryx, the Soup Dragons and the Gorillaz. In 1977, she married Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz. They live in Fairfield, Connecticut and have two sons, Robin and Egan. Here’s part of her story.\n\nTalking Heads – Life During Wartime >>1979<<\n\n“This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco!”\n\nDavid Byrne and drummer Chris Frantz formed “The Artistics” in 1974. Tina Weymouth was Frantz’s girlfriend and would drive them to gigs. They had all gone to school at the Rhode Island School of Design. They moved to New York City and began looking for a bass player. Without luck, Frantz began coaxing Wymouth to learn how to play bass by listening to Suzi Quatro albums (video). They played their first gig opening for the Ramones at CBGB in 1975. Tina had grown up learning guitar from Bob Dylan songbooks and had spent two years in an English handbell-ringer group, so the furthest thing from her mind was being in a loud, New Wave band. She believed that once they found a bass player, she would leave the group.\n\nI began putting five dollars a week down on a bass at We Buy Guitars on 48th Street, and when I finally paid it off, Chris and David began working with me. Chris was very encouraging and supportive; it was occasionally weird to have your boyfriend yelling at you, but he was always a great, um… egger-onner. And David was marvelous in that he was so hard on me; he had no patience whatsoever.\n\nTalking Heads were signed to Sire records in 1977 and built a following with albums like More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979) and Remain in Light (1980).\n\n“Life During Wartime” appeared on Fear of Music and on Talking Heads’ live album Stop Making Sense (1983).\n\nThe song’s lyrics tell of a civil insurrection in the USA (the cities Houston, Detroit and Pittsburgh are mentioned by name) with the singer commenting on various activities involving an apparent guerrilla movement. (“Transmit the message, to the receiver / hope for an answer some day / I got three passports, a couple of visas / you don’t even know my real name.”) The singer laments that due to having to live underground, he can’t go to night clubs. The now-defunct downtown New York clubs Mudd Club and CBGB are mentioned by name. A phrase from the lyrics, “This ain’t no party / This ain’t no disco”, became a catchphrase in the Punk rock and New Wave music genres.\n\nIn David Bowman’s book This Must Be the Place: The Adventures of Talking Heads in the Twentieth Century, Byrne is quoted as describing the genesis of the song: “I wrote this in my loft on Seventh and Avenue A.” And later, “I was thinking about Baader-Meinhof. Patty Hearst. Tompkins Square. This a song about living in Alphabet City.”\n\nBrian Eno produced Fear of Music and they began to rely heavily on their rhythm section, adding flourishes of African-styled polyrhythms. You can hear this especially in the Stop Making Sense version. By this time, they had added several sidemen, including a horn section, leaving them free to explore their dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics.\n\nBasses used include:\n\nHöfner 500/2 Club Bass — Two pickup with single-cutaway hollowbody, purchased in 1978.\n\nVeillette-Citron Standard 4 String — Neck Through, teal green.\n\nFender Mustang Bass — Used in early Talking Heads performances.\n\nSteinberger L-Series Bass — Seen during Little Creatures period\n\nFender Jazz Bass — Used for Tom Tom Club live performances.\n\nFender Swinger — Seen in Stop Making Sense during the performance of “This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody).”\n\nDavid Byrne is a true musical genius but as musical geniuses go, they can be difficult under the best of circumstances. Tina:\n\nTrying to understand what was going on in David’s head was never easy, and he was never able to articulate what he was doing. So I just broke down everything he did into very basic components–sections and segments–and then pieced them back together like a puzzle. I figured if he was going to play these really edgy parts, I should do something contrapuntal. I didn’t see the point in just playing root notes in unison, especially since I felt there was something missing in the midrange of our little trio.\n\n[L]et’s just say I offered to leave the band several times if he thought it would help. But he’s very strange, and whenever I offered what I thought he said he wanted, he didn’t want it.\n\nHe’s a very controlling person, and it wasn’t until our third record, Fear of Music, that I just said, “David, leave me alone. Please!” I never minded what Chris would tell me, because even though he could make me mad as hell [laughs], we could communicate and work it out. But with David it’s all or nothing–total aggression or total meekness. So I always tried to act like a very gentle older sister with him. I could yell at Chris, but I could never yell at David. I often kept Chris from punching David, which I now regret because I think David could have used a good spanking [laughs].\n\nBut isn’t that just the way it is in bands? They’re so difficult to understand, yet once you all start playing music together, everything else drops away. It’s strange. I do still love David; I just wish he loved us (Full interview).\n\nDespite David Byrne’s lack of interest in another album, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, and Jerry Harrison reunited for a one-off album called No Talking, Just Head under the name The Heads in 1996. The album featured a number of vocalists, representing some of the most distinctive voices of ’80s and ’90s alternative rock, including Debbie Harry of Blondie, Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, Andy Partridge of XTC, Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes, Michael Hutchence of INXS, Ed Kowalczyk of Live, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Richard Hell, and Maria McKee. The album was accompanied by a tour which featured Johnette Napolitano as the vocalist. Byrne took legal action against the rest of the band because of “The Heads” abbreviation—something he saw as “a pretty obvious attempt to cash in on the Talking Heads name.”\n\nThe band played “Life During Wartime”, “Psycho Killer” and “Burning Down the House” together on March 18, 2002, at the ceremony of their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, however reuniting for a concert tour is unlikely. David Byrne states: “We did have a lot of bad blood go down. That’s one reason, and another is that musically we’re just miles apart.” Weymouth has been critical of David Byrne, describing him as “a man incapable of returning friendship” and that he doesn’t “love” her, Frantz, and Harrison.\n\nIt’s difficult to choose one Talking Heads song to highlight. I chose “Life During Wartime” from Stop Making Sense because it’s representative of their middle-career output and the live performance highlights Tina’s participation in the group.\n\nTom Tom Club – Genius of Love >>1981<<\n\n“What you gonna do when you get out of jail? I’m gonna have some fun!”\n\nThe Tom Tom club was such a great artistic outlet for Tina and Chris. By the early to mid-eighties, David Byrne was exerting more and more control over the Talking Heads. Tom Tom Club was originally a side project and was a loose collaboration of musicians, producers and engineers. Named after the dancehall in the Bahamas where they rehearsed for the first time while on hiatus from Talking Heads in 1980, Tom Tom Club enjoyed early success in the dance club culture of the early 1980s with the hits “Genius of Love” and “Wordy Rappinghood.”\n\nTom Tom Club was intended solely to support me and Chris–to put food on the table. We had no money, and we decided to work up our own songs instead of accepting the session work we were being offered.\n\nThey have the distinction of producing one of the most-sampled songs of all time, “Genius of Love.” L’Trimm, MC Redman andFunkdoobiest have all used it. Mariah Carey scored a hit with the riff in her single “Fantasy”. “It’s Nasty” (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five was one of the early hip-hop versions of the song, however the sample was re-recorded by a live band rather than just taken from the original recording, as was common practice at the time. Another version, “Genius Rap” (1981), by Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde, was the first cover version. Max B also sampled “Genius of Love” in his single “Get Outta Jail”\n\nListen, I want people to know this: I wrote the part, but I had to get someone else to play it at the last minute. We were given extremely limited studio time–just three days–and when it was time to do that track my whole right arm seized up in a terrible cramp, and I couldn’t play. I had never played in the studio around the clock like we were doing, so I didn’t even know that could happen. I ended up waking the assistant engineer–he was asleep under the console–and I showed him the part, and he played it. Chris was mad, but I really couldn’t play; my hand wouldn’t even close. So we did what we had to do. These things happen.\n\nThe eighties were the period of Tom Tom Club’s greatest success but Tina and Chris still perform and have put out music periodically.\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Funky, was released in 2000 and featured cover versions of songs, including Donna Summer’s “Love to Love You Baby”. One of the album’s tracks, “Who Feelin’ It”, was also featured in remixed form in the soundtrack album of the 1999 film American Psycho.\n\nA complete live concert was released in 2003 on the double CD Live @ the Clubhouse, recorded at Tom Tom Club’s regular hide-out studio, the Clubhouse in Connecticut in front of an audience of fifty guests. Tom Tom Club has been doing incidental live shows since.\n\nIn 2007, the band released a special Christmas single called “Mistletunes”, containing two specially recorded Christmas songs: “Il est Ne” and “Christmas in the Club”, which features Mystic Bowie and scratcher/turntableist Kid Ginseng (Weymouth and Franz’s son). The single was released by Dutch indie label La La Land Records, which was founded by the former Tom Tom Club merchandise crew.\n\nIn an interview, Tina was told that Kim Gordon once touted a belief that a woman’s instinctively supportive nature lends itself to bass more than, say, aggressive lead guitar.\n\nThat’s a very interesting point of view. I don’t know that it holds for all individuals, but it says so much about Kim, as a person and how she feels about her band. Hmmm–I think women are nurturing and supportive in bands, and as for bass, your role is totally one of support. That’s why I find it obnoxious to sing and play at the same time, because when I’m singing it doesn’t feel like the bass player is there for me. It’s just not the same.\n\nRather than the music video, I’ve included a live performance from just a few years ago. I believe you can see and hear the energy of the collective musicians and D.J.s. It’s obvious though Tina and Chris are moving from their fourth to fifth decade, their enthusiasm has not waned.\n\nFurther Listening\n\nThe Heads – Damage I’ve Done (vocals by Johnette Napolitano)\n\nA few artists that have been produced by Tina:\n\nZiggy Marley – Tomorrow People\n\nSoup Dragons – I’m Free\n\nHappy Mondays – Stinkin’ Thinkin’\n\nGorillaz – 19-2000 (Tina provides vocals on this track)"
