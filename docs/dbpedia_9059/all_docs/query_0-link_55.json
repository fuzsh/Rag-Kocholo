        "text": "Music On Vinyl (2017, Reissue)\n\nEvery Wednesday, in honor of Ed Lover Dance Day from Yo! MTV Raps, I take a break from rock and roll to write a little bit about hip hop. In the late 80s and early 90s hip hop ruled my musical life. During this often called 'Golden Era' I discovered so much incredible music. As I am slowly replacing the CDs I've had for twenty-five plus years with vinyl copies, I'm going to talk about some albums that had a really important impact on me during some very formative years.\n\nAt the height of my Cypress Hill fandom I was buying pretty much anything that I could get my hands on, even if it was only peripherally attached to them. Funkdoobiest checked that box as they were part of the DJ Muggs Soul Assassins crew. It's why I bought the House of Pain album when that came out as well. That said, House of Pain does not hold up, where with Funkdoobiest, I actually like them more now than I did in 1993.\n\nSo it must be acknowledged that this album is definitely an acquired taste. The beats are excellent, full of funky bass lines and excellent percussion. The sample choices are impeccable and if you just handed this album of beats to Cypress Hill and had them rap on it instead, it would likely be considered a classic LP. Problem is, they gave the beats to Son Doobie, a goddamn weirdo. His flow is borderline awful and if you think EPMD over use the \"I'm _____ like ______\" rhyme structure, you haven't heard anything until you witness Son Doobie use this line twenty times in every single song.\n\nHis flow is stilted, nasally and the rhymes are just really bad in places, but for whatever reason there's something kind of charming about the way the entire package comes together. You end up liking it because of how ridiculous it is. Many people heard this record and it was green lighted all the way through a major label release. I can't fathom how no one stepped in and said. \"wait, this guy?\" but alas, 1993 on Epic records. I bought it then, and I've bought the LP now. But as I said earlier, I appreciate this record much more now. What it comes down to is that it's just fun. Fun beats, dumb lyrics and a laid back vibe. Good enough."
