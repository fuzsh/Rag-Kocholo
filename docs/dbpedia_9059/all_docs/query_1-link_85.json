He was fascinated by the turntable and his dream was to become a Mixmaster on KDAY, a famous Los Angeles radio station. When he was thirteen, he received that opportunity which was an inspirational and educational moment for him. DJ Ralph M is best known as the DJ and producer for Funkdoobiest as well as working with Chicano hip-hop legend Kid Frost. Also known as DJ Mixican and DJ Ralph \"Tha Funky Mexican\" Medrano, he mixed on several releases with Funkdoobiest including their 1992 album Which Doobie U B?, which includes their hit single “Bow Wow Wow.”"
