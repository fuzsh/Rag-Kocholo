Justin Timberlake has done all right for himself since his Mickey Mouse club beginnings. The multihyphenate’s various resume highlights—boy band megastardom via NSYNC, a stretch of time as a solo pop music sensation throughout the 2000s and 2010s, celebrated turns on the big screen in films like The Social Network, as well as considerable comedic chops as seen in SNL and Bad Teacher—have all contributed to making him a $250 million dollar man, per Celebrity Net Worth’s accounting. The pop culture phenomenon is looking to add $10 million to that figure with the potential sale of his Franklin, Tennessee property, according to Realtor.com.

Timberlake’s 127-acre property is located approximately 20 miles from Nashville, where his bar and restaurant is situated. It’s also about a three-hour drive from the superstar’s birthplace, Memphis. He purchased the plot in 2015 for $4 million, so he stands to net a solid profit if he’s able to make a deal around that eight-figure asking price. The seller was Aubrey Preston, a local philanthropist and preservationist who owned roughly 244 acres in the area at the time.

The property is in the picturesque village of Leipers Fork and reportedly comes with a few limitations regarding development, due to a conservation agreement in place via a state land trust. But given the area is a rancher’s dream, with horse trails snaking through lush wooded areas, mountain views, a creek, and expansive pastures for riding, perhaps the right buyer will find that not much development is necessary to make the most of the land.

The “Cry Me a River” singer has downsized somewhat in recent years. In 2021, Timberlake and his wife, actor Jessica Biel, parted ways with their Hollywood Hills home. They sold their Tribeca penthouse for $21 million the following year.
