It will be called the \"Forget Tomorrow World Tour.\"\n\nPremium members of Justin Timberlake's fan club, called Tennessee Kids or TN Kids, can enjoy his upcoming tour with exclusive fan deals. Members of the fan club pay a yearly fee to enjoy these perks.\n\nConcert tickets will be made available to premium fan club members through Ticketmaster and they will have access to these tickets before the general public starting Monday Jan. 29.

The tickets will automatically show up in all Ticketmaster accounts the morning of the concert.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra"
