        "text": "A memorial service will be held today for political consultant Joseph R. Cerrell, who played a key role in the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy and founded a Los Angeles-based public affairs firm that bears his name.\n\nCerrell died Friday in Camarillo, near his beach home in Oxnard, following complications from pneumonia, his family said. He was 75.\n\nDuring a career spanning more than five decades, Cerrell played key roles in the presidential campaigns of Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Hubert H. Humphrey, Lloyd Bentsen, John Glenn and Al Gore.\n\nAs the founder of Los Angeles-based Cerrell Associates Inc., he built a public affairs firm known for political campaign management and public relations and public affairs services to corporate and nonprofit clients.\n\n“Joe was a larger-than-life figure in California politics and public affairs for the past half-century, beginning as a USC College Democrat and building a career in which he was an advisor to presidents, governors and political figures at all levels,” said Hal Dash, chairman and CEO of Cerrell Associates.\n\n“His legacy as a counselor, confidante and close friend to thousands of people in politics, the business community, as well as in the public relations and nonprofit arenas, especially the Italian-American community in Los Angeles, will not be forgotten.”\n\nMayor Antonio Villaraigosa called Cerrell “an icon in Democratic politics.”\n\n“From an early age, Joe understood that democracy demands the participation of people from all walks of life,” Villaraigosa said. “He was a sage mentor and trusted advisor who unselfishly shared his good counsel and firsthand memories of historic moments.”\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a Republican who served with Cerrell on the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission in the early 1980 s, said Cerrell’s “sense of fairness and generosity earned him the admiration and respect of leaders of all political stripes at all levels of government.”\n\nFormer City Councilman Nate Holden said “all who knew Joe knows that he was a man or character, ethics and he could be trusted.”\n\n“Joe would always let you know that no matter which side of the issue he was on, that he would remain your friend,” Holden said.\n\nCerrell’s political career began in the 1950 s at USC, where he started the Trojan Democratic Club on a campus known at the time for its Republican activism.\n\nHis political savvy soon caught the eye of Jesse M. Unruh, leading to a position on his state Assembly campaign and later on the staff of Attorney General Edmund G. Brown, when he ran for his first term as California governor in 1958.\n\nAfter Brown won, Cerrell was approached again by Unruh, who had become Assembly speaker, to run the California Democratic Party. At just 24, Cerrell was the youngest person ever to do so.\n\nThat experience led Cerrell to the Kennedy presidential campaign, where he became California campaign manager, directing all operations in the state.\n\nIt was on the Brown campaign that Cerrell met Lee Bullock, whom he married in 1963. The couple celebrated their 47 th wedding anniversary Nov. 17.\n\nCerrell helped to create modern political consulting, said Professor Ann N. Crigler, chair of the Department of Political Science at USC.\n\n“He was an early full-service political consultant who successfully navigated the transition to today’s more specialized consulting practices,” Crigler said. “He shared his expertise and enthusiasm with hundreds of students over the years and inspired them to get involved in politics at many levels. This gift was institutionalized with his instrumental role in bringing the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics to USC.”\n\nBorn Joseph Cerrella in Queens on June 19, 1935, the son of a New York City fireman and a campaign worker who would later work for Unruh in Sacramento, Cerrell reveled in his New York roots.\n\nIn 1941, Cerrell’s parents dropped the “a” from Cerrella so their son could escape anti-Italian discrimination during World War II.\n\nHe became extremely proud of his Italian-American heritage, energetically promoting the contributions of Italian-Americans in Los Angeles and around the world.\n\nCerrell was an alumnus of both Los Angeles High School and USC, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in 1957. In 1979 he returned to USC as an adjunct instructor, teaching for 15 years at the Unruh Institute.\n\nHe was a distinguished visiting professor in political science at Pepperdine University in Malibu from 1996 to 2004.\n\nA resident of Hancock Park for more than 50 years, Cerrell relocated his firm to nearby Larchmont Boulevard in 1980.\n\nAs a board member of the California Museum of Science and Industry — now the California Science Center — he was responsible for getting the IMAX Theatre built in time for the 1984 Olympic Games.\n\nAs a member of the Coliseum Commission, Cerrell worked with team owner Donald T. Sterling to help bring the Clippers to Los Angeles in 1984 and was part of the team that brought the Oakland Raiders to the Coliseum.\n\nCerrell is survived by his wife Lee, of Oxnard and Los Angeles; his son Steve Bullock, CFO of Cerrell Associates, and daughter-in-law Irina Bullock of Burbank; his daughter Sharon Cerrell Levy and son-in-law Matthew Levy, of Sherman Oaks; his son Joe Cerrell, director of the European Office for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and daughter-in-law Sara Grote Cerrell, of London and Seattle; and his former daughter-in-law Tara Bullock, of Van Nuys; along with his seven grandchildren.\n\nA public memorial service will be held at 10:30 a.m. at Christ the King Roman Catholic Church, 624 N. Rossmore Ave.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asked that donations be made to USC’s Unruh Institute, to benefit the “Joseph R. Cerrell Center Circle Scholarship” that allows students in need to attend semester-long study programs in Washington, D.C., and Sacramento."
