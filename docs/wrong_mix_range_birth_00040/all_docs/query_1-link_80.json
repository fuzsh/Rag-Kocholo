        "text": "Justin Timberlake said “bye, bye, bye” to Los Angeles following all the bombshells his ex-girlfriend Britney Spears dropped in her new memoir.\n\nThe former *NSYNC frontman, 42, was seen touching down in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in photos obtained by DailyMail.com Monday.\n\nThe musician was snapped exiting a private jet wearing a white graphic T-shirt, gray joggers, white sneakers, a matching baseball cap and sunglasses resting atop the hat’s brim.\n\nHe smiled as he made his way from the plane to a golf cart with his youngest son, 2-year-old Phineas, in his arms.\n\nAccording to the outlet, Timberlake is in town for a family vacation, so his wife, Jessica Biel, and their eldest son, 8-year-old Silas, were likely in close proximity.\n\nThe images mark the “Mirrors” crooner’s first public sighting since Spears’ tell-all, “The Woman in Me,” was released.\n\nIn fact, Timberlake recently disabled the comments sections across his entire Instagram account amid backlash from angry fans.\n\nA source previously told Page Six that he made the decision because of the “hateful, disgusting things people were saying” on his posts.\n\nSince then, critics have turned their sights to Biel, as many have begun dropping negative remarks beneath her uploads.\n\nThe actress, 41, responded by limiting the comments that can be left on her page.\n\nIn Spears’ book, she details the three-year relationship she had with Timberlake from 1999 to 2002.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nAccording to the Princess of Pop, she had an abortion while dating the “Cry Me a River” singer because he “didn’t want to be a father.”\n\nThe “Toxic” songstress recalled “sobbing” during the “excruciating” procedure, which she was forced to endure at home due to privacy concerns.\n\nSpears also claimed Timberlake cheated on her “a couple of times” while they were together.\n\nShe further accused him of using a blaccent when speaking to black artists.\n\nNeither Timberlake nor Biel — whom he wed in October 2012 — have addressed the allegations; however, he’s reportedly “not at all happy.”\n\n“Justin has not reached out to Britney at all about any of this, and he is not going to because there is nothing he can say to her,” a source revealed last week, adding that he’s not “OK with it.”\n\nAnother source claimed the publication and its timing ruined the couple’s 11th wedding anniversary."
