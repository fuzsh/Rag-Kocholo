        "text": "The Big Announcement\n\nLet’s start from the very beginning. Timberlake shared the news that Biel was expecting Silas by posting a sweet, candid photo on Instagram. The singer kissed Biel’s pregnant belly and captioned the post:\n\n“Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes! This year, I’m getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN’T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets.”\n\nSilas Randall Timberlake was born April 8, 2015 and was named after Timberlake’s father, Randall.\n\nBaby Number 2\n\nThe couple welcomed their son Phineas in 2020, during the COVID pandemic. In June 2021, Biel shared an update on Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert podcast. “I had, like, a secret COVID baby. It wasn’t like it was supposed to be a secret. It was just COVID happened, and then I went to Montana with my family and never left,” she said.\n\nTimberlake shared the first photo of his youngest on Father’s Day 2021, writing, “Being a dad is better than I ever could have imagined. Thankful to my dads and my grandfathers for leading the way, making the sacrifices for me to live out my dreams, and for teaching me that REAL LIFE happens in all the little moments. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there!!!”\n\nLearning Self-Care\n\nLike all busy parents, Biel struggles with taking time for herself. “I have to admit, I often put myself at the bottom of the totem pole of my family,” Biel told SheKnows at the NYC launch of KinderMed in Nov. 2022, which she co-created with Jeremy Adams. “I’m still working on finding that balance for myself,” she confessed. “I’m not great at it.”\n\nShe added that parenting “sometimes feels like you’re running a marathon and it’s uphill both ways,” and that some days there are moments when it “feels like it’s swallowing you whole.”\n\nWe can definitely relate!\n\nThe Best Halloween Costumes\n\nJessica Biel and Justin Timberlake aren’t regular parents. They’re cool parents. And by that, we mean that the couple happily dressed up as Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall for Halloween, alongside Silas, dressed as Harry Potter, and their 2-year-old son Phineas, who went as Hedwig.\n\n“Last night at MAGIC hour ✨🧙🏻‍♀️” Biel captioned the post. You know the saying — the family who dresses up as various Harry Potter characters stays together.\n\nThe Best Workout Buddies\n\nJustin Timberlake had an adorable addition to his workout routine when he did push-ups with Silas on his back. The video, which was shot by Biel, was impressive to say the least.\n\n“Shaking off those leftovers like… Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! 🎥 @jessicabiel,” Timberlake wrote in 2017.\n\nChristmas Traditions\n\nIn order to make the holidays less “overwhelming,” Biel and Timberlake have special holiday traditions.\n\n“I find that Christmas is kind of overwhelming for kids,” Biel told PEOPLE in Dec. 2022. “It’s a lot of pressure. There’s a lot of eyeballs on them, and they’ve got a lot of stuff to do. So, I like to slow-roll it.”\n\nThey open presents slowly. “Sure, open one thing,” she explained. “We don’t have to open anything else until tonight, and that sometimes happens for us.”\n\nBut where they celebrate the holidays always changes. “We spend Christmas all over the place,” she said. “We never know where we’re going to be. We have no tradition really around it. Sometimes we’re in snow, sometimes we’re by the ocean. We have no rhyme or reason currently as to where we should be or where we’re going to be.”\n\nBeing in the Moment\n\nBiel and Timberlake are both very busy, but when it comes to their kids, they like to stay in the moment.\n\n“You cannot do both at the same time,” Biel said on a Dec. 2022 episode of The Drew Barrymore Show. “When you’re wrestling on the floor, you’re wrestling on the floor. Don’t answer the phone. Don’t look at a work thing. Don’t text somebody. Don’t do any of it. You are wrestling on the floor,” she adds with a laugh.\n\n“That’s what we do in my household. A lot of wrestling,” she added.\n\nSuch good advice!\n\nThe Sweetest Instagram Tributes\n\nYou’ll be hard-pressed to find a celebrity couple who writes declarations quite as sweet on Mother’s and Father’s Day. The two love to pay tribute to one another as parents with loving Instagram posts every year.\n\n“To my husband who I watch with awe everyday as he guides and teaches, encourages and supports, and above all, LOVES the sh*t, out of his own young man,” Biel wrote in 2018.\n\nTimberlake returned the favor on Mother’s Day in 2019. “Jess, you are the glue that holds our family together and I’m so grateful to be your Huz… I LOVE YOU! Every day should be Mother’s Day!!”\n\nReading For Fun AND Value\n\nIn 2018, Biel took to Instagram to share a recommendation for a pop-up book she was reading to Silas that offers a powerful message to young kids. The Color Monster helps children unpack all of their feelings — from happiness to fear — and allows them to have a better understanding of those confusing feelings.\n\n“For #readabookday, I wanted to share The Color Monster by @annallenas!” Biel wrote. “This book helps kids deal with confusing emotions AKA dealing with being a human being. We love it.”\n\nAnd we love a good book with such a helpful message!\n\nTeaching Their Kids Important Life Lessons\n\nAfter the horrific murder of George Floyd in 2020, Timberlake took to Instagram to share that he was teaching his son about discrimination.\n\n“We try to teach our son to love and to respect everyone — we teach him that all people are all created equal, and that no one should be treated differently because of the color of their skin,” the singer wrote in a post. “We teach him this because one day, he will go on to teach his kids the same. It’s a cycle. And right now, as we all work to undo generations of discrimination that have plagued our system and our communities across this country…I’m reminded today that the first lessons start at home.”\n\nKeeping It Real About Parenthood\n\nBiel hasn’t shied away from being honest about the low points of motherhood — which is incredibly refreshing to hear as fellow parents.\n\n“This might sound really terrible, but it’s the truth. Having a child, I have never experienced more emotions in all my life, anger being one of them,” she told The Daily Telegraph in 2017. “Simply put, sometimes your two-year-old makes you crazy.”\n\nYup, a big amen to that!\n\nTheir 10th Anniversary\n\nTimberlake shared the sweetest words to his wife on their 10th anniversary on Oct. 19, 2022, which is a wonderful example to his sons.\n\n“10 years ain’t enough! You make me a better husband and father every day!” he wrote on Instagram. “I love you so much you beautiful human! Run it back!”\n\nShe responded with her own post, writing, “Being married to you is the adventure of a lifetime! Run it back, baby. RUN IT BACK. I love you.”\n\nWhat beautiful tributes of love! Their kids are lucky, indeed."
