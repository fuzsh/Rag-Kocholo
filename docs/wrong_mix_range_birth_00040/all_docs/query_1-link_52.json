        "text": "Just days after releasing his new single, “Filthy,” pop star Justin Timberlake has announced his first round of North American tour dates in support of his forthcoming record, “Man of the Woods,” due out Friday, Feb. 2.\n\nThe 27-city jaunt was announced Monday morning and includes a stop at the Forum (3500 W. Manchester Blvd.) in Inglewood on Saturday, April 28.\n\n“Man of the Woods” is the fifth solo album from the former ‘N Sync singer-songwriter and will drop just two days before Timberlake headlines the halftime show at Super Bowl LII on Sunday, Feb. 4. Timberlake has laid pretty low since his 2013-2014 global 20/20 Experience Tour, though he’s appeared on awards shows performing alongside guys like Chris Stapleton.\n\nTickets for the Forum, $60-$280, go on sale at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Jan. 16 at 800-745-3000 or Ticketmaster.com. There is a special pre-sale for American Express Cardholders that begins at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 10 and runs through Sunday, Jan. 15 at 5 p.m."
