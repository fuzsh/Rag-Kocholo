        "text": "Solo music career and acting roles\n\nDuring his tenure with *NSYNC, Timberlake had cultivated his role as a songwriter, and his breakup with longtime love interest Spears provided the inspiration for a number of songs on his Grammy Award-winning (best pop vocal album) solo debut, Justified (2002), most notably “Cry Me a River” (best male pop vocal performance). In 2003 Timberlake was a guest performer on the Black Eyed Peas’ hit “Where Is the Love?” During the halftime performance of the 2004 Super Bowl, Timberlake was involved in a notorious “wardrobe malfunction” when by design he pulled off part of costar Janet Jackson’s top.\n\nTimberlake’s second solo release, the Prince-influenced FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), features production work by Timbaland and Rick Rubin and earned four Grammy Awards, including best dance recording for “SexyBack,” which spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. During his early solo career, Timberlake was not always treated kindly by critics, but few would argue that his solo work, solidly in the vein of rhythm and blues (R&B) and blue-eyed soul, had not transcended his bubblegum dance-pop origins, and he sold millions of recordings in the process.\n\nHaving earned a reputation as an affable and versatile entertainer, Timberlake began to act in films. His first substantial roles were in the gritty dramas Alpha Dog (2006) and Black Snake Moan (2006). In 2010 he earned accolades for his portrayal of Internet entrepreneur Sean Parker, the cofounder of Napster and the founding president of Facebook, in The Social Network, a fictionalized account of Facebook’s origins. The same year, he provided the voice of Yogi Bear’s diminutive sidekick Boo Boo in Yogi Bear, a movie adaptation of the classic TV cartoon.\n\nTimberlake subsequently starred in the racy romantic comedy Friends with Benefits (2011), the sci-fi thriller In Time (2011), and the online-gambling drama Runner Runner (2013). In addition, he took supporting roles in Bad Teacher (2011), Trouble with the Curve (2012), and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013). For the animated film Trolls (2016), he provided the voice of Branch, one of the title characters, and cowrote the Oscar-nominated song “Can’t Stop the Feeling!”; he reprised the role in Trolls World Tour (2020) and collaborated on several of the film’s songs. In Woody Allen’s Wonder Wheel (2017), Timberlake portrayed a lifeguard on Coney Island during the 1950s who wants to become a playwright. In Palmer (2021) he starred as an former convict who befriends a gender-nonconforming boy. Timberlake gained additional notice for his frequent appearances on Saturday Night Live.\n\nAs Timberlake’s focus remained on acting, his future in music became, for his fans, a subject of anxious speculation. In 2013, however, he mounted a comeback with The 20/20 Experience, a pair of luxuriant song suites that were recorded in collaboration with Timbaland and released six months apart. Boasting both contemporary electronic production and nods toward old-fashioned R&B, The 20/20 Experience found Timberlake sounding relaxed and romantic, particularly on singles such as “Mirrors.” The first volume sold nearly one million copies in the United States in its initial week of release, and each of the two albums (which were also sold as a single package) topped the Billboard album chart. The first album yielded two more Grammys, including best R&B song for “Pusher Love Girl.” In 2018 Timberlake returned to the Super Bowl halftime show in a performance that coincided with the release of the country-inflected Man of the Woods."
