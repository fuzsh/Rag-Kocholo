        "text": "American singer and actress Britney Spears' house is a five-bedroom, eight-bathroom, 13,264-square-foot Neoclassical Italianate home on 21 acres in the Thousand Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The home features a wine cellar, 1,200-square-foot poolside pavilion, and a three-hole golf course, as well as a sweeping view of the Los Angeles skyline. She purchased the house in 2015 for $7.4 million and it is worth an estimated $10 million today. Spears announced in 2022 that she would be moving out of this home and in June of 2022, she and husband Sam Ashgari purchased an 11,000-square-foot mansion in Calabasas for $11.8 million. She has previously owned a $7.5-million home in Westlake Village from 2012-2017, a Hollywood Hills home from 2001-2003 (which she sold to actress Brittany Murphy), a $6.3-million Malibu home that she shared with then-husband Kevin Federline from 2004-2007, a $6.75-million home in Beverly Hills from 2006-2012, and two condos in Greenwich Village, New York which she sold in 2006 and 2011. She also purchased a 7.4-acre property in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana in 1999, where her mother lives to this day.\n\nBritney Spearsâ€™ net worth is $70 million. She has sold more then 100 million albums and her tours have grossed $500 million. She earned as much as $40 million in 2002 alone. From 2013-2017, her Las Vegas concert residency paid her as much as $500 thousand per night. Her perfume brand has generated more than $1.5 billion in revenue.\n\nBritney Spears has been married three times. Her first marriage, to childhood friend Jason Alexander, was annulled. Her second marriage, to Kevin Federline, lasted from 2004-2007. She was married to Sam Ashgari in 2022. She has two children with Federline. During her peak of popularity, she was romantically linked to several other celebrities, including Justin Timberlake, Fred Durst, and Colin Farrell.\n\nHomes - Celebrity - Entertainment - Musicians\n\nLinks: en.wikipedia.org, www.bloomberg.com, www.velvetropes.com, www.architecturaldigest.com, www.forbes.com, www.latimes.com, nypost.com, pagesix.com, www.today.com, robbreport.com, www.priceypads.com, www.foxbusiness.com, www.dailymail.co.uk, www.realestate.com.au, www.luxury-architecture.net, www.thenationalnews.com, www.lonny.com, www.luxury-architecture.net, www.fancypantshomes.com\n\nBy: borlefborlef"
