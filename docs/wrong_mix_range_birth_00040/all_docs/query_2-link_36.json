        "text": "Almost destined for screen, a young Timberlake first appeared on television on The Mickey Mouse Club alongside fresh faced Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Ryan Gosling. In the late 90's, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the lead vocalists in boy band sensation NSYNC, who had major success Stateside and have sold over 50 million albums to date worldwide. Timberlake played a key role in their successes, due to being the youngest member and known as the pin up, he enjoyed performing on some of the world's most prestigious stages including the Super Bowl, The World Series and the Olympic Games at a young age.\n\nDespite him being known as the cause for Janet Jackson's famous wardrobe malfunction during the 2004 Superbowl show, the performer continued on his road to a successful solo career. After his debut album, 'Justified' charted at number two Stateside and number one in the UK, his second release 'Future Sex/Love Sounds' simply elevated his successes. Debuting atop both charts either side of the atlantic, the album has now sold almost six million copies worldwide and spawned three number one singles including 'What Goes Around', 'My Love' and 'SexyBack'.\n\nAfter the huge success of this album, accompanied by a worldwide sell out tour, JT decided to take a break from music to pursue his acting career. Apart from the huge single '4 Minutes', in which he collaborated with the legendary Madonna, Timberlake took a large step back from the industry. During the time he starred in box office hits including 'Bad Teacher', 'Friends With Benefits' and 'The Love Guru' whilst establishing himself as a style icon worldwide.\n\nWith a larger reputation and a slicker style to match his accolades, Justin returned in 2013 with 'The 20/20 Experience', an album which showcased an older soul influence and a more mature pop sound. It spawned platinum selling singles 'Mirrors' and 'Suit & Tie' which featured long-term friend Jay Z. The album topped charts worldwide and JT took a huge show around the world to support the album along with a headline slot at the 2014 V Festival. Justin Timberlake is a class act with an even classier sound."
