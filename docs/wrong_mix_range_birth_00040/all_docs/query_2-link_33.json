        "text": "Justin Timberlake fans, mark your calendars and dust off your dancing shoes because the pop sensation is hitting the road after a five-year hiatus! The former NSYNC member announced his upcoming tour, entitled Forget Tomorrow World Tour, on the heels of his LP’s lead single release called “Selfish” on January 25.\n\nThe multi-talented singer, songwriter, and actor is hitting the stage with his signature blend of pop, R&B, and electrifying dance moves. With songs known for their infectious hooks coupled with Timberlake’s stage presence, the Forget Tomorrow World Tour (which has dates spanning spring and summer in 2024) is set to be the highlight of this year’s live music calendar.\n\nHow to Get Tickets to Justin Timberlake’s Forget Tomorrow World Tour\n\nTickets went on presale on January 29 on for those with JT Fan Club Presale codes. You can also hop on resale sites like StubHub and SeatGeek right now to buy, though most, if not all, will be upcharged from their original price tag.\n\nThe general public can also buy tickets through Timberlake’s official website starting at 10 a.m. on February 2.\n\nDespite Britney Spears’ fans hating on Timberlake after reading her memoir which detailed the pair’s tumultuous breakup and Timberlake’s supposed unfair part in it, many still believe his 2024 concert series will be a highly anticipated one. So, if you’re eyeing tickets, get ready.\n\nJustin Timberlake’s Forget Tomorrow World Tour Dates and Cities\n\nJustin Timberlake’s Forget Tomorrow World Tour is scheduled to kick off this spring. Mark April 29, 2024, as the first show, which hits Vancouver, Canada. Fans from across the United States in cities like Phoenix, Seattle, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Miami, and New York (just to name a few) will also have the opportunity to experience the magic of Timberlake live in concert.\n\nHere are the announced dates:\n\nApril 29, 2024 - Rogers Arena in Vancouver, BC\n\nMay 2, 2024 - Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, WA\n\nMay 6, 2024 - SAP Center at San Jose in San Jose, CA\n\nMay 10, 2024 - T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV\n\nMay 14, 2024 - Pechanga Arena San Diego in San Diego, CA\n\nMay 17, 2024 - Kia Forum in Inglewood, CA\n\nMay 21, 2024 - Footprint Center in Phoenix, AZ\n\nMay 29, 2024 - Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, TX\n\nMay 31, 2024 - Moody Center in Austin, TX\n\nJune 4, 2024 - Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, TX\n\nJune 6, 2024 - BOK Center in Tulsa, OK\n\nJune 10, 2024 - State Farm Arena in Atlanta, GA\n\nJune 12, 2024 - PNC Arena in Raleigh, NC\n\nJune 14, 2024 - Amalie Arena in Tampa, FL\n\nJune 15, 2024 - Kaseya Center in Miami, FL\n\nJune 21, 2024 - United Center in Chicago, IL\n\nJune 25, 2024 - Madison Square Garden in New York, NY\n\nJune 29, 2024 - TD Garden in Boston, MA\n\nJuly 3, 2024 - CFG Bank Arena in Baltimore, MD\n\nJuly 4, 2024 - Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, PA\n\nJuly 7, 2024 - Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, OH\n\nJuly 9, 2024 - Rupp Arena in Lexington, KY\n\nIt's been reported that future tour dates will be announced for the United Kingdom and across Europe.\n\nHow Much You’ll Spend on Tickets for Justin Timberlake’s Forget Tomorrow World Tour\n\nPrices will vary by section, seat, and view.\n\nOn , as far as we can tell, there are VIP packages ranging from $1,099 to $2,192. Non-VIP seats will obviously cost a lot less but will range based on the venue, date, and section.\n\nOn the resale site , for instance, the cheapest Justin Timberlake tickets are going for around $200 in the upper sections.\n\nIf you’re eyeing seats on the floor, you can expect to spend upwards of $2,000 on right now. Keep in mind that these prices will fluctuate up and down based on demand and how resellers strategize.\n\nIf you don’t want to pay top dollar, watch prices from day to day to gauge when's best for you to ultimately purchase.\n\nWhat to Expect at the Forget Tomorrow World Tour\n\nYou can expect to hear Timberlake’s greatest hits along with tracks from his latest album, “Everything I Thought I Was,\" which comes out March 15. His show will offer something for fans of all generations.\n\nYou’ll likely get classics like \"SexyBack,\" \"Cry Me a River,\" and \"Mirrors,\" as well as fresh new tracks that showcase Timberlake's evolution as an artist.\n\nAnd, of course, the tour wouldn't be complete without Timberlake's signature dance moves and ballads. Prepare to be amazed as he and his talented crew light up the stage with their unmatched choreography and energy.\n\nAs far as a mini-reunion where NSYNC joins Timberlake on stage? That's sadly a long shot, but NSYNC fans can certainly dream. We ultimately doubt we’ll see Timberlake with his former bandmates on his tour even though the group had a catchy song (“Better Place”) from the “Trolls Band Together” movie.\n\nHow to Pick the Right Concert Tickets For You\n\nTime to use those filters, JT fans! As you search for seats on ticket sale sites, you'll be able to toggle based on preferences like sections and prices.\n\nAs you select tickets, remember to take note of where the seats are in relation to the stage. To arm yourself with success, you can use AViewFromMySeat.com, which gives you user-generated photos of the venues from previous visits.\n\nHope you get the seats you want! Enjoy the show!"
