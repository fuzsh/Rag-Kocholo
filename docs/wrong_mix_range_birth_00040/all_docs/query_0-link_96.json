        "text": "The theme of “contrast” goes far beyond black and white, to include a wide range of juxtaposed opposites. Contrast typically enhances differences that reflect into one another and create a new meaning. There are sensory contrasts such as color, tone, or texture; and conceptual contrasts, for example: new vs. old, rich vs. poor, raw vs. polished. The contrast may also be cultural, social, sexual or political.\n\nIntake of entries will be: Tue. May 5 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. and Wed. May 6, 6:00 to 8:00 p.m.\n\nArtist reception: Sat. May 9, 1:00 to 3:00 p.m.\n\nPickup of entries: Thur. June 4, 12:30 to 3:30 p.m.\n\nA panel of photographers will judge the entries and award cash prizes. During the exhibit all entries are to be priced for sale. The Art Center collects a fixed commission of 30%.\n\nPhotos must be prepared and ready to hang according to the directions on the entry form. Entry forms can be picked up at the Art Center, or downloaded from the link below. The entry form lists the hanging requirements and other details. A submission fee must accompany the completed entry form. Art Center membership is required. A temporary one month membership is available for $10. Some entries may not be exhibited at the judges’ discretion. The entry fee is not refundable.\n\nThe Ojai Art Center (also known as the Ojai Center for the Arts) is the longest continuously operating multi-disciplinary center serving the arts in the State of California. The concept which became the Art Center was first suggested in 1936 as a means of bringing together five independent and struggling arts organizations in Ojai under one umbrella and one roof.\n\nExhibit Contact: Stephen Adams, ojaiartctr@gmail.com\n\nOjai Art Center, 113 S Montgomery St, Ojai, CA 93023\n\nFor entry form go to: https://www.ojaiartcenter.org/photography.html\n\nPhotograph by Photographer Sally Carless.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Photographer Sally Carless.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Photographer Sally Carless.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Photographer Bob Massey.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Photographer Bob Massey.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Photographer Bob Massey.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Photographer Bob Massey.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nThe Ojai Photography Community opens its 2020 season of monthly events with “The Bald Eagles of Lake Casitas,” presented by wildlife photographers Sally Car-less and Bob Massey on Tuesday, February 18, at 7 p.m. in Help of Ojai’s Kent Hall, 111 Santa Ana Road, Ojai. The event is free and the general public is invited to attend.\n\nThe bald eagle was chosen as the national symbol of the fledgling United States in 1782, representing strength and freedom. Although images of the eagles appeared everywhere in currency and official seals, the real bald eagles in the wild were not treated with the respect given to the symbol. Habitat loss, hunting and pesticides eventually drove them to the brink of extinction, until vigorous conservation efforts and the ban on DDT reversed the trend. After nearly 100 years of absence, bald eagles returned to the Ventura County mainland in 2010, nesting on the shores of Lake Casitas.\n\nCarless was there on her birthday in 2013 to see the very first eagle chicks. They captivated her heart and from that time on she has observed, photographed and filmed the eagle family. Her solo exhibit, “A Year with the Eagles,” appeared in 2014. “It has been a life-changing experience for me to be able to spend time in the company of our local eagles,” Carless says. She will share information, images and short video clips, as well as the intangible moments: her personal experience of healing, the magic of being with the eagles and the depth of friendships made where the eagles nest.\n\nMassey connected with the Lake Casitas eagles through Carless’s exhibit. Since child-hood he had longed to observe bald eagles in the wild and in 2014 his dream became reality. “It has been a journey of love and discovery,” says Massey, “and my images are my attempt to document and pay tribute to one of nature’s finest creatures.” His presentation will include information regarding viewing, life cycle stages, identification and some earmark behaviors. To demonstrate his photography technique, he will discuss one of his eagle shots before and after processing. This will be followed by a few images that will simply show off the majestic beauty of the eagles. Then he will conclude with a couple of minutes of eagle humor.\n\nSally Carless, educator and photographer, sees photography as a way to inspire and help people reconnect with nature, and to remind them of the beauty that surrounds us in every moment. She is the founder and director of Global Village School, now in its twentieth year, an international K-12 homeschool diploma program emphasizing peace, justice, diversity, and sustainability.\n\nBob Massey, retired IT professional and advanced amateur photographer, developed his love of nature and passion for observing animal behavior while growing up in rural New Jersey. An early interest in nature photography went on the back burner during his years of career and marriage. In 2014, inspired by Sally Carless’s exhibit, “A Year with the Eagles,” he decided to re-commit himself to the documentation and celebration of wildlife in photography.\n\nThe Ojai Photography Community, which is devoted to inspiration, camaraderie and education, meets on the third Tuesday of each month, February – November. Monthly free presentations are part of the group’s community service and education outreach.\n\n“Humanizing the Other: Art by Salomón Huerta”\n\nFriday, Nov. 1 – Friday, Jan. 3\n\nKwan Fong Gallery of Art and Culture\n\nAssembled from private collections, this exhibit of work by Salomón Huerta aims to disrupt strictly negative representations of Mexicans and Mexican Americans by offering nuanced portraits. Huerta gained international fame from his paintings of anonymous subjects who are viewed from behind, playing with ideas of identity and viewers’ assumptions. The subjects, their Latino faces and their poses are identifiable, familiar and intimate in this series.\n\nArtwork by Huerta has been shown at influential spaces and events such as Gagosian in London, the Whitney Biennial in New York City, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Hammer Museum and Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles and Studio La Città in Italy. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in illustration from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and his master’s in fine art from UCLA, where he studied under Lari Pittman.\n\nThe Sarah W. Heath Center for Equality and Justice is sponsoring the free exhibit. The gallery, located in Soiland Humanities Center, is open to the public 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday. For more information, contact curator Rachel T. Schmid at 805-493-3697 or visit CalLutheran.edu/kwanfong.\n\n“Key Frames: A Celebration of Animation & Production Art”\n\nFriday, Nov. 8 – Thursday, Jan. 9\n\nWilliam Rolland Gallery of Fine Art\n\nDespite the storied history and undeniable cultural significance of animated\n\nworks, their artistic value remains subject to debate, the more so because of the large commercial industry built around the process. Even when animation is recognized as art, teams of dozens, hundreds or even thousands of artists often go unnoticed and underappreciated.\n\nCurated by S. Mackenzie Eastman, this exhibit celebrates the many artists behind animated\n\nproductions large and small, present and past, big-budget and independent. It invites you to walk through the entire production process, from the earliest concept art to finalized designs, and get to know the diverse range of talents who bring these works to life. It highlights unseen stages of the animation process such as character design, environment art and storyboards.\n\nAdmission is free. The gallery, located in William Rolland Stadium, is open from 10 a.m. to 4\n\np.m. Tuesday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. For more information, contact curator Rachel T. Schmid at 805-493-3697 or rollandgallery@callutheran.edu or visit\n\nCalLutheran.edu/rolland.\n\nSpiritual Bodies: Photography by Carlton Wilkinson\n\nFriday, Jan. 10 – Saturday, Feb. 29\n\nKwan Fong Gallery of Art and Culture\n\nA Lecture with Carlton Wilkinson\n\nThursday, Feb. 13, 6 p.m.\n\nOverton Hall\n\nCarlton Wilkinson has long been fascinated by the arts of the African diaspora.\n\nFor many African Americans, the emotional connection to the continent of Africa has\n\nbeen broken by loss — loss of languages, aesthetics, histories and, most tragically,\n\nancestors and families. The churches depicted in this series played a prominent\n\nrole in the civil rights movement, which brought voices from the African diaspora\n\nto the forefront of the American psyche. This extraordinary collection of intimate\n\nphotographs captures memory, loss, longing and tenderness through a range of\n\nmodels and techniques, serving as a reminder of a great past and an uncertain\n\nfuture.\n\nWilkinson will give a lecture on Feb. 13.\n\nAdmission to the exhibit and lecture is free. The Kwan Fong Gallery, located in Soiland Humanities Center, is open to the public 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday.\n\nFor information, call 805-493-3697 or write to rollandgallery@callutheran.edu.\n\nHistory Lecture Series\n\nAccommodation and Resistance: “The Maasai Respond”\n\nDavid Livingstone\n\nTuesdays, Jan. 14, 7-8:30 p.m.\n\nLundring Events Center\n\nMembers of Cal Lutheran’s history faculty discuss cultural conflicts that come about when opposing worldviews collide in the 2019-2020 series. This lecture focuses on the reaction of the Maasai to European colonialism in Africa.\n\nCal Lutheran and the Thousand Oaks Grant R. Brimhall Library are presenting the free lectures with funding from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation Grant for “Lyceum:\n\nHumanities and Beyond!” For questions, contact Cindy Keitel at ckeitel@callutheran.edu.\n\nMeleko Mokgosi: “Acts of Resistance”\n\nWednesday, Jan. 22 – Thursday, April 9\n\nWilliam Rolland Gallery of Fine Art\n\nIn this installation, Meleko Mokgosi examines formal and informal acts of resistance, placing equal emphasis on both. He defines resistance as any instance where a subject refuses to give in to the oppression of her spirit. While formal resistance takes aim at the state and\n\ninstitutional forces, informal resistance encompasses everyday acts, both conscious and unconscious.\n\nMokgosi’s paintings confront the politics and histories of representation. From a Eurocentric vantage point, black figures are almost always interpreted as representing difference. But in “Acts of Resistance,” Mokgosi compels viewers to give his subjects more complex consideration. Their beautiful attributes, emotional bearing, interrelationships and geographic contexts push away generalizing categories and marginalizing reactions.\n\nBorn in Francistown, Botswana, Mokgosi is an artist, assistant professor of practice\n\nat New York University, and co-director of the Interdisciplinary Art and Theory Program.\n\nHe earned a bachelor’s degree from Williams College in 2007, participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art’s independent study program, and earned a Master of Fine Arts at UCLA’s Interdisciplinary Studio.\n\nAdmission is free. The gallery, located in William Rolland Stadium, is open from 10 a.m.\n\nto 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday.

The free event will be held on November 19, at 7 p.m. in Help of Ojai's Kent Hall, 111 W. Santa Ana St., Ojai. The general public is invited to attend.\n\nWilson has successfully made the transition from the constraints of commercial photog-raphy to the freedom and creativity of fine art. She will reveal the practices that allowed her to straddle the fence into a new artistic vision. Visitors will learn how to take their creativity to the next level through her insights into the steps of becoming an artist and seeing beyond the ordinary. A master of alternative processes, she will discuss what is available today and share her love of combining traditional methods with the endless possibilities of digital technology. “I am passionate about alternative processes,” Wilson says, “and blend old world and contemporary technology to enhance and alter the photographic image to a subtler art form.” Using her camera as a “sketchbook,” she works with a variety of techniques including collage, encaustic wax and the nineteenth century arts of bromoil and photogravure etching.\n\nAfter a long career as a commercial photographer in Indianapolis, Wilson moved to Santa Barbara in1996 and served on the faculty at Brooks Institute until 2016.\n\nHer images have appeared in numerous advertising campaigns, featured in solo and group exhibitions, and placed in the permanent collections of seven museums including the University of Michigan, the Albrecht-Kemper Museum, St. Joseph, MO, and the San-ta Barbara Museum of Art. She was presented with the International Photographic Council Leadership Award at the United Nations in 2003, and Professional Photographers of America Lifetime Achievement in 2006. A dedicated educator, Wilson teaches photographic workshops through the Earnest Brooks Foundation and mentors teenagers in an alternative photography program hosted by Santa Barbara Arts Fund program.

Even when animation is recognized as art, teams of dozens, hundreds or even thousands of artists often go unnoticed and underappreciated.\n\nCurated by S. Mackenzie Eastman, this exhibit celebrates the many artists behind animated\n\nproductions large and small, present and past, big-budget and independent. It invites you to walk through the entire production process, from the earliest concept art to finalized designs, and get to know the diverse range of talents who bring these works to life. It highlights unseen stages of the animation process such as character design, environment art and storyboards.\n\nAdmission is free. The gallery, located in William Rolland Stadium, is open from 10 a.m. to 4\n\np.m. Tuesday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. For more information, contact curator Rachel T. Schmid at 805-493-3697 or rollandgallery@callutheran.edu or visit\n\nCalLutheran.edu/rolland.\n\nWorld AIDS Day observation\n\nWednesday, Dec. 4, 4:30–7:30 p.m.\n\nUllman Conference Center 100/101\n\nPart of Ventura County’s annual observance of World AIDS Day, this three-part program invites everyone to consider HIV/AIDS as not only as an issue of global health but also one of social justice that impacts our local communities.\n\nFrom 4:30 to 6 p.m., “HIV/AIDS 101,” a sexual health education session, will provide new medical information as well as global, national and local updates. At 6 p.m., a speaker living with HIV/AIDS will share his personal health story and experiences as an advocate and activist.

Santa Ana St., Ojai. The event is free and the public is invited to attend.\n\nRoss represents a new generation of photographers who are seeking contemporary artistic possibilities in nineteenth century photographic techniques. Like the slow food movement, the vintage photography revival is a shift away from the culture of instant gratification and disposability. In her illustrated presentation, Ross will cover her work in the wet plate collodion process, one of the earliest methods of photography, invented over 150 years ago.\n\nNot for the fainthearted, this demanding process uses a glass plate coated with a light-sensitive emulsion. There is only a ten-minute window to expose and develop the plate. The photographer must have immediate access to a darkroom, and only one image can be created at a time. In addition to these challenges, extremely toxic and potentially explosive materials must be expertly handled to complete the process safely. These one-of-a-kind photographs, with their detailed, haunting beauty, cannot be reproduced and there is no possibility of post-processing. Each one is both a unique image and a tangible object of art.\n\nIn her current work, which forms the subject of the presentation, Ross seeks to create a new archetype of the American West and to reimagine its reality in the light of contemporary history. She says, “The conventional interpretation of the American West views the landscape as rugged, masculine and something to be tamed or commodified. The presence of the feminine renders the landscape as fragile.” In Ross’s hands, guided by her passion for authenticity, the collodion process produces images that have a mythic quality and a feminine spirituality that connects all things.\n\nA native of Columbus, Ohio, Ross moved west after graduating from college in 2003 to follow her love of independence and sense of adventure. In British Columbia she worked on a self-sustained cattle ranch, and like the photographic process she would eventually embrace, the ranch was grounded in a way of life from the nineteenth century. It was off the grid, and she herded cattle, grew vegetables, cooked meals, and strengthened her sense of autonomy.\n\nHer photographic career began with five years of photojournalism in Wyoming; then she moved to California in 2008 to pursue an MFA at Brooks Institute, graduating in 2012. Upon viewing a collection of early prisoner mug shots, she began working with wet plate collodion in 2010. This process has become her ideal format in a lifelong search for independence combined with a sense of connection. In her artist statement she describes herself this way: “She finds freedom in taking raw materials and transforming those into photographs. The slow pace of collodion requires a presence and intimacy that connects her to both the physical and spiritual world.”\n\nRoss’s images have been exhibited in galleries from Santa Barbara, CA, to Telluride, CO, and most recently, in Budapest, Hungary. She has been Artist in Residence from 2016 to 2019 for art organizations and festivals in Santa Barbara, Telluride, and Budapest. Two documentaries about her work were featured at major film festivals: “Alchemistress” at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival 2013 and “Lindsey Ross: A Less Convenient Path,” at the 2017 Banff Mountain Film Festival.\n\nFor more on Ross, see her website: https://www.lindseyrossphoto.com\n\nThe Ojai Photography Community, which is devoted to inspiration, camaraderie and education, meets on the third Tuesday of each month, February – November.

Currently there are 248 Cities of Peace worldwide, with 25 in the United States. Three of the original peace advocates are guiding the 2019 festival: Brian Berman, Lisa Berman, and Ray Powers.\n\n“Climate Action for Peace” is the theme for the 2019 International Day of Peace. It is an urgent call for action in response to the planet’s record temperatures, rising sea levels, the worst flooding ever recorded, and the most severe wildfires in modern history. Recently, the Ojai City Council signed a resolution to join 850 other cities around the world in the Declaration of Climate Emergency. Brian Berman says, “We feel the importance of understanding the connection between peace and our care for the earth and the actions we can take to express both.” Powers adds: “In alignment with the festival intention we encourage people to walk or ride their bicycles to the event as this helps reduce our carbon footprint in the community. To reduce the quantity of paper flyers, we invite attendees to bring their smartphones and take photos of any displayed information.”\n\nThe ICP team has invited organizations, inspiring speakers and artists who are peace builders and sustainability advocates. Themes will include: Educational Foundations of Peace in Schools; Climate Change Action Steps; Creating a Bicycle Friendly City; Transition to Renewable Energy; Protecting Our Public Lands; Holistic Health - Peace Within/Peace Without; and Community Peace Building.\n\nPeace Awards will be presented to individuals or organizations that have done excellent work creating unity and peace. The annual Awakening Peace Prize will be awarded to Dr. Robert Dodge for his outstanding work in nuclear disarmament advocacy. A family practice physician in Ventura, Dodge is the president of Physicians for Social Responsibility - Los Angeles, and co-founder of Citizens for Peaceful Resolutions.\n\nAwaken both inner artist and peace builder in the family-friendly interactive Peace Art Zone. Plan on bringing your lunch - if possible, in zero waste reusable containers - and join the worldwide “Feast for Peace,” an annual global event that will take place in multiple countries across six continents.\n\nThe fiscal sponsor of the event is local educational non-profit, Awakening Peace 501(C)(3), dedicated to creating events that bring the community together and inspire support for local and world peace initiatives. This includes transitioning towards a green, sustainable and resilient future.\n\nFor further information, go to: https://ojaipeace.net\n\nPhotograph by Christopher Broughton.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Christopher Broughton.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Christopher Broughton.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Christopher Broughton.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Christopher Broughton.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nPhotograph by Christopher Broughton.\n\nEnlarge Photo\n\nOjai, CA: The Ojai Photography Community welcomes master photographer and educator Christopher Broughton, presenting “Approaches to Street Photography” on Tuesday, September 17, at 7 p.m. in Help of Ojai’s Kent Hall, 111 W. Santa Ana St., Ojai CA. The general public is invited to attend this free event.\n\nBroughton’s passion for street photography developed during his twenty years as a professor at Brooks Institute. From 2012 to 2016 he led summer sessions in Paris, where the students learned street photography in the tradition of Parisian masters such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Doisneau. In his presentation he will share his extensive experience in this genre, breaking down his practice into fifteen key approaches that can be applied to any street from Ojai Avenue to the Champs Élysées.\n\nCome and discover how to create compelling images with intriguing approaches like “Fishing a Background,” “Farming Events,” “Working with Sequences,” and “Only a Slice.” Broughton will discuss these topics as well as “Busy vs. Empty,” ”Chaos vs. Order,” “Looking Up and Looking Down,” “Over Their Shoulder/Following,” and other approaches that guide effective visual decisions in the flow of a dynamic street scene. Broughton will illustrate his talk with a selection of his powerful photographs from the streets of Paris. Visitors will also learn some basic elements that every street photographer needs to know: the best photographic tools, the ethics of the street, and how to find your individual “voice” as a photographer.\n\nAfter completing both his BA and MS in photography at Brooks Institute, Broughton returned to his alma mater and served for twenty years in the undergraduate and graduate programs in Digital Photography, Advanced Studio Applications, Optics of Fine Art, and Photographic Theory. When Brooks closed, he began teaching at Mount St. Mary’s University in Los Angeles as Adjunct Professor in the MFA Film, Television and Photography program, where he is currently employed. This summer he has been teaching a “Photo Boot Camp” workshop through UCSB Extension in collaboration with the Ernest Brooks Foundation. This month he will be leading a street photography workshop in Los Angeles.\n\nA nationally and internationally exhibited photographer, Broughton’s work is in the permanent collections of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Toledo Museum of Art, the Crocker Art Museum, and the Quincy Art Center.\n\nFor further information on Broughton, visit: https://www.christopherbroughton.com\n\nFor information on his street photography workshop, go to: https://www.ernestbrooksfoundation.org/workshops.html\n\nThe Ojai Photography Community, which is devoted to inspiration, camaraderie and education, meets on the third Tuesday of each month, February – November.

Santa Ana St., Ojai, CA. The OPC invites the public to this free event.\n\nAlthough no one in Southern California would be using these techniques in summer, many photographers may be shooting in the winter season and will want to be prepared. Freezing temperatures and snowy landscapes make some of the most difficult and challenging conditions for photographers. In his presentation, Volpe will briefly discuss some of the clothing and equipment problems to expect; then he will focus on the complex creative, compositional and post-editing issues associated with photographing winter images.\n\nVolpe is a travel photographer who has logged trips to over 35 countries. During the fall and winter of 2018/ 2019, he was shooting in Yellowstone, Alaska and Antarctica, so his experience with cold weather photography is very recent. About Alaska, he wrote: “Most of the trip the high daily temp was about 0 Fahrenheit, and the nights we were atop the mountain, it was hovering between -15 and -20. I have never worn so many clothes at one time in my life.”\n\nAfter retiring early from a career in a Fortune 50 company, Volpe discovered a passion for travel photography during a trip to Italy in 2007. With no previous experience in any art form, he was surprised by the creativity that began flowing from his photographic trips. Soon he was exhibiting and winning awards: his work has been displayed at the Los Angeles Center for Photography, the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, Studio Channel Islands Gallery, Ojai Art Center, as well as many other galleries and venues. A resident of Agoura Hills, he is actively involved in local art and photography organizations.\n\nVolpe sums up his approach to the art of photography in these words: “My work reflects an existential need to experience the world’s beauty, grace and simplicity. My challenge is to give voice to that which I see.”\n\nFor more information and images, go to http://www.carlvolpephoto.com/\n\nThe Ojai Photography Community, which is devoted to inspiration, camaraderie and education, meets on the third Tuesday of each month, February – November.

To find out, visit Help of Ojai’s Kent Hall, 111 W. Santa Ana St., Ojai, CA, at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, July 16. The OPC invites the public to this free event\n\nDiamond’s presentation will take the audience over and under the ocean waves and into the starry skies with images of surfers, mermaids, and the Milky Way.\n\nAn emerging young photographer, Diamond graduated from Brooks Institute in 2014 with a degree in Visual Journalism. She works in multiple commercial fields, with a versatility ranging from still photography to vide-ography, social media directing to video production and catalog photo shoots.\n\nGrowing up in Southern California, Diamond began surfing at the age of seven and exploring photography in her backyard around the same time. At the age of eight, she found her career path; she recalls: “I still remember the day I was at the grocery with my mom when I was eight years old and saw my first Surfer magazine. I couldn’t believe that you can mix both passions into a career - surfing and photographing! I was mind blown and immediately started taking photos on land of surfers.” Pursuing her twin passions with single-minded purpose, she chose independent study in high school and at the age of sixteen was mentored by a photographer with National Geographic.\n\nAt Brooks Institute, Diamond finally zeroed in on her major artistic focus. She studied underwater photography with top nature photographer, Ralph Clevenger, and discovered her true calling. “We learned all about photographing and even editing images on water and underwater,” she says. “I was in heaven - this is where I belong - in the water.”\n\nFor more of Diamond’s images, go to https://brianadiamond.photoshelter.com/about/index\n\nThe Ojai Photography Community, which is devoted to inspiration, camaraderie and education, meets on the third Tuesday of each month, February – Novem-ber.

Santa Ana St., Ojai CA. The OPC invites the public to attend this free event.\n\nIn his presentation Place will cover the exciting new field of drone photography. He will share his experiences and the expertise he has achieved in shooting aerial photographs for hospitality, construction and real estate clients. His illustrated talk will feature a selection of the stunning images he has created utilizing a drone. He will discuss the unique advantages of drones as well as their safety issues. Their advantages provide the photographer with a perspective impossible either at ground level or at the higher level of an airplane. Along with aerial capability, drones remain quiet and cost little compared to standard aircraft. Safety is of paramount importance: “Essentially you are flying a four-bladed weed whacker,” Place says, and advises photographers to put safety in the forefront of their minds at all times.\n\nSumming up his presentation, Place writes: ”Often I am asked if composing a photograph with a drone is the same as creating an image at ground level. The answer is yes—and no. It is similar, of course, but being able to make large adjustments to the altitude of a camera adds a whole new dimension to the process. ‘Drone Photography—It’s All About Altitude’ discusses the similarities and the differences when you are shooting with essentially a tripod that extends from 1 foot to 400 feet. That changes everything!”\n\nPlace is a highly successful commercial and editorial photographer with over thirty years of experience and an extensive list of clients. His images have appeared in National Geographic, Sunset, Islands, Time, Westways and Smithsonian magazines, as well as many other leading publications. His corporate and institutional clients include Patagonia, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Biltmore Hotel and the University of California, to name a few. He has worked with a wide array of major book publishers, from Prentice Hall to Lonely Planet.\n\nAn outstanding educator, Place taught for twelve years at Brooks Institute. He is now teaching photography classes at Santa Barbara City College.

Santa Clara St., Ojai, CA. The event is free and the public is invited to attend.\n\nOne of the finest black and white photographers in the world, Roark discovered his forte in 1982 when a traveling exhibit with his photography was burglarized. The thieves took only his black and white prints, leaving his color images behind. Since that time he has specialized in this genre of photography, pursuing his passion for both the art form and its technical challenges.\n\nBorn in Glendale, CA, Roark grew up in a family involved with photography and art for three generations. He had access to a darkroom in his family home and achieved a mastery of photographic skills by his teens, winning awards for his work in high school. At that time he made a decision to pursue a practical career in his working life and continue with his chosen art form as a sideline. After winning a scholarship to UCLA and graduating with a law degree, he practiced as an attorney until early retirement. During the final fifteen years of his law career, he gradually transitioned into his second career as a photographer. In 1996 he moved from Los Angeles to Solvang, where he currently resides.\n\nRoark’s approach to his art emerges out of his fascination with light, design and pattern recognition. His black and white images create a window into the inter-locking patterns of natural forms without the distraction of color. He constructs an overall design with a dramatic impact that attracts the viewer into smaller, interesting patterns, keeping the eye in the image as long as possible. Because of the extraordinary depth of detail possible with carbon inkjet printing, the viewer can discover layers upon layers of visual fields that continue to astonish the eye the longer one looks.\n\nWhen digital black and white photography began to surpass film in the ‘90s, Roark found that the available inks for printing black and white digital images were disappointingly inadequate. Roark’s response was to create his own inkjet printing sets directly from carbon pigments, enabling an immense array of light-fast tonalities. Determined to make black and white photography more accessible and affordable, he has provided formulas and directions for carbon-based ink sets on an open-source, royalty-free basis. In another innovation, Roark has replaced traditional photo papers with cotton-based archival watercolor paper. The combination of 100 percent carbon pigments on this kind of paper is more archival and lightfast than silver gelatin prints.\n\nRoark’s most recent exhibits include “Carbon on Canvas,” at the Gallery Los Olivos, and “Between Light and Dark,” at the Elverhoj Museum in Solvang. The Gallery Los Olivos, where he is Director and Manager, has a permanent display of his work.

Monthly free presentations are part of the group’s community service and education outreach. The general public is always welcome to attend.\n\nCSU Channel Islands (CSUCI) Art Lecturer Christophe Bourély drew his inspiration for this year’s collaborative spring faculty art exhibit while he was driving.\n\n“Sometimes there’s a traffic jam,” he said. “You look to your right and there’s a golf course. You have these manicured lawns that probably consume a lot of water, and there’s maybe a couple of golf carts and a couple of people on these hundreds of acres of land. And here we are stuck outside of the fences. It talks about the disparities that exist here and in other places.”\n\nBourély and Art Lecturer Larry Lytle then got to work and created “Country’s Club,” a whimsical yet pointed look at America’s golf culture. The exhibit is on display in the John Spoor Broome Library Gallery on the CSUCI campus from April 25 through August 24 with an opening reception from 6 to 8 p.m. on Thursday, April 25.\n\nFor their artistic social commentary, Bourély created six 36-by-48-inch oil paintings while Lytle, a photographer, constructed three-dimensional dioramas ranging in size from 18-by-18 inches to 30-by-19 inches.\n\n“Indeed, country clubs represent some of the most (un)fairways we are facing today,” Lytle wrote in their joint artists’ statement. “Aside from the destruction of our planet, they embody the rising inequality and injustice between the 1% and the 99%, the haves and have-nots. Clearly, country club memberships that are upwards of $500,000 in initiation fees and $25,000 in annual dues are emblematic of our ever-increasing income-disparity issues.”\n\nFor the exhibit, Lytle did a little golf research and learned the game that was a precursor to golf got its start in Scotland in the 15th Century.\n\n“Two days after her husband was murdered, Mary Queen of Scots was on the golf course playing golf,” Lytle said.\n\nBourély says he does not play golf, but Lytle admits he has — on municipal courses.\n\nThe public is invited to the opening, which will feature putting greens, golf balls and clubs so guests can try their hand at the game.\n\nLimited parking is available on campus with the purchase of a $6 daily permit; follow signs to the parking permit dispensers.
