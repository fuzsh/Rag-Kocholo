        "text": "Actress Jessica Biel and pop star Justin Timberlake have been married for ten years and together for almost 16, and they're still going strong. The pair have had their ups and downs, including a brief breakup and even briefer photo scandal. But they recently renewed their vows and share two sons, one of whom was born during COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nHere's the complete timeline of their relationship thus far.\n\nJanuary 2007\n\nShortly after his break up with Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are seen snowboarding together with a group of friends in Park City, Utah, and some might say even flirting. Biel had just broken up with baseball star Derek Jeter. A source told People that Timberlake was only “trying to have a good time.”\n\nThey added, “He is in no way looking to be in a relationship. He's single and he's happy.”\n\nMay 2007\n\nAnother source says that Timberlake is “in love” with Biel, adding, “He wants to be with her all the time. He's ready to be serious.”\n\nDecember 2008\n\nOn the cover of British GQ, Biel calls her very private relationship with Timberlake her “one sparkly present” that she doesn't “want to open in front of strangers.”\n\n“It's the one part of my life that is my own and not for anyone else,” she said at the time.\n\nSeptember 2009\n\nRumors start circulating that the couple have broken up, but a source said, “They're together...They're not breaking up. Any time they spend time apart it's because they're working.”\n\nThey did add, “Things have been a bit up in the air recently. They've been spending more time apart—more time with each of their friends, and they've been reevaluating [their relationship].”\n\nMarch 2011\n\nA few years later, things go from assessing to ending. They decided to end their relationship, but a source stated there were “no hard feelings” and it “was completely mutual, and they both decided it was time to move on.”\n\nReps confirmed the break up, saying, “Addressing the media speculation regarding Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake's relationship, we are confirming that they mutually have decided to part ways. The two remain friends and continue to hold the highest level of love and respect for each other.”\n\nJune 2011\n\nIn the July issue of Vanity Fair, Timberlake is effusive about his ex.\n\n“She is the single-handedly most significant person in my life,” he says. “In my 30 years, she is the most special person, okay? I don’t want to say much more, because I have to protect things that are dear to me—for instance, her.”\n\nAugust 2011\n\nThe pair were seen in Toronto enjoying time together at an art deco diner on Queen Street West. An eyewitness said, “They were in good spirits....They seemed happy. They had brunch together. They were talking. They enjoyed their food. They had a nice time.”\n\nA source explained, “They always remained friendly after the split and spent time together.”\n\nNovember 2011\n\nThe break didn't last too long, though. That November, Biel hinted in an interview with ELLE magazine that they may have reconciled after being asked about her dating life.\n\n“A girl doesn't kiss and tell,” she said.\n\nDecember 2011\n\nA month later, they were engaged. Timberlake proposed to Biel when they visited Montana, which she recounted years later on The Late Late Show.\n\n“We were in Montana on a piece of property that we owned at the time,” Biel recalled. “We had snowboarded all day. It was in the middle of the winter. Waist-high snow. We were [in] head-to-toe snowboarding outfits—hats, gloves, everything.”\n\nBiel continued, “And we go up to the property to just check out how the foundation is looking. And all of a sudden, he gets down onto his knees and just sinks into the snow.”\n\nAugust 2012\n\nIn a cover story for InStyle, Biel says Timberlake picked out the ring himself and often helps her style choices.\n\n“I had no say whatsoever [in the ring]. I don’t micromanage,” she said. “He is fearless in his choices and has a real eye for design. And I’ll be honest: He has better taste than I do.”\n\nOctober 2012\n\nOn October 19, 2012, the couple marry in southern Italy, and like most of their moments, it's quite private.\n\n“I had a little bit of butterflies,” Biel told People about the ceremony. “I was about to stand up in front of my friends and family and bare my soul for the person I love. It was terribly emotional.”\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nTimberlake confirmed Biel's pregnancy on January 31, which was also his 34th birthday. He shared a pic of himself kissing Biel's belly, captioning it, “Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes! This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets.”\n\nMarch 2015\n\nTimberlake celebrates Biel's birthday on Instagram.\n\nApril 2015\n\nIn April, the birth of their baby was confirmed by the couple's publicist to People. The rep added that “mom and baby are doing well and dad is ‘ecstatic.’”\n\nThe baby boy was named Silas Randall, and his first photo showed him wearing a Memphis Grizzlies shirt.\n\nAugust 2015\n\nBiel shared something about motherhood with E! News, saying her most magical moment with Silas thus far was “probably the moment he wakes up from a nap. He's sort of looking around and you sort of creep up and look over the crib and he looks up and he goes [big sigh] just a gummy mouth, no teeth, just a big smile, happy that you're alive, and you're just looking at him.”\n\nShe added, “You quickly move on from it because there is a dirty diaper in your palm.”\n\nApril 2016\n\nBiel told ELLE.com at the Tiffany Blue Book gala that parenthood changed her style.\n\n“Some days it does feel as though there's no time for anything. Fashion sometimes feels like it goes to the bottom of the list,” she said. “I do feel like I have to make a little bit more of an effort, because it's very easy to just throw on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and sneakers and just run out the door, because you're doing a million things at once.”\n\nShe continued, “You have to just say: You know what, I'm going to put on my heels, I'm going to put on my dress, and I'm going to do it. You do have to make an effort, I think.”\n\nWhen asked about Timberlake's style, she replied, “No, nothing's changed for him, he's fine...He always looks great, even when he's sloppy!”\n\nApril 2017\n\nJessica Biel's 7th Heaven costar Beverley Mitchell told Access Hollywood Live that she was there when they met and sparks flew.\n\n“I was there like the moment the love connection happened,” said Mitchell. “I was like, ‘Okay, this is happening.’ They met, it was at the Golden Globes. It was so cute because they were like—it's that moment like I like you, I think you like me. It was very, very sweet. They were definitely flirting. They were really cute.”\n\nAugust 2017\n\nThe actress spoke with ELLE.com at the premiere of her TV series The Sinner, saying her character was informed by her son Silas.\n\n“It's personal for me,” she said. “I wouldn't be able to do this role if I didn't know what it was like to be a mom. If I wouldn't be able to see my son every day...I get emotional just thinking about it.”\n\nThat same month, she told Marie Claire, “You think you're a selfless person, and then you realize you're not. These little people come around, and they require so much, and your schedule is really not your own, nor is it important anymore, and it's very clear that it's your life now, revolving around this dude. I'm not that person who feels like, Oh, my whole life changes for my kid, but it does.”\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nBiel starred in the video for Timberlake's single “Man of the Woods,” being the babe of the song.\n\nOctober 2019\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight Timberlake opened up about needing to go on vocal rest, and how Biel helped him cope with the disappointment of canceling shows.\n\n“I think anybody out there, you know, you go through anything, to have somebody by your side to really go through it with you and get in the mud with you, so to speak, I'm sure you know what that's like,” he said. “It's like once you find that person, it's like a baptism, where you're like, ‘I can't go back,’ you know what I mean? Like, I don't, I can't go back, so, which is what fatherhood's like too.”\n\nBiel also spoke to Entertainment Tonight, and shared how she knew that Timberlake was the one.\n\n“I knew that he was my person early on, but we were so young,” she said. “There wasn't any big risks being taken. There wasn't anything... really putting anything on the line. We were just hanging out. I think before we got married, that's when I was like, ‘Oh yeah, this is the person I want to be in the boat with when we hit the rapids, because we're going to hit the rapids and we're going to have to hold on tight. Can you row? Because I can row, I think you can row, let's try this.’”\n\nBiel added, “It was like that early on in our relationship and when you're married for the first time you go, ‘Okay. You can't just jump out of this thing.’”\n\nDecember 2019\n\nIn 2019, pics were leaked of Timberlake holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright, and Us Weekly reported that Biel pushed him to apologize publicly.\n\n“Jessica encouraged Justin to put out his statement on Instagram because she felt embarrassed by his actions and wanted him to take accountability,” a source said. “Jessica was very upset and embarrassed by Justin's behavior. [But] they are still united, very much together and strong.”\n\nWainwright's rep denied anything happened between them, as did he in his statement. He wrote:\n\nI stay away from gossip as much as I can, but for my family, I feel it is important to address recent rumors that are hurting the people I love.\n\nA few weeks ago, I displayed a strong lapse in judgement—but let me be clear—nothing happened between me and my costar. I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son. I apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be. This was not that. I am incredibly proud to be working on Palmer. Looking forward to continuing to make this movie and excited for people to see it.\n\nJuly 2020\n\nBefore the couple confirmed it, The Daily Mail reported the couple had welcome a second child.\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nA few months later, Timberlake's former *NSYNC colleague Lance Bass told Entertainment Tonight, “The baby is cute of course; it's Justin and Jessica!”\n\nWhile he spilled those beans, he did not reveal the baby's name, adding, “Justin would kill me!”\n\nTimberlake's friend and collaborator, Brian McKnight also confirmed the child's existence in an interview with Hollywood Life.\n\n“Having kids and having his family, I think [Justin] took some time to focus on those things because those things are very important,” he said. “I think if he’s going to do music, he’s going to make sure that that's secure, and then he'll bring us into his music. And being inspired! He just had a new baby. I think that's going to be really inspiring for him and he'll have some new music based on that, I'm sure.”\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nTimberlake confirmed he had a new baby himself while speaking to Ellen DeGeneres on her former talk show, a son named Phineas.\n\n“He's awesome and so cute. Nobody's sleeping,” Timberlake said. “But we're thrilled. We're thrilled and couldn't be happier. Very grateful.”\n\nJune 2021\n\nIn June, Biel went on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast, and talked about having a baby during lockdown.\n\n“I had, like, a secret COVID baby,” she explained. “It wasn't like it was supposed to be a secret. It was just COVID happened, and then I went to Montana with my family and never left.”\n\nOctober 2021\n\nWith the pandemic, the couple spent more and more time in Montana and ended up listing their home in the Hollywood Hills home for $35 million.\n\n“They're rarely in L.A. and are happy to live in Montana,” a source told People. “They also still have a place on the East Coast.”\n\nMarch 2022\n\nTimberlake posted on Instagram for Biel's 40th birthday, and wrote on his Story, “Whether it's laid up on a couch, kicking my ass at the gym or, dressing up at ridiculous costume parties... you make it all look good. I love you and I celebrate you every day.”\n\nBiel revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that her husband threw her a huge birthday party for the milestone birthday and covered a bunch of her favorite songs.\n\n“He's just my favorite....He threw me such an amazing, amazing party. And he flew his band in and he performed for me,” she gushed. “Look, I will go head-to-head with everybody, but I'm his No. 1 fan. And I mean, who do I want to see on my birthday? It's him and his band. He's my favorite.”\n\nShe added, “Everything from Feist to Radio Head to Donny Hathaway ... it just goes on and on.”\n\nMay 2022\n\nDuring the premiere of her Hulu series Candy, Biel told Entertainment Tonight why her relationship with Timberlake is going strong ten years later.\n\n“It's a really good question, right?” she said. “Well, I'll have to give Justin the credit in this moment, for this one thing that he always says to me: ‘We might be married, but we have to keep dating,’ and it's so true. You just have to keep making time for each other and you have to keep making each other a priority. And do the things that you love together.”\n\n“It's not always easy, as we all know, but those touch point moments make all the hard times palatable,” she added.\n\nTimberlake even made a cameo in the series as Deputy Steve Deffibaugh, a part he volunteered for after reading the show's script.\n\n“He said, ‘Oh, who's playing this character?’ I said, ‘Oh, I don't know, probably somebody local. We don't have any money left,’” Biel said. “And he goes, “I want to play it.’”\n\nOctober 2022\n\nThe official anniversary of ten years of marriage was that October, and Timberlake posted, “10 years ain't enough! You make me a better husband and father every day! I love you so much you beautiful human! Run it back!”\n\nBiel shared a carousel of images as well, writing, “Being married to you is the adventure of a lifetime! Run it back, baby. RUN IT BACK. I love you.”\n\nNovember 2022\n\nBiel's post revealed that the couple had a vow renewal ceremony when she reshared it in a Story, writing, “From our wedding vow renewal this summer—in Italy where it all went down.”\n\nShe went on Today and described the ceremony as “very intimate” with just a “couple of friends.”\n\n“We almost canceled it,” Biel said. “We thought, ‘This is silly, are we going to feel goofy doing this?’ And actually, it was so moving.

The couple were seen with sons Silas, 8, and Phineas, 3, in Venice and Rome exploring the city’s catacombs and going shopping. In several pics, they're holding hands or embracing sweetly.\n\nLater in the month, excerpts from the new memoir by Britney Spears, The Woman in Me, included some stories of her former relationship with Timberlake. They did not show the *NSYNC member in a flattering light. Spears alleged that she had an abortion after she became pregnant with Timberlake's baby, writing that she was surprised by the pregnancy, but it was not “a tragedy.”\n\nShe added that she loved him and wanted to have children eventually.\n\n“But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy,” she continued in the book. “He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young...Justin was so sure that he didn't want to be a father.”\n\nSpears then called the abortion “one of the most agonizing” experiences of her life.\n\nA source tells People that despite these revelations, the musician is doing well and is focused on his family and Biel. He is also looking forward to the *NSYNC reunion and his upcoming Trolls movie.\n\n“He’s happy at home with Jess and their kids and he’s focusing on new music. He’s in such a great place,” explained the insider.\n\nNovember 2023\n\nThe couple attended the special screening of Universal Pictures' Trolls: Band Together at the TCL Chinese Theater, on November 15, 2023.

The actress wore a plaid flannel jacket, a white T-shirt with a colorful graphic print design, and a black mini-skirt. On her feet were a pair of Doc Martens and she carried a handbag covered in chains.\n\nTimberlake performed some new tracks off his upcoming solo album “Everything I Thought It Was.”\n\nOn January 31, Biel paid tribute to her husband for his birthday with a video montage of moments they shared together. “I ALWAYS got you. Happy birthday, babe,” she wrote.\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nIn an appearance on the Graham Norton Show, Timberlake took the opportunity to gush about Biel and their family life, especially how much he loves being a dad to his sons Silas and Phineas.\n\n“I have two wonderful children, who are going to be the death of me,” the pop star shared. “But yeah two boys and a wonderful wife and I'm just happy. Is that controversial these days?”\n\nTimberlake is promoting his upcoming album Everything I Thought I Was. He explained his new music is inspired by his family life.\n\n“I think it's just, you get to a point in your life where you realize that all the things that have conspired really to get you to this point are beautiful,” he continued. “And I don't think I've ever taken the time to reflect and look at my life and say like, ‘Wow this is really cool’ and just be thankful for it.”\n\nHe said that he shared his music with friends and family first.\n\n“I was starting to play it for people close to me and they kept saying, ‘Oh that reminds me of something from Justified,’ my first album, or ‘That reminds me of something from FutureSex/LoveSounds.’”\n\nTimberlake continued, “And then finally you know I finished playing them the songs and they said, ‘This sounds like everything we know you for, everything we thought we wanted from you.’ And so that phrase started floating around in my mind. And then just kind of mixing it in with everything I thought it was being this life that I'm just incredibly grateful for.”\n\nMarch 2024\n\nOn March 3, Timberlake posted a sweet video montage dedicated to Biel for her 42nd birthday. The song “The Best” by Tina Turner played in the background.

You’re the best. I love you. Happy birthday, ya 🐐!” Timberlake captioned the reel."
