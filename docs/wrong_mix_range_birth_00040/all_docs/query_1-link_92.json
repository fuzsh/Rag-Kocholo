        "text": "Justin Timberlake has announced he’s going on a world tour!\n\nThe singer-actor revealed the news during his appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday.\n\nThe host proceeded to ask Timberlake at one point, “Do you have something to announce?” But the singer responded, “No, I don’t have anything to announce. We’re announcing it [the album].”\n\nFallon continued to push, saying, “No, no, no, no. How about a little something extra?… There could be something that the audience might want to hear if you said the right thing. That people watching at home, they could go to justintimberlake.com and get something if they wanted something. Is there something you would like to announce?”\n\n“What is happening right now?” Timberlake asked before Fallon jokingly showed him a note card. “Oh, that.… I’m going on tour,” he said, as the audience proceeded to scream.\n\nThe Forget Tomorrow World Tour is set to kick off April 29 in Vancouver, Canada. He will be making many more stops, including Seattle; Phoenix; Fort Worth, Texas; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Miami. Tickets go on sale Feb. 2.\n\nAfter Fallon listed some of the dates, Timberlake joked, “Wow, that’s a lot of dates.”\n\nThe announcement came shortly after the singer revealed he’s releasing a new album, Everything I Thought It Was, on March 15, his first solo album release in more than six years. He also surprised fans last Friday, dropping a new single, “Selfish.”\n\nTimberlake also told Fallon on Thursday that he has been working on the album for four years, and actually wrote 100 songs, but cut it down to 18 for Everything I Thought It Was.\n\n“Making this album is different from any other one.… Different from making albums before because I would just go in for a block of time, and say this is what we made and this is what it is,” he said. But with this album, since he has two children that he shares with wife Jessica Biel, he couldn’t consistently be writing and in the studio. “I was going back and forth. Two weeks writing, coming back for a month, and just what we call writer camps where I would work with different songwriters, work with different producers, people that I’ve worked with before, people that I’ve never worked with before.”"
