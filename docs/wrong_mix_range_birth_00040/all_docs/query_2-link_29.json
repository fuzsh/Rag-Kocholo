        "text": "Justin Timberlake has chosen LA as the next location for his series of free concerts as gets ready to release his latest album this month.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA — Justin Timberlake is planning to play a free concert in Los Angeles two days before the release of his latest album, \"Everything I Thought It Was,\" the singer announced this week.\n\nTimberlake will play at the Wiltern in Koreatown on Wednesday, March 13. It's the latest in a series of free concerts for the pop icon; he hosted shows in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee and New York City earlier this year.\n\nTimberlake announced the LA show in an Instagram post Wednesday, which showed photos of bright-yellow flyposted posters with the message \"Justin Timberlake is performing for one night only in Los Angeles.\"\n\nTickets are free, but definitely not guaranteed. Anyone interested can request up to two tickets online before March 8 at 11:59 p.m., according to the ticket website.\n\nThose who receive tickets will get an email by March 12 and tickets will show up in their Ticketmaster accounts by the following morning.\n\nThose who miss Timberlake this time around will get another chance to see him as he makes a stop at the Kia Forum in Inglewood on March 17 and 18 as part of his Forget Tomorrow World Tour.\n\nThe tour comes as Timberlake readies to release his sixth studio album \"Everything I Thought It Was\" on March 15 — his first album in six years. The album will feature collaborations with his former NSYNC bandmates and producers Calvin Harris and Timbaland.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
