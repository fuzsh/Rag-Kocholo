        "text": "Justin Timberlake finally received a public show of support from his wife, Jessica Biel, following his June 18 arrest in the Hamptons on charges of driving while intoxicated.\n\nBiel was reportedly upset about her husband’s latest controversy, regarded it as another “distraction,” and was disappointed he would do something “so stupid” as to try and “drive himself home after a night of drinking,” sources have told People, Life & Style and other outlets.\n\nBut the “7th Heaven” star was among the thousands who showed up Tuesday night to watch Timberlake perform at Madison Square Garden as part of his Forget Tomorrow World Tour, TMZ and other outlets reported. Biel was recorded dancing and singing to one of her husband’s songs by “Real Housewives of New York” star Jessel Taank, People said.\n\nThe video, which didn’t have any sound, showed Biel sipping a drink while dancing in a halter-neck top and jeans. “What Tour? The World Tour. @justintimberlake,” Taank captioned a carousel of photos and videos from the show, which she shared on Instagram.\n\nBiel’s appearance at Madison Square Garden marks her first public show of support for her beleaguered husband, according to TMZ.\n\nThe “Sexyback” singer was arrested early in the morning on June 18 in Sag Harbor after driving away from a hotel, where he reportedly claimed to police that he only had one martini, according to People. But a police officer reported seeing Timberlake run through a stop sign and swerve in his traffic lane before stopping him.\n\nTimberlake, 42, also “bombed” a field sobriety test, TMZ said. He was handcuffed and spent the night in jail before he was arraigned on one count of DWI. He also was cited for two traffic violations, pleaded not guilty and was released on his own recognizance.\n\nDuring Timberlake’s traffic stop, conducted by an officer who reportedly did not recognize him, the pop singer expressed concern that an arrest would derail his tour, Page Six reported. A source told Page Six that the singer said under his breath, “This is going to ruin the tour.”\n\nBut Timberlake hasn’t let that happen — at least not thus far. Three days after his arrest, the NSYNC hitmaker performed in Chicago, acknowledging to the crowd, “It’s been a tough week,” People reported. He also said, “I know sometimes I’m hard to love but you keep on loving me and I love you right back.”\n\nBiel, meanwhile, was seen in New York City last week, filming her new Prime Video series, “The Better Sister.” In fact, she was seen filming a scene in Central Park, hours before her husband’s arrest, Entertainment Tonight reported.\n\nA source told People that Timberlake’s arrest was a “distraction” for his wife, and she was “not happy” about it. Another source told Life & Style, “She’s upset, as anyone can imagine.” Biel and Timberlake have been married for 13 years and are parents to two sons, Silas, 11, and Phineas, 3.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Biel has had to deal with her husband garnering negative headlines by allegedly drinking too much and doing something embarrassing. In 2019, Biel was “humiliated” when Timberlake was photographed getting “handsy” with a co-star during “a boozy night out in New Orleans,” Life & Style said.\n\nTimberlake subsequently admitted on social media that he “drank way too much that night” and engaged in behavior that he regretted. He also publicly apologized to his “amazing wife and family.”\n\nTimberlake’s recent arrest “is embarrassing” for Biel, given that “she’s stood by him for so long,” the source source told Life & Style. “It’s one thing to sit back with friends over a drink. It’s another to consume so much alcohol that you’re DWI bait.”\n\n“If Justin isn’t worried about losing Jessica, he should be,” the Life & Style source said.\n\nBut the person who spoke to People said that Biel still “loves” her husband and “will always be by his side.” That may be the reason for her well-documented appearance at his show Tuesday night. “He’s a great dad and husband,” the source also told People."
