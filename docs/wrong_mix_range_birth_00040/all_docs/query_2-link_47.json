        "text": "Cause for alarm: Justin Timberlake has only been in a few Certified Fresh movies in his career, projects that have really hit with critics – we hope he has a second job to fall back on.\n\nFor now, Timberlake will just have to be content with the fact he’s been in some of the really good flicks of the 2010s, like David Fincher’s Best Picture nominee The Social Network, or the Coen brothers’ wry and sly take on the folk music, Inside Llewyn Davis. And no one can blame Timberlake for not being careful in cultivating his movie brand, making a few sex comedies (The Love Guru, Friends With Benefits), throwing in a few sci-fi risks (Southland Tales, In Time), and sweetening the stew with family movies (Yogi Bear, Shrek the Third).\n\nTimberlake’s latest film, his first in three years, certainly falls in that last category: Trolls World Tour, which took the extraordinary step of skipping theatrical and going straight to on-demand. With the movie added to this list, we’re sync as we look back on all Justin Timberlake movies ranked by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#18\n\nRunner Runner (2013) 7%\n\n#18\n\nAdjusted Score: 12085%\n\nCritics Consensus: It has an impressive cast and an intriguing premise, but Runner Runner wastes them on a bland, haphazardly assembled thriller with very little payoff.\n\nSynopsis: Believing that he has been swindled, Princeton grad student Richie (Justin Timberlake) goes to Costa Rica to confront online-gambling tycoon...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Eric Brevig\n\n#15\n\nThe Love Guru (2008) 13%\n\n#15\n\nAdjusted Score: 20014%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Love Guru features far too many gross-out gags, and too few earned laughs, ranking as one of Mike Myers' poorest outings.\n\nSynopsis: Born in America and raised in an Indian ashram, Pitka (Mike Myers) returns to his native land to seek his...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Woody Allen\n\n#12\n\nIn Time (2011) 37%\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 43799%\n\nCritics Consensus: In Time's intriguing premise and appealing cast are easily overpowered by the blunt, heavy-handed storytelling.\n\nSynopsis: In a future where time is money and the wealthy can live forever, Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a poor... [More]\n\nDirected By: Andrew Niccol\n\n#11\n\nSouthland Tales (2006) 41%\n\n#11\n\nAdjusted Score: 44900%\n\nCritics Consensus: Southland Tales, while offering an intriguing vision of the future, remains frustratingly incoherent and unpolished.\n\nSynopsis: With the United States under the threat of nuclear attack, the lives of several people converge in a dystopian Los...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Robert Lorenz\n\n#7\n\nAlpha Dog (2006) 55%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 60548%\n\nCritics Consensus: A glossy yet unflinching portrait of violent, hedonistic teenagers.

[More]\n\nDirected By: Nick Cassavetes\n\n#6\n\nBlack Snake Moan (2007) 66%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 72206%\n\nCritics Consensus: Uninhibited performances, skillful direction, and a killer blues soundtrack elevate Black Snake Moan beyond its outlandish premise.\n\nSynopsis: After her lover (Justin Timberlake) leaves to serve in the military, Rae (Christina Ricci) gives in to her raging libido...
