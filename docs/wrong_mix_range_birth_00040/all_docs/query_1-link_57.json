        "text": "Following the announcement of the initial set of tour dates, global pop sensation Justin Timberlake is extending The Forget Tomorrow World Tour.\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, Timberlake is including a second performance at the Kia Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, May 18, solidifying this tour as his first in more than five years. He’s also performing in Inglewood on Friday, May 17 and Pechanga Arena in San Diego on May 14.\n\nTickets for the newly added date will go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday, Feb. 2 at Ticketmaster.com. Presale options will be available for Citi cardmembers and Verizon Wireless customers starting at 10 a.m. Wednesday, Jan. 31 at citientertainment.com and verizon.com.\n\nTimberlake’s upcoming tour serves as support of the release of his forthcoming sixth studio album, “Everything I Thought It Was,” set to drop on March 15. This marks a significant chapter for the “SexyBack” star, with his last major tour taking place in 2019, including a stop at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.\n\nTimberlake recently unveiled his latest single, “Selfish,” and the tour announcement coincided with his sixth appearance as a host on “Saturday Night Live,” which celebrated the new release and his multifaceted talents once again with skits and laughs."
