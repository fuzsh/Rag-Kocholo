        "text": "SHANNON RFC Chairman of Rugby, Jack Keane believes the large number of senior rugby clubs in Limerick is not sustainable with the continuing drain of players away from the region due to the on-going recession.\n\nNext season will mark the first time since the AIL was established 22 seasons ago that the competition’s most successful club will not be in the top flight.\n\nShannon RFC Club Chairman Jack Keane said the recession is having a detrimental effect on the senior rugby clubs in Limerick and he believes the city cannot sustain such a high number of senior sides with so many players being forced to move away from the city in order to find work.\n\nThe majority of those players not opting to move abroad for work purposes have opted to work in Dublin where several are featuring regular for the city’s senior sides.\n\nLimerick city will have seven sides competing in the AIL next season with Richmond’s recent promotion.\n\n“I would have said every year for the past 10 years, including six years as Chairman of Shannon RFC, that there are too many senior clubs in Limerick and Limerick cannot sustain that number,” Jack Keane said.\n\n“In the past, Limerick has done well on the basis that clubs have been able to find jobs for people, able to get them what they needed.\n\n“But the whole thing has shifted towards Dublin. I wish Dublin clubs every success.\n\n“But the best thing that has happened in Irish rugby in the past few months has been the IRFU beginning to wake up and smell the roses in relation to paying players and things like that with the publication of the Blueprint for Sustainable Clubs.\n\n“The announcement over the past few weeks will prove a very positive step for amateur rugby at club level. I would be 100% behind it.”\n\nClubs will be banned from paying players from the start of the 2014-15 season. The maximum payable by a club to a player is €4,500 per season or €250 per game.\n\nJack Keane is confident Shannon can bounce back from the bitter blow of relegation.\n\n“It is not where we wanted to be. It is certainly not where we expected to be, for one of the best clubs in AIL history,” Jack Keane admitted.\n\n“For us, it is the beginning of a new start. We will bounce back. I have no doubt about that.\n\n“The UCD game showed us that you cannot play the Leinster Academy with club rugby players.\n\n“I have to praise UCD who did exceptionally well out there. From a Shannon perspective we will view the play-off defeat and this season as the beginning of something new for us. We are not used to being where we are. This is a very good, family, parish-based club.”"
