The founding members were Dan Duggan, Richie Gleeson, Pierce Hartney, Joe Hegarty and Paddy Lynch, who was the team's first captain. Stephan Hanrahan was president of the club for the first two years. Shannon remained a junior club for close to 70 years, during which time Shannon supplied numerous players to Garryowen. Shannon won the Munster Junior Cup for the first time in 1914.[2] Their first Transfield cup was won in 1938. The following year, the Munster Junior Cup was won again. One year later (1940), in the process of winning their first Charity Cup, they added both the Munster Junior Cup and Transfield Cup.[citation needed]\n\nShannon attained senior status in the 1953–54 season, becoming Limerick's fifth senior club. In 1960 Shannon won their first Munster Senior Cup, defeating University College Cork, in a replay at Thomond Park, having drawn 8-8 the previous week at Musgrave Park, Cork.[2]\n\nOver the years, Shannon have had numerous temporary grounds, including the field at the Island Bank, Gilligan's field, Johnny Cusack's field and Egan's Field in Corbally. The first purchased grounds were 14 acres (57,000 m2) of land at Fir Hill, Gortatogher, (better known as Athlunkard) just two miles (3 km) from Limerick city. Those grounds were later sold to Corbally Utd. soccer club in favour of our current more spacious grounds at Coonagh off the Ennis Road. Today, Shannon's home grounds are Thomond Park.[2]\n\nWhile still a junior club, Shannon became co-tenants with Bohemians RFC at the Munster RFU-owned grounds at famed Thomond Park. In 1967, they completed their own Club Pavilion there. In 1978, the Pavilion was extended to the size it is today.[citation needed]\n\nA milestone in the history of the club was the celebration of their centenary in 1984.[citation needed]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nAIB League\n\n1994–95, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1997–98, 2001–02, 2003–04, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2008-09: 9\n\nDivision 1B 2017–18, 2021–22\n\nAll-Ireland Cup\n\n2007-08\n\nMunster Senior Cup\n\n1960, 1977, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998, 1999–00, 2000–01, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007-08: 19\n\nMunster Junior Cup\n\n1914, 1920, 1924–25, 1939–40, 1954, 1961–62, 1996, 2015: 8\n\nMunster Senior League\n\n1981, 1986, 1989, 2001–02, 2002–03, 2003–04, 2004-05: 7\n\nNotable players\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also Category:Shannon RFC players\n\nMunster\n\n[edit]\n\nThree Shannon players, Brendan Foley, Colm Tucker and Gerry McLoughlin, played for the Munster side that defeated the touring All Blacks 12–0 on 31 October 1978 at Thomond Park.

Source of this information is not verified but it was mentioned on the Penguins & Potholes Podcast (episode 2) hosted by Barry Murphy (rugby union) & Andrew Trimble , that David Quinlan (rugby union, born 26 January 1978) inquired what a pothole was when John Langford had said it.
