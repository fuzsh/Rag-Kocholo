        "text": "Five of our U/16 players have been part of the Munster Rugby development programe during the summer in UL, with the programme culminating in a serious of games and blitzes. Last week they played a Romanian team and today(Wednesday 14th ) there was a monster blitz in Portlaoise where U16 development teams from all regions within the four provinces gathered. Sam Golden(1) James Mc Donagh(14) and Scott Williamson(5) were part of one team, with James managing to bag himself a try in his opening game. The other team saw Sam McGlynn (2) and Colin McNamara(14) lineout, and again we had a try scorer with Colin bursting over the line. Next week sees the conclusion of the programme with a game on Monday on Virgin Media Park against the South Development side, and then on Wednesday the return fixture will make place in University of Limerick. It has been a great experience for all the lads and it's a continued recognition of our fantastic youth section to see the talent we foster and nurture , not alone with this squad , but throughout the Munster age groups for boys and girls. #club #pathway"
