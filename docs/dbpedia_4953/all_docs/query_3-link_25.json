        "text": "SHANNON RFC boosted their survival hopes in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland league after securing a hard fought 26-16 victory over local rivals Garryowen at a sun-drenched Dooradoyle on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe teams observed a minute's silence before kick-off as a mark of respect for former Garryowen player and coach Tom Tierney who sadly passed away suddenly aged just 46 on Friday morning.\n\nDespite the clash of fixture with Ireland's Six Nations clash with Italy in Rome, a good-sized crowd turned out to watch an entertaining top flight derby on a poignant day at Dooradoyle following the passing of Tom Tierney, who won eight Ireland caps and also represented Richmond, Munster, Leicester Tigers, Galwegians and Connacht with distinction as a player.\n\nShannon led their hosts 17-13 at half-time, thanks to three first half tries. The Parish side opened the scoring with a sublime opening try in the fifth minute which featured backs and forwards interchanging passes and off-loads in the lead up to the score with winger Daniel Hurley touching down in the left corner.\n\nOut-half Michael Cooke superbly landed the conversion from close to the left touchline for a 7-0 lead.\n\nTo their credit, Garryowen, who have won just one of their league fixtures this season, hit back with 10 unanswered points. Out-half Tony Butler kicked the Light Blues opening points with a ninth minute penalty, before hooker Michael Mbaud crossed for a close range try on 20 minutes. Butler's successful conversion made it 10-7 to the home side.\n\nNinth-placed Shannon then struck for their second try with hooker Jordan Prenderville dotted down following a well-executed maul on 29 minutes.\n\nGarryowen the regained the lead on 32 minutes when Butler slotted a further penalty goal for 13-12.\n\nHowever, Shannon had the final say in the half when centre Alan Flannery scored their third try in the 38th minute. Cooke's well struck conversion attempt came back of the posts as the visitors led by four points at half-time.\n\nCooke was on target shortly after the restart landing a penalty goal after Garryowen were penalised at scrum-time. That successful kick increased the visitors lead to seven points, 13-20.\n\nA Butler penalty for Garryowen reduced the deficit to four points, 16-20, before two further penalties from Cooke sealed victory for Shannon.\n\nThe result has seen Garryowen relegated to Division 1B of the league for next season.\n\nNinth-placed Shannon remain in the relegation play-off position in the table, two points behind eighth-placed Lansdowne with now just four games to go in the regular season\n\nSCORERS: Garryowen: Michael Mboud try, Tony Butler, con, 3 pens. Shannon: Dan Hurley, Jordan Prenderville, Alan Flannery try each, Michael Cooke 3 pens, con\n\nGARRYOWEN: Jamie Shanahan; Colm Quilligan, Matt Sheehan, Jack Delaney, Henry Buttimer; Tony Butler, Evan Maher; Michael Veale, Michael Mbaud, Mark Donnelly, Cian Hurley, Kevin Seymour, Tim Ferguson, Des Fitzgerald, Sean Rennison (capt). Replacements: Larry Kelly, Darragh McCarthy, Oisin Cooke, Max Clein, Ed Barry, Sam Hanrahan"
