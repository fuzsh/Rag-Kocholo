        "text": "In his first season at the coaching helm, Mick Galwey has stepped into Geoff Moylan's shoes and taken up where his predecessor left off. Slowly but surely a new generation of Shannon players has emerged with the age profile such that the future success of the Limerick club looks guaranteed for some time to come.\n\nLittle surprise therefore that they start today's Division 1 final at Lansdowne Road (4.0) as hot favourites but, as they have already discovered to their cost earlier this season, here is a north-south final day showdown tinged with danger.\n\nBack in December, when leading 18-0 at Deramore, the home club staged a comeback of miraculous proportions scoring three tries in the final quarter - including two in injury time - to take the tie 19-18. The 'Quins have gone on to win all four games since against Munster opposition, including Garryowen and not once but twice on the Limerick side's home patch in Dooradoyle.\n\n\"Any team that goes to Dooradoyle twice in a season and wins on both occasions must be respected,\" cautions Shannon skipper Tom Hayes. \"They took us apart in the last quarter of our game in Belfast so we are well aware of what to expect. If you look at the results this season overall then you might have a different perspective on who should or should not be favourites.\"\n\nQuins' coach DC Gillespie is one who epitomises what this relatively new and exciting amalgamation of NIFC and Collegians is all about. Having stepped into the breach on the sudden departure of Andre Bester in mid-season he has guided the Belfast club to the fringe of the biggest prize of all before he steps down to make way for Andy Ward in the summer.\n\n\"A good core of the side played in Shannon last year when we didn't really front up,\" he said. \"Maybe that's harsh but we sat off them a wee bit and let them play too much. If we want it badly enough now then we've got to be in their faces for 80 minutes and that is what we plan to do. We are more experienced now and well capable of mixing it up if we have to.\"\n\nQuins reached the final with a 15-8 win in Limerick against Garryowen and came out of that game with no major injuries. Flanker David Dougherty and centre Greg Mitchell picked up slight knocks but are expected to be fit. And while provincially contracted players Rory Best and Neil Doak could be brought into the squad, Gillespie has stayed loyal to the committed players who have taken the club this far to start.\n\nShannon, also true to form, have delayed naming the starting line up with injury concerns over Frankie Roche, Fiach O'Loughlin, Brian Tuohy and Fionn McLoughlin. McLoughlin and Tuohy picked up knocks against Clontarf in last week's 21-11 semi-final win but both are confidently expected to make it.\n\nInfluential loose-head Roche missed the Clontarf game through a calf strain but has made good progress in the interim. Les Hogan is again on standby with both players named in the squad to travel. Galwey is optimistic too about O'Loughlin's chances although here again every angle is being covered with the fit again Frankie McNamara and last week's replacement No 9 George Murray named in the travelling party as well.\n\nFactor in the likes of David Quinlan, Garret Noonan, Andrew Thompson, James Blaney and Tom Creegan all on the Shannon bench and it gives some idea of the depth of talent at the AIB League's premier club.\n\nToday they come in search of title number seven with Thompson remarkably involved in every one of the previous six. They arrive as the best attacking unit in the competition having scored a massive 395 points in their league campaign and having finished in the top spot, two places ahead of Belfast Harlequins.\n\nBut they will be up against the meanest defence in the league and nowhere was the solid resilience of that defence more evident than at Dooradoyle seven days ago.\n\nAll signs point to it being another close encounter but Shannon's experience on the big occasion allied to that insatiable desire for success should see them home. Take Shannon to make it seventh heaven.\n\nBELFAST HARLEQUINS - J Lowe; P McKenzie, G Mitchell, WP Strauss, S Wilson; I Humphreys, A Matchett; J Carey, N Hanna, J Andress, L McGowan, M Mustchin, S Lamb, D Dougherty, C McCarey.\n\nSHANNON (Squad) - D O'Donovan, I Dowling, T Creegan, B Tuohy, E Cahill, A Thompson, F McLoughlin; D Delaney, F O'Loughlin, G Murray, F McNamara; F Roche, L Hogan, N Conroy, J Blaney, T Buckley, E Halvey, T Hayes, D Quinlan, G Noonan, C McMahon, J O'Connor, S Keogh.\n\nDivision 1 Final"
