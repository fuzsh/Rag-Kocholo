        "text": "Michael “Mickey the Twin” Ryan.\n\nOn Thursday morning , we learned of the passing of our good friend, “The Twin”, and while we all knew Mickey wasn’t in full health for a while now, it still came as a shock to hear the sad news.\n\nA character, on and off the field , with an illustrious rugby career and a collection of silverware to prove it.\n\nMickey began a playing career that spanned 24 years for Thurles, with many games for the famous Shannon RFC along the way.\n\nSome notable achievements with Thurles were as follows\n\nGarryowen Cup 1971, 1980, 1982. 1983\n\nMansergh Cup 1974, 1978, 1981, 1882, 1983\n\nMJ Plate 1977,\n\nNorth Munster League 1983,\n\nEvans Cup 1977 & 1992.\n\nMcGarry Cup 1977,\n\nCasey Cup 1991.\n\nGleeson Cup 1992.\n\nA list of achievements not equaled by very many to this day.\n\nMickey also coached the U18 Boys to an All Ireland Final with Bill Dwyer (RIP) inn2001.\n\nAfter finally hanging up his playing boots, Mickey spent several years as a referee and was very proud of his MAR status within Munster rugby. We will miss the banter, but look forward to the many many stories that will no doubt be told over the coming days and weeks, as we remember The Twin.\n\nAs a mark of respect, we intend to form a guard of honour in the yard of the cathedral Saturday morning before and also after the funeral mass. we ask all members, players and friends of Thurles Rugby Club to assemble in the church yard at 10:15 am. Please wear club gear if you can attend"
