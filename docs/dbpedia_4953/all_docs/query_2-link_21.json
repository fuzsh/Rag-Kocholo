The club is a member of the \"Irish Rugby Football Union Munster Branch\" and as one of the top amateur sides in Ireland has seen many of its players progress to professional and international rugby.\n\nHistory\n\nShannon was founded on the 18 February 1884, in the Shamrock Bar, a Pub by the old Park Bridge, Corbally Road, Limerick. The founder members were Paddy Lynch, Dan Duggan, Richie Gleeson, Pierce Hartney and Joe Hegarty. Paddy Lynch captained the first Shannon team and Stephan Hanrahan was president of the club for the first two years of its existence.\n\nShannon remained a junior club for the best part of 70 years, during which time Shannon supplied numerous players to Garryowen's successful senior sides. Shannon won the Munster Junior Cup for the first of many times in 1914. Their first Transfield cup was won in 1938. The following year, the Munster Junior Cup was won again. One year later(1940), in the process of winning their first Charity Cup, they added both the Munster Junior Cup and Transfield Cup.\n\nShannon's continued and consistent success as a junior club eventually led to the club attaining senior status in the 1953-54 season, becoming Limerick's fifth senior club.\n\nIt was not until 1960 that Shannon won their first Munster Senior Cup, defeating University College Cork, 6pts to 3 in a pulsating replay at Thomond Park, having drawn 8-8 the previous week at Musgrave Park, Cork.\n\nOver the years, since the club's inception, Shannon have had numerous temporary grounds, among them the field at the Island Bank, Gilligan's field, Johnny Cusack's field and Egan's Field on the Mill Rd. in Corbally. The first purchased grounds were 14 acres of land at Fir Hill, Gortatogher, (better known as Athlunkard) just two miles from Limerick city. However, a few years ago, it was determined that this was not big enough, so it was sold to Corbally Utd. soccer club in favour of our current more spacious grounds at Coonagh off the Ennis Road. Shannon currently have 3 training pitches there, floodlights and newly built dressing rooms, and are developing two more pitches.\n\nWhile still a junior club, Shannon became co-tenants with Bohemians RFC at the Munster RFU-owned grounds at famed Thomond Park. In 1967, they completed their own Club Pavilion there. In 1978, the Pavilion was extended to the size it is today. There is talk currently of a further extension as the needs of a successful club in this professional age expand rapidly.\n\nA great milestone in the history of the club was the celebration of their centenary in 1984. In a long and illustrious history Shannon have won everything that has to be won in the game. However, that does not diminish the hunger for success that is the hallmark of Shannon teams at every level.\n\nHonours\n\n* AIB League\n\n** \"Winners\" 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2005-06: 8\n\n*AIB Cup\n\n** 2008: 1\n\n*Munster Senior Cup\n\n**\"Winners\": 1960, 1977, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998, 1999-00, 2000-01, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007-08: 19\n\n*Munster Junior Cup\n\n**\"Winners\": 1914, 1920, 1924-25, 1939-40, 1954, 1961-62, 1996: 7\n\n*Munster Senior League\n\n**\"Winners\": 1981, 1986, 1989, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05: 7\n\nNotable Players\n\n=Munster=\n\nThree Shannon players, Brendan Foley, Colm Tucker and Gerry McLoughlin, played for the Munster side that defeated the touring All Blacks 12-0 on October 31 1978 at Thomond Park.
