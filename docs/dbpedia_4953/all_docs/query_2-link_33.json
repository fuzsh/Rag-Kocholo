        "text": "MJ Flood are delighted to announce our role as one of the primary sponsors for Shannon RFC XV and Shannon Underage Mini section throughout the upcoming season.\n\nShannon RFC, with its roots dating back to February 1884, when it was founded at the Shamrock Bar on Corbally Road in Limerick, has a rich history. Throughout its journey, Shannon has called various fields its temporary home, including the field at the Island Bank, Gilligan’s field, Johnny Cusack’s field, and Egan’s Field in Corbally. Today, Shannon proudly calls Thomond Park its home grounds. The club stands as one of Ireland’s premier amateur teams, with numerous players who have advanced to the ranks of professional and international rugby.\n\nAs the season unfolds, we extend our best wishes to the entire team.\n\nPictured left to Right, Noel Moore, Chair of Finance, Alan Flannery, Gordon Benson, Josh Costello and Stephen Keogh, Director of Rugby"
