        "text": "Marcus Smith's brilliant drop goal against Ireland at the weekend got me reminiscing about Jonny Wilkinson's World Cup winning drop goal in 2003! I've heard Sir Clive Woodward talk a few times and read his book more than once and he tells a powerful story about the kick. In summary, he says it wasn't just talent and Jonny's steady nerves. He explains how one of their training mantras was practising ‘Thinking Clearly Under Pressure (TCUPS).’ They had brainstormed the matches and the things that might put them under pressure and worked out how they would handle them and practised them repeatedly. So Jonny had visualised taking a winning kick in the last minute and exactly what he would do to keep himself calm and capable in that situation. A great metaphor for business. Being a leader is tough. A never ending to-do list. Deadlines to meet. Customers to satisfy. Stakeholders to keep on board. The list goes on … 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥 𝐨𝐧 𝐚 𝐝𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐬. So using the TCUPS principle. What pressures do you currently have? What are the challenges your team might face? And how will you handle them? You can't plan for everything, but you can plan for the most likely and the most critical!\n\nBy joining the Sharemnt Group [LinkedinGroup.ShareMNT.com], you can interact with other members, comment on their posts, and get feedback on your own ideas, you can also post your own content and get exposure to a wider audience. 👉 To join the Sharemnt Group on LinkedIn, you can also follow these steps: 1.

But, as the world community of rugby strives to make the game more accessible, more widespread and competitive, fans can look forward to a lot of great matches in the upcoming summer and autumn International Series.

So for the fans who can actually attend or have access to streaming services, the following countries will be in action: South Africa; New Zealand; England; Argentina; Ireland; Fiji; Australia; Scotland; France; Japan; plus Georgia; the USA; Portugal; Chile and Uruguay.
