        "text": "We have just completed the 3rd year of our clubs strategic plan “Shannon 23”\n\nThe aim is to have 23 of a Shannon AIL Match day squad made up of players that have come through our underage or u20 set ups.\n\nThe plan is based on increasing the numbers of players who come through our underage into adult rugby for both Men & Women whilst simultaneously raising the standard of coaching for both players and coaches alike.\n\nWe are already seeing the benefits of this approach, but the real reward will be further down the line when we see the increase numbers of home-grown players lining out for our adult teams.\n\nSenior:\n\nRetaining our 1A status was always our goal and having achieved it we now move onto the next phase of consolidation. We are well aware of the challenges that will lie ahead. We have also taken this time to strengthen our coaching ticket. Stephen Keogh takes the role of Senior DOR, assisted by Gerry Casey, Matt Browne & Tom Hayes with Pat Brown as Chairman of Football.\n\nWomens Rugby:\n\nThe hard work done at underage level is starting to bear fruit with more taking up the game at a young age. Women’s Director of Rugby Eddie Fraher has devised a strategic plan which will look to increase the standard of Coaching, S&C and recruitment from the senior team all the way down to underage teams whilst harnessing the ever increasing numbers of Rugby specific underage athletes we are producing.\n\nUnder 20:\n\nThe under 20s won the North Munster League, North Munster Cup & for the first time in the clubs History the Donal Walsh Trophy last season. It has been one of the most fruitful U20 campaigns in a long time and the expert coaching and guidance from Ross O’Loughlin, Davey Quinlan, Cormac O’Loughlin, Mark Kennedy continues this season."
