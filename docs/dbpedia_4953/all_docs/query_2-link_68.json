        "text": "Last Friday was a dark day for rugby in Athlone with the passing of two members, Pat McManus and Gerry McNamara, after long illnesses borne with fortitude.\n\nBoth Pat McManus and Gerry McNamara had made notable contributions to the sport in different eras. Pat was president of Buccaneers RFC at the turn of the millennium while Gerry captained Athlone RFC during the 1970s.\n\nPat was club President in season 1999/2000 when Buccs played in the top-flight of the All-Ireland League. Work brought the Dubliner to Athlone where he became involved, initially at underage level, in the club when family members took up the sport.\n\nHe held many roles over a number of decades including Senior squad manager and doing video work for the Pirates teams as well as serving on the Executive Committee. An interesting character and enjoyable company, Pat’s other sporting and leisure passions included boating on the river Shannon, music and travel.\n\nHeartfelt condolences are extended to his wife Marie, sons Philip, James and Patrick and daughters Linda and Marie, and also to the wider family, relatives and friends. May Pat rest in peace.\n\nPat McManus of Cloghanboy Crescent, Athlone, Co. Westmeath (late of Cornamagh and formerly of Dún Laoghaire, Co. Dublin) died peacefully surrounded by his loving family on Friday, August 2\n\nPredeceased by his beloved parents Patsy and Mary, Pat will be sadly missed by his loving wife Marie, sons Philip, James and Patrick, daughters Linda (Guildea) and Marie (Wykes), sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, his adoring grandchildren Brian, Philip, Clare, Joe and Luke, his great-grandchildren Jason, Kate, Philip, Ava, Amber and Hollie, relatives and many friends.\n\nFollowing reposing at the residence of his son Philip, Pat's funeral service took place on Sunday in Killinure Chalets followed by private cremation.\n\nGerry McNamara captained Athlone to their first Connacht Senior League and Cup double in 1976-77. He had played in the 1974 Cup final defeat to UCG before skippering the midlanders to the club’s second Senior Cup triumph just two years later. The army officer again wore the captain’s armband when Athlone lost the 1978 decider after extra time.\n\nCapped by Connacht in 1975, ‘Troggy’s’ inspirational leadership, work ethic and organisation on and off the pitch improved standards that marked him as one of the club’s truly influential players.\n\nDeepest sympathy is extended to his wife Rita, sons David and Shane, daughters Emer and Maeve and all the wider family, friends and colleagues. May Gerry rest in eternal peace.\n\nGerry McNamara (Brigadier General, retired) of Árd-na-Gaoithe, Clybaun Road, Knocknacarra, Galway and formerly of Shantalla Place, Galway died at University Hospital Galway Galway after an illness bravely borne with his family by his side on August 2.\n\nPredeceased by his parents John and Patricia and siblings Seán and Mary. Deeply loved and mourned by his wife Rita; sons and daughters David, Shane, Emer and Maeve and their partners Mary, Shirley and Neil. Very sadly missed by his much-loved grandsons Josh, Jake, James, Zach, Noah and Lucas and granddaughters Lily, Ellie-Mae and Leah. Gerry will be always fondly remembered by his brother-in-law Francie and his wife Mary Pillion, nieces Fiona, Yvonne and Emma, nephews Ian and Gerard, relatives and friends.\n\nRequiem Mass was celebrated for Gerry at the Church of the Sacred Heart, Seamus Quirke Road, Galway yesterday (Tuesday), after which he was laid to rest in Rahoon cemetery.\n\nBuccaneers RFC also extends condolences to Lloyd Pickwell, daughter Sheena and family on the death in Western Australia of his wife Annette Healy-Pickwell. Lloyd was President of Athlone RFC in 1979/80 and Annette was an active member of the club's Ladies Committee. In addition, deepest sympathy is extended to Regina Bushell and family on the passing of her sister, Assunta Delaney."
