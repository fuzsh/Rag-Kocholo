        "text": "The generally accepted date of formation for various clubs is faithfully reproduced below, but they have not all been verified. Many people have asked \"What was the first Rugby club ?\". Before answering such a question there are others that need to be considered (Some possible answers have been provided below, but no doubt other historians might have different views):\n\n1) What is a Club? A group of persons organized for a social, literary, athletic, political, or other purpose.\n\n2) What is a Rugby Club? An athletic club organized to play football according to Rugby rules/laws. Schools do not qualify as clubs, e.g. Marlborough school (1850) where Rugby rules were adopted but without hacking, however, former pupil clubs would qualify.\n\n3) What Rules/Laws should apply? Some type of general adoption of Rugby Rules/Laws is required, (as was generally the case when an Old Rugbeian introduced the rules to a school or club). There was, for example, a football club founded in Edinburgh in 1824 by John Hope which lasted 10 years but this is too early to be associated with either Rugby or Association football since at that time there were no written Rugby or Association rules. Note: later other clubs published rules e.g. Blackheath 1862 [4]\n\n4) What if the club had some local variations? Rugby rules were documented at Rugby School Aug 28th, 1845 but these were far from exhaustive and many clubs instituted local variations see laws. Often captains would meet prior to games to thrash out which rules would apply, and then also arbitrate during the game itself [3]. So this particular issue is open to a wide range of interpretations.\n\n5) From what point is the Rugby Club officially founded/formed? When it holds its first general meeting to formalize the constitution of the club.\n\n6) Doesn't the first documented game count as when the club was founded? Whether against itself (which was often the case) or against an opponent, no, since many clubs played a number of informal games prior to the club becoming official.\n\n7) Does it still need to be in existence? No, however, if the question was phrased \"Which of today's rugby clubs is the oldest?\" then obviously yes. The next problem would be \"what if it had a break in service for some period e.g. during the world wars?\""
