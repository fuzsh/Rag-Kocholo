        "text": "#WTWAviationConf24! This years conference will build on the outstanding success of the WTW 2023 conference, which aims to bring the airline, aviation and insurance industries together to debate market trends and the breadth of risks facing the sector now and in the future, including geopolitics, safety, data, operational challenges and ESG.\n\nThe big #fail from #Delta this week isn‚Äôt only the inability to recover as quickly as the other airlines, it‚Äôs the way they have dodged responsibility. This line at #PBI took 3 hours to navigate. No one from Delta was out in front explaining what was happening or what the next steps would be. The rank & file take their cues from the top. All companies face challenging times, how leadership responds is indicative of both character & competence. #Delta failed in both areas.\n\nAs I said before, sims not always fulfill the training requirements for certain tasks such as respond to IIMC or unusual attitude recovery procedure, companies should set a real training program, based on the individual reaction to a loss of visibility or spatial desorientation for each pilot, of course it will demand more flight time which means money, specially for the IPs, examiners and evaluators who should demonstrate a higher level of proficiency on the task so they can transmit that sense of confidence to their pilots.\n\nüí°Have you met @Christelle Becmeur and Sandrine Osselin-Legrand? Discover our saga \"On board with LRA\" of video portraits of about the aerospace insurance business. üë®‚úàÔ∏è Who are you? Christelle Becmeur: I'm part of the Aerospace Underwritting team. Sandrine Osselin: I'm also part of of the Aerospace team, Underwritting in particular. üõ©Ô∏è On board: Christelle Becmeur: I've been at La R√©union A√©rienne since May 2002. Sandrine Osselin: And me, I've been at La R√©union A√©rienne for over ten years now. üì£ Whatis LRA for you ? Christelle Becmeur: La R√©union A√©rienne is a business environment that's stimulating and rewarding and it's a field which is both complex and exciting. Sandrine Osselin : For me, La R√©union A√©rienne, is diversity. When I arrived, I had a master's degree in analytical chemistry. So, you might as well say nothing to do with aviation insurance. #aviationsafety #aviation #aerospatial"
