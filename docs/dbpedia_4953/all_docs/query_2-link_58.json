        "text": "n_estimatorsint, default=100\n\nThe number of trees in the forest.\n\nChanged in version 0.22: The default value of n_estimators changed from 10 to 100 in 0.22.\n\ncriterion{“gini”, “entropy”, “log_loss”}, default=”gini”\n\nThe function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are “gini” for the Gini impurity and “log_loss” and “entropy” both for the Shannon information gain, see Mathematical formulation. Note: This parameter is tree-specific.\n\nmax_depthint, default=None\n\nThe maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.\n\nmin_samples_splitint or float, default=2\n\nThe minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:\n\nIf int, then consider min_samples_split as the minimum number.\n\nIf float, then min_samples_split is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each split.\n\nChanged in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.\n\nmin_samples_leafint or float, default=1\n\nThe minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.\n\nIf int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number.\n\nIf float, then min_samples_leaf is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each node.\n\nChanged in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.\n\nmin_weight_fraction_leaffloat, default=0.0\n\nThe minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.\n\nmax_features{“sqrt”, “log2”, None}, int or float, default=”sqrt”\n\nThe number of features to consider when looking for the best split:\n\nIf int, then consider max_features features at each split.\n\nIf float, then max_features is a fraction and max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_)) features are considered at each split.\n\nIf “sqrt”, then max_features=sqrt(n_features).\n\nIf “log2”, then max_features=log2(n_features).\n\nIf None, then max_features=n_features.\n\nChanged in version 1.1: The default of max_features changed from \"auto\" to \"sqrt\".\n\nNote: the search for a split does not stop until at least one valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to effectively inspect more than max_features features.\n\nmax_leaf_nodesint, default=None\n\nGrow trees with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.\n\nmin_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0\n\nA node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.\n\nThe weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:\n\nN_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)\n\nwhere N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.\n\nN, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.\n\nAdded in version 0.19.\n\nbootstrapbool, default=True\n\nWhether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the whole dataset is used to build each tree.\n\noob_scorebool or callable, default=False\n\nWhether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score. By default, accuracy_score is used. Provide a callable with signature metric(y_true, y_pred) to use a custom metric. Only available if bootstrap=True.\n\nn_jobsint, default=None\n\nThe number of jobs to run in parallel. fit, predict, decision_path and apply are all parallelized over the trees. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.\n\nrandom_stateint, RandomState instance or None, default=None\n\nControls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used when building trees (if bootstrap=True) and the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best split at each node (if max_features < n_features). See Glossary for details.\n\nverboseint, default=0\n\nControls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.\n\nwarm_startbool, default=False\n\nWhen set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole new forest. See Glossary and Fitting additional trees for details.\n\nclass_weight{“balanced”, “balanced_subsample”}, dict or list of dicts, default=None\n\nWeights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.\n\nNote that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].\n\nThe “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))\n\nThe “balanced_subsample” mode is the same as “balanced” except that weights are computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree grown.\n\nFor multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.\n\nNote that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.\n\nccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0\n\nComplexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than ccp_alpha will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning for details.\n\nAdded in version 0.22.\n\nmax_samplesint or float, default=None\n\nIf bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.\n\nIf None (default), then draw X.shape[0] samples.\n\nIf int, then draw max_samples samples.\n\nIf float, then draw max(round(n_samples * max_samples), 1) samples. Thus, max_samples should be in the interval (0.0, 1.0].\n\nAdded in version 0.22.\n\nmonotonic_cstarray-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None"
