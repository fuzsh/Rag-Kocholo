They currently play in Division 2 of the AIB League. Founded in 1872, they originally played as \"Queen’s College Cork\", as UCC was then known. Recent successes include winning the All Ireland U-20 Championship in 2002. In the same year, they also reached the AIB League playoffs for the first time, narrowly missing out on promotion to Division 1. Leading players in that team included Denis Leamy, Stephen Keogh and Frank Murphy, all of whom went onto play for Munster [ [http://www.uccrugby.ie/clubhistory.aspx www.uccrugby.ie] ] .\n\nNotable Former Players\n\nru|IRE\n\nIn 1879 Ashley Cummins became the first UCC player to represent Ireland. Since then at least 55 UCC players have played for the full national team. 34 of these played for Ireland while still playing for UCC. Donal Lenihan was the last UCC player to be capped by Ireland while still attached to the club.\n\nBILru|British Lions\n\nAs well as representing Ireland, at least 9 UCC players also went onto represent the British and Irish Lions. At least two of these players, Mick Lane and Tom Kiernan, were still UCC players when they toured with the Lions [\"The Ireland Rugby Miscellany\" (2007): Ciaran Cronin] .\n\n\"see also cl|University College Cork R.F.C. players\"\n\nHonours\n\n\"UCC\"\n\n*All Ireland U-20 Championship\n\n**\"Winners\": 2001-02: 1\n\n* Munster Senior League\n\n**\"Winners\" 1913, 1914, 1931, 1933. 1934, 1936, 1942 1943, 1945, 1950, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1974, 1978, 1981, 1985: 17\n\n**\"Runners Up\" 1955, 1957, 1959, 1965, 1966, 1982, 1992: 7\n\n*Munster Senior Rugby Cup\n\n**\"Winners\": 1912. 1913, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1941, 1950, 1951, 1955, 1963, 1976, 1981: 13\n\n**\"Runners Up\" : 1914, 1930, 1938, 1942, 1952, 1960, 1966, 1990: 8\n\n*Munster Junior Cup\n\n**\"Winners\": 1921, 1933, 1950, 1953, 1963, 1967, 1969, 1975, 1977, 1979: 10\n\n**\"Runners Up\" : 1972, 1980, 1981, 1996, 2005: 4\n\n\"Queens College Cork\"\n\n*Munster Senior Rugby Cup\n\n**\"Winners\": 1887, 1888, 1897, 1900,1901: 5\n\n**\"Runners Up\" : 1890, 1892, 1903, 1905: 4\n\nReferences\n\nExternal Links"
