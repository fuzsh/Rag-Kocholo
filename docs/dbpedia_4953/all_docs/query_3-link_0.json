        "text": "Located in the shadows of Thomond Park, Shannon R.F.C. is well known and respected in rugby circles worldwide. Shannon was established in 1884, in the historic heart of the city. It boasts of a rich tradition in Limerick, and through the success on the field, the club has contributed in a major way to enriching community life and adding to the sporting and cultural heritage of the city.\n\nWith a record nine All Ireland Titles, Shannon is Ireland's most successful club. Over 20 players from the club have represented Ireland at senior International level with three being selected for the Lions (Colm Tucker: 1980, Gerry McLoughlin: 1983, Mick Galwey: 1993). In more recent times the club has provided many Munster players. We have also had ten senior ladies internationals.\n\nFrom its formation, Shannon remained a junior club for the best part of 70 years, during which time Shannon supplied numerous players to Garryowen's successful senior sides. Shannon won the Munster Junior Cup for the first of many times in 1914. Their first Transfield cup was won in 1938. The following year, the Munster Junior Cup was won again. One year later(1940), in the process of winning their first Charity Cup, they added both the Munster Junior Cup and Transfield Cup.\n\nShannon's continued and consistent success as a junior club eventually led to the club attaining senior status in the 1953-54 season, becoming Limerick's fifth senior club.\n\nWhile still a junior club, Shannon became co-tenants with Bohemians RFC at the Munster RFU-owned grounds at famed Thomond Park. In 1967, they completed their own Club Pavilion there. In 1978, the Pavilion was extended to the size it is today.\n\nA great milestone in the history of the club was the celebration of their centenary in 1984. In a long and illustrious history Shannon have won everything that has to be won in the game. However, that does not diminish the hunger for success that is the hallmark of Shannon teams at every level."
