This study aims at monitoring the image of the Moroccan school in the

written media, both paper and electronic, and was limited to a specific sample

according to special criteria. In this study, the researcher started from the

following questions after determining the research problem

â¢ What is the nature of the picture painted by the national newspapers on

the Moroccan school?

â¢ Does this picture differ according to the type of newspaper? (Partisan /

independent - paper/digital)

This study also attempted to answer these questions to reveal the nature

of this picture by developing a content analysis network designed for this purpose

in consultation with experts in the field; including a group of constituents of the

Moroccan school.

After extracting the data, analyzing, interpreting and discussing them in

light of the hypotheses and the previous studies, the researcher concluded the

following results:

â¢ The image of the Moroccan school oscillates between negative and positive

for a part of the research sample

â¢ The image of the Moroccan school is negative for the other part of the

sample.

â¢ Moroccan educational discourse is still influenced by the background of the

newspaper that adopts it

The study came to a certain number of recommendations, including

â¢ The need of the Ministry's will to develop a clear media plan to communicate

with the media and provide them with what is needed to cover the news

related to the educational system as a whole, and the school in particular

â¢ invite the press to look at the pros and cons of the school, and to monitor the

negatives and criticism
