        "text": "Izear Luster Turner Jr.\n\ncraigr244\n\nIke Turner was born Izear Luster Jr. on November 5th, 1931 in Clarksdale, Mississippi.\n\nTurner and his associated bands would come late to the “Chitlin’ Circuit” era one of its ‘second generation’ of musicians – bands who were more prone to mix it up – more leaning toward the true spirit of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nNot long after “Rockett 88” hit the scene, Turner would make the move to West Memphis, Arkansas where he played with several bands and would work for a time, producing songs for Sam Phillips in Memphis.\n\nTurner would begin composing in earnest and provided many songs for musicians recording for Modern Records which was based out of Los Angeles.\n\nMany musicians would pass through Turner’s bands and members often would serve as session musicians for Turner compositions and productions. Ike was a tough task master in the beginning establishing many rules for his bands, including a no-drug policy which was enforced with dismissals.\n\nIke Turner would meet Anna Mae Bullock in 1957 and she would become a permanent member of his band in 1958. Their act became known as the “Ike and Tina Revue” and in 1960 the group would hit the Chitlin’ Circuit. They would record on many labels including four of Ike’s own.\n\nAn altercation between Ike and Tina resulted in a break-up in 1976 Ike kept plugging away well into the 21st Century.\n\nIke Turner passed away on December 12th, 2007 probably as a result of drug use which took its toll. He was 76 years old.\n\nRecognition\n\nGrammy Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Group “Proud Mary” – 1972\n\nBlues Hall of Fame Classic Blues Recording “Rocket 88” – 1991\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame
