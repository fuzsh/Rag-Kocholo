In fact, he was one of the first blues guitarists to take full advantage of the new Fender Stratocaster - especially with his liberal use of the \"whammy bar.\" Ike mixed traditional blues runs and rhythms along with some wild playing on the bass strings to produce a truly unique style. Ike recorded a number of fantastic instrumentals while playing guitar on numerous recordings with his famous Kings of Rhythm."
