        "text": "Ike Turner’s career began when he formed his first group, “the Top Hatters”, in high school. Later this group evolved into “the Kings of Rhythm” and worked the Delta juke joints.\n\nIn 1951, his band recorded “Rocket ‘88” at Sam Phillips’ Sun studio in Memphis with lead vocal by saxophonist Jackie Brenston. Unfortunately for Ike, “Brenston and the Delta Cats’, not “Ike Turner and the Kings of Rhythm”, got the label credit. It became a #1 R&B hit on the Chess label, and over the years it has been frequently cited as one of the first true rock & roll records.\n\nIke Turner went on to become a top session guitarist, talent scout, and producer through the Fifties. The sessions he recorded with Junior Parker and Howlin’ Wolf, B. B. King, Otis Rush, Roscoe Gordon, Bobby “Blue” Bland, and Johnny Ace were leased to Chess, Modern, and RPM Records.\n\nIn 1956, Turner moved to St. Louis, where he and his newly reconstituted Kings of Rhythm became a hot draw at several nightclubs.\n\nAnna Mae Bullock was born in Brownsville, Tennessee in 1939 and raised nearby in the small town of Nutbush. She and her older sister Alline relocated to St. Louis in 1956, after being deserted by their mother and later, their father. The sisters became regular singers at local dance clubs, and Anna Mae would repeatedly ask Ike Turner if she could sing with his band. He said that she could, but never called her to the stage.\n\nOne night, 16 year old Anna Mae, who had never sung professionally, but had been appearing in talent shows since childhood, simply grabbed the microphone and started singing. Ike invited her to join the band and gave her the stage name of “Tina”.\n\nWhile touring with the group, she became pregnant by Ike’s saxophone player [you have to watch out for those sax players! -RS] and gave birth to her first son, Raymond.\n\nTina later moved into Ike’s house, began a relationship with Ike, and eventually, also gave birth to Ike’s baby. They were married in a quickie Tijuana ceremony, which turned out to be illegal, since Ike never bothered to divorce his first wife.\n\nEven so, they first recorded as “Ike and Tina Turner” in 1960 after a singer failed to appear for a session. Tina stood in for the missing singer, and the song, “A Fool in Love” became a hit in 1960 (#27 pop, #2 R&B).\n\nIke then developed his entire revue around Tina. With nine musicians and three scantily clad female background singers called “the Ikettes”, the Ike and Tina Turner Revue became a major soul act.\n\nIn 1961 they charted with “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine” (#14 pop, #2 R&B) and “I Idolize You” (#5 R&B). The following year, “Poor Fool” (#38 pop, #4 R&B) and “Tra La La La La” (#9 R&B) were hits.\n\nFrom the mid-Sixties on, they were major stars in England, where artists such as the Rolling Stones were unabashed fans.\n\nIn 1966, Phil Spector produced what proved to be his last ‘Wall of Sound’ single, “River Deep, Mountain High.” It went to #3 in England, but did so poorly in the U.S. that Spector did not produce again until 1969.\n\nThe Turners continued to make pop hits into the late Sixties. They opened for the Rolling Stones on their 1969 tour. They were especially successful into the early Seventies with steamy cover songs like “Come Together” (#57 pop, #21 R&B), “I Want to Take You Higher” (#34 pop, #25 R&B), and “Proud Mary” (#4 pop, #5 R&B), featuring Tina’s “We never, ever do nothin’ nice and easy” spoken intro.\n\nIn 1973, “Nutbush City Limits” (written by Tina) hit #4 in England and #13 R&B and #22 pop in the U.S. Two years later, Tina got her first movie role, playing the Acid Queen in one of the most memorable scenes of Ken Russell’s film version of the Who’s Tommy.\n\nIke had assumed complete control over Tina’s life, forcing her to work a gruelling tour schedule and beat her if she got out of line. According to Tina, and as she wrote in her 1986 bestselling autobiography, “I, Tina“, her life with Ike was marked by near-constant physical and emotional abuse.\n\nBy the late Sixties, Ike had become deeply involved with cocaine and alcohol and was prone to violent outbursts. Tina’s litany of his crimes against her include hitting her, pouring hot coffee on her face, burning her lip with a lighted cigarette, and forcing her to perform while ill and pregnant.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful suicide attempt in 1968, Tina finally walked out on Ike in 1975, carrying nothing more than thirty-six cents and a gas station credit card. Career-wise, it seemed like the end for Tina, who many thought would disappear without Ike’s musical muscle. Tina relinquished almost all claims for compensation, deciding her complete freedom from Ike was more important than the money. In debt, she briefly lived on food stamps before climbing her way back up by working small-time nightclub gigs six days a week.\n\nTwo years later, her divorce from Ike was final. Ike has often indicated publicly that, while he does not deny having battered Tina, he denies that her version of events is entirely true.\n\nIn 1979, Tina met Roger Davies, a young Australian manager who had recently relocated to Los Angeles. Davies took the challenge of helping Tina redefine and revamp her career. With his help, Tina rediscovered the rock ‘n’ roll raunch of her best records, infused it with the intuitive soulfulness she had never lost, and started over again.\n\nTina’s comeback began in earnest in 1981, when the Rolling Stones offered her a few opening spots on their U.S. tour. Around that time she also opened some shows for Rod Stewart and toured the world. In 1983 she landed a solo recording deal and by year’s end had a UK hit with her steamy cover of Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together” (#26 pop; #6 U.K.).\n\nAnd as 1984 dawned, Tina prepared for the release of a new album: “Private Dancer“. Propelled by the single “What’s Love Got To Do With It“, “Private Dancer” went on to attain worldwide sales in excess of 11 million copies, and ushered in an extraordinary catalogue of achievements for Tina over the next decade — achievements made all the sweeter by the rough times which preceded them. She followed with “Better Be Good to Me” (#5, 1984) and “Show Some Respect” (#37, 1985).\n\nHer next two singles were non-album songs from the Mel Gibson film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” (1985), in which Tina co-starred as Auntie Entity: “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)” (#2, 1985) and “One Of The Living” (#15, 1985). Tina swept the 1984 Grammys, with “What’s Love Got to Do With It“, winning Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and “Better Be Good to Me” taking Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. “What’s Love” was also recognized as Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nBreak Every Rule (#4, 1986), another platinum release, included “Typical Male” (#2, 1986), “Two People” (#30, 1986), and “What You Get Is What You See” (#13, 1987).\n\nIn late 1985 she released a live duet with Bryan Adams, “It’s Only Love“, which went to #15 in the U.S.\n\nTina, long legendary for her live shows, toured tirelessly. She has always been especially popular in Europe and in England, where “Tina Live in Europe” went to #8 as compared to #86 in the States.\n\nShe did a duet with Mick Jagger at Live Aid in 1985 and is a favourite of British rock stars. Her international tours broke records in many cities.\n\nIn 1989, Tina’s first album of new material in over three years, “Foreign Affair” went to number 31 on the album charts. Its singles included “The Best” (#15, 1989), which featured a sax solo by Edgar Winter, and Tony Joe White’s “Steamy Windows” (#39, 1990). While it was not her most successful album in the U.S., it outsold Private Dancer in the UK.\n\nAlso in 1989, Tina celebrated her 50th birthday with a star-studded party that included Mark Knopfler (who wrote “Private Dancer“), Eric Clapton, and other admirers.\n\nTina and Rod Stewart’s remake of the Marvin Gaye-Tammi Terrell hit “It Takes Two” went to #5 in the UK. in 1990.\n\nA year later, her greatest-hits package, “Simply the Best” went to #1 in the UK. but didn’t make the Hot 100 albums chart in North America.\n\nIn 1992, Turner signed with Virgin Records. Her first single for that label, “I Don’t Wanna Fight” (#9, 1993), was co-written by Steve DuBerry and Lulu.\n\nAround the time Tina left Ike Turner, Ike retired to his studio in Inglewood, California, and released two solo LPs. The studio was destroyed by fire in 1982.\n\nAfter 11 arrests on various charges in 1990, Ike was convicted on several charges, including possessing and transporting cocaine, and sentenced to 18 months in jail.\n\nHe was in prison when he and Tina were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1991. In September of that year, he was released from jail and has since attempted to sell his own autobiography.\n\nTina’s book was made into a hit feature film, “What’s Love Got To Do With It” (1993).\n\nFollowing an extended period of relative silence (though she did show off her legs in a series of pantyhose commercials), Tina Turner once again got ready to strut her stuff on stage. In 1997, she embarked on her first North American tour in six years. Proving her staying power, Turner’s tour proved to be the seventh most popular draw of 1997, earning $24.8 million.\n\nTwo years later, Tina was once again ready to prove her stage prowess. On April 13th, she joined Whitney Houston, Cher, and Brandy on the stage of New York City’s Beacon Theater as one of VH1’s second wave of “Divas Live“. Other events on Turner’s 1999 calendar included a “greatest hits” album as well as a fall tour with Elton John.\n\nIn the fall of the year 2000, at age 61, Tina announced that she would no longer be involved with large scale tours. She played the final show of her farewell tour in front of 18,000 fans who packed the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, 30 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, on December 6th. At year’s end, she was declared the most popular touring act of 2000, earning over $80 Million, outselling the Back Street Boys, N’Sync and Brittany Spears.\n\nTina continued to give some live performances however, working from her home in Switzerland, where she has lived since 1994. In September, 2004, she released a new “Greatest Hits”, double CD, which contains all of her hits dating back to her days with Ike, as well as three new songs.\n\nThe broad-ranging accomplishments of her 40 year career underscore Tina Turner’s status as one of the consummate performers of our time. Although she is a deeply private person, in her professional life, she is one of the world’s most widely recognized entertainers and her recordings will continue to touch millions of fans with the same energy and urgency that she had displayed way back in her teens (when she grabbed Ike’s mic).\n\nMeanwhile, Ike managed to rehabilitate his image somewhat in his later years, touring around the world with his band the Kings of Rhythm and drawing critical acclaim. He won a Grammy in 2007 in the Traditional Blues album category for “Risin’ With the Blues“. Sadly, Ike Turner died at his home in suburban San Diego on December 12th, 2007 after suffering a heart attack. He was 76.\n\nIn early May of 2008, it was announced that 68 year old Tina Turner would return to the stage in October with a 40 show tour of North America, likely to be followed by Europe and other international dates.\n\n–o–"
