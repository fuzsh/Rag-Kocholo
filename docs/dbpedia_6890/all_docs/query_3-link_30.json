        "text": "Ike Turner, music legend and all-around dangerous guy, died Wednesday in San Diego after miraculously managing to reach the age of 76.\n\nBut before I get to the part about his “allegedly” shooting a Daily Breeze newspaper carrier and how he “allegedly” beat the matchlessly beautiful Tina Turner senseless, I first need to summon up the Ike Turner musical legend.\n\nLong ago – actually this was 1951, making it long, long ago – Turner cut a record called “Rocket 88” at the legendary Sam Phillips studio in Memphis. Phillips, and his Sun Records, would go on to record Elvis, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and so many others that he seemed to own the dawning musical era that is still with us.\n\nThe song 19-year-old Turner recorded with his Kings of Rhythm is considered by many of those who care passionately about such things to be the very first rock ‘n’ roll recording ever. It was also, as far as I know, one of the first hit records dedicated to a car, in this case, the Oldsmobile 88 – a massively grilled and rounded Detroit iron that had been introduced into the emerging American car culture two years earlier.\n\nTurner himself had emerged from the blues-dripping mystical ooze that was the brutally segregated South. Born in 1931, he witnessed his own father’s lynching. By age 9 he had taken up the piano and hired on at a Clarksdale, Miss., radio station, where he got up close with blues performers Sonny Boy Williamson, Howlin’ Wolf, Bobby Blue Bland and B.B. King, who would call him the best band leader ever.\n\nImagine what it was like for a child with a profound musical bent to be exposed at such an early age to the real thing, to the sound that would give birth to all the sounds to follow.\n\nSomehow, that first big hit – a rarity loved by black and white kids alike – got credited to Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats. Brenston, the singer and sax player on the tune, got his name on the record along with the name of this group that didn’t actually exist. He also got the glory and free Olds 88 while Turner got a goodly dose of bitterness to go along with the feelings of rage and injustice that certainly weren’t helped by witnessing his father’s murder.\n\nTurner would go on to become a talent scout for Phillips and a big time session player. But he wouldn’t make a wider-world name for himself until he began recording in 1960 with the beautiful teenager, Anna Mae Bullock, whom he married and renamed Tina. Together they recorded “A Fool in Love,” “I Idolize You” and “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine.”\n\nThe pair were married in 1962 and divorced in 1976. In between lay a terrible saga that Tina revealed in her 1986 autobiography, “I, Tina,” that was later made into a hard-to-watch movie starring Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett. In both book and film, Turner comes off like a monumental ogre, a drug-crazed, wife-beating, musically gifted swine who never quite gets his comeuppance.\n\nLater – after his long fall and return to Grammy-nominated fame – he’d insist that his side of the story was never fairly represented. Though I don’t know how there actually can be another side to a story that involves spousal abuse unless you count “she was begging for it” as a good excuse.\n\nBut it’s like Shakespeare said, ain’t it? The good that men do is oft interred with their bones. And Turner did some groundbreaking musical good as one of the architects of rock and leader of one of the most exciting groups ever, one that didn’t really catch with mass audiences until Janis Joplin (who was voice-coached by Ike) mentioned on “The Dick Cavett Show” that the Turners were her inspiration and light.\n\nIf you don’t know the body of their work, all you really need to consider is the open-throttle sound of their “Proud Mary,” with Tina upstaging her husband and every other singer on the planet.\n\nLater, after they split and her solo career took off, she would become a kind of poster woman for other survivors who took it on the chin (in her case, it was a broken jaw) from rotten guys.\n\nFact is, many rock bands – including the Rolling Stones, whom they opened for – and legions of rappers owe a debt to both Turners. But especially to Ike whose misogynist stupidity put him in jail for 18 months, getting out in 1991 to say, “I regret that I’ve screwed up my life, but I’m not ashamed of nothing I did.”\n\nThis would probably also include an ugly incident that played out on April 13, 1981, on East Fairview Boulevard in Inglewood. Having earlier been convicted of possessing cocaine, a then down-on-his-luck, 49-year-old Turner was charged with one count of assault with a deadly weapon in connection with the wounding of Breeze deliveryman Andrew Francis.\n\nThe shooting stemmed from an incident in December of 1980 when Francis, whom I was unable to locate, allegedly hit Turner’s dog with a newspaper. Turner’s wife, Ann, reportedly argued with Francis, but nothing happened until four months later when, with the victim’s 12-year-old daughter watching, a man identified as Turner fired two shots from a handgun. One round struck the fleeing newspaper deliveryman in the ankle.\n\nIn Torrance Superior Court later that month before the late, great Judge John Shidler, Turner pleaded not guilty. Nine months later he was somehow acquitted after claiming that an unnamed “friend” fired the bullets.\n\nThe friend, never named, was arrested and released because victim and daughter couldn’t ID him. Not like they were able to finger Turner, who was acquitted because another witness placed him inside his apartment at the time of the shooting.\n\nAnd that was it, one ridiculously tawdry incident in a life greatly gifted but terribly marred by a man whose worst enemy lived within his own heart."
