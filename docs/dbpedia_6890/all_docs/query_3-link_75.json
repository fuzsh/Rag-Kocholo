        "text": "Ike Turner died Wednesday at 76. Mostly he will be remembered as the violent, abusive husband of Tina Turner. But it should not be forgotten that he was an idiosyncratic, influential musician whose fundamental contributions to rock-and-roll would probably never have been noticed had it not been for the eventual pop success of Ike and Tina Turner.\n\nCheck out the original version of “Rocket 88,’’ as rendered on YouTube, with Ike, the brains behind the song, demonstrating that he can boogie no matter how out-of-tune the piano. (By the way, you have to love the guy who put this together, interspersing photos of Ike’s band, the Kings of Rhythm with Jackie Brenston on vocals, with shots of actual Oldsmobile Rocket 88’s and, just for fun, Bettie Page rolling on her stockings!)\n\nNow, if you’re wondering what this has to do with wine, just bear with me, though really, I don’t need to make excuses for a Bettie Page sighting.\n\nIke also played a key role as a talent scout in the early days of Sun Studios in Memphis, before Elvis Presley, when Sam Phillips was recording blues performers like Howlin’ Wolf, Little Milton and the doubly diminutive Little Junior Parker. He then relocated to East St. Louis, where he continued as a live act and releasing a few great recordings like “Prancin’,’’ a start-and-stop whammy-bar workout released under the name Icky Renrut (turner spelled backwards).\n\nThe problem for Ike was this, as Sam Phillips put it in Colin Escott’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight:’’\n\n“I said, ‘Ike, man, you’re a hell of a piano player, you play guitar real good, but you just can’t sing.’ ‘’\n\nEnter Anna Mae Bullock, renamed Tina Turner, and the rest is history.\n\nSo, on to wine. Remember Ike and Tina’s routine with “Proud Mary,’’ , about, “Every now and then we do things nice and easy, and sometimes we like to do things … rough.’’\n\nI feel the same way about wine. There is certainly a place for nice, easy wines that slip softly down your throat. In fact, the whole world seems to have embraced them what with so many winemakers trying to make smooth, agreeable wines free of such bugaboos as noticeable tannins or acidity, not to mention occasional herbal flavors.\n\nPersonally speaking, I find many of the buzzwords of today, all the business about physiological ripeness and the so-called ripening of tannins, to be rationalizations for the fashionable stylistic choice to let grapes ripen far longer than was common 15 years ago, as a way of making softer, more approachable, sometimes sweeter wines. I’m not trying to tell growers what to do. I’m just saying that there’s no such thing as perfect ripeness, there’s simply a moment at which a grower decides is the right time to pick, and many considerations go into that decision.\n\nOne of those considerations is the fact that it is easier today to sell wines that are soft and require less aging than similar wines once did. Today you can find Bordeaux, Riojas, California cabernet sauvignons, Chiantis, Barolos, brunellos di Montalcino and many other wines that are far more accessible on release now than they were 20 years ago.\n\nI’m not saying there’s anything wrong with this. I am saying that, like Ike and Tina, I prefer things a little rough. I love wine with a rasp of tannin and acidity. It’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s to be embraced, especially with food.\n\nWhile there’s little doubt about which styles are in critical favor these days, I will say that I’m very happy to be living in a place where I can satisfy my stylistic preferences for wines that offer a little resistance."
