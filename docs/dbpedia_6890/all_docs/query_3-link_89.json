        "text": "Born: 5 November 1931\n\nDied: 12 December 2007 (aged 76)\n\nFull name: Izear Luster Turner Jr.\n\nIke was born in Clarkesdale, Mississippi, a city about 120kms south of Memphis, Tennessee. The city has been a rich source of musicians with Sam Cooke, Nate Dogg, John Lee Hooker and Rick Ross all having been born there and Muddy Waters grew up there. After quitting school, Ike would start playing in a big band called the Tophatters. He would go on to form a band called the Kings Of Rhythm and released a track called ‘Rocket 88’. The song was attributed to Jackie Brenston & His Delta Cats instead of Ike Turner and His Kings of Rhythm, an error Ike attributes to the record label. Brenston did sing lead vocals on the track. ‘Rocket 88’ made it to the top of the US R&B charts. In 1957 he teamed up with Ann Bullock who would later become Tina Turner. Their first single together, ‘A Fool In Love’ would get to 27 on the Hot 100 and the 2 would go on to produce 20 Hot 100 together, getting to 4 with ‘Proud Mary’, their only top 10 hit. Ike and Tina separated in 1976 and while Tina went on to have a successful solo career, Ike did not really make it without her and would suffer from drug addiction which would sadly lead to his death just before Christmas in 2007.\n\n‘Nutbush City Limits’ was a duet with Tina Turner."
