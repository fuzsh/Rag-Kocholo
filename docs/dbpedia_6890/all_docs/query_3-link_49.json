        "text": "Ike Turner Jr. — the son of legendary singer Tina Turner and Ike Turner — was reportedly arrested for crack cocaine possession and tampering with evidence just weeks before his mother’s death, Page Six has confirmed.\n\nAccording to People, who was the first to report the arrest, the 64-year-old was pulled over during the early hours of May 6 after police officers noticed one of his car’s lights was out.\n\nYet, when officers went to speak with the musician, he reportedly attempted to consume the narcotics in his possession.\n\n“He tried to eat the drugs before the officers could seize them from him,” Capt. Q.T. Arendell of the Alvin Police Department wrote in the incident report.\n\nThe police ended up seizing nearly two grams of crack cocaine and just under one gram of methamphetamine, according to the outlet.\n\nIke Jr.’s passenger, Jessica Salinas-Esquivel, is also reportedly being charged with possession of a controlled substance.\n\nIke Jr. has been detained at the Brazoria County Jail since his arrest and has not posted his $70,000 bail, Page Six confirmed.\n\nDue to his run-in with the law, the musician was behind bars when his mother passed away on May 24. She was 83.\n\nIke Jr. — who revealed in 2018 that he hadn’t spoken to his adoptive mother in nearly two decades — has yet to address her tragic death.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nSources told Page Six last month that Tina’s family was in shock about her passing, as many had not heard that she was seriously ill.\n\nAlthough the “Best” singer’s biological sons, Craig Turner and Ronnie Turner, died before her death, she is survived by Ike Jr. as well as son Michael Turner, whom she adopted in 1962.\n\nShe also left behind two grandchildren and five great-grandchildren — most of whom she never met.\n\nDespite falling out of touch with Tina, Ike Jr. worked alongside his parents for many years.\n\nIn fact, he even won a Grammy Award for producing his father’s album “Risin’ With The Blues” in the 2006 Traditional Blues Album category."
