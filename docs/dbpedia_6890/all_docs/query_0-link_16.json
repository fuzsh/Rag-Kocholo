        "text": "Ike and Tina Turner\n\nIt was in St. Louis that she met Ike Turner in 1956. He soon expanded a new lineup of his band the Kings of Rhythm to include Bullock, who had begged to sing with the band. She began performing as Tina Turner. The Ike and Tina Turner Revue thrived as a live act because of her fiery stage presence, a trio of female backing vocalists known as the Ikettes, and Ike’s guitar-playing antics. The two married, and the band toured heavily. Recording success eluded them, however, until the New York-based Sue label released a series of records that won them a national following. These included “Fool in Love” (1960), “I Idolize You” (1960), and “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine” (1961).\n\nIn 1966 Phil Spector made “River Deep, Mountain High” with Tina Turner. Easily the most complex and nuanced of Spector’s famous wall-of-sound productions, it was a hit in Britain. It attracted little U.S. attention, however.\n\nIke and Tina Turner repositioned themselves to appeal to the growing rock market in the late 1960s. They began to sell records again with their energetic reworkings of other people’s songs. Notable among these was a cover version of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary” (1971). Along with “Nutbush City Limits” (1973), written by Tina Turner, it proved to be their last major success.\n\nSolo Career\n\nTina began to realize that she, not Ike, was the attraction. After appearing in the film Tommy (1975), she divorced Ike in 1976—alleging years of physical abuse and infidelity on his part—and started over. She released a tell-all autobiography written with Kurt Loder entitled I, Tina (1986). With the help of an Australian manager and pop material written by European songwriters for her debut solo album, Private Dancer (1984), she became a major pop star. The album was a triumph, both critically and commercially. It sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and won three Grammy Awards. Its single “What’s Love Got to Do with It” became Turner’s signature song.\n\nTurner acted in the film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) and sang several songs on the soundtrack. What’s Love Got to Do with It?, a film based on her autobiography, was released in 1993. Turner continued to release albums and perform sporadically throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. All the Best, a collection of her best-known song renditions, was released in 2004. Ike Turner died in San Marcos, California, on December 12, 2007.\n\nAfter living in Switzerland for a number of years, Tina Turner became a Swiss citizen in 2013. She wrote a second autobiography, My Love Story (2018) as well as the self-help book Happiness Becomes You (2020; written with Taro Gold and Regula Curti).\n\nTurner received many awards and honors. Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Tina Turner received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2005 and a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2018. In 2021 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo performer. She died on May 24, 2023, in Küsnacht, Switzerland."
