        "text": "Tina Turner shaped over half a century of rock history. Anna Mae Bullock, born on 26 November 1939 in Brownsville, Tennessee (USA), raised in Nutbush and became a world star and legend as Tina Turner. From 1958 she performed alongside her husband Ike Turner and in 1984, she launched an outstanding comeback as a solo artist, until she went on tour for the last time in 2008, which was the grand live finale of an extraordinary career.\n\nIzear Luster Ike Turner was born in Clarksdale on November 05, 1931 and Anna Mae Bullock eight years later on November 26, 1939 in Nutbush, Tennessee. Ike was first a DJ at the local radio staion WROX and a member of the rhythm ensemble called The Tophatters. In the 40’s, he formed together with his friends Raymond Hill, Eugene Fox and Clayton Love the Kings of Rhythm. In the 1950’s, he became a session musician, contributing his piano play to some B.B. King tracks. 1951: His first single Rocket 88 was released under the name âJackie Brenston and His Delta Catsâ in April. 1956: The Kings of Rhythm settled in East St. Louis as one of the most highly rated group on the club circuit. 1957: After Anna Mae relocated to her mother Zelma Bullock to St. Louis, she and her sister Aillene were regulars at R&B clubs.\n\nOne evening at Club Manhattan, she takes to the stage during an intermission. Impressed by her voice, Ike invited her to join the band, giving her the stage name Little Ann. 1958: Anna Mae contributed background vocals on the single Boxtop and gave birth to band member Raymond Hill's son Craig. 1960: Their first record as Ike and Tina Turner comes about by accident when the singer booked for the recording session does not show up and Tina steps in. A Fool In Love is the duo's first crossover hit in the R&B and Pop charts. Ike's band became the Ike & Tina Turner Revue and three female backing singers, the first incarnation of The Ikettes are incorporated to support Tina. 1961: After minor success with singles from their debut album The Soul of Ike & Tina, they reached for the first time the top 20 with It's Gonna Work Out Fine.\n\nAt the same time, the Ike Turner written song I’m Blue (The Gong-Gong Song) was the first and very successful solo single from The Ikettes. The Ike and Tina Turner Revue was one of the most popular acts on the R&B tour circuit, which resulted in some live albums and many singles on a vast number of labels like Warner, Kent and Modern as well as on Ike’s own record label Sonja. 1966: Producer Phil Spector offered Ike $20,000 to put Tina under a production contract. The payment was also part of a condition that Ike took no part in the sessions. Tina recorded her vocal on River Deep, Mountain High after Spector has already spent over $22,000 creating the \"wall of sound\" backing track. Released on Spector’s Philles label, the single was only a minor success in America, but a major hit in England. European fans started their long love affair with Tina.\n\nThe Turners went on an UK tour as the opening act for The Rolling Stones, playing a major London date at the Royal Albert Hall and appeared at the TV-Show Ready, Steady, Go! 1969: After jumping from label to label, the duo signs a two-LP deal with Blue Thumb Records for the longplayers The Hunter and Outta Season (including Ike & Tina’s live signature song I’ve Been Loving You Too Long). The duo once again supports The Rolling Stones on their American tour in November. 1970: In December, they released their biggest selling LP to date in America with Workin’ Together. It features the R&B style cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s Proud Mary, their first top five and million-selling single, which brought them a Grammy Award. The live album What You Hear Is What You Get reached gold and sold over half a million copies in the US.\n\nThe success of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue gave Ike the finances to built his own recording studio Bolic Sound. 1971: The first result from the recording sessions was the album Nuff Said. Ike started also a new creative and artistic season and released some solo records. Ike & Tina were invited to participate in the Soul to Soul concert festival for Ghanas 14th Independence Day on March 6, 1971 in Accra with other stars like Wilson Picket and Santana. 1972: Tina had a short cameo in the documentary movie Cocksucker Blues from The Rolling Stones with the Stones in the dressing room at their North American tour. 1973: The double LP The World of Ike & Tina features live recordings from many European countries and the album Nutbush City Limits includes with Tina's stomping composition of the title track the duos next worldwide hit.\n\n1974: Sweet Rhode Island Red was the last studio album from Ike & Tina before they separated and Tina recorded at Bolic Sound her very first solo album with Tina Turns The Country On, which was nominated for a Grammy Award.

She had four children to support and after depending for a time on food stamps, she was guest on TV-Shows like Donny & Marie and Hollywood Squares. Ike struggled to find success as a solo artist and replaced Tina with Holly Maxwell. 1977: Tina made an agreement with Mike Stewart from United Artists to go back on the road with a Las Vegas style Tina Turner Show. For promotion, the single Under My Thumb was released in Australia, taken from the Acid Queen album, while Ike released leftovers from previous recording sessions on the album Delilah’s Power. 1978: The first solo album after leaving Ike was Rough, which features almost rock songs. But both, the album and the four singles were not successful.\n\nTo pay her debts, Tina was constantly on the road with her Wild Lady Of Rock concerts in hotels and small clubs. 1979: Tina's second solo album Love Explosion is much more disco influenced than it’s predecessor, but because the album as well as the singles also failed on the charts, she lost her recording contract in America. 1980: At the TV-Show Hollywood Nights, Tina met Olivia Newton-John’s manager Roger Davies, a young Australian trying to make it in the American music business.
