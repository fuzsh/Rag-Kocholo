        "text": "Musician Ike Turner did not have a valid will when he died of acocaine overdose in his San Marcos home in 2007, and thus his adultchildren are the heirs of his estate, a judge has tentativelyruled.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Richard Cline’s decision on the fate ofTurner’s estate comes at the end of a trial in a North Countycourtroom. The trial pitted three factions against each other:Turner’s adult children, Turner’s most recent ex-wife and anattorney who was a personal friend of the singer.\n\nTwo weeks after the trial ended, Cline issued a tentativefinding that sided with the children.\n\nThe children —- Turner had at least four, but possibly as manyas six —- argued their father died without a valid will, leavingthem as the direct heirs of his estate under state law.\n\n“We are really pleased with his ruling,” said attorney CarolynBrock, who represents Turner’s daughter Twanna Melby.\n\nThe 16-page ruling, obtained by the North County Times onFriday, lays out Cline’s reasons for his decision.\n\nTurner was found dead in his bedroom Dec. 12, 2007. His autopsyrevealed he died of a cocaine overdose.\n\nLess than a week after Turner died, ex-wife Audrey MadisonTurner filed a petition stating that her ex-husband had penned ahandwritten will naming her as a beneficiary.\n\nIke Turner wrote the will two months before he died.\n\nIn addition to Madison Turner’s claim, Turner’s friend andsometime attorney James Clayton produced a handwritten 2001 will inwhich Turner reportedly left everything to him, with instructionsto contact Turner’s daughter Melby to decide how to divvy up theestate.\n\nIn his tentative ruling, Cline said the will to Clayton wasvalid. But that will was invalidated when Turner wrote his will toMadison Turner in October 2007.\n\nAnd when Turner wrote a document to revoke his will to MadisonTurner a month later, he did not revive or reinstate his 2001 willto Clayton.\n\nThus, Cline has tentatively found, the musician died without avalid will.\n\nBut the judge’s decision is not final. Cline scheduled a hearingon Friday, at which time attorneys can make their pitch to changehis mind.\n\nCalls to the attorneys for Clayton and Madison Turner were notimmediately returned late Friday afternoon.\n\nThe value of the Grammy winner’s estate, however, remains amystery.\n\nThe accounting has not been completed, Cline noted in hisruling, although he said “there is a potential of substantialvalue” in Turner’s rights to about 4,000 songs.\n\nIncluded in that music catalog is all his work with famousformer wife Tina Turner, according to Leodis Matthews, whorepresents four of Ike Turner’s adult children in the probatebattle.\n\nAttorney Matthews said money was not the primary motivator forthe children in trying to win rights to their father’s estate.\n\n“The family wanted to be in control of his legacy,” Matthewssaid. “That is their primary goal.”\n\nA groundbreaking guitarist, pianist and bandleader who helpedpioneer early rock ‘n’ roll and modern rhythm and blues, Turner’sreputation was tarnished by drug addiction, a stint in prison ondrug-related charges and allegations on film and in print that heabused Tina Turner.\n\nIke Turner moved to San Marcos in 1991. In recent years, themusician had found critical acclaim when he returned to the rhythmand blues of his youth, releasing the Grammy-nominated “Here andNow” in 2001 and the Grammy-winning “Risin’ With the Blues” in2006.\n\nAccording to testimony, Turner had been clean for 14 yearsbefore returning to drugs in 2005.\n\nHis health became fragile and declined in the wake of the druguse, according to testimony.\n\nCall staff writer Teri Figueroa at 760-740-5442."
