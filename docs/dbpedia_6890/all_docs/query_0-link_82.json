        "text": "We are writing this post with a heavy heart. Charlie Watts, the only drummer the Rolling Stones ever had, has passed away at age 80. In Watts’ honor, we will re-use one of our earlier posts, but concentrate on the greatness of Watts and his importance to the Stones.\n\nWe decided to use the Stones’ classic rock song, Honky Tonk Women. We will first provide an appreciation of Charlie Watts and his drumming. Next we will feature covers of Honky Tonk Women by Ike & Tina Turner, and by Joe Cocker.\n\nThe Rolling Stones and Honky Tonk Women:\n\nThe Rolling Stones first formed in the early 60’s, when Brian Jones and pianist Ian Stewart joined forces with singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards. They then added bassist Bill Wyman. So now they needed to add a fine drummer.\n\nCharlie Watts was born in London in June 1941. His drumming career began as a boy, when he converted the body of his banjo into a snare drum. After Charlie graduated from the Harrow School of Art, he worked as a graphic artist for an advertising agency, although he moonlighted as a drummer with various jazz combos.\n\nWatts was then recruited to join Blues Incorporated, an R&B group fronted by Alexis Korner. The Stones decided that Watts would be a terrific addition to their band, but it took them a while before they could scrape together enough money to pay Charlie five pounds per week. At that point, Watts joined the Stones, cementing their initial lineup of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts.\n\nBelow is a photo of the Stones in 1969, following the death of Brian Jones. From L: drummer Charlie Watts; guitarist Mick Taylor; vocalist Mick Jagger; guitarist Keith Richards; bassist Bill Wyman.\n\nThe Rolling Stones then continued for almost 60 years with a lineup that saw remarkably few changes. Jagger, Richards and Watts played together until Watts’ death on August 24, 2021.\n\nThe Stones’ signature sound consisted of guitar riffs from Keith Richard and Mick Jagger’s great R&B vocals, but Charlie Watts’ steady, unflashy drumming gave a backbone to their songs. Watts was so dependable and so integral to the Rolling Stones that it is difficult to realize that rock ‘n roll was not at all his favorite music, and that he actively disliked the rock lifestyle.\n\n“I wasn’t interested in being a pop idol and sitting there with the girls screaming,” said Watts. “It’s not the world I come from. It’s not what I wanted to be, and I still think it’s silly.”\n\nHonky Tonk Women was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards during a period from Dec. 1968 to Jan. 1969 when they were both on holiday in Brazil. The song describes various women (generally of low repute) with whom the singer has had relationships.\n\nI met a gin-soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis\n\nShe tried to take me upstairs for a ride\n\nShe had to heave me right across her shoulder\n\nCause I just can’t seem to drink you off my mind\n\n[CHORUS] It’s the honky tonk women\n\nGimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues\n\nI laid a divorcée in New York City\n\nI had to put up some kind of a fight\n\nThe lady then she covered me with roses\n\nShe blew my nose and then she blew my mind\n\nThe Stones recorded two radically different versions of Honky Tonk Women. The first is what is termed the “Country Honk” version of the song. This was never released as a single, but appears on the Stones’ 1969 album Let It Bleed (the album title is a sardonic riff on the Beatles’ Let It Be).\n\nThe lyrics of Country Honk differ slightly from those on the single release of Honky Tonk Women. In particular, the first line begins “I’m sittin’ in a bar, tipplin’ a jar in Jackson.”\n\nSo here is the audio of the Rolling Stones’ ‘Country Honk.’\n\nAccording to Keith Richards, “On Let It Bleed, we put that other version of Honky Tonk Women on because that’s how the song was originally written, as a real Hank Williams/Jimmie Rodgers, ’30s Country song.”\n\nThis song is certainly presented in a down-home country style. It features acoustic guitar from Keith Richards and an electric violin solo by Byron Berline, who had previously been a member of Gram Parsons’ band Flying Burrito Brothers.\n\nMick Taylor chimes in here on slide guitar. And Charlie Watt’s drumming here is so subtle that it is hard to tell that he is part of the ensemble.\n\nI really enjoy the ‘Country Honk’ version of this tune, which represents a somewhat significant departure from the Stones’ normal style.\n\nThere is some controversy over where the song was recorded. Some people claim that the song was recorded at Elektra Studios in L.A. in March 1969. Others assert that the song was actually recorded in London’s Olympia Studios, right after the Stones recorded the version of Honky Tonk Women that was released as a single. In this narrative, Byron Berline’s violin contribution was later added at Elektra Studios.\n\nAnd now here is the better-known version of Honky Tonk Women. Here are the Stones performing this song on Top of the Pops in 1970.\n\nThis is the iconic version of Honky Tonk Women that everyone remembers. This version is dominated by a guitar line introduced by Mick Taylor, who subsequently replaced Brian Jones on the Stones.\n\nThe song features Charlie Watts on cowbell, a rarity for a Stones song (in the studio, the cowbell was played by Stones producer Jimmy Miller). Here, Watts’ drumming gives the song the funky quality that the Stones were looking for.\n\nThe single record of Honky Tonk Women was released a few months before the album Let It Bleed came out. The “B” side of the single was You Can’t Always Get What You Want. In my opinion, those two sides constitute one of the best single rock-music releases of all time.\n\nSadly, the single was released just one day after Brian Jones’ death. The record rapidly rose to #1 on the charts in both the U.S. and the U.K. Honky Tonk Women was rated the #116 song on the Rolling Stone magazine 2010 list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nHonky Tonk Women has proved to be one of the Stones’ most durable hits. It is a favorite in Stones live concerts, and appears in a number of live concert DVDs and Rolling Stones boxed sets.\n\nAnd now back to Charlie Watts. He was married to Shirley Ann Shepherd in 1964, and he and his wife had one daughter. The family lived on a 700-acre estate in southwestern England, where they raised Arabian horses. In the mid-80s, Watts became addicted to heroin and meth, although he managed to kick his habit.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 – but, given his aversion to the rock ‘n roll limelight, Charlie Watts did not attend the induction ceremony.\n\nWhen the Stones were not touring, Charlie Watts devoted his time to his great love, jazz. He assembled jazz bands of various sizes, from the Charlie Watts quintet to the Charlie Watts orchestra. His fantasy was to appear “in the Blue Note or Birdland with Charlie Parker in front of me.”\n\nThe passing of Charlie Watts brings to an end an incredibly successful and durable run of the Rolling Stones. Presumably the Stones will replace Watts with other drummers, but we salute this great, albeit reluctant, rock music star Charlie Watts.\n\nIke & Tina Turner and Honky Tonk Women:\n\nIke and Tina Turner formed one of the great R&B bands of the 60s and 70s. Ike Turner was a true rock music pioneer. Many people consider the 1951 record “Rocket 88” to be the first rock and roll song ever. Although the song is credited to “Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats,” it is actually performed by then 19-year-old Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm – Brenston was a saxophonist and singer with Ike Turner’s group, and he received the songwriting credits.\n\nIke Turner subsequently moved to St. Louis, where he and his Kings of Rhythm became one of the most famous bands in the area. Apparently they would play clubs in St. Louis until they closed, and then move to East St. Louis and continue to play until dawn.\n\nIn 1958 a nurse’s aide, Anna Mae Bullock, began dating one of Ike Turner’s bandmembers. After hanging out with the group for some time, Anna asked if she could sing with the band. When she was given the opportunity, Ike was impressed with both her singing ability and her flamboyant personality.\n\nA big break occurred when Ike and his Kings of Rhythm were set to record the song A Fool in Love. When the lead singer didn’t show up, the band recorded it with Anna on lead vocals. The song turned out to be a surprise hit, reaching #2 on the R&B charts and 27 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\nHere is a photo of Ike and Tina Turner from the late 1960s.\n\nAt this point, Ike Turner had an epiphany. He gave Anna the stage name Tina Turner, and re-named his band The Ike and Tina Turner Revue. Perhaps even more importantly, Ike deliberately moved into the background, and made Tina’s singing and dancing the centerpiece of their shows.\n\nTina was an electrifying performer. With her teeny-tiny miniskirts, the exuberant energy of her dancing, and her rough and powerful vocals, she would rip a song right up. When this was combined with Ike Turner’s tight, disciplined backing band and the vocals and dancing from backup singers the Ikettes, it was a dynamite combination.\n\nThe Ike and Tina Revue gained substantial fame. For quite some time they did not have a major hit; however, they were well known as one of the highest-octane live acts. On a couple of tours they opened for the Rolling Stones, which gave them even more exposure.\n\nThings finally clicked for Ike and Tina in 1970. They released two albums that were both certified as gold records, their cover of CCR’s Proud Mary made it to #2 on the pop charts, and they won a Grammy with that record in the category Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\nHere are Ike & Tina Turner in a live cover of Honky Tonk Women. This performance took place in 1970, not long after the group released its first big hit.\n\nIsn’t this enjoyable? This song appeared on their 1969 album Nice ‘n Rough. Tina belts out the lyrics (modified to reverse the gender of the participants), accompanied by the Ikettes, all of them appearing in miniskirts.\n\nAs usual, Ike is playing guitar in the background and leading the band, which features an impressive horn section. This would be a great tune for dancing.\n\nIt’s impossible for me to watch Ike & Tina without conjuring up disturbing images of Ike Turner’s penchant for domestic violence. Apparently Tina endured several years of truly violent abuse until she finally left Ike in July 1976. Their situation was exacerbated by Ike’s serious drug addiction issues.\n\nTina received a divorce after a prolonged legal battle with Ike, although she relinquished nearly all financial claims in order to obtain a settlement. Both of their careers languished for a time following their divorce. However, in 1984 Tina’s Private Dancer project became one of the best-selling albums of all time. It re-established her solo career and made her one of the top-grossing rock music tours. Good for Tina – after years of violent treatment, she rebounded with a fantastic comeback!\n\nUnfortunately Ike never seemed to come to terms with his violent ways. I never heard him take responsibility for his behavior, right up to his death in 2007 of a cocaine overdose, exacerbated by cardiovascular disease and emphysema. What a shame, as Ike Turner was one of the great early pioneers of rhythm and blues, and he assembled a dynamite band.\n\nIke and Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Alas, Ike was in prison for drug offenses at the time, and Tina did not attend the induction. But we wish all the best to Tina, a brave survivor of domestic abuse.\n\nJoe Cocker and Honky Tonk Women:\n\nJoe Cocker was a British blues musician. He was one of my favorite artists, despite the fact that he had relatively few original songs. Most of his best-known songs were covers of other tunes. However, he was a terrific bluesman whose best covers brought an entirely new take on a classic song.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Cocker was attracted to music by following the career of British skiffle musician Lonnie Donegan, the artist who inspired not only the early Beatles, but an entire generation of British pop musicians.\n\nBelow is a photo of Joe Cocker (R) and Leon Russell on their Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour.\n\nCocker then became interested in rock and blues. He had the good sense to pattern his vocal stylings after a soul singer like Ray Charles. You can definitely detect the influence of Ray Charles in Cocker’s vocals.\n\nCocker next worked his way through the British club circuit. Initially, he made little headway until he hooked up with Denny Cordell, the producer for British progressive-rock groups such as Procol Harum and The Moody Blues. With Cordell’s backing, Cocker was able to book larger venues and to work with more talented studio musicians.\n\nAfter a couple of minor hits in the UK, Joe Cocker hit the big time with his appearance at Woodstock. Cocker became an overnight sensation, particularly for his sensational cover of the Beatles’ song With a Little Help From My Friends. His career then took off like a rocket.\n\nHere is Joe Cocker in a live performance of the Rolling Stones tune Honky Tonk Women.\n\nThis took place during Cocker’s 1970 Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour. That tour featured Leon Russell as the leader of Cocker’s band and the arranger for his songs. What a wonderful live performance! Note that the lyrics in Cocker’s version are completely different from the original lyrics of the song.\n\nCocker is in great form here. He and the band, led by Leon on guitar, blast through this song. The very large ensemble on this tour includes a terrific chorus and an energetic horn section, held together by Joe’s great bluesy vocals. It would have been great fun to see this tour live.\n\nOnce Joe Cocker gained fame, he continued to carve out an incredibly successful career as a blues vocalist. Cocker’s songs generally featured creative arrangements, and he worked with several talented producers and studio musicians.\n\nEveryone has a list of deserving musicians who have not yet been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Joe Cocker and Dire Straits were right at the top of my list, until Dire Straits was inducted in 2018. It’s hard for me to see why Joe Cocker was not inducted into the Hall of Fame many years ago.\n\nI see that rockers such as Billy Joel have been campaigning for Cocker to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. My feeling is that by any reasonable standard, he should be a member.\n\nJoe Cocker died from lung cancer in Dec. 2014. He is deeply missed.\n\nSource Material:\n\nWikipedia, Honky Tonk Women\n\nWikipedia, The Rolling Stones\n\nWikipedia, Charlie Watts\n\nGavin Edwards, Charlie Watts, Bedrock Drummer for the Rolling Stones, Dies at 80, New York Times, Aug. 24, 2021\n\nWikipedia, Ike & Tina Turner"
