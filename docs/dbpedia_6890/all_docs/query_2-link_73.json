        "text": "Turner denied claims of abuse by his former wife\n\nUS soul legend Ike Turner, the former husband of Tina Turner, has died at the age of 76.\n\nHe died at his home near San Diego, California. There was no immediate word on the cause of death.\n\nHe rose to fame in the 1960s, and is best remembered for his musical partnership and stormy marriage with Tina Turner, who said he abused her.\n\nIn later years he rehabilitated his image and won his second Grammy in February for Risin' with the Blues.\n\nHe shared his only other Grammy with Tina Turner in 1972 for their cover of Proud Mary.\n\n\"Ike Turner passed away this morning. He was at his home,\" said Scott Hanover, an official at the performer's management company.\n\n'Demonised'\n\nMichele Schweitzer, a spokeswoman for his former wife, said: \"Tina is aware that Ike passed away earlier today.\n\nTo critics he will be known as a great founder, unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man\n\nPaul Gambaccini , broadcaster\n\n\"She has not had any contact with him in 35 years. No further comment will be made.\"\n\nSinger Chuck Berry was getting ready to perform on stage when he heard the news.\n\n\"What can you have but sorrow if you lose one of your colleagues, you know?\" he said.\n\nTurner, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is credited by many music historians with making the first rock 'n' roll record, Rocket 88, in 1951.\n\nBroadcaster Paul Gambaccini told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"In musical terms [he was] very important.\n\n\"Rocket 88 is one of the two records that can claim to be the first rock 'n' roll record, being the other being The Fat Man by Fats Domino from 1949,\" he said.\n\nHe said the track was an \"indisputable claim to fame\" for Turner.\n\n\"To critics he will be known as a great founder, unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man,\" he added.\n\nOBITUARY\n\nTurner was also known as a prolific session guitarist and piano player.\n\nAfter marrying Tina Turner in 1959, the pair produced a string of hits, including A Fool In Love and It's Gonna Work Out Fine.\n\nThe song River Deep Mountain High, produced by Phil Spector, was one of their most successful singles.\n\nBut Turner will be forever remembered for his turbulent relationship with Tina Turner, the BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles says.\n\nIn 2001, Turner denied his ex-wife's claims that he abused her and expressed frustration that he had been demonised in the media.\n\nYour comments:\n\nWhatever his troubles were you can't take away what he contributed to the music world. Bowie and Jagger revived Tina Turner's career but Ike created it. I'm not saying how he treated her in private was right, I'm saying he is a musical genius whose contributions will be missed. I saw him perform at the Long Beach blues festival a few years back and his set blew everyone away. A true talent. R.I.P\n\nJason Urbanczyk, Los Angeles\n\nI'm a huge Tina fan but there is no denying the debt music fans owe him and the enormous contribution he made to fashioning Tina Turner.\n\nDenis O'Connor, London\n\nThis is such a loss to the music scene. He will be sadly missed for his talent. Not so much for what he did to Tina Turner that is unforgivable in a man. We still should not judge him for thing in the passed. He will be missed.\n\nG Russell, Ayr\n\nIke Turner was one of the greatest musicians, arrangers and producers of the modern era. He invented rock n roll and you can not take that away from the man. Yes, he was a bad man but so were many of our musical heroes. Even today people with tarnished reputations top the charts, such as 50 Cent and Eminem. R.I.P. Ike\n\nGordon, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyneside\n\nI know it will sound cruel, even though Tina lives in another country then Ike did. However, now Tina Turner can rest. No more having the fear of him coming into a room. No more looking over her shoulder.\n\nMike, Washington, DC\n\nIke's incredible dedication passion for his music has always inspired me. Seeing him play alongside Rosco Gordon showed two of the great blues players with such varying personalities- Ike's powerful and non compromising style and Rosco's sweeping, gentle manner- two of the greats gone. Now they're gone\n\nTom Blant, Canterbury, uk\n\nWhilst he was portrayed as a wife beater, tyrant and good musician he was still a human being. Death is never good. My heart goes out to Tina who must be feeling the pain and mixed emotions after what happened to her\n\nKevin Ross, Scotland, UK\n\nWhat an incredible musician this world has lost. Being a Turner fan I feel the loss and my heart is filled with grief. Every marriage has got ups and downs and we should not look at whatever happened between him and Tina. He will be missed. R.I.P\n\nDoreen Nawa, Lusaka, Zambia\n\nI saw Ike performing live a few years ago and for the first time. He \"blew me away\". That guy oozed talent that the stars of today may not even grasp.\n\nLance Munslow, Preston, UK\n\nMy deepest sympathy to the family. Ike was a musical genius who was determined to be a success.\n\nKaren, Balto. City\n\nAs a music student, having studied soul music, I have only just come across what Ike Turner contributed to the music world. Although his tumultuous relationship with Tina was an issue during their respective careers, there is no denying that his death will have a serious impact throughout the music industry. His work as a singer, guitarist, pianist and most importantly as a songwriter will be forever captured on record, and in the end, the recognition for his work is the most important thing at this time. R.I.P. Ike\n\nTom Beck, Brighton, UK\n\nIke and Tina may have had a stormy relationship, but they put on a hella good show. He'll be missed.\n\nShell Lavender, Snowflake, Az. U.S.A.\n\nIke Turner was a musician's musician. He understood that music comes from PEOPLE, not just a singular performer. He knew how to craft and combine sounds to create complex yet compelling songs. He could mix class and strut with funk and dirt. And humour. You never miss the water till the well runs dry, and I will miss Ike Turner.\n\nDano delaMano, Minneapolis\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Ike when he played at the Koh Samui Music Festival in 2005. As one of the organisers I had plenty of time to talk with him and found him to be one of the nicest most open and honest people I have met. He admitted all the bad things he had done but said they had been overstated and that there are always two sides to the story - and only one had been told. Nevertheless, during his time here in Koh Samui he was the most accommodating of any of the famous stars we had here, no airs and graces, no silly demands. His most famous phrase during his stay was \"What can I do to make this work?\" A great guy and great musician who will be sadly missed.\n\nHarry Bonning, Koh Samui, Thailand\n\nWe mustn't forget that for all his vices, he is single handedly responsible for introducing the world to Tina Turner. As previous comments on here have suggested, there are always two sides to every story and a jaded past should never overshadow his massive contributions to the music industry. Rest in Peace Ike\n\nRichard, York, UK\n\nI knew Ike Turner in recent years, long after his stormy relationship with Tina and his excessive living had passed. Ike was a great musical talent and in his earlier years a talent scout, producer and arranger for Chess Records. At a low point, he signed a contract allowing someone to make a film about his relationship with Tina without the right to reply or refute what was said. It made a great film. Sadly that is how people will remember him.\n\nFran Leslie, London UK\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that Ghanaians of what I would call 'menopausal age'will always remember the wonderful performance Ike and Tina Turner put up in Ghana in the late 1960s. It is a pity that the two had a such a stormy relationship and ended up going their separate ways. May Ike rest in perfect peace.\n\nTete Cobblah, Luanda, Angola"
