        "text": "Registered\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2005\n\nLocation: Seattle\n\nPosts: 5,787\n\ngoodbye, Ike Turner\n\nSince I don't see it yet...Ik'es gone to beat up Jesus...\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/12/obit.ike.turner.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest\n\nSAN DIEGO, California (AP) -- Ike Turner, whose role as one of rock's critical architects was overshadowed by his ogrelike image as the man who brutally abused former wife Tina Turner, died Wednesday at his home in suburban San Diego. He was 76.\n\nIke Turner won a Grammy for best traditional blues album for 'Risin' With The Blues' on February 11.\n\n1 of 2 more photos » \"He did pass away this morning\" at his home in San Marcos, said Scott M. Hanover of Thrill Entertainment Group, which managed Turner's musical career.\n\nThere was no immediate word on the cause of death, which was first reported by celebrity Web site TMZ.com.\n\nTurner managed to rehabilitate his image somewhat in later years, touring around the globe with his band the Kings of Rhythm and drawing critical acclaim for his work. Watch a report about Turner's death »\n\nHe won a Grammy in 2007 in the traditional blues album category for \"Risin' With the Blues.\"\n\nBut his image is forever identified as the drug-addicted, wife-abusing husband of Tina Turner. He was hauntingly portrayed by Laurence Fishburne in the movie \"What's Love Got To Do With It,\" based on Tina Turner's autobiography.\n\nIn a 2001 interview with The Associated Press, Turner denied his ex-wife's claims of abuse and expressed frustration that he had been demonized in the media while his historic role in rock's beginnings had been ignored.\n\n\"You can go ask Snoop Dogg or Eminem, you can ask the Rolling Stones or (Eric) Clapton, or you can ask anybody -- anybody, they all know my contribution to music, but it hasn't been in print about what I've done or what I've contributed until now,\" he said.\n\nTurner, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is credited by many rock historians with making the first rock 'n' roll record, \"Rocket 88,\" in 1951. Produced by the legendary Sam Phillips, it was groundbreaking for its use of distorted electric guitar. See photos of the rock pioneer »\n\nBut as would be the case for most of his career, Turner, a prolific session guitarist and piano player, was not the star on the record -- it was recorded with Turner's band but credited to singer Jackie Brenston.\n\nAnd it would be another singer -- a young woman named Anna Mae Bullock -- who would bring Turner his greatest fame, and infamy.\n\nTurner met the 18-year-old Bullock, whom he would later marry, in 1959 and quickly made the husky-voiced woman the lead singer of his group, refashioning her into the sexy Tina Turner. Her stage persona was highlighted by short skirts and stiletto heels that made her legs her most visible asset. But despite the glamorous image, she still sang with the grit and fervor of a rock singer with a twist of soul.\n\nThe pair would have two sons. They also produced a string of hits. The first, \"A Fool In Love,\" was a top R&B song in 1959, and others followed, including \"I Idolize You\" and \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine.\"\n\nBut over the years they're genre-defying sound would make them favorites on the rock 'n' roll scene, as they opened for acts like the Rolling Stones.\n\nThe densely layered hit \"River Deep, Mountain High\" was one of producer Phil Spector's proudest creations. A rousing version of \"Proud Mary,\" a cover of the Creedence Clearwater Revival hit, became their signature song and won them a Grammy for best R&B vocal performance by a group.\n\nStill, their hits were often sporadic, and while their public life depicted a powerful, dynamic duo, Tina Turner would later charge that her husband was an overbearing wife abuser and cocaine addict.\n\nIn her 1987 autobiography, \"I, Tina,\" she narrated a harrowing tale of abuse, including suffering a broken nose. She said that cycle ended after a vicious fight between the pair in the back seat of a car in Las Vegas, where they were scheduled to perform.\n\nIt was the only time she ever fought back against her husband, Turner said.\n\nAfter the two broke up, both fell into obscurity and endured money woes for years before Tina Turner made a dramatic comeback in 1982 with the release of the album \"Private Dancer,\" a multiplatinum success with hits such as \"Let's Stay Together\" and \"What's Love Got To Do With It.\"\n\nThe movie based on her life, \"What's Love Got To Do With It,\" was also a hit, earning Angela Bassett an Oscar nomination.\n\nBut Fishburne's glowering depiction of Ike Turner also furthered Turner's reputation as a rock villain.\n\nMeanwhile, Turner never again had the success he enjoyed with his former wife.\n\nAfter years of drug abuse, he was jailed in 1989 and served 17 months.\n\nTurner told the AP he originally began using drugs to stay awake and handle the rigors of nonstop touring during his glory years.\n\n\"My experience, man, with drugs -- I can't say that I'm proud that I did drugs, but I'm glad I'm still alive to convey how I came through,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm a good example that you can go to the bottom. ... I used to pray, `God, if you let me get three days clean, I will never look back.' But I never did get to three days. You know why? Because I would lie to myself. And then only when I went to jail, man, did I get those three days. And man, I haven't looked back since then.\"\n\nBut while he would readily admit to drug abuse, Turner always denied abusing his ex-wife.\n\nAfter years out of the spotlight his career finally began to revive in 2001 when he released the album \"Here and Now.\" The recording won rave reviews and a Grammy nomination and finally helped shift some of the public's attention away from his troubled past and onto his musical legacy.\n\n\"His last chapter in life shouldn't be drug abuse and the problems he had with Tina,\" said Rob Johnson, the producer of \"Here and Now.\"\n\nTurner spent his later years making more music and touring, even while he battled emphysema.\n\nAccolades for both his early and later work continued to come in as he grew older, and the once-broke Turner managed to garner a comfortable income as his songs were sampled by a variety of rap acts.\n\nIn interviews toward the end of his life, Turner would acknowledge having made many mistakes, but maintained he was still able to carry himself with pride.\n\n\"I know what I am in my heart. And I know regardless of what I've done, good and bad, it took it all to make me what I am today,\" he once told the AP.\n\n__________________\n\n'85 911.
