        "text": "At any rate, when Anne Mae Bullock met Ike Turner in St. Louis around 1958, he had already paid his dues as a musician. Like many greats, he was completely immersed in music 24/7. As early as 1951 he was responsible for a rhythm and blues record called Rocket 88, credited to Jackie Brentson & His Delta Cats, and recorded for Sam Phillips on Sun/Chess. Some say it's the first rock and roll record. It might be. It is definitely unique for its time. Brentson, on the strength of the hit which had been Ike's work, left and took the band with him.\n\nDuring this period Ike worked for numerous labels with numerous singers and bands, trying to get somewhere. He also performed solid session work on classics by some of the greats of 1950's blues - like Howlin' Wolf and BB King. He had settled in St. Louis and put his years of experience as a live act to work in the club circuit, gaining a reputation for one of the most exciting shows in town.\n\nThe rest of the story is history. Anne Mae Bullock walks in, sings, tears the house down and ends up working with Ike in a professional relationship. He takes their friendship to another level, eventually marrying her and changing her name. He wanted this ball and chain because she was a meal ticket. Success in his own right had eluded Ike, despite his obvious talents and contributions as a musician. The fresh, exciting sound of his new discovery was the way to get where he wanted to go. Nevertheless, a chance demo recording which later became a breakthrough single for the duo, really tipped him off. For the next decade and a half they worked consistently, developing one of the most raw, edgy and powerful soul shows on the scene. Hit records seemed to remain out of reach (I have some ideas on why that might be...) but their reputation as a live act afforded them some great success. Touring with The Rolling Stones, the Ike & Tina Turner Revue exposed itself to a new audience which broadened their appeal and, in effect, their repertoire. They were no longer simply about the blues, and soul... they were a well-rounded, tight unit that could perform duties to soul and funk classics of the day as well as choice selections from the rock scene.\n\nBy the mid-late 1970's, the drug abuse Ike had succumbed to detrimentally affected his music, his marriage, everything. Ike had carried on a one man sexual revolution for years, disrespected his wife, and been abuse to her and many of his other women. He would be high on coke for days on end, holed up in his studio, trying to create his music, totally unapproachable, and prone to drug crazed rampages of violence and sex. After many years trying to do the best she could with what she had, Tina split and later enjoyed great solo success.\n\nNow, however, I would like to discuss the music. The unique and exciting sound of some of those records. The nerve shattering, visceral thrill of the live recordings. I will be examining their career with specific attention to just over 60 tracks I consider to be key in the development of the Revue's artistic statement through the body of their recorded work.\n\nAnother track from The Soul of Ike & Tina Turner - The Way You Love Me - was chosen as the b-side. I love playing it. A Fool In Love knocks me way out, and then The Way You Love Me's gentle sway as Tina belts that she 'just wants your lovin' sometimes' revives me. It's fantastic. I Idolize You throbs with a bloated sort of rhythm - one can imagine Tina, pregnant and about to drop, swinging along to this torchy soul ballad, supposedly written by Ike & Tina together. As the liner notes to Proud Mary: The Best of Ike & Tina Turner point out - \"With its loping shuffle and call-and-response vocals (\"yes, she idolize you\", chirped the Ikettes), it closely resembled Ray Charles' Unchain My Heart, which would be released a year later\" - you know you're doing pretty good stuff if you're influencing Ray Charles.\n\nYou Should'a Treated Me Right, featured on both The Soul of Ike & Tina and Dynamite! is an almost jump blues inspired romp written by Ike. Even at this early stage, there is a sense of irony to a lot of Ike's original compositions. Songs about women being mistreated, demanding better, etc. This would become a stalwart ideology of the Turner's work, often buried beneath the surface, other times more overt - as in Poor Fool - a screaming romp and minor hit (R&B #4). It's Gonna Work Out Fine, a successful single from 1961, served as key track on the last Sue LP released by Ike & Tina in 1964. As legend has it, it is not Ike we hear on this record but Mickey of Mickey & Sylvia fame. It didn't matter, the interplay between the two on this record is sensational. The song hit POP #14 and R&B #2 - their highest charting single at that time, and would remain so until Proud Mary hit in 1971. All of the Sue records have been given a fantastic digital treatment as two-for-one's by Stateside records. I recommend them highly. What makes them special is their inclusion of a few single only Sue sides - of which Good Good Lovin' is a fantastic example of the groups developing sound. They really perfected the Ikettes sound here, with fantastic backing vocals throughout Tina's gritty lead, and call and response work that was just on point - highlighting the links of soul music to gospel.\n\nIn total four LP's were released on the Sue label, along with a string of singles ranging from a drop in the ocean to moderately successful. Of them, Desire recorded for the Don't Play Me Cheap album of 1963 is one I'm particularly fond of for its swirling, chaotic sense of drama. It sounds more like something Dinah Washington or Della Reese would have been doing at that time. Tina's vocal is a roller-coaster. Don't Play Me Cheap itself continues in a similar fashion - a lush, orchestrated soul sound, perhaps trying to emulate what Etta James was by then doing over at Chess, and along with other gems like an emotive reading of Love Letters and some fun originals like Mama Tell Him and Those Ways makes Don't Play Me Cheap a personal favourite among the Sue records.\n\nIke was very shrewd business man, but he was also not that good with money. It seems to me often got into trouble and he also adopted a rather insane way of getting into studios by sort of hustling very small deals here and there for quick turn-over and little artistic reward. Ike was a solid musician, and at times an infectious, astute writer of songs. But his stubborn and mulish approach to business I think cost the Revue a lot of success. They were creating a stir in television appearances like the TNT Show, Shindig! and later, Soul Train, as well as thrilling audiences all over the world as the 60s wore on.\n\nI Can't Believe What You Say has a frenetic restlessness about it. I cannot help but conjure the image of Tina on black and white 60's TV ponying around to this. Drums, hand claps, backing voices, a rhythm section, a few horns. Perfection. Goodbye So Long, first released in 1965 on an LP for the Kent label called The Soul Of Ike & Tina - not to be confused with the earlier Sue LP The Soul...and Tina TURNER. The album consisted of Kent session recordings, most of them in keeping with the formula developed at Sue records, except with Ike's song writing capabilities beginning to spread themselves pretty thin. Most of his compositions were variations on a theme, and a good one, one which they were able to exploit to great effect in live performance as we shall soon see. Goodbye So Long was also flipped out as a single was performed memorably by Tina on Shindig! the same year. Other highlights from the Kent period include minor single I Wish My Dreams Would Come True and the (until 2000) previously un-issued Shake It Baby. Unearthed in 2000 at on the same Ace release The Kent Years was a studio recording of the duos famous live number All I Could Do Was Cry (aka Stop The Wedding) in which a fairly noble job of capturing the excitement of live performances is witnessed.\n\nMeanwhile Loma released its Ike & Tina singles. A Fool For A Fool (actually a b-side in 1964) and Tell Her I'm Not Home (backed by the sublime I'm Thru With Love, which sadly, has never been remastered to my knowledge) are both admirable attempts and hold up pretty well. Solid, dependable mid-60's soul. Both continue the variation on a theme that pervaded much of their material at this period - relationship dramas as gritty rhythm and blues. In Tell Her I'm Not Home the act is taken as far as including a staged phone-call as an interlude. Finger Poppin' a bouncing, dance-soul throw-down was released on Loma in '65. A live version, however, appeared on the 1964 album recorded in Texas. It's difficult to know which recording came first. All I know is that both sound great. Somebody Needs You, another of the Loma singles, is pure Northern soul, and a really solid effort from all involved. It's remarkable to consider the amount of potential being displayed so far in Ike & Tina's career, and yet HIT singles, true HIT singles, continued to elude them. In fact, in the midst of the British invasion, Ike & Tina were finding it hard to make much of a dent on the charts, let alone strike gold. Listening to this track, just why this was so remains a mystery to me.\n\nThe single of Finger Poppin' included It's All Over, an original composition of Tina's, as its b-side - one of the tracks from those same Texas live albums. It's a wonderful performance. The song has a lumbering pace and a kind of bitter sweet, battle worn sense of completion. Tina laments a relationship that has clearly soured to the point of no return in an emotive classic of heart-break soul. Ike had begun to make Tina craft lyrics to musical compositions he'd done. I suppose the well ran dry; he had exhausted most of his lyrical ideas. Tina's chance to express herself yielded a rather grim reflection of their troubled relationship.\n\nAlready the Turner's had emerged with an exciting new sound, an exhilarating live act, numerous original compositions of worth and had proven themselves worthy interpreters of the work of others, whether putting their own unique stamp on it or performing a faithful, honorary rendition that stacks up against the originator's. Their live work in particular contained many a good cover - Twist & Shout, Shake A Tail Feather, Ooh Poo Pah Doo, A Fool For You, You're No Good and Please, Please, Please, among others. Meanwhile, the Kent live album contained superb live performances of earlier Sue singles. You Should'a Treated Me Right, in particular, gets a shot of attitude as Tina screams down the house.\n\nGreat singers though they are, Darlene Love in particular, Spector wanted Tina. It is well known that Ike had to be paid great sums of money to stay away from the studio and have no part in the proceedings. Tina also told amusing stories in I, Tina about turning up to Spector's home and being greeted by a myna bird, etc. It's also a known fact that when she recorded her vocal, Tina got so hot that she had to remove her blouse and did the final -killer- take in her bra. It's the stuff of legend and the Spector produced, Wall of Sound enhanced (for your pleasure), symphony that is River Deep, Mountain High - my personal all-time favourite recording by anyone - is something of a gift from the Gods. The Gods alone know why this song didn't hit in a big way on every damn street on the planet. The orchestration and arrangement is phenomenal.\n\nThe Rolling Stones caught those gigs and, enthralled by what they heard and saw, asked Ike & Tina to travel the US with them as support. It turned out pretty well, because it exposed Ike & Tina to a new audience which, in turn, broadened their repertoire as well. It was a kind of a floodgate opened and let in a gush of stylistic possibility that hadn't been previously known to the Turner's. Much of the force that drove this transition was Tina herself, insofar as she chose many of the records the duo would come to cover in the ensuing years.\n\nAs for River Deep, Mountain High - the album (half produced by Spector and the other half by Ike) - is sensational. Among Spector's highlights, a heart-rending take on Martha Reeves & The Vandellas' Motown hit A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Every Day), the epic I'll Never Need More Than This with its sweeping strings and bu-bu-bu-burping horns, and a spacious, cymbolic performance of The Drifters' Save The Last Dance For Me. Some of Ike's tracks consisted of up-dates of earlier Sue records - A Fool In Love, I Idolize You, It's Gonna Work Out Fine all got given a update with a new approach to the arrangements and in some ways the originals are improved upon. The entire album is sublime and definitely a contender as my favourite LP of the 1960's.\n\nIn the late 60's Ike & Tina recorded with a few smaller labels, usually dropping a couple of albums down (two for Pompeii - So Fine and Cussin', Cryin' & Carryin' On; two for Blue Thumb - Outta Season and The Hunter) before moving on. The Pompeii recordings are mostly fairly bland, even to the point of corny novelty like the inclusion of what sound like Alvin & the Chipmunks. WTF, mate, WTF. But there are some nice moments such as a noble, if meandering cover of Shake A Tail Feather and the super funky, drum licked Cussin', Cryin' & Carryin' On. This track kind of marks the beginning of Ike's experimentation with a more funky sound, taking inspiration from James Brown, Sly Stone and a then up-and-coming Jimi Hendrix. We Need An Understanding is something of a soul song, it even incorporates church conjuring hand claps, etc, but the line between the rhythm & blues and the rock & roll was starting to get slightly blurred.\n\nNot all the time though; the flip-side - It Sho' Ain't Me - is straight up soul. Years ago I was talking a friend about music. We were a few sheets to the wind and ruminating on certain little things we love about music. I began talking about soul as a philosophical idea, an ideology, an attitude, an experience... one art wank begat another and eventually said friend chimed in \"what is soul music?\". I was aghast. I played him It Sho' Ain't Me. \"Ah...!\" said my friend - he got it. He felt it. It's a wonder this never became one of those famous flip-side success stories. You know, Ben E. King released a single - First Taste of Love - and it did okay. But when a curious DJ flipped the 45 - boom! Spanish Harlem, a masterpiece, was languishing on the other side. We Need An Understand is good enough, but It Sho' Ain't Me is an under-rated soul masterpiece. I can imagine Aretha Franklin tackling it with ease and bringing unique touch to it. Regardless, Tina's no frills vocal is superb.\n\nSome of their best work is their simplest. Bold Soul Sister from The Hunter continued what Cussin', Cryin' & Carryin' On begun: drum licked funk, laden with guitar riffs and figures that sort of watusi up the spine while Tina screams grit into the mic and the Ikettes chanting 'do what you wanna, when you wanna, how you wanna, now, do your thing for sister' behind all that. The energy in the room is palpable. The Hunter, meanwhile, is a stomping blues which displays some great playing, even if the track does drag on a little too long. I Am A Motherless Child - from Outta Season - is another high point in the Turner's career. Boy, is this different? Absolutely stripped down, just Tina accompanied by a guitar and an organ. It's a spiritual song, given a moving, elegant but intricate performance by Tina. In more recent years this song came to revisited in Tina's work with the Beyond project. Crazy 'Bout You Baby also stands tall as one of the best tracks from Outta Season.\n\nThe Minit singles, meanwhile, are best represented by I'm Gonna Do All I Can (To Do Right By My Man), which has the Turner's stepping into a sort of Stax records sound on a sturdy soul number resembles something Gladys Knight & The Pips might have done. I'm quite fond of it, and I think it quite nicely rings out the first decade of Ike & Tina's career quite nicely. What follows is something of a change of pace, a new direction - one that proved quite productive. It was also around this time that Ike & Tina more or less settled with Liberty/United Artists for a decent tenure.\n\nIn I, Tina we get some insight into this new direction:\n\n\"I had never really had time to listen to music before, because I was always working - in the studio, on the road, non-stop. Ike had almost made me hate music, because that's all there was with him: \"let's go buy records', 'let's jam', 'let's write a song'. Always music, music, music, and nothing else. Well, we were in Seattle one day, and he took me into this record shop, and that's where I first heard Come Together. I said 'oh, what's that?'. The guy in the store said it was the Beatles. I truly don't think I had ever heard them before. But I loved that song. I said to Ike 'please, please let me do that song onstage'. I was begging him. Then I heard Honky Tonk Women, and I just had to do that, too. Well, we had always done covers anyway, so Ike said all right. Then there was Proud Mary. In the beginning Ike hated the Creedence Clearwater Revival song, but then he heard the version by the Checkmates and took notice. We started working on it in the back seat of the car, and continued to work on it for quite some time before we started to play it onstage. That was the beginning of me liking rock music. It wasn't like we planned it - 'Now, we're gonna start doing white rock and roll songs'. But those groups were interpreting black music to begin with. They touched on R&B, in a way, but it wasn't obvious. I mean, it wasn't the old thing. It was Honky Tonk Women - Wow! I could relate to that!\"\n\nI've always supposed that Ike wrote Contact High about someone else, maybe even Tina. I would hazard to guess that Tina spent a lot of time around marijuana smoke at home and probably fairly often complained of getting high without ever touching the stuff. But that's just my imagination running away with me...\n\nIt Ain't Right (Lovin' To Be Lovin') is another superb Ike Turner original, while Young & Dumb has always struck me as the kind of record that probably made folks like Janis Joplin and Led Zeppelin take notice.\n\nReleased in between the singles off the Come Together album was I'm Yours (Use Me Any Way You Wanna) - one of the first records cut in Ike's new home studio, Bolic Sound. The song is fairly decent, but the band is all over the place. It's a messy sounding record, though not without its charm, that sadly failed to chart.\n\nAlso released in 1970 was Her Man...His Woman - one of the Turner's most mediocre albums, with next to nothing of note. However, the actual follow up to Come Together was somewhat in keeping with the model set forth by that album - a few sensational cover versions mixed in with some of the best originals Ike ever came up with. Workin' Together would become the Turner's most successful LP - hitting POP #25 and remaining in the charts for 38 weeks. Among the albums admirable interpretations of others' work are two later period Beatles tracks: Get Back & Let It Be - both released as a single later in 1972, though unsuccessfully. A few earlier Ike & Tina tracks were given updated versions - The Way You Love Me, Ooh Poo Pah Doo (which had been in the duos live repertoire for years), Goodbye So Long and It's All Over, re-titled You Can Have It - while Tina's sister Aillene Bullock contributed Funkier Than a Mosquita's Tweeter which would later be covered by Nina Simone.\n\nThe electrifying arrangement of Proud Mary took the song to a new level of stylistic and dramatic interpretation, making it the Turner's own. The would forever more be strongly associated with Tina Turner, and her unforgettable delivery of the song over the decades. Proud Mary had seen something of an evolution. A thrilling live version recorded on a 1969 tour supporting The Rolling Stones was featured on deluxe editions of The Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya Ya's Out (a live album, released in 1970) show the beginning of the metamorphosis of the song. Performed as a straight soul version of the CCR swamp rock original, the song had arrangement had changed little by the time of Ike & Tina's famous performance of the song on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1970. However, by the end of the year, the version featured on Workin' Together had been completed, radically altering the song and adding in the spoken introduction that would make Tina an icon.\n\nThe 1970-1971 albums by Ike & Tina remain a high point in their career. Never had their sound been more fully realized and with it came the unexpected incorporation of a more white, rock driven sound. The entire history of popular music has been pervaded by the influence - back and forth - of black musicians on white musicians and, in turn, white musicians back onto black musicians. It's a fascinating thing, and easily observable in Ike & Tina's work during the first two years of the 70's. Ironically, two of their finest studio albums would be followed by two of their worst. Late 1971's 'Nuff Said focused almost exclusively on original tracks - this time around with a range of song-writing credits: Ike, Tina, Tina's sister, and ex-Motown singer/songwriter Leon Ware, among others.\n\nThe results are of somewhat mixed quality with Sweet Flustrations - an organ filled soul number, once more in the vein of the great Stax Records sound - really the only standout track. Where 1972's Let Me Touch Your Mind more evenly balanced originals with covers. Let Me Touch Your Mind, probably the best track on the album, is included for the sake of curiosity, however both of these albums -following hot on the heels of the Turner's musical peak, certainly album-wise- show Ike & Tina going through the motions really. By this time, their personal relationship was a complete mess, and as Ike's drug addictions and poor habits pushed him deeper into a kind of literal music mania, making these records was becoming an increasingly nightmarish demand in Tina's live. She was clearly no longer singing with the conviction she had previously. She was beginning to sound just about as tired as a person could - both with her life and the music she was making.\n\n1973's Nutbush City Limits seems to me as the last gasp of Ike & Tina Turner. Aside from containing the Turner's last hit single, the Tina penned autobiographical title track, it contained more Ike & Tina originals, largely fairly average offerings. The James Brown-ish Make Me Over (aka Tina's Wish), , a gorgeous cover of Dobie Gray's Drift Away, and of course Nutbush City Limits are the real standout tracks here.\n\nNutbush City Limits, in reality, is probably the best production of Ike Turner's career. Layer upon layer of funky, and some of them very weird, sounds create a rhythmic, stomping dance track to end all others. Ike put in numerous guitar licks, bass, drums, horns, various percussive instruments, as well as organs, etc. It's a unique sound, and the complicated patterns that Ike layers up come together in moments of sublime, electrifying union. The 'extended disco version', which adds nearly 3 minutes to the released single/album version, really highlights the layering and funky licks, letting them gradually build into the rip-roaring classic the song would become. It reached POP #22 in the US but enjoyed much greater success in Britain and Europe where it made the Top 10. Only a handful of albums would be released following Nutbush City Limits - The Gospel According to Ike & Tina (1973), Sweet Rhode Island Red (1974) and, after the Turner's break-up, Airwaves (1978). None of these albums contained much of quality and yielded only a couple more singles - Sexy Ida (Parts 1 & 2) and Sweet Rhode Island Red, however both failed to really make an impact.\n\nBaby, Get It On became the last single that Ike & Tina Turner would release, the best version of which appeared on Tina's 1975 solo album Acid Queen. Playing off her screen success in the film of Tommy, an album was put together with Ike producing half and a new team of producers working on the other. More of a solo show-case, the album also featured a solid Ike Turner composition, Bootsey Whitelaw which, along with Baby, Get It On, was his best contribution to the album. Other stand-out tracks on the album include Acid Queen and a funky porn-groove reading of Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love (actually better than the original version, much as I love LZ).\n\nHowever, right now I'd like to take a minute to sum up. Ike & Tina Turner spent most of their careers trying for hit singles and albums, and rarely did they come close. Ike, it has been said before, was hopeless at moving with the times - but I consider that to be an unfair assessment. Ike Turner, for all that can be said about him, was a stellar musician. In particular his piano and guitar playing display a phenomenal amount of skill. His greatest failure came more from his management of the act, his negotiating of deals, his constant determination to hold onto control. There are plenty of wonderful cuts in their discography, and in many cases their failure to chart or make a sizable impact on the music scene is mind boggling. At their best, they were as good as any of the major soul or rock and roll acts of their time.\n\nI remain convinced, though, that the acts weakness was often in their song-writing. While Ike Turner himself produced a couple of dozen great songs in his career, his imagination and creativity ran dry and lord knows Tina isn't much of a song-writer. Some of their finest recordings are interpretations of others' songs. All the jumping around different labels throughout the 60's meant, to Ike, that he could maintain control over his work, without being confined or dictated to by contractual obligations. An admirable philosophy, but by the same token, it really hindered their ability to get hits. I can imagine Ike & Tina recording for any one of the major 60's labels - Chess, Atlantic, Motown, Stax - and yet, Ike & Tina never worked with these labels. Had they, they'd have been exposed to existing stables of song-writing and production talent, as well as a number of gifted musicians. Long term contracts of that kind often give the artist access to a wide variety of talent to help them create, and you find that in many ways these labels' artists dominated the black music scene. Ike insisted on limping on with weird deals. Things like 1 live album, 2 single releases. Many superb Ike & Tina sides remain relatively lost, or certainly uncollected. Many of them have never been remastered or re-released with any fidelity, and those that are often seem to be scattered around a myriad of compliation releases. Time Life's The Ike & Tina Turner Story 1960-1975 comes the closest to a definitive Ike & Tina collection.\n\nTina's solo work permeated by entire youth, and as I got older and began to experience the roots of her music, with Ike Turner, and poured over the recordings gathered together here, my love for her music grew and grew. Many Tina Turner fans under-value the Ike & Tina recordings, glossing over the achievements ON the records by dismissing them as 'unsuccessful'. Well, I've never been one to follow trends or go with popular tastes. For my money, Ike & Tina Turner's music is the stuff of legend.\n\nCompiled here are my personal picks for the key recordings of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, together for the first time an audio retrospective to accompany this blog. I sincerely hope your feet find as much soul, funk and rock and roll as I do here. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going shopping...finger, finger poppin' on you.\n\nTina Turner's classic 1984 'come-back' triumph, Private Dancer, has rightly (if late) been given the treatment it deserves in a crisp 2015 digital remaster. This touchstone in Turner's career has never sounded better, not just for the fact that every nuance of every mix is brought to an even greater aural height by the mastering, or the fact that the album is brimming with good material. Literally every song has merit all of its own. And in a different way so do each and every track on the bonus disc of reasonably rare (only we hard core Tina collectors have them) b-sides and extended 12\" mixes, along with live a's and b's (including the thrilling live duet with David Bowie), the two songs from Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (I have a grumble to make on that note) and the duet with Bryan Adams.\n\nBeyond all that there's the I'm sure cherished and unique place that the album holds for all of us. For me it was my childhood. I became a fan of Tina Turner at the age of 3, so my family say. That's perhaps unusual. At school it certainly was. Everyone else my age was listening to The Lion King soundtrack, or The Little Mermaid. You know, Disney shit. There was me! Ya, better be good to me! Pow! None of that kiddie shit for me, good sir. Give me the hard stuff. But the soulful, I suppose, feminine stuff. No wonder my mother and grandmother knew I was gay. Though I'd like to clarify, while I did put on a rather old fashioned red dress, a terrible Jewish granny style wig all messed up and spikey, and a pair of brown (ugh!) heels and parade about to Tina's music, I think it's just worth mentioning that there wasn't an awful lot in the dress up box EXCEPT that. So the minute someone said, 'play dress ups' I went to the 'dress up box' and, finding only dresses, set out to emulate Tina whom, by then, I was infatuated with.\n\nThat's really what it was. Infatuation. As I grew older, and began to experience more and more of her music (though I must admit, years and years passed where all I had was the Simply The Best compilation of 1990 on cassette (in fact, I wore a few out) and the Wildest Dreams stuff, which was coming out when I was sort of old enough to be actively following appearances on Oprah and, later, Vh1's Diva's Live 1999 - both electrifying experiences for me. Seeing THE REAL TINA performing and just BEING was incredible. I especially loved seeing her with Elton John, who my mother played a lot while I was growing up, and Cher who I was falling in love with in movies like Mermaids and Moonstruck. Then I saw Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It seemed like an eternity before Tina was on screen. As an adult, it seems like mere moments but as a child I could not wait. She said pig shit and I was shocked. But then she leapt from her perch in the wall of Thunderdome and screamed down a maddened crowd, tossing around her authority with the command of an Amazon, her talon point and eyes wild. Bust a deal - face the fucking wheel. Then, of course, there was that 'raggedy man' line, which has been on my lips ever since - just waiting to be served.\n\nIn a round-about way, almost all of my subsequent music taste could trace from my early love of Tina Turner. I listen to everything from jazz, to big band, blues, country, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, soul, rock, funk, disco, pop, etc. In Tina's career alone, there are nods, interpretations, inspirations, roots, membranes… to each and every one of those genres. Truly, there are. She was the beginning of it all for me, and it has been a life-long love for me. Bob Dylan once described himself as a 'musical expeditionary'. I couldn't have said it better myself.\n\nThe songs on Private Dancer have been with me a long time on this expedition. Many of the songs had been for years anyway, on the aforementioned Simply The Best compilation. By the time I managed to mow enough lawns to buy this album, it was probably 1999ish and I was 12. It was the standard 10 song version. In and of itself it was a revelation. I had never before heard Let's Stay Together, Private Dancer or Better Be Good To Me in their full versions. I had never heard other songs at all. And I really reveled in it.\n\nIt is a truly fantastic album. And as I watched those 'classic albums' shows on TV (there were some good ones… Rumours, particularly), I couldn't help but feel there should be one about this album. what a string of singles. Shit -\n\nLet's Stay Together/I Wrote A Letter\n\nHelp/Rock 'n' Roll Widow\n\nWhat's Love Got To Do With It/Don't Rush The Good Things\n\nBetter Be Good To Me/When I Was Young\n\nPrivate Dancer/Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\n\nI Can't Stand The Rain/Let's Pretend We're Married\n\nShow Some Respect/Let's Pretend We're Married\n\nIt's unbelievable really, all that in the space of a year or so. This edition also features the live duet with David Bowie, which is well worth watching on youtube. It's great. My mother thinks he's so sexy in that clip. I must agree. There's also two hilarious moments - Bowie telling Tina is 'cock is still sore' from the night before and her cackling (at least that's the story *I* heard - Bowie or Tina, please confirm or deny), and then a black girl somehow gets on stage and clings to Bowie, nearly breaking up the performance, until being swept away by security.\n\nBall of Confusion is an old Temptations song on the Motown label. Tina's version is produced by these British producers she worked with (B.E.F.). It was sent on to Capitol who were not sure whether they wanted to sign her. Tina and her management were getting rather annoyed. They did Ball of Confusion and a couple of other tracks - later released as b-sides to stuff on the follow up album, Break Every Rule - Take Me To The River and Havin' A Party. On the basis of these (and actually, they're really great versions of older classics...quite unique sound to each and a nice update, stylistically) Capitol still weren't sure.\n\nBut they were sure about David Bowie. He had an album coming out around that time and had just done a listening session with the folks at Capitol. I believe it was the Let's Dance album. The executives at Capitol decided they wanted to take him out for a drink to celebrate. \"Oh I can't\", he says. \"I have a prior engagement.\" The execs are a bit stunned. The gall, they think. \"Oh?\". Bowie says \"yeah, I'm seeing one of my all-time favourite singers tonight. She's doing a show\". They enquire as to who it is. \"Tina Turner? Oh...really...we might just come along\". Off to the Ritz club with Bowie they sit down. Then they take stock - Bowie wasn't alone, in fact numerous celebrities, particularly rock musicians, turned out in support… suddenly the Capitol guys think \"ah, well if this is the caliber of her fans, she must be worth something!\". She got the contract. Then set about finding material for the album.\n\nPrivate Dancer has been referred to as a concept album, which is terrifyingly funny. Because anyone thinking to call it that is hilariously misguided. It was more an album cobbled together from bits and pieces. The sessions in Britain to yield test records resulted in the same producers creating the version of Let's Stay Together. It's the same concept as the prior B.E.F. sessions - update an older soul classic to be a slick, modern dance hit. And hit it did. Her prior solo albums had all failed, but on the strength of Let's Stay Together (the biggest selling 12\" record in American history at that time), this album finally established her as a force to be reckoned with. And a stunning vocalist. Listen to Let's Stay Together. That vocal is incredible. It's so bizarrely constructed and yet she navigates its spiking sinews with sooo much ease. Apparently she did this in a single, perfect, start to finish take.\n\nAs it says in I, Tina:\n\n\"Let's Stay Together was Tina's most nuanced and incandescent performance to date - a reading of the song as masterful, in its particular way, as Al Green's 1971 original. Cushioned on a bed of lushly synthesized strings, Tina threw a lock on the lyric in the opening line - 'Let me say that sii-ii-iince...babeh...since we've been together' - and claimed it, beyond dispute, as her own. Her delivery, never before so intuitively detailed, swooped and fluttered around the melody, darting up to nail a note, then winging away, feinting on a phrase, free falling amid the gentle percussion, soaring heavenward again in an arc across the upper registers. Unique and instantly mesmerizing, Tina's rendition of Let's Stay Together stands as one of the most exhilarating love songs of the eighties.\"\n\nThe rest of the songs really do come from anywhere and everywhere.\n\nLet's Pretend We're Married is a Prince song, covered live and released as b-sides to more than one single off the Private Dancer album. Tina's treatment of the song is as something of a juke joint romper, replete with a spirit that comes out punching pure rock and roll.\n\nIt's a sensuously edgy building of tension, a needing, demanding. The belting out of her demands and expectations amid layers and layers of superb guitar licks, rolling flurries of percussive pelting. The perfect break-up song. I Might Have Been Queen, written by Rupert Hine, Jamie West-Oram and Jeanette Obstoj after listening to Tina yarn about her life and past, her Buddhist faith and beliefs around other lives and reincarnation. There is a sense of triumph in this one, a throbbing sense of urgency - looking to the past, but moving very much in a forward direction both musically and philosophically, introspectively.\n\nTerry Britten - a friend of Tina's manager - generated What's Love, obviously the anthem of a lifetime, and a valuable iconic soundtrack for Tina, and Show Some Respect which sort of harks back to the Ike & Tina days with a kind of Nutbush-funk. Ann Peebles' I Can't Stand The Rain, The Beatles' Help and Bowie's 1984 are all given a lush electronic treatments, The Animals' When I Was Young. Private Dancer was brought in by Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits who had written it but knew it inappropriate for a man. I'm really not sure where Steel Claw comes from. But it has a vaguely Bruce Springsteen feel. Same with I Wrote A Letter and Don't Rush The Good Things - both \"chugging rock with electronic hints\" as the new liner notes say. Keep Your Hands Off My Baby has a kind of Pat Benatar vibe to me. Something in the Hit Me With Your Best Shot vein.\n\nOne of the Living, sadly, is a single edit of the same old mix. I love it. It's fantastic. Don't get me wrong. But I have a bone to pick with the management: the mix that is in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, where is that? Why is that not released? It needs to be. It really needs to be. I've longed to hear it at full length for most of my life and I'm getting very sick of waiting. It's a personal campaign for me. It's grand to be able to kick of what I hope to be an on going blog dedicated to my experiences and listenings as a musical expeditionary with a campaign. I will be writing to Tina's management about this, you can bet your bottom dollar and I will update you on the outcome.\n\nOverall, though, this is a spectacular repackaging and re-appreciation of one of Tina Turner's seminal works. Private Dancer is to Tina Turner what Bad Girls is to Donna Summer, what Bella Donna is to Stevie Nicks, what Diana is to Diana Ross, what Who's Zoomin' Who is to Aretha Franklin, what Like A Prayer is to Madonna. It's a definitive artistic statement, a wholly feminine viewpoint expressed through well crafted melodic rock and pop with progressive electronic instrumentation but an inherent sense of musicality, an eye for quality in its selection of interpretations and a thrilling and, at times, emotive use of the instrument of voice. Tina Turner's Private Dancer matters. So, too, does its follow-up - which I sincerely hope is given the same treatment."
