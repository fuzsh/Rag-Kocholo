        "text": "SAN DIEGO – Ike Turner, whose role as one of rock’s critical architects was overshadowed by his ogre-like image as the man who brutally abused former wife Tina Turner, died Wednesday at his home in suburban San Diego. He was 76.\n\nTurner died at his San Marcos home in northern San Diego County, Scott M. Hanover of Thrill Entertainment Group, which managed Turner’s career, told The Associated Press.\n\nThere was no immediate word on the cause of death, which was first reported by celebrity Web site TMZ.com.\n\nTurner managed to rehabilitate his image somewhat in later years, touring around the globe with his band the Kings of Rhythm and drawing critical acclaim for his work. He won a Grammy in 2007 in the traditional blues album category for “Risin’ With the Blues.”\n\nBut his image is forever identified as the drug-addicted, wife-abusing husband of Tina Turner. He was hauntingly portrayed by Laurence Fishburne in the movie “What’s Love Got To Do With It,” based on Tina Turner’s autobiography.\n\nTina Turner declined to comment on her ex-husband’s death.\n\n“Tina is aware that Ike passed away earlier today. She has not had any contact with him in 35 years. No further comment will be made, ” said her spokeswoman, Michele Schweitzer\n\nTurner, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is credited by many rock historians with making the first rock `n’ roll record, “Rocket 88,” in 1951. Produced by the legendary Sam Phillips, it was groundbreaking for its use of distorted electric guitar.\n\nBut it would be another singer – a young woman named Anna Mae Bullock – who would bring Turner his greatest fame, and infamy.\n\nTurner met the 18-year-old Bullock, whom he would later marry, in 1959 and quickly made the husky-voiced woman the lead singer of his group, refashioning her into the sexy Tina Turner.\n\nThe pair’s hits were often sporadic, and while their public life depicted a powerful, dynamic duo, Tina Turner would later charge that her husband was an overbearing wife abuser and cocaine addict.\n\nThe movie based on her life, “What’s Love Got To Do With It,” was a hit, earning Angela Bassett an Oscar nomination.\n\nBut Fishburne’s glowering depiction of Ike Turner also furthered the musician’s reputation as a rock villain. Meanwhile, Turner never again had the success he enjoyed with his former wife.\n\nAfter years out of the spotlight his career finally began to revive in 2001 when he released the album “Here and Now.” The recording won rave reviews and a Grammy nomination and finally helped shift some of the public’s attention away from his troubled past and onto his musical legacy.\n\nTurner, who was married 13 times, spent his later years making more music and touring, even while he battled emphysema.\n\nRobbie Montgomery, one of the “Ikettes,” backup singers who worked with Turner and his wife, said Turner had been hospitalized recently, but she didn’t know what for.\n\n“It’s devastating, it really is,” she said. “I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and he’d just got home from the hospital. He said he was feeling better and he was at home.”\n\n“He gave me my start,” Montgomery said. “He gave a million people their start.”"
