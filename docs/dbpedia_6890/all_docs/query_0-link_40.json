        "text": "“Proud Mary” tells the tale of a nonconformist taking control of their life by ditching the shackles of working-class reality for the freedom of a rolling riverboat. But when the Ike and Tina Turner Revue set the U.S.A. ablaze by recasting Creedence Clearwater Revival’s mid-tempo strut as a rollicking boogie, Tina was trapped inside a life she didn’t control at all.\n\nProud Mary\n\nThe details of Ike and Tina’s abusive partnership have been exhaustively documented in books, feature films and even on Broadway — the kind of mainstream media attention her struggles likely never would have received were it not for the crossover success of “Proud Mary,” which reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1971. Ironically, it took a Black cover of a song written and performed by white artists — in a white-dominated genre whose very existence stems partly from Ike Turner’s innovations, no less — for the country to finally recognize Ike and Tina’s prowess. But the couple’s take on “Proud Mary” would also be the last time the world knew Ike Turner solely on the merits of his musicality, before cocaine, violence and flagrant profligacy destroyed his reputation. Tina Turner, meanwhile, finally did seize control of her destiny, and is now celebrated worldwide for her powerhouse vocals and indomitable personality — qualities never better encapsulated than on “Proud Mary.”\n\nThe long and winding story of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue starts with Ike, a child of the Great Depression born Izear Turner Jr. in 1939 and raised in Clarksdale, Miss. In his 1999 autobiography Takin’ Back My Name, Turner details the harrowing childhood experiences that shaped his adult neuroses: as a three-year-old, he watched a white man assault his father as revenge for an alleged affair — Izear Turner Sr. lived another two or three years in a tent in the family’s yard before finally succumbing to his injuries — and describes Philip Reese, the artist his widowed mother married, as a “violent alcoholic.” In addition, six-year-old Ike was molested by a middle-aged female neighbor.\n\nTurner’s interest in music started in his early teens. While working as an elevator operator at downtown Clarksdale’s Alcazar Hotel, he spent his breaks watching DJ John Friskillo spin records on WROX, a radio station headquartered inside the hotel. Turner learned to play boogie-woogie piano under the tutelage of blues legend Pinetop Perkins, and later joined a Clarksdale act called the Tophatters, an ensemble of roughly 30 players; when the group split in two, Turner renamed his half the Kings of Rhythm, a name applied to different configurations of his stage act for the duration of his career.\n\nFrom his teenage years onward, Turner found himself at the forefront of the burgeoning rock n’ roll movement. The first of his accomplishments might be the most enduring: in 1951, with the post-Tophatters Kings of Rhythm, he penned and recorded what many historians consider the very first rock n’ roll song, “Rocket 88.” While structurally rhythm and blues, its raucous energy (derived in part from guitarist Willie Kizart’s broken amp, which produced a “fuzzbox” sound) proved an enormous hit with youths across the racial gap, sending “Rocket 88” to the top of the Billboard R&B chart and keeping it there for five weeks. Its success birthed Ike’s deep distrust towards the music industry: Sam Phillips’ Sun Records credited “Rocket 88” to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, not Ike Turner’s Kings of Rhythm, and Turner was paid only $20 despite the single’s smash success. From then on, Turner maintained an iron grip on his music business dealings, founding multiple independent labels to release his own compositions.\n\nTurner repeatedly lent his piano chops to sessions on both Sun Records and Modern Records while doubling as a talent scout, organizing recordings with B.B. King and playing piano on the guitarist’s first two R&B chart-toppers, “You Know I Love You” and “3 O’Clock Blues,” as well as discovering now-legendary blues musicians like Chester Burnett (aka Howlin’ Wolf), Bobby “Blue” Bland and Little Junior Parker. In his early twenties, Turner rigorously taught himself guitar by ear, and developed an explosive style characterized by his aggressive manipulation of the tremolo arm, an approach that later influenced a young Jimi Hendrix, whom Ike once hired for a handful of gigs. In the process of learning guitar, Turner also fashioned himself into a more compelling frontman, and in 1954, he relocated the newly-reformed Kings of Rhythm to St. Louis, storming the city’s nightclub scene with the band’s prescient “rocking” take on R&B. It was on one such night in 1957 at East St. Louis’ Manhattan Club when Turner first met his musical soulmate.\n\nAnna Mae Bullock grew up in the unincorporated town of Nutbush, Tenn., and she too struggled with parental neglect. Bullock was 11 years old when her mother abandoned her to escape an abusive relationship with her husband; Bullock stayed with her grandparents until her grandmother’s death in 1955, when she moved back in with her mother, now a resident of St. Louis. Bullock served in her Baptist church choir, developing a raw style of singing that intrigued Ike Turner when she finally performed on stage that night at the Manhattan Club. It wasn’t the first time Bullock had asked Turner to allow her to sing with the Kings of Rhythm, but Turner never called her up, so she seized upon the microphone of Turner’s drummer Eugene Washington (whom Bullock’s sister was dating at the time) and belted out B.B. King’s “You Know I Love You.” Despite the rawness, Turner was sufficiently impressed; he hired Bullock, trained her to sing professionally, and molded her into a featured vocalist in his act.\n\nBullock, credited as “Little Ann” from 1958 onward, strived to become the Kings of Rhythm’s lead vocalist, but Turner preferred to feature a revolving roster of female singers, whom he dubbed the Ikettes. Undeterred, Bullock toured with the band for the next two years, forming a strong platonic relationship with Turner while developing a romantic bond with saxophonist Raymond Hill, who left the Kings of Rhythm while Bullock was pregnant with their son. As their friendship developed, Turner confided to Bullock about his inferiority complex and his fears of being exploited; though she harbored awareness about his rampant promiscuity and his aggressive streak, Bullock found Turner’s honesty and vulnerability endearing, and their friendship eventually blossomed into romance, although “blossom” might be the wrong word: after two unnamed musicians threatened to rape her, Bullock fearfully retreated to Ike’s bedroom, and they consummated the relationship.\n\n“A Fool in Love,” the first single ever credited to Ike and Tina Turner, originally wasn’t supposed to feature Bullock at all. It was meant for Art Lassiter, whom Ike tapped to front the Kings of Rhythm that year, but his failure to show up for rehearsals inspired Bullock to record demo vocals in Lassiter’s stead. She throws her entire being into “A Fool in Love,” especially on the song’s refrain, where her voice zooms overhead her backing vocalists like a screaming jet. Turner initially planned to erase Bullock’s vocals when Lassiter returned, but when he sent the demo to Juggy Murray of Sue Records, Murray saw huge star potential in Bullock and offered Turner a substantial advance. Turner refashioned Bullock as the wild centerpiece of his act, and renamed her “Tina” for its phonetic similarity to the comic book Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.\n\nThe Ike and Tina Turner Revue famously honed its onstage rapport across the so-called “chitlin’ circuit” — the network of Midwestern clubs offering succor for Black performers throughout the Jim Crow era and beyond. By the mid-1960s, the Turners were mainstays on the country’s R&B charts, but first reached the pop charts across the Atlantic thanks to the Phil Spector-produced “River Deep – Mountain High.” A big-budget epic produced largely without Ike’s involvement, the song flopped in the U.S., and its domestic failure effectively ended the producer’s career. Its inverse popularity in England, however, brought Ike and Tina to the attention of Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones, who offered the Revue a spot on their 1966 British tour: according to Tina as well as Stones guitarist Keith Richards, Jagger learned his swagger from watching her perform onstage. As the Rolling Stones ascended in popularity, a wider audience witnessed the Revue and discovered its budding fusion of hard rock and R&B, and by the end of the decade, when the Turners supported the Stones on a series of U.S. dates, the Revue was poised to explode in its native land.\n\nSince the crossover success of “Rocket 88,” Ike Turner realized that the quickest path to a hit was to appeal to as many demographics as possible, which is why he endeavored to market his music to both white and Black audiences. By the end of the 1960s, the landscape of rock music had changed, and white artists like the Stones, the Beatles and Bob Dylan had furnished the elemental power of rock n’ roll into “rock” music, which appealed significantly more to white audiences. In response, the Turners began integrating songs from these and other white artists into their act, and the results were immediate. Their rendition of the Beatles’ “Come Together” hit the R&B Top 40, and as openers on the Stones’ ’69 American tour, the Revue covered fare like the headliners’ “Honky Tonk Women” to rapturous applause. The Turners continued their transition to hard rock to start the next decade, releasing the Come Together LP in May 1970; from there, they vigilantly scoured the airwaves for additional songs to adapt, eventually landing on the record that would become their ticket to nationwide stardom.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary” landed in January 1969 as the A-side of the first single from the band’s landmark second LP, Bayou Country. By March, it had become California-based CCR’s first major hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. John Fogerty, Creedence’s frontman and primary songwriter, conceived “Proud Mary” shortly after receiving his honorable discharge from the U.S. National Guard, channeling his anxiety about his wartime draft status into a song about abdicating responsibility for freedom. The song’s simplicity (opening with a two-chord repetition and landing on a descendant third), along with its driving beat and compelling male harmonies, resonated heavily with the rock crowd and helped Creedence Clearwater Revival pioneer what would later be called “swamp rock” — a counterculture interpretation of the blues, R&B and rock n’ roll music pulsating in chitlin’ circuit hubs like Memphis’ Beale Street.\n\nTina Turner’s first autobiography, I, Tina, claims that she originally pushed for the Ike and Tina Revue to cover “Proud Mary” after a prospective Ikette brought in the track for her audition. Ike blanched at first, but then he heard another cover of the song by the Checkmates Ltd., a mixed-race R&B act whose rendition augmented Fogerty’s original composition with a heightened tempo, more dynamic backing vocals and Phil Spector’s orchestral, reverb-drenched Wall of Sound production. This version of “Proud Mary” provided the launchpad for the Revue’s cover, which Ike and drummer Soko Richardson rewrote to draw on both previous versions. “I said, ‘Let’s do it, but let’s change it,’” Tina said to Rolling Stone in 1971. “We just sort of broke into the Black version of it.” Instead of CCR’s C-to-A two-chord intro, Turner starts immediately on the major D chord and solitarily strums his electric guitar at around 90 BPM, even slower than the original. The band follows, lightly outlining the track “nice and easy.” Those quoted words come from Tina’s spoken intro, which was itself inspired by yet another cover of “Proud Mary,” recorded months prior by R&B great Solomon Burke.\n\nUnbeknownst to everyone outside of the act’s personal circle, Tina’s romantic relationship with Ike had fully eroded by the time Liberty Records released “Proud Mary” on Jan. 14, 1971. Turner had already found band life to be chaotic even before Ike’s signature malevolence surfaced; she noted that the Ikettes would be berated and personally fined for everything from speaking too loudly backstage to catching runs in their nylons. Separately, upon her pregnancy with his child in 1960, Ike accused his live-in girlfriend Lorraine Taylor (with whom he had already fathered two children) of having an affair, and she attempted suicide.\n\nIt wasn’t until the birth of “Tina Turner” that Bullock found herself subject to Turner’s instability. She was beaten by a wooden shoe stretcher during the recording of “A Fool in Love.” She was forced to care for Taylor’s two children after they were left on Ike’s doorstep in 1963. Her unhappiness at unfair compensation for her work earned beatings. And she was forced to match Ike’s relentless touring schedule through sickness, anemia, depression and another pregnancy. By the time Spector contacted her to sing on “River Deep,” Tina understood that the prosperity she had accrued had come at the cost of her physical and mental well-being. She made attempts to withdraw from her relationship with Ike, instead reframing it as a business partnership, but her efforts proved fruitless.\n\nTurner himself understood that his success hinged on Tina, whom he believed to be his creation. That belief, mixed with his mental instability and proclivity toward sadism, heightened the abuse Tina suffered. Any expression of her unhappiness or discontent at her situation was met with physical violence. Beatings were occasionally accompanied by sex, which Tina understood years later to be rape. In 1966, she collected her children and attempted to flee, but Ike chased them down and accosted her at a bus terminal. Two years later, after a lifetime of his abuse, Tina decided to die, overdosing on Valium pills before a concert, only to be rushed to the hospital by her bandmates. (In certain apocryphal tales, Ike berated her in the hospital for her lack of judgment, and for the ding to his pocketbook.)\n\nTurner rebounded from her suicide attempt ahead of the “Proud Mary” session thanks to her inception into the Soka Gakkai school of Buddhism. She reconciled her inner torment by chanting the teaching’s words nam-myoho-renge-kyo (roughly translated, “Devotion to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra”) for hours at a time. Around the same time, Ike was introduced via two well-known Vegas performers (allegedly Elvis Presley and comedian Redd Foxx) to another life-changing entity: cocaine, the substance that broke his strict teetotalism and worsened his behavioral volatility. His advancing addiction ensured his treatment of Tina Turner continued to worsen, and the version you hear of her on “Proud Mary” is one still in the process of surviving him.\n\nThe crux of “Proud Mary” is an act of liberation. In Creedence Clearwater Revival’s original version, it’s freedom from the jaws of a “good job in the city,” a turn of phrase used sardonically by Fogerty to mean a life lived in servitude. The song’s title comes from the riverboat the protagonist uses to leave that life behind, and its choruses are dedicated to the Proud Mary’s benevolence as a vessel. Importantly, Fogerty doesn’t specify a destination for the boat, and so it is the simple act of the escape itself (the “greener grass,” in a sense) that powers the song’s joyous sense of adventure. Indeed, it is only from a safe distance that Fogerty’s narrator can look back with fondness on his circumstances, a sentiment captured in the song’s most potent couplet: “I never saw the good side of the city/’Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen.” Anywhere, he argues, is better than the past.\n\nThe Turners recorded “Proud Mary” at Inglewood, California’s Bolic Sound Studios, the facility Ike finished building just months earlier. Tina’s vocals are cut into two parts; note the dryness of her voice throughout her spoken intro, and the reverb that cloaks it upon the arrival of the vocal melody. If you’re hearing “Proud Mary” for the first time, you might be struck immediately by Tina’s charisma as a performer; she speaks in a tight, almost business-like cadence, keeping her vowels short and lingering on her fricatives, in sharp contrast to the easygoing strum of Ike’s guitar. He supplements her lead with a deep, bassy vocal harmony, teasing the upcoming first verse while she monologues. When the lyrics do start, Tina’s voice evokes the even-keeled thrust of Fogerty’s drawl but deviates when she reaches the name of the titular riverboat, letting loose alongside her backing Ikettes. Yet besides that plateau, the members of the Revue continue to demonstrate restraint. Richardson sticks to his closed hi-hat hits, Ike and Jackie Clark keep their electric guitars muted, and Patrick Gammon plinks out a supporting rhythm on piano.\n\nFor the song’s tempered A-section, Ike and Tina sing almost like equals, carrying the lead vocals together. That changes when the Revue slows down two minutes in, simultaneously pulling back the slingshot on its cover. And then the horns let loose: two saxophones, two trumpets, and a trombone, all blasting brassy accents over the band’s nearly-doubled tempo and turning “Proud Mary,” as Tina promised, into something “nice and rough.” Ike dips out of the vocals, leaving Tina and the Ikettes to match the track’s new propulsive energy. When Tina re-enters, starting on the first verse again, she carries the euphoria behind the Checkmates’ cover on her shoulders, and at an even faster pace. And unlike the Checkmates’ hazy, overblown chorus, this version of “Proud Mary” features the Ikettes (it can only be speculated which Ikettes are featured) combining their voices with Tina’s to produce an economic gospel choir: four people with the power of 40.\n\nTina had proven her vocal potency on record since 1960’s “A Fool in Love,” and yet “Proud Mary” introduced her to much of America. Her searing performance ranks among her finest: the way she scrapes along the word “rollin’,” with a willful force that borders on desperation, would be haunting were it not for the sense of joy accompanying its utterance. Besides Tina’s voice, the record’s greatest quality is how closely it replicates the power of the Revue as a live act. Much of that credit goes to Brent Maher, the engineer who conducted the “Proud Mary” sessions at the ornate, labyrinthine Bolic Sound. After witnessing the band live, Maher rearranged the studio’s instruments and gear to better replicate how they would set up on stage. He also insisted against separating the individual members with sound booths, instead allowing the instruments to bleed into each other. Through KORD, you can hear for yourself how this trick provides ambience: in the energetic B-section, for instance, note how the drums can be heard on both Gammon’s piano track and Clark’s guitar track. If you remove either, the drums don’t sound nearly as full. Maher treated Tina’s vocals similarly, recording her in front of the band, and you can hear trace elements of the band around her if you isolate her performance, especially during the gaps of silence.\n\n“Proud Mary” was the second single from the Turners’ Come Together follow-up, the ironically titled Workin’ Together. The single was their biggest hit to date, and it changed the trajectory of their career for good. A spot on CBS’s Ed Sullivan Show, aired mere days before the single’s release, vividly captures everything that turned the Revue into a fan favorite: the tight playing and ebullience of the musicians, the athletic choreography of the Ikettes, and the sheer magnetism of Tina herself, savvily dressed in gilded fringe and long hair that helplessly attracts the eyes to her movements. The Sullivan performance also, darkly, captures Tina as a performer able to push through the condemned reality of her backstage life with a toothy grin and smiling eyes. Several months later, a Rolling Stone feature profile (which inaugurated Tina Turner as both the first female and the first Black woman to grace the magazine’s cover) exposed the couple’s ridiculously lavish lifestyle, and provided a retrospective of their hard-won path to stardom. But Rolling Stone writer Ben Fong-Torres also subtly hints at the grimness of Tina’s circumstances: he portrays Ike’s lecherous side and its clash against Tina’s quest for domestic order, and reveals Ike’s penchant for forcing her to perform through severe illness. Most concernedly, Fong-Torres illuminates Tina’s reluctant submission to Ike’s will. “My whole thing is the fact that I am to Ike… I’m going to use the term ‘doll,’ that you sort of mold,” she infamously confided. “In other words, he put me through a lot of changes.”\n\nTina endured Ike’s abuse for as long as she could take it. In 1976, in a limo on the way to a show in Dallas, she took it no further. Tina, dressed In a white Yves Saint Laurent suit, finally responded to another of Ike’s assaults with retaliatory kicks and punches; both parties emerged from the limo bloodied, and after checking into their hotel room, she ran away while Ike was asleep. With no money and no belongings, Turner found a nearby motel willing to lend her a room, and gradually started the process of separating herself entirely from Ike and the Revue. The process culminated in a formal divorce the same year, and in an effort to make sure she couldn’t be tied to Ike in any way, she relinquished all of her shared assets. Ike would keep the house, the studio, the publishing royalties, and all the money. All that Tina was left with, at the end of the proceedings, was her performing name — a decision that contributed to her remarkable comeback years later.\n\nTina’s departure had a seismic effect on Ike Turner’s life. After years spent threatening her and her network of family and friends, he retreated to his opulent sonic palace and lost himself to his vices. Turner owed money to the record companies, but though he attempted collaborations with singers like Holly Maxwell and Chaka Khan, he struggled to put together acts that sold quite like his work with Tina. At the dawn of the 1980s, his addiction to cocaine finally caught up to him; years of substance abuse had ripped a hole through his nasal septum, and his myriad illicit activities caught the eye of federal authorities. Multiple run-ins with the law and stints in jail hindered Turner’s career aspirations, and by the mid-1980s he disappeared from the public eye almost completely. When Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, he was in jail again, and couldn’t accept the award.\n\nSome have called it “karmic retribution” — even if the couple’s saga is really just the great cycle of generational hurt ever rotating — but Tina Turner’s rebirth as a mega-successful solo artist is now the most visible reminder of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue’s heyday. After years performing as a retro act, she released “What’s Love Got to Do with It,” her first and only number one Billboard Hot 100 single and the recipient of three awards at the 1985 Grammys, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. “What’s Love Got to Do with It” was the first of three Top Ten pop singles drawn from Turner’s fifth solo LP, Private Dancer, which rebranded her as an MTV-friendly star in sync with the decade’s sleek, slick synth-pop. She went on to break concert attendance records, and starred opposite Mel Gibson in the 1985 blockbuster Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Then, in 1986, the truth of Turner’s harrowing experience in the Revue came to light via her best-selling autobiography, I, Tina. The book, co-written with MTV News anchor Kurt Loder, portrayed Ike Turner as a monster, forever damaging his legacy as a rock n’ roll pioneer.\n\nThe 1993 release of director Brian Gibson’s Oscar-nominated Tina Turner biopic What’s Love Got to Do with It, starring Angela Bassett as Tina and Laurence Fishburne as Ike, exposed its subject’s inspirational story to a worldwide audience. Turner’s life was also adapted into a jukebox musical, Tina, which had its world premiere in London in April 2018, and despite her death five years later, she is destined to remain a symbol of resilience for subjugated women everywhere. “The river won’t stop for me,” Turner attested in Private Dancer’s kickoff track “I Might Have Been Queen,” and since then the current pulled, taking her far enough away until she could finally see the good side of the city."
