        "text": "by Sheldon Rocha Leal\n\nReflecting on the recently launched “16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence”, held for the first time in 1991 on the 25th of November, I am reminded of the synergy between this event and a rock music icon. With all the atrocities inflicted on women and children and reminiscing on recent gender-based murders in South Africa I thought it was interesting to note that the campaign happens to coincide with the birth of an icon. Tina Turner turned 80 on the 26th of November, a day after the launch of this international campaign, and the irony is that she has a well documented history with gender-based violence at the hand of her mentor and former husband, Ike Turner.\n\nAs a young kid I was highly influenced by her music, I remember getting a copy of “Foreign Affair” in 1989 as a present and holding my breath as I unwrapped the vinyl in anticipation of what I was about to hear. I remember the vinyl crackling as the first notes of “Steamy Window” coming through the speakers. I was in love. That powerful voice and her presence filled the room. I wanted to belt out songs just like her. I remember my uncle asking me as a kid what I wanted to do when I grew up and I said: I want to sing on stage with Tina Turner. But I’m not the only one she influenced, Madonna states that she used to attend her concerts and stand in the front row so she could look up her short dress. To each their own…So it made me really sad to hear that this icon of rock not only suffered terrible abuse at the hands of her former husband, but that the abuse was greater than I anticipated.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning. Anne Mae Bullock (aka Tina Turner) was born in Nutbush, Tennessee in 1939. Her family initially lived and worked on a cotton farm (her mom, dad and two older sisters). At the start of World War II her parents relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee where they worked at a defense facility and the children were split. Tina went to live with her ultra religious paternal grandparents who were the deacon and deaconess of there Baptist Church. This is purportedly when she started singing in the church choir for the first time.\n\nAfter the Second World War the family was reunited and moved back to Nutbush. But they didn’t stay together for very long, because in 1950 her mother ran off, trying to escape the abuse of her husband (Tina’s dad). The dad remarried and the sisters, along with Tina moved in with their maternal grandmother. The abandonment of her mother left lasting scars on the young Tina. As a teenager she worked as a domestic worker, but was also active as a cheerleader and a member of her school’s female basketball team. At age 16 her grandmother died and she was forced to move in with her mother in St Louis. In 1958 she graduated from high school and started working as a nurse’s aid.\n\nIn St Louis, freely emancipated from the rigors of high school, Tina and her sister started frequenting the local night clubs, where she was exposed to the Kings of Rhythm for the first time. The local band, had accrued quite a following and featured the young and dynamic band leader and guitarist Ike Turner. Tina was completely awestruck by the band, the music they made and longed to sing on stage with the them. At one of their shows, she was given the microphone and urged to sing something, during an intermission. She performed BB King’s “You Know I Love You” and Ike Turner was blown away. He immediately took the young singer under his wing and mentored her. He gave her singing and performance tips and included Tina in the band. He even assisted her with her first recording session in 1958, in which she was billed as “Little Ann” and recorded the song “Boxtop”.\n\nHer major break came in 1960. Ike Turner had written a song entitled “A Fool In Love” for Art Lassiter and booked studio time to record the song. He, however, did not show up for the session and Ike was stuck, having paid for the session, but not having a vocalist to sing on the song. Tina suggested that she fill in and Ike thought that he could use her to sing on the track and then at a later stage erase her voice and drop in Lassiter’s vocal.\n\nWhen a local DJ heard the recording, he urged Ike to send it to Sue Records, a local R&B recording label. The record boss (Juggy Murray) was so impressed with Tina’s vocal that he offered Ike a $25,000 advance for the publishing and recording rights. He also suggested that Tina become the star of the band and that she change her name from Anne to Tina, which rhymes with Sheena (like the Queen of the Jungle). With the name change Juggy Murray was trying to create a stage persona for Tina. Ike liked the idea, added Turner to Tina and Tina Turner was born. To protect “His” idea he trademarked the name so that if Tina ever decided to leave the band, he could replace her with another Tina Turner. It is reported that Tina was not too happy about the name change and that this was the first time Ike struck her because of her defiance.\n\n“A Fool In Love” went on to become a cross-over hit in 1960, peaking at No27 in the USA, at a time when artists of colour struggled to attain mainstream recognition. Based on the success of the single and ensuing hits Ike renamed his band the Ike and Tina Revue and added the Ikettes (female backing vocalists) who supported Tina’s vocals. The Revue was considered one of the hottest acts on the R&B circuit, rivaling artists like James Brown.\n\nIke and Tina married in 1964, but their relationship was not a match made in heaven. Reports claim that the only reason Tina even got romantically involved with the musician was because she was attempting to avoid a band mate who was trying to sexually assault her. With the commencement of their marriage the abuse merely shifted from the band mate to Ike, who years later was diagnosed as Bipolar. His womanizing and cocaine addiction did not help matters and his drug dependency eventually resulted in his ultimate demise in 2007. When he passed Tina issued a brief statement: “Tina hasn’t had any contact with Ike in more than 30 years. No further comment will be made”. Tina’s sister attended the funeral, but Tina herself did not and was criticized by Phil Spector (iconic producer, inventor and songwriter), who stated that she was ungrateful as he had made her a star.\n\nThe band’s big break came in 1966, when Phil Spector approached Ike to produce and write a song for the revue, but especially Tina. He offered Ike a $20,000 advance for creative control over their recording sessions, which birthed “River Deep, Mountain High”. The song was an immense success and brought Ike and Tina international acclaim.\n\nThe physical abuse ensured and by 1968 Tina, desperate and not knowing what to do attempted suicide by taking an overdose of Valium. Whilst at home things were falling apart, their careers were flourishing and in 1969 Ike and Tina headlined shows in Las Vegas which were attended by many famous stars such as Cher, David Bowie, Janis Joplin, Ray Charles, Elton John and Elvis Presley. Later in 1969 when The Rolling Stones toured the USA, they asked Ike and Tina to open up for them, which raised the duo’s profile in their home country. In 1971 Ike and Tina won their first, and only, Grammy Award for a cover of the Creedence Clear Water Revival song “Proud Mary” a song which peaked at No4 in the USA and shipped over 1million units in the country.\n\nBy 1972 the band was signed to United Artists and Tina started writing more of the duo’s songs and they started relying less on cover versions. Their success continued into the 1970s with additional successful albums, singles and two more Grammy nominations, but by the mid-1970s Ike’s cocaine addiction has worsened and so did the abuse. In 1976 on their way to a concert in Dallas, Ike and Tina got into a violent altercation, which resulted in Tina running away and the ultimate demise of their marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 1978 and Tina assumed the responsibility of paying all the debts incurred from cancelled shows. Famously Tina said that she did not want anything from Ike, besides the name, which he relinquished.\n\nAfter leaving Ike with nothing and burdened with huge debt, she struggled to make ends meet. She released a few albums, but they all flopped and because she was seen to have absconded from her responsibilities, and as a result of Ike’s power in the industry, promoters refused to book her for shows. She was therefore forced to do small cabaret performances at even smaller venues. Cher, who had undergone similar abuse at the hands of her husband, took pity on the diva and booked her to appear on her TV variety series. This helped to increase Tina’s profile and she started getting more gigs. The problem was, however, that she was stuck without a recording deal, mounting debts and no one was willing to give her a chance.\n\nThis, however, all changed in 1983. David Bowie, a major star at the time, was about to release his album “Let’s Dance”. On the eve of the launch of the album, he told record executives that he would not be celebrating the release as he was going to watch his favorite singer perform at The Ritz in New York. This endorsement sparked off a bidding war for the Rock Goddess and within a short period of time she had secured a recording deal with Capitol Records, she was 44 at the time.\n\nThe first product of this deal was “Private Dancer”. The album was released in 1984 peaked at No3 USA and No2 UK and shipped more than 20million units worldwide. Tina had 7 hits off the album including “Private Dancer”, “Let’s Stay Together” and “What’s Love Got To Do With It”. The album made her an international star and for her efforts she won 4 Grammy Awards, including 2 of the big 4: Song and Record of the Year.\n\nThis was ultimate validation of her talent and retribution against all the years of abuse at Ike’s hands. She had managed to achieve in one album what Ike and Tina had not achieved in 20 years. The 20million albums shipped and 4 Grammies won was more than the combined sales and winnings that Ike ever managed to achieve.\n\nHer star continued to grow and in 1985 she appeared as a guest vocalist on “We Are The World” and was approached by Mel Gibson to appear in and sing the theme song for his new movie, “Mad Max: Beyond The Thunderdome”. The movie was a sequel to the cult favorite “Mad Max”. “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)” was a massive hit. The song peaked at No2 in the USA and No3 in the UK and was nominated for a Grammy and Golden Globe. Although she did not win a Grammy for “We Don’t Need Another Hero” she won a Grammy in 1986 for another song she contributed to the “Mad Max” soundtrack “One Of The Living”.\n\nAt around this time Tina met the love of her life, German record executive Erwin Bach in London at an EMI party. He is 16 years her junior and in 2013 after 28 years together they got married in Switzerland.\n\nBased on her success and talent she was courted by many of the world’s greatest stars and collaborated with David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Bono, Barry White, Sting, Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams. In 1989 she released probably one of her most recognizable hits “The Best” from her album “Foreign Affair”. The song was originally performed by Bonnie Tyler in 1988, but Tina made it a hit, a year later. The song only peaked at No15 in the USA, but peaked at No5 in the UK and has become one of Tina’s signature tunes. Interestingly the song featured backing vocals by one of my favorite backing singers, Tessa Niles.\n\nIn 1993 a movie based on Tina’s autobiography, “I Tina”, was released, “What’s Love Got To Do With It”. The movie featured Laurence Fishburne and Angela Basset as Tina Turner. Tina performed the theme song for the movie “I Don’t Wanna Fight”. In 1995 she was selected to sing the theme song for the James Bond movie “Goldeneye”, written by Bono and The Edge. Although the song was a massive hit outside of the US, it did nothing on the American charts.\n\nIn 1994 Tina moved to Switzerland where she has lived ever since. In 1999 she released her last solo album “Twenty Four Seven”. She continued touring and making guest appearances on other people’s albums and in 2009 announced that she would be retiring. Her farewell tour “Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour” celebrated her 50 year career and generated over $132million at the box office. In 2016 she was integrally involved in the conceptualization of a musical based on her music, “Tina”. The musical opened in 2018 to great fanfare.\n\nOver the years she has been honoured by various bodies for her immense contribution to the music industry. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1986, was inducted into The Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, revived the Légion d’Honneur in 1996, has 12 Grammy Awards including a Lifetime Achievement she revived in 2018 and was recognized with a Kennedy Center Honour in 2005.\n\nIn 2016 she was diagnosed with intestinal cancer and high blood pressure and resorted to using homeopathic medication which resulted in kidney failure. She was forced to go onto dialysis and went through a major depression and even considered assisted suicide. Fortunately her husband was a match and donated a kidney and in 2017 underwent a kidney transplant.\n\nTina Turner embodies the resilient nature for which we should all strive. Through much adversity and abuse at the hands of her parents, mentor and band mates she managed to rise above it all, becoming a greater star than what she started off as. Today she is one of the most honoured vocalists in history, has shipped over 200million records worldwide, found the love of her life and lives in bliss in Switzerland. She proves that it’s never too late to start a life and that the sky is the limit if you put your mind to something. Many angels helped her along the way, but through it all she had faith, worked hard and made it work. She is a true star who has left an indelible legacy for many artists and women for centuries to come."
