INTRODUCTION

___________________________

It is often said that truth is stranger than fiction. All God’s Children proves it.

This is Rob’s story. Never before has a story like this been told. It will disgust you; it will make you angry; it will, at times, make you sad. All of these emotions I have felt while reading Rob’s story.

It is brought to you as a series of scenes from Rob’s life. There are scenes of boyish revelry, and scenes of vulgar sexual and physical abuse. Some of these scenes are graphic and may be disturbing — but that’s what really happened. The scenes are fact, not fiction. They did take place. They have not been invented from a writer’s imagination, as the perpetrators of the abuse may claim.

Rob’s story reveals that when the covers of decency are unveiled, there are pockets of society in New Zealand that are abusive, sexually deviant, and completely alien to what we assume to be a decent society. It shows how an act of physical and sexual abuse against a child can cause them to be sucked into a corrosive and corrupting spiral of self-doubt, social abandonment, and eventually and inevitable an aggressive disregard for social structure and standards. For Rob, the entry into that spiral began with violent abuse from his stepmother and the complete breakdown of the family structure. While under state care, his vulnerability was exploited by caregivers, the police and even the church.

The physical torment and mental torture that these caregivers inflicted have violated and tortured Rob. His thoughts have incarcerated him in a perpetual hell that not even sleep can relieve.

Rob’s story is a naked revelation of an aspect of New Zealand society that we choose to ignore. Yet it has happened, and probably is still happening here, today, within your community.

Of all those who are likely to reject the facts of Rob’s past, the church is likely to be the most vehement, and they are likely to do so behind the cloak of respectability. The fact is, the sexual abuse that Rob suffered from members of the church did happen. He is aware of similar acts that have happened within the last couple of years. It is about time that New Zealand churches admitted that some of their members are abusing their power and betraying the trust that is given to them. And it’s about time they concentrated their efforts on seeking remedies for these problems.

But the church is not the only group that All God’s Children asks questions of. Deep and searching questions are asked about the way society treats those who have suffered abuse. This includes the police and the courts.

There are also questions that need asking about the way children and young persons are cared for by the state. How many foster parents, for example are committed more to the money they receive from the government than they are to the kids they are meant to care for? From Rob’s story you will see that what children really need is a loving and caring environment. Does state care provide that environment; is a question we must all ask?

There is a great deal we can, and should learn from Rob’s story. If we don’t, the same dreadful abuses will continue. More and more children will suffer long-lasting trauma and be sucked into a destructive vortex.

This is a unique story. It gets inside the mind of an individual who has suffered incredible abuse from all sorts of people. He has survived against all odds. Incredibly, he has the willpower to relive the horror of the past and ask for a better future for the victimized children of today.

It would be easy to dismiss lightly Rob Sinclair’s account of his experiences by saying, of course, times have changed since then. Now that we have the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act, no child in the care of the Department of Social Welfare would be treated like that.

To a large extent the statement is true, but there is still a great deal of child abuse in New Zealand, just as horrific as that in this book. Most occurs in private homes. When discovered — if discovered, since there is no mandatory reporting of suspected abuse — the child is usually placed in alternative care and, theoretically, all is well.

However, if the placement is with extended family members or in private care, there is little monitoring of the situation. Only four Social Welfare residences remain, catering only for Youth Justice Referrals. Many young people in out-of-family care are therefore in privately-run institutions, where the standards of care have been shown to be extremely variable (ref. Who Cares for the Kids? Human Rights Commission, 1992).

There are no common standards which apply to all out-of-family placements in the country: In Ministry of Education special schools, psychiatric institutions, prisons and corrective training centers, health camps, D.S.W. Residences and private situations. There is no requirement that staff must have appropriate qualifications and must be registered so that it would not be unlikely that someone with a record of child abuse could be employed. Moreover, there is scant provision for follow-up of placements, and young people seldom have a way to raise concerns since there are few institutions with formal grievance procedures.

Children and young people are among the most vulnerable members of our society yet we often give them the least protection. New Zealand has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, lagging shamefully behind at least 102 other countries, including Great Britain, Australia, Canada and most of Western Europe.

How can we say that Rob Sinclair’s story wouldn’t happen today?

CHAPTER 1

HOME SWEET HOME

___________________________

If you don’t shut up you’ll get another going over, you little shit.

Shut up! gasped the breathless woman.

If you think that was bad you haven’t seen anything yet.

Stop whining!

My cries turned to a whimper. To an onlooker I must have appeared more as a beaten and terrorized dog than a child. My small, eight-year-old body twitched and shivered in response to the cold, the pain, and the numbing terror. Thoughts of escape were soon dismissed as I submitted to my stepmother’s will. I prayed silently for release, and begged to a divine being, should there be any, for intervention and then screamed aloud for mercy. Promises not to run away again brought no respite. Her violent rage needed a victim… I was it.

Ignoring my screams, she dragged me into the bathroom and set about delivering the punishment in a deliberate, systematic pattern. An electrical cord, presumably from some abandoned appliance, was neatly folded over the rim of the ancient cast iron tub. It gave me a hint of what was to come. A vision of a medieval torture chamber flickered through my mind. That vision was forgotten as the enraged woman gripped a clump of hair and wrenched my head under the cold running tap then plunged it into the rising water.

She struck at my bent and submissive body with her free hand then lurched for and grasped the cord. It whirled through the air until it cracked against my exposed, bruising flesh. The satanic symphony of screams, gurgles and splashing was interrupted only by the unrelenting barrage of obscenities and curses of the half-crazed assault. After what seemed like an eternity, but in reality was only minutes, the woman tired, and the cord’s savage bite diminished. As my stepmother’s grip loosened, I squirmed and slid to the floor — shrieking in fear, hoping for mercy. For the moment, numbness anaesthetized the pain.

Although the threat of drowning passed, the whipping did not. The cord was now less selective where it chose to strike. Any part of my body was its target. Battered, I squirmed into a fetal position, seeking refuge in the small space between the bottom of the bathtub and the sodden floor. In the confined space the cord was useless and was abandoned in favor of kicking and punching. She kicked and kicked, and then kicked a last time at the huddled form.

Up! Up! Get up, you little bastard. Get to your room and stay there until you’re told.

I needed no second invitation. Hanging onto the bath, I pulled my battered body to as near an upright position as I could manage. I struggled to regain my senses. Staggering from the watery hell into a room I instinctively knew was the kitchen, I moved through an adjoining bedroom and into the small sun-porch I considered to be home. I flinched as I eased myself between the rough woolen blankets on the rickety bed and clutched the covers over my head. The covered darkness did little to block out the perverted reality. The woman, defying any thoughts of forgiveness and still in convulsions of intermittent rage, stormed the small room and beat at my forlorn figure beneath the blanket. The lifelessness of my form seemed to appease her rage. Her screams of foulmouthed abuse diminished. The lights snapped out and the thundering crash and reverberation as the door slammed and pummelled on its hinges, signalled that the episode was over. The silence and the wet cold darkness were a relief beyond my wildest expectations. Peace! Oh, thank God, she’s gone.

I could not hold back my tears. Rivulets flowed down my tender and swollen face. I became aware of the pounding of my heart and could feel the growing pain from the lashings and blows. With each heartbeat the pain became more intense. Soon all of my senses were overwhelmed by the searing agony of my beating. The intensifying pain became unbearable, and with a feeling of utter hopelessness I again prayed for relief. Please let me die. I don’t want to live.

I knew there might not be a God, but there was no one else who would listen. The tears and pain subsided into the inky blackness of sleep. Even in sleep there was no escaping my stepmother. She infiltrated everything; there was no release from her dominance.

The man stood over the bed and looked down at my semiconscious body. He shook his head. The fucking bitch, he muttered beneath his breath. He tiptoed out of the room and eased the door shut.

YOU BITCH!

YOU BITCH!

The woman’s verbal retaliation, the crash of crockery, and the sharp sounds of splintering wood caved in on the night’s silence.

The two little girls were the first to be awaked by the fierce battle being fought in the kitchen and living room. Spontaneously they burst into tears. I awoke as well. I didn’t cry; I just listened. I hoped that if there was going to be a victor at all, it would be my father. But whatever the outcome, I knew that there was no refuge from my stepmother’s fury. I knew that the cycle of violence would continue when my father left for work the next morning. That’s just the way it was in this household that had gone crazy. I pulled myself out of the bed, crept through my stepsisters’ room then slowly opened the living room door.

The destruction and noise had reached full fighting proportions. Concern for my father caused me to ease my way through the night’s darkness to a point where a sliver of light revealed the destruction of furniture and crockery. The screams and curses indicated the battle had moved to the kitchen. I cautiously picked my way through the ruins and discreetly peered into the kitchen. My father sat straddling the kicking, scratching, spitting woman. An unending flow of screams and curses filled the room.

Get off me, you bastard. Piss off.

My father grabbed her wrists in an attempt to deflect her raking nails that had already injured his face.

Not until you calm down.

Fuck you, you drunken bastard. Fuck you.

The impasse continued until she relaxed her resistance. He tentatively released her and got to his feet, hoping that the rage had passed. He realized his mistake too late to avoid the cutting edge of the butcher’s knife. It sliced through the air and more by chance than good judgment, cut a neat furrow in his scalp. His gasp was followed by a quick retreat into the living room. He slammed the door shut and anchored it into its frame with his shoulder. Crockery and furniture, and any household item of moderate size, battered the other side.

He adjusted his stance and raised his hand to his scalp. He
