On Wednesday May 18th we will screen our feature-length documentary film All God’s Children at Kultursalon Roderich in Kreuzberg. It will be the German premiere of the film! And if all goes well it will even have German subtitles by then.

Through the eyes of three families, All God’s Children tells the personal story of the first boarding school for children of missionaries to be investigated for abuse at the hands of the parents’ missionary colleagues. The survivors and parents share their journey of seeking justice, redemption and healing.

I will be in attendance to answer questions and discuss the film.
