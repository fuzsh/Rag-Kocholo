        "text": "While Laurie never planned to be a children’s performer, looking back on her career it\n\nalmost seems inevitable. While growing up in Princeton, New Jersey, Laurie was always\n\ninvolved in music, whether singing in choirs, playing in bands, or performing in musical\n\ntheater. In high school and throughout college (at Rutgers University), she toured Europe\n\nwith several choirs and orchestras as a soloist and guitarist. After graduation, Laurie\n\nspent several years as a children’s music specialist at New York area preschool and day\n\ncare centers. Working with children became the perfect creative outlet for Laurie to\n\nexpress her talents and create something that, she says, “has turned out to be incredibly\n\nRewarding.”\n\nLaurie was the first recording artist ever to perform in music videos on Nick Jr. and was a\n\nbeloved presence on the network’s Jack’s Big Music Show series. Her music videos now\n\nappear regularly on NBCUniversal’s Sprout House and on The Laurie Berkner Band’s\n\nYouTube channel. She is a frequent presence on SiriusXM’s Kids Place Live. Laurie also created a ten-chapter Audible Original Series titled Laurie Berkner’s Song and Story Kitchen, which debuted in November 2018. She maintains a busy touring schedule and has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, and the White House, among many prestigious venues.\n\nLaurie has released fifteen bestselling, award-winning albums: Whaddaya Think Of That\n\n(1997); Buzz Buzz (1998); Victor Vito (1999); Under A Shady Tree (2002); Rocketship\n\nRun (2008); The Best Of The Laurie Berkner Band (2010); A Laurie Berkner Christmas\n\n(2012); Laurie Berkner Lullabies (2014); The Ultimate Laurie Berkner Band Collection\n\n(2014); Laurie Berkner’s Favorite Classic Kids’ Songs (2015); Superhero (2016);\n\nLaurie Berkner: The Dance Remixes (2017); Waiting For The Elevator (2019); Let’s Go! (2021); and Another Laurie Berkner Christmas (2022).

The Laurie Berkner Band (2006) and Party Day! (2011).\n\nLaurie authored three picture books for Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers, each based on one of her beloved songs: We Are the Dinosaurs, Pillowland, and Monster Boogie, Laurie previously authored four books based on her songs, including two Barnes & Noble NOOK Kids™ e-books.\n\nVenturing into the world of the theater Laurie has written music and lyrics for three Off-\n\nBroadway children’s musicals produced by New York City Children’s Theater: Wanda’sMonster (2013), The Amazing Adventures of Harvey and the Princess (2014), and\n\nInterstellar Cinderella (2017).\n\nIn 2018, Laurie wrote and produced a 10-chapter audio series for kids called, “Laurie Berkner’s Song and Story Kitchen”, which was released as an Audible Original on audible. Season 2 was released in 2022.\n\nLaurie continues to be inspired by her audience. “I want to create songs that matter for\n\nchildren,” she says. “I was singing once and saw a four-year-old girl shut her eyes and\n\nstart swaying to the music. I thought, ‘That’s the reason I got into music.’ It keeps me\n\nwanting to do more.”\n\nWhen she’s not making music, Laurie enjoys visiting the farmers’ market for organic\n\nproduce, knitting, biking and spending time with her husband, Brian, and their daughter,\n\nLucy. They live in New York City.\n\nBob’s prolific television career has included writing and producing songs for Nick Jr. shows including Dora The Explorer and Jack’s Big Music Show; PBS shows such as Sesame Street and Gullah Gullah Island; Disney’s Out of the Box and HBO’s Jammin’ Animals. Bob collaborated with Jonathan Larson on the popular children’s video Away We Go!, has scored numerous documentaries, and was music director, music producer and theme song composer for several television specials with Dave Attell, as well as for the Comedy Central series Strangers with Candy, Martha Stewart’s Home for the Holidays and the Sundance channel’s Festival Dailies.\n\nBob also wrote and produced music for Michael Moore’s television series TV Nation and The Awful Truth, as well as for the award winning films, Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 911 and Capitalism: A Love Story.

He was the house drummer on NBC’s 30 Rock.\n\nBob co-authored The Jerky Boys: The Book and Why Didn’t I Think of That?, and co-wrote AOL’s first online interactive game for kids, The Quest.\n\nRecently, Bobby has been composing music for HBO’s Last week tonight with John Oliver, he composed and produced the score for the PBS documentary series Women, War, and Peace, he was the composer and music supervisor on the C word narrated by Morgan Freeman, and IN 2015, Bob made his Broadway debut producing the incidental music for Larry David’s A fish in the dark.

Laurie joins Brady on the album’s duet “Soft Things,” a sweet tune about all the things kids find comforting.\n\nA special “Let’s Move” edition of his tune “Jump Up” was included on the 2013 album Songs for a Healthier America, a compilation of songs produced by Hip Hop Public Health for former First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move campaign.

Brady loves everyone involved in Laurie’s organization and feels so lucky to be part of the band. There’s nothing like coming off stage with his bandmates after a great show and meeting Laurie Berkner Band fans: a wonderful community of stomping dinosaurs, moonbeams, and bumblebees!\n\nHe lives on the North Fork of Long Island with his wife, Bridget, and two children Gus and Daisy and his new puppy Georgie Girl. He loves discovering new music, traveling, cooking for his family, playing with his puppy and exercising – all at the same time!"
