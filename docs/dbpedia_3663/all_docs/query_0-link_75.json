As an organization focused on addressing the most critical needs of our community and dedicated to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion for all, we know that we must begin to address how to undo racism and become “anti-racists” at an individual, organizational, and societal level. As we embark on this journey together, we know that we have much work to do.\n\nResources for Anti-Racism, Equality, Justice, and Cultural Competence\n\nREADINGS\n\nAlexander, Michelle (2010).
