Compared to the likes of David Lynch, Larry Clark, Harmony Korine and John Cassavetes, the film dares the audience to watch it, confronting issues with kids and teenagers often sugar-coated by Hollywood. The movie tackles hard-hitting subjects like self mutilation by teen girls, bullying, rape, bulimia (showcasing the actual damage it does to a girl's body) and, of course, the murder.",

        "text": "A lot of people seem to hate this film before it even begins, it is based off Alyssa Bustamante's murder of Elizabeth Olten and many assume it's going to be very exploitative of that. However this is Letterboxd not Tumblr so basically fuck those people I watch movies first with a clear mind before judging. This is a dark, disturbing and confronting yet almost poetic film. It was made for 300 dollars and shot in 4 days yet it achieves its goal with almost a kind of haunting beauty to it. The actresses were great and the direction was solid. My only criticism is not really criticizing but I just found it strange that it seemed to end like 50…\n\nAlso known as \"Alyssa: Portrait of a Teen Killer\", \"My Name is 'A' by Anonymous\" is \"based\" on the story of a 9-year old girl, Elizabeth Olten, whose throat was slit in 2009 by a neighbor.\n\nIf you know nothing about the original story, like me, then watching this movie to find out anything about it will get you nowhere. Although this movie depicts some of the events from that true-life news, the \"story\" here is more about four young women who are struggling in life; as an example, one of the girls is repeatedly raped by her father.\n\nBut even then it really isn't about what these girls are going through. Instead, it's got more of a mumblecore mundane-slice-of-life…\n\nI knew nothing of this film, nor the murder it preludes into. This was left on the free table at the end of the night for Geekswap oh so long ago, and tonight I decided on a backyard budget back to back starting with it, then \"Rock Opera.\"\n\nThat aside, \"My Name is 'A' by Anonymous\" is a artistic vision of teen angst and the mind of a young person on the verge of murder. It is shown in a very quiet thoughtful set of mostly short seemingly random scenes. As these scenes play out you are helpless to watch how the set of girls live out their meager existence, some in horrible ways until you find out as the…\n\n“Do you really think it’s possible for me to kill a child?”\n\nYou know someone is a piece of shit when, after watching a news report of a nine year old girl being brutal murdered, they decide to make a film about the young girl’s killer in an attempt to humanise them and gather sympathy. Well, to the director of this godawful piece of garbage, Shane Ryan, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, f**k you. This is, to put it bluntly, a total piece of shit. Anyone who cares to read my reviews here on Letterboxd knows that, although I can sometimes be quite negative, it’s never to the degree that I call a film a ‘piece of shit.’…\n\nThe subject matter of Shane Ryan’s 2012 thriller ‘My Name Is A’ By Anonymous could be coined as very disturbing. You could read review after review and everyone will say that the sealing term for the film is chilling. Straight off the bat you realize that what you are watching is not going to be traditionally sane. It is to be noted that this is not your typical horror film, by any means. This film is not fun nor entertaining. It is thought provokingly sad and somewhat brilliant. So what does that mean?\n\nLoosely based on a true event, ‘My Name Is A’ By Anonymous is a tragic low-budget film that descends into a hard watch. On October 21, 2009,…"
