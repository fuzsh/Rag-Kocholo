Director Robert Logevall cut a special trailer of the film for Monocle, which we're delighted to present here. Logevall says: \"When I read the story, I couldn't get it out my head. But then thought, how can you adapt Murakami? It's so incredible what he can say in a sentence. And, the movie is very fluid. It's more like a sketch. I hope it's a little sketch of a Murakami short story...\""
