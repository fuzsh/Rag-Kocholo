Kengo's mother (Joan Chen) has always told him that he is the son of God, but now he wants to know if this is the truth. Kengo is heavily involved with Sandra (Sonja Kinski), which takes most of his time. But then he sees a deformed man he suspects may be his father. Desperate for answers, Kengo begins following the man.",
