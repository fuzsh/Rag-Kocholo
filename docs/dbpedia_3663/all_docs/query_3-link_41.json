        "text": "Several sources have multiple means for citation, especially those that appear in varied formats: films, DVDs, television shows, music, published and unpublished interviews, interviews over e-mail, published and unpublished conference proceedings. The following section discusses these sorts of citations as well as others not covered in the print, periodical, and electronic sources sections.\n\nUse the following format for all sources:\n\nAn Interview\n\nInterviews typically fall into two categories: print or broadcast published and unpublished (personal) interviews, although interviews may also appear in other, similar formats such as in e-mail format or as a Web document.\n\nPersonal Interviews\n\nPersonal interviews refer to those interviews that you conduct yourself. List the interview by the name of the interviewee. Include the descriptor Personal interview and the date of the interview.\n\nSmith, Jane. Personal interview. 19 May 2014.\n\nPublished Interviews (Print or Broadcast)\n\nList the interview by the full name of the interviewee. If the name of the interview is part of a larger work like a book, a television program, or a film series, place the title of the interview in quotation marks and place the title of the larger work in italics. If the interview appears as an independent title, italicize it. For books, include the author or editor name after the book title.\n\nNote: If the interview from which you quote does not feature a title, add the descriptor, Interview by (unformatted) after the interviewee’s name and before the interviewer’s name.\n\nGaitskill, Mary. Interview with Charles Bock. Mississippi Review, vol. 27, no. 3, 1999, pp. 129-50.\n\nAmis, Kingsley. “Mimic and Moralist.” Interviews with Britain’s Angry Young Men, By Dale Salwak, Borgo P, 1984.\n\nOnline-only Published Interviews\n\nList the interview by the name of the interviewee. If the interview has a title, place it in quotation marks. Cite the remainder of the entry as you would other exclusive web content. Place the name of the website in italics, give the publisher name (or sponsor), the publication date, and the URL.\n\nNote: If the interview from which you quote does not feature a title, add the descriptor Interview by (unformatted) after the interviewee’s name and before the interviewer’s name.\n\nZinkievich, Craig. Interview by Gareth Von Kallenbach. Skewed & Reviewed, 27 Apr. 2009, www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/1056940-skewed-%2526-reviewed-interviews-craig. Accessed 15 May 2009.\n\nSpeeches, Lectures, or Other Oral Presentations (including Conference Presentations)\n\nStart with speaker’s name. Then, give the title of the speech (if any) in quotation marks. Follow with the title of the particular conference or meeting and then the name of the organization. Name the venue and its city (if the name of the city is not listed in the venue’s name). Use the descriptor that appropriately expresses the type of presentation (e.g., Address, Lecture, Reading, Keynote Speech, Guest Lecture, Conference Presentation).\n\nStein, Bob. “Reading and Writing in the Digital Era.” Discovering Digital Dimensions, Computers and Writing Conference, 23 May 2003, Union Club Hotel, West Lafayette, IN. Keynote Address.\n\nPanel Discussions and Question-and-Answer Sessions\n\nThe MLA Handbook makes a distinction between the formal, rehearsed portion of a presentation and the informal discussion that often occurs after. To format an entry for a panel discussion or question-and-answer session, treat the panel members or speakers as authors by listing them first. If these people are formally listed as panelists, indicate this by following their names with a comma and the title \"panelist(s).\" Follow with the title of the discussion, or, if there is no title, a simple description. In the latter case, don't capitalize the description. Follow this with the title of the conference or event. End with the date and the location.\n\nBavis, Jim and Stein, Tammi, panelists. Panel discussion. Dawn or Doom Conference, 4 Nov. 2018, Stewart Hall, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.\n\nTreat recorded discussions as instances of the appropriate medium (e.g., if you want to cite a recording of a panel discussion hosted on YouTube, cite it the same way you would cite an ordinary online video).\n\nPublished Conference Proceedings\n\nCite published conference proceedings like a book. If the date and location of the conference are not part of the published title, add this information after the published proceedings title.\n\nLast Name, First Name, editor. Conference Title, Conference Date and Location, Publisher, Date of Publication.\n\nTo cite a presentation from published conference proceedings, begin with the presenter’s name. Place the name of the presentation in quotation marks. Follow with publication information for the conference proceedings.\n\nLast Name, First Name. “Conference Paper Title.” Conference Title that Includes Conference Date and Location, edited by Conference Editor(s), Publisher, Date of Publication.\n\nA Painting, Sculpture, or Photograph\n\nProvide the artist's name, the title of the artwork in italics, and the date of composition. Finally, provide the name of the institution that houses the artwork followed by the location of the institution (if the location is not listed in the name of the institution, e.g. The Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nGoya, Francisco. The Family of Charles IV. 1800, Museo del Prado, Madrid.\n\nIf the medium and/or materials (e.g., oil on canvas) are important to the reference, you can include this information at the end of the entry. However, it is not required.\n\nFor photographic reproductions of artwork (e.g. images of artwork in a book), treat the book or website as a container. Remember that for a second container, the title is listed first, before the contributors. Cite the bibliographic information as above followed by the information for the source in which the photograph appears, including page or reference numbers (plate, figure, etc.).\n\nIf you viewed the artwork on the museum's website, treat the name of the website as the container and include the website's publisher and the URL at the end of the citation. Omit publisher information if it is the same as the name of the website. Note the period after the date below, rather than the comma: this is because the date refers to the painting's original creation, rather than to its publication on the website. Thus, MLA format considers it an \"optional element.\"\n\nA Song or Album\n\nMusic can be cited multiple ways. Mainly, this depends on the container that you accessed the music from. Generally, citations begin with the artist name. They might also be listed by composers or performers. Otherwise, list composer and performer information after the album title. Put individual song titles in quotation marks. Album names are italicized. Provide the name of the recording manufacturer followed by the publication date.\n\nIf information such as record label or name of album is unavailable from your source, do not list that information.\n\nSpotify\n\nMorris, Rae. “Skin.” Cold, Atlantic Records, 2014. Spotify, open.spotify.com/track/0OPES3Tw5r86O6fudK8gxi.\n\nOnline Album\n\nBeyoncé. “Pray You Catch Me.” Lemonade, Parkwood Entertainment, 2016, www.beyonce.com/album/lemonade-visual-album/.\n\nCD\n\nNirvana. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Nevermind, Geffen, 1991.\n\nFilms or Movies\n\nList films by their title. Include the name of the director, the film studio or distributor, and the release year. If relevant, list performer names after the director's name.\n\nSpeed Racer. Directed by Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski, performances by Emile Hirsch, Nicholas Elia, Susan Sarandon, Ariel Winter, and John Goodman, Warner Brothers, 2008.\n\nTo emphasize specific performers or directors, begin the citation with the name of the desired performer or director, followed by the appropriate title for that person.\n\nLucas, George, director. Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Twentieth Century Fox, 1977.\n\nTelevision Shows\n\nRecorded Television Episodes\n\nCite recorded television episodes like films (see above). Begin with the episode name in quotation marks. Follow with the series name in italics. When the title of the collection of recordings is different than the original series (e.g., the show Friends is in DVD release under the title Friends: The Complete Sixth Season), list the title that would help researchers to locate the recording. Give the distributor name followed by the date of distribution.\n\n\"The One Where Chandler Can't Cry.\" Friends: The Complete Sixth Season, written by Andrew Reich and Ted Cohen, directed by Kevin Bright, Warner Brothers, 2004.\n\nBroadcast TV or Radio Program\n\nBegin with the title of the episode in quotation marks. Provide the name of the series or program in italics. Also include the network name, call letters of the station followed by the date of broadcast and city.\n\n\"The Blessing Way.\" The X-Files. Fox, WXIA, Atlanta, 19 Jul. 1998.\n\nNetflix, Hulu, Google Play\n\nGenerally, when citing a specific episode, follow the format below.\n\n“94 Meetings.” Parks and Recreation, season 2, episode 21, NBC, 29 Apr. 2010. Netflix, www.netflix.com/watch/70152031.\n\nAn Entire TV Series\n\nWhen citing the entire series of a TV show, use the following format.\n\nDaniels, Greg and Michael Schur, creators. Parks and Recreation. Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, 2015.\n\nA Specific Performance or Aspect of a TV Show\n\nIf you want to emphasize a particular aspect of the show, include that particular information. For instance, if you are writing about a specific character during a certain episode, include the performer’s name as well as the creator’s.\n\n“94 Meetings.” Parks and Recreation, created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, performance by Amy Poehler, season 2, episode 21, Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, 2010.\n\nIf you wish to emphasize a particular character throughout the show’s run time, follow this format.\n\nPoehler, Amy, performer. Parks and Recreation. Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, 2009-2015.\n\nPodcasts\n\nBegin with the title of the episode in quotation marks. Provide the name of the series in italics. Then follow with MLA format per usual.\n\n“Best of Not My Job Musicians.” Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me! from NPR, 4 June 2016, www.npr.org/podcasts/344098539/wait-wait-don-t-tell-me.\n\nSpoken-Word Albums such as Comedy Albums\n\nTreat spoken-word albums the same as musical albums.\n\nHedberg, Mitch. Strategic Grill Locations. Comedy Central, 2003.\n\nDigital Files (PDFs, MP3s, JPEGs)\n\nDetermine the type of work to cite (e.g., article, image, sound recording) and cite appropriately. End the entry with the name of the digital format (e.g., PDF, JPEG file, Microsoft Word file, MP3). If the work does not follow traditional parameters for citation, give the author’s name, the name of the work, the date of creation, and the location.\n\nBeethoven, Ludwig van. Moonlight Sonata. Crownstar, 2006.\n\nSmith, George. “Pax Americana: Strife in a Time of Peace.” 2005.
