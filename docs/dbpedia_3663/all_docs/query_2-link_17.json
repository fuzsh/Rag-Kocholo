        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The Jewish Film Institute has announced six projects that will receive a total of $80,000 in JFI Completion Grants, including the latest film from Oscar-shortlisted director and two-time Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner Ondi Timoner.\n\nTimoner’s All God’s Children tells the story of a rabbi and a protestant minister in New York who unite their congregations to “combat the rising tension in their Brooklyn communities.” The rabbi, Rachel Timoner, is Ondi Timoner’s sister.\n\nThe nonprofit JFI, which “champions bold films and filmmakers that expand and evolve the Jewish story for audiences everywhere,” has distributed more $400,000 in grants to filmmakers since 2020. Along with Timoner’s project, newly announced recipients include Amber Fares’ Coexistence, My Ass!, a documentary that follows Israeli comedian Noam Shuster Eliassi “as she struggles to create a one-woman comedy show called Coexistence, My Ass! about racism, sexism, war, peace and… her ass.” See below for the full list of 2024 grantees.\n\n“We are proud of this strong new slate which features intimate human stories of Israelis and Palestinians, African Americans, Jewish Americans, and religious and secular communities working towards co-existence and understanding against the backdrop of an extremely polarized world,” JFI’s Executive Director Lexi Leban and Marcia Jarmel, JFI’s Director of Filmmaker Services, said in a joint statement. “We believe this slate of films has the powerful ability to deepen empathy and understanding, articulate complexities, and open hearts and minds. At a challenging time for the distribution of independent Jewish films, JFI remains committed to providing a continuum of support throughout a film’s life-cycle.”\n\nAmong past projects that earned JFI completion grants are A Crime on the Bayou, directed by Nancy Buirski; My Name Is Andrea, directed by Pratibha Parmar; A Photographic Memory, by director Elizabeth Rachel Seed, and Sabbath Queen, directed by Sandi DuBowski.\n\nSabbath Queen served as the closing night film on Sunday at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, a program of the Jewish Film Institute.\n\n“The JFI Completion Grant for Sabbath Queen came at a critical time during our rough cut when we needed to support our extensive editing team to take the film to completion. This was a 21-year work with an enormous amount of material – 1,800 hours plus 1,100 hours of archival! – so I was grateful for as much resource as possible,” said DuBowski. “JFI is at the forefront of rebuilding the philanthropy necessary for the field of us storytellers to translate the Jewish experience to the world during these challenging and sensitive times. JFI is making it possible for our diverse voices and stories—in all their complexity, joy, pain, and critique—to be urgently heard. And JFI being both funder and presenter is crucial as works need to get made and seen. I had a Bay Area Premiere of my first feature Trembling Before G-d in 2001 at SFJFF and now, 23 years later, I’m returning to the Festival with Sabbath Queen as Closing Night.”\n\nThe winning projects for 2024 were selected from among 12 finalists, narrowed from a pool of 92 applicants. The 2024 jury included Lisa Fruchtman, Academy Award-winning editor and documentarian; Meredith Lavitt, founder of Swirl Production and veteran executive of the Sundance Institute, and Su Kim, an Emmy- and two-time Peabody Award-winning producer.\n\n“As jurors, we are honored and aware of our privileged position,” Fruchtman, Lavitt, and Kim noted. “As we journeyed through these films, we found beautiful visions, opening windows into the heart of our universal shared humanity. Stories that connect us to the lives of others vividly with intimacy and respect. We considered many questions about nuanced and surprising Jewish identities, histories, and culture. We were impressed by the quality and innovation of all these superbly crafted films.”\n\nThe 2024 JFI Completion Grants are made possible through support of the Albert & Judith Goldberg Foundation, Sandee Blechman and Steven Goldberg, Michelle Marcus, the Righteous Persons Foundation, the Nancy P. & Richard K. Robbins Family Foundation, the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation, and Sheri Cohen and Charles Green.\n\nThese are the 2024 JFI Completion Grant winners:\n\nAll God’s Children\n\nOndi Timoner, United States, Documentary Feature\n\nProduced by David Turner\n\nWinner, Harvey Goldberg Memorial Award for a film that impacts our understanding of Jewish history, life, and culture.\n\nTo combat the rising tension in their Brooklyn communities, a Rabbi and a Reverend team up to unite their congregations.
