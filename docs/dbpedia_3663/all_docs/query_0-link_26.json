        "text": "This fits with the theme of a previous post. Perhaps I should have waited and composed yet one more long, drawn-out faux Think Post drawing the two experiences together. Probably good that I didn’t.\n\nGattaca, a movie released in 1997 and starring Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, Uma Thurman among others (Gore Vidal?) is a futuristic piece about human control over creation and reality. I’d never heard of it before last week. You might have seen it in a biology class somewhere along the way – a brief search about reactions to the film tells me that this is the case for many.\n\nIt begins, tellingly, with a verse from Ecclesiastes:\n\nConsider God’s handiwork: who can straighten what He hath made crooked?’\n\nSet up:\n\nAt this indeterminate point in history, most human beings are conceived in petri dishes via selection of their most desirable traits. This has become the “natural” way to conceive.\n\nOf course, others slip through. Our central character, played by Ethan Hawke, is one of those, called an “In-Valid,” conceived by his parents really naturally.\n\nAs an In-Valid, he would naturally be consigned to the lowest rungs of society, but he’s determined to reach the stars.\n\nI’m not going to summarize the rest of the plot here – that’s not my interest.\n\nNo, my brief mention of this film is all about the assumption running through it that there is not something quite right about this world, that it’s soulless and cold, and that to bring human beings into the world without human manipulation is an act that’s connected to God. And that there is actually a God.\n\nWhen Vincent’s mother gives birth to him, she’s clutching a rosary in her hand.\n\nAnd when he’s forced to reveal is origins to Uma Thurman, she asks him, for clarification, quite simply,\n\nYou’re a God-child?\n\nThe storylines of Vincent and the Jude Law character, Jerome, whose identity he elaborately assumes in order to reach his dream of going to space, play out the theme of the destructive nature of trying to play the Creator.\n\nVincent combats prejudice – that is, literally – pre-judging, and assumptions about who he is because of his identity. He rises despite the conviction that genetics make the man. And he’s convinced, in a way that could even be taken as a spiritual metaphor – that he wasn’t made for this world. He can’t help looking up. There are many daily launches of spacecraft, and, as the Uma Thurman character observes, he’s the only person around who stops to watch each one.\n\nYou’re a God-child?\n\nThe fate of Jerome is disturbing, but upon reflection, I could see how it expresses the broader theme. I won’t spoil it, but while tragic, it also makes perfect sense, given the society in which Jerome was born (as a Valid) and has lived – he, as a now imperfect thing, is worth less than nothing.\n\nIt’s not brilliant, but it’s certainly a thoughtful film with, I’ll add, a really interesting aesthetic – a mix of typical cold futurism with a bit of retro vintage flair.\n\nYou’re a God-child?"
