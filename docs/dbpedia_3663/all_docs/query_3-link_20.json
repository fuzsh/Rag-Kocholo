        "text": "How do you decide film credits order? Do you always have to put the director first? Do you list in order of celebrity? Pull names from a hat?\n\nThis is a common and complicated question because, frankly, there’s no real answer. There are industry “traditions” about credit roll order, but they’re fluid. There are occasional union and guild requirements on billing as well.\n\nLuckily, we're breaking down the standard film credits order hierarchies, some helpful tricks, and our “Feature and Short Film Credits Template”.\n\nFILM CREDITS 1.0\n\nBucket your film credits early\n\nKnowing how to do film credits is a lot like owning a file cabinet. You can have all the information, but unless you carefully organize it, you won't be able to pull names when you order your movie credits.\n\nWhether you're using a film credits template or sticky notes, bucket your contacts into lists that you access at a glance. \"Above The Line,\" \"Talent,\" \"Executive Producers,\" whichever labels you prefer, make sure your extensive list of names are organized.\n\nMake sure you spell your contacts right the first time.\n\n​As you lay out movie credits, this mistake can take hours to fix.\n\nUnless you're using StudioBinder, which automatically applies contact changes across your call sheets, schedules, and reports.\n\nStudioBinder helps you drag contacts into custom lists\n\nThis is super helpful for a lot of different reasons, so don't limit yourself.\n\nFILM CREDITS 2.0\n\nOpening movie credits order\n\nTypical opening credits are fairly straightforward, especially if your film is signatory to guilds and unions that specify billing order.\n\nThe fundamental structure of opening credits in film\n\nThe credit roll order typically starts with the major companies involved.\n\nThen go to the “top billing,” those you are contractually obligated to credit before anyone else (usually the stars).\n\nAfter that, the opening credits proceed through a list of the most important contributors to the film, starting from the least important, ending with the most important.\n\nFor example, here are the opening credits from Back To The Future:\n\nBack to The Future - O​​​​pening title sequence\n\nCOMMON OPENING FILM CREDITS ORDER\n\nThe most common movie opening credits order is:\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANY presents (distributor)\n\na PRODUCTION COMPANY production (producer)\n\na FILMMAKER film\n\nFilm Title\n\nLead Cast\n\nSupporting Cast\n\nCasting Director\n\nMusic Composer\n\nCostume Designer\n\nAssociate Producers\n\nEditors\n\nProduction Designer\n\nDirector of Photography\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nProducer\n\nWriters\n\nDirector\n\nFILM CREDITS 3.0\n\nCredit roll order for people with multiple positions\n\nIf you have an above-the-line individual on your team who performed multiple roles (such as a writer/director), don’t list the person twice. Merge the credits into one, and place by the credit roll order of the more “important” position.\n\nFor example, a writer/director would be credited as such in the “Director” slot of the opening credits lineup (i.e. scrub to 2:48 in A Scanner Darkly video below).\n\n​A Sc​​​​anner Darkly - Intro\n\nFILM CREDITS 4.0\n\nGenre affects the credit order\n\nIt can be a challenge to determine “importance” in opening film credits order. In some cases, a particular credit might be considered more important because of the type of film.\n\nFor example, a choreographer might get an opening credit in a dance film with lots of musical numbers, or a supervising animator in an animated film.\n\n5.0 CLosinG CREDITS order in film\n\nEnd credits order: The Wild West of motion pictures billing\n\nLet’s face it. Most people don’t bother to sit through the end credits past the first few names.\n\nYou could almost do anything here and get away with it...\n\nBut the purpose of film credits is not to entertain an audience. It’s to publicly acknowledge the people who contributed to your cinematic work.\n\nWhile there is technically not a “wrong way,” certain traditions have evolved around the closing credits order in which this gratitude is expressed.\n\nCLOSING CREDITS ORDER: ABOVE-THE-LINE (ATL)\n\nEnd credits start with above-the-line (ATL) individuals first, followed by certain key production personnel.\n\nThese are often presented as standalone cards. Here’s a common ending credits order for above-the-line and key personnel:\n\nDirector\n\nWriters\n\nProducer\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nLead Cast\n\nSupporting Cast\n\nDirector of Photography\n\nProduction Designer\n\nEditor\n\nAssociate Producers\n\nCostume Designer\n\nMusic Composer\n\nCasting Director\n\nAs an example of closing credits, check out the ending credits for Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nNote: Though it is becoming more common to see some of these credits repeated in both the opening and closing of a film, it’s not necessary (unless by contract).\n\n​Star Trek Into Darkness - End Credits\n\nCLOSING CREDITS ORDER: THE END CREDITS CRAWL\n\nThe end credits crawl typically begins where the individual end credit title cards leave off. Often, the first credits that appear in the crawl are production department personnel, such as the Unit Production Manager.\n\nThe entire cast is often listed next.\n\nThen, departments, such as Camera, G&E, Hair/Makeup, Wardrobe, Art Department, etc. Departmental lists begin with the department head, followed by the rest of the department, with departmental assistants listed last.\n\nAfter production departments come post production departments and personnel:\n\nEditorial\n\nVisual Effects\n\nColorist\n\nEtc.\n\nTo break down the exact closing film credits order that you should follow, look below:\n\nUnit Production Manager\n\nFirst Assistant Director\n\nSecond Assistant Director\n\nFull Cast/Character List (including lead and supporting cast that have already been credited separately)\n\nStunt Department\n\nProduction Departments (often listed as “Crew”)\n\nProduction Personnel\n\nProduction Supervisor\n\nProduction Coordinator\n\nArt Department\n\nCamera\n\nGrip\n\nElectric\n\nSound\n\nWardrobe\n\nHair/Makeup\n\nSet Operations\n\nTransportation\n\nSpecial Effects\n\nEtc.\n\nPost-Production Departments\n\nEditorial\n\nVisual Effects\n\nColorist\n\nEtc.\n\nSong Credits\n\nCaterer\n\nTitle Design\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nLogos\n\nGuild logos (SAG, DGA, PGA, etc.)\n\nCamera, Lenses and Equipment Makers (RED, Adobe, etc.)\n\nLocations\n\nShooting Locations (sometimes required by filming permit)\n\nLocation of Final Sound Mix (“Recorded at…”)\n\nCopyright\n\nDisclaimer\n\nFILM CREDITS 6.0\n\nWhen do I use logos in the credits?\n\nSometimes companies or guilds require that you show their logo in the end credits where their equipment or members were used.\n\nRemember to check if these are required by your contracts, and note them in your film crew database. If they are not required it’s possible that you’re actually not allowed to include the logos in your end credits.\n\nTake a look at this example from Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa:\n\n​Madagascar - End Credits\n\nFree downloadable bonus\n\nDownload FREE Film Credits Order Template\n\nAfter learning about proper film credit ordering and hierarchy, it's time to apply this to your own video!
