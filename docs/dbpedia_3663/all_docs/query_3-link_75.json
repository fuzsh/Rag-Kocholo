If not, any suggestions?\n\nIN ISRAEL the @ symbol is often referred to as \"strudel\". Computer books often refer to @ as the \"at sign\". Anyone who ever made or cut a strudel would agree th@ \"strudel\" is @ least as appropri@e a name as \"at sign\".\n\nRoy Sage (roysage@msn.com). ,\n\nIN DUTCH it is called apestaart , which means \"monkey's tail\". Because it looks like a monkey with his tail curled over him.\n\nMartin Southwold (martinso@worldonline.nl). ,\n\nSURELY it's an \"ampersat\"?\n\nNyk Tarr, Rochdale, Lancs.\n\nIN ENGLISH, the symbol is boringly known as \"commercial at\", but other languages offer more imaginative names. In Swedish, it is called snabel-a , (\"a\" with an elephant's trunk), or kanelbulle , the Swedish equivalent of the Chelsea bun. In German it is called Klammerraffe , (a clinging monkey) - presumably hanging from a tree by one arm.\n\nDr Gunnel Clark, Wotton-under-Edge, Glos.\n\nIN GREEK, it's called a little duck and in Russian a dog. Since animals seem to predominate, could I suggest the British term should be a mad cow rampant?\n\n(Professor) Richard Macrory, Tackley, Oxford.\n\nIT IS called an \"atmark\". Its use in internet addresses has led to the production of a computer intended for accessing the World Wide Web called the Atmark computer.\n\nKit Barritt (Kit.Barritt@ccmail.eu.sony.co.jp) ,\n\nTHE OFFICIAL name is the \"at\" sign, from the same school of typographer's gobbledegook which gave us \"octothorpe\" (the #). This naming predates the use of @ by electronic mail systems the world over, and sadly produces many ambiguities when mail addresses are dictated over the phone. If pilots and the police can have special terminologies for clear communication, then I would like to propose an easy, relevant and linguistically distinguishable subtitute for the confusing 'at' naming. The name for @ should be \"nerd\". This makes my email address, read over the phone, into \"cassidys nerd cix dot compulink dot co dot uck\".\n\nSteve Cassidy (normally in London EC2 but presently bored in Stuttgart) ,\n\nIN BRAZIL the symbol is known as arroba , which is also an old measure of 15 kilos.\n\nMichael Wrigley, Campinas, Brazil.\n\nIN ITALIAN the symbol is known as a chiocciola (snail).\n\nGeoffrey Allen, Pavia, Italy.\n\nIN FINLAND it's known as a mouse's tail.\n\nStephen Ryan, Dublin (sryan@dit.ie)\n\nI heard someone on Radio 4 refer to it as an \"e-snail\" which I thought was nice.\n\nChris Winchester, London\n\nIn Hungary, the @ symbol is called \"kukatsz\", which means little worm.\n\nChris Dalton, Budapest, Hungary\n\nThe Norwegian call the @ \"kroellalfa\",meaning curled a.\n\nS William Ingebrigtsen, Bergen, Norway\n\nIn Italian we call it \"chiocciolina\", which means \"small snail\". \"Chiocciola\", as Geoffrey from Pavia suggests above, is much less used.\n\nLuca De Piano, Milan, Italy\n\nI've always understood that @ originally meant \"account\" and was regularly used in banking. I seem to remember that it appeared on cheques at one time. It seems a more likely explanation than \"at\". After all, why would anyone want to abbreviate a two letter word?\n\nKeith Mills, Alne, York UK\n\n@ abbreviates more than just two letters. I remember it on signs in shop windows when I was a child in the early 60s e.g. Cabbages @ 3d, and on similarly on bills. It saves you writing 'at' and 'each'.\n\nAnne Lane, Greenwich\n\nIn Czech, it is called \"zavinac\" which means a rolled pickled herring.\n\nMojmir Pribina, Velka, Moravia\n\nI have heard it called \"petit escargot\" (\"little snail\") in France.\n\nKatherine Ellis, London\n\nI've always known it to be called the \"short at\".\n\nHenry Wolny, London\n\nThe French have a word for it: arobasse. I can't find it in the dictionary but it does seem to have gained widespread acceptance. Quite an achievement in a country where hardly anyone knows (or cares about) the word for \"ampersand\".\n\nRudiger Scheister, Paris\n\nIn Spain, we call it \"arroba\", which also is a measurement of weight, but I can't see the conection. ( 1 arroba = 15 kilos )\n\nMaria, Toledo, Spain\n\nWe Catalans call the symbol \"arrova\" from \"rova\" meaning 1/4 (25%), originally a weight measure, as in Spanish. Looking at most email addresses (my own, for instance, itÂ´s certainly 1 out of 4 items!) Relationship with weight? Not sure... but I personally find it heavy going to find the right key to type it.\n\nJoan Diez, Amposta, Catalonia\n\nHow about calling it \"letter a with a curly tail\"? Do I win a fiver?\n\nCharlie Peterson, York\n\nAt\n\nDavid Burnfield, Sydney, Australia\n\nMost people from Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries answered that the name given to @ is \"arroba\" (and similars, like \"arova\"), the same name of a old weight measure unit. However, many people seem to ignore the history of this incidental coincidence: when the first typewriters started to be exported abroad US and UK, the key to @ had to be given a name. Since the @ was no known or used for anything on those countries, and since the current weight measure unit, the \"arroba\" (approximately 14 kilos) had by the time no symbol related to it, the Typewriter manufacturers and importers decided to call it arroba. Thus, for this simple and arbitrary decision, people from many countries started to call @ \"arroba\".\n\nRodrigo Rey, Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nIn Finland, apparently, it is called miukumauku because it looks like a sleeping cat.\n\nAndrew, Norwich UK\n\nIn my country we call it the \"cha-cha\". Historically this dates back to when dancers used to put character \"a\" on their back when dancing in competitions. To highlight the \"a\" it was put in a circle.\n\nJose Luis, London England\n\nIn POLAND the @ sign is called a \"monkey\"\n\npeter gentle, warsaw poland\n\nIn Denmark we call it \"snabel-a\", snabel meaning the trunk of an elephant\n\nStine Pedersen, Skanderborg Denmark\n\nSmall \"a\" in circle @ Please can any one let me know what this sign called ~ ? my E-mail address is Bigbook2601@yahoo.com thank you.\n\nAb, Chicago U.S.A\n\nIn Jamaica it's known as the block, the swirl depicting the feeling of nausia and dizziness having spent far too much time passing the rizla and herb. Derived from the term 'block-up' or in plain English, stoned.\n\nJosiah Mackintosh, Port Antonio Jamaica\n\nIt's the AT symbol and leave it @ that! :-)\n\nKat, California, USA\n\nIn Russian, the @ symbol is often called \"sabachka\", which means puppy.\n\nGeorgeta Solomitskaya-Lester, Cleveland, USA\n\nA local game show here said that the official name of the at-sign is \"amphora\" taken from the name of a jar they used in the ancient medterranean to measure volume of things they would trade (where the @ symbol was supposedly first used).\n\nTina, Manila, Philippines\n\nPrinters on this side of the pond referred to it as a \"commercial at,\" just as the ampersand was a \"commercial and.\"\n\nHoward Wolff, West Orange, NJ, USA\n\nIn Japan it's called the atomaaku.\n\nMike O'Connell, Sapporo, Japan\n\nIf it wasn't just the \"at\" symbol I'm sure somebody would have told us by now. My favourite from the foreign versions is the Czech one meaning a rolled pickled herring. Perhaps we could latch onto that one and call it a \"rollmop\".\n\nJohn Kemplen, Leighton Buzzard, England, UK\n\nIn American computer science, it is universally referred to as the \"at sign\", or \"at\" when reading out a sequence of characters or an email address. In Chinese, it's called a mouse (shu), confusingly enough.\n\nEthan Bradford, US\n\nI think it would be nice to call it a Titfer. @ = TITFER) As any cockney Londoner will tell you, a Titfer is an \"At\" in Cockney Rhyming Slang. Londoners usually drop their aitches and \"At\" stands for Hat i.e. Hat = Titfer Tat!\n\nLeslie Nicholass, Colchester, England\n\nThe \"~\" (which somebody wanted to know the name of) is known as a tilde.\n\nRod Fielding, Bury, UK\n\nAndrew from Norwich is right: in Finland @-sing is called (colloquially) miuku-mauku, or, alternatively, miumau, which actually referres to the sound that a cat makes (miaow) and @ thus symbolizes the figure of a cat curled up. Officially it is called Ã¤t-merkki (at sign).\n\nMarjut, Helsinki, Finland\n\nI call it a squiggle, because it is! A swirl, wiggle of a pen and scribble all in one word. Maybe someone was twirling their pen in circles whilst thinking what to write!\n\nPaul Coleman, Oxford, UK\n\nI agree with what said before: @ means \"at Â£ each\" and the fact that we have started using in email addresses does not mean that its name as \"commercial at\" should be discarded, but for ease and speed of conversation in everyday exchange of email addresses we perhaps should adopt the grammatically correct version of \"ampersat\" which, from the semantic point of view, means \"instead of (at)\".\n\nRoberta, London london\n\nGrowing up while in grammar school; 1960's; my teacher told us it was an abbreviation for \"at each\" (for)...such as 5@1.00 or 5 for 1.00. Made sense then and still does today!\n\nJay, Atlanta USA\n\n@ is an arobasse in French, and it is in the dictionary.\n\nalan cowling, Nevez France\n\nThe french word is arobase. Some are confusing the sign @ with ampersand which is not correct - ampersand is the & sign\n\nMarilyn, Mauritius\n\nMarilyn is right. I CONFUSED THE @ symbol with the ampersand symbol (&). I suppose the @ symbol is at especially in Email addresses.\n\nKelly, Orlando Florida usa\n\nFirst description of symbol @ is dated century IV, detailing how many \"arroba\" (weight measurement about 25 pounds) of a freight by seaway from Seville to Rome.\n\nVictor, Alsasua, Spain\n\nThere's an awful lot of opinion on this subject floating about, but nobody seems to be citing any references. The best I can find anywhere online is at Wikipedia (but it's Wikipedia so take it with a pinch of salt!). According to whoever wrote the article, it's formal name is \"commercial at\". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%40\n\nRawlyn, UK\n\nOf course the symbol @ has a name ... it is alison taylor.\n\nAlison Taylor, Moultrie, US\n\nIn Hungary we call it \"kukac\" that means in english \"worm\" :)\n\nPeter MÃ¡tÃ©, Budapest Hungary\n\nIt is ASCII Code 64. Common names: at sign, strudel, rare, each, vortex, whorl, intercal, whirlpool, cyclone, snail, ape, cat, rose, cabbage, amphora. It also is used in email addresses. Ray Tomlinson was designing the first email program. It is derived from the latin preposition \"ad\" (at). It has been traced back to the Italian Renaissance in a Roman merchantile document signed by Francesco Lapi on 1536-05-04. In Dutch it is apestaartje (little tail), in German affenschwanz (ape tail). The French name is arobase. In Spain and Portugal it denotes a weight of about 25 pounds called arroba and the Italians call it chiocciola (snail). commercial at. (n.d.). This information is from The Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing. Retrieved April 25, 2008, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/commercial at\n\nTamera, Layton USA\n\nI think the @ symbol means \"at the rate of\" hence 3 pencils @ of 10 cents would be 30 cents. Yes, @ means \"at the rate of\".\n\nJim York, West Monroe, La. USA\n\nThe @ symbol is correctly referred to as an asperand. My nemonic is: ASP erand.\n\nStuart Lawrence, Oxford UK\n\n& Ampersand @ Aspersand\n\nCharon, Manchester England\n\nIn Chinese, we call it a little mouse.\n\nKat Fan, Austin, Texas\n\nNever mind what foreigners call it, to we Brits it's simply 'at', although its use for any other purpose than to punctuate an e-mail address or to indicate per-unit pricing is the mark of laziness or of a foolish desire to seem 'modern'.\n\nPete Wigens, Stroud, Gloucestershire, UK\n\nAn even more perverse use of the symbol is contained in a leaflet published by Stroud District Council, in which we are asked to 'Sign up for free email @lerts'. Aaaaargh!\n\nPete Wigens, Stroud, UK\n\nIt means At.\n\nOnti Chowdary, Bangladesh\n\nJust spoke to someone on the phone in Bosnia. They called it 'a crazy'.\n\nKimberly Rentfro, London\n\nIt's an at mark, which is also used in T-SQL Programming to denote and define parameters and widecard programming. :)\n\nSteve Stephan, Jacksonville, FL, United States of America\n\nI wrote a book about the history of the @ sign (in Dutch). Let me make some improvements. (Source\": from the Dictionary.com). It is derived from the Latin preposition \"ad\" (at). It is not, it has nothing to do with \"ad\". It has been traced back to the Italian Renaissance in a Roman merchantile document signed by Francesco Lapi. But without any real connection, that is to say that there's no prove that the at sign originate from the Italian use.\n\nHans van Keken, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\nIn Bulgarian it's called \"kliomba\", and also \"monkey A\"...the formal usage is \"at\".\n\nAlexander Mateev, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nIn Soviet Russia, @ symbol names YOU!\n\nVladimir Oraschuck, Moscow, Russia\n\nAmpersand is &. By defination @ is the \"at symbol\".\n\nJoe Kennedy, Glover, VT, USA\n\nIn a far province somewhere in the Philippines, it is a symbol of sexual desire from their ancestors. they believe that when they see the \"@\" sign, they need to have sex at once in front of people. It's a sign of great respect for them. One time when a \"katutubo\" (which means native) came in Manila, (a city in the Philippines, he saw a very big billboard with the \"@\" sign, and what the native did is he grabbed a lady crossing the street and took his clothes off and ruthlessly had sex with the lady. The native was shocked that the people didn't appreciate what he had done and instead, knocked him down and locked him behind bars.\n\nCan Tooten Taio, Northwestern Scrida, Vietnam\n\nIn Nahuatl it is referred to as the: \"O\" otztli. In other words, the capital letter \"O\" pregnant. It is possibly due to the visually apparent little \"o\" inside the big \"O\".\n\nWaxaklahun, San Jose, California, US\n\nWell in Greece we refer to it by the name..papaki(pa-pa-kee) which means little duck although snail,vortex,worm are better matches for the symbol in my opinion... and oh yeah.. it means *AT* and st *AREA* =D\n\nChris Vrizas, Athens, Greece\n\nI hate how people are using @ before people's names when addressing them on the internet, because you talk 'to' someone, not 'at' them!\n\nMark, VIRGINIA BEACH USA\n\nIn Romania it's called \"aron\" but it doesn't mean something particulary ^_^\n\nLena Davis, Vaslui, Romania\n\nIn Greek it's called 'papaki' which means little duck. Someone on my blog suggested recently \"alfaki\". I like this word very much, I think it's cute :) It means little alpha.\n\nDora, Cyprus\n\nIt is auction sign which used for rate and email addressing it is separator between user and provider name in email address\n\nraj, Gwalior, India\n\nAlthough I think the Dutch apestaart (monkey's tail) is the best answer, it actually comes from Old English bookkeeping and is short hand for 'AT THE COST OF' the letter a surrounded by the letter c.\n\nChristopher, Liverpool, England\n\nWe use that symbol for our address on the net, don't we? If someone asks you where you will be available or where you live, would you say, 'I live AT xyz'; or 'I live A WITH ELEPHANT'S TRUNK (or whatever is suggested above) xyz'?\n\nGaurang, Ahmedabd India\n\nthe symbol @ literally means 'at the rate'\n\nvyoma, mumbai india\n\nMy grandmother told me that this symbol is actually called and meant \"around\" before it was used by the meaning of \"at each\" which describes the shape of the symbol, it's \"a\", then \"round\" it.\n\nRicky Logan, Sydney Australia\n\nI like capital 2!\n\nRobin, Austin USA\n\nIn Korea, it is called 'golbangi' for the resemblance to a snail. Excerpt from Wikipedia: The (@) amphere sign is known by various names in English, including... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign Personally, I think the 'ampersand' has a much better typographical history and makes more sense.\n\nTimothy Berg, Seoul South Korea\n\nIn Wales w call it the Llanciffgochgochplatricuaticinibaabaa for short. It means a little lambs tail\n\nmick, dublin\n\nAn @ is what you shouldn't be without on Ilkley Moor or you'll get all eaten by worms.\n\nSteve, Bristle Currently in Denmark\n\nIn US it's usage is archaic, means or meant \"at\" used in sales notation to speed up a notation that refer to pricing example 3 @ 2 for $1. Three items priced at 2 for 1 dollar.\n\nAvery, Blythe US\n\nIn my country the name for @ is similar to The Norwegian name \"kroellalfa\",meaning curled a. In romanian we say \"a rond\" which can be translated \"round a\".\n\nIulian, Constanta Romania\n\nI calls it \"Anarchy\"\n\nPulaywit Madingus, Philadelphia USA\n\nit's the \"at\" symbol\n\nBen, Mandurah Australia\n\nSince I was a small child I have called it \"antricat\" because it ended in \"at\" as ampersand ended in \"and\". I was always going to send it to Websters but never did.\n\nMary Thornton, Vancouver, Washington USA\n\nIn France, it's called AROBASE http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arobase\n\nstephanie durand, alphinton Australia\n\nWhat can I say? Israel's \"strudel \" usage is too wonderful. Most people see a lowercase 'a' with most of a circle around it...my people see a slice of European pastry!\n\nJane, Columbia SC\n\nIn Polish it is \"maÅpa\" = monkey. Most things you say in Polish are funny, and that is no exception, when you say: \"My email is Paul monkey gmail dot com\".\n\nMaks, Warsaw Poland\n\nIn Romania : arond (@)\n\nSilvia,\n\n@ Is a contraction symbol of the words: At Cost.\n\nHarold Sperber, Hypoluxo United States\n\nIn Armenia we call it \"Snik\" it comes from Russian \"Sabachka\". Thank you all for your information.\n\nLily, Yerevan, Armenia\n\nIn Russia it also calls \"sobaka\" (\"dog\") as a \"sobachka\" (not \"puppy\" but \"little dog\"). But all the times I've heard all say \"dog\".\n\nArtyom Scherbakov, Moscow oblast, Istra district, Dedovsk Russia\n\nSome years ago I coined the word \"epinota\" as a name for the @ sign, from the Greek epi (at) and the Latin nota (sign). Yes, I know that's mixing two root languages, but then we drive around in automobiles and not ipsomobiles.\n\nImmanuel Burton, London, UK\n\nI like \"epinota\". I think this should become a universal name for @ sign. In Armenian it is called \"Sh-neek\" which means a little dog; just a translation of Russian \"Sobachka\".\n\nLeann, LA USA\n\nAdd your answer"
