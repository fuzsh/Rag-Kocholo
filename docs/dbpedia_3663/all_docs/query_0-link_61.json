        "text": "The All God's Children-sponsored \"You Are Beautiful\" conference June 9 was well attended, according to AGC executive director Sonya Humphries. Despite the heavy rains and flooding, more than 100 women were pampered, given clothing and makeup and enjoyed music, games and refreshments at the Semmes Community Center on Moffett Road.\n\nAmong those treated to new hairdos by Boondocks Salon in Semmes were Tonya Polk; her daughter-in-law, Kayla Purcell; and her daughter, Sara Purcell. Doing the haircutting and blow-drying were stylists Alisha Myers, Carrie Sellers, Norma Collins and Boondocks owner Kathy Backlin, who said it is a joy each year to attend the event and \"make women beautiful\" because \"We are blessed, and we want to pass along that blessing to others.\"\n\nCiCi's Pizza general manager and assistant manager, Nate Cox and Joe Johnson, donated pizzas, as they have for several years. The Zonta Club of Mobile brought desserts, and Sharla Burke of Splendid Apples supplied sufficient chocolate apples for all to have a slice.\n\nSaraland Woman's Club, women from the Adult 55+ group from Cottage Hill Baptist Church and others provided a generous assortment of clothing — enough for the women to leave with a complete wardrobe, if they so chose.\n\nLooking over the tables of clothes and choosing an outfit were Sherie McNeal, Meghan Kramer, Ashley Smith and Gladys Campbell, who attended with Debra-Ann Crabtree, house mother at the group home where girls live. (Crabtree said the girls are enrolled in the GED classes at All God's Children facility in Wilmer.)\n\nIn Satsuma, the Palisades Community Club chose the home of Jerry and Ramona Knight, 616 Charles V St., as the June Yard of the Month. Ramona Knight is active in North Mobile Garden Society and frequently gives tours of the family's backyard, \"which is even more beautiful than the front,\" according to club representative Frances Westfaul.\n\nComing up\n\nComing up in Chickasaw is the city’s annual Independence Day celebration on July 4 at Ben Brooks Park. There’ll be plenty of food, cold drinks, music and activities. At 6 p.m., local teams will participate in “Almost Anything Goes,” a series of fun and silly relays. There’ll be live music by Plan B. And the Hope Puppets from Rainsville Baptist Church will present family entertainment for all ages. And, of course, the night will end with a fireworks show. Call Sam Rawls, 251-452-6475, for exhibit space rental.\n\nSenior news\n\nOn June 15, a special time was set aside at the Saraland Senior Center just for grandparents to enjoy the day with their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. There was a space walk, face painting, bingo, musical chairs and a fire and police department demonstration — and all that was before noon. Then generations enjoyed a hotdog or nacho and cheese lunch, and then it was back to a piñata, painting and coloring, and on and on.\n\nChickasaw residents Luther and Frankie Havard celebrated their 80th birthdays together on June 16 with a reception for family and friends at First Baptist Church of Chickasaw. Among the dozens of guests were the couple’s daughter, Teresa Lewis, and her husband, David; their son, Danny Havard, and his wife, Terri; grandchildren Christin (Jamie) Ferguson and Suzanne, Lauren and Trevor Lewis; and great-grandchildren, Ty and Luke Ferguson and Parker, Paisley and Preston Lewis.\n\nThe Chickasaw Senior Adult Summer Outing will be an evening (6-9:15) at the park enjoying the above activities. Transportation will be provided; call 251-452-6464.\n\nOn June 8, Nettie Reed celebrated her 50th birthday at Saraland Senior Center. She and Janice McAuthor entertained the group with a rousing rendition of “I’ll Fly Away” and other gospel songs. Other senior citizens in Saraland will celebrate June birthdays on June 27, and a Mother-Daughter Tea Party with grandchildren is scheduled at 3 p.m. on June 29. For information on the many activities at the center on Mae Street, call site director Heidi Crittenden, 251-375-5438. For transportation arrangements, call Lorine May, 251-375-5439.\n\nSummer fun\n\nThere are plenty of activities planned for children in the coming weeks. A boys’ and girls’ Youth Flag Football league will begin in July in Chickasaw. To register, call 251-452-6467.\n\nOn June 29, the noon movie at Prichard and Mitchell libraries is “The Little Mermaid: Stormy, the Wild Seahorse.” The free film is for children 3-13 years old.\n\nThe Family Feature Film at the Saraland Public Library on June 28 at 6 p.m. is “Treasure Buddies.” The free film is rated G and children are encouraged to bring their pillows and blankets for a nice, cozy evening with their families. For details, call 251-675-2879.\n\nSatsuma Library’s final Summer Reading Program for children is June 28 from 2 to 3 p.m. with a “children’s emergencies” activity. The Satsuma Summer Art Program for children 8-14 years old will be held from 1 to 3 p.m. during July. The deadline for registration is June 27. For information, call the library at 251-679-0700.\n\nThe Summer Reading Program at the Ina Pullen Smallwood Memorial Library in Chickasaw continues each Tuesday from 2 to 3 p.m. through July 17. Sandy Christian directs the program for children ages 5-12. For more information, call 251-452-6465.\n\nThe Arkema Summer Reading Program at McDavid-Jones Elementary School in Citronelle began June 5 with 35 students participating. It’s not too late to join Gabrielle Talbert and other students in the program, which won’t end until July 3. Both school libraries will be open on Tuesday from 9 a.m. until noon (parents must stay with their children.) Arkema Awards ceremony, recognizing top readers, will be July 10 in McDavid Jones gym.\n\nSchool news\n\nOn May 18, 80 students from McDavid-Jones Elementary School were treated to a Perfect Attendance field trip to Five Rivers Delta Resource Center by Partner in Education Arkema Inc. Cindy Childers of McDavid-Jones said that the students enjoyed seeing the different animals and plants that live in the Delta, and she praised both the staff at the facility for their “wonderful job in making the Delta come alive for our students,” and also the students for being at school every day throughout the school year.” Among those students were Brooklyn Lloyd and Rylie Smith.\n\nMore than 500 youngsters and volunteers took part in vacation Bible school at First Baptist Church of North Mobile the week of June 11-15. Among them were Abby Duke, Arabelle Skipper, Trace Allen, Taylor Head, Jackson Smith and Collin Blaylock, who gathered on the last day with other children to watch teacher Gail Swartz make some gigantic soap bubbles. Erin Talley is director of children’s programs at First Baptist North Mobile. Ed Litton is pastor at the Saraland church.\n\n-----\n\nEmail Jo Anne McKnight at Johmck@aol.com."
