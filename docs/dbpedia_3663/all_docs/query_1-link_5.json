It was produced by Centropolis Entertainment, Emmerich's production company, and distributed by Columbia Pictures. It is based upon the 2012 phenomenon, which was a number of beliefs that destructive events would occur on or around December 21, 2012. It was released on November 13, 2009. Critics gave it mixed reviews. They liked its special effects, but were critical of its length (158 minutes) and screenwriting. It made $770 million worldwide.[3]\n\nNeutrinos from a very large solar flare from the sun cause the temperature of Earth to increase at a very fast rate, eventually causing a very large geological and meterological disaster. The plot follows Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) as he tries to bring his children, Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate Curtis (Amanda Peet), and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy) to safety from the destructive events that occur. Among these events, a very large earthquake causes California to fall into the Pacific Ocean, the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, and a very large tsunami hits the United States.\n\nJohn Cusack as Jackson Curtis\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor as Dr. Adrian Helmsley\n\nAmanda Peet as Kate Curtis\n\nThandie Newton as Laura Wilson\n\nOliver Platt as Carl Anheuser\n\nThomas McCarthy as Gordon Silberman\n\nDanny Glover as the President Thomas Wilson\n\nWoody Harrelson as Charlie Frost\n\nLiam James as Noah Curtis\n\nMorgan Lily as Lily Curtis\n\nZlatko Buric as Yuri Karpov\n\nBeatrice Rosen as Tamara\n\nJimi Mistry as Dr. Satnam Tsurutani\n\nJohn Billingsley as Professor West\n\nBlu Mankuma as Harry Helmsley\n\nGeorge Segal as Tony Delgatto\n\nJohann Urb as Sasha\n\nStephen McHattie as Captain Michaels"
