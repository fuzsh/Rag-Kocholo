        "text": "On Independence Day (Tuesday, July 4), Angel Studios is releasing the film “Sound of Freedom,” which is based on an incredible, true story about the fight against human trafficking.\n\nThe film will be featured on the big screen throughout the country, taking on the newly released blockbuster film “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which stars Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas, Mad Mikkelsen, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\n“Sound of Freedom” stars Jim Caviezel (“The Passion of the Christ”) as Tim Ballard, a United States federal agent who quits his job to find the sister of a young boy he rescued from child traffickers.\n\nCaviezel’s character decides to leave his family at the urging of his wife—played by Academy Award-winning actress Mira Sorvino—to traverse the depths of the child sex trafficking world in the Columbian jungle in the hope of finding the young girl who was stolen from her family and sold into sex slavery.\n\nThe film’s reenactment of true events attempts to bring awareness to the $150 billion human trafficking business. It also reminds the church and American citizens of the unfortunate reality that the United States is one of the top destinations for human trafficking and is among the largest consumers of child sex.\n\nRELATED: Jim Caviezel Says ‘The Passion of the Christ’ Sequel Is Happening\n\n“By the time Ballard left Columbia, he and the team had rescued over 120 victims and arrested more than a dozen traffickers,” the film’s description states, adding that there “are more humans trapped in slavery today any other time in history…including when slavery was legal.” Unfortunately, “millions of these slaves are children.”\n\nDuring the film, Caviezel’s character is asked why he would risk his life to rescue a child he doesn’t even know. He replies, “Because God’s children are not for sale.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Caviezel shared that “The Passion of the Christ” director Mel Gibson wept when he saw the film.\n\n“I showed this movie to two Academy Award-winning film directors,” both of whom are brutally honest critics, Caviezel said. “Both of them were absolutely stunned. One of them is my good friend, Mel Gibson. The other one likes to remain anonymous. Mel was weeping.”"
