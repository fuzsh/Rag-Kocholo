        "text": "By Movieguide® Staff\n\nActor Jim Caviezel, best known for his performance in THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, recently announced that his upcoming movie, SOUND OF FREEDOM, will offer audiences free tickets.\n\nIn the movie’s first-look trailer, Caviezel says that there are nearly 2 million children trafficked each year.\n\n“An estimated 2 million children are trafficked every year and we can help them,” he said. “SOUND OF FREEDOM is based on a true story about real life heroes saving kids from the world of child trafficking.”\n\nThe actor added that he hopes at least 2 million people can come watch the movie and help spread the information on how to help children out of trafficking. The Angel Studios production will be released over July 4th weekend.\n\n“We know this is heartbreaking and it hurts to look at, but the first step in helping these children is hearing their story,” he added. “Not enough people know this problem exists and even fewer people are willing to do anything about it. Our goal is to inspire two million people to attend the\n\nfilm’s opening weekend to represent the two million trafficked children around the world.”\n\n“To spread the word, Angel Studios set up a ‘Pay It Forward’ program where you can pay for someone else’s ticket who might not otherwise see it,” he continued. “Every parent, every adult, and every teenager in America should be there to see it. If millions of us come together to see this film, we could propel the movement to help save millions of children around the world and you can send the message that God’s children are no longer for sale.”\n\nMovieguide® previously reported:\n\nSOUND OF FREEDOM follows the true story of Tim Ballard, who quit his job as a government agent to rescue children from sex trafficking. At first, he finds himself lost in this dark world but soon finds meaning after saving a 7-year-old boy who had been kidnapped. The young boy then asks Ballard to find and rescue his sister, who had also been kidnapped.\n\nBallard later founded Operation Underground Railroad, a nonprofit which works to save children from the world sex trade. Many of their employees are past government agents who partner with law enforcement around the world to rescue children.\n\n“SOUND OF FREEDOM is a riveting film that shares the story of one man’s heroic efforts to rescue children from human trafficking,” said Angel Studios CEO Neal Harmon. “Through this powerful cinematic experience, we aim to amplify the growing movement to expose this heinous violation of human rights and inspire people to take action, helping their communities put an end to this modern-day slavery once and for all.”\n\nMovieguide® award winner Caviezal (THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST) stars as Ballard, alongside Oscar-winner Mira Sorvino and Emmy-nominee Bill Camp. The film was written and directed by Alejandro Monteverde and produced by Eduardo Verástegui and executive produced by Jaime Hernandez."
