        "text": "The 2012 Apocalypse was a catastrophic phenomenon that occurred on Earth. The cause of the apocalypse was a drastic temperature increase within the Earth's core caused by mutated neutrinos from a massive solar flare in late 2009, which rendered the Earth's crust severely unstable.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe ancient Mayas discovered that Earth eventually will end. According to their calendar, this will happen in end of the fourth \"world cycle\", on December 21st, 2012.\n\nThe calendar was soon discovered and deciphered by archaeologists. When the information on the calendar was spread globally, some people were convinced of its accuracy. The majority however, dismissed it as a mere myth with no basis in science.\n\nTheories of the Apocalypse[]\n\nIn 1958, Professor Charles Hapgood published his theories of Earth Crust Displacement and pole shifting.\n\nRise in Core Temperature[]\n\nIn 2009, Adrian Helmsley visited Satnam Tsurutani in Naga Deng Copper Mine, India and discovered that neutrinos from a massive solar flare were causing a physical reaction, causing the temperature of the Earth's core to rapidly increase. Adrian reported this to United States Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser, who takes him to meet the President of United States, Thomas Wilson.\n\nPreparing for the Apocalypse[]\n\nIn 2010, President Wilson met the other G8 leaders during the 2010 G8 Summit to begin a top secret project to ensure humanity's survival. The project included the building of Arks in Cho Ming Valley under the disguise of a dam. Tickets sold at â‚¬1 billion per passenger gave additional funding to the project. The world governments kept the upcoming apocalypse confidential in order to prevent civil unrest. In 2011, several cultural treasures from all over the world were moved to the Arks.\n\nSurface Cracks Form[]\n\nSmall earthquakes start to strike the area around Los Angeles, creating massive surface cracks in Manhattan Beach, and later splitting Grayson's Market in half while it was open for business. Luckily, no one was injured or killed.\n\nThe Apocalypse[]\n\nAn earthquake struck California, splitting open the ground and causing Los Angeles to crumble into the Earth's crust, as the San Andreas Fault was shifted and the whole Pacific Plate was destabilized.\n\nLater that day, the Yellowstone Caldera erupted, creating an enormous ash cloud with engulfed the park and the rest of the Wyoming, and eventually the rest of the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House was being evacuated. Adrian and Anheuser watch a CNN report that massive earthquakes were hitting South America, which destroyed the famous Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro. Simultaneously, the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cancelled due to riots and massive destruction caused by earthquakes. Globally, preachers of various faiths warn the end of the world is imminent.\n\nThe Curtis family and Gordon arrived in Las Vegas, which was in ruins due to its own earthquake. The Yellowstone Ash Cloud made its way to Las Vegas soon after, engulfing what was left of the city. Several hours later, the group flew to Honolulu to refuel, but discovered that every volcano on the island has erupted, causing the surface to be completely covered in lava.\n\nLater, the Yellowstone Ash Cloud reached DC, although the city was spared due to its large distance from Yellowstone. An earthquake soon after strikes DC, causing the Washington Monument to collapse. Shortly after the St. Peter's Basilica Collapse occurred, resulting the death of the Italian Prime Minister, the Pope and many others present, the Earth's crust finally began to shift more than a thousand miles, and gigantic megatsunamis formed by it rapidly flood the entire planet, resulting in the deaths of billions of people and flooding entire continents.\n\nDuring this point, a megatsunami approached the Nampan Plateau, and that wave started to flood the Indian subcontinent, and eventually would reach the site where the Arks were. One of these Arks would be set adrift and flooded, but would ultimately survive before colliding with Mount Everest.\n\nAftermath[]\n\nMuch of the world was destroyed. Over 6 billion people died during the apocalypse and humanity became critically endangered. 26 days after the Worldwide Flooding occurred, global floodwaters from the tsunamis start to recede, allowing the remainder of mankind to begin a new life in Africa. The Earth is shown with a completely different landscape where Africa and other landmasses have risen in the aftermath of the apocalypse.\n\nSurvivors and Casualties[]\n\nSurvivors and Casualties\n\nDestroyed Locations[]\n\nSan Andreas Earthquake[]\n\nLos Angeles and Pasadena\n\nPresumably the rest of California\n\nYellowstone Caldera Eruption[]\n\nYellowstone National Park\n\nLas Vegas\n\nWashington D.C.\n\nMost of North America\n\nLocal Volcanoes[]\n\nHawaii\n\nLocal Earthquakes[]\n\nSouth American Earthquakes\n\nVatican City Earthquake\n\nWashington D.C. Earthquake\n\nWorldwide Flooding[]\n\nWashington D.C\n\nU.S. Eastern Seaboard\n\nEvery continent on Earth\n\nTrivia[]"
