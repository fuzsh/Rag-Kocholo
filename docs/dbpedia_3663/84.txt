Work in Progress Screening

Director Ondi Timoner expected to attend

Renowned documentarian and SFJFF alum Ondi Timoner (and two-time winner of the U.S. Grand Jury Prize at Sundance) explores an interfaith effort towards unity in Brooklyn in this observational documentary work in progress. Two pillars of their communities, Rabbi Rachel Timoner of Congregation Beth Elohim and Baptist Reverend Robert Waterman of Antioch Baptist Church, collaborate to bring their congregations together. They discuss questions of belonging, identity and faith with the hope of combating the racism and antisemitism that they feel are plaguing their communities. Ideating around shared and divergent histories and with a future of harmony in mind, the two challenge one another. An unflinching look at the difficulty of achieving these lofty goals, this film does not shy away from the obstacles they face in their faith, in society, and in their communities. In a moment where many are looking to find a model that requires turning towards one another, All Godâ€™s Children is a roadmap, a call to action, and a warning that this work is not for the faint of heart.
