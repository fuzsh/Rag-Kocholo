Do you see these children on the streets?

Have you walked the pavements where they sleep?

Do you feel their hands when you give them alms?

Did you ever give them bread to eat?

Have you seen their homes washed by the floods?

While a mother tightly holds her child

Do you hear the wind of the raging storm?

Can you tell them where it′s coming from?

Let us show our love and mercy

With true kindness and humility

For God loves the weak and the needy

Just like you and me

We are all God's children

We are all the same

He is calling us by name to help the poor and lame

And learn what life is really for

It′s to know and love and serve the Lord

Stand together and let's do our part

Hear their voices mend their broken hearts

Choose to be brave, fight for their rights

Give them back their honor and their pride

Please do not be blind

And just leave them behind

To struggle in darkness

Or give them empty promises

We are all God's children

We are all the same

He is calling us by name to help the poor and lame

And learn what life is really for

It′s to know and love and serve the Lord

It′s to know and love and serve the Lord

It's to know and love and serve the Lord
