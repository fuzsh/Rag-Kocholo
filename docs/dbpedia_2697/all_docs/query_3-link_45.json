        "text": "Identifying what it is that consumers want, often before they even know they want it, is all part of the job for Kristina Nowak, Marketing Group Manager for Scent Homecare across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. âWhen it comes to scent everything we do is aimed at a specific market â for a specific end user,â she explains. âDifferent countries associate different things with different scents, so what works in Dubai for example, wonât necessarily be what works in France.â\n\nâThatâs true even when youâre talking about a fragrance classic like vanilla. Itâs on the market all year long and almost every customer has a vanilla scent in their product range, but the aroma qualities consumers want from vanilla scents are as diverse as you could imagine. For some, such as the US consumers, there is a strong desire for edible, indulgent scents â think chocolate or baking smells â whereas elsewhere itâs all about fresh, almost cosmetic scents.â\n\nâAnd itâs not just the specific market that can have an impact on preferences. Tastes vary depending on the time of year, particularly in regions where you see a big changes in weather season to season. World events, such as the Olympics, can also have an impact: weâll see a big increase in the demand from our customers for limited edition scents that evoke a particular place or mood.â\n\nâOnce you start to think about it, you see that trends and the things that influence them are everywhere. What we need to do for our customers is identify which ones are important; we go through a screening process to identify the trends that matter so that we can offer our customers solutions that will work for them. This means that a lot of our work is proactive. Weâre looking at whatâs new, such as Pantone releasing its colors for the year, and translating that into new products and solutions that will inspire and surprise our customers.â\n\nâWe also need to know whatâs new; are there new products or new ways of doing things that we can learn from? We spend a lot of time evaluating products, thinking about how they work and where we can use what weâre seeing to add value for our customers. For this, we work very closely with our evaluation team. Weâll all sit together and smell and discuss new products or trends on an almost daily basis.â\n\nMy job surprises me every day. Even though vanilla is a fragrance classic, itâs so versatile that Iâm always discovering new fragrance profiles using it in ways Iâve not seen before.\n\nKristina Nowak, Marketing Group Manager for Scent Homecare EAME\n\nâOf course, the other main focus is specific customer projects. When we get a new project, one of the first things weâll do as well as looking at the market itâs intended for, is to look at what that customer currently has in their range. Weâll evaluate and map their products onto our genealogy of fragrances â a tool we first developed over 40 years ago for categorizing fragrances â so that we can see if there is a certain aroma they donât currently offer, or if there is a clear gap in the market somewhere.â\n\nâThis is where vanilla really comes into its own. Vanilla is the perfect combination scent. It works with almost everything, and brings a new dimension to every scent it harmonizes with. Whether weâre using it in a limited edition Christmas candle, drawing out its warm, comforting quality, or combining it with rhubarb for a fresh take on a nostalgic classic, it offers endless varieties. Vanilla is our secret weapon â its versatility means we can always offer customers a new fragrance profile that not only fits their brief, but also delights their consumers.â\n\nDespite the Symrise genealogy having been around for over four decades, the way that fragrances are classified hasnât changed. The team still sits together, smelling each fragrance in turn and categorizing it by family, subâfamily and specifier. Differences of opinion arise, just as they did when Peter WÃ¶ner, the H&R perfumer who first created the genealogy 40 years ago, would ask his colleagues for their input.\n\nToday, we produce different versions of the genealogy covering masculine and feminine fragrances, as well as functional products like laundry detergents and deodorants. A team of perfumers, evaluators and marketing colleagues test and assess new additions to each genealogy, as well as adding descriptors of the notes of fragrances and families, and marking key information such as if the scent is an archetype or a market it has been successful in. In this way, we can easily identify where opportunities exist for creating new fragrances or products that are not currently in the market."
