Gum:\n\nGums are found naturally as cementing substances between cells i.e., middle lamella or decomposition products of cellulose. The process of disintegrating internal tissue is called gummosis. Gums are colloidal in nature.\n\nThey are water soluble but insoluble in alcohol or oils. Gums exude naturally from stem, root or leaves due to wounds or burns. Commercial gums are in the form of dried exudation.\n\nUses:\n\nGums are used as adhesives in printing and finishing textiles, candy industry, in medicine, as sizing agent for paper and in food industry. Most common and useful gums are Gum arabic, gum tragacanth and Karayan gum.\n\ni. Gum Arabic:\n\nBotanical name: Acacia Senegal (L.)

As stabilizer in ice cream.\n\nType # 4. Resin:\n\nThese are oxidative products of essential oils, secreted in definite cavities or passages, typically derived from stems or roots as exudates due to incision, bruising, chipping etc.\n\nCharacters:\n\n1. Resins are brittle, amorphous and transparent substances.\n\n2. Insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol, either and turpentine.\n\n3. They are made up of resin, acid, anhydride and ester mixtures.\n\n4. They are antiseptic so can prevent decaying.\n\n5. They can lessen the amount of water loss.\n\nUses:\n\n1. Useful in making soaps, oil cloth, linoleum, medicine, plastic, varnish, firework, floor coating etc.\n\nResins may be of three types:\n\na. Hard resin,\n\nb. Oleoresins, and\n\nc. Gum resins.\n\nA. Hard resin:\n\nLittle amount of essential oil, solid, transparent brittle no odour or taste, non-volatile, poor conductor of electricity, burn in air with smoky flame.\n\nHard resins are of following type:\n\n1. Copals:\n\nNo oil, yield hard elastic varnish used in out door works.\n\na. East African Copal:\n\nZangibar copal is obtained from Trachylobium verrucosum and Inharubane copal is obtained from Capaifera conjugata tree found in south east African coast. The resin is natural exudates from tree trunk.\n\nb. West African Copal:\n\nCongo copal is obtained from Copaifera demeusii and Copaifera mopane. The trees are common in Congo basin. Accra and Benin Copals are obtained from Daniella ogea.\n\nc. Kauri Copal:\n\nIt is obtained from the kauri bine i.e., Agathis australis. The plant is found in New Zealand. It is yellow, transparent and very hard, used in varnish and in making linoleum.\n\nd. South American Copal:\n\nIt is obtained from South American locust (Hymenaea courbaril) which is a tall tree of Brazil. It is obtained from the stem twings and fruits exudes which drop on the ground.\n\ne. Manila Copal:\n\nIt is obtained from Agathis alba which is a tall conifer. Resin is used in enamels and interior work.\n\n2. Amber:\n\nIt is fossil resin found along the shores of Baltic Sea. It was obtained from Pinus succinifera (extinct sp.) It is used to make mouth piece of pipes, Holder of cigar and to increase elasticity of rayon fibres.\n\n3. Damar:\n\nDamar is obtained from the members of Dipterocarpaceae. It is abundantly found in Malaya in Sumatra. The chief Genera producing damar are Shorea robusta (Saal damar), Vateria indica (white damar), Canaricum strictum (black damar) and Balanocarpus etc. Damar is used in spirit, varnishes because of their lustere and light colour.\n\n4. Lacquer:\n\nIt is the natural varnish obtained from Rhus vemiciflua (Lacquer tree). The tree is native of China. It is cultivated in Japan.\n\nB. Oleoresin:\n\nThe oil content is more in addition to resin.\n\nMore or less liquid in nature with distinct aroma and flavour such as:\n\n1. Canada Balsam:\n\nIt is obtained from Abies balsamea (Balsam fir) of Canada and North United states. The resin is collected on elongated blisters on the bark and only small amounts are obtained. It is yellowish or greenish substances usually used as a mounting medium while making permanent slides. It acts as a cement for optical lenses. It is stimulant, antiseptic, irritant and component of collodion. It is fixative of soaps and perfumes.\n\n2. Terpentine:\n\nIt is obtained from coniferous trees. It is viscous honey like soft and brittle solid. It is secreted and accumulated in ducts near cambium and exudes naturally as soft, sticky substance. It is used in manufacture of linoleum, oilcloth, printers ink, floor covering, sealing wax, paints, varnishes, solvent of rubber and printing of cloth.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nC. Gum Resin:\n\nIt is a mixture of true gum and resin combining the characters of both. They contain small quantity of essential oil and large of colouring substance.\n\nGenerally obtained from members of Apiaceae and Burseraceae e.g.:\n\n1. Asafoetide (Ferula asafoetidia):\n\nThe cortex of thick fleshy roots exudes milky juice during rainy season. The root is cut and dried in the shade. The gum resin is collected on the surface in the form of tears. It has powerful odour and bitter arid taste due to sulphur compounds of essential oil. Asafoetida is a flavourant of curries and other food products and a medicine for cough, asthama, digestion etc.\n\n2. Galbanum (Ferula galbuniflua):\n\nThe gumresin is extracted from lower part of stem. It is used as medicine. It has tenacious aromatic odour.\n\n3. Opopanax (Commiphora kataf):\n\nA member of family Burseraceae used in perfumery. It is also used as medicine. Opopanax is also obtained from Opopanax chironium of family Apiaceae.\n\n4. Bdellium (Commiphora mukul):\n\nAlso known as guggulu; used in perfumery, Hawan samagri and as medicine also.\n\n5. Bisabal myrrh (Commiphora erythoracea):\n\nAlso known as Sweet myrrh. A member of family Burseraceae, this is a myrrh of antiquity and is used in incense, perfumes and embalming. Also used in perfumes and religious ceremonies.\n\n6. Ammaniaceum (Dorema ammoniaceum):\n\nIt exudes a milk latex from the stem and flowering branches as tears, which are collected and used as medicine in circulatory stimulant. It is also used in perfume industry."
