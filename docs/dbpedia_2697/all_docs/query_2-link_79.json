Hermitage Oils offers a selection of Absolutes, Essential Oils, Natural Isolates, Aroma Chemicals, CO2 Extracts, Ethanol Tinctures, and Extraits by Enfleurage. Email:Info Email:Sales Facebook GSC100405100558 GSC100405100558 Product(s): Frankincense Serrata ORGANIC Adam Michael has this to say “Frankincense serrata aroma is rich resinous, pine cone, dry woody, dry pine, with a lemony finish. This aroma sums up the aromatic environment of smelling a pine tree (maybe P. nigra) in the Summer, the sunshine warming the tree, and in turn the tree gives off that robust resinous aroma that saturates the air. Frankincense Carteri CO-OPERATIVE PROJECT Adam Michael has this to say “I buy all my frankincense carteri material from the Somalia Co-Operative project. The man behind this project has my utmost respect and admiration. He wants to make a difference and looking in his eyes this is not sales patter, it’s true, it’s heartfelt, he gives a damn about others, he is sick of the Somalia politics which is seeing a very few get very rich by controlling the sale of frankincense species. He wants the wealth to go to the right people and we can now all help and get a good deal in the process. This material has an alpha-pinene content at under 35%, it is produced from grade one tears, is an aromatic and chemically superior product compared to most carteri species on the market and best of all, the money spent buying this material helps better the life’s of 43 families.” Incense Wood Essential Oil Adam Michael has this to say “This is such a gorgeous material produced by co-extraction of frankincense sacra gum with Virginian cedarwood, honey yellow in colour and of a pourable viscosity. The idea of co extracting the two materials is one thing but the execution and outcome is beyond perfection and I can’t sing the praises of this aromatic enough. The frankincense has such a cosy, warm, balanced quality with fruity fresh lemon peel top notes. Frankincense Super Premium E/O I can’t recommend this oil enough to any frankincense connoisseur and feel privileged to be able to experience it for myself. For use in perfumery, I’d suggest letting this oil take centre stage. It’s not often that this sort of quality becomes available and if you want to use frankincense as a modifier or enhancer for other aspects of your perfume, leave that to the other grades. This oil needs to shine in your creation and send its prayer to the heavens unencumbered.” Bringing You Quality, Innovation, and Value... Naturally!

Frankincense has been used for thousands of years as a spiritual incense, for folk medicine, and as an addition to cosmetics, thought to boost the immune system. This oil is typically produced in smaller batches and may vary a bit from lot to lot. However, it's generally superior to most large batch varieties with its woody, balsamic, and floral characteristics. This legendary oil is an active ingredient in many perfumes and body care products, making it a staple to the industry. BosCar6 Frankincense/Olibanum Oil (carterii) A wonderfully unique Boswellia carterii Frankincense oil from one of our distilling partners in the Somaliland region of Somalia.

Ask Dave how to differentiate BosSac2 Frankincense/Olibanum Oil (sacra) Boswellia sacra Frankincense oil is a woody, balsamic oil directly from our distilling partner in Oman. A more rare form of Frankincense, Boswellia sacra is often referred to as \"sacred.\" The sacra variety is unique in aroma and composition compared to the other, more common, varieties of Frankincense. This is great for blenders who want a unique spin on the typical Frankincense."
