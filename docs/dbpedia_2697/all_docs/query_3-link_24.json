        "text": "Allspice\n\nAllspice smells like a combination cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg- hence the name. Most people call it pimento because when the Spanish found it, they mistook the fruit for black pepper, which the Spanish called pimienta.\n\nAllspice contains a chemical called eugenol, which might explain some of its traditional uses for toothache, muscle pain, indigestion, abdominal pain, heavy menstrual periods, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, colds, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity and as a germ-killer.\n\n​Ambergris\n\nAmbergris comes from some species of sperm whale, is one of the most valuable raw materials in perfumery. The fragrance it exudes is rare can be best described as marine, animalic and sweet.\n\nThis is whale's puke and worthless when fresh. It takes years of oxidation to make it perfume grade. The best one is white in color and usually small due to shrinkage.\n\nHistorically whale vomit was believed to prevent the plague by eliminating the plagues odor (which was believed to be the way the plague transferred from person to person). It was also used as an aphrodisiac. Today is primarily used to enhance taste of Cigars and also for perfume making.\n\n​Ambrette seed\n\nAlso known as musk-mallow, it is an aromatic and medicinal plant in the family Malvaceae native to Asia and Australia.\n\nAmbrette Seed is a rich, woody, musky oil, middle note. When used properly, it creates medium strength exotic, oriental or masculine perfumes.\n\nDifferent parts of the plant are used for Ayurvedic herbal medicine. It is antispasmodic and can be used to treat gonorrhea.\n\n​Anise (Italy)\n\nFew famous perfumes with this note are L'Heure Bleue by Guerlain. Fuel for life by Diesel, Pi by Givenchy, Air by Kenzo amongst others. its aroma come from anethol, making is bit similar to licorice, fennel or tarragon.\n\nIt is widely cultivated and is used to flavor food and alcoholic drinks, especially around the Mediterranean. It served as a carminative in herbal medicine.\n\n​Apricot\n\nA soft fruity note, close to peach but less juicy. If you have tried 'Sweet temptation' or \"love\" by Victoria Secret, or 'the lover' bu GAP you would know. Other perfumes have also used this top note including Shakira's Dance-alegria, DIOR's hypnotic poison, Lancome's Aroma Delice, Lady Gaga's Fame and Hugo Boss's HugoXX summer\n\nApricot pits contribute a bitter almond scent reminiscent of Amaretto liqueur. In general it's a great scent note and even as a fruit it is antioxidant and is good for skin and heart.\n\n​Basil (Asia)\n\nRemember Jo Malone's Basil and Neroli? It is part of several successful perfume like \"The one\" by Dolce & Gabbana, 'Lemon and Basil\" by Avon, \"splash\" by Marc Jacob, \"Truth\"\" by CK, \"Aqua Allegoria Mandarine Basilic\" by Guerlain.\n\nIt eases inflammation and joint pain. Imagine being able to tackle stress, anxiety, and inflammation with a relaxing cup of tea made with the leaves of holy basil. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.\n\n​Basil Holy (India)\n\nHoly basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) isn’t anything like the sweet basil in Italian marinara sauce or the Thai/ Vietnamese herb. This green leafy plant, also known as Ocimum sanctum L. Or Tulsi has amazing scent as well as therapeutic properties.\n\nHere's how to use it-\n\nUse its fresh flowers for bronchitis; Use the leaves and seeds, with black pepper, for malaria; Use the whole plant for diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; Use the pill and ointment form for eczema; Use an alcohol extract for stomach ulcers and eye diseases; Use an essential oil made from the leaves for insect bites.\n\n​Basil Sweet - (Egypt)\n\nThis Egyptian basil Oil Linalool (or Sweet Basil) is distilled from the botanical Ocimum basilicum L., a different plant. There are a number of chemotypes available in this family but Sweet Basil has the higher percentage of linalool and is considered the best for aromatherapy.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks believed that this herb would open the gates of heaven for a person passing on.\n\nBay (West Indies)\n\nAlso know as Bay Laurel, Bay Tree, Daphne, Grecian Laurel, Laurel, Laurel Común, Laurier d’Apollon, Laurier Noble, Laurier-Sauce, Laurier Vrai, Laurus nobilis, Mediterranean Bay, Noble Laurel, Roman Laurel, True Bay.\n\nSweet bay is an herb. The Greeks made it famous by crowning their heroes with wreathes made out of sweet bay leaves. In addition to decorative use, the leaves and oil are used to make medicine.
