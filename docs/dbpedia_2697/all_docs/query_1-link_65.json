Commiphora mukul, a related species, is not a source of myrrh. Myrrh is used to make medicine.\n\nMyrrh is used for indigestion, ulcers, colds, cough, asthma, lung congestion, arthritis pain, cancer, leprosy, spasms, and syphilis. It is also used as a stimulant and to increase menstrual flow.\n\nMyrrh is applied directly to the mouth for soreness and swelling, inflamed gums (gingivitis), loose teeth, canker sores, bad breath, and chapped lips. It is also used topically for hemorrhoids, bedsores, wounds, abrasions, and boils.\n\nIn foods and beverages, myrrh is used as a flavoring component.\n\nIn manufacturing, myrrh is used as a fragrance, in incense, and as a fixative in cosmetics. It is also used in embalming.\n\nHow does work?\n\nMyrrh can help decrease swelling (inflammation) and kill bacteria.\n\nInsufficient Evidence to Rate Effectiveness for...\n\nIndigestion.\n\nUlcers.\n\nColds.\n\nCough.\n\nAsthma.\n\nCongestion.\n\nJoint pain.\n\nHemorrhoids.\n\nBad breath.\n\nSore mouth or throat.\n\nOther conditions.\n\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of myrrh for these uses.\n\nSide Effects\n\nMyrrh seems safe for most people when used in small amounts. It can cause some side effects such as skin rash if applied directly to the skin, and diarrhea if taken by mouth.\n\nLarge doses may be UNSAFE. Amounts greater than 2-4 grams can cause kidney irritation and heart rate changes.\n\nSpecial Precautions & Warnings:\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: Taking myrrh by mouth during pregnancy is UNSAFE and should be avoided. Myrrh can stimulate the uterus and might cause a miscarriage. There isn't enough information to rate the safety of using myrrh on the skin during pregnancy, so until more is known, it's best to avoid this use.\n\nBreast-feeding mothers should also avoid using myrrh. Not enough is known about the safety of using myrrh when breast-feeding.\n\nDiabetes: Myrrh might lower blood sugar. There is a concern that if it is used along with medications that lower blood sugar, blood sugar might drop too low. If you use myrrh as well as medications for diabetes, monitor your blood sugar carefully.\n\nFever: Myrrh might make a fever worse. Use with caution.\n\nHeart problems: Large amounts of myrrh can affect heart rate. If you have a heart condition, get your healthcare provider's advice before starting myrrh.\n\nSurgery: Since myrrh might affect blood glucose levels, there is a concern that it might interfere with blood glucose control during and after surgery. Stop using myrrh at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\nSystemic inflammation: If you have systemic inflammation, use myrrh with caution, since it might make this condition worse.\n\nUterine bleeding: Myrrh seems to be able to stimulate uterine bleeding, which is why some women use it to start their menstrual periods. If you have a uterine bleeding condition, use myrrh with caution, since it might make this condition worse.\n\n**SpecialPrecautions**\n\nMedications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider.\n\nMyrrh might decrease blood sugar. Diabetes medications are also used to lower blood sugar. Taking myrrh along with diabetes medications might cause your blood sugar to go too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely. The dose of your diabetes medication might need to be changed.\n\nSome medications used for diabetes include glimepiride (Amaryl), glyburide (Diabeta, Glynase PresTabs, Micronase), insulin, pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), tolbutamide (Orinase), and others.\n\nWarfarin (Coumadin)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider.\n\nWarfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. Taking myrrh might decrease how well warfarin (Coumadin) works to slow blood clotting. This could increase the chance of blood clotting.\n\nThe appropriate dose of myrrh depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for myrrh. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using."
