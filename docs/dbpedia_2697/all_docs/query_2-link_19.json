        "text": "2.  True gums are formed from the disintegration of internal plant tissues, mostly from the decomposition of cellulose in a process called gummosis.  Chemically, Gums contain high amounts of sugar and are closely allied to the pectins. They are colloidal and soluble in water, either dissolving entirely or swelling, but they are insoluble in alcohol and ether.  They exude naturally from the stems or in response to wounding of the plant.\n\n4. A dried gummy exudate obtained from Acacia senegal and related acacias. These are small native trees of arid northern Africa.\n\n5. 1. The trees are tapped between February and May when the fruits are ripe. 2. Transverse incisions are made with a small ax and thin strips of the outer bark are torn off. 3. The gum slowly exudes as a viscous liquid, collects in a drop and hardens. 4. After 3-8 weeks these “tears” are collected. 5. The sun bleaches them, and the impurities are removed before marketing.\n\n6. It comprises mostly of galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid & small amount of protein. Gum arabic is slowly and completely soluble in cold water and has a high degree of adhesiveness and viscosity. Uses it has been used in textile, mucilage, paste, polish and confectionery industries and as a glaze in painting. In medicine it has been used as an emulsifying agent and as a demulcent.\n\n7. It comes from Astrangalus gummifer and other species of that genus. They are thorny shrubs of the arid regions of Western Asia and Southeaster Europe\n\n8.  This is formed by a transformation of the pith and medullary-ray cells into a mucilaginous substance that exudes naturally or after the bark has been punctured or excised.  The gum is allowed to dry on the bark before it is collected.  It reaches the market in one of three forms: tears, which are the dried natural exudate; vermiform gum, which consists of narrow twisted coils or strings; and flakes, which are ribbonlike pieces.\n\n9. Gum tragacanth has been used in calico printing and for other industrial purposes. It is one of the oldest drugs and was known since 300 B.C. In modern medicine it has served as an adhesive agent for pills and troches and for the suspension of insoluble powders.\n\n10. It is obtained from Sterculia urens, a large tree in central India.\n\n11.  Incisions are made into the heartwood and the gum oozes into these and accumulates as large irregular knobs. They are then collected, sorted and graded.\n\n12.  Chemistry: Gum karaya is an acid polysaccharide composed of the sugars galactose, rhamnose and galacturonic acid.  Uses: It is used in the textile, cosmetic, cigar, past and ice cream industries.\n\n13. Gum ghatti, obtained from Anogeissus latifolia, a large tree native to India and Ceylon, is used as a substitute for gum arabic. The leaves are used for tanning.\n\n14. • Feronia limonia and Cochlospermum religiosum in India, Burma and Java yield gums that are also used in place of gum arabic. Cycas gum • The Asiatic Cycas ciccinalis is the source of cycas gum. Carob • The carob, Ceratonia siliqua, produces tragasol, a mucilaginous hemi cellulose occurring in the pods. Mesquite gum • Mesquite gum in North America is obtained fro Posopis juliflora, P. glandulosa and other species Cherry gum • cherry gum is found in various species of Prunus.\n\n15.  Gums are especially common in plants of dry regions. They are used primarily as adhesives, and are also used in printing and finishing textiles, as a sizing for paper, in the paint and candy industries and as drugs. Three important commercial plant gums are gum arabic, gum tragacanth and karaya gum.\n\n16. Gum resins are mixtures of both true gums and resins and naturally combine the traits of both groups.\n\n17.  Gum resins occur naturally as milky exudates and collect in the form of tears or irregular masses.  They often contain small amounts of essential oils and traces of coloring material.  Injuring or tapping the plants also produces them. They are mostly from plants of dry, arid regions, especially species of the Umbelliferae and Burseraceae.\n\n19. Dorema ammonniacum, a tall, stout naked, hollow- stemmed perennial found in the deserts of Iran, southern Siberia and other parts of Western Asia.\n\n20. Plant has a milky juice, which exudes from the stem and flowering branches and hardens into tears. Insect injury often causes the exudation to occur. The brownish-yellow tears are hard and brittle and occur singly or in masses. Uses: Ammoniacum is used in medicine as a circulatory stimulant, and in perfumery.\n\n21. This is derived from Ferula assafoetida and allied species, stout perennial herbs of Iran and Afghanistan.\n\n22. The cortex of the thick fleshy roots exudes a milky juice during the rainy season. The crown of the roots is cut off and protected from the sun. The gum resin gradually collects on the surface in the form of tears, or masses of tears of varying colors imbedded in a thick, gummy, grayish or reddish matrix.\n\n23. Asafetida has a powerful and foul odor and a bitter acrid taste, due to sulfur compounds present in the essential oil. Despite this it has been used throughout the East for flavoring sauces, curries and other foods, and as a drug. In Europe and America is used in perfumes and for flavoring only when exceedingly dilute and after certain impurities have been removed. Asafetida has may valuable medicinal properties and is used in the treatment of coughs, asthma, and other nervous disorders and as an aid to digestion and metabolism.\n\n24. Galbanum is a gum resin excreted from the lower part of the stems of Ferula galbaniflua, a stout herbaceous perennial of Northwestern Asia.\n\n25. It occurs in the form of separate tears or brownish and yellowish- green masses. It has been used for centuries in medicine. Galbanum has a powerful tenacious aromatic odor.\n\n26. Herabol Myrrh is derived from Commiphora myrrha, a large shrub or small tree of Ethiopia. The gum resin oozes naturally from the stems or as a result of wounding. The pale-yellow liquid gradually solidifies and becomes brown or even black in color. Herabol myrrh is used in perfume manufacture and for medicinal purposes as a tonic, stimulant, and antiseptic and is often a constituent of mouthwashes and dentifrices.\n\n27.  Bisabol Myrrh or Sweet Myrrh is from Commiphora erythraea, and Arabian species of similar appearance. This is the myrrh of antiquity and has been used for centuries in incense, perfumes and embalming. It is one of the constituents of Chinese joss sticks.\n\n28. This is also known as Olibanum and is obtained from Boswellia carteri and related Asiatic and African species. The clear yellow resin exudes from incisions made in the bark and hardens as small yellow grains. It is used in perfumes, because of its excellent fixative properties, face powders, pastilles and fumigating powders.\n\n29.  These gum resins have been of much less importance.  Opopanax is derived from two very distinct plants, Commiphora kataf of the Burseraceae and Opopanax chironium of the Umbelliferae. It is used in perfumery and was formerly of importance in medicine."
