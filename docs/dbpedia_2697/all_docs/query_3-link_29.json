        "text": "Pages\n\ndescription Page 195\n\nTHE Exotick or Foreign PHYSICAL PLANTS.\n\nAC\n\nACacia.\n\nIt grows in Egypt.\n\nThe Juice of it press'd from the Cods, be∣fore they are ripe, or from the Flowers or Leaves, is used to strengthen the Eyes, and to take off the Inflam∣mation of them; and to cure Ulcers of the Mouth and Ears; and for Chaps of the Lips. The Juice re∣duc'd to a Powder, after it has been wash'd in a Decoction made with the Juice, or the Leaves or Flowers, and sprinkl'd on the Gums, and rub'd on the Teeth, fixes the Teeth when they are loose. A Dram of it dissolv'd in some Liquor, and taken every morning, stops all Fluxes of Blood. Many Women that have been almost destroy'd by an immoderate Flux of their Courses, have been cured by it. Clysters made of the Decoction of the Leaves and Flowers, and injected into the Womb, are used for the same purpose: As is also the Juice powder'd, and dissolv'd in Decoctions, and used in the same man∣ner. In Fluxes of the Belly are often used Cly∣sters, made in the same manner: And the Juice is frequently taken inwardly. A Decoction made of the Leaves and Flowers, and the Juice dissolv'd in it, is\n\ndescription Page 196\n\nexcellent for the Falling of the Womb, and Anus. A Fomentation made of the Juice, Leaves and Flowers, is very good for Weakness of the Limbs, and for Flu∣xions Swellings and Inflam∣mations of the Joints. Some make a Liniment of Vine∣gar and the Juice of it, which strengthens wonder∣fully the Joints when they are weak. The Juice pow∣der'd, and well wash'd with Water, cures obsti∣nate Ulcers of the Privy Parts, and of other weak Parts. The Decoction is also used to dry Pocky Pu∣stules; but then Guiacum is mix'd with it. The Pow∣der and Decoction of it are used for the Breaking out of Children's Heads. An∣cient and Modern Physi∣cians all agree, that Acacia is very astringent; and by that Means it does what it does.\n\nAgarick, in Latin Aga∣ricus.\n\n'Tis a white Fun∣gous, or Mushroom, that grows on the Larix-tree. The White, Light, and Brittle is the best.\n\nIt purges Flegm and Choler. 'Tis used for the Jaundice, and for those that are Short-breath'd; and also in the Stone of the Kidnies, in Difficulty of U∣rine, and for Mother-fits; the Falling-sickness, and for the Hip-Gout. It also pro∣vokes the Courses; where∣fore Women with Child ought not to take it. 'Tis given in Substance, from one Dram, to two Drams; and in Infusion, from two Drams to five. But the Troches of it are most com∣monly used, and are made in the following manner: Take of Agarick powder'd and sifted three Ounces; infuse it with two Drams of Ginger, in a sufficient quantity of White-wine; and make Troches: The Dose is one Dram. The Pills, in the London-Dispen∣satory, of Agarick, are made in the following manner: Take of Agarick three Drams; of our Sky-co∣lour'd Orris-roots, Mastick, Hore-hound, each one Dram; Turbith five Drams, Species Hiera Picra half an Ounce, Coloquintida and Sarcocol, of each two\n\ndescription Page 197\n\nDrams; Myrrh one Dram, of Sapa as much as is suffi∣cient to make a Mass.\n\nNote, Sapa is Wine boyl'd till two Thirds of it are consum'd. Half a Dram of this Pill is a suffi∣cient Dose: 'Tis used to purge the Breast, and to carry off Flegm. The Pill De Hiera cum Agarico is made in the following man∣ner: Take of the Species of Hiera Picra, and of A∣garick, each half an Ounce; of the best Aloes half an Ounce; of Hony of Roses a sufficient quantity to make a Mass: A Scruple, or a Scruple and an half may be taken at a time, made into four or six Pills. 'Tis good for Shortness of Breath, and Obstructions of the Lungs, and to pro∣voke the Courses, and for Mother-fits, and in Me∣lancholy Diseases, and to purge Flegm and Choler, and to open Obstructions of the Liver or Spleen, and for Diseases of the Head; but the use of them must be continu'd for the space of eight or ten Days. You may take them at Bed-time, if you eat no Supper. They are easie in their O∣peration. Agarick is either Male, or Female; the Male is not used. It comes from Agaria, a Region of Sar∣matia; and from thence it takes its Name. It grows also in Dauphiné in France; but the best comes from the Tridentine Woods. It grows in many other pla∣ces.\n\nAgnus Castus, or The Chaste Tree.\n\nThe Athenian Matrons, when they at∣tended on the Divine My∣steries of Ceres, used to lie on the Leaves of this Tree, to keep them chaste. The Seed of it, by reason of the Likeness, is called by some Eunuch's-Pepper. It sup∣presses Nocturnal Imagi∣nations of Venery, and cures the Incontinency of Seed. The Fruit of it re∣lieves those that are bitten by Serpents; and is good for those that are troubled with the Spleen and Drop∣sie. It increases Milk, and provokes Urine, and the Courses. Take of the Con∣serve of Agnus Castus, of the Flowers of Water-Lilly and Violets, each half an Ounce;\n\ndescription Page 198\n\nof Conserve of Red Roses half an Ounce, of the Stalks of Lettice candied one Ounce, of Prepar'd Coral two Drams; with Syrup of Violets, and of Water-Lillies, make an Opiat. This is used in the Uterine Fury. Give the quantity of a Nutmeg, Morning and Evening.\n\nAlcali.\n\nEvery pure Salt is so called, that is without an Acid. 'Tis drawn from the Ashes, or the Calx of any Matter extracted by a Lee. 'Tis proper to all things, liquid and solid. The Word is deriv'd from Kaly, the Name of a Plant, with which Glass is made. It easily ferments with an Acid; and, together, they are the Cause of all Inte∣stine Motion: Nothing grows, or increases, with∣out these two. Alcali is Three-fold; viz. Volatile Alcali, which is made of Animals, viz. of Harts∣horns, of Urine, and the like. Fix'd, which is extracted from the Ashes of Plants; as, from Wormwood, Tar∣tar, and the like. Metal∣lick and Stony; for Metals and Stones ferment with an Acid Menstruum. Mix'd Alcalies are added to these; as, Nitre, Alum, the several sorts of Vitriol, Fossile, and Sea-Sealt, and the like; which participate of Alcali, and Acid.\n\nAlmond-tree, in Latin Amygdalus.\n\nThere are ma∣ny sorts of Almonds; but in Practice they are distin∣guish'd only into Bitter and Sweet. The Jordan-Al∣monds are most esteem'd amongst us; which are larger, longer and narrow∣er, rounder and thicker, than the Valentian; and of a better Taste.\n\nSweet Almonds nourish much, and make the Body fat. They mitigate the A∣crimony of the Humours, and increase Seed. They are good for Lean People, and for such as are Con∣sumptive. But they are chiefly used in Emulsions. Take of Sweet Almonds blanch'd number Three, of the Seeds of Melon, Let∣tice and White Poppies, each one Dram; of the Pulp of Barly three Drams;\n\ndescription Page 199\n\nbeat them in a Marble-Mortar, and pour on them a sufficient quantity of Bar∣ly-water; to seven Ounces of the strain'd Liquor add five Drams of Diacodium; mingle them, and make an Emulsion. This is good in the Stone, and for Heat of Urine. Take of Sweet Almonds prepar'd, and in∣fus'd in Rose-water, two Ounces; of the four Great∣er Cold Seeds, of Plantain and Purslain-seeds, each one Dram; of the Seeds of Marsh-mallows and White Poppies, each one Scruple; beat them according to Art, and pour on them a suffi∣cient quantity of a Deco∣ction of Barly and Liquo∣rish; make an Emulsion for two Doses; add to each an Ounce of Syrup of Water-Lillies, of Sal Pru∣nellae half a Dram. This is good for Pleurisies, and Heat of Urine, and the like. Oyl of Almonds is good for Hoarsness, and Coughs: Take of Oyl of Almonds fresh drawn, of Syrup of Maiden-hair, each one Ounce and an half; of Sugar-candy two Drams; mix them in a Glass-Mor∣tar: Make a Linctus, to be taken often with a Liquo∣rish-stick. Oyl of Almonds is good in the Cholick: Take two Ounces of Oyl of Almonds, and one Ounce and an half of Man∣na, mix'd together in fat Chicken-broth. This re∣liev'd a Person that had the Cholick, after he had taken thirty Clysters to no pur∣pose. Oyl of Almonds is very good for the Stone in the Kidnies: Take of White-wine, and Com∣pound-water of Horse-Ra∣dish, each one Ounce and an half; of the Juice of Limon one Spoonful and an half, of Tartar vitriola∣ted one Scruple, of Oyl of Sweet Almonds one Ounce, of Syrup of Marsh-mallows two Ounces, of Nutmeg powder'd one Scruple; make a Draught to be ta∣ken hot. For the Gripes of Infants, the following Me∣dicine was prescrib'd by Dr. Lower: Take of Man∣na two Drams, dissolv'd in two Ounces of the Aqua la∣ctis alexiter; strain it, and add three Drams of Oyl of Almonds: Give half in the Morning, and the rest three\n\ndescription Page 200\n\nHours after, if it do not work. Bitter Almonds are hot and dry; they attenu∣ate, open and cleanse; they are Diuretick; they open the Obstructions of the Li∣ver, Spleen, Mesentery and Womb. Outwardly used, they take off Freckles. The Oyl of Bitter Almonds is more agreeable to the Ears, than any other Oyl. The Italians eat Almonds whole, before the Stones are hard, for Second Course; and they taste very pleasantly, and are very agreeable to the Stomach. They grow in Germany, Italy, and France.\n\nAloes, in Latin Aloe.\n\nThere are three sorts of it, viz. Succotrine, Hepatick, and Caballine. Succotrine is so called, from the Island Succotra in India. This sort is the best of all; 'tis clear and transparent, and colour'd somewhat like the Liver. It has an Aroma∣tick Smell, like Myrrh; upon which Account it was formerly mix'd with Per∣fumes. It has a bitter, an Aromatick, and an a∣stringent Taste. 'Tis light, and yet the Substance of it is compact. Being handled in the Sun, or near the Fire, it grows soft; and when it is cold it breaks easily: Which are the Signs of the best Aloes. The Hepatick is so called, it being like the Liver in Colour and Consistence. 'Tis not so pure as the former, it is not transparent, it smells strong∣er, and tastes more bitter, and is more astringent. The Caballina is more im∣pure, sandy, and filthy; and fit only for Horses.\n\nAloes, besides its Purga∣tive Virtue, is hot and dry∣ing, and opens Obstructi∣ons: It purges Choler and Flegm. Aloes, contrary al∣most to all other Purging Medicines, strengthens the Stomach. But it is to be noted, That the frequent use of Aloes opens the Hae∣morrhoidal Veins; and, to be sure, it has a Faculty of opening the Orifices of the Veins: Wherefore those that are subject to Haemor∣rhages must not use it. Bartholinus mentions an Observation of one that render'd a Bloody Urine,\n\ndescription Page 201\n\nby taking Aloes too often. But, outwardly applied, it is very astringent. Aloes kill and expel Worms: Be∣ing mix'd with Vinegar, and the Gall of an Ox, and applied to the Navel, it does the same. It cures the Jaundice, and prevents Putrefaction. And, mix'd with Myrrh, it preserves dead Bodies a long time from Corruption. Some think the Virtue of Mum∣my proceeds wholly from the Aloes, wherewith Bodies were wont to be embalm'd. The Powder of Aloes, used outwardly, stops the Flux of the Haemorrhoidal Veins. Dissolv'd in Wine, it pre∣vents the Falling of the Hair. Mix'd with Medi∣cines for the Eyes, called Collyria, it quickens the Sight. Mix'd with Hony, it cures Ulcers of the Privy Parts, and a Fistula, and Sore Mouths and a Stink∣ing Breath. It shuts the O∣rifices of the Veins, and so stops Bleeding. Outward∣ly applied, it thickens and dries; and the Powder of it conglutinates fresh Wounds, and skins them soon. In prescribing Aloes, the following Cautions are to be observ'd. First, It is not to be given to those, whose Diseases proceed on∣ly from a simple Intempe∣ries, without Matter; for such do not want Evacua∣tion, nor a Medicine that is so drying; for, instead of Evacuation, it occasions a Consumption in such: But, on the contrary; 'tis used with very good Success in those that are of a cold and moist Constitution. Se∣condly, It ought not to be prescrib'd to Old People. Thirdly: It ought not to be used too frequently; espe∣cially, not daily, as some order it. And Fourthly, Wo∣men with Child must not take it; for it provokes the Courses powerfully. Those things which are ad∣ded for the Correction of it are, Mace, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, Spike∣nard, Sweet-smelling Flag, Saffron, and the like. The Operation of it is quicken'd by washing it in a Deco∣ction of Rhubarb, or in an Infusion of Roses. 'Tis said, that Mastick, Traga∣canth, Bdellium, and the like, mix'd with it, pre∣vents\n\ndescription Page 202\n\nits opening the Ori∣fices of the Veins: Or, if it be wash'd in Endive, or Succory-water, the same may be prevented. Ma∣ny excellent Medicines of the London-Dispensatory are compounded of Aloes. The Pills called Pilulae Aggrega∣tivae are made in the follow∣ing manner: Take of Ci∣tron, Myrobolans, and Rhu∣barb, each half an Ounce; Juice of Agrimony, and Wormwood thicken'd, each two Drams; Diagridium five Drams; Agarick, Co∣loquintida and Polypodium, of each two Drams; Tur∣bith and Aloes, of each six Drams; Mastick, Red Ro∣ses, Sal Gemmae, Epithimum, Annise, Ginger, of each a Dram; with Syrup of Da∣mask-Roses, make a Mass for Pills: They purge Flegm, Choler and Melan∣choly; they are good for a foul Stomach: The Dose is half a Dram. Pilulae A∣loephanginae are made in the following manner: Take of Cinnamon, Cloves, Car∣damoms the Lesser, Nut∣megs, Mace, Sweet-smel∣ling Flag, Carpo-balsamum, or Juniper-berries, Squi∣nanth, Wood of Aloes, Yellow Sanders, Red Ro∣ses dried, Wormwood, of each half an Ounce; draw a Tincture from these, in Spirit of Wine, they being first grosly powder'd: In three Pints of this Tincture strain'd, dissolve a Pound of Aloes; then add of Ma∣stich and Myrrh powder'd; each half an Ounce; Saf∣fron two Drams, of Bal∣sam of Peru one Dram; bring it to a Mass for Pills, by evaporating the super∣fluous Moisture over Ashes, or in a Bath. These Pills are good for the Head-ach, and Giddiness of the Head: They strengthen the Brain and Stomach. Half a Dram, or a Dram, may be taken at a time. Pilu∣lae de Aloe lota are made in the following manner: Take of Aloes, dissolv'd in the Juice of Red Roses, and boyl'd up again, one Ounce; of Agarick tro∣chiscated three Drams, of Mastick two Drams, of the Species of Sweet Dia∣mosk half a Dram; with Syrup of Pale Roses make a Mass for Pills.

Take of Fat Ammoniacum, dissolv'd in Vinegar of Squills, one Ounce; of Ex∣tract of Aloes half an Ounce, of Crystal of Tar∣tar one Dram, of Myrrh, and Saffron, each half a Dram; of Mastich, Benja∣min, and Salt of Ash-tree and Wormwood, each one Scruple; with Oxymel of Squills make a Mass for Pills. The Dose is, half a Dram, twice a Week; Purging being used betwixt whiles. These Pills are good for a Scirrhus of the Spleen.\n\nBen-Nut, in Latin, Balanus Myrepsica.\n\nDisco∣rides, and others of the An∣cients, attribute many Vir∣tues to it. It purges up∣ward and downward, and evacuates Choler and Flegm. It has an Acrid Moisture, whereby it sub∣verts the Stomach, occa∣sions Nauseousness, and moves the Belly. It purges gross and clammy Flegm by Vomit and Stool; wherefore it is good for a Flegmatick Cholick. Mix∣ed with Hony, it resolves hard Swellings, and the King's-Evil. Made up in∣to a Pultis with Barly-Meal and Hony, it doth good in cold Diseases of the Nerves. Mix'd with Meal of Lupines, it takes off Ob∣structions and Hardness of the Liver and Spleen. The Oyl drop'd into the Ear, cures Deafness, and the Noises of it. It cleanses the Skin from Spots. That which is old is better for inward use than the fresh, because by Time the Moi∣sture is evaporated, which so much disturbs the Body. The like may by observ'd in the Roots and Leaves of Asarabacka; which purge violently upward and downward when they are green, by reason of such an\n\ndescription Page 219\n\nAcrid Moisture; for when they are dry they lose that malignant and violent force. The same is also to be ob∣serv'd in Orris; which, when green, burns and pricks violently; but when it is dry it doth not do so. The same is to be observ'd in the Roots of Wake-Ro∣bin, which lose their Acri∣mony when they are dry. Take Bdellium, Ammonia∣cum, and Galbanum, of each equal parts; beat them in a Mortar, with the Oyl of Ben and Lillies; then add the like quantity of the Mucilage of the Seeds of Fenugreek, and Figs: Make an Ointment. 'Tis of great use in the Scirrhus.\n\nBirth-wort, Long and Round, in Latin Aristolochia.\n\nThe Root is hot and dry. Both discuss, attenuate, o∣pen, and cleanse: But the Round is of finer parts, the long of grosser: Both are Cephalick, Epatick, and Pulmonick. They are good to open the Obstructions of the Lungs, to provoke the Courses, to break inward Tumors, and to expel Poi∣son. The Infusion of the long Root is frequently u∣sed to cure the Itch, and to cleanse Wounds. 'Tis good for Pains in the Sto∣mach, and for the Hickups. But the chief use of both is, to purge the Womb af∣ter Child-birth, and to force the Courses. Take of the Roots of Round Birth-wort half a Dram, of the Leaves of dried Sa∣vin one Dram and an half, of Dittany of Crete, of the Troches of Myrrh, of Asa Foetida, each one Dram; of choice Cinnamon two Drams, of White Sugar two Ounces; make a fine Powder of them all: Take two Drams in the Morn∣ing, for some Days, in the Broth of Red Vetches, wherein two Drams of Cinnamon and half a Dram of Saffron have been boyl'd. Birth-wort grows every where in the Hedges, in Italy, France and Spain.\n\nBishop's-weed, in La∣tin Ammi.\n\nThe Seed of it is one of the four Lesser hot Seeds. It incides, o∣pens, and dries. 'Tis good for the Gripes, Difficulty\n\ndescription Page 220\n\nof Urine, and the Biting of Venomous Creatures; and also forces the Courses. 'Tis mix'd with Blistering Plasters to prevent Difficul∣ty of Urine, which usually comes upon the use of such Medicines: But the use of it, as of Cummin, are Cau∣ses of pale Colour. 'Tis of excellent use for Barren∣ness, a Dram of it pow∣der'd, being taken in Wine, or fresh Broth, every other Day, three Hours before Meals: But it ought not to be given above four or five times. 'Tis an excel∣lent Medicine in this Case, and has often been found successful. But the Hus∣band must not be concern'd with his Wife on the Days she takes the Seed. To which End, and also for the Whites, an Uterine Clyster being first used, says Simon Paulus, I have given the following Pow∣der to many barren Wo∣men; whereby they prov'd with Child, and were freed from the Whites. The Description of the Uterine Clyster is as follows: Take of the Roots of Long and Round Birth-wort, each two Drams; of Gentian, and Zedoary, each one Dram; of Ground-Ivy, the Lesser Centory, of Birth-wort, and Rosemary, each one Handful; of Balm, and Red Mug-wort, each half an Handful; of the Lesser Cardamoms half an Ounce; cut and beat them for a Decoction for an Ute∣rine Clyster. The Descrip∣tion of the Powder is as fol∣lows: Take of Speed-well, of the Seeds of Bishop's-weed, each half an Ounce; of the Lesser Cardamoms, of sharp Cinnamon, each two Drams; of Sugar-Candy a fourth part of the weight of all the rest: Make a Powder according to Art. Take of the Roots of Elecampane, Smallage, Fennel, and Orris dried, each one Ounce and an half; of the Roots of Va∣lerian, Gentian, Asarabac∣ca, Squills, each one Dram; of the inner Bark of the Elder, and Saxifrage, each six Drams; of the Leaves of Wormwood, Agrimony, Germander, Maiden-hair dried, each two Drams; of the Tops of the Lesser Centuary, and Broom-Flowers,\n\ndescription Page 221\n\neach one Dram; of the Seeds of Parsley, Bi∣shop's-weed, and Dill, each one Dram and an ha••••; of Cinnamon two Dram•••• of Spikenard half a Dram; mix them together, and in∣fuse them in two or three Measures of White-wine: Let the Sick drink of this Wine every Morning. This is good for a Dropsie. The Seed of Bishop's-weed is al∣so an Ingredient of the Compound Syrup of Beto∣ny in the London-Dispensa∣tory. It comes from Ale∣xandria.\n\nBitter-Vetch, in La∣tin Orobus.\n\nA Water di∣still'd from it, breaks and expels the Stone in the Bladder. The Root of it is good against Poisons, and the Strangury. The Plant bruised, and applied hot, eases the Pain of the Side. It grows about Geneva; and frequently in the Woods in Germany.\n\nBrazile-wood, in Latin Brazilia arbor.\n\n'Tis a large and vast Tree; and so ve∣ry thick sometimes, that three Men, with their Arms extended, can scarce com∣pass it. The Wood is cold and dry; it mitigates Fe∣vers; 'tis Binding, and Strengthening. Infus'd in the Cold, with Eye-water, it cures Inflammations of the Eyes. The Wood is much used for making Handles for Knives and Swords, and Drum-sticks. 'Tis very dense and pon∣derous, and may be po∣lish'd. Take of Sarsaperil∣la, of Crude Antimony, and of the Shells of Nuts, each six Ounces; of the Roots of China one Ounce, of Brazile-wood a little, of Water nine Pints; boyl half away; the Antimony, and the Shells powder'd, must be hang'd in a Rag, so that they may not touch the bottom of the Vessel; strain it: Take a large Draught in the Morning, three Hours before Din∣ner; and in the After∣noon, four Hours after Dinner; and three Hours after Supper, for fifteen Days; Bleeding and Pur∣ging being first used. This is commended in the Gout.\n\ndescription Page 222\n\nC.\n\nCAmel's-Hay, in La∣tin Schaenanthus.\n\nIt heats, discusses, and is of fine Parts. 'Tis chiefly u∣sed for Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, and the like. 'Tis also used for Vomit∣ing, and the Hickups; as also for Wind in the Sto∣mach, for Difficulty of U∣rine, and Pains of the Kid∣nies, Bladder and Womb. It cures a Stinking Breath, and strengthens the Head, and discusses the Swelling of the Ʋvula, and strength∣ens the Stomach, it being outwardly used in a Lotion. A Dram of it powder'd may be taken inwardly, in hot Wine; or it may be boyl'd in Water. 'Tis rec∣kon'd a Specifick for Ul∣cers of the Bladder. A Woman evacuated a Stone almost as big as a Walnut, which had occasion'd an Ulcer of the Bladder, and of the neighbouring Parts, by using Camel's-Hay and the Roots of Cypress. Take of the Tops of Roman-Wormwood three Drams, of Hore-hound and Rose∣mary, each two Drams; of Red Roses two Pugils, of the Flowers of Camo∣mile, and the Leaves of Laurel, each half an Hand∣ful; of Orange-Pill, and of Sweet Wood of Aloes, each three Drams; Cy∣press-roots, Camel's-Hay, and Spikenard, each half an Ounce; make a Deco∣ction with two parts of the best Wine, and one part of Agrimony and Wormwood-water; foment the Region of the Liver with it, with a Spunge press'd out of Wormwood-wine. This has been used in a Drop∣sie.\n\nCamphir, in Latin Camphora.\n\nCamphir was unknown to the Ancient Grecians: It began first to be taken notice of by the Arabians. Whether it is hot or cold, is not agreed on by Authors. The An∣cients counted it cold, be∣cause it extinguish'd Vene∣ry, and cured Inflamma∣tions of the Eyes; and for that being put upon Burns, it seem'd as cold as Snow. But Modern Physicians af∣firm, 'tis hot, on the con∣trary:\n\ndescription Page 223\n\nTheir Arguments for it are, the great In∣flammability of it; its pe∣netrating, Aromatick Smell, and Acrid Taste; its rea∣diness to evaporate, by rea∣son of the Tenuity of Parts. Which Opinion, indeed, seems most probable; for the contrary Arguments are easily answer'd. For, if it should be granted that it suppresses Venery, it doth not therefore necessarily follow that it is cold; for so doth Rue, and the chaste Tree, and the like. Yet Breynius saith, it doth not extinguish Venery: For, says he, it hath been ob∣serv'd, that many who have been employ'd in purifying Camphir daily, have had many Children. And then, tho' it be of use in many Diseases that require Cool∣ing, as, in Inflammations of the Eys, and Erysipelas, Fevers, and the like; yet they say, Cooling in these Cases, by this Medicine, is not per se, but per acci∣dens; much in the same manner as the Inflamma∣tion of a Member burnt is drawn out by the Heat of the Fire, or the Flame of a Candle, or, as by the immoderate use of Pepper, the native Heat is driven out, and is less within; and so the Body becomes cold. Some mention other Ways whereby these things may be perform'd; which I omit, partly because they are not satisfactory, and partly because it is not clear, whether Camphir doth good in these Diseases, or whether it be injurious. Camphir resists Putrefa∣ction and Poisons; upon which Account it is fre∣quently used in the Plague, Malignant Diseases, and Putrid Fevers. Balm-wa∣ter, wherein Camphir hath been extinguish'd, doth good in Mother-fits. 'Tis most frequently used out∣wardly, in cooling Epi∣thems, Frontals, and Pare∣goricks: And for the mix∣ing of it with them, 'tis wont to be dissolv'd with the Spirit of Wine, or rub∣bed with Oyly Kernels or Seeds. Camphir dissolves in Spirit of Wine present∣ly, and swims upon the top of the Spirit, in form of an Oyl. Camphir is mix'd with Wash-balls, to\n\ndescription Page 224\n\nsmoothen and beautifie the Skin. A small quantity of it used outwardly or in∣wardly, disposes to Sleep: But if it be held to the Nose frequently, it dries the Brain, and causes Watching. Camphir is reckon'd by the most learn∣ed Men, and not undeserv∣edly, among the strongest Alexipharmicks. It won∣derfully resists Putrefaction, and repels and corrects the putrid Vapours of a cor∣rupt Member: But it is to be used cautiously in vio∣lent Pains of the Head and Stomach. Camphir is dis∣solv'd in Spirit of Wine; and this Dissolution is cal∣led Spirit of Wine Cam∣phoriz'd. 'Tis good for the Apoplexy, and Hyste∣rical Diseases. 'Tis also found to be of excellent use for the Tooth-ach, a little Cotton being dip'd in it, and put into the ach∣ing Tooth. The Oyl of Camphir is made in the following manner: Pow∣der grosly three or four Ounces of good Camphir, put it into a Matrass, and pour upon it twice as much Spirit of Nitre; stop your Vessel close, and set it over a Pot half full of Water, a little heated; stir it ever now and then, to help forward the Disso∣lution, which will be fi∣nish'd in two or three Hours, and then you will find the Camphir turn'd in∣to a clear Oyl, which swims above the Spirit; separate it, and keep it in a Viol well stop'd. 'Tis used for the Caries of Bones, and to touch Nerves that are uncover'd in Wounds. This Oyl is nothing but a Disso∣lution of Camphir in Spi∣rit of Nitre; for if you pour Water upon it, to de∣stroy the force of the Spi∣rit, it returns into Cam∣phir, as before. Of all the Resins, this is the only one that can dissolve in Spirit of Wine. Take of Vola∣tile Salt of Hart's-horn two Grains, of the Majesterial Cardiac-powder six Grains, of Camphir and Cochinel, each four Grains; of Ve∣nice-Treacle one Scruple, of the Aqua Coelestis a suffi∣cient quantity: Make a Bolus. This is good in Malignant Fevers. Take of Camphir and Borax,\n\ndescription Page 225\n\neach one Dram; of White Sugar-candy five Drams, of White Vitriol one Scru∣ple; powder them very fine, and mingle them by degrees with half a Pint of Sweet-Fennel-water. This is an excellent Water for Rheums and Inflamma∣tions of the Eyes, a Rag being dip'd in it, and ap∣plied often on the Eye-lids. 'Tis gather'd from more Trees than one. It distils, Drop by Drop, from a great Tree, much like a Walnut-tree, in the Island Borneo, in Asia. Little Cakes of it are likewise brought out of China, but that is not so good. It must be chosen white, transparent, clean, friable, without Spot, and such as is hard to quench when once lighted. Camphir is compounded of a Sulphur and a Salt; so very Vola∣tile, that it is very hard to keep any time; and it always loseth something, let it be never so closely stop'd.\n\nCancamum:\n\nSee Gum∣mi Anime.\n\nCanela:\n\nSee Cinna∣mon.\n\nCapers, in Latin Cap∣peris.\n\nThey are brought to us in Pickle, and are frequently used for Sauce for Roast and Boil'd Meat, and for Fish. They quic∣ken the Appetite, promote Concoction, and open Ob∣structions of the Liver and Spleen. Lobelius says, the Biggest Capers are better than the Least. Perhaps he means the Fruit which is sometimes pickl'd, and is called Long-Capers: But now-a-days they are not used in England. It is said, that they who eat Italian Capers daily, are not trou∣bled with the Palsie, nor Pains of the Spleen. They are good for the Hip-Gout, and Bursten-Bellies. They provoke the Courses, draw Flegm from the Head, and cure the Tooth-ach. Be∣ing boyl'd in Vinegar, the Bark, especially of the Root, softens the Spleen when it is hard. Being ta∣ken inwardly, or outward∣ly applied, it provokes the Courses, cleanses Ulcers, and dries; doth good in\n\ndescription Page 226\n\nthe Gout, digests hard Tu∣mours; it also kills Worms. Take of Oil of Lillies, and of Capers, each two Oun∣ces; of the Juice of Briony and Smallage, each three Ounces; boyl them to the Consumption of the Jui∣ces; then add of Ointment of Marsh-mallows and Gum-Ammoniacum, dis∣solv'd in Vinegar, and strain'd, each one Ounce; of the Seeds of Daucus and Spikenard, each one Dram and an half; of yel∣low Wax a sufficient quan∣tity; make an Ointment: When you use it add a lit∣tle Vinegar of Roses. This is commended for Obstru∣ctions of the Liver. Oyl of Capers of the London-Dispensatory is made in the following manner: Take of the Bark of the Roots of Capers one Ounce; of the Bark of Tamarisk, of the Leaves of the same, of the Seeds of the chaste Tree, of Spleen-wort, and of the Roots of Cyperus, each two Drams; of Rue one Dram, of ripe Oyl of Olives one Pint, of the sharpest Vine∣gar, and of fragrant White-wine, each two Ounces; cut them, and steep them two Days, and boyl them gently in B. M. and when the Wine and Vinegar are consum'd, strain it, and keep it for use. This Oyl is very proper for Hard∣ness, Pain, and Obstructi∣ons of the Liver or Spleen; and also for the Rickets. Capers grow in Sandy Ground, and amongst Rub∣bish, at Rome, and Florence, and other Parts of Italy.\n\nCardamoms, in Latin Cardamomum.\n\nThey have a gentle Heat, that is very agreeable to Nature. They provoke Urine and the Courses, and open Obstru∣ctions of the Liver and Spleen, and especially of the Mesentery; in which Obstructions they do Won∣ders; they are also good to help Concoction. They are an Ingredient in the Com∣pound-water of Worm-wood, of the London-Dis∣pensatory.\n\nCarthamus, or Ba∣stard-Saffron.\n\nThe Flowers bruis'd are used instead of Sauce; and they colour the Meat of a Saffron-co∣lour.\n\ndescription Page 227\n\nThey loosen the Bel∣ly, and are good in the Jaundice. But the chief use of the Flowers is, for dying of Silks and Cloth. Some adulterate Saffron, by mixing it with these Flowers. The Seed of it bruis'd, and taken in Broth, purges clammy Flegm by Vomit and Stool; upon which Account it is rec∣kon'd amongst Flegma∣goges. 'Tis very good for the Breast, and is excel∣lent for expelling Wind; wherefore it is very good for Cholicks, and an Ana∣sarca. But it is offensive to the Stomach, and there∣fore Stomachicks ought to be mix'd with it; as An∣nise-seeds, Galangal, Cin∣namon, and the like. The Operation of it should be quicken'd, by adding things that are acrid; as Carda∣moms, Ginger, Sal Gem∣mae, and the like. The Dose of it, in Infusion, is from three Drams to six. Hofmannus says, the Husk should be taken off with a Knife, tho' it be difficult; for the beating of it with a Pestle, loses the Oyly Sub∣stance, wherein the Virtue lies. The Electuary, cal∣led Diacarthamum, of the London-Dispensatory. Take of the Species of Diatraga∣canth frigid half an Ounce, of the Pulp of Preserv'd Quinces one Ounce, of the Marrow of the Seeds of the Bastard-Saffron half an Ounce, of White Ginger two Drams, of Diagrydi∣um powder'd a-part, three Drams, of White Turbith six Drams, of Manna two Ounces, of Solutive Hony of Roses strain'd, and Sugar-candy, each one Ounce; of Hermodactils half an ounce, of White Sugar, boyl'd to the Consistence of a solid Ele∣ctuary, ten Ounces and an half; when it is hot, mix with it the Hony, Manna, and the Pulp of Quinces; then add the Powders, and make a solid Electuary, to be form∣ed into Tablets.\n\nCassia Fistula Alexan∣drina, in English Ordinary Purging Cassia.\n\nThe Egyp∣tians use to walk in a Morn∣ing where Cassia grows, especially at Sun-rising, for then the Cassia smells very pleasantly. The Pulp of Cassia purges Choler, and\n\ndescription Page 228\n\nwatery Humours. 'Tis good in outward and in∣ward Heats. It attempe∣rates the Blood, and ren∣ders it more pure. It won∣derfully helps Diseases of the Breast, occasion'd by a Distillation of sharp Hu∣mours. The Egyptians use the Pulp, with Sugar-can∣dy and Liquorish, for Dis∣eases of the Bladder and Reins. And by the fre∣quent use of it, they pre∣serve themselves from the Stone; three Drams of it being taken three Hours before Dinner. But Fallo∣pius and Fabritius Hildanus think it is not safe giving of it in Heat of Urine; for they say it increases the Disease, by drawing Wa∣ter to the Part affected. Two Inconveniences at∣tend the use of it: It dis∣solves the Tone of the Sto∣mach by its Moisture, and then it breeds Wind; wherefore it is not to be used to those that have moist Stomachs, or are Hy∣pondriacal, or troubl'd with Wind, unless it be correct∣ed by Carminatives, or Stomachicks; as, with Cin∣namon, Mastick, or the like. But Hofmannus says, 'tis best not to use it in Hypo∣chondriacal People, by rea∣son of the Weakness of their Intestines. Cassia is used for all Coughs, Difficulty of Breathing, and an Asth∣ma. 'Tis used outwardly in hot Pains of the Joints. Pains of the Head after Eating are best cured by taking Cassia after Eating. Cassia is made much use of in the Purging Electuaries of the London-Dispensatory. Extract of Cassia for Cly∣sters is made in the follow∣ing manner: Take of the Leaves of Violets, Mal∣lows, Beets, Mercury, Pe∣litory of the Wall, Flowers of Violets, each one Hand∣ful; make a Decoction in a sufficient quantity of Wa∣ter, (adding at the end the Flowers of Violets) where∣by the Cassia may be ex∣tracted, and the Canes wash'd within; then take of the Cassia extracted by this Decoction, and boyl'd to a Consistence, one Pound; of Brown Sugar one Pound and an half; boyl them up to an Electuary, according to Art. The Electuary cal∣led Dia-Cassia, with Manna,\n\ndescription Page 229\n\nis made in the following manner: Take of Da∣mask-Prunes two Ounces, of the Flowers of Violets one Ounce and an half, of Fountain-water a Pint and an half; boyl them accor∣ding to Art, till half is con∣sum'd; strain it, and dis∣solve in it, of the Pulp of Cassia six Ounces; of Vio∣let-Sugar and Syrup of Vi∣olets, each four Ounces; of the Pulp of Tamarinds one Ounce; of Sugar-can∣dy one Ounce and an half, of the best Manna two Ounces; mingle them, and make an Electuary accord∣ing to Art: 'Tis a good, cooling Purge. Cassia ex∣tracted without Sena: Take of Prunes number Twelve, of the Leaves of Violets one Handful, of Barly cleans'd, and the Seeds of Annise, and of Bastard-Saffron, and of Polypody of the Oak, each five Drams; of Maiden-hair, Thyme, and Dodder, each half an Handful; of Rai∣sins stoned half an Ounce, of the Seeds of Fennel two Drams, of the Seeds of Purslain and Mallows, each three Drams; of Liquorish half an Ounce; make a Decoction of these in a suf∣ficient quantity of Water; in the strain'd Liquor dis∣solve two Pounds of the Pulp of Cassia, and one Ounce of Tamarinds; add three Drams of Cinnamon, and one Pound of the best Sugar; boyl it to the Con∣sistence of an Electuary. This is good when the Bo∣dy is Feverish; for it cools, and purges gently. An Ounce and an half of it may be taken at a time. Cassia is an Ingredient in the Lenitive Electuary of the London-Dispensatory. 'Tis made in the following manner: Take of Raisins stoned, of Polypody of the Oak fresh, Oriental Sena, each two Ounces; of Mer∣cury one Handful and an half; of Jujubes and Sebe∣stenes, each number Twen∣ty five; of Maiden-hair, of Violets, and of Barly cleans'd, each one Hand∣ful; of Damask-Prunes and Tamerinds, each six Drams; of Liquorish half an Ounce; boyl them ac∣cording to Art, in five Quarts of Water, to the Consumption of a third\n\ndescription Page 230\n\npart; then strain them out hard: In part of the Li∣quor dissolve of the Pulp of Cassia and Tamerinds, and of fresh Prunes, and of Vio∣let-Sugar, each six Ounces; in the other part of the Li∣quor dissolve two Pounds of fine Sugar; Lastly, add an Ounce and an half of the Powder of Sena, and two Drams of the Powder of Annise-seeds, for every Pound of the Electuary; and so make an Electuary according to Art. It cools, and purges gently. An Ounce, or an Ounce and and half may be taken at a time.\n\nCassidony:\n\nSee Stoe∣chas.\n\nCassummuniar.\n\nTo give a Description of the Herb, its Place, its Growth, whether it bears any Flow∣er or Seed, is not in my power; having receiv'd no Account along with it from my Brother, Factor to the Honourable East-In∣dia Company. Only, thus much is most certain; 'tis a Plant esteem'd even by Princes themselves; some part of what I have being taken out of the King of Golconda's Garden, one of the greatest and wealthiest Princes in India. And the Priests, who are the Brack∣mannes of the Pythagorean Sect of Phylosophers, do many and great Cures with it; for which they are much esteem'd, not only by the Natives, but also by Foreign Merchants that re∣side there; the English them∣selves preferring them be∣fore their own Country∣men, when they labour un∣der those Diseases that reign in the East-Indians. They are very excellent Bota∣nists, admirably skill'd in the Nature and Use of Plants; and having an extraordinary Variety of them, have improv'd Gale∣nical Physick to a very great heighth. I do not understand that they are acquainted with any of the Chymical Ways, of sepa∣rating the pure from the impure Parts; nor are they acquainted with the use of Minerals: But as they are nourish'd by the Product of the Earth, so they are cured by the Off-spring thereof:\n\ndescription Page 231\n\nNot feeding upon any Ani∣mal kill'd for their use, fearing they should eat some of their Ancestors, because they hold a Trans∣migration of Souls. This Root, tho' it might serve to Aromatize their Diet, and is certainly a good Stoma∣chick, yet they use it only Medicinally; and that in so homely a Way, as is be∣coming such plain and sim∣ple Men, unacquainted with the Confectioner's or Apothecary's Art. They cut the Root transverse, or cross-ways; and having so done, they dry it in the Sun with great Care; and when they have Occasion to use it, they grind it betwixt two Stones, adding Water to it; after the manner of Painters grinding their Co∣lours: Being reduc'd here∣by to the Consistence of an Electuary, they administer two or three Drams of it at a time to their Patients. As to its Qualities, 'tis mo∣derately hot, and very a∣stringent. It consists of ve∣ry fine Parts; wrap'd up in, and tied to an Earthy Matter; and may be rec∣kon'd amongst Aromata, or Spices. It exceedingly re∣cruits the Animal and Vital Spirits; and may well be imagin'd to be Aperitive. By the Experience I have had of it, I find it admira∣bly to agree with the Ani∣mal Spirits, and a proper Remedy against their Irre∣gularities. With Spirit of Wine I have drawn a good Spirit from it, and with the remaining Faeces made a very good Extract; and conceive, its Extract made with Fountain-water may be better than the Powder in the Bloody-Flux, for which it is an excellent Re∣medy. The Spirit is good to mix with Cordials. It is a very good Medicine, outwardly used; and will lay Scents better than any thing yet found out. 'Tis much commended by Do∣ctor John Peachie of Glou∣cester, (who wrote this Ac∣count of it) for Apople∣xies, Convulsions, Fits of the Mother, and the like. He used to foment the Head with the Spirit, and to give inwardly the fol∣lowing Medicine: Take of Cassummuniar powder'd two Ounces, of the Con∣serves\n\ndescription Page 232\n\nof the Flowers of Betony one Ounce; make an Electuary according to Art, with a sufficient quan∣tity of Syrup of Peony: Let the Patient take the quantity of a Nutmeg thrice a Day, drinking up∣on it four Ounces of the following Julap: Take of the Waters of the Flowers of the Lime-tree, and of Black-berries, each half a Pint; of the Compound Spirit of Lavender three Ounces, a sufficient quan∣tity of Syrup of Peony; mingle them. He says, many have been cured of Head-diseases by this Me∣dicine. Mr. Marlow, in King-street, near Guild-Hall, an excellent Apothe∣cary, and a curious Man, shew'd me Cassummuniar, and confirm'd the Use and Virtues above-mention'd.\n\nChina.\n\n'Tis good for the French-Pox, which some say, it cures, without observing a strict Diet, in a short time, and with pleasure; wherefore it is much esteem'd by the In∣dians. Garsia wrote a whole Book of the Virtue and Use of this Root. 'Tis most commonly used in De∣coctions; and one or two Ounces is sufficient for nine Pints of Water. 'Tis good for all Diseases that require Sweating. 'Tis u∣sed in the Palsie, for Pains in the Joints, the Hip-Gout, the Gout, Scirrhous and Edematous Tumors, and for the King's-Evil. It strengthens the Stomach when weak, eases invete∣rate Pains in the Head, doth good for the Stone, and Ulcers of the Bladder; cures the Jaundice, and Humoral and Windy Rup∣tures. 'Tis a great Pro∣vocative to Venery. And Fallopius says, Men grow fat by the use of it. The Turks, who love to have their Wives in good Case, diet them with a Decoction of this Root. Take of the Roots of China three Oun∣ces, Sarsaperilla six Oun∣ces, Saxifrage one Ounce, of Nephritick Wood two Ounces, of Harts-horn and Ivory rasp'd, each half an Ounce; of White Sanders half an Ounce; of the Roots of Parsly, Grass, Knee-holm, each one\n\ndescription Page 233\n\nOunce; of Liquorish two Ounces, of Dates ston'd number Six, of Caraways and Coriander-seeds, each three Drams; infuse them in seven Quarts of Foun∣tain-water, boyl it accord∣ing to Art, and Aromatize it with Woody Cassia. This is used for the French Pox. Take of the Roots of China two Ounces, of Sarsaperilla six Ounces, of all the Sanders, each three Drams; of Saxifrage ten Drams; infuse them in four Quarts of Fountain-water for twelve Hours, and then, adding of the Leaves of Agrimony two Handfuls, of the Leaves of Speed-well three Handfuls, of Scabious one Handful, of the Seeds of Sweet-Fen∣nel and Caraways, each three Drams; of Raisins of the Sun ston'd six Ounces, boyl it to the Consumption of the third part; strain the Liquor, and use it for your ordinary Drink. This is much used in the King's Evil. China grows plenti∣fully in China, and in Ma∣labar, and in many other places.\n\nChiches, or Chich-pease, in Latin Cicer sativum.\n\nChich-pease are three-fold, White, Red, and Black. The Ancients commonly fed upon them, as do the Italians now at this Day. They eat them raw, as well as boyl'd; but they are best boyl'd, and when they are green, as are Pease and Beans, but they are windy. They provoke Ve∣nery; they cleanse, open, incide, digest, provoke U∣rine, and lessen the Stone; but they hurt the Bladder when it is ulcerated. They gently move the Belly. The Broth of them doth good in the Jaundice. A Decoction of them kills Worms, moves the Cour∣ses, expels the Child, and breeds Milk. In Cata∣plasms they cure the Swel∣lings under the Ears, called Parotides, and Inflamma∣tions of the Testicles, and Malignant Ulcers. We most commonly make use of them only in Difficulty of Urine: But Practitio∣ners should take care that they do not use them too often to those that have Ul∣cers in those Parts. They\n\ndescription Page 234\n\nare sown every where in Italy, Spain and France. Take of the Root of Li∣quorish four Scruples, of Marsh-mallows, Grass and Rest-harrow, each half an Ounce; of the Berries of Winter-Cherries, number Twenty, of Red Chick-pease four Ounces, of Cur∣rants one Ounce, of the four greater Cold Seeds one Scruple, of Barly two Handfuls; boyl them in the Water of Winter-Cher∣ries, Rest-harrow, Straw∣berries, and Flowers of Beans, each one Pint and on half; to the strain'd Li∣quor add four Ounces of the Syrup of Marsh-mal∣lows. A Person that was grievously afflicted with the Stone in the Bladder, was much reliev'd by ta∣king of this Decoction dai∣ly, for the space of seven∣teen Weeks.\n\nCinnamon, in Latin Cinnamomum.\n\nThe Diver∣sity of the Nature of this Tree is wonderful; for, from the Bark of the Root is distill'd Camphir, and its Oyl; from the Bark of the Trunk, Oyl of Cinna∣mon; from the Leaves' Oyl of Cloves; from the Fruit, an Oyl like the Oyl of Juniper, mix'd with a little of Cinnamon and Cloves. Of these is boyl'd up a fat, thick Oyl, like Wax, fit to make Plasters, Ointments, and Candles: 'Tis hard, and clear, and of a fragrant Smell. The Inhabitants use it in Oint∣ments to ease Pain, but they dare not make Can∣dles of it; for none are permitted to use Candles, besides the King of the Country. The Leaves of it smell more like Cloves than Cinnamon. The Bark of the Root given in a De∣coction, or the Powder of it taken with Sugar and Hony, is good for a Cough. The Bark of the Twigs used in a Decoction, is good for the Wind. The same given in Powder, with hot Water, eases the Pain of the Belly, and stops a Flux arising from Cold. Our People use it success∣fully, boyl'd in Milk, or Posset-drink, to stop a Loos∣ness. A Decoction of it in Red Wine stops an immo∣derate Flux of the Courses.\n\ndescription Page 235\n\nThe Juice of the Leaves given with Sugar and Pep∣per, do good for Pains of the Belly, and the Flatu∣lent Matter of the Reins. The Powder of the Leaves, with Sugar, are good for Giddiness; of the Head: As also are the Flowers, taken with Sugar, in cold Water. The Oyl which is drawn from the Bark of the Root hath many excellent Vir∣tues: 'Tis very good in all Paralytick Diseases, being used outwardly in time. 'Tis a present Remedy for the Gout, presently asswa∣ging the violent Pain of the Parts, as soon as they are anointed with it. It doth also good, taken inwardly. 'Tis also of excellent use, taken inwardly, for curing an Asthma, and other Dis∣eases of the Lungs. 'Tis also good to correct the Malignity of Fevers. It forces Sweat; and is very proper to be used in Gan∣grens, Mortifications, and Malignant Ulcers; for Pains of the Limbs, of the Belly, and of the Eyes; and for Tumors of the Members, proceeding from Cold and Flegmatick Hu∣mours. It restores the Sense of Parts that are stupified. 'Tis good for Rheums. The Oyl of the Bark of the Tree is good for Diseases of the Stomach, and for the Gripes. The Water of Cinnamon is counted Cordial. The Oyl of the Leaves is good in the Cholick, and very pro∣per in the Palsie. Cinna∣mon is good for all Obstru∣ctions, and for Diseases of the Breast. Oyl or Essence of Cinnamon, and its Ae∣therial-water, is made in the following manner: Bruise four Pounds of good Cinnamon, and infuse it in six Quarts of hot Water; leave it in digestion in an Earthen Vessel, well stop'd, two Days; pour the Infu∣sion into a large Copper Limbeck, and fitting a Re∣ceiver to it, and luting close the Junctures with a wet Bladder, distil with a pret∣ty good Fire three or four Pints of the Liquor; then unlute the Limbeck, and pour into it by Inclination the distil'd Waters; you will find at bottom a little Oyl, which you must pour into a Viol, and stop it\n\ndescription Page 236\n\nclose; distil the Liquor as before; then returning the Water into the Limbeck, take the Oyl you find at the bottom of the Receiver, and mix it with the first: Repeat this Cohobation, until there rises no more Oyl; then take away the Fire. Tincture of Cinna∣mon is made in the follow∣ing manner: Take what quantity of bruised Cinna∣mon you please, put it into a Matrass, and pour upon it Spirit of Wine, one Fin∣gure above it; stop your Matrass close, and set it in Digestion in Horse-dung four or five Days; the Spi∣rit of Wine will be impreg∣nated with the Tincture of Cinnamon, and become red; separate it from the Cinnamon, and after it is filtrated, keep the Tincture in a Viol well stop'd. 'Tis an admirable Cardiack; it fortifies the Stomach, and rejoyces all the Vital Parts. It may be used like Cinna∣mon-water, in a little smaller Dose. Cinnamon-water is made in the fol∣lowing manner: Take of bruised Cinnamon a Pound and an half, Spanish Wine a Quart; infuse the Cin∣namon in the Wine twenty four Hours, then distil them in a Limbeck; draw off three Pints of Strong-water, sweeten'd with Su∣gar, and keep it for use. 'Tis good in a weak Sto∣mach, and is Cordial. Sy∣rup of Cinnamon of the London-Dispensatory is made in the following manner: Take of the best Cinna∣mon, beaten a little, three Ounces; infuse it three Days in hot Fountain-wa∣ter, afterwards distil it in B. M. take a Pint of this Water; of Clarified Sugar, boyl'd over a gentle Fire, to the Consistence of Tab∣lets, have a Pound: Make a Syrup. The Cinnamon-tree and the Cassia-tree seem to be the same. The Cinnamon-tree grows as commonly in the Island of Zeiland, in the Hedges and Woods, as the Hazel-tree doth in our Country; and the Inhabitants value it no more; for they commonly make Fires of it, and cut it for any common use.\n\nCommon Cinque-foil, or Five-leav'd Grass, in La∣tin\n\ndescription Page 237\n\nPentaphyllum Vulgatissi∣mum.\n\n'Tis Vulnerary, and Astringent. It stops Fluxes of the Belly, Bleeding at Nose, and the Hemor∣rhoids. 'Tis good for Spit∣ting of Blood, and a Cough. 'Tis also commended for a Palsie, a Consumption, the Gout, and Jaundice. 'Tis also reckon'd good for the Stone, and Erosions of the Kidnies; for Ruptures and Fevers. 'Tis used outward∣ly for the Eyes, when they are inflam'd, the Juice of it being drop'd into them: And also for Loosness of the Teeth, and putrid Gums. It cleanses also ma∣lignant Ulcers. The A∣stringent Virtue of it is most remarkable, by means whereof it does what it does. One Dram of the Powder of the Root, taken before the Fit, cures A∣gues. Spon. in his Book of Fevers and Febrifuges, says, that Cinquefoil is a Plant somewhat bitter, and very astringent; whereby it strengthens the Fibres of the Stomach, relax'd by a Fever, and fixes and sweet∣ens its Acid. Hippocrates used this Plant to cure Fe∣vers. But, without doubt, it was more effectual in Greece, where Hippocrates liv'd, than here: For, most Plants have more Virtue in hot Countries, than in cold; especially those that are somewhat Aromatick. It has also been found by Experience, that the Roots of it cure Ulcers of the Mouth.\n\nCitrons, in Latin Ma∣lus Citria.\n\nEvery part of the Citron, the outward and inward Bark, the Juice and Pulp, and the Seeds, are of great use in Physick. The outward yellow Bark hath a curious Aromatick Smell, and bitter Taste. Being dried, it is very Cor∣dial, and Alexipharmick. It heats and corroborates a cold and windy Stomach. It discusses Wind powerful∣ly, concocting and digest∣ing crude Humours that are contain'd in the Sto∣mach or Bowels. Being chewed in the Mouth, it cures a Stinking Breath, promotes Concoction of the Meat, and is good for Melancholy. 'Tis much commended for Hypochon∣driacal\n\ndescription Page 238\n\nDiseases, for Va∣pours, Wind, the Palpita∣tion of the Heart, Obstru∣ctions and Weakness of the Bowels. The Powder of the outward Bark of O∣ranges and Limons is rec∣kon'd good for the same. Being candied; 'tis used for Second Courses: And mix∣ed with Cordial Electua∣ries, 'tis used against Con∣tagion. It loosens the Bel∣ly; upon which Account an Electuary is made of it, called the Solutive Electu∣ary of Citron; good to evacuate Flegmatick and Cold Humours. It may be also safely given when Choler is mix'd with Flegm. The Pulp or Juice, tho' it be not so acid as the Juice of Limons, yet▪ is it much more cooling than that. 'Tis very proper in Burn∣ing and Pestilential Fevers, to quench Thirst, to sup∣press too great a Fermenta∣tion of the Blood, to re∣create the Spirits, and quic∣ken the Appetite. 'Tis al∣so reckon'd good for a Gid∣diness in the Head. The Seeds are Cord••••l and Ale∣xipharmick; are good for the Biting of Scorpions, and other venomous Crea∣tures. They strengthen the Heart, and defend it from the Contagion of the Plague and Small-Pox. They kill the Worms of the Stomach and Bowels, provoke the Courses, and cause Abor∣tion. They digest crude and watery Humours, and dry them up both within and without. There is a strange Story of two that were condemn'd to be de∣stroy'd by Serpents; and as they were passing to Execution, by chance, a Person that had a Citron in his Hand, gave it them to eat, and soon after they were flung to the Serpents, and were much bit by them, but their Poyson made no Impression upon them, and the Men esca∣ped with their Lives. Up∣on this, Enquiry was made what they had eat or drunk? And a Citron be∣ing the only thing that had been given them, 'twas or∣der'd, one of them should eat a Citron the next Day, and that then they should be expos'd again to the Serpents: He that had eat∣en the Citron escap'd, as\n\ndescription Page 239\n\nbefore; the other soon pe∣rish'd. And afterwards it was found by many Expe∣riments, that Citron was good against Poyson. The Solutive Electuary of Ci∣tron, of the London-Dispen∣satory, is made in the fol∣lowing manner: Take of Citron-peel candied, of Conserve of the Flowers of Violets and Bugloss, of the Species of Diatragacanth frigid, and of Diagrydium▪ each half an Ounce; of Turbith five Drams, of Ginger half a Dram, of the Leaves of Sena six Drams, of the Seeds of Sweet-Fen∣nel one Dram, of White Sugar dissolv'd in Rose-water, and boyl'd up ac∣cording to Art, ten Oun∣ces; beat in a Brass-Mor∣tar the Turbith and Gin∣ger, (being first cut small) the Sena, Fennel, and the Diagrydium must be poun∣ded a-part, and must be mix'd with a little of the Powder of Diatragacanth made fresh; the Bark of the Citron must be pound∣ed in a Marble-Mortar; then add the Conserves, pulp'd through a fine Sieve, and boyl'd a little in the Sugar dissolv'd; take it off the Fire, and when it is just warm put in the Powders, and last of all the Diagry∣dium and the Diatraga∣canth; and of this Paste make Tablets. Syrup of the Juice of Citrons, of the London-Dispensatory, is made in the following manner: Take of the Juice of Ci∣trons strain'd one Pint, let it stand till it is clear; add to it of White Sugar clari∣fied, and boyl'd to the Con∣sistence of Tablets, two Pounds; make a Syrup by boyling of it just up, and no more. Syrup of the Bark of Citrons is made in the following manner: Take of the yellow Peel of Citrons, ripe and fresh, five Ounces; of the Grains of Kerms, or of their Juice, two Drams, of Fountain-water three Pints; infuse them all Night in B. M. strain it, add two Pounds and an half of White Sugar, and boyl it to a Syrup, accord∣ing to Art, in B. M. Half of it must be without Musk; the other half must be Aromatiz'd with three Grains of Musk, tied up in a Rag.\n\ndescription Page 240\n\nCitruls, in Latin Ci∣trullus.\n\nThe Fruit of it is cold and moist, and very fit to quench the Thirst; wherefore the Italians re∣fresh themselves in Sum∣mer-time with the Pulp of it. 'Tis good in Burning Fevers, and for a dry Tongue. The Seed of it is one of the Greater Cold Seeds.\n\nCloves, in Latin Caryo∣phyllus Aromaticus.\n\nCloves heat and dry. The In∣dians, two Days before they sell their Cloves, place a large Vessel of Water in the Room where the Cloves are; and it all soon evapo∣rates, and goes into the Cloves; and so the weight of them is much increas'd. Cloves perfume the Breath; for which Reason the In∣dian Women frequently chew them, and such like things. They are said to clear the Sight, and to take off Clouds from the Eyes. They strengthen the Sto∣mach, and take off Vo∣miting and Nauseousness. They provoke Venery, and are good for all cold Dis∣eases of the Brain; as, A∣poplexies, Lethargies, Pal∣sie, or the like. They are used to correct the Air, by being burnt or eaten. But the chief use of them is in the Kitchin, for Sauces, and the like. They are also used to perfume Clothes, an Orange being stuck full of them, and put into the Chest to the Clothes. Some put them into Wine or Beer, and they impart to it a pleasant Smell and Taste. They are put into a Bag, or sow'd up in a Cloth, and worn upon the Stomach, to stop Vomiting, and to take off Pains of the Stomach, proceeding from a cold Cause. Some pow∣der their Heads with the Powder of them, to take off Dulness and Pains of the Head. Cloves candied, taste very pleasantly, and are proper for a cold Sto∣mach. Oyl of Cloves by Distillation is good for in∣ward and outward use. Oyl of Cloves, per descen∣sum, is made in the follow∣ing manner. Take several large Drinking-glasses, co∣ver them with a Linnen Cloth, and tie it round each of them, leaving a\n\ndescription Page 241\n\nCavity in each Cloth, to put the powder'd Cloves into; set a small Earthen Cup upon each Glass of these Cloves, let it stop so ••••••ly, that it may suffer no Air to enter between its Brim and that of the Glass; fill the Cups with hot Ashes, to warm the Cloves, and distil down to the bottom of the Glasses first a little Flegm and Spirit, and af∣ter that a clear and white Oyl; continue the Fire, until there falls no more; separate the Oyl in a Tun∣nel lined with a Cornet of Brown Paper, and keep it in a Viol well stop'd. Some Drops of it are, with Cotton, put into aching Teeth. 'Tis likewise good in Malignant Fevers, and the Plague. The Dose is two or three Drops in Balm-water, or some ap∣propriate Liquor. You must mix it with a little Sugar-candy, or a little Yolk of an Egg, before you drop it into the Wa∣ter, otherwise it will not dissolve in the Water. I have given you this Pre∣paration, to serve upon an Emergency, when you want, in haste, the Oyl of Cloves. You must only use hot Ashes to warm the Cloves, if you desire White Oyl; for, if you give a greater Heat, the Oyl turns red; and besides, a great part of it will be lost. You must also take care to lift up the Cup from time to time, to stir about the Powder. Some do dissolve Opium in Oyl of Cloves, and use this Dissolution for the Tooth-ach; they put one Drop of it into the ach∣ing Tooth and it soon takes off the Pain. The Spirit of Cloves, which is made at the same time the Oyl is made, is a good Stomachick: It helps Con∣coction, comforts the Heart, and increases Seed. The Dose is, from six Drops to twenty, in some convenient Liquor. Cloves grow spon∣taneously in the Moloca-Islands. Those that are good are black, solid and weighty, smell well, are hard to break, and bite the Tongue much; and when they are broken their Liquor sweats out. They may be kept five Years in a temperate place.\n\ndescription Page 242\n\nCoccus Baphica.\n\nSee Kermes.\n\nCockle, in Latin Pseu∣domelanthium.\n\nIt grows every where amongst Corn and Flowers, in June and July. It cures the Itch, and heals Wounds ann Fi∣stula's, and stops Blood. But the Virtues of it are doubted by some: Yet Sennertus commends it in Stopping of Bleeding.\n\nCoco-Nut-tree, in La∣tin Palma Coccifera.\n\nA Li∣quor is drawn from this Tree, called Suri, which intoxicates like Wine▪ It hath a pleasant, sweet Taste. An hot Water, or Spirit, is drawn from it by Distillation. Sugar also, and Vinegar is made of it. Fine polish'd Cups, tip'd with Silver, are made of the Bark of it. The Li∣quor, or Wine, is very good for Consumptions, and excellent for Diseases of the Urine and Reins. A Milk is drawn from the Kernels beat and press'd, without the help of Fire, which is very good for kil∣ling Worms, eight Ounces of it being taken in a Morning, with a little Salt. The Liquor contain'd in the Kernel extinguishes Thirst, cures Fevers, clens∣es the Eyes and the Skin, purifies the Blood, purges the Stomach and Urinary Passages, relieves the Breast, tastes pleasantly, and yields a great Nourishment. 'Tis said of it, that it is Meat, Drink and Cloth. Choco∣let is made of it. It grows in the Spanish West-In∣dies, and laste an hundred Years.\n\nCoculus Indus.\n\n'Tis un∣certain where these Berries grow; but the chief use of them is for catching Fish, a Paste being made for them of White Flower and the Powder of the Berries: For the Fish, by eating of this Paste, become giddy and stupid, and so are easi∣ly taken: But it is questi∣onable whether Fish so ta∣ken may be safely eaten; perhaps if they are gutted as soon as they are taken, and boyl'd, they may be eaten without hurt. A Per∣son who went to buy Cu∣bebs of an Apothecary, had\n\ndescription Page 243\n\nthese Berries deliver'd to him by a Mistake; and when he had taken not above four of them, he was presently seiz'd with a Vomiting, the Hiccups, and Faintness: But a Vomit being presently given him, he recover'd within an Hour.\n\nCoffee, in Latin Caova.\n\nThe Decoction of it strengthens a cold Stomach, helps Concoction, and o∣pens Obstructions of the Bowels, and is good for cold Tumors of the Liver and Spleen. It heats the Womb, and frees it from Obstructions: Upon which Account, the Egyptian and Arabian Women use it fre∣quently. But it is most ta∣ken notice of for removing Drowsiness. But tho it be so commonly used, and so very proper and effectual in some Cases; yet in other Cases perhaps it may be hurtful, or, at least, not so beneficial: For it is com∣monly observ'd, that Cof∣fee-drinkers are often very lean, and become Parali∣tick, and impotent as to Venery. But, indeed, in most Diseases of the Head, as, for Giddiness, Head-aches, Lethargies, Catarrhs, and the like, Coffee is often used with good Success by those that are of a gross Habit of Body, and of a cold Constitution, and whose Blood is watery, their Brains moist, and their Animal Spirits dull; for, being taken daily, it wonderfully clears the Spi∣rits, and dissipates those Clouds of all the Functions. But on the contrary, they who are of a thin Habit of Body, and an hot and melancholy Constitution, ought, by all means, to forbear Coffee. And be∣sides, those that have but weak Spirits, or are subject to a Trembling, or Num∣ness of the Limbs, ought not to drink Coffee, tho' they are afflicted with the Head-ach: Nor ought they who are subject to the Pal∣pitation of the Heart. 'Tis reckon'd good in a Scorbu∣tick Gout, and for the Gra∣vel. The Goodness of Cof∣fee chiefly depends on the exact roasting of it. Ber∣nier says, there were only two Men that knew how\n\ndescription Page 244\n\nto roast them right in Grand Cayro. For few know the manner and degree of Tor∣rifaction; for if they are never so little over or un∣der-roasted, they are spoyl∣ed. Coffee is adulterated with burnt Crusts of Bread, roasted Beans▪ and the like. 'Tis commonly boyl'd in Copper or Tin-Pots, but Ear••hen are best for it, for it is probable that Metals too often impart something of their Substance to the Liquor. It hath been ob∣serv'd that, upon Distilla∣tion, a Pound of good clean Coffee, the Vessels being well luted, hath yielded four Ounces and an half of Flegm, with a little Vola∣tile Spirit, mix'd with Salt; and two Ounces and five Drams of a thick, black Oyl, which being rectified, became yellow; the Caput mortuum weighed about four Ounces; so that about a fourth part evaporated, notwithstanding the Vessels were so closely cemented. Upon which, we may rea∣sonably conjecture, that Coffee contains many Par∣ticles that are Volatile and Penetrative; whereby it is probable it keeps Men wa∣king. Many that have been very subject to Ne∣phritick Pains have been cured by taking Coffee of∣ten. Women use it to cleanse the Teeth. One that was seiz'd with a vio∣lent Cholera, and painful Convulsions, from an In∣ternal Cause, was cured in a short time, by taking a great quantity of Coffee; which was retain'd in the Stomach, when the Tin∣cture of Opium, Mint-water, and the like, were vomited up. This little Tree grows only in that part of Arabia Foelix which is situated betwixt the Tro∣picks: And the Arabians take such Care that it should not be planted any where else, that they de∣stroy the Vegetative Virtue of the Seed, either by boyl∣ing or burning it, before they will part with it out of their Hands. And they are much in the right; for they get infinite Treasure by this one Commodity: Upon which Account, at least, it may be called Ara∣bia Foelix. No one can imagine how many Thou∣sand\n\ndescription Page 245\n\nBushels of it are ex∣ported yearly. 'Tis fre∣quently used through all the Provinces of the Turkish Empire. Vestingius says, there are some Thousands of Coffee-houses in Grand Cayre. And it is as com∣monly used in Africa and Barbery, and lately in Eu∣rope. Certainly in England the King hath a great Re∣venue by it, for I believe there may be now as many Coffee-houses in London as in Grand Cayre. Besides, in other Parts of England there is scarce a Town of Note, but hath one or more Cof∣fee-houses in it.\n\nColoquintida, in Latin Colocynthis.\n\n'Tis a violent Medicine: It purges thick and glutinous Flegm, and other Humours, from the remotest parts of the Body; as, from the Head, Nerves, Joints, and the like; for which reason it is commended, and is used successfully for inveterate Head-aches, an Apoplexy, Falling-sickness, Vertigo, Asthma, Cough, cold Diseases of the Joints, Flatulent Cholicks, a Drop∣sie, and the like. But be∣fore it is used it ought to be well powder'd, and fat and Lubricating things ought to be mix'd with it, to attemperate the Acrimo∣ny of it. 'Tis an Ingre∣dient of the Pill Cochiae ma∣jores and minores, and of the Pill Rudii, of the Pill E¦duobus, and of the Fetid Pill, and of the Pill of Her∣modactils, and of some others. The Troches of Alhandel are made of it, in the following manner: Take of the Pulp of Colo∣quintida that is white and smooth, and freed from the Seeds, and cut small, and well rub'd with Oyl of Sweet Almonds, and at two Days end finely pow∣der'd, ten Ounces; of the Gums Arabeck, Traga∣canth and Bdellium, each six Drams; infuse the Gums for three or four Days, in a sufficient quan∣tity of Rose-water, till they are quite melted; and then with the said Pulp, and part of the Musilage of the Gums▪ make Troches, which must be dried in the Shade, and made up again with the rest of the Musi∣lage.\n\ndescription Page 246\n\nContrayerva, in Latin Drakena radix.\n\nThe Root of it is Alexipharmick. The Powder of it is an ex∣cellent Remedy against all Poysons, except Sublimate: It expels Worms, and cures Agues. Clusius gave it the Name of Drakena, because Sir Francis Drake gave it him. Take of the Pow∣der of the Roots of Con∣trayerna, Virginian-Snake∣weed, and Butter-bur, each one Dram; of Cochinelle, and Saffron, each half a Dram; mingle them, and make a Powder. The Dose is half a Dram, in a con∣venient Vehicle. This is a sweating Medicine, and is proper to expel Malig∣nity.\n\nCoral, in Latin Coral∣lium.\n\n'Tis of a stony, dense Substance, and looks very fine when it is po∣lish'd. 'Tis commonly be∣liev'd that it is soft when it is under Water, but that is a vulgar Error; for those who fish for it say, that it is as hard and stony under Water as it is above, only it is cover'd with a soft, Mossy Bark. It hath an astringent Virtue, espe∣cially when it is burnt, and reduc'd to a Powder. It stops all Fluxes of the Bel∣ly, and of the Womb, and the Running of the Reins; but whether it comforts the Heart, or prevents Children's Convulsions, as 'tis said, is uncertain. 'Tis used outwardly for Ulcers, which it incarns. 'Tis also used to clear the Sight. Nurses in England hang it about Children's Necks, to promote Cutting of the Teeth; for, by reason it is soft and cold, Children love to have their Gums rub'd with it; and so the Eruption of the Teeth is render'd more easie: But we do not believe it doth conduce any thing, by an occult Quality, to the easie Breeding or Cutting of the Teeth. Tincture of Coral is much commended in Pe∣stilential Fevers. Coral is prepar'd by grinding it on a Marble, to a fine Pow∣der; and this is called pre∣par'd Coral. 'Tis used for the Bloody-Flux, a Loos∣ness, the Flux of the He∣morrhoids, and the Cours∣es, and for all other Di∣stempers\n\ndescription Page 247\n\nthat are occa∣sion'd by an Acrimony of Humors, this being an Al∣cali that destroys it. The Dose is from ten Grains to a Dram, in Knot-grass-water, or some other pro∣per Liquor. Dissolution of Coral is made in the follow∣ing manner: Take what quantity you please of Co∣ral, ground fine on a Mar∣ble, put it into a large Ma∣trass, and pour upon it as much distill'd Vinegar as will rise the breadth of four Fingers above the Matter; there will hap∣pen a great Effervescency, which being over, set it in Digestion in warm Sand for two Days, stirring the Matrass from time to time; leave the Coral to settle at bottom, and decant the clear Liquor into a Bottle: Pour again so much distill'd Vinegar on the Remainder as before, and leave it two Days in Digestion; sepa∣rate the clear Liquor, and continue to add more di∣still'd Vinegar, and to draw off the Impregnation, until all the Coral is in a man∣ner dissolv'd; then mix your Dissolutions, and pour them into a Glass-Cucur∣bite, or else into an Earth∣en one; evapotate in Sand two thirds of the Liquor, or till there appears upon it a very fine Skin; filtrate this Impregnation, and keep it, in order to make the Salt and Majestery, as I shall shew by and by. The Dissolution may be given for the same Purpo∣ses as the Salt. The Dose is, from ten to twenty Drops, in some proper Li∣quor. Red Coral is gene∣rally used, because it is thought to have more Vir∣tue than the rest. Maje∣stery of Coral is made in the following manner: Take what quantity you please of the Impregnation of Coral, made with di∣still'd Vinegar; pour it in∣to a Viol, or Matrass, and drop into it the Liquor of the Salt of Tartar, made per Deliquium; a Curd will appear, which will precipitate to the bottom in a very white Powder; decant the clear Liquor, and wash your Powder five or six times with Water, dry it: It is that which is called the Majestery of Co∣ral.\n\ndescription Page 248\n\nGreat Virtues are at∣tributed to it: It fortifies the Heart, resists Poyson, stops the Bloody-Flux, and all other Hemorrhagies. The Dose is, from ten to thirty Grains, in some pro∣per Liquor. Salt of Coral is made in the following manner: Take what quan∣tity you please of the Dis∣solution of Coral, made of distill'd Vinegar, pour it in∣to a Glass-Cucurbite, or Earthen Pan, and evapo∣rate in Sand all the Moist∣ure; there will remain at hottom a Salt of Coral; keep it in a Viol well stop∣ped. 'Tis given for the same Reason as the Maje∣stery is: The Dose of it is less, being from five to fif∣teen Grains. Simple Syrup of Coral of the London-Dispensatory is made in the following manner: Take of Red Coral four Ounces, dissolve it with the Heat of a Bath, in a Pint of the Juice of Barberries clarifi∣ed; it must be put into a Matrass, well stop'd; and having digested it three or four Days, pour off that which is dissolv'd, and pour on more Juice, as before; and so proceed, till all the Coral is dissolv'd; add a Pound and an half of Su∣gar to one Pint of this Juice, and boyl it gently to a Syrup in B.
