        "text": "Formally known as Oriental fragrances and generally comprised of tonka bean, elegant vanilla, almond-like vanillin, nutty coumarin, leathery labdanum and sensual patchouli, amber fragrances represent a growing category of fragrance compositions our master perfumers are often asked to design and supply for a wide swath of scented product and product line manufacturers.\n\nContinue on to learn more about the family of amber fragrances and its evolution within the fragrance industry, or contact our team today for any of your amber fragrance needs!\n\nThe Fragrance Family of Amber Fragrances\n\nWhile a rose by any other name may still be a rose are just a string of words referring to the doomed Shakespearean family names of Romeo and Juliette, they have an unmistakable power in both literature and the real world.\n\nWithin the realm of fragrance, words are surprisingly potent and suggestive.\n\nAs part of a global context, terms can be misleading and sometimes inadvertently offensive. The word, ‘oriental’, presents such an example.\n\nOriginally referring to a fragrance family classification that embraced base notes such as: dark, warm and honeyed amber, creamy sandalwood, sweet, heavy and nutty coumarin, floral, powdery orris, lush vanilla and green, sugary and fresh gum resins, these sensual facets are known for their ability to linger on the skin for longer periods of time than other perfume notes.\n\nFor years, the perfume industry has categorized scents into neat, olfactory families which are commonly used by brands, retailers, and journalists.\n\nOver time, however the meanings and societal implications of words have changed, causing the mind set of perfumers to change along with them.\n\nAccording to Tania Sanchez, co-author of Perfumes: The A-Z Guid —\n\n“Orient comes from a word meaning East. The question is East of where? In this case, France, where the perfume genre was born. This vague, ever exoticized, mysterious Orient includes the Persian Iran of the carpets, the Taj Mahal of Shalimar, and what is sometimes called the Far East’s far from France, at least. China and Iran have little in common except the fact that they are East-from Europe…Perfume is a global product, made everywhere, sold everywhere. Why not use a global term?”\n\nOther Negative Implications Surrounding The Oriental Moniker\n\nThe Eurocentric term, oriental, is confusing to say the least.\n\nAccording once again to Ms Sanchez, the moniker, ‘oriental’, carries with it a prickly visual aesthetic.\n\nShe states:: “European cultures have historically fetishized and sexualized Asian people and cultures, and perfume marketing has, unfortunately, often played into this harmful fantasy.”\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. government banned the term, ‘oriental’, from use in federal law, in favor of “Asian American.”\n\nThe winds of change are in the perfumed air as marked by the support of The Fragrance Foundation.\n\nThe group’s president, Linda Levy, refers to the word, oriental, as both “outdated” and “offensive”and made the following bold statement in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar.\n\n“Every brand, fragrance house, and retailer has the freedom to determine its own language. So the term, Oriental, is not formal or official… Other terminology should definitely be applied instead.”\n\nThe Time For Change Has Come\n\nAlthough the term, ‘oriental’ was probably never intended to be offensive, times and sensibilities have changed over the years.\n\nIn the words of Arnold Zlotnik, “Our company and our teams are thrilled to be one of the many major fragrance houses embracing the language of the modern fragrance industry.”\n\nThe formerly Oriental and now Ambery family of fragrances is generally composed of exotic, coconut-like and creamy tonka bean, lush, elegant vanilla, sugary, intense and almond-like vanillin, sweet, creamy and nutty coumarin, rich, complex and leathery labdanum and sensual patchouli.\n\nResins such as sweet, smooth benzoin, aromatic frankincense or rich, sugary, balsamic opopanax are also often found in this accord. The fruity facets of iris also complement this accord very well.\n\nThe changes for the category are not monumental, but they are significant.\n\nThey are as follows:\n\nSoft Oriental Is Now Known As Soft Amber\n\nThese ethereal and elegant scents are dark and warm but less balsamic than other varieties. The mysterious allure of sacred incense and dark ruck amber predominate.\n\nFloral Oriental Will Change to Floral Amber\n\nOur perfumers create these fragrances by combining the floral properties of softness with the warmth of amber blends. Sweet spices meld with florals to formulate sensual scents of great depth and complexity.\n\nWoody Oriental Will Become Woody Amber\n\nPerfumes within this category have a lustrous element to their character that is nurtured by the inclusion of creamy, buttery sandalwood and other rich woods.\n\nOriental Spice Will Become Ambery Spice\n\nThis was the original old Old Spice back in the day, which was known as an old fashioned men’s cologne.\n\nA Short History of Ambery Fragrance\n\nThe origins of the amber ( formerly oriental) accord in perfumery is not what the word may suggest, as it does not derive from amber stone, a fossilized resin that has no smell.\n\nIt is believed that the word comes from ambergis, a substance secreted by the cachalot (sperm whale), which was used extensively in perfumes in past decades. Ambergris is still authorized by the International Fragrance Association. (IFRA) because the animal is not harmed in any way or killed.\n\nToday, however, it is mostly found in synthetic versions because its cost is prohibitive.\n\nOriental perfume dates back to the days when the world was young.\n\nAncient Greeks, Egyptians and Romans used resins, balsams and exotic spices as ingredients for sacred incense and unguents.\n\nThe first modern day perfume in this category was Shalimar by Guerlain, which was formulated in 1921 via a new synthetic molecule known as vanillin.\n\nOpening with a citrus burst of fresh lemon and spicy elegant bergamot, the heart notes were floral with aspects of haunting jasmine, romantic rose and fruity iris.\n\nCompleting base notes were a blend of rich, leathery labdanum, creamy, sugary coumarin, aromatic incense and rich, earthy and woody nuanced opoponax.\n\nThis exotic and passionate fragrance became the bulwark of a scent category that to this day holds a sense of mystery and excitement.\n\nThe fragrances within this coveted family of are always formulated around an amber accord, which is a blend of elegant vanilla and rich, complex labdanum.\n\nIt is also important to note that there is no such thing as amber essential oil.\n\nOther resinous notes that are often added to these compositions include: tonka bean or balsams to sweeten, and frankincense, myrrh and opoponax to darken the formulation.\n\nAlpha Aromatics — Amber Fragrance Design and Supply\n\nWith routes that stretch as far back as the late 1940s, we are a creator, manufacturer and purveyor of superior, custom
