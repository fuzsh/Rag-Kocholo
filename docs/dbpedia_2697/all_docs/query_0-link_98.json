        "text": "It's nickname, The Blue Beast, even if it's been reformulated, weakened, is reason enough to cause one to doubt and question what determines their tastes and what demographic they too make up. Interlude: a pause or intervening time between one thing and another. Amouage's frag, not fragrance, is nothing of the sort, instead opting to make the interlude the main event, which is an all day and tiresome affair.\n\nUnapologetically, Amouage's Interlude Man reminds me of a much nicer Joop! It's sweet, fairly unimaginable on a human, and very loud. Don't get me wrong. Interlude smells good, the oregano top note included. It's just that I can't imagine such a hodgepodge, supposedly Eastern mix of scent on human skin. Whereas Jubilation XXV, a fragrance I quite like, rests on fuzzy woods and musk in its base, along with a gorgeous incense, Interlude Man operates in the realm of more opaque resins, without necessarily evoking the bakhoor-fumigated spaces and ash that another Amouage, Myths Man, does.\n\nSomeone, somewhere, more than likely talked about shisha, the molasses-based tobacco used in a hookah, and I can see the analogy, so much so that I would prefer Interlude Man as a day after spray. Spraying my clothing, letting it sit overnight, and then dressing the following day, once The Blue Beast has had a chance to fade into its base notes that would require someone to hug me to smell its amalgamation of smoke and spice.\n\nMy demonic tastes include actually fumigating my clothing with incense, using oud oils, seeking out and acquiring samples and bottles of all the animalic, smoky, incense-based, Middle Eastern, scents this world has produced and yet Interlude Man does not convince. For your own sake, please don't be fooled. Almost no one can pull off this perfume. It is a good-smelling caricature of a world you don't belong to.\n\nFirst review.\n\nFelt the need to review this as I have never smelled anything like it.\n\nHad a tester, sprayed it, and though that it was the worst scent I have ever smelled. Couldn't put my finger on the smell, but thanks to a couple of other reviewers, I now know that it's turmeric.\n\nIt honesty smells like someone was walking along with a big bag of turmeric and tripped over onto a big bonfire.\n\nI know it's subjective, but this is horrible. Get a tester first.\n\nInterlude has great ingredient, great idea and great projection and longevity.\n\nIf only someone had stopped and taken a deep breath before going overboard with spices.\n\nThe idea is sound, but the execution is where they fell short.\n\nIncense, leather and spices are great but they need to be balanced out. Otherwise you end up with a dry perfume that reminds you of a summer day in desert, or in this case an oven.\n\nA good desert perfume has a promise of cool evening or rain, Interlude has no reprieve.\n\nSample it please so that you know how bleak can one get with fragrances, but please don't buy it (unless you are in that sort of mood)\n\nGenre: Woody Oriental\n\nI'm afraid I have to break with the pack on this one. Frankincense, opopanax, an oudh reconstruction that smells of burnt hair, and a whole lot of patchouli add up to a very loud, crude composition, which I really don't enjoy. This fragrance seems to have too much going on, all at once, and all at stentorian volume. The frankincense and patchouli fight one another like two mismatched paint colors, the opopanax is a bit too powdery and sweet, and the oudh just feels like superfluous decoration in a composition that's already too baroque and monumental by half. Perhaps most damaging of all is a piercing reconstructed sandalwood base note that creaks like a rusty hinge, and which has no business smelling so cheap in a fragrance that costs roughly $150 US per ounce. To my nose, this is simply one of the weakest offerings Amouage has released in years. I'd much rather wear the vastly superior Interlude Woman.\n\nseriously overpriced amber scent augmented by synthetic and off-putting oud.\n\nI received a sample of Amouage interlude but was not expecting too much of it since Amouage has tended to release less than amazing scents in the last few years. Whilst Gold and Dia are, in my opinion, worth the coin they demand, few other scents have lived up to the same level of quality. (barred the attars)\n\nInterlude too reeks of 'nice try but....nah.'\n\nIt opens indeed with a very light dash of bergamot which is immediately followed by an amber scent which reminded me of ambre russe or a lighter and more sophisticated version of montale's blue amber. Nice, but not super nice. Quite quickly this was followed by a medicinal / even petrol-like smelling scent which i guess is supposed to pass for oud. this was not the attractive kind of medicinal as we know from montale, nor was it the petrol of say a knize ten or SMN's nostalgia. Instead it came across as a far too dominant, nasty, pungent synthetic smell which i found hard to bare. To make matters worse, it is this phase and smell which is where the largest part of the silage and longevity of interlude come from.\n\nAs a fan of MPG I like my scents bold, daring, raw and edgy but Interlude came across as an overpriced amber scent with poorly chosen supporting notes that end up making an unbalanced, cloying and pungent concoction.\n\nI find very little to be attractive in this scent.\n\nI honestly don't know what happened to this scent on me.\n\ni love a LOT of Amouage fragrances especially the heavier oud, woods, incense and leather based ones such as Epic - probably my favourite fragrance at the moment. Reading the notes for Interlude prior to release in Australia I couldn't wait to get my hands on it but then I applied it sparingly as always and the opening was nice but not amazing and was waiting for the spices and dry wood accords to spring to life but then... SOUR! Not a slight animalic or medicinal note but sour like ramming tamarind paste up my nostrils. This continued for hours without the slightest of evolution.\n\nDefinitely not dry woods or incense or leather or even astringent bergamot. It was soggy wet rotten fruit for hours. My only hope is that the sample vial I was given was off somehow and I'm waiting to see if I can find another retailer that stocks it as it sounds like the exact mix of notes I was hoping for."
