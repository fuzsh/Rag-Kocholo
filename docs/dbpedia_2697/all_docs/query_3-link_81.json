        "text": "I can’t review Fraterworks perfume bases without giving a bit of background on my relationship with perfume.\n\nMy mother wore shalimar, and that was that, her signature scent- and she only wore it to go out.\n\nI grew up in the seventies in nyc and Switzerland-a great deal of cheap perfume, everything was scented, most of it bad- I loved musk from the head shops, when I was in my early 20’s , opium was it for me, wore it all time- a friend made me a perfume , and I loved it and wore it all the time- she also had a huge bottle of joy, and I liked it a lot - but I knew it was crazy expensive and special- just not something I was going to expend energy on.\n\nMy daughter ( has crazy allergies) kept buying cheap oil perfumes , online, lots of samples , very cheap- they were god awful-she had 50 of them and maybe 2 were worth bothering to smell-she just kept buying them-\n\nShe brought Eden Botanicals to my attention- I thought I would indulge her - so I bought $100 worth of samples- well I was hooked- when I smelled them, something clicked in my brain- I mean literally activated something in my brain- closest to being high( I am sober for literally most of my life) I have been in a long time- but different- like inhaling pure oxygen- I was hooked- I started reading Eden’s site- and they alluded to perfume, top, middle, and base notes.They wrote about fixatives, trace amounts etc\n\nI bought more, ended up on baenotes diy-\n\nPaul and Bill immediately set me straight about acs, so after a bit of resistance, I bought them too.\n\nI have bought a great deal of small amounts from hermitage, liberty, perfumers apprentice, perfumers supply house, creating perfume, apothecary garden, and many more $1000’s - happily\n\nI hadn’t smelled enough perfume to know what everyone was talking about, so I have bought mainly samples from Strangelove , sultan pasha- and loved both- my daughter bought many samples and full bottles from etat libre, I liked many , loved some. Bought several jo Malone - but only liked one\n\nNothing except meltmyheart- gave me the feeling I had when I put on opium- or the feeling I had when smelling many of my naturals\n\nI mixed some formulas I found here, I mixed some formulas I put together myself- and I generally like my experiments , they at least smelled like something ( although couldn’t quite always put my finger on exactly what…) which was better than everything in Sephora ( I do like replica but not enough to buy) or department stores- they mostly almost smelled and faded fast-\n\nSo I have been having a hard time figuring out what I was reaching for.\n\nI just bought half of what Jamie Frater sells( bases) and I will purchase the other half in a minute-\n\nThe sheer amount is almost overwhelming\n\nI will start by saying there are 3 general classifications: those that are representative of a material\n\nThose that are a work horse base\n\nThose that fit a type (eg floral)but actually have a specific effect\n\nI have not blended with them yet- I have diluted them\n\nI will review each- when I blend I’ll write about that too\n\nBut I want to urge anyone on the fence- you don’t need me to write a thing- these are so worth it , they are fairly inexpensive, they are beautiful- I do mean beautiful beyond any other material I have sampled. What Jamie has done - which is different in my experience than what other base makers have done, is make the base smell balanced and beautiful from the start. Usually the base is very strong, and leans one way or another- and I appreciate it - but I have to figure out how to apply said base. I will want , say , tomato leaf base from Robertet in my formula- but it is strong( extraordinary, but strong) It takes so much for me , a beginner to figure out how to not loose it in formula, but not overwhelm-\n\nFrater bases- they go together- they interlock without effort- so now I can try a touch of tomato leaf- and I can see if I can keep the beauty with it- or figuene, or dew fruit- or the weird Artemis etc-\n\nThey are very strong- diluted to 10% they are perfume strength to my nose- and I like strong perfume-\n\nMy favorite base is Bouvardia-supposedly a mix of orange flower and Jasmine- the jasmine isn’t upfront, it brings the orange flower out to open up and shine-it is stunningly beautiful, no heaviness, but it has real presence -\n\nViolette Blue- very true Parma violet ( the candy)- but not sweetness, just floral- this feels mid note- like it can hold its own w/o overpowering Very unusual- nothing has ever come close- I want to believe I have smelled this before, but if I have , it was when I a child- but this makes me believe there is a flower out there that smells just like this\n\nLilas poupre- now I have smelled lilac- and this smells just like , exactly like lilac- it again has presence w/o overwhelming- a trick Jamie pulls off over and over again\n\nBecause it smells so natural, it doesn’t feel old fashioned, or even free breezy- it feels like a miracle- and when diluted it reinforces the naturalness more\n\nSaxon moss I have the saxony thyme base from perfumerssupplyhouse- and this is a prime example- it is beautiful- but sooo strong , and a bit lopsided- almost soapy\n\nThis on the other hand is gentle in its insistence, it is a green amber, a sweet forest incense- very well balanced so that woods are under the sweetness, it is reminiscent of oakmoss evoking it w/o actually smelling like oakmoss-much smoother than saxony thyme\n\nAmbreine Samuelson - this is very close to one of the ambers I mixed- to my nose it had an orange top note and a delicate powdery base note- right in the middle there is something edible , chewy- toffee coffee- nothing is overwhelming, everything develops slow- definitely has luxury stamped on it w/o going to the obvious expensive materials\n\nFleur de tabac\n\nWhen I said Bouvardia was my favorite- I didn’t mean it- this is too\n\nI was quite puzzled and disappointed when I first smelled this - I own tobacco flower abs-( quite horrible- and I love everything natural) I thought it was going to be a nice smelling version-\n\nNice smelling it is - a sumptuous floral- deep with leanings towards honey, orange flower- and a delicate freshness right in the center- an expansion that seems impossible - so it shifts which helps in layering-this one will work but it doesn’t smell like any flower I’ve smelled-but maybe the fresh tobacco flower smells just like this?\n\nFleur de Cassie my eb Cassie absolute has long subtle green note, almost no floral at all- a deep herbaceous honey with a dry down to die for- full of soft violet\n\nThis is a sweet floral-jasmine like , but constant , less layered- a single note It contributes to the make up smell easily, so it has ionones or Iris in it( I can only detect them as shadows cast)-which would be on point with the violet of the natural Cassie\n\nIrroszol- a nuance blend-this is a work horse- it is Iris - with a complex subtle heart-put it near anything and it exalts - there is a bubble in the center creating space\n\nBest I can do - it is a delicate balance in there , nothing is dominating- Iris floats out - in a sweet drifting cloud , but I can feel much much more is happening\n\nWild cherry- sweet fizzy-blindfolded I would call this red fruit, punch- becomes more cherry like juxtaposed to anything else there is no sour , and no almond note- so could be swayed\n\nAmber solide - I like this amber , a lot- starts bacitracin, and slowly opens to a burning ember of sweetness, or rather brings out the sweetness of whatever is near it- smudge of cherry on my thumb - couldn’t tell it was there- smells much more of a deep cherry with this in my hand it also has a thread of green running through it\n\nSophira I was so looking forward to this - the first sniff of the cap- “what the … is that?!&$”\n\nSo let down- I do know better-\n\nin dilution-it’s a fizzy bubble bath, it has no sweetness, but it evokes the sweetness of opening a soda, with a soapy backdrop feels like a modifier, but I won’t know till I put in in anything- never smelled another material like it\n\nOpoponax doux this is another amber- the sweetest so far ( doux in French is sweet or soft)\n\nAlmost gourmand , and luxurious- also very natural w/o conjuring up anything specific- it’s a pillow- so well blended, hard to imagine needing to change anything at all- this is most perfume like\n\nOud intense- wow - just that! I bought several of hermitage’s ouds - you can read my reviews there- and the amazing oud thing is the layering- a few of them wove around themselves- this starts burning ember smoke, the woods float out , then a dryness, this has oud’s layers\n\nDries down to light smoke\n\nCedarome - the first cap whiff was another “huh” moment-\n\nBut in dilution this is an green amber wood- dry airy ,not sweet\n\nRoyal leather this is the leather in a brand new luxury car, riding boots coming out of the box, Italian leather gloves when you first put on- expensive , airy leather- not an off note, nothing overwhelming- I have to take it outside because it picks up all floral and sweet in my shop\n\nFleur D’oranger this is neroli, or orange flower extract\n\nIt even mimics the strength(( it is strong!) and the slightly creamy dry down\n\nMagnolia flower this is a citrus floral not like orange flower, but the way rose can be lemony. The citrus to my nose is fizzy , a bit soapy, a bit deconstructed- but if I put it near opoponax doux it blends, modifies.\n\nRose D’orient bright , creamy young green , dewy\n\nI have rose otto that is this smooth\n\nFleur d’heliotrope creamy almond the vanilla is low, this isn’t strong, it doesn’t throw- this is a modifier- and it’s gorgeous it has a low sweet floral that encases the whole- also a tiny play doh\n\nAmbergris absolute I have bit of ambergris from psh- I think 2grams- back when it was crazy cheap-this smells just like it waves of ocean like air, with depth . I can’t use my ambergris- the ethanol keeps boiling out- I keep it for the sample\n\nThis is inexpensive so I can mess w it all day long\n\nHoneysuckle- idk why this presents very jasmin in opening- probably needs even more dilution( it’s at 10%) because the drydown becomes lighter , airier which is closer to honeysuckle- this is very floral sweet- next to the ambergris a animal note comes out\n\nGardenia j Ellis\n\nI don’t know one variant of gardenia from another - but I have a gardenia bush- and this smells like that , only better\n\nthere is a floral green vein that opens gardenia up and sets it apart from majority of flowers .there is little sweetness - just an extremely deep breath of living plant at its very best-\n\nTuberose supreme another green floral - again very real- my tuberose abs, extract, and concrete - don’t exactly smell like this - but they don’t smell like each other either- but all 4 are recognizably tuberose- this is less honey sweet than the gardenia, it has a watery quality elegance springs to mind\n\nAmbexal floral ambergris- ambroxan vibe - a bit fizzy and dry- 10% is probably too high- I get bit of a headache- it’s very pretty\n\nOsmanthus - very apricot, with a green tinge that makes it leathery rather than green floral- dries to perfect osmanthus\n\nLilas blanc -a honeyed lilac , delicate- just gorgeous\n\nRosewood cayenne spicy linalool, very smooth with fun vibe\n\nOrrisodore warm smooth more Iris than orris very complex- definitely a base note modifier that blends into the middle\n\nRose essence perfect rose- tiny honey ,tiny musk- light airy start but deepens A rose representation that doesn’t pull one way or the other\n\nRose imperial softer than the other two- a bit more lemony,\n\nThis a rose de Mai accord- and my favorite rose de Mai was eb’s extract- this is more like the absolute-it is cloudlike -it is soft, it has green, honey, lemon all drifting around a soft rose base- very different than all the other rose bases out there- this is delicate\n\nTilleul - a linden blossom accord-\n\nI have several and they are more honeyed than this- but this is more like the head space of the living flower- this is layered , complex, alive- it also is reminiscent of the tea that is made from the seed pods - very light touch here, remarkable\n\nOeillet opens a sweet clove, the sweetness implying floral. There is no oily ness to the clove- very pure and clean- sweetness leaves fast, if what was left was only eugenol it would be much stronger- but the eugenol ( et al) are dominant , so I smell nothing identifiable- so this is a pretty floral clove flower\n\nFloranol orange blossom!!!\n\nI have many ( tiny) and a few I’ve made ( Florida!)so fresh , vribant orange blossom-no animal, or dirty, no sour- very nice!!\n\nHoney supreme floral honey- I only eat honey, no sugar- I have a thing for it-I begged for honey signature until psh stocked it- this is crazy good- and different- this is honey made from the sweetest , most floral flowers,on a hot day, almost fermenting- but I could put it on ice- and it would still hold true absolutely beautiful\n\nAnimalia - opens like anamalis-but very quickly is something else- it is animal with a (citrus?) note that is much more perfume- whatever that note is, it helps it meld right in , everything is soft very fast\n\nDianthus clove/eugenol a bit stronger than oeillet , perhaps just a different take, more perfumey\n\nBergamot Reggio- a very nice bergamot replacer- a little sweet , a little fizzy, soft citrus, airy\n\nPineapple supreme\n\njuicy , fresh cut pineapple- no emphasis on sweet, strong , alive\n\nFixomusk I can smell this- but I am very poor at musks I have to smell them in formula\n\nCuir de russie it doesn’t start leather-a bit soapy with perhaps an anise touch- it’s the drydown that gets a leather vibe,deeper-nothing harsh at all\n\nNearly deer again musk- but this is perfume- muscone-touch sweet, touch animal, touch floral- airy and light\n\nPear Belle-the greenness of pear, the juiciness, the airy freshness w/o overplaying-it is fruit - but not gourmand-\n\nSandexol- I made a sandalwood accord for a contest by adding all the sandalwood chems together-mine had a similar vibe- this of course is miles more sophisticated- but I mention it because- neither mine , nor this , is sandalwood- while both have a sandalwood vibe- this one radiates like sandalwood, throws off layered notes, like sandalwood, has a touch of sweetness- again like sandalwood- but like a good deal of the bases- this has a tinge of perfume built into it- it is seem less, refined- and probably much more useful than actual sandalwood\n\nI have reviewed all that I own- but I have more coming this week- but dilution alone takes days, so it will be a minute before I review the the rest\n\nJuly 11th\n\nMuguet des bois\n\nA green light muguet, a little sweet, but the green off sets that so it’s fresh without overt floral :then I smell it outside and it’s a light beautiful muguet\n\nMuguet Fleurs\n\nI have to go outside to smell the muguets-inside they just smell fresh outside that they smell like delicious lily-of-the-valley “what is this smell?” : beautiful perfect lily-of-the-valley . I grew up in Switzerland where 1 May there is lily-of-the-valley for sale everywhere. This one is yes more floral. Yes, a Basel accord, but it isn’t obvious, it’s lily-of-the-valley and perfumey : it is delicate and of substance :a subtle, huge floral .\n\nMaycine yes lily-of-the-valley, but it isn’t just lily-of-the-valley. It has soft effervescence that reminds me of evernyl or bergotmotier . Very perfumey, very soft and elegant. Yes, very gorgeous usable.\n\nCoraline a very lifelike beautiful lily of the valley. Again I have to go outside to really smell so delicate fresh. Imagine being in a florist shop , nothing but lily-of-the-valley around you . That’s this : so strong persistent but still delicate weird right ? lovely!\n\nMuguet invar\n\nThis is the strongest of the muguets, also, strangely the least, muguet like, although still very lily-of-the-valley, which attest to Jaime’s skill\n\nMuguet Royale this lily-of-the-valley has pizzazz in the opening and some fruity fizz. This is the most abstract ; so a floral that leans lily-of-the-valley. Jasmine in the underneath dry down flipping between the muguet and jasmine\n\nSo all the muguet acs never smelt like muguet - and I wasn’t quite clear what the purpose was. Jamie’s bases teach me more about what the true floral ( eg rose or jasmin) does in formula, than trying to create a useable accord, and then using that in formula.\n\nSo in the very small amount of playing around I’ve done- they provide lift and volume, and space. There are no harsh edges , so nothing smells harsh, so very fun to play with.\n\nplease jump in"
