        "text": "In This Article\n\nWhat is Opoponax?\n\nOpoponax, also spelled as oppoponax, is a herbaceous plant from the Apiaceae family. It produces tufts of small white or yellow flowers on long stalks and thrives in warm climates. The plant is native to the Middle East and Africa, predominantly in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Interestingly, perfumers are not drawn to its flowers, but rather its stem. Opoponax is renowned for the resin it produces, which is often used as incense to purify and disinfect the air. This resin is known for its stimulating and relaxing properties. In the 17th century, doctors believed opoponax aided healing, and it was even prescribed in the form of plasters. In perfumery, however, opoponax is typically used as a balm.\n\nThe Use of Opoponax in Perfumes\n\nMany major perfumery brands incorporate opoponax into their fragrances. The ingredient imparts a balsamic, rounded, sweet, and velvety aroma. Its warm and earthy qualities lend multifaceted olfactory sensations to fragrances. Opoponax leaves behind a fruity, herbal, and uplifting trail. It is predominantly used as a base for oriental or amber fragrances, but when employed in top notes, it exhibits solvent-like characteristics. Opoponax harmonizes well with tonka bean, benzoin, vanilla, and Peruvian balsam. Although it is a crucial component in many perfumes, it often remains an unsung hero, serving as a support rather than a spotlighted material.\n\nOpoponax serves as an essential backbone in numerous perfume compositions. For example, it is a key ingredient in Guerlain's iconic Shalimar. Les Néréides' Opoponax showcases the ingredient in a resinous juice that combines citrus with a vanilla and woody base. Opoponax is also a favorite among luxury brands, featuring in famous fragrances such as Dior's Poison, Chanel's Coco, and Kenzo's Flower, where it blends with white musk to create a fresh and clean impression.\n\nCatania Crush inspired by Poison Dior\n\nFun Facts About Opoponax\n\nThe name \"opoponax\" is derived from the Greek words \"opos\" (juice) and \"panax\" (panacea), alluding to its historical use as a healing remedy.\n\nOpoponax has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat various ailments, including digestive issues, respiratory problems, and skin conditions.\n\nAside from its use in perfumery, opoponax is also employed in the production of incense, potpourri, and essential oils for aromatherapy.\n\nOpoponax resin is typically obtained by making cuts in the plant's stem, allowing the resin to exude and harden before being collected."
