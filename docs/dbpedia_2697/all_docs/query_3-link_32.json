        "text": "In this post, you will find a complete list of essential oils and for each oil, a list of potential substitutes for that oil based on aroma and therapeutic actions. I think you're going to find this post really useful!\n\nTo create this list of 88 oils and their substitutes and to make sure it was the best available, we consulted with Elizabeth Ashley (AKA The Secret Healer), NAHA UK Director, Qualified Clinical Aromatherapist and Best Selling Author.\n\nSource: https://naha.org/about/boards-committees/naha-directors\n\nImportant: Due to restrictions around medicinal claims applicable to essential oil brands, we've had to edit the therapeutic essential oil substitutes that Liz originally listed and unfortunately we can't be too specific about certain properties or uses. Think of the property or therapeutic use of the oil you want to find a substitute for, match this as closely to the substitute oils as possible then conduct further reading to confirm the most appropriate substitute for your therapeutic needs.\n\nThis post will point you in the right direction to narrow down your search to a handful of oils, where you can conduct further research into recommended substitute oils and identify the right therapeutic use or property you are looking for.\n\nALWAYS check the safety precautions associated with any oil or substitute you plan to use. We do not promote internal use of essential oils and you should check with a qualified aromatherapist or medical professional for individual or specific advice.\n\nJump straight to the oil you are looking to substitute and see the potential alternative oils using the links below:\n\nA - C D - L M - P R - Z\n\nAngelica Seed\n\nDamiana\n\nMandarin\n\nRavensara\n\nAngelica Root\n\nDavana\n\nManuka\n\nRavintsara (Ho Leaf)\n\nBasil, Holy\n\nDill\n\nMarjoram\n\nRose\n\nBasil, Sweet\n\nElemi\n\nMelaleuca\n\nRosemary\n\nBenzoin\n\nEucalyptus (1,8-cineole species)\n\nMelissa\n\nRosewood\n\nBergamot\n\nFir, Silver\n\nMonarda\n\nSage - Sage Dalmatian/ Common Sage\n\nBirch (White)\n\nFrankincense\n\nMyrrh\n\nSandalwood\n\nCajeput\n\nGalbanum\n\nMyrtle\n\nSpearmint\n\nChamomile Roman\n\nGeranium\n\nNiaouli\n\nSpikenard\n\nChamomile Blue (German)\n\nGinger\n\nNeroli\n\nTarragon\n\nChamomile Maroc\n\nGrapefruit\n\nNutmeg\n\nTea Tree\n\nCamphor (White)\n\nHelichrysum\n\nOrange (Bitter)\n\nTurmeric\n\nCardamom\n\nHyssop\n\nOrange (Sweet)\n\nThyme\n\nCarrot Seed\n\nJasmine\n\nOregano\n\nValerian\n\nCassia\n\nJuniper\n\nPeppermint\n\nVanilla\n\nCedarwood Atlas\n\nLavender, Spike\n\nPine\n\nVetiver\n\nCinnamon Bark\n\nLavender, True\n\nPlai\n\nWintergreen\n\nCistus\n\nLemon\n\nPetitgrain\n\nYarrow\n\nCitronella\n\nLemongrass\n\nPatchouli\n\nYlang Ylang\n\nClary Sage\n\nLemon Verbena\n\nPalmarosa\n\nYuzu\n\nClove Bud\n\nLime\n\nZdravetz\n\nCopaiba\n\nCoriander Seed\n\nCumin\n\nCypress\n\nCypress, Blue\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen you are starting out in aromatherapy, it's exciting to learn about all the amazing things you can do with essential oils. From blends, DIY products, household use, therapeutic properties, diffusing to support your desired emotional or mental state and more.\n\nYou quickly learn that there's a LOT of different essential oils recommended by books, professionals and reputable websites, all with different aromas, properties, effects and safety concerns.\n\nThe frustrating thing is that oils are not cheap and you might not have them all to hand, which leaves you struggling to find approved recipes and uses that align with your specific collection of oils and desired effects.\n\nTo further complicate things, people tend to develop a “healing clique” of oils they trust time and time again, and love the effects they experience.\n\nAlso, fragrance is such an innately personal thing, it’s actually not that often that two people love and trust the same oils anyway!\n\nPerhaps more importantly, in this world of over exploitation of the plant matter, it’s becoming more necessary to avoid certain oils completely, to give Mother Earth her chance to replenish.\n\nFor example: older texts often suggest Rosewood, but the planet simply cannot sustain us using it any longer. We must leave that plant alone. Ho Wood is an excellent essential oil alternative to Rosewood, for both fragrance and therapeutic actions.\n\nSo, learning how to choose the right essential oil substitutes for recipes, blends, diffusing or therapeutic use is an extremely valuable skill.\n\nThis essential oil substitute guide is designed to help you take into consideration three different factors, depending on your motivation at the time.\n\nFragrance: For the most part we can pick a group of notes for this, or perhaps the same kind of oil. So for example, replacing a floral with a floral, a citrus with a citrus, or maybe a middle note with the same. It’s not a perfect science, since blends tend to have three or more oils in that can mess it up a bit, but often good enough will do.\n\nAction: The best example to help communicate this is imagine you have a cold. You'll probably immediately think of eucalyptus oil but what if you don't have any to hand? What are you going to use? Lots of oils have 'similar' properties so knowing which essential oils to try as a substitute could prove really useful.\n\nSafety: Unfortunately, using essential oil alternatives to the recipe or recommendation you are following, is where you are most likely to make a safety slip. You’re so focused on finding the oil that does the job best, you forget to double check the safety considerations. This is critically important.\n\nOK, let's get you reformulating blends effortlessly and with confidence!\n\nAngelica Seed Essential Oil Substitute\n\nAngelica archangelica\n\nAngelica is quite an expensive oil, but also it can be extremely stimulating to the nervous system.\n\nIf someone has quite a fragile personality, (as opposed to a fragile constitution, where angelica is then indicated – it’s very useful in hospice work) then angelica can be a little tough.\n\nFragrance Group\n\nHerbals.
