        "text": "The oriental facet is undoubtedly a major accord of perfumery. It can be dressed with several other facets and its complexity is equal to its richness.\n\nWhat is the amber or oriental facet?\n\nLet's start with a few definitions of the amber facet.\n\nIn perfumery, the word amber does not come from the stone which is a fossilized resin and has no smell.\n\nWhat is then the origin of the name?\n\nIt is called amber because perfumers used to add ambergris in the composition.\n\nAmbergris is a natural animal note coming from a pathological concretion of whale sperm. It’s still authorized to use because the animal is not killed or hurt in the process.\n\nThis sensual note is so expensive, so it is rare to find it in a perfume today.\n\nThis accord was identified in the Ambre Antique by Coty and in Jicky by Guerlaine which then became Shalimar. It is also the base of the amber accord of De Laire, Amber 83.\n\nThe amber and oriental accord have similarities in terms of sensuality and warmth, the difference is subtle.\n\nThe classic oriental accord is generally composed of:\n\ntonka bean\n\nvanilla\n\nvanillin\n\ncoumarin\n\nlabdanum\n\npatchouli\n\nresins such as benzoin or incense, opopanax, etc.\n\niris\n\nThe main components of the amber facet\n\nVanilla\n\nLet's start with noble vanilla, an essential element of the oriental facet.\n\nThis vanilla is not sweet. The molecules of vanillin and ethylvanillin, on the other hand, are really sweet.\n\nThe origin of the vanilla pod\n\nYou can find vanilla in tropical forests in the shade of the undergrowth. It grows in an orchid that looks like a mysterious liana and it’s the only orchid that gives a fruit, the vanilla bean. Vanilla appeared in Mexico and was pollinated thanks to a small bee called the Melipone.\n\nEdmond Albius found the secret of fertilizing vanilla in 1848. Using a piece of bamboo, the plant spur that closes the orchid is lifted up, then the pollen is collected to put it in contact with the pistil. This operation can be done only in the morning when the flower has just bloomed. The women doing this operation are called \"matchmakers\". It takes about 18 months to obtain its fruit, the famous black pod.\n\nTo process the vanilla, it has to be boiled for 3 minutes, then put undercover for 24 hours until it becomes black. Then, the vanilla tan on both sides for a few hours every day for 15 days under the sun that kills the bacteria and dries the vanilla pods. They are then sorted by hand, one by one, to make sure they are dry.\n\nThe vanilla of Madagascar\n\nVanilla can be found in 18 other countries. Vanilla has become a rare and luxurious material because the price has increased tenfold in 4 years. It’s a unique material because of its botanical nature, the olfactory treasures it contains and its price. Vanilla’s enveloping and sensual warmth is declined in milky, honeyed, amber, woody, spicy, animal and rum notes. There is also a botanical variety of vanilla called Tahitensis which is more floral.\n\nVanilla absolute\n\nVanilla absolute is obtained after extraction of the pods with a volatile solvent. You can also obtain vanilla absolute thanks to the synthetic products: Vanillin and ethylvanillin.\n\nAnecdotes about vanilla\n\nThe Aztecs used vanilla to flavor a chocolate drink. It is also said that vanilla is a remedy for anxiety. It brings strength and health.\n\nYou will find the vanilla of Madagascar in the Vanilla Collection of Sylvaine Delacourte.\n\nTonka bean\n\nThe tonka bean is found in South America, particularly in Venezuela, Guyana, and Brazil.\n\nIt comes from the fruit of a tropical tree called \"dipteryx odorata\". It is also called coumarouna, or sarrapia.\n\nIts fruits are in the shape of a large almond and each one contains a single black, oval, oblong, shiny seed that wrinkles as it dries out, that's when it starts to smell, then its fragrance becomes more and more pronounced.\n\nIts treatment process is very close to the vanilla one.\n\nThe usage of tonka bean\n\nInitially, these seeds were reduced to a powder sold in sachets to be placed in cupboards between piles of linen.\n\nTo get tonka bean absolute in perfumery, the bean is treated by extraction with volatile solvent.\n\nIn cooking, the bean itself can also be grated like a nutmeg to be used in pastry associated with chocolate, coffee and desserts (Panacotta).\n\nTo flavor snuff and also pipe tobacco \"l'Amsterdamer\" (practice now prohibited in France and the USA).\n\nThe scent of tonka bean\n\nTonka bean has a unique fragrance. It’s a perfumed composition by itself and is very rich in facets: woody, balmy, vanilla, almond, pistachio, tobacco, hay, woody, honey.\n\nThe main molecule of this raw material is called coumarin which is olfactory very almondy, the smell reminds you of the little jars of Cleopatra glue of our childhood.\n\nThe synthesis of coumarin was developed in 1868 and first used in Jicky by Guerlain with linalool and Ethyl vanillin.\n\nYou will find the tonka bean note in Vahina from the Vanilla Collection by Sylvaine Delacourte.\n\nMyrrh\n\nGreek mythology tells the myth of the transformation of the incestuous Myrrha into a myrrh tree, before giving birth to Adonis.\n\nSeveral species of Commophora from Arabia and Abyssinia, all of reduced size, are at the origin of the Myrrh with its prodigious past. There are more than 100 species of Commophora.\n\nThey produce an oleo-gum-resin in the form of natural exudation, real tears, whose color fluctuates from light yellow to fairly dark red. These fragile, almost friable, shiny tears give off a powerful aromatic odor.\n\nMyrrh used to be the most exquisite, most precious perfume and was used throughout antiquity as it represented The Cult of the Gods.\n\nThe scent of myrrh\n\nBeyond these sacred purposes, Myrrh is also known as an important note in perfumery. Indeed, perfumers use the essence of Myrrh obtained by steam distillation of the gum harvested from the tree. It has an intense balsamic odor, with licorice, woody notes, almost fruity and an incense facet.\n\nIncense\n\nIncense comes from the Latin \"incendere\" which means to burn and to shine.\n\nIt is also called olibanum, which comes from \"laban\", which means white or purity. The olibanum symbolizes the protective power of God, which purifies all sins. The Queen of Sheba often offered it to Solomon.\n\nIncense is like Myrrh: an eraser. It is collected on incense trees. The notion of incense tree has a collective meaning, it includes a number of species of Boswellia from various countries such as Somalia, Yemen, Sudan, Ethiopia and India. Each with specific olfactory characteristics.\n\nThe most frequently used tree is the Boswellia carteri Roxb. They are 4 to 5 meter tall shrubs from the mountains of the Middle East and Africa. Incense trees have a trunk and branches with grey bark that can be easily removed.\n\nIn perfume, the gum is collected after cutting a tree trunk, then, a week later, the incense beads are removed to be distilled by steam to produce an essence.\n\nOlfactive description of incense\n\nThe Boswellia Sacra of Oman has a mint and eucalyptus note.\n\nBoswellia Serrata from India and Boswellia papyrifera have a bitter lemon facet.\n\nBoswellia frerana or Maydi has accents of floral and fruity caramel, it is used by the Coptic Church of Ethiopia.\n\nBoswellia Rivae has gourmet accents.\n\nThe best known of these essences is a very powerful dark, aromatic base note with a camphor, resinous, smoky effect.\n\nUsage of incense\n\nThe uses of incense throughout centuries have always had a ritual aspect with, for example, the worship of Gods, remedies or perfumes.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used it to heal themselves, incense is a powerful antiseptic. They also used it to embalm their dead (preservative of the flesh) and especially for fumigations in places of worship, for its spiritual power, but also to protect from miasmas.\n\nReligions have never stopped using it.\n\nAsian cultures devote almost sacred attention to it in their private lives.\n\nIncense is also used in cosmetics.\n\nStyrax\n\nStyrax balm comes from the bark of two species of trees called liquidambar and found in Syria and South America.\n\nThe scent of styrax\n\nThe essence of styrax is obtained by distillation of the balm. It has a strong vanilla, balsamic, floral, animal, leathery, and tar note.\n\nBenzoin\n\nBenzoin is a balm that comes naturally or by incision from the trunk of a tree from the Styraceae family called the styrax benzoin. It comes from Siam and Sumatra. This exudation is actually a pathological reaction of the tree.\n\nIt is also called gum or benzoin tear. It is white when it is liquid and turns yellow when it dries. When harvested, it is already semi-solid.\n\nSiam Benzoin is the most popular variety for perfumers. It is the rarest and therefore the most expensive. It presents a very strong vanilla facet.\n\nBenzoin tears develop a very sweet perfume. It’s appreciated in Buddhist temples.\n\nBenzoin has been considered as a variety of incense or myrrh and as a precious substance. It also played a role in the care of lung and skin diseases.\n\nIn perfumery, the gum is treated by extraction with volatile solvents to obtain benzoin absolute.\n\nIt has a scent of sweet vanilla, almond, roasted coffee, honey, it is floral (carnation), rich, syrupy and medicinal.\n\nOpoponax\n\nOpoponax or opopanax is a gum that comes from a shrub growing mainly in Somalia and Ethiopia.\n\nThe scent of opoponax\n\nIt offers a balsamic, soft, velvety, earthy, leathery scent close to myrrh.\n\nDoctors in the past were convinced that it could cure tumors, and used it in the form of plasters.\n\nSome Perfumes with oriental or amber facet\n\nTo finish, here is a list of perfumes from the oriental and amber facet:\n\nHeure Bleue Guerlain\n\nNahéma Guerlain\n\nCuir Béluga Guerlain\n\nTonka Impérial Guerlain\n\nJicky Guerlain\n\nSamsara Guerlain\n\nL’instant Guerlain\n\nPure Poison Dior\n\nDune Dior\n\nAllure Chanel\n\nOzkan Sylvaine Delacourte\n\nNoir Épices Frédéric Malle\n\nFleur de Cassie Frédéric Malle\n\nVanille Galante Hermès\n\nMisia Chanel\n\nFragrances for men:\n\nHéritage Guerlain\n\nL’Instant pour Homme Guerlain\n\nAnge ou Démon Givenchy (floral)\n\nSylvaine Delacourte fragrances"
