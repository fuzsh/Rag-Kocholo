        "text": "So, many of you are probably aware that there’s this website called YouTube, where you can find EVERYTHING — clips from movies and TV shows, often whole episodes of cancelled or long out-of-production series, extended trailers for upcoming films, music videos, and plenty of original content by contributors who might be your neighbor down the street, or world famous in their own right.\n\nIt’s an interesting cultural shift, one that most likely never would have happened without the internet. Remember just 20 to 30 years ago, when your relatives invited everybody over to watch their vacation slides, and we all groaned and grit our teeth and wracked our brains for something polite to say? People came up with excuses ranging from, “I can’t, I’m having my wisdom teeth out,” to, “I’d love to, but I just sat down in this comfy chair.” Now suddenly, random strangers from around the globe put their home videos of their family getaway to Cancun on YouTube, and it hits 15,678 views in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe major difference between YouTube and the sharing-of-home-videos-of-olden-days is the fact that YouTube can make overnight celebrities. I think pretty much everyone and his dog knows by now that YouTube will pay people whose channels reach a significant number of subscribers and/or views. It’s not a foolproof instant way to hit a high salary and quit your day job; there are only a lucky few who make it to more than 10,000 subscribers, and fewer still who actually have a million or more people regularly tuning in.\n\nBut this is now an established, accepted part of American entertainment, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon.\n\nAnd we’re certainly feeding the beast — YouTube is among the top pick for media platforms regarding movie trailers, music videos, original videos, and lots of artists (in traditional corporate contracts as well as indie) release production news via their YouTube channel. The public finds the free features extremely appealing (myself included), and so do indie artists who can’t afford thousands of dollars for a marketing campaign that could reach potentially millions of people.\n\nHowever, for all that’s good, just like with anything else, the scope and scale of this phenomenon have created some dark sides.\n\nFor example, there’s no rating system, G, PG, etc., so it’s criminally easy for your 4-year-old to stumble on recorded game play of Doom or Five Nights at Freddy’s. (And for those of you who claim, “Well, parents should be watching their children,” let’s see you stick by that argument when it’s either race to the bathroom or wet the floor, and your misbehaving, headstrong preschooler will climb the furniture to grab the stashed remote while you’re literally indisposed.) While plenty of contributors do keep their uploads clean and family friendly, there are just as many who don’t consider that necessary, nor do they leave a note on their channel that what they post may not be appropriate for all audiences.\n\nYes, there are parental controls available on a variety of devices, and we don’t have to let our children watch certain things; but as the “parent network,” YouTube should bear some of the responsibility. After all, the major broadcasters — NBC, PBS, FOX, HBO, etc. — either relegate more mature viewing to hours when small ones are in bed, or they advertise all over the place that particular shows aren’t meant for those of us under age 18. We genuinely can’t say we weren’t warned about The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones.\n\nYouTube doesn’t appear to have the same concerns about their viewers that traditional TV networks do. The trad folks are very aware of lawsuits and fines and even threats of jail time. And, yes, they’re doing “the right thing” primarily to keep their business earning money; but at least they’re following a code of values that most of us feel pretty good about — and if we don’t, we always have the option not to watch.\n\nDo we have the option to block or turn off YouTube as well? Of course. Though with this platform becoming ever more prevalent, that’s growing slightly difficult.\n\nBecause YouTube is now featuring many “regular people” contributors who have hit it big on their platform, children especially are very attracted to the “kids just like me” they see in a lot of these videos. One of Muffin’s favorites is Ryan’s Toy/Family Review, which is run by an Asian-American family in California, that has gone from posting 10-minute videos of their son playing with new toys to a multi-million-dollar empire of several channels on YouTube, a line of toys and clothing being sold at major retailers, and enough income for the parents to quit their jobs and build a new house. Yes, you read all of that right. As a parent myself, I have some serious moral qualms about what this level of fame at such a young age (the “star,” Ryan, is only 7 years old!) might do later in life, but I’m evidently in the minority. Lots of families are coming up with concepts for their children to film and upload, and actively help them do so. The hope, I’m sure, is that one day they all end up with a similar situation to Ryan.\n\nAll Muffin knows about Ryan is that the kids are playing with lots of fun toys and seem to be having a blast, and there’s no swearing or violence or anything that Mummy finds objectionable, so he is allowed to watch it as often as he wants.\n\nAnd when faced with the alternative of something horribly inappropriate, I know I will keep letting him choose Ryan.\n\nI’d be lying, though, if I didn’t add that I pray this family knows what they’re doing.\n\nWhat happens if, one day, YouTube executives wake up and decide they don’t need certain channels anymore? What happens to the celebrity families who have now made this platform their career and sole form of wages? How hard would the transition be back to an “average” lifestyle? For the kids as well as the adults?\n\nAnd, as a child of the 1980s, I remember all too well hearing about former “child stars,” young actors and actresses and musicians that my generation grew up with and admired, getting arrested or checking into rehab, again, or dying from some tragic, preventable occurrence. In another decade or so, will that be the fate of the current YouTube-famous tweens with 1.1 million subscribers?\n\nUnfortunately, only time will tell. But if we hit the year 2025 and all of today’s YouTube kid stars are happily married with a rescue dog and tons of security guards around their inground pool and giant Lego playhouse, then I’ll thank God.\n\nI let White Fang start his own YouTube channel a couple of years back, and it was mostly to post videos of himself playing Minecraft to share with his friends. He has around 200 subscribers, last I knew, and while he hasn’t updated it in a long time, it still exists, and he may go back to it one day. He’s proud of what he did accomplish, in terms of learning how to use his camera to film the videos, upload them, and be brave enough to share his passion with others.\n\nHe’s also found some of the most inspiring and talented individuals by getting involved with the Minecraft and Warriors fan communities on YouTube. Captain Sparklez, anybody? TryHardNinja? And Rainimator has taken the Minecraft community by storm (his work even inspired a character White Fang helped me design for The Order of the Twelve Tribes world.)\n\nAnd many famous YouTubers are kind and generous; ToyLabTV (they make Jurassic Park styled less-scary dinosaur videos for younger kids) recently hosted a family whose sick child’s “wish” (through the Make A Wish Foundation) was to film a video with them. (Just thinking about that gets me choked up.)\n\nSo, YouTube itself is far from evil. But in a world that didn’t even imagine it would be in all our homes until, suddenly, it is, I think we’re still in the infancy of learning just how all this may go.\n\nThis may seem like a very 21st century, first-world-problem type of thing. While it’s true that television and film are considered a luxury, something we can live without, the fact is that most of us don’t. Radio changed the civilized world by spreading news and culture to all areas of the globe; next, television pushed the boundaries even farther. Now we’re into an era of the internet playing a major role in transmitting TV shows.\n\nI have to admit something: While I regularly use the internet for a lot of things — obviously, since you’re reading this blog via email or a search engine — I am not sold on the idea of trying to watch TV through a laptop or cell phone. My tepid feelings towards the matter arise from a combination of factors. Partly, it’s because I don’t have enough devices to just dedicate one to Hulu or Netflix — I have to be able to use the computers for a variety of tasks, at any given time. Also, there are wifi “cold spots” in our house — rooms where the wifi just refuses to work — so that complicates things as well.\n\nAnd there’s the old quandary of what one person likes to watch, another can’t stand. It’s why a second television set became so popular in many American households. Stuff that’s now common in our world, that was supposed to make our lives easier.\n\nDoes it really, though?\n\nWhen you go to the cinema, it’s so straightforward: You buy a ticket, walk into the building, sit down in the theater, the lights go down, and you employ good manners for the benefit of the rest of the audience, and just watch the film as it appears on the screen. Someone else is taking care of the technology applied to making this event happen. You willingly paid to enjoy it. It’s a win-win.\n\nWith cable or even just basic TV, you simply press a few buttons, and, boom, you know who’s about to lose the playoffs or what’s on Nature that night. Since networks tend to keep to a schedule, I can force my family into permitting me a chance to veg by reminding them that Jeopardy! is only on at 7:30 Monday through Friday.\n\nIf you find yourself saying, “But there’s nothing on” (trust me, that’s me as well), streaming can seem very appealing. Sign on to your device, click open your account, scroll down for a show you know you like and haven’t been able to view lately. Your internet bill paid up? Then just sit down and catch up. Or, if your device is portable, you can be finishing the laundry or starting dinner while you discover if those characters finally got together or broke up.\n\nOf course, with cable often comes the option of recording a broadcast to your box, or calling up previously aired shows On Demand. I LOVE the On Demand feature. It means fewer commercials, and the same exact episode I missed the night, the week, the month before. With streaming services, time limits for viewing might be more strict. All this summer, I watched reruns of The X-Files from every single season ever made at the touch of a button, no additional fees. It was a beautiful thing.\n\nAnd tons of TV shows (new and old) are on DVD now, and usually can easily be ordered through the public library system, either for free or a small rental price. And if you’re squeamish about cinema ticket costs, Redbox is awesome. It’s similar to the old Blockbuster stores, but cheaper, and you don’t even have to have internet. You just go to the literal box near the supermarket checkout, use cash or a credit card, get a physical DVD, and then bring that home to your player or computer. No worrying about if the streaming konks out during viewing.\n\nWe order DVDs from Netflix for this specific reason; streaming can be unreliable, and more expensive. Netflix’s monthly charges break down to pennies a day, for the privilege of no due dates, short waiting lists for new releases, and the ability to lie on the floor in your pajamas while being entertained. And if a disc is damaged, you get a replacement for free. I’ve heard horror stories about people being out of pocket and out of luck for Amazon Prime screwups.\n\nSo, while I may be considered “old-fashioned” when it comes to how I watch what I watch, I’m not sure I care. Yes, cable packages have become expensive…but so has the other way. I simply don’t have the money to purchase cell phones and tablets — and pay a monthly data plan bill –for every person in my household. It doesn’t feel convenient; it doesn’t feel “easier.”\n\nIt is just plain a good thing for my children to learn to wait patiently for the TV to be open. For them to skip the cinema and anticipate the cheaper DVD release. For them not to have a laptop or cell phone or tablet until they’re in high school. And for them to be aware they will not shrivel up and die without immediate access to all of the trending things every waking moment.\n\nYes, advancements in machinery and electronics have definitely made our lives better in a lot of ways. But let’s not forget that people are ultimately running the machines. And that connecting with each other is still important.\n\nWe still need to take the whole family to the store, have everyone pick out their snacks, and stand in front of a selection of DVDs, debating which one to choose. Then arrange enough room on the couch and recliner and beanbags for everybody, and make sure the dog isn’t blocking the TV screen. Then put the disc in the DVD player, turn the lights off, and the sound up, and tell the kids to stop poking one another. And let the old-fashioned magic wash over us as the previews begin.\n\nAll right, prepare yourself for a whole lot of whinge, and potential spoilers. I’ll tell everybody right now, if you’re not caught up on the most recent seasons of Supernatural, Riverdale, or Grey’s Anatomy, there may be problems reading this post. Unless you don’t care about the spoilers for any of these shows. Or, er, others… Consider yourself well and truly forewarned…\n\nSo, not too long ago, I discussed how modern television programs are really letting me down. Maybe I’m feeling the effects of my age (being over 35). Maybe it’s because the TV I grew up on wasn’t yet riddled with plot device cliches, or character tropes we’d all seen a hundred times. The TV shows of the 1980s and 90s (and I was a kid then, folks, so I’m not that old) were, in terms of special effects, yes, rather lacking, compared to what we view today on our phones. However, most of the time, I didn’t care — because the TV shows I grew up with had plots that worked, characters that were endearing and easy to cheer for, writing that wasn’t chock full of overt political commentary, and stories that — if you were the creative sort yourself — made you want to write something that good.\n\nThe 90s was also the era in which we began to witness the major cultural problem of shows carrying on too long, just for the ratings/money, and the writers/directors/actors getting burned out, so the scripts turned to garbage, and the integrity of the whole program went downhill (at 50 miles an hour).\n\nUnfortunately, it was also the era of current events issues beginning to enter the dialogue of sitcoms and dramas a little too much. While I’m not an expert on this particular medium of entertainment, as a writer, and a viewer, there’s plenty I observed, especially as an adult, and I shall be waxing lyrical about it here.\n\nSo, one of the concerns for parents when I was young was the idea that their kids would see, or hear, something on TV that, maturity-wise, they weren’t ready to. It was one of the main reasons programming over a PG-13 rating generally wasn’t broadcast until after 8 p.m., when really small people had gone to bed and wouldn’t be conscious for the possible swear words or brief shot of a woman in a bikini, or the scene where the cheating husband got murdered. Of course, this leads straight into my next point, that most of these things were edited, so that we’d only see the bikini for about 15 seconds, the murder would be intensely unrealistic, with some stunt guy just yelling, “Aaaahh!!” and falling down, and the worst anybody would say before 10 p.m. was, “Damn it, they got away!”\n\nNow, before we get any further into this, I want to state, for the record, that I don’t approve of censorship. I don’t think simply banning an idea, or a style of filmmaking, or TV-show-making, is actually effective. (Generally banning something only makes people want to do it more, because apparently the human race is like that.) Are there things that I think are unnecessary in television programming? Absolutely. Do I think there are subjects/content that will appeal to a wide audience, but that should have their place and time (literally)? Yes.\n\nSo, here we go, onto one of my chief complaints: In most PG-13-rated shows post-2010, there seems to be an intense lack of decency.\n\nI’ll spot Riverdale on the stand as my Exhibit A in this case. For those of you who don’t know, Riverdale started as a show based loosely on the characters/setting from the Archie comics from the 1960s and 70s. As someone who never read the comics (who never read comics at all, apart from Peanuts and Garfield), I had no idea who the characters were or what their premise was. I did a little research prior to the season 1 premiere, and found that it was basically a classic example of high school life in the 1950s, very apple-pie, white-picket-fence, totally unrealistic middle-class America of a bygone age. I couldn’t see how any of this would relate to modern viewers, so I started watching, out of pure curiosity.\n\nAnd I have to say, season 1 of Riverdale is brilliant. It takes all those metaphors I just used, and turns them on their head. It adds diversity, it shakes up the established culture of a small town in the middle of nowhere, with murder, conspiracy, corruption, and tons of drama. It’s juicy, it’s exciting, it’s a guilty pleasure. And throughout, we’re reminded that the main characters are just teens, dealing with stuff they shouldn’t have to, and their innocence being shattered is palpable to the audience. The cautionary tales that arise from putting themselves in dangerous situations is important to include, and rings true.\n\nThen the season ends on a cliffhanger (grrrrrr, STOP doing that, producers!!), and when we get more than a few episodes into season 2, we see it’s all going to the dogs. Teenagers are running around, vigilantes trying to solve crimes, carrying guns and joining gangs. The adults are either horrifically corrupt, disgustingly clueless, or have no backbone to stand up to the dark forces taking over their town. There’s a completely unnecessary amount of violence, nudity, and sex (among the adolescents). The plot makes no sense after half a dozen episodes. Well before the end of season 2 arrived, I was barely keeping up with the new broadcasts, and I’d grown so dissatisfied, I highly doubted I’d care if season 3 was announced. Well, it was, and here’s the verdict — I won’t be watching it.\n\nNext on the evidence stand I present (sob!) Supernatural. I LOVED Supernatural. The relationship between the brothers, Sam and Dean, was awesome — plenty of sibling rivalry, they played pranks on each other, argued over not listening to the same album in the car again; then they’d go out monster hunting and absolutely have each other’s backs, no matter what. The fact these guys saved so many people, risked their lives countless times, literally died and came back more than thrice — all in the name of continuing to fight the good fight, it was so heartrending. And the secondary characters were all so good, too — their complicated past with their dad, John Winchester, their foster father, Bobby, the tragic loss of their mother early on; perilous love interests that proved to be bad for them, dodgy alliances with Crowley and Rowena, the twists of the angels not always being the good guys — all of it was just… Well, I kept watching this show for years.\n\nAnd because of the subject matter — fighting demons, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and mythical monsters that liked to kill humans — we all knew this would be a program that would require a strong stomach. So, really, nothing they threw at the audience — in terms of blood and gore, epic demon battles, exorcisms, all the religious questions that naturally come with this territory — bothered me. I was either expecting it (and so at times would just look away from the screen), or I appreciated the writers’ willingness to tackle such topics as angels and demons, the fall of Lucifer, the war in Heaven, the Mark of Cain, whether God actually hears our prayers, Purgatory, resurrection, and so much more. For a long time, this was the only show on mainstream TV that was discussing such things.\n\nThen season 11 happened. And I basically stopped watching. Too much occurred in the plot that didn’t just pose interesting muses on theology — it took accepted doctrine (from both Christian and Jewish cultures) and threw it out the window. In a very non-subtle way. And then (from the few episodes I saw of season 12 and 13), the confrontational style only grew more intense. What Supernatural had going for it before — its lack of getting mired in the political soapboxes of the day — completely vanished by early 2017. And it made me sad.\n\nHow did a show that made me laugh out loud and cry like a baby — so often within the same episode — just disappear seemingly overnight? The actors are the same, the characters have the same names, but I swear, this is no longer the Supernatural I spent the past 5 years catching up on. Cue the tears of despair and frustration.\n\nWhat drives earnest creative minds, who have survived the ravages of Hollywood’s limits and stringent censors, to walk away from something truly entertaining and beautiful that they fought so hard to write, act, direct, edit? Is it just the pressure of the industry, the fickleness of the public, the way money talks in this field and if you can’t get it, your production suffers? I think it’s a combination of all this, and something else, something new to our society.\n\nWhile television has consistently been a platform for raising awareness of cultural issues that need to be addressed, never has the discussion been so one-sided as it is nowadays. Forcing actual comments in the media about gun control, the environment, or abortion into the dialogue of fictional characters is blatantly attempting to brainwash your audience. What the hell happened to having a character who found themselves in a difficult situation — such as an unexpected pregnancy — and having the episode be about the options available to them, and how their decision might affect the other characters? Not simply, “The network says we have to present this view, so we are.” That is not the mark of a society that values free speech.\n\nSo, I honestly think part of the reason more balanced shows seem to be slipping out of the current schedule is because some of the people who make such programs are feeling burned out, and tired of fighting with the present network administrations. I have no proof of this, it’s just a theory. But it makes sense.\n\nHere we come to my next big point in this treatise: People in the industry — writers, directors, actors, crew — do appear to be developing burn-out. Partly, the lack of new ideas on even the cable networks indicates the folks who come up with original stuff can’t find such a notion using satellite GPS and the Hubble telescope. And this usually means they are stressed, worn out, or traveling through India. My guess is it’s the first and second.\n\nSo, here we come to my Exhibit C: Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nI got into Grey’s Anatomy late — the end of season 12, to be precise. I was incredibly bored and tired during Muffin’s naptime, and I wanted to just get off my feet and ignore the chores for 2 hours. So I jumped on the streaming services, and found that people were flailing over the season finale of Grey’s, and I thought, “Hey, I’ve never seen this, why not?” A couple episodes into season 13, and I was hooked.\n\nThen I began seeing various comments on social media, from long-time fans who were growing disillusioned with the show. I did a little research on the official Wiki site, and realized just how much I’d missed. So, about a month ago, I went to the library and checked out the DVDs of season 1-5.\n\nAnd I can now concretely say, OH. MY. GOSH. The storylines were so much better in the early years, the writing and editing so powerful, the characters so alive and fully fleshed-out. I shipped folks, I gasped in shock, I burst out laughing, I wept. While there were some things I didn’t agree with (in terms of my own spiritual and social convictions), I honestly felt free to disagree with it, and just enjoy the rest of the show. Not that I was being coerced into seeing the issue from exactly the same point of view as perhaps the director, the writer, or the network.\n\nHowever, in current broadcasting, now we are on to the end of season 14. And the bubble has burst.\n\nSiiigghhh.\n\nThe new TV season begins this fall, and here’s what I will be doing while it is on: Not watching it. I’ll be reading, or watching PBS (their nature and history programs are still pretty, remarkably unbiased), or surfing the internet. I’ll happily re-watch DVDs of old X-Files series, and movies I’ve seen a dozen times so I know I’ll enjoy it. I truly don’t feel I’ll miss out on anything.\n\nDoctor Who lost me when they broke all the rules of time travel with the 11th Doctor. Making the 12th Doctor a nasty, angry “I’m with her” social commentary trope just made me mad. Now that it’s been set in stone the 13th Doctor will be a woman — playing straight into the hands of several current political agendas — I’m not even going to bother. Just to clarify — I have nothing against this actress, and I genuinely wish her the best, and hope she gets fantastic companions and scripts. But I am SO. TIRED. of having the news headlines shoehorned into what’s supposed to be entertainment.\n\nWhen I watch TV or a film, I do it to escape. Yes, there are extremely important unpleasant stories that need to be told. But why do they have to hit you over the head with it? Why can’t we have nice metaphors and allegories, like in the original Star Trek, or Lord of the Rings?\n\nI gave up on most dramas ages ago. I don’t even care for many historical fiction shows anymore. Same for a lot of sci-fi, even fantasy. And the last time I watched a sitcom — apart from 3 months ago, because there was one in particular I was curious about — was 7 or 8 years back.\n\nSeriously, I. AM. DONE.\n\nThank you so much for making it to the end of this quite long post! Any thoughts to add in the comments?\n\nFirst off, to answer the above question, my newest fandom is The Walking Dead. And here’s why I’m not ashamed, though apparently I’m supposed to be: Because a major part of the subject matter is zombies, and apparently being a Christian and watching zombie films don’t go together.\n\nHmmm…well, yes, and no. Zombies are gross, there’s no denying that. Physically, because they’re dead, there’s a whole lot of natural decomposing going on that is icky. And, yes, disposing of them requires some messy and violent means. If you choose not to watch a program like The Walking Dead for personal reasons of not getting near the moments of yuck, you won’t hear any argument from me. (In fact, there have been scenes where I’ve had to look away from the screen, even knowing it’s all special effects.)\n\nBut I also find TWD fascinating and compelling, and I am totally hooked; the setting of a zombie apocalypse poses some extremely in-depth moral questions for the characters and the viewers.\n\nZombies are absolutely terrifying monsters — they have no human intelligence or soul left, you can’t reason with them or appeal to their “better nature.” They simply exist, and are driven purely by primal instrinct. The zombies of TWD are really stupid as well, with no sense of self-preservation; they’ll keep literally plowing forward, trying to eat you, even when there’s a tornado/cliff/truck/machete coming their way. (At least most animals run away from humans when threatened.) All of this creates monsters that you love to hate — and sometimes, almost feel sorry for.\n\nAnd of course there’s the human survivors, the actual people. How do they get through such necessarily violent circumstances without losing their own humanity? In a world where ethics may no longer be black-and-white, where’s that line they can never cross?How do they find the strength to keep going? And for what purpose?\n\nThis is a story with plenty of gray areas, and I love that. White Fang started watching the show before I did (and, yes, I let him), and the number of serious discussions we’ve had in the last few months about right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, how to tell the difference, and what’s the line you just don’t step over is awesome. No, I don’t support all of the writer/director choices regarding certain content, and I explain that to him. And if he was any younger, I’d say, no way, you’re waiting to watch this show.\n\nBut I am actually glad he introduced me to it. I’ve seen the ads for years, always cringed at the zombies (it’s far from my favorite genre), and never tried it myself. Eventually, though, I began to wonder — based on the fan references I’d come across on social media — if I was missing out on something.\n\nPart of the reason I started watching the DVDs of past seasons with White Fang was parental duty; part of it was curiosity.\n\nI have gone from literally peering between my fingers at the screen, to yelling at the top of my lungs, “GET AWAY FROM THEM, YOU CREEP!” In a totally fangirl way.\n\nHere are some reasons why… (Disclaimer: I promise nothing about avoiding possible spoilers. If you’re behind on the current season, consider yourself forewarned.)\n\nDaryl Dixon is amazing. If Daryl was a real person, I’d 115-million percent want him in my corner. He’s flawed, he has regrets, he’s not that great at opening his heart. But he is still INCREDIBLE. He never lets the odds beat him. He KEEPS GOING, no matter what. Most of his struggles are private, which can make getting close to him a little tough, but when it really counts, he turns into open book. And while he’s an ACE with that crossbow, and knives, and guns, he doesn’t take joy in killing the zombies, and certainly not in killing people. He’s great with kids, isn’t after tawdry flings, and has some of the most endearing brotherly relationships with most of the other main characters.\n\nCarl. Just, Carl. Watching this young man grow (the character and the actor) through the seasons is just…wow. The son of the major protagonist, Sheriff Rick Grimes, Carl goes from being a slightly babied-by-his-in-denial-mother kid to a maturing teenager who can really hold his own. The recent (mid-season 8) plot twist with Carl had White Fang sobbing like a baby. I got plenty choked up myself — but mostly because of the legacy Carl will have, rather than concentrating on the moment of tragedy.\n\nIn this story, not all romances are insta-love or simply lust. Take Rick and Micchone, seen above. There are fans massively shipping them (White Fang and I included), but no one would say that their road to potential romance was obvious. They weren’t even sure they could trust each other at the start, and over time their friendship developed, and then a deeper bond became clear, and it’s all so…lovely. Rick is a widower by the time Micchone enters the story, and she was out there, surviving the zombie apocalypse all on her own, with her kick-butt samuari sword and her wits. They both needed something greater than their sole purposes in this life. And watching them come to rely on one another, and how Micchone won’t hesitate to put Rick in his place (which sometimes he really needs) is great.\n\nPlatonic male-female relationships abound. The wonderfully sweet bond Daryl and Carol have is my exhibit A. Carol was an abused housewife, so trusting others, especially men, doesn’t come easy to her early on. As her friendship with Daryl grows, we see absolute proof that love comes in many forms, and not everything on TV has to end with a fade-to-black bedroom scene. Carol and Daryl’s bond is much more like an aunt-nephew type, and they both gain tons from their friendship. (So do the viewers.)\n\nThere’s still hope. Optimism for the future is epitomized by Carl’s little sister, Judith, who’s born after the zombie apocalypse has started. Of course she’s innocent and knows nothing of the seedier aspects required of those around her to keep them all alive. But at a time when things are pretty damn bleak, Judith’s very presence reminds us not to give up, to hold onto faith, to hope. To the thought that one day we can get through all this crap, and make life better for our children.\n\nA good example of a Christian on a mainstream program. This would be Ezekiel, leader of Kingdom, a settlement that’s trying to provide survivors with a “normal” life. Ezekiel doesn’t turn to violence first, he shows compassion to his enemies, and encourages people to become more than they believe they can. He’s also not preachy, he leads by example of his own behavior. I so love that.\n\nAnd, yes, he has a pet tiger, Shiva. She’s CGI, but she rocks.\n\nNot all the villains are completely evil. The Governor really is, and I skipped several episodes from season 4 because I simply couldn’t stand seeing any more of him. And Terminus…well, seeing that go up in literal flames was purely justice. And the Wolves…well, aaaaarrrrgggghhhh. And I’m still on the fence regarding Jaydis…\n\nHowever, the character of Negan, whom many fans find downright despicable and are eagerly awaiting his exit, is one I find excellent for demonstrating gray areas. Yes, he is not a hero, he has made some extremely dodgy moves, and he was introduced as a source of conflict for our protagonists. But the thing I love about Negan’s character is (and the actor deserves BUCKETLOADS of credit for portraying this brilliantly) the number of complex levels to him. The possibility for redemption is huge with this one. As much as Darth Vader, I’m telling you. (I could probably write a whole post about this subject on its own.)\n\nSo, while I understand that not everyone will appreciate this fandom, I stand by my place in it.\n\nAnd, for the record… My weapon of choice would be the crossbow. And if I got bitten, I’d want Daryl to take me out.\n\nOkay, very scary topic of discussion today.\n\nThe situation: You have successfully spawned a second generation geek. He is big into trying sci-fi, fantasy, books that feature talking animals and traveling through time; when you ask what he wants for his birthday, he says the latest installment of The Illuminae Files or Warriors.\n\nThis is all cool — why in the world would I say this is scary?\n\nHere’s the catch: What if, when you introduce him to your favorite fandoms…he doesn’t like them?!\n\nNow that White Fang is of a certain age (old enough to try the above-G-rated stuff), I’ve become very excited to share with him things like Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, and Douglas Adams. While he’s not yet shown any interest in reading Discworld or The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, he does know the meaning of 42, and he’s officially hooked on Doctor Who.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I realized White Fang was dangerously close to finishing his TBR — again. Before some of you swoon in utter astonishment and awe, I’d like to remind you that since he’s a rather picky reader, his TBR usually has no more than 10-20 books on it at any one time. He goes through series pretty fast.\n\nThe upside is, obviously, all that accomplishment. The downside — what the heck do I give him to read when he’s in between lists?\n\nKnowing I couldn’t get to the library (this was in the middle of the arctic freeze), I scoured my own shelves (spoiler: his are infinitely better than mine, oh my gosh, the unfairness), and set my copy of All the Crooked Saints on his desk.\n\nHe started reading it. He got to page 35 and gave me a sideways look. I assured him it starts off really slow and keeps getting better. So he proceeded to page 60 (maybe in sheer defiance at the idea of being beaten by a novel), but was still unsure.\n\nBy page 100, he was beginning to grow quite interested in what would happen to the pilgrims. By the midway point of the novel, where things really change for both the pilgrims and the saints, he was hooked. He finished reading with a big grin on his face.\n\nSeeing his elation at having glimpsed some of the wonder and beauty that is Maggie Stiefvater’s writing, I showed him The Scorpio Races. The light went on in his eyes, and I knew this would be the next big hit.\n\nPart of the joy of sharing your own passions with your kids comes when you discover something new and are convinced they’ll love it, too (especially when you’re right). This was totally the case for us with Kyle Shultz’s Beaumont and Beasley series. At first, White Fang was rather skeptical when I shoved a copy of The Beast of Talesend in his face and basically shouted, “You have to read this now!” But two days later, he couldn’t put it down.\n\nThe trick is to know what your kids are really into. Don’t assume they will inherit absolutely all your dispositions — particularly towards entertainment. Finding common ground is so precious, so do take advantage of it when it happens.\n\nAnd don’t push it when it doesn’t.\n\nWe are not yet up to Lord of the Rings. He has watched the movies of The Hobbit (which we all know are fun, but not exactly Tolkien-pure). He wanted to try to read LOTR first, but after seeing how long each book was, he decided to put that on hold. He’s seen the meme of “You shall not pass!”, and regularly uses it on Muffin and Toby. (Yes, just picture that for a minute. Your funny bone will thank me. I’ll wait.)\n\nThere are SO many references to LOTR in geekdom that I really, really want to share with him. But we’ll get there. Just this morning, it was 42 degrees at our house, and he said with the absolute sincerity and gravity necessary to make this quote, “42!“, and I was so proud. One day, we’ll reach the next level. But it is not this day.\n\nAnd that’s okay.\n\nWatching the 9th Doctor save the world through White Fang’s eyes is like seeing it for the first time again. Hearing his cries of excitement and terror when he first meets a Dalek or the Cybermen gives me the same chills. I’m very good at not revealing major spoilers, so he gets to be honestly surprised at so many of the twists I know are coming — and await his reaction with bated breath.\n\nIt means the future is going to be full of wonderful things.\n\nThis is a topic that I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. Recently, I tried reading magical realism for the first time (I started with the acclaimed The Weight of Feathers by Anna Marie McLemore), and my attempts have generally fallen quite flat.\n\nMaybe it’s because of the way my brain is organized, but I tend to take in information very methodically and concretely. I don’t do well with abstract concepts. I understand metaphors and symbolism, as they’re referring to or representing something that is tangible. But I get really hung up on parables or “tall tales” that either don’t seem to connect to anything relevant in the rest of the story, or are so overblown exaggerated that they just appear ridiculous.\n\nHaving been a fantasy reader since I was very young, I am fully aware that in speculative fiction, things are not always what they first seem, and that characters will often have to rely on a faith in the unknown or unproven to get through the plot. None of this bothers me.\n\nWhat bothers me is when I honestly have no stinking idea what’s going on as I read.\n\nCase in point: The Weight of Feathers. The premise indicates it’s kind of a modern Hispanic Romeo and Juliet, where one family is represented by birds and the other by snakes. Apparently they’re both circus performers. O-kay…I think. The first few chapters, I felt like I was following along. But by the middle of this book, I was utterly lost. Did the families actually transform into those animals or not?? Why were they feuding unless it was because they were natural enemies in their creature states?? To say I was frustrated and not invested by the time I finished is an understatement.\n\nIt’s precisely why A Monster Calls made me upset and angry. By the “big reveal” climatic scene in the last few pages, I still couldn’t determine what the monster really was — a true walking tree, a manifestation of the narrator’s feelings about his mother’s illness, or a crazy dream? It meant that what should’ve been an emotionally charged book left me feeling robbed, because I simply could not wade through my confusion and anxiety over this confusion. I needed more than possible Freudian theories.\n\nWhile I remained in a fog after these experiences, I mistakenly ordered Anna Marie McLemore’s Wild Beauty from the library. I say “mistakenly,” because I didn’t realize it was by the same author as The Weight of Feathers — I went by the cover alone. After getting about 25 pages in, I realized that I wouldn’t be able to finish Wild Beauty. Sure enough, I made it to about 70%, then threw in the towel. It was deja vu all over again — did the flowers actually sprout from the ladies’ bodies, or were they just excellent gardners? When it was said their lovers “disappeared,” did they in fact vanish into thin air, or (much more likely) they just left?\n\nSo, despite bloggers raving about McLemore (and Patrick Ness), I won’t be trying any more of their works. I simply don’t have the patience for muddling through, vainly hoping to comprehend something that should be set forth in quantifiable terms.\n\nEnter my latest bookdragon struggle: All the Crooked Saints by Maggie Stiefvater. This one still sticks in my craw. I like Maggie Stiefvater, I was excited she had a new book coming out, I even pre-ordered it. However, I actually had to read this twice in about as many weeks for the overall meaning to begin to penetrate.\n\nI am a well-educated person. I have an IQ of 143, for crying out loud. I know a lot about various world religions and spiritual belief systems. So why did I keep getting knocked down by the theories and prose of All The Crooked Saints?\n\nBetween pages 10 and 100, I put this novel aside about 5 times. I literally felt that I knew what was going on, then the narration took me on a totally different path (not in a good way), and it was starting to grate on my nerves. I pushed through, and even after reading the epilogue the second time, I’m still a bit tangled in bookdragon yarn of sad puzzlement. Why were the Sorias not allowed to speak to the pilgrims (when doing so would’ve healed them a lot faster?) What was the “darkness” that the pilgrims and Sorias experienced? The result of sin? A curse brought about by their sin? Or are we talking purely symbolic inner darkness — guilt, low self-esteem, etc.? I’m sorry, folks, but I need cold, hard facts.\n\nI also have to admit, a little selfishly, that I’m concerned about authors who were writing fantasy and now are tending more towards magical realism. This is an issue because I love the former but not the latter, and the latter is becoming increasingly more prevalent in bookstores and libraries. Am I about to start losing some of my favorite authors?\n\nAs a reader, not a publisher or editor, I’m aware I don’t have much say. And this bothers me, too — is traditional publishing the latest entertainment industry to fall prey to only releasing what’s trendy, instead of what their audience is asking for?\n\nHopefully 2018 will be the year of lots of cool new fantasy authors, determined to buck the trend. I’m over here, eagerly awaiting what non-allegorical myths, legends, and magical creatures you’re about to release on the world of fiction.\n\nOh, this’ll be fun. (Sarcasm inserted.)\n\nNecessary disclaimer: These are just my personal views, tastes, musings, or random brain firings. If you do happen to disagree with me, please don’t come after me with torches and pitchforks. We’re all adults here. (Teenagers included in this instance.)\n\nThere are times when I just feel the need to express an unpopular opinion. Often when I do, I discover that in fact I am not the only one who holds said perspective. And this becomes a win-win for all of us lonely outcasts.\n\nSo, here we go…\n\n#1: I don’t like Star Wars. Hey, hey, hey, remember my disclaimer! Put those rotten tomatoes back in the compost! If you love Star Wars, good for you (absolutely no sarcasm hiding in this statement). It’s just a big flop for me. Oh, not totally — I liked it when I was a kid, and there was all the fun of the spaceships and the scary aliens and the race to defeat the evil Empire so they wouldn’t blow up more planets. And I liked Yoda (back when he was still a Muppet and not CGI). But the real failings — as I see them — of this series became crystal-clear to me as an adult, when I lived with a Star Wars fan.\n\nHere’s the reason this movie series never fails to get on my nerves anymore:\n\nIt makes me beyond mad that the Jedi Council — the supposed good-doers, protectors of liberty, defenders of freedom — actually created the “monster” known as Darth Vader through their own petty actions. If Anakin Skywalker had just been allowed to make his marriage to Queen Padme public knowledge, then he wouldn’t have been going crazy trying to keep it secret while hoping to find a way to save her from dying, per the vision he had. The Jedi themselves could have tried to help Anakin, and he wouldn’t have felt the need to go to the Emperor. Then Darth Vader never would’ve come to be, Luke and Leia would’ve been raised by their real parents, and the Empire would’ve been defeated a lot sooner.\n\nWhen my family watched Rogue One, I honestly fell asleep, and woke up just in time to see Darth Vader kicking major behind with his red light saber. You go, Anakin, kill ’em all.\n\nAhem. Moving on…\n\n#2: I didn’t like the way The Hunger Games ended. I am not a fan of dystopia. Against my better judgement, I gave in to peer pressure to read The Hunger Games. Book 1 sucked me right in, and I committed to finishing the trilogy. This nearly killed me. I was Team Gale all the way, and I will never forgive Katniss for ditching him. I also thought it was just ridiculous that Katniss — who had most of the Capitol’s head games figured out early on — couldn’t get a clue that Alma Coin was completely using her, and just knock that horrible woman off much earlier. And Prim dies ANYWAY — come on, Suzanne Collins, but you just invalidated the entire premise of your series!!! That did not go over well with me.\n\n#3: I don’t mind the way Allegiant ended. I’m fully aware that to this day there are people sobbing into their Faction t-shirts because of Tris Prior’s demise. But I one-hundred-percent stand by Veronica Roth determining that was necessary for her story. I certainly don’t think her actions meant death threats to her email were required, folks. If you didn’t like the ending of the trilogy, just don’t re-read it and move on to other authors.\n\n#4: Superhero movies need to take a break for a while. Like approximately 17 years. Again, truly no offense meant to comic book fans who are gushing over some of their fictional idols finally coming to the silver screen. But, as someone who was never part of all that (although I have intense respect for Stan Lee), I’m getting a little…bored with all the superhero films. I’d just really like to see something different in the cinemas.\n\n#5: Radio stations need to play not-as-popular songs. There are lots of bands that produced much more content in their studio recordings than the one single everybody knows. Given that I don’t have access to Pandora or ITunes, what I can listen to is often limited to YouTube and my local radio broadcasts. Considering that I am terrible anymore with remembering the titles of songs/names of artists, that creates issues with searching on YouTube. And my regional radio stations are in general very mainstream and same old, same old, unfortunately.\n\n#6: Please, please, lay off the fairytale re-tellings for a bit. Oh, come on, blow out that torch and return your pitchfork to the garden. There are now so many versions of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Snow White in our culture that I’m simply tired of it. Why can’t we read more adaptations of Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, The Billy Goats Gruff, Puss in Boots, The Princess and the Frog? Or go in a totally unexpected direction, like the Beaumont and Beasley series does, by turning the traditional tales upside down?\n\n#7: While we’re at it, let’s give Sherlock Holmes and Alice in Wonderland a rest, too. Both of these classics are so beloved that modern variations are literally exploding in our culture, and that makes me weary of them. (Actually, can we add vampires, werewolves, and zombies to this, too?)\n\n#8: Musicals are unrealistic and dull. Back off now, Hamilton fans (don’t make me sic my cat on you). There is something about being in a theatre and watching a full-flung spectacle of acting/music/lighting effects, that transports you to a fictional place, and it doesn’t bother you that people wouldn’t really break into song just after proposing, or admitting they were a drug addict. But when I try to watch movies of musicals, I just can’t do it. The pragmatic flaws get to me too much.\n\n#9: Gel pens are overrated. While this may seem like a small thing to most of the world, I have very tight muscles in most of my body from anxiety, and trying to write with gel pens is too hard. Most of the time, the ink doesn’t flow well, and that means I have to press more, which leads to more tensing of muscles, and the problem is not fixed. (Ballpoints are definitely out of the realm of possibility these days.) I’ve had to switch to exclusively writing my long-hand drafts with rollerballs (which for some reason are generally more expensive and less available than gel pens).\n\n#10: Kale is disgusting. True, I’ve only tried kale twice, but both times it was so salty and/or so bland that it just made me gag. I know kale is one of the new “super foods,” but it can just go and be super somewhere other than my kitchen."
