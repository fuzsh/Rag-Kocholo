        "text": "Harry Carey Jr. (aka Dobe, born 1921) and his little sister Ella (Cappy) Carey, born late 1923, play with Navajo kids who lived at the Harry Carey Ranch in Saugus, circa 1925.\n\nThe bond between the Careys and the Navajo Indians who lived and worked at the ranch was tight. Cappy said she learned the Navajo language before she learned English.\n\nDobe said the Indians left about a month before the St. Francis Dam Disaster of March 12, 1928.\n\nAbout Harry Carey Jr. and Cappy Carey: [Adapted from harrycareyjr.com]: A Western character actor, Harry Carey Jr. is the son of early Western star Harry Carey Sr. and actress Olive Carey. He was born May 16, 1921, on his parents' ranch in San Francisquito Canyon (Saugus). He was nicknamed \"Dobe\" when he was a few hours old because his red hair reminded his father of the red soil in the area that was used to make adobe bricks. His sister, Ella, came along two years later (Nov. 16, 1923) and was nicknamed \"Cappy\" because her father, Harry Sr., was \"captain\" of his boat, the Ella Ada.\n\nDobe and Cappy attended Newhall School when it was on Lyons Avenue near Newhall Avenue. As children they got to know some of the regular visitors to the Saugus ranch, such as actor William S. Hart, humorist-actor Will Rogers, painter Charles Russell and their parents' good friend, director John Ford — who was at the ranch the day Dobe was born.\n\nDobe went to high school at Black Foxe Military Institute in Hollywood with the sons of other Hollywood personalities. As a young man he yearned to be a singer. While taking voice lessons in New York City in 1939 he got his first paying job at the New York World's Fair in the show, \"Railroads on Parade\" — not as a singer, but as a horseback rider, something he learned to do with great skill on the Saugus ranch. In 1941 he was hired by NBC as a page boy and then entered in the Navy. He shipped out but was quickly recalled to Washington by John Ford, who was working for the OSS — the predecessor to the CIA. Under Ford's \"direction,\" Dobe developed Allied and captured German spy film for the war effort. In 1944, while still in the Navy, Dobe married Marilyn Fix, the daughter of actor Paul Fix. She would remain his lifelong companion and gave him four children.\n\nIn 1946, Dobe followed his father into the motion picture business, landing a role in a \"B\" movie, \"Rolling Home.\" Next came a featured role in Raoul Walsh's \"Pursued,\" and he was on his way. In 1947 he made his first of 11 films with John Wayne, appearing in the Howard Hawks classic, \"Red River.\" Harry Sr. appeared in the film, as well, although they did not appear on camera together. Senior never saw it; it was released posthumously in 1948.\n\nIn that year Ford remade \"3 Godfathers,\" which he had made in 1919 with Harry Sr. This time Junior shared the lead (and sang) with Duke Wayne and Mexican box-office sensation Pedro Armendariz. It was his first of nine films as a member of the John Ford Stock Company — the others being \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,\" \"Wagonmaster,\" \"Rio Grande\" (in which he did some Roman riding, standing on two horses while galloping through Monument Valley), \"The Searchers,\" \"Two Rode Together,\" \"The Long Gray Line,\" \"Mister Roberts\" and \"Cheyenne Autumn.\"\n\nHarry Carey Jr. appeared in nearly 100 films and hundreds of television episodes, including numerous appearances in the Mickey Mouse Club series \"The Adventures of Spin and Marty\" (shot on the Walt Disney Co.'s Golden Oak Ranch in Placerita Canyon), \"Gunsmoke\" (early episodes shot on Gene Autry's Melody Ranch in Placerita Canyon), \"Rawhide\" (ditto) and others. He has made two documentaries, \"Legends of the American West\" and \"John Ford's America\" and is the author of the book, \"Company of Heroes: My Life As an Actor in the John Ford Stock Company,\" available in hard- and softcover editions. Dobe and Marilyn — and Cappy — live in Santa Barbara.\n\nUpdate: Dobe died Dec. 28, 2012.\n\nFurther reading: Harry Carey Ranch: Historic American Buildings Survey No. CA-2712."
