        "text": "The cord-cutting trend, and the runaway success that Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other streamers that produce original content have become, didn't go unnoticed at Apple. The rumors that it is circling the wagons to try and launch a streaming package mix of shows and popular channels like HBO or Showtime materialized as TV+, Apple's first foray into a new industry in a good while.\n\nThe standard Netflix tier now costs $13 a month in the US, so Apple's $4.99 is the greatest undercut among streamers so far, as Apple's original shows can still be counted on your fingers. We were hoping for a grand bargain on a package that includes video, music, news, as well as extras like AppleCare but to no avail so far.\n\nOn the other hand, new competitors sprung up in the meantime, and besides the heretofore mentioned Streamers of the Old Guard, Apple will now have to battle HBO Max and Disney+, as well as whoever else decides to jump in while it grows its catalog of original shows and programming.\n\nHBO Max vs Apple TV+ vs Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+ plan prices\n\nHBO Max, Apple TV+, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+ vs basic cable\n\nAs you can see, Apple's TV+ landed at just $4.99, free with any device purchase. This makes it the cheapest such service of them all, against HBO Max that would be the most expensive but then again \"it's not TV, it's HBO.\"\n\nIf you subscribe for all of these streaming services at their high tiers, however, it would all add up to about $80 a month, or slightly below the US average monthly bill for cable TV subscription when you account for taxes and fees.\n\nIn reality, though, you'd probably just tack one or two of these on top of you cable. Oh, the irony, streaming video was supposed to be the cord-cutter's dream that will free them from the cable TV shackles!\n\nNetflix vs HBO Max vs Apple TV+ shows and original content\n\nWith an installed base of more than a billion potential viewers who are used to paying for media, Apple could immediately become the next big thing on the trendy \"what to watch\" block. The team from Cupertino is nothing but ambitious - Eddy Cue is on record saying that they want to acquire or produce shows on the level of Game of Thrones, and, knowing Apple's money, they could very well do so. For comparison, HBO spends two billion on original programming, and Apple has tripled that amount for its TV+ debut so far.\n\nIn any case, Apple will have way fewer movies and TV shows than the rest of the competition at that November 1 launch, though, as you can see from the chart below, having the most content doesn't make for the most popular such service, as most of Amazon Video's movies are pretty old, plus Netflix has the highest number of original content in its roster.\n\nDisney Plus movies and TV shows list at launch\n\nDisney+ Star Wars universe\n\nLEGO Star Wars: All-Stars (2018)\n\nStar Wars Resistance (2018)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures (2016)\n\nLEGO Star Wars: Droid Tales (2015)\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles (2014)\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\n\nStar Wars: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nEmpire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy (2004)\n\nStar Wars: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nStar Wars: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nStar Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nStar Wars: A New Hope (1977)\n\nDisney+ Marvel comics\n\nMarvel’s Hero Project (2019)\n\nCaptain Marvel (2019)\n\nMarvel Rising: Secret Warriors (2018)\n\nInhumans (2017)\n\nSpider-Man – Series (2017)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy – Series (2015)\n\nAnt-Man (2015)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nMarvel Studios: Assembling a Universe (2014)\n\nThor: The Dark World (2013)\n\nHulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.

Here are all the shows Apple said its streaming service will be launching with:\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nApple's comedy and drama orders have multiple shows brought on by Reese Witherspoon. This one is a morning news TV series drama (or, maybe, we should stop calling them TV shows) with Jennifer Anniston and Steve Carell, and scripted by the House of Cards' Jay Carson. Another Reese Witherspoon mention is as a producer, this time for a \"You Think It, I’ll Say It\" scripted comedy by Apple, starring Kristen Wiig, of which there are reportedly 10 episodes already ordered.\n\n\"For All Mankind\"\n\nProduced by Sony Pictures Television and Ronald D. Moore (Battlestar Galactica), For All Mankind explores the future of a fictional global space race. Jodi Balfour plays pilot Ellen Waverly, joining previously announced Joel Kinnaman (The Killing, Altered Carbon), Michael Dorman (Patriot, Wonderland), Sarah Jones (Damnation The Path), Shantel VanSanten (Shooter, One Tree Hill) and Wrenn Schmidt (The Looming Tower, Outcast).\n\n\"Dickinson\" is an Emily Dickinson comedy (of all things) with Hailee Steinfeld\n\nThis coming-of-age comedy is set during the great American poet Emily Dickinson’s times from the viewpoint of Emily (Steinfeld). The retro environment mixes modern questions about gender's places in society, family relationships and the writer who is well ahead of her times. Now this mashup would be interesting to see, and with cast like Hailee Steinfeld (Pitch Perfect 3, True Grit) and producers Alena Smith (The Affair, The Newsroom). \"Dickinson\" will likely be a harbinger of what's to come in Apple's new streaming service - curated shows that won't be a dime a dozen to see what sticks like the Netflix approach.\n\n\"See\" series with Jason Momoa\n\nThe Aquaman Jason Momoa has been cast in the lead role for the Apple original series \"See,\" which is shaping up to be the most popular TV+ entry so far. Mankind, or what is left of it, is now blind, and the show sounds like an epic survival drama in the future. Momoa is playing Baba Voss, a fearless warrior and leader, what else.\n\nOprah!\n\nOprah Winfrey joins the world’s most compelling authors in conversation as she builds a vibrant, global book club community and other projects to connect with people around the world and share meaningful ways to create positive change. Starting with Ta-Nehisi Coates this past Friday, who else.\n\nAll HBO Max channels, TV shows and original programming\n\nFor starters, the new HBO Max service will be folding all of these content providers - HBO, New Line, DC Entertainment, CNN, TNT, TBS, truTV, The CW, Turner Classic Movies, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Crunchyroll, Rooster Teeth, Looney Tunes, etc. - plus a bunch of exclusive and original programming:\n\n“Dune: The Sisterhood,” an adaptation of Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson’s book based in the world created by Frank Herbert’s book Dune, from director Denis Villeneuve\n\n“Tokyo Vice,” based on Jake Adelstein’s non-fiction first-hand account of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police beat starring Ansel Elgort\n\n“The Flight Attendant,” a one-hour thriller series based on the novel by Chris Bohjalian, which will star Kaley Cuoco, who is also executive producing alongside Greg Berlanti\n\n“Love Life,” a 10-episode half-hour romantic comedy anthology series starring “Pitch Perfect” star Anna Kendrick, who will also executive produce alongside Paul Feig\n\n“Station Eleven,” a postapocalyptic limited series based on Emily St. John Mandel’s international bestseller, adapted by Patrick Somerville and directed by Hiro Murai\n\n“Made for Love,” a 10-episode, half-hour, straight-to-series adaptation based on the tragicomic novel of the same name by Alissa Nutting, also from Somerville and directed by S.J.

Good thing that HBO Max is launching in early 2020, but Disney+ is now a direct competitor, so Apple will probably have to bundle its TV+ service in more packages if it wants to notch a relative success.\n\nIn fact, analysts expect Apple to add 12 million TV+ subscribers in 2020 and 21 million in 2021 which is a pretty modest amount compared to the large subscriber base and catalogs of Netflix, Amazon, or Disney+. Baby steps, though, and if Apple manages to combat issues like piracy successfully, it might just add another steady revenue stream to compensate for flatlining iPhone sales.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nWe may wish to follow up.
