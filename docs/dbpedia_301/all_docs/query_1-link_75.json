        "text": "MAX Viewers were left furious online after the streaming platform announced a series of changes over the past few months.\n\nHBO's viewing service costs from $9.99 to $19.99 for viewers per month, but fans called for a boycott after they appeared to cancel favorite shows and raise prices.\n\nShows such as Our Flag Means Death and The Flight Attendant have been cancelled recently by HBO.\n\nFans, although initially upset on social media, took it one step further and created a campaign online to try and dissuade users from paying for Max.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, angered followers created the tag #Don'tStreamOnMax to emphasize their annoyance.\n\nA fan-led group named Adopt Our Crew sprung up earlier this year after news their favorite show, Our Flag Means Death, was being cancelled.\n\nThe show followed pirates on their adventures and featured key LGBTQ+ characters.\n\nThe group generated over 85,000 signatures to stop the show from going under, despite their best efforts, the creator announced they would not be going forward.\n\nFrom this, the group have been behind the boycott and released a social media graphic to give instructions to fellow viewers.\n\nIn the text graphic, they listed four reasons they are trying to call out the service.\n\nThese included HBO supposedly \"Removing diverse content,\" and \"Cancelling critically acclaimed shows.\"\n\nAt the bottom of the graphic, they asked fans to use the hashtag and add comments to spread their message.\n\nSeveral social media users took to their phones and computers to add their own comments.\n\n\"I #DontStreamOnMax because they talk ‘quality’ yet cancel their most critically acclaimed, diverse shows in favour of lower performing shows with big IPs,\" wrote one angry follower.\n\n\"HBO was once a prestigious channel, now it’s leading the death of television,\" they concluded.\n\n\"There isn’t anything but crappy reality tv and white-washed shows about rich people. If you want diversity and good storytelling, go anywhere else,\" added another.\n\n\"I #DontStreamOnMax cause a very talented showrunner made sure to give a hit television show our flag means death a happy end in s2 just in case it wouldn't get renewed, which it didn't, and it's a crime that talented people have to sacrifice their vision instead of embracing it,\" said a third.\n\n\"#DontStreamOnMax because they cancel all their best scripted diverse shows,\" emphasized a fourth.\n\nFollowing the beginning of the hashtag, which was first used in May, Warner Brothers announced they'd be raising the price of their service.\n\nOn Tuesday, they announced the price for watching HBO without adverts will rise to $16.99 from the previous price of $15.99.\n\n\"'Everyone is complaining about our company's service and the #DontStreamOnMax tag is growing at an alarming rate, what do we do?' 'uuuuh f**kin uhh raise the price,'\" responded an X user to the news.\n\nSAILING OFF\n\nDavid Jenkins, the show's creator, shared an emotional post on Instagram to announce the ending of Our Flag Means Death.\n\nHe uploaded a photo of an atmospheric sandy beach.\n\nIn the sand, someone had drawn the Jolly Roger flag.\n\n\"I can officially confirm that we’ve reached the end of the road. At least as far as this sweet show is concerned,\" he captioned the photo.\n\n\"After many complimentary meetings, conversations, etc it seems there is no alternate home for our crew. Thank you to all of you who sent us out with tremendous love and care.\n\n\"Your campaign was noticed across the industry. But more importantly it made all of us who worked on this show better able to deal with the loss.\"\n\n\"To you wonderful fans: thank you. You are lovely and earnest. Those kinds of things feel in short supply at times. But they aren’t,\" David continued.\n\n\"A love like ours can’t disappear in an instant. When we see each other off in mystic, say hello. We won’t say goodbye, because we’re not leaving.\"\n\n\"We’re just taking a breather until next time we can share something together,\" he concluded."
