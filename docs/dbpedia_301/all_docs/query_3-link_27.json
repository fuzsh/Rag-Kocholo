Tubi is a fairly new free TV streaming service that can help lighten the financial load.\n\nTubi TV is one of the fastest growing streaming services in the United States, and it doesn’t cost a dime. So, what’s all the buzz about?\n\nTubi – Company Overview\n\nHeadquartered in Los Angeles, CA, Tubi launched in 2014 as a FAST (free, ad-supported streaming television) service. They operate in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and several Latin American countries.\n\nIn 2020, Fox Corporation purchased Tubi for $440 million. Since then, the free streaming service has exploded in popularity. Today, they have over 74 million active users.\n\nHighlights\n\nMonthly Price Range: Free\n\nUser Profiles: No\n\nNumber of Screens: Unlimited\n\nHighest Playback Resolution: 720p\n\nFree Trial Period: Always Free\n\nWhy We Like Tubi TV\n\nTubi TV is quickly becoming one of the most-watched streaming services in the United States, even compared to incredibly popular paid platforms like Max (formerly HBO Max.) According to a recent study from Bloomberg, people spend more time watching Tubi than Max, Peacock, and Paramount Plus.\n\nWell, Tubi is free and features a user-friendly interface, which makes it easy to play in the background while doing other things. And, even though it lacks the latest film releases and original content (unlike the Amazon-owned free service Freevee), Tubi has broad appeal.\n\nFeaturing an expansive library of over 50,000 movies and TV shows, Tubi has something for everyone. Tubi’s catalog features content from studios like MGM, Lionsgate, and Paramount, as well as networks such as Starz, Lifetime, and A&E.\n\nTubi’s library is constantly updating and shifting, so there’s always something fresh to watch. Thanks to a recent deal with Discovery, Tubi even has some HBO series no longer available on Max, like “Lovecraft Country,” “Raised by Wolves,” and “Westworld.” However, unlike Amazon’s Freevee, there isn’t a lot of original content on Tubi.\n\n🎬 Tubi features high-quality films and series from major studios like MGM, Lionsgate, and Paramount.\n\nMany free streaming platforms advertise “live TV” channels, but it’s actually just existing content playing on a 24/7 continuous stream. Tubi TV, on the other hand, offers authentic (though limited) live TV with some real news and sports channels.\n\nSince Tubi is free, it relies on ads for revenue. Some capabilities you’d expect from paid streaming platforms are missing, like full-HD video, user profiles, and offline downloads. But, Tubi still has a lot of useful features, especially compared to other free platforms like Pluto TV. For example, you get parental controls and personalized watchlists.\n\nTubi TV Streaming – How It Works\n\nTubi TV is an ad-supported streaming service.
