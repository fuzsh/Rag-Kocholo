        "text": "If you’re looking for new movies and TV shows to watch on Disney Plus, you’ve come to the right place. The family friendly streaming service is adding a bevy of titles throughout the month of April, ranging from new episodes of exciting new original series to library titles from Disney’s back catalogue.\n\nA couple of the most exciting library additions are related to Star Wars, as Disney+ will finally make animation legend Genndy Tartakovsky’s original animated Clone Wars series available to stream for the first time. Ditto two seasons of something called Star Wars: Ewoks, an animated series from the 1980s. There’s even a segment from the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special being added to Disney+ this month.\n\nThe ongoing adventures of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier continue weekly on Fridays, building to the season finale on April 23rd. Just as with WandaVision, that finale will be followed by a behind-the-scenes documentary that delves into the making of the Marvel Studios series called Assembled: The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.\n\nRELATED: Here's How Much of That 'Falcon and the Winter Soldier' Episode 2 Therapy Scene Was Improv\n\nThere’s also new episodes of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, a continuation of the beloved franchise that puts Lauren Graham front and center as the coach of a new underdog hockey team while Emilio Estevez reprises his role as Gordon Bombay.\n\nAnd in terms of library movies, there’s Blue Sky Animation’s 2011 film Rio, which singlehandedly cancelled a Pixar movie with a similar plot, and the fantastic 2019 family fantasy film The Kid Who Would Be King. And there’s also director Gore Verbinski’s underrated action epic The Lone Ranger, which arrives at the end of the month and unfortunately carries with it some significant baggage related to its two main leads.\n\nCheck out the full list of everything new to Disney+ in April below.\n\nAvailable April 2\n\nCaravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984)\n\nEwoks: The Battle for Endor (1985)\n\nHigglytown Heroes (Seasons 1 and 2)\n\nMade in a Day (Season 1)\n\nNight at the Museum (2006)\n\nNight at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009)\n\nSecrets Of Sulphur Springs (Episode 10)\n\nSecrets of the Zoo (Season 4)\n\nSharks of the Bermuda Triangle (2020)\n\nStar Wars: Clone Wars (Volume 1 and 2)\n\nStar Wars: Ewoks (Seasons 1 and 2)\n\nThe Big Year (2011)\n\nThe Story of the Faithful Wookie (segment from The Star Wars Holiday Special)\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier (Episode 3)\n\nThe Island at the Top of the World (1974)\n\nThe Last Ice (2020)\n\nThe Mighty Ducks: Game Changers (Episode 2)\n\nThird Man on the Mountain (1959)\n\nWalk the Prank (Seasons 1-3)\n\nAvailable April 9\n\nCesar Millan: The Real Story (2012)\n\nFuture-Worm!
