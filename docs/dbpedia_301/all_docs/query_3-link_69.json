        "text": "Do you watch foreign television? If so, then what are some of your favorite foreign television shows? Any foreign favorite cartoon series, films, or movies that you like above others? Foreign television includes anything that does not regularly air in your area, country, or region, especially if they appear on channels like BBC.\n\nGrowing up in Michigan, near Canada, I spent a lot of my youth watching two Canadian channels called TVO Kids and CBC. Each channel featured an early morning kid's segment of shows made in predominantly [British] English-speaking and French countries like the UK. Among my favorites were Polka Dot Shorts, a show that followed a flamboyant, green kangaroo called Polkaroo and his cast of friends as they venture on a \"quest\" to find his titular misplaced polka dot shorts (lol). The show was live-action, so all of its characters were in costume. A few of my other favorites are the Wiggles, a show named after the popular Australian kid's group; Elliot Moose, a cartoon about an anthropomorphic moose and his friends and their misadventures; and 64 Zoo Lane, a show which showcased an assortment of zoo animals--all of whom lived in the main [human] character (a little girl)'s backyard, which happens to be a zoo--who would teach the little girl life lessons through stories from their time back in their respective natural habitats (forest, jungle, tundra, etc.)\n\nAs I got older my interests in foreign television grew ever broader. In high school, ages 14-17, I spent a lot of my lonely time watching Latin American and Spanish programming on the channels Galavision and Univision. Shows like Vida TV--a variety show which featured an assortment of entertainment, games, and interviews with Latin celebrities, and Lucha Libre AAA, a popular wrestling program, were an integral part of my Saturday afternoons. I also enjoyed many a Spanish telenovela such as Contra Viento y Marea and Rebelde during weekday afternoons. Believe it or not, I actually learned a lot about Spanish and Latin American culture and the language itself from these shows, and I found Lucha Libre AAA far more entertaining at the time than WWE (lol).\n\nIn addition to the above shows, I've always been a huge fan of IFC and Sundance Films channels' lineup of foreign television programming. Showcased on a regular basis is a ton of Far Eastern cinema, ranging from martial arts to drama and all things in-between; there are even some obscure anime series that are unlike anything that I have ever seen. Among my favorites are Ju-on, 47 Ronin, and Tokyo!.\n\nSo, yeah... Remember, what's foreign to you may not be foreign to others (i.e., Cartoon Network to a Malaysian kid is considered \"foreign\" to him/her, but not to an American kid...)\n\nPretty much everything I watch is foreign television for me. The Norwegian television industry is not all that strong and the few things they produce rarely is to my taste. There were a couple of family-type shows when I grew up, but that's about it.\n\nGrowing up I was exposed to several languages, I watched \"Pippi Longstockings\", \"Madicken\" and other Astrid Lindgren shows in Swedish, watched the \"Gummi Bears\" and \"Punky Brewster\" in English, watched \"Les Mondes Engloutis\" in French. I did watch a couple of dubbed things as well. \"Heidi\" had a voice-over dub (as in you could both hear the original German voices and a Norwegian dub where all voices were done by the same man), \"Silver Fang\" was dubbed to Norwegian (I've since found it with the original Japanese dub). And there was a French educational cartoon \"Il Était Une Fois\" that was dubbed to Norwegian as well\n\nI still watch a lot of foreign television and movies, I tend to prefer English speaking shows and movies, but will not shy away from other languages (for instance I like Asian horror, preferring it to Western horror) if it's something good. As long as what I'm hearing is the original voices, that's pretty much all I care about."
