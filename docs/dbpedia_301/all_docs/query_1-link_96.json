        "text": "Disney's streaming platform, Disney+, is here!\n\nIt features original series and television, in addition to existing Disney-owned content as well (such as Marvel and Star Wars movies).\n\nHere is every show, movie, and TV movie available on Disney+.\n\nFellow cord cutters, the golden age of television is among us. Sure, we've already got Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBOGo, and numerous others, with Apple TV and Warner Media's HBO Max on the way soon as well. But now leading the wave during this era of social distancing is Disney's new streaming service, appropriately called Disney+.\n\nThe biggest draw, initially, may be the fact that the platform hosts content that already exists from studios owned by Disney. What does that mean exactly? It means that your favorite programs from the Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars franchises will all live here. Additionally, since Disney now owns 20th Century Fox, The Simpsons' entire catalogue lives here as well.\n\nAnd with all these properties comes a myriad of amazing titles to entertain you, the kids, and the kid in you. Here is everything available to stream now.\n\nSign up for 7-Day free Disney+ Trial here.\n\nDisney + Originals\n\nOne of the biggest draws for Disney+ will also be—like Hulu, which Disney also owns—original series and films. There's a lot of exciting stuff on the horizon to look out for, including a number of series coming from Marvel-verse, like The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, Loki, WandaVision, and more. In the meantime, let's take a look at the Disney+ shows (and movies!) made a splash when the platform launched.\n\nThe Mandalorian (series)\n\nCast: Pedro Pascal, Giancarlo Esposito, Carl Weathers, Gina Carano, Taika Waititi\n\nWhat's it all about? Set between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, the first season of The Mandalorian—the first ever live-action Star Wars series—debuted and wrapped up last winter. With Jon Favreau (who directed Iron Man and The Lion King) as showrunner, the show follows Pascal (Game of Thrones' Oberyn Martell) as the titular Mandalorian, which probably sounds familiar because he is quite similar to a past Star Wars character you might remember: Boba Fett.\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series (series)\n\nCast: Joshua Bassett, Olivia Rodrigo, Matt Cornett, Kate Reinders, Julia Lester\n\nWhat's it all about? You remember the original High School Musical? Don't lie, you do. You're probably singing one of the songs as you read this. The star of the original may be one of our favorite guys these days, but this series pushes a new generation to the forefront, with a particularly meta twist. And yes, the title is no mistake: this is a series about a fictional high school putting on a high school musical production of—you guessed it—High School Musical.\n\nThe World According to Jeff Goldblum (series)\n\nCast: Jeff Goldblum (uhhh, of course)\n\nWhat's it all about: From National Geographic (also owned by Disney), this genius travel series will follow the legendary actor (star of Jurassic Park, The Fly, and Thor: Ragnarok, among other classics) as he, well, does just about any and everything. From tattoos to ice cream, each episode finds him exploring a topic without any prior research: going on camera with only his life experience and immense charm. What a glorious premise.\n\nLady and the Tramp (film)\n\nCast: Tessa Thompson, Justin Theroux, Janelle Monáe, Ken Jeong, Sam Elliott\n\nWhat's it all about: This 'live action' remake of an animated Disney classic (following the heels of The Lion King, Aladdin, The Jungle Book, etc.) is the classic animal-centric love story. Disney got quite the charming cast for the ride, too, as Lady and the Tramp are voiced by Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux, respectively. That's one cool pair of dogs, if you ask us.\n\nDiary of a Future President (series)\n\nCast: Gina Rodriguez, Tess Romero, Selenis Leyva, Charlie Bushnell, Michael Weaver\n\nWhat's it all about: Have you ever imagined what the world would be like if a woman was the President of the United States? Well, this series tells the tale of a young Cuban-American girl going through the trials of being a teenager, but with the ultimate career goal—a desire to become the Commander in Chief one day. And for those who are looking to get their Gina Rodriguez fix after binge-watching Jane the Virgin? Well, look no further, as she both has a role and executive produces the series. Talk about big shoes to fill.\n\nSign up for Disney+ Here\n\nDisney Animated Movies\n\nDisney's animated film catalogue goes all the way back to 1937, when the world had only been at war once and when animation required hand-drawing every damn panel (it actually paid off.) Your kids and nieces and nephews probably know all of these, but if you're looking for timeless quality to throw on while you're stuck in quarantine, we recommend Aladdin (1992), Big Hero 6 (2014), Moana (2016), and Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001).\n\nHere are the rest, in order:\n\nThe Golden Touch (short film—1935)\n\nOn Ice (short film—1935)\n\nElmer Elephant (short film—1936)\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\n\nSea Scouts (short film—1939)\n\nPinocchio (1940)\n\nFantasia (1940)\n\nDonald's Dog Laundry (short film—1940)\n\nThe Reluctant Dragon (1941)\n\nDumbo (1941)\n\nBambi (1942)\n\nSaludos Amigos (1943)\n\nHow to Play Football (short film—1944)\n\nThe Three Caballeros (1945)\n\nDouble Dribble (short film—1946)\n\nFun and Fancy Free (1947)\n\nMelody Time (1948)\n\nThe Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949)\n\nAll in a Nutshell (short film—1949)\n\nCinderella (1950)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951)\n\nOut of Scale (short film—1951)\n\nLambert the Sheepish Lion (short film—1952)\n\nPeter Pan (1953)\n\nThe New Neighbor (short film—1953)\n\nDon's Fountain of Youth (short film—1953)\n\nDragon Around (short film—1954)\n\nLady and the Tramp (1955)\n\nSleeping Beauty (1959)\n\n101 Dalmatians (1961)\n\nThe Sword in the Stone (1963)\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967)\n\nThe Aristocats (1970)\n\nRobin Hood (1973)\n\nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)\n\nThe Rescuers (1977)\n\nThe Small One (short film—1978)\n\nThe Fox and the Hound (1981)\n\nThe Black Cauldron (1985)\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective (1986)\n\nOliver & Company (1988)\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nDucktales: The Movie, Treasure of the Lost Lamp (1990)\n\nThe Rescuers Down Under (1990)\n\nBeauty and the Beast (1991)\n\nAladdin (1992)\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nThumbelina (1994)\n\nThe Return of Jafar (1994)\n\nThe Lion King (1994)\n\nA Goofy Movie (1995)\n\nPocahontas (1995)\n\nJames and the Giant Peach (1996)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)\n\nAladdin and the King of Thieves (1996)\n\nThe Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue (1997)\n\nHercules (1997)\n\nPooh’s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin (1997)\n\nBeauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997)\n\nBelle’s Magical World (1998)\n\nThe Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars (1998)\n\nMulan (1998)\n\nPocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998)\n\nThe Lion King II: Simba’s Pride (1998)\n\nDoug’s 1st Movie (1999)\n\nMickey’s Once Upon a Christmas (1999)\n\nFantasia 2000 (2000)\n\nThe Tigger Movie (2000)\n\nAn Extremely Goofy Movie (2000)\n\nDinosaur (2000)\n\nThe Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea (2000)\n\nThe Emperor’s New Groove (2000)\n\nRecess: School’s Out (2001)\n\nLady and the Tramp II: Scamp’s Adventure (2001)\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire (2001)\n\nReturn to Never Land (2002)\n\nCinderella II: Dreams Come True (2002)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame II (2002)\n\nLilo & Stitch (2002)\n\nTarzan & Jane (2002)\n\nWinnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year (2002)\n\nTreasure Planet (2002)\n\nThe Jungle Book 2 (2003)\n\nPiglet’s Big Movie (2003)\n\nAtlantis: Milo’s Return (2003)\n\nStitch!

For sports fans there's Remember the Titans (2000), Miracle (2004), and The Sandlot (1993). Even the die-hard musical theater fans have a place in Disney culture with Newsies (1992) and its Broadway counterpart (2017).
