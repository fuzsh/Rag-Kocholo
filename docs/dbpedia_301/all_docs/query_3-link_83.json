        "text": "The author of “And the Mountains Echoed” keeps a handy copy of “I’m a Lebowski, You’re a Lebowski: Life, ‘The Big Lebowski,’ and What Have You” on his bookshelf.\n\nWhat’s your favorite book of all time?\n\nThe collected “Poems of Hafez,” also called “Divan-e-Hafez.” Revered in the Persian-speaking world, Hafez is, for me, the supreme Persian poet. His verses of philosophy, mystical love and bold anti-establishment statements are filled with luxuriant images and magical rhythms that always enchant me. His heartfelt ghazals have never failed to move me, and still do today as they did when I read them as a schoolboy in Kabul.\n\nDescribe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).\n\nThe only two places where I can read for long stretches are in airplanes and in bed at nighttime. I read actual physical books and have thus far avoided the electronic lure.\n\nWho are your favorite novelists?\n\nJ. M. Coetzee, Jennifer Egan, Hemingway, Elizabeth Strout, Jhumpa Lahiri, Dave Eggers, Ian McEwan, David Foster Wallace, Junot Díaz, Kurt Vonnegut, Alice Munro (I know, she writes short stories, but many of them have the arc of condensed novels)."
