        "text": "122\n\nLollapalooza kicks off in Chicago on August 1, and the lineup is packed with stars and superstars, from SZA, The Killers, and Zedd, to Megan Thee Stallion, Hozier, and Blink-182.\n\nBut the four day music fest also has lots of performances from up-and-coming superstars, who are already breaking out, and their sets are going to be amazing.\n\nListen to my Spotify playlist featuring some of the latest music from the top acts at Lollapalooza. Check out the full schedule at Lollapalooza.com, and stay tuned for coverage from the festival here and on Instagram.\n\nLabrinth\n\nThursday, 7:00 PM – T-Mobile stage\n\nWorking with Sia on her new single, “Incredible,” Labrinth has worked with a number of major artists, and he’s considered a milestone British artist, with a lot of fans after his album Euphoria, for the HBO series, and his single “Mount Everest,” and “All For Us” with Zendaya.\n\nHe’s an eclectic, powerful singer, with a style that’s masterfully hard to pin down, and he’s bound to put on a show-stopping performance at the festival before Megan Thee Stallion takes the stage.\n\nChappell Roan\n\nThursday, 5:00 PM – T-Mobile stage\n\nChappell Roan hardly needs an introduction, but she’s one of the top rising artists at Lollapalooza, and her album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess is filled with catchy, addictive tracks, including her new single “Good Luck, Babe.”\n\nIf you haven’t already fallen for “HOT TO GO!” or “Red Wine Supernova,” then check them out along with “Pink Pony Club” and “Casual” for a preview of what’s to come Thursday.\n\nHayes Warner\n\nSaturday, 1:00 PM – BMI stage & 4:30 PM – Bud Light Backyard Stage\n\nFrom the bright, driven sound of her new single “Predator” to her modern take on Gwen Stefani’s “Just A Girl,” and her previous hit, “Breadcrumbs,” Hayes Warner has an effortless style that is filled with energy. Her music is bright, pop-fueled, and infectious.\n\nWarner will have her first EP out later this year, and I’m really curious to see her live performance.\n\nStray Kids\n\nFriday, 8:30 PM – Bug Light stage\n\nSouth Korea’s k-pop sensation Stray Kids were already huge around the world, but with Deadpool & Wolverine featuring “Chk Chk Boom,” that’s opening the band up to a whole new audience.\n\nThe band’s hits “LALALALA,” “Lose My Breath” with Charlie Puth, and their fierce new single, “SLASH,” are just a glimpse into this powerhouse group that’s taking the world by storm.\n\nD4VD\n\nThursday, 3:45 PM – Tito’s Handmade Vodka stage\n\nFrom “Here With Me” to “Romantic Suicide” and his new hit, “Feel It,” d4vd is smooth as hell, and with each release he’s showing off his range, style, and energy. “Feel It” shows off incredible range, and I absolutely love the vibe, mood, and tone.\n\nListen to his EPs “Petals to Thorns” and “The Lost Petals”. They’re both excellent EPs and I can’t wait to see what comes next for him.\n\nMatt Hansen\n\nThursday, 1:00 PM – Bud Light stage\n\nWith his gutsy and earthy vocals, Matt Hansen is making a name for himself with a sound that’s instantly recognizable. His covers of “Iris,” “Titanium,” and “Somewhere Only We Know” are iconic, while his latest releases, “Versions of Forever,” “Gravity,” and “Something to Remember” are heartfelt and moving.\n\nHis performance is one of the first of the festival, so it’s a great way to kick off Thursday at Lollapalooza.\n\nOlivia Dean\n\nThursday, 4:00 PM – IHG Hotels & Resorts stage\n\nOlivia Dean is one to watch. Her vocals are mesmerizing, her style is timeless, and every song is catchy and beautiful. “Dive” is an instant classic, and “The Hardest Part” is so heartfelt and sounds like honey. Dean’s new single, “Time” is what really hooked me though. The track is absolutely stunning, from her sweet vocals, to the rock-infused chorus. I see very big things ahead for her.\n\nMckenna Grace\n\nFriday, 6:50 PM – BMI stage\n\nMckenna Grace is best know for her work as an actor, but her new single “LOSER!!” is a punky-pop anthem. It’s fun and a bit funky, and her sound is evolving with every release. I love her energy, and how much fun it seems like she’s having\n\nAnd more!\n\nThere were too many must-see performances for me to put in one story, but I had to mention a few more.\n\nThe National Parks have a new album coming soon that is going to knock you off your feet, and I can’t wait to see them at the festival.\n\nThursday I’m also really curious to catch Tyla, and Flo. While Friday I’m excited for Megan Moroney, Blu DeTiger, Wilderado, and Raye.\n\nSaturday there’s IVE, Cannons, Tate McRae, Nia Archives, and Sam Nelson Harris."
