Trapped in a room. Can they escape?â or something like that. They actually explain stuff. And if thats not enough for you, there are discussions/reviews on the show! AND theres also a spoiler warning feature where if the review/discussion has a spoiler it will block the entire discussion and say âthis comment has a spoiler in itâ or something like that and gives you the chance to ignore the spoiler warning or not! and theres also a live chat while watching the show so if youre someone that NEEDS to discuss how you feel during a show thats perfect for you! if its too distracting though, you can always turn it off. theres also a learn mode, and it shows you the captions in the language youre watching in AND in the language of your choice. you can tap on characters/words and it would give you the definition. my only complaint about that is, its slightly too big and distracts a bit from the show. but its fine bc thats not why i bought viki anyway !! ALSO THE BEST PART:: MOST OF IT IS FREEEEE some shows are locked (you need the standard pass or the plus pass) but a lot of shows are free, NO CHARGE, NO ADS, NOTHING!! IN LOVE WITH VIKI !!!!! i promise you wont be disappointed if you get it ðª\n\nviola mad ,\n\nALMOST PERFECT! One subtitle problem...\n\nI love this app! First off, I LOVE that you can try out the app without committing even to a trial, by just watching some commercials. I watched two seasons of a show, completely free, before even starting my free premium trial. So great! I love the comments (although to make it even better, would be cool if they were live comments, like watching it together, rather than just time stamped with the show), I love that I can watch these shows with Spanish subtitles, and I love the shows that are available! Iâm not a big tv watcher so Iâve never subscribed to any streaming service before because I could never see myself using it enough to justify the cost. I can definitely see myself using this enough to justify premium!\n\nOne note though on the premium version: premium allows iPhone users to cast to a chrome cast, which is great because thatâs what I have in my bedroom. However, when I cast the subtitles are white with no background like on the app or on the Apple TV, so at times theyâre very hard to read. And I would also like the option to show or not show comments when casting as well, because sometimes I like to read them while Iâm watching because they can be funny. But the comments is more of a suggestion, whereas I think the subtitles issue is a legitimate need for improvement in terms of accessibility with this app. Otherwise, this is a great app and I highly recommend giving it a go.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThank you very much for the kind words!
