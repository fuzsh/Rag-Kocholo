        "text": "If you're planning on starting a podcast where you plug in a microphone, get a Riverside account and then just interview people, you're pissing away an opportunity. Yep, this one's gonna trigger most of the podcast hosts on here who have a branded podcast. And that's fine by me. I chose violence this week, right Dodge and his team? üòò This will be particularly triggering for any podcaster whose podcast's format is just two utter narcissists taking it in turns to flex their knowledge all under the guise of 'insightful content'. And even if you're not a narcissist, I encourage you to think about your motive for starting this kind of a show. I get it. It's the easiest thing in the world to decide to start a podcast, and then plan a series of guests, and just roll out the result, week after week, episode after episode. Nobody cares, mate. That's the truth. The format's played out. Bartlett ruined that market for you. That doesn't mean you can't do something new and unique to freshen up the format. I present an example of this for you in the attached video. The iconic song that everybody knows thanks to its drum fill - \"In the Air Tonight\". The beginning of this tune right up to the fill has been used on TV shows, movies and commercials throughout the 80s and 90s for atmospheric soundtracking, because it's instantly recognisable. Did you know, that it wasn't actually all that original a beat? Phil Collins took a drum beat that was available to everyone, and did something with it that absolutely nobody else had ever done. Here's the story. The drum beat was actually a PRESET on a Roland drum machine that was available for any budding musician to buy, and incorporate its sounds into their compositions. But Phil, being a visionary, took the idea, chopped it up, tweaked it, and turned it into something that had never been heard before. And now, we only ever think about Phil Collins whenever we hear that beat, regardless of what tempo it's played at. When you're planning your podcast, have a think about how you can do something a bit different, even if the idea you initally had isn't all that original on the face of it. And if you need help with this, you know where I am. I literally solve this problem for a living. #podcastmarketing #podcasting PS - not my hand in the video. Turns out there was a YouTube clip that helpfully demonstrated the original sound of this preset and so I 'used' this clip and made it my own!\n\nCulture geeks alert! There's a new podcast out there in Podcastlandia. Critics At Large, from The New Yorker, actually Cond√© Nast... It does the heavy lifting to help you feel smart in the face of an endless stream of cultural products we don't know what to think about (Cringecore), how to fully comprehend (Taylor Swift) and it does the reading for you (The Elon Musk biography). And TODAY I'm jumping off from their definition of #Cringecore and what that means to our cultural landscape. But more specifically, to podcasts. What is Cringecore? And why are podcasts close cousins? Do they want to be? Can we change that? Are there any cautionary tales that producers can take from defining this term, and outing it on a live chatcast podcast with three super smart cultural critics? I'll dive in to remember some cringeworthy moments of this history of podcasts, just to square the line. #artscriticism #podcasts #history\n\nHere‚Äôs the reality all podcasters must face: Edison Research reports that, of people who listen to shows weekly, 81% listen to 10 or fewer episodes, and 57% listen to FIVE or fewer. And when that next celebrity your listener loves announces a new show, they might drop YOU to fit them in‚Äîeven though you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot competitors.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not enough to be smart, charming, funny, accomplished‚Ä¶ on a mic. Not when your competitors are the most powerful in the universe. Just ask Tony Stark, Riri Williams, and Sam Wilson: you need a super-suit. That‚Äôs what a show should be. A strategically designed vehicle you step inside to enhance your abilities and give you new skills. The premise and format are built so you can fly out and meet your superpowered competition. ‚û°Ô∏è This fall, I‚Äôm taking on 2 new private clients to develop their shows and their abilities. If you want an irresistible premise, if you want to own an idea in the market, if you have meaningful things to say and questions to pursue and a desire to help others and resonate with them deeper than they‚Äôve experienced elsewhere‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs talk. You bring your expertise and ideas. I‚Äôll bring 1,000+ episodes and dozens of shows-worth of experience, ranging from 1:1 author and expert clients like Jenny Blake to brands like Salesforce, GoDaddy, Wistia, and Drift. But I don‚Äôt develop shows. I make super-suits. üòâ Why would your audience pick you and stick with you, when the biggest voices have podcasts too? Not because you‚Äôre smart, charming, or accomplished, but because you made the only type of show worth making today: Their favorite.

As I sit and process my grief after the final episode of The Traitors last night (don‚Äôt worry, no spoilers here), I cannot stop thinking about how much this show has not only stirred up the country - but has put *podcasting* into the mainstream. Every night after the main show aired, a visualised podcast was broadcast ON NATIONAL TV straight after. The BBC has long followed a format with the likes of The Apprentice and The Bake Off which has a spin off show to interview outgoing contestants with the help of comedians. It‚Äôs simple but brilliant. What‚Äôs also simple and brilliant, is taking this content and putting it out as a podcast. ü•πü•πü•πü•π and it makes me SO HAPPY. TV companion shows are huge at the moment because they allow for fans to indulge in more content relating to a product they already can‚Äôt get enough of. and it‚Äôs soooo so effective!!! Now think about this in conjunction to you‚Ä¶ üéôÔ∏èIf you‚Äôre an influencer, your fans will be dying for more content from you - there‚Äôs a reason they hit that follow button. GIVE THEM MORE. üéôÔ∏èIf you‚Äôre a brand, they TRUST you. Harness that by launching a show where they can engage with you on a deeper level. üéôÔ∏èIf you‚Äôre an expert, SHOWCASE your knowledge to those who want to listen ~on the regular~ don‚Äôt just wait for an opportunity to arise. The Traitors production team knew they would have a captive audience and they made the most of that - making the decision to put podcast mics on BBC 2 infront of a live audience long before they saw the viewing figures of the main show. That team knew that, no matter what the figures were, they wanted to serve their audience in a way that monopolises on how people consume - through on demand audio. Genius. Consider serving your audience in this way too. Shout out to Listen did an incredible job on this production. LONG LIVE THE TRAITORS AND LONG LIVE PODCASTING.\n\nWe've decided to do things a bit differently this season on the Mad Markarting Mums. While we love meeting up and recording every week, Kryshla and I realised we're not doing things as efficiently as we could. And that's not helping the podcast, and most importantly our valuable time or the small shreds of sanity that we have left. So here's how we're changing our podcast process up: Live Video - Every meaty episode, whether that's banter between ourselves or a fantastic interview will be recorded live. Why? 1. We then utilise a part of our social channels we know the platforms want us to use... 2. We seem to not mess up as much when we record live (don't ask me how. It's weird!). 3. We already video record each episode, so why the heck not? We'll be live usually on our Facebook page, Insta and YouTube channel (we're @madmarketingmums on all these channels and TikTok) YouTube Podcasts: YouTube is pushing for podcasts, we'll now share all our episodes there, tapping into a new audience. We'll have all our episodes published there as well. TikTok: TikTok doesn't allow 3rd party streaming yet, but our TikTok profile does have a 15 minute video allowance. We'll be chopping up episodes into 15-minute long segments to create series, and testing out landscape videos. Mad Marketing Mums snackbox: Which parent doesn't have the trusty snackbox in the boot of their car? Between meaty episodes, we'll be publishing a 10-15 bit-size episode. This buys back some of our time as they're much quicker to create vs long episodes. THink breaking social media news, quick tips, etc. Accessibility: Apple Podcasts is pushing for transcripts, and we want to be as accessible as possible to our listeners and potential followers. Would love to know what process you have found that works for recording your podcast when you're time strapped or have a lot of plates spinning. Let me know.\n\nRecently, two podcast hosts told me that their episodes on Quietly Powerful are amongst their most listened to. It makes me very happy to hear that our conversations have been appreciated by so many people. I do wonder‚Ä¶ what is it about the Quietly Powerful message that resonates so much? It has been my observation that many people ‚Äòlike‚Äô and comment on posts about valuing introversion and quiet people. I feel and hope that, perhaps, we are now collectively going through a process of noticing the quieter voices, including minority or marginalised groups more, and beginning to appreciate the amazing diversity in humans. I see greater visibility within traditional and social media for other groups whose voices have been marginalised - those who fall outside the ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô in a particular context. When you are not yourself in a minority group, it takes effort to notice and listen to people who are marginalised - humans naturally tend towards an in-group out-group dynamic. While we could do better, I feel we are getting better at listening to ‚Äòout‚Äô groups. My hope is that more people notice those who are quieter - naturally or maybe just in some situations - as they hold the wisdom of being on the outer edge of the group in some way. Not only will those quieter people feel seen and heard, the group will grow by learning from different perspectives. I‚Äôm grateful that my quieter voice is being supported by my more vocal colleagues through the medium of podcasts. Thank you in particular to Lisa Leong on ‚ÄòThis Working Life‚Äô and Alexis Zahner on ‚ÄòWe Are Human Leaders‚Äô, whose Quietly Powerful podcast episodes have proved so popular. Links to their podcasts are in the comments. #quietlypowerful #diversityandinclusion #podcast\n\nüëâ My wife and I had a top 40 podcast and we f**cked it up üëà I'm just sat here reflecting on the last few years and I'm reminiscing over the podcast my wife and I started in the Covid lockdowns. It was called 40s and F**cked. Why? Well, surely self explanatory...lol We actually created it as an experiment to see what we could achieve by just talking to each other at our kitchen table; being honest and expressing ourselves in our mid forties. While we 'knew' what we were doing - as both of us had long careers in broadcast and production - we didn't know whether anyone would care? That was the bit we were not ready for. I remember after a couple of episodes getting an alert saying we had charted in the top 100 comedy podcasts - one of the most competitive categories on Apple. I thought it was a joke. But, no...there we were. And there we were featured on Apple's top recommendations list too. How? Don't know - fluke I guess. That was the bit that was driving our success. We were above huge podcasts - ones that are now consistently in the top 20, with huge audiences. We began to get thousands of downloads and steadily climb the chart - that, combined with our lives at the time, weirdly, made us not want to do it. I know - it sounds strange, but it's the truth. We continued on, but not with a frequency that made our audience happy. Trust me, they told us. We then stopped - and that was the worst decision, in hindsight. After that we made more - but when *we* wanted to, and even tried to make people pay. But the initial audience had made a decision - we were not committed. They voted with their feet. The podcast never gained that kind of traction again - and when we launched the second series and extra episodes, competition heated up and Apple didn't feature us. We still had a small audience, but felt deflated as it wasn't what we threw away. I guess this is a lesson in being consistent and not giving up...even if things around you are difficult. If you do, you don't know what you could achieve... Will I do it again - maybe...Maybe we'll do it if we are lucky enough to get to our fifties. Well - we already have a brand, all we have to do is change the age! ü§£\n\nHere's some data you may find interesting if you (or your company) are putting out a show or podcast. This last week I launched the 8th episode of Sales Game, a retro style game show that combines practical sales advice with hilarious entertainment. After each episode airs I look at several pieces of data... - Total Impressions (how many people saw the content) - Total Video Views (how many people watched the videos) - Total Video Time Watched (how much did they watch) - Total Engagement (reactions + comments) The first 4 episodes of Sales Game my distribution model was to share snippets of teaser content on LinkedIn, and try to drive people to the full video episode (averaging about 45 minutes) to watch on YouTube. However, I started to notice a downward trend in the data (fewer and fewer people going to YouTube to watch it) so I made a change. For the 5th episode, the distribution model was to break up the episode into 5 different smaller segments (averaging about 9 minutes each). And I started posting those segments each day of the week (Monday through Friday) natively on LinkedIn. I've continued with that same native LinkedIn distribution model ever since. And, as you can see from the data in the carousel below, the shift to the new distribution model (starting with E5) dramatically affected every single statistical category. The episode that aired this last week has stats that has blown all the averages clean out of the water, which is super exciting. It feels good to have put all this work into producing it and see it trending in a positive direction. A huge thanks to the contestants and celebrity guests who absolutely contributed to that, too! TBH, there have been times when I've questioned whether the show is worth the effort (it takes a lot of time to put together), but the data trend is super encouraging. Why am I creating this show BTW? 1- It's fun as heck. I literally laugh out loud during the filming, during the editing, and then all over again watching the final productions of each show. 2- I've had the opportunity to meet some wonderful people in the LinkedIn community that I may not have otherwise had the chance to meet. Can't understate the value of this!! 3-It helps raise awareness for Popr.ai (which has led to more website visits and app sign ups). Hope you find this data interesting. Please feel to AMA about the show. I'm happy to share my learnings with you. Happy Saturday!"
