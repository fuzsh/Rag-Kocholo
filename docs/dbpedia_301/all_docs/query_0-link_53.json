        "text": "Gamers, rejoice! The Last of Us is getting series treatment from HBO. Taika Waititi is joining forces with Netflix for two animated series based on Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate factory, Christopher and Bobby will host a Sopranos podcast, and the coronavirus strikes TV — all in this week’s top headlines.\n\nTOP STORY\n\nThe Last of Us Film Set Aside for HBO Series Adaptation\n\nAward-winning video game writer Neil Druckmann and Emmy-winning Chernobyl writer and creator Craig Mazin will adapt video game The Last of Us for an HBO series.\n\n“From the first time I sat down to talk with Craig, I was equally blown away by his approach to narrative and his love and deep understanding of The Last of Us,” said Druckmann, creative director of Naughty Dog, the game development studio behind The Last of Us and Uncharted game series and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment.\n\n“With Chernobyl, Craig and HBO created a tense, harrowing, emotional masterpiece. I couldn’t think of better partners to bring the story of ‘The Last of Us’ to life as a television show. I’m beyond excited to collaborate with them,” Druckman said in a statement.\n\nOriginally planned as a film from Sony and Screen Gems, that effort was abandoned as even Druckmann expressed his own disenchantment with the project.\n\nHBO provided the series description in a statement:\n\nThe story takes place twenty years after modern civilization has been destroyed. Joel, a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie, a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal, heartbreaking journey, as they both must traverse across the U.S. and depend on each other for survival. The HBO series will cover the events of the original game, which was written by Druckmann, with the possibility of additional content based on the forthcoming game sequel, The Last of Us Part II, which will release on May 29, 2020.\n\nDruckmann and Mazin will write and executive produce; Carolyn Strauss (Emmy-winner for HBO’s Game of Thrones and Chernobyl) also executive produces along with Naughty Dog President Evan Wells. The project is a co-production with Sony Pictures Television and in association with PlayStation Productions. The Last of Us is the first television series from PlayStation Productions.\n\nTaika Waititi Will Develop Two Animated Series Based on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n\nNetflix has found the golden ticket: The streaming service will host two animated series from JoJo Rabbit Oscar winner Taika Waititi, both offering fresh takes on the Roald Dahl classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nThe first series will be set in the world of Willy Wonka, with characters from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, while the second ‘toon will specifically feature Waititi’s version of the Oompa Loompas, those singing Wonka delights.\n\n“If (Roald) Dahl had created a character of a filmmaker to adapt his work, I’m pretty sure he would have created Taika,” Netflix Vice President of Original Animation Melissa Cobb said in a statement.\n\nThe Wonka projects are far from Waititi’s only upcoming works on TV. He will also reportedly return to work on season 2 of Disney+’s The Mandalorian (after directing the first season finale), and will also return for the sophomore season of FX’s comedy What We Do in the Shadows, after serving as co-writer, director, and executive producer on the series’ debut season.\n\nAs previously reported, he’s also working with Jude Law to develop The Auteur, a half-hour horror-comedy series for Showtime, about a movie producer whose last release flopped, sending him into a desperate state during which he accidentally traps his cast and crew on a backlot with serial killer.\n\nCoronavirus Disrupts TV Production and Events\n\n(Photo by Monty Brinton/CBS)\n\nThe coronavirus (Covid-19) not only has film studios rescheduling their features, it is leaving its mark on the TV industry, as well.\n\nFirst Amazing Race halted production on its 33rd season, and European content conference MIPTV 2020 has been canceled. Now SWSW — which lost presenters in Apple, Netflix, Amazon Studios, Twitter, WarnerMedia, Facebook, and TikTok and celeb attendees including Trent Reznor and Ozzy Osbourne — also canceled its March events.\n\n“We are devastated to share this news with you,” SXSW organizers wrote in an event update on SXSW.com. “’The show must go on’ is in our DNA, and this is the first time in 34 years that the March event will not take place. We are now working through the ramifications of this unprecedented situation.”\n\nFox News has canceled its upfront presentation for later this month in New York. Disney has canceled its European launch of Disney+ in London. And Japan’s Olympic minister has suggested the Summer Games could be postponed until later in 2020. (Deadline)\n\nAs of now, PaleyFest 2020 – featuring cast members and showrunners from The Mandalorian, The Boys, Star Trek: Picard, Schitt’s Creek, Outlander, Ozark, and more – is still on for March 13-22 in L.A.\n\nRead Also: No Time to Die Gets Pushed Back to November, and More Movie News\n\nA Triple Dose of Courteney Cox Coming Back to TV: Friends Reunion, Game Show, and a Horror-Comedy Series\n\n(Photo by Jordin Althaus/E! Entertainment/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)\n\nCourteney Cox is headed back to primetime via Starz’s Shining Vale, a horror-comedy series from Divorce creator Sharon Horgan and Jeff Astrof, co-creator of NBC’s Trial & Error. Cox will play the mom of a dysfunctional family who leaves the city to move to a small town. They take up residence in a house where a lot of bad things have happened, but mom Pat is the only one who notices. That leads her to believe she’s either possessed or depressed — the symptoms are the same for both.\n\nAnd two sure-thing C.C. sightings ahead: that Friends reunion we’re all living for on HBO Max, and, as part of its Red Nose Day fundraiser, NBC will air the special Celebrity Escape Room, with Jack Black hosting contestants Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Ben Stiller, and Adam Scott. The special will air on May 21, followed by a two-hour variety show telethon that will raise money for childhood poverty charities.\n\nOprah Creates Apple TV+ Special To Address American Dirt Book Controversy\n\nIt’s Oprah Winfrey’s multimedia world we live in, and she’s going the Apple TV+ route to address the recent controversy surrounding author Jeanine Cummins’ bestseller American Dirt, and Oprah’s own role in the literary drama. At midnight ET on March 6, Winfrey will premiere a two-part interview with Cummins, plus authors Reyna Grande, Julissa Arce and Esther Cepeda, and members of the Latinx community, followed by a discussion with Latinx people “who saw themselves reflected in the book and share their insights into real-life migrant experiences,” according to Apple.\n\nAmerican Dirt, which tells the story of a Mexican mother and son who try to make their way to the American border after the rest of their family is murdered by a cartel, has drawn the ire of readers who accuse Cummins – who identified as white before revealing she has a Puerto Rican grandmother, Vulture reports – of being “appropriative” in telling the story. The book has sparked discussion about who has the right to tell stories outside their own cultures and experiences, and Winfrey found herself pulled into the mix (and the target of anger from some of those readers) after she selected the book for her Oprah’s Book Club.\n\nNew Trailers: Hugh Jackman Dishes Up Some Bad Education on HBO\n\nMore trailers:\n\nPenny Dreadful: City of Angels, season 1, starring Natalie Dormer (Showtime)\n\nI Know This Much Is True, drama starring Mark Ruffalo (HBO)\n\nStranger Things, season 4 table read (Netflix)\n\nKilling Eve, season 3, starring Sandra Oh (BBC America)\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows, season 2 teaser (FX)\n\nThe English Game, season 1, from Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes (Netflix)\n\nBreeders, season 1, family comedy starring Martin Freeman (FX)\n\nThe Last O.G., season 3, starring Tracy Morgan and Tiffany Haddish (TBS)\n\nBelgravia, limited series based on the Julian Fellowes novel (EPIX)\n\nHome Before Dark, season 1, starring Brooklynn Prince and Jim Sturgess (Apple TV+)\n\nTransformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy: Siege, season 1, animated series (Netflix)\n\nBoomerang, season 2, with all episodes directed by women of color (BET)\n\nElite, season 3, Spanish teen drama (Netflix)\n\nFuture Man, season 3, starring Josh Hutcherson (Hulu)\n\nOn My Block, season 3, teen comedy (Netflix)\n\nTales From the Loop, season 1, starring Rebecca Hall (Amazon Video)\n\nGo Karts, coming-of-age racing movie (Netflix)\n\nFor all the latest TV and streaming trailers, subscribe to the Rotten Tomatoes TV YouTube channel.\n\nCasting News: Silicon Valley Star Thomas Middleditch Needs a Kidney in Chuck Lorre’s B Positive\n\n(Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for 101 Studios)\n\nSilicon Valley star Thomas Middleditch will star in Chuck Lorre’s CBS comedy pilot B Positive, about a recently-divorced dad, Drew, who needs a kidney donor.
