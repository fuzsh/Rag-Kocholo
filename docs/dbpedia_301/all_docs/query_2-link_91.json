        "text": "I finished watching both Hilda and Gravity Falls recently, and I'm kind of in withdrawal. These shows were so amazing!! I'm wondering what I should be watching now... Any ideas? Here is a list of animated shows I already watched that I loved:\n\nHilda\n\nGravity Falls\n\nAdventure Time (aka The Best of All Time)\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra\n\nBoJack Horseman\n\nSo what should I be watching next? And please tell me why I should watch the shows you're recommending :)\n\n(Also, please note that I'm not an anime person at all, so please do not recommend anime shows as I probably won't want to watch them.)\n\nI watched about 10 episodes of the first season. It was good! But it didn't have the same emotional impact as the other shows I listed. Should I continue watching?\n\nOh, yes! I know I should definitely be watching this... Is the show over?\n\nYep. It ended last May with 52 episodes. It's a show that ramps up overtime before becoming great in Season 4 & 5.\n\nYou should also watch Owl House which is still running (recently finished season 1)\n\nAlso, every animated shows nowadays is \"we watched Adventure Time/Steven Universe and want to do that\" lol. Including the shows in your OP\n\nI watched about 10 episodes of the first season. It was good! But it didn't have the same emotional impact as the other shows I listed. Should I continue watching?\n\nOh, yes! I know I should definitely be watching this... Is the show over?\n\nYes to both of your quesitons. Steven Universe takes about 25 eps to really kick off, but it's worth it.\n\nPretty much the top animation in the last 15 years:\n\nSteven Universe and Steven Universe Future (the epilogue series)\n\nGravity Falls\n\nAvatar The Last Airbender\n\nLegend of Korra\n\nShe-Ra\n\nStar Vs The Forces of Evil\n\nThe Owl House (this one is still airing)\n\nI might be missing some Disney Channel stuff.\n\nKipo, She-Ra (Netflix)\n\nSteven Universe (the entire series, movie, and sequel show is all on HBO Max), Primal (HBO Max)\n\nHBO Max also has Harley Quinn, which is straight one of the best comic book cartoons I've ever watched. If you're like me and was never a big fan of Harley to begin with, this is the show that will change that. It's freaking hilarious, but also very heartwarming when it wants to be.\n\nI heard about this one. It's good? How would you describe it?\n\nIt's one of the most unique post-apocalyptic shows I've ever seen. Basically humans live underground, while the surface is filled with mutant creatures, many of them sentient. And when I say mutants, it's less creepy, unnerving shit, and more really creative dope stuff like talking lumberjack cats, to name an example.\n\nDue to an incident, the main character one day finds herself above ground for the first time ever, separated from her people, and thus has to attempt to reunite with them while fending off mutant threats.\n\nThe lead is also a protagonist that brims with infectious positivity, she's very fun to follow. Also the entire main cast of kids are black, and the soundtrack is fantastic, made by the same person that worked on Spiderverse.\n\nAlso, please note that I'm not an anime person at all, so please do not recommend anime shows as I probably won't want to watch them\n\nAnime is functionally no different provided you get the right recommendations, but I hear ya\n\nI'm seeing Over the Garden Wall being mentioned a lot in different articles I'm reading. Anybody here seen it? Is it good enough to put on my list of things to watch?\n\nIt's very good. The only reason it's not being mentioned so far is because it's shorter & older. It was a part of an attempt by Cartoon Network to make a short but high quality series/special\n\nIn the same vein, I recommend Infinity Train, which is another short but high quality series from Cartoon Network (though it's been getting sorta-sequel series as networks have started embracing animation as being not a kids only affair)\n\nI heard about this one. It's good? How would you describe it?\n\nAvatar The Last Airbender meets Adventure Time with a splash of Attack on Titan\n\nHas an entirely non-white main cast, one of whom is gay, so it deals well with representation and talks about those themes in a very light and positive way, but one that doesn't feel like it talks down to you. The characters of the show have very strong developmental arcs, the world is bery colorful and for a post-apocalyptic world it's one of my favorite takes on that kind of setting. The animation studio, Studio Mir, is the same one that did the animation for Avatar. The music is absolutely outstanding, with it being a very musical show (this along with the setting is the Adventure Time comparison). The character arcs and development plus animation is very Avatar, and there are some plot and action and mythology beats that are very Attack on Titan.\n\nSo yeah. It's good shit.\n\nIt's about a girl named Kipo who gets thrown to the surface of an apocalyptic world from her burrow, because humans live underground, and has to find her new burrow that her old burrow people evacuated to. The surface is a whole new world to her and she meets a ton of new friends, including humans and \"mutes\" (mutated animals) alike.\n\nAvatar The Last Airbender meets Adventure Time with a splash of Attack on Titan\n\nHas an entirely non-white main cast, one of whom is gay, so it deals well with representation and talks about those themes in a very light and positive way, but one that doesn't feel like it talks down to you.
