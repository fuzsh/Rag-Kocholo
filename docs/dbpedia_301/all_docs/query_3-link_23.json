        "text": "A recurrent congenital weakness of 20th and 21st century television, literature, and cinema vampires is their porphyric susceptibility to ultraviolet radiation. Central to vampires’ continued undead life is the problem of sunlight. In this way, sunless environs like the Arctic and Antarctic represent what I describe as purely Gothic environments in whose desolation, cold, and darkness, undead life is able to proliferate, unmarred and unimpeded by the typical diurnal/nocturnal cycles of luminosity that trouble the undead lives of vampires. In order to theorize the value of the Arctic as an embodiment of Gothic-horror, this essay uses Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith’s 30 Days of Night (2002) as a case study of the pathetic resonances between the Arctic and the figure of the vampire. Following on from this, the analysis turns to Michel Foucault’s concept of the heterotopia in order to theorize the manner in which the Arctic, whose nocturnal/diurnal rhythms stand in radical opposition to the majority of seasonal cycles elsewhere on earth, represents an onto-existential paradise of death for the undead: a chronotope that embodies the essential attributes of the onto-existential condition of the undead.\n\nDisplaced from her beloved home in arid Arizona, Bella Swan of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight saga finds herself overwhelmed by greenery. Her new home on the Olympic Peninsula is surrounded by temperate rain forests lush with ferns, sitka spruces, and dripping mosses; even the tidal pools of the nearby beach are “teeming with life.”1 This profusion of green initially marks the landscape as a surprising setting for a gothic novel; as vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen quips, “No coffins, no piled skulls in the corner; I don’t even think we have cobwebs…what a disappointment this must be for you.”2 Edward’s comic reference to the crypts, dungeons, and graveyards of the traditional gothic acknowledges how firmly we associate vampires with scenes of death; after all, these monsters are the undead, animated corpses lurking in dark corners and ancient castles, lying in wait to drain the life from their unwitting victims. The landscapes they inhabit are landscapes of terror, where our most irrational and unnatural fears come horribly true.\n\nView\n\nWhen viewed from the lens of couture and class, the contemporary portrayal of the vampire as iconic in both sociopolitical and aesthetic spheres, and as icons of various subaltern, outsider, or what I call 'demimondeur' lifestyles, subcultures, and their attendant styles/fashions, offers an interesting analytical frame through which to examine the dialogic relationship between ideology, time, fashion, and class. Referring to Marxist thought concerning vampire capitalism and time, this chapter will discuss the issues and debates surrounding the portrayal of the figure of the vampire as what I will theorize to be a 'pure consumer', sociopolitical elite, and sociopolitical outsider, and its figuration of both the atemporality and spuriousness of ideology in The Hunger (1983). Using the Bauhaus post-punk couture or style of the undead in the film as an analytical frame, the methodology of this paper will be to perform a close reading of the film as a case study, focussing on its engagement with the sociopolitics, cultures, and phenomena of wealth, style, privilege, and time(lessnes).\n\nView"
