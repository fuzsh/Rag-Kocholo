Currently on NYC stages: Edie Falco in Frankie and Johnny, Jamie Lyn-Sigler in Beauty and the Beast, and Lorraine Bracco in The Graduate. Additionally, Joe Pantoliano will be the newcomer to Frankie and Johnny in 2003.\n\nNow, another HBO show muscles its way to the stage as Tom Fontana, the executive producer and creator of the network's prison drama \"Oz,\" and cast members perform a benefit at the American Globe Theatre, Dec. 5-8.\n\nThe Oz folk will star in a special five-performance run of The Day Jack London Got Pinched, adapted by Fontana for the stage based on novelist London's \"The Road.\" Linda Laundra directs cellmates Lee Tergesen (who plays Tobias Beecher on \"Oz\"), Scott Winters (who plays Cyril O'Reily), Kirk Acevedo (who plays Miguel Alvarez) and muMs (who plays the Poet) for the event.\n\n(Their fellow castmate Harold Perrineau, Jr., who plays Augustus Hill in the prison drama, recently opened in the Off-Broadway production of Joe Penhall's Blue/Orange at the Atlantic Theater Company.)\n\nPinched takes place in 1894 and centers on a hobo who is thrown in an Erie county penitentiary on a vagrancy charge. The source material, \"The Road,\" is an autobiographical tale written by London, the scribe known for \"The Call of the Wild\" and \"White Fang.\" London drew from his experiences with homelessness and the penal system for the book. The performances of The Day Jack London Got Pinched will take place at the American Globe Theatre, 145 West 46 St. (between Sixth and Seventh Ave.). For tickets ($25-40), call (212) 869-9809."
