Bringing over thirty years of experience as a stuntman, stunt coordinator and second unit director, Ellis is one of the most sought-after action second unit directors in Hollywood, garnering an impressive list of box office hits as second unit director on features such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, The Perfect Storm and the upcoming Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions.\n\nEric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber (Writers)\n\nBoth native New Yorkers, Jonathan Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress met in Los Angeles in 1994. Their first feature film, Blunt, was completed three years later, written by Eric and directed by Jonathan.\n\nThe controversial independent film toured the festival scene and won many accolades, including \"Best Comedy\" from the 1998 New York International Independent Film Festival and later the prestigious Lumieres in the 1998 New Orleans Film Festival, an award distinguishing it as one of the Top Ten Films.\n\nThe next year, Bress and Gruber sold their first one-hour pilot to Disney/ABC.

It was a fortuitous arrangement, as Reddick sold his original treatment for Final Destination to New Line Cinema. Reddick shared final screenplay credit on the film with Glen Morgan and James Wong.\n\nIn 2001, New Line purchased Reddick's treatment for Final Destination 2, and made him an Executive Producer on the project. With this sale, Reddick decided to leave New Line after eleven years in the summer of 2001 to pursue writing and acting full time. Reddick's first produced TV Movie, \"Return to Cabin by the Lake,\" recently aired on USA Networks.

(Film Editor)\n\nAfter graduating from the USC School of Cinema in 1975, Eric Sears began his career as an Assistant Editor for Director Martin Scorsese on the films New York, New York and The Last Waltz.

Her television credits include \"Season of Fear,\" \"The Laurie Samuels Story,\" \"The Substitute\" and \"Lake of the Woods. \"\n\nShirley Walker (Composer)\n\nShirley Walker composed the spine-tingling score for the original Final Destination. She will be frightening moviegoers with her equally chilling score for New Line Cinema's remake of Willard, which will be released in 2003.\n\nTelevision audiences were treated to Walker's dark, atmospheric underscore for the short-lived but highly-acclaimed NBC/Dreamworks series \"The Others,\" about a team of psychics. But it was her signature, high-energy, big-action, additional music that saved the day in Universal's 1999 film Mystery Men.\n\nWalker broke industry ground with her work on 1995's Escape from L. A. , a score she co-wrote with the film's director, John Carpenter, which captures the dark, futuristic feel and industrial action of the film while blending dashes of both \"old west\" and world music. She then firmly established herself as a leading talent among Hollywood film composers with her score for MGM's suspense thriller, Turbulence. However, the most heralded is her gothic score for the animated film, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, arguably the finest Batman film music to date.\n\nWidely credited as a pioneer for women composers in the film industry, Walker has maintained her status as one of today's most respected members of the composing community with her scores for the award-winning \"Batman\" and \"Superman\" animated series' from Warner Bros. , which have earned her multiple Daytime Emmy nominations and one win. In 1999, she added to her legacy the highly acclaimed \"Batman Beyond,\" with its futuristic, techno/grunge rock underscore, for which she garnered a Daytime Emmy award, the soundtrack now available from Kid Rhino.\n\nOther recent TV credits include underscores for \"Disappearance,\" a TBS film starring Harry Hamlin and Susan Dey; and HBO's popular \"Spawn\" series.\n\nWalker began her professional music career as a piano soloist with the San Francisco Symphony while still in high school, and later got her first big break as a synthesist on Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 feature Apocalypse Now, and co-composing credit on Coppola's Black Stallion in that same year. Award nominations have included a CableACE nomination for the Blair Brown film \"Majority Rule,\" a Prime Time Emmy nomination for the Fox series, \"Space: Above and Beyond,\" and two Annie nominations; one for the animated \"Superman\" Main Title Theme and, more recently, for her original score for HBO's \"Spawn\" series.\n\nJoe Bauer (Visual Effect Supervisor)\n\nJoe Bauer began his career in Visual Effects as a Supervisor/Coordinator on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" for Paramount Pictures Television. His relationship with the franchise continued for a two-year stint on \"Star Trek Voyager,\" where he received a Primetime Emmy award for the series' pilot episode.\n\nHis first feature was the action adventure Double Team, directed by legendary Hong Kong filmmaker Tsui Hark. He then worked with Walt Disney Pictures and director Mark Steven Johnson on the feature Simon Birch. He followed that drama with the sci-fi thriller The 13th Floor, produced by Roland Emmerich. He worked again with Tsui Hark and premiere action choreographer Yeun Wo Ping (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix series) on the Miramax fantasy The Legend of Zu. Most recently, he supervised visual effects for Bill Paxton's directorial debut, Frailty.\n\nJoe Conmy (Visual Effects Coordinator)\n\nJoe Conmy began his career working for Ivan Reitman's Northern Lights Entertainment. He moved into the Visual Effects arena on \"Hercules, The Legendary Journeys\" and \"Xena, Warrior Princess,\" where he had an opportunity to work with legendary Matte Painter and Visual Effects Supervisor Harrison Ellenshaw. Next, he worked with Joe Bauer on the Miramax feature The Legend of Zu, for director Tsui Hark and action director / fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping. Conmy was one of four Americans working on the picture, which was shot entirely in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most recently, he worked on Dimension Films' Scary Movie 2, with visual effects supervised by one of the early pioneers of digital effects, Ariel Velasco Shaw.\n\nAuthor : © 2003 New Line Productions"
