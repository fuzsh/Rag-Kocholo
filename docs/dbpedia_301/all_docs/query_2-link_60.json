        "text": "Summary\n\nAnimated horror TV shows cater to adult audiences with complex storytelling and innovative art styles.\n\nThe medium of animation allows for terrifying visuals, making horror TV shows even scarier than movies.\n\nShows like \"The Owl House\" and \"Love Death + Robots\" push boundaries in horror and fantasy storytelling.\n\nHorror is a well-known genre that requires a particular type of storytelling, and it turns out some of the best horror TV shows are animated. Though animation brings to mind a younger audience, plenty of animated shows and movies aren't suited for children because they are made to frighten and intrigue adult audiences. If anything, horror always has a place in the animation genre because there are fewer limitations on what can be shown onscreen.\n\nA quality horror television show must have innovative art styles, complex character development, and nuanced takes on morality and darkness.\n\nThough horror films are often the most talked about, horror TV shows can be scarier than most movies, and the medium of animation allows for visuals that make the stories even more terrifying. Anime is an important and well-respected part of animation and has been responsible for some of the best series on TV, horror or not. A quality horror television show must have innovative art styles, complex character development, and nuanced takes on morality and darkness.\n\n10 Tales From The Cryptkeeper (1993 - 1999)\n\nThe Cryptkeeper shares tales of monsters and ghouls that aren't too distressing to younger audiences.\n\nBased on the live-action series Tales From The Crypt, the lighter and less graphic Tales From The Cryptkeeper still offers plenty for audiences today. The titular Cryptkeeper is the narrator of the series, telling scary stories to the audience from his haunted mansion. It's the perfect series for those dipping their toe into horror and provides a moral lesson at the end. While it's intended for children, it's still extremely enjoyable to watch as an adult, thanks to its tongue-in-cheek references. Additionally, it's an important step in storytelling for the horror genre with younger demographics.\n\nWatch Tales From The Cryptkeeper on Prime Video.\n\n9 The Owl House (2020 - 2023)\n\nA young witch learns about the power of friendship and accepting others.\n\nDue to its success and high quality, many fans wondered why The Owl House was canceled after season 3. Unfortunately, there isn't much demand for family-friendly horror shows, and the series never gained a large enough following to stay on the air. However, the seasons that did get made do a great job incorporating the tenants of horror and fantasy into their coming-of-age tale. Luz is the hero who is a human transported to the Demon Realm, where magic and monsters are everyday occurrences. Notably, the series was praised for its commitment to LGBTQ+ representation and for making horror fun.\n\nWatch The Owl House Disney+.\n\n8 Gargoyles (1994 - 1997)\n\nIn some ways, it's surprising that Gargoyles was made, as its mythic and dark tone was a shift for Disney animated shows at the time of its release. However, Gargoyles has become known as a cult classic in the world of animation, thanks to the gritty visual style and serious subject matter of crime in New York. The gargoyles themselves are scary to behold, but it's them who protect the city from the forces of darkness. Gargoyles paved the way for future animated TV shows to push boundaries and the limits of genres.\n\n7 Love Death + Robots (2019 - )\n\nA horror anthology series tackling sci-fi, mythology, and legend.\n\nLove Death + Robots has drawn comparisons to Netflix's Black Mirror. However, the animated horror anthology has many aspects unique to the medium, making it far better than its live-action counterpart. Most episodes include violence and horrifying dystopian futures, but the horror elements are only the tip of the iceberg. While some have argued that the animation techniques and style surpass the strength of the storytelling, it's not fair to make that generalization. Every episode brings a unique spin on the formula, making the show exciting and impossible to pin down.\n\n6 Primal (2019 - )\n\nMan and prehistoric monster become allies in a terrifying reimagining of Earth's past.\n\nGenndy Tartakovsky, the creator of Primal, is an expert in the craft of animation, and this series continues the trend of relying on action and imagery to tell the story. Though there's a Primal theory that the show is set in the future, it takes place in a fictional past where dinosaurs and humans join forces. There is little to no dialogue, making it an excellent example of animation's visual abilities as a medium. Receiving universal praise, Primal might include plenty of horror and intense sequences, but it doesn't rely on that to carry the dramatic themes of the show.\n\n5 Devilman Crybaby (2018)\n\nThe most recent adaptation of a brilliant manga series.\n\nWhen the soul of a demon possesses the teenager Akira, he uses his newfound power to be a hero. However, his best friend, Ryo, has other plans for how to use this divine energy. Visually, Devilman Crybaby is nearly flawless in its execution and portrayal of boundaries between the human and demon worlds collapsing. Additionally, the show shines in representing the descent into chaos and freedom over the episodes. The series was able to transcend genre and audience expectations by taking its gorey and biblical themes and applying them to current issues of identity and representation.\n\nWatch Devilman Crybaby on Netflix.\n\n4 Courage The Cowardly Dog (1999 - 2002)\n\nA subversive exploration of horror conventions in a surreal comedic package.\n\nCartoon Network is well-known for its fantastic contribution to animation, and Courage The Cowardly Dog is no exception. The series seamlessly blends horror with situational humor, incorporating elements that people of all ages can enjoy. Though comedy and horror aren't often found in the same sentence, let alone series, Courage The Cowardly Dog uses the eerie and surreal to comment on how everyday occurrences have plenty of nightmarish qualities on their own. By using allusions to well-known horror film tropes, the series introduced many young people to the subversion of the genre.\n\n3 Castlevania (2017 - 2021)\n\nA chilling twist on the battle between monsters and those sworn to hunt them.\n\nIncorporating medieval settings and tones, vampire mythology, and expanding the lore of the video game immensely, Castlevania doesn't disappoint. Using Dracula as a character might have overpowered a weaker series, but Castlevania has enough narrative strength to overshadow the long history of vampire lore it draws upon. The magic systems are tight and make sense, and the character motivations are immediately clear. It stands above other series thanks to its storytelling, but also the fantastic work of its cast of voice actors.\n\n2 Todd McFarlane's Spawn (1997 - 1999)\n\nA man struggles to keep the forces of good and evil at bay and attempts to regain his previous life.\n\nWhen Al Simmons returns to Earth as an agent of hell, AKA a Hellspawn, after his death, he soon realizes his reincarnation isn't what he bargained for. Al is part anti-hero, part vigilante, and part demon, which causes him to attract trouble and monsters left and right, including battles between hell and heaven, which he has no interest in. To this day, Spawn is criminally underrated, as it is an early example of a genuinely scary and mature animated show that didn't stop at violence but used its platform to uncover deep truths about humanity.\n\nWatch Spawn on HBO Max.\n\n1 Attack On Titan (2013 - 2023)\n\nA dark adaptation of one of the best-known mangas of all time.\n\nAfter many seasons of intricate and non-linear storytelling, the ending of Attack on Titan requires explanation. However, it's a show worth taking the time to understand, as it's highlighted as one of the greatest animation series of all time, transcending its multiple genres. What makes Attack on Titan the best isn't just the fantastic action or terrifying Titans but the character study of Eren Jaeger and his struggle with the concept of fate. The series is unafraid to tackle heady subjects while simultaneously portraying mass death and destruction. It's not an easy watch, but it changed the animation landscape forever."
