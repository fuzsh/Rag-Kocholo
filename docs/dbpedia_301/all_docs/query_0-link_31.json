Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.\n\nEvery month, subscription streaming services add a new batch of movies and TV shows to their libraries. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for July, broken down by service and release date. Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.\n\nTV New to Netflix\n\n‘The Sinner’ Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: July 2\n\nBased on an acclaimed novel by the German crime writer Petra Hammesfahr, this moody mystery series has been described by its creator, Derek Simonds, as a “whydunnint.” In Episode 1, we see a seemingly happy housewife (an excellent Jessica Biel) commit a horrific murder on a public beach. In the seven hours that follow, a dogged detective (Bill Pullman) uncovers the tragedies in the perpetrator’s past that drove her to kill. “The Sinner” hits the sweet spot between smart pulp and arty melodrama.\n\n—\n\n‘Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee’ Season 10\n\nStarts streaming: July 6\n\nThis amiably low-key chat show from Jerry Seinfeld moves from Crackle to Netflix, but the format remains the same: Seinfeld picks up a fellow comic or actor in a cool vintage car, they drive around and talk about showbiz for a bit, and then they settle in at a funky cafe to go a little more in-depth about the art and craft of entertainment. This season’s lineup is typically star-studded, as Seinfeld grabs cups of joe with Dave Chappelle, Ellen DeGeneres, Kate McKinnon and Jerry Lewis, among others.\n\n—\n\n‘Somebody Feed Phil: The Second Course’\n\nStarts streaming: July 6\n\nThe writer and producer Philip Rosenthal returns for a second season of this surprisingly delightful spin on the food-and-travel show. Affable and curious, Rosenthal and his companions make friends around the world as they sample the cuisines of other cultures. The latest helping of “Somebody Feed Phil” will include trips to Buenos Aires, Capetown, Copenhagen, Dublin, Venice and New York — and plenty of shots of the host looking deliriously happy as he tries something new.\n\n—\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
