        "text": "It has been a year since the coronavirus pandemic broke out and none of us could have predicted what was yet to come. With April Fool's Day right around the corner, spring opens its doors to countless new streaming options. Netflix navigates us through a new cycle of 'Too Hot to Handle' and 'The Circle', introducing us to its new scheduling strategy. HBO Max will be releasing the new super rated-R 'Mortal Kombat' starring Kate Winslet who has come a long way from 'Titanic'.\n\nHulu will welcome back its most popular original series in April, along with a trio of buzz-worthy documentaries and some '90s movie favourites. The streaming service also has a few high-profile documentaries such as 'WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn' (April 2), whose title is pretty self-explanatory; 'Hysterical' (April 3), which profiles female stand-up comics and streams a day after it airs on FX; and 'Sasquatch' (April 20), a three-part series produced by the Duplass brothers investigating whether Bigfoot killed three Northern California pot growers in 1993.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney + will debut the John Stamos basketball dramedy 'Big Shot', which is sure to get the whole family emotional.\n\nWhat is coming out on Netflix in April 2021?\n\nNetflix is releasing a slew of new stuff in April, including the return of a reality hit and a much-anticipated new fantasy series.\n\nThat would be 'Shadow and Bone' (April 23), the series adaptation of the hugely popular YA novels from Leigh Bardugo. Jessie Mei Li stars as Alina, an orphan in a war-torn country who discovers she has mystical powers that could change the fate of her world.\n\nApril 1\n\n2012\n\nCop Out\n\nFriends with Benefits\n\nInsidious\n\nLegally Blonde\n\nLeprechaun\n\nMagical Andes: Season 2\n\nThe Pianist\n\nThe Possession\n\nPrank Encounters: Season 2\n\nSecrets of Great British Castles: Season 1\n\nTersanjung the Movie\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife\n\nTyler Perry's Madea's Big Happy Family\n\nWhite Boy\n\nWorn Stories\n\nYes Man\n\nApril 2\n\nConcrete Cowboy\n\nJust Say Yes\n\nMadame Claude\n\nThe Serpent\n\nSky High\n\nApril 3\n\nEscape from Planet Earth\n\nApril 4\n\nWhat Lies Below\n\nApril 5\n\nCoded Bias\n\nFamily Reunion: Part 3\n\nApril 6\n\nThe Last Kids on Earth: Happy Apocalypse to You\n\nApril 7\n\nThe Big Day: Collection 2\n\nDolly Parton: A MusiCares Tribute\n\nSnabba Cash\n\nThis Is A Robbery: The World's Biggest Art Heist\n\nThe Wedding Coach\n\nApril 8\n\nThe Way of the Househusband\n\nApril 9\n\nHave You Ever Seen Fireflies?\n\nNight in Paradise\n\nThunder Force\n\nApril 10\n\nThe Stand-In\n\nApril 11\n\nDiana: The Interview that Shook the World\n\nApril 12\n\nNew Gods: Nezha Reborn\n\nNicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn: Seasons 1-4\n\nApril 13\n\nThe Baker and the Beauty: Season 1\n\nMighty Express: Season 3\n\nMy Love: Six Stories of True Love\n\nApril 14\n\nDad Stop Embarrassing Me!\n\nThe Circle: Season 2\n\nLaw School\n\nThe Soul\n\nWhy Did You Kill Me?\n\nApril 15\n\nDark City Beneath the Beat\n\nThe Master\n\nRide or Die\n\nApril 16\n\nArlo the Alligator Boy\n\nAjeeb Daastaans\n\nBarbie & Chelsea The Lost Birthday\n\nCrimson Peak\n\nFast & Furious Spy Racers: Season 4: Mexico\n\nInto the Beat\n\nRush\n\nSynchronic\n\nWhy Are You Like This\n\nThe Zookeeper's Wife\n\nApril 18\n\nLuis Miguel - The Series: Season 2\n\nApril 19\n\nMiss Sloane\n\nPJ Masks: Season 3\n\nApril 20\n\nIzzy's Koala World: Season 2\n\nApril 21\n\nZero\n\nApril 22\n\nLife in Color with David Attenborough\n\nStowaway\n\nApril 23\n\nHeroes: Silence and Rock & Roll\n\nShadow and Bone\n\nTell Me When\n\nApril 27\n\nAugust: Osage County\n\nBattle of Los Angeles\n\nFatma\n\nGo!

Luckily, the wait for season four is almost over. The first three episodes of the new season will arrive on April 28, and new episodes will land on Wednesdays. Season four will consist of 10 episodes. A revolution is brewing with June becoming the figurehead against Gilead, and the latest trailer looks pretty intense.\n\nApril 1\n\nAmy Schumer Learns to Cook: Complete Season 1\n\nCaribbean Life: Complete Seasons 18 & 19\n\nChopped: Complete Season 44\n\nChopped Sweets: Complete Season 1\n\nChristina On The Coast: Complete Season 2\n\nDiners, Drive-Ins, and Dives: Complete Seasons 34 & 35\n\nDoubling Down with the Derricos: Complete Season 1\n\nExtreme Makeover: Home Edition: Complete Season 1\n\nGuy's Grocery Games: Complete Season 22\n\nNaked and Afraid XL: Complete Season 6\n\nSay Yes to the Dress: Complete Season 19\n\nTournament of Champions: Complete Season 1\n\nUndercover Billionaire: Complete Season 1\n\nUniKitty: Complete Season 3\n\nVegas Chef Prizefight: Complete Season 1\n\nWorst Cooks in America: Complete Season 18\n\nHigurashi: When They Cry: Season 1, Episodes 1-12 (DUBBED)\n\n2012 (2009)\n\n28 Days Later (2003)\n\nA Hologram for the King (2016)\n\nA Low Down Dirty Shame (1994)\n\nA Simple Plan (1998)\n\nThe Abyss (1989)\n\nBefore We Go (2015)\n\nBug (2007)\n\nBulworth (1998)\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)\n\nCaptain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1974)\n\nChanging Lanes (2002)\n\nChappaquiddick (2017)\n\nChato's Land (1972)\n\nCheech & Chong's Still Smokin' (1983)\n\nCohen and Tate (1989)\n\nThe Color Purple (1985)\n\nThe Dead Zone (1983)\n\nThe Devil's Double (2011)\n\nDevil in a Blue Dress (1995)\n\nDie Hard (1988)\n\nDie Hard With A Vengeance (1995)\n\nDirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988)\n\nDude, Where's My Car?

However, there's still more than one movie a day to watch, giving you plenty to keep you entertained when there's nothing on elsewhere.\n\nThe original true-crime documentary from IMDb TV makes its debut on IMDb this April. 'Moment of Truth' chronicles the murder of James Jordan, the father of basketball star Michael Jordan. Two teenagers in North Carolina were convicted, but the doc focuses on the corruption and politics within the county, as well as issues of evidence.\n\nApril 1\n\nA Soldier's Story\n\nAbout A Boy\n\nAloha\n\nAmerican Pastoral\n\nAnaconda\n\nBurn After Reading\n\nDaddy's Little Girls\n\nDear John\n\nFor Colored Girls\n\nFour Rooms\n\nFun Size\n\nG.I.
