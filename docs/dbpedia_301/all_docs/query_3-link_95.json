        "text": "600 Disney-Owned Film and TV Shows That Are Still Missing From Disney+\n\nin Disney, Entertainment, Movies & TV\n\nCredit: Disney\n\nWhen Disney+ was originally announced, Disney fans everywhere were under the impression they’d be receiving their dream come true: access to every Disney movie ever made right at their finger tips. However, the service is still missing over 600 film and TV shows from its library.\n\nUpon Disney+’s original release, Bob Iger, former CEO of The Walt Disney Company, stated the service would eventually host the entire Disney film library, including films currently in the “Disney Vault.” Although, as of current, it seems the service is simply spiraling through Disney content for short periods of time and missing much of the company’s content.\n\nAs we’ve reported in the past, similar to other streaming services, it seems Disney+ features different movies throughout the year only for short periods of time. Films that are typically announced a month in advance prior to premiering on the platform.\n\nBut again, unlike Iger’s original announcement, some of these films do not stay on the platform and are eventually taken away.\n\nAdditionally, the service is yet to premiere many movies and TV shows owned by The Walt Disney Company, which has prompted some to start an #OpenTheVault campaign.\n\nAs shared by What’s On Disney Plus, this long list is divided into eight different categories and includes some films you may have forgotten of yourself but still would enjoy if available on the platform.\n\nIn the past, Disney has been open to adding new titles at the request of fans on social media but given how long this list is and different licensing contracts and usage rights tied around some of these films, it may be a while before they could all end up on Disney+, if ever.\n\nLIVE-ACTION AND ANIMATED TV SERIES (DISNEY LEGACY AND SELECT ABC TITLES)\n\nDisneyland, USA miniseries (include 1955 Dateline special + other programs from Disney Treasures 2001 DVD and Disneyland: Secrets, Stories, & Magic Treasures 2007 DVD)\n\nThe Mickey Mouse Club (1955–1959, 1977–1978, 1989–1994)\n\nThe Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure (1956, 19 episodes)\n\nZorro (1957-1961, 78 episodes plus 4 specials)\n\nAnnette (miniseries, 1957-1958)\n\nThe Nine Lives of Elfego Baca (miniseries, 1958)\n\nThe Swamp Fox (miniseries, 1959-1961)\n\nDr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (miniseries, 1964)\n\nThe Adventures of Gallegher (miniseries, 1965-1968)\n\nSchoolhouse Rock!
