        "text": "Naruto Shippuden showed the knucklehead ninja ditch the all-orange jumpsuit in favor of a more sleek black and orange fit, reasonable for someone entering their teenage years. Throughout the series, though, we see his transformations alter his design drastically. Sage Mode, for example, gives him his cleanest pieces yet: a red cloak that he seemingly attained at Mount Myoboku, along with a scroll to match — and some pretty dope orange eyeshadow. This outfit resembles a mix of his father, Minato, and his mentor, Jiraiya. KCM 1 and 2 are also phenomenal, with contrasting marks depicting his lineage, his connection to the Nine Tails, and various other details. When he enters Six Paths Sage Mode, all of these things are ramped up to the nth degree. The form serves as a visual culmination of his abilities, with brand-new additions from the Sage of Six Paths himself. It's a hard question, but of these forms, which one has the best design? I feel like OG Sage Mode takes the cake!\n\nCardcaptor Sakura is, to me, the champion of monster taming anime. While it's often overshadowed by its magical girl label, this anime showcases a unique approach to the genre. Its stunning card designs and rich lore create a captivating world, while its focus on friendship and companionship sets it apart. Sakura’s journey to capture the Clow Cards is more than just collecting creatures; she has to do so in order to contain her powers before they get out of hand. The stakes are much higher than simply collecting monsters for the sake of collection or befriending."
