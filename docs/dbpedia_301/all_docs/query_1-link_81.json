Simple homemade traps that use vinegar are often constructed to attract and kill gnats.\n\n11 Shelter org. : SPCA\n\nUnlike most developed countries, the US has no umbrella organization with the goal of preventing cruelty to animals. Instead there are independent organizations set up all over the nation using the name SPCA. Having said that, there is an organization called the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) that was originally intended to operate across the country, but really it now focuses its efforts in New York City.\n\n15 __ capsule : TIME\n\nA time capsule is a container of items chosen to help someone in the future understand society at the time the container is sealed. Although time capsules have been around at least from the 18th century, the term “time capsule” wasn’t coined until 1938.\n\n19 Set of beliefs : CREDO\n\nA creed or credo is a profession of faith, or a system of belief or principles. “Credo” is Latin for “I believe”.\n\n21 Chalky powder : TALC\n\nTalc is a mineral, hydrated magnesium silicate.

London’s most famous works are “The Call of the Wild” and “White Fang”, both of which are set in the Klondike Gold Rush.\n\n44 Filling station number : OCTANE\n\nThe difference between a premium and regular gasoline is its octane rating. The octane rating is a measure of the resistance of the gasoline to auto-ignition i.e. its resistance to ignition just by virtue of being compressed in the cylinder. This auto-ignition is undesirable as multiple-cylinder engines are designed so that ignition within each cylinder takes place precisely when the plug sparks, and not before. If ignition occurs before the spark is created, the resulting phenomenon is called “knocking”. We sometimes use the adjective “high-octane” to mean “intense, dynamic, high-powered”\n\n53 Actress who plays Anita Hill in the HBO film “Confirmation” : KERRY WASHINGTON\n\nActress Kerry Washington really hit the bug time with her lead performances in the political thriller TV series “Scandal” that aired from 1012 to 2108.

That’s one of the main reasons there is great concern about diminishing populations of wild bees.\n\n99 Dowel : PEG\n\nA dowel is a rod made from plastic, wood or metal. In its complete form, it is referred to as a “dowel rod”. We are perhaps more used to the rod cut into short lengths known as “dowel pins”.\n\n102 Italian saint who founded a Franciscan religious order : CLARE OF ASSISI\n\nClare of Assisi was one of the first followers of Saint Francis of Assisi. Clare was the founder of the Order of Poor Ladies.

The Lhasa apso has been around since 800 BC and is one of the oldest breeds in the world, one very closely related to the ancestral wolf.\n\n117 Non opposite : OUI\n\nIn French, “oui” (yes) or “non” (no) might be responses to “un questionnaire” (a questionnaire).\n\n118 Driver of many trailers : ADAM\n\nAdam Driver is an actor perhaps best known to TV audiences for playing Adam Sackler on the show “Girls” that airs on HBO. Driver’s movie career got a huge boost in 2015 when he played villain Kylo Ren in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”.\n\nThe term “trailer” was originally used in the film industry to describe advertisements for upcoming features. These trailers were originally shown at the end of a movie being screened, hence the name. This practice quickly fell out of favor as theater patrons usually left at the end of the movie without paying much attention to the trailers. So, the trailers were moved to the beginning of the show, but the term “trailer” persisted.\n\n120 Matinee idol of the 1930s and 1940s : TYRONE POWER\n\nTyrone Power was a Hollywood actor from Cincinnati, Ohio. Power tended to play the romantic lead, as well as the swashbuckler that was so popular in the thirties.

He died on set, suffering a massive heart attack while filming a sword duel with his friend George Sanders. Power was only 44 years of age.\n\n123 Arizona landform : MESA\n\n“Mesa” is the Spanish for “table” and is how we get the term “mesa” that describes the geographic feature.

A butte is a much narrower formation, taller than it is wide.\n\n124 “Laugh-In” comedian Johnson : ARTE\n\nArte Johnson, as well as being a frequent judge on “The Gong Show”, played the German soldier on “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In”.

We use the term “elysian” to describe somewhere or something blissful or edenic.\n\n129 Cinch of a course : EASY A\n\nThe term “cinch” was absorbed into American English from Spanish in the mid-1800s, when it was used to mean a “saddle-girth”. “Cincha” is the Spanish word for “girdle”. In the late 1800s, “cinch” came to mean a ‘sure thing”, in the sense that a saddle-girth can provide a “sure hold”.\n\n130 December candy shapes : CANES\n\nApparently, candy canes were created at the behest of the choirmaster at Cologne Cathedral in Germany in 1672. The sweet sticks were basically used as bribes to keep children quiet during services. The choirmaster specified that the candy sticks should have a crook at the top so that they reminded the children of the three shepherds who visited the infant Jesus just after his birth.\n\nDown\n\n3 One of Marge Simpson’s sisters : SELMA\n\nIn “The Simpsons”, Marge Simpson has two older twin sisters.

However, Atari never really recovered from the video game industry crash of 1983. The name “Atari” was chosen because it is a term used in the Japanese game Go that signifies a move that effectively seals the opponent’s fate.\n\n10 __-Cat: winter vehicle : SNO\n\nThe brand name “Sno-Cat” is owned by the Tucker company. All snowcats are tracked vehicles built to work in snow, and are famously used in expeditions to the polar regions. The modern Sno-Cat from Tucker differs from its competitors in that it has four independently-mounted tracks.\n\n12 Soul icon LaBelle : PATTI\n\n“Patti LaBelle” is the stage name of singer Patricia Holt-Edwards from Philadelphia.

A common example is the bond between positively-charged sodium atoms and negatively-charged chlorine atoms to form table salt (NaCl).

Atoms sharing electrons tend to be stable, so they prefer to stay together rather than apart.\n\n17 Belarus capital : MINSK\n\nMinsk is the capital of Belarus, formerly known as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.

I used to play a lot of Skat when I was in my teens …\n\n42 News article intro : LEDE\n\nThe opening paragraph in any work of literature is often just called “the lead”. In the world of journalism, this is usually referred to as “the lede”.

The series was so popular that it spawned Lego Batman TV shows, video games and movies.\n\n“Gotham” had been a nickname for New York City long before it was picked up by comic books as a setting for Batman tales. The term was coined by Washington Irving in a periodical that he published in 1807. Irving was lampooning New York politics and culture, and lifted the name from the village of Gotham in Nottinghamshire, England. The original Gotham was, according to folklore, inhabited by fools.\n\n78 Part of LPGA : LADIES\n\nThe Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) was founded in 1950 by a group of 13 lady golfers, and today it is the oldest ongoing women’s sports professional organization in the US.\n\n81 007’s first film foe : DR NO\n\n“Dr. No” may have been the first film in the wildly successful James Bond franchise, but it was the sixth novel in the series of books penned by Ian Fleming. Fleming was inspired to write the story after reading the Fu Manchu tales by Sax Rohmer. If you’ve read the Rohmer books or seen the films, you’ll recognize the similarities between the characters Dr. Julius No and Fu Manchu. By the way, the author Ian Fleming tells us that Julius No attended medical school in Milwaukee.\n\n84 Flagon beer : ALE\n\nA flagon is a large jug with a lid that is traditionally used for holding beer or wine.\n\n85 Video game brother : LUIGI\n\nMario Bros. started out as an arcade game back in 1983, developed by Nintendo.

As WWII approached, the Coca-Cola plant in Germany had trouble obtaining the ingredients it needed to continue production of the cola beverage, so the plant manager decided to create a new drink from what was available. The new beverage was built around whey (leftover from cheese production) and pomace (left over after juice has been extracted from fruit). The inventor asked his colleagues to use their “imagination” (“Fantasie” in German) and come up with a name for the drink, so they piped up “Fanta!”\n\n“Piña colada” is a Spanish term that translates into “strained pineapple”. The piña colada cocktail was introduced in the Caribe Hilton San Juan in 1954, and since 1978 it has been the official beverage of Puerto Rico. The mocktail version of the drink is known as a nada colada.\n\n106 Autumn blossom : ASTER\n\nApparently, most aster species and cultivars bloom relatively late in the year, usually in the fall.

Today, Sioux City is the navigational head of the Missouri, the furthest point upstream that is accessible by general cargo ships.\n\n111 Upholstery choice : SUEDE\n\nSuede is leather made from the underside of an animal’s skin, usually the skin from a lamb. As such it is very soft, although not as durable as leather made from the exterior skin. The soft leather was, and is still used for making gloves. Back in 1859 these gloves were called “gants de Suede” in France, or “gloves of Sweden”. So, the name “suede” comes from the French word for Sweden.\n\n112 Santa Fe foursome : TIRES\n\nHyundai introduced the Santa Fe crossover SUV in 2000. Hyundai’s marketing folks position the Santa Fe above the Tucson compact crossover, and below the Veracruz mid-size crossover. That’s quite a tour of the American Southwest.\n\n116 Singer born in County Donegal : ENYA\n\nEnya’s real name is Eithne Ní Bhraonáin, which can translate from Irish into Enya Brennan. Her Donegal family (in the northwest of Ireland) formed a band called Clannad, which included Enya.
