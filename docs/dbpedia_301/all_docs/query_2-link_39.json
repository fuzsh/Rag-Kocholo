Netflix's always losing licensed movies, giving us reasons to update this list to make sure it reflects the current options.

Shaun decides to help, but soon finds out that this unearthly visitor is being pursued by a mysterious organization.

This time, the chickens won't be breaking out of the farm they live on, but breaking in – are their infiltration skills as good as their escape prowess all these years later? You bet – and the silly, family-friendly jokes make for a clucking good time, too.\n\n81% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 7 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Over the Moon'\n\nFei Fei (Cathy Ang) is a young girl on a quest to validate the legendary tale of Chang’e (Phillipa Soo), the moon goddess who chose immortality over love with Houyi (Conrad Ricamora). To do that, Fei Fei builds a rocket to the moon, determined to prove the existence of the deity that she sees come to life in vibrant color, dancing across the print of a decorative scarf.

Woodcarver Geppetto (David Bradley), still grieving the loss of his son Carlo (Gregory Mann), crafts a puppet from a pine tree planted at his son's grave. The puppet, named Pinocchio (Mann), comes to life as a mischievous little boy, leading to chaos in his small village. Guiding Pinocchio is Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor). Pinocchio struggles with his identity while wishing for immortality, and gets caught up in several mishaps, including being exploited in a circus lead by Count Volpe (Christoph Waltz) and coming face to face with a terrifying sea creature. It’s a sight darker than the Disney version, but well worth the journey.\n\n96% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 11 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Rescued by Ruby'\n\nDaniel O'Neil (Grant Gustin) is a Rhode Island state trooper who wants to join the K-9 search and rescue team.

Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a shape-shifter whose people have been targeted by the knights of the kingdom. But, then, knight Ballister Boldheart (Riz Ahmed) is framed for the murder of the queen of this futuristic world — and needs Nimona's help to clear his name.\n\nCritics praise Nimona for its positive messages, but also note that it may be a little too violent for some. Others, demand a sequel.\n\n97% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 11 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Enola Holmes 2'\n\nSequels, often, benefit from having their predecessor done the heavy-lifting needed to establish a world that characters (and audiences) can have fun in. So, now that young Enola (Millie Bobby Brown) Holmes is ready to break out of the shadow of her famous brother (Henry Cavill) and start her own agency, she's also old enough to learn that the world won't take a young girl seriously as a detective.\n\nFortunately, she meets Bessie (Serrana Su-Ling Bliss), a factory girl in desperate need of help finding her missing sister. So, while audiences are entertained, they'll actually also get an education about the 1888 matchgirls' strike.\n\n94% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 12 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical'\n\nNot every child is raised by parents who care about their education, and not every family can make it to a Royal Shakespeare Company performance. And so we talk about Netflix's new adaptation of Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical. Applauded for solid performances all-around — Emma Thomson and Lashana Lynch were expectedly fantastic, while newcomer Alisha Weir also dazzles — this film is proof that Netflix can make some of the best family movies, period. And credit to director Matthew Warchus and screenwriter Dennis Kelly for sprinkling in the appropriately small amount of risk and danger on top.\n\n92% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Sea Beast'\n\nNetflix is slowly hitting its stride again when it comes to family-friendly animated movies, and The Sea Beast is the latest piece of proof in that favor. This aquatic adventure finds the orphaned Maisie (voiced by Zaris-Angel Hator) stow away on a pirate ship run by monster hunters, led by Captain Crow (Jared Harris). But there's a beast known as The Red Bluster that's terrorizing the seas and causing trouble for the crew. Soon, Maisie and the captain's adopted son Jacob Holland (Karl Urban) are separated from the rest of the crew, and need to survive on their own.\n\n94% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood'\n\nNetflix's original animated kids movies typically go CGI and neon, so color us surprised and delighted to find that Richard Linklater is at the helm for Netflix's latest great movie for families. This time, Linklater is using his love of rotoscope animation to recreate what it was like to be a child during the space race. The film is told through two perspective, a child named Stan who dreams of being in space, and the astronauts and mission control team working during the first moon landing.\n\n92% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 10 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Hilda and the Mountain King'\n\nIf your family hasn't watched Netflix's excellent animated series Hilda yet, now's the right time — as its sequel movie just came out. This wonderful show has a brilliant wholesome energy to it, with charm and emotional resonance. This feature-length episode looks at one of the show's biggest questions, \"what's up with the human/troll conflict?\" and does so with a traditional manner: a fish out of water story. The plot is simple, the titular Hilda wakes up with the body of a troll, and is now tasked with two missions: regain her human form and save the city of Trolberg.\n\n97% Rotten Tomatoes (audience score)\n\nCommon Sense Media says: Not reviewed yet\n\nWatch now\n\n'Klaus'\n\nDon't think we need a Santa origin story? Sorry, while the movie industry has made many of us grinches when it comes to films that explain where long-loved characters come from, Klaus breaks the mold. This gorgeous animated film tells a tale set in the fictional town of Smeerensburg, Jesper (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) is a spoiled postman who somehow makes friends with — you guessed it — Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons), the local toymaker. Older audiences will appreciate veteran actors including Joan Cusack and the late Norm Macdonald.\n\n94% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 6 and up (plus, a Common Sense Selection pick for Families)\n\nWatch now\n\n'Vivo'\n\nHamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote eight original songs for the movie, which fuses his Broadway rapping style with the sounds of Cuba. Vivo follows the titular kinkajou (Miranda), a talented musician who busks in the streets of Havana with owner Andrés (Juan de Marcos). After a tragedy, Vivo journeys to Florida to deliver a love song to the famous singer Marta Sandoval (Gloria Estefan). Along the way, he makes some unlikely friends and connects in his grief with Andrés’ grandniece Gabi (Ynairaly Simo).\n\n86% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 6 and up (plus, a Common Sense Selection pick for Families)\n\nWatch now\n\n'Escape The Undertaker'\n\nOK, this one may be best for kids who are a little older (CSM ranks it for ages 9 and up), but this digital choose-your-own adventure movie offers something your kids may not have seen in a while. You make the decisions for WWE Superstars The New Day, who have decided to stop by The Undertaker's creepy mansion. The chemistry between the trio (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) is hilarious, and it's perfect for younger and older children alike. Having trouble with inputting your selection? Netflix customer service might be able to help.\n\nNo Rotten Tomatoes score\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 9 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Mitchells vs. The Machines'\n\nThe latest addition to this list of the best family movies on Netflix, The Mitchells vs. The Machines is an animated film that has something for everyone. Its visuals astound (as we expected from the team behind Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse), and its cast is filled to the brim with top players including Abbi Jacobson, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Eric Andre and Olivia Colman.\n\nAnd the story is simple until it's chaos: the Mitchell family is out for a road trip right before daughter Katie starts film school. But, then, the robot uprising begins. You know, all our smart tech has finally had enough of us, and is going to take over. It's the inevitable moment we all saw coming, and the exact last thing a family would want when they're on the road and reliant on technology. Too fantastic?

Looking to give your kids a completely different kind of movie night? Audiences 8 and up (according to Common Sense Media) will enjoy this documentary about a filmmaker who needs to get away from it all — and retreats to the shores of South Africa.\n\nDiving in the local kelp forest, he meets an octopus who becomes his new friend. The two spend nearly a year together, and their connection is genuine and powerful.\n\n95% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up (plus, a Common Sense Selection pick for Families)\n\nWatch now\n\n'Wish Dragon'\n\nKids will flock to Sony Pictures Animation's Wish Dragon for the colorful designs and zany antics, but their parents will keep paying attention because of a stellar cast of voice actors. The likes of John Cho, Constance Wu, Bobby Lee and Jimmy O. Yang lend their voices to project that will surely speak to younger audiences.\n\nDin (voiced by Jimmy Wong) is a college student with large dreams and a small budget, who is helped by Long (Cho) a wish-granting dragon. Think Aladdin, but slightly more relevant. Oh, and one more item for its credibility: Jackie Chan produced Wish Dragon.\n\n68% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up (plus, a Common Sense Selection pick for Families)\n\nWatch now\n\n'Enola Holmes'\n\nFamilies looking for a fun and lively action-filled mystery should stream Enola Holmes. The film stars Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown, who brings modern sensibilities to days of yore. And, yes, Enola is from that Holmes family. But her brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Clafin) are among those who don't know quite what to make of how their little sister is remarkably free-spirited for her time. Brown thrives in the role, mixing the fourth-wall breaking fun that seems to only make it to older female characters such as Fleabag. But parents don't need to worry about the show being too adult, aside from some fight scenes employing knives and guns. For movies from a different historical era, check out our guide to the best Presidents' Day movies. Also, Enola Holmes 2 is almost here!\n\n91% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 10 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey'\n\nSeemingly a near-instant classic, Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is the unexpected holiday season hit is one of the best family movies on Netflix — especially during the holiday season. A gigantic musical film, filled with joy and excitement — plus a top-tier cast — this John Legend-produced film has won applause all over, from critics to fans. We'll keep plot details minimal, but the film centers around a toymaker who's lost his smile, but may get his exuberance back when he's reunited with his intelligent granddaughter. Want more holiday cheer? Here's how to watch Elf online.\n\n92% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch'\n\nAre your kids not exactly traditional? Parents of kids with particularly unique and slightly mature tastes in TV and movies should consider John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch for the next movie night. In this film, the titular comedian (who is also great on HBO Max's The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo) runs through all of the standard kids content tropes with a sly wit and a lot of kindness. Younger kids may not \"get\" it, but parents who are fans of Mulaney's will likely wonder why all kids-friendly content can't be this intelligent. It's also got musical numbers, to keep the especially young crowd from getting bored.\n\n96% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Pokemon Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution'\n\nA CGI remake of the original Pokemon film, Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution is both familiar but new. It focuses on what happens when the iconic Pokemon trainer Ash (and his fellow trainers) discover the massively powerful Mewtwo, a psychic Pokemon who is a massive threat. While it's not high art, it's still a decent choice for family movie night if and when your kid just got into the Pokemon world. Especially since the original is not on Netflix. Mewtwo will also teach kids about when you shouldn't judge others.\n\n44% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up.\n\nWatch now\n\n'Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus'\n\nNetflix rebooted the Nicktoon classic Invader Zim with this 71-minute film that's easily one of the best family movies on Netflix — especially for younger parents. Just like the classic show, Florpus offers a wild manic energy with some jokes that kids won't get and parents will chuckle at. Reviews point to the film's amazing eye candy and endearing energy levels, and small nods to other classic animated shows. If your kids love this film, maybe it's time to dig up the original series or get them started on Adventure Time.\n\n100% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 8 and up.\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind'\n\nThis inspiring film — set in a small farming village in Malawi — will pull audiences in with the presence of lead actor (and director) Chiwetel Ejiofor. The award-winning actor doesn't take up too much of the film, though, giving proper time to lead Maxwell Simba, who plays a 13-year-old boy named William. While William's story may read like a middle-school assignment, his education is taken away before he conceives a windmill-power generator to solve his town's problems, it's the kind of motivational story that science-obsessed kids might love.\n\n85% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 12 and up.\n\nWatch now\n\n'Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling'\n\nFor slightly older kids and parents on the younger end, Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling is both proudly progressive and delightfully nostalgic. Not only does the series match the original Nicktoon's vibe, but its approach to identity and transgender roles should be inspiring to other family programming looking to take the leap. And at only 45 minutes, this special won't take a huge bite out of your night.\n\n91% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 10 and up.\n\nWatch now\n\n'White Fang'\n\nInspired by Jack London's novel, White Fang will capture the imaginations of those who love pets and nature.

Voice acting work comes from beloved names such as Parks and Recreation stars Rashida Jones and Nick Offerman, as well as Paul Giamatti.\n\n88% Rotten Tomatoes\n\nCommon Sense Media says: ages 10 and up.\n\nWatch now\n\n'Next Gen'\n\nParents looking for a futuristic animated film for their middle-school-aged (and up) kids that successfully manages to be appropriate and entertaining should check out Netflix's Next Gen. Featuring voice acting from John Krasinski (The Office) and Charlene Yi (Paper Heart), who play an AI and a young girl, respectively, who unite to stop a baddie.

When they get wind of a \"yes day\" where parents can't decline any request, the Torres family jumps in to try and rebuild the growing rift between them and their kids. But as they keep giving in to more outlandish requests, the Torres clan discovers that you need those \"no\" answers to temper the yesses, but that doesn't mean you can't still enjoy time as a family.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nCommon Sense Media says: Ages 8 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'Paddington'\n\nIn the heart of London, an unexpected visitor from the Peruvian rainforest finds himself far from home. Dubbed \"Paddington\" (Ben Whishaw) after the train station where he's discovered, this young bear quickly charms the kind-hearted Brown family: Henry (Hugh Bonneville) and Mary (Sally Hawkins). But as Paddington tries to adapt to city life and its challenges, he catches the eye of Millicent Clyde (Nicole Kidman), a taxidermist who wants him on her wall. The Browns must work together to protect their furry family member from a terrible fate, all the while learning a thing or two about each other along the way.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nCommon Sense Media says: Ages 6 and up\n\nWatch now\n\n'We Can Be Heroes'\n\nThis standalone flick, set in the same universe as The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D, is all camp, but perfect for the whole family. When the world's mightiest heroes are captured in an epic battle, it's up to their kids to rise to the occasion. Led by Missy Moreno (YaYa Gosselin), who's joined by an ensemble of super-powered kids, this plucky team finds themselves on a mission to stop an alien \"takeover.\" As they venture into the heart of the alien mothership, under the guidance of trainer Grandma Anita (Adriana Barraza), this next generation of heroes proves that sometimes, you need a set of younger hands to save the day."
