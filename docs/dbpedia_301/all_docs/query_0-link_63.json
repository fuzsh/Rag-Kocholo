        "text": "With the era of peak TV showing no signs of slowing down in 2023, ET has put together a comprehensive list of all the upcoming premiere dates for major series -- both new and returning -- across broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming platforms.\n\nBroken down by month, the extensive look at what is on the horizon offers viewers the chance to stay on top of when Only Murders in the Building returns with a star-studded season 3 on Hulu, the exact date for the premiere of seventh and final season of Billions on Showtime or when the acclaimed series adaptation of Heartstopper drops all new episodes on Netflix.\n\nAnd now, with both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA on strike and picketing expected to continue throughout the rest of the summer, there have been a number of shifts to TV lineups with upcoming release dates pushed back for some series while others are still waiting to be announced. With that said, this is the place to keep track of all the major changes to the schedule amid the ongoing strikes.\n\nAs always, the guide will be continuously updated throughout the year as more premiere dates are announced, so keep this handy -- and start marking your calendars for what to watch throughout the rest of 2023. (And, of course, ET has also got you covered when it comes to what shows -- across broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services -- have been canceled or are preparing to say goodbye with their final seasons.)\n\nAugust\n\nAugust 1\n\nGranite Harbour — Season 1 (BritBox)\n\nUntold — Volume 3 (Netflix)\n\nAugust 2\n\nBig Brother — Season 25 (CBS)\n\nPhysical — Season 3 (Apple TV+)\n\nFX's Reservation Dogs — Season 3 (Hulu)\n\nAugust 3\n\nDemons and Saviors — Limited (Hulu)\n\nHeartstopper — Season 2 (Netflix)\n\nHappily Married — Season 2 (Topic)\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation — Season 6 (MTV)\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer — Season 2, Part 2 (Netflix)\n\nAugust 4\n\nThe Big Nailed It Baking Challenge — Season 1 (Netflix)\n\nThe Lost Flowers of Alice Hart — Limited (Prime Video)\n\nSecret Celebrity Renovation — Season 3 (CBS)\n\nWomen on Death Row — Season 1 (A&E)\n\nAugust 5\n\nGreat Chocolate Showdown — Season 4 (The CW)\n\nRecipe for Disaster — Season 1 (The CW)\n\nThe Wild Sides — Limited (AMC+/BBC America)\n\nAugust 6\n\nBig Sky Kitchen — Season 2 (Magnolia Network)\n\nDesign Down Under — Season 1 (Magnolia Network)\n\nWinning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty — Season 2 (HBO)\n\nThe Chi — Season 6 (Showtime)\n\nAugust 7\n\n#TextMeWhenYouGetHome — Season 2 (Lifetime)\n\nMeet Marry Murder — Season 4 (Lifetime)\n\nUgliest House in America — Season 4 (HGTV)\n\nAugust 8\n\nHard Knocks — Season 20 (HBO)\n\nOnly Murders in the Building — Season 3 (Hulu)\n\nAugust 9\n\nLadies First: A Story of Women in Hip-Hop — Limited (Netflix)\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series — Season 4 (Disney+)\n\nMoving — Season 1 (Hulu)\n\nStrange Planet — Season 1 (Apple TV+)\n\nSuperfan — Season 1 (CBS)\n\nAugust 10\n\nBroken Ties — Season 1 (Sundance Now)\n\nThe Challenge: USA — Season 2 (CBS)\n\nRap Sh!t — Season 2 (Max)\n\nAugust 11\n\nMen in Kilts: A Roadtrip with Sam and Graham — Season 2 (Starz)\n\nMy Lottery Dream Home — Season 14 (HGTV)\n\nAugust 12\n\nHip Hop Treasures — Season 1 (A&E)\n\nAugust 13\n\nTelemarketers — Limited (HBO)\n\nBillions — Season 7 (Showtime)\n\nAugust 14\n\n90 Day: The Last Resort — Season 1 (TLC)\n\nSolar Opposites — Season 4 (Hulu)\n\nAugust 15\n\nGood Bones — Season 8 (HGTV)\n\nWhat's Wrong With That House?
