This follows Second Stage Theater's upcoming residency in my former home, Signature Theatre Company, after Second Stage left their own Off-Broadway home. Other examples abound, and, even if these decisions to share space or produce theatre with different relations to real estate are driven by financial need, kudos to those companies that are adopting new approaches. Seeing shows at Soho Rep's 65 seat space on Walker Street was *always* thrilling but, as Cynthia Flowers, Caleb Hammons, and Eric Ting, point out in an email to their community, \"Soho Rep is not a building\". In a piece by Brittani Samuel, Playwright's Artistic Director Adam Greenfield stated \"Through partnership, through a real genuine collaboration where you‚Äôre opening yourself up to other ways of working and perspectives, and in doing so making yourself vulnerable, we are creating more possibilities for ourselves.‚Äù Somewhere along the way we have lost these principles. I can recite legitimate reasons why theatre companies choose to have their own space, but these decisions are often driven by equating growth with success, donor enthusiasm for contributing to building campaigns with naming opportunities, and organization ego. I've given these issues a great deal a thought based on my own experience of leading theatres that are real estate heavy, and put forward the following guidelines for theatre companies, and funders, particularly institutional ones, to consider: *Let's move towards newly build theatres housing multiple companies; *Funders--and theatre leadership--require that model as a condition of funding; *Rigorous testing of operating costs that are sustainable is necessary; *Let's build theatres that are welcoming and accessible. Greenfield asks, \"How can I continue to produce really risk-taking work and encourage an audience‚Äôs generosity of heart towards that work‚Äù he chuckles, ‚Äúin a building made of granite and terrazzo floors and glass?‚Äù; *Do we need to hire \"starchitects\"? How does that serve us? My high school built a new theatre. The students wanted to be involved in the the design, and were dismissed. They went ahead and put forward their rudimentary but thoughtful design. Guess what? The architects implemented their plan. Finally, any building campaign *must* include funding for artistic initiatives and, especially, artist compensation. Again, this component should be a condition of funding. The entire theatre ecosystem *must* lift up this standard. In short, in this moment, our approach to real estate is yet another significant area that requires new thinking and action. https://lnkd.in/ejdr_qEr https://lnkd.in/esQeKfS7\n\nThe next TRU Producer Bootcamp RAISING MONEY FOR THEATER 2024: Who, How and When to Ask Saturday, February 17, 12pm to 7:00pm Retooled for virtual participation. Theater was on hold since March 2020, but hope finally is on the horizon: though uncertainties persist, at least we have an effective vaccine and have seen a tentative return of live theater. It's more important now than ever for the voices of theater to be heard so start moving ahead with passion, a plan, and an awareness of how to navigate our current world-in-transition. For producers, one important step will always be finding the money and resources to make it all happen. We invite you to acquire some basic tools and crucial information that will help you to overcome your money shyness, navigate the roadblocks, and effectively reach out to supporters. From pitching techniques and presentation skills to legal requirements and business planning, plus a wealth of first-hand experience from a half dozen producers who are currently active in the Broadway and off-Broadway worlds, we promise you an informative, empowering and inspiring day. Go to the link to learn about the event and the faculty of theater professionals, including Broadway, London, and Off-Broadway producers: https://lnkd.in/erz7A8Hx\n\nOban, Scotland: ‚ÄúFor a lot of people, the experience of going to the cinema is no longer what they want. It‚Äôs easier to have a film night at home and it‚Äôs cheaper but it‚Äôs just not the same as making a treat or night out of it. It‚Äôs more than just watching a film. As a charitable business, we know the pinch of prices going up. We are also having to fork out those extra costs, even paying more for the popcorn we sell. We could be at a critical point if we don‚Äôt take these measures now and cut our opening hours. There will be reviews to see if we can open more days again but to do that we need people to come and support us and fill the empty seats - without them it won‚Äôt happen‚Äù #cinema #leisurepropertyESS Screen Scotland\n\nAnyone connected to the world of Non-Profits has been experiencing the challenges of funding and diminishing audiences & clients since pre-pandemic days. The pandemic focused a huge spotlight on this issue and the evidence is visible everywhere you look. I've seen local theaters shut down, or reinvent themselves in the past, but what's happening now is unprecedented. One of the moments in this article that stands out to me is that athletic events and concerts seem to have fewer issues coming back from the pandemic. I have said to colleagues before that many times the impetus to purchase a ticket to a show isn't about how much the ticket costs, many times it's about the priority of the ticket buyer. If anyone wants to do something, no matter the cost, they will find a way to make it work in most scenarios. Because if a teenager can afford a ticket to Taylor Swift they can certainly afford a $30-$40-$50 ticket to the theater (or more depending on your city). But is that the priority for how they want to spend their money? Same goes for anyone at any age. So how do we make theater a priority again for our existing audiences as well as the new audiences we desperately need? Do we need to be putting more content online? Do we need to focus less on \"bread & butter\" shows like My Fair Lady, Romeo & Juliet, etc. so we can present more new works that speak to our current lived experiences? What are the priorities for our audiences these days? These seem like simple questions, and in many ways they are. But how and when we ask is critically important because in many cases, if they haven't been asked yet, it may unfortunately be too late."
