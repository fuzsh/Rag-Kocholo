Martin and Robert Redford comes a thrilling new Western noir that follows Joe Leaphorn and his Navajo Tribal Police deputies as they investigate a series of seemingly unrelated crimes,\" the synopsis reads on AMC.\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"Zahn McClarnon is riveting as a coiled cop in 'Dark Winds,' a solid procedural that derives much of its texture from an underrepresented cultural milieu.\"\n\n\"With well-written and sharply defined characters, plus an invigorating and tightly wound story, it'll be hard to wait a week for each episode to drop,\" IndieWire critic Kristen Lopez wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Heartstopper\" (season one) — Netflix\n\nSynopsis: \"When gentle Charlie and rugby-loving Nick meet at secondary school, they quickly discover that their unlikely friendship is blossoming into an unexpected romance,\" the synopsis reads on Netflix.\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"An inclusive romance told with striking sensitivity, 'Heartstopper' is so effortlessly charming that viewers won't dare skip a beat.\"\n\n\"There are some TV series so sweet, so joyous and so wonderful that the mere mention of them can make you smile — Netflix's 'Heartstopper' is one of those shows,\" USA Today critic Kelly Lawler wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"High School\" (season one) — Amazon Freevee\n\nSynopsis: \"'High School' is a story about finding your own identity—a journey made even more complicated when you have a twin whose own struggle and self-discovery so closely mimics your own,\" the synopsis reads on Amazon. \"Told through a backdrop of '90s grunge and rave culture, the series weaves between parallel and discordant memories of sisters growing up down the hall from one another.\"\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"High School is as effervescent and sensitive as a Tegan and Sara album, delivering a highly specific coming of age comedy that rings with universal truth.\"\n\n\"An impossibly sweet and tender coming-of-age series that brings all of its characters' truths to screen with maximum heart and authenticity,\" critic Perri Nemiroff said in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Kids in the Hall\" (season one) — Amazon Prime\n\nSynopsis: \"The iconic Canadian sketch comedy troupe 'The Kids in the Hall' return from the dead with a reboot of their ground-breaking sketch series,\" the synopsis reads on Amazon Prime.\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"'The Kids in the Hall' have become seasoned comedy veterans without missing a beat, delivering a fresh set of sketches that will delight longtime fans.\"\n\n\"Well-written, expertly performed, unashamedly odd and full of beans...\" the Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Legend of Vox Machina\" (season one) — Amazon Prime\n\nSynopsis: \"After saving the realm from evil and destruction at the hands of the most terrifying power couple in Exandria, Vox Machina is faced with saving the world once again — this time, from a sinister group of dragons known as the Chroma Conclave,\" the synopsis reads on Amazon.\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"Fluidly animated and intelligently scripted, 'The Legend of Vox Machina' is an addictive treat for fans of 'Dungeons & Dragons-style' RPGs.\"\n\n\"Any show can be 'epic,' but it takes a truly special show to be utterly chaotic and ridiculous too,\" Slashfilm critic Rafael Motamayor wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls\" (season one) — Amazon Prime\n\nSynopsis: \"Global superstar Lizzo is on the hunt for confident, bad-ass women to join her world.

\"Lizzo acquits herself splendidly as master of ceremonies in 'Watch Out for the Big Grrrls,' a joyous reality competition that's equal parts fun and uplifting.\"\n\n\"What's truly stunning to watch is how much the series reassures the girls (and big girls everywhere) that they are enough, with teachers who actually listen and lessons that work to make everyone feel better about themselves,\" The Mary Sue critic Briana Lawrence wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mo\" (season one) — Netflix\n\nSynopsis: \"Living in Texas, Mo loses his job at a mobile store and looks for a new gig as his Palestinian family waits on their pending asylum request,\" the synopsis reads on Netflix.\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"Frequently hilarious while possessing an absorbing sense of place, 'Mo' is a

wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Peaky Blinders\" (season six) — BBC/Netflix\n\nSynopsis: \"A notorious gang in 1919 Birmingham, England, is led by the fierce Tommy Shelby, a crime boss set on

when majestic dinosaurs and extraordinary creatures roamed the lands, seas, and skies.\"\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"Marrying state of the art visual effects with equally immersive narration by David Attenborough, 'Prehistoric Planet' wondrously brings viewers back to the age of dinosaurs.\"\n\n\"A truly breathtaking display of CGI that feels authentic and looks like Apple TV+ sent a bold crew millions and millions of years into the past,\" Inverse critic Mónica Marie Zorrilla wrote in a review. \"'Prehistoric Planet' is a modern magic show.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Rap Sh!t\" (season one) —

or destroy each other?\"\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"'The Responder' is unrelentingly dark and inescapably absorbing, with Martin Freeman's hangdog performance carrying the drama.\"\n\n\"Authentic, propulsive, funny and powerful, this already feels like a contender for the best police drama of the year,\" The London Evening Standard critic Katie Rosseinsky wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Sherwood\" (season one) — BBC\n\nSynopsis: \"Inspired in part by real events, set in a Nottinghamshire mining village at the heart of Sherwood lie two shocking and unexpected killings that shatter an already fractured community and spark a massive manhunt,\" the synopsis reads on BBC.\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"A gripping mystery that draws immense power from its sterling cast and the specificity of its location, 'Sherwood' is such a rich series that it makes the competition look all the poorer.\"\n\n\"Artfully combining a drama about the long tail of hurt from the colliery closures with a macabre whodunit (and increasingly, as the series progresses, blending the two) is no mean feat,\" Independent critic Nick Hilton wrote in a review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What We Do in the Shadows\" (season four) — FX\n\nSynopsis: \"'What We Do in the Shadows' documents the nightly exploits of vampire roommates Nandor, Laszlo, Nadja and Colin Robinson as they navigate the modern world of Staten Island with the help of their human familiar, Guillermo,\" the synopsis reads on FX.\n\nCritics' Consensus: \"Aside from turning this demonic household into Three Vampires and a Baby, 'What We Do in the Shadows' doubles down on what it does best without drastically changing the formula — and remains fang-tastic all the same.\"\n\n\"The fourth season of the FX vampire-comedy throws even more bizarre hijinks into the mix, including a vampire nightclub and one character's transformation into creepy little boy,\" The Daily Beast critic Nick Schager wrote in a review.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, is a Netflix board member.\n\nWhen you buy through our links, Insider may earn
