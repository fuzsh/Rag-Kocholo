6. Threats & opportunities NL dairy Threats ▪ Legislation on reduction emissions: N, P, NH3, CO2 and CH4 ▪ High costs to dispose manure ▪ Sustainability requirements: animal welfare, grazing, emissions, biodiversity ▪ High land prizes Opportunities ▪ Entrepreneurial spirit of dairy farmers ▪ Sustainable milk as unique selling point ▪ Strong processors and high quality export ▪ Continuous improvement technical and economic efficiency 6

8. Goals Sustainable Dutch Dairy Chain 2030 Climate and energy ▪ Monitor carbon footprint ▪ Energy neutral production ▪ Reduction in CH4 and N2O Animal health and welfare: ▪ Monitoring animal health with tools ▪ Increase longevity Grazing ▪ 80% of farms practice grazing Biodiversity ▪ Implement biodiversity monitoring ▪ 65% home grown protein ▪ 100% use of certified soy (No deforestation) ▪ 100% farms monitor nutrient cycle and emissions 8

12. Main categories mitigation options ▪ Feeding ▪ Feed and fodder production on farm ▪ Herd: health, welfare and young stock care ▪ Manure management: storage and application ▪ Fossil energy saving / renewable energy production ▪ Breeding ▪ Carbon sequestration in soil 12

13. Mitigation options and estimated impact (NL conditions, and only options + or 0 on profit) 13Source: Zijlstra et al., 2018 Expert assessment results Best practice / mitigation option Impact op GHG Impact on profit Less young stock per 10 cows *** ++ Higher milk production per cow *** + Increased feed efficiency (less losses, more frequent feeding) *** + Decrease artificial N-fertilizer *** 0 Increase of legumes in sword *** 0 Renewable energy production (solar, biogas, wind) *** +/- Increase maize share in ration ** +/- Decrease concentrates share in ration ** + Grow own concentrates/fodder crops ** +/- Use of renewable energy ** 0 Reduce ensilaging losses ** + Reduce renewal rate of grassland * +/- Energy saving technologies * + More grazing and grass intake * + Higher crop production per ha * +

14. Most popular GHG mitigation options chosen by pilot group of 12 dairy farmers 14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Numberoffarmers Mitigation option Source: Unpublished results of a group of 12 Dutch farmers piloting the application of mitigation options

15. Experiences on implementation on farm level ▪ Pilot groups are exploring: not yet large scale results of experiences ▪ Focus on cost effective mitigation options ▪ Large dairy processor initiates certification system to reward farmers low in GHG ▪ Next to GHG, farmers face challenges of other sustainability issues: ammonia emissions, biodiversity and animal welfare ▪ Big future impact expected from GHG-reducing feed additives ▪ The profitability of bio-digester strongly depends on subsidy level. Not attractive in NL. 15
