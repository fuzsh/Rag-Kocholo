CCAFS project Low Emissions Development of the Chinese Dairy Sector Project meeting CAAS, CAU & WUR Beijing, January 15th 2019 Marion de Vries, Ph.D. and Jelle Zijlstra (Wageningen UR)\n\n2. Background • Current CCAFS livestock projects China: • Development of emission accounting methods (MRV) • Carbon footprint assessment and mitigation options of dairy under Chinese conditions (funded CCAFS/SDDDC) • New funding CCAFS (2019-2021): • Piloting and upscaling of promising mitigation strategies in Chinese dairy sector.\n\n3. Background CCAFS project ‘Low Emissions Development of the Chinese Dairy Sector’: • Phase 1 (2018-2019): Carbon footprint assessment and mitigation options. Ongoing • Phase 2 (2019-2021): Piloting and upscaling of promising mitigation strategies. Inception phase. Partners:\n\n4. ‘Upscaling promising livestock options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in Asia’ 1. Upscaling of mitigation options in small-scale dairy farms in Indonesia (2016-2019) 2. Closing Regional Nutrient Cycles Indonesia (2018-2021) 3. Low Emissions Development of the Chinese Dairy Sector (2019-2021) 4. Fungi treatment for lignin degradation of low-quality biomass (Indonesia, Vietnam, China; 2019-2021) Part of larger CCAFS program\n\n5. Aim of this meeting 5 1. Common understanding of the general outline of the research project (phase 1 + phase 2) 2. Discuss a possible work plan for Phase 2. • Activities • Partners • Etc. (aim is to have a 1st draft in the next weeks)\n\n6. CCAFS project ‘Low Emissions Development of the Chinese Dairy Sector’ 6 Overall objectives: 1. To identify effective and locally feasible GHG mitigation options for Low Emissions Development (LED) of the Chinese Dairy Sector 2. To enhance implementation and scaling of GHG mitigation options.\n\n7. How? (Approach) 7 Phase 1 (ToR): 1. Develop a model and tool to evaluate carbon footprint 2. Provide practice inventory of mitigation options Phase 2: 3. Evaluate the feasibility of mitigation options for implementation in dairy production systems in China 4. Engage stakeholders and next users to enhance implementation and scaling of mitigation options (policy makers, private sector parties)\n\n8. Expected deliverables Phase 1 (dates in ToR) 8 • Carbon footprint model (LCA) (Sept 2019) • Database LCA input data 100 dairy farms (Dec 2019) • Analyze CF 100 dairy farms (March 2019) • Mitigation options & cost-effectiveness (Dec 2019) • Policy brief / working paper\n\n9. Proposed activities for Phase 2 9 2019 • Quantify emissions, identify mitigation options (phase 1: CCAFS/SDDDC project) • Discuss and select promising high-impact mitigation options: • Expert meeting (scientists) • Stakeholder meeting • Selection field research sites • Identification collaboration partners & potential next users\n\n10. Proposed activities for Phase 2 10 2020-2021 • Feasibility testing for scaling • Field research (farm types? regions?) • M&E (emissions, farm productivity, costs/rev., benefits youth/women) • Feasibility studies (potential for inclusion in business models, government policies and regulations) • Engage stakeholders/end-users to enhance implementation and scaling (policy makers, private sector parties) • Training courses, farmer field days, demonstrations • Workshops/seminars national/provincial level • High level meetings • CCAFS SEA regional workshop: ‘upscaling of mitigation options in Asian dairy production systems’\n\n11. Time line CCAFS LED Dairy China Identification mitigation options Feasibility testing (pilots, research, business cases) Stakeholder engagement (end-users): Capacity building, communication, dissemination Scaling up 2018/2019 2020/2021\n\n12. Other research CCAFS: Lignin degradation 12 • Feasibility study on white rot fungi treatment for lignin degradation of low-quality biomass (straw, etc). • novel promising technique to improve the feeding value of abundant crop residues (WUR) • Potential improvement in degradability of biomass in rumen fluid of 50-150% (Tuyen et al., 2013) • Potential mitigation strategy Chinese dairy sector, additional co-benefits land use, human health, circularity, etc. • Separate research, still in preparation phase\n\n13. Discussion 13 Phase 2 CCAFS Dairy China: • Suggestions for other/additional activities? • How to involve stakeholders / potential next users? • Which parties could we involve as cooperation partner in the project? (private sector, government) • What are suitable field research sites? (What mitigation options do you expect from Phase 1?)"
