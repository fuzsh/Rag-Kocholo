        "text": "Understanding how biomolecules couple structural dynamics with function is at the heart of several disciplines and remains an outstanding goal in biology. Linking conformational states and their transitions to biochemical function requires the ability to precisely resolve the structure and dynamics of a biological system, which is often altered upon ligand binding or influenced by the chemical and physical properties of its environment. The most well-established structural biology tools have provided high-resolution ‘snapshots’ of states in a crystallized or frozen form (e.g., X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, cryoEM) or an ensemble average of all contributing conformations (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR; small-angle X-ray scattering, SAXS; small-angle neutron scattering, SANS; double electron-electron resonance, DEER; cross-linking mass spectrometry, XL-MS; ensemble-FRET). In recent years, further developments have enabled these conventional structural tools to detect conformational dynamics and reaction intermediates. For example, NMR techniques (Anthis and Clore, 2015; Clore and Iwahara, 2009; Palmer, 2004; Ravera et al., 2014; Sekhar and Kay, 2019) and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques (Jeschke, 2018; Jeschke, 2012; Krstić et al., 2011) have been advanced to study conformational dynamics and capture transient intermediates. Time-resolved crystallographic investigations have been employed to resolve functionally relevant structural displacements associated with a biological function (Kupitz et al., 2014; Moffat, 2001; Schlichting et al., 1990; Schlichting and Chu, 2000; Schotte et al., 2003). Advances in microfluidic mixing and spraying devices have enabled time-resolved cryoEM (Feng et al., 2017; Kaledhonkar et al., 2018) and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS or CL-MS) (Braitbard et al., 2019; Brodie et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Iacobucci et al., 2019; Murakami et al., 2013; Slavin and Kalisman, 2018). Progress in computational methods has also afforded novel tools for examining biomolecular structure and dynamics. Each of these advances highlights an increased awareness that one needs to directly and continuously track the dynamical properties of individual biomolecules in order to understand their function and regulation.\n\nIn this context, FRET (referred to as fluorescence resonance energy transfer or Förster resonance energy transfer [Braslavsky et al., 2008]) studies at the ensemble and single-molecule levels have emerged as important tools for measuring structural dynamics over at least 12 orders of magnitude in time and mapping the conformational and functional heterogeneities of biomolecules under ambient conditions. FRET studies probing fluorescence decays at the ensemble level (Grinvald et al., 1972; Haas et al., 1975; Haas and Steinberg, 1984; Hochstrasser et al., 1992) (time-resolved FRET) permitted already in the early 1970s the study of structural heterogeneities on timescales longer than the fluorescence lifetime (a few ns). This approach is still used nowadays (Becker, 2019; Orevi et al., 2014; Peulen et al., 2017) and has been transferred to single-molecule studies. The ability to measure FRET in single molecules (Deniz et al., 1999; Ha et al., 1996; Lerner et al., 2018a) has made the method even more appealing. The single-molecule FRET (smFRET) approach has been extensively used to study conformational dynamics and biomolecular interactions under steady-state conditions (Dupuis et al., 2014; Larsen et al., 2019; Lerner et al., 2018a; Lipman et al., 2003; Margittai et al., 2003; Mazal and Haran, 2019; Michalet et al., 2006; Orevi et al., 2014; Ray et al., 2019; Sasmal et al., 2016; Schuler et al., 2005; Schuler et al., 2002; Steiner et al., 2008; Zhuang et al., 2000). It is notable that, in many mechanistic studies, it suffices to use FRET for distinguishing different conformations and determining kinetic rates such that absolute FRET efficiencies and thereby distances do not need to be determined. However, the ability to measure accurate distances and kinetics with smFRET has led to its emergence as an important tool in this new era of ‘dynamic structural biology’ for mapping biomolecular heterogeneities and for measuring structural dynamics over a wide range of timescales (Lerner et al., 2018a; Mazal and Haran, 2019; Sanabria et al., 2020; Schuler and Hofmann, 2013; Weiss, 1999).\n\nSingle-molecule FRET (smFRET) approaches have many advantages as a structural biology method, including:\n\nsensitivity to macro-molecular distances (2.5–10 nm),\n\nthe ability to resolve structural and dynamic heterogeneities,\n\nhigh-quality measurements with low sample consumption of the molecules of interest (low concentrations and low volumes), as the sample is analyzed one molecule at a time,\n\ndetermination of structural transitions in equilibrium, hence without the need for synchronization,\n\nthe ability to detect (very) rare events. Indeed, in biology, the most interesting molecules to study are often the sparse, functionally active ones amidst a sea of inactive molecules,\n\nhigh sensitivity and specificity for labeled molecules. As only the labeled molecule uniquely contributes to the detected signal, these tracers can also be applied as FRET-reporters in crowded environments (Dupuis et al., 2014; Soranno et al., 2014; Zosel et al., 2020b) (hence smFRET can be used to validate results determined in isolation or detect the modulation of conformational preferences and/or structural dynamics through so-called quinary interactions [Guin and Gruebele, 2019]), and\n\nhigh specificity for residues/domains via specific labeling. Biomolecules can be specifically labeled by a unique dye pair enabling smFRET measurements to be applicable on all sizes of molecules, including large complex assemblies (see Figure 1 [Kilic et al., 2018]), active biological machines (e.g., the ribosomes) (Dunkle et al., 2011) and even on whole native virions (Lu et al., 2019; Munro et al., 2014).\n\nSeveral methods have been utilized to determine structural ensembles such as NMR, single-particle cryoEM or XL-MS, and, recently, also smFRET in an integrative/hybrid (I/H) approach with computational modeling to overcome the sparsity of experimental data with respect to an atomistic description (Berman et al., 2019; de Souza and Picotti, 2020; Dimura et al., 2020; Gauto et al., 2019; Koukos and Bonvin, 2020; Na and Paek, 2020; Tang and Gong, 2020; Webb et al., 2018). I/H structural models derived from smFRET experiments using inter-dye distances as restraints were reported for flexible folded proteins (Brunger et al., 2011; Hellenkamp et al., 2017; Margittai et al., 2003; McCann et al., 2012), conformational ensembles of disordered/unstructured and unfolded proteins (Borgia et al., 2018; Holmstrom et al., 2018; Schuler et al., 2020), nucleic acids and protein-nucleic acid complexes (Craggs et al., 2019; Craggs and Kapanidis, 2012; Kalinin et al., 2012; Lerner et al., 2018b; Muschielok et al., 2008; Wozniak et al., 2008).\n\nA further unique aspect of smFRET studies is that structural, kinetic, and spectroscopic information on large and complex systems can be recorded simultaneously in a single measurement. This facilitates linking dynamic and structural information in an integrative approach to (Figure 1A) (Hellenkamp et al., 2017; Kilic et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020b; Sanabria et al., 2020; Wasserman et al., 2016; Yanez Orozco et al., 2018):\n\ndefine the number of possible structures consistent with data,\n\npotentially reduce the ambiguity between different structural models compatible with the experimental data, and\n\nreveal the dynamic exchange pathways that are structurally allowed.\n\nAs an example, Figure 1B shows the outcome of a multimodal smFRET study on the conformational landscape of a 12-mer chromatin array (~2.5 MDa) (Kilic et al., 2018) with dynamics occurring on timescales from nanoseconds to hours. SmFRET experiments could detect the flexible chromatin conformations (Figure 1B, middle panel), revealing their dynamic structural heterogeneity (Figure 1B, bottom panel), in contrast to the well-ordered static structures of chromatin fibers (Figure 1B, top panel). These flexible, partially-open and open conformations that are quite abundant in solution (population of >70%; Figure 1B, bottom panel) were not resolved before, although they are essential for proper gene organization and function. They represent the central interconversion hub for the distinct stacking registers of chromatin and are difficult to detect with other structural techniques. This approach of visualizing biomolecules in action under ambient conditions emphasizes the importance of their dynamic nature by resolving transitions between various conformational states, which, in many cases, promotes function (Aviram et al., 2018; Henzler-Wildman et al., 2007; Iljina et al., 2020; Lerner et al., 2018b; Sanabria et al., 2020; Tassis et al., 2020).\n\nSmFRET measurements are typically performed using two approaches: with surface-immobilized molecules using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and camera-based detection, or with freely diffusing molecules in solution using confocal microscopy and point detectors. Experimental systems are available commercially but are typically home-built. Samples are prepared and the data collected using lab-specific protocols, where data are stored in a variety of file formats and analyzed using an array of increasingly powerful software. For the field in general and for structural studies in particular, it is important to demonstrate that smFRET, as a method, is reproducible and reliable regardless of where and how the sample is measured. To this end, in an effort led by Thorsten Hugel, twenty laboratories joined in measuring smFRET on several dsDNA constructs (Hellenkamp et al., 2018a). Studying six distinct samples with different dyes and varying inter-dye distances, the mean FRET efficiencies obtained by the participating labs exhibited a surprisingly high degree of agreement (a ΔE between 0.02 and 0.05 depending on the details of the sample). The quantitative assessment and reproducibility of the intensity-based smFRET measurements and discussions about data analysis was an important milestone. These dsDNA FRET standards are now available for every day calibration and are especially useful for new groups joining the community.\n\nEncouraged by the insights gained in the above-mentioned FRET endeavor (Hellenkamp et al., 2018a), new multi-lab blind studies have been initiated. The next comparative FRET study, led by Thorben Cordes, investigates the robustness and reliability of smFRET experiments on proteins undergoing ligand-induced conformational changes (Gebhardt et al., in preparation). This study uses two distinct model proteins to assess the reproducibility and accuracy of protein-based smFRET for inter-dye distance determination measurements. Protein systems bring new challenges, including statistical dye labeling, site-specific dye properties, protein stability, shipping, storage and conformational dynamics. Hence, the study also assesses the ability of smFRET to discover and quantify dynamics on different timescales from microseconds to seconds. Another FRET challenge, initiated by Sonja Schmid, is the kinSoftChallenge (http://www.kinsoftchallenge.com, Götz et al., in preparation), which evaluates existing tools for extracting kinetic information from single-molecule time trajectories. This challenge aims to: (1) demonstrate the ability of smFRET-based kinetic analyses to accurately infer dynamic information and (2) provide the community with the means of evaluating the different available software tools.\n\nOne important outcome of the various multi-lab FRET studies was that, although the agreement was good, it could be improved even further. In particular, the data analysis, and specifically corrections, can have an impact on the determined FRET efficiencies and resulting distances. Hence, an open discussion regarding which approaches work most reliably under what conditions is necessary. Access to the primary data and the ability to process them with various analysis approaches is, and will remain, the most transparent way to move the field forward. Currently, this is difficult given the many variations in methods employed, their documentation, file formats and experimental procedures implemented across laboratories establishing the optimal conditions, workflow and best practices even for existing, well-tested methods is challenging since a comparison of these methods is time-consuming and the necessary information is, in many cases, not available. With the increase in open scientific practices and submission of published data to repositories, a consensus is needed regarding what data and metadata should be stored and in which possible formats so that it can be readily utilized by the community."
