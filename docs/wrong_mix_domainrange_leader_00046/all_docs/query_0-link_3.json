        "text": "Lindab has published its results for Q2. Listen to CEO, Ola Ringdahl when he summarises the quarter and read the full report on the link below. Sales growth and improved operating margin: Lindab’s sales increased by 5 percent during the second quarter and reached the highest level ever for a single quarter. The operating margin improved to 9.6 percent. Business area Ventilation Systems, which represents approximately 75 percent of sales, continued to grow and delivered an operating margin of 10.4 percent. Profile Systems, which has been affected by weaker demand for several quarters, improved its operating margin to 8.7 percent thanks to implemented cost measures. Cash flow from operating activities was strong in the quarter.

A smart diffuser sees to it that the fresh air is transported along the roof and walls, and not just straight out. Get help finding out which one you need and where to place it for best effect, with our quick selection tool lindQST at https://loom.ly/7fe1rBA #lindab #ventilation #indoorclimate #wecareforindoorair #forabetterclimate\n\nLast week Lindab took part in a panel discussion hosted by Svensk Ventilation (Swedish Ventilation) during the Almedalen week in Sweden. Our Group Sustainability Manager, Matilda Isaksson, where among the panelists to discuss whether the property industry is actually ready for sustainability, circularity and energy efficiency. Almedalen week is the biggest political event in Sweden, hosted annually at the island of Gotland. \"We are at the beginning of a transformation where the industry needs to work more transparently and together, where we need to find profitable methods here and now while being visionary. Reuse is important but the primary focus must be to preserve and upgrade\" Matilda Isaksson concludes. #lindab #ventilation #indoorclimate #wecareforindoorair #forabetterclimate #almedalen\n\nOur latest post in the serial about good indoor air is about particulate matter. These are fine dust particles in the air that vary from 10, 2.5 and 1 microns or even less in width. To put it in context, there are about 10,000 microns in a cm. Outdoor particles primarily come from cars, trucks, and other vehicles, while indoor particles come from tobacco smoke, cooking, burning candles, etc. These are everywhere especially on things with fabrics. Dust levels above 100 microns/m3 may cause negative short-term health effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath. By using ventilation filters a majority of the particles from outside can be removed. To get rid of particulate matter already in place, consider buying an air purifier with HEPA filters.

That being said, summer is here and we hope that all of you will have a great one! #lindab #ventilation #indoorclimate #wecareforindoorair #forabetterclimate\n\nRight now, Lindabs production facility in Haderslev, Denmark, is producing no less than 250 pieces of large ducts for the wind turbine manufacturer Siemens. They are to be installed in paint booths at one of their UK locations. How large you might wonder? We are talking about 240 x 240 cm ducts, big enough to easily fit five full-grown Lindab employees inside. Building such large ducts is difficult work which requires 2-3 employees per channel, or else it gets too hard on both necks and arms. Pictured from left to right: Stefan Meier, Marco Meyer, Emil Battensby, Troels Jensen and Ole Larsen. #lindab #ventilation #indoorclimate #wecareforindoorair #forabetterclimate\n\nDo you think about the indoor air and how it will affect your sleep when selecting a hotel? A bad night's sleep could affect your productivity the next day. By asking for proper ventilation, more hotels will prioritize a healthy indoor environment for their guests. And by selecting hotels that have understood this already, you will wake up fresh and ready for a new day. #lindab #ventilation #indoorclimate #wecareforindoorair #forabetterclimate\n\nLindab complements its current operations in Denmark with the acquisition of Venti A/S. The acquisition gives Lindab better geographical coverage and increased production of ventilation ducts. Venti manufactures circular and rectangular ventilation ducts and is a distributor of ventilation products such as silencers, fittings, and a wide range of technical products for air diffusion. Sales and distribution take place in two locations in Denmark, outside Aarhus and Copenhagen. Venti does not sell Lindab products at present. \"Venti is a customer-focused company with solid ventilation knowledge,\" says Ola Ringdahl, President and CEO of Lindab. \"The Danish market appreciates premium products and, like Lindab, Venti produces ventilation ducts in the highest tightness class. When Venti becomes part of Lindab, we will together provide our customers throughout Denmark with the best service with the shortest delivery times. We look forward to developing the company further together with Managing Director and co-owner Søren Lindahl Klausen and his skilled employees\".
