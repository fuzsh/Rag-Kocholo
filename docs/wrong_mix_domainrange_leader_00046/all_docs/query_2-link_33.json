Along with his brothers, he attended Nieuwe Baarnse School and Het Baarnsch Lyceum in Baarn. After moving to Huis Ten Bosch in 1981, Willem-Alexander attended the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague. He completed his secondary education at Atlantic College in Llantwit Major, Wales, where he received an International Baccalaureate in 1985.\n\nFrom 1985 – 1987, Willem-Alexander received military training at the Royal Netherlands Naval College in Den Helder, The Netherlands and then he served on board the frigates HNLMS Tromp and HNLMS Abraham Crijnssen. He served as a reservist in the Royal Netherlands Navy until his accession to the throne in 2013 when he was honorably discharged.\n\nIn 1987, Willem-Alexander enrolled as a history student at Leiden University in Leiden, The Netherlands and received his Master of Arts degree in 1993. While he was at Leiden University, Willem-Alexander was a member of the Minerva Student Society. The topic for his Masters dissertation was the Dutch response to France’s decision under President de Gaulle to leave NATO’s integrated command structure.\n\nWillem-Alexander has long been interested in water management and sports issues. He was an honorary member of the World Commission on Water for the 21st century and patron of the Global Water Partnership. He was appointed as the Chairperson of the United Nations Secretary General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation in 2006.\n\nFrom 1995 – 1998, Willem-Alexander was a patron of the Dutch Olympic Games Committee. In 1998, he became a member of the International Olympic Committee. He resigned from the IOC upon becoming King in 2013.\n\nIn April of 1999, Willem-Alexander met his future wife Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti (born 1971 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) in Seville, Spain, during the Seville Spring Fair. He did not introduce himself as a Prince and at a later time when he told Máxima who he was, she thought he was joking. Willem-Alexander and Máxima announced their engagement on March 30, 2001. The couple’s relationship caused significant controversy due to the role Máxima’s father, Jorge Zorreguieta, had in the Argentinian military dictatorship. Máxima’s father was forbidden to attend his daughter’s wedding. Willem-Alexander and Máxima were married on February 2, 2002, in a civil ceremony in the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam and then in a religious ceremony at Amsterdam’s Nieuwe Kerk.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti\n\nKing Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima have three daughters:\n\nCatharina-Amalia Princess of Orange (born 2003)\n\nPrincess Alexia (born 2005)\n\nPrincess Ariane (born 2007)\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nOn January 28, 2013, Willem-Alexander’s mother Queen Beatrix announced her intention to abdicate in favor of him. Queen Beatrix signed the Instrument of Abdication at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam on April 30, 2013. Afterward, Willem-Alexander was inaugurated as King at the Nieuwe Kerk, adjacent to the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.\n\nWhen he became King of the Netherlands, Willem-Alexander resigned from most of his official executive functions. The reason given was that he wanted to be a “king of all”, which did not include executive functions of a limited number of organizations. Willem-Alexander remained actively involved with the Orange Fund because he considered it the most important of his organizations. He is the honorary patron of several organizations.\n\nWillem-Alexander is an avid pilot and has said that if he had not been born a royal, he would have liked to be an airline pilot. During the reign of his mother, he regularly flew the Dutch royal aircraft on trips. In May 2017, Willem-Alexander revealed that he had served as a first officer on KLM flights for 21 years, flying twice a month, even after his accession to the throne. Willem-Alexander was rarely recognized while in the KLM uniform. A few passengers recognized his voice although he never gave his name and only welcomed passengers on behalf of the captain and crew.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
