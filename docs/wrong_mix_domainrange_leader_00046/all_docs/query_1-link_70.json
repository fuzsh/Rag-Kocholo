The number of coefficients in the convolution trades-off accuracy with speed. A radially symmetric convolution kernel provides a favorable trade-off as compared to a separable kernel with the same number of coefficients.\n\n1761.\n\nVariable density spiral sampling and reconstruction for spatiotemporally encoded single-shot MRI\n\nLin Chen1, Shuhui Cai1, and Congbo Cai1\n\n1Department of Electronic Science, Xiamen Unviersity, Xiamen, China, People's Republic of\n\nAs an emerging ultrafast imaging method, spatiotemporally encoded single-shot MRI is advantageous because it can resist off-resonance effects while retaining spatial and temporal resolutions comparable to the classical EPI. In this work, a variable density spiral sampling (VDSS) scheme is proposed for SPEN MRI. An optimization algorithm is used to design the sinusoidal readout gradient waveform. A specific gridding algorithm and non-Cartesian super-resovled reconstruction are proposed to retrieve image. Compared to the Cartesian sampling, VDSS can provide images with less artifacts and better spatial resolution.\n\n1764.\n\nFast 3D Filtered Back-Projection Reconstruction combined with a New Radial-Acquisition Strategy.\n\nJeongTaek Lee1,2, Jinil Park1,2, and Jang-Yeon Park1,2\n\n1Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research, Institute for Basic Science, Suwon, Korea, Republic of,2Department of Biomedical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, Republic of\n\nRadial-acquisition imaging is recently gaining more popularity. For RA image reconstruction, both fast Fourier transform via gridding and filtered back-projection are available. Because of the processing time, FFT is dominantly used. If the processing-time issue is resolved, 3D FBP can be promising in the case of FID sampling or echo sampling with mis-centering of k-space. In this study, we propose a strategy that can significantly reduce the reconstruction time of 3D FBP in combination with a new RA scheme. Performance of the proposed method was demonstrated in phantom and human brain imaging at 3T.\n\n1765.\n\nGROG Based Sensitivity Map Estimation for Radial Data in MRI\n\nmahwish khan1, Taquwa Aslam1, and Hammad Omer1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, COMSATS institute of information technology, Islamabad, Pakistan\n\nThe estimation of receiver coil sensitivity profiles is required for many PMRI algorithms including CG-SENSE. Conventionally,CG-SENSE uses pre-scan method to estimate the sensitivity maps for which a separate scan is required. The novelty in this work is the use of GROG gridding on the central region of the acquired under-sampled cardiac radial data to estimate the receiver coil sensitivities using Eigen-value method. The results show that GROG based sensitivity map estimation (proposed method) is an effective method without any requirement of a prior scan or body coil image.\n\n1766.\n\nRun and Done: Calibrationless Multichannel Continuously Moving Table Whole Body MRI with Immediate Reconstruction\n\nDavid S Smith1, Saikat Sengupta1, Aliya Gifford1, and E Brian Welch1\n\n1Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States\n\nWe achieve significantly improved image quality in whole-body continuous moving table MRI without time penalty by using a multichannel, golden angle radial acquisition coupled to a calibrationless reconstruction.\n\n1772.\n\nIterative Progressive Length Conjugate Gradient Reconstruction in MR-PARSE\n\nCharles G Cantrell1, Parmede Vakil1,2, Donald R Cantrell3, Yong Jeong1, Sameer A Ansari3, and Timothy J Carroll1,3\n\n1Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern, Chicago, IL, United States,2College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, United States,3Radiology, Northwestern, Chicago, IL, United States\n\nWe have found that performing iterative PLCG dramatically (on average 55% better) improves reconstruction quality of an MR-PARSE acquisition. Moreover, iterative PLCG has shown to be capable of reconstruction in regions with large susceptibility artifact. Consistent frequency measurements allow us to remove static offsets caused by air interfaces near the earholes and sinuses leaving dynamic frequency offsets which transpose linearly to OEF. Furthermore, our approach to prevent local minima solutions, through the use of an iterative PLCG, represents a new approach that may improve upon many other complex reconstruction methods.\n\n1767.\n\nPhase correction in the presence of gradient delays for 3D radial data\n\nIna Nora Kompan1 and Matthias Guenther2\n\n1mediri GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany,2Fraunhofer Mevis, Bremen, Germany\n\n3D radial acquisitions are prone to gradient delay and phase artifacts, which need to be corrected for. Ideally, the phase can be retrospectively corrected for by assuming the same phase in k-space center where all projections meet. However, if data are affected by gradient delays, profiles are shifted at varying angles and might not intersect at all. Here, a simple to apply, novel phase correction method is presented in which the changed trajectory due to gradient delays is incorporated into 3D phase correction. It was shown that artifacts are reduced by 12% compared to only gradient delay corrections.\n\n1770.\n\nSimultaneous Multi-slice MRF with Controlled Aliasing Enabled by Temporal Data Sharing\n\nDi Cui1, Hing-Chiu Chang1, Hua Guo2, Queenie Chan3, and Edward S Hui1\n\n1Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,2Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, People's Republic of,3Philips Healthcare, Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n\nMagnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables simultaneous quantification of multiple relaxation parameters, which is further accelerated by usage of simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) technique. SENSE based SMS-MRF reconstruction suffers high g-factor penalty due to similar coil sensitivity profiles of collapsed slices. Here we proposed a new method to solve this problem, by data re-grouping from adjacent time points, spatial controlled aliasing is enabled, after dictionary matching, good parameter mapping of 2 slices with nearly the same sensitivity is acquired at half the acquisition time of single-excitation MRF.\n\n1759.\n\nJoint Water-Fat Separation and Deblurring with Single Spiral In-Out Spin-Echo Imaging\n\nDinghui Wang1, Zhiqiang Li1, Ryan K. Robison1, and James G. Pipe1\n\n1Imaging research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States\n\nSpiral in-out readout is an efficient sampling scheme for T2-weighted (T2w) spin-echo (SE) sequences. Two sets of spiral in-out data at different TEs are typically acquired so that deblurred water and fat images can be extracted from the spiral-in and the spiral-out data separately, which are then combined together. A method has been recently proposed to reconstruct water and fat images from a single set of spiral in-out data. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using this method as a fast and scan efficient means of fat suppression to reduce the scan time of the spiral T2w SE by a factor of 2.\n\n1762.\n\nSingle shot spiral imaging at ultra-high field\n\nMaria Engel1, Lars Kasper1, Christoph Barmet1, Klaas Paul Pr�ssmann1, and Thomas Schmid1\n\n1Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nFast spiral sequences with concurrent field monitoring, B0 correction and SENSE-reconstruction promise a brave new world for time series MRI.\n\n1760.\n\nSpiral Deblurring Using B0 Maps with B0 Drift Correction\n\nMelvyn B Ooi1,2, Dinghui Wang2, Ashley G Anderson III2, Zhiqiang Li2, Nicholas R Zwart2, Ryan K Robison2, and James G Pipe2\n\n1Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH, United States,2Imaging Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States\n\nSpiral MRI enables long sampling durations but at the cost of increased sensitivity to B0-field fluctuations. For example, scanner B0-drift will be observed in spiral MRI as a time-varying component of image blurring. A spiral deblurring strategy is presented where a reference B0 map is acquired at the start of the spiral exam; F0 navigators then quickly measure B0 drift over the course of the spiral exam, and are used to calculate B0-drift corrected B0-maps for deblurring of the current scan. F0-navigator accuracy is verified with independent B0-map acquisitions, and improved spiral deblurring is shown for a structural brain scan.\n\n1768.\n\nAccelerating radial MRI using GROG followed by ESPIRiT\n\nIbtisam Aslam1, Faisal Najeeb1, and Hammad Omer1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan\n\nAccelerated non-Cartesian parallel imaging plays a vital role to reduce data acquisition time in the MR imaging; however the resultant images may contain aliasing artifacts. In this work, the application of ESPIRiT with GROG is proposed to get good reconstruction results from highly under-sampled radial data. The proposed method is tested on 3T short�axis cardiac radial data at different acceleration factors (AF=4, 6 and 9) and compared with pseudo-Cartesian GRAPPA. The results show that the proposed method offers significant improved (e.g. 81% improvement in term of artifact power at AF=4) reconstruction results as compared to conventional pseudo-Cartesian GRAPPA.\n\n1769.\n\nK-T ARTS-GROWL: An Efficient Combination of Dynamic Artificial Sparsity and Parallel Imaging Method for DCE MRI Reconstruction\n\nZhifeng Chen1, Liyi Kang1, Allan Jin2, Feng Liu3, Ling Xia1, and Feng Huang2\n\n1Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, People's Republic of,2Philips Healthcare (Suzhou) Co. Ltd, Suzhou, China, People's Republic of,3School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Queensland, Australia\n\nDynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI plays an important role in the detection of liver metastases, characterization of tumors, assessing tumor response and studying diffuse liver disease. It requires a high spatial-temporal resolution. Existing iterative dynamic MRI reconstruction algorithms, such as iGRASP and L+S, realize their functions through iterative schemes. Though the solutions are generally acceptable, yet suffer from significantly high computational cost. This study proposed to use dynamic artificial sparsity and non-Cartesian parallel imaging for high spatiotemporal resolution DCE reconstruction, which results in comparable image quality relative to the above iterative schemes with greatly reduced computational cost.\n\n1771.\n\nLine profile measure as a stopping criterion in CG-SENSE Reconstruction\n\nTaquwa Aslam1, Mahwish Khan1, Ali Raza Shahid1, and Hammad Omer1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of information technology, Islamabad, Pakistan\n\nCG SENSE is an iterative algorithm used in PMRI for MR image reconstruction from under-sampled data. One major limitation of CG-SENSE is the appropriate choice of the number of iterations required for good reconstruction results.This paper proposes the use of a correlation measure between the line profiles of the reconstructed images in the current and the previous iteration, as a stopping criterion for the CG-SENSE algorithm. Results of the proposed method are compared with the Bregman distance stopping criterion. The results show that the use of line profile correlation measure acts as an effective stopping criterion in CG-SENSE.\n\n1773.\n\nImproved identification and clinical utility of pseudo-inverse with constraints (PICO) reconstruction for PROPELLER MRI\n\nJyh-Miin Lin1, Andrew J. Patterson2, Chung-Wei Lee3, Ya-Fang Chen3, Tilak Das4, Daniel Scoffings5, Hsiao-Wen Chung6, Jonathan H. Gillard1, and Martin J. Graves2\n\n1Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom,2MRIS unit, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom,3Department of Radiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan,4Addenbrooke�s Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom,5Department of Radiology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom,6Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan\n\nPROPELLER MRI can reduce motion artifacts. However, the colored noise of PROPELLER could degrade the image quality. Although the iterative Pseudo-Inverse withCOnstraints (PICO) has been proposed to improve the image quality metrics, further clinical validation is needed. In this study, two neuroradiologists compared the image quality of PICO with the standard density compensation. Results show that PICO significantly improves the identification of two anatomical structures and the clinical utility.\n\n1774.\n\nThe Development and Evaluation of the Novel Brain Phantom for the PROPELLER with Motion Correction\n\nKousaku Saotome1, Akira Matsushita1, Koji Matsumoto2, Yoshiaki Kato3, Kei Nakai4, Yoshiyuki Sankai5, and Akira Matsumura4\n\n1Center for Cybernics Research, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan,2Department of Radiology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan,3Medical Technology Department, Kameda General Hospital, Kamogawa, Japan,4Department of Neurosurgery, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan,5Faculty of Engineering, Information and Systems, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan\n\nOur purpose is to develop the novel brain phantom including low contrast and to verify its potential to emphasize the motion correction effects in PROPELLER. Our proposed phantom set would allow not only to add the ability to low contrast objects but also to provide exact rotations instead of a healthy volunteer. The making process of the phantom consists of making profile curves, transforming to depths of the convexo-concave, printing using 3-D printer, and pouring agarose. This is the novel phantom making process.\n\n1783.\n\nSmart Averaging: SNR Improvement by Retrospective Filtering\n\nRolf Pohmann1 and Klaus Scheffler1,2\n\n1Magnetic Resonance Center, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, T�bingen, Germany,2Biomedical Magnetic Resonance, University T�bingen, T�bingen, Germany\n\nAveraging is a frequently used way to increase the SNR of a measurement. Here we show that spending the additional time for increasing the spatial resolution and applying a retrospective k-space filter can yield a higher SNR gain than conventional averaging. For weighting in two phase encoding directions, this can increase the SNR by up to 25%. For 3D weighting, SNR gain can reach 57%, if the additional acquired k-space points are used to increase the readout duration, and 38% for equal duration for weighted and unweighted acquisition.\n\n1784.\n\nJoint Reconstruction of PET and MRI with Attenuation Correction Incorporating TOF Information\n\nRong Guo1, Yicheng Chen2, Jinsong Ouyang3, Georges El Fakhri3, and Kui Ying1\n\n1Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, People's Republic of,2University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States,3Center for Advanced Radiological Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States\n\nJoint reconstruction of PET and MRI is aimed to improve both PET and MR image quality using information from each other�s imaging modality. However, the aim cannot be achieved without correcting the attenuation of PET. We proposed a method to correct attenuation during the process of simultaneous PET and MRI images reconstruction. This method integrates PET, MRI and TOF information.\n\n1785.\n\nNovel Half Fourier Reconstruction Recovering Signal Loss from Off-resonance\n\nSeul Lee1 and Gary Glover2\n\n1Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States\n\nSince half k-space reconstruction reduces scan time while keeping spatial resolution, it can be used for T2* weighted images such as functional MRI that requires fairly long TE. Functional MRI is sensitive to off-resonance because there exist large susceptibility variations in air-tissue interfaces such as sinuses. Existing half k-space reconstruction is vulnerable to off-resonance since it might lose most of the image energy when there is a large amount of phase shift. In this study, we suggest a new half k-space reconstruction method that is more robust to off-resonance compared to existing reconstruction method.\n\n1786.\n\nAn FPGA Based Real-Time Data Processing Structure � Application to Real-Time Array Coil Data Compression\n\nJosip Marjanovic1, Jonas Reber1, David Otto Brunner1, Bertram Jakob Wilm1,2, and Klaas Paul Pruessmann1\n\n1Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland,2Skope Magnetic Resonance Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nData amounts of massive parallel receiver arrays as well as latency requirements of real-time applications such as interventional MRI, navigators etc. prompt for high-speed data preprocessing. First steps in the reconstruction such as noise pre-whitening or channel combinations and compressions can be efficiently performed on FPGAs. Here we present a flexible system and software architecture for such tasks and demonstrate its capability performing real-time coil compression directly in the spectrometer.\n\n1787.\n\nA k-space De-Noising Technique for RFI Mitigation and Zipper Artefact Elimination\n\nYong Liu1 and Paul R. Harvey2\n\n1Philips Research China, Shanghai, China, People's Republic of,2Philips MR, Best, Netherlands\n\nExtraneous in-band Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) signals can mix with the MR signal of a subject creating artefacts in the image data, usually zipper like artefacts. In order to eliminate/reduce the impact of RFI, this abstract describes a software de-noising method which can be implemented both online and off-line through k-space manipulation.\n\n1788.\n\nThe Optimal Condition for Maintaining Uniform k-space Coverage after Retrospective Respiratory Gating in 3D Radial-Acquisition Imaging\n\nJinil Park1,2, Taehoon Shin3, Soon Ho Yoon4,5, Jin Mo Goo4,5,6, and Jang-Yeon Park1,2\n\n1Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research, Institute for Basic Science, Suwon, Korea, Republic of,2Department of Biomedical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea, Republic of,3Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States,4Department of Radiology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,5Institute of Radiation Medicine, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,6Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of\n\nRadial-acquisition imaging is suitable for lung imaging because it allows a very short TE and a desirable degree of motion insensitivity. Despite its tolerance to motion artifacts, respiratory motion is still a major reason of causing image artifacts in lung imaging, which motivates the need for the respiratory gating. In retrospective-respiratory gating, it is significant to keep the k-space as uniform as possible after gating. In this study, we explore the optimal condition for obtaining uniform k-space coverage after retrospective gating in consideration of various breathing patterns.\n\n1789.\n\nImage Super-resolution Restoration based on Structure Feature in Fourier Domain for MR Images\n\nLijun Bao1\n\n1Department of Electronic Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, People's Republic of\n\nIn the learning based single image super-resolution restoration, the high frequency information is enhanced by retrieving the high-frequency information from the high resolution training samples. Therefore how to reveal the underlying relations between the HR and the LR patch spaces is the key issue. In this work, we propose to cluster the pre-collected HR example patches to generate subdictionary and select the proper subdictionary for any image patch according to the frequency spectrum feature in Fourier domain, because the Fourier spectrogram can reflect the feature complexity, local directionality and the texture periodicity of the image patch simultaneously.\n\n1790.\n\nHigh-Resolution Susceptibility Weighted Images Derived from fMRI Images using Super-Resolution Reconstruction\n\nWeiran Deng1, Michael Herbst1, and V. Andrew Stenger1\n\n1University of Hawaii JABSOM, Honolulu, HI, United States\n\nA subset of fMRI images is used to reconstruct a structural image at a higher resolution using a Super-Resolution (SR) reconstruction method. The subset of fMRI images are selected such that the translation and rotation between the shots are less than the pixel size and therefore useful for modeling the pixel characteristics. The preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing a structural image with susceptibility contrast from a subset of fMRI images.\n\n1791.\n\nRotation and Translation Estimation from simple 1D MR Navigators\n\nMoosa Zaidi1, Joseph Cheng1, Tao Zhang1, and John Pauly1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States\n\nSensitivity to motion remains a major limitation to the clinical utility of MRI. Self-navigating Cartesian trajectory (Butterfly) can provide coil-by-coil estimates of local linear translation without lengthening scan time or requiring external sensors. We propose to combine translational motion estimates with the geometry of the differing coil sensitivities to estimate global translation and rotation. These estimates can then be used to retrospectively correct for motion. For 2D slices we are successfully able to extract both unknown rotation with known translation and unknown translation and unknown rotation. Extension to 3D is a promising direction for future work.\n\n1792.\n\nSelective combination of MRI phase images\n\nViktor Vegh1, Kieran O'Brien2, David C Reutens1, Steffen Bollmann1, and Markus Barth1\n\n1Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia,2Magnetic Resonance, Siemens Healthcare Pty. Ltd., Brisbane, Australia\n\nSignal phase acquired via gradient recalled echo MRI sequences provides and an important source of tissue contrast. The use of phased array coils results in multiple-channel images that have to be combined to form a single image. A robust method of computing phase images has been challenging to develop, primarily due to the distribution of noise in phase images. We propose a new approach of combining phase images by exploiting the inherent noise in signal phase. Our selectively combined signal phase results show an improvement in the quality of the combined phase image in comparison to existing methods.\n\n1782.\n\nAnimating Terabytes of Imaging Data from a One-Minute Scan: Interactive Reconstruction of Flexibly Acquired MRI Data\n\nDavid S Smith1, Saikat Sengupta1, Aliya Gifford1, and E Brian Welch1\n\n1Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States\n\nWe present a software system called CITRON that can extract, reconstruct, and display images from non-Cartesian MR data at 60 frames per second, allowing the user to vary the reconstruction parameters in real time in order to explore and optimize the reconstructed images interactively.\n\n1793.\n\nPartial Fourier fMRI acquisition pipeline for optimal half k-space coverage\n\nChristine Law1, Gary Glover1, and Sean Mackey1\n\n1Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States\n\nWe present a novel idea for quickly detecting the optimal half k-space for use in partial Fourier acquisition. With EPI acquisition, the center of k-space can be offset from the origin by local magnetic field inhomogeneity. This offset can occur in both positive and negative phase encode directions. For partial Fourier acquisition, it is important to sample the portion of k-space containing the center peak. Before data collection using partial Fourier acquisition, a reference scan that collects two time frames (each with different halves of k-space coverage) can be used to determine the proper half of k-space to collect for each slice.\n\n1781.\n\nUniting Reconstruction Software for Native Use in GPI\n\nNicholas R. Zwart1, Ashley G. Anderson III1, Ryan K. Robison1, Andrew Li2, Mariya Doneva2,3, Frank Ong2, Martin Uecker2, Michael Lustig2, and James G. Pipe1\n\n1Imaging Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States,2Electrical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States,3Philips Research, Hamburg, Germany\n\nThis work proposes the use of the software development platform called GPI (Graphical Programming Interface) as a tool for resourcing other work for integration and comparison. The GPI software structure is designed to facilitate the encapsulation of outside libraries and provides a plug-in model to isolate package dependencies. The library featured in this work is the Berkley Advanced Reconstruction Toolkit (BART) which provides, multi-platform compatible, compressed sensing and parallel imaging algorithms.\n\n1794.\n\nBanding free bSSFP CINE imaging using a multi-frequency reconstruction\n\nAnne Slawig1, Tobias Wech1, Johannes Tran-Gia1,2, Henning Neubauer1, Thorsten Bley1, and Herbert K�stler1\n\n1Departement for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University of W�rzburg, W�rzburg, Germany,2Department of Nuclear Medicine, W�rzburg, Germany\n\nImaging of the beating heart is one of the main challenges in fast MRI. Balanced steady state free precession sequences are fast, yield high signal and have excellent contrast between blood and myocardium. Unfortunately, they are sensitive to field inhomogeneities, which lead to banding artifacts, considerably reducing the image quality. As the steady state tolerates small shifts in frequency it is possible to acquire a frequency- modulated bSSFP. Our study uses such a frequency-modulated approach in combination with a multi-frequency reconstruction to obtain banding free CINE images, with high signal and good contrast.\n\n1779.\n\nUniversal iterative denoising of complex-valued volumetric MR image data using supplementary information\n\nStephan A.R. Kannengiesser1, Boris Mailhe2, Mariappan Nadar2, Steffen Huber3, and Berthold Kiefer1\n\n1MR Application Predevelopment, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany,2Medical Imaging Technologies, Siemens Healthcare, Princeton, NJ, United States,3Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States\n\nSpatially varying noise limits acquisition speed and spatial resolution in multi-channel MRI. Conventional single-slice noise-suppressing image filters without additional knowledge about data acquisition, image reconstruction, and noise level, have limited performance and need parameter tuning. In this work, an iterative denoising algorithm is presented which works with standard settings on 3D complex-valued data with supplementary information from the scanner environment.\n\nInitial results from routine clinical imaging are promising: spatially adaptive, as intended, and superior to a commercially available image filter. Non-optimized reconstruction times of up to 15min per volume still need improvement, and further clinical investigations will be performed.\n\n1795.\n\nCombination of Individual Coil QSM at High Field Strength (7T)\n\nUten Yarach1, Hendrik Mattern1, Alessandro Sciarra1, and Oliver Speck1\n\n1Department of Biomedical Magnetic Resonance, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany\n\nPhase image reconstruction from multi-channel data at high field strength becomes challenging since a volume body coil that provides the phase offset information is generally not available. Several coil combination techniques are still computation intensive and prone to errors for strongly T2*-weighted data due to the requirement of spatial smoothness of image phases, required phase reference from body coil scan, and also hampered for strongly localized B1 coil sensitivities. These limitations lead to phase image inconsistencies and may cause artifacts in QSMs. We demonstrated here that the coil combination should be considered after performing individual physical and/or virtual coil QSM.\n\n1780.\n\nMulti atlas-based attenuation correction for brain FDG-PET imaging using a TOF-PET/MR scanner� comparison with clinical single atlas- and CT-based attenuation correction\n\nTetsuro Sekine1,2, Ninon Burgos3, Geoffrey Warnock1, Martin Huellner1, Alfred Buck1, Edwin ter Voert1, M.

We compared multi-atlas method with clinical single-atlas method. Our study revealed that the error of PET images based on multi-atlas method is reduced from 1.5% to 1.2% compared to the single-atlas method, a 30% improvement.\n\n1778.\n\nExploiting deep convolutional neural network for fast magnetic resonance imaging\n\nShanshan Wang1, Zhenghang Su1,2, Leslie Ying3, Xi Peng1, and Dong Liang1\n\n1Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technologies, Shenzhen, China, People's Republic of,2School of Information Technologies, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, People's Republic of,3Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, United States\n\nThis paper proposes a deep learning based approach for accelerating MR imaging. With the utilization of a large number of existing high-quality MR images, we train an off-line convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the mapping relationship between MR images obtained from zero-filled and fully-sampled k-space data. Then the trained CNN is employed to predict an image from undersampled data, which is used as the reference in solving an online constrained imaging problem. Results on in vivo datasets show that the proposed approach is capable of restoring fine details and presents great potential for efficient and effective MR imaging.\n\n1777.\n\nImproved Nyquist ghost removal for single-shot spatiotemporally encoded (SPEN) MRI with joint rank constraint\n\nCongyu Liao1, Ying Chen1, Hongjian He1, Song Chen1, Hui Liu2, Qiuping Ding1, and Jianhui Zhong1\n\n1Department of Biomedical Engineering, Center for Brain Imaging Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, People's Republic of,2MR Collaboration NE Asia, Siemens Healthcare, Shanghai, China, People's Republic of\n\nIn this study, a rank constraint based Nyquist ghost removal method is proposed for single-shot spatiotemporally encoded (SPEN) MRI.\n\n1776.\n\nRobust PET attenuation correction for PET/MR using joint estimation with MR-based priors: application to whole-body clinical TOF PET/MR data\n\nSangtae Ahn1, Lishui Cheng1, Dattesh Shanbhag2, and Florian Wiesinger3\n\n1GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, United States,2GE Global Research, Bangalore, India,3GE Global Research, Munich, Germany\n\nPET attenuation correction is critical to accurate PET quantitation. For hybrid PET/MR imaging, MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) has challenges in implants, internal air, bones and lung regions where MR signals are low. To address the challenges and improve robustness and accuracy of MRAC, a joint estimation algorithm with MR-based priors is implemented where prior weights are spatially modulated, providing great flexibility to users. The JE algorithm was applied to whole-body clinical TOF PET/MR data and it was demonstrated that the algorithm can recover the attenuation of implants, abdominal air and lungs in a robust way.\n\n1775.\n\nJoint Estimation of Attenuation and Activity Distributions for Clinical non-TOF FDG Head Patient PET/MR Data Employing MR Prior Information\n\nThorsten Heu�er1, Christopher M Rank1, Martin T Freitag2, Heinz-Peter Schlemmer2, Antonia Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss3, Thomas Beyer4, and Marc Kachelrie�1\n\n1Medical Physics in Radiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany,2Department of Radiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany,3Clinical Cooperation Unit Nuclear Medicine, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany,4Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria\n\nTo improve attenuation correction (AC) and thus PET quantification for PET/MR imaging, we have recently proposed a method to jointly estimate attenuation and activity distributions from the non-TOF PET emission data. Available MR information is used to derive voxel-specific expectations on the attenuation coefficients, favoring the occurrence of pre-selected attenuation values corresponding to air, soft tissue, and bone. We here present first results for clinical non-TOF18F-FDG PET/MR data sets of the head region. PET reconstruction was performed using MR-based AC as provided by the vendor, our proposed algorithm, and CT-based AC for comparison.\n\n1796.\n\nImproving EPI Phase Correction for Breast DWI\n\nJessica A McKay1, Steen Moeller2, Sudhir Ramanna2, Edward J Auerbach2, Michael T Nelson2, Kamil Ugurbil2, Essa Yacoub2, and Patrick J Bolan2\n\n1Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States,2Department of Radiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States\n\nIt is important to improve ghost correction in breast DWI using SE-EPI because residual ghosts bias ADC measurements, which reflect malignancy. The standard ghost correction method using a 3-line navigator frequently fails in breast DWI. In this work we implemented several alternative ghost correction strategies. The two best methods outperformed the standard 3-line navigator correction. These techniques applied 1D, linear corrections based on 1) phase maps from separate reference scans and 2) entropy minimization.\n\n1797.\n\nSimultaneous Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation Involving MRI Information as a Prior\n\nRong Guo1, Pei Han1, Yicheng Chen2, Jinsong Ouyang3, Georges El Fakhri3, and Kui Ying1\n\n1Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, People's Republic of,2UC Berkeley-UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States,3Center for Advanced Radiological Sciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States\n\nThe maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) method usually utilizes time-of-flight (TOF) information to solve the problem of attenuation correction. However, the application of TOF brings noise. In this work, we proposed a method, Maximum a Posteriori for simultaneous activity and attenuation reconstruction (MAPAA), which introduces MRI information as prior knowledge into MLAA to reduce noise.\n\n1798.\n\nComparison of strict sparsity and low-rank constraints for accelerated FMRI data reconstruction\n\nCharles Guan1 and Mark Chiew2\n\n1Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Fremont, CA, United States,2FMRIB Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom\n\nFunctional MRI has been slow to benefit from data acceleration techniques based on non-linear image reconstruction. We present a comparison of two non-linear image reconstruction methods based on sparsity and low-rank models of FMRI data. k-t FOCUSS uses an asymptotic L1 minimization program to solve for a sparse x-f reconstruction. In contrast, k-t FASTER solves for a spatio-temporally low-rank reconstruction using an iterative hard thresholding and matrix shrinkage algorithm, without requiring a pre-specified basis. We applied each algorithm to incoherently sampled FMRI data and demonstrate that the strict rank-constraint method outperforms spectral- and Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT)-sparsity across different metrics.\n\n1799.\n\n3D Water-Fat Turbo Spin Echo Imaging in the Knee using CS-SENSE\n\nHolger Eggers1, Christian Stehning1, Mariya Doneva1, Elwin de Weerdt2, and Peter B�rnert1,3\n\n1Philips Research, Hamburg, Germany,2Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands,3Department of Radiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands\n\n3D Dixon TSE scans essentially provide the same information as several conventional 2D TSE scans in different orientation, without and with fat suppression. However, their scan time is usually still too long for clinical practice. In this work, the basic feasibility of accelerating a 3D Dixon TSE scan with PD weighting by a combination of compressed sensing and parallel imaging was investigated in knee imaging. Results obtained in half the scan time compared to the use of parallel imaging alone are presented, which indicate that 3D Dixon TSE scans may become as fast as current, conventional 3D TSE scans with fat suppression.\n\n1800.\n\nJoint Motion Estimation and Image Reconstruction Using Alternating Minimization\n\nLuonan Wang1 and Daniel S Weller1\n\n1Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States\n\nThis abstract provides a joint motion estimation and image reconstruction method for data acquired using a spiral pulse sequence. It forms a data fitting term with image and motion variables and uses alternating minimization with conjugate gradients to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. This approach will allow MR scanning to be more robust to non-rigid motion while still achieve fast image reconstruction. The new approach will enable MR imaging with children without sedation.\n\n1801.\n\nLearning-based Reconstruction using Artificial Neural Network for Higher Acceleration\n\nKinam Kwon1, Dongchan Kim1, Hyunseok Seo1, Jaejin Cho1, Byungjai Kim1, and HyunWook Park1\n\n1KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of\n\nA long imaging time has been regarded as a major drawback of MRI, and many techniques have been proposed to overcome this problem. Parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS) techniques utilize different sensitivity of multi-channel RF coils and sparsity of signal in a certain domain to remove aliasing artifacts that are generated by subsampling, respectively. In this study, an artificial neural networks (ANN) are applied to MR reconstruction to reduce imaging time, and it is shown that the ANN model has a potential to be comparable to PI and CS.\n\n1802.\n\nReconstruction of Complex Images using Under-sampled Signal at Equal Interval in Phase Scrambling Fourier Transform Imaging\n\nSatoshi ITO1, Shungo YASAKA1, and Yoshifumi YAMADA1\n\n1Information and Controls Systems Sciences, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Japan\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new fast image reconstruction method in which a regularly undersampled signal is used instead of random sampling, as is used in compressed sensing. To diffuse the aliasing artifact caused by under-sampling, we adopt phase-scrambling Fourier transform imaging. The proposed method has an advantage over CS in that the quality of the image does not depend on the selection of the sampling trajectory. Simulation studies and experiments show that the proposed method has almost the same peak signal-to-noise ratio as that of a compressed sensing reconstruction.\n\n1803.\n\nAccelerated EPRI Using Partial Fourier Compressed Sensing Reconstruction With POCS Phase Map Estimation and Spherical Sampling\n\nChia-Chu Chou1, Taehoon Shin2, JiaChen Zhuo2, Gadisetti Chandramouli3, Murali Cherukuri3, and Rao Gullapalli2\n\n1Elecetrical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, Beltsville, MD, United States,21Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States,3National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States\n\nIn Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Imaging (EPRI), each single k-space point is typically acquired per excitation and lengthens the acquisition time. In order to accelerate the imaging process, we raised a new image reconstruction method, Partial Fourier Compressed Sensing (PFCS), to address this problem. With PFCS, the images can be reconstructed from 25% of the k space and hence accelerate the imaging process to less than 1min. We also demonstrated PFCS reconstructed linewidth map were able to monitor the oxygen change in the tumor tissue.\n\n1804.\n\nParameter selection in Total Generalized Variation based reconstruction problems.\n\nCarlos Milovic1,2, Jose Miguel Pinto1,2, Julio Acosta-Cabronero3, Pablo Irarrazaval1,2, and Cristian Tejos1,2\n\n1Department of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile,2Biomedical Imaging Center, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile,3German Center for Neurodegenerative Deceases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany\n\nAn strategy for parameter selection in TGV regularized reconstruction problems is presented, with applications to deconvolutions and QSM. This allows fine-tuning of parameters in an efficient way and the use of predictors that are correlated to optimized results in terms of MSRE. This allows users to automatize or accelerate the parameter selection, critical in expensive problems such as QSM and reduce the error in the reconstruction.\n\n1805.\n\nSNR and Banding Artifact Reduction Analysis of Phase-Cycled Elliptical Signal Model bSSFP\n\nSteven T. Whitaker1, Meredith Taylor1, Haonan Wang1, and Neal K. Bangerter1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, United States\n\nBalanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) provides high signal in short scan times. A new method for combining four or more phase-cycled bSSFP acquisitions was recently proposed that uses an elliptical signal model (ESM) of the bSSFP signal. In this study, we compare the SNR performance and effectiveness at reducing banding artifact of the ESM, complex sum, and sum-of-squares techniques across a range of T1 and T2 values, flip angles, and base SNR levels. Although ESM produces near perfect band removal in high SNR situations, it breaks down for certain tissues and in low SNR situations.\n\n1806.\n\nEcho-planar imaging for a 9.4 Tesla vertical standard bore superconducting magnet using an unshielded gradient coil\n\nNao Kodama1 and Katsumi Kose1\n\n1Institute of Applied Physics, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan\n\nEcho planar imaging sequences were developed for a 9.4 Tesla vertical standard bore (~54 mm) superconducting magnet using an unshielded gradient coil. Because EPI requires fast switching of intense magnetic field gradients, eddy currents were induced in the surrounding metallic materials, e.g., the room temperature bore, and this produced serious artifacts on the EPI images. We solved the problem using an unshielded gradient coil set of proper size (39 mm OD, 32 mm ID) and reference scans. The obtained EPI images of a phantom and a plant sample were almost artifact free and demonstrated the promise of our approach.\n\n1807.\n\nSERIAL Excitation with Parallel Reception Allows Human Brain Imaging at 9.4 Tesla at Low Power and with Acceptable Image Uniformity across the Full Field of View\n\nKeith R. Thulborn1, Chao Ma2, Ian C. Atkinson1, Theodore C. Claiborne1, Steven M. Wright3, and Reiner Umathum4\n\n1Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, United States,2Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States,3Department of Biomedical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, United States,4Division of Medical Physics in Radiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany\n\nSERIAL excitation produces uniform image intensity at low power at ultra high field but has not been applied to humans. FLASH sequences modified for sequential single coil excitation while retaining full array receive mode were combined with generalized total variation regularized SENSE reconstruction and 4- and 8- arrayed coils. Images with acceptable uniformity, contrast and resolution over the in vivo human brain are demonstrated at 9.4T using low power.\n\n1808.\n\nAn Optimized Slice Acquisition Order in HASTE Imaging with a Short TR\n\nWei Liu1 and Kun Zhou1\n\n1Siemens Shenzhen Magnetic Resonance Ltd, Shenzhen, China, People's Republic of\n\nIn this study, an optimized slice acquisition ordering method was proposed to improve the signal attenuation and contrast alteration caused by the crosstalk and MT effect in multi-slice HASTE imaging using a short TR. It demonstrated that a shorter acquisition time is possible with an optimized slice acquisition order. It allows a shorter TR, whilst maintaining the SNR and contrast similar to the conventional one, which is particularly useful in the abdominal imaging.\n\n1809.\n\nConcurrent Excitation and Acquisition in Steady State: T1-Modulation Effects of Frequency Sweep\n\nAli Caglar �zen1, Jan Korvink2, and Michael Bock1\n\n1Dept. of Radiology - Medical Physics, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany,2Institute of Microstructure Technology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany\n\nConcurrent Excitation and Acquisition (CEA) enables MRI with true zero echo times, and full signal acquisition efficiency. However, frequency sweep along readout gradients results in sequential excitation of spins at different locations, thus a unique TR is experienced by each spin at each radial acquisition spoke. In this work, implications of modulations in transverse magnetization as a function of T1, flip angle and TR were investigated for 2D and 3D radial acquisition schemes with equidistant point trajectory, segmented ordering and golden angle ordering. Resulting changes in point spread function (PSF) of a point source located at the edge of the field of view (FOV) were analyzed and discussed.\n\n1810.\n\nThree dimensional T1 and T2* mapping of human lung parenchyma using interleaved saturation recovery and dual echo ultrashort echo time imaging\n\nNeville D Gai1, Ashkan A Malayeri1, and David A Bluemke1\n\n1Radiology & Imaging Sciences, NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States\n\nLung T1/T2* may be useful in discriminating between normal and pathological tissue particularly in disorders such as fibrosis, edema or emphysema. Quantitative mapping of the lung parenchyma is challenging due to the low proton density, respiratory and cardiac motion and susceptibility effects. Here we describe a technique based on segmented respiratory triggered 3D ultrashort echo time dual-echo radial imaging interleaved with and without a WET saturation pulse to estimate T1 and T2* maps simultaneously in a single scan. The results show that T1/T2* mapping of lung parenchyma can be reliably performed with relatively high resolution in a clinically feasible time.\n\n1811.\n\nPotential image artifacts in ultrashort echo-time imaging\n\nWingchi Edmund Kwok1,2\n\n1Department of Imaging Sciences, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States,2Rochester Center for Brain Imaging, Rochester, NY, United States\n\nUltrashort echo-time imaging has been explored for the study of short T2* tissues. Most ultrashort TE sequences utilize 3D radial center-out k-space sampling. While they are potentially useful for many important applications, they are susceptible to various image artifacts. This abstract describes the appearances, causes and mitigations of some potential artifacts, which include those caused by long readout length, high gradient field, insufficient number of radial projections, off-centered imaging and signal wrap-around. An understanding of these artifacts will help in protocol setting and the identification of related problems. This article should benefit the users of ultrashort TE imaging.\n\n1812.\n\nThe Harmonized Human Connectome Protocol for Multi-Site Brain MRI Studies\n\nJoshua M Kuperman1, Nathan S White1, Hauke Bartsch1, Matthew Middione2, Kun Lu3, Thomas Liu3, Terry Jernigan4, Ajit Shankaranarayanan2, and Anders M Dale1,5\n\n1Radiology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States,2GE Healthcare, Menlo Park, CA, United States,3Center for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States,4Center for Human Development, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States,5Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States\n\nThe benefits of the advanced MRI protocols used in the Human Connectome Project have heretofore only been available on Siemens MRI scanners. We have designed a Connectome-like protocol, called the Harmonized Human Connectome Protocol, which can utilize MRI scanners from additional vendors, specifically GE and Philips. This protocol is particularly relevant for the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study, which aims to scan over 10,000 children ages 9-10 and follow them longitudinally for ten years. This abstract details the protocol for the GE MR750 scanner and outlines calibration and correction procedures which can be used to further reduce unwanted site/scanner effects.\n\n1813.\n\nRetrospective self-gated 3D UTE MRI in the mouse lung\n\nJinbang Guo1,2, Xuefeng Cao1,3, Zackary I. Cleveland1, and Jason C. Woods1,2\n\n1Center for Pulmonary Imaging Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States,2Physics, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, United States,3Department of Physics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, United States\n\nMotion due to respiration is one of the major difficulties in lung imaging of mice, which have a 10-20-fold higher respiratory rate than humans. In this study, we demonstrate that the FID signal amplitude (k = 0) as a function of projection number in center-out radial 3D UTE reflects respiratory motion. Retrospective \"self\"-gating using this FID signal amplitude was applied to extract data for end-expiration and end-inspiration respectively. Quantitative analysis of tidal volumes and lung parenchymal signal match external measurements and physiological expectations.\n\n1814.\n\nHighly-efficient free breathing whole heart CINE MRI with self gated 3D CASPR-TIGER trajectory\n\nMuhammad Usman1, Gastao Cruz1, and Claudia Prieto1\n\n1Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, London, United Kingdom\n\nIn this work, we propose to use a novel free-running self-gated 3D CArtesian acquisition with Spiral PRofile ordering and TIny Golden angle step for Eddy Current Reduction, so called CASPR-TIGER. Data is acquired continuously under free breathing (no ECG gating, no pre-pulses interruption) using CASPR-TIGER trajectory and 4D volumes (3D+time) are reconstructed from all available data (100% respiratory scan efficiency) using a soft gating technique combined with temporal total variational (TV) constrained iterative SENSE reconstruction. Feasibility of proposed method is demonstrated in three subjects in a 3-3.6 minutes free breathing acquisition.\n\n1815.\n\n4D flow MRI of the cardiovascular system in small animals at 7T with an Ultrashort TE sequence combined with an injection of iron nanoparticle\n\nAurelien J Trotier1, Charles R CASTETS1, William LEFRANCOIS1, Emeline J RIBOT1, Eric THIAUDIERE1, Jean-Michel FRANCONI1, and Sylvain MIRAUX1\n\n1RMSB-UMR5536, CNRS - Universit� de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France\n\n4D flow MRI on mouse models remains very difficult due to the very small size of vessels and the extremely high cardiac rhythm. To overcome this problem a 3D time-resolved Phase Contrast UTE sequence was combined with an injection of Ultra Small Particles of Iron Oxide to obtain a positive and high signal in blood. The method was exploited to quantify blood flow velocity of the cardiovascular system in mice with a high spatial (200 �m)3 and temporal resolution (16ms). The total acquisition can be reduced to 25min by limiting the number of acquired projections per cine image.\n\n1816.\n\nMotion-correction enabled ultra-high resolution in-vivo imaging of the human brain at 7T\n\nDaniel Gallichan1\n\n1CIBM, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nWe extended previous work using 3D-FatNavs to enable motion-correction of ultra-high resolution structural acquisitions, including T1-, T2- and T2*-weighted images. Images are of exceptional quality and detail for in-vivo acquisitions.\n\n1817.\n\nQuadra-FSE: A Multi-Platform Pulse Sequence for Multispectral qMRI (PD, T1, T2)\n\nHernan Jara1, Arnaud Guidon2, Jorge A Soto1, and Osamu Sakai1\n\n1Radiology, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States,2Global MR Applications and Workflow, GE Healthcare, Boston, MA, United States\n\nPurpose: To describe the quadra fast spin-echo (quadra-FSE) pulse sequence, which is the concatenation of two dual-echo FSE acquisitions differing only in TR and to describe the matching qMRI algorithms for mapping T1, T2, and PD. Methods: quadra-FSE was tested at 3T with a multi-compartment agarose phantom and relaxometry was compared to gold standard relaxometry scans using qMRI algorithms developed in house. Results: PD, T1, and T2 maps generated with the quadra-FSE scans are accurate and of excellent image quality. Conclusion: Concatenation of two DE-FSE scans with different TRs can be used for combined and accurate PD, T1, and T2 mapping.\n\n1818.\n\nOptimized Parametric Variable Radius Sampling Scheme for 3D Cartesian k-Space Undersampling Pattern Design\n\nZechen Zhou1, Shuo Chen1, Aiqi Sun1, Yunduo Li1, Rui Li1, and Chun Yuan1,2\n\n1Center for Biomedical Imaging Research, Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, People's Republic of,2Vascular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States\n\nA parametric variable radius sampling scheme termed Cartesian Under-Sampling with Target Ordering Method (CUSTOM) was introduced for undersampling pattern design to better match the total number of sampling points with the given acceleration factor in 3D Cartesian imaging application. With the same joint parallel imaging and compressed sensing image reconstruction method, parameter optimized CUSTOM has demonstrated its enhanced performance particularly for detail image information restoration in comparison to several undersampling pattern design schemes, as well as its generalization ability in different applications. The prospective experiment validated the feasibility of CUSTOM in clinical settings.\n\n1819.\n\nQuiet EPI (QuEPI) for single-shot spin and gradient echo EPI sequences for efficient fetal imaging\n\nJana Maria Hutter1, Anthony N Price1, Lucilio Cordero Grande1, Emer Judith Hughes1, Kelly Pegoretti1, Andreia Oliveira Gaspar1, Laura McCabe1, Mary Rutherford1, and Joseph V Hajnal1\n\n1Centre for the developing brain, King's College London, London, United Kingdom\n\nQuiet sequences are of particular importance for fetal EPI based imaging, where the necessary protection of the unborn infant can often compromise the efficiency and achievable resolution of the EPI acquisition. This is of particular relevance for connectome type studies, where long functional and diffusion weighted sequences need to be acquired in an efficient and safe way.This abstract presents a quiet SE and GE EPI framework with sinusoidal read-out constant phase and merged crusher strategy, completely flexible and adaptable to the scanner impulse response function leading to a decrease of up to 9dB(A).\n\n1820.\n\nReadout Segmentation for Increased Spectral Bandwidth in High Spatial and Spectral Resolution (HiSS) MRI\n\nDavid Andrew Porter1 and Marco Vicari1\n\n1Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany\n\nA novel method of echo-planar spectroscopic imaging is introduced, in which readout segmentation is used to reduce the echo spacing and provide a substantial increase in spectral bandwidth. Results are presented, showing how the technique avoids the aliasing problems that affect conventional applications of high-resolution, spectroscopic imaging at 3T and serves as a robust method for providing spectrally-selective fat and water images. The method is also a promising option for high-bandwidth, spectroscopic imaging studies of metabolites at high field strengths.\n\n1821.\n\nMulti-blade Acquisition of Split Turbo Spin Echoes: A Robust and Fast Diffusion Imaging Technique\n\nKun Zhou1 and Wei Liu1\n\n1Siemens Shenzhen Magnetic Resonance Ltd., Shenzhen, China, People's Republic of\n\nA turbo spin echo based sequence for robust and fast diffusion imaging is proposed. It overcomes the non-CPMG problem by split-echo acquisition of turbo spin echo signals. EPI-like readout is used to sample the separated echoes and generate multiple blades for a single k-space. Each blade was corrected for both the inherent phase of separated echoes and off-resonance phase, to avoid the destructive inference. With this technique, the non-CPMG problem can be effectively mitigated at low flip angle refocusing pulses to reduce SAR. Moreover, the off-resonance artifacts can also be reduced especially when high acceleration factor is applied.\n\n1822.\n\nA New Approach for Flexible Spatial Encoding Strategy in a Low-Field MRI System\n\nJiasheng Su1 and Shaoying Huang1\n\n1EPD, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore, Singapore\n\nFor a low-field MRI system, the inverse calculation of the encoding matrix is time consuming and moreover, there is a blurry area at the center of the reconstructed image. To solve this problem, three strategies are proposed. Firstly, QR decomposition is applied to inverse the matrix to eliminate the blurry area. Secondly, the encoding matrix is separated so that the results of the matrix inverse can be reused. Last, the size of encoding matrix is reduced by optimizing sample points. One example is given, the calculation time is reduced, and the imaging quality is improved. The proposed approach increases the imaging capability of a low-field MRI system.\n\n1823.\n\nIn Vivo Feasibility of Multi-Parametric Mapping Based on Fast Steady-State Sequences\n\nLudovic de Rochefort1, Genevi�ve Guillot1, Rose-Marie Dubuisson1, and Romain Valabr�gue2\n\n1Imagerie par r�sonance magn�tique m�dicale et multi-modalit�s, IR4M, UMR 8081, CNRS-Universit� Paris-Sud, Universit� Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France,2CENIR, ICM, Inserm U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, Sorbonne Universit�s, UPMC Univ Paris 06 UMR S 1127F, Paris, France\n\nFast steady-state sequences combine RF and gradient spoiling to modulate contrasts in MRI. The steady-state depends on many physical and acquisition parameters. Here, in vivo feasibility on brain is shown to map proton density, background phase, flip angle, relaxation rates and apparent diffusion coefficient from such sequences. Multiple volumes were acquired with various optimized prescribed flip angle, spoiling gradients and phase increments, and the complex signal was fitted to the Bloch-Torrey signal model with free diffusion using efficient calculation algorithms. The acquisition of full 3D co-localized multi-parametric maps of relevant MR physical parameters in a realistic scan time is demonstrated.\n\n1824.\n\nDynamic pH quantification from spectrally selective 31P MRI in exercising skeletal muscle\n\nAlbrecht Ingo Schmid1,2, Martin Meyerspeer1,2, Simon Daniel Robinson2,3, Martin Krssak2,3,4, Michael Wolzt5, Ewald Moser1,2, and Ladislav Valkovic2,3\n\n1Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,2MR Centre of Excellence, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,3Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,4Department of Internal Medicine 3, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,5Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria\n\nMR spectroscopy provides valuable information about tissue metabolism but suffers from slow acquisition or poor spatial resolution and coverage. PCr and pH kinetics are the two important quantities derived from31P MR data. MRI has been used to measure PCr in the past, but not pH. Simultaneous fast 3-D gradient-echo images of PCr and Pi were acquired in healthy volunteers at 7T during exercise recovery. pH was calculated from phase images. Results of PCr and pH kinetics are comparable to MRS data. In conclusion,31P MRI is an alternative to31P MRS for fast coverage of multiple ROIs and low SAR.\n\n1825.\n\nAccelerated Imaging of the Mouse Body using k-space Segmentation, Cardio-Respiratory Synchronisation and Short, Constant TR: Application to b-SSFP.\n\nPaul Kinchesh1, Stuart Gilchrist1, Ana L Gomes1, Veerle Kersemans1, John Beech1, Danny Allen1, and Sean Smart1\n\n1Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom\n\nWe demonstrate that cardio-respiratory synchronisation can be achieved in conjunction with short TR scans and k-space segmentation to reduce imaging times to below that achievable using standard techniques such as retrospective gating. Our method is generally applicable to other short TR scan modes requiring cardio-respiratory synchronisation. Images of the mouse heart, lung and liver are presented for the b-SSPF scan mode.\n\n1826.\n\nRapid Multi-echo Ultrashort Time Echo Imaging for MR-based Attenuation Correction in PET/MR\n\nHyungseok Jang1,2 and Alan B McMillan1\n\n1Department of Radiology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States,2Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States\n\nAccurate MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) is necessary to enable quantitative PET imaging in PET/MR. Unfortunately, identification of bone via MR methods is technically challenging due to its short T2*. Thus, ultrashort time echo (UTE) techniques have been proposed. In this study, we explored rapid multi-echo frequency encoded UTE and ramped hybrid encoding (RHE) for UTE-based imaging schemes for MRAC with clinically feasible scan times (<35sec). By using an IDEAL-based signal model for long T2* suppression, multi-echo hybrid encoding UTE imaging performed better than frequency encoded UTE.\n\n1827.\n\nBanding-artifact free bSSFP cine imaging using a Geometric Solution approach\n\nAndr� Fischer1,2, Michael N. Hoff3, Piero Ghedin1,2,4, and Anja C.S. Brau2\n\n1GE Global Research, Garching bei M�nchen, Germany,2Cardiac Center of Excellence, GE Healthcare, Garching bei M�nchen, Germany,3Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States,4GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, United States\n\nBanding artifacts in bSSFP sequences pose a challenge in cardiac cine imaging, especially at 3.0T. Recently, a �Geometric Solution� (GS) which is capable of completely removing banding artifacts has been introduced and demonstrated in applications outside the heart. This work investigates the feasibility of extending GS to cardiac cine imaging at 3.0T and explores its potential to enable longer TRs than have conventionally been feasible with bSSFP, permitting sub-millimeter resolution cine imaging free of banding artifacts.\n\n1829.\n\nPhase-Encode Ghosting Detection using Multi-Channel Coil Arrays\n\nTom Hilbert1,2,3, Tobias Kober1,2,3, Jean-Philippe Thiran2,3, Reto Meuli2, and Gunnar Krueger2,3,4\n\n1Advanced Clinical Imaging Technology (HC CMEA SUI DI BM PI), Siemens Healthcare AG, Lausanne, Switzerland,2Department of Radiology, University Hospital (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland,3LTS5, �cole Polytechnique F�d�rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland,4Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Boston, MA, United States\n\nPhase-encode ghosting artifacts frequently occur in magnetic resonance imaging, especially in spin-echo sequence derivatives such as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. The appearance of these artifacts may cause misinterpretation as tissue pathology, e.g. a lesion. We propose an algorithm to automatically detect these artifacts by analyzing the consistency of the acquired k-space with respect to the assumption of GRAPPA that a k-space sample is a linear sum of its neighboring samples. The performance of the technique is shown in three volunteers. It may help to avoid potential misinterpretation in the future, both for radiological readers and automated post-processing algorithms.\n\n1828.\n\nMyelin Water Fraction with Bipolar Multiecho sequences using k-space shift correction\n\nHongpyo Lee1, Yoonho Nam2, Min-Oh Kim1, Dongyeob Han1, and Dong-Hyun Kim1\n\n1School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,2Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of\n\nRecently, myelin water fraction was investigated using multi-echo GRE data. Generally, to ensure phase consistency among the echoes, multi-echo acquisitions use unipolar gradients. However, these unipolar gradient multi-echo sequences reduce acquisition efficiency and increase echo spacing. Bipolar gradients would be preferential however, k-space misregistration induced by readout gradient delays and eddy-currents make phase errors, so severe artifacts occur in myelin water imaging. In this abstract, we present a MWI using bipolar gradient multi-echo GRE sequence with k-space shift correction. Compared to unipolar MWF, k-space shift corrected bipolar MWF yields a reduction in ΔTE, which leads to improved SNR and more accurate quantification.\n\n1830.\n\nQuantitative Temperature Imaging in Chemically Designed Phantoms\n\nScott D.

Anatomy that is outside of the imaging volume of interest but within the excitation volume can contribute to these artifacts. We used out-of-volume spatial saturation pulses to suppress these streaking artifacts with minimal scan time penalties. In-vivo acquisitions with spatial saturation showed equal or superior quality in all cases. They should be implemented whenever the additional SAR can be tolerated.\n\n1832.\n\nZigzag-Aligned-Projections in Echo-Planar Imaging\n\nPatrick Alexander Liebig1,2, Robin Martin Heidemann2, and David Andrew Porter3\n\n1Friedrich-Alexander-Universit�t Erlangen-N�rnberg, Erlangen, Germany,2Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany,3Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany\n\nA new approach to Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI) is introduced under the name Zigzag-Aligned-Projections (ZAP) that replaces the blipped phase-encoding (PE) gradient with the modulus of the readout (RO). This comes with two significant advantages: the reduction of acoustic noise due to the modified PE gradient and the higher efficiency due to continuous data sampling. ZAP EPI is the only EPI derivate that combines Cartesian GRAPPA using a fixed Kernel size with continuous data sampling. The reduction in acoustic noise was verified experimentally and volunteer images were acquired and processed with two reconstruction techniques.\n\n1833.\n\nA Dual Spin-Echo Technique with Hybrid Spiral Readouts for Fast Simultaneous Proton Density- and T2-Weighted Fat-Water Imaging\n\nZhiqiang Li1, Dinghui Wang1, John P Karis2, and James G Pipe1\n\n1Imaging Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States,2Neuroradiology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States\n\nTurbo spin-echo (TSE) provides rapid T2-weighted imaging with slightly altered contrast compared to Cartesian spin-echo (SE). A spiral SE technique has been proposed for fast T2-weighted imaging without degrading the T2 contrast. In this study a dual echo spiral SE with hybrid spiral readouts is developed to simultaneously provide both proton density and T2 contrast without increasing the scan time. Volunteer results from the spiral dual SE technique demonstrate similar contrast to conventional SE, with a scan speed faster than Cartesian mDixon TSE.\n\n1834.\n\nSpiral Time of Flight MRA with Dixon Water and Fat Separation\n\nNicholas R.

Pipe1\n\n1Imaging Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, United States\n\nTime of Flight MRA in the head and neck can benefit from Dixon fat signal removal. The spiral trajectory is used to speed up the acquisition allowing 3-echoes to be collected, for Dixon reconstruction, in less time than a conventional single echo (\"out-of-phase\") cartesian MRA.\n\n1835.\n\nTwo NSA or not two NSA: does perforator artery detection in white matter benefit from signal averaging?\n\nLennart Geurts1, Sander Brinkhof1, Peter R. Luijten1, and Jaco J.M. Zwanenburg1\n\n1Radiology, UMCU, Utrecht, Netherlands\n\nBecause cerebral perforating arteries have sub-millimeter diameters and slow blood flow velocities, their blood flow velocity and pulsatility measurements are challenging and limited by noise and partial volume effects. Our previously reported acquisition method used two signal averages (NSA) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that decreasing NSA, and thereby reducing scan time by half, has little effect on vessel detection. The NSA=1 coefficients of repeatability (CoR) found in this study are similar to previously published NSA=2 CoR`s. Subject motion and small vessel size likely play together to cause a sub-optimal benefit from increased imaging time.\n\n1836.\n\nQuantitative analysis of the volume and lipid content of liver and spleen using Dual-echo mDixon sequence and T2WI-STIR sequences in child and adolescent patients with gaucher disease\n\nXiaojuan TAO1, Yun PENG1, Yanqiu LV1, and Kaining SHI2\n\n1Imaging Center of Beijing Children's Hospital Affiliated To Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, People's Republic of,2Imaging Systems Clinical Science Philips Healthcare, Beijing, China, People's Republic of\n\nSpleen and liver are common organs involved in Gaucher disease (GD), while few reports have been published on the measurement of volume and lipid content of liver and spleen using MR. This study recruited 42 patients with GD by 1.5T MR. Our results showed that enlargement of spleen was more severe than liver. Spleen has higher lipid content than liver among these patients, while both of them exhibited higher fat fraction than normal value. Our study suggests MRI can be employed to monitor the disease progression and effect of the treatment in children and adolescent patients with GD.\n\n1837.\n\nExploring sodium SSFP MRI in phantoms at 3 Tesla\n\nRahel Heule1,2, Philipp Mad�rin1,2, and Oliver Bieri1,2\n\n1Division of Radiological Physics, Department of Radiology, University of Basel Hospital, Basel, Switzerland,2Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland\n\nWhile the steady-state free precession (SSFP) dynamics of spin-1/2 nuclei such as1H obey the Bloch equations, a similar mathematical framework for describing and understanding the characteristics of23Na SSFP signal behavior is not yet available. In this work, sodium MRI probes were investigated and, in particular, a novel class of phantoms was presented that proved the ability to generate high sodium signal at 3 Tesla without impairment due to the skin effect. By means of balanced SSFP frequency profile measurements, the potential of the novel phantoms to explore23Na SSFP was demonstrated.\n\n1838.\n\nArtifact reduction of dental implants on high resolution MR imaging\n\nTim Hilgenfeld1, Alexander Heil1, Sebastian Schwindling2, David Grodzki3, Mathias Nittka3, Daniel Gareis4, Peter Rammelsberg2, Martin Bendszus1, Sabine Heiland1, and Marcel Prager1\n\n1Division of Neuroradiology, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,2Division of Prosthodontics, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,3Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany,4NORAS MRI products GmbH, H�chberg, Germany\n\nDental MRI is a new technique which is often impaired by artifacts due to metallic dental implants. Several MRI sequences were developed to reduce susceptibility artifacts (e.g. for orthopaedic implants). Here, we for the first time systematically evaluated MR sequences for artifact reduction in dental implants. Smallest artifact volume was measured for 2D-TSE sequences. Since imaging of dental structures benefit from high resolution and possibility of 3D reconstructions 3D sequences are advantageous. Significant artifact reduction was noted for SPC-WARP measuring only 2.1 times artifact volume of TSE sequence instead of 4.8 times when using standard SPC sequence.\n\n1839.\n\nReal-time diaphragm navigation using reflected power measurements from a multiple channel transmit RF coil on a human 7T\n\nAaron T Hess1, Christopher T Rodgers1, and Matthew D Robson1\n\n1OCMR, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom\n\nThe reflected power of transmit RF coils is influenced by the position of the diaphragm. In this work the diaphragm position is measured in real-time for every RF pulse with a hybrid approach. The set of reflection coefficients are transformed into a diaphragm position using a series of MR diaphragm navigators at the start of the pulse sequence in a learning cycle. We demonstrate high quality respiratory gated data based on gating via this mechanism using standard SAR monitoring hardware with a real-time lag of 23ms and temporal resolution of 4.5ms.\n\n1840.\n\nTowards robust c-spine imaging with Cartesian sampling\n\nGuobin Li1, Zhaopeng Li1, Chaohong Wang1, Yang Xin1, Shuheng Zhang1, Weijun Zhang1, Xiaodong Zhou1, and Weiguo Zhang1\n\n1Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China, People's Republic of\n\nC-spine imaging is demanding due to artifacts from CSF flow, patient�s swallowing etc., especially in FSE sequence with inversion recovery. By increasing the excitation thickness in FSE sequence, two concomitant saturation bands are realized at both sides of each image slice, which suppress the moving CSF. Furthermore, a snapshot k-space ordering is proposed to further improve the stability of c-spine imaging against irregular flow of CSF and patient�s bulk motion.\n\n1841.\n\nRapid and continuous respiratory motion-resolved abdominal MRI using 3D golden-angle spiral projection acquisition\n\nMootaz Eldib1, Li Feng2, Daniel K Sodickson2, Zahi A Fayad1, and Hadrien A Dyvorne1\n\n1Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute, Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States,2Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R), Bernard and Irene Schwartz Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States\n\nWe propose a novel acquisition technique for motion-resolved abdominal imaging. Using a golden angle spiral projection trajectory, we were able to acquire reliable physiologic tracking data while acquiring 3D isotropic resolution images of the entire upper abdomen, resulting in an efficient self-gated sequence. We show that respiratory motion can be fully characterized in vivo in a minute-long 1.8 mm isotropic acquisition, which is suitable for applications such as PET/MR motion correction.\n\n1842.\n\nA Nonrigid-Motion-Correction Method for Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography Using 3D Image-based Navigators\n\nJieying Luo1, Nii Okai Addy1, R. Reeve Ingle1, Corey A. Baron1, Joseph Y. Cheng1, Bob S. Hu1,2, and Dwight G. Nishimura1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Palo Alto, CA, United States\n\n3D image-based navigators (iNAVs) offer the potential to achieve more complete motion correction for coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA). In this work, we develop a method for 3D-iNAV processing to achieve nonrigid motion correction. Both global and localized motion trajectories are extracted from the 3D iNAVs and used to generate candidate motion-corrected images for an autofocus method. Two sets of localized motion trajectories are obtained from deformation fields between 3D iNAVs and reconstructed binned images respectively. Results with this method on whole-heart 3D cones CMRA scans demonstrated improved vessel sharpness as compared to 3D translational motion correction.\n\n1843.\n\nEvaluation of motion patterns and their effect on image quality in pediatric populations\n\nOnur Afacan1, Burak Erem1, Diona P. Roby1, Noam Roth2, Amir Roth2, Sanjay P. Prabhu1, and Simon K. Warfield1\n\n1Radiology, Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States,2Robin Medical Inc., Baltimore, MD, United States\n\nIn this work we report results from a large pediatric study that shows the effect of motion. Motion patterns were measured on 82 children, mean age 13.4 years, in a T1 weighted brain MRI. An expert radiologist graded the images using a 4-point scale ranging from clinically non-diagnostic to no motion artifacts. We used these grades to correlate motion parameters such as maximum motion, mean displacement from a reference point and motion free time. The results will help the motion correction community in better understanding motion patterns in pediatric populations and how it effects image quality.\n\n1844.\n\nProspective Motion Correction in Diffusion Tensor Imaging using Intermediate Pseudo-Trace-Weighted Images\n\nDaniel Christopher Hoinkiss1, Matthias Guenther1, and David Andrew Porter1\n\n1MR Physics, Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany\n\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging is frequently affected by long-term subject motion. Intermediate pseudo-trace-weighted images enable a real-time image registration with low sensitivity to contrast variation between diffusion-weighted images. These registration results are used to correct the imaging parameters of the ongoing scan. The algorithm was evaluated on three individual subjects using a dedicated diffusion-weighted imaging sequence. The prospective motion correction was able to reduce the typical long-term motion to a band of approximately �0.2mm for translational and �0.2� for rotational motion, which is far below voxel size, without increasing the total scan time or changing the set of diffusion vectors.\n\n1845.\n\nImage Reconstruction System for Compressed Sensing Retrospective Motion Correction for the Application in Clinical Practice\n\nMartin Schwartz1,2, Thomas K�stner1,2, Christian W�rslin1, Petros Martirosian1, Nina F. Schwenzer3, Fritz Schick1, Bin Yang2, and Holger Schmidt3\n\n1Section on Experimental Radiology, Department of Radiology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany,2Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany,3Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Department of Radiology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany\n\nRespiratory motion-free images are important in MRI of the human thorax and abdomen. A significant factor is the reconstruction of these images for the application in clinical practice. The objective of the presented work is an integration of an approved motion correction algorithm into the clinical environment to overcome limitations of offline reconstructed images by the utilization of external workstations. Therefore, a reconstruction pipeline based on the open-source framework Gadgetron with new modules for the integration of a motion correction algorithm is demonstrated.\n\n1848.\n\nAutofocusing-based correction of B0 fluctuation-induced ghosting\n\nAlexander Loktyushin1,2, Philipp Ehses1, Bernhard Sch�lkopf2, and Klaus Scheffler1,3\n\n1High-field Magnetic Resonance, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, T�bingen, Germany,2Empirical Inference, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T�bingen, Germany,3Biomedical Magnetic Resonance, University of T�bingen, T�bingen, Germany\n\nLong-TE gradient-echo images are prone to ghosting artifacts. Such degradation is primarily due to magnetic field variations caused by breathing or motion. The effect of these fluctuations amounts to different phase offsets in each acquired k-space line. A common remedy is to measure the problematic phase offsets using an extra non-phase-encoded scan before or after each imaging readout. In this work, we attempt to estimate the phase offsets directly from the raw image data by optimization-based search of phases that minimize an image distortion measure. This eliminates the need for any sequence modifications and additional scan time.\n\n1850.\n\nA qualitative and quantitative comparision of virtual template based registration methods to control motion in DCE-MRI\n\nIsabella Radl1, Stephen Keeling2, and Rudolf Stollberger1,3\n\n1Institute of Medical Engineering, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria,2Institute for Mathematics and Scientific Computing, Karl Franzens University of Graz, Graz, Austria,3BioTechMed Graz, Graz, Austria\n\nDifferent applications in DCE-MRI suffer from inter-frame misalignment due to physiological motion, which has to be compensated for further analysis of functional parameters. Conventional motion correction methods are usually unable to register images with simultaneous changes of contrast and morphology. Virtual-template based registration overcomes this problem by iteratively generating a motion-less image series with the contrast behaviour of the original DCE data as registration targets. We investigated different methods to generate these virtual-templates and identified Independent Component Analysis as best approach among the investigated techniques. Results were validated on a synthetic kidney phantom and in-vivo myocardial perfusion MRI.\n\n1851.\n\nThree dimensional retrospective motion correction using spherical navigator echoes\n\nPatricia M Johnson1,2, Junmin Liu1, Trevor Wade1, and Maria Drangova1,2\n\n1Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada,2Department of Medical Biophysics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, London, ON, Canada\n\nSpherical navigators are k-space navigators that can measure 6-degree of freedom rigid-body motion. Recent developments have reduced processing and baseline acquisition time, making the technique a promising tool for motion correction. This work represents the first time SNAVs have been incorporated into an image sequence and demonstrated for motion correction. SNAVs were incorporated into a gradient echo sequence; this navigated sequence was used to scan 3 volunteers performing directed head motion. The motion-degraded brain images were then retrospectively corrected using the SNAV derived motion parameters. In all cases excellent correction of motion artifacts was observed.\n\n1852.\n\nAnalysis of Motion and Eddy Currents with 3D Cones Reordering for Whole-Heart Coronary MR Angiography\n\nMario O. Malav�1, Nii Okai Addy1, R. Reeve Ingle1, Joseph Y. Cheng1, Corey A. Baron1, and Dwight G. Nishimura1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States\n\nMotion and eddy current artifacts were investigated with simulations, metric measures, and in vivo scans for three different cone acquisition schemes: sequential, multidimensional golden means (MDGM), and phyllotaxis readout orderings. We demonstrate the idea of using the 3D cones phyllotaxis acquisition method for improved motion behavior and low eddy current susceptibility. Also, the sequential ordering method is shown to be more susceptible to motion artifacts while the MDGM introduces eddy current artifacts. When using the phyllotaxis design, the reconstruction demonstrates that a more spread out k-space traversal per heartbeat is more robust to motion and can be obtained without introducing eddy currents.\n\n1853.\n\nRobust Self-Gated Free-Breathing 3D Cardiac MRI Using DC Signals and Virtual Coils\n\nXinwei Shi1,2, Joseph Y Cheng1,2, Michael Lustig3, John M Pauly2, and Shreyas S Vasanawala1\n\n1Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,3Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States\n\nIn cardiac MRI, self-gating using the DC signal provides a promising alternative to EKG gating. However, the DC signal is often affected by other moving structures in the FOV, such as the liver, which degrades the accuracy of the extracted cardiac triggers. In this work, we demonstrate the use of virtual coils to focus the DC signal on cardiac motion and to provide a robust and generalized self-gating approach for 3D cardiac MRI. In free-breathing 4D-Flow scans of pediatric subjects, the proposed method improved the accuracy of self-gating triggers, and the self-gated images showed comparable quality with EKG gated reference.\n\n1854.\n\nConcomitant and seamless saturation bands for suppressing flow artifacts in FSE sequences\n\nGuobin Li1, Zhaopeng Li1, Chaohong Wang1, Yang Xin1, Weijun Zhang1, Xiaodong Zhou1, and Weiguo Zhang1\n\n1Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China, People's Republic of\n\nTo reduce pulsatile artifacts of blood flow in FSE imaging, a combined solution is proposed, in which two concomitant saturation bands are achieved at both side of each slice without any extra RF pulses and gradients. Furthermore, through a proper setting of slice acquisition order, flowing blood can be continuously and seamlessly saturated in multi-slice acquisition.\n\n1855.\n\nComparison of respiratory navigator-gating techniques in two-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence\n\nHirofumi Hata1, Yusuke Inoue2, Ai Nakajima1, Shotaro Komi1, Yutaka Abe1, Keiji Matsunaga2, and Hiroki Miyatake1\n\n1Department of Radiology, Kitasato University Hospital, Sagamihara, Japan,2Department of Diagnositic Radiology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan\n\nWe compared navigator-gating techniques for free-breathing 2D SPGR images of the liver using pencil-beam excitation and self-navigation techniques in 3 T MRI. In pencil-beam navigator, single-check (PB-SC) and double-check (PB-DC) modes were examined. In self-navigator scans, self-navigator signals were acquired in two fashions; before (SN-Pre) or after (SN-Post) the imaging read-out. Visual analysis shows that respiratory waveforms fluctuated in SN-Post. Quantitative and qualitative image evaluations show that PB-DC and SN-Post had better image qualities than the others. Considering scan time was about doubled in SN-Post, PB-DC should be the best for respiratory navigation in 2D SPGR imaging at this stage.\n\n1856.\n\nSilent Navigator with Whole Volume Excitation\n\nYuji Iwadate1, Atsushi Nozaki1, Yoshinobu Nunokawa2, Shigeo Okuda3, Masahiro Jinzaki3, and Hiroyuki Kabasawa1\n\n1Global MR Applications and Workflow, GE Healthcare Japan, Hino, Tokyo, Japan,2Department of Radiation Technology, Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,3Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan\n\nThe conventional pencil-beam navigator suffers from large acoustic noise due to oscillating gradient pulses during RF excitation. We developed a silent navigator technique with whole volume excitation (vNav). The vNav technique reduced acoustic noise to almost the same level as background. In volunteer scan, a waveform of vNav was well correlated with the bellows signal, and motion reduction was demonstrated in 3D-SPGR imaging. The vNav integration into the silent imaging sequence should be examined in the next step.\n\n1857.\n\nAuto-Calibrating Wave-CS for Motion-Robust Accelerated MRI\n\nFeiyu Chen1, Tao Zhang1,2, Joseph Y. Cheng1,2, John M. Pauly1, and Shreyas S. Vasanawala2\n\n1Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States\n\nIn this work, we propose a motion-robust auto-calibrating Wave-CS technique. This technique uses the wave-encoded center k-space and the known point-spread-function (PSF) of wave-encoding to reconstruct a Cartesian central k-space for calibration. The coil sensitivity maps are subsequently estimated with ESPIRiT for CS-SENSE reconstruction of under-sampled k-spaces. Results show this approach can reduce the motion artifacts and the aliasing artifacts due to sensitivity variations between the calibration and accelerated wave-encoded acquisitions.\n\n1858.\n\nTowards Markerless Optical Tracking for Prospective Motion Correction in Brain Imaging\n\nJulian Maclaren1, Andre Kyme2,3, Murat Aksoy1, and Roland Bammer1\n\n1Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, United States,3Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia\n\nProspective motion correction based on optical tracking shows promise for improving image quality in MR brain imaging. To simplify this technique and expedite clinical deployment, it is desirable to avoid attaching markers to the patient�s head. Here we demonstrate proof-of-principle markerless tracking using an MR-compatible stereo camera and head coil configuration. We tested the method outside the MR environment using a 6-axis robot, capable of very accurate and repeatable (~20 �m) motion, to control a head phantom. Close agreement between our pose estimates and the applied motion suggests that accurate markerless tracking of the head is feasible in MRI.\n\n1859.\n\nReduction of Through-Plane Flow Artifacts in Contrast-Enhanced Liver MRI Using Motion-Sensitized Driven-Equilibrium (MSDE): Comparison of MSDE types\n\nSeiichiro Noda1, Nobuyuki Toyonari1, Yukari Horino1, Masami Yoneyama2, and Kazuhiro Katahira1\n\n1Kumamoto Chuo Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan,2Philips Electronics Japan, Tokyo, Japan\n\nGadoxetic acid enhanced mDIXON liver MRI has excellent utility for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma; however, it often suffers from ghosting flow artifacts from aorta due to increased signal by contrast enhancement. To solve this problem, we attempt to use motion-sensitized driven-equilibrium (MSDE) for reducing through-plane flow artifacts particularly in dynamic contrast-enhanced studies. We showed the effect of MSDE in reducing through-plane flow artifacts particularly in dynamic contrast-enhanced studies. Two types MSDE schemes (MSDE and iMSDE) could significantly decrease flow signals and could therefore reduce flow artifacts sufficiently. In current sequence, iMSDE would be better for clinical studies because of its less sensitivity to field inhomogeneities.\n\n1860.\n\nReal Time MRI Motion Correction with Markerless Tracking\n\nClaus Benjaminsen1, Rasmus Ramsb�l Jensen1, Paul Wighton2, M. Dylan Tisdall2, Helle Hjorth Johannesen3, Ian Law3, Andre J. W. van der Kouwe2, and Oline Vinter Olesen1\n\n1DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark,2Athinoula. A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Dept. of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States,3Department of Clinical Physiology, Nuclear Medicine & PET, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nProspective motion correction for MRI neuroimaging has been demonstrated using MR navigators and external tracking systems using markers. The drawbacks of these two motion estimation methods include prolonged scan time plus lack of compatibility with all image acquisitions, and difficulties validating marker attachment resulting in uncertain estimation of the brain motion respectively. We have developed a markerless tracking system, and in this work we demonstrate the use of our system for prospective motion correction, and show that despite being computationally demanding, markerless tracking can be implemented for real time motion correction.\n\n1861.\n\nHigh-speed, contact-free measurement of the photoplethysmography waveform for MRI triggering\n\nNicolai Spicher1, Stefan Maderwald2, Mark E. Ladd2,3, and Markus Kukuk1\n\n1University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany,2Erwin L. Hahn Institute for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany,3Division of Medical Physics in Radiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nVideos of the human skin exhibit a subtle photoplethysmography signal, which resembles the one measured by pulse oximetry. It was investigated whether the whole photoplethysmography waveform (systolic/diastolic peak, dicrotic notch) can be extracted from two MR-compatible video cameras: A low-speed camera (30 frames-per-second) and a high-speed prototype (250 frames-per-second). We propose a potentially real-time feasible algorithm for signal filtering, which was applied to frames of both cameras. Using pulse oximetry as ground truth, revealed all features of the photoplethysmography waveform. Additionally, performing systolic peak detection showed that the high-speed camera allows for more accurate results in MRI pulse triggering.\n\n1863.\n\nAuto-calibrated Iterative SENSE Reconstruction with Rejection of Inconsistent Data\n\nTim Nielsen1 and Peter B�rnert1\n\n1Philips Research, Hamburg, Germany\n\nWe present a reconstruction method to correct retrospectively for motion artifacts. The method identifies which part of the data set is affected by motion based on redundancy which is typically present in a multi-coil data set. No prior knowledge about coil sensitivity maps is needed. Instead, this information is directly estimated from the data along with the motion corrected image.\n\n1847.\n\nAn MR Motion Correction toolbox for registration and evaluation\n\nThomas K�stner1,2, Verena Neumann2, Martin Schwartz1,2, Christian W�rslin1,3, Petros Martirosian1, Sergios Gatidis1, Nina F.

For retrospective motion correction, there is often an image-based registration involved. Hence, the extraction of a reliable and accurate motion model for the underlying application is mainly dependent on the chosen image registration procedure. There are several different image registration methods available, but visualization and evaluation of the derived displacement fields and transformed images often remains an open topic. In the spirit of a reproducible research and for streamlining and simplifying the process, we provide GUIs and evaluation methods to perform and analyze image registration techniques which will be made publicly available.\n\n1862.\n\nA robust motion correction tool for cardiac extracellular volume mapping\n\nShufang Liu1,2,3, Lin Zhang3,4, Pauline Ferry3,4, Andrei Codreanu5, Anne Menini2, and Freddy Odille3,4\n\n1Institut f�r Informatik, Technology University of Munich, Munich, Germany,2GE Global Research, Munich, Germany,3Imagerie Adaptative Diagnostique et Interventionnelle, Universit� de Lorraine, Nancy, France,4U947, INSERM, Nancy, France,5Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg\n\nThis work present a robust motion correction framework for T1 mapping and ECV mapping. Motion correction within one series and between different series are discussed. Validation is performed on 2 patient data and 6 volunteer data.\n\n1846.\n\nBrain pulsatility across the cardiac cycle revealed by cine 3D integrated-SSFP\n\nLirong Yan1, Mayank Jog1, Kay Jann1, Xingfeng Shao1, and Danny JJ Wang1\n\n1Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States\n\nThe alternations of brain pulsatility are related to various pathological changes such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and brain tumor. In the present study, we introduced a new MRI approach to assess the brain�s biomechanical features using ECG-gated cine 3D integrated-SSFP, which offers dynamic 3D brain volumes with high spatial resolution. The voxel-wise deformation was derived from jacobian maps over the cardiac cycle. We found that greater deformation in the brain occurs in basal ganglia and brain stem, and then attenuates toward the white matter and brain cortex during the cardiac cycle.\n\n1849.\n\nTArgeted Motion Estimation and Reduction (TAMER): Data Consistency Based Motion Mitigation using a Reduced Model Joint Optimization\n\nMelissa Haskell1,2, Stephen Cauley1,3, and Lawrence Wald1,3,4\n\n1Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, MGH/HST, Charlestown, MA, United States,2Graduate Program in Biophysics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States,3Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States,4Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States\n\nWe approach the reconstruction of artifact-free images from an object undergoing unknown rigid-body transformations using a joint optimization of the final uncorrupted image and motion parameters. To characterize motion, the joint optimization must estimate 6 additional parameters for each shot in the image acquisition. We demonstrate an efficient method for reconstruction from translation-corrupted kspace data by examining iterative improvements to only a small, targeted subset of imaging voxels. The method can be enhanced by providing incomplete or noisy information from motion sensors or navigator measurements. We discuss generalizing our hybrid greedy and global step non-linear optimization to full rigid-body motion.\n\n1864.\n\nPCA-aided improvements on FID-based motion tracking calibrated on resting-state EPI data without intentional motion\n\nR�diger Stirnberg1, Daniel Brenner1, Willem Huijbers1, Tobias Kober2,3,4, and Tony St�cker1,5\n\n1German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany,2Advanced Clinical Imaging Technology, Siemens Healthcare, Lausanne, Switzerland,3Department of Radiology, University Hospital Lausanne (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland,4Department of Electrical Engineering (LTS5), Ecole Polytechnique F�d�rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland,5Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany\n\nAccurate and precise head motion tracking has been shown to be feasible using multi-channel free-induction-decay (FID) signals, where positional information is supported by the spatial distribution of the receive coils. Until now, this required subject-specific calibration using simultaneously acquired FID signals and reference motion parameters, e.g. from an external device, while the subject performs controlled motion. In this study, we demonstrate successful calibration of FID navigators using motion parameters extracted from a resting-state fMRI scan without intentional motion. Additionally, extension of the calibration by principal component analysis of the FID data is shown to increase motion prediction accuracy and precision.\n\n1865.\n\nRobust prospective motion correction using virtual marker tracking\n\nNiklas Wehkamp1, Benjamin Richard Knowles1, Patrick Hucker1, and Maxim Zaitsev1\n\n1Department of Radiology - Medical Physics, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n\nMarker fixation remains an unresolved issue in Prospective Motion Correction (PMC) using optical tracking. The most common and simple approach to track motion of the skull is using markers adhered to the face.
