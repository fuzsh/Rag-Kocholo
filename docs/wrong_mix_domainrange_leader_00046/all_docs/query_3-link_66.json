        "text": "This study has assessed dairy production and constraints facing the rural dairy producer in Ezha districts of Gurage zone, southern Ethiopia. Formal survey was used to collect data from four kebeles in the district, which were selected from two agro-ecological zones namely, Dega and Woina Dega. A total of 120 respondents (60 from each agro-ecology) that have at least one local milking cow were randomly selected. Mixed crop-livestock production system was found to be the feature of farming system. The major feed includes natural grazing, cereal crop residue and Ensete-ventricosum. Cut and carry feeding systems were employed by the majority of the interviewed households (72%). The overall average daily milk production per cow per household, lactation length and calving interval were 1.83±0.08 liter, 10.6.87±0.2 and 24.03±0.4 months, respectively. However, the overall daily milk yield, calving interval and lactation length were not significantly differing between agro-ecologies. Among milk and milk product produced, only butter and Ayib were supplied to local markets. The sale of fresh whole milk was not a common practice, due to, inefficient milk production (78.3%) and cultural restrictions toward selling fresh whole milk (53.3%) followed by lack of market (20%). Lack of land (45%), shortage of feeds (41%), artificial insemination (AI) services (10%) were reported to be the major constraints to the milk production in the study area. In order to alleviate the aforementioned constraints increasing efficiency of AI services, improvement of veterinary services, introduction of improved forage crops and fodder trees are important."
