        "text": "“How do you propose to gain this freedom?”\n\n“By the only means left to us. Revolution.”\n\n“But it’s doomed to failure!”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n“And you’ll keep trying?”\n\n“You, above everyone else should understand, we cannot be free until we have power. How else can we achieve it?”\n\nIf you were to tell me this conversation takes place in some drama about race relations and oppression in America, you’d be half right. This back and forth happens in a pivotal scene from 1972’s Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, the fourth flick in the series a lot of the world Rip Van Winkle’d at the time and even today, not everyone has caught up to it.\n\nWhile the Planet of the Apes series was reborn and given a serious shot of HGH in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes and movie theaters will surely be packed this weekend for War for the Planet of the Apes, it’s important to look back and realize the movie series about walking, talking primates didn’t just become packed with social commentary this decade.\n\nSince its inception in 1968, the movies have sought to challenge, push, poke, and prod a society the filmmakers didn’t think would last long. But none of them would be or have been as provoking as Conquest.\n\nWhat’s crazy is how more than 40 years later, it’s just as relevant for the black community as it was during the time or riots, the Black Panthers, and a fight for equality.\n\nConquest was partially inspired by the Watts riots of 1965, illustrating what happens when years of oppression gives birth to an outburst. The apes are put on slave auction blocks, given names, whipped, demeaned, and sectioned off in their own part of the city in living quarters you wouldn’t touch with the thing used to touch 10-foot-poles. While the imagery calls to mind Nazi fascism, the connection to modern America at the time is undeniable. And if you tried to deny, that exchange at the top of this article between Caesar — the head ape — and Hari Rhodes’ MacDonald — the sole black character — is the argument against your objection.\n\nPaul Dehn’s script examines the volatility of a society on the brink, much like George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. Both flicks put a microscope on an older society stuck in its ways based on fear, greed, and a lust for power. In Conquest, the knowledge of a future where the Apes take over and humans are enslaved drives every single action. Even in side comments, like when the resident bad guy remarks that Caesar— who picked his own name by the way — isn’t as smart as people think because he can’t pour a glass of water without making a mess. This prompts MacDonald to hit him with this:\n\n“No, but then brightness has never been encouraged among slaves.”\n\nNot one to traffic in subtlety, that Paul Dehn.\n\nThe parallels are strong as the movie often switches between MacDonald’s point of view and Caesar’s; how a black man sees this world doing to Caesar what they once did to him and are still doing to him in some respect. The white police officers begrudgingly respect him only because they have to, but their body language makes it clear as crystal if he weren’t as high on the totem pole as he is, there would be a billy club with his name on it. I guess that would make it a MacDonald club, which doesn’t quite have the same ring to it but you get the point. Much like Caesar, he’s ascended above the fray because he’s “gifted.” Ironically, in a world that rewards those of us who “speak so well,” Caesar is punished and feared simply because he can speak. Gotta imagine it was the same for us the minute it was discovered we could form complete sentences or yelled “no” to a slave owner or the person telling us we’re in trouble for a crime we didn’t commit.\n\nNow like I said earlier, paying attention to the world around them isn’t a new feat for the series. The first and second films deal with nuclear proliferation, intolerance, the Vietnam War, classicism, government corruption, the lack of separation between Church and State, and the list goes on and on and on. To ignore the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, the Black Panthers, and the aforementioned Watts riots would’ve been malpractice for a franchise a part of the great Rod Sterling’s legacy.\n\nSterling created The Twilight Zone to say things in television he knew he could only get away with through Science Fiction. It’s one thing to come out and say, “Yo world, get it together!” but it’s another thing entirely to do it under the guise of a story about aliens, ghosts, distant dimensions, or a planet where apes evolved from men. Conquest wears its influences on its considerably long and orange sleeves, which all come to a roaring conclusion during the finale.\n\nWith his uprising in full effect, Caesar stands in front of his people with a path of destruction behind him and in front of him, and engages in another philosophical conversation with MacDonald, the lone survivor. MacDonald asks Caesar to show humanity and end the cycle of violence and hate. Caesar, politely and loquaciously, responds in kind:\n\n“Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of Man’s downfall — the day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble! When the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity! And we will build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans except to serve our ends! And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you… now!”\n\nIn other words, nah.\n\nThere are no easy answers to questions we’ve been asking for hundreds of years. Revolution is often necessary, but at what cost and what form should it take? Is it one of words or is it one of bullets? Should everyone be spared or do you make room for sympathizers? And at what point do you become the embodiment of the very thing you were trying to revolt against?\n\nCaesar and his people are too through and he sees no way forward but the path he’s carved. MacDonald rightly questions how an ape society will possibly fair better than the one they’ve just overthrown as they will be susceptible to the same ills. And maybe he’s right. As a black man, MacDonald’s perspective is one of wisdom and experience. He’s seen us go for tit for tat. We take one of theirs, they take one of ours and the one they take from us always has a bigger impact. Caesar feels its the slave’s right to strike back at his/her oppressor and MacDonald understands that and empathizes. The movie doesn’t side completely with Caesar, but it isn’t totally against him either.\n\nThere are no easy answers to questions we’ve been asking for hundreds of years. Revolution is often necessary, but at what cost and what form should it take? Is it one of words or is it one of bullets? Should everyone be spared or do you make room for sympathizers? And at what point do you become the embodiment of the very thing you were trying to revolt against?\n\nNow, the theatrical release softens this blow by giving Caesar another speech, one of peace and tranquility, while cutting away from all the brutal murder and such. Apparently, some audiences just couldn’t get with the complex ending and the overtones of violence putting an end — briefly — to political unrest. I get it. I don’t agree with it but I get it. I won’t even bother posting the speech because it robs the movie of its juice and is way too neat thematically and from a narrative standpoint. And if you’ve got the blu ray, you can witness the original version in all its complicated glory, full revolution and all.\n\nAccording to an anecdote on the Behind the Planet of the Apes documentary, black audiences in test screenings loved the original ending. It connected with them on a visceral level and after seeing their neighborhoods burned down and their leaders snatched from them, how could it not? Forty years isn’t as long ago as we’d like to believe and once again we find ourselves at fork in the road in history.\n\nMarcus Benjamin is a danger to the public, an alum of American University, St. John’s University, a screenwriter, and has an intense relationship with words.
