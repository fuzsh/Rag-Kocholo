        "text": "The majority of the outdoor scenes were shot in and around the University of California, Irvine campus, which was designed by futurist architect William L. Pereira, and was only six years old at the time of filming. Much of the production centered around the Social Science complex, which was designed by A.C. Martin & Associates and was still under construction during filming. Careful use of camera angles and editing made a handful of buildings and exteriors feel more like action spread across an entire city.\n\nSome exteriors, and all of indoor sets were all filmed at the Fox backlot in Century City, Los Angeles.\n\nThe budgets on the Apes movies were constantly trimmed because 20th Century Fox was still in financial trouble following the huge flops of Cleopatra (1963), Star! (1968) and Hello, Dolly! (1969). One of the results of the lower budget was the reuse of music cues throughout this film and \"Battle for the Planet of the Apes\" (1973) (\"Escape From the Planet of the Apes\" (1971) repeated only one piece of music in the film).\n\nWriter Paul Dehn conceived the film as a simian take on the American Civil Rights movement of the time. Ironically, Dehn was English but brought an astute sensibility to the project. (Not surprisingly, the film was very popular with black audiences.)"
