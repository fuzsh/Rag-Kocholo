        "text": "The film was cut for violence in the final battle scene by the US distributor for a 'PG' rating. Similarly the BBFC (UK) cut the electrical torture of Caesar, and closeup scenes of violence from the killing of the guards and the climactic battle for an 'AA' cinema rating. Video releases were classified as '15' (now '12' for the DVD) and all prints feature the edited U.S version.\n\nThe 2008 Blu-ray release includes both the theatrical version, and an 'Unrated' version with an alternate ending sequence, which was re-edited and re-shot due to poor audience reaction and to get a PG rating. In the ending, Caesar allows the apes to beat Breck and the other humans to death. Breck does not cower, but faces his executioners. Lisa does not say \"No\" and Caesar makes no speech counseling compassion. There are also additional shots of apes and humans bleeding from gunshots, and apes stacking bodies of riot police."
