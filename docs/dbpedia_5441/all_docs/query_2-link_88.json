        "text": "The new one is a reboot, not a prequel, and takes place in its own continuity. As such, it doesn't matter from a plot point of view whether it's watched before or after the original film series.\n\nBut... it contains many nods to the original films... So I'd personally watch the originals first, followed by the new one, so as to understand the references.\n\n0\n\nIt's a reboot, not a prequel. It's an origin story for a new Apes franchise.\n\nThink how...e.g. Even though Batman Begins was set at the start of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman, it was not a prequel to the Burton/Schumacher films - it was a reboot, the start of new franchise, not linked to the previous four films.\n\nRise is set before the apes take over the world, and has nods to the original films...but it is not a prequel - it is not part of the same continuity (unlike the Star Wars prequels or Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).\n\nThe original films already dealt with the Ape Rebellion, in the fourth film: Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. Rise covers things differently, rebooting the franchise for a (potential) new series of films. Same general idea (Earth eventually ending up being ruled by apes), with some characters with the same name (e.g. Caesar), but done in a different way in a different continuity.\n\nI could go into detail on how they differ, but that would spoil things for you.\n\n0\n\nGot this one\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Planet-Apes-5-Movie-Collectors-Blu-ray/dp/B001GPTCE8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1326237936&sr=8-3\n\n+ the new one just out, is it best to watch the 5 old movies first then the new one or vice versa\n\nWatch the originals, then Rise. Rise contains a few homages to the original, so watching the original film first will give you the satisfaction of catching them.\n\nNot necessary to watch, but if you're one who likes to complete things, then give the Burton version a watch. It shares the same theme but not the story arc, so you can watch that, or not, whenever you like. Many think it's crap, but I don't mind it that much despite its limitations, finding it endearing in parts. Oh, and if you really want to complete things, then the TV and animated series might be worth considering. Then again, tastes may vary. Finally, the novel is well worth a read (I prefer it to all the films).\n\n0\n\nIf I hadn't already seen all the older Planet of the apes films I would watch 'Rise' first as its first in a time sequence.\n\nIt shows how the story from the start. However I get the feeling there will be a sequel to 'rise' as there is still a big time gap between 'Rise' and the 1968 \"origianal\" Planet of the Apes film.\n\nI only really liked Rise and The Planet of the apes, wouldn't bother watching any of the others again.\n\n0"
