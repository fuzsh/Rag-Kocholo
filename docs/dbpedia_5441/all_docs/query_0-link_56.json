        "text": "It wouldn’t be a long-running franchise if it didn’t have a needlessly complex timeline of films. With over 50 years of movies to account for, the “Planet of the Apes” films are particularly convoluted – there’s the original series, a floating reboot and a prequel series about to receive it’s fourth entry with “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.”\n\nIt all tells the story of Earth’s transformation into a society in which apes evolve into the dominant species and humans are rendered mute. Traditionally, this is a franchise of its time — the 1970s films tackled issues relating to the civil rights movement, for instance whereas 2014’s “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” is about gun control. Taken as a whole, it’s a wildly compelling series of 10 films.\n\nConsider this your complete guide to watching all the “Planet of the Apes” movies in order.\n\nPlanet of the Apes Movies in Chronological Order\n\nIf you need to stick to a strict timeline when appreciating a story that sprawls almost 60 years of movies then this is your roadmap.\n\nHere are all the “Planet of the Apes” movies in timeline order:\n\n“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”\n\n“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”\n\n“War for the Planet of the Apes”\n\n“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes”\n\n“Planet of the Apes” (1968)\n\n“Beneath the Planet of the Apes”\n\n“Escape from the Planet of the Apes”\n\n“Conquest of the Planet of the Apes”\n\n“Battle for the Planet of the Apes”\n\nWhen it comes to Tim Burton’s 2001 remake “Planet of the Apes,” it doesn’t necessarily fall anywhere in the timeline as it’s a redo of the 1968 film and never got its own in-universe sequel. You can watch it whenever you like – though don’t take that as a recommendation.\n\nPlanet of the Apes Movies in Release Order\n\nIf you want to watch the visuals and moviemaking magic improve over time then you’ll want to follow this order.\n\nHere are the “Planet of the Apes” movies in release order:\n\n“Planet of the Apes” (1968)\n\n“Beneath the Planet of the Apes” (1970)\n\n“Escape From the Planet of the Apes” (1971)\n\n“Conquest of the Planet of the Apes” (1972)\n\n“Battle for the Planet of the Apes” (1973)\n\n“Planet of the Apes” (2001)\n\n“Rise of the Planet of the Apes” (2011)\n\n“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” (2014)\n\n“War for the Planet of the Apes” (2017)\n\n“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” (2024)\n\nOriginal Planet of the Apes Movies In Order\n\nIf you want to stick exclusively to the classics and just a rewatch of the original “Planet of the Apes” films in order, then this is your plan.\n\nHere is the watch order for the original “Planet of the Apes” movies:\n\n“Planet of the Apes” (1968)\n\n“Beneath the Planet of the Apes” (1970)\n\n“Escape From the Planet of the Apes” (1971)\n\n“Conquest of the Planet of the Apes” (1972)\n\n“Battle for the Planet of the Apes” (1973)\n\nWhere to Stream the Planet of the Apes Movies\n\nThe entire “Planet of the Apes” franchise is currently available for streaming on Hulu. All nine previously released films are ready to be binged and get you caught up for the release of “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” in theaters May 10."
