        "text": "The following story contains spoilers for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nIn Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, humans no longer rule as the dominant species on Earth. The film is the fourth entry in the rebooted Apes series and the tenth Apes movie in total. Somehow the franchise still feels young.\n\nThe latest film picks up right where the last movie, 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes, ends. Caesar, the chimp who united apekind and ushered a way forward, has long since passed away. Now his image and what he stood for has been warped and lost in legend for the apes that live out their days on Earth. Audiences follow a new hero, Noa (Owen Teague), who sets out on a mission of revenge after a rival clan burns down his village. The villain, Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand), takes their prophet’s name in vain and seeks human technology to expand his empire. But when Noa crosses paths with a human named Nova (Freya Allan), their lives are forever changed.\n\nDoes Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes have a post-credits scene?\n\nNo, it does not. At the end of the film, Noa is able to defeat Proximus and bring his clan back home. Despite a surprising betrayal from Nova, the onetime partners agree to keep their distance and possibly learn to trust each other again in the future. With their newfound technologies, they will advance side by side and hope to share the planet peacefully.\n\n“You think Kingdom is going to be an ape story, but by the end of the movie, you realize that it’s actually an ape and a human story,” director Wes Ball told The Hollywood Reporter. “By the end of the movie, we literally open a door to a whole new world that we’ll get to play in if we’re lucky enough to make more movies. Can apes and humans live together? Can we coexist? So that will be a continued theme throughout future movies, and if there’s any chance for peace between these species, it will probably be between these two characters, no matter what happens.”"
