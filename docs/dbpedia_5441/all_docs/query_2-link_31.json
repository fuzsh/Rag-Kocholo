        "text": "This year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and 1972's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes are arguably the two best Planet of the Apes films ever made. There are no spaceships or mutants. There are no long, drawn-out courtroom scenes. There's no James Franco. But there is Caesar. Less pious than Dr Zaius, less fidgety than Cornelius, less prone to blowing up entire planets than Charlton Heston, Caesar is the most important figure in the entire series. He's the ape who first wages war on the humans.\n\nBut which Caesar is better – the original Caesar played by Roddy McDowall in the 1970s, or the new Caesar played by Andy Serkis today? We should probably put this to the test.\n\nBest baby Caesar\n\nIn the new films, Caesar is found abandoned after his mother goes berserk and interrupts an important board meeting. Meanwhile, original Caesar was born at the end of Escape from the Planet of the Apes, the child of two super-intelligent chimps who were sent back from the future right before Charlton Heston murdered everyone. And, unlike the computer-generated new Caesar, he's an actual chimp. A real-life baby chimp. When it comes to species-destroying primate generals, nothing's cuter than a real-life baby chimp.\n\nWinner: Original Caesar.\n\nMost realistic adult Caesar\n\nIf you want to see how far technology has come since 1972, watch the Planet of the Apes films. In Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for Planet of the Apes, Caesar is a bloke in a suit. Not a very good suit, either – by the fourth and fifth original films, the costume budget was so low that the monkey masks dimpled and crumpled whenever the actors talked. Meanwhile, new Caesar benefits from cutting-edge Weta technology and Andy Serkis's incredible skills as a performer. Watch Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and you could very well be watching a real chimpanzee, albeit one who rides horses and talks and stuff.\n\nWinner: New Caesar.\n\nMost inspiring speech\n\nOld Caesar: \"Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of man's downfall – the day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble! When the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity! And we will build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans except to serve our ends! And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you … now!\"\n\nNew Caesar: \"Apes together strong!\" Winner: Original Caesar.\n\nBest human friend\n\nCaesar's only friend in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is Armando, a circus owner played by Ricardo Montalbán. Between Escape and Conquest, Armando raised Caesar. He taught him about empathy and love. He showed him how to blend in with other less intelligent apes. He even sacrificed his own life when Caesar accidentally blurted out \"Lousy human bastards\" at the police. Meanwhile, New Caesar's best friend is James Franco, who isn't as cool as Ricardo Montalbán because he never played Khan in Star Trek 2. No contest.\n\nWinner: Original Caesar.\n\nBest fashion sense\n\nNew Caesar has certainly managed to remain on-trend by daubing himself with some vaguely tribal-looking facepaint. Aside from that, however, he's entirely naked. Contrast that with Conquest-era Caesar, who strutted around in groovy leather jacket and delivered his rousing sermons in an era-appropriate militant jumpsuit, and there the winner is clear for all to see. And those sideburns! Who's cooler than Original Caesar? Nobody, that's who.\n\nWinner: Original Caesar\n\nThe verdict\n\nOriginal Caesar wins!\n\nSo there we have have it – Roddy McDowall's Caesar is the definitive article. He is the greatest ape. Andy Serkis might have more accurate posture, a tighter grip on what chimpanzees are actually capable of and a look that hasn't been modelled on a four-year-old boy's Halloween costume, but he simply doesn't have McDowall's panache. But what do you think? Have we picked the alpha male? Or is Andy Serkis the king of your jungle? Champion your favourite below."
