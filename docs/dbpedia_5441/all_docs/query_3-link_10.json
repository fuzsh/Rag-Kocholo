        "text": "Did the last trilogy/series wrap up? The last I saw was in theaters, the one with Franco and a bunch of apes on a bridge, but I didn't like it and tuned out to the rest of the sequels. I dig Freya in The Witcher though so I may have to keep an eye out for this one eventually.\n\nI am more a fan of the original series I have watched them hundreds of times. I like part 1 and 2 of the recent trilogy though I felt War of the Planet of the Apes was a mixed bag and have not revisted it that much, off the top of my head I can't remember exactly what happens at the end. If Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the Apes dominating Earth I am all in, I would like to see how that is realised with modern film making.\n\nI am familiar with Freya though only her brief appearances in Season 1, I have not watched The Witcher beyond that since my refusal to subscribe to Netflix, I should probably sub for one month and binge watch the content I missed.\n\nDid the last trilogy/series wrap up?

I saw it for the first time a couple years back and quite enjoyed it. I need to check out the others but I've heard they can be quite the mixed bag.\n\nCan't fault you there with avoiding Netflix and sticking with it. I was just discussing on Facebook with someone else my utter distaste for them in canceling Santa Clarita Diet a couple of years back. I only have Netflix now because of my girlfriend; if she didn't want it anymore, I would've canceled a long while back. I'd sooner \"sail the high seas\" than give them my business.\n\nBut yes, that \"subscribe for a month and burn through all the good content before canceling\" plan is probably the best way to go.\n\nJerry Goldsmith played a part in me liking some of the earlier films his scores were fantastic, I even would cite The Planet of the Apes 1968 as well as Star Trek and 2001 as being the main reason I have loved Science Fiction all my life.\n\nMy Ranking of the Original movies...\n\n1. The Planet of the Apes\n\n2. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes ( 'Unrated' ending version of the film which is far superior IMO)...\n\nThe Theatrical ending was the total opposite of this scene and changed the course of the early film series, then we ended up getting the abysmal sequel Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\n\n3. Escape from the Planet of the Apes\n\n4. Beneath the Planet of the Apes\n\n5. Battle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nI watched The Planet of the Apes TV show when I was very young though have very vague memories of it.\n\nMy Ranking of the more recent movies...\n\n1. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\n2. Rise of the Planet of the Apes\n\n3. War for the Planet of the Apes this film has some great scenes early on though the film loses me midway through, I should give this trilogy a revisit its been a while.\n\nI also own Tim Burton's The Planet of the Apes I have very ;little time for the film."
