        "text": "Rob and I were ejected from the Planet of the Apes (the movie, not the planet) in 2001. We got a chat going to explain what happened.\n\nROB\n\nWhen was the last time we IM’d each other?\n\nJESSE\n\nProbably sometime after we saw Planet of the Apes 2001 but also way before Rise of the Planet of the Apes came out in 2011.\n\nROB\n\nOnly a decade between the two? It felt like a lifetime\n\nJESSE\n\nRight? A lot of these franchises get rebooted or whatever way too fast, but we straight up got into long-term relationships and got married in the lapse between Apes movies.\n\nROB\n\nSabrina and I had been dating a few months. But I don’t know if she had yet to meet my parents when we first attempted to see the Tim Burton Planet of the Apes.\n\nJESSE\n\nI had met Marisa the spring before at school and we were chatting online a lot that summer. In fact I think her friends went to go see it the same night that we tried and I’m sure I emailed or IMed her about our misadventure.\n\nROB\n\nOh you guys were totes in touch, but you hadn’t sealed the deal yet\n\nMARISA\n\nSo this is a Google Hangout?\n\nROB\n\nI don’t know if this counts as a real Google hangout because it’s text only Google hangouts are an insidious plot to get unsuspecting people to sign up for Google+\n\nJESSE\n\nFirst: background by way of what I’ve been listening to on a loop for the past 24 hours and am listening to RIGHT NOW: I got my cassette-to-computer device working and ripped the audio of Planet of the Tapes, the mix tape I made for the drive to Crossgates Mall to see Planet of the Apes (2001). At least the intro will be available as a download with the transcript of this conversation.\n\nROB\n\nUgh, I prepped for this by listening to the Apes jams bonus tracks on Severe Tire Damage. I learned nothing.\n\nJESSE\n\nBut SO DID I, because those bonus tracks are all over the mix! Weirdly, though I had only seen the 1968 original at the time, the two best They Might Be Giants improv’d Apes songs are in fact my two favorite Planet of the Apes sequels: Escape from the Planet of the Apes and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nROB\n\n“This Ape’s For You” isn’t one of your favorite Apes movies?\n\nJESSE\n\nOK, so to fill in, Rob and I and our buddies did this thing where we made 30-minute tapes for the drive to Saratoga to Crossgates Mall outside of Albany, for the movies we were particularly psyched about.\n\nROB\n\nOur buddies was usually Jesse, Me, Chris, Jeff, and whatever girl had yet to realize we weren’t that charming.\n\nJESSE\n\nI was trying to remember what the other mixtape-worthy movies of summer 2001 were, and I’m pretty sure it was just Moulin Rouge! and A.I.… which is actually pretty spot-on. But in retrospect, it’s weird that Apes was the only really big blockbuster type thing that got the tape treatment that summer. Which actually makes sense because summer ’01 was a bunch of really uninspired sequels and also Michael Bay’s interpretation of Pearl Harbor.\n\nROB\n\nIt ended up being low key as it was me, you, Chris, and Ofy. But the ape tape is important to the story.\n\nJESSE\n\nAnd Kerim was there too! Kerim, who we went to elementary school with. But yeah, I volunteered to do the tape for this one. Chris was sort of the go-to but by this point we switched up a little more. I remember Rob, you did the X-Men one the previous summer.\n\nROB\n\nIt’s almost like you made the ape tape because there were so few tape worthy films\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah and I HAD IDEAS about how to do an Ape Tape, goddammit!\n\nROB\n\nMy hazy memory would have me believe that there were “ape sounds” on that tape\n\nJESSE\n\nYES, AWESOME CALLBACK. Or call forward. But yeah, most of my ideas were basically “songs with monkey in the title” which isn’t even scientifically accurate.\n\nROB\n\nOr perhaps something that made us make ape noises. A big part of the tapes was “singing” along. It got performative after a while\n\nJESSE\n\nAnd if this all happened a decade later, it would have been like on YouTube and shit, probably. Or like 300 Vines?\n\nROB\n\nWell if it happened a decade later the whole story wouldn’t have happened! Ofy brought a tape recorder.\n\nJESSE\n\nYes, he had been recording us all day. Like the NSA does now.\n\nMARISA\n\nThis tape is good. I can hear it from the next room. “Ice of Boston.”\n\nJESSE\n\nActually, funny story, “Ice of Boston” TOTALLY SUCKS to sing! You think you know the words to the verses but you do NOT.\n\nROB\n\nI do now. Not in 2001, but after listening to it a about a 1000 more times. Anyway, it was strange because I only ever really saw a tape player like that in a classroom. One of those kind of longish cassette decks that would often accompany a filmstrip projector.\n\nJESSE\n\nYes. And he maybe had the wrong type of batteries in it?\n\nROB\n\nYES. This was super strange. It had a battery compartment in back like a boombox, it was supposed to take 6 c or d batteries, but he had put in either aa’s or aaa’s and they could touch the connectors. So it was either recording or playing back at a strange speed because it wasn’t operating at full power\n\nJESSE\n\nAnd basically Ofy was hanging out with us all day making a distorted sound collage of whatever stupid crap we were up to.\n\nROB\n\nYeah, before digital media we thought anything we committed to tape made us Warhol.\n\nJESSE\n\nRIP “Toys & Food” (I assume. I don’t have a copy of it).\n\nJESSE\n\nAlso… I kind of think there may have been six people in Chris’s car?? Am I crazy? I think there was a sixth dude.\n\nROB\n\nI don’t remember Kerim, but I thought Ofy brought a friend.\n\nJESSE\n\nMaybe it wasn’t Kerim? Maybe it was some friend of Ofy’s but in my mind’s eye it’s a friend of Chris’s, like maybe from college? I picture it as his friend Mattie but that’s almost certainly not true.\n\nROB\n\nIt may have just been the four of us\n\nJESSE\n\nI KNOW there were five in the car but I don’t know who the fifth is. Anyway, not important. I had a hell of a time making the tape — I mixed it on my computer but I didn’t have a CD burner, and Chris did, but it wasn’t working. So I got a wire from Chris and actually hooked up my parents’ stereo to my computer and dubbed it onto cassette (by that point the “tapes” were usually actually CDs).\n\nMARISA\n\n“Psycho killer, hooligan gorilla.”\n\nROB\n\nI feel like it couldn’t have been Kerim because there’s no way he wouldn’t have put up a stink over what went down\n\nJESSE\n\nWhoever the fifth person in the car was, he REALLY liked the “hooligan gorilla” song. Probably not Kerim.\n\nROB\n\nI mean the police were involved and we’re not sure Kerim was there? Means he wasn’t there\n\nJESSE\n\nNow I just want to make Lake Ave Elementary in-jokes about who else it could be. “Was it Colin?”\n\nROB\n\nIt might as well have been Peter Mancini then! #injoke\n\nJESSE\n\nHaha yeah isn’t it weird how we’re trying to figure out who this fifth dude was, and the answer is “none of our other lifelong friends.” It was like they KNEW something was going down. So yeah, up through the drive to Crossgates, this trip was going GREAT.\n\nROB\n\nYeah, we used to get upset that Jeff spent so much time with Amy, but it was clearly time well spent.\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah, you know what Jeff was doing that night? NOT almost getting arrested at a movie theater.\n\nROB\n\nIn hindsight, what was our biggest mistake? Bringing Ofy? Making such an on-theme tape? Sitting in the front like we always do?\n\nJESSE\n\nI mean, I think a lot of mistakes were made. But I like to think most of them were not our mistakes.\n\nROB\n\nOur meaning you and me. Ofy made mistakes. Chris never should have driven us. Mysterious fifth person should have made a bigger impression on us.\n\nJESSE\n\nSo we stroll into Crossgates SUPER PSYCHED for Tim Burton’s Planet of the Apes. It had been a pretty lame movie summer so, you know, we could have used a pick-me-up.\n\nROB\n\nLike you said, to that point, we had only seen the first Planet of The Apes. Burton was coming off of Sleepy Hollow, which remains one of my favorites of his\n\nMARISA\n\n…Meanwhile, I’m down in Westchester, seeing the same movie with all my high school friends, and taking pictures of the great time we were having.\n\nJESSE\n\nI should point out now that Ofy’s tape recorder was not at all concealed when we went past the ticket guy. If it was concealed at all, it was because it didn’t look like anything anyone would ever use to record anything.\n\nROB\n\nI was sitting next to him and didn’t actually realize he had brought it in. He either had it on his lap or on the floor.\n\nJESSE\n\nI wish I could remember the trailers we saw if only for the time-capsule quality.\n\nROB\n\nOh they would have been terrible.\n\nJESSE\n\nBut I do remember that as the opening credits started, Ofy led us in a chant of (They Might Be Giants, “Battle for the Planet of the Apes” style) APES APES APES APES APES, which crescendoed into applause as the title came up.\n\nROB\n\nIn hindsight, their are parallels to our excitement for Godzilla ’98. Were we ever so young?\n\nJESSE\n\nGenerally I feel like we got excited about pretty cool things but yeah, this plus Godzilla makes us look like we back the wrong horse all the time. By the way, I’ve burnt myself out on Planet of the Tapes and am throwing in the Moulin Rouge! CD which I haven’t heard in at least six or seven years\n\nROB\n\nIt wasn’t like we were super invested into either franchise. We just felt like it was our duty as nerds to be into it.\n\nJESSE\n\nI know, and can you imagine how this was affecting Nathaniel? Godzilla and Apes are like his nerd majors. It would be like if we hated Phantom Menace as much as everyone else did [a year after it came out].\n\nROB\n\nI don’t even know if I have nerd majors. I feel like I’m more of a generalist.\n\nJESSE\n\nIt’s comics, Rob. Yours is comics.\n\nMARISA\n\nThis Moulin Rouge! tape is pretty janky.\n\nJESSE\n\nHOW DARE YOU? This is actually just the mission music.\n\nMARISA\n\nEDM? EDMM?\n\nJESSE\n\nTechno remix of the Sesame Street theme is NOT EDM but omg hold on wait for the bass drop\n\nROB\n\nPretty much every comic movie that’s come out since 98 has been more enjoyable than either Godzilla ’98 or Apes ’01\n\nJESSE\n\nJK, even by 2001 we were kind of over songs with bass drops\n\nROB\n\nIt might be IDM\n\nMARISA\n\nTURN DOWN FOR WHAT!\n\nROB\n\nWe were into IDM back then\n\nMARISA\n\nIt’s certainly not I.\n\nROB\n\nPre-EDM, post-electornica. Oh God SABRINA where are my loose cds?\n\nSABRINA\n\nTop shelf, I believe. Or in one of the cd books we didn’t throw out\n\nJESSE\n\nSabrina, I take it you didn’t go see Burton’s Planet of the Apes opening night in July 2001?\n\nSABRINA\n\nNO\n\nROB\n\nCrap, my X-Men mix doesn’t seem to be in here.\n\nMARISA\n\nNot to keep this convo off track, but is IDM one of those genres that only has one artist? (IDM:The Postal Service::Chillwave:Neon Indian)\n\nJESSE\n\nMouse on Mars is IDM, right?\n\nMARISA\n\nI don’t know what that is but it sounds adorable.\n\nROB\n\nLet’s say yes. I’m sure Pitchfork would.\n\nJESSE\n\nOK, so return to the scene: we’re in the front row for Planet of the Apes in 2001, we just incited a bunch of applause and cheering at the title, we settle in to enjoy the latest Tim Burton opus, and also state of the art ape makeup.\n\nROB\n\nYeah, the casting was on point. Makeup on point. Kind of took a while to get going though.\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah, it definitely felt like the movie was warming up. Not very Burton-y. So I think the first thing that happened was about twenty minutes in, an usher came in and sort of scoped us out? Which, wow: can you picture that happening now? An usher looking at anyone in the crowd?!\n\nROB\n\nBack then ushers used to come in like twice. Kind of towards the beginning of the film and then in the last third. It was so decadent in hindsight. It wasn’t until after that I put it together. The weird thing was she came back and asked Ofy to come with her.\n\nJESSE\n\nI had forgotten it was a lady. It was a lady? I guess I just don’t see gender.\n\nROB\n\nIt was a female, maybe younger than us. In hindsight, I imagine her as that rookie guard in Orange Is the New Black\n\nJESSE\n\nAw, we were just watching that! She’s also in a TMBG video.\n\nROB\n\nAnyways, maybe it’s because we’re very self-centered. But ofy left and I looked at fifth guy and we just kind of shrugged at each other. “Whatevs, I’m still wathcing the movie.”\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah, it didn’t really occur to me that anything bad was happening, except maybe that we chanted APES for like 15 seconds.\n\nROB\n\nAnyways, Marky Mark has broken out from his Ape oppressors. He makes it to clearing, and then the usher comes back and asks us to come with her. The thing I don’t remember if the guys waiting for us just in the hallway were Albany county sheriffs or Guilderland police.\n\nJESSE\n\nI feel like sheriffs. That’s just a vague memory though.\n\nROB\n\nThey were wearing polo shirts with a logo on them, so maybe sheriffs. Before they even tell us what’s going on, they take our IDs into a side office and photocopy them.\n\nJESSE\n\nI remember being just super confused. Like too confused to be as indignant as I should have been\n\nROB\n\nThe cops’ reasoning was perhaps the most befuddling part\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah, I think one of our guys even passed by the room where they had put him aside and were asking him “are those ape sounds on the tape???” Because they thought we were bootlegging the sound of the movie. To be matched later with separately bootlegged video.\n\nROB\n\nYeah, they were holding him in the small business office where they photocopied our ids\n\nJESSE\n\nBecause when you want a REALLY high-qual bootleg, you record sound separately, on audio cassette. And I know we are kind of old, but trust me, cassettes were NOT a viable audio format in 2001.\n\nROB\n\nI would say that what happened to us was what I would call a Napster Panic or by that time probably a Kazaa Panic.\n\nJESSE\n\nLIMEWIRE PANIC\n\nROB\n\nLike how sometimes homophobes use a gay panic defense as an excuse for committing hatecrimes.\n\nJESSE\n\nAnd we’re not saying we got hatecrimed of course.\n\nROB\n\nNo, of course not\n\nJESSE\n\nBut yes, panic driven by ignorance.\n\nROB\n\nI’m just trying to understand the mindset of a minimum-wage employee calling the cops on us. Some manager must have put the fear of god in her.\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah. Which is weird because most bootlegs on the streets, probably not from the theaters of upstate NY\n\nROB\n\nLike her, her manager, the cops, they didn’t know what pirating was or how it was done, but someone they knew had read in Newsweek about how it was killing the entertainment industry\n\nJESSE\n\nAnd Ofy’s total lack of suspicious behavior and our inconspicuous behavior was, I guess… reverse-psychology suspiciousness?\n\nROB\n\nThat was the whole thing. He may have been taking an off speed recording of just the audio of the movie. It was never clear that he was recording the movie. What value does that even have on the black market? Since I have never seen just the audio of a movie online, I’m guessing none\n\nJESSE\n\nThat said, I would pay up to $5 for a copy of that audio tape now So clearly it has appreciated in value.\n\nROB\n\nThese cops didn’t see it that way. I did concede their first question: “It’s pretty stupid to bring a recording device into a movie theatre?” Keep in mind that within 18 months 90+% of the audience would have recording devices of higher quality in movie theaters. Called their phones. And I think we’d all be on board with ushers calling cops on people texting during a movie.\n\nJESSE\n\nPeople still make crazy dumb decisions about this stuff, too. At some press screenings, they make you check your phone. Even if the movie is in 3D and basically impossible to properly bootleg (not to mention highly unlikely to be bootlegged by film critics with cell phones).\n\nROB\n\nReally, it was just two questions. “It’s pretty stupid to bring a recording device into a movie theatre?” to which we nodded. And the second: “So that means it’s pretty dumb to be sitting next to someone that has brought a recording device into a movie theater?”\n\nJESSE\n\nOK, sidebar, this Moulin Rouge! mix is mostly not so good.\n\nROB\n\nI may have said huh, but they may have only been in my brain\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah, I wish I had the presence of mind to say, I guess, but I don’t think that it’s illegal. To sit next to someone who brought in a recording device, I mean.\n\nROB\n\nIf the cops hassled me every time I sat next to a friend that had done something done something stupid, I would have been in and out of jail from 8th grade until now. What could they have charged us with? Accessory to suspicion copyright infringement of something with no value?\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah. Well, I remember they kind of sleazily held us hostage, basically saying, if you put up a fuss about this treatment, we COULD at least make a show of arresting your friend\n\nMARISA\n\nII remember showing you guys my photos from that night, and you guys being all, “So you brought a camera into a movie theater and nothing?” Yonkers don’t give a fuuuuuck.\n\nROB\n\nSo they kicked us out and said (I’ll never forget this): “Do not ask for a refund, do not pass go, do not collect $200.” Like did that even pass for a joke?\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah and in retrospect, they seemed ESPECIALLY concerned that we didn’t get our $9 each back.\n\nROB\n\nLike their work was done\n\nJESSE\n\nFighting piracy is paramount, but the important thing is that the movie theater keeps the $45 for the movie we didn’t get to watch.\n\nROB\n\nLike coming out to the mall and shaking us down helped them with their quotas. But that wasn’t the worst part! You know what the worst part was?\n\nJESSE\n\nWHAT?\n\nROB\n\nIt didn’t happen that night. I don’t really remember the rest of the night. The thing about when they pulled us out was it felt that everything was about to really happen.\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah, it was not a fun car ride back. We were all kind of dazed and shell-shocked.\n\nROB\n\nSo like a pair of stooges you and I, just the two of us, went to the Wilton Mall the following, I want to say Tuesday. And we paid to see the movie again!\n\nJESSE\n\nOh, no, it was straight up the next night\n\nROB\n\nWe are the worst\n\nJESSE\n\nIt was Saturday, we had to circumvent a parade downtown to get there, and I totally insisted on it.\n\nROB\n\nI was for sure on board.\n\nJESSE\n\nSo I am the worst. But, you know, imagine how hard it is for me to not get to see the actual movie I wanted to see!\n\nROB\n\nIt was ~2000-2001 where I started thinking to myself “I don’t need to go to every movie Jesse does and I”ll be happy” [Ed. Note: I’m pretty sure this thought was percolating more in the summer of 2002, when I made Rob see both The Adventures of Pluto Nash and Serving Sara.]\n\nJESSE\n\nI’ve long wondered if the movie would have landed a little better for me if it hadn’t been preceded by such disappointment.\n\nROB\n\nBut this one, I agreed: Yes, we must finish. Total sunk cost fallacy. Before we got pulled out, it wasn’t like it was captivating us.\n\nJESSE\n\nBut it wasn’t QUITE bad enough to think, oh, well, this sucked anyway, let’s never see it.\n\nROB\n\nYeah it wasn’t egregious, it was just a big nothing.\n\nMARISA\n\nAs someone who had a good time that night, it did take me a while to realize how not-great that movie is. But the realization did come eventually.\n\nROB\n\nWith the resources there (director, cast, etc) it should have been a much better movie. Take, for example, Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows.\n\nJESSE\n\nHa, yeah, his Apes might actually be “better” than Dark Shadows but Dark Shadows is WAY BETTER than Apes.\n\nROB\n\nDark Shadows, not a great film, but it was a lot of fun, had some good performances, and it felt like Tim Burton was somewhat familiar with the source material. Wasn’t Apes also the movie that ruined Burton’s marriage?\n\nJESSE\n\nOne of them, maybe. And a lot of summer ’01 movies were products of strike fear, rushed into production. Shit, by the way, this A.I. CD is WAY better than my Moulin Rouge! CD.\n\nROB\n\nPretty sure it was. That movie had both Estella Warren and Helena Bonham Carter in it\n\nJESSE\n\nSo it ruined Burton’s marriage, the Apes franchise for about a decade, and our Friday night.\n\nROB\n\nAnd our Saturday night.\n\nJESSE\n\nAlso worth noting that for all of our questionable behavior over the years, we have NEVER been kicked out of a movie, before or since.\n\nROB\n\nThat’s not true. Desperado.\n\nJESSE\n\nAHHHHHA FUCK. Well, Apes was our only time during the movie.\n\nROB\n\nBut seriously, twice. That’s it.\n\nJESSE\n\nNow I kind of want to start an APES chant at Dawn of the Planet of the Apes on Friday. Since literally nothing you can do short of murder can get you kicked out of a movie theater now\n\nMARISA\n\nI don’t know if I ever heard the Desperado story.\n\nSABRINA\n\nMe either…\n\nROB\n\nIt’s pretty boring:\n\n“One for Desperado”\n\n“Are you 17?”\n\n“No”\n\n“Ok Jesse, I’ll go stand over there. Get 2 tickets. When the old lady asks if you’re 17, say yes.”\n\nMARISA\n\nI don’t know if you can call it being kicked out if you never made it in.\n\nSABRINA\n\nAgree.\n\nJESSE\n\nOh, we made it in. Briefly.\n\nMARISA\n\nJesse, is this Spacehog?\n\nROB\n\nIt was the perfect plan, except the kids at the snack bar checked our tickets because they didn’t have a ticket taker that day\n\nJESSE\n\nThe best is that she really did sell me the tickets on my word that I was 17! This is some Spacehog, yes.\n\nROB\n\nAs we rushed into the theater I heard them say “isn’t that rated R?!” So then they came in and asked us to leave. I asked for a refund and they said yes. The mean old lady at the register gave us our money back and Jesse said: “Thanks! You saved my fucking soul!”\n\nSABRINA\n\nSo not a total loss.\n\nMARISA\n\nYeah, that sounds like Jesse.\n\nJESSE\n\nGod, what a prick that guy Jesse was.\n\nROB\n\nThat old lady was mean. Jesse in his rage thought it was her fault, but she totally did buy Jesse’s story that he was 17. Keep in mind, I was a year older than Jesse at the time\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah Rob was like days away from being 17.\n\nROB\n\nThen either that day or the next day we got El Mariachi out, maybe out of the library. Oh man the Drive-In Movie Store would let us rent ANYTHING. In hindsight, it might have been good if they had a little more restraint\n\nMARISA\n\nYou can always count on the library to let you corrupt your soul.\n\nROB\n\nThey let me rent Femalien 2 WHICH WE GOT AS A JOKE when I was 16 or 17. They just called my parents to make sure it was ok to use their account.\n\nJESSE\n\nI’ve still only seen the original Femalien.\n\nROB\n\nThat’s untrue. You’ve never seen Femalien.\n\nJESSE\n\nI watched it with Chris and Flannery and a bunch of other people!\n\nROB\n\nThat was Femalien 2\n\nJESSE\n\nThat’s impossible. How could we have followed it??\n\nMARISA\n\n“I haven’t seen Femalien 2 *yet*.”\n\nROB\n\nChris was like let’s get this softcore sci fi parody as part of our 5 for 5 as a joke. So I had to go up to the guy and do it.\n\nJESSE\n\nI’m pretty sure it was the original\n\nROB\n\nWe were hanging out with these two girls and he had a crush on one of them. As the person who actually rented the movie, trust me. It was the sequel.\n\nJESSE\n\nMaybe we rented Femalien 1 a different time then\n\nROB\n\nHe had me rent this movie as a joke to impress (?) these girls\n\nJESSE\n\nThe important thing is we never saw Petticoat Planet.\n\nROB\n\nJESSE SHUT UP I’M TELLING THE STORY. Then we get to his house, put it in, then he takes it out after the Petticoat Planet trailer before it really starts and says this was a bad idea, then he watches it with you and Flannery later. Same tape.\n\nJESSE\n\nHuh. So I’ve already seen the Empire Strikes Back of softcore sci-fi porn\n\nROB\n\nYou’ve seen the Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace of softcore sci-fi porn. Technically better effects.\n\nJESSE\n\n“effects” WINK\n\nROB\n\nNo, for real CGI. The 2 minutes I saw of Femalien 2, I thought to myself “wow they sprung for CGI.” This was a time were any CGI was good.\n\nJESSE\n\nWe thirsted for it like it was Surge\n\nROB\n\nThat is an apt simile.\n\nJESSE\n\nSo that’s how we got kicked out of Planet of the Apes in 2001 and helped put the franchise back into hiding with our sour feelings.\n\nROB\n\nIn some ways, it’s all our fault.\n\nJESSE\n\nBut like Schumacher and Batman, maybe it had to happen this way?\n\nROB\n\nThat’s the problem with whole thing. Dean and Emmerich fool us, shame on us. Tim Burton makes maybe the worst film of his career? Shame on him.\n\nJESSE\n\nHa. And yeah, I’d call it his worst. He followed it up with Big Fish, though, which is one of my favorites.\n\nROB\n\nI’d probably be forgiving if I saw the whole way through just the one time\n\nJESSE\n\nActually in SOME ways the ’89 Batman is just as guilty of that here-nor-there Apes quality, kinda Burton-y, kinda Batman-y, but not really as good at either as it should be\n\nROB\n\nOh, but that style. Things happened. I was never bored or threatened with arrest. Apes is not really Burtony at all.\n\nJESSE\n\nTrue, although Apes never made us watch Robert Wuhl and I GUESS I’d choose Wuhl over getting arrested, but…\n\nROB\n\nThis was pre-Arli$$ Wuhl\n\nJESSE\n\nBut it’s probably telling that I’ve seen the 1989 Batman at least six or seven times, more than probably any movie that I only kind of like. Whereas I’ve seen Burton’s Apes like 2.25 times.\n\nROB\n\nSo to recap, what have we learned? Besides maybe don’t talk about the softcore porn you rented AS A JOKE when you were a teenager in front of your wives? (Notice how they seemed to bolt the chat right around then?)\n\nJESSE\n\nYeah, MARISA got in the shower, hopefully not because she felt unclean. So that, and maybe if Jeff is out of town just wait until he’s back to see the movie because he probably won’t bring a recording device (except his phone).\n\nROB\n\nSo we learned nothing and we’re worse off for this experience, I guess there’s no way to disguise this."
