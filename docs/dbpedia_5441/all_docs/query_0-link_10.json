        "text": "August 3, 2007\n\nGo ahead and yuck it up...but I'll have you know these books were my only friend that long lonely summer when I was thirteen and stuck on my grandparent's farm in the middle of South Dakota with nobody to talk to except a fat shetland pony who chewed her oats and stared all drowsy-eyed at me and a dog named Brownie who refused to learn to shake.\n\nAnd I had the coolest Planet of the Apes sweatshirt--I'd give up my Planet of the Apes lunch Box to get that sweatshirt back...well no, no I wouldn't.\n\nI saw them here--and it was like finding an old friend.\n\nJune 24, 2011\n\nA few years after he wrote his very strange novel, \"Black in Time\" about Black Power militants using a time machine to change history, John Jakes got a paycheck for writing the novelization of the most racially-loaded of the \"Planet of the Apes\" films, \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.\" Released in 1972, just four years after more than one hundred American cities erupted into race riots following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King the movie (and book) kicks off back in time, with apes serving as slaves to humans. The super-smart talking ape, Caesar (child of apes who escaped from the future), gets angry at the abuses his apes suffer, infiltrates the institutions of The Man and leads a violent ape revolution.\n\nJakes's writes sentences the way a lumberjack chops wood - whack, whack, whack, with hardly any change in rhythm - but this novelization shines for two reasons:\n\n1) It keeps the original ending. Test audiences roundly rejected the bleak ending of the movie which saw Caesar executing the humans who kept his apes chained up, and vowing that his revolution would sweep the world and see man totally destroyed. A new ending was shot that emphasized a \"Why can't we all get along?\" message. The original ending was included with the special edition Blu-Ray a few years ago and it's astonishing in its power. The book keeps the original ending and rarely has the rage of the oppressed been so powerfully expressed and the book does an even better job of drawing a parallel between the plight of African-Americans who were enslaved and the apes.\n\n2) In the film, the characters who are chained up, enslaved, tortured, vivisected, whipped and degraded are concealed behind thick prosthetics and make-up that makes them look like monkeys. Without the visual cues that these are apes, the book gives us a world where characters dressed as humans but having \"dark faces and forms\" are subjected to this kind of treatment and called \"monkey\" and \"inhuman\" and \"ape\" which all sound like racial slurs directed against African-Americans. So by virtue of its medium being imaginative and not visual, the novelization of \"Conquest\" becomes an even more racially-loaded anti-slavery screed and reads less like a sci fi book about slave apes and more like a sci fi book about slaves.\n\nAlso...ape war! Which is awesome!\n\nSeptember 10, 2011\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes blew me away. It is by far my favorite film of the year, or many years for that matter. I am a huge movie tie in novelization addict, and since Conquest is sort of the Rise of the original film series, I had to track down a copy of the novelization.\n\nI have always enjoyed reading John Jakes. I first became aware of him at a young age when I read his Brak the Barbarian novels. Conan ripoffs to be sure, but I loved them at 12 or 13 and devoured them. Later on I read The Bastard, North and South, some of his SF, and even his early sleazy pulps. I liked them all. He has a terrific readable style, good tight descriptions, and a great sense of pacing. He would make a good screenwriter.\n\nOverall, one of the better novelizations I have read. I wish he had done a little better with the MacDonald character, but Jakes really captured the dark brooding Orwellian feel of the movie, and the action sequences are exciting.(less)\n\n6 minute\n\nApril 3, 2017\n\nA fantastic read that was perfect as a commentary for the times when it was published. To be fair, it was a novelization of the movie, yet it used the original, darker ending that was omitted from the film. The novel cuts better.\n\nWhat's even better, and profoundly sad, is that this book is still relevant today in the age of Trump and the white supremacists he surrounds himself with and motivates. A book for our times...perhaps a handbook...\n\nJuly 27, 2019\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes, characters by Pierre Boulle\n\n8 out of 10\n\nAlthough not as meaningful, enticing, gripping as the original Planet of the Apes, this sequel does offer food for thought.\n\nIn a future that seems possible, if not probable, humans decide to use and abuse apes which are taken into slavery.\n\nAfter all, mankind has destroyed so many species and is in the process of making the whole planet uninhabitable, hence this premise is credible.\n\nThe apes, for which viewers cheer, instead of for humans, have a chance.\n\nThis is Caeser, the son of Cornelius and Zira, protagonists of the first Planet of the Apes.\n\nHe is brave, super intelligent, resilient and resourceful.\n\nWhile vicious humans try hard to have him and many other apes tortured, inprisoned and killed, Caesar finds the brilliant strategy to defend his mates and eventually win over the enemy.\n\nIndeed, in the plot there is the notion that with time travel, human leaders know that in the future, it would be the apes that are in control and men and women have lost the supremacy that they are using, as we see in the present, to destroy the climate and perhaps make this planet just like the myriad of cold rocks that travel through the universe without any form of life on them.\n\nMarch 28, 2020\n\nWell written violent fiction, a novelization of the movie which out does the original in it's orgy of climactic blood-letting. What can I say as much as I admire the original movie this is based upon and the novelization which this is - I can't help but be a Human Being partisan. When I saw Conquest as a kid, 8 or 9, I was a natural anarchist who cheered the apes on in their riotous anti-human rebellion. As a sober middle-aged man I can't help but shake my head at the simplistic moralizing of both movie and book. Still, it's a classic of sci-fi and early 70's cinema. I can't say I loved the book because it is almost unrelenting grim in it's revenge-porn portrayal but it was a damn gripping read. Did I mention the movie is pretty good and might actually in it's own twisted way be the apex of the original Planet of the Apes series. Thank you very much.\n\nSeptember 20, 2020\n\nA book that is rather quite unsubtle in talking about race relations. It really shows the humans in the worst light possible, which might turn some off. The last few chapters are quite violent and blood soaked. It does show the digression of Ceasar from an innocent and caring chimpanzee experiencing the slavery of society to an unapologetic conqueror blinded by hate. But then again having read this during 2020, I am sad at how current this book still is almost 50 years on. What with the protests and riots and documented police brutality. Whole scenes seem to have been lifted right out of this book to be shown on the evening news. It is disheartening to think so little has changed.\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\nAs far as novelizations go, this is a top notch read. I picked it up hearing it maintained the more extreme ending from the original screenplay and that it functioned as a pretty strong and serious race allegory. Both accounts proved true. I have not watched the film yet. My only exposure to Caesar was through Andy Serkis’ brilliant portrayal in the most recent Apes trilogy. Caesar is a favorite heroic archetype of mine. In this novel he is more violent than the modern trilogy but his characterization remains similar. It made me want to read the subsequent novelizations. Let’s hope the film holds up to the book!\n\nJuly 28, 2017\n\nUgly and hate-filled, the Conquest of the Planet of the Apes novel lacks all of the subtlety and nuance of the film. After living a life in hiding in Armando’s circus super-intelligent chimpanzee Caesar visits a metropolitan city and learns that humans have enslaved apes and brutally mistreat them, leading Caesar to stage a rebellion. Author John Jakes goes to extremes to paint humans as monstrous villains, and by the end even Caesar becomes a callous egotist who sees other apes as “animals.” There’s no one to really root for, as each side is acting out of hatred and prejudice. However, there are a few plot points that the book clears up and expands upon, such as explaining how Caesar is able to communicate with the other apes (who can’t talk) and organize them for his rebellion. Also there’s a little more about the political situation and the totalitarian government in this dystopic future. Yet Conquest of the Planet of the Apes utterly fails to capture the mood and tone of J. Lee Thompson’s extraordinarily evocative and compelling film.\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\nHave I told you how much I love the Planet of the Apes movies? Yes I have. And so you know that obsession trickles to the books. And here we are.\n\nJuly 5, 2011\n\nI like this book. As I write that, I notice my shoulders reflexively squaring and my expression shifting into defiant 'So what?' mode. Admittedly, the writing is uneven, but there are moments in this book of intense drama and conflict. The writing is only passable, but I think the way that the subject matter is dealt with was masterful. It almost feels like a comic book conflict: epic and profound and maybe a little ridiculous, too.\n\nMay 1, 2016\n\nProbably where i first got my disgust for both slavery & animal abuse. This is not subtle, but it is a clever premise and holds undeniable appeal to see the fascists of the future get stomped by a bunch of pissed-off simians."
