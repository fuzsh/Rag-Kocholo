        "text": "The entire Planet of the Apes franchise is streaming on Hulu now, just ahead of the new film’s release on May 10, 2024. The new movie is called Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and takes viewers back into the world years after the reign of Caesar. Reportedly, “a young ape goes on a journey that will lead him to question everything he’s been taught about the past and make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike.”\n\nAll of the nine Planet of the Apes movies are streaming on Hulu, beginning with the film that started it all: Planet of the Apes (1968). In the original science-fiction classic, three astronauts discover a futuristic planet where the apes are the rulers and humans are their slaves. The astronauts quickly become trapped and imprisoned and discover the world is far more bizarre and sophisticated than they ever could have imagined. The film was a box-office hit and obviously spawned a sequel and an entire franchise.\n\nFour more Planet of the Apes films came in the 1970s with Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) and Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). The films follow the apes as they flee and travel back in time to present-day America and are captured, eventually turning the tables on the humans. All of the films are full of social satire and tons of suspense.\n\nThe franchise was seemingly finished until a remake premiered in 2001. The new Planet of the Apes followed astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) as he discovered the new planet. The next film came in 2011 called Rise of the Planet of the Apes, starring James Franco as scientist Will Rodman who experiments with a drug in hopes of curing his father’s Alzheimer’s disease. He may have discovered a cure with the help of an infant chimp named Caesar but as he grows, he displays unusual intelligence and abilities. The next few films Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) follow Caesar’s reign as he hopes to take over.\n\nWatch all of the Planet of the Apes films on Hulu here.
