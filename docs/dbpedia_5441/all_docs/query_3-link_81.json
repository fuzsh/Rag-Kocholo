        "text": "Discover the vast, long-running world of Planet of the Apes with a breakdown of every film released in the franchise.\n\nThe mostly-venerable Planet of the Apes franchise has wowed and delighted audiences since its blockbuster 1968 original film. The core premise is essentially the same from film to film, with the eternal struggle between intelligent, evolved primates and the humans they view as lesser creatures.\n\nHow To Watch the Planet of the Apes Reboot Movies\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)\n\nIn the mid-to-late 2000s, 20th Century Fox devised a plan to reboot the Planet of the Apes franchise. The plan came to fruition in 2011 when Rise of the Planet of the Apes, directed by Rupert Wyatt, was released to rousing success.\n\nThis film and its follow-ups exist within a new continuity, separate from the '60s and '70s installments.\n\nThe story concerns a human scientist who creates what is meant to be a cure for Alzheimer’s. What he eventually ends up with, however, is a hyper-intelligent chimpanzee named Caesar who will play a crucial role in future films.\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes can be streamed on Hulu and FuboTV.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)\n\nNaturally, with Rise being a box office hit, a sequel was quickly developed. Matt Reeves of The Batman fame helmed Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in June 2014.\n\nDawn takes place two years after Rise. Society, as humans knew it, is in shambles as genetically enhanced apes are rapidly becoming the dominant force on Earth, with Caesar as their leader. But a contingent of human survivors threatens to cause trouble for apekind.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes is available on Hulu and Max.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes (2017)\n\nAnother movie in the rebooted series came about in 2017. Matt Reeves returned to the director’s chair to oversee the production of War for the Planet of the Apes. The film, much like its predecessors, was quite popular and also nominated for Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards.\n\nTwo years after Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, War tells how, as the title suggests, an all-out battle for the fate and control of Earth was waged between the human militia and the intelligence-boosted primates.\n\nFans can catch War for the Planet of the Apes on Hulu and Max.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024)\n\nLanding in theaters on Friday, May 10 is Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball will serve as director.\n\nKingdom embarks into a bold new era for the reboot universe. It’s set almost three centuries after War for the Planet of the Apes, and the apes have well and truly taken over Earth. What’s left of the human population exists with primitive, regressed intelligence.\n\nThe movie’s plot revolves around a chimp named Noa who finds an unlikely companionship in the form of a young human woman. Together, they undertake a journey that could have dramatic consequences for both species.\n\nHow To Watch the Original Apes Films\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\n1968’s Planet of the Apes is the movie that started it all! Based on the novel La Planète des singes by French author Pierre Boulle, the film adaptation was optioned by producer Arthur P. Jacobs, who often lamented that he wasn’t the one who made King Kong.\n\nBefore entering production, The Twilight Zone mastermind Rod Serling took a crack at penning the script. And, ultimately, on a budget of $5.8 million, Planet of the Apes was born.\n\nIn the movie, human astronauts find themselves on what they believe to be a strange new planet where monkeys walk upright and communicate verbally. The film’s shocking twist ending is still often referenced today throughout pop culture.\n\nThe original Planet of the Apes is streaming on Starz.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)\n\nWhen 1968’s Planet of the Apes struck box office gold, a sequel was green-lit in short order. Unfortunately, Beneath the Planet of the Apes and its three cinematic follow-ups suffered from mostly increasingly diminishing returns.\n\nBeneath’s story concerns another spaceship touching down on Earth in search of the astronauts who went missing during the original movie. The crew is horrified to discover that a subculture of mutated humans is living underground.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes is available to watch on Starz.\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nGenerally regarded as the best of the original Planet of the Apes sequels, ’71’s Escape from the Planet of the Apes was made despite the previous movie’s seemingly conclusive ending.\n\nThe film’s story is about a small group of apes who escape the destruction of their world by traveling back in time to then-present-day 1971. But upon their arrival in this distant past, they are treated as scientific curiosities and held captive.\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes is streaming on Starz.\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nBy the early 1970s, Planet of the Apes was a hit property and Fox struck while the iron was hot, cranking out sequels yearly. In ’72 came Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, which wasn’t as well-received as the movies before it but still performed well enough for one more film afterward.\n\nMost agree that Conquest largely eschews the nuanced, allegorical nature of the first Planet of the Apes film and the novel and instead focuses on action and spectacle. The plot, which concerns dystopian states and time loops, is evidence of this.\n\nThose looking to check out Conquest of the Planet of the Apes can do so on Starz.\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes was the one that finally did the original film series in. It is the lowest-grossing movie in the entire franchise and after its release, Fox instead pursued an Apes TV series to continue things.\n\nBattle follows a subjugated human population and an ape leader named Caesar, who tries to keep the peace between both sides but is unsuccessful in that endeavor.\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes is also streaming on Starz.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001)\n\nAfter the mid-’70s, the franchise lay dormant for decades, but plans for a remake were always present. In 2001, director Tim Burton, known for films like Batman and Edward Scissorhands, brought a new Planet of the Apes to theaters.\n\nThis one starred Mark Wahlberg as a human astronaut who winds up on an Earth ruled by primates, in the vein of the 1968 original. Yet, the remake was not nearly as popular as the ‘68 film. Critics panned the story, but many conceded that the visuals and ape makeup worn by the actors were nonetheless impressive.\n\nThe 2001 Planet of the Apes falls outside of both established franchise canons as a standalone project. Thus, it can be watched at basically any point during an Apes marathon or on its own entirely. It is streaming on Hulu, Starz, and FuboTV.\n\nMore Apes Than You Can Shake a Stick At\n\nIn nearly 60 years, Planet of the Apes has become quite the enduring franchise. The concept of humanlike primates ruling the globe resonates with audiences.\n\nIn addition to the theatrical features, a short-lived Planet of the Apes television series aired in 1974, and there was even a 1975 Saturday morning cartoon based on the Apes films.\n\nAlthough Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has yet to arrive in theaters, it’s shaping up to be a big success, and hopefully, it will generate enough revenue to justify more sequels.\n\nIn fact, Kingdom director Wes Ball teased the possibility of additional films last December, revealing to Entertainment Weekly that “We’ve got good ideas for what would come next.”\n\n20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes hits theaters on Friday, May 10.\n\nRead more about Planet of the Apes on The Direct:\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes: Release, Cast & Everything We Know\n\n2024 Kingdom of Planet of the Apes Trailer Confirms Movie's Major Tie to James Franco's Will Rodman\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes Gets Unsurprising Rating"
