        "text": "Movie #5 of 2024:\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nA welcome bounce back for the series. Like its two predecessors, there’s a fatalistic darkness to this Apes film, but it’s carried off better here in balance with a certain comic playfulness. The producers wrote themselves into a corner by concluding the prior adventure with a bomb blowing up the entire planet (and presumably all our known characters with it, though several had already been shot to death by then), but this next sequel concocts an ingenious solution to that problem: time-travel! Since chimpanzee scientists Dr. Zira and Dr. Cornelius were conveniently absent from the final act of Beneath anyway, this script establishes that they were working with a genius friend on patching up the crashed spaceship from the first flick. Somehow, the three apes were able to launch it into orbit just before the doomsday weapon went off, and thus got to watch the world explode as they retraced Taylor’s trajectory backwards through space to modern Earth.\n\nIt’s a tad silly, but a great setup for the plot that follows. In a nod to the climax of the original novel — in which the hero flies home to discover that apes have taken over in his absence — this movie starts with contemporary humans swarming a spacecraft that’s just landed in the ocean, only for the astronauts to remove their helmets and reveal that they’re apes (and to cue up the title card with a funky 70s soundtrack). Though initially hesitant to disclose their intelligence and power of speech, the “apestronauts” ultimately do just that, setting them on an arc somewhat analogous to how Taylor was treated by their kind back home. Here, though, they’re welcomed as celebrity sensations after the initial disbelief and shock, and viewers get a rather glorious montage of their ensuing shopping spree and media blitz.\n\nCornelius and Zira have been staunch allies for the humans in the franchise all along, but their promotion to central protagonists is a good one. From this point forward, the Planet of the Apes series has its sympathies pretty firmly on the side of the apes, with humanity at large cast as the intolerant xenophobes (offset by the occasional exceptions in the role the chimpanzee couple used to occupy). Plus, by sending a small company of apes out of their home society and into the present day, this particular movie gets away with a significantly smaller makeup and sets budget, much like Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home or Galactica 1980.\n\nThe humans grow more worried about their visitors the more that they let slip about their own time and what they know of Earth’s history (some of which, unfortunately, seems to contradict the state of ape knowledge established in the first film). The new origin story for apekind: a plague killed off many animals, prompting humans to turn to our primate cousins for pets and then slaves. Eventually an ape named Aldo learned to say “no” and began a revolt movement, leading to the downfall of our species and its civilization.\n\nThough those events are far in the future, the president’s scientific advisor Otto Hasslein — name-dropped in both previous movies for his theories on relativistic space travel — fears that Zira’s unborn child will represent a bridgehead force precipitating man’s early decline. The apes are interrogated more harshly, with a specific focus on the devastation they witnessed in the war and Zira’s confessed medical experimentation on live human subjects. Hasslein ultimately procures authorization to neuter the chimps and end their pregnancy, spurring them to break out of their government holding facility and go on the run before he can. Though the scientist is ordered to take the fugitives alive, he instead shoots Zira and her newborn baby and is subsequently killed by Cornelius in revenge, who then gets slain by sniper fire himself. So much for our heroes, once again.\n\nIt’s the third downbeat ending in a row for the franchise, but there’s one further twist before the credits roll. Earlier Zira and Cornelius had stayed briefly at a traveling circus where an ordinary chimpanzee had recently given birth herself, and it’s now revealed that the two mothers swapped babies off-screen. Milo — named for their companion who died in a mishap near the start of the film — is the infant who’s still alive, and the movie ends with him exclaiming, “Mama! Mama!” in a manner eerily reminiscent of the doll Taylor found back in the Forbidden Zone that proved ancient humans could talk. It’s not quite a Terminator-style causality loop, but it does appear that Hasslein may have inadvertently helped bring about the exact fate he was trying to prevent. All in all, a neat little piece of science-fiction.\n\n★★★★☆"
