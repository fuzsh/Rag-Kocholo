Today is the 80th birthday of Cleve Moler. Most readers will know Cleve as the inventor of MATLAB. MATLAB was originally a Fortran program that Cleve wrote to give students easier access to the EISPACK and LINPACK libraries. Cleve and John Little later founded The MathWorks and turned MATLAB into a commercial product.

Cleve was a speaker at the conference Advances in Numerical Linear Algebra: Celebrating the Centenary of the Birth of James H. Wilkinson held in Manchester last May. We took the opportunity there to celebrate Cleve’s birthday in advance. A video of Cleve’s talk is included below.

Most recently I saw Cleve at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) conference in Valencia, where he spoke in the minisymposium Bohemian Matrices and Applications that I organized with Rob Corless. See Cleve’s blog post about his talk.

Happy birthday, Cleve!
