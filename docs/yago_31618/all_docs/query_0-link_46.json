        "text": "Many years ago I took a course affectionately known as \"Electrical Engineering for non-Electrical Engineers\" taught by Giorgio Rizzoni. It was a great class, but it's been a while so this on-ramp was a good refresher. It covers the basics of simulating analog electric circuits in Simscape. Use the physical network approach to simulate electrical filters and faulty power supplies, and analyze their performance in the time and frequency domains. https://spr.ly/6046lmIZI\n\nOn Aug 29th, my colleagues are hosting a webinar: Design and Analyze a Quadcopter with MBSE - in this webinar you will learn how to manage complexity and enhance your engineering projects using Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). #Quadcopter #MBSE #MATLAB https://spr.ly/6046YCeua\n\nI like these onramps - they are quick and you learn the basics to be dangerous ... in this new onramp learn C and C++ code generation from MATLAB functions - code generation workflow, including how to fix common compatibility issues and how to use MEX functions to call C code from MATLAB. #MATLAB https://spr.ly/6040czlMo\n\nIf you are in Huntsville on Aug 7, please consider joining my colleagues at our Aerospace & Defense Symposium: https://lnkd.in/eY53SDys\n\nMy colleagues discuss how to elevate the value of your product by combining AI with Model-Based Design in this interview with @jousefm2 #ai #mbd #MATLAB https://spr.ly/60419n9ZN\n\nMy colleague shares her three reasons to join #MATLABEXPO in Bangalore on 11th July . 1. Discover real-world applications shared by leading MathWorks customers. 2. Participate in discussions on technology megatrends such as #AI, #electrification, software factories, clean energy, #wireless and radar, led by MathWorks engineers. 3.Explore, experience, and connect at our Technology Showcase while networking with MATLAB and Simulink enthusiasts. https://spr.ly/604891iFy ."
