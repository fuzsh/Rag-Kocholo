        "text": "MAT 331: Computer-Assisted Mathematical Problem Solving\n\nFall 2017\n\nChristopher Bishop\n\nProfessor, Mathematics\n\nSUNY Stony Brook\n\nOffice: 4-112 Mathematics Building\n\nPhone: (516)-632-8274\n\nDept. Phone: (516)-632-8290\n\nFAX: (516)-632-7631\n\nTuTh 11:30-12:50 Math Tower S-235S (computer lab in basement)\n\nOffice hours 10-11:20, Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nFinal Exam 5:30-8:00pm Wednesday, December 13\n\nFinal will be in usual room Math S-235S\n\nThis is a course in problem solving using MATLAB. This is commercial software produced by the company Mathworks, and is commonly used throughout academia and industry. We will start by going through most of Tobin Driscoll's short book \"Learning MATLAB\". for the first few weeks to learn the basic commands. We will then do various topics in cryptography, probability, graph theory, approximation theory (and whatwever we can fit into the course) using materials I put on the website. There is a lot of interesting material in Cleve Moler's books \"Numerical Computing in MATLAB: revised reprint\" and \"experiments in MATLAB\", as well a few articles and blog entries by Moler from the Mathworks site. Moler is the original creator of MATLAB. Moler's books can be purchased as hard-copies, but there are also a free online versions provided by MathWorks (the company the produces MATLAB); you will need to create a MathWorks Account.\n\nThe university has a WRTD writing requirement that can be fulfilled by submitting two of the projects from this class. If you intend to fulfill the requirement this way, you should register for the zero-credit course MAT 459, and let me know you want to use your MAT 331 projects for this requirement. I will post possible projects as the semester proceeds and we will discuss a few in class two.\n\nMATLAB is installed on machines in the SINC sites and is available from any computer via the virtual SINC site Virtual SINC site. .\n\nScripts and functions should be saved in your MySBFiles directory; other dirctories on the SINC site machines are erased after 48 hours. These MySBFiles can be accessed directly from any machine with an internet connection at MySBFiles .\n\nThe university license also allows you to download a copy to your home computer (if you are currently a student or faculty member): Information on downloading a copy of MATLAB This page also has instructions on how to create a MATHWORKS account,which you will need to access MATLAB programs and textbooks, even if you don't download a personal copy of MATLAB.\n\nNumerical Computing in MATLAB: revised reprint by Cleve Moler. Our main textbook. Chapters can be downloaded individually. There is also a collection of MATLAB code to download and that is used in the text.\n\nSIAM site for buying hardcopy of \"Numerical Computing in MATLAB: revised reprint by Cleve Moler.\n\nExperiments with MATLAB by Cleve Moler. Another textbook on MATLAB, but assuming less math than \"Numerical Computing with MATLAB\". We will use some chapters from this, such as the one on the Mandelbrot set.\n\nCleve's Corner articles related to the text and MATLAB in general.\n\nGetting started in MATLAB Introduction by the makers of MATLAB\n\nLearning MATLAB by Toby Driscoll. A very good, very short and inexpensive introduction to MATLAB, by a real expert.\n\nSIAM site for buying of \"Learning MATLAB\" by Tobin Driscoll.\n\nThe not too short introduction to LaTex\n\nGrades\n\nGrades will be based on:\n\n(1) In-class quizzes. I provide practice quizzes to do at home.\n\n(2) Homework. These will usually involving writing a short report stating the problem, describing how to solve it, giving the MATLAB code you used, and table or pictures that illustrate your results.\n\n(3) Projects: just like homework, but a little longer and often involving some outside reading. I will make up several of these and you will choose at least three to do.\n\n(4) Final exam (similar to quizzes, but longer)\n\nDuring the last week of class I will post tentative grades based on the homework, quizes (best 4 or 5) and two projects. A percent will be compute for each of the three categories and the average of these three numbers taken. The letter grade will be based on this average. You will receive at least this grade for the class. If you are happy with this grade, then you need not hand in a third project or take the final. If you would like to improve the tentative grade then you can hand in a third project and take the final. Then your grade will be based on the average of the percents for homework, quizes (best 4 of 5), projects and the final (each of the four categories counts equally).\n\nHistogram of over totals as of Nov 20, 2017. This includes the 3 homeworks, the best 4 out of 5 quizes, and Project 1. Each category was converted into a percentage (out of 100) and then I took the avergage of these (all weighted equally).\n\nSend the lecturer (C. Bishop) email at: bishop - at - math.sunysb.edu\n\nLink to history of mathematics There are a lot of iteresting articles here. If you know of other math related sites I should link to, let me know.\n\nA link to MathSciNet (Online Mathematical Reviews). These gives access to reviews of about 3 million mathematical papers and links to some of the actual articles. You will need a NETID and password to access this.\n\nA link to the Stony Brook virtual SINC site . You will need a NETID and password to access this.\n\nA link to the installer for TexMaker. on the SINC site machines. You can also download for use on the virtual SINC site. This is special editor for TeX files that incorporates several steps into one. You will need a NETID and password to access this.\n\nA link to BlackBoard . You will need a NETID and password to access this.\n\nClass Projects\n\nProjects are longer versions of the homework assigments, but I will give several and you need to choose any three to hand in. If you are enrolled in MAT 459, then two of these can be used to satisfy the university WRDT requirement, as described above.\n\nThe first project is due October 31, the second November 30 and the third 0n Decemeber 7 (last day of class). You may submit eithe a hardcopy or electronic version (but I would prefer a hardcopy to make sure it is printed just as you intend).\n\nEach listed project has two components for you to look at. The first is a one page description of what I want you to do. This will often include an itemized list of computations I want you to make, based on the reading the second part. The second will usually be a some notes written by myself, or a short recent paper by some mathematician describing a calculation or algorithm. Usually there will be more material here than you need to do the project; I generally only want you to do and describe experiments that test the claims of the paper, and you generally don't have to understand the proofs in the paper to do this.\n\nList of projects (more will be added later):\n\nProject 1 , ----- Gauss-Jacobi quadrature and Legendre polynomials , notes by C.Bishop\n\nProject 2 , ----- Points of increase for random walks , by Yuval Peres, Microsoft Research\n\nProject 3 , ----- Uniformly discrete forests with poor visibility , by Noga Alon, Tel Aviv University\n\nProject 4 , ----- Is Gauss quadrature better than Clenshaw-Curtis? , by Lloyd N. Trefethen, Oxford University and NYU\n\nProject 5 , ----- Weiesrstrass approximation theorem , Chapter 5 in \"Approximation theory and Approximation practice\" by Lloyd N. Trefethen\n\nProject 6 , ----- Unexpected biases in the distribution of consecutive primes , 2016 by R.J.K Oliver and K. Soundararajan\n\nSee also: Article in Nature , Article in Quantum\n\nProject 7 , ----- Volumes of n-balls -- Wikipedia ,\n\nProject 8 , ----- Using letter counts to distinguish different languages\n\nProject 9 , ----- Breaking a re-used one time pad\n\n, Project 10 , ----- Solving a random permutation substitution\n\nProject 11 , ----- Fractal dimension and the Weierstrass function, YouTube video explaining idea of fractalsa and dimension\n\nProject 12 , ----- Gibbs phenomenon -- Wikipedia ,\n\nHow to write up the projects\n\nThe write-up is supposed to be a short report that explains what the problem is and how you solved it, including any samples of code or output (such as tables or plots). Think of it like an essay for an English or History class except that it is written about a math problem, instead of about Jane Austin or the French revolution. There should be an introduction that describes the problem, a main body that gives the details of your solution and a conclusion the briefly summarizes your results.\n\nSome good things to do include:\n\nPut titles on your plots\n\nInsert comments into code saying what role named arrays play and what loops are doing\n\nsupress intermediate calculations and display a single table of results at end\n\nwhen comparing two or more arrays, present them as columns of a single table/array\n\nwhen plotting an approximation to a function, also plot the function so we can see how close they are. Also consider plotting (separately) the difference of the two.\n\nRe-do project 1\n\nI will allow students who scored less than 90 on the first project to hand in a revision for re-grading by Tuesday, Nov 14. There will not be a similar opportunity for the second and third projects.\n\nTentative Lecture Schedule\n\nTuesday, August 29 Introduction, Driscoll Chapters 1 and 2\n\nCleve's Corner - The origin of MATLAB ,\n\nHomework 0 (PDF)\n\nHomework 0 (TEX)\n\nHomework 0 with Solution (PDF)\n\nHomework 0 with Solution (TEX)\n\nTopics covered: course administration, the class webpage,\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp how to access the virtual SINC site,\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp how to open MATLAB, open documentation,\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp basic arithmetic, digits, vpa\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp writing a MATLAB script,\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp for loops,\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp entering vectors and matrices\n\nThursday, August 31 Driscoll Chapters 3 and 4\n\nTopics covered:\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp save, load\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp basic functions: sin, cos, log, exp, rand, round, floor, ceil\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp arrays: size,length, the colon operator, zeros, ones\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp plot\n\nTuesday, September 5 Labor day, NO CLASS\n\nThursday, September 7 More commands\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp cumsum\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp referencing elements, end, find, logical indexing\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp strings, char, num2str, str2num, strfind\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp syms, solve, vpasolve, root\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp anonymous functions\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp plot versus ezplot\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp scatter\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Scripts from Sept 7 class\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp NCM - Chapter 1, Read Section 1.7 on floating point numbers and precision\n\nTuesday, September 12 Quiz, last 30 minutes of class\n\nCleve's Corner - Computing pi , I thought you might like to read this, but I will not be testing you on this material.\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Due to a problem with cetain MATLAB commands like \"solve\", \"vpa\" and \"root\" on the virtual SINC site, I will remove these commands from Quiz 1.
