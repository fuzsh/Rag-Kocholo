        "text": "My background is in Physics. I have a BA in Physics with a minor in Mathematics, and an MS in Physics. I used MATLAB as an undergrad for my capstone project and then some more as a grad student in several classes, so I've always liked it a lot. I used Mathematica a little bit in the same classes and always found the syntaxes much more confusing than in MATLAB. That said, I used the Wolfram Integrator extensively to check my work on physics problems, because I usually wanted to do symbolic computations (it has since become Wolfram Alpha, but the integration functionality is still there). I applied to a lot of different jobs after I finished grad school, and this one caught my eye as being particularly interesting. I was a bit nervous when I interviewed because I didn't know much about technical writing at the time, but it turns out that was fine. MW largely hires subject matter experts and then teaches them how to write (this is in contrast to technical writers at many other companies, who may not know the first thing about the background of the features they need to document). I've been here nearly 4 years now and really enjoy the work. I don't eat many fried snacks (like potato chips), but I like tater tots and will always order them over french fries if given the option. The ratio of the outer surface area to the inner volume per bite makes them far superior to french fries, IMO."
