        "text": "On Tuesday morning we were privileged to host the Creator of MATLAB, Cleve Moler.\n\nCleve delivered a seminar where he recounted the story of the extraordinary history and evolution of MATLAB, from its beginnings 50 years ago.\n\nWe recorded Cleve's talk, which you can watch via YouTube.\n\nMATLAB is today a full-featured technical computing environment used by millions of engineers and scientists worldwide, to analyse and design the systems and products transforming our world.\n\nMATLAB software can be found inside automobile active safety systems, interplanetary spacecraft, health monitoring devices, smart power grids, and LTE cellular networks. MATLAB is used for machine learning, signal processing, image processing, computer vision, communications, computational finance, control design, robotics, and much more.\n\nBut MATLAB started out as a simple â€œMatrix Laboratory\" - hence the name. Three individuals, J. H. Wilkinson, George Forsythe, and John Todd, played important roles in the origins of MATLAB."
