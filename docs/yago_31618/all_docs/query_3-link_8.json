        "text": "1. MATLAB :\n\nMATLAB is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and a high-performance language that is used for technical computing. The name MATLAB stands for matrix laboratory. It was developed by Cleve Moler of the company MathWorks.Inc in the year 1984. It is written in C, C++, Java. It allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions, implementation of algorithms and creation of user interfaces.\n\n2. Octave :\n\nOctave is software featuring a high-level programming language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It was developed by John W. Eaton and written in C, C++, Fortran languages. It comes up with a text interface along with an experimental graphical interface. It is also used for various Machine Learning algorithms for solving various numeric problems. It is similar to MATLAB but performance is slow when compared to MATLAB.\n\nDifference between MATLAB and Octave :"
