        "text": "What Is a Programming Language?\n\nA programming language is a computer language used to develop software programs, scripts, or other instructions for computers to execute.\n\nAlthough many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the language’s rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE.\n\nThen, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages do not require a compiler and use an interpreter to execute the script.\n\nProgramming Languages Evolution: From The First Day To Till Now.\n\n1883: The first ever programming language was introduced when Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace collaborated on the Analytical Computer, the earliest mechanical computer. For the Analytical Computer, the first computer software, Lovelace created an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli numbers.\n\n1949: Simpler assembly language was initially employed to make machine code language, which is required to instruct a computer what to perform.\n\n1952: Alick Glennie invented Autocode, which some regard as the very earliest compiled computer programming language.\n\n1957:FORTRAN was designed byJohn Backus for use with mathematical, statistical, and scientific purposes.\n\n1958: An algorithmic language called Algol was developed.\n\n1959: Dr. Grace Murray Hopper designed COBOL as a universally compatible programming language.\n\n1959: LISP was developed by John McCarthy. This programming language may now be used with Python and Ruby and was created for AI research.\n\n1964: For students without a solid foundation in arithmetic or technology, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz created BASIC to allow them to utilize computers.\n\n1972: Pascal was created by Niklaus Wirth and named in honor of Blaise Pascal. It was the primary language used by Apple to construct its early software is simple to learn.\n\n1972: Smalltalk was created by Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Dan Ingalls to allow programmers to alter code fast.\n\n1972: C, widely recognized as the very first high-level programming language, was created by Dennis Ritchie.\n\n1972: Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce created SQL for IBM. Data stored in databases may be viewed and modified using this language.\n\n1978: Cleve Moler invented MATLAB for building math programs. This terminology is employed in academic settings.\n\n1983: The primary language used to generate Apple software, Objective-C, was developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love.\n\n1983: One of the most widely used programming languages in history, C++, an outgrowth of C, was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.\n\n1987: Perl was created by Larry Wall as a scripting language for text editing to streamline the processing of reports.\n\n1990: Haskell was created as a functional programming language for managing complex mathematical operations.\n\n1991: Guido Van Rossum invented Python, a concise computer language that is simpler to understand than C++.\n\n1991: Microsoft created Visual Basic, which allowed programmers to pick and modify certain code lines using a drag-and-drop methodology.\n\n1993: R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman to help statisticians analyze data.\n\n1995: Java was created by Sun Microsystems to be utilized with portable electronics.\n\n1995: PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf primarily for web programming. Even now, PHP is still frequently used in web development.\n\n1995: Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Ruby is a popular programming language for creating Web applications.\n\n1995: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich to improve browser interactions.\n\n2000: Microsoft combined Visual Basic and C++ to create C#. In certain aspects, C# and Java are comparable.\n\n2003: Scala is a programming language that incorporates elements of functional programming, and it was developed by Martin Odersky.\n\n2003: Bob McWhirter and James Strachan created Groovy as a Java spinoff.\n\n2009: Go was created by Google to address problems that frequently arise with complex software systems.\n\n2014: Swift was created by Apple to replace C++, C, and Objective-C.\n\nToday: Since 2014, so many programming languages have appeared in the world, for instance, Zig, Ring, C++17, Fortan2018, Bosque, C++20, Microsoft Power Fx, and Carbon, but their main function is to support previously developed, standard programming languages.\n\n(Source: HP, Wikipedia)\n\nThe Most Popular Programming Languages.\n\nLastly, we will review three most popular and widely applicable programming languages of today.\n\n1.
