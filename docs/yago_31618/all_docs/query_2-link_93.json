        "text": "Matlab and C are both powerful programming languages but they serve different purposes and have distinct features. In this article, we will learn the fundamental differences between Matlab and the C language.\n\nMATLAB\n\nMATLAB stands for Matrix Laboratory and is a high-level programming language primarily used for numerical computing such as matrix manipulations, implementation of algorithms, data plotting, data analysis, and visualization. It provides an extensive set of built-in functions and toolboxes for various scientific and engineering applications.\n\nC Programming Language\n\nC is a general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency and flexibility. Developed for system programming it is widely used in software development, game development, and embedded systems and follows a procedural programming paradigm allowing direct manipulation of the memory through pointers and is known for its usage in general-purpose, portable, low-level memory access, fast speed, and clean syntax.\n\nDifference Between Matlab and C Language\n\nThe below table illustrates the key differences between MATLAB and C Language.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nMATLAB\n\nC Language\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, The MATLAB and C serve different purposes in the programming world. The MATLAB excels in mathematical modeling, simulations and data analysis, while C is a versatile language suitable for a wide range of applications from the system-level programming to application development."
