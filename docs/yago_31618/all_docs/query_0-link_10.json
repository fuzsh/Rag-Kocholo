In response to that need, they combined their expertise in mathematics, engineering, and computer science to develop MATLAB, a high-performance technical computing environment. MATLAB combines comprehensive math and graphics functions with a powerful high-level language.\n\nIn addition to MATLAB, MathWorks now develops and markets Simulink, a product for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems. The company also develops and markets an extensive set of add-on products for specialized application areas including control design, signal processing and communications, image processing, test and measurement, computational biology, and financial modeling and analysis."
