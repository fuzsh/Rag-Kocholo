In response to that need, the founders combined their expertise in mathematics, engineering, and computer science to develop MATLAB�, a high-performance technical computing environment. MATLAB� combines comprehensive math and graphics functions with a powerful high-level language\" (MathWorks Inc.).\n\nCleve Moler is Chairman and Chief Scientist at The MathWorks who, in addition to being the author of the first version of MATLAB, is one of the authors of the LINPACK and EISPACK scientific subroutine libraries created in the late 70's. LINPACK, which was written in FORTRAN, was a package of programs to be used for the solution of lenear systems and related problems. The goal of The MathWorks was to provide to students the ability to utilize those packages without having to write FORTRAN code.\n\nSignificant Language Features\n\nMATLAB� is a mathematical scripting language that looks very much like C++. Some features of the language are:\n\nEfficient matrix and vector computations\n\nEasy creation of scientific and engineering graphics\n\nApplication development, including graphical user interface building\n\nObject-oriented programming\n\nExtensibility (Tool Boxes)\n\nFile I/O functions\n\nString Processing\n\nPlatform Availability\n\nMATLAB� is available on the following platforms:\n\nDEC Alpha\n\nHP 9000\n\nIBM RS/6000\n\nPC & MAC\n\nOpen VMS\n\nSGI (Silicon Graphics)\n\nSUN Sparc\n\nAreas of Application\n\nBecause of MATLAB�'s numerous matrix and vector computation and manipulation algorithms, the software is primarily used for:\n\nProducing solutions to complex systems of equations\n\nModeling, simulation, and prototyping\n\nData analysis, exploration, and visualization\n\nSample Programs\n\nHello World\n\nMatrix Multiplication\n\nObject-Oriented Programming\n\nThe MathWorks Inc. MATLAB� Page\n\nThis site contains information about the MATLAB� software package.\n\ncomp.soft-sys.matlab\n\nThis is a MATLAB� news group accessible through DejaNews.\n\nwww.mathtools.net - This site is a technical computing portal for all scientific and engineering needs. The portal is free and contains over 20,000 useful links to technical computing programmers, covering Fortran, Excel, Java, MATLAB and others.\n\nPrinted References\n\nHanselman, Duane & Littlefield, Bruce.
