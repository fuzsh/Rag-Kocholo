Such modifications will be announced in advance during class periods and on the course web page; the student is responsible for keeping abreast of such changes.\n\nGoals and objectives of the course: This course will cover some basic topics of numerical analysis at an introductory level (see the course outline above for the list of topics to be covered). The main objective will be to have a clear understanding of the ideas and techniques underlying the numerical methods, results, and algorithms that will be presented, where error analysis plays an important role. You will then be able to use this knowledge to analyze the numerical methods and algorithms that you will encounter, and also to program them effectively on a computer. This knowledge will be useful in your future to solve various problems numerically.\n\nClass procedures: The majority of each class period will be lecture oriented. It is strongly advised to read the material to be discussed before coming to class. Therefore, if there is a difficult point, you will know beforehand where it arises, so that you can benefit from the lecture more effectively. If the point remains unclear you can always ask questions.\n\nHomework: Will be assigned weekly. Presentation of your results is very important. Scratch paper will not be accepted. Do not expect good grades if your solution to a problem is poorly communicated. Like for everything, if you cannot explain something in great details, you certainly have not fully understood it. The importance of doing homework cannot be overemphasized, most of human people learn by doing, not only by watching and/or listening.\n\nComputer languages: The predominant programming languages used in numerical analysis are Matlab and Fortran. For programming assignments, no other language will be accepted.\n\nLinux computer accounts: Linux computer accounts will be made available on the Linux network in MLH (computer lab rooms B5 and 301). You can also use the NoMachine NX Client Windows software to access your Linux computer account remotely. Accounts for students who are not majors within the Division of Mathematical Sciences will be deleted after the term has ended! Note the expiration date at the top of your Unix Account Information form. The directory for this class will be removed before the beginning of the next term! If there is anything in this directory that you would like to save, you must archive it to your own home directory.\n\nGrader: Qiwei Sheng, 255 MH, 335-0654, e-mail: qsheng@math.uiowa.edu.\n\nGrading procedures: The final grade will be based as follows:\n\nThere will be 2 tests during the semester, with each test to account for 15% of the course grade.\n\nHomework assignments will account for 30% of the course grade. Late homework will be accepted only by special permission of the instructor. The grade for your homework will be based on all homeworks minus two of your least good homeworks, for example if we have 12 homeworks it will be based on your best 10 out of 12 homeworks. Only a portion of each homework assignment may be graded, based on the availability of assistance from a grader for the course.\n\nThe final examination will account for 40% of the course grade and it will be comprehensive.\n\nThe 2 tests and final examination are open books and open notes examinations. Bring a scientific calculator. In assigning grades, plus/minus grading will be used.\n\nFinal examination: To be held on Monday, May 12, 2:15-4:15 PM in room 218 MLH. Only under exceptional circumstances will a student be permitted to shift the time of this examination. The final examination will be done with open books and open notes. Bring a scientific calculator.\n\nAdd or drop: Students wishing to add or drop this course after the official deadline must receive the approval of the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.\n\nCross enrollments : Details of the University policy of cross enrollments may be found at: http://www.uiowa.edu/~provost/deos/crossenroll.doc.\n\nNotes to student: The Department of Mathematics has offices in 14 MLH. To make an appointment to speak with the Chair of the Department, call 335-0714 or contact the Departmental Secretary in 14 MLH.\n\nAcademic Fraud: Plagiarism and any other activities that result in a student presenting work that is not his or her own are academic fraud. Academic fraud is reported to the departmental DEO and then to the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Services in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. www.clas.uiowa.edu/students/academic_handbook/ix.shtml.\n\nMaking a Suggestion or a Complaint: Students have the right to make suggestions or complaints and should first visit with the instructor, then with the course supervisor if appropriate and next with the departmental DEO. All complaints must be made within six months of the incident. www.clas.uiowa.edu/students/academic_handbook/ix.shtml#5.\n\nAccommodations for Disabilities: A student seeking academic accommodations first must register with Student Disability Services and then meet with a SDS counselor who determines eligibility for services. A student approved for accommodations should meet privately with the course instructor to arrange particular accommodations. See www.uiowa.edu/~sds/.\n\nUnderstanding Sexual Harassment: Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being of students, faculty, and staff. Visit www.sexualharassment.uiowa.edu/ for definitions, assistance, and the full policy."
