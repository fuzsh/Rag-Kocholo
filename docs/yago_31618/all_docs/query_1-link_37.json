It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation. Typical uses include: Data analysis, exploration, and visualization.”\n\nCleve Moler is chief mathematician, chairman, and cofounder of MathWorks. Moler was a professor of math and computer science for almost 20 years at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the University of New Mexico. He spent five years with two computer hardware manufacturers, the Intel Hypercube organization and Ardent Computer, before joining MathWorks full-time in 1989. In addition to being the author of the first version of MATLAB, Moler is one of the authors of the LINPACK and EISPACK scientific subroutine libraries. He is coauthor of three traditional textbooks on numerical methods and author of two online books, Numerical Computing with MATLAB and Experiments with MATLAB."
