        "text": "TOKYO, Japan, Aug 28, 2023 – The 10th International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) was held from August 20–25, 2023, in Tokyo, Japan. During ICIAM, the ICIAM Industry Prize 2023 was awarded to Cleve B. Moler for his outstanding contributions to the development of mathematical and computational tools and methods for his role in the invention of MATLAB. MATLAB is a programming environment for algorithm development, data analysis, visualization, and numeric computation and has established itself as the language of engineers and scientists.\n\nICIAM is a global event that brings together researchers, academicians, professionals, and experts from various fields of applied mathematics and related disciplines. The congress provides a platform for exchanging knowledge, ideas, and advancements in applied mathematics, as well as the application of mathematics in various scientific, engineering, industrial, and technological areas. It typically includes plenary talks by distinguished speakers, parallel sessions, poster presentations, and other scientific and social activities.\n\nMathWorks is an exhibitor at this event.\n\nFor more information, visit International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) 2023.\n\nAbout MathWorks\n\nMathWorks is the leading developer of mathematical computing software. MATLAB, the language of engineers and scientists, is a programming environment for algorithm development, data analysis, visualization, and numeric computation. Simulink is a block diagram environment for simulation and Model-Based Design of multidomain and embedded engineering systems.
