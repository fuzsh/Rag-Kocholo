        "text": "&quot;by hand&quot; mathematical models whose consequences can be simulated by running computer programs. These programs are typically written in Fortran, but are increasingly being written in C, C++, or other languages that have better tools for abstraction and data structures. In part, the computational approach we advocate involves the use of computers in that earlier &quot;by hand&quot; stage of model formulation, using symbolic mathematics. The blossoming of this area via commercial programs typified by Mathematica and Maple, as well as some less widely used but still viable competitors (Axiom, Macsyma, MuPAD) might suggests that this approach is (a) successful and (b) needs no more academic research. Actually, the relatively higher level of activity (and funding) in Europe has demonstrated that important results remain to be found in advancement of algorithms and building systems. Work at RISC-Linz (Austria), ETH (Zurich), CAN (Netherlands), INRIA (France) and the multi-nation...\n\nThe World Wide Web is now lhe de/acto environment for providing (electronic) informalion 10 the worldwide user community. With the availability of programming languages like Java, Web browsers now can handle documents with programs embedded in them. This new functionality presents opportunities for scientific computing on the World Wide Web while its realization requires addressing several new research issues including user inteiface alld prorocol design, legacy software encapsulation, security, software delivery in directly usable form, alld networked compll1ationo{ servers. In this paper we address these issues in the context ofPDE (panial Differential Equation) network computing supported by the well known problem solving environment (PSE) IIELLPACK and its networked, Web accessible, counterpart which is referred throughout as the Net /IELLPACK PSE. Using Net IIELLPACK one can solve complex PDE problems using any Web browser thal supports Java applets. The design of Net IIELLPACK...\n\nAbstract Unidata's network Common Data Form, netCDF, provides users with an ecient set of software for scienti c-data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The netCDF le format is machine-independent, direct-access, self-describing, and in the public domain, thereby alleviating many problems associated with accessing output from large hydrodynamic models. NetCDF has programming interfaces in both the Fortran and C computer language with an interface to C++ planned for release in the future."
