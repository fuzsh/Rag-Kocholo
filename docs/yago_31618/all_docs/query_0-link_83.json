        "text": "Software\n\nMatlab (Matrix Laboratory) was developed by Cleve Moler in the 1970's to make LINPACK and EISPACK, powerful linear algebra packages written in Fortran, accessible to students. It has since become a very popular interpreted programming language for numerical computing, both in academia and industry.\n\nAre you new to Matlab? Here are just a few of many tutorials and introductory texts:\n\nLecture notes by David Houcque from Northwestern\n\nT. A. Davis and K. Sigmon, MATLAB Primer , Seventh Edition, Chapman & Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, 2005\n\nD. J. Higham and N. J. Higham, MATLAB Guide, Second Edition, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2005\n\nMatlab is a proprietary language, but it is available to Auburn students (here).\n\nPython is a general purpose, free, and open-source programming language that has gained a lot of traction in recent years. Its development has greatly benefited from an active community and libraries like NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow for its effective use in scientific computing. A good introduction to Python can be found here .\n\nAnaconda is a free, cross-platform Python distribution that includes many libraries, including the ones we will need. We will work in Python 3. The distribution also includes Spyder, a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment), that looks a little like the Matlab interface.\n\nHere are a couple of good introductions to using the Python language for scientific computing:"
