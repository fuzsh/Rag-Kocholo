        "text": "Written by: Austin Bohannon, Megan Walley, Donner Hanson, and Allison Thompson\n\nhttp://bit.ly/presentMATLAB\n\nWe chose MATLAB as a language to research and present because of its useability in Mathematics and Engineering related fields. It is an old language with many features, many which are very relevant today, like it’s libraries and APIs that can use code from other languages or be integrated in other languages. It also has great features of auto-generating reliable C/C++ style code from MATLAB code which can increase the speed of the programs being used.\n\nMATLAB began as a mix of two mathematical packages written in Fortran and accessed with/at the terminal and has turned into a proper, larger program that uses multiple interfaces for scripting and graphical displays, dozens of different libraries, and allows for highly technical details. MATLAB’s primary creator is Cleve Moler, a man who still works on it today 3. However, over the last sixty years of MATLAB’s development, the program has been influenced by many people.\n\nSome of the early influencers and algorithm creators came from Moler’s early days, back when he was still a student at CalTech. He was taught by John Todd, one of the researchers and developers of the United States’ first computers: The Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC) 4. John Todd introduced Moler to mathematician George Forsythe at Stanford during Moler’s graduate years, another man who worked on the SWAC. With Forsythe, Moler worked to create a math book on matrix computations 5. In the book, algorithms were written using Fortran (and lesser known languages, like Algol and PL/l).\n\nTwo decently large programs in Fortran were created in the 1970s: EISPACK and LINPACK. EISPACK was a software library that contained methods for matrices 2. LINPACK was a software library that contained methods for linear algebra 1,2. Both libraries were worked on by similar groups of men, Moler being one of them. Moler, now a math professor at University of New Mexico, wanted to allow his students to use and play around with the software, but encountered some difficulty: Not all students wanted to learn Fortran. To make using these libraries and algorithms simpler and more interactive, Moler began development on MATLAB. It was designed to simplify the compile, run and debug loop and provide easy inputs and outputs that were more identifiable. MATLAB included portions of both EISPACK and LINPACK and utilized Fortran: Initially, there were only eighty functions and one data type – a matrix 4. It was portable and almost any computer at the time could compile it, making MATLAB fairly user friendly for the time.\n\nWhen Moler taught a class at Stanford for a little bit, he tried to incorporate MATLAB but the math and computer science students were not impressed. On the other hand, engineering students were impressed. (This juxtaposition continues on today, with MATLAB being used heavily in the engineering industry but not as much in the computer science world.) Not content with being stagnant and having MATLAB limited in its capabilities, Jack Little, a Stanford alumni who saw one of Moler’s lectures, decided that MATLAB would be perfect for technical computing 3. Little and one of his work colleagues, Steve Bangert, worked with Cleve Moler to reprogram MATLAB in C, add additional tools (such as “M-files” – a way for users to store programs), graphic resources, and libraries in order to expand the program and make it applicable on the newer IBM computers that were being developed in the early 1980s 4,5. The official version of MATLAB for the PC was released in December of 1984 at an IEEE conference.\n\nMATLAB is widely used as an applied tool for engineering, research, and academia. Companies that use MATLAB include and the typical job titles are7:\n\nBoeing - Networking Engineer\n\nMathWorks - Product Engineer - Code Gen & Verification\n\nMathWorks - Software Engineer in Test - MATLAB Settings and Serialization\n\nAmtec Inc. - Controls Engineer - MATLAB/Simulink\n\nOdyssey Consulting Services - Modeling and Simulation Programmer - Unmanned Air Traffic Control Simulation Programming\n\nTMC Technologies - Electrical Engineer with MATLAB experience\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles - Senior Model-Based Tools Engineer\n\nSparksoft - Data Scientist\n\nGDKN - Embedded Software Designer\n\nParsons - Missile Modeling and Simulation Engineer I\n\nComputer software firms account for 10% of all MATLAB licenses while academia accounts for 7% of all MATLAB licenses6.\n\nIndustry data shows that what type of companies are using MATLAB and how many companies have licenses for MATLAB use6:\n\nComputer Software: 3394\n\nHigher Education: 2295\n\nComputer Hardware: 1622\n\nStaffing and Recruiting: 1419\n\nInformation and Technology and Services: 1375\n\nFinancial Services: 955\n\nHospital and Healthcare: 931\n\nAviation and Aerospace: 775\n\nEducation Management: 754\n\nMedical Devices: 745\n\nBased by country the United States is the leading user of MATLAB. 16,000+ licenses are within the US, followed by 2,400+ licenses in the UK6.\n\nBy country and amount of companies with a MATLAB license6:\n\nUnited States : 16029\n\nUnited Kingdom : 2409\n\nIndia : 2182\n\nCanada : 1290\n\nFrance : 1042\n\nGermany : 866\n\nItaly : 593\n\nNetherlands : 543\n\nSpain : 491\n\nAustralia : 45\n\nBy staff size of company (employee amount) and amount of companies with a MATLAB license6:\n\n1-10 Employees: 2253\n\n10-50 Employees: 6967\n\n50-200 Employees: 5635\n\n200-500 Employees: 3057\n\n500-1000 Employees: 2059\n\n1000-5000 Employees: 3573\n\n5000-10000 Employees: 992\n\n>10000 Employees: 1849\n\nA majority of the companies (~58% of the companies) that use MATLAB generate less than $50 million dollars per year.\n\nMathWorks in tandem with Boeing created the guidance, navigation, control systems necessary for the X-40A reusable space vehicle. The vehicle needed to land on a runway and come to a full stop without a pilot controlling the vehicle.\n\nIn order to develop the vehicle there needed to be models and simulations of the vehicle prior to actual physical testing. In order for the vehicle to be approved for physical testing the teams had to model the simulation to account for “avionics, sensors, actuators, and controllers and validating the software development metrics and processes {of the vehicle}”8.\n\nThe result of using MATLAB in the project was that the product was modelled on time and within budget, was successful on first test flight and landing, and allowed Boeing to continue contracts for unmanned flying machines8.\n\nMATLAB can also be used in an academic setting as a teaching tool. In 2008, at the Hellenic Air Force Academy in Greece, an instructor created a MATLAB generated e-assesment GUI that would give students feedback on circuit models and on the performance of their work. If the student was satisfied with the result they could turn in the work. The students were given a circuit diagram of a simple Common-Emitter (CE) transistor amplifier. The student would perform the following:\n\nChoose Base, Emitter and Collector resistors so that the amplifier gain is 100.\n\nCalculate capacitor values so that the -3dB frequency of the circuit is 20 Hz.\n\nCalculate the currents at the Base, Emitter and Collector.\n\nThe instructor designed an application which would have a student GUI and a teacher GUI. “The student GUI prompts for the evaluated values and produces a Bode plot for assisting the student to verify his/her design before submitting the answer. This tool gives also the possibility of learning by using the trial-and-error approach.” To prevent students from guessing values associated with the project, the instructor built in a “current-results” tab in the instructors side of the GUI so they could monitor the students progress.\n\nThe instructor’s GUI offers a “batch mode” in which an excel file can be generated in order for the instructor to track progress and results of the students in the class.\n\nThe benefits of designing an application like this two-part GUI for academic excellence is quite obvious.\n\nMATLAB is used in a variety of cases. Its most frequent use is in image, data processing, and graphical representation of data in various applications including the following categories:\n\nA user may choose from a variety of machine learning models, and even fine tune them with hyperparameter optimization. MATLAB can deploy machine learning models anywhere. A user can generate C code from their MATLAB code for high performance speed with a low use of memory. Machine learning models are exportable to Simulink and the MATLAB Production Server.\n\nWith the Live Editor, a user is able to spend less time preprocessing data by easily separating noisy data from a variety of inputs, such as images, text, and sensor data10. A user may also visualize trends to easily identify data quality issues.\n\nExpertise in building deep learning models is unnecessary with MATLAB. MATLAB provides a user with visualization tools so they can more easily create, modify, and analyze deep learning architectures11.\n\nMATLAB is used to develop algorithms regarding image and video data. A user may explore camera calibration, image segmentation, and view 3D data as either volumes or 2D plane slices. MATLAB performs computer vision tasks such as object recognition, point cloud processing (measures and analyzes a 3D collection of data points), and stereo vision (depth recovery from camera triangulation)12.\n\nIt contains tools which allow a user to collaborate with teams using other languages such as OpenCV, Python, and C/C++12.\n\nA user can develop predictive models to analyze signals and sensor data, as MATLAB comes with machine learning and deep learning workflows as well as built-in signal analysis and measurement tools13.\n\nMATLAB can be used to create high level and high fidelity models to simulate component interactions, making it easy to compare designs and analyze performance impact. Models can have digital, RF, and antenna designs to optimize behavior14.\n\nMATLAB can be used to easily implement programs that can read, and adjust audio signals. This is useful in audio engineering where you may want to create a custom sound algorithm to compress or splice audio with ease15.\n\nA user may automate code generation for embedded devices in a variety of languages and deploy hardware-agnostic algorithms16. An engineer may use 3D models to consider rigid-body mechanics and actuator dynamics to design a hardware platform, and design algorithms which allow robots make choices in ambiguous situations16.\n\nMATLAB provides many design and analysis techniques such as robust control and model predictive control (which help a system deal with uncertainty), Bode diagrams (graph of a system’s frequency response), and linear algebraic tools. It may also simulate supervisory logic to perform scheduling, mode switching, and FDIR (fault detection, isolation, and recovery)17.\n\nIn embedded systems MATLAB can be used in conjunction with built in code generators (from out of the box) or with third party libraries to generate C/C++ code for optimal embedded systems code. Some examples of embedded systems are washing machines, printers, automobiles, cameras, industrial machines, etc18.\n\nSpecifically MATLAB shines when having to vectorize data through matrices using Linear Algebra. \"Linear algebra functions in MATLAB provide fast, numerically robust matrix calculations. Capabilities include a variety of matrix factorizations, linear equation solving, computation of eigenvalues or singular values, and more.\"19 MATLAB contains functions, such as mldivide, for linear algebra. mldivide is simply called using the syntax:\n\nInput: A = sparse([0 2 0 1 0; 4 -1 -1 0 0; 0 0 0 3 -6; -2 0 0 0 2; 0 0 4 2 0]); B = sparse([8; -1; -18; 8; 20]); x = A\\B Output: x = (1,1) 1.0000 (2,1) 2.0000 (3,1) 3.0000 (4,1) 4.0000 (5,1) 5.0000\n\nMATLAB is a dynamic language and it is weakly typed23. It allows for functional, imperative, and object-oriented paradigms23,24. MATLAB does not have generic types, nor does it have function overloading, though you can recreate some of these properties by taking advantage of its dynamism and weak typing23.\n\nMATLAB gets its name from the phrase “matrix laboratory,” and consequently has very strong support for matrices in the language24. As opposed to C or Java, where transforming a matrix involves for-loops over arrays, MATLAB has built in matrix data types that allow you to perform matrix operations natively. It natively allows for many kinds of matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication, transposition, and inversion25. For instance, scalar multiplication looks like this:\n\nAdditionally, MATLAB has very well-integrated support for plotting and graphing24. This is one of its major selling-points in engineering. For instance, the following graph is generated by this code:\n\nx = 0:pi/100:2*pi; y = sin(x); plot(x,y)\n\nAnd a much more complicated example is still relatively trivial26:\n\nMATLAB also has functionality for what it calls “live scripts,” which are analogous to Jupyter notebooks specifically designed for MATLAB. Live scripts give you the ability to format text, comments, and images inline with running code27.\n\nAs mentioned, MATLAB also has extensive support for interaction with other programming languages. You can easily call code written in C/C++, Fortran, Java, Python, and .NET, or call MATLAB from one of those languages28. These are all very important languages in engineering and data analytics, which are also the market for MATLAB, making interoperability with these languages very attractive.\n\nIn conclusion, MATLAB is an incredibly versatile program that’s excellent for testing conditions, especially when outcomes that go wrong could be deadly or expensive in the real world. Not only is it great for engineers and researchers, but it’s also a good language for students to learn because it allows them to get experience with multiple paradigms without needing to learn multiple languages. It’s extensive APIs and applications in successful companies around the globe also makes MATLAB a good language to learn for resumes and job opportunities. Overall, we feel that MATLAB was worth researching and is worth spending a little bit more time on for those looking to expand their computer science knowledge."
