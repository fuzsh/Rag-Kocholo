        "text": "What does MATLAB mean?\n\nMATLAB software is a registered trademark, multi-model programming language, and numerical computing environmental system created by MathWorks. 'MATLAB' is the short-form of \"Matrix Laboratory\". The MATLAB software permits the utilization of matrix operations, graphical representation of data, execution of algorithms, development of user interface, and linking programs created in other languages. Even though MATLAB is developed mainly for numerical computing, there is an optional toolbox that uses a symbolic engine known as MuPAD giving access to all the symbolic computing abilities. In addition to this, a Simulink package delivers graphical multi-domain simulation and design that is model-based for embedded and dynamic systems. MATLAB users are spread worldwide across the world and use MATLAB extensively.\n\nMathWorks is an American-based private company that practices exclusively in the mathematical domain of computer software. The prime developments of MathWorks include MATLAB and Simulink that favor Data Analysis and Simulation. It also uses the principles of Machine Learning, algorithm development, Deep Learning, and so on.\n\nHistory\n\nMATLAB was discovered by a computer coder and a mathematician called Cleve Moler. He initiated the creation of MATLAB for his students after receiving a post of a math professor at the University of New Mexico. Later, he became the chairman of the computer science department in the same university. Earlier MATLAB versions were easy matrix calculators when they were given to university students. Moler thought to use MATLAB software to create the MATLAB programming language. The software was liked typically by the math section of the campus-wide universities. Moler and John together concluded to reprogram MATLAB in C programming language, created the MATLAB programming language, placed toolbox features, and sold it to IBM who were changing the outlook of computers at that time.\n\nMathWorks company was established to make the MATLAB programming language. MathWorks corporation sold their first 10 copies to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and after a couple of years down the line, John, along with the company relocated to Massachusetts and appointed a well-experienced computer executive to assist the regulation of the business. Towards the end of the 1980s, hundreds of MATLAB copies were sold for student use to universities and gained popularity primarily due to the development of toolboxes. MATLAB was again redrafted for the prior operating systems made by Sun Microsystems, VAX, and so on. Simultaneously, after updating and making newer versions, Simulink’s functionality was amplified by rewriting the user interface. Generally, MATLAB software includes “Command window” usage for performing text files comprising of the MATLAB code. MATLAB programs comprise structure datatypes and all the variables in MATLAB are arrays. Due to this, it is renamed suitably as a structure array along with supporting dynamic text and field names.\n\nMATLAB and other languages\n\nMATLAB may demonstrate subroutines as well as functions written in programming languages like C or Fortran. MATLAB data types can be returned or passed by using a wrapper function. On compilation of such functions, MEX files (object files loading dynamically) are produced. Also, Python was added recently along with the latest technical updates. The .net extension can be directly associated with MATLAB. Complexity increases if calling MATLAB from JAVA but is feasible by the usage of a MATLAB toolbox that is retailed discretely or can be accessed through JMI (JAVA-to-MATLAB Interface). MATLAB can be attached to Maple or Mathematica as substitutes to the MuPAD symbolic math toolbox. Currently, MATLAB is the most famous numerical computer software package in the commercial world.\n\nRecently, in 2020, media of Chinese claimed that MATLAB by MathWorks had taken out services from two universities of China as US sanctions result and in response, proclaimed to rise the open-source replacements and produce domestic substitutes.\n\nPractice Problems\n\n1. What are the two lead development projects made by MathWorks?\n\nMATLAB and Simulink\n\nEISPACK and 中国\n\nMuPAD and MAT-files\n\nSite Performance and MathWorks\n\nCorrect option- a\n\nExplanation: The two lead development projects made by MathWorks are MATLAB and Simulink\n\n2. MATLAB used a symbolic math toolbox initially known as-\n\nMathWorks\n\nMuPAD\n\nStateflow\n\nData Acquisition Toolbox\n\nCorrect option- b\n\nExplanation: MATLAB used a symbolic math toolbox initially known as MuPAD.\n\n3. What is the file name of the .m file extension in MATLAB?\n\nMAT-file\n\nEISPACK\n\nM-file\n\nMathWorks\n\nCorrect option- c\n\nExplanation: The file name of the .m file extension in MATLAB is M-file.\n\n4. Which of the following statements is incorrect?\n\nMATLAB was discovered by a computer coder and a mathematician called Cleve Moler.\n\nSimulink is a graphical and simulation software for model-based design.\n\nMATLAB also favors creating a graphical user interface (GUI) which can be produced either through coding or by visualization aids or software.\n\nThe two types of M-files are scripts and variables.\n\nCorrect option- d\n\nExplanation: The two types of M-files are scrips and functions.\n\n5. Which of the following is false?\n\nMATLAB is the most famous numerical computer software package in the commercial world.\n\nIn 2020, the media of Chinese claimed that MATLAB had taken out services from two universities of China as a US sanctions result.\n\nMATLAB was invented by John Little.\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, hundreds of MATLAB copies were sold for students use to universities and gained popularity primarily due to the development of toolboxes.\n\nCorrect option- c\n\nExplanation: MATLAB was invented by Cleve Moler."
