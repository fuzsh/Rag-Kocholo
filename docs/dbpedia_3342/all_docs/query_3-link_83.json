        "text": "LAKE FOREST– Mike Simpson has contributed 25 years of his life to the Boy Scouts.\n\nHe joined Cub Scouts while in elementary school and after moving to California, joined Troop 164 in the San Gabriel Valley Council. There, he became a Life Scout and served as patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader and senior patrol leader.\n\nSimpson then moved to Colorado where he completed his Eagle project -a community clean-up day along a canal in a southwestern Denver suburb.\n\nHe has served as scoutmaster, assistant scoutmaster, and committee chair and charter organization representative. Now, he mentors boys working toward the Eagle rank.\n\nThe Orange County Council, Boy Scouts of America recently recognized 20 of its top volunteers at the annual Silver Beaver Awards Dinner to acknowledge volunteer achievements. Simpson was one of them.\n\nThis is what he had to say about his involvement with the Boy Scouts:\n\nQ. Why did you choose to be involved with Boy Scouts?\n\nA.As a youth I was a Boy Scout and Cub Scout and I earned the rank of Eagle Scout. My parents encouraged me to join. It’s been about 25 years total as a youth and adult involved in the organization.\n\nQ. What propels you to still be involved and volunteer?\n\nA.I got involved as an adult leader when my boys joined the Boys Scouts. I have two sons who are Eagle Scouts. I just feel like scouting helped me as a youth and it’s kind of a way to pay back the benefits that I got from being a scout. Mostly I work with Eagle Scout candidates and a group of volunteers. I basically help youth plan their campouts and activities as a scoutmaster.\n\nQ. Did the Boy Scouts mold you into the person you are today?\n\nA.I’m involved with Boy Scouts because it helps young men build character and values through service to the community and their church.\n\nQ. What are some of your fondest memoires as a scout?\n\nA.The hiking and campouts with the youth and the 12 summer camps that I have attended are some memorable moments. Most of those are weeklong camps.\n\nQ. What does the recognition mean to you?\n\nA.I’m very honored to be nominated and with these other 19 people. It’s very humbling to be in that group. I still see the values. I still have a positive influence in the youth in Orange County.\n\nQ. How often do you volunteer?\n\nA.At least a couple of evenings a week. I’m always involved in it, just using my spare time."
