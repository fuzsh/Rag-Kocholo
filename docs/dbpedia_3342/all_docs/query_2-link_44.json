        "text": "“Jack Nelsen is a third generation Idaho farmer and has a long history of advancing education in Idaho. His service to Idaho is why he will be a great legislator and common-sense conservative. Idahoans in District 26 are lucky to have someone with Jack’s experience running to represent the most pressing needs of Idahoans. I am proud to endorse Jack Nelsen and encourage you to vote for him.”\n\n-Former Governor C. L. \"Butch” Otter\n\n“We have known Jack Nelsen since grade school and we can say with confidence that he is a kind, caring and generous person. We graduated from high school together in 1974 then pursued avenues in the agricultural area.\n\nFrom all our business and personal dealings, we have found Jack to be fair, trustworthy and honest.\n\nJack's knowledge of agricultural issues is extensive with owning and operating a dairy north of Jerome for many years. His life has been dedicated to service of his community as he served on the CSI Board of Directors for many years and also on Jerome County Planning and Zoning.\n\nJack and his wife Emily along with their family have been lifelong residents of Idaho making our communities better by their contributions.\n\nWe would highly encourage our voters in District 26 to consider and vote for Jack Nelsen for the position of State Representative.”\n\n- Reed & Colleen Crozier\n\n\"Jack Nelsen is exactly the kind of common-sense Republican who will use his ability to work with people across the political spectrum on policy solutions that will improve the economy, reduce the inflation, and strengthen our schools to prepare Idahoans for the bright future ahead of us.\n\nHe has my full endorsement and I know he will be the right leader to confront the many challenges facing our great state.\"\n\n- Congressman Mike Simpson\n\n\"I am honored to endorse Jack Nelsen for the Idaho House of Representatives District 26B. It's been wonderful getting to know him and his family over this past year. He truly has a passion for people.\n\nJack is knowledgeable on topics that impact our communities and if he comes across something unfamiliar, he takes the time to discuss it with constituents and learn more.\n\nHe cares deeply for our communities and I have full trust that he will support and represent my family's interests well.\"\n\n- Katy Starr\n\n\"We’ve known Jack Nelsen and his family for several years and believe he is an excellent candidate for Idaho House of Representatives District 26B.\n\nAs a retired dairy farmer, he recognizes the value of agriculture to our state’s economy and acknowledges water as Idaho’s most valuable natural resource.\n\nHe is a College of Southern Idaho board member and former educator who supports a strong education system and understands the roles of students, parents and teachers in that system.\n\nJack’s long tenure as a Jerome County Planning and Zoning commissioner helps him see that regulating control of communities from Boise is ill advised and he will be an advocate of local control.\n\nWe know him to be a well-rounded, common sense conservative who will not be swayed by a special interest group.\n\nWe are pleased to give our voice of support for Jack Nelsen for House seat 26B.\"\n\n- David and Bernice Davis\n\n\"Legislative District 26 will be well served with Jack Nelsen as our state representative. From Galena Summit to the Perrine Bridge, he gets the dynamic and diverse needs of Blaine, Lincoln and Jerome counties.\n\nAfter many years on Planning & Zoning and now Trustee for the College of Southern Idaho, Jack has always been fair, honest and willing to listen to all sides of an issue.\n\nJack’s leadership experience coupled with his rural sensibilities and objective approach make him the ideal candidate for our new district. I am confident in the results Jack Nelsen will yield for the people of Idaho and proud to support his bid to the statehouse for District 26 State Representative, Seat B.\"\n\n- Samantha Marshall\n\n\"I am honored to have an opportunity to voice my support for Jack Nelsen for the House of Representatives, District 26, Seat B. Jack has wide knowledge of the needs of education from the classroom and the boardroom. He knows land and water issues and has been very active in serving the community.\n\nJack will be a strong voice for conservative values, fiscally responsible to the taxpayer, and responsive to their concerns.\"\n\n- Maxine Bell\n\n“I endorse Jack Nelsen for the Idaho House of Representatives District 26 seat B. I believe Jack Nelsen has the qualities and temperament required for service in the Idaho House.\n\nJack is honest, a hard worker, attentive to detail and a good listener.\n\nJack has a servant’s heart, is a quick learner and when seeking a solution to a problem will consider all aspects of an issue.\n\nJack will find solutions that are best for the citizens he represents.\n\nIt is without reservation that I endorse Jack Nelsen for this position.”\n\n- Clark Kauffman\n\nDist. 25 Idaho House of Representatives\n\n\"I encourage you to re-elect Representative Jack Nelsen because he has served the people of our district well. He’s not afraid of a fight, wants to do the right thing with commonsense and a willingness to find consensus.\n\nHe carried and helped pass House Bill 1361 which requires local school boards to allow public comments at their meetings. He also carried the unanimously-passed resolution in opposition to the proposed Lava Ridge Wind Energy project that would be an environmental and economic disaster for the Magic Valley.\"\n\nJulie Lynn\n\nKetchum\n\n\"To my friends in the Wood River and Magic Valleys, you could not do better than to have Jack Nelsen serve as your voice in the Idaho Legislature.\n\nJack understand the critical water issues vital to this part of Idaho.\n\nHe’s also a persuasive voice for education that meets the needs of parents, both to safeguard futures for the next generation, and to update needed skills in today’s workplace.\n\nHe has my full and unequivocal endorsement, and has earned your vote.\"\n\n-- Trent Clark\n\nFormer Director of Idaho’s USDA Farm Service Agency, former Chair of the Idaho Republican Party, former Chair of the Idaho Workforce Development Council"
