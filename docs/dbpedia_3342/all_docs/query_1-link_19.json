        "text": "Washington University in St. Louis\n\nMichael Keith \"Mike\" Simpson, D.M.D. (born September 8, 1950), is the member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing Idaho's 2nd congressional district, serving since 1999. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the Idaho House of Representatives.\n\nSimpson was educated at Utah State University in Logan, Utah, and the Washington University School of Dental Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. Simpson practiced dentistry in Blackfoot, Idaho, before entering the U.S. House. While other members of Congress who come from a medical background prefer to be referred to as \"Doctor\" while serving in Congress (most notably former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist), Simpson does not insist that he be referred to as Dr. Simpson, preferring to simply go by Congressman or Mr. Simpson."
