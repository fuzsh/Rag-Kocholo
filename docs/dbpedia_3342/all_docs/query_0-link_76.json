I oppose abortion as means of birth control and believe that exceptions should be limited to cases of rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is in danger. Furthermore, I believe adoption is a viable alternative to abortion. As such, I have supported efforts to curb the practice of abortion while serving in the House of Representatives. I support legislation that creates a government wide prohibition on any taxpayer funding of abortion and provides for conscience protections for physicians employed by the federal government.\n\nThat is why I supported H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act which would prohibit public funding of abortion in all federal programs and make permanent the Hyde Amendment which prohibits such funding."
