        "text": "Terri Lee Wilbur Simpson, a beloved wife, mother, and daughter, peacefully passed away at the age of 65 in her home on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Caldwell, Idaho. Her warm, gentle soul left an everlasting mark on all who knew and loved her. Her kind words, tender presence, and genuine care made everyone feel cherished.\n\nBorn on May 14th, 1959, to Wayne Edward and Mada Margaret Wilbur in Tacoma, Washington, Terri was the first child of the Wilbur family and the oldest of five siblings. Her early childhood was filled with joyful memories of playing and mischief with her siblings and cousins in Washington. She often spoke fondly of those wonderful years. At eleven, she and her family moved to Idaho, where she took on caring for her siblings while her mother worked hard to provide for the family and her father struggled with many disabling health issues—these formative years taught her the values of responsibility and hard work.\n\nTerri married her forever sweetheart, Mark Cole Simpson, on October 27, 1977, at the Idaho Falls temple for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Together, they raised two beautiful children to whom she devoted her life. Being a mother was her greatest joy; she poured all her love and care into her family.\n\nShe was a woman of remarkable creativity and talent. Whether painting, scrapbooking, sewing, making jewelry, or cooking, Terri loved creating beautiful things and sharing them with the world. Her entrepreneurial spirit thrived as she spent years making and selling her creations, leaving a trail of beauty wherever she went.\n\nDespite numerous health challenges that caused her daily pain, Terri continued to spread love and compassion to everyone she met. Her unwavering strength, perseverance, and kindness serve as a lasting influence on those closest to her. She put her heart and soul into everything she did, from hosting memorable parties to wholeheartedly serving in her Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints community.\n\nHer faith was a cornerstone of her life, and she passed on the values of prayer, faith, and reliance on God to her children. Terri’s life was a testament to love, service, and creation, leaving an indelible impact on her survivors: her husband, Mark Cole Simpson; children, Michael James Simpson and Cassie Lyn Hughes; daughter-in-law, Kimberly Kala Simpson, and son-in-law, David Michael Hughes; grandchildren Madison Ann Hughes, Calvin Cole Hughes, Luke Xavier Simpson, and Jade Ember Simpson; mother, Mada Margaret Carruth Wilbur; sisters, Tammi Lyn Preston and Taffi Luv Pugh; brother, William Craig Wilbur; and many nieces and nephews. She has now joined her father, Wayne Edward Wilbur, her brother, Wayne Edward Wilbur Jr., her grandparents, as well as a miscarried child and grandchild in a joyful reunion beyond the veil.\n\nA service to honor Terri’s life will be held at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 5409 S Montana Avenue in Caldwell, Idaho, on Saturday, June 29th, 2024, at 10:30 AM. A prior viewing will be held at 9:30 AM in the same location.\n\nClick here to view a webcast of the service on 6/29/2024 at 12:00 PM, Mountain Standard Time.\n\nClick here to view a webcast of the service on 6/29/2024 at 02:45 PM, Mountain Standard Time."
