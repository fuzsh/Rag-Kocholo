        "text": "Republican voters in Idaho’s 2nd Congressional District sent incumbent U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson to victory in Tuesday’s Republican primary election, granting him a chance to defend his seat in November’s general election.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Simpson against two Republican challengers at 10:07 p.m.\n\nSimpson, 73, of Idaho Falls, seeks his 14th term dating to his first congressional election win in 1998. He faced GOP challengers Scott Cleveland, 62, of Garden City, and Sean Higgins, 40, of Boise, for the right to represent the Republican Party for the federal district that includes East Idaho and part of Boise.\n\n“It’s always very rewarding to have your constituents support you and think that you’re doing a decent job,” Simpson said in a phone interview with the Idaho Statesman on Tuesday night from Washington, D.C.\n\nWith 79.5% of precincts reporting at least partial results in Idaho’s 44 counties, Simpson had a commanding lead with 54.6% of votes counted. Cleveland placed second with 36%, and Higgins was third with 9.5% of votes. Polls in the 26 Idaho counties that make up the 2nd Congressional District closed at 8 p.m. Mountain time.\n\nResults are expected to trickle in into Wednesday morning. Should he win in November, Simpson said, he would make passing an agriculture-immigration reform bill and securing the U.S.-Mexico border his top priorities — working on them with whomever is the president.\n\n“That is one of the biggest challenges facing every state in the country,” Simpson said of the southern border. “We’re all border states now, and, in fact, when we do polling on issues and stuff like that, even in Idaho, the southern border is the No. 1 issue.”\n\nSimpson, a retired dentist by trade, held a wide advantage for the three Republican candidates in campaign fundraising and spending, according to his latest federal election filings.\n\nSimpson reported more than $1 million in fundraising from January 2023 through April and spending of about $572,000.\n\nHe had about $611,000 of cash still on hand for the general election, the election reports showed. Among Simpson’s largest donors, he counts the Dairy Farmers of America, the sugar and mining industries, several Native American tribes and a handful of political action committees for health care and dental-related groups.\n\nCleveland, who was endorsed by the Bonneville County Republican Party over Simpson on the incumbent’s home turf, was second in fundraising. He reported more than $100,000 in contributions, including $50,000 in personal donations to his campaign, and about $84,000 in spending, the federal election reports showed.\n\nHiggins reported about $5,400 in fundraising through April, including a $5,000 personal loan to his campaign. He spent $1,000 on his campaign over that time.\n\nThe winner of Tuesday night’s Republican primary advances to November’s general election to face David Roth, 43, of Idaho Falls, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn early returns, he had received nearly 14,000 Democratic votes. Roth reported about $61,000 in fundraising toward the race from January 2023 through this April, according to federal election filings.\n\nHis total haul to date is just a tenth of the cash Simpson still has available for the general election. “He’s always going to outraise us, there’s no question about that,” Roth told the Statesman by phone Tuesday night from Idaho Falls. “As with everything, we’re going to win votes door by door, voter by voter and actually talk to people about the issues, and really that’s the only way that we can compete. He can simply buy votes; we’re simply going to have to earn them.”\n\nLibertarian candidate Todd Corsetti counted nearly 300 votes in early returns and perennial Idaho candidates Idaho Law-Carta Sierra and Pro-Life, formerly known as Marvin Richardson, were duking it out for the Constitution Party nomination.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
