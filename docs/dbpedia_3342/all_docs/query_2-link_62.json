        "text": "Update: June 27, 2012\n\nCongressman Mike Simpson has withdrawn his proposed new rider which the story below is about. He said he is going to try to bring people together in a roundtable soon. He also said his new rider had amplified the rhetoric on the issue which was not what he wanted. Ralph Maughan\n\n– – – – –\n\nCongressman Mike Simpson of Idaho has added an amendment to the 2013 Interior Appropriations Bill which passed yesterday out of the House Interior and the Environment Appropriations Subcommittee which he chairs. The rider effectively stops the Forest Service and the BLM from implementing any further restrictions on domestic sheep grazing in areas of high risk for contact with bighorn sheep. But, more specifically, it coddles just two domestic sheep ranchers on the Payette National Forest who are facing further cuts in the third phase of grazing closures on the Payette National Forest.\n\nOne of the permittees who will benefit from this move is Soulen Livestock Company, owned in part by Margaret Soulen-Hinson, the president of the American Sheep Industry Association, and Teresa Little, the wife of Lieutenant Governor Brad Little. Between 1995 and 2010, Soulen Livestock Co received government subsidy payments totaling $1,246,818.\n\nThis move comes after a court ruling last week which let the second phase of the Payette Decision move forward. The decision closes 70% of the sheep grazing on the Payette National Forest in central Idaho and was a result of years of scientific study and more than 15,000 comments from the public.\n\nThis move clearly contradicts what Simpson has said in the past about his reasoning for the language he inserted in last year’s 2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act. In a letter to a constituent, and on his own website, Simpson explained that the language of this rider would not affect the Payette Decision and was only intended to prevent the grazing plan on the Payette from being implemented elsewhere for one year.\n\nI have heard from a number of individuals who are concerned about this issue, and I believe it is important to clarify a few points.\n\nFirst, at this point the only place where grazing allotments have been closed is on the Payette National Forest. This language simply prevents the grazing plan on the Payette to be implemented elsewhere for one year. Under the language, the current status on the Payette meets the viability criteria for bighorn sheep.\n\nSimpson was also interviewed for Idaho Public Television’s Dialogue program in October of 2011 where he says:\n\n“It doesn’t overturn the decision that was made on the Payette Forest. Some people think it does. It doesn’t reverse that decision, that decision still stays in place. What we’re essentially saying is ‘Don’t use that decision to then make planning in other forests around the country’.”\n\nSimpson made it clear that last year’s rider was not intended to change the implementation of the Payette Decision. However, in an article that appeared in the Capital Press, Nikki Watts, communications director for Mike Simpson, said\n\n“Judge Winmill’s decision did not follow congressional intent. Congressman Simpson’s provision was meant to freeze grazing as it currently existed, not as it was planned to be reduced by the forest.”\n\nWhich is it? Either way, the intent of Simpson’s language is to bypass science and the public process to benefit his elite political friends in Idaho and elsewhere.\n\nThere is no longer any debate that domestic sheep transmit deadly disease to bighorn sheep when they come into contact. They simply cannot co-exist on the same landscape and the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) Wild Sheep Working Group has issued recommendations which specifically recommend that the agencies “[m]anage domestic sheep or goat grazing to achieve effective separation, reduce risk of association, and avoid range overlap with wild sheep.” That’s what the Payette Decision does and that is what Simpson’s rider keeps the agencies from doing.\n\nThese recommendations aren’t simply a theoretical exercise to protect just a few bighorn sheep, they are to protect entire herds of bighorn which have recently suffered large, all-age die-offs across the West. During the winter of 2009/2010, 9 populations of bighorn sheep experienced die-offs in 5 western states and approximately 890 bighorn sheep died. WAFWA has issued a report which outlines these events which you can read here.\n\nThis is the text of Section 423 of the 2013 Fiscal Year Interior Appropriations Bill\n\nDOMESTIC LIVESTOCK GRAZING\n\nSEC. 423. (a) PROHIBITION REGARDING POTENTIAL DOMESTIC SHEEP AND BIGHORN SHEEP CONTACT ON NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LAND.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, including the Record of Decision signed on July 20, 2010 for the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, (other than the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and regulations issued under such Act), none of the funds made available by this Act or made available by any other Act for fiscal year 2013 only may be used to carry out—\n\n(1) any management restrictions on domestic heep on parcels of National Forest System land (as defined in the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1609(a))) and public lands (as defined in section 103 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702)) with potential domestic sheep and bighorn sheep (whether native or nonnative) contact in excess of the management restrictions that were being implemented on July 1, 2011; or\n\n(2) any other agency regulation for managing bighorn sheep populations on any allotment of such National Forest System land if the management action will result in a reduction in the number of do-mestic livestock permitted to graze on the allotment or in the distribution of livestock on the allotment.\n\n(b) EXCEPTION.—Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Secretary of Agriculture may make such management changes as the Secretary determines to be necessary to manage bighorn sheep if the management changes—\n\n(1) are consistent with the wildlife plans of the relevant State fish and game agency and determined in consultation with that agency; and\n\n(2) are developed in consultation with the affected permittees.\n\n(c) VOLUNTARY CLOSURE OF ALLOTMENTS.—Noth13 ing in this section shall be construed as limiting the voluntary closure of existing domestic sheep allotments when the closure is agreed to in writing between the permittee and the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture and is carried out for the purpose of reducing conflicts between domestic sheep and bighorn sheep.\n\n(d) WAIVER OF GRAZING PERMITS AND LEASES.— The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture may accept the voluntary waiver of any valid existing lease or permit authorizing grazing on National Forest System land described in subsection (a) or public lands described in subsection (c). If the grazing permit or lease for a grazing allotment is only partially within the area of potential domestic sheep and bighorn sheep contact, the affected permittee may elect to waive only the portion of the grazing permit or lease that is within that area. The Secretary concerned shall—\n\n(1) terminate each permit or lease waived or portion of a permit or lease waived under this subsection;\n\n(2) ensure a permanent end to domestic sheep grazing on the land covered by the waived permit or lease or waived portion of the permit or lease unless or until there is no conflict with bighorn sheep management; and (3) provide for the reimbursement of range improvements in compliance with section 4 of the Act of June 28, 1934 (commonly known as the Taylor Grazing Act; 43 U.S.C. 315c)."
