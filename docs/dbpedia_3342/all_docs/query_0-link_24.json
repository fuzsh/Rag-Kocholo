        "text": "Facts About Idaho Back to the top\n\nName—Originally suggested for Colorado, the name 'Idaho' was used for a steamship which traveled the Columbia River. With the discovery of gold on the Clearwater River in 1860, the diggings began to be called the Idaho mines. 'Idaho' is a coined or invented word, and is not a derivation of an Indian phrase 'E Dah Hoe (How)' supposedly meaning 'gem of the mountains.'\n\nNickname—The Gem State\n\nMotto—'Esto Perpetua' (Let it be perpetual)\n\nDiscovered—In 1805\n\nOrganized as Territory—March 4, 1863, act signed by President Lincoln\n\nEntered Union—July 3, 1890, 43rd state to join the Union\n\nGeography Back to the top\n\nLand Area—83,557 square miles, 14th in area size\n\nWater Area—880 square miles\n\nHighest Point—The summit of Mount Borah is12,662 feet above sea level. It's located in Custer County in the Lost River Range\n\nLowest Point—The Snake River at Lewiston is 770 feet above sea level\n\nLength—479 Miles\n\nWidth—305 miles at widest point\n\nGeographic Center—Settlement of Custer on the Yankee Fork River, Custer County\n\nNumber of Lakes—More than 2,000\n\nNavigable Rivers—Snake, Coeur d'Alene, St. Joe, St. Maries and Kootenai\n\nLargest Lake—Lake Pend Oreille, 180 square miles\n\nTemperature Extremes—Highest, 118 degrees at Orofino July 28, 1934; Lowest, -60 degrees at Island Park Dam, January 18, 1943\n\nPopulation (in 2010)—1,567,582\n\nState Bird Back to the top\n\nThe Mountain Bluebird (sialia arctcia) was adopted as the state bird for Idaho by the state legislature in 1931. The Bluebird is about seven inches long, has an azure blue coat and a blue breast with white underfeathers. The mother bird wears a quiet blue grey dress and usually lays six or seven blue-white eggs. The Bluebird's nest is usually built in a hollow tree or crevice. The Bluebird is very neat about it's home and carries all refuse some distance from the nest.\n\nState Fish Back to the top\n\nThe Cutthroat Trout was designated the state fish by the 1990 legislature. The Cutthroat, along with the Rainbow and Bull Trout, is native to Idaho. The body color varies with the back ranging from steel grey to olive green. The sides may be yellow brown with red or pink along the belly. The Cutthroat's name comes from the distinctive red to orange slash on the underside of its lower jaw.\n\nState Flower Back to the top\n\nThe Syringa (Philadelphus Lewisii) was designated the state flower of Idaho by the legislature in 1931. It is a branching shrub with clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The blossoms are similar to the mock orange, have four petals, and the flowers grow at the ends of short, leafy branches.\n\nState Gemstone Back to the top\n\nAdopted by the 1967 Legislature, the Idaho Star Garnet is treasured throughout the world by collectors. This stone is considered more precious than either Star Rubies or Star Sapphires. Normally the star in the Idaho Garnet has four rays, but occasionally one has six rays as in a sapphire. The color is usually dark purple or plum, and the star seems to glide or float across the dark surface.\n\nState Horse Back to the top\n\nThe Appaloosa is an intelligent, fast, and hard working breed. An easygoing disposition and exceptional abilities give this horse a great deal of versatility that no doubt contributes to its rapidly rising popularity. Once the warhorses of the Nez Perce, today the Appaloosa serves as a race horse, in parades, ranch work, and youth programs. The coloring of the Appaloosa's coat is distinct in every individual horse and ranges from white blanketed hips to a full leopard.\n\nState Insect Back to the top\n\nThe Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus) was adopted as the state insect by the state legislature in 1992. The Monarch Butterfly is a unique insect. It is a great migrator, traveling many miles during its lifetime, which can be from a few weeks up to a year. Monarchs go through a complete metamorphosis in three to six weeks.\n\nIdaho's Ten Largest Cities Back to the top\n\nBoise: 205,707 (2009)\n\nNampa: 81,241 (2009)\n\nMeridian: 68,516 (2009)\n\nIdaho Falls: 55,312 (2009)\n\nPocatello: 55,076 (2009)\n\nCoeur d'Alene: 43,805 (2009)\n\nCaldwell: 43,281 (2009)\n\nTwin Falls: 42,741 (2009)\n\nLewiston: 31,887(2009)\n\nRexburg: 28856 (2009)\n\nLink to Idaho's Cities and Counties\n\nIdaho's Major Industries Back to the top\n\n#1 Manufacturing\n\n#2 Health Care\n\n#3 Tourism\n\n#4 Agriculture\n\n#5 Food Processing\n\n#6 Timber\n\n#7 Mining\n\nIdaho is Number One in the Nation in the Production of: Back to the top\n\nPotatoes\n\nTrout\n\nAustrian Winter Peas\n\nLentils\n\nCity Designations Back to the top\n\nArco - First City Lit by Atomic Energy, July, 1955\n\nAshton - First Dog Sled Race in the Lower 48\n\nBoise - Idaho's City of Trees\n\nBlackfoot - Potato Capital of the World\n\nBuhl - Trout Capital of the World\n\nBruneau - Tallest Free-Standing Sand Dunes in America\n\nCoeur d'Alene - Idaho's All-American City\n\nCraters of the Moon - Lava Rock Capital\n\nElk River - Western White Pine Capital\n\nFranklin - Oldest Settlement in Idaho\n\nHagerman - World's Oldest Horse Fossil\n\nHells Canyon - America's Deepest Gorge\n\nKooskia - Elk Capital of the World\n\nLast Chance - Fly Fishing Capital\n\nLewiston - First City incorporated in Idaho\n\nMoscow - Pea & Lentil Capital of the World\n\nRiggins & Salmon - Whitewater Capitals of the World\n\nSalmon River - River of No Return\n\nSun Valley - America's First Ski Resort\n\nTwin Falls - Evel Kneivel Jump Site of 1974\n\nWallace & Kellogg- Largest Silver Mines in the U.S.\n\nMovies Made In Idaho Back to the top\n\n\"Told in the Hills\" (Priest Lake), 1919\n\n\"Northwest Passage\" (McCall), 1939\n\n\"Bus Stop\" (near Ketchum), 1956\n\n\"Breakheart Pass\" (Lewiston), 1976\n\n\"Bronco Billy\" (Boise), 1979\n\n\"Heaven's Gate\" (Wallace), 1979\n\n\"Pale Rider\" (Sawtooth Mountains), 1984\n\n\"Talent for the Game\" (Genesee), 1991\n\n\"Dark Horse\" (Wood River Valley), 1992\n\n\"Dante's Peak\" (Wallace),1996\n\n\"Napoleon Dynamite\" (Preston), 2004\n\nIdaho Words of Wisdom Back to the top\n\n\" Is there contentment beyond the confines of urban living?
