        "text": "May 21st is critical to the entire Idaho dairy industry; dairy producers, dairy processors, our employees and the rural communities we operate within. On May 21st we will have an opportunity to vote for Congressman Simpson who has demonstrated his understanding of the needs of the dairy industry through actions.\n\nCongressman Simpson’s support for the dairy industry has been unwavering and starts with his involvement in the formation of the bipartisan Congressional Dairy Farmer Caucus, which he co-chairs. Here are a few other ways he has served Idaho’s dairy industry:\n\nThrough his seniority on the Appropriations Committee, he has reigned in the EPA by limiting their unnecessary funding and has continuously advocated to limit EPA’s regulatory overreach.\n\nHe sponsored the reintroduction of the DAIRY PRIDE Act, which would require the FDA to take enforcement action against manufacturers mislabeling dairy imitators as milk.\n\nHe secured funding in FY23 & FY24 ($3 million overall) for the Idaho Center for Agriculture, Food, and the Environment (CAFE). CAFE is a dairy research center with a goal to support Idaho’s dairy industry through environmental research.\n\nSome of the most difficult and needed work Congressman Simpson has engaged in centers around immigration reform. He successfully negotiated across party lines and helped find the votes to pass the Farm Workforce Modernization Act out of the House in 2019 and 2021. While the legislation has not moved in the Senate, it serves as the basis for all immigration reform related negotiations going forward.\n\nI will be voting for Congressman Mike Simpson on May 21. He follows through on his commitments, takes the time to understand what is important to Idaho agriculture and does the difficult work, even when it is unpopular.\n\nRick Naerebout\n\nKimberly"
