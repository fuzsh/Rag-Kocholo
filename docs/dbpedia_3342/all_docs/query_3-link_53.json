        "text": "Simpson Family\n\nMike thas always had a passion for wildlife and the outdoors. It was this passion that led him to create Conroe Taxidermy LP in 1972. What began as a way to scrape together a few extra dollars has grown to the largest taxidermy facility in the southern U.S. and one of the biggest in the nation. Now, a family business with his sons Michael, Travis and Barret, Mike attributes their business’ growth to hard work, attention to detail, and craftmanship.\n\n“Having actually hunted the animals helps us create a better mount.” Simpson said. “We are known around the world becuase of our quality and creating works of art to last a lifetime.”\n\nAlong with his very successful business life, Mike has also contributed countless hours to Safari Club International and its many conservation efforts worldwide. He is a Life Member and served as President of this prestigious organization. In past years, Mike has served as Director at Large, Vice President, and also served on the Trophy Records Committee for over 15 years. He has measured more animals for the Record Book than any other measurer, and has acted as a Master Measurer since it began in 1977. He has hunted six continents, collecting more than 350 species with most qualifying for the Record Book. He has won the C.J. McElroy Award, the Weatherby International Hunter of the Year Award, the World Hunting Award, SCI Hall of Fame Award, and the Jim Conklin Award. Mike Simpson is a member of the NRA, Boone & Crockett Club, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, International Sheep Hunting Association, Sportman Club of Texas, Ducks Unlimited, Coastal Conversation Association, Rocky Mountain Mule Deer Foundation, Grand Slam Club, Texas Operation Game Thief, Exotic Wildlife Association, National Taxidermy Association, and Record of Exotics.\n\nNotable Accomplishments of Mike Simpson"
