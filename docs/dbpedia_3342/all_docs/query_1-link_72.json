        "text": "Mike Simpson came to Gardner-Webb University in 1999 intent on building a competitive swim team from scratch and he has done just that with the women’s program and is looking to do the same with a men’s program that was started in 2007-08. In the eleven seasons since the women’s program’s inception, Simpson’s teams won four consecutive Northeast Conference Championships from 2003-2007. The four-time NEC Coach of the Year recipient has produced 96 all-conference selections - 65 women and 31 men, been rated as high as 14th and 30th in the nation, won an NCAA individual national championship and have had the highest ranked team GPA in the nation on multiple occasions.\n\nLast season, the 'Dogs had five swimmers make an NCAA 'B' cut at the CCSA Championships in Athens, Georgia and had 26 swimmers qualify for the CSCAA National Invitational hosted by the United States Naval Academy. At the conference meet in Georgia, Gardner-Webb's swimmers recorded 151 lifetime bests, 12 school records and saw three swimmers win events. The Gardner-Webb men won the 200-yard freestyle relay 400-yard freestyle relay. On the women's side, Lauren Oglesby, who currently owns the team and conference record in the 1560-yard freestyle relay defended her title. At the conclusion of the conference meet, 16 Runnin' Bulldogs made the All-Conference team, while 40 student-athletes were named to the CCSA All-Academic Team. In January, the both the men and women's teams were honored by the CSCAA as Scholar All-America teams. The women boasted the third highest GPA in the country.\n\nTo cap off the 2016-17 season, the men and women both earned a top-three finish at the conference meet. The men came home second (1,216.5 points), while the women finished third (851 points). Connor Bos earned several accolades both in and out of the pool during the season. Bos, a senior from Holland, Mich. was named the CCSA Scholar-Athlete of the Year and also earned recognition on the CoSIDA Division I Academic All-District III At-Large Team. He also received the George A. Christenberry Award for Academic Excellence from the Big South Conference. The award is given to the male and female swimmer who record the highest GPA during their careers.\n\nIn 2015-16, both of Simpson's teams finished fourth at the conference meet. On an individual level, Natan Lile became the first GWU male swimmer to qualify for the NCAA championships. Lile swam in two events - the 50 and 100-yard freestyles and finished 34th in the prelims of the 50-yard event and 36th of the 100-yard competitions. Lile received the NCAA Elite 90 Award, which is presented annually to the student-athlete with the highest cumulative grade point average competing at the finals' site for each of the NCAA's championships.He was also named the CCSA Swimmer and Scholar-Athlete of the year for the second straight season. Additionally, he received the Christenberry Award, which marked the third consecutive season that one of Simpson's swimmers earned the recognition.\n\nThe 2014-15 season saw Gardner-Webb reap several honors, led by Simpson being named the CCSA Male Coach of the Year. Nathan Lile was honored for an outstanding junior campaign, receiving the Most Outstanding Male Swimmer Award. Lile and his teammates swam to a third-place finish at the CCSA Conference Championships, its highest finish of the past three seasons. The women improved from the previous year to finish fourth. Out of the pool, Charity Byrum was honored with the George A. Christenberry Award for Academic Excellence. As a team, both the men and women's squads were named CSCAA Scholar All-America teams.\n\nIn 2013-14, Gardner-Webb had three swimmers - Charity Byrum, Nathan Liles and Giorgie Graves - compete at the Winter A&T Nationals held at teh University of Tennessee. Shortly after 2014 began, Jordan Denmark was named CCSA Swimmer of the Week for meets from January 27-February 3. At the 2013-14 CCSA Championship meet, the women finished a program-best sixth, while the men took home fourth place.\n\nThe 2012-13 campaign would represent a season of firsts for Simpson and Gardner-Webb’s men’s swimming program. The Runnin’ Bulldog men, for the first time in program history, recorded a first place finish in a relay event at CCSA Championships, winning the 200 medley relay behind a school record performance from Colin James, Drew Ellwanger, Matt Anderson, and Cole Hickey to spark a third place team finish at the meet. Gardner-Webb’s women’s swim team finished in fifth place at the Conference Championship meet, highlighted by an All-Conference performance from the 200 medley relay quartet Laurenn Singleton, Charity Byrum, Mary O’Doherty, and Giorgie Graves.\n\nIn 2011-12, Coach Simpson guided the Runnin’ Bulldogs men’s and women’s swim teams to a pair of Top 5 conference finishes once again, with the men taking third place and the women placing fourth at 2012 CCSA Championships. As he has throughout his tenure at Gardner-Webb, Coach Simpson led a team that was successful both in the pool and in the classroom. Fourteen GWU swimmers earned All-CCSA honors, nine new men’s swimming records were set, and two Runnin’ Bulldogs won CCSA championships (Drew Ellwanger, 100 breast, and CJay Wiley, 400 IM) in 2011-12. Additionally, standout Charity Byrum earned CSCAA Honorable Mention All-Academic for her impressive freshman season. Thirty-nine GWU swimmers earned 2012 CCSA All-Academic Team designation.\n\nDuring the 2010-11 season, Gardner-Webb swimming continued to make strides under Simpson’s direction, setting multiple program firsts. On the men’s side, the Runnin’ Bulldogs knocked off CCSA rival Davidson in a dual meet for the first time in program history, winning the meet-closing 400 free relay to clinch a 138-124 win over the Wildcats in Boiling Springs. The Gardner-Webb men also achieved their highest-ever finish at CCSA Conference Championships, finishing 2nd as a team. On the women’s side, GWU captured 3rd place as a team, getting All-Conference performances from Sarah Steadman, Kim Zachensky, Lizzy Ketterer, and Elizabeth Charter, with Zachensky (200 breast) winning an individual title. Casey Brutus (men’s 100 breast) and Steven Caudill (200 fly) also won individual events at the Conference Championship meet for the Runnin’ Bulldogs.\n\nThe 2009-10 campaign was another successful season for both programs, as the men's team finished in second-place and the women's team finished third at the CCSA Championships. Overall, the men's squad finished with a record of 6-2, while the women finished with a 8-3 overall record. The men's team had 11 student-athletes to receive all-conference honors and the women's team had 10 student-athletes to receive recognition, giving them a total of 21 on the season.\n\nOnce again, the effort that the Runnin' Bulldogs exhibit in the classroom was nationally recognized, as the women's team finished the 2009 fall semester with a grade point average of 3.52, which was the best among all NCAA Division I women's swimming programs according to the Collegiate Swim Coaches Association of America (CSCAA), marking the third time that the team topped this list. The men's program had cumulative GPA of 3.26, ranking sixth in the nation.\n\nIn 2008-09 again both squads had a strong season as the men’s team finished in third-place and the women’s team finished fourth at the CCSA Championships. The men finished the season with a 4-4 dual meet record, while the women finished with an 8-2 head-to-head record. Each team had seven student-athletes receive all-conference recognition, giving them 14 total on the season.\n\nAgain the Runnin' Bulldogs hard work in the classroom was rewarded, as the women’s team completed the 2008 fall semester with a grade point average of 3.62 which was the top in the nation among all NCAA Division I women’s swimming programs according to the CSCAA. The men’s team was also top dog, as the men ranked first in the nation as well with a 3.33 GPA, just .01 of a point ahead of Georgetown University. In the spring semester, the GWU women’s swim program ranked third on the list nationally behind Rice and Cincinnati with a 3.55 cumulative GPA. The men finished 16th overall, tallying a 3.23 cumulative GPA.\n\n“Once again our swimmers have done a tremendous job in the classroom,” said Head Swim Coach Mike Simpson. “This is a tribute to their discipline, hard work, and dedication to being true student-athletes. We are very proud of our team for their great year both in academics and in the pool.”\n\nHowever, 2008-09 was also a year of firsts for the Bulldogs, as GWU swimmers Mallory Weggemann and Tucker Dupree combined for 13 gold medals and 13 national titles in the 2009 Spring Can-Am Swimming Championships in Gresham, Oregon on March 19-21. The event marked the first major swimming competition since the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing, hosting some of the world’s top swimmers from the United States, Canada, and Columbia.\n\nGardner-Webb newcomer Weggemann, who has been swimming for the Paralympics for less than year, shattered six American and Pan American records in her first official swim competition at the Can-Am Championships. In doing so, the U.S. Paralympic Women’s Swimming National Team added her to their roster, making her the 39th swimmer on the team. Her record-breaking swim in the 400 freestyle officially made Weggemann the newest member of the National Team. The Gardner-Webb freshman lowered the mark by more than 21 seconds, finishing in a time of 5:27.66. Weggemann also set new national records in the 200 freestyle, 100 freestyle, 50 freestyle, 100 back, and 100 fly.\n\nAlso competing was fellow Bulldog Dupree, a freshman at Gardner-Webb, who also had a stellar performance at the Can-Am Championships, winning seven gold medals and claiming seven national titles. Dupree recorded wins in the 50 back, 100 back, 50 freestyle, 100 freestyle, 200 freestyle, 100 fly, and 200 Individual Medley."
