Joel Hefley [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JOEL HEFLEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO Mr. Hefley. Committee will come to order. This morning the Subcommittee on National Parks, Recreation and Public Lands will hear testimony on three bills, H.R. 1518, H.R. 1776 and H.R. 2114. The first bill, H.R. 1518, was introduced by Congressman Rob Simmons of Connecticut. This legislation would require the Secretary of the Interior to include on the National Register of Historic Places the Avery Point Lighthouse in Groton, Connecticut, and provide $200,000 for the restoration of the lighthouse. H.R. 1776 was introduced by Congressman Gene Green of Texas. This bill would authorize the Secretary of Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of establishing the Buffalo Bayou National Heritage Area in west Houston, Texas. The last bill, H.R. 2114, would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 by ensuring that the act is used only for those purposes originally attended. For example, H.R. 2114 would strengthen the act by ensuring that State and local officials are consulted and provided a role in the designation process. In addition, H.R. 2114 would require congressional approval within 2 years of any new National Monument that is more than 50,000 acres, the equivalent of 78 square miles, or enlarges an existing National Monument by more than 50,000 acres. At this time I would like to ask unanimous consent that Congressman Simmons and Congressman Green be permitted to sit on the dais following their statements. Without objection, so ordered. Just a reminder to our witnesses, due to the very busy Committee schedule this afternoon, I would like to remind the witnesses to keep their testimony to 5 minutes if possible, and we will put you on the clock and you will see the little lights going on and off. I would like to thank all of our witnesses for being here today to testify on these bills, and now I would turn to Mrs. Christensen for any comments she might make. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE DONNA CHRISTENSEN, A DELEGATE TO CONGRESS FROM THE VIRGIN ISLANDS Mrs. Christensen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too want to welcome our colleagues back again to our Subcommittee, and as you said this morning, we are going to receive testimony on three bills. The first, which is H.R. 1518, would require the Secretary of the Interior to include the Avery Point Lighthouse in Groton, Connecticut on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, the bill would earmark $200,000 from amounts appropriated to carry out the National Historic Preservation Act, to be provided to the University of Connecticut Fund for Restoration of the Lighthouse. Although the proposal I am sure has quite a bit of merit, and I was looking over the article that was shared with us before we got started, the approach is cause for concern. Normally, historic properties undergo a rigorous process, including local nomination and State approval, before being added to the Register. Similarly, Federal historic preservation funding is normally awarded to the States in the form of block grants, with the allocation of those funds within a State left up to the State historic preservation officer. To completely remove all State and local input from both the listing and funding processes as H.R. 1518 would propose to do, it is troubling, particularly since it is our understanding there has not yet to date been an attempt to have the Avery Point Lighthouse listed on the National Register through the normal process, but we look forward to hearing from our witnesses today regarding any circumstances that might make such an unprecedented step necessary in this case. The next bill, H.R. 1776, would authorize the study of an area in Houston, Texas known as the Buffalo Bayou to determine whether the area deserves designation as a National Heritage Area. We understand that the administration may have technical suggestions for improvements of the bill and we look forward to learning more about those suggestions and about this interesting area. Our final bill, H.R. 2114, by Mr. Simpson deals with a subject that is very familiar to the Subcommittee. The bill as introduced combines the legislation from controversial language of the 105th Congress, H.R. 1127, with language in the 106th Congress, H.R. 1487, that was amended and approved by the Resources Committee in the House on a bipartisan basis. Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that combining the Antiquities Act language from the 105th and the 106th Congress is a step backwards that will make it harder rather than easier to address the question of National Monument designations by a President. I strongly support the public participation and comment provisions of the bill. These are the bipartisan provisions developed by the Committee last Congress. However, combining these provisions with the language from the 105th Congress limiting the size and duration of monuments designated by the President will only serve to reignite a controversy that many of us thought was settled by the bipartisan language that was developed in the last Congress. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses on the Antiquities Act and the other matters before the Subcommittee today and appreciate their taking time to testify before this Subcommittee. Mr. Hefley. Mr. Simpson, comment? Mr. Simpson. No. Mr. Hefley. Our first panel is composed of the Honorable Gene Green, 29th District of Texas, and the Honorable Rob Simmons, the Second District of Connecticut. We will start with Mr. Simmons. STATEMENT OF THE HON. ROB SIMMONS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT Mr. Simmons. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, good morning, Mrs. Christensen, Mr. Simpson. I am going to be testifying this morning on the Avery Point Lighthouse Act and the Avery Point Lighthouse. So to honor the event I have worn my nice bright red lighthouse tie, and I hope you all can see it up there, but it is a beacon of brightness in this dark city this wonderful Tuesday morning. Let me speak briefly about the Avery Point Lighthouse Restoration Act of 2001 and let me also introduce to the Committee my mayor of Groton, Connecticut, Dee Hauber, who will be paneled a little later in the morning, and Jim Streeter, who has been involved in the local project to restore this lighthouse. The Avery Point Lighthouse is located on the grounds of the University of Connecticut in Groton, Connecticut, in my district on Long Island Sound, and for those of you who have seen the postcard it is a very dramatic location. This lighthouse is special for several reasons. First of all, it was constructed as a memorial to all lighthouse keepers, to all lighthouse keepers across this great Nation. It was constructed as a memorial to them. It was also the last lighthouse that was constructed in the State of Connecticut, being completed in 1943 during World War II as part of a project to establish a Coast Guard facility on that site and to provide appropriate lighting. And we are accompanied here today by Commander Glenn Zilmasia of the U.S. Coast Guard. If you could stand up, Glen. If there are any issues relative to the Coast Guard's involvement with this lighthouse, I am sure he will be happy to answer your questions. A couple of years ago the lighthouse was in serious conditions, seriously deteriorated for a number of reasons, and there was even a concern that it might be demolished, but the Avery Point Lighthouse Society was established in February of last year. One of the cofounders was Jim Streeter, who is here with us today, and funds have been raised to begin the effort to restore, maintain and relight the lighthouse. This citizens initiative has already raised over $35,000, and I believe that we have with us here today a citizens petition with over 10,000 signatures to indicate the very broad-based local public support for this project. Secondly, some of my former colleagues in the Connecticut General Assembly who represent the district have introduced legislation to the Connecticut General Assembly to secure $150,000 in bonding dollars for this project, and so we have substantial State level support. The University of Connecticut, which holds the deed to the property, has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Avery Point Lighthouse Society to cooperate and work with them on the restoration and maintenance of this facility. What we are asking for here today are two things: One, that the lighthouse be placed on the National Register of Historic Places and, to respond to the comments of the ranking member, yes, we will work closely with organizations in Connecticut. We are already in touch with them so that we can do this as a two- track process. We are not trying to bypass anybody in this. We have just been at it for a little over a year, and so we are working on a two-track process for that. And secondly, to secure just a few Federal dollars to assist us in this initiative. We feel that this lighthouse is special. It is special in its construction. It is special in its dedication to lighthouse keepers across the country, and it is special to us because it is the last lighthouse built in this State. We also think it is special and deserves some Federal support because we have local citizen support. We have municipal support. We have support of the State of Connecticut and University of Connecticut, and so finally we want to complete the process with just a little bit of Federal support. And I thank the Chair and the members, and I would be happy to respond to any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Simmons follows:] Statement of The Honorable Rob Simmons, a Representative in Congress from the State of Connecticut on H.R. 1518 Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here this afternoon to testify in support of H.R. 1518, the ``Avery Point Lighthouse Restoration Act of 2001,'' legislation that represents a vital step toward restoring one of the nation's last remaining historical lighthouses. And I am grateful that you have allowed my two of my constituents, Mayor Dee Hauber and Jim Streeter to join me in participating in this congressional hearing. The Avery Point Lighthouse is located on the University of Connecticut's Avery Point Campus in my district of Groton, Connecticut. The Avery Point Lighthouse is located on the University of Connecticut's Avery Point Campus in Groton, Connecticut. In 1942, the United States Coast Guard bought the Avery Point property for a training facility. Subsequently, in 1943, the Avery Point Lighthouse was built as a memorial to lighthouse keepers. It was the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut and I am proud to say that my father worked as an architect for the very firm that built the lighthouse. Sadly, the years have not been kind to the Avery Point Lighthouse. Exposure to weather, coupled with lack of maintenance, has resulted in significant damage and deterioration to this treasure. The light was extinguished in 1967. But as we have seen time and time again in this great nation, citizens have banded together to save and restore the Avery Point Lighthouse. The Avery Point Lighthouse Society was established in February of 2000 to lead the effort to restore, relight and maintain the lighthouse. Led by co-founder Jim Streeter, the Avery Point Lighthouse Society has raised nearly $35,000 in private donations, including the cost of an engineering study being done by the engineering firm of Gibble, Norden and Champion of Old Saybrook, Connecticut. We also anticipate receiving state funding for this project. However, this strong local effort is not enough. Although the Lighthouse Society has made great strides toward providing the necessary funds for restoration, additional monies are needed to see the project through. That's why I introduced the Avery Point Lighthouse Act, which would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to use $200,000 for the restoration of the lighthouse. My bill also would direct the Secretary to place the Avery Point Lighthouse on the National Register of Historic Places, making it eligible for preservation funds and affording it certain protections under that program. I believe the Avery Point Lighthouse deserves special congressional recognition for two reasons. First, it is the last lighthouse erected in the State of Connecticut. This structure remains an important historical part of our state and the nation and should not be lost. Second, it is a strong symbolic representation of the U.S. Coast Guard's lighthouse keeping duties. As you may know, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy is located in the Groton-New London area, as is the U.S. Coast Guard Museum. It is in the nation's best interest to preserve this important symbol of one of the Coast Guard's essential tasks-- protecting our country's coastlines. Mr. Chairman, this public/private partnership effort will ensure that the Avery Point Lighthouse continues to serve as a memorial to lighthouse keepers and an educational tool for many future generations. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your attention. I am happy to answer any questions that you have and look forward to working with you and your Committee on this legislation as we move forward. ______ [An article attached to Mr. Simmons' statement follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3923.001 Mr. Hefley. Thank you very much. Mr. Green. STATEMENT OF THE HON. GENE GREEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and like my colleague, I thank the Chairman and the Committee for holding the hearing today on H.R. 1776, the Buffalo Bayou Heritage Area Study Act. The State of Texas is not typical of most large western and southwestern States in that we do not have large tracts of public lands owned by the Federal Government. The vast majority of our State is privately owned or State owned. This means that we do not have the large tracts of either BLM, Forest Service or National Park Service property for our residents to visit. What we do have though in a number of urban areas is pockets of green space that our residents can use for recreation and relaxation. One of these green space pockets is located in eastside Houston along Buffalo Bayou. It has been one of the highest priorities since I arrived in Congress to help develop east end Houston as a magnet for not only business but also recreation. This legislation is the first step on what I would hope to lead to Buffalo Bayou's designation as a National Heritage Area and I have invited witnesses from Houston who actually go into the history of Buffalo Bayou. Having lived and worked along Buffalo Bayou all my life, I can tell you but not near as well as Anne Olson and Steve Fox, who will both give you much better background on it. Just a brief description of the significance of the waterways use, the original founders of Houston, the Allen brothers, came up Buffalo Bayou in the mid-1830's and stopped at what today is called Allen's Landing in downtown Houston. The City of Houston now is the energy capital of the world and a major center for shipping in not only the Gulf of Mexico but also it started with facilitating these docks on Buffalo Bayou in downtown Houston. Now our ship channel is moved to the east, not included in this request for this heritage area, but it is the beginning of the Houston area. And I am only scratching the surface of the historical and cultural nature, and my witnesses again will go into more depth and more detail on Buffalo Bayou and how it is a perfect candidate for a National Heritage Area designation and why it has such strong local support. The redevelopment project has significant local support from both our mayor of Houston and our county judge of our Harris County, our county executive. In addition, the City of Houston recently approved $350,000 expenditures for the Buffalo Bayou Partnership to begin formulating the master plan development for Buffalo Bayou. These financial commitments not only by the City of Houston but our County of Harris is what I believe is the important critical element needed to gain National Heritage designation. We have that local support. In that light, I want to compliment the organization, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership. This local group brings these vast resources to Houston and Harris County for the purpose of building something to benefit all our local residents. The Buffalo Bayou Partnership is a group of dedicated, hardworking people and Anne Olson is here to talk about that today. It is a great conduit for the development of this National Heritage Area. Our local organization and broad public support for this designation is exactly what the program was designed to complement. Our local folks feel that the designation itself will be a magnet for both public and private investment, and while envisioned when this legislation was first proposed, Buffalo Bayou would create a mechanism that would create new development opportunities and highlight our historical nature in Houston and cultural significance in our area. Again, it is part of Buffalo Bayou that is historic, not only from 1835 but even up through the Civil War, and again, Mr. Chairman and Committee members, I could talk about it, but I will leave that up to the experts, and I will be glad to try and answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Green follows:] Statement of The Honorable Gene Green, A Representative in Congress from the State of Texas on H.R 1776 Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking you and the Ranking Member for holding this important legislative hearing on H.R. 1776, the Buffalo Bayou Heritage Area Study Act. The State of Texas is not typical of many large western or southwestern states in that we do not have large tracts of public lands owned by the federal government. The vast majority of our state is privately owned. This means that we do not have the vast tracts of BLM, Forest Service, or National Park Service property for our residents to visit. What we do have, especially in our major urban centers, are pockets of public green space that our residents can use for recreation and relaxation. One of these green space pockets is located on the East side of Houston, Texas along the Buffalo Bayou. It has been one of my highest priorities since I arrived in Congress to help develop this open space into a real recreation magnet for folks in East Houston. This legislation is the first step in what I hope will lead to Buffalo Bayou's designation as a National Heritage Area. I have invited several witnesses from Houston who will testify in greater detail the cultural and historical significance of the area being studied for the designation, but I can tell you that this ten mile stretch of green space and waterway has a lot of potential. Just to give you a brief historical snapshot of the significance of this waterway to Houston. The original founders of Houston, the Allen Brothers, came up Buffalo Bayou and stopped at what is today Allen's Landing in downtown landing. The City of Houston was established as a major center of international shipping in the Gulf of Mexico, and to facilitate commerce the city was oriented toward Buffalo Bayou's docks. Again, I am only scratching the surface on the cultural and historical significance of this waterway. My witnesses will provide you with a much more in depth description of what makes Buffalo Bayou a perfect candidate for a National Heritage Area designation and why it has such strong local support. This redevelopment project has significant local support from both the Mayor of Houston and the County Judge. In addition, the Houston City Council recently approved a $350,000 expenditure for the Buffalo Bayou Partnership to begin formulating their master development plan for Buffalo Bayou. This financial commitment highlights what I believe is the most critical component needed to gain a National Heritage Designation--solid local support. In that light, I want to compliment the organization that is charged with spearheading this development effort, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership. This local group has been able to bring the vast resources of the Houston and Harris County communities together for the purpose of building something for the benefit of all the local residents. The Buffalo Bayou Partnership consists of a small group of dedicated, hardworking people who I believe will be the perfect conduit to help develop our National Heritage Area proposal. Our local organization and broad public support for this designation is exactly what this program was designed to compliment. Our local folks feel that the designation itself will be a magnet for both public and private investment. What I envisioned when this legislation was first proposed for Buffalo Bayou was to create a mechanism that would create new development opportunities and highlight the historical and cultural significance of this important area. In conclusion Mr. Chairman, I again what to thank you and the Ranking Member for including my legislation in today's hearing and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. ______ [A map of Buffalo Bayou and three letters submitted for the record by Mr. Green follow:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3923.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3923.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3923.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3923.002 Mr. Hefley. Thank you, Mr. Green. Mr. Simpson. STATEMENT OF THE HON. MIKE SIMPSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF IDAHO Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I have an opening statement that I would like included in the record, and then I am just going to briefly discuss what this bill is about and why it is here, and then I want to thank all those individuals that came to testify both for and against this legislation, H.R. 2114, the National Antiquities Fairness Act. I honestly believe that the biggest threat to the Antiquities Act today is its abuse or misinterpretation as the law is currently applied. In 1906, the antiquities law when it was written was the environmental law of the time. It was literally the environmental law of the time. It allowed for a President to declare a National Monument unilaterally, by himself, without congressional or public input, with only three or four different requirements, one of them being that it be of historic, scientific or geological significance, that the area be under some imminent threat, not some potential threat in the future but that it be under some actual imminent threat and that the smallest amount of land possible be used to protect that site. In the original debate when this was brought to the floor in 1906, Mr. Stephens of Texas was questioning Mr. Lacey of Iowa, the sponsor of the legislation. Mr. Stephens said, ``Will this take''--and I quote--``Will this take this land off the market or can they still be settled on as part of the public domain?'' Mr. Lacey: ``it will take those portions of the reservation out of the market. It is meant to cover the cave dwellers and cliff dwellers.'' Mr. Stephens of Texas: ``how much land will be taken off the market in the western States by the passage of this bill?'' Mr. Lacey: ``not very much. The bill provides that it shall be the smallest area necessary for the care and maintenance of the objects to be preserved.'' Mr. Stephens of Texas: ``would it be anything like the forest reserve bill by which 70 or 80 million acres of land of the United States have been tied up?'' Mr. Lacey: ``certainly not. The object is entirely different. It is to preserve these old objects of special interests in the Southwest whilst the other reserves, the forest and the water courses....'' Certainly when you look back at the debate, the intent of the original Antiquities Act is not the way it is being used today, and in fact today there is some 80 million acres that are in National Monument status. Since that time we have passed and Congress has passed many other environmental laws that were not in place at the time, the Wilderness Act, the Wild and Scenic Act, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act. You can go on and on. There is lots of legislation that we have passed that were not there in 1906. This is the only one that I am aware of which gives an individual the power to act without any public or congressional input. I would suggest that if we were here proposing legislation to take away the requirement that there be public input in the National Environmental Policy Act or anything like that, that those people opposed to this legislation would be rightfully outraged that we wanted to take away the public's right to comment or to have input into the designation and use of public lands. What this bill does is very simple. It says that a President can declare a National Monument up to 50,000 acres, he has to notify the congressional delegation and the governor 60 days before that declaration is made so that they can have public input, they can hold hearings, they can participate in the process. If the designation is over 50,000 acres, the President can still make that declaration. It doesn't take away his right to do it, but it says Congress has to affirm that designation within 2 years or it reverts to its original land designation. It does not take away the President's right to do anything he can currently do now. What this does, I think, is restore some balance into an unbalanced law by putting Congress and the public in part of the mix. Now, some people say this bill is an anti- environmental law. I can guarantee you it is not. As I said, it just restores, I think, some balance between a unilateral declaration by an individual and Congress doing what it is constitutionally required, and that is make land use designations within the United States and to have some public input. As I said, the President can still make the designations to protect those lands. Those that are under imminent threat, immediate threat, he can still protect those lands. Some will say this bill is an anti-American bill. I can guarantee you that it is not anti-American. What is anti- American is the current law because what we have is a system of government of a balance of power and checks and balances, and under the Antiquities Act as it currently is there is no checks and balance. Now some can say Congress can act and undo what the President does but the reality is that is not how it works. If we are placed in the position of having to do undo what a President does, essentially you would have to have a two-thirds vote to override a presidential veto if we were going to pass a bill to undo a National Monument status bill. And that is not the way our Constitution was established, and consequently I think this is a necessary bill. It is not an attempt to undermine the Antiquities Act. It is an attempt, I believe, to strengthen the Antiquities Act, and I appreciate the ranking member's comment about the controversy that this brings up, but it is a controversy that needs to be engaged. I think the 1906 Antiquities Act needs to be viewed in the context of the laws that currently exist, not the way it was written in 1906 but with all the environmental laws and protections that we currently have on the books, and simply have Congress and the public get back into the debate of how we manage public lands. I appreciate the Chairman's time constraints. [The prepared statement of Mr. Simpson follows:] Statement of The Honorable Mike Simpson, A Representative in Congress from The State of Idaho Thank you for scheduling this important hearing on H.R. 2114, the National Monument Fairness Act. Additionally, I want to thank the panel members who have made the long journey to Washington, D.C., to testify on behalf of H.R. 2114. H.R. 2114 eliminates the single greatest threat to the Antiquities Act- its abuse by a sitting President. One need only look at former President Clinton's declaration of the 1.7 million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1906, and the ensuing controversy to see what happens when you bypass the public and state and local officials. He undertook this action without the consent or input of the Governor or Congressional Delegation of the State of Utah. Further, he announced the designation in a grand press conference not in Utah, but in Arizona. Former President Clinton's action on the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument designation, and other such designations, represents the greatest threat to the Antiquities Act. As any reasonable person knows, the abuse of any law erodes public support for the law and undermines the credibility of future designations. Former President Clinton's abuse of the Antiquities Act now threatens any future use of the Act, and thus the Act's worthy goal, as envisioned during the 1906 debate, of protecting truly threatened federal lands of historical, prehistorical or scientific interest. As written, the Antiquities Act gives the President the unilateral authority to carve national monuments out of existing federal lands without any public input. The National Monument Fairness Act of 2001 amends the Antiquities Act of 1906 to require the President to seek input from state and local officials prior to a monument declaration and would require congressional approval of any monument designation or expansion that is more than 50,000 acres. This legislation is a direct response to the concerns of many people, including myself, who believe the recent rash of presidential declarations have misused or abused the Antiquities Act and been contrary to the original intent of Congress. Specifically, H.R. 2114 requires the President to solicit public participation and comment, and to consult with the affected Governor(s) and congressional delegation(s) at least 60 days prior to any national monument designation. Additionally, it states that a proclamation of the President, which creates a national monument that is more than 50,000 acres, or enlarges an existing national monument by more than 50,000 acres, may not be issued until 30 days after the proposed proclamation has been transmitted to the Governor of the state(s), and that Congress must approve of such a monument designation within 2 years. The common sense changes to the Antiquities Act that I am proposing will serve to reign in the unrestrained use of the Act and restore the original intent of Congress. Thereby, strengthening the Act. The original intent of Congress was to allow the President to protect ``historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest.'' In addition, as stated by the Act, reserved lands were to be ``confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.'' Finally, the objects to be protected must face immediate threats or endangerment. Unfortunately, the Antiquities Act is not being used as it was intended. It is now being used to lock up large tracts of land without any public comment, input from state and local elected officials, or congressional review. Former President Clinton used the Antiquities Act twenty-two times to designate nearly 5.8 million acres of federal land as national monuments, without any public input or consultation with state and local officials. In reading the Congressional Record from the 1906 debate on consideration of the Antiquities Act, it is clear that western Members were concerned about possible ``land grabs,'' and that the original intent of the Act was preserve old objects of historic value. One member, Mr. Stephens of Texas, only agreed to consideration of the bill after being assured by the bill's proponent, Mr. Lacey of Iowa, that its intent was not to tie up large tracks of land. The following is taken from the debate transcript between Mr. Stephens and Mr. Lacey. Mr. LACEY. There has been an effort made to have national parks in some of these regions, but this will merely make small reservations where the objects are of sufficient interest to preserve them. Mr. STEPHENS of Texas. Will that take this land off of market, or can they still be settled on as part of the public domain? Mr. LACEY. It will take that portion of the reservation out of the market. It is meant to cover the cave dwellers and cliff dwellers. Mr. STEPHENS of Texas. How much land will be taken off the market in the Western States by the passage of this bill? Mr. LACEY. Not very much. The bill provides that it shall be the smallest area necessary for the care and maintenance of the objects to be preserved. Mr. STEPHENS of Texas. Would it be anything like the forest-reserve bill [precursor to the National Forest System], by which seventy or eighty million acres of land in the United States have been tied up? Mr. LACEY. Certainly not. The object is entirely different. It is to preserve these old objects of special interest in the Southwest, whilst the other reserves the forests and the water courses. Mr. STEPHENS of Texas. I hope the gentleman will succeed in passing that bill [a separate bill], and this bill will not result in locking up other lands. I have no objection to its consideration. This bill preserves the President's ability to protect those special historical areas that are less than 50,000 acres and deserving of monument designation, while providing Congress with the power to conduct appropriate oversight over declarations involving greater expanses of land. Not only is this in line with the original intent of Congress, but is also in line with the U.S. Constitution. Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states: ``Congress shall have Power to'make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. When one looks at the actual words of the Act and the original debate surrounding the Act, it is evident that the original intent of Congress was to protect special areas of limited size. This coupled with the constitutional role of Congress respecting federal lands; it is incumbent upon Congress to reign in the abuse of the Antiquities Act. This common sense legislation restores Congress's constitutional oversight role regarding land use and management policies resulting from national monument status. Moreover, it holds the President accountable to Congress and the American people. This legislation is not about preventing national monuments, but creating a process by which national monument decisions can be arrived at openly, with public participation and state and local government consultation. From the time of enactment of the Antiquities Act, Presidents have used the Act over 120 times, totaling over 70 million acres, without any formal public input. However, since 1943, only two Presidents have used the Antiquities Act to designate a national monument in excess of 50,000 acres--President Carter and President Clinton. National monument declarations are major decisions with far reaching effects that should be made in the open, not in secret. Secret decision-making is not conducive to sound decision-making. Decisions, even those well intentioned, made without adequate input are often rejected because the public does not feel they have been a part of the process. I see no harm in allowing the public and state and local officials an opportunity to examine proposed monuments and provide input on possible local impacts. Bringing the public and Congress to the table strengthens, not weakens, the Antiquities Act and ensures all parties have a voice in the debate. Once again, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for holding this hearing. I am hopeful that the information presented here will allow us to move forward with this common sense legislation. Thank you Mr. Chairman. ______ Mr. Hefley. Thank you very much. Just two or three questions here. First of all, Mr. Green, who did you pay and how much did you pay to get that number on your bill? I mean, I want to hear drums and fifes and see flags waving. Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman, I would have preferred 1836 but I didn't want to wait a hundred numbers or 75 numbers to get there. Mr. Hefley. You did very well. Mr. Green. It was the luck of the draw. Mr. Hefley. This is a National Historic Area we are talking about. So I want you and your witnesses to tell us, tell this Committee, what is there about Buffalo Bayou? Now, I understand that it could be an economic development thing for Houston, I understand that it could be a recreational thing for people in the Houston area, but what is there about Buffalo Bayou that makes these Committee members want to go to Houston to see that National Heritage Area, Buffalo Bayou? Mr. Green. Well, Mr. Chairman, I will let the experts talk about it, but I can tell you the benefit to the Nation. The Houston area again is the energy capital of the world. It developed along Buffalo Bayou from 1836 to today and even increasing. In Houston, typically we are thinking so much about the future instead of the past. This would give us an opportunity to say, well, let's look at our heritage and what caused this to become the fourth largest city in the country, to cause the United States Congress in 1917 to provide for the deepening and widening of the Houston Ship Channel that is our first largest port of foreign tonnage. And it will recognize that heritage. Literally from along Buffalo Bayou there is the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836 that really opened the way for Texas independence, an independent country, but the area we are talking about was the development of the City of Houston, and again that is of national significance because of the energy industry but also the fourth largest city in the Nation, and being in the State of Texas there is not a lot of Federal lands available. In fact, in the Park Service testimony you will see the National Park work and contacts in the Houston area are not extensive. This would give us a chance to show the culture and the history of Houston and how it benefits the Nation. Mr. Hefley. Is there anything to see there of an historic nature now in Houston or is it all gone because Houston has been a fast developing, dynamic city? Mr. Green. What we are seeing is by looking back, and again Stephen Fox and Anne Olson will say better, but I know in my own district that this includes--we have a park area that has been there for many years and we are continuing to rediscover the roots of Houston along Buffalo Bayou. Harrisburg, for example, that is in my district, was the first city along Buffalo Bayou. It was incorporated in the City of Houston many years ago, but that is the historic nature of it, and that is what we are seeing rediscovered in that Houston area, east end of Houston now, but the heritage that we have in that area. Mr. Hefley. Thank you. Mr. Simmons, I love lighthouses and I think we ought--. Mr. Simmons. We can share my tie. Mr. Hefley. And I love your tie. I am a big fan of restoring lighthouses. I hate to see one torn down but why not go through the normal process for registry on the National Register? Why come to Congress? Ordinarily this isn't the process that we use for this. Mr. Simmons. Yes, Mr. Chairman. It is a good process. We have been in touch with the State Historic Society. We have been in touch with the folks in the State of Connecticut who would normally assist in this process. Of course our concern is timeliness. This is a structure that came very close 2 years ago to being demolished, and if you look at the postcard that we have, which is very scenic and very beautiful, but if you look around the bottom of it you will see some red or orange plastic which is marking this off as a dangerous site, a site to keep away from. So we have come to the brink, if you will, with this. It nearly came down a couple of years ago. Citizen response, the response of the community, the response of the municipality and the State have been aggressive and active to put this on the front burner, and I guess in a way by establishing a faster track through legislation, we are responding to that concern that we have come very close to losing this, but if this is an issue for the Committee. I am sure that we would be able to provide additional testimony and input from the requisite State authorities to bring you up to date on what they are doing also to meet the requirements of national historic status. Mr. Hefley. Mrs. Christensen. Mrs. Christensen. I don't have any questions at this point, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hefley. Committee members, anybody with questions for this panel? If not, we thank you, and again we welcome you to sit in, if you would like, with us during the deliberations. Mr. Simmons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hefley. Panel number two, Mr. Tom Fulton, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, the Department of Interior, Washington, D.C.; Mr. John Robbins, Assistant Director of Cultural Resources, Stewardship and Partnership, the National Park Service. Would you join us? Mr. Fulton. STATEMENT OF TOM FULTON, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR LAND AND MINERALS MANAGEMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Mr. Fulton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mrs. Christensen and other members of the Subcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today regarding H.R. 2114, the National Monument Fairness Act of 2001. H.R. 2114 is consistent with and would reinforce actions already taken by this administration. As the Federal agency tasked by law with developing sound management plans for new national monuments, the Department of Interior is committed to bringing common sense and balance to the decision process by listening to the people most affected by these decisions. We have already undertaken that effort, and we believe that the result will be land use plans that reflect the special status of the lands that we have set aside while ensuring that those most directly affected are not disenfranchised by the process. Since enactment of the Antiquities Act of 1906, 121 national monuments have been created by presidential proclamation, many of which, such as the Grand Canyon, Carlsbad Caverns, the Statue of Liberty, have attained national recognition. Others such as Walnut Canyon in Arizona and Capulin Volcano in New Mexico are less well-known. Twenty-seven States have national monuments and the land area of these 121 monuments designated over time represent a special use category of approximately 100,000 square miles, equal to the combined land area of Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Congress has in the past acted to convert a number of national monuments into national parks, and in addition Congress has designated national monuments themselves. Congress has also acted to abolish some national monuments such as that of Wheeler, Colorado, abolished in 1950. In the early years of the Antiquities Act, the War Department was given management authority over monuments. However, in 1933 President Franklin Roosevelt consolidated management of all monuments created to that date within the National Park Service. Currently the only monument not managed by one of the land management agencies is the President Lincoln and Soldiers Home National Monument created July 7th, 2000. This 2.3-acre monument is managed by the Armed Forces Retirement Home through the U.S. Soldiers and Airmen's Home. The overwhelming majority of national monuments created by presidential proclamation are managed by the National Park Service, beginning with President Theodore Roosevelt's proclamation of Devil's Tower National Monument in 1906. Most Presidents throughout the 20th century have used the Antiquities Act to establish what are now many of the National Park System's most famous sites. Not all of the proclaimed national monuments have retained their National Monument designation. Some have been incorporated into larger national park units. Others have been redesignated as national parks or other types of units within the park system. Additionally, not all national park system units carry the name National Monument that were established by presidential proclamation. Congress has enacted legislation to establish national monuments 38 times. Like the national monuments designated by Presidents, some of these monuments have been redesignated through acts of Congress as other types of units. The National Park Service administers national monuments in the same manner as other units of the National Park System. They are subject to the provisions of the proclamations that establish the individual monuments along with subsequent legislation addressing them and laws and regulations that govern national park units generally. The primary law on which the Park Management Service policies are based is the act of August 25, 1916, known as the Organic Act, as amended. The Bureau of Land Management currently manages 14 presidentially proclaimed monuments and one congressionally designated national monument, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. These monuments range in size from a 4,148-acre Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in New Mexico to the 1.8 million-acre Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in Utah. Relatively new to the administration of monuments, the BLM manages the monuments subject to the provisions of each individual proclamation and the guiding principles of the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act, known as FLPMA. Management of each monument is unique. However, they all share some common characteristics. The proclamation under the land laws, each limits vehicular traffic, and individual proclamations address issues specific to each monument. On March 28, 2001, Interior Secretary Gail Norton sent some 200 letters to local elected officials of all political affiliations seeking their ideas on proper and appropriate land use. The letter was sent to affected State governors, Members of Congress, State House and Senate leaders, county commissioners and tribal chairs. The Department is currently receiving replies, not only from those who received the letter, but from others who have chosen to offer their views as well. We believe there are strong public policy reasons to support H.R. 2114 because of population growth in the West and the impact of such declarations on individuals who live in the West. In conclusion, the goal of enabling local communities and citizens to have the opportunity to be heard prior to the creation of a monument larger than 50,000 acres is valid and one that the administration supports. Thank you again for the opportunity to express the administration's views, and I will attempt to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Fulton follows:] Statement of Tom Fulton, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, U.S. Department of the Interior on H.R. 2114 Our duty is to use the land well and, sometimes, not to use it at all. This is our responsibility as citizens, but more than that, it is our calling as stewards of the Earth. Good stewardship of the environment is not just a personal responsibility; it is a public value. Americans are united in the belief that we must preserve our natural heritage and safeguard the land around us. This belief is affirmed in our laws. President George W. Bush May 30, 2001 Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to provide testimony regarding H.R. 2114, the National Monument Fairness Act of 2001. H.R. 2114 is consistent with and would reinforce actions already taken by this Administration. As the Federal agency tasked by law with developing sound management plans for new national monuments, the Department is committed to bringing common sense and balance to the decision process by listening to the people most affected by these decisions. We have already undertaken that effort and we believe that the result will be land use plans that reflect the special status of the lands that we have set aside while ensuring that those most directly affected are not disenfranchised by the process. Background Since enactment of the Antiquities Act (16 USC 431-433), in 1906, 121 national monuments have been created by Presidential proclamation, many of which, such as the Grand Canyon, Carslbad Caverns, and the Statue of Liberty, have attained national recognition over the years. Others, such as Walnut Canyon in Arizona or Capulin Volcano in New Mexico, are less well known. Twenty-seven states currently have national monuments. The land area of these 121 monuments represents a special use of approximately 100,000 square miles of land, equal to the land area of Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Congress has in the past acted to convert a number of national monuments into national parks. For example, Grand Teton National Park began life as Jackson Hole National Monument. Congress has also created national monuments independently of the President. In 2000, Congress designated the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. In addition, Congress has acted to abolish some national monuments such as Wheeler, Colorado, which was abolished in 1950. In the early years of the Antiquities Act, the War Department was given management authority over several monuments. However, in 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt consolidated management of all monuments created to that date within the National Park Service. Currently, the only monument not managed by one of the land managing agencies, such as the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, United States Forest Service or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is the President Lincoln and Soldier's Home National Monument created on July 7, 2000. This 2.3 acre monument is managed by the Armed Forces Retirement Home through the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmens' Home with guidance provided by the National Park Service. The following is a brief summary of some of the monuments administered by the agencies within the Department of the Interior and the authorities used to manage them. National Park Service The overwhelming majority of national monuments created by Presidential proclamation are managed by the National Park Service. Beginning with President Theodore Roosevelt's proclamation of Devil's Tower National Monument in 1906, most of the presidents throughout the 20th Century used the Antiquities Act authority to establish what are now many of the National Park System's most famous sites. Not all of the proclaimed national monuments have retained their ``national monument'' designation. Some have been incorporated into larger national park units, and others have been redesignated as national parks or other types of units within the National Park System. Petrified Forest National Monument in Arizona, for example, was redesignated by an Act of Congress as Petrified Forest National Park. Chaco Culture National Monument in New Mexico is now Chaco Canyon National Historical Park. Santa Rosa Island National Monument in Florida is now part of Gulf Islands National Seashore. Additionally, not all National Park System units that carry the name ``national monument'' were established by presidential proclamation. Congress has enacted legislation to establish national monuments 38 times. Like the national monuments designated by presidents, some of these monuments have been redesignated through acts of Congress as other types of units. For example, Harpers Ferry National Monument in West Virginia is now Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. Biscayne National Monument in Florida is now Biscayne National Park. The National Park Service administers national monuments in the same manner as other units of the National Park System. They are subject to the provisions of the proclamations that established the individual monuments, along with any subsequent legislation addressing them, and to the laws and regulations that govern national park units generally. The primary law on which National Park Service management policies are based is the Act of August 25, 1916, known as the ``Organic Act,'' as amended. This law, which continues to serve as the basic mission statement of the National Park Service, requires the agency ``to conserve the scenery, and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same...as will leave them unimpaired for future generations.'' Consistent with that principle, management plans for national monuments established by Presidential proclamation that are under the National Park Service's jurisdiction are developed in the same manner as other units of the National Park System. General management plans for park units are guided by the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978. This Act directs the National Park Service to prepare and revise in a timely manner general management plans for the preservation and use of each unit of the National Park System and to include (1) measures for preservation of the area's resources, (2) indications of the type and general intensity of development, including visitor circulation and transportation patterns along with locations, timing, and anticipated costs, (3) identification of visitor carrying capacities, and (4) indications of potential modifications to the external boundaries of the unit. The general management planning process includes substantial public involvement. Fish and Wildlife Service In 1978, President Carter designated the 8.6 million acre Yukon Flats and the1.2 million acre Becharof National Monuments. These two areas remained national monuments until the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 which, among other things, repealed these monument designations and established them as National Wildlife Refuges. Currently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages the majority of the Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington state, created in June of last year, in accordance with Presidential Proclamation 7319, the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act and through permits and memoranda of understanding between it and the Department of Energy. Bureau of Land Management The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 14 Presidentially- proclaimed monuments and 1 Congressionally-designated national monument, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. These monuments range in size from the 4,148 acre Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in New Mexico to the 1.8 million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. Relatively new to the administration of monuments, the BLM manages the monuments subject to the provisions of each individual proclamation and the guiding principles of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). Management of each monument is unique. However, they all share some common characteristics. First, each of the proclamations withdraws the land within the monuments, subject to valid existing rights, from mining, mineral leasing and entry under the land laws. Second, each limits vehicular travel to roads and trails designated for such use. Third, each places a priority on managing objects of historic or scientific interest within the monument for future generations. In addition, individual proclamations address issues specific to each monument. The BLM has completed a management plan for only one of its 14 monuments, the Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument created in 1996. That management plan was completed in February 2000. A comprehensive public planning process is required for each of BLM's 13 other Presidentially designated monuments. These plans will include in depth NEPA analysis, including extensive collaborative public participation. Open houses and other opportunities for public input and involvement are already underway. Among the issues on which BLM will seek guidance and advice from the public are: public access and transportation, recreational opportunities, protection of cultural and natural resources, environmental education, noxious weed eradication, grazing, commercial uses and fire management. Recent Monument Designations On March 28, 2001, Interior Secretary Gale Norton sent some 200 letters to local elected officials of all political affiliations seeking their ideas on proper and appropriate land use plans for the national monuments that had been created in 2000 and 2001. The letter was sent to affected states' Governors, Members of Congress, State House and Senate leaders, County Commissioners, and Tribal Chairs, in an effort to foster a cooperative partnership to ensure that these monuments are administered in a manner that considers local needs and concerns as well as national interests. The Department is currently receiving replies not only from those who received the letter, but also from others who have chosen to offer their views as well. Gaining public input, especially from those most directly affected by the creation of these new monuments, is a high priority of this Administration. We believe that there are strong public policy reasons to support this bill. Population, particularly in the American West, has changed significantly in the last several years. Areas that for many decades had not seen rapid population growth have experienced extraordinary growth. In the early years following enactment of the Antiquities Act, the impacts resulting from large national monument designations on private landowners and local communities were not always as direct or significant as they are today. It is a high priority for the Administration to gather input from States and local communities as part of a collaborative decision-making process on issues that affect Federal lands. To that end, the objectives and requirements of H.R. 2114 are both timely and appropriate. In conclusion, the goal of enabling local communities and citizens to have an opportunity to be heard prior to the creation of a monument larger than 50,000 acres is valid and one that the Administration supports. As such, the requirements of H.R. 2114 help to ensure that better, more informed decisions are reached where these monuments are concerned. As President Bush stated during a recent speech given at Sequoia National Park, ``...a healthy environment is a national concern and requires an active National Government. At the same time, States and localities have their own responsibilities for the environment. They have their own authority, too.'' He went on to state, ``Washington has sometimes relied too much on threat and mandate from afar, when it should be encouraging innovation and high standards from the people closest to the land.'' Thank you again for the opportunity to express the Administration's views on this legislation. I will be happy to answer any questions of the Committee. ______ Mr. Hefley. Mr. Robbins. STATEMENT OF JOHN ROBBINS, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, CULTURAL RESOURCES, STEWARDSHIP AND PARTNERSHIP, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Mr. Robbins. Morning, Mr. Chairman. I am addressing both H.R. 1518 and H.R. 1776. On H.R. 1518 we agree that efforts to recognize, protect and preserve Avery Point Lighthouse and other lighthouses are very worthwhile. Recognition and protection and eligibility for most preservation funding begin with listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service, in partnership with State historic preservation officers, is responsible for developing and maintaining the National Register according to a process established in 1966 by the National Historic Preservation Act. The National Park Service would be pleased to work the Connecticut State historic preservation officer and the owners of Avery Point Lighthouse toward listing the property on the National Register of Historic Places. The Department has concerns about earmarking limited National Park Service funds for specific nonpark purposes. Although this bill includes a small amount for rehabilitating Avery Point Lighthouse, such special support could divert funds from important initiatives to address maintenance backlogs in national parks. As an appropriate source of funding, Avery Point Lighthouse might be a candidate for a grant under the Save America's Treasures program, which assists in preserving significant endangered properties and collections throughout the United States. The President's fiscal year 2002 budget proposes $30 million for the Save America's Treasures program with both House and Senate support. The National Park Service administers the Save America's Treasures program and would be pleased to provide the sponsors of the lighthouse project with information on how to apply for Save America's Treasures grants. On H.R. 1776, again, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department's views on H.R. 1776, which would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of establishing the Buffalo Bayou National Heritage Area in Houston, Texas. The legislation also authorizes $200,000 in fiscal year 2002 to fund the study. Communities such as those surrounding Buffalo Bayou value their heritage and open space and are looking for ways to maintain and enhance their community resources. A heritage area study could consider the best methods for protecting and using the natural, cultural, and recreational resources of Buffalo Bayou while preserving the character of an area that is so central to the history of Houston. The Department supports this legislation, if amended to make the bill similar to previous national heritage area study bills. The Department, however, does not request funding for the study in this or the next fiscal year in order to focus available resources on completing previously authorized studies. Currently, 41 authorized studies are pending and we expect to complete only a few of those this year. We also caution that our support of this legislation authorizing the study does not necessarily mean that the Department will support designation of Buffalo Bayou as a national heritage area. The administration is determined to eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog in national parks. The cost of new parks or other commitments such as grants for new heritage areas could divert funds from taking care of current responsibilities. H.R. 1776 and ongoing community involvement demonstrate commitment to protecting and preserving Buffalo Bayou. We would be happy to work with the Subcommittee and with the bill's sponsor, Representative Green, to amend the legislation so that H.R. 1776 is similar to other bills that have authorized studies of potential heritage areas. Proposed amendments to H.R. 1776 are attached to the end of the testimony submitted. I would be happy to respond to any questions that you or other Committee members might have on these matters. [The prepared statements of Mr. Robbins follow:] Statement of John Robbins, Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships, U.S. Department of the Interior on H.R. 1518 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before your committee to present the views of the Department of the Interior on H.R. 1518, to require the Secretary of the Interior to include on the National Register of Historic Places the Avery Point Lighthouse in Groton, Connecticut, and provide $200,000 for the restoration of that lighthouse. The Department appreciates the efforts to protect this historic lighthouse. This site could be an excellent candidate for funding through the Save America's Treasures program, for which the President's fiscal year 2002 Budget proposed $30 million and the House and Senate have both supported. We would be happy to provide the local sponsors with more information on how to apply for these grants to protect the historic buildings, sites, artifacts, and collections that represent significant achievements in American culture. The Department, however, has concerns with the concept of earmarking limited National Park Service funds for specific non-park facilities. Although the amount in this bill is small, it nevertheless diverts funds away from the President's initiatives to take care of current responsibilities by addressing deferred maintenance backlogs. The Department supports the principle that States--not the Federal Government--are best suited to determine the highest priorities for using grant funding, including Historic Preservation Fund funds, which would be allocated in this bill for a specific project. We are concerned that legislative earmarks could effectively take funding away from grants to States and Indian tribes nationwide and dictate how those funds should be spent. We support efforts to preserve significant historic lighthouses, which are important national historic treasures worthy of our care and attention. We note that this Committee took the lead in passing legislation to facilitate the transfer of historic lighthouses to non- government organizations willing to help preserve them. We stand ready to help the owners of this lighthouse to recognize this historic structure by nominating it for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Long-standing procedures, however, require that the owners work through the State's Historic Preservation Officer, and we understand that such coordination on an application has not been completed. If needed, we can help the owners, working with the Connecticut State Historic Preservation Officer, on the documentation necessary to evaluate the property's eligibility for listing. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to comment. This concludes my prepared remarks and I will be happy to answer any questions you or other committee members might have. ______ Statement of John Robbins, Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior on H.R. 1776 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department of the Interior's views on H. R. 1776. This bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of establishing the Buffalo Bayou National Heritage Area in west Houston, Texas. The Department supports this legislation, if amended to make the bill similar to previous national heritage area study bills. Nevertheless, we will not request funding for the study in this or the next fiscal year so as to focus available time and resources on completing previously authorized studies. As of now, there are 41 authorized studies that are pending, and we only expect to complete a few of those this year. We caution that our support of this legislation authorizing a study does not necessarily mean that the Department will support designation of this National Heritage Area. The Administration is determined to eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog in national parks, but the costs of new parks or other commitments, such as grants for new National Heritage Areas, could divert funds from taking care of current responsibilities. Furthermore, in order to better plan for the future of our National Parks, we believe that any such studies should carefully examine the full life cycle operation and maintenance costs that would result from each alternative considered. H.R. 1776 outlines the characteristics and qualities of the Buffalo Bayou area in Houston, Texas including the history and role of the Bayou in the creation and development of the city. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a suitability and feasibility study to determine if the area known as Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas could be designated as a national heritage area. The legislation authorizes $200,000 in Fiscal Year 2002 to fund the study, with a report due to Congress describing the results of the study. The National Park Service has not had extensive involvement in the Houston area. However, the Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program (RTCA) has worked with the Buffalo Bayou Partnership and other local groups to establish a 5 mile rail-trail that runs parallel to the Bayou. Through that work, and from brief reviews of planning documents and activities surrounding the Bayou, it is clear that this area of Houston was central to the creation of the city. The Bayou has now become a focal point for downtown Houston, encouraging its residents to enjoy, use, and appreciate their great resources today as the city continues to renew and define itself. It is also evident that the groups and communities in the area value their heritage and open space and are looking for ways to maintain and enhance these qualities. A study that looks at the natural, cultural, and recreational significance and values of the area could make recommendations on the best method to protect and use these resources while retaining the character of this part of Houston. As we have testified previously before this subcommittee, there are several steps we believe should be taken prior to Congress designating a national heritage area to help ensure that the heritage area is successful. Those steps are: 1. Lcompletion of a suitability/feasibility study; 2. Lpublic involvement in the suitability/feasibility study; 3. Ldemonstration of widespread public support among heritage area residents for the proposed designation; and 4. Lcommitment to the proposal from the appropriate players which may include governments, industry, and private, non-profit organizations, in addition to the local citizenry. H.R. 1776 and previous work in the community demonstrates the commitment to the idea of pursuing a study to look at further protection and preservation options. It is also apparent that there is widespread support for the Buffalo Bayou that will ensure public involvement. A critical element of the study will be to evaluate the integrity of the resources and the nationally distinctive character of the region before recommending national heritage area designation. We would be happy to work with the subcommittee and the bill's sponsor, Representative Green, to amend the legislation so that it is similar to other bills that have authorized studies of national heritage areas. We have attached proposed amendments at the end of this testimony. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks. I would be pleased to answer any questions you or other members of the subcommittee may have. Proposed Amendments H. R. 1776, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of establishing the Buffalo Bayou National Heritage Area in west Houston, Texas. On page 3, line 20 insert ``the City of Houston, and other appropriate organizations'' after ``the State of Texas,''. On page 3, line 19 insert ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary shall,'' and then insert a new paragraph (2) on page 3, line 23 as follows: ``(2) The study shall include analysis and documentation that the Study Area: (A) Lhas an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural resources that together represent distinctive aspects of American heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation, and continuing use, and are best managed through partnerships among public and private entities and by combining diverse and sometimes noncontiguous resources and active communities; (B) Lreflects traditions, customs, beliefs, and folklife that are a valuable part of the national story; (C) Lprovides outstanding opportunities to conserve natural, historic, cultural, and/or scenic features; (D) Lprovides outstanding recreational and educational opportunities; (E) Lcontains resources important to the identified theme or themes of the Study Area that retain a degree of integrity capable of supporting interpretation; (F) Lincludes residents, business interests, non-profit organizations, and local and state governments who are involved in the planning, have developed a conceptual financial plan that outlines the roles for all participants including the federal government, and have demonstrated support for the concept of a national heritage area; (G) Lhas a potential management entity to work in partnership with residents, business interests, non-profit organizations, and local and state governments to develop a national heritage area consistent with continued local and state economic activity; and (H) Lhas a conceptual boundary map that is supported by the public.

The Study Area shall be comprised of sites in Houston, Texas, in an area roughly bounded by Shepherd Drive and extending to the Turning Basin, commonly referred to as the Buffalo Bayou. ______ Mr. Hefley. Thank you very much. Let me ask a mechanical question first of all. The rules require that the administration testimony be submitted to us 2 days in advance. We got it last night about 7 o'clock, I think. What is the mechanical problem? This doesn't give us a chance to really go over your testimony and be prepared to ask intelligent questions and so forth. What is the mechanical problem connected with that and can that be corrected? Mr. Fulton. Mr. Chairman, I apologize for the delay in getting the reply. As you may know, the Secretary has been, quote, home alone at the Department of Interior. That today will be somewhat rectified by the swearing in of an additional six individuals. It literally has been a case of there has been not enough individuals at the Department, but that is a matter that is rectifying itself and I would certainly hope that in the future we could be more timely with our submissions. Mr. Hefley. Well, if you can, that will be very, very helpful to us. Mr. Fulton, you mentioned in your testimony that the Bureau of Land Management has only completed one of 14 management plans toward 14 monuments. How much time and money has the Bureau spent just on the management plan for the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and what do you see as the overall cost in staff time to complete the balance? Do you not agree that the monument designations by President Clinton which were accompanied by no budget or management plans just added to the already difficult fiscal and management problems faced by our Federal land managers? You know Clinton went on an orgy of naming monuments before he got out of office. I don't think there is any question about that. He was desperately searching, I guess, for a legacy and he thought this would be his legacy, and some of it is probably good and some of it is very questionable. So would you respond to that question, please? Mr. Fulton. Yes, sir. It is very clear that the Bureau of Land Management and the other land management agencies face a very, very complex and difficult mission as they administer public lands. These are public lands that are in everyone's backyard and everyone feels personally attached to at least their piece of public land. It is analogous, I guess, to the 14 monuments that were designated in the years 2000, 2001 as sort of like the pig and the python there. They are going through the land management process and it will cost millions of dollars, I don't know the exact number, and it will involve substantial numbers of people. The Grand Staircase Escalante management plan, I am not certain of the dollar amount that was expended there, and we can get that information for the Committee, but it was a 3-year planning process that involved certainly at least more than a million dollars. I am not sure what the exact amount was. Mr. Hefley. Well, I remember when Senator bill Armstrong was doing the Colorado Wilderness Act, trying to put that together, and you know, we had Senators from Colorado come and go working on that over the years. We had Senator Hart, we had Senator Wirth, and senator Armstrong finally got something done, but he knew where every mine, every claim, every road, every communication tower, he knew exactly where all of that was, and they planned the wilderness area with that in mind. You can't do that when a President just arbitrarily designates something because he thinks it is a good idea, and in this particular case it was very interesting that he didn't even think it was attractive enough to go there to do his announcement. He did the announcement in Arizona where he had a better background. By and large, shouldn't there be careful planning in advance before these things are done, and, as was indicated by Mr. Simpson, wasn't the purpose of the law to take care of things that, by gosh, there is going to be a Wal-Mart there if we don't do something immediately, let's do it now, not to do things that there is no imminent danger? And I have asked too many questions and I apologize. Mr. Fulton. That is all right. I will sort through them and see which ones I can answer. I think the Secretary shares your concern, which is why early on once she was sworn in she reached out by mailing out over 200 letters to every local county commissioner, tribal chair, State House and Senate, bipartisan, Republican and Democrat, governors, Members of Congress, senators of those States impacted and affected by the designation of these monuments in 2000 and 2001 because that is in fact what she wants to know through local consultation and communication, what is it that the impact of these monuments implies for these local areas. She also has not had the opportunity to visit all 20 of them but she very much wants to hear from local impacted individuals to see what it means in their lives. The Grand Staircase, for instance, in the southern counties of Utah represents, well, the public land base represents nearly 90 percent of the total for those counties. So anything that the Federal Government does in those areas, those rural areas, can have a tremendous impact on the local population and is something she wants to be very much aware of as she moves forward in the very difficult task of administering these monuments. Mr. Hefley. Mrs. Christensen. Mrs. Christensen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess I will direct my first question to Mr. Robbins. How long is the process on average for a property to be placed on the National Register? Mr. Robbins. Something between a year and 2 years. Each State has a National Register Review Board, which is a citizens advisory Committee, and so the process includes the investigation of the proposal, the preparation of the nomination, and then the nomination must go before each State's citizens advisory committee, the National Register Review Board, and those meetings are scheduled, depending on the State, either twice, three or four times a year, and then the nomination if it has the concurrence of the review board is then forwarded to the National Park Service for listing. Mrs. Christensen. Thank you. And you are not really opposing the inclusion of the lighthouse, you think it is a good property, you just agree with us on the process; is that correct? Mr. Robbins. In fact, we don't know that much about the lighthouse because the information hasn't been transferred to the National Park Service through the process. Mrs. Christensen. And you also indicated that there were other sources of funding that you would be happy to assist? Mr. Robbins. The two chief sources of funding for historic properties that are listed on the National Register are the Historic Preservation Fund, the portion of which is distributed to the States, and then the Save America's Treasures program, which is also funded through the Historic Preservation Fund, which has both a competitive and has an earmarked portion. Mrs. Christensen. Thank you. Mr. Fulton, in your testimony you said that there was strong public policy reasons for the administration to support 2114. Could you elaborate on those reasons for us? Mr. Fulton. Yes, ma'am. It is the local consultation, the need to visit with and fully understand the local concerns as these processes move forward, visiting with people at the front end of these monument designations in an effort to fully understand the impact that the Federal Government can have when it makes a specific land use designation. Mrs. Christensen. Well, we appreciate the consultation part of the bill and we did receive a letter from the Secretary. It is with our governor and I think we have responded to it. I am clear on the administration's support of the consultation and advocacy for the consultation part of the bill, but I am not clear whether the administration is in support of some of the other areas, the limitation placed on the monuments and the need for congressional approval of those monuments after 2 years. Does the administration also support that part of the bill? Mr. Fulton. It is my understanding that it does, yes. My testimony was cleared through the Office of Management and Budget representing the White House. It is my understanding that that testimony was approved by them. The size of these monuments can very dramatically impact the land use for local communities, and some of the monuments created are nearly 2 million acres in size, and the grand total for this special use category of land use within the Federal Government is, as I said, almost 100,000 square miles, representing the total land area of many States. This is a significant constriction on the multiple use that these lands were open for prior to their designation as a monument. Mrs. Christensen. I would think that you know that issue could have been settled during the consultation process, but for Congress to be able to by not approving and in essence overturn a presidential declaration, that limits the authority of the President and significantly changes the intent of the Antiquities Act. The administration supports that? Mr. Fulton. It is my understanding through the clearance of the testimony that it does. The Antiquities Act, as pointed out by Mr. Simpson, was meant to protect some of the cultural and archaeological resources and, to the smallest extent practicable, some of these monument designations in the millions of acres, they are extraordinarily large, and whether they are needed to protect those archaeological or antiquities resources is just an issue still open for debate. Mrs. Christensen. The bill also, just one short question, also says that any management plan shall comply with NEPA. Are monuments currently not required to comply with NEPA? Mr. Fulton. No, it is my understanding that well, under-- no, I believe that they do, that all the environmental laws that are relative and applicable would in fact be applied in monuments that are already extant and newly created monuments as well. Adequate environmental laws are already on the books. Mrs. Christensen. Apply. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hefley. Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. My understanding is that with the NEPA you do not have to go through the public comment period and everything else that is required by the NEPA process when you declare a National Monument and that is the intent of this, that you have to go through the public process, the same public process as all other environmental laws that are required. The concern of overturning a presidential declaration and authority of the President, this is authority given to the President by Congress. It is not authority in the Constitution. The Constitution gives Congress the right to make land use designations, and we have delegated some of that authority to the President to do that. Certainly we can overturn by law a presidential declaration of a monument or change it, as has happened. The concern is, and I will use this example just because it is one of the more recent ones, but with the Grand Staircase Escalante that was declared in 1995 or 1996, whenever it was, if the President declared that a National Monument and Congress wanted to overturn that, it would have to essentially have two- thirds vote in the House and Senate to override a presidential veto because the President would probably veto a bill overturning a National Monument that he created, and to me, that is just bassackwards from the way that things should act. Congress should be the ones to make these types of things maybe upon recommendation from the President, that is fine, but Congress ought to be involved particularly in these huge designations. And if you look back in the history, since 1906, at the designations, most of them were 160 acres, 1,100 acres, 1,600 acres. Occasionally--the Grand Canyon was 808,000 acres. I believe Congress would have probably acted to protect that, as we have. Since the Wilderness Act was enacted we have put over 128 million acres in national wilderness. So Congress has not been irresponsible in this area. 639 acres in Mount Olympus, but most of them were 2,000, 10,000, 20,000. And then in the later years as we get into the National Monument Act, if you look at as an example in the Carter years, 1.1 million, 350,000 acres, 1.2, 2.6, 3.8, 8.2, 10.9, 10.6 millions of acres and these monuments have become not what they were originally intended to protect these archaeologically significant areas and so forth, but they have become ways of taking huge tracts of land and making land use designations without any public input or the requirement for any public input, and that is my concern with this legislation and whether the law is actually being followed as it was intended. And I will use this example. Craters of the Moon expansion in Idaho took 52,000 acres and expanded it by an additional 660,000 acres. I wasn't opposed to it, and in fact I talked to the Secretary a couple of times about it and offered to run legislation to create it. It had been talked about several times in Idaho and so forth. But if you look at the standard by which you can declare a National Monument, that it has to be unique and geological and of some significance, that area qualifies. Has to be under some imminent threat. I repeatedly wrote to the Secretary and said what is the imminent threat of this area, and there is none. There is totally no imminent threat to this. You can't walk across this area. I mean it is nothing but lava rock. And he eventually told me that it was to protect from future mining claims. There are no mining claims out there. No one is going to want to mine out there, and the Antiquities Act is not to protect something from something that might happen in the future. It is for an imminent threat that currently exists. And so that is why this legislation is here. It is not to undermine the Antiquities Act. You know, I want to preserve these areas as much as anybody does, but I do believe the public has a right to have some participation and Congress has a right to have some participation in this designation. And this is not an anti-Clinton or an anti-anything else bill. It is one that says Congress ought to be responsible and take back some of its authority, but I appreciate the--I know that is not in the form of a question. I appreciate your testimony on the legislation, and I look forward to working with the administration on this and I appreciate the attitude of the administration. I know that they are not out to overturn national monuments willy-nilly or anything else, but they are asking for input from the public as to the effects of these national monuments and if changes need to be made or whatever so that they can look at it in a rational manner rather than just declare national monuments. I appreciate it. Thank you. Mr. Hefley. Mr. Gibbons. Mr. Gibbons. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I actually have only one comment to make and then perhaps one short question for Mr. Robbins, but with regard to public lands, Mr. Fulton, being in your backyard, Reno recently I read was designated as the highest density city per square mile of population of any city in the United States, registered number one, which points to me that in Nevada public land is not only in your backyard, it is your front yard and it is your side yard. The State of Nevada, something less than 90 percent of it is owned by the public and that is a large area of Nevada. In some counties we have 98 percent of the land in those counties owned by the public and it is indeed frustrating, difficult and many times impossible for local governments to use the property tax base to fund needed resources and operations within those counties. Mr. Gibbons. Now, that point being made, let me ask Mr. Robbins with regard to the lighthouse in Connecticut, I presume that lighthouse in Connecticut is publicly owned at this point in time, the university or--is there--and this would be my question, is there historic precedent for funding restoration of such lighthouses publicly owned in the past through the Park Service? Mr. Robbins. Yes, there is. Mr. Gibbons. So this is not something we are going to create out of whole cloth as a unique change or circumstance under which the government hasn't done this before. Mr. Robbins. I think the difference would be that previous funding, because Congress had begun the maritime initiative, which the National Park Service administers--the difference is that the emphasis through the maritime initiative is on already-listed National Register properties. Mr. Gibbons. Is there an effort, then, to transfer title to the National Park Service once these funds and restoration have been completed? Mr. Robbins. Through the maritime initiatives? Mr. Gibbons. Yes. Mr. Robbins. No. In fact, the effort is in the other direction. It is to find public or nonprofit owners other than the National Park Service for maritime resources including lighthouses. Mr. Gibbons. That is the only question I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Hefley. Mr. Cannon. STATEMNENT OF THE HON. CHRIS CANNON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Mr. Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our panel for coming today, and especially I would like to thank you, Mr. Fulton, for the attitude of this administration which is pleasant. I'd like to recall, to everyone's memory, the abuses of the Antiquities Act were truly monumental in their excess. The previous administration, as this Committee has pointed out in the past in a report, actually lied to the delegation from Utah about the imminent designation. And the public input was limited to a phone call of about one-half hour duration with the Governor of Utah, which was initiated by the President at 2 or 3 in the morning. Fortunately, the Governor had some handwritten notes at his bedside and was able to convey a number of points which were hastily included in the designation, but overwritten, undermined, and ignored in the planning process. So we appreciate your being here. Let me just say I recently had a couple of town hall meetings in the two areas. In fact, you pointed out, Mr. Fulton, these areas are nearly 90 percent public lands, these two countries that are affected. They are actually 93% public lands. And so, if the Federal Government sneezes, people die of pneumonia. And this is now years and years after the designation, after the plan has finally been finished. It was surprising to me to see the intensity of emotion and the pain that is still being felt in that area by those people on many levels on the level of just the invasiveness of some of the recent decisions of managers in the area, but also based upon the way the plan went forward. I think that what President Clinton did was deeply destructive of the faith and trust of the American people and has required that we in Congress act to put some constraints. I think this bill is infinitely reasonable but would not even be before the American people except for the abuses that the Antiquities Act was used to foist off on the American people. So we are anxious to work with you. We are thrilled. I would say the people in Utah have been waiting for the confirmation process, the political people from the Department of Interior were thrilled to see that happen. I have the greatest expectations that this administration will not respond with excess to the excesses of the prior administration, but with thought, with a process that is inclusive and helpful and that we will get on with solving some of the problems that have been created by the prior administration, which have been extreme in the lives of the few people that live at least in those two countries which wholly encompass the Grand Staircase- Escalante National Monument, which are both in my district. So we are pleased to have you here and look forward to working with y"
