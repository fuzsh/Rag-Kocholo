        "text": "Make no mistake! Simpson is working against the dairy industry, the water users and the entire state of Idaho. The rest of the Idaho Congressional delegation and the Governor of Idaho all oppose the secret, clandestine move by Simpson and Biden.\n\nJust imagine: Should Simpson and Biden get re-elected, the destruction of Idaho dams will move forward.\n\nI will never support anyone who wants to destroy any water storage in Idaho. In fact, I will push for expanded storage on every dam that can safely increase storage capacity. I also will push for the construction of a new properly constructed Teton Dam. I will also look for other projects to build such as Twin Pines on the Boise River. There are others that also deserve serious consideration for construction over the next five to ten years.\n\nIdaho needs more electric power, more water storage, and more water in the Snake River system. And the aquifer needs to be replenished through a massive increase in recharge. Teton Dam could significantly contribute to all these needs and more.\n\nEvery dairy operator in Idaho should vote for me because I will protect Idaho water, save our dams, and work to expand storage on the Snake River and its tributaries.\n\nThe choice is clear. The career politician who wants to destroy dams, or Scott Cleveland, a man who will always protect Idaho water and work with the delegation and the Governor to build more water storage and create more renewable energy with new water projects.\n\nFor more information about Scott Cleveland, go to ClevelandforCongress.org\n\nThis Op-Ed was submitted by Scott Cleveland. Op-Eds do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of those at the Idaho Dispatch.\n\nTags: Biden Administration, Chief of Staff, Dairy industry, Dam Breaching, Dams, Electric Power, Idaho Conservation League, Joe Biden, Lindsay Slater, Lower Granite Dam, Lower Snake River, Mike Simpson, Scott Cleveland, Teton Dam, Trout Unlimited USA, water storage"
