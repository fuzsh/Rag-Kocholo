        "text": "Erik Kanerva, Kempower's Sales Director for North Eastern Europe speaks about the company’s commitment to helping introduce fully electric public transport across Europe.\n\nDo you believe that government policy throughout Europe is strong enough to deliver on climate change reductions, and what part can you play?\n\nThe electrification of public transport is crucial to positively impacting climate change and there are many ways countries are working towards being green cities and many benefits that they can reap through the implementation of electric vehicles. There are an increasing number of cities that have already set strict measures to reduce emissions, such as zero-emission zones that restrict the movement of polluting vehicles, and cities with areas where it is forbidden to move with any other means than fully electric.\n\nAnother key benefit to the electrification of public transport is money. If you think about public transportation, the cost of an electric bus fleet throughout the lifecycle is lower than the cost of a traditional ICE bus fleet. The initial investment may be higher but overall operating costs are lower, leading to an eventual increased profit. Electric bus fleets are also quieter and more environmentally friendly than traditional ICE bus fleets, improving their impact on the communities they serve.\n\nKempower is the enabler of public transport. We offer a wide range of charging solutions to suit all EV charging needs in cities and our solutions cover everything from outdoor parking spaces to bus depots. In the future, the over-night cable charging of electric bus fleets at depots will become increasingly common: the Kempower S-Series advanced satellite charging system is the perfect multi-standard charging solution for bus depots.\n\nHow important is it that cities recognise the benefits of electric public transport, and what benefits does it offer?\n\nThe benefits of electric public transport are clear: lower emissions, less noise, improved air quality, improved well-being, and increased use of renewable energy sources like wind power and solar energy. With electric public transport, cities have more options to use different renewable energy sources. Electric public transport is also a nicer user experience for passengers – the passenger will have a smoother ride without the noise or disturbance of a traditional engine.\n\nKempower has supported bus operators in many pilot projects. One example is the fully electric bus line 23 in Helsinki, where we have combined cable charging and pantograph charging. This unique solution means that there are two methods of charging at the bus stop so if one fails, the bus can still be charged, thereby ensuring its continued operation.\n\nWhat specific technologies does Kempower offer to make a transition to electric buses an obvious and easy solution?\n\nKempower has helped many customers in the public transport sector to pilot electric bus fleets with our T-Series mobile DC chargers. The T-Series mobile charger is excellent for different pilot projects as the charger itself does not require any installation; just power. The cities and bus fleet operators can use the T-series charger to test the charging and operation of an electric bus fleet. Once they have completed testing and gained enough experience on how electric bus fleet charging works in daily life, they can plan and invest in more extensive charging infrastructure for green cities.\n\nKempower technology supports additional functionalities crucial for daily operations such as pre-heating, for example. We provide all kinds of chargers from mobile chargers to large charging solutions with dynamic power and cloud support, including both cable charging and pantograph charging. Our advanced satellite charging system is a perfect match for any size bus depot. The adaptive load management facilities ensure maximum energy efficiency, and the power management tools control energy delivery priority schemes – and also provides support for ready-to-run functions.\n\nIn addition to depot charging, our DC charging converter cabinets can deliver charging power using pantographs at a bus line’s final stop. The pantograph can be located on the roof of the vehicle or at the charging stations located at each bus route’s final stop. It works via an apparatus on the roof that can extend and charge off an existing line, allowing fast charging.\n\nOf all the projects you have been involved in, what would be the one you are most proud of, and why?\n\nWe have had a great start and have provided electric bus depot charging solutions in many Nordic countries which we are very proud of. We have also had the opportunity to further develop our charging technology together with the electric bus operators and manufacturers.\n\nWe want to continue our co-operation and relationship with all electric bus market players to continue developing and evolving our solutions for green cities. Nordic co-operation is really important to us and benefits all parties involved. We all have the same goal: to provide a smooth, low-emission electric bus ride to passengers so that they arrive to their destination on time and with minimal environmental impact.\n\nFinally, how do you see the market changing for electric buses over the next five years?\n\nWe can already see a strong growth in the market and expect this to continue, as not only the electric bus fleets, but also other fleets, like delivery vans, taxis, and minibuses, are turning electric.\n\nThe number of electric vehicles is rapidly rising all over the globe. Even cities have set the inspirational goal of going fully electric as a measure of being a greener city.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to create an EV charging infrastructure so extensive and reliable that electric vehicles can and will quickly become the new normal."
