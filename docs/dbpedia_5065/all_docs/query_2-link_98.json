        "text": "Arrive at any time. The tour starts in Vilnius, and the city's airport is Vilnius Airport (VNO). We recommend arriving a day or two early to fully explore Lithuania's capital city. This will also give you time to adjust to the time difference, overcome any jet lag, and avoid any disruption to your trip due to flight delays or cancellations. We can book extra hotel nights for you in Vilnius before the trip. Hotel Check-in and Welcome Meeting Please note that check-in at the hotel is usually around 2:00-3:00 p.m. There are no planned activities until an intro meeting around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m., usually in the hotel lobby. Check for a sign or ask at the reception desk about the exact time and location of the group meeting. Please make every effort to arrive in time for this meeting. If you are delayed and will arrive late, please inform us. Your tour leader will then leave you a message at the front desk informing you of where and when to meet up tomorrow. After the meeting, you might choose to get dinner at a nearby restaurant with your traveling companions and your tour leader to further get to know one another. Multi-faceted, puzzling, and a heady mix of old and new, Vilnius has all the glories of a royal past, the troubling reminders of wartime and Communist atrocities, and a vibrant forward-looking perspective. Joining Instructions When you arrive at the airport, you can reach Vilnius city center by public transport or taxi. Public transport: Blue screens at the airport exits display the public transport schedules, so you can find the next bus or train easily. Bus 88 will take you to the city center/Old Town area, and busses 1 and 2 will take you to the main central station, which is an easy 10-minute walk from the Old Town. Bus tickets are €1 and are purchased on the bus in cash. You need to stamp your ticket in the red or yellow validation machines by the driver. You can also catch a train from the Airport to Vilnius’ central station. This takes less than 10 minutes and costs under €1; however, you are advised to check the schedule, as they depart every 40 to 60 minutes. Taxi: There are plenty of taxis in a line outside the airport, but you can save a bit of money if you call to book a taxi yourself. You can ask the Vilnius Tourist Information Center (in the arrival hall of the airport) to call one for you. A taxi to the city center will be about €10-€15 and it takes 15-20 minutes. Accommodation: Comfort Hotel LT Rock'N'Roll Vilnius (or similar) * For the actual hotel your specific departure will be using, please check your voucher.\n\nSpend the whole day today exploring the Curonian Spit, located between Klaipeda and Nida. The Curonian Spit is a long, thin sand bar dotted with dunes that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea. This spit is shared by Lithuania and Kaliningrad, Russia's westernmost oblast. The tour will start in the morning with a 25-minute ferry ride. After arriving, drive up to Nida along the peninsula, making brief stops at Amber Bay, the Grey Herons and Cormorants Colony, and the Dead Dunes. We will also walk along the Hill of Witches, which used to be the site of dancing and gathering during Pagan festivals. Now, the hills are dotted with wooden statues created by local artists, depicting witches, dragons, and the elements. Some of the statues tell stories of the local legends and folklore, bringing the region to life with their intricate carvings. Midday, we will spend a few hours of free time in Nida where you can grab lunch and opt to see the Fisherman Museum and Nida Lighthouse if time allows. Later in the day, we will visit the Parnidis Dune and Sun Clock in Nida before traveling back to Klaipeda for the evening. There will be stops in both directions for photo opportunities. The tour will last 7 hours in total with 3 hours total of driving time. Approximate travel time: 3 hrs by private vehicle Accommodation: Dange Hotel (or similar) Meals included: Breakfast\n\nThere are no planned activities today, so you may depart at any time. The tour ends in Helsinki, and the nearest airport is Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (HEL). If you wish to extend your stay in Helsinki, consider booking post-tour accommodation with us. Please note that check-out time from the hotel is usually mid-morning, but luggage storage services are available at the reception desk. Want more adventure? Book two or more GEEO programs in the same school year and receive a discount! GEEO will give you 10% off of the lesser value program(s) (up to 3 programs per year). If you would like to extend your time abroad but don't see another GEEO program that interests you, let us know. We can work with you to find a trip from our tour operator’s much larger catalog. Their tours are open to the general public and not designed specifically for educators, but we can still offer you and your travel companions a discounted educator price on any additional tours that you book. Meals included: Breakfast\n\n*Itinerary Disclaimer: While it is our intention to adhere to the routes described on our website, there is a certain amount of flexibility built into the itinerary and on occasion it may be necessary, or desirable, to make alterations.
