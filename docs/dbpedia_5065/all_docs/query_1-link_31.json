        "text": "The public transport system in the Helsinki region is comprehensive and efficient. They are boasting diverse travel options, including buses, trams, ferries, metros, trains, and taxis. One can easily reach almost every corner of Helsinki by taking Helsinki’s public transport. The extensive coverage and reliable service aim to provide you with an enjoyable and convenient commuting experience. The price level is moderate and with the right ticket types, you can save also on the costs.\n\nThe public transport is mainly operated by Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) but also a few private companies operate some of the ferries to nearby islands. The same ticket is valid for all HSL transport modes but private operators have their own ticketing systems. Especially, when heading to the popular Suomenlinna Island, make sure to check who operates the ferry before boarding and that you have the correct ticket.\n\nHSL does not only serve the Helsinki region but also the neighbouring cities Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen. The public transport network is divided into zones so your ticket must include the necessary zones to travel legally. Travelling without a valid ticket results in a penalty of up to 80 euros.\n\nBuses in the Helsinki region play a significant role in connecting the city and its surrounding areas. With over a thousand buses in operation, Helsinki aims to provide a convenient and eco-friendly commuting experience for both locals and visitors.\n\nHelsinki’s bus routes are designed to cover all parts of the cities, from dense urban areas to suburbs. These buses operate frequently, with some running from early morning to late evening. In addition to regular buses, there are special night buses that cater to the needs of late-night commuters, especially on the weekends.\n\nMost of the buses are low-floor vehicles, making them accessible to passengers with mobility challenges. Many buses in Helsinki run on natural gas or electricity so they are also eco-friendly.\n\nBuses are named with numbers. To board a bus, you need to give a sign to the driver to show your intention to board. Otherwise, the bus may not stop. Enter the bus using the front door and show your ticket to the driver or the ticket reader. When you wish to exit, press the STOP button inside the bus and it will stop at the next bus stop. There is no ticket sale inside buses.\n\nThe tram system in Helsinki is one of the most iconic and recognizable modes of transport. The first tram line in Helsinki was opened in 1891, and since then, the system has grown into a network of more than 10 lines that cover the downtown and its surrounding areas. The trams in Helsinki are an essential part of the city’s public transport system and are widely used by commuters and visitors alike. The trams operate on a frequent and reliable schedule.\n\nThe Helsinki tram system is known for its punctuality, efficiency, and convenience, offering passengers a comfortable and enjoyable commuting experience. The trams are easily identifiable by their distinctive green colour scheme but sometimes, they are covered with ads. The tram lines also offer breathtaking views of the city’s landmarks and attractions, making it an ideal way to explore Helsinki. if you do not want to attend the arranged tours. The Helsinki tram service is an excellent choice for anyone looking for an efficient, affordable, and eco-friendly way to get around the Helsinki Centre.\n\nTrams are named with numbers. Because they do not automatically stop at every stop, you need to communicate to the driver by pressing the STOP button. Make sure you have a valid ticket before boarding the tram because it is impossible to buy a ticket inside a tram. You do not need to show your ticket to the driver when boarding the tram. There is no need to validate your ticket to the HSL machine.\n\nHelsinki has one light rail line, route 15. It runs from Keilaniemi in Espoo (western Helsinki area) to Itäkeskus (East Centre). The route conveniently intersects with all the commuter train lines, allowing for easy transfers between light rail and commuter trains.\n\nThe route 15 is long and it doesn’t reach the very centre of Helsinki. It’s good to note that at Itäkeskus, you can also transfer to the Helsinki Metro for further travel within the city. Light rail is one of the most comfortable ways to travel in Helsinki when you are outside the city centre.\n\nYou need the zone B ticket to travel on the light rail.\n\nHelsinki Metro is a rapid transit system that serves Helsinki and Espoo cities. It has been operating since 1982 and is the world’s northernmost metro system. The metro system consists only of 2 lines, and 30 stations, and has a total length of 43 km. It is the primary rail link between the eastern suburbs of Helsinki, the western suburbs of Espoo, and downtown Helsinki.\n\nThe metro is a convenient and reliable way to get from east to west, especially during rush hours.\n\nYou will recognize metro stations from the big orange-white letter M. A metro’s end station is visible in the front of the metro train and also on the information screens at the station. You need to buy a ticket before entering the metro platform. There is no ticket sale in metros so again ensure you have a valid ticket before boarding. Ticket inspections are common in the metro stations.\n\nFerries are an essential mode of transport in the Helsinki region, connecting the city to its numerous islands. Ferries to the UNESCO World Heritage site, Suomenlinna, are operated by the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) but there are also private ferry operators bringing visitors to Suomenlinna and other islands. Tickets between HSL Ferries and the other operator are not compatible.\n\nThe majority of the ferries depart from Helsinki Market Square and serve destinations such as Suomenlinna, Vallisaari, and Korkeasaari.\n\nThe ferries are reliable and run on a regular schedule during the summer, making it easy to plan your day trips to the islands. They are also comfortable, with indoor and outdoor seating options and amenities such as toilets. Private ferries have cafes or even bars on board. They also arrange lunch and dinner sightseeing cruises.\n\nYou will recognize the HSL ferries from the HSL logo. There is no ticket sale on the ferries so you need to buy one before boarding a ferry.\n\nCommuter trains in the Helsinki region are an integral part of the city’s public transport system, providing a reliable and convenient means of transportation for commuters travelling between the suburbs and downtown Helsinki. With over 200 trains running daily, the commuter rail network is one of the most extensive and efficient in Northern Europe. The trains are operated by the Finnish national railway company VR and offer a range of services, including comfortable seating. The trains are also wheelchair accessible, making them an inclusive mode of transportation for all.\n\nThe trains run on time, making them a popular choice for commuters who need to get to work or school on time. Additionally, the commuter trains are eco-friendly, reducing congestion on the roads and helping to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nCommuter trains are named with letters, for example, Train A heading to Leppävaara. It is important not to accidentally board a long-distance train because the HSL tickets are only valid on commuter trains. Long-distance trains do not use letter naming.\n\nThere is no ticket sale on commuter trains so you need to buy a ticket before boarding a train. A conductor is sometimes asking to see passengers’ tickets so be sure you have the right ticket type.\n\nA visitor to Helsinki usually meets a commuter train for the first time at Helsinki Airport. The lines P and I head from the airport to Helsinki Centre.\n\nThe Helsinki area has city bikes that can be rented. Unfortunately, there are two different systems: one maintained by Helsinki Region Transport and another maintained by the Vantaa city. The HSL system is available in Helsinki and Espoo and the Vantaa system is only in Vantaa. For travellers, the HSL system is more important since it covers the Helsinki centre.\n\nThe HSL city bike system is available from April to October. It consists of 4,600 bikes and 460 stations. The bikes are not free but you have to pay the subscription fee. The subscription includes unlimited rides but a single ride can last a maximum of 1 hour. For the extra time, you need to pay more.\n\nFor a traveller, a day subscription is the perfect choice costing 5 euros. If you spend more than a day in Helsinki, you can pay 10 euros for the whole week.\n\nRead more about the city bikes on the HSL website.\n\nThere are a few private companies offering scooters in Helsinki just like in other capitals and big cities. We do not recommend driving with them because you take a risk when driving in a strange traffic environment. However, if you still think you are a skilled enough scooter driver, you can easily find them in the Helsinki Center.\n\nIt is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol. Scooters have mandatory insurance in case of an accident. Please be polite when driving and park them in a way that they do not disturb the other traffic.\n\nHelsinki’s public transportation system is divided into several zones, each with its unique fare system. The zones, labelled A through D, determine the price of your ticket based on the number of zones you pass through. You must purchase a ticket for at least two zones to ride public transportation.\n\nThe downtown area is located in Zone A, while Zone B covers the rest of Helsinki and the closest parts of the neighbouring cities. If you’re travelling to the airport or other parts of Vantaa, Espoo, or Kauniainen, you’ll need to purchase a ticket including Zone C.\n\nThere are three important transport hubs in Helsinki.\n\nHelsinki Central Station\n\nHelsinki Central Station also known as Rautatiasema in Finnish is the most important transport hub in Helsinki. Helsinki Central Railway station is the end station for all commuter trains. It is also the main station for all commuter trains and long-distance trains departing from Helsinki. At Helsinki Central Station, you can connect to many bus lines and also the metro. Many tram lines pass Helsinki Central Railway Station.\n\nKamppi Bus Station\n\nKamppi Bus Station is about 1 kilometre from the central railway station. It is a big shopping mall where there is a bus station underground. Kamppi is the end station, especially for regional bus lines and also long-distance bus lines. The metro lines go through Kamppi, too. When the weather is bad, Kamppi Bus Station is one of the most pleasant places to have a bus connection.\n\nPasila Station\n\nPasila Railway Station is about 3 kilometres away from Helsinki Central Railway Station. All trains going to Helsinki Centre call at Pasila Station. Also, all trains leaving to different destinations call at the Pasila Station making it a popular connection point for passengers who need to connect from one train to another. The rebuilt Pasila Railway Station is attached to the popular Mall of Tripla which is the fourth largest shopping mall in Finland."
