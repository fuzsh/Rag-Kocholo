        "text": "Country Name\n\nFinland (Suomi)\n\nNational Railway System\n\nNational Railway Operator\n\nVR Oy (VR AB). VR was the official abbreviation of Valtionrautatiet (= State railway), but is now the company's full name.\n\nLanguage\n\nFinnish and Swedish are both official languages of Finland. Swedish is the first language of only 6% of the population, who live mainly in the south and west. Many public notices and signs are in both languages. In towns where the Swedish place name is used, the Finnish version is almost always shown as well.\n\nCurrency\n\nEuro\n\nUIC code\n\nnumeric 10; alpha FIN. This is shown on all new vehicles and is slowly being added onto existing VR rolling stock which was previously not numbered according to the UIC system.\n\nTimetable\n\nJourney Planner\n\nTimetables. For a journey now use “Timetable Search” at the top of the page; for a journey on a specific day/time use “Search Timetables” at the bottom of the page.\n\nActual Train Times\n\nA map showing the location of each train\n\nA list of trains This appears to be available only in Finnish\n\nDownloadable Timetable\n\nThe timetable PDFs for long distance and regional services are available only in the Finnish version of the website.\n\nTimetables gives a combined PDF of all long distance and regional services, using their long-established table numbers (as used in EGTRE), whereas \"Asemakohtaiset aikataulut\" leads to individual PDFs from a drop-down list of various routes or combinations of routes (table numbers are not given). A diagrammatic route map is available for the long distance and regional network.\n\nHelsinki suburban timetables : \"Route timetables\" leads to PDFs of suburban routes from a drop-down list, whereas \"Station timetables\" leads to PDFs of station departure lists from a drop-down list. A diagrammatic route map is available for the Helsinki suburban network.\n\nWorking timetable information, in graphical format, is available through the Julia website - go to this page, select the required route section from the drop-down box, insert required date, and press the green Hae button.\n\nPrinted Timetable\n\nPocket size timetables for other than suburban services are available at main stations but printed system timetables are no longer published.\n\nEngineering Information\n\nKorvaavat bussit provides information on replacement buses.\n\nMaps\n\nPrinted Maps\n\nEuropean Railway Atlas (All-Europe Edition) by M.G. Ball.\n\nEuropean Railway Atlas (Regional Atlas Series, Book 1: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Great Britain, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg) by M.G. Ball.\n\nRailways are depicted well in GT Tiekartasto Suomi-Finland, a road atlas with maps at 1:200,000 (1:400,000 north of Oulo).\n\nJussi Mäkinen's Järnvägshistorisk generalkarta över Finland, a railway map showing both current and historical lines in Finland, is available from Stenvalls bookshop and also the Railway Museum in Hyvinkää.\n\nWeb-based Maps\n\nMap of Finland dated June 2022 - on the Railroad Maps site.\n\nTicketing\n\nVery few stations have open ticket offices, the majority rely totally on ticket machines which have an English option and are straightforward to use. When purchasing for InterCity and Pendolino journeys, the machines automatically include a Reservation in the price and allocated seat details are displayed on the ticket. Advance on-line purchases offer substantial discounts for printed or phone-based tickets - again including seat Reservations. It is not compulsory to have a reserved seat to board an IC or Pendelino train (for example, if using an InterRail ticket) but as seats are not physically marked as reserved you may be asked to move by a passenger holding a reservation.\n\nWithin the Helsinki suburban area, tickets must be purchased (or held) before boarding trains. Outside this area, tickets can also be bought on the train: on Regional trains on rural lines from on board machines where there are no guards, or on main lines from on board staff. However, such purchases will be at a slightly higher fare than from station machines. Cash is no longer accepted as payment; long distance tickets can be purchased from train conductors and railbus vending machines only with payment cards. On some trains, carriages in which tickets cannot be purchased are indicated by prominent signs on the outside. A penalty fare system operates - a substantial penalty is charged in addition to the fare if a passenger is found without a valid ticket.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure Authority\n\nVäylävirasto Trafikledsverket, the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency is responsible for railway infrastructure.\n\nNetwork Statement\n\nThe Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency Network Statement, Railways provides a list of Network Statements by year. Click on \"in English\" at the top of the screen to obtain the documents in English.\n\nGauge\n\n1524 mm. A study has concluded that converting the 1524 mm broad gauge national railway network to the European standard of 1435 mm would not be financially viable.\n\nOther systems:\n\nHelsinki Metro - 1522 mm;\n\nHelsinki trams and Jokeri Light Rail - 1000 mm;\n\nTampere Tramway - 1435 mm.\n\nElectrification\n\n25kV 50Hz\n\n750 V DC Third Rail - Helsinki Metro\n\n600 V DC Overhead - Tramways and Light Rail\n\nRule of the Road\n\nRight hand running but most of the network is single-tracked, while the Helsinki Airport Loop is left hand running. Double track lines are mostly equipped with bidirectional signalling. Unusually, on four-track lines the directions are ↓↑↑↓ - i.e. the right hand pair of lines is left-handed. From Pasila to Kerava the tracks are southbound fast; northbound fast; northbound local; southbound local. Similarly on the coast line (Pasila - Leppävaara): eastbound fast; westbound fast; westbound local; eastbound local.\n\nDistances\n\nThe Network Statement (see Network Statement) gives overall distances for each section (Appendix 1) and detailed distances for each station from Helsinki in alphabetical order (Appendix 2).\n\nDistances for current operational locations are shown on the graphical working timetables available through the Julia website - go to this page, select the required route from the drop down list (the date box is immaterial) and press the green Hae button. The milepost distances (in km) are down the left axis of the graph. Bear in mind that - in consequence of route relocations around the system - there are various short and long kms so the milepost distance may not represent today's actual travel distance.\n\nOther Railways\n\nKarhulan - Sunnilan rautatie (a freight line near Kotka)\n\nTourist Lines\n\nJokioisten Museorautatie: Humppila - Jokioinen (750 mm gauge)\n\nNykarleby Jernvag: from Kovjoki, along 2 km of the trackbed of the former VR Uusikaarlepyy branch (600 mm gauge).\n\nPorvoon Museorautatie is responsible for the line between Olli and Porvoo; they operate diesel railcar excursions through from Kerava and Helsinki on summer weekends (1524 mm gauge).\n\nSteamrail – Höyryraide Ay operate occasional steam excursions from Nurmes (1524 mm gauge).\n\nAn annual listing is produced by Resiina magazine and the Heritage Railway Association of Finland, and available at the Heritage Trains web page. This list includes specials operated over other VR lines in summer by preservation societies.\n\nThe Scandinavian Railways Society website gives links to the Finnish Railway Museum and the Helsinki Tram Museum.\n\nRail cycling is available between Pori and Kankaanpää.\n\nMetro\n\nHelsinki Region Transport is owned jointly by several local authoritties in the Helsinki area.\n\nA 7km extension from Matinkylä to Kivenlahti was opened on 3 December 2022.\n\nTrams/LRT-Systems\n\nHelsinki Region Transport Trams.\n\nThe 25 km Raide-Jokeri (Jokeri Light Rail) system, which runs from Itäkeskus (in eastern Helsinki) to Keilaniemi (in Espoo) opened to traffic on 21 October 2023.\n\nTrack plans for the metro, tram system and the Jokeri Light Rail system are available on the Gleisplanweb site.\n\nThe first part of Phase 2 of the Tampere Tramway, a 2 km extension of line 3, opened on 9 August 2023. The next part, section 2B is to be completed at the end of 2024, and traffic to Lentävänniemi is scheduled to begin on 7 January 2025.\n\nSee also Finland - Tram services over obscure routes\n\nRecent and Future Changes\n\nElectrification work on the the Laurila – Tornio – Haparanda (Sweden) line, started at the beginning of April 2023.\n\nThe Helsinki - Turku line is closed from 15 August 2022 until 2024 between Kupittaa and Turku for major engineering work, including doubling the line.\n\nFinland objected strongly to the European Commission proposal in July 2022 that new lines should be built to the standard gauge of 1435mm, and key routes of other gauges converted. See below.\n\nOn 6 April 2022 the VR Group board decided to stop all freight traffic between Finland and Russia. It began the process of terminating its cross-border freight contracts, with traffic expected to cease completely by the end of 2022 at the latest. However, it then decided to continue transporting commodities not subject to EU sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe Allegro service between Helsinki and St Petersburg was discontinued from 28 March 2022 as part of the sanctions against Russia. The Tolstoi overnight train between Helsinki and Moskva was suspended by RZD on an unknown date as a result of the Covid pandemic. In August 2022, VR Group decided to write off all Allegro trains and their spare parts. They do not plan to resume their use.\n\nThe Network Statement states that the Seinäjoki - Kaskinen line will be maintained only until 31 December 2022, so it will presumably close after this date.\n\nThe 16 km first phase of the standard gauge Tampere Tramway opened on schedule on 9 August 2021.\n\nThe government and relevant local authorities have established companies to plan two major projects and granted €40m to cover the costs of planning:\n\nWork on the design of the Turun Tunnin Juna Oy (One Hour Train) project, a 95km high speed line between Espoo (west of Helsinki) and Salo (east of Turku) and double-tracking Salo – Turku, was approved in December 2020. In October 2021 responsibility was transferred from the national infrastructure agency to the dedicated project body. Planning is scheduled to be complete by 2023, with the cost split between the national and local governments. The line is due to open in early 2030.\n\nFinnish Rail will develop plans for new alignments and additional tracks to provide a 1 hour journey time between Helsinki and Tampere via Helsinki Airport. This appears to be an enhancement to the 2019 project to develop a Riihimäki – Tampere high speed line.\n\nFour sections of line were scheduled to close from 27 March 2016 but the Ministry of Transport postponed the closures pending decisions on the possible opening up the passenger rail sector to competition, so the lines remain open until further notice:\n\n11 Orivesi - Haapamäki 11 Jyväskylä – Haapamäki – Seinäjoki 14 Joensuu – Nurmes 17 Joensuu - Viinijärvi - Varkaus\n\nA 14 km westward extension of the Helsinki Metro to Matinkylä opened on 18 November 2017. A Further westward extension to Kivenlahti is under construction with planned opening in 2023.\n\nThe line north from Seinojaki to Oulu is being doubled with parts in use by 2017. The freight line to the Russian border at Vartius and others to Pietarsaar and Talvivaara have been electrified, and Jyväskylä - Äänekoski was being electrified in 2016.\n\nThe FinEst Link project to build a 92 km under-sea tunnel between Helsinki and Tallinn, originally projected to open in December 2024, has been delayed by up to six years after the Helsinki-Uusimaa regional council voted to route the line under the capital rather than direct to Helsinki Airport.\n\nThe 18 km Helsinki Kehärata Ring Line (Vantaankoski - Helsinki-Vantaa Airport - Hiekkaharju) opened on 1 July 2015 (see routes I and P on schematic route plan).\n\nThe last train ferry connecting with Sweden, between Turku and Stockholm Värtan, closed on 31 December 2011.\n\nAllegro high-speed trainsets were introduced in December 2010 on the two daytime services between Helsinki and St Petersburg, cutting the journey time from six to 3½ hours.\n\nThe Kemijärvi - Kelloselka line closed after the last freight ran on 28 July 2010.\n\nA new 19 km freight-only line from Savio, south of Kerava on the main Helsinki-Tampere line, to the harbour at Vuosaari in eastern Helsinki, started operating in November 2008.\n\nA high speed line from Kerava to Lahti - a short cut from Helsinki towards the east and St Petersburg - opened to passengers on 3 September 2006.\n\nElectrification from Oulu to Rovaniemi was completed in December 2004 and from Iisalmi to Oulu in December 2006.\n\nExtensive work has been carried out on the main line between Helsinki and Tampere, a major new alignment at Lempääla coming into use in 2002.\n\nThe Pönttövuori tunnel, between Jyväskylä and Lievestuore, came into use in 1995 in connection with electrification from Jyväskylä to Pieksämäki.\n\nSpecial notes\n\nThe spelling of proper names in Finnish varies according to grammatical case. The name of the Finnish capital is Helsinki, but this appears as Helsingistä (from Helsinki), Helsinkiin (to Helsinki), Helsingin (Helsinki's) and in Helsingissä (in Helsinki), as well as Helsingfors in Swedish. Many towns have names in both Finnish and Swedish, eg: Oulu - Uleåborg, Pori - Bjorneborg, Tampere - Tammerfors\n\nLong distance trains also include special areas to be used by those travelling with dogs or other animals. IC and IC2 trains have compartments for passengers suffering from allergies. All parts of Pendolino trains are stated to be designed for passengers with allergies, except for the carriage where animals are permitted.\n\nGauge Conversion\n\nAs part of its ongoing revision of the Trans-European Transport Network Regulation, and following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in July 2022 the European Commission proposed a requirement that all new railway lines on TEN-T routes should be built to 1435 mm gauge, and called for a migration plan for the conversion of existing lines. The suggestion was criticised by Finland.\n\nIn December 2022 the Ministry of Transport & Communications commissioned a preliminary report into gauge conversion. The report was published on 12 April 2023 and considers three scenarios, assessing accessibility, sustainability, efficiency and transport security:\n\nConstruction of a new 1435 mm gauge main line parallel to the existing 814 km broad gauge route from Helsinki to Tornio on the Swedish border, which would facilitate international services and simplify rolling stock procurement. In June 2024 the Ministry directed the Transport Agency to draft a feasibility report on a line from Oulu to Haparanda.\n\nConstruction of new Helsinki - Tampere, Helsinki – Turku, Helsinki – Kouvola – Joensuu and Kouvola – Kuopio – Kajaani lines to 1435 mm gauge, which is deemed worthy of further analysis;\n\nRegauging only those lines on TEN-T routes to 1435 mm. This would have negative consequences for freight traffic and would be less cost-effective than converting the entire network.\n\nDual gauging is not practical, as the 89 mm gauge difference is too small for a three rail configuration. Four rail interlacing would cause problems with pantographs and overhead electrification geometry.\n\nThe study has therefore concluded that converting the 1524 mm broad gauge national railway network to the European standard of 1435 mm would not be financially viable. Whilst recognising that regauging would facilitate international passenger and freight traffic and could simplify rolling stock procurement, the study determined that the conversion costs would too high in relation to the potential benefits."
