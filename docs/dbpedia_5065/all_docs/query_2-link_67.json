Their concept is based on the modern ForCity Classic Miskolc trams, which are designed for the Hungarian city of Miskolc. Bratislava’s ForCity Plus trams are bi-directional and low-floored, equipped with modern electronics. Trams are five-sectional and carry up to 350 passengers. The first and last bogies are fully reversible and have a 1000 mm gauge.\n\nTrams offer enough space for passengers, suitable location of restraints and very quiet operation. The vehicles are fully air-conditioned, including the driver’s cabin. For passengers with reduced mobility, a tilting platform is ready. There is also a device for voice communication between the blind passengers and the driver in the vehicle. Of course, there is also a clear audiovisual, information and CCTV system.\n\nTramcar Forcity Plus Bratislava\n\nA modern uni-directional, five-section tramcar for the slovak capital Bratislava\n\nThe uni-directional tram ForCity Plus is designed for the Slovakian Bratislava. The vehicles are fully air-conditioned and offer a comfortable ride at a high level. The capacity is up to 345 passengers - including 69 seats. Of course there is also a clear visual information system, including devices for voice communication between blind passengers and the driver. For passengers with reduced mobility, a tilting platform is installed, which facilitates entry and exit. The safety of passengers is ensured by a camera system with six indoor and six outdoor cameras.\n\nThe concept of the new low-floor trams ForCity Plus is based on the modern trams ForCity Classic Miskolc, that are already operated in the Hungarian city of Miskolc. The vehicles have five sections and a track gauge of 1000 mm. The first and last body chassis is fully rotatable. The maximum speed of the vehicle is 65 km/h.\n\nTramcar Forcity Classic Konya - Battery\n\nThe tramcar uses a battery-powered drive\n\nDuring 2015, twelve unique “catenary-free” tramcars will be delivered to the ancient Turkish city of Konya (with a population of over 1.1 million). These tramcars are the ForCity Classic type and they are equipped with a state-of-the-art traction battery powered drive which allows them to operate independently of overhead lines. The vehicles will be operated on a newly built route which has a total length of 6 km, of which approx. 2 km will be without overhead lines. The Škoda company will use state-of-the-art high-power batteries in these tramcars for the Turkish city of Konya. Škoda Transportation also offers an alternative solution using a combination of traction batteries and super capacitors.\n\nThe battery powered drive of tramcars is used mainly in cases when a tramcar passes through an area where it is impossible to install a power supply trolley, for example, due to aesthetic reasons in historical city centres. The battery powered drive can also be used when a tramcar needs to leave a frequented place in the case of a fault on the overhead power lines so that it will not obstruct the road traffic. The batteries of a battery powered tramcar are located in special roof containers where batteries of various types and capacities can be installed according to the required nature of the operation. The battery is recharged while the tramcar is moving under a trolley, for example, when driving on a section of a route which is fitted with overhead lines or while standing in a depot.\n\nTramcar Forcity Classic Konya\n\nFully low-floor tramcar for the Turkish city of Konya\n\nThe Škoda Transportation Company produces a 100% low-floor tramcar for the Turkish city of Konya. The new vehicle conception is based on the tram ForCity Classic for the Hungarian city of Miskolc. This fully low-floor bi-directional tram is equipped with modern electronics. The difference consists for example in the vehicle body that is longer and narrowed by 100 mm down to 2,55 m. The central undercarriage is equipped with a parking brake and front rear-view mirrors on both sides of the driver’s compartment. The air-condition system has been adapted to climatic conditions in Turkey. Unique is especially the design inspired by the motifs of Islamic architecture and the world uniqueness of the city of Konya –whirling Dervishes.\n\nThe fully low-floor five-section tram Škoda ForCity Classic Konya complies with the latest European safety standards. The tram has low operating costs because it takes advantage of energy recuperation when braking. Because the electric equipment is placed on the roof of the vehicle and the tram is more than 32 meters long, it can offer space for up to 364 passengers. The fully low-floor design and the low boarding edge allow easy getting on and off even for disabled persons. The air-condition system as well as well-arranged information system contribute to the comfort of the passengers.\n\nTramcar Forcity Classic Miskolc\n\nFully low-floor bidirectional tramcar for hungarian city of Miskolc.\n\nŠkoda Transportation produced a 100% low-floor bi-directional tram for the Hungarian city of Miskolc. The vehicle follows a series of bi-directional vehicles which became popular among the passengers in the Italian city of Cagliari, American Portland or Polish Wroclaw. Fully low-floor five-section Škoda ForCity Classic meets the latest European safety standard which guarantees greater safety for both the passengers and the driver in the case of a possible accident.\n\nEasily accessible electric equipment is located on the roof of the vehicle, during braking there is energy recuperation which together with the asynchronous traction motors reduces the costs of operation and maintenance. The tram Škoda ForCity Classic has a wider body than the previous types and can offer space for up to 300 passengers. The overall low-floor design and boarding edge at the height of 330 mm above the top of rail allows easy boarding and exiting of passengers. The platforms next to the doors offer enough space for bicycles, prams or persons with reduced mobility. Air-conditioning and a clear information system also contribute to the comfort of passengers.\n\nTramcar Forcity Alfa Prague\n\n100% low-floor uni-directional three-section tramcar\n\nThe fully low-floor tram ForCity Alfa represents a new generation of modern vehicles in municipal transport; it combines elegance, dynamics and the latest technologies.

The greatest advantage of the ForCity Alfa tram are pivoting bogies which are friendly to tracks and reduce the maintenance costs of the vehicle and the infrastructure. The optimum speed is controlled by a computer according to the number of passengers, condition of the track and profile of the route. The tram ForCity Alfa has a wheel slip and wheel slide protection.\n\nIn comparison with older trams the operation of the ForCity Alfa tram is much quieter thanks to the direct wheel drive without gearboxes and special tyres with absorbing rubber inserts. An entry space without stairs makes boarding and exiting easier for families with prams or passengers with reduced mobility. A clear information system, easily accessible control buttons of doors or for example a communication link with the cabin of the driver contribute to the comfort of passengers. Ergonomically shaped wooden seats which were chosen by passengers themselves in a survey constitute also an innovation.\n\nTramcar Forcity Alfa Riga\n\n100% low-floor uni-directional three-section tramcar\n\nThe fully low-floor tram ForCity Alfa Riga, produced by Škoda Transportation for the Latvian capital city, represents a new generation of modern vehicles in the municipal public transport. It embodies elegance, dynamics and the latest technologies. The tram ForCity Alfa is designed to cope with the most demanding profiles of railway networks without any problems, and it does so also thanks to the individual wheel drive.\n\nPivoting bogies which are friendly to the tracks and reduce the maintenance costs of the vehicle and the infrastructure are a noticeable feature of the tram ForCity Alfa. Thanks to the modular design of the tram ForCity Alfa, it was possible to easily adjust the version for Riga to a greater track gage (1,524 mm). The less demanding profile of the routes in Riga makes it possible for the ForCity Alfa tram to have only three traction bogies. The optimum speed is controlled by a computer according to the number of passengers, condition of the track and profile of the route. The tram ForCity Alfa has a wheel slip and wheel slide protection.\n\nForCity Alfa is very quiet due to special wheel tyres with absorbing rubber inserts. An entry space without stairs makes boarding and exiting easier for passengers with prams or with reduced mobility.

The electric equipment is located in a container on the roof of the vehicle. The trolleybus can be also equipped with an auxiliary diesel generator which is located in the rear part of the vehicle and which makes it possible to drive the vehicle even in places lacking trolley lines. An asynchronous traction motor and a voltage inverter controlled by a microprocessor with a recuperation option significantly reduce the energy intensity of operating the vehicle and its maintenance costs.\n\nThe comfort of passengers is improved by the overall low-floor design of the vehicle and by wider aisles between the seats. Boarding and exiting of passengers is made easier by means of the so-called kneeling when the trolleybus tilts to the edge of the pavement. An efficient system of heating and a clear information system also improve the comfort of passengers. There is also a tilting platform for wheelchair users.
