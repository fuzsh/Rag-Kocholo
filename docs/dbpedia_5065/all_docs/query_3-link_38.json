        "text": "In 2021, Jyväskylä was about to issue a tender for the procurement of public transport services. The city was taking steps towards clean public transport. Before announcing the tender, Jyväskylä wanted to find out under which technical and economic conditions electrification of public transport would be possible for them.\n\nThe officials in Jyväskylä recognised that the city's high-altitude differences affect the energy consumption of vehicles and could present a challenge for electrification. In addition, they wanted to find out whether the city's bus fleet, the number of passengers on routes, and the bus occupancy rates were suitable for electric mobility.\n\nTo build a better understanding within its organisation, Jyväskylä partnered with VTT.\n\n\"We wanted VTT's support in the decision-making process as we knew that they had successfully helped, for example, the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) transition to emission-free transport,\" Kari Ström, Service Director of Urban planning and City infrastructure of Jyväskylä, describes the start of the cooperation.\n\nVTT Smart eFleet analysis service has been developed to support decision-making, for example, in the public sector. It can be used to simulate and analyse different vehicles and infrastructure in their geographical environments, and to design a reliable and cost-effective low-carbon public transport system.\n\nThe Smart eFleet analysis in Jyväskylä's assignment began with the collection of the initial data needed for the simulation. The initial data comprised existing vehicle duty cycles, passenger volumes, timetables, and local energy prices, among other things.\n\n\"With the help of Jyväskylä's skilled traffic planning team, we were able to put together the initial data quickly,\" says Rafael Åman, Research Team Leader at VTT. \"We also used public mapping services to retrieve terrain data and used it to model the bus routes. The data collected formed the basis for our simulation and analysis.\"\n\nTo support Jyväskylä’s tendering process for public transport services, three clean energy carrier options were studied: biodiesel, biomethane and electricity. The focus of the study was on costs, which included the initial investment costs as well as infrastructure, energy and labour costs.\n\nVTT selected three different types of electric buses for the study. The VTT Smart eFleet tool was used to simulate several different options for electrification: various bus sizes and battery capacities with both depot charging and high-power charging options. Jyväskylä was also concerned about the emissions from auxiliary diesel heaters used in electric buses and their impact on air quality at the bus stops in the city centre. Thus, an estimate was made of the type of fleet that could operate on electricity alone, even in sub-zero temperatures.\n\nAfter two review rounds, Jyväskylä decided to commission further studies from VTT to ensure that even the last remaining questions were answered.\n\n\"We wanted to further strengthen our overall understanding of what electric transport means for us,\" says Ström.\n\nThe additional assignment meant simulating a few new routes. \"With this additional assignment, the question of whether electricity was a viable option was no longer a concern. The simulation showed that by choosing a shorter route with lower passenger load levels, electricity becomes a competitive option,\" says VTT's Åman.\n\n\"It was great to see Jyväskylä's strong commitment to low-emission transport. This was reflected in the way all options were considered thoroughly, leaving no room for second-guessing. It was a pleasure to be able to help Jyväskylä on this journey.\"\n\n\"Based on the results obtained, we defined the quality score of the energy carrier in our tender. The quality scores for electricity and biomethane were the same. However, for the contract period starting in June 2024, the winning operator is going to use significantly more electric buses than we required,\" Ström says.\n\n\"With that, Jyväskylä's public transport will have the second highest number of low- or zero-emission buses in Finland when the number of electric buses is compared to the total fleet.\"\n\nVTT also praises the fruitful cooperation.\n\n\"With VTT Smart eFleet, we want to make a substantial impact on society. Our ambition is to reduce emissions and contribute to a healthier planet. Jyväskylä’s assignment was therefore a perfect fit for us,\" sums up VTT's Åman."
