        "text": "Van Hool is fully committed to 100% zero emission vehicles.\n\nSince 2014, fifteen Van Hool hybrid articulated trambuses have been operating in Malmö.\n\nVan Hool has produced more than 1,200 electrically powered vehicles.\n\nVan Hool, an independent manufacturer of buses, coaches and industrial vehicles has concluded a contract with Nobina, the largest passenger transport company in Scandinavia, for the delivery of 21 battery-electric 24-meter articulated trambuses of the Exqui.City model. The trambuses will go into service mid-2022 in Malmö (Sweden) for public passenger transport. The vehicles are plug-in battery-electric and will be charged in the Nobina depot in Malmö.\n\nFilip Van Hool, CEO of Van Hool, said:\n\nThis order confirms the confidence that Nobina has in Van Hool. This is a new and important reference for Van Hool and it represents the undeniable proof of the company's technological power. Van Hool is fully committed to its 100% zero emission bus and coach range. We are convinced that the various 100% zero emission solutions we offer – battery-electric, trolley and hydrogen – can, depending on the local application, provide an answer to the environmental and sustainability initiatives that public transport companies worldwide are undertaking. As an independent Belgian manufacturer of buses and coaches, with customers all over the world, we have delivered no fewer than 1,200 electrically powered vehicles, so far Van Hool’s strength lies in the fact that we have gained a lot of experience in various complex types of electrically powered vehicles, including 100% battery electric vehicles, and the charging infrastructure that goes with it.\n\nThe Exqui.City combines the flexibility of a bus with the efficiency of a tram. These trambuses have a distinct futuristic design and a high level of comfort with air conditioning, low noise levels and soft lighting. They offer optimal accessibility with a low boarding height, and easy entry and exit thanks to the four double doors. This type of vehicle is built on a multi-power platform that is now 100% zero emission: battery-electric, trolley and hydrogen. This platform makes the Exqui.City, in both the 18 and 24 meter versions, a basis for the use of these different eco-friendly power systems.\n\nJens Råsten, Fleet Manager at the Nobina Group, said:\n\nWe feel pride in continuing this journey together with Skånetrafiken and Van Hool, introducing the next generation of 24 meter, fully electric zero emission tram buses – the first of its kind in the Nordics. Further developing the modern, safe and sustainable public traffic solution in Malmö.\n\nWith the Exqui.City, available in 18 and 24 meter versions, Van Hool offers a realistic answer to the demand for safe, environmentally-friendly, efficient and cost-effective urban public transport. There are already more than 300 trambuses operating in 17 cities, primarily in Europe but also in Martinique (a French overseas department).\n\nVan Hool is an independent Belgian bus, coach and industrial vehicle manufacturer. The company, which was founded in 1947, is based in Koningshooikt. The vast majority of units produced are destined for Europe and the US. Van Hool has around 3,300 staff worldwide, the majority of whom work at the production facilities in Koningshooikt (Belgium) and Skopje (North Macedonia).\n\nThis article was originally published by Van Hool NV.\n\nTags"
