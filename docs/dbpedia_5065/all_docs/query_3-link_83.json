        "text": "(19.4.2024, updated 13.7.2024)\n\nSuomeksi\n\n1862\n\nThe first railway connection in Finland between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna was opened. There were some stations also in Helsinki region, alltough the trains ran only twice a day. The trains were operated by Finnish State Railways (VR).\n\n1886\n\nThe local train traffic started with trains driven by light locomotives from Schweitzerische Lokomotiv und Maschinenfabrik.\n\n1888\n\nThe public transport in Helsinki officially started. A private company Omnibus - Aktiebolaget i Helsingfors (Helsingin Omnibusosakeyhtiö) was established. It started to run horse-omnibuses.\n\n1890\n\nCompany changed it's name to Helsingin Raitiotie- ja Omnibusosakeyhtiö (HRO). It started to run horse-trams alongside the horse-omnibuses.\n\n1900\n\nThe first electric tram route was opened. The trams had green and yellow livery. The lines were colour-coded, but usually they were called according to destination.\n\nThe horse-omnibuses were withdrawn.\n\n1901\n\nThe last horse-trams of HRO were withdrawn.\n\n1907\n\nThe first trial to operate an omnibus. It did not last long because of poor road conditions.\n\n1910\n\nA private company Ab Brändö Villastad started a tramway line to and in Kulosaari island. They used a special tram ferry when crossing the sea between Sörnäinen and Kulosaari. They used HRO cars.\n\n1913\n\nThe city of Helsinki became the majority owner of HRO.\n\nJulius Tallberg started a horse-tram operation in Lauttasaari.\n\n1914\n\nM. G. Stenius Oy started a tramway operation to Haaga.\n\n1915\n\nKulosaari tramway was operated by a subsidiary of Ab Brändö Villastad called Brändö Spårvägs Ab.\n\nM. G. Stenius started a tramway operation to Munkkiniemi, too.\n\n1917\n\nThe horse-tram operation in Lauttasaari ended.\n\n1918\n\nBoat traffic to nearby islands started.\n\nThe tramways were operated by Helsingin Kaupungin Raitiotiet during the civil war for a while.\n\n1919\n\nThe bridge to Kulosaari was completed. No need for the ferry anymore.\n\n1921\n\nThe omnibus traffic started in the whole Finland. In Helsinki region buses ran from Helsinki city centre to nearby countryside and further. Public transport inside Helsinki was run by trams.\n\n1925\n\nHRO started its first tram route outside Helsinki borders.\n\n1926\n\nThe tram lines received route numbers alongside the colour codes.\n\n1928\n\nA new bus operator Oy Omnibus Ab started operating. It was different from all other bus operators, because it ran its red buses in Helsinki city centre competeing with the city-owned trams.\n\nKulosaari, Haaga and Munkkiniemi tramway operations were transferred to HRO.\n\n1936\n\nHelsingin Raitiotie- ja Omnibusosakeyhtiö (HRO) started to run buses as well. The buses were painted dark blue with a silver stripe.\n\nHRO bus, Büssing NAG / Autoteollisuus. Photo: Helsinki city museum\n\n1937\n\nSome privately operated bus routes were transferred to HRO. So HRO ran buses also outside Helsinki borders. At the end of the year Oy Omnibus Ab merged to HRO. Now HRO also had some red buses.\n\n1939 - 1940\n\nThe winter war.\n\n1941 - 1944\n\nThe continuation war. Most of public transport in Helsinki was operated by trams driven by women.\n\n1945\n\nHelsingin Raitiotie- ja Omnibusosakeyhtiö (HRO) was changed to Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos (HKL) (Helsinki city transport).\n\n1946\n\nAll current suburbs of Helsinki, except Vuosaari and Östersundom, were incorporated into the city of Helsinki.\n\nNow all HKL tram and bus routes ran within Helsinki. Now also many private bus operators had their routes inside Helsinki. However HKL planned its own routes and created its own tariff with zones. Private operators used a kilometre-based tariff, which was used all over Finland.\n\n1949\n\nHKL started trolleybus operation. There was one route numbered 14 between Eira and Naistenklinikka in Meilahti.\n\nHKL trolleybus\n\nThere were 17 private bus operators operating in Helsinki region. Six of those operated inside Helsinki alongside with HKL. Every operator had it's own livery.\n\nThere were buses, trams, trolleybuses, local trains and ferries operating in Helsinki region.\n\nStandard HKL bus, 1950's, Scania-Vabis B62 / Helko.

Nevalainen\n\n1954\n\nNew Finnish local trains (\"lättähattu\") started to replace old trains driven by steam locomotives.\n\nThe tram lines used only route numbers. No more colour codes.\n\nLättähattu local train\n\n1955\n\nNew four-axle trams were introduced.\n\nHKL four-axle tram\n\n1958\n\nThe trolleybus line was extended to Tukholmankatu in Meilahti.\n\n1950's\n\nThe main municipalities in Helsinki region were Helsinki, Espoo, Kauniainen and Helsingin maalaiskunta (later Vantaa).\n\n1964\n\nThe first attempt to have a joint fare system was made. The private bus routes running within Helsinki borders had the same prices as HKL. However they still used their own tickets. Buses to neighbouring municipalities Espoo and Helsingin maalaiskunta still used the kilometre-based fare system.\n\nStandard HKL bus, 1960's, Scania-Vabis B75 / Helko. Photo Bosse Ahlnäs\n\n1966\n\nVuosaari housing area was incorporated into Helsinki.\n\nA new two-numbered postal code system was introduced. All suburban bus routes within Helsinki (HKL and private) received a common numbering system according to postal codes. Most bus routes to and in Espoo and Helsingin maalaiskunta had no route numbers. Some operators used their own numbers. So there were several routes having numbers 1, 2, 3 etc.\n\nPrivate company bus, Oy Liikenne Ab Volvo B635 / Wiima M-64. Photo: Hannu T. Pulkkinen\n\n1969\n\nThe first electric local trains were introduced. They were Finnish-made so called Sm1-trains.\n\nThe first articulated bus in Finland was introduced by operator Helsinki-Maaseutu-Liikenne Oy. It had Volvo B58 chassis with Wiima body.\n\n1970\n\nPääkaupunkiseudun yhteistyövaltuuskunta (YTV) (Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council) was founded. It later planned all regional bus traffic.\n\nThere were almost 40 bus operators in the region, all private except HKL.\n\n1971\n\nHKL took responsibility of planning the whole public transport within Helsinki. All private buses used now HKL tickets and tariff. HKL also demanded the private operators to purchase more urban-like buses. Many private buses had been rural-based. Buses to and in Espoo and Helsingin maalaiskunta used still the kilometre-based tariff,and the vehicles were quite rural, not very suitable for urban traffic.\n\nThe Suomenlinna ferry started to use HKL tariff.\n\n1972\n\nHelsingin maalaiskunta changed its name to Vantaa (the city of Vantaa in 1974).\n\nA new numbering system for bus routes outside Helsinki was introduced. Regional routes received three-digit numbering and routes inside Espoo and Vantaa numbers below one hundred. Espoo and Vantaa could use same numbers (as well as Helsinki), so there could be three routes in the Helsinki region with the same number.\n\nLocal trains received route indicators (A, K, R etc.)\n\n1973\n\nHelsinki abandoned zones. There was now a flat fare regardless of the lenght of the journey.\n\nNew articulated Nr1-trams were taken into traffic. They had grey and orange livery instead of the traditional green and yellow. They had fleet numbers from 31 onwards.\n\nThe city of Helsinki bought two private bus operators; Helsinki-Maaseutu-Liikenne Oy (HML) and Suomen Turistiauto Oy (STA).\n\nStandard HKL bus 1970's, Sisu BT-69 CR / Wiima m.

It started to operate the old trolleybus route 14.\n\n1981\n\nMunicipal bus operator HML merged to STA.\n\n1981?\n\nVantaa changed the kilometre-based tariff into it's own flat fare with it's bus routes inside the city.\n\n1982\n\nThe Helsinki Metro to eastern suburbs was opened. At first it ran between Hakaniemi and Itäkeskus. Soon it was extended to Rautatientori, having now six stations: Rautatientori, Hakaniemi, Kulosaari, Herttoniemi, Siilitie and Itäkeskus. The orange-coloured trains were manufactured in Finland by Valmet / Strömberg and they were numbered in 100-series.\n\nM100-metro train\n\n1983\n\nThe metro was extended westwards to Kamppi. Number of stations 7.\n\n1984\n\nSörnäinen metro station was opened. Number of stations 8.\n\nHelsinki region bus operator Oy Liikenne Ab with it's subsidiaries became the biggest bus company in Finland.\n\n1985\n\nEspoo changed the kilometre-based tariff into it's own two-zone tariff. Journeys inside Espoo were one-zone trips and border-crossing lines (to Helsinki and Vantaa) two-zone trips.\n\nThe sole trolleybus had been occasionally running on route 14. Traffic ended when it was made a decision not to proceed with trolleybus operation.\n\nStandard bus of the 80's, Volvo B10M / Wiima K/N202, the articulated version. HKL livery.\n\n1986\n\nThe new regional ticket was introduced. The new ticket replaced Espoo's two-zone ticket and the kilometre-based system in Vantaa. From now on Helsinki had it's own tariff inside Helsinki, Espoo it's own tariff inside Espoo and Vantaa it's own tariff inside Vantaa. Journeys crossing municipality borders were regional journeys using regional tickets.\n\nThe metro was extended to Kontula. Number of stations 10.\n\n1988\n\nIt was decided to return the green livery to trams. There were new Nr2 cars in production at that time (fleet numbers 71-112).
