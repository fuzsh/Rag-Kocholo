        "text": "In 2022, the right-wing coalition of Fidesz–Hungarian Civic Alliance (Fidesz) and the Christian Democratic People’s Party (KDNP) reconfirmed its governing position by winning the National Assembly elections in April for a fourth consecutive term, thereby maintaining its grip on the formerly independent institutions of Hungary. The government’s uninterrupted authoritarian streak cements Hungary’s place among hybrid regimes, in the “gray zone” between democracies and autocracies.\n\nThe “state of danger,” a special legal order that allows the government to rule by decree, continued throughout 2022, making it the third year with emergency rules in place. As before, the 15-day expiration date of government decrees was circumvented by enabling acts adopted by the two-thirds governing majority. The only change this year was the basis on which the exceptional situation may be declared: following Russia’s attack on Ukraine in February, the Hungarian government, in the tenth amendment to the Fundamental Law passed in May, established that a war or humanitarian catastrophe in a neighboring country are grounds for declaring the state of danger. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic was replaced by the war in Ukraine in this regard.\n\nIn March, the outgoing parliament elected former Fidesz vice-president Katalin Novák as president of the republic with the governing parties’ two-thirds majority, thus securing a political appointee in the office for the coming five years. The April parliamentary elections brought another victory to the Fidesz–KDNP coalition and renewed its constitutional majority in the National Assembly (parliament). The “United for Hungary” coalition of the six main opposition parties—Democratic Coalition, Dialogue, Hungarian Socialist Party, Jobbik, Momentum, and Politics Can Be Different—performed poorer than expected despite unprecedented coordination in the run-up to the elections. With its 2014 and 2018 recommendations still unaddressed, the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) responded to requests from watchdog organizations by calling for a full election observation mission (EOM) to Hungary to monitor the elections. This move, unusual in a European Union (EU) member state, signaled the seriousness of ODIHR's concerns. Prior to the Hungarian elections, the ODIHR had only found it necessary to call for a full EOM in the 2021 Bulgarian elections. Subsequently, its report concluded that despite their professional administration, the elections were “marred by the absence of a level playing field.”\n\nPrior trends that characterized Hungarian politics in previous years continued in 2022. The governing party sought to deepen its ties with far-right actors internationally, while continuing to demonize the opposition and vulnerable groups, and putting pressure on government-critical voices domestically.\n\nThe Russia-friendly attitude of the Fidesz-led government, even after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and its efforts to undermine EU unity on the subsequent sanctions against Russia put the party’s relations with Poland’s governing Law and Justice (PiS) party on ice. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s speeches—delivered with far-right rhetoric in Băile Tușnad, Romania, and at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the capital Budapest and later in Dallas, Texas—signaled an ideological radicalization of the party and showed the shift of its international partnerships from conservative right-wing to far-right actors.\n\nWhile the governing parties and progovernment media accused the opposition of trying to drag Hungary into the war, and thereby depicting it as a threat to the nation, the LGBT+ community was singled out in government narratives conflating homosexuality with pedophilia, presenting the former as a threat to the nation’s children. The government’s so-called child protection referendum, announced in 2021, took place alongside the April parliamentary elections, furthering this anti-LGBT+ campaign. Although the referendum results were ruled invalid due to insufficient voter turnout (under 50 percent), the vast majority of valid votes favored the government’s position and Fidesz characterized it as a success. Civil society organizations speaking out against the homophobic nature of the referendum were fined by the National Election Committee, although their appeals against the decisions were partly sustained by the Curia (Hungary’s supreme court).\n\nDefamatory and smear campaigns were targeted at nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and their staff both at home and abroad. In a move widely seen as ramping up pressure on critical voices in the civic sector, the State Audit Office requested access to internal financial documents of NGOs deemed as “engaging in activities likely to influence public life.” In an attempt to curb ongoing civil disobedience by teachers who went on strike after demands for higher wages and better working conditions went unheard, government officials dismissed many from their positions. Likewise, government-critical voices in public media are not tolerated. A series of leaked documents from Hungary’s public news agency revealed extensive government influence and internal censorship on issues sensitive for the governing parties.\n\nInvestigations by the Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information into the state’s use of Pegasus spyware against Hungarian journalists, politicians, and businessmen found no legal breaches, and thus no prosecutions were forthcoming. Meanwhile, the Ombudsperson refrained from engaging in politically sensitive cases and avoided defending vulnerable groups, which resulted in the office being downgraded by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) for its lack of independence. The practice of politically motivated nominations continued in the highest offices of the justice system. Members of the National Judicial Council, considered the last independent institution of the judiciary, faced backlash for speaking out against this practice and the increasing political pressure on judges.\n\nDisputes between the European Commission and the Hungarian government also reached new heights. After the EU Court of Justice found that the newly introduced rule-of-law conditionality regulation is in line with EU law, the commission triggered the procedure against Hungary in April over concerns about the misuse of EU budgetary funds. In September, it proposed the suspension of €7.5 billion of the structural funds allocated for Hungary unless the government implemented a series of measures that would reduce corruption risk and guarantee the appropriate use of EU funds. Not seeing sufficient progress by November, the commission and the Council of the EU upheld the freeze, although the suspended amount of the structural funds was reduced to €6.3 billion. Furthermore, disbursement of the suspended funds and the release of Hungary’s share in the Recovery and Resilience Facility supporting post-COVID recovery was made conditional upon implementation of 27 “super milestones.” These include anticorruption measures and steps to address concerns about judicial independence. The next review of the government’s progress is set to take place in 2023."
